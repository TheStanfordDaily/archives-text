## Letter To Goldwater 
### 
Dear Senator:
We are writing this letter to ask you
to withdraw from the Presidential race.
A brash request? Perhaps — but we are
completely sincere. In our opinion, few
men in American history have been more
unfit for the office than you.
To begin with, you have little back
ground for the Presidency. Your education,
both formal and informal, is woefully lack
ing. As a student, >011 were a disaster, and
so you dropped out of college at the end
of your freshman year.
OF COURSE, THERE is more to edu
cation than formal schooling. Many of our
presidents educated themselves by exten
sive, serious reading.
But not you, Senator. One oi your
biographers says you never read anything
beyond Popular Mechanics until age 25.
And since then about the only serious read
ing you have done is on Arizona history.
But what do you know of American
history? Of world history? Of political
theory? Of philosophy? Of law? Of sci
ence? The presidency, after all, is not a
job for Philistines.
AGAIN AND AGAIN in your drive for
Presidency you have made pronouncements
that underscore your appalling lack of edu
cation — your utter disregard of those his
torical causes of war—and your frightening
irresponsibility'.
You are, in the most detestable sense ol
the word, an ignorant warmongered
Yesterday two wire services quoted you
as advocating that low-yield atomic weap
ons be dropped in Southeast Asia to re
move foliage from the rain forests, thereby
exposing Communist supply routes. What,
then, would prohibit Bed China, when she
gets The Bomb, from using such weaponry
in Southeast Asia?
YOU WERE FURTHER quoted as sav
ing we should bomb roads, bridges a 11 d
railroads used for bringing supplies from
Bed China into North Vietnam. And w hen
you were asked if such non-atomic forays
should be made on the Chinese side of the
border, you replied that we "might have
to. ... Either that or we have aw ar dragged
out and dragged out.
What you are advocating is preventive
war! The U.S. dropping bombs on Bed
China.
Certainly Peking, in its uncommonly
bellicose mood, is going to do exactly what
we or anyone else would do if bombed by
another power: It is going to declare war.
And that would mean World War 111.
IS THIS YOUR WAY of solving the
Vietnam problem?

You arc quoted in the April 21 Look
Magazine as saving;: "We should encour
age the captive peoples to revolt against
their Communist rulers. W e should give
underground leaders weapons, radios and
the paraphernalia of a lull-Hedged resist
ance."
Now even you, Senator — in all your
sweet, illogical bliss — must see the double
standard here. You say we should bomb
lied China and North Vietnam for supply
ing the anti-Western rebels. Then why
shouldn't the Communists bomb us for sup
plying anti-Red rebels?
We cannot understand why you insist
that we Hirt with nuclear war.
W e know the Look article reported you
as saying that "some day i am convinced
there will either be a war or we'll be sub
jugated without war . . . real nuclear war
. . . I don't see how it can be avoided.
ON OCTOBER 25 last year the w ire ser
vices reported a press conference in which
you recommended that the NATO com
manders be given complete authority to de
cide whether to employ tactical nuclear
weapons. And on November 3, 1962 you
told a New York audience that disarma
ment w as "a dangerous exercise in complete
and total futility."
Ironically, a brochure lrom your office
("Where I Stand") quotes you as saying
that the Administration's disarmament ef
forts are a "terrible gamble with the lives
of every free man, woman and child on
earth."
II anybody is gambling with the lives of
this planet — it is you.
WE COULD go on, ad nauseam, w ith
your jingoistic stands—your advocating that
we quit the UN immediately (made early
in 1963 and later modified and contradicted
by you in the New Hampshire cam
paign), that we stop foreign economic aid
(made in I960), that we withdraw recog
nition of the Soviet Union (made in 1958
and reiterated until recently—you now say
the threat of such can be a "bargaining
tool ), that we should have sent troops into
Panama (made early this year), that we
should end East-West cultural exchanges
because they act as "red spy transmission
lines" (made in I960), that Communist
leaders not be "welcome in any W hite
House I was presiding over" (made in
1963), that we not "give a tinker's damn
w hat the rest of the world thinks about the
United States, as long as we keep strong
militarily" (made in 1963).
Your domestic stands are equally chau
vinistic—vour opposition to federal aid to
education, to any new government welfare,
to the graduated features of the income
tax. But, above all, we are repulsed by your
hypocrisy on the civil rights issue.
You have written in one of your cam
paign brochures (this one called "Where
Goldwater Stands ') that "we must always
make a sharp distinction between civil
rights guaranteed under the Constitution
and those rights of association that are
basically moral issues. . .
AND SO YOU ARE willing to defend
property rights but not human dignity. In
your opposition to the public accommoda
tions section of the civil rights bill [see "The
Forum on this page] you are willing to
allow a race to be barred from a public
(not a pri\ ate) place.
You write in your brochure: "The key
to racial and religious tolerance lies, not in
laws alone, but ultimately in the hearts of
men." Then you piously proclaim yourself

as an example of an individual who lought
"to eliminate the stigma of discrimination."
You write that you have "assisted in the
desegregation of restaurants and other fa
cilities in Phoenix by local option."
ALL RIGHT, let's look at your individ
ual accomplishment. Your ability to em
bellish the truth is certainly worth noting.
But your civil rights "work" in Phoenix is
not.
You were a member of the Council for
Civic Unity and the NAACP. According to
sources The Daily contacted there — in
cluding a high-ranking officer of the Council
at the time of your association — your mem
bership was entirely nominal. And, we
might add, political.
You didn't do a thing in these organiza
tions.
YOUR DEPARTMENT store, however,
contributed nicely to the segregationist
cause. A few years ago, when it was still
under Goldwater ownership, your store pro

vitled a free meeting hall in the basement
for arch-segregationist (and Bircher) Billy
James Hargis.
One of the most frightening aspects ol
your candidacy is your refusal to disasso
ciate yourself from the Birch Society and
other such extremists. Yes, you have criti
cized Robert Welch; lie's everybody's
whipping boy.
But you claim the Society itself is not
extremist — even though its Bluebook, Poli
tician, American Opinion and other docu
ments allege, for example, that the State
Dept. is run by Communists, that the UN is
a Communist tool and that Earl Warren
lias committed treason.
THE VERY SAME people who are suf
fering from this paranoia are playing roles
in your campaign. And you know it.
For all of these reasons, then, we are
asking you to withdraw from the nice.
For you, sir, are a dangerous man.

then, would prohibit Bed China, when she
gets The Bomb, from using such weaponry
in Southeast Asia?
YOU WERE FURTHER quoted as sav
ing we should bomb roads, bridges a 11 d
railroads used for bringing supplies from
Bed China into North Vietnam. And w hen
you were asked if such non-atomic forays
should be made on the Chinese side of the
border, you replied that we "might have
to. ... Either that or we have aw ar dragged
out and dragged out.
What you are advocating is preventive
war! The U.S. dropping bombs on Bed
China.
Certainly Peking, in its uncommonly
bellicose mood, is going to do exactly what
we or anyone else would do if bombed by
another power: It is going to declare war.
And that would mean World War 111.
IS THIS YOUR WAY of solving the
Vietnam problem?

You arc quoted in the April 21 Look
Magazine as saving;: "We should encour
age the captive peoples to revolt against
their Communist rulers. W e should give
underground leaders weapons, radios and
the paraphernalia of a lull-Hedged resist
ance."
Now even you, Senator — in all your
sweet, illogical bliss — must see the double
standard here. You say we should bomb
lied China and North Vietnam for supply
ing the anti-Western rebels. Then why
shouldn't the Communists bomb us for sup
plying anti-Red rebels?
We cannot understand why you insist
that we Hirt with nuclear war.
W e know the Look article reported you
as saying that "some day i am convinced
there will either be a war or we'll be sub
jugated without war . . . real nuclear war
. . . I don't see how it can be avoided.
ON OCTOBER 25 last year the w ire ser
vices reported a press conference in which
you recommended that the NATO com
manders be given complete authority to de
cide whether to employ tactical nuclear
weapons. And on November 3, 1962 you
told a New York audience that disarma
ment w as "a dangerous exercise in complete
and total futility."
Ironically, a brochure lrom your office
("Where I Stand") quotes you as saying
that the Administration's disarmament ef
forts are a "terrible gamble with the lives
of every free man, woman and child on
earth."
II anybody is gambling with the lives of
this planet — it is you.
WE COULD go on, ad nauseam, w ith
your jingoistic stands—your advocating that
we quit the UN immediately (made early
in 1963 and later modified and contradicted
by you in the New Hampshire cam
paign), that we stop foreign economic aid
(made in I960), that we withdraw recog
nition of the Soviet Union (made in 1958
and reiterated until recently—you now say
the threat of such can be a "bargaining
tool ), that we should have sent troops into
Panama (made early this year), that we
should end East-West cultural exchanges
because they act as "red spy transmission
lines" (made in I960), that Communist
leaders not be "welcome in any W hite
House I was presiding over" (made in
1963), that we not "give a tinker's damn
w hat the rest of the world thinks about the
United States, as long as we keep strong
militarily" (made in 1963).
Your domestic stands are equally chau
vinistic—vour opposition to federal aid to
education, to any new government welfare,
to the graduated features of the income
tax. But, above all, we are repulsed by your
hypocrisy on the civil rights issue.
You have written in one of your cam
paign brochures (this one called "Where
Goldwater Stands ') that "we must always
make a sharp distinction between civil
rights guaranteed under the Constitution
and those rights of association that are
basically moral issues. . .
AND SO YOU ARE willing to defend
property rights but not human dignity. In
your opposition to the public accommoda
tions section of the civil rights bill [see "The
Forum on this page] you are willing to
allow a race to be barred from a public
(not a pri\ ate) place.
You write in your brochure: "The key
to racial and religious tolerance lies, not in
laws alone, but ultimately in the hearts of
men." Then you piously proclaim yourself

as an example of an individual who lought
"to eliminate the stigma of discrimination."
You write that you have "assisted in the
desegregation of restaurants and other fa
cilities in Phoenix by local option."
ALL RIGHT, let's look at your individ
ual accomplishment. Your ability to em
bellish the truth is certainly worth noting.
But your civil rights "work" in Phoenix is
not.
You were a member of the Council for
Civic Unity and the NAACP. According to
sources The Daily contacted there — in
cluding a high-ranking officer of the Council
at the time of your association — your mem
bership was entirely nominal. And, we
might add, political.
You didn't do a thing in these organiza
tions.
YOUR DEPARTMENT store, however,
contributed nicely to the segregationist
cause. A few years ago, when it was still
under Goldwater ownership, your store pro

vitled a free meeting hall in the basement
for arch-segregationist (and Bircher) Billy
James Hargis.
One of the most frightening aspects ol
your candidacy is your refusal to disasso
ciate yourself from the Birch Society and
other such extremists. Yes, you have criti
cized Robert Welch; lie's everybody's
whipping boy.
But you claim the Society itself is not
extremist — even though its Bluebook, Poli
tician, American Opinion and other docu
ments allege, for example, that the State
Dept. is run by Communists, that the UN is
a Communist tool and that Earl Warren
lias committed treason.
THE VERY SAME people who are suf
fering from this paranoia are playing roles
in your campaign. And you know it.
For all of these reasons, then, we are
asking you to withdraw from the nice.
For you, sir, are a dangerous man.
THE STANFORD DAILY
Dear Senator:
We are writing this letter to ask you
to withdraw from the Presidential race.
A brash request? Perhaps — but we are
completely sincere. In our opinion, few
men in American history have been more
unfit for the office than you.
To begin with, you have little back
ground for the Presidency. Your education,
both formal and informal, is woefully lack
ing. As a student, >011 were a disaster, and
so you dropped out of college at the end
of your freshman year.
OF COURSE, THERE is more to edu
cation than formal schooling. Many of our
presidents educated themselves by exten
sive, serious reading.
But not you, Senator. One oi your
biographers says you never read anything
beyond Popular Mechanics until age 25.
And since then about the only serious read
ing you have done is on Arizona history.
But what do you know of American
history? Of world history? Of political
theory? Of philosophy? Of law? Of sci
ence? The presidency, after all, is not a
job for Philistines.
AGAIN AND AGAIN in your drive for
Presidency you have made pronouncements
that underscore your appalling lack of edu
cation — your utter disregard of those his
torical causes of war—and your frightening
irresponsibility'.
You are, in the most detestable sense ol
the word, an ignorant warmongered
Yesterday two wire services quoted you
as advocating that low-yield atomic weap
ons be dropped in Southeast Asia to re
move foliage from the rain forests, thereby
exposing Communist supply routes. What,

Dear Senator:
We are writing this letter to ask you
to withdraw from the Presidential race.
A brash request? Perhaps — but we are
completely sincere. In our opinion, few
men in American history have been more
unfit for the office than you.
To begin with, you have little back
ground for the Presidency. Your education,
both formal and informal, is woefully lack
ing. As a student, >011 were a disaster, and
so you dropped out of college at the end
of your freshman year.
OF COURSE, THERE is more to edu
cation than formal schooling. Many of our
presidents educated themselves by exten
sive, serious reading.
But not you, Senator. One oi your
biographers says you never read anything
beyond Popular Mechanics until age 25.
And since then about the only serious read
ing you have done is on Arizona history.
But what do you know of American
history? Of world history? Of political
theory? Of philosophy? Of law? Of sci
ence? The presidency, after all, is not a
job for Philistines.
AGAIN AND AGAIN in your drive for
Presidency you have made pronouncements
that underscore your appalling lack of edu
cation — your utter disregard of those his
torical causes of war—and your frightening
irresponsibility'.
You are, in the most detestable sense ol
the word, an ignorant warmongered
Yesterday two wire services quoted you
as advocating that low-yield atomic weap
ons be dropped in Southeast Asia to re
move foliage from the rain forests, thereby
exposing Communist supply routes. What,
then, would prohibit Bed China, when she
gets The Bomb, from using such weaponry
in Southeast Asia?
YOU WERE FURTHER quoted as sav
ing we should bomb roads, bridges a 11 d
railroads used for bringing supplies from
Bed China into North Vietnam. And w hen
you were asked if such non-atomic forays
should be made on the Chinese side of the
border, you replied that we "might have
to. ... Either that or we have aw ar dragged
out and dragged out.
What you are advocating is preventive
war! The U.S. dropping bombs on Bed
China.
Certainly Peking, in its uncommonly
bellicose mood, is going to do exactly what
we or anyone else would do if bombed by
another power: It is going to declare war.
And that would mean World War 111.
IS THIS YOUR WAY of solving the
Vietnam problem?

You arc quoted in the April 21 Look
Magazine as saving;: "We should encour
age the captive peoples to revolt against
their Communist rulers. W e should give
underground leaders weapons, radios and
the paraphernalia of a lull-Hedged resist
ance."
Now even you, Senator — in all your
sweet, illogical bliss — must see the double
standard here. You say we should bomb
lied China and North Vietnam for supply
ing the anti-Western rebels. Then why
shouldn't the Communists bomb us for sup
plying anti-Red rebels?
We cannot understand why you insist
that we Hirt with nuclear war.

Your domestic stands are equally chau
vinistic—vour opposition to federal aid to
education, to any new government welfare,
to the graduated features of the income
tax. But, above all, we are repulsed by your
hypocrisy on the civil rights issue.

paign brochures (this one called "Where
Goldwater Stands ') that "we must always
make a sharp distinction between civil
rights guaranteed under the Constitution
and those rights of association that are
basically moral issues. . .
AND SO YOU ARE willing to defend
property rights but not human dignity. In
your opposition to the public accommoda
tions section of the civil rights bill [see "The
Forum on this page] you are willing to
allow a race to be barred from a public
(not a pri\ ate) place.
You write in your brochure: "The key
to racial and religious tolerance lies, not in
laws alone, but ultimately in the hearts of
men." Then you piously proclaim yourself

as an example of an individual who lought
"to eliminate the stigma of discrimination."
You write that you have "assisted in the
desegregation of restaurants and other fa
cilities in Phoenix by local option."
ALL RIGHT, let's look at your individ
ual accomplishment. Your ability to em
bellish the truth is certainly worth noting.
But your civil rights "work" in Phoenix is
not.
You were a member of the Council for
Civic Unity and the NAACP. According to
sources The Daily contacted there — in
cluding a high-ranking officer of the Council
at the time of your association — your mem
bership was entirely nominal. And, we
might add, political.
You didn't do a thing in these organiza
tions.
YOUR DEPARTMENT store, however,
contributed nicely to the segregationist
cause. A few years ago, when it was still
under Goldwater ownership, your store pro

vitled a free meeting hall in the basement
for arch-segregationist (and Bircher) Billy
James Hargis.
One of the most frightening aspects ol
your candidacy is your refusal to disasso
ciate yourself from the Birch Society and
other such extremists. Yes, you have criti
cized Robert Welch; lie's everybody's
whipping boy.
But you claim the Society itself is not
extremist — even though its Bluebook, Poli
tician, American Opinion and other docu
ments allege, for example, that the State
Dept. is run by Communists, that the UN is
a Communist tool and that Earl Warren
lias committed treason.
THE VERY SAME people who are suf
fering from this paranoia are playing roles
in your campaign. And you know it.
For all of these reasons, then, we are
asking you to withdraw from the nice.
For you, sir, are a dangerous man.

leaders not be "welcome in any W hite
House I was presiding over" (made in
1963), that we not "give a tinker's damn
w hat the rest of the world thinks about the
United States, as long as we keep strong
militarily" (made in 1963).
Your domestic stands are equally chau
vinistic—vour opposition to federal aid to
education, to any new government welfare,
to the graduated features of the income
tax. But, above all, we are repulsed by your
hypocrisy on the civil rights issue.
You have written in one of your cam
paign brochures (this one called "Where
Goldwater Stands ') that "we must always
make a sharp distinction between civil
rights guaranteed under the Constitution
and those rights of association that are
basically moral issues. . .
AND SO YOU ARE willing to defend
property rights but not human dignity. In
your opposition to the public accommoda
tions section of the civil rights bill [see "The
Forum on this page] you are willing to
allow a race to be barred from a public
(not a pri\ ate) place.
You write in your brochure: "The key
to racial and religious tolerance lies, not in
laws alone, but ultimately in the hearts of
men." Then you piously proclaim yourself

as an example of an individual who lought
"to eliminate the stigma of discrimination."
You write that you have "assisted in the
desegregation of restaurants and other fa
cilities in Phoenix by local option."
ALL RIGHT, let's look at your individ
ual accomplishment. Your ability to em
bellish the truth is certainly worth noting.
But your civil rights "work" in Phoenix is
not.
You were a member of the Council for
Civic Unity and the NAACP. According to
sources The Daily contacted there — in
cluding a high-ranking officer of the Council
at the time of your association — your mem
bership was entirely nominal. And, we
might add, political.
You didn't do a thing in these organiza
tions.
YOUR DEPARTMENT store, however,
contributed nicely to the segregationist
cause. A few years ago, when it was still
under Goldwater ownership, your store pro

vitled a free meeting hall in the basement
for arch-segregationist (and Bircher) Billy
James Hargis.
One of the most frightening aspects ol
your candidacy is your refusal to disasso
ciate yourself from the Birch Society and
other such extremists. Yes, you have criti
cized Robert Welch; lie's everybody's
whipping boy.
But you claim the Society itself is not
extremist — even though its Bluebook, Poli
tician, American Opinion and other docu
ments allege, for example, that the State
Dept. is run by Communists, that the UN is
a Communist tool and that Earl Warren
lias committed treason.
THE VERY SAME people who are suf
fering from this paranoia are playing roles
in your campaign. And you know it.
For all of these reasons, then, we are
asking you to withdraw from the nice.
For you, sir, are a dangerous man.
THE STANFORD DAILY
Dear Senator:
We are writing this letter to ask you
to withdraw from the Presidential race.
A brash request? Perhaps — but we are
completely sincere. In our opinion, few
men in American history have been more
unfit for the office than you.
To begin with, you have little back
ground for the Presidency. Your education,
both formal and informal, is woefully lack
ing. As a student, >011 were a disaster, and
so you dropped out of college at the end
of your freshman year.
OF COURSE, THERE is more to edu
cation than formal schooling. Many of our
presidents educated themselves by exten
sive, serious reading.
But not you, Senator. One oi your
biographers says you never read anything
beyond Popular Mechanics until age 25.
And since then about the only serious read
ing you have done is on Arizona history.
But what do you know of American
history? Of world history? Of political
theory? Of philosophy? Of law? Of sci
ence? The presidency, after all, is not a
job for Philistines.
AGAIN AND AGAIN in your drive for
Presidency you have made pronouncements
that underscore your appalling lack of edu
cation — your utter disregard of those his
torical causes of war—and your frightening
irresponsibility'.
You are, in the most detestable sense ol
the word, an ignorant warmongered
Yesterday two wire services quoted you
as advocating that low-yield atomic weap
ons be dropped in Southeast Asia to re
move foliage from the rain forests, thereby
exposing Communist supply routes. What,
then, would prohibit Bed China, when she
gets The Bomb, from using such weaponry
in Southeast Asia?
YOU WERE FURTHER quoted as sav
ing we should bomb roads, bridges a 11 d
railroads used for bringing supplies from
Bed China into North Vietnam. And w hen
you were asked if such non-atomic forays
should be made on the Chinese side of the
border, you replied that we "might have
to. ... Either that or we have aw ar dragged
out and dragged out.
What you are advocating is preventive
war! The U.S. dropping bombs on Bed
China.
Certainly Peking, in its uncommonly
bellicose mood, is going to do exactly what
we or anyone else would do if bombed by
another power: It is going to declare war.
And that would mean World War 111.
IS THIS YOUR WAY of solving the
Vietnam problem?

You arc quoted in the April 21 Look
Magazine as saving;: "We should encour
age the captive peoples to revolt against
their Communist rulers. W e should give
underground leaders weapons, radios and
the paraphernalia of a lull-Hedged resist
ance."
Now even you, Senator — in all your
sweet, illogical bliss — must see the double
standard here. You say we should bomb
lied China and North Vietnam for supply
ing the anti-Western rebels. Then why
shouldn't the Communists bomb us for sup
plying anti-Red rebels?
We cannot understand why you insist
that we Hirt with nuclear war.
W e know the Look article reported you
as saying that "some day i am convinced
there will either be a war or we'll be sub
jugated without war . . . real nuclear war
. . . I don't see how it can be avoided.
ON OCTOBER 25 last year the w ire ser
vices reported a press conference in which
you recommended that the NATO com
manders be given complete authority to de
cide whether to employ tactical nuclear
weapons. And on November 3, 1962 you
told a New York audience that disarma
ment w as "a dangerous exercise in complete
and total futility."
Ironically, a brochure lrom your office
("Where I Stand") quotes you as saying
that the Administration's disarmament ef
forts are a "terrible gamble with the lives
of every free man, woman and child on
earth."
II anybody is gambling with the lives of
this planet — it is you.
WE COULD go on, ad nauseam, w ith
your jingoistic stands—your advocating that
we quit the UN immediately (made early
in 1963 and later modified and contradicted
by you in the New Hampshire cam
paign), that we stop foreign economic aid
(made in I960), that we withdraw recog
nition of the Soviet Union (made in 1958
and reiterated until recently—you now say
the threat of such can be a "bargaining
tool ), that we should have sent troops into
Panama (made early this year), that we
should end East-West cultural exchanges
because they act as "red spy transmission
lines" (made in I960), that Communist
leaders not be "welcome in any W hite
House I was presiding over" (made in
1963), that we not "give a tinker's damn
w hat the rest of the world thinks about the
United States, as long as we keep strong
