# Committee On Politics Requested
## Group To Study Partisan Bodies 
### 
The chairmen of most of Stan
ford's voluntary political groups
asked LASSU today to establish
a committee to investigate the
status of partisan politics at Stan
ford.
The committee would consist
of representatives of Political
Union, LASSU, and the group
chairmen.
Martin Gibson, Speaker of
LASSU, commented: "It is obvi
ous that the situation requires
further investigation."
The statement asked that
LASSU refrain from overriding
the veto of last week's change in
the Political Union by-laws "until
all parties involved in this major
proposed alteration in the struc
ture of partisan political activity
at Stanford be given an oppor
tunity to consult together with a
view to finding a workable solu
tion to the problem."
It took issue with Political
Union officers who claim that last
year's Board of Trustees' policy
r e vi si on prohibited voluntary
groups from participating in Poli
tical Union. "The intent of the
Trustees last year was to liberal
ize conditions, not restrict them,"
the groups contended.
"Only by retaining some sort
of arrangement (such as allowing
the groups to participate in Poli
tical Union elections) can mem
bers of the student body who are
not already in the Political Union
be assured of an opportunity to
become active and influential
there. . . .
"... At present only the dem- :

ocratic process of annual olection
acts as a check upon" Political
Union's power to schedule or re
fuse to schedule programs at the
discretion of its officers, the
groups said.


NEXT YEAR'S pom pon girls pose

Janss, Freddie Baumstark, Lynn
Williams and Winky Belz.
