# REVIEW REVIEWED
## A
						Handful Of Departments Superficially Surveyed 
### JIM BRISCOE 
The offspring of last year's notorious Scratch Sheet, the Aca
demic Aflairs Committee's Course Review, is now available but
is greath' changed from its infamous predecessor.
As the change of name indicates, the primary emphasis is now
on reviewing and describing the courses rather than evaluating

them. Unfortunately, the result of
this change is a superficial survey
of Ihe courses in a handful of de
part men Is.
THE REVIEW is divided into
three sections: course reviews,
reviews of honors programs, a n d
surveys. Of the three, the first is
the most superficial.

The most apparent inadequacy
is in the number of departments
reviewed. Only eleven depart
ments are covered, all of them
classified as humanities or social
1 sciences.
IN GKNKKAL each review con
tains a listing of the books and
the number of papers required
I for the course, and makes so m e
mention of the instructor. It may
! also include a description of the
j course content, a discussion of
I the professor's approach to the
' material, or a summation of the
I purposes of the course, depending
! on the reviewer.
The second section offers a rea
i sonably comprehensive dcscrip- j
lion of the honors programs giv
en in the eleven departments and I
'some constructive criticism.!
THIS FINAL section, on surveys
land questionnaires, while cor-'
; tainly the most inadequate in j
scope, is in many ways the most
worthwhile portion of the He
view. The data is well correlated
and a number of apparently valid
criticisms of the courses are
made on this basis.
The Review, while containing
some redeeming features, is on
the whole inadequate in scope and
superficial in nature. Consider
able expansion both in the si/c
and depth of the reviews is badly
needed, if it is to bo more than
a .superfluous listing of courses
and instructors.
