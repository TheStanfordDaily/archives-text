# Colloquia System May Get Reform
## Student Requests Get Tacit Consent 
### JIM POAGE News Editor 
The General Studies Committee
last week gave tacit approval to
four out of five proposals to alter
Senior Colloquia presented by the
Student Academic Affairs Com
mittee.
According to Mark Lohman,
chairman of the Student academic
Affairs Committee, one suggested
reform may make it possible for
students to approach a professor
and establish their own Collo
quium.
THE GENERAL Studies Com
mittee agreed with a student com
mittee recommendation that the
number of colloquia be increased,
and noted that efforts were al
ready being made in this direc
tion.
Lohman's group also suggested
that new sources of instructor
talent be sought. The students
presented a list of such sources,
stressing a greater use of quali
fied people from the surrounding
community.
It was suggested that Ira Sand
perl might conduct a colloquium
on foreign graduate students
teach on topics pertinent to their
countries. The General Studies
Committee agreed that a need for
new talent does exist but object
ed to the use of instructors from
outside the university commu
unity.
IT WAS FURTHER proposed
that students be permitted to
| form Colloquia themselves. The
i suggested reform would allow
i students to approach an individ
! ual professor with a request for
a colloquium on a specific subject,
j or would permit living groups to
establish colloquia with half the
j class from the group itself and
s the other half from the eligible
j student body at large.
The General Studies Committee
i tentatively approved the estab
lishment of a few colloquia by
students next year.
Another student proposal asked
: that, colloquia be opened to Ju
niors who have finished their ma
j jors.
THE GENERAL Studies Com-
Imittee. however, rejected this
i suggestion because it conflicted
with the initial philosophy Ilia)
| the colloquia act as a capstone to
! the student's undergraduate edit
J cation.
The final student recommenda
tion that Colloquia be expanded
on a voluntary basis to interested
i students in science and engineer
: ing meet with the approval of the
General Studies Committee who
indicated that such an expansion
was already in progress.
