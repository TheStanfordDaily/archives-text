# A 						WAYWARD MANKIND, BUT A MAGNIFICENT GOD
## 
### 
In California recently a group of businessmen and civic leaders concerned
about the Russian threat met to study the differences between "their" way of
life and ours." Each individual sought ways to apply his own talents and
capacities to work towards world peace. After an exhaustive study this group
arrived at the conclusion that the underlying characteristic of the Communist
ideology is Atheism, whereas, our way of life is firmly founded upon freedom
of religious expression and an implicit acknowledgement that there is a sover
eign God. These California leaders turned from their studies of politics and
power struggles to look at Christian beliefs, and in a short time they formed
Biible study groups. Soon they became convinced that God indeed holds the
key to the solution of national and world problems, and that their most effec
tive contribution to world affairs could be made by personally committing their
lives to the Lord Jesus Christ.
It is indeed refreshing to turn from the things of this world which are so com
plex and confused to look at God, Who is unchanging and eternal, for in Him
is to be found the solution to every human problem.
Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the
beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? It is
God Who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are as grass
hoppers,- it is He Who stretches out the heavens like curtains and spreads them
out like a tent to dwell in, Who brings dignitaries to nothing, Who makes the
judges and rulers of the earth as chaos. Yes these men are scarcely planted,
scarcely have they been sown, scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth
when the Lord blows upon them and they wither, and the whirlwind or tempest
takes them away like stubble. To Whom then will you liken Me, that I should
be equal to him? says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high and see! Who
has created these? He Who brings out their host by number and calls them all
by name; through the greatness of His might, and because He is strong in
power not one is missing or lacks anything." (Isaiah 40:21 -26 Ampl.)
"Behold the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are counted as the
small dust on the scales; behold, he takes up the isles like a very little thing
... All the nations are as nothing before Him; they are regardd by Him as
less than nothing, as emptiness, waste, futility and worthlessness (Isaiah
40:15-17).
Perhaps these Biblical quotes have shown you that God is still very much in
charge of the world situation and is sovereign and supreme. It is possible for
you to know this God personally through His Eternal Son, Jesus Chirst. He cares
so very much for you and me that He made full atonement for the sins of the
entire world on the cross of Calvary:
"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the
sins of the whole world." (I John 2:2).
Once you have met Jesus Christ you'll forever belong to this great and mcirvel
our God.
"Have you not known? Have you not heard? The everlasting God, the Lord,
the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint or grow weary; there is
no searching of His understanding. He gives power to the faint and weary,
and to him who has no might He increases strength—causing it to multiply
and making it abound. Even youths shall faint and be weary, and the selected
young men shall feebly stumble and fall exhausted; But those who wait for
the Lord, who expect, look for and hope in Him —shall change and renew their
strength and power,- they shall lift up their wings and mount up close to God
as eagles; they shall run and not be weary,- they shall walk and not faint or
become tired." (Is. 40:28-31).

the Creator of the ends of the earth, does not faint or grow weary; there is
no searching of His understanding. He gives power to the faint and weary,
and to him who has no might He increases strength—causing it to multiply
and making it abound. Even youths shall faint and be weary, and the selected
young men shall feebly stumble and fall exhausted; But those who wait for
the Lord, who expect, look for and hope in Him —shall change and renew their
strength and power,- they shall lift up their wings and mount up close to God
as eagles; they shall run and not be weary,- they shall walk and not faint or
become tired." (Is. 40:28-31).

In California recently a group of businessmen and civic leaders concerned
about the Russian threat met to study the differences between "their" way of
life and ours." Each individual sought ways to apply his own talents and
capacities to work towards world peace. After an exhaustive study this group
arrived at the conclusion that the underlying characteristic of the Communist
ideology is Atheism, whereas, our way of life is firmly founded upon freedom
of religious expression and an implicit acknowledgement that there is a sover
eign God. These California leaders turned from their studies of politics and
power struggles to look at Christian beliefs, and in a short time they formed
Biible study groups. Soon they became convinced that God indeed holds the
key to the solution of national and world problems, and that their most effec
tive contribution to world affairs could be made by personally committing their
lives to the Lord Jesus Christ.
It is indeed refreshing to turn from the things of this world which are so com
plex and confused to look at God, Who is unchanging and eternal, for in Him
is to be found the solution to every human problem.
Do you not know? Have you not heard? Has it not been told you from the
beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? It is
God Who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are as grass
hoppers,- it is He Who stretches out the heavens like curtains and spreads them
out like a tent to dwell in, Who brings dignitaries to nothing, Who makes the
judges and rulers of the earth as chaos. Yes these men are scarcely planted,
scarcely have they been sown, scarcely has their stock taken root in the earth
when the Lord blows upon them and they wither, and the whirlwind or tempest
takes them away like stubble. To Whom then will you liken Me, that I should
be equal to him? says the Holy One. Lift up your eyes on high and see! Who
has created these? He Who brings out their host by number and calls them all
by name; through the greatness of His might, and because He is strong in
power not one is missing or lacks anything." (Isaiah 40:21 -26 Ampl.)
"Behold the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are counted as the
small dust on the scales; behold, he takes up the isles like a very little thing
... All the nations are as nothing before Him; they are regardd by Him as
less than nothing, as emptiness, waste, futility and worthlessness (Isaiah
40:15-17).
Perhaps these Biblical quotes have shown you that God is still very much in
charge of the world situation and is sovereign and supreme. It is possible for
you to know this God personally through His Eternal Son, Jesus Chirst. He cares
so very much for you and me that He made full atonement for the sins of the
entire world on the cross of Calvary:
"And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the
sins of the whole world." (I John 2:2).
Once you have met Jesus Christ you'll forever belong to this great and mcirvel
our God.
