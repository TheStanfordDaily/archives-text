# HUAC Witness To Speak
## 
### 
William Mandcl, a witness in
the House Unamorican Activities
Committee hearings in 1960, will
speak tomorrow at 4:15 in the
Tresidder Large Lounge on
"Should Members of the Commu
nist Party Teach in Our Colleges
and Universities?"
Mr. Mandel was one of the prin
cipal figures in the HIJAC's con
troversial film "Operation Aboli
tion" which he claims was a mis

a
representation of the entire San
Francisco hearing. At that time
he refused to lestify on the
grounds that the subpoena was a
direct violation of the First
Amendment.
Mr. Mandel, who is the author
of two books on Russia, received
a Fellowship in Slavic Studies
from Hoover Institute in 1947 and
spent a year at Moscow Univer
sity.
