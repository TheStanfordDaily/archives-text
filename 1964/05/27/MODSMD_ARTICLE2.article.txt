# SNYDER:
## No Quota System For Admissions 
### MICHAEL ROSTER (Last of Three Articles 
Admissions, by its very nature as a method of evaluation, re
quire eertain arbitrary standards and judgments. In some in
stances, however, the standards and judgments of the Office of
Admissions have been questioned by interested students and fac
ulty members.
The apparent lack of "minority groups' in in-coming classes lias

■been questioned. Often Stanford
is accused of being highly dis
criminatory against such minori
ties.
BUT, THIS ACCORDING to Dr.
Rixford K. Snyder, Director of
Admissions, "is not true at all."
Stanford has no quota system nor
any other system of discrimina
tion.
Yet compared to the larger
state schools, the lack of signifi
cant representations from minor
ity groups is obvious. Dr. Snyder
sees three reasons for this lack:
• Socio-economic background:
Many students just couldn't ad
just to the Stanford social atmos
phere.
• Lack of opportunity in pre
vious education: Students ham
pered by this factor are consid
ered "culturally disadvantaged."
If such students were accepted,
they would still be behind aca
demically.
• A certain amount of resis
tance of minorities to attend if
admitted. Often candidates fear
they won't be fully accepted by
other students.
YET THESE are shortcomings
with which most private colleges
and universities must cope. Stan
ford. however, is presently con
ducting a significant campaign to
correct the situation.
In the recruiting area, Stanford
is a member of the National
Scholarship Service and Fund for
Negro Students (NSSFNS). More
than maintaining such an in
volved title, NSSFNS serves a
vital function in placing qualified
Negroes in colleges throughout
the country.
Each year NSSFNS sends mem
ber colleges lists of students who
might qualify in th e academic

Here's how next year's fresh
man class (Class of '68) compares

and personal requirements. The
Office of Admissions at Stanford,
after receipt of Ihe list, sends
these students a letter and nor
mal application forms.
USUALLY 60 per cent of
NSSFNS siudents apply com
pared to a normal 50 per cent re
turn.
As present Vice Chairman of
the College Board, Dr. Snyder is
also working closely with a pro
gram that will assist "culturally
disadvantaged" students begin
ning in the seventh grade.
A major factor in Stanford's
increase in "minority" representa
tion, however, will he through
feedback of information from
present Stanford students to pos
sible candidates for admission.
I>K. STIKLIN<« lIUNTLLY,
Associate Director of Admissions,
highlighted Stanford's particular
concern with the Mexican-Amor
ican.
Said Huntley, "II we're going
to do our job as a university,
there's a great deal to be done
right here in California."
