# Looking For A Manuscript?
## 
### 
If you happen to have lost thir
teen chapters of a hook or thesis
lately, then perhaps the interde
partmental mail service can help
you.
Interdepartmental Mail Supervi
sor L. Richardson reports that
one of his mail boys picked up the
manuscript on his daily rounds a
couple of days ago. It. was typed
on yellow paper, wrapped in
brown wrapping paper, and had j
Professor Bailey written on the j
front.
WHEN TIIK package came to
the sorting room it was discov
ered. All professors Bailey at
Stanford were telephoned an d
later many students by thai name.
No one knew a thing about the
statistic crammed manuscript..
Richardson then had a mail boy
take the manuscript around on
his route to see if any depart
mental secretaries recognized it.
Still no luck.
As (jf this moment the manu
script is still in the interdepart
mental mail office in Encina Hall,
awaiting its anxious author.
