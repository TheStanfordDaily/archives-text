# Gaughran Top Coach

### ROGER MAGNUSON 
Young, aggressive Jim (Jangh
m. this year's recipient of The

Daily Coach of (he Year award,
gives the impression of an athlete
coach who isn't used to losing.
And, consequently, an athlete
coach who doesn't like to.
Named for the honor this year
when his water polo team aitained
the collegiate national champion
ship and a 21-2 overall record, and
his swimmers swam to 14th in

(ho NCAA. Gaughran himself is
one of the all-time greats in those
two sports in Stanford athletic
hist ory.
lIE ENTERED Stanford in 1950,
graduating with a major in eco
nomies in 1954. From there he

went to Stanford Law School, and,
with an interruption for the 1956
Olympics, obtained his degree in
1958.
His athletic career during these
years bespeaks a natural winner.
Conference 50- and 100-yard free
1 style champion in his junior year,
! repeater in 100-yard free style in
I his senior year, captain of hot h
water polo and swimming teams
that same year, four times cap
tain of the Olympic Club water
poloists, five consecutive years,
('55-'s9>. on Ihe Ail-American
water polo squad, '56 Olympics'
water polo star 1 hat's part, but
only a part, of the Gaughran
method.
WIIKN lll*] re-introduced water
polo in 1960, his enthusiastic, but
sometimes embarrassingly inex
perienced. squad won three and
lost nine.
In 1961, 1 he record improved to
9-8, in 1962 to 16-5, and this year
to 21-2.
With such a successful season
came a flock of sundry kudos for
Gaughran-trained poloists; six re
ceived NorCal conference awards,
five grabbed AAWU honors. And
four, Don Buehler, Pete Petti
grew, Marty Hull, and George
Stransky. gained Collegiate All-
America distinctions.
Til 10 SWIMMING team, under
Graughran's mentorship, was
only slightly less successful, and
shows a likewise steady rise in the
past four years.
Out of ten dual meets this year,
the Stanford swimmers lost but
one, and that to powerful South
ern Cal, national champions in the
NCAA. The swimmers boasted
five Ail-Americans in Marty Hull,
Ilkka Suvanto, Mike Doscher,
Pete Pettigrcw, and Dave Gildea.
PRCMKCTING the past into the
future, things have never looked
so good for Stanford swimming
fortunes; Gaughran's articulate
arguments, and Stanford's gen
eral reputation have wooed many
young recruits here recently,
illustrated most conclusively by
last year's freshman team, which
Gaughran termed "the best fresh
man team in Stanford history."
And once they get here, they
are developed and groomed in the
championship method.
Next year in swimming, for ex
ample, only two regulars don't re
turn Pettigrcw and Bill Lorton.
ALTHOUGH Stanford has, in
those words of Martin Luther
King, Jr.. come a long, long way,
they still have a ways to go, and
will have as long as they don't
win all their meets, for coach
Gaughran doesn't seem to settle
for less.
