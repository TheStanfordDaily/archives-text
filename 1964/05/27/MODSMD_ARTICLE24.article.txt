# Shotputter Wilhelm Top Frosh Athlete
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
From Parry O'Brien to Dallas
Long lo Don Castle, the Univer
sity of Southern California has
year after year come up with the
I big man in AAWU weight events.
TIIK DAII.Y'S Freshman Ath
lete of the Year, Bruce Wilhelm,
plans to change all that, and Stan
ford track coach Payton Jordan
gives him a hearty second. At (i-2
and 240 lbs. Bruce has the si/.e to
j do it, and according to Jordan he
I has the dedication to go along
with his physical stature.
DURING the past track sea
, son Wilhelm was undefeated in
nine dual meets and regularly
beat both freshmen and varsity
competitors. This plus the fact
that Bruce is still a growing boy
with much unused potential is
enough to put live meet points in
any coach's eyes.
Even before this season an opti
mistic attitude would be justifi
able in view of Wilhelm's high
school credentials. As a senior at
! nearby Fremont High School in
Sunnyvale, Wilhelm took first
place in the shot and second in
! the discus to bo one of the top
; point getters at ihe annual high
school state meet. He was also

the state wrestling champ in the
unlimited division.
Wilhelm tossed the 12-pound
ball 65' 6" and spun the discus
177' 8 1 2'' as a prop. Naturally
there was a huge drop in footage
when Wilhelm stepped up to the
16-pound shot, but the coaches
weren't worried as Wilhelm im
proved with almost every outing.
As Coach Jordan says,"He has
dedication and competitiveness,
and you don't dare put a limit on |
him."
His first meet as an Indian saw |
him pin the shot 53' 4V. Some
of his other efforts, in chronologi
cal order, were 54' 6", 55' 1", 55'
6'l'", 55' 55' 7", and 56' 2".
Several times in practice he has
had puts measured at well over
56 feet.
In order to warm up for the
shot Wilhelm usually takes one
or two turns in the discus arena
where he generally throws the
platter 151 feet. One of his few
defeats in this event was suffered
at the hand of former Stanford
student and NCAA champion
Dave Weill.
As can he imagined, track fans
talk of Bruce Wilhelm and Indian
shot put ting records in the same
breath. Jack Chappie's two-year
old mark of 54' 5" gasped its last
sigh as a freshman record in Wil
heim's second outing. In its new
form the record reads "Bruce Wil
helm 56' 2". Th is puts hi m
fourth on the Stanford all-time
shot put ling list, only 2 inches he
hind the number three man, Steve
Arch.
Bruce was the number one
Stanford shotputter and the num
ber two freshman shotputter in
the nation this year. Randy Mat
son was the only frosh ahead of
him.
His next goal though is the
Stanford all-time record and the
60' plateau. The Indian record is
59' 11U" by Jerry Winters in
1960. The freshman coach, Jess
Bova, believes "It is just a matter
of time until he's Stanford's firsl
60-foot shotputter."
Bova also says, "He's the type
of athlete that likes to work. He
doesn't like l to be defeated."
Bruce's actions bear this out. He
engages in an extensive weight
lifting program in which he bench
presses over 400 pounds and does
squats with 800 pounds on his
shoulders. He has pressed 305 lbs. i
With great physical potential, it j
is only a matter of technique and J
attitude until Bruce is one of the
top shot putters around. When
pinned down, neither of the j
coaches, Jordan or Bova. would !
put a limit on Wilhelm. They
agreed that the only limit will be '
the one he puts on himself.

where he generally throws the
platter 151 feet. One of his few
defeats in this event was suffered
at the hand of former Stanford
student and NCAA champion
Dave Weill.
As can he imagined, track fans
talk of Bruce Wilhelm and Indian
shot put ting records in the same
breath. Jack Chappie's two-year
old mark of 54' 5" gasped its last
sigh as a freshman record in Wil
heim's second outing. In its new
form the record reads "Bruce Wil
helm 56' 2". Th is puts hi m
fourth on the Stanford all-time
shot put ling list, only 2 inches he
hind the number three man, Steve
Arch.
Bruce was the number one
Stanford shotputter and the num
ber two freshman shotputter in
the nation this year. Randy Mat
son was the only frosh ahead of
him.
His next goal though is the
Stanford all-time record and the
60' plateau. The Indian record is
59' 11U" by Jerry Winters in
1960. The freshman coach, Jess
Bova, believes "It is just a matter
of time until he's Stanford's firsl
60-foot shotputter."
Bova also says, "He's the type
of athlete that likes to work. He
doesn't like l to be defeated."
Bruce's actions bear this out. He
engages in an extensive weight
lifting program in which he bench
presses over 400 pounds and does
squats with 800 pounds on his
shoulders. He has pressed 305 lbs. i
With great physical potential, it j
is only a matter of technique and J
attitude until Bruce is one of the
top shot putters around. When
pinned down, neither of the j
coaches, Jordan or Bova. would !
put a limit on Wilhelm. They
agreed that the only limit will be '
the one he puts on himself.


BRUCE WILHELM
Top Freshman of Year
From Parry O'Brien to Dallas
Long lo Don Castle, the Univer
sity of Southern California has
year after year come up with the
I big man in AAWU weight events.
TIIK DAII.Y'S Freshman Ath
lete of the Year, Bruce Wilhelm,
plans to change all that, and Stan
ford track coach Payton Jordan
gives him a hearty second. At (i-2
and 240 lbs. Bruce has the si/.e to
j do it, and according to Jordan he
I has the dedication to go along
with his physical stature.
DURING the past track sea
, son Wilhelm was undefeated in
nine dual meets and regularly
beat both freshmen and varsity
competitors. This plus the fact
that Bruce is still a growing boy
with much unused potential is
enough to put live meet points in
any coach's eyes.
Even before this season an opti
mistic attitude would be justifi
able in view of Wilhelm's high
school credentials. As a senior at
! nearby Fremont High School in
Sunnyvale, Wilhelm took first
place in the shot and second in
! the discus to bo one of the top
; point getters at ihe annual high
school state meet. He was also

the state wrestling champ in the
unlimited division.
Wilhelm tossed the 12-pound
ball 65' 6" and spun the discus
177' 8 1 2'' as a prop. Naturally
there was a huge drop in footage
when Wilhelm stepped up to the
16-pound shot, but the coaches
weren't worried as Wilhelm im
proved with almost every outing.
As Coach Jordan says,"He has
dedication and competitiveness,
and you don't dare put a limit on |
him."
His first meet as an Indian saw |
him pin the shot 53' 4V. Some
of his other efforts, in chronologi
cal order, were 54' 6", 55' 1", 55'
6'l'", 55' 55' 7", and 56' 2".
Several times in practice he has
had puts measured at well over
56 feet.
In order to warm up for the
shot Wilhelm usually takes one
or two turns in the discus arena
where he generally throws the
platter 151 feet. One of his few
