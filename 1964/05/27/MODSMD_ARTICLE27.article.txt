### PETER EAKLAND 
Stanford's intercollegiate teams had great potential this year
luit only on rare oeeasions did they produce the outstanding per
formances necessary for victory in crucial contests. In general, the
bright spots in the campaigns of the major sports were few and far
between and ii was the forgotten minor sports which improved most
upon pre season expectations.
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor remarked he's not satisfied with
this year's results. He however, points with pride to the rejuvena
tion in tile lesser sports. Wrestling and gymnastics had their best
seasons ever. Soccer was lops in the West, and water polo won the
national championship.
Team performances were often inconsistent, but several stars in
each sport were consistently outstanding. The S>ad> in its annual
selection of Stanford's top athlete, has picked Tom Dose, last year's
recipient, as a repeat winner.
HOSE, during his four-year career on the basketball aoiiri. com
pletely rewrote Stanford's record book and vaulted Stanford into
national promiunnce in basketball for the first time in many years.
Last year as a junior, Dose became the first Stanford basketball
player to average 20 points or more I'or a season. Me finished the
season with 520 points, also a record.
This season, although hampered by knee injuries, Dos;- again
reached the 20 point mark in scoring. His greatest game was ag linst
an undermanned Washington State team in the Pavilion in the last
week of the season He connected on hooks, tip-ins, and jump shots
and compiled 42 points to set a new Pavilion scoring record and an
AAWU single game scoring record,
11 is varsity total of 1,111 surpasses Ron Tomsic's previous mark
and his four-year total of 1,744 elipses Hank Luisetti's. The only
scoring record Dose does not own is the single game scoring record
of 50 points still held by Luisetti.
Tlil-: A('( OI.AKKS Dose has received have not been confined to

breaking Stanford records. Twice, he was named to the Helms All-
American team as one of the top six centers in the country. Recently,
the AAU picked him to play in Russia as a member of an American
All-Star team.
THIO DAII.Y also recognizes some outstanding performers in other
sport s.
In football, halfback Steve Thurlow. the converted quarterback,
led the team in rushing and developed the run-pass option into a

a dangerous weapon as the sea
son progressed.
Man Harris, whom Coach Ral
ston employed exclusively on de
fense, led the team in tackles by
a wide margin. His value largely
went unnoticed during the regu
lar season, but he was selected to
the All-Coasi team and later be

came the players' choice for cap
tain in the East-West Shrine
game.
AQUATICS specialist Marty
Hull led both the water polo and
swimming squads to fine seasons.
He led the poloists in scoring and
competed in the butterfly, breast
stroke, and freestyle sprints in

swimming.
A good track team finished with
a mediocre season, co-captain
Steve Cortwright running on a
muscle strain all year provided
points in three events consist
ently, but the outstanding track
men award goes to distance man
Paul Schlicke, who improved con

siderably oxer the season and
never lost his poise in tough
races. Pole van Iter Chuck Smith,
who upped his school record to
15' 4", last week, also showed
much improvement.
KOH TIIE baseball team, 1901
was a building year. The hitting
of soph catcher Jim Hibbs was

the highlight of the season.
Rugby lost bul one game this
season, and leading the point
getters for the second straight
year was Scotland's Gordon Wad
dell, who tallied 104 points. A
rugger of long experience, he ex
cells in kicking, passing, and run-
