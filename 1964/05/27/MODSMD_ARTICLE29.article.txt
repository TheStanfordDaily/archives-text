# Stanford On The Edge Of Greatness: Seeds Of Sound And Fury Sown
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing 1 is an editorial discussion
of the problem of intra-univer
sity relations at Stanford. It is
based oil a series of interviews
with members of the faculty,
administration, ami stud e 111
body.

The seeds of sound and fury
which have been scattered across
this academic community for tin 1
past few years take root in a sim
ple problem of semantics: Who
or what constitutes The Univer
sity?
In a letter to The Daily on
March former ASSU President
Armin Rosencranz set forth t he
definition which has informed a
two-year, self-styled revolution of
the articulate few: "The Univer
sity is the student body and the
faculty. Ii is served by Trustees,
a President, various officers and
bureaucrats. While some of these
officers may occasionally disserve
the university, they should never
lie thought to personify it."
The dominant opinion - appar
ently held by most of (he adminis
tration and some faculty and stu
dents is more a tacit assump
tion than a conscious definition.
In this scheme, the "University"
becomes synonmous with the "In
stitution" an intangible entity,
existing historically, traditionally,
even mythically, finding its em
bodiment in the visible physical
plant and its force in the adminis
trative establishment. Students
and faculty come and go, but The
University endures forever.
IX PRACTICE, the philosophi
cal disparity is made manifest in
a subtle difference of emphasis.
The "administration" viewpoint
assumes The University is de
fined in a stable, inanimate
framework. The "activist" opin
ion concerns itself with The Uni
versity as a living continuum of
scholars, ideally volatile, neces
sarily unstable. The conflict of
essences is quite genuine.
In the past two or three years,
the clash between the administra
tion and the more vocal members
of the student body has become
embarrassingly public. Yet the
conflict has philosophical differ
ences. All issues have been sub
sumed within one hovering hob
goblin: Communication with a
capital "C."
The problem of "Communica
tion" seems to be that it doesn't
exist. One administrator romem
bered sadly, "I spent my whole
first year here looking for 'the
horse's mouth;' I never found it."
Students' comments move in the
same channel. One interviewee re
plied spontaneously, "The first
thing I thought of when you said
'intra-university relations' was
that we don't have any."
Till-; UNIVERSITY is large and
growing larger, complex an d
growing more complex. The la
mentation, "We used to have
much closer contact with stu
dents," is genuine, and inevitable,
grounded in changing circum
stances. Bui distance brings the
more insidious problem of stereo
typed thinking.
The assumed "problem" of Com
munication becomes a self-fulfill
ing prophecy. The presumption
that misunderstanding exists
makes understanding more diffi
cult to reach. Fear engenders dis
trust, leading at least one mem
ber of the administration to con
clude, paradoxically, that "one
root of the problem is the stu
dents' assumption of bad faith."
It is an admitted "occupational
hazard of a dean to be disliked."
Recently at Stanford, however,
this cross has become perceptibly
heavier. Staff members are vehe
ment in condemning what is often
termed the "personalization" of
an intellectual conflict.
Dean Winbigler enlarged upon
this concept in a lecture last No
vember: "In any struggle, we like
to have our ideas personified. It
is more convenient and comfort
able to do battle with people than
with ideas, just as it is more con
venient and comfortable to hate
people than to hate abstrations, to
hate even individual people rather
than groups of people or institu
tions, like government."
AS A THEORY of human na
ture, such a statement has more
than a slight ring of psychologi
cal truth. But as a working as
sumption, it may contribute to the
false emphasis which it seeks to
avoid, by opening up an escape
hatch through which the confron
tation of ideas can be conveni
ently and comfortably avoided.
Student leaders have charged
that, "One of the realities of life
at Stanford is that many of the
people in decision-making posi
lions are not amenable to listen
ing to students articulate t heir
viewpoint "

IN TURN, some of those "people
in decision-making positions" have
stressed that they are, indeed,
amenable to listening to the stu
dent viewpoint, but that "students
don't want just a voice; what they
really want to do is make the
decisions, and when they don't get
their own way, they cry 'lack of
communication..'"
The underlying belief seems to
be: "Most of the time, students
resist authority merely to be re
sisting authority."
The dialogue continues thus:
"The student body has a chip on
its shoulder." "The administra
tion is closed minded, . . . bent on
thundering back into the Victor
ian Age." The "assumption of
bad faith" may be a myth, but it
carries the force of reality. In
practice, the "Problem of Com
munication" tends to resolve itself
in a fruitless questioning of mo
tives.
The anxiety of the administra
tion over the admitted fact that
there is less personal contact be
tween staff and students is par
tially grounded on the belief that
"sympathetic understanding and
counselling" will resolve all exist -
ing conflict.
This concern is often expressed
as a desire for a quasi-formal ex
pansion of undergraduate educa
tion to the realm of morals and
basic ethics, within the frame
work of a parent-child type rela
tionship.
THE ASSUMPTION of parental
responsibilities by some members
of the professional staff is overt
and manifests itself in such state
ments as, "I would like to save
the students from the conse
quences of their errors." The par
ental attitude often dubbed the
"in loco parentis doctrine" is,
quite naturally, resented by many
students who consider themselves
both adults and scholars.
Moreover, in recent years, a
number of faculty members have
joined the more articulate of stu
dents in what has been termed a
"hesitant coalition," united by a
common criticism of the "restric
tive" policies and "arbitrariness"
which is judged to emanate in
part from a sincere but "mis
guided" parental attitude on the
part of the administration.
From a common faculty vi e w
point, the problem is one of mis
placed emphasis. John Kenneth
Galbraith. in a letter to The Har
vard Crimson, reprinted in The
Daily last November, seems to
have summarized the attitude of
many students and faculty at
Stanford.
HE COMMENTED, "The respon
sibility of the University to its
students is to provide the best
teaching that can be associated
with the scientific, literary, ar
tistic or other scholarly preoccu
pations of the faculty. . . . Once
when Harvard College was in part
a privileged academy for the so
eially visible, il needed to assure
parents that their more retarded
offspring would have the supervi
sion of men of the scoutmaster
type who, however ineffectually,
would try to protect them from
the natural penalties of indolence,
alcohol or lust. Otherwise, needed
and prestigious clients would be
committed to other institutions.
"All this, happily, is now over.
Thousands of men and women
clamour for admission for th e
serious purposes of the univer
sity. It can be part of our bargain
that they look after themselves.
. . . No effort need be made or
should he made to protect individ
uals from the consequences of
their own errors, indiscretions, or
passion."
A similar concern was voiced
by a Stanford faculty member
who interpreted the recent stu
dent-administration clash as a
effort to gain recognition for the
student right to "academic free
dom."
UK CONCLUDED, "I would like
to see the University shake itself
loose from this (parental) notion
and constitute itself again as a
community of scholars scholars
of differing levels of preparation,
but essentially engaged in the
same kind of activity.
It is generally admitted by ad
ministration, faculty, and stu
dents themselves, that in the past
decade the character of the Stan
ford student body has changed
markedly. Students are smarter
and "more willing to stick their
necks out more willing to grub
around and grapple with intellec
tual ideas."
To some students and faculty,
the tensions existing at Stanford
today are the function of a double
standard the administration's
tenuous assumption that the criti
cal qualities of mind emphasized
in academic matters will somehow
cease to operate outside the class
room

TRADITIONALLY, the intellec
| tual acts as the critic of society,
land certainly many of the recent
student protests partake of this
j tradition. The problem seems to
j be that while students are making
new demands on the University,
| the University the administra
! tors are reacting to those de
' mands in old ways, or not react
| ing at all.
One staff member commented,
"Some people (in the administra
i tion) are afraid of things get I ing
j out of hand, and they react in
j ways used for years and years.
I . . . But they are using the tech
! niques of a decade back on a stu
dent population that has changed
i a great deal in that decade, and
| they justify their reaction with
the fallacy that it's 'just a phase'
that they're (the students) going
i through."
Both faculty and administration
generally agree that the changes
which Stanford is experiencing
are part of a nationwide phenome
non. Moreover, as one faculty
member commented. "The admin
istration is charged to take the
long view. ... So they usually
play a waiting game, reacting
i somewhat negatively."
According to one staff source,
j the alleged "negative" reaction by
j the administration was made in
evitably by misguided student pro
tests and a record of irresponsibil
ity,
"WHAT CONCERNS us is the
tendancy for students to with
j draw from responsibility and
| leave a vacuum and then expect
' nothing to happen. . . . When
j there's a vacuum we have to move
i in and this leads to unfortunate
S codification."
The question of responsibility
!or irresponsibility rests on the
I definition of a "vacuum" and at
i Stanford involves a conflict as to
the degree and nature of control
necessary in an academic com
munity. In this context, some ad
ministrators noted that il was
; ironic that in the past two years,
j the fight against restriction has
I resulted in even greater restric
tion.
IT WAS SUGGESTED that,
"from the students' point of view,
| it would seem wise to have a little
; less fury and a little more stra
tegy Allegedly, it was student
"fury," in the form of appeals to
i the courts and the ACLU that re
! suited in the board of trustees
{ declaration of a legal stand in tiie
| phrase, "attendance at the univer
sity is a privilege and not a right."
The extent of the irony, how
| ever, depends on the essential mo
tivation of the students who have
been making most of the noise in
I the past few years. To most, the
j initial target of their protests has
not been restrictions per se but
rather the possibility and pattern
! of arbitrary action.
MANY MEMBERS of the ad
ministration, who by no means
consider themselves arbitrary,
j maintain that codification denies
the human factor and prevents
the administration from exercis
-1 ing its essential function of "mak
ing exceptions to the rules and
regulations."
j Most students actively concerned
with the problems of The Univer
sity essentially agree, but I hey
i regard codification as merely an
unfortunate half-way house to
| genuine reform.
"You can't fight arbitrariness;
j it's too nebulous. ... If we've
j forced the administration to de
finition and codification it's so
that we'd know where we stood
j and could have something con
crete with which to grapple."
In the minds of many student
leaders, arbitrariness is at once
I a direct function of an unneces-
I sarily paternal attitude on the
part of the administration and a
i denial of the esssential academic
nature of The University.
STUDENTS TOO fear a vac
uum the lack of a coherent phi
losophy of education at the top
of the administrative structure.
They ask the question, "Where is
! leadership?" and are forced to
I conclude it is nowhere if not in
i themselves.
The administration seems to
agree that "times are changing,"
but prefers to wait to sec where
i the change is leading, pointing
J out that "you can't do everything
in four years." But, of course, the
; students only have four years.
MEMBERS OF BOTH the ad
ministration and faculty ex
pressed "delight" at student "re
j bclliousness," calling it a sign of
the University's greater health,
j The trouble with the attitude of
j "delight," it seems, is that it may
j act to mask the validity of this
ior that specific student claim,
i The danger in recognizing that
Stanford's problems may be pari
of a national phenomenon is that
; the local character of some contro
versies may he < lighted

The attitude of the faculty is
crucial, yet the faculty remains
largely, perhaps necessarily, in
different to the cries of the vocal
few. "Frankly, I don't take stu
dent government seriously at all;
I'm sorry but I don't." the atii
tude is common, maybe justified.
In some ways, il is true that "stu
dents make demands on profes
sors that they can't possibly ful
fill."
Time as well as concern is
essential. Yet, according to some
professors, the faculty can and
should act as mediators between
the other two-thirds of the Uni
versity's t r ip a r t i Ie structure:
"Compatablc with time, if the fac
ulty acted on the presumption that
students are not .just students,
but persons as well, and vice
versa, then maybe some of this
hanky-panky around the deans'
offices wouldn't be necessary."
ONE MEMBER of the staff
who called himself an "observer
from a distance" felt that there
exists a useful parallel between
Stanford's administration-student
relations and the relations of em
ployer to employees when the
labour unions first began to or
ganize.
The attitude of many employers
was one of sincere paternalism
a desire to act from wisdom in
the best interest of I lie employees.
And because the employers' ges
tures were well-intentioned, th ey
could not understand why their
men wanted to organize and in
fluence policy making decisions.
They became hurt and then they
became angry and then they acted
in a punative fashion.
The analogy may shed some
light on what appears to be a full
blown clash of conceptions, but
il offers few suggestions for reso
lution of lensions except to sug
gest thai such resolution will be
slow in ci .r.i' g. and perhaps pur
chased ai a significant price.
Initially, what is needed is
some coherent definition of 1 he
problem, and within the complex
ity of Stanford's structure that
effort is tantamount to "beating
your head against a sponge rub
ber wall."
