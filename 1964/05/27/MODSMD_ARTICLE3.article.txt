# More Money: Only Answer For T.A.'s?

A Roble freshman gripes: " . . .
if we have to pay $3000 a year to
study at Stanford, we should have
real professors as our teachers."
Stanford presently employs 375
part-time teaching assistants.
Standards for selection vary ac
cordingly to the department. The
English department hires only
second or third-year graduate
students, while the Biology de
partment often offers teaching
assistant ships to incoming first
year grad students.
PROFESSOR Bacon of the
Math department states that "it
would he dangerous to set any
arbitrary requirements for math
T.A.'s. Some of them are better
than we arc."
All departments cite grades as
tho main criteria for selection.
TO GIVE T.A.'S a preview of
the subject matter and to reduce
the pressure of their first class
room experience, the English de
partment offers a 2-unit survey
course for all new appointees.
Most student dissatisfaction
with T.A.'s centers on their fail
ure to "come down to our level."
One Math 41 student explains:
"The T.A. just scribbled stuff on
the board . . . and said 'there it
is, it's up there'—and that was
it! It may have been up there
but it wasn't any good to us if
we couldn't decipher the scribble,
much less understand it ... "
A student in the Biology 1, 2, 3
series states that his T.A. "always
left the lab an hour early and told
us if we had any questions to go
sec the head of the department."
AWARE OF problems in th e
present T.A. system, department
members sec no practical solu
tion in the immediate future.
Prof. Grobstein would like to see
more use of young faculty mem
bers and other more experienced
instructors rather than T.A.'s in
Biology. But "it would cost a lot
more than students would like
to see their tuition raised . . . "
He suggests that employers of
Stanford graduates contribute to
the university which educated
them.
