## Mississippi Project Request 
### 
Kriitor, The Daily:
Three letters may determine
whether or not the Stanford stu
dents who work in Mississippi this
summer on the COFO Civil Rights
Project will remain alive and un
harmed while they are in thai
state, or are physically mutilated
or even killed by southern white
segregationists or police. These
letters will be written by the
Project participants, their families
and friends, and by members of
Ihe Stanford Community to t he
Justice Department, the Presi
dent, and to Senators from the
participants' home states and
from the state of California. Their
purpose is to convince Ihe Federal
Government that people in the
North are concerned about Ihe
welfare of the students who have
gone South If) work on education,
voter registration, and eommuity
development in Mississippi, and
demand that these students, as
well as all Negroes and whites in
Mississippi, be fully protected.
II is impossible to foresee, at
this moment, what the reaction
to the Civil Rights Project will
be on the pari of southern white
citizens; we know that Ihe power
structure of Mississippi is already
preparing to attempt to defeat the
Project's aims by passing laws
making much of the proposed ac
tivity 'illegal.' If widespread hard
core resistance to the Project de
velops, only a concerted effort by
the Justice Department can pro
tect the lives of the civil rights
workers.
The Civil Rights Secretarial
urges all members of the Stanford
Community to write immediately
the three letters 1 hat may make
a crucial difference this summer
in Mississippi. The very presence
of Justice Department officials in
the stale may act as a preventive
measure sufficient to ward off
any potential violence on the
part of southern whites.
Your cooperation in this endea
vor will be more than appreciated
by those of us who will be work
ing in Mississippi this summer.
