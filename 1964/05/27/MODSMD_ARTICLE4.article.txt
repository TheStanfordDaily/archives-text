# Murph, Wilbur's Mascot, Loves Civ And Theater
## 
### DIANE WILLIAMS 
The best-known resident of
Wilbur this year is a promising
actor who appeared in a recent
Winter One-Act and an avid West
tern Civ student.
His name is Murph probably
the only St. Bernard ever to be
come a part of the Stanford fam
ily. Already familiar to students
frequenting Wilbur. Branner, and
the eating clubs, Murph has been
enjoying increasing popularity on
campus since his arrival.
Ml'lil'll'S Stanford carror be
gan in October when an ad in the
Daily: "I am a St. Bernard look
ing for a home for the school
year. Call the following number
and ask for Murphy." One re
sponse to his plea came from Rev
erend John Tirrell, who later ar
ranged with Murphy's master,
Marty Nauer, to entrust Murph
to the care of the Arroyo boys
while his owner traveled during
the winter.
dree ted by Arroyo with a vigor
ous "We Love You, Murphy"
song. Murphy quickly adapted to
his now surroundings and soon
included several professor's wives
within his circle of friends. He
regularly attended Civ classes
held in the Arroyo lounge and
event went to a religious confer
ence once but lie had to be given
a hasty kick when he began
snoring.
Despite a few narrow escapes
from being taken to the dog
pound by campus police, the
saintly St. Bernard has caused the
boys to worry only once, when
he failed to appear for dinner one
evening. "We were rather sur
prised to find out later," said
Reverend Tirrell, "that Murph
had decided to walk the ten miles
home for a visit."
SHORTLY AFTLIi Christmas,
a crisis, threatened Murph's
status at Stanford. A letter from
a university office informed Rev
erend Tirrell Ilutt university pol
icy prohibited dogs from being in
a university dormitory or "in any
faculty resident therein." Al
though the Arroyo boys spend
some time pondering the meaning
of this last phrase, they dutifully
built Murph ;i doghouse; but now
Murph's ,ir idemif and mh i d

endeavors have been diminished
by a county regulation.which says
he must be kepi on a leash.
Rules and regulations, however,
do not hold Murph back. He re
cently made his theatrical debut
in the Ram's Head Winter One-
Act, "The Doctor In Spite of Him
self." Murph greeted the audience
opening night with a huge yawn,
and according to the lead Paul
Robinson, Murph "got a laugh
every time he walked across the
stage."
PHIL KI.LIS reported that
Murph was a very cooperative
player and presented only on e
hazard: "When he decides to
shake himself, there's a spray of
saliva around him 1 I feet in every
direction."
As the official Arroyo mascot,
Murph requires a daily food ex
penditure of 75 cents a day, plus
scraps from the Wilber Food
Service. Four years old this
month, he has gained considerable
weight since he came to Wilbur,
currently weighing around 150
pounds.
