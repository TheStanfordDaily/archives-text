# Pavilion Displaces Rifle Club
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE 
The new athletic pavilion,
though welcomed by almost
everyone, may cause difficulties
for one very active campus or
ganization. These difficulties may
prove to be a blessing in disguise,
j however.
The Stanford Rifle and Pistol
Club will lose its firing range
which now stands on the future
site of the pavilion, but it is pos
sible that a new range may be
built to replace it.
SO FAR NO provisions have
I been made for another range but
university officials are optimistic
of the chances for one. Robert D.
Wilson, senior member of th e
Planning Office reported that
studies were underway and that
President Wallace Sterling was
| very interested in the new range.
I Presidential Executive Assistant
l Frederick Glover said. "1 am do
| ing my best to keep a rifle range
i at Stanford."
It had earlier been hoped that a
new range would be included in
i the basement of the new pavilion,
but this proved impractical, esti
mates of the added cost running
as high as $500,000.
The present range was built in
1917 and was first used as a
| stable for the horses of the ROTC
1 cavalry unit. When the unit was
disbanded after World War I.the
building was used to house the
horses of the Army polo team.
It was converted to a rifle range
in the 1930'5, and used by the
| ROTC for training purposes.
THE RANGE is currently main
i tained by the club, although it is
j directed by Staff Sergeant Car
| roll Hawkins, who is attached to
j the Army ROTC unit. The only
support from the university is
I through the athletic department
i in the form of a $500 contribution
leach year for the traveling ex
penses of the varsity rifle team.
The range'is sanctioned by the
National Rifle Association and is
' used by a number of local rifle
j clubs, as well as by the Stanford
; Army, Navy, and Air Force ROTC
i units.
The rifle club has increased
[greatly in size in the last six
i years, growing from a total enroll
| meni of 78 in 1958 to more than
101) students for the 1963-64 school
year.
THE COURSE in marksman
ship, P.E. 151. which may be tak
en in fulfillment of the General
| Studies activity requirement, is
: reportedly one of the most popu
lar courses in the P.E. depart
ment.
Senior members of the club in
struct many of these rifle classes.
Twenty-five students are certified
by the National Rifle Association
as instructors.
The club also has varsity rifle
teams for both boys and girls
which compete in regular matches
with nearby schools. Last year
Ihe girls team was third in the
nation in competition.

much of this success to Range Di

closely with the club during his
three years here. Sergeant Haw

year, The new range director will

Club will lose its firing range

It had earlier been hoped that a
new range would be included in

as high as $500,000.
The present range was built in
1917 and was first used as a

1 cavalry unit. When the unit was
disbanded after World War I.the
building was used to house the
horses of the Army polo team.
It was converted to a rifle range
in the 1930'5, and used by the
| ROTC for training purposes.
THE RANGE is currently main
i tained by the club, although it is
j directed by Staff Sergeant Car

j the Army ROTC unit. The only
support from the university is
I through the athletic department
i in the form of a $500 contribution
leach year for the traveling ex
penses of the varsity rifle team.

National Rifle Association and is
