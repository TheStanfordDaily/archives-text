# Operation Mississippi To Enter State Politics
## COFO Plans To Unseat Mississippi Delegation To Democratic Convention 
### VIVIAN BOZMAN Feature Editor 
Forty Stanford students have been selected for the Mississippi
Summer Project, the Civil Rights Secretariat announced yesterday.
Stanford ranks first nationally in the number of volunteers.
The focus of the political program of COFO, (the Council of
Federated Organizations, composed of all civil rights groups in

Mississippi, in its summer "Oper-"
ation Mississippi" will be an at
tempt to unseat the regular Mis
sissippi delegation to the National
Democratic Convention in August
of this year.
The Civil Rights Secretariat at
Stanford, headed by Ilene Strelitz,
serves as West Coast Coordinator
of "Operation Mississippi" for
COFO.
The basis for COFO's challenge
to the regular Mississippi Demo
cratic Party will be the charge
that this party does not truly rep
resent the people of Mississippi,
because it denies Negroes their j
equal right to participate in the j
party and in state political affairs.:
FAC TS SUPPORTING COFO's j
charges include the fact that the;
state legislature, controlled by >
Democratic Party, has "consis-1
tently passed laws and set regis- i
tration standards which exclude j
Negroes from the registration
books."
COFO also charges that "Mis
sissippi citizens who are in sym
pathy with the goals, platform,
and national candidates of the Na
tional Democratic Party cannot
support these goals, platform and
candidates by becoming a part of
the Mississippi Democratic
Party."
THE MISSISSIPPI Democratic
Party platform is allegedly in di
rect opposition to that of the na
tional party.
The Mississippi Democratic 1
Party did not support its party's ,
presidential ticket in 1960.
A special Freedom Registration I
program, based on voting regis-!
tration methods in several north-1
ern states, will require only that j
the applicant be over 21 and a ,
resident of the state. No literacy i
test or questions on the meaning
of specific passages in the state 1
constitution will be required.
OTHER PROGRAM areas in
"Operation Mississippi" include
Freedom Schools, designed to
provide intensive academic in- i
struction to students and awaken â– 
them to the political life of their
communities, showing them how j
they can help to bring about I
change.
Community Centers will pro
vide both cultural and recreation- !
al programs in an attempt to ere- |
ate a sense of community and a
new awareness of the world be- !
yond the pressing problems of j
economic subsi ste n ce.
COFO workers and Freedom
School students will participate j
in voter registration projects, i
serving the dual function of
stimulating political awareness
among the students and commu
nity members and of giving;
Negroes the opportunity to exer
cise their right to vote.
