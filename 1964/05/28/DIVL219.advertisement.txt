BELIEVING IS SEEING
We Americans want to see tlic proof before we'll believe. However,
everything we do is based on some brand of faith or trust. We don't
sit down unless we have faith that the chair will support lis, nor do
we eat It inch without trusting that it isn't poison. What we believe is
very important when it comes to God, for believing is seeing, that is,
we do not see unless we first are willing to believe.
"But without faith it is impossible to please God; for he that cometh
to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
diligently seek him." (Heb. 11:6).
"For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast
about, not before God. For what does the Scripture say? 'And Abra
ham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.' "
(Romans 4:3).
Christian faith is not blind faith because God has revealed His instruc
tions in the Bible, and if we follow the Word of God and the guidance
of the Holy Spirit (God dwelling in us), we do see His presence and
power in our lives. Jesus said: "He that hath my commandments and
kecpeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be
loved of inv Father and 1 will love him, and will manifest mvself to
him." (John 14:21 ).
The only condition God imposes upon man in order to become a Chris
tian is "Believing in Jesus Christ." This fact is brought out at least 150
times in the New Testament. While repentance, baptism, and good
works are closely associated with the Christian life, they are in no way
prerequisites to becoming a Christian.
"For by grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves,
it is the <jift of God, not of works, lest any man shnold boast." (Eph.
2:8,9).
"But what does it mean to believe in Jesus Christ"? The Amplified New
Testment, a valuable translation front the Greek, points out the mean
ing of the word "believe" as the Bible uses it.
"Let us take the sentence, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
shalt be saved.' (Acts 16:31). What does the word 'believe* mean? It
is extremely important for multitudes are pinning their hopes of heaven
upon it. Yet that word long since ceased to convey, if it ever did, the
sense of the original. Webster's long definition of 'believe' includes
such synonymous expressions as 'to place credence . . . apart from
personal knowledge; to expect or hope ... to be more or less firmly
persuaded of the truth of anything, to think or suppose.' In this sense
most people believe in Christ—that He lived; that He was a perfect
man Who sincerely believed Himself to the the Son of God, and that
He died on the cross hoping to have sinners. But this is by no means
the meaning of the Greek word which twenty-two New Testment ver
sions out of twenty-four consulted render 'believe.' Yet they do so
because there is no single better word in the English. The Greek word
is "pisteuo" and means "to adhere to, to trust, to have faith in, to rely
on—which summed up in 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
shalt he saved,' means an absolute personal reliance upon the Lord
Jesus Christ as Saviour."
(Introduction to the Amplified New Testment, Loekman Foundation,
1958).
Probably you believe that Abraham Lincoln really lived and was presi
dent of our nation. The historical evidence that Jesus Christ really lived
is equally convincing. But the important question is—do you know Him
personally? Those who do, all agree with one another and with the
Bible that He is God. This is the whole point of the Christian message.
"Jesus replied, I am the Bread ol Life. He who comes to me will never
be hungry and he who believes on and cleaves to and trusts in and
relics on me will never thirst anymore—at any time. But as 1 told you,
although you have seen me, still you do not believe and trust and nave
faith. All whom my father has given to me will come to me; and him
who comes to me I will most certainly not cast out—I will never, no
never reject one of them who comes to me. For 1 have come down
from heaven, not to do my own will and purpose; but to do the will
and purpose of Him who sent me. And this is the will of Him Who
sent Me, that 1 should not lose any of all that lie has given Mr; but
that I should give new life and raise up at the last day. For this is my
Father's will and His purpose, that everyone who sees the Son and
believes and cleaves to and trusts and relies on Him should have
eternal life, and 1 will raise him up from the dead at the last day. . . .
I assure you, 1 most solemnly tell you, he who believes in Me—who
adheres to, trusts in, relies on and has faith in Me—now possesses
eternal life." (John 6:35-40, 17).

is extremely important for multitudes are pinning their hopes of heaven
upon it. Yet that word long since ceased to convey, if it ever did, the
sense of the original. Webster's long definition of 'believe' includes
such synonymous expressions as 'to place credence . . . apart from
personal knowledge; to expect or hope ... to be more or less firmly
persuaded of the truth of anything, to think or suppose.' In this sense
most people believe in Christ—that He lived; that He was a perfect
man Who sincerely believed Himself to the the Son of God, and that
He died on the cross hoping to have sinners. But this is by no means
the meaning of the Greek word which twenty-two New Testment ver
sions out of twenty-four consulted render 'believe.' Yet they do so
because there is no single better word in the English. The Greek word
is "pisteuo" and means "to adhere to, to trust, to have faith in, to rely
on—which summed up in 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
shalt he saved,' means an absolute personal reliance upon the Lord
Jesus Christ as Saviour."

1958).
Probably you believe that Abraham Lincoln really lived and was presi
dent of our nation. The historical evidence that Jesus Christ really lived
is equally convincing. But the important question is—do you know Him
personally? Those who do, all agree with one another and with the
Bible that He is God. This is the whole point of the Christian message.
"Jesus replied, I am the Bread ol Life. He who comes to me will never
be hungry and he who believes on and cleaves to and trusts in and
relics on me will never thirst anymore—at any time. But as 1 told you,
although you have seen me, still you do not believe and trust and nave
faith. All whom my father has given to me will come to me; and him
who comes to me I will most certainly not cast out—I will never, no
never reject one of them who comes to me. For 1 have come down
from heaven, not to do my own will and purpose; but to do the will
and purpose of Him who sent me. And this is the will of Him Who
sent Me, that 1 should not lose any of all that lie has given Mr; but
that I should give new life and raise up at the last day. For this is my
Father's will and His purpose, that everyone who sees the Son and
believes and cleaves to and trusts and relies on Him should have
eternal life, and 1 will raise him up from the dead at the last day. . . .
I assure you, 1 most solemnly tell you, he who believes in Me—who
adheres to, trusts in, relies on and has faith in Me—now possesses
eternal life." (John 6:35-40, 17).

BELIEVING IS SEEING
We Americans want to see tlic proof before we'll believe. However,
everything we do is based on some brand of faith or trust. We don't
sit down unless we have faith that the chair will support lis, nor do
we eat It inch without trusting that it isn't poison. What we believe is
very important when it comes to God, for believing is seeing, that is,
we do not see unless we first are willing to believe.
"But without faith it is impossible to please God; for he that cometh
to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
diligently seek him." (Heb. 11:6).
"For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast
about, not before God. For what does the Scripture say? 'And Abra
ham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.' "
(Romans 4:3).
Christian faith is not blind faith because God has revealed His instruc
tions in the Bible, and if we follow the Word of God and the guidance
of the Holy Spirit (God dwelling in us), we do see His presence and
power in our lives. Jesus said: "He that hath my commandments and
kecpeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be
loved of inv Father and 1 will love him, and will manifest mvself to
him." (John 14:21 ).
The only condition God imposes upon man in order to become a Chris
tian is "Believing in Jesus Christ." This fact is brought out at least 150
times in the New Testament. While repentance, baptism, and good
works are closely associated with the Christian life, they are in no way
prerequisites to becoming a Christian.
"For by grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves,
it is the <jift of God, not of works, lest any man shnold boast." (Eph.
2:8,9).

sent Me, that 1 should not lose any of all that lie has given Mr; but
that I should give new life and raise up at the last day. For this is my
Father's will and His purpose, that everyone who sees the Son and
believes and cleaves to and trusts and relies on Him should have
eternal life, and 1 will raise him up from the dead at the last day. . . .
I assure you, 1 most solemnly tell you, he who believes in Me—who
adheres to, trusts in, relies on and has faith in Me—now possesses
eternal life." (John 6:35-40, 17).

BELIEVING IS SEEING
We Americans want to see tlic proof before we'll believe. However,
everything we do is based on some brand of faith or trust. We don't
sit down unless we have faith that the chair will support lis, nor do
we eat It inch without trusting that it isn't poison. What we believe is
very important when it comes to God, for believing is seeing, that is,
we do not see unless we first are willing to believe.
"But without faith it is impossible to please God; for he that cometh
to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that
diligently seek him." (Heb. 11:6).
"For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast
about, not before God. For what does the Scripture say? 'And Abra
ham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.' "
(Romans 4:3).
Christian faith is not blind faith because God has revealed His instruc
tions in the Bible, and if we follow the Word of God and the guidance
of the Holy Spirit (God dwelling in us), we do see His presence and
power in our lives. Jesus said: "He that hath my commandments and
kecpeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be
loved of inv Father and 1 will love him, and will manifest mvself to
him." (John 14:21 ).
The only condition God imposes upon man in order to become a Chris
tian is "Believing in Jesus Christ." This fact is brought out at least 150
times in the New Testament. While repentance, baptism, and good
works are closely associated with the Christian life, they are in no way
prerequisites to becoming a Christian.
"For by grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves,
it is the <jift of God, not of works, lest any man shnold boast." (Eph.
2:8,9).
"But what does it mean to believe in Jesus Christ"? The Amplified New
Testment, a valuable translation front the Greek, points out the mean
ing of the word "believe" as the Bible uses it.
"Let us take the sentence, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
shalt be saved.' (Acts 16:31). What does the word 'believe* mean? It
is extremely important for multitudes are pinning their hopes of heaven
upon it. Yet that word long since ceased to convey, if it ever did, the
sense of the original. Webster's long definition of 'believe' includes
such synonymous expressions as 'to place credence . . . apart from
personal knowledge; to expect or hope ... to be more or less firmly
persuaded of the truth of anything, to think or suppose.' In this sense
most people believe in Christ—that He lived; that He was a perfect
man Who sincerely believed Himself to the the Son of God, and that
He died on the cross hoping to have sinners. But this is by no means
the meaning of the Greek word which twenty-two New Testment ver
sions out of twenty-four consulted render 'believe.' Yet they do so
because there is no single better word in the English. The Greek word
is "pisteuo" and means "to adhere to, to trust, to have faith in, to rely
on—which summed up in 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou
shalt he saved,' means an absolute personal reliance upon the Lord
Jesus Christ as Saviour."
(Introduction to the Amplified New Testment, Loekman Foundation,
1958).
Probably you believe that Abraham Lincoln really lived and was presi
dent of our nation. The historical evidence that Jesus Christ really lived
is equally convincing. But the important question is—do you know Him
personally? Those who do, all agree with one another and with the
Bible that He is God. This is the whole point of the Christian message.
"Jesus replied, I am the Bread ol Life. He who comes to me will never
be hungry and he who believes on and cleaves to and trusts in and
relics on me will never thirst anymore—at any time. But as 1 told you,
although you have seen me, still you do not believe and trust and nave
faith. All whom my father has given to me will come to me; and him
who comes to me I will most certainly not cast out—I will never, no
never reject one of them who comes to me. For 1 have come down
from heaven, not to do my own will and purpose; but to do the will
and purpose of Him who sent me. And this is the will of Him Who
sent Me, that 1 should not lose any of all that lie has given Mr; but
that I should give new life and raise up at the last day. For this is my
Father's will and His purpose, that everyone who sees the Son and
believes and cleaves to and trusts and relies on Him should have
eternal life, and 1 will raise him up from the dead at the last day. . . .
I assure you, 1 most solemnly tell you, he who believes in Me—who
adheres to, trusts in, relies on and has faith in Me—now possesses
eternal life." (John 6:35-40, 17).
