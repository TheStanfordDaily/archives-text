According to an ancient writer (Ps. 14) "THERE IS NO GOD" —
is the imagination of a "fool.
According to a modern writer:— An appalling fog of intellec
tual error darkens the lives of so many who form their opinions
at second hand. . . . The word GOD' is personal. To posit a
God is to assert that the first principle behind the created order
is not inferior to the products of that order, of which man is
one. . . . (Harry Blcimires, pp. 73-4 of "The Faith and Mod
ern Doubts ).
