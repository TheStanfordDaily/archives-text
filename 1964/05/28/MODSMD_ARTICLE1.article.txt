• Death Of A Statesman
NEW DELHI, India — Prime Minister Ja
waharlal Nehru, a quick tempered aristocrat
known to the world as "Mr. India," died of a
heart attack yesterday and left this grief
stricken nation in a leadership vacuum. He
was 74.
The senior member of Nehru's Cabinet,
Home Minister Gulzari Lai Nanda, was quickly
sworn in as acting prime minister and all his
ministerial colleagues agreed to stay on in a
caretaker government. But the transition
smooth as it was left unanswered the ques
tion: "After Nehru, who?"
That question, asked for years but never
answered by Nehru will be resolved conclu -
sively only when the ruling Congress party
picks a man to succeed Nehru.
The party's choice will be asked by Presi
dent Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan to form a per
manent government.

Handicapped since Jan. 7 by a paralytic
stroke, Nehru had refused to say who he be
lieved should succeed him.
Nehru was the idol of India's hungry mil
lions and a leader of the world's nonaligned,
the neutralists.
Indians wept at the loss of the man who
had run India throughout its 17 years of inde
pendence. Expressions of mourning poured in
from statesmen abroad.
Members of Parliament sobbed at the an
nouncement by Steel Minister C. Subrahan
iam: "The prime minister is no more. Life is
out. The light is out."
