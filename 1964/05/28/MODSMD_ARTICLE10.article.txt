# 'Mississippi—A Hellhole'
## 
### BILL LIGHT 
KIMTOR'S NOTK: Tile following observations
and opinions are compiled from a letter written
l»y Hill Light to his friends at Stanford. Light
is one of tlie Stanford students presently work
ilig fill I time for COKO in Jackson, Mississippi.

People hero in Mississippi are, as a rule, very
friendly (within racial boundaries, of coursei. ll
is the general rule to exchange greetings with
strangers walking down the street. This custom
also applies, as far as I am concerned, with Ne
groes who know what I do for a living. It does
not apply with those whites who know.
Beyond its beautiful countryside and limited
friendliness Mississippi is a hellhole. Racial segre
gation is complete and effective. The whites with
whom I have had contact here make it perfectly
obvious to me that they want nothing of the Negro
community. Yet they think that they know every
thing there is to know about Negroes.
In a similar way the northern white population
is ignorant of the real character of segregation.
It is much more than a set of customs or a set of
laws. It is a feeling in the air and it is impossible
not to be aware of it. It extends to houses, restau
rants, stores, toilets, sinks, drinking fountains,
hospitals, barbershops, entertainment places, pub
lic events, courtrooms, jails and cemetarics.
As a white living in the Ne<To community, I

feel no resentment or disrespect. Segregation is
desired only by the whites in Mississippi. The
Negro community has an air of intimacy and re
sponsibility.
Although the majority of Negroes arc afraid
lo act, I would venture to say there isn't one who
accepts the system as it is.
Mississippi is a police state. Mayor Allen
Thompson brags that "Jackson has the largest per
capita police force in the nation." ll is equipped
with machine guns, sawed off shotguns, and con
centration camp compounds. There is even a spe
cially-built armored truck that holds ten men and
an arsenal and is called "Thompson's tank."
Within the last two weeks twenty-five people
working for COFO ba\t; been arrested. All the
arrests were unfair or completely false and illegal.
At least four people ha\e been convicted and pun
ished without trial. The list of beatings and bru
talities is almost endless.
The Mississippi legislature has outlawed pic
keting. leaflet distribution. Inciting boycott and
teaching any subject (including health and hy
giene» without a license. All this is in preparation
for the upcoming Summer Project.
There is a motto on the wall in the COFO office:
"There is a place in Mississippi called Liberty;
there is a department in Washington called Jus
tier."
