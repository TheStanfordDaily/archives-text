### JOE ROSENBLOOM 
A major reshuffling within the
office of the dean of men will
take place next year, Robert Gor
don, dean of men, announced
yesterday.
Among those affected will be
Dwight Clark, present dean of
freshman men. and John Moore,
current director of Stern Hall.
Each will vacate his present po
sition to assume new duties in
tlie dean's office. Clark will be
come assistant dean of men while
Moore will be director of Stan
ford Village.
DEAN GORDON said, "In an
attempt to serve the needs of the
men students more effectively, 1
have designed this reorganiza
tion."
As part of the reorganization,
Clark's present office, which was
j created for him three years ago,
will lit* scrapped. Doug Davis, a
graduate of Stanford Law School
and a Wilbur sponsor in 19.17, has
j been named Clark's succesor; his
i title will be director of Wilbur
I Hall.
Gordon said about Davis's ap
point men!, "Students and staff
alike applaud this as a popular
i choice. 1 myself am real happy
j about it."
IN ACCEPTING their new
j posts, which are designed to be
"part-time," Clark and Moore
j hope to have more time to work
jtow a r d their doctorates. "As
much as I enjoy doing what I am
| doing now if 1 want to continue
in this sort of work, 1 need to
get my Ph. D.," John Moore said.
Clark had much the same to
say: "Essentially I plan to do
I what I have been trying to do
for three years, that is. to work
on a much neglected doctoral
I program."
According to Dean Gordon, the
new assistant dean will be re
sponsible for pre-registration,
freshman projects such as par
ents day and various other spe
cial projects.
"This will give him an oppor
tunity to make a continued sig
nificant contribution to Stan
ford." said Gordon, "I need him
very much in the office to carry
! out some of our plans."
