# U.S. AND VIETNAM
## Greater Commitment? 
### BILL SMITH Associate Editor 
Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara yesterday announced
that military forces in Viet Nam
have received a "top priority
blank check" for arms, manpower
and funds from Iho Pentagon to
help the South Vietnamese defeat
the Communist supported Viet
Cong.
To many observers this is
merely the first step 1o increase
American participation in the
Vietnamese war, and as such
could have important conse
quences for students of military
age, especially those about to
graduate.
IT IS THEN NECESSARY, per
haps to try to put iho whole pic
ture in focus.
The United States military units
now in Viet Nam are acting only
as "advisers" to the South Viet
namese military. These arrange
ments, according to Colonel David
Nanney, Commander of the Army
ROTC at Stanford, are typical of
those the United States has with
most of its treaty allies. U.S. ad
visers are provided at the re
quest of the allied government.
These arc approximately 15,000
"advisers" in Viet Nam at the
present time, and Secretary Me-
Namara's announcements press
ages some increased.
INCREASED American parti
cipation can take several forms.
First, it can result in U.S. troops
taking an "active" part in the
prosecution of ihe war. Such ac
tion would probably require some
official approval from the legisla
tive branch and is not now a
likely prospect. Greater U.S. par
ticipation may mean ihe addition
al use of "advisers," aided by

| troops and supplies from SEATO,
countries. Or some form of joint
UN-US action, a la Korea, could
be initiated to perserve Viet-;
nam's integrity.
Second, extension of the Amer
ican war effort can be achieved ,
along other lines than increased '
use of American personnel. More
economic aid to improve living â– 
conditions and give the Sout hi
Vietnamese a stake in his conn-:
try is seriously being considered.)
More weapons, explosives, ve- i
hides and aircraft are also being j
considered to that the Vietnamese
will be capable of handling the
Viet Cong themselves.
THIRD, IT has been suggested
j that the war be extended nto j
| North Vietnam, with attacks
aagainst supply lines and strong
holds of Ihe Viet Cong north of
the border. James Reston of the
Now York Times notes that such
a course might lead to a Sino-
I American war or to increased!
Communist pressure on other |
world trouble spots, Korea, Ber- j
lin, Quemoy, and Matsu, or to an
American-Soviet confrontation.
THESE THREE possible plans'
of action, along with a suggestion
by French President De Gaulle
that all of South East Asia be |
neutralized, have been discussed |

in Washington and in the press.
Plans recenlly submitted by Sec
retary McNamara to the National
Security Council, after his inspec
tion tour of Viet Nam, have been
approved. These plans call for in
creased U.S. economic aid and
additional military supplies. There
is no mention of increased Amer
ican troops involvement.
However, McNamara's an
nouncement yesterday indicates
some change in U.S. policy since
March. He notes increased arms,
funds and manpower will be
made available to the South Viet
namese government. It is appar
ently in response to ihe deterior
ating situation in Laos.
It is not now known what effeel
the new "blank check" policy will
have on American military per
sonnel. "The situation is quite
fluid," Colonel Nanney said, "and
I should not be too surprised at
anything that happened there."
