# TO CLOSE IN 1965
## Last Days Of The Village 
### JIM HORNE Managing Editor 
The days arc numbered lor
Stanford Village, home of more
than 10,000 students since it be
came a University housing facil
ity in 1946.
According to University Busi
ness Managing Dwight Adams,
the entire 85.64 acre plot in Menlo
Park will be turned over to Stan
ford Research Institute on June
30. 1965.
THE VILLAGE presently
houses 293 married students and
their families and about 130
single men.
Recently completed Escondido
Village can now provide for the
married couples, and construction
of an undergraduate men's dorm
between Florence Moore Hall and
the first fraternity cluster is ex
pected by September, 1965.
On-campus facilities have been
insufficient in recent years to ac
commodate the annual September
influx of graduate and transfer
students, and they are housed at
Stanford Village with the option
to move into Stern and Toyon
halls when space is available.
THE NEW dormitory a n d a
proposed cluster of four houses
with 65 students each will house
both transfer students and those
on Stern and Toyon Hall waiting
lists.
The University's critical need
for housing developed after World
War Two as thousands of vet
erans returned to the mainland
seeking an education. To help
meet this need, General Dibble
Army Hosptal, located to ihe East
of the SP Railroad tracks and
South of Ravenswood Avenue in
Menlo Park, was obtained by the
University in August, 1916, as a
part of ihe Federal Public Hous

ing Act. Situated three miles from
Quad, the Village was to he oc
cupied by Stanford "for two years
after the end of the war emer
gency."
THE AGREEMENT, however,
provided for an extension of the
period of occupation "it the need
for emergency housing still
exists."
This post war boom continued,
of course, and not until several
years ago did the University and
the government settle on June,
1965, as the date for moving out.
WAITING LISTS for the Vil
lage apartments have been long,
as tlie rent is less than half that
of other University married stu
dent housing. A one-bedroom
Stanford Village apartment rents
for $52 a month, compared with
$100 to $110 a month at Escon
dido.
Despite this difference Business
Manager Adams does not believe
that the closing of the Village
j will work hardships on those now
! living there.
"In the first place," says
Adams, "a number of the resi
dents will have graduated by
1965. Of those remaining, all are
fully aware of the impending clos
ure."
THK CLOSING of the Village
I will come exactly IS years to the
' day after the hospital facilities
! were acquired from the govern
| ment. The last patients from Dib
ble Hospital were discharged from
the service or transferred to other
army hospitals in mid-June, 1961.
More than 16,000 patients re
ceived treatment between its dedi
cation in March 1944, and when
it shut down 25 months later.
EARLY SPECULATIONS were
that the number of Village resi
dents would exceed 4,000, but
these estimates proved to be
somewhat liberal.
The peak was reached in 1947,
when 1419 single men, 111 co-eds,
and 339 married couples made the
Village their home.
At that time, and until recent
years, the Village was a city in
itself. It boasted a post office,
baby clinic, nursery school, bar
ber shop, haberdashery, laundry,
a bowling alley, and a cafeteria
which could feed 1300 persons a
meal.
STUDENTS could do their
shopping at a University operated
butcher shop and at a grocery
store which was run as a conces
sion and matched prices of com
peting merchants.
Other facilities included a gen
eral store, dry cleaners, soda
fountain, service station, infirm
ary, chapel, a guest house with
hotel accommodations and com
munity vegetable gardens.
As the years have passed, most
of these conveniences have dis
appeared, even though the num
ber of married students has de
j creased by only fifty.
TIIE NUMBER of single men
and women has also steadily de

creased since the Village opened.
Double rooms, formerly occu
pied by Army nurses, were avail
able to co-eds during the first few
years, but these became unneces
sary as campus residences were
constructed.
Before the post-war boom tailed
off, the 1400 single men were
housed in 2n residence halls, with
180 single rooms, 237 double
rooms, an <S4B multiple units.
SINGLE MEN'S residences at
the Village still can provide 200
economically minded students
with a private room at two-thirds
of the campus rate for a double
room.
Despite? the seeming finality of
the June 30, 1965 deadline, many
Vllagers feel that the University
is only "singing that same old
song again."
"THIS IS NOT the first time
we've been told we have only one
year left," said one Resident As
sistant.
But, according to Adams, who
has been closely associated with
the Village since he was appoint
ed Director of Village Business
Affars at its openng in 1946, this
is tiie Village's last year.
"The deadline wll simply not
be extended this time," declares
Adams.

The peak was reached in 1947,
when 1419 single men, 111 co-eds,

a bowling alley, and a cafeteria

itself. It boasted a post office,
baby clinic, nursery school, bar
ber shop, haberdashery, laundry,
a bowling alley, and a cafeteria
which could feed 1300 persons a
meal.
STUDENTS could do their
shopping at a University operated
butcher shop and at a grocery
store which was run as a conces
sion and matched prices of com
peting merchants.
Other facilities included a gen
eral store, dry cleaners, soda
fountain, service station, infirm
ary, chapel, a guest house with
hotel accommodations and com
munity vegetable gardens.
As the years have passed, most
of these conveniences have dis
appeared, even though the num
ber of married students has de
j creased by only fifty.
TIIE NUMBER of single men
and women has also steadily de

creased since the Village opened.
Double rooms, formerly occu
pied by Army nurses, were avail
able to co-eds during the first few
years, but these became unneces
sary as campus residences were
constructed.
Before the post-war boom tailed
off, the 1400 single men were
housed in 2n residence halls, with
180 single rooms, 237 double
rooms, an <S4B multiple units.
SINGLE MEN'S residences at
the Village still can provide 200
economically minded students
with a private room at two-thirds
of the campus rate for a double
room.
Despite? the seeming finality of
the June 30, 1965 deadline, many
Vllagers feel that the University
is only "singing that same old

"THIS IS NOT the first time

Adams.


FINAL YEAR—Stanford Village, University hous
ing since 1946, will be turned over to Stanford
Research Institute in June, 1965. More than 10,000
single and married students have lived in the

Village since Dibble General Hospital was ob
tained through the veterans housing act 18 years
ago.
The days arc numbered lor
Stanford Village, home of more
than 10,000 students since it be
came a University housing facil
ity in 1946.
According to University Busi
ness Managing Dwight Adams,
the entire 85.64 acre plot in Menlo
Park will be turned over to Stan
ford Research Institute on June
30. 1965.
THE VILLAGE presently
houses 293 married students and
their families and about 130
single men.
Recently completed Escondido
Village can now provide for the
married couples, and construction
of an undergraduate men's dorm
between Florence Moore Hall and
the first fraternity cluster is ex
pected by September, 1965.
On-campus facilities have been
insufficient in recent years to ac
commodate the annual September
influx of graduate and transfer
students, and they are housed at
Stanford Village with the option
to move into Stern and Toyon
halls when space is available.
THE NEW dormitory a n d a
proposed cluster of four houses
with 65 students each will house
both transfer students and those
on Stern and Toyon Hall waiting
lists.
The University's critical need
for housing developed after World
War Two as thousands of vet
erans returned to the mainland
seeking an education. To help
meet this need, General Dibble
Army Hosptal, located to ihe East
of the SP Railroad tracks and
South of Ravenswood Avenue in
Menlo Park, was obtained by the
University in August, 1916, as a
part of ihe Federal Public Hous

ing Act. Situated three miles from
Quad, the Village was to he oc
cupied by Stanford "for two years
after the end of the war emer
gency."
THE AGREEMENT, however,
provided for an extension of the
period of occupation "it the need
for emergency housing still
exists."
This post war boom continued,
of course, and not until several
years ago did the University and
the government settle on June,
1965, as the date for moving out.
WAITING LISTS for the Vil
lage apartments have been long,
as tlie rent is less than half that
of other University married stu
dent housing. A one-bedroom
Stanford Village apartment rents
for $52 a month, compared with
$100 to $110 a month at Escon
dido.
Despite this difference Business
Manager Adams does not believe
that the closing of the Village
j will work hardships on those now
! living there.
"In the first place," says
Adams, "a number of the resi
dents will have graduated by
1965. Of those remaining, all are
fully aware of the impending clos
ure."
THK CLOSING of the Village
I will come exactly IS years to the
' day after the hospital facilities

ble Hospital were discharged from
the service or transferred to other
army hospitals in mid-June, 1961.
More than 16,000 patients re
ceived treatment between its dedi
cation in March 1944, and when
it shut down 25 months later.
EARLY SPECULATIONS were
that the number of Village resi
dents would exceed 4,000, but
these estimates proved to be
somewhat liberal.
The peak was reached in 1947,
when 1419 single men, 111 co-eds,
