# The 						Stanford Administration 's Long, Hot Summer
## Editorial 
### 
Once again the long, hot summer is upon
us. And behind us is a long, hot year.
We think the heat is here to stay.
Perhaps, since this is the last editorial of
the volume, we should say something
schmaltzy. Something about happy memor
ies. Or portents of greater student-adminis
tration understanding. The spring harbinger
sort of tiling.
Hut, unfortunately, some of the memories
haven't been very happy, and student-admin
istration relations look as dismal today as
they did a year ago. And there is no sign
of a detente.
As a matter ol fact, the University this
year lias become even more arbitral) , restric
tive and in loco parentis.
In September the trustees set the stage

lor a chain of authoritarian regulations by
announcing that "attendance at the Univer
sity is a privilege and not a right.' In con
junction with this declaration, ambiguous
and — we think — arbitrary criteria were
established for the expulsion and suspension
of students.
I lie Larry Qucstad case in November
underscored the need for "due process of
law at Stanford—for fair appeal procedures,
lor a written statement of charges, lor proper
evidence and witnesses.
The administration's outrageous handling
of the Frank Morse case this spring proved
beyond a doubt the pressing need for such
reform.
We believe University policy should state
that cnlrtmce to Stanford is a privilege. But

(lie I Diversity should recogDize that after
matriculation students ought to be guaran
teed certain rights, at least those guaranteed
to any U.S. citizen under the Constitution.
Most students, it should be noted, have
made a considerable investment in their edu
cation — lour or more years of hard work
and several thousand dollars.
★ ★ ★
The I Diversity's in loco parentis doctrine
is illustrated in its handling of sex cases. A
Dumber ol students have been expelled for
having relationships off campus.
The new opeD house policy — in which

the flexibility of visiting hours was restricted
—is another means by which the administra
tion has attempted to assume a parental role.
Evidently no one on Inner Quad had read
John Kenneth Calbraith s famous commen
tary last fall od the type of college that feels
it has "to assure parents that their more re
tarded offspring would have the supervision
of men of the scoutmaster type who, how
ever ineffectually, would try to protect them
from the natural penalities of indulgence,
alcohol or lust.'

Perhaps the most restrictive policy this
year was the one requiring voluntary groups
to register their constitutions, their member
ship lists, their officer lists (both iDcoming

and outgoing) and their annual reports.
Even the most myopic can see the threat of
censorship in this policy.
A University staff member was quoted
in yesterdays Daily as saying: "Some people
(iu the administration) are afraid of things
getting out of hand, and they react in ways
used for years and years . . . Hut they are
using techniques of a decade back on a stu
dent population that lias changed a great
deal in that decade, and the) justify their re
action with the fallacy that it's 'just a phase'
that they (the students) are going through.
Let them call it a phase if' they want.
Hut let I Diversity officialdom reconcile itself
with the lact that it is going to be a long,
hard phase.

Perhaps the most restrictive policy this
year was the one requiring voluntary groups
to register their constitutions, their member
ship lists, their officer lists (both iDcoming

and outgoing) and their annual reports.
Even the most myopic can see the threat of
censorship in this policy.
A University staff member was quoted
in yesterdays Daily as saying: "Some people
(iu the administration) are afraid of things
getting out of hand, and they react in ways
used for years and years . . . Hut they are
using techniques of a decade back on a stu
dent population that lias changed a great
deal in that decade, and the) justify their re
action with the fallacy that it's 'just a phase'
that they (the students) are going through.
Let them call it a phase if' they want.
Hut let I Diversity officialdom reconcile itself
with the lact that it is going to be a long,
hard phase.
Once again the long, hot summer is upon
us. And behind us is a long, hot year.
We think the heat is here to stay.
Perhaps, since this is the last editorial of
the volume, we should say something
schmaltzy. Something about happy memor
ies. Or portents of greater student-adminis
tration understanding. The spring harbinger
sort of tiling.
Hut, unfortunately, some of the memories
haven't been very happy, and student-admin
istration relations look as dismal today as
they did a year ago. And there is no sign
of a detente.
As a matter ol fact, the University this
year lias become even more arbitral) , restric
tive and in loco parentis.
In September the trustees set the stage

lor a chain of authoritarian regulations by
announcing that "attendance at the Univer
sity is a privilege and not a right.' In con
junction with this declaration, ambiguous
and — we think — arbitrary criteria were
established for the expulsion and suspension
of students.
I lie Larry Qucstad case in November
underscored the need for "due process of
law at Stanford—for fair appeal procedures,
lor a written statement of charges, lor proper
evidence and witnesses.
The administration's outrageous handling
of the Frank Morse case this spring proved
beyond a doubt the pressing need for such
reform.
We believe University policy should state
that cnlrtmce to Stanford is a privilege. But

(lie I Diversity should recogDize that after
matriculation students ought to be guaran
teed certain rights, at least those guaranteed
to any U.S. citizen under the Constitution.
Most students, it should be noted, have
made a considerable investment in their edu
cation — lour or more years of hard work
and several thousand dollars.
