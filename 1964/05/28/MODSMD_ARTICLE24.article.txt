# Reactions To Goldwater Editorial
## 
### 
• Retire, Mr. Daily
Editor, The Daily:
I feel obliged to answer this
last in a series of inane Daily
editorials (Open Letter to Gold
water). Rather than attempt
ing to explain to The Daily its
lack of understanding of some
fundamental general concepts,
I would speak to some issues
raised in that editorial (and
there were few real issues for
such a mass of words*.
1) Concerning the Senator's
education, you say, "as a stu
dent, you were a disaster, and
so you dropped out of college
at the end of your freshman
year." Goldwater's father died
at this time and he dropped out
to support the rest of the fam
ily.
This might have been to his
advantage, Mr. Daily, for it
forced him into contact with a
real world you have yet to en
counter. I might also point out
that Senator Goldwater's intel
lectual ability has been ap
proved by some eight col
leges and universities have
awarded him honorary degrees
in recognition of his contribu
tions to the political affairs of
the nation.
2) You vaguely cite "utter
disregard of those historical
causes of war." Yet hero even
you, Mr. Daily, must admit the
Senator is quite capable.
In spite of your naive view of
the capabilities of the military,
you must admit that a person
who has attained the rank of
Major General is at least cap
able in military affairs; add
to that his list of military writ
ings and the experience gained
is a senator and you must find
your position difficult to hold.
3> By your statements con
cerning tactical nuclear weap
ons, it is obvious that you have
no concept of the capabilities
jf these weapons. Senator Gold
water contends that the use of
tactical nuclear weapons is
only one possibility.
They are not city-destroying
bombs but rather shells with a
yield greater than a normal
artillery piece, but still small
When compared to the area of
destruction inflicted by an aver
age bombing raid.
In fact, the use of these weap
ons would prove far less de
structive 1 to innocent or neu
tral territory than World War
II bombing raids due to their
accuracy and local effective
ness. It would be a simple mat
ter to cut the Chinese supply
lines into North Vietnam with
these weapons. And even y o u
might admit, Mr. Daily, thai
limited local destruction would
be a small price to pay for sav
ing so many American lives.
4) You claim that by advo
cating revolutions a g a in s t
Communist countries, the Sen
ator sets up a double standard.
If you consider Communist
China and the United States as
the same then a double stand
aid is advocated.
While you will not grant that
the U.S. has a right to look
after its own interest you
might concede that the U.S.
has a responsibility to protect
other countries from a Commu
nist takeover. If you grant this,
then you have taken a stand;
and if this is so you must be
willing to take a few risks to
defend that stand. And is end
ing this costly war by introduc
ing effective weaponry such a
big risk? And why, Mr. Daily,
are you so afraid of a nuclear
holocaust from a country that
has no nuclear weapons?
51 On Civil Rights you say,
"you are willing to defend

property rights but not human
dignity." What do you mean by
"Human dignity?" The right of
all Americans to equal oppor
tunities for attaining comfort
and security —- a good job,
etc?
The Senator would agree with
you. Mr. Daily, but he would
point out that if you destroy
the only system that can guar
antee' this security, then equal
ity is not really going to mean
much. You will in fact have
lost more than you have
gained.
As to the rest of your
"issues," they are all expres
sions of a lack of thoughtful
contemplation demonstrating
a high emotional content only.
I await with interest further
clarification of your points. In
the meantime I suggest you
withdraw from the newspaper
editing business and take up
something more along your
line — writing for True Con
fessions for instance.

• Concurrence
Editor, The Daily:
Tuesday's editorial was an
eloquent expression of the way
many people who are con
cerned about the future of
man on this planet must feel.
Wo heartily concur. Goldwater
is unfit for the Presidency.
The editorial clearly spelled
out the reasons leading to such
a conclusion. These things
must bo said loudly and clearly
before it is too late.

• Emotional Distaste
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily editorial attacking
Senator Goldwater's candidacy
displayed an emotional distaste
which should not belong in a
rational argument.
If the Daily wants to come
out against Senator Goldwater
(as it has every right to dot, it
could at least do so In a calm,
dignified manner befitting the
academic principles of this Uni
versity. This editorial, as writ
ten. has done no credit to the
journalistic reputation of the
Daily.

• Serious Danger
Editor, The Daily:
Merely a word of congratula
tion for your open letter to
Senator Goldwater. I, too, see
a real and serious danger in
this man's dismaying political
potentials.
If you continue the realistic
practice reflected in your edi
torial. I'm afraid you'll have to
admit that what you said is not
all too liable to convert any
staunch Goldwater disciples.
For it is clear that anyone cap
able of giving enthusiastic sup
port to the madness you
pointed out in your letter is so
impermeable to rational argu
ment thai he might well be con
sidered to be a specific example
of what can well be called the
oblivion syndrome.
Rest assured that you are not
alone. Do not dismay if you
are bombarded with any such
sophistic importinencies as post
hoc ergo propter hoc. or any
such.

It is often pointed out that
very few people in Germany
had read Mein Kampf before it
was too late. I wonder ho w
many people have looked as
closely as you into the designs
of this man who seems capable
of becoming the leader of our
country. Don't get me wrong,
1 do not intend to draw a paral
lel between the ideologies of
Goldwater and Hitler. The post
hoc ergo propter hoes w ho
wish to accuse me of calling
Goldwater a Hitler may save
their postcards. I merely wish
to point out the danger that
people might support the Sen
ator without knowing what
they are getting into. I know
a businessman who plans to
vote for Goldwater because
Kennedy took all of his ex
pense account fun and games
away from him.
Here's hoping that a few un
decided may be swayed by your
letter. Rut in case this man ac
tualy gets the reins in his fer
vent hands, please keep in mind
that I promise to show grati
tude to you by making an ex
ception: If you are in my
neighborhod when the need
arises, you, specifically, will be
welcome in my bomb shelter.

• Polemics
Editor, The Daily:
Considering its manifold of
polemical epithets and spuri
ous imputations, the reader
might carefully examine the
Daily's "Letter to Goldwater"
as to basic accuracy and acu
men of reasoning.
For example: Goldwater was
not correctly quoted, as th e
Daily paraphrases, that "we
should bomb roads, bridges,
and railroads used for bringing
supplies from Red China into
North Vietnam." Goldwater
discussed this as an idea al
ready circulating in the De
fense Department.
Regarding Goldwater's mem
bership in the NAACP, the
letter states: "your member
ship was entirely nominal. And,
we might ad, political." Let the
Daily then produce specific,
concrete evidence to the "poli
tical" aspect, otherwise it
groudlessly imputes Goldwater
with insincerity. And evidence
by analogy to other politicians
wouldn't be adequate.
If Goldwater refuses to dis
associate himself from "ex
tremism." It it a matter of rela
tive or absolute aspect? If rela
tive, then we are all "exrem
ist" from someone's viewpoint,
and the epithet falls as mean
ingless polemic, a quasi-psycho
logical ad homemim designed
to avoid rationally disputing
one's putative opponents.

• Power Grab
Editor, The Daily:
I have watched with interest
Mr. Bonine write from the
front page to the back page of
the Daily in his campaign
against the Political Union
Board. He authored a "news ar
ticle" in Tuesday's Daily, he
has written two editorials rep
resenting the "opinion" of the
Daily, and finally one editorial
to which he thoughtfully at
tached his byline.
Unfortunately, Mr. Bonine
has been unsuccessful in re
vealing just who has been grab
bing for power in any of his
four articles and editorials.
For one so concerned about
a power grab, i1 is interesting
to note that Mr. Bonine is a
member of the Campus Repub

liean Club, of which he is chair
man, the Stanford Area Young
Republicans, of w hi eh he is
President, as well as being a
member of both the Conserva
tive Club and the Stanford
Goldwater for President Com
mittee.
He is also secretary of the
Stanford Students for Lee Kai
ser.
The first three of these or
ganizations have been ruled
eligible to vote in Political
Union elections by ASSU Elec
tions Commission. The other
two are registered voluntary
groups which Mr, Bonine
claims should vote in Political
Union elections.
As a student who has not
been so fortunate in diversi
fying my political interests, let
alone in having the Daily facili
ties at m\ disposal, my only
question is just who is grab
bing power?
RIC HARD KATCLIFF
FRITOR'S NOTF: Although
the majority of Daily editorials
are written by the editor, we do
run editorials written by other
staff members (such as Mr.
Bonine) when —and only when
—they represent the editorial
opinion of this newspaper. We
had discussed the Political
Union question at length with
>Ir. Bonine before the editorial
was printed.
• Islam
Editor, The Daily:
This is to express certain
thoughts which occured to me
after listening to the talk de
livered by Dr. George S. Rentz,
"The Caliphs and the Colonels:
Islam Yesterday and Today,"
and reported in The Daily on
May 20.
Whereas the attack on theo
cracies, mountebank monarchs
and charlatan rulers peddling
secularism is justified, one can
not honestly maintain that the
corruption is the system. Islam
is a dynamic system and an
ideology based on the perma
nent values and the relativity
of the Quran. While breaking
free from inertia and the his
torical chains which have been
forged around it, Moslem
thought is moving forward to
grapple with the problems of
today and tomorrow in a state
founded on Islamic ideology.
Apparently, an aim of the
Hoover Institute is to focus at
tention on geopolitical realities.
They are doomed to a fiasco
from the first who would con
cede on account of political ex
pediency a place to Moslems
in historical time and space,
yet retain a concept of Islam
that is reminiscent of medieval
ignorance and bigotry.
It is a tribute to his under
standing that Dr. Rentz recog
nizes Islam as a primary fac
tor in today's struggle between
East and West. What is needed
is a study of Islam, which is
independent of its past aber
rations and transcends present
linguistic and geographic na
tionalisms.

• True Believer
Editor, The Daily:
The interview with 'the
Christians of Box 11791' re
veals a surprising naivete on
tho part of Ihe Daily's inter
viewer. I refer particularly to
the statement that these Chris
tians "represent a rare phe
nomenon in a college commu
ity the Christian True Be
liever."
If the definition of a Chris

tian True Believer is that giv
en in the following paragraph,
"through faith in the Bible
Ihcy have established a per
sonal relationship with Christ."
the number of Christian True
Believers in the student body
and faculty of Stanford itself,
not to mention ihe college com
munity, is by no means limited
to a "mystic" few.
It is unfortunate that the
presence of such Christian
True Believers can be so com
pletely overlooked. Perhaps
many of them would not con
sider the modus operandi of
the Christians of Box 11791 to
be the most effective for a col
lege community, but if the al
ternative is such apparent non
existence that a Christian True
Believer can be considered a
"rare phenomenon," then it is
a challenge to Christian True
Believers on campus to live up
to their calling.
Perhaps The Daily would do
well to interview members of
the Stanford Christian Fellow
ship, the Canterbury Society,
the Evangelical Fellowship, or
any one of the other Christian
student groups which meet
regularly on campus to con
sider the meaning of their per
sonal relationship with Christ.
The Daily might even consider
interviewing the faculty spon
sors of these groups.
The Daily interviewer has
touched a key point in her ex
position of the Christian True
Believer when she says th a t:
they are charatcerized by a
"care and concern for people
brought to them by conver
sion," It seems that people like
this are in great need and short
supply.
RICHARD 11. BUBi;
• S.O.R.E.
Fditor, The Daily:
Irving Howe, leaving Stan
ford last year in a belch of
outrage delivered himself of a
series of withering homilies.
Fondly recalling Stanford stu
dents, Mr. Howe was moved to
remark in the Winter 1964
issue of Dissent th a t we
"bright-cheeked, good-hearted
innocents" had no sense of, nor
involvement in history, (p. 21.)
We heartily agreed with Mr.
Howe's generous first observa
tion (and would not want it
otherwise) but sense that his
second pronouncement may no
longer apply to all Stanford
students.
Those of us who are putting
our necks in the noose (no
longer figurative> to work on
the Mississippi Summer Proj
ect, and/or who are presenting
family and friends with prob
lems they would rather not
face, proclaim the advent of an
organization designed to meet
some of the southern Negro
community's material needs.
We are. Mr. Howe, 5.0. R.E.,
Stanford's Operation for Re
moving Excess. The excess
books, clothing, and money
which clutter this campus con
stitute a major blight. Happily,
one state's blight is another
state's windfall.
Appropriately-inscribed boxes
will be placed in each dormi
tory to hold unwanted books
and clothing, and an informal
collection of money to ship
Stanford's excess to Missis
sippi wil be undertaken by stu
dents with a sense of history.
Anyone whose blight is a
SORE point is invited to call
us at DA 3-9043. We need help.
