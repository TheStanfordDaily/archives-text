## Political Union Prefers Control Of Legislature To Partisans 
### Andy Williams 
The above charges, quoted from
Monday's Daily, are designed to
| create the impression tfiat the
Political Union Board is a tre
mendously powerful body held in
check only by the constant vigi
lance of the chairmen of the "dis
enfranchised" groups. The excite
ment created by suggestions of a
power grab can only obscure the
| basic issues.
Recent charges have oeen de
signed to create the impression
that the Political Union Board is
;a tremendously powerful body
i helfl in check only by the constant
vigilance of the chairmen of the
. "disenfranchised" groups. The ex
citement created by suggestions
of a power grab can only obscure
i the basic issues.
SUCH A CHARGE ignores the
large number of restraints upon
the actions of the Political Union
Board, regardless of the vigilance
| of the voluntary groups. Seven,
not five, people vote on the Politi
joal Union Board; the ASSU Presi
dent and the Student Financial
Manager possess votes and pro
vide two of the many "outside in
fluences" which the Daily claims
| "impossible."
LASSU has the power of com
plete control over Political Union
' as it has over all of its hoards and
commissions. All changes in t he
I Political Union by-laws must
stand the scrutiny of LASSU's
By-laws Committee which has
twice reported favorably on the
; proposed amendments. Legisla
ture has the final say on any by
law amendments as it already has
had and will have again. Political
I Union Board meetings have al
; ways been open to the public.

ANOTHER ISSUE that has
been obscured by The Daily's sen
sationalism is the distinction be
tween "sponsorship" and "regis
tration." John Boninc in his ar
ticle of May 25, objects to my
j statement that "at no time were
voluntary groups officially reg
istered " i t h Political Union
Board."
The fact is that registration of
voluntary groups rests solely with
the University's Student Affairs
and Services Committee. The func
tion of "sponsorship" established
between Political Union Board
and the politically oriented vol
untary groups by the University
Policy Statement is purely an ad
ministrative one and has been
discharged in a strictly non-parti
san manner.
It is. despite Mr. Bonine's ob
jections, temporary, because con
tact between the Board and any
voluntary groups results only
when the groups wish to present
programs open to the public as j
outlined in the University Policy
Statement. It must then seek the
Board's sponsorship; sponsorship
first depends on the availability
of facilities and second on pro- \
grams being scheduled on a first j
come, first served basis.
It would be unfair to the first j
group scheduled for a particular
day to schedule on the same day ;
another program drawing from
substantially the same audience.
Mr. Bonine's charge that the
Board can veto programs arbi
trarily is inconsistent with the
above two criteria for scheduling,
both of which are outlined in the
statement of the Student Affairs
and Services Commilec handed
out to each group upon registra- ■
tion It would be hard to believe

thai Mr. Bonine is unfamiliar
with the statement.
AFTER WADING through the
j charges thrown at the Political
i Union Board we finally get to the
j central issue: whether or not the
; chairmen of voluntary groups
may vote in Political Union elec
tions. First of all, voluntary group
chairmen have never voted in any
elections for the simple reason
that they didn't exist until this
year. The classification was
created by the University's Pol
icy Statement.
Second, the old caucuses can't
be equated with voluntary groups.
The old caucuses were non-parti
i san and ineffectual. All of them
were barred from taking stands
lon off-campus issues. This was
the old situation, but it is wha
was carried over into the preser
Political Union Board by-laws ui
der the label "groups." Thes
groups are not "voluntarj
groups." If they had been ii
tended to be "voluntary groups,"
it is strange that the members
drafting the constitution never
used the term.
The Policy Statement of Ih c
Board of Trustees allowed parti-
I san political organizations to form
! on campus. These groups m us t
; register with Student Affairs and
I Services, bank with the Students'
| Organization Fund, and have their
I all-campus programs sponsored
| by the Political Union.
THESE NEWLY created voltm
! tary groups can take stands on
! off-campus issues while ASSU or
ganizations, such as Political
| Union, cannot. To allow voluntary
j groups to vote in Political Union
i elections would be to establish a
connection between the voluntary
j groups and the Political Union
j other than the one of "sponsor
! ship" specified by the University
| Policy Statement.
Such a connection would be con*
j trary to University policy and
would, therefore, be contrary to
I the ASSU constitution which re
quires students to operate "with
in the framework of policies and
regulations established by th e
j University through the President
| of the University and the Board
I of Trustees."
j With ihe existing checks on the
j Political Union Board, smallness
| doesn't present the possibility of
one political faction dominating
the Board. However, if voluntary
i group chairmen were allowed to
{vote, a far greater danger of par*
| tisan control would be introduced.
★ ★ ★
SINCE THE ONLY require
: merits for registration of volun
-1 tary groups is that it consist of
j five members, have a constitution,
j and bank with the Students' Or*
I ganization Fund, it would be easy
! for one of the larger voluntary
i groups (potentially the Young Re*
I publicans or the Young Demo
: erats) to divide its membership
! into a number of smaller volun
tary groups, and thereby create
| enough votes to control the Poli
tical Union Board Elections.
The board members feel that
the Political Union has respon
sibly discharged its duty to pre
sent a varied program to the cam
pus on political and social issues
i this year. It believes that it can
continue to do so under the con
trol and "authority" of legisla
ture. rather than under the poten
tial thumb of the partisan volun
tary groups.

ANOTHER ISSUE that has
been obscured by The Daily's sen

tween "sponsorship" and "regis
tration." John Boninc in his ar
ticle of May 25, objects to my
j statement that "at no time were
voluntary groups officially reg
istered " i t h Political Union
Board."
The fact is that registration of
voluntary groups rests solely with
the University's Student Affairs
and Services Committee. The func
tion of "sponsorship" established
between Political Union Board
and the politically oriented vol
untary groups by the University
Policy Statement is purely an ad
ministrative one and has been
discharged in a strictly non-parti
san manner.
It is. despite Mr. Bonine's ob
jections, temporary, because con
tact between the Board and any
voluntary groups results only
when the groups wish to present
programs open to the public as j
outlined in the University Policy
Statement. It must then seek the
Board's sponsorship; sponsorship
first depends on the availability
of facilities and second on pro- \
grams being scheduled on a first j
come, first served basis.
It would be unfair to the first j
group scheduled for a particular
day to schedule on the same day ;
another program drawing from
substantially the same audience.
Mr. Bonine's charge that the
Board can veto programs arbi
trarily is inconsistent with the
above two criteria for scheduling,
both of which are outlined in the
statement of the Student Affairs
and Services Commilec handed
out to each group upon registra- ■
tion It would be hard to believe

AFTER WADING through the

elections for the simple reason
that they didn't exist until this

Second, the old caucuses can't

groups are not "voluntarj

tended to be "voluntary groups,"

ANOTHER ISSUE that has

tration." John Boninc in his ar
ticle of May 25, objects to my
j statement that "at no time were
voluntary groups officially reg
istered " i t h Political Union
Board."
The fact is that registration of
voluntary groups rests solely with
the University's Student Affairs
and Services Committee. The func
tion of "sponsorship" established
between Political Union Board
and the politically oriented vol
untary groups by the University
Policy Statement is purely an ad
ministrative one and has been
discharged in a strictly non-parti
san manner.
It is. despite Mr. Bonine's ob
jections, temporary, because con
tact between the Board and any
voluntary groups results only
when the groups wish to present
programs open to the public as j
outlined in the University Policy
Statement. It must then seek the
Board's sponsorship; sponsorship
first depends on the availability
of facilities and second on pro- \
grams being scheduled on a first j
come, first served basis.
It would be unfair to the first j
group scheduled for a particular
day to schedule on the same day ;
another program drawing from
substantially the same audience.
Mr. Bonine's charge that the
Board can veto programs arbi
trarily is inconsistent with the
above two criteria for scheduling,
both of which are outlined in the
statement of the Student Affairs
and Services Commilec handed
out to each group upon registra- ■
tion It would be hard to believe

elections for the simple reason
that they didn't exist until this

Second, the old caucuses can't

I Services, bank with the Students'

THESE NEWLY created voltm
! tary groups can take stands on
! off-campus issues while ASSU or
ganizations, such as Political
| Union, cannot. To allow voluntary
j groups to vote in Political Union
i elections would be to establish a
connection between the voluntary
j groups and the Political Union
j other than the one of "sponsor
! ship" specified by the University
| Policy Statement.
Such a connection would be con*
j trary to University policy and
would, therefore, be contrary to
I the ASSU constitution which re
quires students to operate "with
in the framework of policies and
regulations established by th e
j University through the President
| of the University and the Board
I of Trustees."
j With ihe existing checks on the
j Political Union Board, smallness
| doesn't present the possibility of
one political faction dominating
the Board. However, if voluntary
i group chairmen were allowed to
{vote, a far greater danger of par*
| tisan control would be introduced.

SINCE THE ONLY require
: merits for registration of volun
-1 tary groups is that it consist of
j five members, have a constitution,
j and bank with the Students' Or*
I ganization Fund, it would be easy
! for one of the larger voluntary
i groups (potentially the Young Re*
I publicans or the Young Demo
: erats) to divide its membership
! into a number of smaller volun
tary groups, and thereby create
| enough votes to control the Poli
tical Union Board Elections.
The board members feel that
the Political Union has respon
sibly discharged its duty to pre
sent a varied program to the cam
pus on political and social issues
i this year. It believes that it can
continue to do so under the con
trol and "authority" of legisla
ture. rather than under the poten
tial thumb of the partisan volun
tary groups.
