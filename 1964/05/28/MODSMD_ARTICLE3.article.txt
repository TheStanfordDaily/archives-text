# A 						WORK OF HONESTY
## Sequoia Less Erotic Now -But The Writing's Fine 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
The Spring edition of Stanford's Sequoia magazine admittedly
lias less erotic appeal than its Winter Quarter counterpart. But
that is hardly to he regretted. It possesses something far more
rare — that greatest of literary virtues: honestly.
Under the direction of Editor Howard Kaye, the Sequoia staff

has assembled over fifty pages of
consistently fine writing: th roe
short stories, one poem, and two
essays. According 1o Kaye, the
collection also includes an Edi
tor's note which sets forth "a
carefully reasoned and convincing
argument for the abolition of
women at Stanford." Unfortun
ately, the copy for this polemic
was unavailable by Daily press
time.
TJIIO MOST refreshing quality
of this quarter's Sequoia is its
relative variety of subject matter
and balance of genres. The edi
torial staff has achieved a genu
inely broad base of appeal with
out resorting to "name" writers
beyond the academic community.
The Sequoia, at last, is thoroughly
a si udent magazine.
The initial contribution is a
critical evaluation of James Bald
win's novels by English major
Sally Pay) on. Miss Pay ton's prose
is crisp and compelling reflect
ing, perhaps, the influence of men
tor Yvor Winters. Her perceptions
of Baldwin's literary strengths
and weaknesses as well as her
peri feral comments on the general
problem of race relations are
remarkably cogent.
The second selection is a short
story, "Horace, Piercer of Ears,"
by senior David llathwell, win
ner of the Sequoia's 1961 Fiction
Prize. It is a subtle and rather de
pressing study of sexual frigidity
and intellectual ardity perhaps
a litle artificial in its construction
but nontbeless smoothly exe
cuted from start to finish.
"Thy Sweet Love Remembered,"
a short story by Charlotte Low.
is in many ways the most impres
sive achievement of the volume.
Miss Low not only writes vv i th
amusing and convincing realism,
but accomplishes tlie truly diffi
cult feat of evoking pathos with
out for one moment decending
into easy sentimentality.
