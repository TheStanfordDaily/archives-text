# Secretariat Funds Frozen
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Political Editor 
LASSU Speaker Martin Gibson
; yesterday froze the funds of the
Civil Rights Secretariat. The
; action will only last until the
| LASSU meeting tonight, when
I the Legislature will decide
whether Gibson's move will be
' permanent.
112 GIBSON DECIDED to freeze
it he Secretariat's funds after find
ling that COFO (the Council of
j Federated Organizations) which
| is closely related to the Secret a
; riat, is planning to attempt to un
seat the Mississippi delegation at
the Democratic Convention this
i summer.
Gibson told The Daily that when
j funds were made available to the
i Secretariat it was with 1 lie un
i derstanding that it would be only
and information disseminating
i body and would not engage in
j political activities.
MOKE THAN $200 of the orig
inal $300 Legislature grant to the
Secretariat has been spent, so the
; money involved is small.
However, Gibson feels that his
i action will make the Secretariat's
i functions more clearly spelled oul
| if there are any further requests
for money next year.
The Legislature will meet to
| night at the ASSU Banquet.
