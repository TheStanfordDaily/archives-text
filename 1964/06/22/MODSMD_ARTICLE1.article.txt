# Oregon Group Opens Summer Festival
## 
### 
What Shakespeare himself might call a "bond of fate"
will mark tomorrow's opening night of the first Stanford
Summer Festival of the Arts.
THE BOND —between the University and the Ashland,
Oregon Shakespearean Festival—will be symbolized
when Producing Director Angus Bowmer appears as
Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice" on the newly-con
structed Elizabethean stage in Frost Amphitheatre.
For a quarter of a century, Stanford and the Oregon
company have shared faculties, talents and ideas. Bow
mer is one of a number of student and faculty members
who have been closely associated with the Ashland Festi
val since 1940.
BOWMER, who has done graduate work at Stanford,
founded the Oregon Festival in 1935 and is now a profes
sor of Drama at Southern Oregon College.
Virgil Whitaker, Stanford Festival director, has also
encouraged the growth of the Ashland project by teach
ing summer courses and by delivering lectures.
ANOTHER MEMBER of the bond Is Stanford Drama
Department Chairman Robert Loper who is now in his
seventh season as an Ashland director.
Richard Hay, a former Stanford drama professor, has
been with the Company since 1949 and designed both
the Ashland and Stanford Elizabethean Theatres.

"THE MERCHANT OF VENICE" is only the first of
dozens of plays, lectures, seminars, exhibits, concerts, and
films that will celebrate the 400 th anniversary of Shake
speare's birth.
The Oregon group will present, in nightly rotation un
til July 4, "The Merchant of Venice," "King Lear," and
"Twelfth Night."
THREE DAYS later, the Old Globe Theati'e National
Shakespeare Festival from San Diego will open a six-day
stand with "Macbeth," "Much Ado About Nothing," and
"Measure for Measure."
The University's own Stanford Players will present
"The Duchess of Malfi' each night from July 27 through
August 1.
THE SAN FRANCISCO Actor's Workshop will close
out the Festival with "Volpone" August 5-8.
An educational innovation during the festival will be

the plays. Directors, producers, and actors from the three

ing summer courses and by delivering lectures.

Department Chairman Robert Loper who is now in his
seventh season as an Ashland director.

been with the Company since 1949 and designed both
the Ashland and Stanford Elizabethean Theatres.

"THE MERCHANT OF VENICE" is only the first of
dozens of plays, lectures, seminars, exhibits, concerts, and
films that will celebrate the 400 th anniversary of Shake
speare's birth.
The Oregon group will present, in nightly rotation un
