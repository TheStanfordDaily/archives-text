# Six Student Archeologists Combing European Ruins
## 
### 
Six lucky students arrive in
Athens today for a summer of
digging in archeological ruins
and combing museums in Italy,
Greece, and Sicily.
THE SEXTET —two boys and
four girls—makes up the second
group of a Classics Department
study program leading to a mas
ter's degree, supported by tuition
income and Ford Foundation
grants.
The pilot group, launched last
summer, has returned to the cam
pus to proceed with graduate
work.
PRIME MOVER of the program
was Prof. Brooks Otis, executive
head of the department, who spent
more than three years in its plan

ning and financing.
ALL ARE JUNIORS, and all
plan a teaching career.
Present plans call for a month
in Italy, a month in Grecce, and
a month to themselves for inde
pendent study and research. They
will visit the major museums and
archeological "diggings" in the
nations, keep extensive journals
and make formal reports on the
sites.
PROF. EDWIN J. DOYLE will
accompany the group as chaperon
guide.
The students include Nora Fran
ces Crow, Kathleen Mary Mat
thews, Kathleen E. Morgan, Char
lotte Irene Low, Thomas M. Pen
dergast Jr., and George F. Braff.
