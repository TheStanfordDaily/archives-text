# School-On-The-Sea Seeks Fossil Fish
## 
### 
An expedition that may bring
back alive one of the world's most
primitive fishes began last week
under the leadership of Stanford's
saltiest scientist, Prof. Rolf Bolin
of the Hopkins Marine Station.
STANFORD'S seagoing biology
laboratory, the 135-foot schooner
Te Vega, has sailed from Port
Louis on Mauritius Island in the
Indian Ocean.
In addition to other marine bio
'ogical research, the vessel's sci
entists hope to capture the coele
canth, a living fossil fish found in
the cold (50-60° F.) black depths
(500-600 feet) off the Comoro Is
lands.
IF THEY CAN catch several
and keep them alive in special
tanks aboard the Te Vega, at least
one cnelecanth can go to San Fran
cisco's Steinhardt Aquarium at the
California Academy of Sciences in
Golden Gate Park.
In that case Dr. Earl S. Herald,
aquarium curator, plans to fly out
and speed the fish back in a tank
aboard the airplane. At Golden
Gate Park an 8,000-gallon refriger
ated whirlpool tank, built especial
ly for coelecanths, awaits the rare
fish.
TWO DAYS is the longest a coe
lecanth has been kept alive—not
by scientists but by fishermen us
ing a submerged dory.
Until one was caught in 1938,
the fish was thought to have be
come extinct about 60 million
years ago.
Sometimes called "the fish with
four legs," the coelecanth is the
only living member of the "cros
soptergian" class. Crossoptergians
are believed to be ancestral to all
the higher forms of vertebrate life.
THE COELECANTH was
thought to mature at around five
feet in length and more than 150
pounds, but there are recent indi
cations of smaller species about
12 to 18 inches long.
The present voyage will be the
Te Vega's third cruise as part of
the International Indian Ocean
Expedition (IIOE). This is a co
operative effort by scientists of 28
nations working from shore sta
tions and from more than 40 re

search vessels to explore 28 million
square miles of one of the wrold's
least-known seas.
When the ship heads for the Co
moros there will be seven gradu
ate students aboard taking a regu
lar university course, Biology 222h
(Biological Oceanography) under
fellowship from the National Sci
ence Foundation.
