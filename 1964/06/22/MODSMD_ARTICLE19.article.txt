## 
### 
Woodside has lost another battle in its war against overhead
power lines to the Stanford Linear Accelerator.
After deliberating for two weeks, U.S. District Judge Albert C.
Wollenberg ruled that the government has the authority under the
1954 Atomic Energy Act to condemn five acres in the nearby town-

ship for the transmission lines. "
THE DECISION, in effect, over
ruled a Woodsido ordinance which
required that all overhead lines
carrying more than 50,000 volts be
placed underground.
TIIE RECENT legal action is
the result of protests by Woodside
residents against unsightly power
poles which they maintain will
destroy the aesthetics of the area.
The Woodside people were at
tempting to force the government
to supply underground lines to the
$114 million atom-smasher, but the

Atomic Energy Commission has
refused to allocate $1.4 million
toward the $2.6 million cost of
sub-surface facilities.
