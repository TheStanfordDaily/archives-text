# SRI Planning Library Study
## 
### 
Stanford Ilcsearch Institute will
conduct a survey this summer to
determine the costs of library op
eration by type of service and by
type of person using the library.
* The study will help determine
the library's share of indirect costs
recovered on government con
tracts and grants.
During the quarter, library
users will be questioned as to their
status at the University, and the
library facilities which they use.
This will enable the survey teams
to ascertain the extent to which
each library activity is used by
undergraduate, students, graduate
students, faculty, staff and
"others." This in turn, will reveal
the total cost of library service,
per person by type of service, for
the indirect cost survey.
