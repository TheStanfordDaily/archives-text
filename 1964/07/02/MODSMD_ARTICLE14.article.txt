## Dogs Aid Kidney Studies 
### 
A new method of detecting and
treating rejection of transplanted
kidneys has kept dogs alive for
more than 75 days, a Stanford
Medical School research team re
ported last week.
THE TECHNIQUE enables doc
tors to predict when the rejection
of the grafted or borrowed organ
will begin and provides a reliable
guide for controlling the dosage
of immunosuppressive drugs.
Authors of the report were Dr.
Samuel L. Kountz, Dr. Donald R.
Laub, residents in surgery, and
Dr. Roy Cohn, professor of surg
ery.
Before the method was devel
oped, the average survival rate
of dogs with borrowed kidneys
was 40 days.
MORE THAN 40 per cent of
them died from overdosage of the
immunosuppressive drugs while
the transplanted kidney was still
functioning.
The researchers explained that
the technique enables them to ob
tain measurements of the kidney
blood supply during the func
tional period of the graft in the
experimental animals.
They found that a fall in blood
flow was the first detectable sig
nal that the rejection mechanism
was taking place and that drugs
can be injected which suppress
the rejection mechanism by re
storing the blood flow.
The idea for the new technique
was inspired mainly by a dis
covery reported bv Dr. Kountz at
the American College of Cardi
ology earlier this year and for
which he was honored as "out
standing young investigator of
1964."
