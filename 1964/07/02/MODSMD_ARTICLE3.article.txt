## Quarter System Debate 
### STAN WEAKLEY Staff Writer 
The quarter system, recently
adopted by both the California
State Colleges and the Univer
sity of California, drew fire last
week from the chairman of the
San Francisco State psychology
department.
LOUIS S. LEV INK, SFS profes
sor of psychology, charged that
adoption of the quarter system
would force many students to
quit school.
Testifying before a State Col
lege Trustees' committee investi
gating the "Professors' Revolt"
at State, Levine argued that each
college calendar should be tailor
ed to the character of its com
munity, rather than impose the
same system on all 17 members
of the state college system.
"SAN FRANCISCO serves a
student who is probably the first
generation of his family to at
tend college," said Levine.
"He is apt to work for all or
part of his expenses and combine
20 or 25 hours of work a week
with a college program."
The semester system, contend
ed Levine, offers a student more
flexibility for his job.
BUT LOUIS HEILBRON, a
State College Trustee, disagreed
with Levine.
Heilbron questioned how work
ing students would benefit more
from an IS week vacation than a
full quarter year of 14 weeks.
