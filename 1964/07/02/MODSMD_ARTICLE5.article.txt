# Trustees Reject $500 Donation

### 
University Trustees have re
fused a $500 gift from the Winds
of Freedom Foundation because
the organization has not been
authorized to solicit funds for
Stanford.

THE TRUSTEES noted accept
ance of the Rift would not be in
accord with a 1954 resolution that
"solicitation of funds for the Uni
versity's support be made only
with the approval of the Board of
Trustees."
Organized as a nonprofit Cali
fornia corporation in July, 1962,
the Foundation's articles of incor
poration include the following
statement of its general purposes,
"the solicitation, promotion, and
encouragement of gifts, dona
tions, and grants to and contracts
and agreements with Stanford by
others. . . ."
ITS LITERATURE closely re
sembles the University's in for
mat and carries a Stanford post
office box address.
On May 7, 1963, the University
disclosed the trustees had refused
gift offers from two individuals
who stipulated the use of the
funds be designated or approver!
by the Winds of Freedom Founda
tion directors at a later date.
At that time, the trustees en

dorsed a previous policy state
ment that "the board cannot sur
render or divide the responsibility
and authority for controlling the
University's affairs, including the
solicitation and acceptance of
gifts and Ihe determination of
their use."
