## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
The Stanford students participating in the Mississippi Summer
Project arrived in the state this week after completing a training
session at Oxford, Ohio.
The Oxford program was designed to instruct students in the
operation of Community Centers and Freedom Schools which are

opening this week.
808 BEYERS, Director of the
Stanford News Service who is on
a month's leave of absence work
ing at Project headquarters in
Jackson, told the Weekly in a
telephone conversation that the
bulk of the Stanford students ar
rived Sunday and quickly spread
throughout the state.
They are spending the week
orienting themselves and setting
up housing while preparing for
the opening of the schools and
centers.
As Beyers voice faded during
the conversation and then return
ed full force he quipped, "Well,
I guess Governor Johnson and
company have given up the tap
for awhile."
SOME EARLY Stanford arri
vals have begun work.
Sophomore Pat Thomas has
been working on voter registra
tion in Vicksburg, while Marga
ret Rose, graduate s t u dent in
Modern European Languages, is
stationed in the communication
section at COFO headquarters.

STANFORD METHODIST min
ister Jim Corson and throe stu
dents including Len Edwards of
Stanford attended services at a
Negro Methodist Church Sunday
after the mayor of Ruleville had
told them they could not attend
a white church.
The Rev. Mr. Corson said Mayor
Charles Dorrough advised him,
"You've come down here to live
with Negroes so you can go to
church with them."
STANFORD GRADUATE Ilene
Strelitz. West Coast coordinator
of the Project, has gone from Ox
ford to Washington, D.C. on a
special assignment for the Free
dom Democratic Party, an organi
zation set up to challenge the reg
ular Mississippi state Democratic
machine.
"There has been a great in
crease in FBI involvement, espe
cially in voter registration cases,"
reported Beyers. "The Bureau has
been much friendlier and more
receptive to calls from COFO.
HOWEVER, Project Director
Boh Moses expressed displeasure
with tin 1 Federal Government for
not acting quickly enough in the
case of the three students missing
in the Philadelphia case. "It took
twenty-four hours undoubtedly
the critical 24 hours to get the
Government to act," d e c 1 a r e d

Meanwhile, highway billboards
throughout the state proclaimed
June "hospitality month."
