# SWAMI Will Predict The Weather
## 
### 
An imaginative plan for a $40 million-a-year global weather
satellite system that might save the U.S. more than $6 billion an
nually has been proposed by a 31-man team of Stanford engineering
students.
The students presented a preliminary design for their SWAMI
(Stanford Worldwide Acquisition of Meteorological Information)
weather forecasting system at a recent campus meeting of industry
and government officials.
THE PLANS, which include satellite and automatic weather sta
tion models, are the product of a six-month classroom project under
the guidance of top electronics, missile, and weather experts. The
system should give both a more accurate picture of existing weather
and more precise global weather forecasts.
The SWAMI system—or one like it—apparently is already being
assembled by Russian scientists, according to a recent i-eport. The
USSR is reportedly reorganizing its weather forecasting system to
take greater advantage of satellites and automatic stations.
THE SOVIETS were reported to bo planning 3500 hydometeoro
logical stations, 8000 weather posts, and 150 radiosonde stations. The
purpose is to de-emphasize manned stations and rely more heavily
on instrumentation and computers.
Present U.S. weather forecasting, despite the addition of compu
ters and TIROS satellites to the system, still relies largely on the
human forecaster's experience.
"IN A SENSE the present statistical methods are only an exten
sion of the old method of weather forecasting," said one member of
the student team, V. Leo Rideout.
"There exists a perfectly good mathematical theory of fluid mo
tions that describes the behavior of the atmosphere," he continued.
"If we had enough data to go on, we could use it."
Little or no weather information comes from about 85 per cent
of the globe, especially in the southern hemisphere and ocean areas.
THE SWAMI SYSTEM proposes instrumented satellites orbiting
at about 1200 miles. These would pick up and store weather data
from several thousand airborne balloon stations and waterborne
buoy stations, as well as from existing land stations.
On command, the satellite would "read out" its stored information
to a single tracking station which could relay it instantly to weather
forecasting headquarters in Washington, D.C.
Three 400-pound satellites would be placed in circular polar orbits
by Minuteman boosters.
SMALL BALLOON stations would float freely at constant alti
ludes of 18,000 and 50,000 feet. Their solar-powered instruments
would measure winds, temperature, pressure, and other conditions.
Free-floating and anchored buoy stations would carry out similar
missions on the surface of the sea.
SWAMI satellites would carry a briefcase-sized computer for
guidance, data handling, and determining the position of weather
stations.
The Stanford team is now preparing a full report of the project
lor distribution to officials of the U.S. Weather Bureau, NASA, and
ether interested agencies.
Four different departments of the Stanford School of Engineering,
as well as outside lecturers from government and industry, cooper
ated in the project

student team which drew up plans for a global

weather forecasting system that appears tech
nically feasible and operationally desirable but
which has not yet been designed and built by
industry.
