# PACIFIST STATION
## KPFA Boosters Organize 
### TOM GIBSON Feature Editor 
When Emily Goodman, a Stanford graduate stu
dent in history, felt that someone should help
KPFA, the radio station of the local Pacifica Foun
dation, she went out and formed a committee. "No
one much opposed my becoming president," she
said in a recent interview.
The Stanford Committee is designed to raise
money for KPFA, which is entirely subscriber-sup
ported and non-profit. The station broadcasts all
shades of opinion from the far left to the extreme
right, classical music, and modern plays such as
"The Zoo Story" by Edward Albee.
It was that play, as well as some other programs,
that brought the station into conflict with the Fed
eral Communications Commission.
KPFA WAS accused by listeners of broadcasting
Communist propaganda, obscene programs (such
as "The Zoo Story" and a panel discussion of homo
sexuality) and of being controlled by the Commu
nist Party.
The FCC acquitted KPFA of these charges last
January, stating that the station was "serving the
public inlerest."
Mrs. Goodman terms the station "a dream of
mine, a personal dream."
As she talks about the Stanford Committee for
KPFA, her words become more rapid and more
intense. She is a short, stocky girl with a broad
smile on an unmade-up face.
She believes that the station helps make society
more pluralistic instead of "one conforming mass
culture."

"I HAVE STRONG beliefs about that sort of
thing," she says,"and I'm unhappy when I'm not
doing anything about them."
She cannot give much money for her "dream,"
so her main contribution is the organization which
she has formed.
"I'm thrilled to find a group on campus that's as
interested as I am," she adds.
There are about 20 dues-paying members, al
though only nine showed up for the first summer
meeting several weeks ago.
"The kind of people in this group," explains Mrs.
Goodman, "are the kind of people who join the
American Civil Liberties Union."
The recent meeting consisted of a series of re
ports, the first read by Edward Colby of the music
department, a man with features and carefully
enunciated speech similar to Linus Pauling.
HE HAD ATTENDED a meeting of the station
directors and reported that two-thirds of the sub
scribers had signed a petition indicating a desire
to help determine station programming.
The remainder of the meeting was devoted to fall
organizational policies.
Nick Goodman, also an active member, suggested
an off-campus fund-raising party with Viet Cong
movies and William Mandel, who recently pub
lished a new book, "Russia Re-examined."
The Goodmans belong to no other organizations,
but Mrs. Goodman expresses an interest in the
Young Democrats.
"I'm a real politico from a way back," she en
thuses.
