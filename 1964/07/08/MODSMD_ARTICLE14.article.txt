# NO NOISY GHOSTS
## Mind Moving Matter? 
### TOM GIBSON Feature Editor 
Arthur Hastings, Stanford
speech professor, still thinks there
is more to the recent "poltergeist"
(noisy ghost) incident than just a
prank.
Oakland police recently arrested
John Orfanides, 20, for causing
light bulbs to break, typewriters
to stick mysteriously, and file cab
inets to fall over in the East Bay
office where he works.
Hastings, an amateur parapsy
chologist, says that the boy was
forced into signing a confession by
the police.
PSYCHOKINESIS (mind over

matter) was at work, maintains
Hastings.
The disturbance all started in a
court reporter's office in Oakland
when typewriters stopped work
ing. Eventually light bulbs began
falling out of sockets, and entire
cabinets and telephones began to
move without any apparent ex
planation.
Then the police nailed down
their suspect and are convinced
that Orfanides performed the
tricks with strings.
There will be no trial, however,
because the court reporter's office
is convinced that the boy is not a
prankster.

WHAT THEN is the cause of
the "poltergeists?"
Hastings, who has been inter
ested in parapsychology since he
started college ten years ago, said
he did not know the answer, but
that a number of theories have
been advanced.
One is that the people using the
office might want to break their
lease. Hastings said that there is
no evidence supporting this theory,
nor does it look as if the office
wanted the publicity.
"There is also the electrical
theory," added Hastings, "but I
can't quite imagine bits of radia
tion zooming through the air and
picking up cabinets."
HASTINGS HIMSELF leans to
ward the psychokinesis theory,
which involves mind moving mat
ter.
"Often there is someone in a
group—usually a child—who has
Hostility he can't express overtly.
Although this theory doesn't ex
plain how the mind acts on mat
ter," declares Hastings, "it is at
least a start."
Hastings and a colleague plan to
run psychological tests on the of
fice staff and send the results to
J. 13. Rhine, famed parapsychol
ogist at Duke University.

started college ten years ago, said
he did not know the answer, but
that a number of theories have
been advanced.
One is that the people using the
office might want to break their
lease. Hastings said that there is
no evidence supporting this theory,
nor does it look as if the office
wanted the publicity.
"There is also the electrical
theory," added Hastings, "but I
can't quite imagine bits of radia
tion zooming through the air and
picking up cabinets."
HASTINGS HIMSELF leans to
ward the psychokinesis theory,
which involves mind moving mat
ter.
"Often there is someone in a
group—usually a child—who has
Hostility he can't express overtly.
Although this theory doesn't ex
plain how the mind acts on mat
ter," declares Hastings, "it is at
least a start."
Hastings and a colleague plan to
run psychological tests on the of
fice staff and send the results to
J. 13. Rhine, famed parapsychol
ogist at Duke University.


AMATEUR PARAPSYCHOLOGIST Arthur Hastings,
a Stanford speech professor, investigated the re
cent disturbances in an East Bay office and con
cluded that they were not the work of ghosts, but

a case of "mind over matter." He plans to conduct
further tests and forward the results to Duke para
psychologist J. B. Rhine.
Arthur Hastings, Stanford
speech professor, still thinks there
is more to the recent "poltergeist"
(noisy ghost) incident than just a
prank.
Oakland police recently arrested
John Orfanides, 20, for causing
light bulbs to break, typewriters
to stick mysteriously, and file cab
inets to fall over in the East Bay
office where he works.
Hastings, an amateur parapsy
chologist, says that the boy was
forced into signing a confession by
the police.
PSYCHOKINESIS (mind over

matter) was at work, maintains
Hastings.
The disturbance all started in a
court reporter's office in Oakland
when typewriters stopped work
ing. Eventually light bulbs began
falling out of sockets, and entire
cabinets and telephones began to
move without any apparent ex
planation.
Then the police nailed down
their suspect and are convinced
that Orfanides performed the
tricks with strings.
There will be no trial, however,
because the court reporter's office
is convinced that the boy is not a
prankster.

WHAT THEN is the cause of
the "poltergeists?"
