# Discord in Harmony, Miss.
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL National Editor 
Stanford sociologist Dr. William
McCord and 15 other COFO volun
eers were thwarted last week in
heir attempt to set up a Freedom
School in an abandoned school
house in Harmony, Miss.
Classes are now being held, in
stead, at churches and private
homes in the Negro Community.
ARRIVING early in the week,
the 16 Project workers spent three
days cleaning up the abandoned
school and building library facil
ities.
On Friday, a "No Trespassing"
sign was put up outside the school
by the sheriff, and the school su
perintendent announced that the
COFO workers could not use the
building.
To make it more difficult for the
Negro students to attend the Free
dom School, the superintendent
ilso declared a compulsory sum
mer session for Negro high school
studentsâ€”the first such session in
history.
"THE ACTIONS were nothing
more than a clear attempt to block
'he Freedom School," McCord
said.
Rev. James Corson, Stanford
Wesley foundation minister, de
scribed Ruleville as a "hot spot" in
he COFO voter registration drive.
There has been frequent har
rassment of COFO workers, ac
cording to Corson, but nothing has
occurred more serious than threat
ening phone calls and bottles being
1 hrown through windows of Negro
homes.
GREENVILLE, fifty miles to the
southwest, "is one of the two or
three cities here that can be called
moderate by Mississippi stand
ards," Carson commented.
He was referring to the lack of
harrassment, according to Rev.
Richard Roe, Stanford minister for
the United Church of Christ and
a voter registration leader in
Greenville.
The Rev. Corson said the Negro
community in Greenville, consist
ing of approximately one-third of
the city's 30,000 residents, is "re
sponding tremendously" to the
registration drive.
He calls the project a "truly
great inspiration" to Negroes in
Greenville. He attributes much of
the project's success to coopera

tion from the non-Negro residents,
especially William H. Carter, ed
itor and publisher of the Delta
Democrat-Times.
About half of the volunteers in
the summer project are working
directly with Negro voter registra
tion. The other workers are teach
ing in Freedom Schools and Com
munity Centers.
THE SCHOOLS are designed
primarily for high school students
Instruction includes remedial
courses, such as English and his
tory, and academic subjects not
available in Mississippi high
schools.
Non-academic subjects centering
around freedom and civil rights
are also planned.
In other voter registration
events, Gibbs Kinderman, son of
the manager of Stanford Research
Institute's nuclear physics depart
ment, was attacked last week while
canvassing a Negro neighborhood
in Gulfport.

He suffered minor bruises in a
brief scuffle with a white man who
prefaced his attack by saying.
"Boy, things are fine around here,
and we don't want changes."
THE WEEKLY'S attempt to get
more recent information on the
Mississippi situation by calling
COFO headquarters Monday night
was unsuccessful. Stanford grad
uate student Margaret Rose re
ported that a Negro girl had been
shot at a voter registration rally
in Moss Point, but declined to give
further details, explaining that
COFO wanted to keep its phone
lines open.
In a call to Stanford yesterday.
News Service Director Robert
Beyers, on a leave of absence to
work on the Mississippi project,
reported the injured girl was in
fair condition and also mentioned
ihat two civil rights workers had
'.:>een beaten up in front of COFO
headquarters.
