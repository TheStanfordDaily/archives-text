# Stanford Sports May Go On TV
## 
### JIM HORNE Editor 
Four Stanford football games may be shown on closed-circuit
pay-television this fall, if USC, UCLA, and UC at Berkeley agree
to participate in an experimental 16-game program.
Subscription Television, a Pacific Coast company which will
televise the San Francisco Giant and Warrior games next year, has

been meeting with the AAWU dur
ing the past month in an effort to
add local collegiate sports to its
program log.
ATHLETIC OFFICIALS at the
three other California schools are
reportedly favorable to the plan
and are now discussing the com
pany's proposals with their re
spective University administra
tions.
Stanford officials have already
given their approval.
ACCORDING to Stanford Direc
tor of Athletics Charles Taylor,
two away games would probably
be televised in color at a cost of
about $3 per game to the home
viewer.
In addition, other less popular
sports — including basketball,
swimming, soccer, rugby, water
polo, and track—would be telecast
during the year.
WHILE emphasizing that the
plan would be on a one-year trial

basis, Taylor is optimistic about
pay-TV's future. "Only about 2,000
sets will be receiving the program
ming during this first season," ex
plains Taylor, "but it is conceiv
able that hundreds of thousands of
Bay area residents will end up
subscribing."
THE NCAA has given its sanc
tion to such pay-television experi
ments, as long as they don't con
flict with the regular NBC region
al and national telecasts.
NBC paid the collegiate associa
tion $13 million last season for the
right to lelevise weekly games be
'ween NCAA schools.
A successful showing by pay
television, however, could jeop
ardize free viewing of collegiate
sports.
SPONSORS of the NBC pro
gram are reportedly hesitant to
compete with pay-television, for
fear that a large selection of pay
as-you-see games would reduce the
number of people watching the
commercially - supported produc
tions.
IN ANY CASE, this fall's limited
schedule would involve only
AAWU conference games. Accord
ing to Taylor, the Big Game would
not be included in the program,
leaving six possible games, three
at home and three away.
The two away games would pre
sumably be selected from among
Washington State at Pullman
(Sept. 19), University of Califor
nia at Los Angeles (Oct. 3), and
ihe University of Oregon at Eu
gene (Oct. 31).
AAWU games at home include
Washington (Oct. 17), USC (Nov.
7) and Oregon State (Nov. 14).
