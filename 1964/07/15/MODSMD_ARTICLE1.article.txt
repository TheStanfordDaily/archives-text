# TWO STUDENTS INJURED
## Workers In Dixie Are Optimistic 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL 
Despite numerous injuries, including a bombing and several beat
ings last week, civil rights workers in Mississippi feel they have made
a successful impact on the state during the first month of their cam
paign.
COFO workers in Jackson, Miss, told the Weekly Monday night

that the number of participants
in the Freedom Schools is nearly
double what was expected. The
volunteers are also optimistic
about their work in voter regis
tration and report favorable re
sponses from the Negro com
munity.
STANFORD University News
Service Director, Robert Beyers,
spending a month's leave of ab
sence in Mississippi, reports a
"strong response" to the freedom
schools with "enrollment well
over 2,000."
The Schools," reported Beyers
"are fanning out, even into Mc-
Comb and Neshoba County (Phil
adelphia)."
"HARASSMENT is increasing,"
he related. "There have been
about fifty arrests, mostly on
traffic violation, in an effort to
slow things down."
Stanford senior Dennis Sween
ey, injured in last week's McComb
Freedom House bombing, told the
Weekly: "We now have a Free
dom School lined up. Spirits are
good and we have a feeling the
Negro community is behind us."
Allard K. Lowenstein, civil
rights leader and former Stanford
professor is now in Jackson, sur
veying the project.
LOWENSTEIN said he had vis
ited Stanford student Carolyn
Egan, now teaching five subjects
in a Greenwood Freedom School.
She described continual harass
ment of the workers, including
spitting.
A WHITE MAN was recently
arrested there for beating a
Negro girl.
At the police station, the sher
iff, sharpening his knife while
listening to the complaint and the
defense, fined the man $25.
The man then left the station
with the sheriff.
WHEN MISS EGAN and her as
sociates left five minutes later,
they found all four tires on their
car slashed.
Miss Egan, together with Stan
ford students Brett Breneman
and Howard Iriyama and other

Project workers in Greenwood,
will participate in a Freedom Day
tomorrow.
They plan to march on the
county courthouse in an attempt
to register Negroes to vote.

Strelitz, West Coast coordinator
of the Project, has been working
in Washington, D.C. for the Free
dom Democratic Party, a group
organized to challenge the all
white Democratic organization in
Ihe state. She has been a congres
sional liason, making arrange
ments for Congressmen to visit
Mississippi.
Stanford senior Larry Spears,
beaten by two men with iron bars
last week in Hattiesburg, has
vowed "to continue the voter
registration work all summer."
THE ATTACK makes us all
the more aware how important
our work is," Spears said.
Attempts to register Negroes
to vote "are going well, despite
threats," said Spears. "Negroes
are told they will lose their jobs,
and they won't get welfare checks
for six months if their names ap
pear in the newspaper."
"This is direct harassment," ex
plained Spears, "because when a
Negro registers his name is print
ed in the paper for two weeks be
fore the registration is complete."
Another Stanford student work
ing on voter registration in Hat
tiesburg also reported that "the
voter registration work is going
very well."
The student, Stuart Rawlings,
described an attempt to register
10 Negroes.
"ONE OF THEM was a crip
pled woman about 70. All four of
us were needed to carry her up
the courthouse steps. News of
this woman's appearance traveled
all over town."
Hattiesburg, a city of about
25,000 whites and 15,000 Negroes,
"had only a handful of Negro
voters a year ago," said Rawlings.
"That number has now risen to
about two hundred."
OVER 1500 have attempted to
register in the past year, accord
ing to Rawlings.
"A Negro usually fails the reg
istration test the first four or
five times. Negro doctors and
teachers have failed consistently,
but white citizens with no high
school education almost always
pass."

chats with (left to right) Richard Roe, Stanford min

graduate student Margaret Rose; and James Cor
son, Stanford Wesley foundation minister. The

four, pictured in front of COFO headquarters, are
among the forty Stanford students and ten faculty
and staff members working on the Mississippi
Summer Project.
Despite numerous injuries, including a bombing and several beat
ings last week, civil rights workers in Mississippi feel they have made
a successful impact on the state during the first month of their cam
paign.
COFO workers in Jackson, Miss, told the Weekly Monday night

that the number of participants
in the Freedom Schools is nearly
double what was expected. The
volunteers are also optimistic
about their work in voter regis
tration and report favorable re
sponses from the Negro com
munity.
STANFORD University News
Service Director, Robert Beyers,
spending a month's leave of ab
sence in Mississippi, reports a
"strong response" to the freedom
schools with "enrollment well
over 2,000."
The Schools," reported Beyers
"are fanning out, even into Mc-
Comb and Neshoba County (Phil
adelphia)."
"HARASSMENT is increasing,"
he related. "There have been
about fifty arrests, mostly on
traffic violation, in an effort to
slow things down."
Stanford senior Dennis Sween
ey, injured in last week's McComb
Freedom House bombing, told the
Weekly: "We now have a Free
dom School lined up. Spirits are
good and we have a feeling the
Negro community is behind us."
Allard K. Lowenstein, civil
rights leader and former Stanford
professor is now in Jackson, sur
veying the project.
LOWENSTEIN said he had vis
ited Stanford student Carolyn
Egan, now teaching five subjects
in a Greenwood Freedom School.
She described continual harass
ment of the workers, including
spitting.
A WHITE MAN was recently
arrested there for beating a
Negro girl.
At the police station, the sher
iff, sharpening his knife while
listening to the complaint and the
defense, fined the man $25.
The man then left the station
with the sheriff.
WHEN MISS EGAN and her as
sociates left five minutes later,
they found all four tires on their
car slashed.
Miss Egan, together with Stan
ford students Brett Breneman
and Howard Iriyama and other

Project workers in Greenwood,
will participate in a Freedom Day
tomorrow.
They plan to march on the
county courthouse in an attempt
to register Negroes to vote.
STANFORD graduate 11 en e
Strelitz, West Coast coordinator
of the Project, has been working
in Washington, D.C. for the Free
dom Democratic Party, a group
organized to challenge the all
white Democratic organization in
Ihe state. She has been a congres
sional liason, making arrange
ments for Congressmen to visit
Mississippi.
Stanford senior Larry Spears,
beaten by two men with iron bars
last week in Hattiesburg, has
vowed "to continue the voter
registration work all summer."
THE ATTACK makes us all
the more aware how important
our work is," Spears said.
Attempts to register Negroes
to vote "are going well, despite
threats," said Spears. "Negroes
are told they will lose their jobs,
and they won't get welfare checks
for six months if their names ap
pear in the newspaper."
"This is direct harassment," ex
plained Spears, "because when a
Negro registers his name is print
ed in the paper for two weeks be
fore the registration is complete."
Another Stanford student work
ing on voter registration in Hat
tiesburg also reported that "the
voter registration work is going
very well."
The student, Stuart Rawlings,
described an attempt to register
10 Negroes.
"ONE OF THEM was a crip
pled woman about 70. All four of
us were needed to carry her up
the courthouse steps. News of
this woman's appearance traveled
all over town."
Hattiesburg, a city of about
25,000 whites and 15,000 Negroes,
"had only a handful of Negro
voters a year ago," said Rawlings.
"That number has now risen to
about two hundred."
OVER 1500 have attempted to
register in the past year, accord
ing to Rawlings.
"A Negro usually fails the reg
istration test the first four or
five times. Negro doctors and
teachers have failed consistently,
but white citizens with no high
school education almost always
pass."

ing to Rawlings.
"A Negro usually fails the reg
istration test the first four or
five times. Negro doctors and
teachers have failed consistently,
but white citizens with no high
school education almost always
pass."

Despite numerous injuries, including a bombing and several beat
ings last week, civil rights workers in Mississippi feel they have made
a successful impact on the state during the first month of their cam
paign.
COFO workers in Jackson, Miss, told the Weekly Monday night

that the number of participants
in the Freedom Schools is nearly
double what was expected. The
volunteers are also optimistic
about their work in voter regis
tration and report favorable re
sponses from the Negro com
munity.
STANFORD University News
Service Director, Robert Beyers,
spending a month's leave of ab
sence in Mississippi, reports a
"strong response" to the freedom
schools with "enrollment well
over 2,000."
The Schools," reported Beyers
"are fanning out, even into Mc-
Comb and Neshoba County (Phil
adelphia)."
"HARASSMENT is increasing,"
he related. "There have been
about fifty arrests, mostly on
traffic violation, in an effort to
slow things down."
Stanford senior Dennis Sween
ey, injured in last week's McComb
Freedom House bombing, told the
Weekly: "We now have a Free
dom School lined up. Spirits are
good and we have a feeling the
Negro community is behind us."
Allard K. Lowenstein, civil
rights leader and former Stanford
professor is now in Jackson, sur
veying the project.
LOWENSTEIN said he had vis
ited Stanford student Carolyn
Egan, now teaching five subjects
in a Greenwood Freedom School.
She described continual harass
ment of the workers, including
spitting.
A WHITE MAN was recently
arrested there for beating a
Negro girl.
At the police station, the sher
iff, sharpening his knife while
listening to the complaint and the
defense, fined the man $25.
The man then left the station
with the sheriff.
WHEN MISS EGAN and her as
sociates left five minutes later,
they found all four tires on their
car slashed.
Miss Egan, together with Stan
ford students Brett Breneman
and Howard Iriyama and other

Project workers in Greenwood,
will participate in a Freedom Day
tomorrow.
They plan to march on the
county courthouse in an attempt
to register Negroes to vote.
STANFORD graduate 11 en e
Strelitz, West Coast coordinator
of the Project, has been working
in Washington, D.C. for the Free
dom Democratic Party, a group
organized to challenge the all
white Democratic organization in
Ihe state. She has been a congres
sional liason, making arrange
ments for Congressmen to visit
Mississippi.
Stanford senior Larry Spears,
beaten by two men with iron bars
last week in Hattiesburg, has
vowed "to continue the voter
registration work all summer."
THE ATTACK makes us all
the more aware how important
our work is," Spears said.
Attempts to register Negroes
to vote "are going well, despite
threats," said Spears. "Negroes
are told they will lose their jobs,
and they won't get welfare checks
for six months if their names ap
pear in the newspaper."
"This is direct harassment," ex
plained Spears, "because when a
Negro registers his name is print
ed in the paper for two weeks be
fore the registration is complete."
Another Stanford student work
ing on voter registration in Hat
tiesburg also reported that "the
voter registration work is going
very well."
The student, Stuart Rawlings,
described an attempt to register
10 Negroes.
"ONE OF THEM was a crip
pled woman about 70. All four of
us were needed to carry her up
the courthouse steps. News of
this woman's appearance traveled
all over town."
Hattiesburg, a city of about
25,000 whites and 15,000 Negroes,
"had only a handful of Negro
voters a year ago," said Rawlings.
"That number has now risen to
about two hundred."
OVER 1500 have attempted to
register in the past year, accord
ing to Rawlings.

istration test the first four or
