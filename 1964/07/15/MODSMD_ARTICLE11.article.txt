# Rare Kidney Transplant At Med Center
## 
### 
A mother and her daughter have participated in a unique kidney
transplant operation at the Stanford Medical Center which may
make medical history.
Mrs. Ruth Bell, 23, of Oroville, victim of a fatal kidney disease,
received a healdiy kidney from her mother, Mrs. VVilma Davis, 52,

'also of Oroville.
SURGEONS are using a tech
nique developed by Dr. Samuel
Kountz, former resident in sur
gery at the medical center, which
combats the "rejection mecha
nism" taking place following or
gan transplants.
The Kountz method has been
used with 100 per cent success
with dogs, but the Bell-Davis
transplant is reportedly the first
with human beings.
The problem facing doctors at
tempting organ transplants is that
the human body rejects tissue
from another person.
THE KOUNTZ technique en
ables the surgeons to obtain mea
surements of the kidney blood
supply during the functional pex , -
lod of the graft.
The new method predicts when
rejection anti-bodies are gener
ated in the body and provides the
guide for controlling the dosage
of immunosuppressive drugs.
During the experiments with
dogs, researchers found that a
fall in blood flow was the first
sign that the rejection mechanism
had started. By administering
drugs, surgeons are able to re
store the blood flow.
IN 1960, surgeons performed a
similar kidney transplant, but the
patients involved were identical
twins, a much simpler operation.
Kountz is now on the staff of
the San Mateo County hospital
and did not participate in the
experiment. The Medical Center
did not identify the surgeons who
performed the transplant.
