### 
Adam W. Harbcr, assistant pro
fessor of sociology, survived a
60-foot dive into shoulder-depth
water from a Marin County
bridge last Sunday morning.
He was rescued from the
slough-like body of water by a
sheriff's patrol boat and treated
for exposure at Marin General
Hospital, before being sent to
Napa State Hospital for psychi
atric examination.
Harber told rescuers he was
"just going for a swim," but po
lice called his jump from the free
way bridge a suicide attempt.
Deputy Sheriff Wade Powell
said he was on the bridge exam
ining Harbor's empty car when
he heard a weak cry from the
depths below.
Deputies in a boat later found
Harber wading through the muck
toward shore.
