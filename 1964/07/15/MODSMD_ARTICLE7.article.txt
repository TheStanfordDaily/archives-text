# Students Plan Corfu Resort
## 
### 
Three 1964 graduates of the
School of Business have launched
a million-dollar overseas hotel
right from the classroom.
THE TRIO parlayed Prof. John
Ewing's course in international
business into plans for a 125-room
resort hotel on the Island of Cor
fu, in the lonian Sea off the
northwest coast of Greece.
The three—John A. Dare Jr.
Bukk G. Carleton, and Robert R.
Richards, have already applied
for a $450,000 loan from an agen
cy of the Greek government.
They expect an additional $500,-
000 from private subscription and
plan to secure a straight bank
loan of $72,000 to round out their
necessary capital of $1,022,000.
EWING OFFERED his class a
choice of four countries to re
search for business potential—
Greece, Curacao, Ireland, and
Spain—and the three chose
Greece.
In the course of examining, de
veloping and recommending the
various elements needed to com
plete their project, the students
went far beyond the classroom.
They wound up signing a con
tract with Consul General Bou
phidis to plan, finance, construct,
and operate a resort hotel on the
island.
THEY INTENDED to incorpo
rate in Greece as the "Kerkyra
Development Corporation," a

stock-issuing corporation. (Kerk
yra is the Greek name for Corfu.)
Ewing noted: "While we gen
erally emphasize the case method

approach in instruction, we en
courage the real life situation.
Because these three were dealing
with the man who had the prop
erty, they were in the real world
from the very beginning. But
they still had to develop their
information through ingenuity
and intelligence."
That they did.
THEY PUT together a 72-page
report which indicated that their
hotel-resort plan would launch
them on successful business ca
reers less than five years after
graduation.
The hotel will be located on a
3.6 acre plot four miles north of
the city of Corfu.
It will have 440 feet of water
front and access to a private un
derground stream for fresh water.
THE HOTEL will be built in
contemporary style from native
stone and other local materials.
Plans will be ready in October for
125 double rooms with bath, all
air conditioned, oriented for max
imum view.
