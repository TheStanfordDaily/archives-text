# Montessori Study In San Francisco
## 
### 
A special three-day "San Fran
cisco Conference on Montessori,"
will be held on July 31 through
August 2 at the Mark Hopkins
Hotel, it was announced today by
Thomas Laughlin, founder of the
Sophia Montessori School in
Santa Monica.
The series of lectures and dem
onstrations will explore the tech
niques and principles of the Mon
tessori approach to learning.
The Montessori method bases
its teachings on the observations
that children—beginning at the
age of three—have a passion for
learning and self-discipline.
Further, when encouraged
rather than discouraged, Dr. Mon
tessori found that children will
discipline themselves with a min
imum of adult supervision, and,
when left to themselves in an
environment that physically fits
them, normal children have the
dedication to discovery of adult
geniuses.
Laughlin notes that "average
children, who enroll in an ac
credited Montessori school at the
age of three or four, will usually
be working on a college level in
most academic areas by the age
of 12."
