# FREEDOM DEMOCRATS
## Party Will Challenge Mississippi Delegates 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL National Editor 
William McCord, professor of
history, and June graduate Ilene
Strelitz, working for the Missis
sippi Freedom Democratic Party,
are "very optimistic" about un
seating the Dixiecrat delegation
to the Democratic National Con
vention.
REPORTING to the Weekly by
telephone from Jackson, Miss.,
Monday night, Miss Strelitz was
enthused "about Paul Johnson and
his racist group not getting seat
ed."

"The next goal," she said, "is to
get ourselves seated, and we've
met success in every state conven
tion we've gone to."
"The concomi'ants of our group's
sealing are outstanding, and the
seating of House members elected
on the same basis of disenfran
chisement can be questioned," she
explained.
THE FREEDOM Democratic
Party, a part of the Mississippi
Summer Project, was organized as
a convention challenge to the exist
ing all-white Democratic organiza
tion in the state. The Party claims
to better represent the whole state,
because of inclusion of Negro
voters in choosing its delegates.
"SUPPORT ON Capitol Hill is
very strong for our work," she
said.
"We have had excellent help
from Congressmen and Senators;
everything in our Washington of
fice is done with their advice and
direction."
She had also been working with
•he Congressmen of the eight
states which have passed resolu
tions "telling their delegates to
urge, support, and initiate appro
priate action for the seating of the
iemocratically-selected, integrated
Freedom Democratic Party dele
gations."
RESOLUTIONS have been pas
sed. Either in stale conventions or
by the state executive committees,
by the Democratic parties of Mich
igan, Wisconsin, California, Mass
achusetts, Oregon, New York,
Minnesota, and the District of
Columbia.
