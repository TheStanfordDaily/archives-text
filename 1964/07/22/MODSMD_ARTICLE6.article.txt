# Lowenstein Cites 'Change' In South
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL National Editor 
Change—once seen by both the White and Negro communities
as impossible—has come this year to Mississippi because of external
intervention, a large part of which came from Stanford.
This is the view of Allard K. Lowenstein, leader of last fall's
Aaron lienry for Governor campaign and an adviser to the current
Mississippi Summer Project.
THE NORTH CAROLINA professor, a former member of the Stan
ford faculty, was on campus Monday.
"Until this year," says Lowenstein, "Mississippi was completely
segregated. Now there has been a small amount of integration which
has had a great subconscious effect on Mississippi whites.
"NO LONGER do individual whites have to uphold their honor by
keeping the state totally segregated," explains Lowenstein. "More
importantly, for the first time the possibility and now the inevitability
of change have become real."
This change could not have taken place without outside assistance
to the Negro community, he maintains, because Mississippi Negroes
do not possess fundamental rights like the vote, freedom of speech
and assembly.
THE SUMMER PROJECT is aiming in its Freedom Schools to equip
the Negroes with basic knowledge so they can qualify to vote. "The
ballot is a symbol of respect and equality for the Negro," says Lowen
stein.
The mere presence of white volunteers has boosted the morale of
the Negro community, according to Lowenstein. "That whites can
work together with Negroes is something new to both the Negro and
the white communities. It is a source of hope for the Negroes and a
sign of inevitable change to the whites."
"There is a point," says Lowenstein, "where a difference of degree
becomes a difference of kind."
"STANFORD HAS contributed markedly to increasing the degree
of outside intervention in Mississippi so that civil rights efforts there
have changed in kind."
Lowenstein supports this by recalling that Stanford sent $1000 a day
to Mississippi last fall during the Aaron Henry campaign, that a dozen
Stanford students went there to work and that an additional 200 were
ready on buses to leave.
Of the 1000 volunteers in the Mississippi Summer Project, 50 are
from Stanford.
Lowenstein likens the volunteers to "a domestic Peace Corps, with
one great difference: They are working in a hostile environment."
Lowenstein praised the selflessness of the volunteers: "They have
no motive of personal gain, are sacrificing a summer, and pay their
own way."
HE LAUDED the work of University News Service Director Robert
Beyers, just returned from a month in Mississippi during which he
directed public relations for the Project.
"He made a great personal investment of time and money. If the
most selfless and valuable person in the Project during the past month
were chosen, he would be near the top."
Lowenstein also cited Ilene Strelitz, Stanford graduate and West
Coast Coordinator of the Project for "Bringing to many campuses an
awareness of the civil rights movement and the students' role in it."
Lowenstein sees three additional effects of Stanford students' par
ticipation in Mississippi:
First, Stanford's efforts have "given a new perspective to the na
tional education community by showing a new way to funnel student
idealism."
Second, students returning home have effects on their communities.
Third, the students have changed Stanford's image from "a rich
man's finishing school" to "A university of concerned students with
a commitment to others."
