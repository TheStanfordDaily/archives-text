Editor, Summer Weekly:
I wish to correct some errors
in the article of July 8 about the
Stanford Committee for KPFA.
1. KPFA is not a "pacifist sta
tion;" it is an open forum com
mitted to no ideology.
2. Our organization is not pri
marily designed "to raise money
for KPFA," since under Stanford
rules for student-faculty organi
zations we cannot do so without
special permission. Rather we
hope to make KPFA better known
on campus, and to contribute to
and participate in the station's
activities.
3. Mr. Edward Colby is not "of
the music department," but with
the Archive of Recorded Sound.
He attended a meeting of the
KPFA Subscribers' Interim Com
mittee held with two members of
Pacifica Foundation's Board of
Directors. It was reported there
that a questionnaire sent to sub
scribers, and answered by only a
small proportion, showed two
thirds of the respondents favor
ing the formation of a subscrib
ers' organizationâ€”not necessarily
in order to "help determine sta
tion programming," as your arti
cle stated.
4. So far as we know, we have
no access to any "Viet Cong
movies." It was suggested at one
of our meetings by someone other
than Nick that we try to obtain
movies about Viet Nam.
5. I want to emphasize that,
like KPFA itself, our organization
welcomes any members of the
Stanford community regardless
of his political or other views. We
arc only partisan in our support
of KPFA.
Emile If. Goodman
President, Stanford Committee
for KPFA
