# Aesthetic Poles For Woodside
## 
### 
The power lines to Stanford's
Linear Accelerator will be car
ried on 60 to 70 foot tubulai
poles and not 125-foot towers.
This decision was reached last
week by Atomic Energy Commis
sion officials who are attempting
to prevent the scarring of the
scenic hillsides in nearby Wood
side.
THE COMMISSION earlier had
threatened to build the line to the
Accelerator on towers if Wood
side and San Mateo County did
not grant use permits allowing
the AEC to build the high voltage
line.
The use permits were denied
and the AEC started condemna
tion proceedings to obtain the
right-of-way.
BUT PAUL N. McCLOSKEY,
attorney for the Save Our Sky
lines Committee regards the deci
sion as only "one small victory in
this long war."
The SOS Committee is seeking
to force the AEC to install under
ground lines to the atom-smasher.
Woodside has been granted per
mission by the courts to carry its
fight to block the overhead lines
to the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Federal District Judge Albert
C. Wollenberg has already given
the government complete posses
sion of nearly five acres of the
town.
THE AEC LETTER maintains
that "a minimum of foilage" will
be cut to make space for the tubu
lar poles.
"The design permitting the low
est profile and constituting the
most esthetically desirable of al
alternatives was selected by the
commission," said the letter, "not
withstanding the fact that other
types of installation were gener
ally more desirable from the proj
ect's standpoint alone."
