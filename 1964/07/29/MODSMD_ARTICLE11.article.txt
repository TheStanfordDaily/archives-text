# BEYERS:
## Long Struggle Ahead 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL National Editor 
"This is a massive situation
hat will take years to correct,
here are some hopeful signs, but
he struggle is not going to end
.1 one summer."
These are views on the Mis
;issippi Summer Project voiced
jy University News Service Di
rector Robert Beyers, recently re
turned from a month as director
of public relations for the cam
paign.
THE HOPEFUL signs, accord
ing to Beyers, include:
• Enrollment at some 35 Free
dom Schools is 2,000, "double
what we expected." Some schools,
where Negro children have "a
fighting chance" to catch up in
basic subjects, will probably be
continued all year. The Freedom
School program will be expanded
next summer.
• National publicity has
"branded the state, its people, and
its lawless practices."

• "For perhaps the first timp
rofessional people — doctors
iwyers, teachers, ministers—an
1 e e t in g Southern professiona
oople. The encounter, without ;
ird sell, may help to change th
imate of fear and oppression."
• The white moderates in Mi;
issippi have begun to make ther.
jives heard since the enactmen
112 the civil rights law.
They have placed newspapc
advertisements calling for "p:
cience and understanding" in a(
ceptance of the new law, have
helped rebuild bombed Negro
churches and are discussing sup
port of the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party's effort to un
seat the all-white delegation to
the Democratic Convention.
• The Negro community's out
look has improved; "Negroes foi
the first time in many cases arc
seeing whites from outside pay
ing religious witness to the life
of the black man in Mississippi.'
BUT THERE IS also disappoint
ment and failure, says Beyers.
"We would send 70 eligible Ne
groes down to the Court House to
register to vote and at the end ol
the day only three or four would
have been signed up," he explains.
"The main problem now is to
get adequate law enforcement, so
the killings, bombings, and beat
ings will stop.
"The local authorities are fre
quently no help. In some cities,
police vanish when the rights
workers come to town. They show
up in force after the beatings
have been inflicted," Beyers re
lates.

"The FBI proved to be very co
operative. By the time I left, they
had two men in our office doing
nothing but questioning people
who reported threats and attacks.
But this was only after the Phila
dephia incident.
"THE FBI cannot intervene,"
Beyers explains, "until after a
crime has been committed. Pre
vention is still in the hands of
the local police and the citizenry
which includes a hard core of 15
to 20 percent rednecks who may
drive trucks with mounted guns
and radio equipment."
