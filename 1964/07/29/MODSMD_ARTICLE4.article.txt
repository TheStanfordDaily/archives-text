# $1 MILLION SLOAN GRANT
## Work Begins On Business Building 
### 
Construction is now underway on the $5,247,-
000 Graduate School of Business building, lo
cated next to Memorial Auditorium and across
the street from Hoover Tower.
The building will be ready for occupancy in
two years.
THE ALFRED P. SLOAN Foundation an
nounced last week a $1 million gift to help finance
construction of the new building.
The gift will provide for the Sloan Hall of Man
agement Education.
University officials signed a $4,233,300 construc
tion contract with Engstrum and Nourse of San
Francisco last week.
The new building will consolidate all teaching
and research activities of the School, which are cur
rently conducted in five different campus locations.
THE FAMILY of the late William P. Roth, San
Francisco and Hawaii shipping executive, provided
$1 million for the Roth Center for Advanced Man
agement Education in the new four-story building.
The new facilities will permit the School to ex

ported the Stanford-Sloan Program, which brings
together Ph.D. candidates and promising business
managers for a full year of intensive study and
research at the School.
Another Sloan Foundation grant of $1 million,
announced last year, has made possible construc
tion of the Sloan Mathematics Center in the former
Physics Corner of the Main Quadrangle.
This project is scheduled for completion in
September.
