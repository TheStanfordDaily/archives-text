# Unstable Situation In South
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL National Editor 
"Even though Stanford stu
dents have not been recently
faced with brutal types of inci
dents, no one forgets the under
lying tenseness."
This view of the mood of the
Mississippi Summer Project is
from Stanford graduate Ilene
Strelitz, speaking to the Weekly
by telephone from Jackson, Miss.
"TO GO TO the grocery store,
or to get a hamburger," she con
tinues, "is a security and tactical
maneuver that would defy the
best of the U.S. Army. There
doesn't have to be an incident for
us to realize that this is a state
unbelievable anywhere else in the
United States."
She expressed gratitude for
the support from the Stanford
community.
"Stanford sent $500 from the
Dick Gregory concert and we re
ceived regularly checks of from
$10 to $100 from Stanford people.
"STANFORD'S SUPPORT has
proven not to be the passing fancy
some asserted it was during last
fall's Henry-for-Governor Cam
paign," she said. "Stanford's in
volvement demonstrates a certain
consistency in feeling in the stu
dent body which is unique in its
breadth."
Miss Sterlitz reported that his
tory professor Otis Pease, while
teaching at the Hattiesburg Free
dom School, had written a text
book on the history of the Negro
in politics.
COPIES ARE now being sent to
most of the Freedom Schools in
the state.
Sophomore Doug Sorensen was
the last Stanford student to be in
volved in a racial incident, ac
cording to Miss Strelitz.
On July 17, while putting up
voter registration posters in Cren
shaw he was attacked by three
whites, had his hammer stolen,
and was forced to give up filled
voter registration forms after
being thrown to the ground.
Two days later, while en route
with other workers to a mass
meeting in Crowder, he was
stopped by the town marshall,
who said: "I wish I weren't an
officer; I wish I weren't wearing
a badge; but someone has to beat
you."
MISS STRELITZ, West Coast
coordinator for the Project this
past year, also described the re
sults of the Project.
"The first session of the Free
dom Schools, now just coming to
a close, was an overwhelming
success."
"Negroes are now training to
become teachers in the schools
and the schools are to become per
manent. In addition, national
foundations have offered scholar
ships to children attending the
schools."
Another part of the Project is
the establishment of the Missis
sippi Freedom Democratic Party,
organized as a convention chal
lenge to the existing all-white
Democratic organization in the
state.
IN REACTION to the proposal
of 111. Senator Paul Douglas that
the Democratic Convention "not
accept any Mississippi delegation
or accept a hybrid of half Dixie
crat, half Freedom Democrat, she
said:
"To paraphase Abraham Lin
coln, we are dubious of the value
of a delegation that is half slave,
half free. Any compromise of this
kind is a compromise with racism
and one cannot half condone and
half condemn racism."


WATERMELON TIME-A scene like this will be re
peated Sunday afternoon at the second ASSU
sponsored Watermelon Feed. Several tons of

watermelon will be available to students, faculty
and staff at 2 p.m. in Lagunita Courtyard.

paign," she said. "Stanford's in
volvement demonstrates a certain
consistency in feeling in the stu
dent body which is unique in its
breadth."
Miss Sterlitz reported that his
tory professor Otis Pease, while
teaching at the Hattiesburg Free
dom School, had written a text
book on the history of the Negro
in politics.
COPIES ARE now being sent to
most of the Freedom Schools in
the state.
Sophomore Doug Sorensen was
the last Stanford student to be in
volved in a racial incident, ac
cording to Miss Strelitz.
On July 17, while putting up
voter registration posters in Cren
shaw he was attacked by three
whites, had his hammer stolen,
and was forced to give up filled
voter registration forms after
being thrown to the ground.
Two days later, while en route
with other workers to a mass
meeting in Crowder, he was
stopped by the town marshall,
who said: "I wish I weren't an
officer; I wish I weren't wearing
a badge; but someone has to beat
you."
MISS STRELITZ, West Coast
coordinator for the Project this
past year, also described the re
sults of the Project.
"The first session of the Free
dom Schools, now just coming to
a close, was an overwhelming
success."
"Negroes are now training to
become teachers in the schools
and the schools are to become per
manent. In addition, national
foundations have offered scholar
ships to children attending the
schools."
Another part of the Project is
the establishment of the Missis
sippi Freedom Democratic Party,
organized as a convention chal
lenge to the existing all-white
Democratic organization in the
state.
IN REACTION to the proposal
of 111. Senator Paul Douglas that
the Democratic Convention "not
accept any Mississippi delegation
or accept a hybrid of half Dixie
crat, half Freedom Democrat, she
said:
"To paraphase Abraham Lin
coln, we are dubious of the value
of a delegation that is half slave,
half free. Any compromise of this
kind is a compromise with racism
and one cannot half condone and
half condemn racism."


WATERMELON TIME-A scene like this will be re
peated Sunday afternoon at the second ASSU
sponsored Watermelon Feed. Several tons of

watermelon will be available to students, faculty
and staff at 2 p.m. in Lagunita Courtyard.

"Even though Stanford stu
dents have not been recently
faced with brutal types of inci
dents, no one forgets the under
lying tenseness."
This view of the mood of the
Mississippi Summer Project is
from Stanford graduate Ilene
Strelitz, speaking to the Weekly
by telephone from Jackson, Miss.
"TO GO TO the grocery store,
or to get a hamburger," she con
tinues, "is a security and tactical
maneuver that would defy the
best of the U.S. Army. There
doesn't have to be an incident for
us to realize that this is a state
unbelievable anywhere else in the
United States."
She expressed gratitude for
the support from the Stanford
community.
"Stanford sent $500 from the
Dick Gregory concert and we re
ceived regularly checks of from
$10 to $100 from Stanford people.
"STANFORD'S SUPPORT has
proven not to be the passing fancy
some asserted it was during last
fall's Henry-for-Governor Cam
paign," she said. "Stanford's in
volvement demonstrates a certain
consistency in feeling in the stu
