# A 						Laser Eraser For Typewriters?
## 
### 
The latest idea from the Stanford professor who proposed one
of science's newest miracle devices—the laser—is a "laser eraser."
Prof, of Physics Arthur L. Schawlow, who discovered the laser's
erasing ability while "fooling around in the lab" recently, thinks it
is "interesting but not important scientifically."
THE AMPLIFIED light of the laser, thousands of times more in
tense than sunlight, has been focused to bore holes through the hard
est substances, including diamonds, or to "spot weld" such delicate
tissues as the retina of the human eye.
Its potentials are being explored by research laboratories around
the world.
Schawlow's latest discovery occurred when he wondered what
pulses of focused laser light might do to ordinary typewritten char
acters on a sheet of white paper.
THE SPLIT-MILLISECOND light pulses, he found, removed in
dividual letters as if they had never been typed. The intense, instan
taneous heat vaporized the typewriter ink, yet left the paper com
pletely unmarked.
"Why not a laser eraser key on electric typewriters?" asked Prof.
Schawlow. "All it requires is some engineering development that
would bring the cost down.
The laser is now at the stage the airplane was in 1910, he be
lieves.
"IN 1910 the airplane could fly, but who would have believed that
someday it would carry a hundred passengers across the Atlantic
at the speed of sound?"
Schawlow is often asked about a "death ray" laser beam that
would disintegrate its target.
"I don't see why it isn't possible," he answers. "We now know
high efficiency lasers are possible at low power, and high power is
possible in a low efficiency laser.
THE STANFORD physicist believes low energy lasers will be
"extremely useful in spectroscopy for analyzing materials, or for
studying molecular structure by means of the Raman effect.
"They might also be useful in controlling chemical reactions, sug
gests Schawlow. "We should be able to heat substances or
in a selective way, causing some molecules to combine while leavin;
adjacent molecules unchanged. This could have industrial applies
tion."
One of the most interesting things about the laser is that it create
conditions of intense light and heat that do not exist in nature.
"WE ARE LEARNING that the world of matter as we know i
undergoes very interesting changes when it is thrown out of equilib
rium by these conditions.
"Perhaps this is one of the most important things about the laser.
It shakes up our ideas about the world, which is easy to think about
when it is in equilibrium.
"Light has become something not only to look with, but a palpabl
force to be reckoned with."
Prof. Schawlow's laser work has its lighter moments. He ha
built a low-power laser into a toy ray gun, with which he enliven
lectures by bursting balloons with its light beam.
NOT LONG AGO he made his first "kill" —an insect—with the to;
ray gun.
"Not with the laser beam, though," he said. "I missed with that
But I got him with the gun's 'second strike capability'—its suction
cup dart."
The laser was first suggested in 1958 by Prof. Schawlow in a pape
co-authored by Provost Charles H. Townes of MIT, inventor of the
original "maser" of high-frequency radio."


LASER RAY GUN wielded by Physics Prof. Arthur
L. Schawlow bursts the dark-colored inner "Mickey
Mouse" balloon (which absorbs light) without
breaking the transparent outer balloon (which

does not). Schawlow installed a low-energy laser
in the toy ray gun for lecture demonstrations. The
professor's latest "scientific breakthrough" is a
laser-eraser for typewriters.
