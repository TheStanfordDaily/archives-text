## 
### 
John Webster's 17th century tragedy, "The Duchess of Malfi"
is the Stanford Players' major contribution to the Summer Festival
of the Arts.
The production is playing at 8:30 p.m. nightly in the Little

Theater through Saturday.
DIRECTOR OF "The Duchess"
is William Sharp, associate pro
fessor and former head of drama
at the University of California-
Riverside campus.
Sharp, a visiting professor in
the drama department's summer
Elizabethan Theater Workshop,
believes the works of the Shake
speare contemporary, Webster,
are "greatly underrated."
"The roles of the Duchess, the
sympathetic heroine, and Bosola,
the murderous spy, are as sophis
ticated as any Shakespeare
created," Sharp feels. "I believe
this play belongs among the best
English tragedies."
THIS ELIZABETHAN tragedy
probably the one most often com
pared to Shakespeare's, is a study
of evil, corruption and suffering
within a single family.
Ruth Hunt of Mountain View
will play the famous Duchess. A
versatile actress, Miss Hunt drew
critical praise earlier this year
for her performance in the Stan
ford productions of "Long Day's
Journey into Night," "Hamlet,"
and "Guys and Dolls."
