# SLAC Reaches Half-way Point
## Accelerator Should Be Ready In August, 1966 
### 
Construction of the Stanford 1
Linear Accelerator, America's
biggest and most ambitious in- •
strument for nuclear research,
has reached the half-way point
on schedule and within its budget,
according to the director of the
project.
Prof. Wolfgang K. H. Panof
sky, head of a staff of 774 which
is building the $114 million linear
electron accelerator under con
tract with the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission, anticipates comple
tion of the machine in two years.
"Two miles of trench for the
accelerator have been fully ex
cavated," he reported. "All con
struction started from the west
end, and the entire concrete un
derground accelerator housing
now has been poured.
"Two-thirds of this housing
has been covered with shielding
earth, and nearly half of that to
he full 25-foot depth." On the
surface of the ground, a full 1,000
feet of the klystron gallery (to be
a 10,000-foot-long building when
finished) have been constructed
and occupied.
Five of the 14 buildings have
been completed and are now oc
cupied by about 550 people. Other
staff, including Dr. Panofsky, are
still using temporary quarters on
the Stanford campus.
WHILE construction for the
accelerator and its supporting
staff proceeds steadily, SLAC
engineers, scientists and techni
cians are busy building the ma
chine itself.
Nearly all the accelerator de
sign and development work is be
ing done by the Center's staff.
"Over 1000 feet of the 10,000
feet of four-inch copper accelera
tor tube have been fabricated in
SLAC facilities," said Dr. Panof
sky. "Installation of the first 320
feet in the underground housing
will begin this month. Manufac
ture of the tube itself is proceed
ing at about 10-20 feet per day."
"SUBCONTRACTORS have
been installing utilities since
May in the westernmost 1,000 feet
of klystron gallery and accelera
tor housing," continued the
SLAC director. "For the start of
accelerator installation this
month, we have formed a tes'
team to coordinate and check
each sector as it is finished.
The first such tests will begin
this month. "We will reach a
most important milestone when
we accelerate electrons through
I the first 600 feet in tests expected

before the end of the year," said
Panofsky.
"All accelerator equipment
will be installed by the end of
1965. Final tests of the system,
including producing a main elec
tron beam, are scheduled for June
1966."
ANOTHER YEAR of shake
down tests to "tune up" the ac
celerator will ensue before physi
cists begin full-scale research
with the big machine. They will

use it as a kind of "super micro
scope" to peer into the nucleus
of the atom.
It is impossible to see nuclear
particles, but by shooting the ac
celerator's high-energy electrons
at nuclear targets and observing
the angles at which they are de
flected, the physicists can deter
mine the size, shape, and other
characteristics of the particles
which make up the matter of the
entire universe.


TWO-MILE TUSE—Underground housing for the linear accelerator is this
10,000 foot-long tube of rigid steel and concrete. After it is covered with
25'feet of earth shielding, scientists and engineers will be able to work in
the klystron gallery on the surface while the accelerator is in operation. A
full 1000 feet of the Klystron gallery is now constructed.


SLAC POWER LINES—Tubular steel poles, superimposed by an artist
on this photograph of the foothills behind the accelerator, will carry
power to the $114 million project. Residents of the nearby com
munity of Woodside contend that the poles will destroy the aesthetic
scenery of the area and are waging a lengthy court battle for under
nronnrl lines.


ADMINISTRATION BUILDINGS—The Administration and Engineering Build
ing is located at the South end of the two-mile long accelerator, just off
Sand Hill Road. Over 550 members of the SLAC crew have already moved
into this and four other buildings but Project head Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky
and several other members of the staff are still on campus.


AERIAL PHOTO—Electrons will start at the far end of the two-mile
accelerator and strike nuclear targets in end station buildings to be
constructed in the foreground. Administration buildings and labs
are visible in the right foreground. The first tests should begin in
several weeks.
