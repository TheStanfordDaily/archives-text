# U.S.S. INDIANA
## Old Battleship Parts Will Shield Radiation 
### 
Surplus war materials, includ
ing parts of the Cruiser Vicks
burg and the Battleship Indiana,
will become part of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator.
Discarded 16-inch naval guns
armorplate, 155-mm field pieces
and surplus iron, s'eel and lead
will help block radiation in the
giant research instrument's "end
station" buildings.
SOME WILL be cut up, some
placed intact in concrcte wall s
floors, and roofs of the buildings
This will increase density of the
radiation shielding in areas where
the high-energy electrons bom
bard nuclear targets to provide
more knowledge about funda
mental particles of matter.
Radiation over most of th e
accelerator's length will be safel}

shielded by 25 feet of earth, the
cheapest moans of protection.
Scattering of electrons in target
areas will produce more intense
radiation, however, and requires
greater density in the shielding.
IN ALL, officials said, they are
trying to acquire about 50,000
tons of surplus steel and lead.
The Indiana alone will contribute
7,000 tons of armorplate.
They will get 20 surplus 16-
inch guns at the Navy's Dahl
gren (Va.) Proving Ground—a
total of 18 guns weighing 100
tons apiece. These will be cut up
into nine-foot, 20-ton chunks be
fore being buried in tlie floors.
ARMORPLATE will be cut and
laminated into massive blocks of
metal, five to 50 tons each, of
various shnpes and sizes. The
155-mm guns, 300 in all, will be
cast intact into the concrete.
