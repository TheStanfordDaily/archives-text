# New Daily 'Shack' Nears Completion
## The 						Daily Shack—1922-1963 
### 

STORKE PUBLICATIONS BUILD
ING—Workers will be putting the
final touches on the building next
week. The $360,000 structure will
house the Daily, Quad, Sequoia,
and Chaparral. It will be ready
for occupancy on September 1.


BUILDING DONOR-Thomas M.
Storke, Pulitzer-prize winning
publisher-editor of the Santa Bar
bara News Press, contributed
$250,000 toward construction of
the $360,000 publications build
ing. Storke was a graduate of
Stanford in 1898 and has served
on the Alumni Advisory Council.


END OF AN ERA—The door of the
dilapidated Chaparral office will
swing shut for the last time next
month as the Old Boy packs his
coffin across the street to the new
Storke Building.


OLD DAILY SHACK—For forty years Daily staff members struggled
to meet deadlines in this historic edifice. Described by a former
staffer as a "campus center of romance, intrigue, and intellectual
ferment," the building rested on the present site of the new Storke
Building.


OLD PUBLICATIONS SHACK-For many years, the
Quad and Chappie have made this old frame
building their home. The Daily set up operations
in the structure after their old shack was razed
last November to make way for the new Storke

Building. The building also houses the University
Duplicating Service and, among other things, will
be partitioned for Geophysics student offices next
year.


HALLOWED HALLS—A night editor and two reporters put out an
edition of the 1959 Daily in the old Daily shack. Like the soon-to-be
completed Storke Building, the structure was conveniently located
adjacent to the Stanford Press. The new building and the Press
Building will be connected, permitting easy access to the Daily print
ing facilities.
