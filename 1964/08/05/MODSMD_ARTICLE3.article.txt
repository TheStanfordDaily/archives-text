TWO HUGE CRANES lift a 57-ton gas tank for the
Van de Graaff accelerator into place. The tank
rests next to the Varian Laboratory of Physics and
holds insulating gas for high voltage electricity

equipment. The tank forms a part of a $1.5 million
grant from the National Science Foundation for
a research program into low-energy atomic struc
tures.
