# Doctors Successful In Kidney Operation
## 
### 
An Oroville woman who received a healthy kidney from her
mother in a historic operation at the Medical Center last month,
left Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital last week in satisfactory condition.
Mrs. Ruth Bell, 22, a victim of chronic kidney failure, received
a Wirlnpv frnm Vipr K2-vfinr-nld mnflipr Mrc Wilrrm D;ivi<j nlsn

of Oroville. The operation was<
performed July 10 and took 15
minutes.
SURGEONS at the hospital
said that the present state of this

operation is highly experimental.
The operation can only be done
after detailed studies of the bio
logical relationship between donor
and recipient and of the various
immunoligcal problems.
"We were justified in conduct
ing this operation," the surgeons
said, "because we feel we have
devised a method which enables
us to treat the patient with lower
and safer dosages of the power
ful drugs that help prevent the re
jection action.
"Higher dosages of these drugs
frequently result in severe infec
tion because of the depressing
effect on the bacteriological de
fenses of the body."
WHEN ORGANS are trans
planted from one person to an
other the host or recipient tends
to treat the grafted or borrowed
organ as a foreign invader and
marshals forces to reject it.
Monitoring of the rejection
process had so far been inade
quate and was one of the major
obstacles in the practical trans
plantation of organs.
But last June, at the American
Medical Association convention
in San Francisco, a Stanford
medical research team reported
that it had found a reliable
method which had given them a
better warning of when to inject
drugs to suppress the rejection
mechanism.
THE TECHNIQUE was devel
oped after more than a year of
studies on experimental animals
by Dr. Samuel Kountz, Dr Don
ald R. Laub. residents in surgery,
and Dr. Roy Cohn, professor of
surgery.
