# Choral Workshop Presents 'II Festino'
## 
### 
A fully-staged and costumed performance of the Italian work
"11 Festino" will highlight a program of madrigals from the Eng
lish and Italian Renaissance at 8:30 p.m. Friday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
According to Prof. Ilarold Schmidt, "the first part of the pro
gram is designed to give a picture of English music between 1558

and 1685 and to show how it was<
influenced by the Italians."
TO ILLUSTRATE English mu
sic Schmidt has chosen selections
from Elizabethean arias and ma
drigals and from Shakespeare's
sonnets.
Presentation of the Italian "II
Festino," written in 1608, com
prises the second half of the eve
ning's program.
DIRECTOR ACTOR Robert
Loper will narrate the major
work and will be featured in read
ings of the era's lyric poetry to
pinpoint contrasting styles and
moods.
Members of the Summer Choral
Workshop will present the pro
gram of varied madrigals; the
Madrigal Singers group will per
form the high-spirited "II Fes
tino."
Both groups are under Sch
midt's baton.
LITTLE KNOWN and seldom
performed, the "II Festino" piece
is a lifting and good-natured pa
rody of the music of its period.
"In 'II Festino' Banchieri ab
sorbed all the ten-known forms
of music — balletto, giustiniana,
canzonetta, madrigal and others,
poked fun at them and the music
critic and, in one selection, even
included the cat's meow," said
Dr. Schmidt.
The score includes what may
be the first singing commercia'
of record. At the end of the madri
gal, the singers intone, "Thank
you for coming, and do come
again. We'll have a new work
for you then."
