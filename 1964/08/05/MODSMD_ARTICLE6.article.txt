# MGD Generator Research
## 
### 
A huge version of technology's
most promising answer to the di
rect conversion of heat into elec
tric power — the MGD (magneto
gasdynamic) generator — is un
dergoing intensive study by re
search engineers here.
THE PLAMSA-MAKING de
vice, which includes a 500-horse
power minesweeper diesel and a
20-ton electromagnet, has been
assembled in the Thermal Energy
Conversion Laboratory of the
Mechanical Engineering Depart
ment.
If the techniques can be worked
out, engineers believe MGD pow
er generators will boost effici
ency of steam generating plants
about 50 per cent. And if high
temperature problems can be
solved, it may serve equally well
in nuclear power generating
plants.
STANFORD'S MGD generator,
the largest yet built outside of a
few in industrial research labora
tories, was financed by the Ad
vanced Research Projects Agency.
Prof. Robert H. Eustis of the
Thermosciences Division is direct
ing the work.
The MGD generator burns a
mixture of alcohol and oxygen.
The resulting gas is "seeded" with
potassium hydroxide to promote
ionization — the freeing of elec
trons from gas molecules.
Shooting at near-sonic speed
into a thin, firebrick-lined chan
nel, the ionized plasma enters a
powerful magnetic field produced
by the 28,000-gauss electromagnet
(56,000 times the earth's magnetic
field force).

THE MAGNETIC field deflects
the negatively charged free elec
trons toward 13 nodes (positive
electrodes) and the positively
charged gas molecules toward 13
cathodes (negative electrodes)
lining opposite sides of the chan
nel.
Anodes and cathodes are con
nected together by an electric
circuit.
Since an electron is the basic
unit of electricity, a current be
gins to flow as electrons move
through the circuit from anode
to cathode.
When the electrons reach the

cathode they are dumped back
into the channel. There they re
combine with the positively
charged gas molecules and are
discharged from the generator.
THE EXPERIMENTS have
achieved between 2,000 and 3,000
watts of power, but they believe
the big generator is capable of
nearly 20 times that.
A 15 man crew of professors,
graduate students and techni
cians usunlly operate the device
to the accompaniment of its
steady, deafening roar. About
750 gallons of water a minute are
needed to cool it.
