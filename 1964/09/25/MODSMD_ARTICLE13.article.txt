## 
### 
Ram's Head, Stanford's student
drama organization, wiil hold try-
I outs for its fifty-first production
I of "Big Game Gaieties" next week.
! One of Stanford's oldest active
traditions, "Gaieties" started in
1913 as "The Stanford Follies."
THE ORIGINAL conception of
Gaieties has seldom varied over
the years: A happy satirical per
formance which spares no group
or member of the campus commu
nity. The form of Gaieties has
varied from series of short skits to
complex plots, but it has always
been a completely student written
show.
According to Ram's Head, un
limited opportunities are open to
students who wish to participate
in the acting, advertising, busi-
I ness, designing, construction, di
recting, or writing departments.
TRYOUTS WILL begin at 7:30
I p.m. next Wednesday night in Me
morial Auditorium. Additional
sessions are scheduled at the same
time on Thursday and Friday
nights.
Production dates are November
118-21.


GAIETIES TRYOUTS-Tryouts for Stanford's Big
