# Veteran Wilburite Becomes Director
## 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE Feature Editor 
"Following Dwight Clark into
Wilbur is a little like trying to
follow Jesus into Heaven."
IN THESE WORDS, Doug Da
vis sums up the many problems
facing him as new director of
Wilbur this year. He doesn't ap
pear particularly apprehensive,
however, and in fact seems to be
looking forward to the experience.
"Wilbur, I think, offers a unique
experience to the student," he
says, "because here he comes into
contact with all three aspects of
the University at once: The fac
ulty represented by the faculty
residents, the student body, and
the administration in my person."
"I make no bones about represent
ing the administration," he ex
plains. However he emphasizes
that he had not come down to "get
on the sponsors' backs." "I didn't
come here to make changes," he
said. "I plan to continue Dean
Clark's policies until a reason
arises to alter them."
Davis is well qualified to com
ment on Wilbur and its problems.
He was a member of the first
freshman class to enter the dorm
in 1955, and later served as a
sponsor under head sponsor
Dwight Clark in 1957. He gradu
ated with a major in political
science in 1959 and, after two
years in the Army, returned to
Stanford to enter the School of
Law. He received his law degree
in January 1964 and was prepar
ing to enter private practice when
the job of Director of Wilbur was
offered to him.
DAVIS BELIEVES that most
of the disciplinary problems at
Wilbur are problems of attitude.
"If somebody bombs a guy sun
bathing in the courtyard with a
water balloon and the rest of the
house thinks it's 'funny' or 'all
right' then the matter is well on
the way to getting out of hand.
But if the rest of the house looks
down on such an incident and
shows they don't think it's cute
then you're not going to have
much of a problem."
ACCORDING TO Davis th e
title of the job itself represents a
considerable evolution in the con
cept of the freshmen men's hous
ing as seen from the Dean of
Men's office. When Wilbur w a s
first opened, all men's dorms had
female directors in the housing
office who were responsible solely
for the physical plant while the
function of counciling and advis
ing was a separate operation in
the Dean of Men's office.
Shortly after the opening of
Wilbur it was decided to combine
the two jobs and a new post, the
Dean of Freshmen Men was
created with the salary coming
both from the Dean of Men's off
ice and the Housing office.
Davis' new title represents the

latest step in this evolution. It
was decided that the functions of
counciling and advising had be
come such an inherent part of the
Wilbur director's joh that the title
of Dean of Freshmen Men was
no longer necessary and it re
verted back to Director of Wilbur
although Davis is still responsible
both to the Dean of Men and the
Housing Director.

arises to alter them."
Davis is well qualified to com
ment on Wilbur and its problems.
He was a member of the first
freshman class to enter the dorm
in 1955, and later served as a
sponsor under head sponsor
Dwight Clark in 1957. He gradu
ated with a major in political
science in 1959 and, after two
years in the Army, returned to
Stanford to enter the School of
Law. He received his law degree
in January 1964 and was prepar
ing to enter private practice when
the job of Director of Wilbur was
offered to him.
DAVIS BELIEVES that most
of the disciplinary problems at
Wilbur are problems of attitude.
"If somebody bombs a guy sun
bathing in the courtyard with a
water balloon and the rest of the
house thinks it's 'funny' or 'all
right' then the matter is well on
the way to getting out of hand.
But if the rest of the house looks
down on such an incident and
shows they don't think it's cute
then you're not going to have
much of a problem."
ACCORDING TO Davis th e
title of the job itself represents a
considerable evolution in the con
cept of the freshmen men's hous
ing as seen from the Dean of
Men's office. When Wilbur w a s
first opened, all men's dorms had
female directors in the housing
office who were responsible solely
for the physical plant while the
function of counciling and advis
ing was a separate operation in
the Dean of Men's office.
Shortly after the opening of
Wilbur it was decided to combine
the two jobs and a new post, the
Dean of Freshmen Men was
created with the salary coming
both from the Dean of Men's off
ice and the Housing office.
Davis' new title represents the

latest step in this evolution. It
was decided that the functions of
counciling and advising had be
come such an inherent part of the
Wilbur director's joh that the title
of Dean of Freshmen Men was
no longer necessary and it re
verted back to Director of Wilbur
although Davis is still responsible
both to the Dean of Men and the
Housing Director.
"Following Dwight Clark into
Wilbur is a little like trying to
follow Jesus into Heaven."
IN THESE WORDS, Doug Da
vis sums up the many problems
facing him as new director of
Wilbur this year. He doesn't ap
pear particularly apprehensive,
however, and in fact seems to be
looking forward to the experience.
"Wilbur, I think, offers a unique
experience to the student," he
says, "because here he comes into
contact with all three aspects of
the University at once: The fac
ulty represented by the faculty
residents, the student body, and
the administration in my person."
"I make no bones about represent
ing the administration," he ex
plains. However he emphasizes
that he had not come down to "get
on the sponsors' backs." "I didn't
come here to make changes," he
said. "I plan to continue Dean
Clark's policies until a reason
arises to alter them."
