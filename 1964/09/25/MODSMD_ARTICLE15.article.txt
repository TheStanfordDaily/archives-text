### 
The Oakland Chamber Orches
tra, Gerhard Samuel conducting,
will present a varied program in
concert at 8:30 tonight in Me
morial Auditorium as a highlight
of pre-registration week.
SOLOIST will be David Abel,
new concertmaster of the Oakland
Symphony Orchestra, who will
play Mozart's Concerto No. 5 in
A major. The orchestra will per
form compositions by Purcell, Jo
hann Sebastian Bach, Schubert,
Handel and Bartok.
This will be the first of a series
of six concerts during the 1964-65
season for the Oakland Chamber
Orchestra. Later concerts will be
given in Oakland, San Francisco
and Pittsburg.
THE OAKLAND Chamber Or
chestra is composed of some 20
players selected from the Oakland
Symphony Orchestra. Organized
by Samuel, the group has been
known as the Collegium Musicum
for the past three seasons, and
has established a unique niche in
the cultural life of the Bay Area.
Because several orchestras of a
similar name have sprung up in
the area, Maestro Samuel has
changed the name of the group
to the Oakland Chamber Orches
tra.
