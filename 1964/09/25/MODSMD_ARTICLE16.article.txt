## A 						Roommate Conspiracy? 
### BOB BJORING 
Is there really a malignan
power choosing roommates it
Wilbur Hall? "Not so," sayi
Dwight Clark, former dean o:
freshmen men.
ACCORDING to Clark, these
lection is clone by personal atu
psychological contrasts. Educa
tional surveys show that students
will learn more when they art
brought into contact with othei
students whose backgrounds anc
ideas are different from their own
"We do not seek to pair oppo
sites, but rather to bring togethei
students whose differences wil
complement each other." The mos
important and obvious difference
which is taken into account i>

geographical. With almost fifty
i per cent of the student body com
ing from California, an out-of
-1 stater is virtually assured of a
Golden State roommate.
Alter this has been done there
j are not many factors that can be
of aid. "The really important dif
ferences are those of personality,
about which we can know noth
ing," explains Clark. The office
dies to anticipate some of these.
PRIVATE SCHOOL students
are always put into rooms with
boys who have attended public
school. Economic backgrounds are
also taken into consideration. In
; this way each room is sure to
have a phonograph.
Finally, interests and prospec
tive majors are taken into ac-
I count. If your roommate is an

JL â€¢/
engineer, you should be proud
of it because it indicates that the
Dean's Office thinks you are crea
tive.
THE FACT that all the houses
are quite different poses a prob
lem. When asked why, Dean Clark
stated, "We wish we knew." Per
haps it is the herd instinct.
Arbitrary as the system may
seem, it works out well in prac
tice. There are relatively few
change s made in roommates.
Many houses, however, have un
dertaken mass-change campaigns.
In Winter Quarter last year, Ma
dera House switched all the room
mates. The rational e for the
change was that new pairs would
further enhance the educational
value of meeting new and differ
ent people.
