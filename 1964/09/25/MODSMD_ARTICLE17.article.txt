# | Number Of Civ Classes fn Lounges Will Triple
## 
### 
Half of this year's freshman
class will be attending Western
Civilization classes in dormitory
lounges, according to Mervin ;
Freedman, assistant dean of un
dergraduate education.
IN PAST years, about a dozen
of the 59 Western Civ sections
have met in Stern and Wilbur |
Hall lounges, but the program
I will be greatly expanded to in
clude Branner and Roble Halls.
In addition, the number of Wilbur
and Stern freshmen attending
classes within their residence i
halls will be nearly doubled.
"It is hoped," said Freedman, I
,"that residence hall Civilization I
sections will help break down the j
divorce between dormitory activ- ,
ities and life on the rest of the j
; campus."
IN ADDITION, Freedman be- j
j lieves that classes within the I
freshman dormitories will pro
mote "greater interaction among '
students outside of class. Because j
students will bo attending class i
with the same people they live j
with, we hope that discussion will

carry beyond the classroom," ho
said.
Freedman also suggests that
; residence hall classes will h e 1 p
improve faculty-student relation
j ships. "Ultimately, said Freed-
I man, "we hope that faculty who
teach Western Civ in the dormi
: tories will stay for meals and in
j teract informally with the resi
i dents."
"TUK IDEAL situation," con
i tinued Freedman, "would ho lor
a few faculty members to have
permanent offices within the halls
| to be available for discussion at
j all times."
"For the present, we hope to
j implement a program more viable
| and less awkward than the Fac

A former research associate in
the Institute for the Study of Hu-
J man Problems, Freedman sug

tinues to attend classes on cam
pus will function as a control
