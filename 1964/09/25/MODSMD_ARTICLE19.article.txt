# Travel Bureau Plans Flights For Christmas
## 
### 
Although most students have
not even arrived on campus, the
ASSU Travel Service is already
making arrangements for charter
flight back East over Christmas
vacation.
Flights are already scheduled
to Chicago and New York. Stu
dents taking advantage of the
Travel Service flight to Chicago
will save $78.70 on round-trip
charter fares, while those flying to
New York will save $125 over reg
ular jet fares.
SEATS HAVE also been re
served on round-trip scheduled .iet
flights to Chicago, Minneapolis,
New York, and Washington, D.C.
[ Seats on these planes will be avail
-1 able for 80 per cent of the regular
| rate.
Requests for space have already
begun coming into the Travel Ser
vice. and representatives of the
ASSU-sponsored organization are
urging students to make immedi
ate reservations.
THE TRAVEL SERVICE was
founded in January, and resulted
from an ill-fated flight the previ
ous May which left several dozen
Stanford students traveling from
Europe to San Francisco stranded
in New York.
According to Dick Falk, co
founder of the agency, the pur
pose of the service is "to provide
students with the best possible
travel arrangements at the lowest
possible prices and to be a regula
tory body for everyone forming
and selling travel arrangements
on campus."
IN ANNOUNCING University
approval of the service, Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler
said:
"We think there is a need for an
orderly provision for travel for
the University community. Civil
Aeronautics Board regulations are
such that it is essential to have
some central group plan travel so
students aren't at the mercy of ill
â€¢onceived schemes."
Christine Hoover, a graduate
student in the Food Research In
stitute 1 , will replace Falk as Travel
Service Director this year. The or
ganization's offices are located on
the second floor of Tresidder Me
morial Union and will be open
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily.
