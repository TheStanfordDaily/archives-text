# Shortage Of Housing On Campus
## 174 Freshmen Living In Stern 
### 
Insufficient housing on campus
has forced several dozen mem
ber's of last year's freshman class
to move into Palo Alto and ad
joining communities to find apart
ments this fall.
The shortage is caused indi
rectly by the unexpectedly large
size of the Class of '6S. Nearly
900 freshmen have arrived on
campus for pro-registration week,
but there is room for only 720 in
Wilbur Hall. The remaining 174
must live in Stern Hall, which,
in turn, limits the space available
for upperelassmen.
ALL FRESHMEN applicants
were given the choice between liv
ing in Stern or Wilbur, and only
IS of the 171 freshmen staying
in Stern are not there by choice.
Four other freshmen are living
at home by choice and one mar
ried freshman is staying in Es
condido Village.
According to John Moore, di
rector of single men's housing at
Stanford Village, about 20 of last
year's Wilbur freshmen will live
in the undergraduate dorm there.
Tin: REMAINING 91 spaces
at Stanford Village will be filled
by 2S holdovers from last year
and (S3 transfer students. In the
past, most transfer students have
found space in Stern Hall, with
the remainder overflowing into
the Village. This year the Village
cannot even accommodate all the
transfers who seek housing.
The Housing Office, however,
reports that it has had more
apartment listings this year than
ever before. As a result, transfer
students and those who were un
able to find room in Stern have
had little difficulty in renting
studio apartments in the area.
A SPOKESMAN for the Hous
ing Office attributed the large
number of apartments to "the
realization of the crowded situa
tion on campus by independent
contractors in Palo Alto and ad
joining towns. The builders have
simply prepared for this inevi
table growth," the spokesman ex
plained.
The Board of Trustees has ap
proved plans for a cluster of four
independent houses on the Knoll,
and University architects arc
preparing schematic drawings for
these buildings. Each house would
have space for (55 undergraduates,
making a total capacity of 2SO.
At the same time, however, the
University is reportedly planning
to vacate Stanford Village in June
which would eliminate fa
cilities for 110 undergraduate and
110 graduate men.
