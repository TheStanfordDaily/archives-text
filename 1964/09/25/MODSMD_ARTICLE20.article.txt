# Equation A ids Admissions
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Staff Editor 
One of the main questions in
the minds oJ' Stanford freshmen
is why they, out of more than
7000 applicants, were selected to
attend the University.
"We turn down many very fine
people who just don't measure up
to those with whom they are com
peting," Dr. Stirling Huntley, as
sociate director of admissions,
told The Daily late last year.
BUT "MEASURE UP" is a
vague term In itself. To under
stand how the seven-man admis
sions committee did "measure"
this year's Stanford applicants, it
is necessary to review the pro
cedure that they followed.
When applicants began submit
ting the basic preliminary forms

last autumn, a folder was estab
lished for each student. Letters
of recommendation, reports of
high school grades, and records
of college board scores all were
filed here.
Once all the data were received,
each applicant was rated accord
ing to a predetermined equation.
EXPERIMENTS with this equa
tion were first made eight years
ago. For four years the equation's
predictions were compared to ac
tual performances of students ad
mitted by other processes.
When it was finally refined and
proven accurate, the equation was
made operational.
Applicants are rated in two
areas: Personal and academic.
Seventy per cent stress is placed
on academic achievement and 30

per cent on personal qualifica
tions.
SCORES FOR these two areas
are written on the front of each
student's folder.
Personal rating is by letter: A,
B, C, or D. It is determined by a
review of the student's letters of
recommendation, his activ'tics in
high school, and other informa
tion.
Academic prediction is by a
three-digit number. It is, in effect,
n prediction of the student's grade
point average if he were to com
plete studies at Stanford.
THIS, THEN, was the proce
dure which the admissions com
mittee followed in selecting the
Class of '68. High school grades
received more weight than board
scores. Also, the college board
verbal test was given more em
phasis than the mathematics ap
titude test.
Once all the information is com
piled, applicants were ranked by
a combination of personal rating
and academic prediction. Of the
total number of this year's fresh
men, around 1200, or roughly 65
per cent, were admitted on the
basis of this ranking alone.
The remaining 600 to 700 stu
dents that were admitted were
selected from the next 1400 stu
dents of the list. This group was
admitted by election of the seven
man admissions committee.
IN THIS group the committee
attempted to recognize a diver

sity of students that the equation
itself does not take into consid
eration. Applicants of alumni
parents, by a policy set by the
academic council 60 years ago,
were also given a slight prefer
ence here.
Recommendations from the ath
letic department and the music
department were also considered.
Members of the committee
could vote in one of three ways j
after considering each student's
folder: Accept the student, place
him on the waiting list, or reject
him.
A plurality of the committee
rules. Students on the waiting
list are accepted on the basis of
the number of "accept" votes thoy
received.
Because no information on fi
nancial need is included in the
folders, applicants were not pen
alized if they required scholar- i
ship assistance.

nancial need is included in the
folders, applicants were not pen
alized if they required scholar- i
ship assistance.
One of the main questions in
the minds oJ' Stanford freshmen
is why they, out of more than
7000 applicants, were selected to
attend the University.
"We turn down many very fine
people who just don't measure up
to those with whom they are com
peting," Dr. Stirling Huntley, as
sociate director of admissions,
told The Daily late last year.
BUT "MEASURE UP" is a
vague term In itself. To under
stand how the seven-man admis
sions committee did "measure"
this year's Stanford applicants, it
is necessary to review the pro
cedure that they followed.
When applicants began submit
ting the basic preliminary forms

last autumn, a folder was estab
lished for each student. Letters
of recommendation, reports of
high school grades, and records
of college board scores all were
filed here.
Once all the data were received,
each applicant was rated accord
ing to a predetermined equation.
EXPERIMENTS with this equa
tion were first made eight years
ago. For four years the equation's
predictions were compared to ac
tual performances of students ad
mitted by other processes.
When it was finally refined and
proven accurate, the equation was
made operational.
Applicants are rated in two
areas: Personal and academic.
Seventy per cent stress is placed
on academic achievement and 30

per cent on personal qualifica
tions.
SCORES FOR these two areas
are written on the front of each
student's folder.
Personal rating is by letter: A,
B, C, or D. It is determined by a
review of the student's letters of
recommendation, his activ'tics in
high school, and other informa
tion.
Academic prediction is by a
three-digit number. It is, in effect,
n prediction of the student's grade
point average if he were to com
plete studies at Stanford.
THIS, THEN, was the proce
dure which the admissions com
mittee followed in selecting the
Class of '68. High school grades
received more weight than board
scores. Also, the college board
verbal test was given more em
phasis than the mathematics ap
titude test.
Once all the information is com
piled, applicants were ranked by
a combination of personal rating
and academic prediction. Of the
total number of this year's fresh
men, around 1200, or roughly 65
per cent, were admitted on the
basis of this ranking alone.
The remaining 600 to 700 stu
dents that were admitted were
selected from the next 1400 stu
dents of the list. This group was
admitted by election of the seven
man admissions committee.
IN THIS group the committee
attempted to recognize a diver

sity of students that the equation
itself does not take into consid
eration. Applicants of alumni
parents, by a policy set by the
academic council 60 years ago,
were also given a slight prefer
ence here.
Recommendations from the ath
letic department and the music
department were also considered.
Members of the committee
could vote in one of three ways j
after considering each student's
folder: Accept the student, place
him on the waiting list, or reject
him.
A plurality of the committee
rules. Students on the waiting
list are accepted on the basis of
the number of "accept" votes thoy
received.

nancial need is included in the
folders, applicants were not pen
alized if they required scholar- i
ship assistance.
