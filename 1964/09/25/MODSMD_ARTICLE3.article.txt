"Self-fulfillment, successful ap
plication of talent, and serenity
of spirit, require the development
I of personal attributes and virtues
:of a high order." So cautioned
President Wallace Sterling as he
welcomed the 1,307 members of
Stanford's incoming Freshman
class in his annual convocation
address, delivered in the swelter
ing heat of Frost Memorial Am
phitheater last Wednesday after
noon.
LOOKING TAN and fit after
his recuperation from an illness
that disabled him last spring,
Sterling asked the assembled
I freshmen to make the most of
their four years at Stanford: "En
joy them, savor them as you go.
. . . For one thing, you will
j never be 18 to 22 again. For an
other, you will never again be so
i carefree."

He emphasized, however, that
the inherent right of personal
freedom carries with it the in
herent responsibility to use that
freedom judiciously — with self
discipline and intelligence.
"A few moments ago I said
that you are at an age as we
elders once were when you are
reaching out quite naturally and
properly for greater personal
freedom and independence," Ster
ling said. "And in this circum
stance I rejoice. . . . Nevertheless
I put to you the preacher's ques
tion. . . . Are you fit to be free?"
STERLING continued, "How
are you going to harness this
greater freedom and independ
ence which you seek and which
I, for one, want you to have?
That question is before you now
and it will and should stay there
as long as you live.
"What place will you find in
your answer for thoughtfulness
which expresses itself in courtesy
and compassion? What place for

the cultivation of knowledge with
out which there can he no wis
dom? What place for honesty of
i mind and heart which entitles
| you to the confidence of others?
1 What place for self-discipline
| without which there will be dis
! order in your own Jives and in
the lives of others?"
"Our shortcomings in this par
ticular may derive from the in
adequacy of university resources,
both human and material. . . .
Also our methods may be geared
.too comfortably to the average,
or to the common denomina
tor. . .
Sterling concluded his address
with a gentle admonition against
arrogance: "If you think that
i you will know more when you
I are forty or fifty than you do
} now if you think that, by that
|age, you will have found more
answers than you have yet. found
then perhaps you will hospit
ably entertain the thought that
I some of us can help you."
