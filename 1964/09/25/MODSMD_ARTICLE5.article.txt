## 
### 
Between 45 and 50 members*
of the Delta Upsilon fraternity
are looking for a plaee to live
this week, after a $15,000 fire
last Sunday left their house un
inhabitable for all but 20 resi
dents.
The fire raged ihrough the third
floor of the fraternity house, lo
cated at 540 Salvatierra, and
destroyed three rooms. Seven
other third floor rooms suffered
extensive water damage and will
have to be completely remodeled.
IN ADDITION all but a small
portion of the roof was totally
| destroyed and several rooms on
the first and second floors were
damaged by water.
According to DU President
Sandy Gilbert, a private contrac
tor will soon begin rebuilding the
house, and all 65 members should
be able to resume residence by
ithe beginning of Winter Quarter.
Inthe meantime, the fraternity
members who were burned out
are looking for housing in Palo
Alto and other nearby towns. Sev
eral other fraternities on campus
who do not have full houses have
offered a few rooms for the use |
of DU members.
ALL MEMBERS of the fratern- j
ity will continue to eat meals at j
j the DU House, as the first-floor |
j kitchen and elubroom were left i
untouched by the blaze.
When the Stanford Fire Do- j
partment arrived about 4 p.m. j
I Sunday, the fire had already'
S burned through the roof, but with
l the help of several Alpha Tau
Omicron members, firemen ex
tinguished it in less than an hour.
The flames might have been
contained earlier, but a nozzle on
the hose became clogged with
sand. By the time the water was
shut off and the nozzle changed,
; the fire had spread to the third
i floor.
Fire Chief John Marston said |
ithe fire apparently started be-j
tween the walls on the third floor, j
; but no cause of the fire was de-1
termined.
Several DU members speeu
! lated that the blaze had resulted :
1 from faulty wiring.

FROSH ARRlVE—Members of the pre-registration committee met sev
eral groups of freshmen as they arrived at the Palo Alto Southern
Pacific depot on Wednesday. Similar receptions were given fresh
men at the San Francisco International Airport.
Between 45 and 50 members*
of the Delta Upsilon fraternity
are looking for a plaee to live
this week, after a $15,000 fire
last Sunday left their house un
inhabitable for all but 20 resi
dents.
The fire raged ihrough the third
floor of the fraternity house, lo
cated at 540 Salvatierra, and
destroyed three rooms. Seven
other third floor rooms suffered
extensive water damage and will
have to be completely remodeled.
IN ADDITION all but a small
portion of the roof was totally
| destroyed and several rooms on
the first and second floors were
damaged by water.
According to DU President
Sandy Gilbert, a private contrac
tor will soon begin rebuilding the
house, and all 65 members should
be able to resume residence by
ithe beginning of Winter Quarter.
Inthe meantime, the fraternity
members who were burned out
are looking for housing in Palo
Alto and other nearby towns. Sev
eral other fraternities on campus
who do not have full houses have
offered a few rooms for the use |
of DU members.
ALL MEMBERS of the fratern- j
ity will continue to eat meals at j
j the DU House, as the first-floor |
j kitchen and elubroom were left i
untouched by the blaze.
When the Stanford Fire Do- j
partment arrived about 4 p.m. j
I Sunday, the fire had already'
S burned through the roof, but with
l the help of several Alpha Tau
Omicron members, firemen ex
tinguished it in less than an hour.
The flames might have been
contained earlier, but a nozzle on
the hose became clogged with
sand. By the time the water was
shut off and the nozzle changed,
; the fire had spread to the third
i floor.
Fire Chief John Marston said |
ithe fire apparently started be-j
tween the walls on the third floor, j
; but no cause of the fire was de-1
termined.
Several DU members speeu
! lated that the blaze had resulted :
1 from faulty wiring.
