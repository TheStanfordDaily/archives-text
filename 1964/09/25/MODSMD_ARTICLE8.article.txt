# DEAN WERT:
## Frosh Are 'Normal, Stable' 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
"If a liberal education does not
result in personality change, it
has not been liberal and it has
not been education," Undergradu
ate Dean Robert J. Wert told an
audience of Stanford freshmen in
an orientation speech yeslerday
morning.
Using data derived from sam
pling, testing and interviewing
techniques, Wert described th e
Class of 19GS in a few of its gen
eral characteristics.
He suggested that the freshmen
are strict perfectionists in their
evaluation of themselves and of
others. He indicated a tendancy
toward uncompromising ideal
ism, with an accompanying black
and white attitude in moral judg
ments.
Wert also noted in the fresh

men, however, a vulnerability to
the appraisals of others and an
uncertainty in self-esteem.
"Sometimes you don't admit it,"
I he said, "but you really want di
rection from adults and simple,
I understandable rules which gov
ern your daily lives."
As a final footnote, Wert added,
I "Although it isn't apparent from
reading Itedhook Magazine, The
Ladies* Home .Journal, or Time,
.Life, and Fortune, you arc com
pletely normal, stable, relatively
i uncomplicated, somewhat com
placent, college students, most of
whom have accepted the stan
dards of middleclass America
and who are really quite Puritan
and Victorian in outlook."
While admitting that the exact
direction of individual change is
unpredictable, the Dean outlined
the following trends of expected

development:
"First, some of you will in
crease in independence. You will
develop your own standards of
judgment; you will rely less upon
the opinions of others.
"Second . . . your ability to
deal with complexity will improve
immeasurably. Things will no
longer seem quite so black or so
white, and you will be able to ac
cept grays although you may
not be particularly comfortable
with them.
"Third, as you learn to live
with complexity, you will also
learn about dealing with ambigu
ity and uncertainty. . . . Perfec
tion may not be found quite ;;o
easily; and truth, now usually
attainable, may not be quite so
quickly within your grasp when
you are seniors.
"Fourth, your college years will
produce a new willingness on
your part to change and accept
change, and an openness of mind
which many of you do not no w
process."
Wert encouraged the freshmen
to experiment in college, to be
concerned but not obsessed w i th
grades, and most importantly
to maintain their self-confi
dence.
"Remember that not everyone
can get straight 'A's; not every
one can be president of the stu
dent body. You will all have dis
appointments and triumphs. If
you cannot accept disappoint
ments with calmness and reason,
you will block your development
and cripple your ability to learn."

He suggested that the freshmen
are strict perfectionists in their
evaluation of themselves and of
others. He indicated a tendancy
toward uncompromising ideal

Wert also noted in the fresh

men, however, a vulnerability to
the appraisals of others and an
uncertainty in self-esteem.
"Sometimes you don't admit it,"
I he said, "but you really want di
rection from adults and simple,

While admitting that the exact
direction of individual change is
unpredictable, the Dean outlined
the following trends of expected

development:
"First, some of you will in
crease in independence. You will
develop your own standards of
judgment; you will rely less upon
the opinions of others.
"Second . . . your ability to
deal with complexity will improve
immeasurably. Things will no
longer seem quite so black or so
white, and you will be able to ac
cept grays although you may
not be particularly comfortable
with them.
"Third, as you learn to live
with complexity, you will also
learn about dealing with ambigu
ity and uncertainty. . . . Perfec
tion may not be found quite ;;o
easily; and truth, now usually
attainable, may not be quite so
quickly within your grasp when
you are seniors.
"Fourth, your college years will
produce a new willingness on
your part to change and accept
change, and an openness of mind
which many of you do not no w
process."
Wert encouraged the freshmen
to experiment in college, to be
concerned but not obsessed w i th
grades, and most importantly
to maintain their self-confi
dence.
"Remember that not everyone
can get straight 'A's; not every
one can be president of the stu
dent body. You will all have dis
appointments and triumphs. If
you cannot accept disappoint
ments with calmness and reason,
you will block your development
and cripple your ability to learn."
