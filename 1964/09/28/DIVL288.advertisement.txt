A Life and Death Matter
Every human being has a someday-date with death. For
the one who knows Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, death is a
moment of victory when he is released from a corruptible, mor
tal body to step eternally into the very presence of the Lord
Jesus Christ with a new resurrection (spiritual) body.
Let us consider what the Bible says about death:
"Behold all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well
as the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins shall die."
(Ezekiel 1S:4). "The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." (Romans 6:23)
"... it is appointed unto men onee to die, but after this the
judgment." (Hebrews 9:27)
of us shall give account of himself to God." (Romans 14:10-12).
Christ? Death for these whom the Bible calls "unbelievers" is
still the time they must come face to face with the Lord Jesus
Christ. "For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of
God; for it is written, 'as I live says the Lord, every knee shall
bow to me, and every tongue shall give praise to God.' So each
of us shall give account of himself to God." (Roman 14:10-12).
Every road in life, for every human being who has ever lived,
leads soon or later to a personal encounter with Jesus Christ
our Lord. Those who choose to receive Jesus Christ now see
Him at physical death as Deliverer and Savior, but all others
must face the risen Lord to give account of themselves before
a holy and righteous Creator.
"And behold I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to
give to every man according as his work shall be. I am Alpha
and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last
... I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things
in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and
the bright and morning star." (Revelation 22:12-16)
God continues to extend to us His gift of eternal life through
a belief in His Son. Won't you settle your account with Jesus
Christ today? Meet Him as Lord now, not as the Holy Judge
who can only pronounce sentence and eternal separation from
God upon those who reject Him.
It was Jesus Christ who said, "I am the resurrection and
the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall
he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never
die." (John 11:25-26)
It is this same Jesus Christ who stands ready today to make
Himself real to you if you will only ask Him to do so. Your
present relationship to Him is literally a matter of life and
death! It is your life which is at stake, your eternal destiny
which hangs in the balance.
