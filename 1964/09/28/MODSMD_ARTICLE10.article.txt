that arresting officers tore pages
from his addrcs book and made

mer, there have been about 20
bombings in McComb since June.
"Unlike most other bombings in
the state, those in McComb in
volved highly explosive ma
terials," said Beyers. "Many of
the other bombs used in the state
are crude and ineffective, but
these are powerful enough to
completely destroy entire build
ings."
SHERIFF 11. 11. Warren said
that the McComb bombings have
been "plants."
McComb is a small town in
Southwestern Mississippi where
about one-third of the residents
are Negroes.

other unlawful acts or methods
of terrorism as a means of 'chang
ing' agricultural or industrial
