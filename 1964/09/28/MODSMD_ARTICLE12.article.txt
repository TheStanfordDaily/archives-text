# Research Schooner Returns To Sea

After a year on special assign
ment in marine biological explora
lions of the Indian Ocean, Stan

ford University's 135-foot "float-j
ing classroom," the schooner Te
Vega, will return to her regular!
mission of teaching and research
when she sails today from Mom-1
i basa, Kenya.
A husband-and-wife team (Jay !
i and Jeanne Christ ofl'erson of!
j Valle.jo) will be among the 11 :
I graduate students and four sci-j
entists aboard -for the three
month cruise. A captain and crew
oi 15 complete the ship's comple
ment for the expedition, the fifth
since Te Vega sailed from the
West Coast in July 1963 under 1
.sponsorship of the National Sci-!
once Foundation.
CHIEF SCIENTIST for the
cruise is Prof. Donald P. Abbott
i of Stanford's Hopkins Marine
: Station, which operates the Te
Vega. Expeditions 112 r o m the j
schooner's home port of Mon- j
terey. He relieves Prof. Rolf
Bolin, now back at the Station
after leading three of Te Vega's
four cruises.
Prof. Lawrence R. Blinks, di
rector of the Station, will take
over from Prof. Abbott on the
next cruise, and Prof. Bolin will
return to the ship for ihe final
two cruises ending in her return
to Monterey next fall for over
hauling.
Prof. Bolin regretfully reported i

that Te Vega scientists were un
able to capture a coelecanth (see
la-kanth) during the cruise just
ended. They had hoped to bring
one or more of the living fossil i

fishes back alive for study, and j
perhaps for exhibition in San J
Francisco's Sleinhardt Aquarium ;
where a specially built tank was I
prepared for it.
THE VOYAGE covered areas!
around Madagascar and the Co- j
moros. Nine biologists from insti- !
tutions around the world and I
seven graduate students particip- j
ated in the search in addition to
carrying on other investigations.
Stanford students participating
in the cruise are Richard T. Bar
ber, Vicki M. Buchsbaum, John C.
Ogden, Sharon J. Proctor, and
John P. Wourms.

After a year on special assign
ment in marine biological explora
lions of the Indian Ocean, Stan

ford University's 135-foot "float-j
ing classroom," the schooner Te
Vega, will return to her regular!
mission of teaching and research
when she sails today from Mom-1
i basa, Kenya.
A husband-and-wife team (Jay !
i and Jeanne Christ ofl'erson of!
j Valle.jo) will be among the 11 :
I graduate students and four sci-j
entists aboard -for the three
month cruise. A captain and crew
oi 15 complete the ship's comple
ment for the expedition, the fifth
since Te Vega sailed from the
West Coast in July 1963 under 1
.sponsorship of the National Sci-!
once Foundation.
CHIEF SCIENTIST for the
cruise is Prof. Donald P. Abbott
i of Stanford's Hopkins Marine
: Station, which operates the Te
Vega. Expeditions 112 r o m the j
schooner's home port of Mon- j
terey. He relieves Prof. Rolf
Bolin, now back at the Station
after leading three of Te Vega's
four cruises.
Prof. Lawrence R. Blinks, di
rector of the Station, will take
over from Prof. Abbott on the
next cruise, and Prof. Bolin will
return to the ship for ihe final
two cruises ending in her return
to Monterey next fall for over
hauling.
Prof. Bolin regretfully reported i

that Te Vega scientists were un
able to capture a coelecanth (see
la-kanth) during the cruise just
ended. They had hoped to bring
one or more of the living fossil i

fishes back alive for study, and j
perhaps for exhibition in San J
Francisco's Sleinhardt Aquarium ;
where a specially built tank was I
prepared for it.
THE VOYAGE covered areas!
around Madagascar and the Co- j
moros. Nine biologists from insti- !
tutions around the world and I
seven graduate students particip- j
ated in the search in addition to
carrying on other investigations.
