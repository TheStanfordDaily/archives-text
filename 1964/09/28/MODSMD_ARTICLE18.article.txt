## Major Construction Underway 
### 
Campus construction projects
with a total value of more than
$21 million are either now under
way or have been completed with
in the past month.
In addition ground will be
broken on more than $6 million
worth of projects this quarter,
including a $5.3 million under
graduate library and the $900,000
Cowell Student Health Building.
CONSTRUCTION which has
been completed for use this quar
ter includes the Sloan M a th e
matics Center, the Storke Student
Publications Building, the stacks
in the Main Library basement,
and the lounges in Stern Hall.
The transforming of the old
physics corner into a modern
mathematics center began in
April, 1963. The Sloan Center will
provide a central headquarters for
a program, which for many years,
operated in five scattered campus
locations.
The worn four-story building
has been replaced with a c o m
pletely remodeled five-story inter
ior.
THE STORKE Student Publi
cations Building is located on the
former site of the old Daily shack
and will house the Quad, Chapar
ral, Student. Blotter, and Sequoia,
as well as the Daily.
The Daily editorial and business
offices will occupy a single-level
structure, while the other publi
cations will share a two-story
building.
TIIE $95,000 remodeling of
Stern Hall lounges includes new
furniture, lighting, painting, and
new drapes and carpets.
Largest among the buildings
now under construction are a
clinical sciences research addition
at the Medical Center, then e w
Graduate School of Business
building adjacent to Memorial
Auditorium, and the MeCullough
Engineering Building next to the
Physics Tank.
CONTRACTORS have been
working on the clinical sciences
research addition January,
and, according to UniVersity Con
struction Manager Lucien Stark,
it should be ready for occupancy
in December, 1965.
The $6.3 million structure will
contain facilities for investigation
in medicine, surgery, radiology,
pediatrics, genetics, obstetrics and
psychiatry.
It will also include laboratories
for basic research in the causes
of mental retardation. The build
ing will consist of four stories
and will include facilities, fi
nanced by the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration, for
research in the fields of space
biology and biomedical instrumen
tation.
THE $2.5 MILLION MeCul
lough Building is scheduled for
completion in December, 1965, and
will house the School of Engineer
ing and Center for Materials Re
search. The four-story rectangular
structure will also be the head
quarters of the Electrical Engi
neering Department, regarded as
second in importance only to MIT

as an electronics school.
The Materials Research Center
will occupy about 40 per cent of
the building's floor space, while
the School of Engineering portion
will consist of three classrooms
for instruction and research pro
jects.
CONSTRUCTION began during
the summer on the new building
for the Graduate School of Busi
ness. University officials expect
the building to be ready for the
opening of autumn quarter in
1966.
The structure will consolidate
all teaching and research activi
ties of the School, which are cur
rently conductd in five different
campus locations.
Included in the new building
will be the William Sloan Hall of
Management Education and the
William Roth Center for Ad
vanced Management Education.
OTHER BUILDINGS which are
moving toward completion are the
third unit of Escondido Village
for married students and the Fac
ulty Club.
The cost of the Escondido third
unit will be approximately $4.4
million, including landscaping,
furniture and appliances.
The project will be similar to
the Escondido second unit, con
taining 15 two-story units and
two eight-story structures with a
total of 228 apartments.
The 17-building complex should
be ready by spring quarter, 1966.

THE $1.2 MILLION .Faculty
Club should be finished by next
summer. The two-level structure
wil feature a large triangular din
ing room with views opening onto
a spreading oak grove on one side
and a garden court on the other.
Five smaller dining rooms will
each seat 20 people, and several
lounges, a reading room and a
recreation area will be avail
able for faculty use.
Six guest rooms wil be provided
for faculty visitors, including two
with kitchenettes.
REMODELING programs in
the Main Library Language La
boratory and the Stanford Mu
seum are expected to be com
pleted in late October and early
November.
The language lab is being com
pletely refurbished and equipped
with the latest in electronic lan
guage teaching aids.
The 1,750-square foot room will
be fitted with student desk sta
tions. Students will be able to com
pare their recorded accents with
a master recording to help im
prove their studies of French,
German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese,
Japanese, and English as a for
eign language.
The equipment will be moved
to the undergraduate library after
the latter's completion.
BOTH THE FIRST and second
floors of the north wing of the
Museum are undergoing a $100,-
000 rehabilitation.

New lighting, floor coverings,
improved ventiliation, repainting,
and several new exhibition fea
tures are included in the remodel
ing.

Campus construction projects
with a total value of more than
$21 million are either now under
way or have been completed with
in the past month.
In addition ground will be
broken on more than $6 million
worth of projects this quarter,
including a $5.3 million under
graduate library and the $900,000
Cowell Student Health Building.
CONSTRUCTION which has
been completed for use this quar
ter includes the Sloan M a th e
matics Center, the Storke Student
Publications Building, the stacks
in the Main Library basement,
and the lounges in Stern Hall.
The transforming of the old
physics corner into a modern
mathematics center began in
April, 1963. The Sloan Center will
provide a central headquarters for
a program, which for many years,
operated in five scattered campus
locations.
The worn four-story building
has been replaced with a c o m
pletely remodeled five-story inter
ior.
THE STORKE Student Publi
cations Building is located on the
former site of the old Daily shack
and will house the Quad, Chapar
ral, Student. Blotter, and Sequoia,
as well as the Daily.
The Daily editorial and business
offices will occupy a single-level
structure, while the other publi
cations will share a two-story
building.
TIIE $95,000 remodeling of
Stern Hall lounges includes new
furniture, lighting, painting, and
new drapes and carpets.
Largest among the buildings
now under construction are a
clinical sciences research addition
at the Medical Center, then e w
Graduate School of Business
building adjacent to Memorial
Auditorium, and the MeCullough
Engineering Building next to the
Physics Tank.
CONTRACTORS have been
working on the clinical sciences
research addition January,
and, according to UniVersity Con
struction Manager Lucien Stark,
it should be ready for occupancy
in December, 1965.
The $6.3 million structure will
contain facilities for investigation
in medicine, surgery, radiology,
pediatrics, genetics, obstetrics and
psychiatry.
It will also include laboratories
for basic research in the causes
of mental retardation. The build
ing will consist of four stories
and will include facilities, fi
nanced by the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration, for
research in the fields of space
biology and biomedical instrumen
tation.
THE $2.5 MILLION MeCul
lough Building is scheduled for
completion in December, 1965, and
will house the School of Engineer
ing and Center for Materials Re
search. The four-story rectangular
structure will also be the head
quarters of the Electrical Engi
neering Department, regarded as
second in importance only to MIT

as an electronics school.
The Materials Research Center
will occupy about 40 per cent of
the building's floor space, while
the School of Engineering portion
will consist of three classrooms
for instruction and research pro
jects.
CONSTRUCTION began during
the summer on the new building
for the Graduate School of Busi
ness. University officials expect
the building to be ready for the
opening of autumn quarter in
1966.
The structure will consolidate
all teaching and research activi
ties of the School, which are cur
rently conductd in five different
campus locations.
Included in the new building
will be the William Sloan Hall of
Management Education and the
William Roth Center for Ad
vanced Management Education.
OTHER BUILDINGS which are
moving toward completion are the
third unit of Escondido Village
for married students and the Fac
ulty Club.
The cost of the Escondido third
unit will be approximately $4.4
million, including landscaping,
furniture and appliances.
The project will be similar to
the Escondido second unit, con
taining 15 two-story units and
two eight-story structures with a
total of 228 apartments.
The 17-building complex should
be ready by spring quarter, 1966.

THE $1.2 MILLION .Faculty
Club should be finished by next
summer. The two-level structure
wil feature a large triangular din
ing room with views opening onto
a spreading oak grove on one side
and a garden court on the other.
Five smaller dining rooms will
each seat 20 people, and several
lounges, a reading room and a
recreation area will be avail
able for faculty use.
Six guest rooms wil be provided
for faculty visitors, including two
with kitchenettes.

taining 15 two-story units and
two eight-story structures with a
total of 228 apartments.
The 17-building complex should
be ready by spring quarter, 1966.

THE $1.2 MILLION .Faculty
Club should be finished by next
summer. The two-level structure
wil feature a large triangular din
ing room with views opening onto
a spreading oak grove on one side
and a garden court on the other.
Five smaller dining rooms will
each seat 20 people, and several
lounges, a reading room and a
recreation area will be avail
able for faculty use.
Six guest rooms wil be provided
for faculty visitors, including two
with kitchenettes.
REMODELING programs in
the Main Library Language La
boratory and the Stanford Mu
seum are expected to be com
pleted in late October and early
November.
The language lab is being com
pletely refurbished and equipped
with the latest in electronic lan
guage teaching aids.
The 1,750-square foot room will
be fitted with student desk sta
tions. Students will be able to com
pare their recorded accents with
a master recording to help im
prove their studies of French,
German, Spanish, Italian, Chinese,
Japanese, and English as a for
eign language.
The equipment will be moved
to the undergraduate library after
the latter's completion.
BOTH THE FIRST and second
floors of the north wing of the
Museum are undergoing a $100,-
000 rehabilitation.

New lighting, floor coverings,
improved ventiliation, repainting,
and several new exhibition fea
tures are included in the remodel
ing.
Campus construction projects
with a total value of more than
$21 million are either now under
way or have been completed with
in the past month.
In addition ground will be
broken on more than $6 million
worth of projects this quarter,
including a $5.3 million under
graduate library and the $900,000
Cowell Student Health Building.
CONSTRUCTION which has
been completed for use this quar
ter includes the Sloan M a th e
matics Center, the Storke Student
Publications Building, the stacks
in the Main Library basement,
and the lounges in Stern Hall.
The transforming of the old
physics corner into a modern
mathematics center began in
April, 1963. The Sloan Center will
provide a central headquarters for
a program, which for many years,
operated in five scattered campus
locations.
The worn four-story building
has been replaced with a c o m
pletely remodeled five-story inter
ior.
THE STORKE Student Publi
cations Building is located on the
former site of the old Daily shack
and will house the Quad, Chapar
ral, Student. Blotter, and Sequoia,
as well as the Daily.
The Daily editorial and business
offices will occupy a single-level
structure, while the other publi
cations will share a two-story
building.
TIIE $95,000 remodeling of
Stern Hall lounges includes new
furniture, lighting, painting, and
new drapes and carpets.
Largest among the buildings
now under construction are a
clinical sciences research addition
at the Medical Center, then e w
Graduate School of Business
building adjacent to Memorial
Auditorium, and the MeCullough
Engineering Building next to the
Physics Tank.
CONTRACTORS have been
working on the clinical sciences
research addition January,
and, according to UniVersity Con
struction Manager Lucien Stark,
it should be ready for occupancy
in December, 1965.
The $6.3 million structure will
contain facilities for investigation
in medicine, surgery, radiology,
pediatrics, genetics, obstetrics and
psychiatry.
It will also include laboratories
for basic research in the causes
of mental retardation. The build
ing will consist of four stories
and will include facilities, fi
nanced by the National Aeronau
tics and Space Administration, for
research in the fields of space
biology and biomedical instrumen
tation.
THE $2.5 MILLION MeCul
lough Building is scheduled for
completion in December, 1965, and
will house the School of Engineer
ing and Center for Materials Re
search. The four-story rectangular
structure will also be the head
quarters of the Electrical Engi
neering Department, regarded as
second in importance only to MIT

as an electronics school.
The Materials Research Center
will occupy about 40 per cent of
the building's floor space, while
the School of Engineering portion
will consist of three classrooms
for instruction and research pro
jects.
CONSTRUCTION began during
the summer on the new building
for the Graduate School of Busi
ness. University officials expect
the building to be ready for the
opening of autumn quarter in
1966.
The structure will consolidate
all teaching and research activi
ties of the School, which are cur
rently conductd in five different
campus locations.
Included in the new building
will be the William Sloan Hall of
Management Education and the
William Roth Center for Ad
vanced Management Education.
OTHER BUILDINGS which are
moving toward completion are the
third unit of Escondido Village
for married students and the Fac
ulty Club.
The cost of the Escondido third
unit will be approximately $4.4
million, including landscaping,
furniture and appliances.
The project will be similar to
the Escondido second unit, con
taining 15 two-story units and
two eight-story structures with a
