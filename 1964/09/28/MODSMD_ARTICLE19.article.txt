Susan Brilmayer and Diane
Elizabeth Halpem, members of
last year's freshman class, were
killed in the crash of a light plane
during takeoff from Rawlins, Wy
oming airport last June. Susan's
father, Mr. E. W. Brilmayer of
Pelham, New York, and the pilot
of the plane, was also killed.
The airplane took off, climbed
sharply, then suddenly dived from
150 feet. The airport manager re
j ported that he thought Mr. Bril
mayer, an expert pilot, had lost
control during a sudden gust of
wind.
The two girls' destination was
New York and the World's Fair.
Susan was planning to major in
electrical engineering, following
her father, who was a registered
engineer in New York State. She
and Diane had been roommates
and best friends in Roble Hall.
Diane Halpern was from Hono
lulu, and had planned to spend
the summer with Susan in Rye,
New York.
Susan's schoolmates at Rye

construction of a memorial for
her.
