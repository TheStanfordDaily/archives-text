# Stanford Red Rests San Jose, 10-8
## 
### TOM EDISON 
With a sputtering, spotty off
ense and improved defense the
scrappy Stanford Indians stopped
San Jose 10-S to record their first
victory of the season. The low
scoring contest was high-lighted
on the Stanford side bv the offen

sivo charges oi' Ray Hand ley anrl
I lie defensive rushes* of Tom Koss.
AS WAS expected, the Spartans
revealed to some 27,000 fans a
massive defensive lino augmented
with an aerial attack commanded
by the wing of quarterback Ken
Berry and the clutches of end

Dave Johnson.
Ralston attributed the lack of
sock in the offense, to the over
whelming amount of personal
fouls that koDt Stanford deep in
its own territory. A spectacular
50-yard run by Handley, who
turnd in his recond great rushing
game in a row, was called back
early in ihe game because of a
clipping penalty. San Jose re
ceived similar treatment when a
Berry to Bonds 57-yard aerial, ap
parently good for a TD was nulli
fied by a holding penalty. In all,
officials stepped off 154 yards
against both teams.
Handley duplicated his feat
later in the first half when he
again galloped around right end.
This set up Stanford's first score
of the ball game.
BKADKX BECK, who had
missed his first field goal attempt
of the game, placed the ball be
tween the up-rights from the 29
to put Stanford ahead 3-0 at half
time.
Alternating the running of Ed
Titus and John Travis with hook
passes to his ends, Ken Berry

masterminded several long drives
in the first half.
Stanford's pass defense vastly
improved in the second half but
Berry still managed to establish a
San Jose school record in the
number of passing attempts and
completions in a single game. The
.junior quarterback sensation con
nected for 165 yards overall, con
necting on 19 of 32 passes.
FULLBACK John Read, a soph
omore playing his first game as
a starter, averaged 4.7 yards on
and sweeps and line bucks and
seems entrenched as a regular.
Another brilliant right-end run
by Handley, voted the game's out
standing back, from the San Jose
46 to the 19 set up the only Stan
ford touchdown of the game.
With fullback Pete Middlekauff,
playing in his first game alter
a year's lay-off, and DeSylvia ex
changing running chores, the ball
was moved within San Jose's 10-
yard line. Middlekauff bucked
over for ihe score from two yards
out. Beck successfully completed
his fifteenth P.A.T. in a row, and
wilh 13 minutes to go Stanford

lcrl 10-0.
S;m Jose's kicking specialist
Dick Tatley failed on three field
goal attempts, anyone of which
would have changed ihe outcome
of the contest.
SAN JOSE'S only score of Hie
game came late in the fourth
quarter with Berry connecting on
five of seven passes. Culminating
the drive was a Berry to Paterson
combination for the six-pointer.
This same combination added two
more for the Spartans.
The final minutes of the game
saw a last ditch effort by San Jose
for a score but the cannon
sounded with Berry being thrown
for a loss on the mid-field stripe.

INDIAN SAFETY ALLAN CURR (21) battles John Travis (44) for the
football in Saturday's game against the San Jose Spartans.
With a sputtering, spotty off
ense and improved defense the
scrappy Stanford Indians stopped
San Jose 10-S to record their first
victory of the season. The low
scoring contest was high-lighted
on the Stanford side bv the offen

sivo charges oi' Ray Hand ley anrl
I lie defensive rushes* of Tom Koss.
AS WAS expected, the Spartans
revealed to some 27,000 fans a
massive defensive lino augmented
with an aerial attack commanded
by the wing of quarterback Ken
Berry and the clutches of end

Dave Johnson.
Ralston attributed the lack of
sock in the offense, to the over
whelming amount of personal
fouls that koDt Stanford deep in
its own territory. A spectacular
50-yard run by Handley, who
turnd in his recond great rushing
game in a row, was called back
early in ihe game because of a
clipping penalty. San Jose re
ceived similar treatment when a
Berry to Bonds 57-yard aerial, ap
parently good for a TD was nulli
fied by a holding penalty. In all,
officials stepped off 154 yards
against both teams.
Handley duplicated his feat
later in the first half when he
again galloped around right end.
This set up Stanford's first score
of the ball game.
BKADKX BECK, who had
missed his first field goal attempt
of the game, placed the ball be
tween the up-rights from the 29
to put Stanford ahead 3-0 at half
time.
Alternating the running of Ed
Titus and John Travis with hook
passes to his ends, Ken Berry

masterminded several long drives
in the first half.
Stanford's pass defense vastly
improved in the second half but
Berry still managed to establish a
San Jose school record in the
number of passing attempts and
completions in a single game. The
.junior quarterback sensation con
nected for 165 yards overall, con
necting on 19 of 32 passes.
FULLBACK John Read, a soph
omore playing his first game as
a starter, averaged 4.7 yards on
and sweeps and line bucks and
seems entrenched as a regular.
Another brilliant right-end run
by Handley, voted the game's out
standing back, from the San Jose
46 to the 19 set up the only Stan
ford touchdown of the game.
With fullback Pete Middlekauff,
playing in his first game alter
a year's lay-off, and DeSylvia ex
changing running chores, the ball
was moved within San Jose's 10-
yard line. Middlekauff bucked
over for ihe score from two yards
out. Beck successfully completed
his fifteenth P.A.T. in a row, and
wilh 13 minutes to go Stanford

lcrl 10-0.
S;m Jose's kicking specialist
Dick Tatley failed on three field
goal attempts, anyone of which
would have changed ihe outcome
of the contest.
SAN JOSE'S only score of Hie
game came late in the fourth
quarter with Berry connecting on
five of seven passes. Culminating
the drive was a Berry to Paterson
combination for the six-pointer.
This same combination added two
more for the Spartans.
The final minutes of the game
saw a last ditch effort by San Jose
for a score but the cannon
sounded with Berry being thrown
for a loss on the mid-field stripe.
