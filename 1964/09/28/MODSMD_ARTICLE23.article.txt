# LOCKER ROOM
## Defense Improved 
### 
It was hard to toll the winners
from the losers in the dressing
room Saturday following Stan
ford's narrow 10-8 win over San
Jose State.
A somewhat glum John Ralston
analyzed why his Indians, 10-point
favorites, nearly managed to lose
to the fired-up Spartans. "Our off
ense was just too inconsistent and
spotty," he said. "Many times
we'd get tho ball with bad field
position. Penalties also slowed us
down. When you have a long run
(Ray Ilandley's 49-year burst)
nullified it takes quite a bit of
the edge off the players."
RALSTON* was less unhappy

with the defense. "Our secondary
wasn't too bad on defense, al
though after John Guillory and
Craig Ritchey were injured, we
got into some trouble." The Stan
ford coach singled out for praise
the four Card defensive linemen,
who included Mike Hibler, Boh
Nichols, Tom Ross, Gary Potti
grew, and others.
Indian halfback Dick Ragsdale
felt that Stanford's pass blocking
for quarterback Terry DeSylvia
was poor, preventing long passes
and forcing the 5-9 quarterback to
run with the ball more often.
Safety man Allen Curr added
that "San Jose's ends acted la/.y
when they knew that they weren't
going to catch the ball on a play.
But when they did catch a pass,
they ran well."
Spartan coach Bob Titehenal,
brooding over his second narrow
loss in two weeks and San Jose's
19th loss to Stanford in 21 games,
felt that Stanford halfback Ray
Ilandley's end sweeps and San
Jose's failure to react to them
soon enough spelled the differ
ence.
TIIK BKI blow, in Titchenal's
mind, was the f>B-yard scoring
pass from Ken Berry to Bob
Bonds near the end of the first
half which was nullified by a hold
ing penalty. "This definitely hurt
us," said Titehenal. "The officials
said iJim) Ross had his hands
away from his body while block
ing. I don't know whether fie did
or not."
Although obviously happy with
his fourth win in 12 games as
Stanford coach, Ralston was
deeply worried about Iho team's
inability to combine a good off
ense and a good defense. "Our de
fense saved us this week," he said.
"Last week our offense looked
good and the defense lousy. We
have to get both working at the
same time."
In praise of the Spartan de
fense, Ralston added, "Some days
it seems like tho defense is a play
ahead of you. Today was an ex
ample of that."
