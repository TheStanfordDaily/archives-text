# NSA's Mixed Fortunes At Stanford
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Editor 
(The following is the first in a
five-part series on Hie National
Student Association, The series is
intended to provide an understand
ing of the organization and some
of the controversies surrounding
it.

Stanford has joined NSA throe
limes, withdrawn twice, and de
feated an attempt 1o affiliate once
by on overwhelming vote. For
fourteen years students have been
arguing about the value of affilia
tion with NSA. This year will be i
no exception.
The reason for all this discus
sion is simply that NSA is an im
portant organization important
in terms of money spent by the
ASSU (some $1,683 in 1961-65)
and in terms of the stands it
takes, stands considered to bo the I
voice of the American student
community by foreign student
unions and national educational
groups.
BASICALLY, the National Stu
dent Association is an organiza
tion made up of student govern
ments of some 330 colleges and
universities across the United
States.
Its stated purposes are to repre
sent the U.S. student community
to the international student move
ment, to provide the means for
U.S. students to take stands on
international and national issues
as well as issues of student gov
ernment and academic reform,
and to help improve student gov
ernment and the educational en
vironment of member campuses.
Delegates from member schools !
meet annually somewhere in the
Midwest in a National Student
Congress to shape NSA policy for
the coming year. This is done by
means of extensive legislation on
all manner of issues.
NSA IS DIVIDED into some 20 j
regions, each of which has confer-1
ences and sponsors programs j
(such as the conference on Indo
nesia and Malaysia last year at j
Stanford) and work projects.
On each campus there is an j
NSA Coordinator, charged w i th :
organizing NSA activities on cam
pus. i
NSA's fortunes at Stanford '
have fluctuated from almost una- :
nimous student approval to over
whelming disapproval. A brief :
study of these fluctuatng fortunes 1
follows. <
NSA INTEREST in a national ;
union of students first appeared t
in 1946. The initiative to begin I

: NSA came from 25 students who
I attended the World Student Con-j
gress in Prague. There Ihey met
with representatives of several
national unions of students, and ;
came away convinced that the
United States should have a simi
lar organization.
In the summer of 1947 Stanford
sent the leader of the campus- j
based National Student Organiza
tion and three other students to!
' the first National Student Con-j
I gress in Madison, Wisconsin,
where the NSA constitution was
I drawn up.
The delegates reported that j
joining NSA would benefit stu
dents a great deal. Said one dele- j
gate: "We are going to start out j
with goals that can be accom
plished. We are not going to make ;
the mistake of so many organiza-1
tionsâ€”that of too doggone many
ambitious but nebulous ideals. We
are out lo help the students as
students."
BESIDES the argument of di-!
root campus benefits, the empha- i
sis was on the need to represent i
U.S. students to other national i
unions of students: Stanford, ii j
was contended, had a responsibil
ity to make NSA strong. The stu-!
dent legislature voted 8-1 to join.!
By the spring of 1949, however, I
this eagerness had mellowed. It
was felt that most of what NSA j
had to offer the campus could bo I
done and had been done by cam-1
pus organizations, and there was I
some opposition, notably by !
graduate Executive Committee
representative Mark Hatfield, to
NSA's questionable representa- j
tion of student views.
An editorial in The Daily stated:
"while NSA has not been success
ful at Stanford this year, Ihe or-j

ganization is still young and un
dergoing local and national grow
ing pains." The Ex-Com (the
equivolent of LASSU) voted una
nimously to continue affiliation
with NSA for- one more year.
NSA EVIDENTLY failed its
j test, and on April 12, 1950 the pro
posed NSA budget was defeated,
jwith the provision that campus
organizations would carry on
NSA's local activities such as I
j seminars, conferences, exchange
programs, etc. It was felt that I
the National Student Congress did i
not benefit Stanford government j
information was useless to "estab-j
lished" schools.
I In October 1953 Stanford again !
'affiliated with NSA on a provi
i sional basis. The issues were < 1)
whether NSA was worth the
money, at least $800 a year, and
(2) whether Stanford could jus-!
tify the political stands taken by j
NSA when its delegates to thoi
| Congress wore not sure of the j
general feeling of Stanford stu-;
I dents.
I The delegates to the 1954 stu-j
! dent Congress reported that they
| "had learned little but contributed j
i a lot." On November 10 perman-1
I ent membership was approved by I
a vote of 10 to 3. It was argued
that Stanford could help strength- 1
en NSA and make up for its in-1
efficiency and impracticality, es
pecially if it took an active leader
ship role.
THE DELEGATES to (he 1955
Congress returned with mixed
feelings. It was felt that delegates !
gained a lot, but the question j
again arose as to the value of the
Congress to the campus. Stated
ASSU President George Ralph:
"I think the association has a
value as a youth movement, in its
concern for creating student inter
est. in education and in world
affairs, but I think the connec
tion with student government is
somewhat artificial."
On February 8, 1956, a petition
signed by 5 per cent of the student
body was presented to LASSU
requesting disaffiliation. Throe
weeks of debate ensued, climaxed
by a student referendum calling
for disaffiliation by a vote of 642
to 563.
Most agreed on the attractive- i
ness of NSA's ideals, but dis
agreed on whether it had suc
ceeded in putting them into prac
tice. One delegate said that the
National Congress "as a party,
was a great success, but as far
as doing anything concrete, it was
pretty much of a failure."
THE NSA PROPONENTS do
scribed it as a "marketplace of
ideas," a place to develop leader

ship." "NSA's final function,"
I said one debater, "is as a means
of discharging responsibility to
society." Some pointed to the
value of student government load
ers getting together to talk over
problems, but NSA opponents
charged that only problems wore
exchanged, not answers.
The issue lay comparatively
dormant until 1960 when LASSU,
j while opposing re-affiliation, de
cided to submit the issue to a
I student vote.
Opponents of NSA used the fa
i miliar arguments: Stanford would
I not benefit and NSA was not rep
resentative, especally with the
I National Executive Committee,
the year-round overseer of NSA
empowered at the time to pass
legislation in iho name of the
membership without Congress ap
! proval.
NSA BACKERS pointed to the
clear opportunity for Stanford
i leadership. The benefits of NSA,
according to a Daily editorial,
"are an increased interest in and
knowledge of important issues
and events accruing from campus
I leadership by Stanford delegates
I to the conferences, and the par
ticipation in a national student
I movement to work for the needs
and desires of the students." The
| proposal to re-join NSA was
trounced 1,435 to 671.
Stanford's present affiliation
with NSA was brought about in
the spring of 1962 when a student
referendum voted in favor, 799
< to 614. Opponents again claimed
| that NSA did not represent the
students: "Even if the student
government of every American
college and university were affili
ated with it, NSA would not rep
resent the American student, but
only the student governments.
And student governments are
notoriously unrepresentative."
The supporters of the referen
dum argued that NSA's activities
in the international student area
were of paramount importance,
and that even though NSA might
not be entirely representative, it
was the most representative of
any national student organization '
and its voice was considered in in- j
ternational student circles to be
the voice of American students. ;
Stanford has been an active

member in NSA since 1962, hav
ing been a driving force both at
National Student Congresses and
in the regional organization.
In the next two articles, NSA's
I international and campus activi
ties will be summarized, followed
by articles analyzing this sum
