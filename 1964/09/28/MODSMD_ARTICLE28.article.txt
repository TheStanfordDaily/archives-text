# Criticism Tempered With Understanding
## 
### 
A revolution in the editorial policy of this
newspaper has occurred in the last ten years,
reflecting dramatically a more intelligent, skepti
cal and dynamic student body.
This revolution has brought to bear on the
administration and student government an in
creasing pressure to justify or to change estab
lished policy.
There has developed what we choose to call
the "gadfly" concept, which states that The Daily
shall act as a conscience to the University com
munity; that injustice, error, or incompetence in
any quarter—student, faculty, or administrative—
shall not be tolerated and shall not escape expo
sure and critical evaluation.
We intend to continue the gadfly tradition.
A second, less fortunate development has
paralleled this new era of student concern about
the educational environment. It is a sort of par
anoia on the part of both administration and stu
dents with regard to each others motives and
abilities.
Some student leaders and much of the student
body see behind every action of the administra
tion au evil design. We have been urged to stand
up against the diabolical forces located through
out the University and, with a few heroic faculty
members on our side, defend our rights, which
are surely to be further abridged.
On the other hand the administration, in re
action to tlu* new student criticism, has evidenced
on occasion a feeling that "all these young wliip
persnappers don't know w hat they re talking
about, and maybe il we just wait long enough,
things will blow over. Students, we are told, just
don't understand, and anyway, what are they so
excited about?
These attitudes are both badly mistaken and,
unless changed, w ill block progress 011 this cam
pus.
The Daily pledges itself to do its part in eras
ing the mistrust and misunderstanding which has
been the source of so much frustration. We have
sometimes been guilty of writing inflamed edi
torials without know ing the w hole story and have
sometimes failed to understand the reasons be
hind the positions of administrators and student

leaders. We luive too often succumbed to the
ever-present temptation "to make the adminis
tration look bad."
But we now pledge ourselves to a policy of
active and reasoned dialogue on all campus
issues. We have offered space on a semi-regular
basis for various key administrators and student
leaders to explain policy.
All this is not to say that active criticism will
end or that we are satisfied with the status quo.
On thf contrary, we mean only to make our criti
cism constructive, for positive evaluation and rea
soned dialogue, not pointless railing, are the
forces needed to carry this university beyond the
"edge of greatness" on which it has lingered too
long.
As we face another year, there is much to be
done toward that end. While education at Stan
ford is constantly improving, there remain gap
ing deficiencies where student opinions can and
should come into play.
While student government is becoming ever
more sophisticated and valuable, it has far to go
to gain the respect of both the students it claims
to represent and the University it is working to
improve.
While students are given some latitude in
handling disciplinary problems, the system is ill
defined and carries a disturbing potential for ar
bitrary, unexplained action by the Dean's office.
While Stanford has moved closer to allowing
freedom for political groups to operate on cam
pus. the heavy hand of administrative regulations
and student bureaucracy threatens to negate
some of the hard-won gains.
And while social regulations at Stanford are
comparatively liberal, there remains a frightening
tendency on the part of the administration to
enforce its own moral values by threatening dis
missal of those who stray from the straight and
narrow.
We will approach these issues and many
others in the coming months with an ever-active
concern, tempered with reason and understand
ing rather than contempt. This is the best way,
we believe, to move Stanford toward that vision
which all of us share—Stanford, as a truly great
universitv.

The Daily pledges itself to do its part in eras
ing the mistrust and misunderstanding which has
been the source of so much frustration. We have
sometimes been guilty of writing inflamed edi

sometimes failed to understand the reasons be
hind the positions of administrators and student

leaders. We luive too often succumbed to the
ever-present temptation "to make the adminis
tration look bad."
But we now pledge ourselves to a policy of
active and reasoned dialogue on all campus
issues. We have offered space on a semi-regular
basis for various key administrators and student
leaders to explain policy.
All this is not to say that active criticism will
end or that we are satisfied with the status quo.
On thf contrary, we mean only to make our criti
cism constructive, for positive evaluation and rea

forces needed to carry this university beyond the
"edge of greatness" on which it has lingered too
long.
As we face another year, there is much to be
done toward that end. While education at Stan
ford is constantly improving, there remain gap

should come into play.
While student government is becoming ever
more sophisticated and valuable, it has far to go
to gain the respect of both the students it claims
to represent and the University it is working to
improve.
While students are given some latitude in
handling disciplinary problems, the system is ill
defined and carries a disturbing potential for ar
bitrary, unexplained action by the Dean's office.
While Stanford has moved closer to allowing
freedom for political groups to operate on cam
pus. the heavy hand of administrative regulations
and student bureaucracy threatens to negate
some of the hard-won gains.
And while social regulations at Stanford are
comparatively liberal, there remains a frightening
tendency on the part of the administration to
enforce its own moral values by threatening dis
missal of those who stray from the straight and
narrow.
We will approach these issues and many
others in the coming months with an ever-active
concern, tempered with reason and understand
ing rather than contempt. This is the best way,
we believe, to move Stanford toward that vision
which all of us share—Stanford, as a truly great

A revolution in the editorial policy of this
newspaper has occurred in the last ten years,
reflecting dramatically a more intelligent, skepti

This revolution has brought to bear on the
administration and student government an in
creasing pressure to justify or to change estab

There has developed what we choose to call
the "gadfly" concept, which states that The Daily
shall act as a conscience to the University com
munity; that injustice, error, or incompetence in
any quarter—student, faculty, or administrative—
shall not be tolerated and shall not escape expo
sure and critical evaluation.
We intend to continue the gadfly tradition.
A second, less fortunate development has
paralleled this new era of student concern about
the educational environment. It is a sort of par
anoia on the part of both administration and stu
dents with regard to each others motives and
abilities.
Some student leaders and much of the student
body see behind every action of the administra

up against the diabolical forces located through
out the University and, with a few heroic faculty
