# Editorial Responsibility
## 
### 
It has been traditional at the beginning ol
Daily volumes to outline general editorial policy.
In an election year such a statement is of crucial
importance, as it defines the role ol the news
paper with regard to campus discussion of the
campaign, as well as other issues.
We subscribe wholeheartedly to what has
been labeled the "social responsibility" theory of
journalism. The theory holds that a newspaper,
especially in a monopoly, compulsory-subscrip
tion situation as at Stanford, ha* the duty to pre
sent the news in an unbiased fashion, separate

from its editorial opinions, to allow dissent on its
editorial pages, and moreover to print a repre
sentative sampling of the views of its readership
as revealed through letters and submited articles.
We will not hesitate to take stands on the
great issues of the campaign, but neither will we
prohibit on this page the open expression of dis
agreement. Indeed, we solicit such disagreement.
It seems to us essential to the concept of a
university to allow an unfettered exchange ol
ideas; it is also good journalism, since such an
exhange makes for a more exciting newspaper.
