# CONRAD
## New Daily Political Cartoonist 
### 
The Daily is proud to announce the addition of
prize-winning cartoonist Paul Conrad to its edi
torial pages.
The men appearing above are but the leading
players in the huge east of characters which ca
vort daily above the distinctive Conrad signature.
Conrad strives always to avoid following a par*
: titular party-line on the questions he probes with
i his pen. Ho considers each issue separately, and
I attacks everyone with equal glee and with equal
j humor.

The year 1964 marked the high point of
Conrad's long and successful career. He received
the Pulitzer prize for outstanding editorial cartoon
ing "throughout the entire year" proceeding the
award.
His "flair for tapping the comic vein" has been
noted approvingly by Time Magazine as has his
remarkable draftsmanship. We feel that. Paul Con
rad will add both perceptive comment and a sorely
needed element of humor to the politically charged
months ahead.
