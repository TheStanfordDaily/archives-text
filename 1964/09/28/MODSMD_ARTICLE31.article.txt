## Hallmark Of Goldwaterism 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
Sen. Barry Goldwater has been
i telling 1 he country that the Presi
dent has become too powerful and
that this very powerful President
i has been much too weak to win
the cold war and stamp out crimes
! of violence in our city streets.
The Senator has based his cam
paign on the thesis that the pow
ers of the Presidency must be re
duced and that then a smaller
and weaker President can and
should do away with the most
troublesome problems at home
and abroad.
This central contradiction is
Ihe hallmark of Goldwaterism.
The senator finds it easy to be
lieve that a smaller, shrunken,
I much less costly government can
j overawe the Communist nations
jointly and severally, can com
j mand the Western Alliance and
! can put Latin America in order.
] In Barry Goldwatcr's mind, a
■ cheaper government could act
| more strongly, a weaker govern-
I ment could see that the cities are
i successfully policed.
HOW, ONE must ask, can we
run the world and yet pay less?
; The fact, to be sure, is that to do
j what Senator Goldwater wants to
i have done demands a much more
! powerful government than we
have today.
Why does ho think it doesn't?
I The plain truth, I submit, is that
| he is a dreamer, that when Barry
! Goldwater talks about public af
fairs he lives in a world of fan
tasy. He dreams that all things
are possible. For it is only in the
world of dreams that weaker
Presidents can do gigantic things,
that great results can be achieved
| at little cost.
The unworldliness is a part of
his personal attractiveness. In his
world everything becomes pos
sible when you have said that it
should happen. There is no clash

I between the theories and the:
facts. The hard realities do not 1
really exist. It was this boy who
has never grown up fully who
said the other day that when he
was President he would install
his ham radio set in the White
House and would then be able to
talk to a number of heads of state, j
THIS UNWORDLY divorce
from reality is not always charm- j
ing. Many dreams can be quite,
cruel, and when Senator Gold
water talks about the poor he
can bo very cruel. He has been
making much of our common
worries about the increase of
crime. And exploiting this worry
for political purposes, he has been
claiming that he, Barry Gold
water, can stop the crime which
Lyndon Johnson is, so says Gold
water, promoting.
How is President Johnson pro
moting crime? By backing the
civil rights act and by sponsoring
Social Security and welfare meas
ures. These, according to Senator
Goldwater's Minneapolis speech,
are causing "a breakdown in pri
vate responsibility" and in "re
spect for law and order."
The Senator asks that "if it is j
entirely proper for government to j
take from some to give to others,

: I hen won't some men be led to
I believe thai they can rightfully
; take from anyone who has more i
' than they?"
THIS MUST BK about the first
time in 200 years that any public
man has argued that charity cor
rupts the characters of the poor.;
: It is not only charity that is '
corrupting the poor. The search |
; for justice is also corrupting the
j poor. The Goldwater theory about ,
civil rights for Negroes is that ;
jby enacting laws about these!
rights Ihe Negroes have been in
| cited to demand these rights. Ac-j
| cording to one of his leading sup
j porters, perhaps the most distin- i
l guished intellectual in the Gold
water camp, Prof. Milton Fried-!
man of Chicago University, the *
civil rights act "has directed Ne-1
gro resentment against whites." J
Thus, it is not the grievances that
incite the Negroes; it is the effort j
to redress the grievances.
The campaign has been under
i way only for about two weeks, 1
j and it begins to look as if the real
I issue to be decided is not whether
i this or that policy or this or that
I piece of legislation is sound, but i
i whether Barry Goldwater is fit j
to be President in the hard world
of reality.

THIS UNWORDLY divorce
from reality is not always charm- j

cruel, and when Senator Gold
water talks about the poor he
can bo very cruel. He has been
making much of our common
worries about the increase of
crime. And exploiting this worry
for political purposes, he has been
claiming that he, Barry Gold
water, can stop the crime which
Lyndon Johnson is, so says Gold
water, promoting.
How is President Johnson pro
moting crime? By backing the
civil rights act and by sponsoring
Social Security and welfare meas
ures. These, according to Senator
Goldwater's Minneapolis speech,
are causing "a breakdown in pri
vate responsibility" and in "re
spect for law and order."
The Senator asks that "if it is j
entirely proper for government to j
take from some to give to others,

: I hen won't some men be led to

' than they?"

Sen. Barry Goldwater has been
i telling 1 he country that the Presi

that this very powerful President
i has been much too weak to win
the cold war and stamp out crimes

The Senator has based his cam

ers of the Presidency must be re
duced and that then a smaller
and weaker President can and
should do away with the most
troublesome problems at home
and abroad.
This central contradiction is
Ihe hallmark of Goldwaterism.

man has argued that charity cor
rupts the characters of the poor.;
: It is not only charity that is '
corrupting the poor. The search |
; for justice is also corrupting the
j poor. The Goldwater theory about ,
civil rights for Negroes is that ;
jby enacting laws about these!
rights Ihe Negroes have been in
| cited to demand these rights. Ac-j
| cording to one of his leading sup
j porters, perhaps the most distin- i
l guished intellectual in the Gold
water camp, Prof. Milton Fried-!
man of Chicago University, the *
civil rights act "has directed Ne-1
gro resentment against whites." J
Thus, it is not the grievances that
incite the Negroes; it is the effort j
to redress the grievances.
The campaign has been under
i way only for about two weeks, 1
j and it begins to look as if the real
I issue to be decided is not whether
i this or that policy or this or that
I piece of legislation is sound, but i
i whether Barry Goldwater is fit j
to be President in the hard world
of reality.
