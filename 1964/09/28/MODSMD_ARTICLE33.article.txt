# Editor, The Daily:
## Are Freshmen 'Stable'? 
### 
Dear Sir:
In an orientation speech Dean
Wert said of the enterings class.
. . you are completely normal,
stable, relatively uncomplicated,
somewhat complacent, college stu
dents. . .
In the July 1964 issue of At
lantic Monthly Dr. James Paul
sen, psychiatrist in chief of Stu
dent Health Service at Stanford,
sa id:
"If many problems of students
are emotional how common are
such problems? A reasonable
estimate is that 8 to 13 percent
of the students are severely
troubled and will endure compli
cation in function during their
college period. Another 10 to 1.1
percent are mildly to moderately
troubled, but without serious
impairment in functioning. A re

maining 20 percent could benefit
! from professional contact if only
j for an hour or two."
The point of my letter is that
the opinion expressed by Dean
Wert isn't quite accurate and tlmt
i for a student to experience diffi
culties, perhaps serious ones, in
adjusting to college life is by no
means unusual. He or she
shouldn't hesitate to seek help
from the Counseling and Testing
Center or from the Student
Health Service.
â€”JAMES TURNER
