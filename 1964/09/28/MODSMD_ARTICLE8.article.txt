sounded from cannon booms dur
ing the San Jose football game
Saturday in what may have in
itiated a new Stanford tradition.
A muzzle-loading six-pounder
cannon, a new addition to the
Stanford Marching Band, was
used sparsely in its first outing.
It will be fired at home games
after a Stanford score.
808 SODZA of Castro Valley,
a licensed pyro-technician, fired
the 600-pound gun on at least two
occasions after a Stanford field
goal and at the end of the game,
but there was no blast after Stan

the nearness of an official.
Sou/a was hired by the band
for a yearly fee of $100 to man

state law which requires an ac

gun.
Band members found the an

from the 1820's.

barrel re bored and nickel-plated,
