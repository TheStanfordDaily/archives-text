WHO SAYS THAT THE ONLY
SHOES UNIVERSITY MEN
WEAR ARE MOCCASINS?
-■V
We can't dispute their popularity. Some
like them shined. Some like them scuffed.
However, as experts in traditional univer
sity clothing and furnishings, we know that
college men—in addition to being moccasin
moguls— have definite shoe preference.
And, we specialize in these preferences.
From our comprehensive collections of
University Shop shoes, all made to our ex
acting standards, we show the favored
wing tip, at 21.50; ihe plain toe cordovan
at 22.50; ihe sneaker at 10.00; and ihe moc
casin at 16.50.
