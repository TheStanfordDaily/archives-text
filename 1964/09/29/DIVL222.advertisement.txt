What the Bible Calls "Sin"
Quite a few people joke about secret sins not quite realizing that sin
is a state of being. Sins,' which are specific deeds of wickedness like murder
and fornication, stem from the state of sin, just as leaves ' stem" from a branch.
The problem is not that you should give up secret vices and so-called pleasures,
i but that the underlying disease called sin' should be cured.
"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adultery, fornication,
i theft, false wilness, slander." (Matthew 15:19)
Sin is "lawlessness," or basically, living in independence of God. God
is life, God is truth, God is love, God is wisdom, God is light. We human I
beings have been deluded by a Dark Power (Satan) into believing that we
can successfully live in independence of our Creating Source. When the Bible ,
says (Romans 6:23) that "the wages of sin is death" it means that the result '
i of living in independence of God is complete and permanent separation from
| Him who alone is life and truth and love. Infected by sin we human beings
have been disconnected from the Power Supply of Life and are like cut-off
| branches, dying in our sins, withering and perishing daily, unless we seek
restoration to the Tree of Life.
But the good news of the New Testament concerns a God who really cares:
"The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Jesus
Christ our Lord." (Romans 6:23)
To become plugged into the Power Supply of Life, restored to a proper rela- S
tionship to God, is a very real experience which happens to each individual
who personnally (by a commitment of his will) receives Jesus Christ as his Lord.
This can be done at any time or any place, in a moment's time —such as in the
quiet of one's room, or in counsel with a Christian friend. No human mediators
are necessary or required. However, the commitment to God must be personal
| and individual,
Man lives under the great delusion that he can be independent of God. Un
fortunately for him, lie cannot! Tins is w 1 y the Apostle Paul tells those who hove
i received Christ as Lord, "Do not yield your members to sin as instruments of
, wickedness, but yield yourselves to God as men who have been brought from
I | death to life, and your members to Cod ns instruments of righteousness. Foi
| sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under
I (God s) grace ... Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to anyone as
obedient slaves, you are the slaves of lite one whom you obey, either of sin,
which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness." (Romans
6:12-16)
You are today either a servant of sin, or a servant of Jesus Christ. But a
I servant vou are, and by no means are you the master of your own des
tiny and ruler of your own life. Another has you in His control elthei |
Sin (the personification of evil which the Bible calls the devil or Satan), oi j
Jesus Christ (the Lord of Life), is youi master Whom are you serving? Whom
are you depending upon? Who sustains and energizes your life? Don't be fooled
by the delusion of self-sufficiency. Let Jesus Christ be your Lord today.
