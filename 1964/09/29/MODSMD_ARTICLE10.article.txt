# Physics Professor Has Revolutionary Theory
## 
### 
Tho world of physics was
startled this summer by a Stan-
Ford University scientist's pro
posal published in one of the
field's most respected profes
sional journals.
In the June 15 issue of the
Physical Review, Prof. William
A. Little discusses the "Possibil
ity of Synthesizing an Organic
Superconductor." His article sug
gests the artificial creation of an
organic molecule that would be
"superconducting" at ordinary
room temperature or even when
rod hot.
SUPERCONDUCTIVITY is an
amazing kind of electrical per
petual motion observed only in
certain metals cooled to near ab
solute zero (-459 F.). When an
electric current is induced in such
a metal (usually tin), it flows in
definitely without any loss of
power. All resistance to the flow
of electrons through it disap
pears.
Enormously powerful electi'o
magnet.s as strong as 250,000
gauss — 500,000 times the force
of the earth's magnetic field
have been built on this principle.
Such magnets were unthinkable a
few years ago.
A host; of other potential uses
—frictionless bearings, lossless
power lines, superconducting
atom smashers of unmatched en
ergy ■— await technological de
velopment. But some of these glit
tering possibilities remain just
out of reach, mainly because of
the surrounding prison of Dewar
flasks and complex apparatus
needed to deepfreeze tho super
conducting metal.
IF PROF, LITTLE'S theory
proves correct and the substance
can bo artificially produced, the
prison walls will fall and count
less new applications will be
added to the superconducting
list. But, ho cautions, that day
may be years away — or perhaps
never.
"If it is possible to create such
a substance," he said, "it is in
credible to me that nature didn't
make it and use it first.
"When the idea first occurred
to me two years ago I was sure
I had overlooked something vital.
Yet the more I studied it, the less
I could find wrong with it.
Neither could the colleagues with
whom I talked about it."
IT WAS THE chain-like struc
ture of DNA, the protein mole
cule containing the code of life

which governs growth in all liv
ing organisms, thai gave him Ihe
idea.
His modol of a superconduct
ing molecule has a single "spine"
of atoms tied together by alter
nating double and single chemical
! bonds. It is similar to either of
1 the two helical chains in DNA,
though those do not have alter
| nating bonds.
i To this spine are attached rib
like side chains of other atoms
comparable to tho "ladder rungs"
between DNA's two helical chains.
The model superconducting mole
cule roughly resembles a human
spine and its rib cage.
WHILE PROF. LITTLE point
edly leaves the biochemical as
pects of his molecule to others
l"It would be folly for a physi
cist to attempt to experiment in
such an environment," he said)
—he has worked with a research
associate Dr. Derek Griffith, to

produce a key part of it.
This is a piece consisting of
two side chains joined by a seg
ment of spine. The side-chain sub
stance is part of a well-known
dye molecule used for sensitizing
photographic plates. Known
chemically as a diethyl-cyanine
iodide and made up of carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen, and iodine,
it meets the required side-chain
specifications for interaction of
its electrons with those in the
spine.
The segment of spine is made
up of carbon and hydrogen atoms.
It remains for the experimenters
!to string these spine-and-double
! side-chain pieces together into one
long molecule. Groups at other
i institutions, with whom tho Stan
i ford physicist has talked, are
studying the problem, too.
"THERE ARE many other pos
sible structures similar to the
one (described) involving a semi
conducting chain for the spine
and dye-like molecule for the side
; chain which would also be super
conducting," he said. "It is un
likely that our particular choice
| would be the easiest to synthe
size or have the optimum super
conducting properties, but it
illustrates the possibility.
THE DN'A MOLECULE itself
and some of the polypeptide (an
other protein) molecules might
bo superconducting in water or
an appropriate solvent, Prof. Lit
tle added. Electrical charges of
the solvent's molecules could
weaken the forces holding each
electron in its respective atom of
the chain, thus allowing electrons
| to move atom-to-atom in a free
! flowing electric current.
Born in South Africa, Prof. Lit
tle holds doctoral degrees from
that country's Rhodes University
and from the University of Glas
gow in Scotland. He joined the
Stanford Physics Department in
1958, and lives with his family in
Palo Alto.
