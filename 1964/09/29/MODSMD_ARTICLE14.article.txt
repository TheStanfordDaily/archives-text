SAN FRANCISCO fAP) â€”
Stanford football coach John Ral
ston dropped a hint Monday that
UCLA may see lots of passes in
the Los Angeles Coliseum on
Saturday night.
Asked at the Northern Cali
fornia Football Writers and
Sportscasters meeting if Terry
DeSylvia would be his starting
quarterback, Ralston replied:
"Terry probably will start with
Dick Berg and Dave Lewis both
ready to go. We may change that
up a little depending on what
offense we come up with.
"We figure they'll be set to try
to stop Ilie running of Ray Hand
ley. We may have to come up
with something different."
The running of 190-pound half
back Handley has featured the
Indians' first two outings, a loss
to Washington State and a vic
tory over San Jose State, th e
latter 10-8.
Stanford came out of that one
with only one major injury. De
fensive back Craig Ritchey suf
fered a deep thigh bruise and
may miss the UCLA tilt.
