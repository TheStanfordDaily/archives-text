# HOT LINE TO THE SIDELINE
## Teams Pull Upsets 
### Tom Elias 
West Coast football has come in for a lot of criticism and fieri-
Ision from so-called experts the nation over in the past few years.
| But in 1 9til at least, the worm seems to have turned.
The beginning of the worm's turning came on Sept. 12 in Pitt
Stadium, Pittsburgh, Pa. On that perhaps fateful day, UCLA, chosen
by most for the seventh position in the newly enlarged Athletic
Association of Western Universities, turned on tho Pitt Panthers
[and beat them IT to 12. This was tho first time in history that a
[western team had beaten Pilt on its home grounds.
Last week, the turning continued. Oregon Slato went down be
fore Northwestern in Dyeho Stadium near Chicago, but that was one
iof only two intersectional losses suffered by Coast teams. Against
that defeat and the Air Force's 3-2 whipping of Washington could
I be stacked the wins of Cal over highly favored and highly regarded
Missouri, of USC over underdog Colorado in the Coliseum at Los
Angeles, and of Oregon over Brigham Young in Provo, Utah. Stan
ford meantime was losing a conference game to WSU and UCLA
was idle.
BEST WAS YET TO COMIC
But the best was yet lo come. It came on Saturday in Norman,
Oklahoma, when Southern Cal got revenge for last year's beating
at the hands of the nationally top-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. SC
I lost last year in the Coliseum by less than one touchdown, but this
(year ii won by more than four, 40 to 14. At the same time Illinois,
defending Big Ten tit list and Rose Bowl champ, was barely squeak
ing by Cal at Berkeley by a margin of about two inches.
Oregon State got into the win column, too, beating Colorado's
Buffalos at Boulder, and Oregon continued the Coast domination
of Pitt, beating tho newly de-fanged Panthers 22 to 13.
Washington State was the only AAWU team to lose this week
end, bowing Saturday night to Wyoming while UCLA was continu
iing'its new-found domination of Eastern teams, beating Penn State
121-14 to run its record to 2-0.
Overall, thus, the newly reconstituted Pacific Coast Conference
is 9-4 in intersect ional play, 10-4 against all non-conference opposi
tion if Stanford's Saturday conquest of San Jose is included.
What then, does all thus mean to Stanford? First, it means the
Tribe's league is going to be much tougher than had been antici
pated. With UCLA, chosen for seventh in most pre-season polls,
j unbeaten against teams normally among the nation's best, and with
WSU already 1-0 in conference play, Stanford is going to have to
jshow a lot more than it did the last two weeks to go anywhere at
all, let. alone lo the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
NO LEAGUE DOORMAT THIS YEAR
i For there seems to be no real doormat in the league in 1964.
Last year, WSU was ihe doormat for everyone but Stanford. This
year the Cougars may repeat in that dubious distinction, but even
[that won't do Stanford much.good, having already lost to them.
Beating anyone in the PCC this year will be awfully hard for
anyone, and that includes Stanford. Coming off a squeaky 10-8 win
over usually hapless San Jose State, the Tribe now faces UCLA,
the nation's biggest giant killer this fall, on the Bruins' home grounds
in the Coliseum.
A Stanford win would seem to fit the form chart for upsets thus
far this year, with UCLA now an almost prohibitive favorite.
But favorites have been known to fall, particularly this fall.
!Stanford would need to patch up only one area of its defense to be
!capable of a really stunning upsetâ€”that is the pass defense, far
and away the worst part of the Tribe's game so far. If John Ral
ston can come up with an effective umbrella, the Indians could
i come home a winner, unlikely as it now seems.
