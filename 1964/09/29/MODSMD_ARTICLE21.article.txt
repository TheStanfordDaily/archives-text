# A 						Disappointing Campaign
## 
### 
The nomination of Senator Harry Goldwater
for tlu 1 Presidency of the United States has
given this nation the unprecedented burden of
choosing the course of domestic and foreign
affairs for the coming four years, il not for the
rest ol the century.
For the first time since the Roosevelt "revolu
tion, the Republican Party has nominated a
candidate who appeals to those who believe
that there is a harmful trend toward central
government control of local affairs and who dis
agree fundamental!) with the strategic assump
tions behind the bi-partisan foreign policy of the
last twenty years.
In short, we have an opportunity this year
to debate the most fundamental issues before
the world, issues which are at the heart of the
liberal-conservative split in American polities.
But the campaign to date has been a disap
pointment. It has been a campaign of strong
emotions but of little substance, of name-calling

and diatribe rather than concrete proposals to
effect either the "great society" or the Cold War
"victor)'." Goldwater and Miller have spent more
time making fun of Senator Humphrey's name
than they have spent developing real issues.
President Johnson has kept himself "above" any
issues, allowing proxies to defend his policies
and attack his opponents.
The one opportunity for a real confrontation
of the candidates, a Great Debate similar to
those of 1960, has been refused by President
Johnson, even though Goldwater has offered to
foot the bill. This is unfortunate, as it denies
the public the chance to see both men in action,
to hear them defend their views first hand, and
to use the comparison to make a more intelligent
selection.
We hope that the campaign changes its com
plexion considerably before November 3. If it
does not, this country will have wasted an his
toric opportunity for meaningful debate — an
opportunity which will not soon be repeated.
