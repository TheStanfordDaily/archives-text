# A
						New Low

The trail w as blazed to an incredible new low
in yellow journalism yesterday when t li e
Hearst-controlled Sai i Francisco lixtnn i tier
screamed "ASSASSINATION! across the top
of its front page.
The headline, a rarity in San Francisco for
its reference to national news, called attention
to the report of the Warren Commission.
One can only wonder to what lengths San
I'Yanciseo journalists are willing to go to sell

newspapers. Is it necessary to stoop to the kind
of cheap sensationalism that appeals to the
reader as though he were some sort of animal,
rather than a human being? Is it impossible to
increase circulation and still remain within the
limits of good taste?
Those students who shared with us the faint
nausea and shock of seeing that headline will
surely join in censuring this grossest of indecen
cies.
