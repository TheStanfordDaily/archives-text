# THE 						National Security Agency is a totally unique organization ... and offers creative research opportunities in the art and science of sophisticated communications
## 
### 
There is absolutely no other organiza
tion like it . .. no other organization doing
the same important work, or offering the
same wealth of opportunity for imaginative
thinkers in the Liberal Arts, as well as the
Physical and Engineering Sciences.
I he National Security Agency is a major
research arm of the Department of Defense,
htit its influence and responsibilities are far
broader. It works closely with many indus
trial and research institutions: it has special
access to scientific information at universi
ties and other Government laboratories;
and it enjoys close consulting arrangements
with scientists of commanding stature. NSA
stall' members enjoy all the benefits of Fed
eral employment without the requirements
imposed by the Civil Service system.
What does NSA do that warrants
this unique stature?
NSA approaches the subject of sophisti
cated communications from these original
standpoints:
1, Creating secure communications sys
tems and equipments unknown anywhere
else, and devising special refinements for
computers & edp systems that will increase
our handling capabilities. I his means that
Communications Engineers, Computer De
sign Specialists, Mathematicians, Program
mers. and Systems Analysts, all contribute
to the design of antennas, transmitters, re
ceivers. and terminal equipment ... to ex
periments using new semiconductors, mag
netic film, superconductive devices, etc.,
resulting in new logic circuit* and memory
units, better high-gain arrays for UHF
radio systems, higher-capacity data han

dling terminal equipment, more effective
speech band-width compression . . . and
scores of similar advances.
2. By the very nature of "secure" com
munications, assuring the continuing in
vulnerability of U.S. communications
through cryptologic procedures and tech
niques. Bccause cryptology and its crypto
graphic counterpart are not taught else
where, mathematicians, scientists—and all
others with appropriate intellectual curios
ity—will be taught this challenging new
discipline right at NSA. Work in this field
may involve specially-designed computers,
television, computer-to-computer data
links, and edp programming. (Even music,
philosophy, or the classics may be useful
prerequisites for cryptology!)
3. Translating written data, and presenting
the crux of the material in meaningful
form. This is the home of the linguistics
expert and the languages graduate—enab
ling the talented graduate to make the
most of his or her particular gift, and
quickly expand familiarity with other
tongues.
11l all that NSA does, there is seldom
any existing precedent. Only NSA pioneers
in secure communications on this broad a
scale, so only NSA offers the college gradu
ate the best chance to make immediate use
of his disciplined thinking . . . without
years of post-graduate experience. All these
features —together with its well-instru
mented laboratories, libraries, and profes
sional staff of specialists in amazingly
varied fields—provide a stimulating aca
demic atmosphere for individual accom
plishment.

LIBERAL ARTS SENIORS: KISK,
This is most important: To apply for an NSA position, all students LXCLPT Msthe
maticlanr., Engineers, and Physicists must take the PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATION
TEST scheduled for Saturday, October 24th. Stop in at your Placement Office and
ask for the NSA Professional Qualification Test brochure ... fill out and mail in the
application card enclosed inside . . . and bring to the test the ticket you will receive
by mail.

NSA is locatod in expanding facilities at Fort
George G. Meade, Maryland—halfway between
Washington and Baltimore. It is handy to trans
portation facilities, the University of Maryland
and Johns Hopkins, suburban or rural living (in
town living, too, now that the new circumferen
tial highways are completed) .., and the Chesa
oeakc Bay resort teglon.


There is absolutely no other organiza

the same important work, or offering the
same wealth of opportunity for imaginative
thinkers in the Liberal Arts, as well as the
Physical and Engineering Sciences.
I he National Security Agency is a major
research arm of the Department of Defense,

broader. It works closely with many indus
trial and research institutions: it has special
access to scientific information at universi
ties and other Government laboratories;
and it enjoys close consulting arrangements
with scientists of commanding stature. NSA
