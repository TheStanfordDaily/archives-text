# NSA, ISC Work Against Communist Student Groups

### CARL SCHMIDT 
The following article is the sec
ond in a week long 1 series examin
ing the various aspects of the
United States National Student
Association. Carl Schmidt is
Stanford's NSA coordinator.

The present situation in inter
national student affairs has its
roots in the period immediately
following the close of World War
11.
European students turned after
ithe war to the task of helping
the homeless and starving, and
| to the job of rebuilding their
i shattered student world.
MANY OF THE new student'
I groups feared the growth of Com
j munism which was now dominat
ing many of the student unions
| of Eastern Europe.
The non-Communist Unions I
i felt that the student movement
icould only be hurt by tying it-;
self so closely to a political ideol
ogy. The issue, they reasoned, is
not Communism versus Capital
ism, but the rights of students j
to study and act as their con
sciences direct the Communists j
I have been offenders against this
right as often as anyone else.
In response to the desire for
a mean 4 of resolving these ten
sions, and the need for an organ

ization to deal with the pressing
problems of student welfare, the
first World Student Congress met
in Prague in 1946.
AT THE TIME of the Prague
Congress, there was no national
union of students in the United
States. A delegation of twenty
five American students repre
senting six youth organizations
and ten colleges attended.
Unfortunately, a small, highly
organized group of Communists
dominated the organizing com
mittee right from the start.
To the U.S. students returning
from the first World Congress
it was clear that if the students
of the United States were to
have any voice in international
student affairs, if they were to
have any effect in the light
against Communist domination
of the ItJS (International Union
of Studentsi they would have to
| organize themselves into some
sort of national union.
A constitutional convention met
in Madison, Wisconsin, in Ihe
| summer of 1947 and formed the
I United States National Student
Association, commonly called
USNSA, or more frequently just
NSA.
NSA's basic committments
have led it into many fields, from
academic reform to student ser
vices. These are valuable and im
portanl things which every stu
dent on an NSA campus should
bo aware of and take advantage
of; they will be thoroughly dis
cussed in subsequent articles.
But the problem which brought
about the birth of NSA is still
the most serious problem it faces
, today. Nowhere is NSA's com
mittment to .student rights more
important than in the struggle
against the undemocratic Commu
nist domination of the lUS.
FOLLOWING 1947 it became
| increasingly clear that the lUS
was no more than an arm of So
viet foreign policy, and a very
effective arm at that. As the only
international student organiza
tion the lUS was in a position to
j greatly influence the student
j leaders of the emergent nations
1 of Asia and Africa.
To these future political lead
ers the lUS could offer recog
nition, aid, and most important.
I educational opportunities in Rus-
I sia and Eastern Europe. The stu
i dent leaders had no where else
to turn; the non-Communist
unions quickly realized that mere
I objection was not a satisfactory
! alternative.
In 1950 the International Stu
dent Conference (ISC) was
| formed. Not wanting the fate of
1 the lUS to befall the ISC, no per
manent, structured organization
! was adopted. Only the Coordinat
ing Secretariat (COSEC) acted
: to tide the organization over from
one annual conference to the
i next.
THE PROBLEM faced by the
i ISC in providing an alternative
to the lUS were tremendous, not
only did it lack the financial
backing of a great power like the
! Soviet Union, but its unstructured
formation made it difficult to or
ganize programs that could match
I those of the lUS in attracting
I student leaders. Despite these
difficulties the ISC has experi
enced amazing success.
NSA has since 1950 been one
Jof ISC's strongest supporters,
and sponsors a number of pro
grams designed to bring student
leaders, particularly from the un
der-developed countries into con
tact with something besides the
i Communist line offered by the
j lUS.
Early this year, at Christ
church New Zealand, the Inter
national Student Conference met
for the fourteenth time. After
much deliberation it decided to
establish itself as a permanent
! organization. In August its Char
ter was approved by the National
| Congress of USNSA at Minneo
polis, and as a result NSA will
become a member of a new. fully
grown ISC, capable of offering
the dynamic and creative leader
ship which the world student com
munity need and demands.
