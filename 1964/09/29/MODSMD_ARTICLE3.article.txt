• Senate I'asses I aeaney Amendment
WASHINGTON The senate approved yesterday a constitu
tional amendment which provides a method for tilling the oft ice of
vice president when a vacancy occurs, as is tlx' situation now.
The amendment also would establish a method lor handling in
stances of presidential disability.
The proposal now goes to the House where there is no chance
ol any action on it this session.
Sponsors of the amendment said, however, they hope the Senate
vote will give the plan a boost for favorable action next year by
both branches. Then, it would still require ratification by at least
three-fourths of the states to become effective.
The amendment provides that when the office of vice president
is vacant, "the president shall nominate a vice president who shall
take office upon confirmation by a majority of both houses of Con
gress."
On the question of disability, the amendment states that if a
president declares he is unable to discharge his duties, they shall be
turned over to the vice president.
If a disabled president refuses to step aside, the vice president
could take over by transmitting to Congress, with the concurrence
of a majority of the heads of executive departments or such other
body as Congress may designate, his written declaration that the
president is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.
