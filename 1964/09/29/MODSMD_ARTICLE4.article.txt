## Cal Students Protest Ruling 
### 
An administrative ruling which prevented stu
dent political groups from passing out campaign
literature, buttons, and bumper strips on the
Berkeley campus last week has been "reinter
preted" by University of California Chancellor
Edward Strong.
Political groups can now disseminate such in
formation, but only at nine campus locations desig
nated by the administration.
STll,l, I'KOIIIBITKD on campus by Strong's
ruling are:
• Solicitation oJ political party membership.
• Organization of political or social action on
campus. (Such as the the recent group of UC
students which picketed Goldwater campaign
chairman William Knowland's Oakland Tribune.
• Solicitation of funds on campus for such ac
tion.
• Kerrivin" funds for aiding projects which
are not directly concerned with authorized activi
ties of the University.
IN I'KKYIOI S VKAKS, ofl campus politicking
has been limited to a 26-foot strip of brick walk
way at the campus entrance on Bancroft Way and
Telegraph Avenue. But two weeks ago l : C I Van
of Students Kalherinc A. Towle announced that
only distribution <»t "informative" lilciaiiue, a-.

opposed to directly pcrsusive, would be permitted
in this area.
Thus a phamphlel staling reasons why a given
proposition is undesirable was permissible, but
a student could not distribute literature urging a
no vote on the ballot measure.
STUDENT CJROUPS, ranging from the Young
People's Socialists to the California Students for
CJoldwater, quickly banded together to oppose
the ruling. The ASUC student Senate voted 11-.~>
to request University Regents lo "allow free
political and social action at the Bancroft en
trance" and then amended the resolution to ask
identical privileges at eight other areas on cam
pus.
The Senate also began circulating a petition
around campus lo rally grass-roots support for
the measure.
Yesterday, representative's of Ihe various poli
tical groups picketed the University meeting at
which the new interpretation was agreed upon.
STILL AT issui-;. however, Is a speaker's plat
form in front of the University's Administration
Building. The latest riding permits impromptu
speaking in the "free speech" area but prohibits
the "advocae\ of off-eanipir political or social
act ion."

Political groups can now disseminate such in
formation, but only at nine campus locations desig
nated by the administration.
STll,l, I'KOIIIBITKD on campus by Strong's
ruling are:
• Solicitation oJ political party membership.
• Organization of political or social action on
campus. (Such as the the recent group of UC
students which picketed Goldwater campaign
chairman William Knowland's Oakland Tribune.
• Solicitation of funds on campus for such ac
tion.
• Kerrivin" funds for aiding projects which
are not directly concerned with authorized activi
ties of the University.
IN I'KKYIOI S VKAKS, ofl campus politicking
has been limited to a 26-foot strip of brick walk
way at the campus entrance on Bancroft Way and
Telegraph Avenue. But two weeks ago l : C I Van
of Students Kalherinc A. Towle announced that
only distribution <»t "informative" lilciaiiue, a-.

opposed to directly pcrsusive, would be permitted
in this area.
Thus a phamphlel staling reasons why a given
proposition is undesirable was permissible, but
a student could not distribute literature urging a
no vote on the ballot measure.
STUDENT CJROUPS, ranging from the Young
People's Socialists to the California Students for
CJoldwater, quickly banded together to oppose
the ruling. The ASUC student Senate voted 11-.~>
to request University Regents lo "allow free
political and social action at the Bancroft en
trance" and then amended the resolution to ask
identical privileges at eight other areas on cam
pus.
The Senate also began circulating a petition
around campus lo rally grass-roots support for
the measure.
Yesterday, representative's of Ihe various poli
tical groups picketed the University meeting at
which the new interpretation was agreed upon.
STILL AT issui-;. however, Is a speaker's plat
form in front of the University's Administration
Building. The latest riding permits impromptu
speaking in the "free speech" area but prohibits
the "advocae\ of off-eanipir political or social
act ion."
