REINCARNATION -Temporary building C, pre
viously home of the Geography Department, is
being reconstructed near Placerville as an en
gine house for the narrow-gauge steam loco
motives of the Camino, Cable and Northern
Railroad. The work has been carried out by
Alan Wilrnunder of the Linear Accelerator and
Robert Keller of the Mechanical Engineering De-

partment. The railroad is intended to provide
a means of preserving historical railway equip
ment; it is hoped that the project will be self
supporting as a tourist attraction. Railroad offi
cials insist that the new building is temporary
and will be removed as soon as practicable—
probably within five or six decades.
