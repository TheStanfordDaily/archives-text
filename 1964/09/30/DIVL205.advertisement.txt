HOW MUCH ARE YOU WORTH?
l luw iiinch an- you worth? A man's worth is not primarily a matter ol .scholar
ship, it is essentially a matter ol relationship—relationship to )esus Christ. It is,
ol course, perfectk possible jihl perfectly legitimate to have both, and this is in
lu commcnilcil but we should always remind ourselves that
"... the foolishness ol God is wiser than men. and the weakness ol God is
stronger than men . . . Ciod has chosen the foolish tilings of the world in order
to shame what is strong; and the mean and despised things ol the world —things
that are nothing—God has chosen in order to bring to nothing the things thai
are; to prevent anv mortal man from boasting before (iod." (1 Corinthians
1:2=5-2")
How much are you worth? There was a time when Paul the Apostle, as Saul
of Tarsus, hated Christ and persecuted the Church, anil he had done so because
he still regarded Christ I'rotn a purely human point ol view—in terms ol natural
standards of value ...
To Saul, according to the facts as he knew them . . . Jesus Christ was an out
cast. Socially how much was I Ie worth? Nothing!
Born of peasant stock, 1 lis schooling was negligible, sufficing only to equip
Him for the humble duties ol a common draftsman. I'roiessionally, how much
was lie worth? Nothing!
A fanatical street preacher and rabble rouser. He was totally repudiated In
all the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the day, and having had no theological training
whatever, was looked upon with supreme contempt by all that called its» 11 scholar
ship among those who searched the Scriptures, hcclcsiastically, theologically, and
intellectually how much was lie worth? Nothing!
His financial standing was such that He even had to borrow a coin tor one
of His far-fetched illustrations! He was an incorrigible scrounger by all the "nat
ural standards of value," for He had no home of His own. Horn in a borrowed
stable, He lived and dined in borrowed homes; He rode upon a borrowed donkey,
was crucified on a borrowed cross and buried in a borrowed tomb! He was bank
rupt from the start! Financially, how much was He worth? Nothing!
Something happened, however, which changed Saul and Tarsus completely;
the old standards of value went by the board, and everything assumed an entirely
new perspective. The values themselves had not changed. It was dimply that in
a dazzling encounter on the road to Damascus (Acts '*). Saul ol Tarsus saw "the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ'' . . . Saul ol Tarsus suddenly discovered
that a man is worth only as much as can lie seen of God in him: and that he
was in the presence of the Man in whom (to use his own description) "... the
fullness of Deity continues to dwell in bodily lorin—giving complete expression
of the divine nature." (Colossi,ins 2: l >)

HOW MUCH ARE YOU WORTH?
l luw iiinch an- you worth? A man's worth is not primarily a matter ol .scholar
ship, it is essentially a matter ol relationship—relationship to )esus Christ. It is,
ol course, perfectk possible jihl perfectly legitimate to have both, and this is in
lu commcnilcil but we should always remind ourselves that
"... the foolishness ol God is wiser than men. and the weakness ol God is
stronger than men . . . Ciod has chosen the foolish tilings of the world in order
to shame what is strong; and the mean and despised things ol the world —things
that are nothing—God has chosen in order to bring to nothing the things thai
are; to prevent anv mortal man from boasting before (iod." (1 Corinthians
1:2=5-2")
How much are you worth? There was a time when Paul the Apostle, as Saul
of Tarsus, hated Christ and persecuted the Church, anil he had done so because
he still regarded Christ I'rotn a purely human point ol view—in terms ol natural
standards of value ...
To Saul, according to the facts as he knew them . . . Jesus Christ was an out
cast. Socially how much was I Ie worth? Nothing!
Born of peasant stock, 1 lis schooling was negligible, sufficing only to equip
Him for the humble duties ol a common draftsman. I'roiessionally, how much
was lie worth? Nothing!
A fanatical street preacher and rabble rouser. He was totally repudiated In
all the ecclesiastical dignitaries of the day, and having had no theological training
whatever, was looked upon with supreme contempt by all that called its» 11 scholar
ship among those who searched the Scriptures, hcclcsiastically, theologically, and
intellectually how much was lie worth? Nothing!
His financial standing was such that He even had to borrow a coin tor one
of His far-fetched illustrations! He was an incorrigible scrounger by all the "nat
ural standards of value," for He had no home of His own. Horn in a borrowed
stable, He lived and dined in borrowed homes; He rode upon a borrowed donkey,
was crucified on a borrowed cross and buried in a borrowed tomb! He was bank
rupt from the start! Financially, how much was He worth? Nothing!
