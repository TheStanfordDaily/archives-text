his Democratic opponent is "soft on commu

Speaking at Marietta, Athens, Chillicothe
and Blanchester to crowds which police said

• China ISears Nuclear Power
WASHINGTON — Communist China may
explode its first nuclear test bomb in the near
future, Secretary of State Dean Rusk said yes
terday.
"If it does occur, we shall know about it
and will make the information public," Rusk
declared in a statement.
While cautiously worded, his statement was
one of the strongest made recently on the pos
sibility that Red China may be on the verge
of becoming the fifth power in the "nuclear

club." The United States, Britain, Soviet Union
and France are the nuclear powers, France
being the newest developer of atomic weapons.

• GOV—White Mai is Party?
LOS ANGELES — The Republican Party
faces the danger of becojning a "white man's
party," the executive secretary of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People said yesterday.
"There is a definite effort ... in some
areas" of the GOP to exclude Negroes, Roy
Wilkins told a news conference.
The Negro leader did not name leaders of

such a move but cited the recent party switch
of South Carolina Senator Strom — from
Democrat to Republican — as "more evidence
that segregationists feel more comfortable in
the Republican Party."
Of Proposition 14, the NAACP leader said
it "represents a backward step to people all
over the country and is diametrically opposed
to national policy."
• CM Strike To Continue
DETROlT—Negotiators for General Motors

in a nationwide strike that has halted produc

Both sides agree the major stumbling block
to getting an estimated total of 260,000 work
ers back on the assembly lines is the resolving
of more than 17,000 local plant demands.
These cover such issues as parking lots,
uniforms and plant grievance procedure.

• GOV—White Mai is Party?
LOS ANGELES — The Republican Party
faces the danger of becojning a "white man's
party," the executive secretary of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored
People said yesterday.
"There is a definite effort ... in some
areas" of the GOP to exclude Negroes, Roy
Wilkins told a news conference.
The Negro leader did not name leaders of

such a move but cited the recent party switch
of South Carolina Senator Strom — from
Democrat to Republican — as "more evidence
that segregationists feel more comfortable in
the Republican Party."
Of Proposition 14, the NAACP leader said
it "represents a backward step to people all
over the country and is diametrically opposed
to national policy."

Both sides agree the major stumbling block
to getting an estimated total of 260,000 work
ers back on the assembly lines is the resolving
of more than 17,000 local plant demands.
These cover such issues as parking lots,

In his first formal assault of this nature,
