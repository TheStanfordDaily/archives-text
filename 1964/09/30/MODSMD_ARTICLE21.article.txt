# ORANGE COUNTY
## Ike, Demos And Commies Threaten 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Orange C'oiinly Correspondent
Northern California and par
ticularly the Stanford community
were surprised by Barry Gold
water's primary victory last June
2. The victory, of course,
was due mainly lo Orange
County's strong support for Gold
water. There are substantial rea
sons for this support.
The Communist Menace in
Orange County is the greatest

i fear of most of the dedicated pa
triots living within the county's
boundaries. It is even more feared
than the United Nations, former
President Eisenhower, or the
Democratic Party.
I have talked with some of the
loyal Americans who live near
us. In fact, one night I was in
vited to a large party held over
in Newport Beach at the Balboa
Bay Club. The people there kept
mentioning something about some

society and welcoming me into it.
I didn't fully understand what it
was all about.
Re<l Infiltration
But this much I did understand.
In Orange County the Commu
nists have infiltrated the PTA,
the YR's, and the SPCA. Our li
braries are filled with left-wing
literature. Wild-eyed moderates
tried to infiltrate the Republican
Party, but were overcome. Our
school systems are loaded to ca
pacity with liberal apologists.
While I was at the party I was
approached by a man collecting
for the Special Fund to send
Police Dogs to Mississippi. For
a five dollar contribution I get:
a peachy banner that I can attach
to the front of my house. It says
"Don't Buy Peace With Freedom."
The day after the party, I de
cided to test the claims I had
heard the night before. I went to
the airport, climbed into my Piper
Cub, and took off. I could not be
lieve my eyes. It was incredible.
Communist MlG's actually were
flying over Orange County. I shot
down 19 of them and returned
home.
Later I found that ihe Com
mies were also flying aerial recon
naisanee planes over the county
in order to get pictures of Disney
land to pacify Khrushchev.
Roadblock
The other day I was stopped at
a roadblock on highway 101. At
first I did not understand why I
was being stopped because there
were no police cars in the area.
A man in a uniform approached.
His badge said "California Min
uteman, Badge No. 54." The in
scription on the fly of his trou
sers read, "Get the US Out of
the UN." "Impeach Earl Warren"
was tattoed on his arm.
He put an American flag on the
aerial of my car and pasted sev
eral bumper stickers to my car.
One of them was "Don't Worry,
They're Still Ninety Miles Away."
"Who's still ninety miles
away?" I asked.
"The San Francisco liberals," he
answered as he motioned me to
drive on.
I told one of the local patriots
that I "attended" Stanford for two
years. I never claimed to have
been a Stanford student. He took
me into his confidence and asked
me to fill out a detailed report on
all of the communists I had met at
the Farm.
He seemed shocked when I told
him I had never met a commu
nist, either at Stanford or any
where else.
"If you're any kind of devoted
patriot," he said, "you must have
a list of names of known commu
nsts, Any loyal American must
do at least that much for hi s
country."
"Yes," I said, as I wrote his
name at the top of the list, "Any
loyal American must, do at least
that much for his country."
