## Goals Of NSA Programs: Education, Involvement 
### RICHARD T. WILLIAMS Stanford NSA Coordinator 
Editor's Note: This is the third
in a series of articles on the Na
tional Student Association. Fur
ther articles will review the asso
ciation's international problems
land analyze the recent National
j Student Congress.

It is disconcerting to be the
coordinator of an organization
whose members don't realize it
exists. A poll of 100 Stanford stu
dents yesterday revealed only
| one knew of any campus pro
grams sponsored by the National
IStudent Association (but she, like
'the other 99, didn't know what
'NSA is).
It was not until this summer's
National Student Congress that
| the Association completed its re
vision of its emphasis on politics
| to include a greater emphasis on
(education and individual involve
ment in social welfare programs.
This change should be wel
comed by many of NSA's critics
whose ideological bents were not
[that of the Association.
| Translating this new emphasis
i into actual programs forced the
Association to define its interests
in three fields: concern for the
individual student, concern for
his student body and campus, and
concern for his community.
Of interest to the individual stu-
{ dent at Stanford will be the stu
ident discount program. With a
single identification card, s t u
| dents are now eligible for price
reductions in many hotels, restau
rants, theaters and shops across
the country including the Hil
| ton chain. In our immediate area,
very little work on securing dis
counts has been done, and this
' is one area Stanford NSA is quite
! interested in going into.
This year the Association recog-
Inized the need of students for
low-cost life insurance, to protect
| their families, to provide a cash
! reserve, and to safeguard their
! parents' educational investment,
i For the first time, a very eom
jpetitive student policy is being
offered to students at lower rates
I than are available anywhere else
in the nation.
Background papers on world
icrises are being prepared and
, printed, with four new booklets
coming out each year. These
papers, usually 100 pages or more
<>1 carefully researched and finely
j edited material describe the back
ground and implications of our
! global powder-kegs. Copies are
| available without charge from
i the Stanford coordinator.
! Future plans include the initia
j tion of a state government in
: ternship program for Stanford
students to offer them the oppor
tunity to study politics in action
! and to comprehend the com
plexities of state government. Al
j ready foundations and legislators
I have been approached about such
| a summer program with enthusi
astic results.
| To help your student govern
ment, NSA publishes monthly
1 bulletins and magazines and sends
; out mailings bi-weekly. The cam
pus coordinator maintains a
| lending library of these materials
jfor the use of Stanford organiza
tions and LASSU. For questions
I not answered in its mailings,
i NSA provides a Student Govern
jment Information Service al its
j national offices in Philadelphia
to help local groups with organ
izational and programming proh
! lems. Last year, SGIS replied to
well over 1,000 inquiries, and t his
year, NSA hopes the number will
j be even greater.
The coming year's biggest ac
tivities will be those helping the
j whole university community and
| the surrounding suburban area.
The University will be beneficiary
' for the NSA "crisis-center" proj

ect, and the culturally-deprived
students of East Palo Alto will
be helped by an expanded tutorial
j program and a cultural acclima
tion activity.
The "crisis center" will attempt
to provide analyzsis of major
national and international events
within ten days after they hap
pen. Working papers, bibliogra
phies, news-clipping files, coffee
hour seminars, and all-campus
discussions will be the tools by
which the center hopes to dis
seminate non-partisan political
information, as well as socio
economic analy/.sis of issues and
hotspots of our time.
In cooperation with the Stan
ford Department of Education,
the Palo Alto School Board, San
Francisco CORE, NSA at Stanford
hopes to expand the Stanford
Tutors program to include more
j than 200 students helping chil
i dren with remedial reading, arith
j metic, social science, language,
Land natural science tutoring. The
; program would involve only three
hours per week for a tutor, and
before he even meets his student,
I Stanford NSA and the Tutors
programs will train and prepare
. him for greater effectiveness.
The other large program being
instituted litis year is a Western
| edition of New York City's
| "Higher Horizons" program, de
signed to help slum children lift
! their perspectives on the future.
Operating on one-volunteer-per
-1 six-students pattern, the program
I will send groups of students to
the symphony, the zoo, aircraft
plants, the university, farms,
the beach, department stores, and
many other places that have very
little meaning for a slum child.
In New York, in Louisville, even
in suburban Chicago, such a proj
ect has had fantastic results in
helping children in their studies
and personal development.
To organize these programs,
Stanford manpower is desperately
needed. For those interested in
' these programs or desiring to
learn more about them, the NSA
desk is in front of the ASSIJ
I President's office in the ASSU
offices and is open daily from
13:30-5:30 p.m.
