"A librarian should acquire and
shelve materials for positive
rather than negative reasons,"
declared Rutherford D. Rogers,

! newly appointed director of the
Stanford University Libraries in
a recent interview.
Continuing his feelings on the
i censorship of books Rogers stated
that a book should be put out to
! the public either because it is a
well written piece of scholarship
! or because it is so intrinsically
| bad, such as Soviet propoganda,
that it sheds a light on the so
ciety.
Rogers, who, as chairman of the
j American Library Association's
Committee on Intellectual Free
! dom for ten years developed a
reputation as an opponent of out-
I right censorship said that a com
munity should choose a librarian
|and then have confidence in his
[ability to select books for public
! offering.
A OKAIH'ATK of the State
College of lowa and Columbia
University, Rogers served as
deputy librarian of Congress for
seven years before accepting the
post at Stanford.
Commenting on the numerous
volumes in that renowned library
he remarked that though it re
ceives two copies of every book
copy-written in the United States
it does not necessarily keep all of
; them. "Certain classes of books,
! such as poetry and comic books,
; require only a representative
i sample," Rogers elaborated.
I As author of I he article, "Yes,

| Ivan reads," Rogers feels that
in some aspects the Soviet educa
tional system is extremely im
pressive. "The number of people
in the U.S.S.R. who can speak
foreign languages and the degree
; of skill among these people, many
of whom have never left the So
viet Union, is tremendous,'' the
i director commented.
IN* COMPARING the Soviet
system to American education, lie
I stated, "Our stress on complete
J individual freedom to pursue any
[subject objectively, distinguishes
our system from that of the So
| viets."
He continued that, while do
; mestic libraries are open 1o every
one regardless of the subject pur
sued. in Russia there are sections
of libraries where one must have
a special card to enter a single
i room,
i Director .Rogers feels that the
trend in American library archi
tecture is moving toward a more
! complete study facility. "Librar
ies are recognizing the need for a
combination of both group discus
sion and individual study facili
ties under the same roof." he said.
Rogers further said that the
new undergraduate library on
the Stanford campus would incor
porate these new trends in archi
tecture through the use of group
study areas as well as sections
1 for imlivif|ii;il silent siudy.
