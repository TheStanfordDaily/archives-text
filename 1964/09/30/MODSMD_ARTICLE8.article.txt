# Study Group Advises Using Fewer TA's
## Grades Should Follow Curve 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE Feature Editor 
| A comprehensive report on the
I Freshman Year at Stanford just
l released by the Committee on
General Studies contains a strong
I recommendation for extensive
: revision of the Teaching Assistant
program in freshman and General
Studies' courses.
The Committee has concluded
I that no more than two-thirds of
' the teaching load in any freshman
class be carried by Teaching As
i sistants.
The Committee further urged
that only advanced Ph.D. students
I be appointed as Teaching Assist
ants and that preference be given
jto those students having prior
teaching experience.
Effective this year, all appoint
jments to Teaching Assistance
ships in freshman courses must
l>e submitted to the Dean of Hu
manities and Sciences for review.
Other recommendations made
iii the fifty-six page report in-
I eluded:
• Each department should esta
blish a graduate course in teach
ing methods and require all
Teaching Assistants to complete
it before asuming their teaching
! duties.
• Common examinations should
be used in all freshmen courses
I with attention to variations in the
quality of teaching as measured
I by performance on such examina
| tions.
• Grading in all freshman
] courses should follow the sug
gested distribution as closely as
possible, and should in no case fall
below the "curve."
The study on which these rec
tommendations are based was con
ducted at the request of the Com
mittee on University Policy and
was begun in December 1960. The
eight-man General Studies com
mittee. headed by Prof. Robert
A. Walker, studied the results of
numerous surveys and question
naires administered to incoming
freshman classes, starting with
the class of 1965, in compiling this
report. They considered not only
eurricular problems but freshman
i attitudes and administrative prob
-1 lems as well.
The Committee found that the
"great majority" of the freshmen
! were very satisfied with Stanford.
: Fewer than one-sixth of the stu
dents questioned reported they
' had entert a in ed "serious
thoughts" of transferring to an
other school.
Students were not so happy
with the "ratio" which is now
officially 70-30 boys over girls
j however. Less than one-quarter
I of the boys questioned felt their
social life had been "very satisfac
tory," although almost 40 per cent
of them felt the "opportunities"
for dating were excellent or very
good. i\ot surprisingly, more than
three-fifths of the freshmen girls
reported both "excellent" or "very
j good" opportunities and "very
satisfactory" or "satisfactory"
I dating life.
In view of these figures 1 h e
Committee recommended "im
mediate consideration" should be
! given to "realistic possibilities"
for improving the social atmos
phere.
It also noted that additional pro
grams should be undertaken to
increase cultural opportunities
for freshmen, both at Stanford
and in the Bay Area.
Turning to academics the report
recommended that the principle
of admitting exceptionally tal
lented students whose overall rec
ords might not otherwise justify
admission should be considered
for possible application in subject
areas other than the performing
land creative arts.
