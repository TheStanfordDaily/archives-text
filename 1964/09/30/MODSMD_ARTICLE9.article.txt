# McAfee Brown Charges Proposition 14 Immoral
## 
### ANN SATTLER 
The controversial Proposition 14 is immoral, Dr. Robert Mc-
Afee Broun told a standing-room-only student audience in Tres
siddcr Memorial Union last night.
Dr. Brown, an eminent figure in the field of religion, presented
the his ton' of the movement and briefly summarized arguments

i for and against the proposition.
He concluded with his belief that
! tho California Real Estate Asso
ciation's measure "legalizes into
[constitutionality hatred for mi
i nority groups."
While prejudices have been
thawing in most parts of the
i country, we will have "frozen"
| existing prejudices in California
j into permanency. Brown said.
lIK 10xritl<;ssi;i) fear that Cali
i fornia could be the spark which
lights racist bonfires all over the
| country if the voters approve the
proposal in November.
The Stanford professor, who
! was recently jailed for his civil
| rights efforts, warned thai the
CREA conceives of freedom solely
in individual terms.
"It would give some the free
dom to sell, but deny others the
j freedom to acquire property," he
| pointed out. The California state
I constitution assures all citizens
j the right to acquire property,
i Stressing his point that the
question should be regarded as a

moral issue, he pointed to the
destruction of human dignity en
tailed in the passage of the meas
ure. The human dignity of the
protagonists as well as that of
the victims of such a proposal is
at stake, he said.
It promotes the belief that prop
erty rights are more important
than human rights. In view of the
fundamental moral significance
of the matter, a bi-partisan effort
to fight proposition 14 was sug
gested. He pointed to the joint ef
forts of diverse religious groups
which have already banded In
together in opposition to its pas
sage.
The lecture was sponsored by
the "Mid-Peninsula Citizens
Against Propostion 1 1" and "Stan
ford Students for Fair Housing"

AGAINST PROPOSITION 14 -Robert McAfee Brown, religion profes
sor, spoke out against Proposition 14 at 7:30 last evening in the
large lounge of Tresidder Memorial Union. An overflow crowd at
tended the speech.
The controversial Proposition 14 is immoral, Dr. Robert Mc-
Afee Broun told a standing-room-only student audience in Tres
siddcr Memorial Union last night.
Dr. Brown, an eminent figure in the field of religion, presented
the his ton' of the movement and briefly summarized arguments

i for and against the proposition.
He concluded with his belief that
! tho California Real Estate Asso
ciation's measure "legalizes into
[constitutionality hatred for mi
i nority groups."
While prejudices have been
thawing in most parts of the
i country, we will have "frozen"
| existing prejudices in California
j into permanency. Brown said.
lIK 10xritl<;ssi;i) fear that Cali
i fornia could be the spark which
lights racist bonfires all over the
| country if the voters approve the
proposal in November.
The Stanford professor, who
! was recently jailed for his civil
| rights efforts, warned thai the
CREA conceives of freedom solely
in individual terms.
"It would give some the free
dom to sell, but deny others the
j freedom to acquire property," he
| pointed out. The California state
I constitution assures all citizens
j the right to acquire property,
i Stressing his point that the
question should be regarded as a

moral issue, he pointed to the
destruction of human dignity en
tailed in the passage of the meas
ure. The human dignity of the
protagonists as well as that of
the victims of such a proposal is
at stake, he said.
It promotes the belief that prop
erty rights are more important
than human rights. In view of the
fundamental moral significance
of the matter, a bi-partisan effort
to fight proposition 14 was sug
gested. He pointed to the joint ef
forts of diverse religious groups
which have already banded In
together in opposition to its pas
sage.
The lecture was sponsored by
the "Mid-Peninsula Citizens
Against Propostion 1 1" and "Stan
ford Students for Fair Housing"
groups.
