# Frosh Take Studies, Social Problems In Stride
## 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE Feature Editor 
More than one-half of this year's entering
freshman class will receive grades which are
lower than they expected.
In fact, more than one-half of the fresh
man classes for the last several years received
lower grades than they expected.
s<). VVIIILi: the average freshman girl in
1963 came from high school with a grade
point average of 3.57, and the average fresh
man boy had a 3.76, the chances are very good
i hat these same students, now average sopho
mores, open their registration packets to
discover that along with 69 per cent of their
classmates they have CPA's below 3.0.
These rather dismal statistics, similar to
those made by every freshman class, should
certainly be enough to undermine the morale
of the poor freshman.
This at least was the feeling of the Com
mittee on University Policy al their meeting
on December 1, 19(50. Out of this meeting came
the impetus for an extensive study of the

freshman year at Stanford conducted by the
Committee on General Studies.
JUST RELEASED in the form of a fifty
six page booklet, this report is perhaps the
most exhaustive collection of information ever
compiled about Stanford freshmen.
A very sizable section of the study is de
voted to student attitude, morale, adjustment
to the Stanford environment and social life,
and other related topics.
This section is based on questionnaires
completed by nearly half of the Class of 1964.
THE COMMITTEE attempted to get an
indication of each student's morale by the
response to three key questions concerning
transfer to another university, homesickness,
and graduate study plans.
In general the committee found that the
morale of the students was very good, in
spite of the fact that more than three-fifths of
them worried at least "quite a bit" about their
grades.
In fact, social and dating difficulties ap
peared to influence morale much more than

academic problems. More than 60 per cent of
the students who reported unsatisfactory so
cial life were also considering leaving Stan
ford.
Not surprisingly, social problems touched
far fewer girls than boys. Less than 12 per
cent of the girls questioned were dissatisfied
with their dating life as opposed to some -19
per cent of the boys.
TAKING NOTE of these figures, the Com
mittee included a strong recommendation
that immediate consideration should be given
to improving the social atmosphere at Stan
ford, and suggested the possibility of further
implementing coed dining and residential ar
rangements.
The Committee attempted to assess the
effect of the intellectual environment on the
incoming student as well, and found that
while the opportunities for intellectual con
tact out of the classroom are many, student
participation is disappointing.
Fewer than one-third of those questioned
had talked with "at least one" of their in

structors outside of class as often as once a
month although 93 per cent felt it was easy
to do so; and only two-fifths of the students
reported meaningful conversations with the
faculty associates at their dorms in the same
period.
STUDENTS apparently do discuss impor
tant issues among themselves, however, as
more than 8(3 per cent reported a "fair
amount," or more, of intellectual discussion
among students outside of class.
Strangely enough this discussion seemed
to have a detrimental effect on scholastic per
formance as those students with low grades
reported more discussion of this nature than
those with higher grades. Girls living with
two roommates also reported more discus
sion than students living with only one room
mate or alone.
In fact, the Committee found that two
roommates seemed generally to have a bene
ficial effect on students.
NOT ONLY was morale bettor, but grades
were markedly higher among students living

with two roommates. These students were
also the most enthusiastic about dormitory
life in general.
Students were very critical of the General
Studies Program Advisors with only five per
cent believing these advisors to ho of "con
siderable value" to their intellectual develop
ment. Much higher ratings were accorded
student sponsors, however, as freshmen
ranked them second only to classmates as
sources of intellectual stimulation.
THE FRKSHMEN's overall opinion of the
University seemed quite high, nevertheless.
More than four-fifths of tiie respondants rated
Stanford in the top two places on a five point
scale running from excellent to poor.
In addition to sampling freshmen attitudes
and reactions, the Committee launched a do
tailed study of the five major freshman
course areas — English, History of Western
Civilization, foreign languages, mathematics,
and sciences.
The results of this study will bo the sub
ject of the second story in this series.

s<). VVIIILi: the average freshman girl in
1963 came from high school with a grade
point average of 3.57, and the average fresh
man boy had a 3.76, the chances are very good
i hat these same students, now average sopho
mores, open their registration packets to
discover that along with 69 per cent of their
classmates they have CPA's below 3.0.
These rather dismal statistics, similar to
those made by every freshman class, should
certainly be enough to undermine the morale
of the poor freshman.
This at least was the feeling of the Com
mittee on University Policy al their meeting
on December 1, 19(50. Out of this meeting came
the impetus for an extensive study of the

freshman year at Stanford conducted by the
Committee on General Studies.
JUST RELEASED in the form of a fifty
six page booklet, this report is perhaps the
most exhaustive collection of information ever
compiled about Stanford freshmen.
A very sizable section of the study is de
voted to student attitude, morale, adjustment
to the Stanford environment and social life,
and other related topics.
This section is based on questionnaires
completed by nearly half of the Class of 1964.
THE COMMITTEE attempted to get an
indication of each student's morale by the
response to three key questions concerning
transfer to another university, homesickness,
and graduate study plans.
In general the committee found that the
morale of the students was very good, in
spite of the fact that more than three-fifths of
them worried at least "quite a bit" about their
grades.
In fact, social and dating difficulties ap
peared to influence morale much more than

academic problems. More than 60 per cent of
the students who reported unsatisfactory so
cial life were also considering leaving Stan
ford.
Not surprisingly, social problems touched
far fewer girls than boys. Less than 12 per
cent of the girls questioned were dissatisfied
with their dating life as opposed to some -19
per cent of the boys.
TAKING NOTE of these figures, the Com
mittee included a strong recommendation
that immediate consideration should be given
to improving the social atmosphere at Stan
ford, and suggested the possibility of further
implementing coed dining and residential ar
rangements.
The Committee attempted to assess the
effect of the intellectual environment on the
incoming student as well, and found that
while the opportunities for intellectual con
tact out of the classroom are many, student
participation is disappointing.
Fewer than one-third of those questioned
had talked with "at least one" of their in

structors outside of class as often as once a
month although 93 per cent felt it was easy
to do so; and only two-fifths of the students
reported meaningful conversations with the
faculty associates at their dorms in the same
period.
STUDENTS apparently do discuss impor
tant issues among themselves, however, as
more than 8(3 per cent reported a "fair
amount," or more, of intellectual discussion
among students outside of class.
Strangely enough this discussion seemed
to have a detrimental effect on scholastic per
formance as those students with low grades
reported more discussion of this nature than
those with higher grades. Girls living with
two roommates also reported more discus
sion than students living with only one room
mate or alone.
In fact, the Committee found that two
roommates seemed generally to have a bene
ficial effect on students.
NOT ONLY was morale bettor, but grades
were markedly higher among students living

with two roommates. These students were
also the most enthusiastic about dormitory
life in general.
Students were very critical of the General
Studies Program Advisors with only five per
cent believing these advisors to ho of "con
siderable value" to their intellectual develop
ment. Much higher ratings were accorded
student sponsors, however, as freshmen
ranked them second only to classmates as
sources of intellectual stimulation.
THE FRKSHMEN's overall opinion of the
University seemed quite high, nevertheless.
More than four-fifths of tiie respondants rated
Stanford in the top two places on a five point
scale running from excellent to poor.
In addition to sampling freshmen attitudes
and reactions, the Committee launched a do
tailed study of the five major freshman
course areas — English, History of Western
Civilization, foreign languages, mathematics,
and sciences.
The results of this study will bo the sub
ject of the second story in this series.
More than one-half of this year's entering
freshman class will receive grades which are
lower than they expected.

mores, open their registration packets to
discover that along with 69 per cent of their
classmates they have CPA's below 3.0.
These rather dismal statistics, similar to
those made by every freshman class, should
certainly be enough to undermine the morale
of the poor freshman.
This at least was the feeling of the Com
mittee on University Policy al their meeting
on December 1, 19(50. Out of this meeting came
the impetus for an extensive study of the

freshman year at Stanford conducted by the
Committee on General Studies.
JUST RELEASED in the form of a fifty
six page booklet, this report is perhaps the
most exhaustive collection of information ever
compiled about Stanford freshmen.
A very sizable section of the study is de
voted to student attitude, morale, adjustment
to the Stanford environment and social life,
and other related topics.
This section is based on questionnaires
completed by nearly half of the Class of 1964.
THE COMMITTEE attempted to get an
indication of each student's morale by the
response to three key questions concerning
transfer to another university, homesickness,
and graduate study plans.
In general the committee found that the
morale of the students was very good, in
spite of the fact that more than three-fifths of
them worried at least "quite a bit" about their
grades.
In fact, social and dating difficulties ap
peared to influence morale much more than

academic problems. More than 60 per cent of
the students who reported unsatisfactory so
cial life were also considering leaving Stan
ford.
Not surprisingly, social problems touched
far fewer girls than boys. Less than 12 per
cent of the girls questioned were dissatisfied
with their dating life as opposed to some -19
per cent of the boys.
TAKING NOTE of these figures, the Com
mittee included a strong recommendation
that immediate consideration should be given
to improving the social atmosphere at Stan
ford, and suggested the possibility of further
implementing coed dining and residential ar
rangements.
The Committee attempted to assess the
effect of the intellectual environment on the
incoming student as well, and found that
while the opportunities for intellectual con
tact out of the classroom are many, student
participation is disappointing.
Fewer than one-third of those questioned
had talked with "at least one" of their in

structors outside of class as often as once a
month although 93 per cent felt it was easy
to do so; and only two-fifths of the students
reported meaningful conversations with the
faculty associates at their dorms in the same
period.
STUDENTS apparently do discuss impor
tant issues among themselves, however, as
more than 8(3 per cent reported a "fair
amount," or more, of intellectual discussion
among students outside of class.
Strangely enough this discussion seemed
to have a detrimental effect on scholastic per
formance as those students with low grades
reported more discussion of this nature than
those with higher grades. Girls living with
two roommates also reported more discus
sion than students living with only one room
mate or alone.
In fact, the Committee found that two
roommates seemed generally to have a bene
ficial effect on students.
NOT ONLY was morale bettor, but grades
were markedly higher among students living

with two roommates. These students were
also the most enthusiastic about dormitory
life in general.
Students were very critical of the General
Studies Program Advisors with only five per
cent believing these advisors to ho of "con
siderable value" to their intellectual develop
ment. Much higher ratings were accorded
student sponsors, however, as freshmen
ranked them second only to classmates as
sources of intellectual stimulation.
THE FRKSHMEN's overall opinion of the
University seemed quite high, nevertheless.
More than four-fifths of tiie respondants rated
Stanford in the top two places on a five point
scale running from excellent to poor.
In addition to sampling freshmen attitudes
and reactions, the Committee launched a do
tailed study of the five major freshman
course areas — English, History of Western
Civilization, foreign languages, mathematics,
and sciences.
The results of this study will bo the sub
ject of the second story in this series.
