THE CAMPAIGN
• Miller Scorns Johnson Trip
OMAHA President Johnson's "plan to go to Europe must be
branded as purely a political play," the Republican candidate for
vice president said last night.
"If ever a trip was talked about or leaked or semiofficially an
nounced strictly for its political impact, this is it," Rep. William E.
Miller of New York said in a statement issued during a campaign
visit here.
Miller commented on reports from Washington yesterday that
the President was hoping to meet in Europe late this year with
leaders and representatives of the 14 other North Atlantic Treaty
(. Organization countries.
Miller said, "The answer to this country's disintegrating alliances
is not a quick Lyndon Johnson political trip to Europe, and it is not
;i quick summit conference with Khrushchev in order to let him
know how accommodating he will be with the Communists."
• Humphrey Raps Harry's Tactics
DES MOINES Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey whipped through
the Midwest yesterday and charged that Barry Goldwater's soft-on
rommunism attack on President Johnson "was the last argument
ol a dying political man."
Referring to Goldwater's statement in Cincinnati on Tuesday
night, Humphrey said: "If the Republican candidate has had to
reach down into the bottom of the barrel to dig up that old, old
smelly argument, then all I can say is that he will die in the stench
ol his political argument."
Flying to Dcs Moines, Humphrey said in his prepared remarks,
"Sen. Goldwater's record on agriculture, by itself is enough reason
for any lowan, any Midwesterner, any American to vote against
him."
The nation's farmers, he said have the choice between President
Johnson "who has consistently and enthusiastically supported legis
lation to help the farmer and the man who has never in his Senate
career voted for a bill that would help the farmer."

CINCINNATI Drawings for possible two or three-team play
offs for the National League pennant race will be made at 2 p.m.

Referring to Goldwater's statement in Cincinnati on Tuesday
night, Humphrey said: "If the Republican candidate has had to
reach down into the bottom of the barrel to dig up that old, old
smelly argument, then all I can say is that he will die in the stench
ol his political argument."
Flying to Dcs Moines, Humphrey said in his prepared remarks,
"Sen. Goldwater's record on agriculture, by itself is enough reason
for any lowan, any Midwesterner, any American to vote against
him."
The nation's farmers, he said have the choice between President
Johnson "who has consistently and enthusiastically supported legis
lation to help the farmer and the man who has never in his Senate
career voted for a bill that would help the farmer."

OMAHA President Johnson's "plan to go to Europe must be
branded as purely a political play," the Republican candidate for

the President was hoping to meet in Europe late this year with
leaders and representatives of the 14 other North Atlantic Treaty

know how accommodating he will be with the Communists."
