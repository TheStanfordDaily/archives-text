# 'Organizer,' Mastroianni Convincing
## 
### WIN WINOGROND 
hi the world of the cinema one
of the most difficult tasks is re
creating a world strange to the
viewer without destroying his
belief, his participation, in the
scene unfolding before him.
Ours is a world of affluence, in
which workers are moving inex
orably toward the thirty-five hour
week, extensive fringe benefits
and (lie suburbs.
To us, the struggle of late nine
teenth century Italian workers
lo gain a thirteen hour day is
strange. Theirs is a world for
eign to us in time, place and
mood.
Italian Labor Movement
Vet somehow, Mario Monicelli's
film The Organizer brings the
birth pangs of the Italian labor
movement convincingly home.
As the camera moves through
Turin it penetrates tlie lives of
the impoverished mill-workers. It
shows young boys working from
(i a.m. to 8 p.m. It faithfully rec
ords the bleakness of industrial
life.
The long days make the work
ers careless. One fifth are
maimed, and the others are pain
fully aware of their similar fate.
They stage a walk-out, but it
collapses. At this point, a gentle
shabby professor enters the city
and succeeds in organizing their
efforts into a full-fledged strike.
A Familiar Plot
As their nascent sortie into soli
darity falters, he rallies them
time after time, until they are
brutally beaten by the manage
ment. The film closes on a note
of tragedy, and with a sense of
futility, but mixed with these is
the knowledge that hope has been
stirred.
The story is, of course, as old
as the labor movement itself;
anyone who has seen the Com
munist propaganda films of the
Thirties would recognize the plot
immediately. But Monicelli has a
different slant on the story. He
conveys the plight of the workers
without using brutal realism as
Kisenstein did in his Strike of the
1920'5.
( onvincing Characters
— And Mastroianni!
There is a wonderful kaleido
scope of characters in the film:
a gruff giant (Foleo Lulli), the
daughter of a mill worker turned
prostitute (Annie Giradot) and
the factory's young blade (Ren
ato Salvatore). They are all very
convincingly portrayed.
But the catalyst, the ever-pres
ent force in the picture is the pro
lessor (Marcello Mastroianni).
Mastroianni is one of the few in
ternational film stars who, like
Toshiro Mifune, Max Van Sydow
and Gunnar B.jornstrand happens
also to be a consummate actor.
He has proven himself time and
again in a startling variety of
roles in films such as La Dolce
Vita, H 1 >, and Divorce Italian
Style.
Here, he is a shuffling, nervous
professor constantly toying with
his glasses or nudging his nose.
At times he is almost Chaplines-j
que, yet he conveys the inner
spirit of a man devoted to an
idea.
The scene in which he exhorts
the workers to riot is a masterful
portrayal of a brilliant orator's
power over a crowd. Mastroianni
is on the screen perhaps two
thirds of the time, but his pres
ence is always felt.
Top Quality Directing
Monicelli's directing is nearly
flawless. The action never drops, i
The scenery and costumes are
remarkably convincing and the
camera flows easily from shack
to rooftop to the dimness of the
mill.
Much of the credit for the at- 1
mosphere of authenticity which
pervades the film must go to
Giuseppe Rotunno, the film edi
tor. His clever manipulation of
the grain of the film makes every
thing appear eighty years old.
The Organizer is a moving eve-1
ning's entertainment and should
not be missed by anyone inter
ested in good cinema.

fully aware of their similar fate.
They stage a walk-out, but it
collapses. At this point, a gentle
shabby professor enters the city
and succeeds in organizing their
efforts into a full-fledged strike.
A Familiar Plot
As their nascent sortie into soli
darity falters, he rallies them
time after time, until they are
brutally beaten by the manage
ment. The film closes on a note
of tragedy, and with a sense of
futility, but mixed with these is
the knowledge that hope has been
stirred.
The story is, of course, as old
as the labor movement itself;
anyone who has seen the Com
munist propaganda films of the
Thirties would recognize the plot
immediately. But Monicelli has a
different slant on the story. He
conveys the plight of the workers
without using brutal realism as
Kisenstein did in his Strike of the
1920'5.
( onvincing Characters
— And Mastroianni!
There is a wonderful kaleido
scope of characters in the film:
a gruff giant (Foleo Lulli), the
daughter of a mill worker turned
prostitute (Annie Giradot) and
the factory's young blade (Ren
ato Salvatore). They are all very
convincingly portrayed.
But the catalyst, the ever-pres
ent force in the picture is the pro
lessor (Marcello Mastroianni).
Mastroianni is one of the few in
ternational film stars who, like
Toshiro Mifune, Max Van Sydow
and Gunnar B.jornstrand happens
also to be a consummate actor.
He has proven himself time and
again in a startling variety of
roles in films such as La Dolce
Vita, H 1 >, and Divorce Italian
Style.
Here, he is a shuffling, nervous
professor constantly toying with
his glasses or nudging his nose.
At times he is almost Chaplines-j
que, yet he conveys the inner
spirit of a man devoted to an
idea.
The scene in which he exhorts
the workers to riot is a masterful
portrayal of a brilliant orator's
power over a crowd. Mastroianni
is on the screen perhaps two
thirds of the time, but his pres
ence is always felt.
Top Quality Directing
Monicelli's directing is nearly
flawless. The action never drops, i
The scenery and costumes are
remarkably convincing and the
camera flows easily from shack
to rooftop to the dimness of the
mill.
Much of the credit for the at- 1
mosphere of authenticity which
pervades the film must go to
Giuseppe Rotunno, the film edi
tor. His clever manipulation of
the grain of the film makes every
thing appear eighty years old.
The Organizer is a moving eve-1

not be missed by anyone inter
ested in good cinema.

film The Organizer brings the
birth pangs of the Italian labor
movement convincingly home.
