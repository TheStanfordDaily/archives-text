## Can LASSU Overcome Its N.Y. Mets Syndrome? 
### Justin Beck 
) A new year in student govern-1
i ment begins next week with the
first meeting of the Legislature!
| of the Associated Students of,
Stanford University. A new Presi
dent, Scott Mcßride, will give his
first address to the new, and
i hopefully somewhat improved
LASSU, starting a brand new po
• litical season.
The principal problems that
! Mcßride and the Legislature must
face is that student government
, suffers from what is known as
j the Now York Met syndrome.
ILASSU has been losing for so
; long that it has become a way of
; life, resulting in a genuine fear
j of that day when the Legislature
'must make an important decision
! all by itself. Up to now its been
| saying yes lo other people's deci-j
j sions.
Con Id Be LASSU's Year
But this might be LASSU's
I year. First, there is a feeling that
! Mcßride may nol be as dymanic
a leader as his predecessor, Bud
I Wedin, was. Mcßride is at this
i time still of unproven quality, and I
1 if he falters, the pressure of!
j leadership would fall upon the
Legislature. Second there is a!
growing realization of the poten-!
: tial power of the Legislature in
I student government. And third,
; Mcßride, like Wedin before him.
, is aware that student government
i cannot be successful if burdened
I by the dead weight of an impotent
legislature. If it fails again this
year, that failure may signal a
return to the cabinet type govern
: ment of past years.
The race for speaker is indica-
I tive of an increasing interest in
the legislative branch of govern-j
jment, as well as recognition of!
its power. Ed Shaw, last year's!
| extremely competent student fi
nancial manager, has indicated an
[interest in the office. He exper
ienced first hand the legislative!
| process in student government
here, and was quite disappointed 1

by it, (or to be a little more accu
rate, by the lack of any legislative
process. >
Andy Williams, a former assis
tant to Mcßride in political union,
and one of Mcßride's original sup
porters in last year's presidential
elections, is also regarded as a po
tential candidate, Williams is a
stranger to the legislature, but
showed considerable skill as a
campaign aide in Mcßride's suc
cessful election last year.
Dearth Of Legislators
However, a successful speaker
must have something to preside
over, and judging from last year's
collection of studeni legislators,
the chances of collecting under
one roof 120 people interested in
student government aren't too
great.
But student leaders see a larger
picture of their government,
believing that student govern
ment has a role in the "Stanford
Community." Bud Wedin, in his
final address last spring, did not
discuss the administrative func
tions of government, instead
stating, "... some have claimed
we have asked for more studeni
rights. Others, more conserva
tive, have claimed that we simply
are asking for the privilege to be
heard ... But in the last analy
sis we have really asked for some
thing more profound. We have
asked for a reworking of the con
cept of the University Commun
ity at Stanford."
Up to now, however, the legis
lature has shown little ability
even in. its role of supervising
student activities, and the thought
of LASSU asking for "a rework
ing of the concept of the Univer
sity Community," has to be taken
lightly. The concept of the Legis
lature has to be reworked first.
But this is a new year, with a
new student body President, a
new Speaker, and 1400 new stu
dents. Perhaps a new LASSU may
result.
