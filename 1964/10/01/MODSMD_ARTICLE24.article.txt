# Editor, The Daily
## News Critique Critiqued 
### 
Dear Sir:
Well, the editor ol' The Daily
fired the first salvo of the presi
dential campaign at Stanford on
Friday, but he did it in a distress
ingly devious and indirect way.
Under the guise of a disinter
ested guide to the available news
papers to which the untutored
incoming freshmen might sub
scribe, editor N'aylor informed
us that the San Francisco Ex
aminer (Hearst) is "liberally
biased," Newsweek is "liberal and
quite biased," The New York
Times' editorial page is "ex
tremely liberal," Time Magazine
is "moderately liberal on some
issues, but usually unbiased" (!>;
that the Chronicle is "quite lib
eral.'' the News-Call Bulletin is
"moderate," William Knowland's
Oakland Tribune is conservative
"but not to an objectionable de
gree," and so on.

These characterizations are so
patently silly that they deserve
our smiles rather than our anger.
The new editor owes his readers
some definitions. I assume he
means by "moderate" anyone
who's for Barry, while anyone
who harbors doubts about the
junior Senator from Arizona
must rank clearly as "liberal and
quite biased."
The more important point is
that, although one couldn't tell
it from the depressing and ugly
campaign now in progress na
tionally, there are significant
issues at stake in the coming
election. One would hope, as the
school year opens, that they
could be debated rationally at
Stanford and in its daily news
paper.
