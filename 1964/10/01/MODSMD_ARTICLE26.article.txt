# NSA Gives Information On Crises
## 
### CARL SCHMIDT NSA Regional Chairman 
The international relations and
programs of the National Student
Association are the responsibility
jof its oldest:, best organized, and
only entirely self-supporting
branch, the International Com-
I mission.
The Commission is also some
thing of which students on NSA
icampuses traditionally make very
j little use. Since these students
iare not only the beneficiaries of
NSA, but also in a sense its stock
holders, this should not and need
j not be. A brief survey of the ac
tivities of the International Com
mission during the past year
serves as a good cross-section of
! the type of international pro
. grams in which NSA is involved.
Foreign Affairs Information
1 On the homo front the Inter
national Commission undertakes
a number of programs designed
lo keep U.S. students abreast of
!he international situation, both
jas it affects students directly and
jin its relation to ttie rest of the
; world.
The POLBACK (Political Back
ground 1 papers have already been
■ discussed. They are comprehen
|sive reports distributed free to
j member schools and available to
I students through their campus
I NSA organization. Students on
'most campuses are totally un
j aware of this and other services
of NSA.
To a large extent this has been
I the fault of NSA, but it is cer
tainly also the result of a lack of
t attention and interest among
j I students.
( Copies of all POLBACK papers
are now available from the Stan
ford coordinator, Dick Williams,
jon a loan basis. So far 1 hey in
clude reports on Angola and >los-
J ambique, South and Southwest
Africa, Panama, and The Rise of
Latin American Left.
NSA Program Reports
1 Throughout the year the Inter
' national Commission also sends
out communiques describing its
own programs, and analyzing
•'crises as they arise. Last year
' tticse communiques included a
special report on the Panamanian
crisis which has now been ex
panded into a POLBACK paper,
' and a dispatch on the crisis sur
rounding the National Union of
South African Students (NUSASt
who had a number of their lead
ers seized and jailed, seemingly
without legal justification.
These are problems which af
fect students and should concern
students. Again our NSA campus
(organizations may be largely at
j fault, but students and student
newspapers have all too often
[adopted an apathetic attitude to
|ward student problems any fur
it her removed than liquor policy
■ and women's hours. (Incidentally,
I comprehensive materials are also
available on even these rather
'I parochial, but nonetheless im
-1 j portant, problems).
International Student Relations
The ISRS (pronounced "isris"
for International Student Rela-
I tions Seminar) is a better
known NSA program. Highly
qualified students from through
out the nation are selected to par
ticipate in this eight week inten
sive examination of foreign
affairs. This summer the Twelfth
1 ISRS was under the direction of
1 Stanford's Jim Haas, and among
jlhc fifteen top students chosen
] to participate were Rick Stearns
I and Sandy MacKenzie of Stan
j ford.
In its international relations,
' NSA has played a central role
in the establishment of the Inter
: national Stud en t Conference
(ISC) on a permanent basis. It
has also conducted extensive
j studies of the International Union
of Students (lUS>, the Commit
| nist controlled international stu
dent organization.
Olher Activities
In such a short space it is im
possible to even briefly describe
the numerous and varied activi
ties of the International Commis
! sion. Not only does it manage to
maintain contact with over 150
student unions and organizations
throughout the world, but it is
able to provide aid and assistance
to many foreign students through
scholarship and technical assist
ance programs.
The Foreign Student Leader
ship Project is currently under
going revision so as to provide
maximum benefits for the stu
j dent leaders it brings to NSA
campuses. NSA also maintains a
staff of overseas representatives.
Last year we had representatives
jin Ibadan, Nairobi, Beirut, Ox
-1 ford (Tom Grey, Stanford '63)
I and at the permanent office in
Paris.
This brief description is in no
way intended to be exhaustive of
the activities of NSA's Interna
tional Commission either in its
domestic or foreign aspects. The
Association has a lot to offer,
and its representatives will he
trying their best to involve the
'Stanford campus in some of the
I programs. But to be effective they
need your support, interest, and
' assistance
