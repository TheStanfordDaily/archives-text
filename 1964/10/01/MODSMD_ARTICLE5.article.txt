## Students Teach Abroad 
### BOB BJORING 
A group of 24 Stanford students, ranging from
freshmen to graduates, spent 1 heir summer work
ing for a World University Service pro,j eel, teach
ing English to refugee doctors, students, and
young children in Hong Kong and other areas
surrounding Communist China.
The members of the group, coordinated by
former Wilbur Hall Director Dvvight Clark, paid
their own transportation and expenses for the
WUS project, which lasted for nearly two months.
ALTHOUGH TEACHING English was the
main work of the group, a few of the students
helped in construction work as well. At the small
village of Rennie's Mill in the new territories
leased from the People's Republic of China by
the British government, a group of men helped
construct fences and lawns for the Haven of Hope
Hospital, and one woman and two men aided as
nurses and assistants in the clinics there.
In addition to the English teaching, members
of the group served as volunteer recreation direc
tors in the apartment roof-top schools in the
refugee area of Hong Kong. Hong Kong has no
system of public education, and in a city where
one half the population is below the age of 16,
learning can be as desperate a problem as water
and housing.
The schools conducted on the roofs of the
refugee apartments pose one solution to this
need. Stanford students assisted in directing
games, since they could not aid the Chinese aca
demically.
ONK STUDKNT felt this was the more satis
fying part of his job. The "helloes" he received,
heavily British as they were, added greatly to his
enjoyment of the trip.
The actual language Instruction took place in
many locations. A few students spent the summer
in Portuguese Macau with student refugees from
China. The majority taught college students in
the Hong Kong YMCA.
Perhaps the most interesting work was that
undertaken by the students who taught refugee
doctors. Although these doctors had already re
ceived trainim* in their home counlrv. Hi<• Chi

nese certificates do not suffice for practice in the
Commonwealth, and so they must again pass ex
amination in English.
THE AVERAGE member of the group had two
and one-half hour classes five nights a week and
one afternoon. He also had charge of a recreation
class in the rooftop schools.
But the students found plenty of time to tour
I long Kong, shop, and meet fellow college students
from foreign countries.
One student felt that the whole trip had been
more worthwhile for the members of the WUS
group than it had been for the people they were
assisting. "After all," he explained, "we brought
them fractions of our culture, and while bringing
it we were able to sec theirs in total."
Before the regular projects began, the students
underwent a thorough introductory program.
DEPARTING FROM San Francisco in late
June, the group spent two weeks travelling
through the southern part of Japan. The students
met with men and women from Japanese Univer
sities, visited Buddhist Temples and Shinto
Shrines, were given lectures by experts on Eastern
cultures.
The group then proceeded to Taiwan, the island
of Nationalist China, where they met and talked
with members of the right-wing China Youth
Corps and enjoyed a picnic lunch.
Another student stated that the lessons he had
learned in Japan helped considerably in under
standing the situation in Hong Kong. ''The thing
you first notice," he said, "is the separation in
the Japanese generations." The traditional exists
side by side with the modern and with what could
more properly Ik- called the American rock and
roll, baseball, and western movies. The patrons
are of different ages and backgrounds, of course,
and this split is evident in other more important
areas.
WHEN THE ST I DENTS arrived in Hong
Kong, they wore confronted by the same type of
situation. Hong Kong is a city of refugees. The
people who live there come from farms that have
been in the family for hundreds of years, trades
that they have executed for hundreds of years,
and they are faced with a new situation, a mod
