# AFTER PACE
## New Emphasis On 'Plant' 
### ROBERT NAYLOR Editor (First of two articles) 
Stanford's Plan of Action for a
Challenging Era (PACE*, the
largest single fund-raising cam
paign ever attempted by one uni
versity, was just the beginning of
a decade of construction and ex
pansion at Stanford.
The three-year, SI 13 million
PACE program officially ended
this summer with the collection
of the last few dollars of the Ford
Foundation matching grant.
THE NEXT six years will see
the construction of over $56 mil

lion in new, non-PACE-supported
facilities as compared with about
$2.3 million in PACE buildings
completed, under construction, or
in the last stages of planning.
This emphasis on construction
and renovation improvement of
the "plant.' as administrative jar
gon describes Stanford facilities
â€”is actually a change from the
primary concerns of PACE. While
PACE is commonly misconstrued
as a construction drive, only 41.5
of the 100 million dollars were
originally allocated to construc
tion, and some $15 million of that
was never raised for the specific
PACE projects planned.

i Instead, the first priority seen
by those who launched PACE was j
increasing the quality of the fac
julty and students at Stanford. To |
; that end PACE contributed to a ;
27 per cent increase in faculty,
salaries and an increase of stu
dent aid from 02.6 million in 1960
to $4.2 million in 1962-63.
WHILE EFFORTS will continue
I along these lines in the next
[ few years, plant improvement is
i likely to receive first priority.
The reason for this change in !
(emphasis is probably best
j summed up by Vice President of
Finance Kenneth M. Cuthbertson:
"Recent recruits from first-rate
j colleges and universities are usu
ally surprised and sometimes ap
palled by our shortcomings in
academic space and student resi
liences. In spite of substantial
construction in recent years.
Stanford's plant does not yet
match its people and programs
in size or quality."
THE IDEAS now under study ;
for improving the planl will affect j
every part of the University. The!
School of Law can expert major
renovation and expansion of the
present facilities, with emphasis
on improving the library.
Dramatics and the theatre arts
will be given a boost with ihe
construction of a specially-de!
signed theater, and there is talk 1
of a new building for the Music !
Department.
Massive renovation of present ;
Quad facilities will expand their |
capacity considerably. Beginning
with Jordan Hall, the major Quad |
buildings will be reconstructed to i
| accommodate more floors within
the same framework.
EXTENSIVE new dormitory
[facilities are also planned. Once!
the new undergraduate men's and ;
women's dorms are completed
[(scheduled under PACE, but no
lunds were raised), a dormitory}
for graduate women and another)
for graduate men will be built, j
Other projects include renova- >
tion of existing athletic facilities,!
once the new Pavilion is con
structed; improvement of the
Hopkins Marine Station; further
work on the Stanford Museum; I
new facilities for the Food Re
search Institute; new "commu
nity" facilities such as the Fire-j
house and the Corporation Yard; ;
revamping <>l the engineering
shops; a thorough renovation of!
the present library facilities.

in raising the funds tor this new
construction, as well sis further
