A chemical formula or a problem in physics can only be
conclusively proved by means of experiment. Likewise, the
claims of Christianity can only be proved to the individual
through experience. In effect, Christianity says that personal
God exists and that He longs to make Himself known to you
in the Person of His Son, Jesus Christ. If you will honestly
give Him a chance, Christ will enable you to experience His
reality, His life-giving power, and will give you eternal life.
But God commends his love toward us, in that, while
we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8)
"... believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved." (Acts 16:31
"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power
to become the sons of God, eVep to them that believe on His
name." (John 1:12)
If the claims of Christianity are true, if, in fact, God does
exist and Christ is the only way that we can have a personal
relationship with Him, is this not the most supremely im
portant matter in life? Moreover, in view of the testimony of
untold millions that Christ has transformed their lives, don't
you think that you owe it to yourself to make an honest in
vestigation of the claims of the Bible? Why not read the Gos
pel of John today and as you read God's Word, pray sin
cerely for God to reveal Himself to you? You will find that
faith which begins as an experiment will truly become an
experience.
"O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the
man that trusteth in Him." (Psalm 34:8)

A chemical formula or a problem in physics can only be
conclusively proved by means of experiment. Likewise, the
claims of Christianity can only be proved to the individual
through experience. In effect, Christianity says that personal
God exists and that He longs to make Himself known to you
in the Person of His Son, Jesus Christ. If you will honestly
give Him a chance, Christ will enable you to experience His
reality, His life-giving power, and will give you eternal life.
But God commends his love toward us, in that, while
we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." (Romans 5:8)
"... believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be
saved." (Acts 16:31
"But as many as received Him, to them gave He power
to become the sons of God, eVep to them that believe on His
name." (John 1:12)
If the claims of Christianity are true, if, in fact, God does
exist and Christ is the only way that we can have a personal
relationship with Him, is this not the most supremely im
portant matter in life? Moreover, in view of the testimony of
untold millions that Christ has transformed their lives, don't
you think that you owe it to yourself to make an honest in
vestigation of the claims of the Bible? Why not read the Gos
pel of John today and as you read God's Word, pray sin
cerely for God to reveal Himself to you? You will find that
faith which begins as an experiment will truly become an
experience.
"O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the
man that trusteth in Him." (Psalm 34:8)
