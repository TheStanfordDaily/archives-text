# Two New Peninsula Theaters
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
The San Francisco Peninsula
is the site of two new additions
to a fast-growing part of the en
tertainment industry — the arena
(or in-the-round) theater.
The Hyatt House Theatre — at
tlie Burlingame freeway exit a
few miles south of the airport
opened September 15 and is now
well under way (see review on
this page). The Circle Star
Theatre—just north of the Whip
ple Ave. freeway exit at the Red
wood City-San Carlos border —
will open October 13.
I SPENT almost three months
this summer at a similar theater
(the Valley Music Theatre in Los
Angeles), and I'd like to discuss

these two new theaters and how
they — and others like them —are
operated.
Each theater usually does hit
Broadway shows and runs them
for two weeks each. There are
exceptions, of course: the Circle
Star is presenting Nat King
Cole's revue for two weeks in
November and Valley ran "My
Fair Lady" for four weeks.
These theaters usually follow
the star system; that, is, import
ing "name" actors as leads for
each show. Thus the Peninsula
this fall will see such stars as
Janet Blair, Juliet Prowse, How
ard Keel and Jane Powell. Th e
star is paid on a percentage basis
—the larger the audience, th e
larger the paycheck, ranging usu
ally from a guaranteed minimum
of about $3,000 per week up to a

potential high of $15,000 per
week.
THE SUPPORTING actors are
also imported for each produc
tion, but it is not uncommon for
some supporting players to ap
pear in several shows in one sea
son. One actor at Valley, for ex
ample, appeared in three shows
in a row. And an actress appeared
in two in a row this summer
and will do two more in a row
this fall. These actors, along with
stars, only rehearse for one week
before opening.
In addition, each theater has
a resident company of singers
and dancers who appear in every
show. These people rehearse each
show for two weeks, so they no
sooner open one show than they
start rehearsing the next.
An arena theater, for those who
don't know, is one in which the
stage is circular and the audience
sits on all sides of the stage. This
arrangement, like most things in
the theater, is in some ways good
and in others bad.
PERHAPS THE greatest ad
vantage is that many more people
are much closer to the stage. In
both the 2,500 seat Hyatt and the
3,300 seat Circle Star, no one is
ever more than 60 feet from the
stage. In virtually any Broadway
theater (none of which seats 2,000
people), at least a third or more
people are more than 60 feet from
the stage. (And because of the
larger capacities, ticket prices in
these theaters are lower than
in New York or even San Fran
cisco's larger theaters.)
Arena theater is, further, nicer
for the actors. They know that

wherever they turn, they are al
ways facing someone. However,
they must never stay facing in
one direction for too long or the
people who see only their backs
will become disgruntled.
Still a third advantage is that
arena theater is, simply, a tre
mendously vibrant form of thea
ter. It's fun to see the scenery be
ing carried up and down the aisles
inthe dark. To see an actor exit,
race up an aisle, take off hi s
clothes at the top of the aisle
(sometimes even in the aisle),
then re-enter immediately in a
costume that had been under- the
one he took off is a new anil in
teresting experience. To -some
people this is very distracting,
but I happen to think that it's ex
citing.
(THIS PRACTICE of under
dressing — taking off a costume
and having the next one on un
derneath — is quite common in
arena theater. Very often an actor
has two or even three costumes
on simultaneously. In "Gypsy,"
for example, ihe girl in the title
role wears four costumes at a
time at two different parts of the
show.)
Perhaps the major disadvan
tage is that, by having no side
away from Ihe audience, it is
often difficult to focus attention
on a specific area of the stage.
And, of course, the sets can
only suggest a place; they cannot
show it as they can in a pros
cenium theater.
But to me these are minor prob
lems, and I feel that a show at
an arena theater can be, for most
people, a thoroughly enjoyable
theatrical experience.
