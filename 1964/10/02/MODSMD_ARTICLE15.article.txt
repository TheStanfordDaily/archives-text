# 'Annie Get Your Gun' Successful Production
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
What Ginger Rogers lacks in
vocal ability, she makes up for
with personality. Ancl the infec
tious warmth of her personality
should be more than enough to
assure a successful run for "An
nie Get Your Gun," currently at
the Hyatt Music Theatre in Bur
lingame.
Miss .Rogers plays sharpshooter
Annie Oakley in this vintage
musical and she obviously is en
joying every minute of this corny
but nonetheless delightful show.
Till] RATHER banal plot deals
with the rivalry between two
Wild West shows in the late
1800's and the romance between
Annie and marksman Frank But
ler (played by Byron Palmer)
which becomes embroiled in this
rivalry. With the help of some
good sentimentality, all turns
out happily just in time for the
final curtain.
But never mind. For, woven
through the meanderings of the
plot is Irving Berlin's finest
score. Songs like "Doin' What
Comes Naturally," "They Say It's
Wonderful" and"( There's No
Business Like) Show Business"
are the biggest hits in a program
that includes Palmer's lyric "The
Girl That I Marry," Miss Rogers'
hilarious "You Can't Get A Man
With A Gun" and her lovely bal
lad, "Lost In His Arms."
The entire cast hits the bull's

eye with this show. Palmer is the
sort: of handsome masculinity
symbol that the role requires and
he has a voice to go along with it.
Priscilla Morrill, Thomas Glynn,
Jim Demarest, Kay E. Kuter and
especially Zachary Charles (as a
delightful Indian chief) all stand
out in the large supporting cast.
AL CHECCO'S fluid direction
and Jack Beaber's lively choreog
raphy make good use of the small
stage and often extend into the
aisles as well, taking full advan
tage of the arena theater in which
they are working. Both have
solved the problems inherent in
any arena theater with ingenuity,
and if some of Beaber's dances
seem not to reach a real climax
(particularly in the final scene
of the first act), this is only a
minor criticism.
Tad Anheier's sets are neces
sarily skeletal but ably suggest
the various locales; his Pullman
car sot is outstanding. A 1 Jutzi's
lighting is similarly effective.
George Hirst's musical direc
tion is admirably crisp, but it
would help if the orchestra were
quieter. The show is quite
brassy and too often the singers
are drowned out.
A few technical probelms on
opening night — no doubt cor
rected by now — only proved how
capable this company is. They all
went right on as if nothing had
happened, and the audience was
having too much fun to notice.
