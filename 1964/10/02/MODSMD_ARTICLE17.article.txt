# Bergman, Quinn Excellent In New Film, 'The Visit'
## 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Crtic 
"Great" has been applied loose
ly for so long in referring to
drama that it is now almost mean
ingless; yet, used in its former
figurative sense, namely, being of
such unquestionable stature as to
command respect and admiration,
it is an accurate one-word ap
praisal of "The Visit." For "The
Visit" is a great motion picture
: (or as nearly so as imperfect man
can make it) in all respects.
First of all, of course, is the
play, the most important part of
any theatre, celluloid or living.
There is, or ought to be, a maxim
that the dramatist who can write
his idea into his plot is a least
assured that what he has to say
will never be obscured by bad
acting; and when the idea in his
plot is a profound one, he has
written something invaluable.
FRIEDRICH DLRRENMATT
has wedded form and idea in "The
Visit" with such consummate skill
that the validity of his judgment
of mankind, his idea, is nearly
impossible to reject. Briefly, In
grid Bergman, once driven out of
Gallon, a small town in Eastern
Europe, on a false charge of pros
titution, returns as the richest
woman in the world, and agrees
to give the town two million if
they will kill Anthony Quinn, the
man who had proved her a pros
titute when she had named him
the father of her unborn child.
Quinn, in the interval, has be
come a successful shopkeeper, is
married and has a child, and will
probably he the next mayor of
Gallen. Gallen. in the interval has
inexplicably become a very poor
I town. Naturally the townspeople,
though they had welcomed Berg
man's arrival and the possibility
of her money, angrily reject her
condition.
But she is willing to wait, and
to apply pressure in subtle ways
that eventually succeed in forc
ing the townspeople to accede on
their own initiative. Here the sus
pense of a man at the mercy of
his supposed friends, and of his
growing realization that they are
turning against him, is respon
sible for the impact of the plot,
and thus the picture.
QITINN IS TRIED, found
guilty, and sentenced to death ac
cording to her plan. But Berg
man is not quite finished: for the

town AND Quinn must bo made
to suffer forever in the dreadful
knowledge that their own failing
as men has brought this misfor
lune upon them. It is this failing
that is the statement of "The
Visit"; for Durrenmatt is clearly
saying that man is not made of
that stern stuff that would make
him uphold the demands of jus
tice and honor in spite of the
consequences. All do suffer; and,
in the light of what a more or
less virtuous group of people is
willing to do, his appraisal is ter
rifying accurate.
Karla, the wronged women, is
less a person than a symbol, less
a human than an avenging angel.
Most of her died when she was
driven out, and all that remains
is an iron will and an inexorable
purpose. Ingrid Bergman realizes
this and directs her every move
ment toward such a portrayal.
From her first entrance she is
in unquestioned command of her
self, her retinue, the whole town.
Never does she drop that regal
bearing that awes the townsfolk
and gives her safe passage
through the mob. It is a superb
performance.
SERGEI, THE doomed man,
ought to be a man like all the
other townspeople in appearance
and presence, but sufficiently
striking so that once identified he
would always be conspicuous. An
thony Quinn is perhaps too com
manding a figure, but t hat is the
only quarrel with him. He is so
alive that his fear, his rages, his
panic, his resignation, become
those of the audience, so much
so that empathy, that rare thing,
exists between actor and viewer.
Bernhard Wicki has directed
firmly and subtly, so that all is
subordinated to the confrontation
between Quinn and Bergman,
Quinn and the town, and (in the
end) Bergman and the town. His
use of rapid alternation between
closeups and distance shots, his
handling of crowd scenes, and his
smooth transitions are extremely
effective in emphasizing the pe
rennial confrontation. The sets
and properties are expertly chos
en, and the photography is as
stark as the subject. In fact, "The
Visit" is quite simply a great pic
ture, and not to be missed.

can make it) in all respects.
First of all, of course, is the
play, the most important part of
any theatre, celluloid or living.
There is, or ought to be, a maxim
that the dramatist who can write
his idea into his plot is a least
assured that what he has to say
will never be obscured by bad
acting; and when the idea in his
plot is a profound one, he has
written something invaluable.
FRIEDRICH DLRRENMATT
has wedded form and idea in "The
Visit" with such consummate skill
that the validity of his judgment
of mankind, his idea, is nearly
impossible to reject. Briefly, In
grid Bergman, once driven out of
Gallon, a small town in Eastern
Europe, on a false charge of pros
titution, returns as the richest
woman in the world, and agrees
to give the town two million if
they will kill Anthony Quinn, the
man who had proved her a pros
titute when she had named him
the father of her unborn child.
Quinn, in the interval, has be
come a successful shopkeeper, is
married and has a child, and will
probably he the next mayor of
Gallen. Gallen. in the interval has
inexplicably become a very poor
I town. Naturally the townspeople,
though they had welcomed Berg
man's arrival and the possibility
of her money, angrily reject her
condition.
But she is willing to wait, and
to apply pressure in subtle ways
that eventually succeed in forc
ing the townspeople to accede on
their own initiative. Here the sus
pense of a man at the mercy of
his supposed friends, and of his
growing realization that they are
turning against him, is respon
sible for the impact of the plot,
and thus the picture.
QITINN IS TRIED, found
guilty, and sentenced to death ac
cording to her plan. But Berg
man is not quite finished: for the

town AND Quinn must bo made
to suffer forever in the dreadful
knowledge that their own failing
as men has brought this misfor
lune upon them. It is this failing
that is the statement of "The
Visit"; for Durrenmatt is clearly
saying that man is not made of
that stern stuff that would make
him uphold the demands of jus
tice and honor in spite of the
consequences. All do suffer; and,
in the light of what a more or
less virtuous group of people is
willing to do, his appraisal is ter
rifying accurate.
Karla, the wronged women, is
less a person than a symbol, less
a human than an avenging angel.
Most of her died when she was
driven out, and all that remains
is an iron will and an inexorable
purpose. Ingrid Bergman realizes
this and directs her every move
ment toward such a portrayal.
From her first entrance she is
in unquestioned command of her
self, her retinue, the whole town.
Never does she drop that regal
bearing that awes the townsfolk
and gives her safe passage
through the mob. It is a superb
performance.
SERGEI, THE doomed man,
ought to be a man like all the
other townspeople in appearance
and presence, but sufficiently
striking so that once identified he
would always be conspicuous. An
thony Quinn is perhaps too com
manding a figure, but t hat is the
only quarrel with him. He is so
alive that his fear, his rages, his
panic, his resignation, become
those of the audience, so much
so that empathy, that rare thing,
exists between actor and viewer.
Bernhard Wicki has directed
firmly and subtly, so that all is
subordinated to the confrontation
between Quinn and Bergman,
Quinn and the town, and (in the
end) Bergman and the town. His
use of rapid alternation between
closeups and distance shots, his
handling of crowd scenes, and his
smooth transitions are extremely
effective in emphasizing the pe
rennial confrontation. The sets
and properties are expertly chos
en, and the photography is as
stark as the subject. In fact, "The
Visit" is quite simply a great pic
ture, and not to be missed.
"Great" has been applied loose
ly for so long in referring to
drama that it is now almost mean
ingless; yet, used in its former
figurative sense, namely, being of
such unquestionable stature as to
command respect and admiration,
it is an accurate one-word ap
praisal of "The Visit." For "The

written something invaluable.
FRIEDRICH DLRRENMATT
has wedded form and idea in "The
Visit" with such consummate skill
that the validity of his judgment
of mankind, his idea, is nearly
impossible to reject. Briefly, In
grid Bergman, once driven out of
Gallon, a small town in Eastern
Europe, on a false charge of pros
titution, returns as the richest
woman in the world, and agrees
to give the town two million if
they will kill Anthony Quinn, the
man who had proved her a pros
titute when she had named him
the father of her unborn child.
Quinn, in the interval, has be
come a successful shopkeeper, is
married and has a child, and will
probably he the next mayor of
Gallen. Gallen. in the interval has
inexplicably become a very poor
I town. Naturally the townspeople,
though they had welcomed Berg
man's arrival and the possibility
of her money, angrily reject her
condition.
But she is willing to wait, and
to apply pressure in subtle ways
that eventually succeed in forc
ing the townspeople to accede on
their own initiative. Here the sus
pense of a man at the mercy of
his supposed friends, and of his
growing realization that they are
turning against him, is respon
sible for the impact of the plot,
and thus the picture.
QITINN IS TRIED, found
guilty, and sentenced to death ac
cording to her plan. But Berg
man is not quite finished: for the

town AND Quinn must bo made
to suffer forever in the dreadful
knowledge that their own failing
as men has brought this misfor
lune upon them. It is this failing
that is the statement of "The
Visit"; for Durrenmatt is clearly
saying that man is not made of
that stern stuff that would make
him uphold the demands of jus
tice and honor in spite of the
consequences. All do suffer; and,
in the light of what a more or
less virtuous group of people is
willing to do, his appraisal is ter
rifying accurate.
Karla, the wronged women, is
less a person than a symbol, less
a human than an avenging angel.
Most of her died when she was
driven out, and all that remains
is an iron will and an inexorable
purpose. Ingrid Bergman realizes
this and directs her every move
ment toward such a portrayal.
From her first entrance she is
in unquestioned command of her
self, her retinue, the whole town.
Never does she drop that regal
bearing that awes the townsfolk
and gives her safe passage
through the mob. It is a superb
performance.
SERGEI, THE doomed man,
ought to be a man like all the
other townspeople in appearance
and presence, but sufficiently
striking so that once identified he
would always be conspicuous. An
thony Quinn is perhaps too com
manding a figure, but t hat is the
only quarrel with him. He is so
alive that his fear, his rages, his
panic, his resignation, become
those of the audience, so much
so that empathy, that rare thing,
exists between actor and viewer.
Bernhard Wicki has directed
firmly and subtly, so that all is
subordinated to the confrontation
between Quinn and Bergman,
Quinn and the town, and (in the
end) Bergman and the town. His
use of rapid alternation between
closeups and distance shots, his
handling of crowd scenes, and his
smooth transitions are extremely
effective in emphasizing the pe
rennial confrontation. The sets
and properties are expertly chos
en, and the photography is as
stark as the subject. In fact, "The
Visit" is quite simply a great pic
ture, and not to be missed.
