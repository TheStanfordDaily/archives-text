# Cards Face Zeno's Runs, Passes
## 
### PETE EAKLAND Sports Editor 
Stanford's first game was pri
marily offense, the second pri
marily defense. Against UCLA
Saturday, Coach Ralston hopes
his squad can combine the two
and even its conference record at
1-1 and humble the seven-point
favorite Bruins, who have bested
the football powers Pitt and Penn
State this season. Whatever the
outcome, he promises a rough
but interesting contest.
Ralston indicated that to win
Stanford must stop or at least
limit the running and passing of
Bruin quarterback Larry Zono,
whom he calls "a real fine offen
sive quarterback."
ZENO HAS led the Bruins in
passing since putting on a UCLA
uniform. This year, he has com
pleted 21 passes out of 13 attempts
to account for 284 yards and four
touchdowns. He is also a danger
ous runner with 165 yards gained
on the ground which is more
than two-thirds of UCLA's total
rushing yardage. Statistics show
that exactly one of every two
UCLA plays is either a Zeno pass
or a Zeno run.
Zeno has three excellent receiv
ers to throw to: ends Kurt Alton
berg and Dirk Witcher. and half
back Mike Hallner. Between them,
they have hauled in seventeen
passes for 236 yards.
Of the other baekfield men be
sides Zeno, Ralston considers
Cornell Champion, the speedy new
halfback, ihe most dangerous.
Against Penn State, he put the
Uclans out in front 14-0 with a
40-yard scamper in the third quar
ter.
OTHER Bruins backs certain
to carry the pigskin are fullback
Jim Collctto, and halfbacks Mike
Haffner and Steve Durbin. But
their low yards per carry aver
ages indicate that UCLA must
pass to win.
UCLA was a young team 1 a s t
year and its record reflected this,
two wins against eight losses. This
year, twenty-six lettermen return

and with a year's humbling, but
valuable experience, they are in
volved in a pride-restoring cam
paign. So far they've been suc
cessful.
Stanford's problem in its first
two games has been that it can't
protect a lead. Going into the
fourth quarter, Stanford has had
leads of four points and three
points. But by the time these
games have reached their agon
izing end, these leads had dwin
dled ten points to inflict Stanford
with a six-point setback in one
case and one point to give Stan
ford a narrow two-point victory in
the other. After last week's game,
Ralston complained of a lack of'
savagery.
UCLA IN its two wins has not
dominated the statistics. In fact,
they couldn't be more evenly
matched. What has kept the
Bruin slate unblemished so far
has been the ability to get a TD
or to repulse an opponent's march
in tight situations. In fact, no
team has yet scored on UCLA in
the fourth quarter. On the Stan
ford side of the ledger, opponents
have scored 20 points in the final
stanza.
Neither defensive back C ra ig I
Ritchey or defensive tackle Gary j
Petligrew has practiced this week
because of injuries. To bolster
the defensive secondary in case
Ritchey will not be available, Ral
ston has given Dick Ragsdale
experience this week at safety.
Reserve Dave Lewis has been
working at both quarterback, his
normal position, and flanker back
â™¦his week. Along with Dale Ru
bin, he may see action at th is
new position if Ragsdale is re
quired to do much defense work.
RAESTON'S reason for shift
ing Lewis to flanker is that he
knows the pass plays well through
his quarterback experience. Stan
ford fans have been anxious to
see Ihe talented Indian's Indian
perform this season after his fine
showing in spring ball.

Singled out for yeoman duty
last week and expected to do simi
lar jobs tomorrow were ends Bob
Howard and A 1 Wilburn.
During the week, Stanford has
been striving for consistency and
ironing out the wrinkles in both

t ho offense and the defense. Ral
ston expects the UCLA defense
to key on halfback Ray Handley.
For this reason, Stanford, which
currently is last in passing off
ense in the AAWU, may take to
the air.


LARRY ZENO, star quarterback, will lead UCLA against the Indians
Saturday in Los Angeles. Game time is 8:00.
