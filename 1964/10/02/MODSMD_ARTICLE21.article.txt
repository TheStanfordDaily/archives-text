## 
### PETE EAKLAND Sports Editor 
The teimination of classes in
the spring does not spell the end
of competition for all Stanford's
athletes. During the summer,
prominent tournaments a n d
meets both national and interna
tional in scope took place, and
many Tribe sportsmen vied for
top spots.
IN THE I.ATTEIi part of June,
several Stanford teams competed
in NCAA championships. The
track squad journeyed to Eugene
for the NCAA track meet, but it
could not duplicate its strong
finish of the year before and
managed only a single point on
Steve Cortwright's sixth place in
the hurdles.
The Indian golf and tennis con
tingents fared better in year-end

NCAA tourneys, finishing eighth
and sixth respectively.
The women's tennis team, led
by nationally ranked members
Janie Albert and Julie Heldman,
dominated the Women's National
Collegiate tennis championships
held in North Carolina, by both
advancing to Iho singles final and
by combining talents to reach
the doubles final. Miss Albert cap
tured the singles title by down
ing Miss Heldman in a close,
three set match. After this tourna
ment. both girls continued to dis
tinguish Ihemselves in eastern
circuit play.
NOT ALL Stanford athletes
wore the Cardinal and White.
Competing in numerous trials and
across the country, some ulti
mately gained berths on the
United States Olympic squad.
Dave Weill, tri-captain of the
1963 track squad and NCAA dis
cuss champion while at Stanford,
placed third in ihe Olympic trials
with a discus throw of 191' 2 V' to
earn a spot on the team.
One of the big reasons why
Stanford won the NCAA water
polo championship last year was
the clutch goal tending of George
Stransky. He has been named to
the Olympic water polo squad.
TWO KOWIiRS from Stanford
will dip their oars in Tokyo
waters. Crew coach Conn Finlay,
who already has a gold and a
bronze medal from previous
Olympic' Games, will compete in
the double oars event. Under
graduate Tony Ralphs qualified
in a sculling event.
Two other Stanford mentors
will he in Tokyo in coaching capa
cities. Payton Jordan will serve
as an assistant track and field
coach and "Dutch" Fehring will
assist USC's Rod Dedeaux in
managing a group of 20 amateur
players which will play against
non-pro all-star teams from Japan
during the Games. Stanford's

loading hitter last year as a sopho
more, catcher Jim Hibbs was se
lected as a member of this team.
Two Stanford students now
playing in the professional foot
ball ranks have been in the lime
light. Steve Thurlow, Stanford's

leading rusher lasi year and iho
N.Y. Giants' number two draft
choice, is installed as the second
string halfback behind Dick
James. Last year's co-captain,
Marv Harris, is now playing line
backer for the L.A. Rams.

For I lie N.Y. Mots, Bill Wake
field, who was a senior last year,
lias appeared in approximately (>()
games as a relief pitcher. He
signed a pro contract before he
had a chance to compete in a
Stanford uniform.
