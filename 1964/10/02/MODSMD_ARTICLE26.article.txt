# LASSU's Albatross
## 
### 
Within the next few days most students w ill
face the task of electing their representatives to
the Legislature.
Every year the student body is told how im
portant this election is and that the selection of
representatives should be made carefully. But
despite all the cajoling LASSU races have never
inspired much interest.
A house or fraternity usually is lucky if
someone volunteers to represent it at meetings
of the Legislature, meetings which have the
reputation of being the dullest of any organiza
tion at Stanford. If there is ever a contest for
the post, fewer than thirty per cent will vote
in the election, and those few vote only because
a friend is running.
Unfortunately, this traditional lack of inter
est is bound to prevail, since LASSU meetings
must I>\ definition remain "dull" to all but a
few.
LASSU's primary concerns are with Univer
sity policx which affects students (housing, cam
pus political activity, student course evaluation,
etc.) and with overseeing and appropriating
lunds for the various ASSU boards and commis
sions.
Most students are not even faintly interested
in these areas. Even if it has some faults the
University is, alter all, not a bad place to go to
school—in fact, it is excellent. Most students do
not presume to know anything about University
policy, and they are usually too concerned with
their studies and or social life to quibble over
improving b\ some smallest of degrees their
academic cm ironmont.

Two years ago a new ASSU constitution was
adopted which changed the size of the Legisla
ture from 30 to 120 members. The proponents
of this change believed that LASSU would be
come more representative, would be given
greater attention by the University and by the
students, and would be able to speak out as the
voice of the students on political issues, thereby
increasing student interest and involvement. The
idea was to make LASSU relevant to those prob
lems of real interest to the student body.
But LASSU was prevented from taking politi
cal stands by a ruling of the Board of Trustees.
And the increase in its size lias not increased
the number of students actively interested in
student government.
While we certainly can hope that there will
be a sudden student awakening and that a wide
interest will develop in those areas with which
LASSU is concerned, we do not expect it to
happen.
There is no doubt that a number of reforms
can be made to make LASSU more effective as
a legislative bod\ and to eliminate some of the
tiring parliamentary red-tape. Reforms in the
committee system and in the structure of regu
lar meetings, for example, might go far to im
prove interest and attendance.
But a realistic prediction would be that a lew
highly involved students who are interested in
what are important, if not 'exciting,' matters will
run LASSU and its committees and will sit
through the long, complicated meetings without
shedding a single tear of boredom.

of the Legislature, meetings which have the
reputation of being the dullest of any organiza
tion at Stanford. If there is ever a contest for
the post, fewer than thirty per cent will vote
in the election, and those few vote only because
a friend is running.
Unfortunately, this traditional lack of inter
est is bound to prevail, since LASSU meetings
must I>\ definition remain "dull" to all but a
few.
LASSU's primary concerns are with Univer
sity policx which affects students (housing, cam
pus political activity, student course evaluation,
etc.) and with overseeing and appropriating
lunds for the various ASSU boards and commis
sions.
Most students are not even faintly interested
in these areas. Even if it has some faults the
University is, alter all, not a bad place to go to
school—in fact, it is excellent. Most students do
not presume to know anything about University
policy, and they are usually too concerned with
their studies and or social life to quibble over
improving b\ some smallest of degrees their
academic cm ironmont.

Two years ago a new ASSU constitution was
adopted which changed the size of the Legisla
ture from 30 to 120 members. The proponents
of this change believed that LASSU would be
come more representative, would be given
greater attention by the University and by the
students, and would be able to speak out as the
voice of the students on political issues, thereby
increasing student interest and involvement. The
idea was to make LASSU relevant to those prob
lems of real interest to the student body.
But LASSU was prevented from taking politi
cal stands by a ruling of the Board of Trustees.
And the increase in its size lias not increased
the number of students actively interested in
student government.
While we certainly can hope that there will
be a sudden student awakening and that a wide
interest will develop in those areas with which
LASSU is concerned, we do not expect it to
happen.
There is no doubt that a number of reforms
can be made to make LASSU more effective as
a legislative bod\ and to eliminate some of the
tiring parliamentary red-tape. Reforms in the
committee system and in the structure of regu
lar meetings, for example, might go far to im
prove interest and attendance.
But a realistic prediction would be that a lew
highly involved students who are interested in
what are important, if not 'exciting,' matters will
run LASSU and its committees and will sit
through the long, complicated meetings without
shedding a single tear of boredom.
Within the next few days most students w ill
face the task of electing their representatives to
the Legislature.
Every year the student body is told how im
portant this election is and that the selection of
representatives should be made carefully. But
despite all the cajoling LASSU races have never
inspired much interest.
A house or fraternity usually is lucky if
someone volunteers to represent it at meetings
of the Legislature, meetings which have the
reputation of being the dullest of any organiza
tion at Stanford. If there is ever a contest for
the post, fewer than thirty per cent will vote
