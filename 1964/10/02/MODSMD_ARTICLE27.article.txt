# NSA Congress 'Waste Of Time'
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Editor 
On August 16, 1961, 389 dele
gates from 178 colleges and uni
versities. little more than half
the total membership of the Na
tional Student Association, gath
ered at the University of Minne
sota for the 17th National Stu
dent Congress, the main event of
the year for NSA.
The purpose of the gathered
delegates was to sol the policy
of NSA for the coming year, to
make in the name of the U.S.
Student community a set of pro
nouncements on complex interna
tional. national, and campus
issues, pronouncements which the
officers and staff of the Associa
tion would use as guidelines until
the 18th Student Congress.
The Massive legislation
In eleven short days these 389
delegates, six of whom repre
sented Stanford, wrote, debated,
and passed over 70 resolutions,
basic policy declarations, and
constitutional amendments. The
Congress, for example, called for
the seating of the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party dele
gation at the Democratic Na
tional Convention, endorsed the
War on Poverty (but called it
only "a symbolic step"), asked
that voting age be reduced to
eighteen, called for elimination
of the draft, condemned all con
stitutional amendments which
would allow prayer or bible read
ing in public schools, declared na
tional security to be always sub
ordinate to civil liberties, asked
for abolition of the immigration
quota system and decided to dis
tribute birth control information!
to and help organize labor unions
for migratory workers. The Na
tional Student Congress even
asked ihe California Real Estate!
Association to repudiate its stand |
on Proposition 14.
On the international scene the
Congress condemned gove r n
ments of Iran, Syria, Iraq, Jor
dan, Aden, Afghanistan, Israel,
Morrocco, Ghana, Angola, Mo-1
zambique, Southern Rhodesia.:
South Africa, South West Africa.
Haiti, the Honduras, the Domini
can Republic, Cuba, Nicaragua, j
Paraguay, Ecuador, Brazil and |
Puerto Rico for various repres-!
sive measures. The Congress con
gratulated the students of South
Viet Nam for their role in the
overthrow of the Diem "dictator-j
ship."
And in the area of the student j
and his educational environment,
the Congress called for an im-,
mediate end to discrimination in
fraternities, condemned several
specific violations of academic
freedom, defined student rights I
and responsibilities, outlined the'

role of student government and
'the student press in relation to j
Ifaculty and administration, and
I called for studies of student wel
| fare and mental health, experi
mental education, and federal I
jciifi to higher education.
A legislative Miracle?
To accomplish all this, and a;
good deal more, in eleven days j
fas well as electing a slate of na
tional officers), may seem some-j
j thing of a legislative miracle.
However I ho massive amount of
legislation was only an indication,
]of the inadequate time spent, in
its consideration. To most of the
j delegates, the greater part of the
j Congress was a waste of time.
The Congress began with three
days of seminars which were sup- j
! posed to present the issues in a
j limited area anything from civil;
! rights to student judicial systems.
There were nineteen seminars,,
which meant that even a large
school with eight delegates could
, have them "informed" in less than
: half the areas of concern. For the:
J school of 600 students, the situa
1 1ion was infinitely worse.
But few of the seminars were i
i actually informative. Often the
j problems discussed were either
so general as to be meaningless
in specific application, or they
| were so specific, dealing with the
I problem at a particular school,
| that the lessons learned could not.
be generalized. With all types of
schools represented, from size of
'300 to 45,000, religiously affili
ated or non-denominational, state
supported or private, it became
j almost impossible to make the
I discussion relevant. The discus-;
! sion became vague and general,
land few solutions were offered
I to the mammoth problems posed.
It was no wonder that a good
j many delegates decided to sleep
i through half the seminars. Others
J sought out the worthwhile pre
sentations, which overflowed into
the halls.
Writing the Bills
After the seminars came two
days of subcommittee and com
mittee meetings for the purpose
of drafting legislation for pre
sentation to the plenary. Imagine
writing a decent. English essay
I with a group of ten or twenty
j students (mostly uninformed
about the subject matter), and
you have an idea how much time j
was wasted in subcommittee. Far
too little time was spent in the
researching and drafting of bills;
; as a result, poorly worded and
poorly organized bills were com
mon. Wrangling over simple
phrasing marked the Congress
from subcommittee to plenary, I
I and even then mistakes in gram-j
mar and horribly imprecise lan
-1 giuigc < such as "the freedom for

equal opportunity is an essential
right") were common in final leg
islation.
The plenary sessions were the
grandest spectacle of all. With as
many as 350 delegates on the
floor at one time, it was neces
sary to station six microphones
around the hall, a converted hall
room. If a delegate was sharp
and got in line soon enough, he
could gain recognition at the
microphone for his region.
In general, about 35 delegates
did 80'; of the debating. They
were among the 10'■/< who had
been to previous Congresses and
knew what was going on. Only a
half dozen of the floor debates
were well-informed or actually
listened to. and the major
speeches in these were prepared
in advance.
The Plenary 31<>ss
To get through all the business,
plenary sessions were extended to
three in the morning, the last
one until seven. There were over
30 hours of plenary, most of it
marked by parliamentary bicker
ing of incredible complexities.
The biggest problem for th e
delegate was finding out what
was being considered at a given
moment and getting a copy of it.
Too often the delegate was un
able to read what he was voting
on, or if he had the chance, he
was often so bored that he pre
ferred to play cards, usually
bridge, throw paper airplanes, go
to sleep at his table, or simply
leave.
A quorum (50' '< of the regis
tered delegates» often existed

only in the imagination of those
regional chairmen whose duty it
was to report the number of dele
gates present. If there was doubt
as to whether a quorum was
present, the chairman would
either rule a quorum call "dila
tory" or ask that the delegates
sleeping in the back of the hall
be awakened for the quorum
count.
A good many delegates felt that
the whole Congress needed re
structuring, that in general the
present system was a monstrous
waste of time and money.
Proposals For Reform
The most important criticism
was that the Congress did not
concentrate on sending the dele
gates home better informed about
issues which concerned them.
Rather, it used up nearly all Ihe
time in the drafting of legisla
tion, in the parliamentary a n d
stylistic wrangling which was
of no benefit to the delegates and
would have no effect on the in
dividual campus.
In last analysis, it must be
said that the Congress was lots
of fun for the delegates, that the
politics were intriguing and that
the local beer joints provided en
tertainment for those many who
were bored by the irrelevancies
of the day's work.
Rut was the Congress worth
while? Almost half the member
schools did not think it worth the
money to send delegates. The via
bility of NSA may depend on that
and other crucial questions raised
at this Congress -the subject of
the next article in this series.
