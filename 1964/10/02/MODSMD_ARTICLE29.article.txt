Dear Sir:
Richard Rapson's letter in yes
terday's Daily criticized an analy
sis of various newspapers which
appeared in last Friday's Frosh
edition, by using techniques which
should be quite below the caliber
to be expected from an instructor
in our history department.
.Ripping quotes totally out of
context, mixing the Daily's ex
plicit categories in the article
("Objectivity of News Coverage,"
"Editorial Sections," etc.), and
evidently totally neglecting to
read the article in its entirety
have served to discredit Mr. Rap
son's letter in the eyes of one
who lead the original article
which, if anything, itself dis
played a "liberal" bias.
Mr. Rapson objects to the judg
ment of the Daily that the New
York Times editorial page is "ex
tremely liberal." Rut he tosses
this into the middle of a discus
sion on slanting of news pages,
in which category the New York
Times was said by the Daily to
be "fair and largely unbiased in
its news coverage." Why did you
omit this, Mr. Rapson?
Mr. Rapson, skipping back to
news coverage, says the Daily
called the Oakland Tribune "con
servative 'but not to an objection
able degree!'" In fact, the Daily
said "The Oakland Tribune dis
plays a conservative bias in its
news pages, but not to an objec
tionable degree." Why did you
omit the word "bias," Mr. Rap
son?
Mr. Rapson disagree's that the
San Francisco Examiner is liberal.
Rut it endorsed Lyndon Johnson
and ADA-Vice Chairman Hubert
Humphrey. Does that make them
conservative?
Because the Daily neglected to
brand all conservatives as "reac
tionary" or "fascists" and all
Democrats and liberals as "mod
erate," Mr. Rapson apparently
concludes that the Daily is guilty
of distortion.
Could it be that Mr. Rapson
himself is biased?
Could it be that the Democrats
are really liberal? Is that a label
of which they (and lie) are now
ashamed?
