(Second of two articles)
"We must get behind us th c
idea that P£CE was the end-all.
Lots of people would like to feel
j that the effort is over, partly be
j cause $100 million is a fantastic
sum. But we need $300 million."
Thus stated Vice President of
j Finance Kenneth I\T. Cuthbertson.
j one of the men responsible for
I the amazing success of the re
cently-concluded Plan of Action
: for a Challenging Era.
WITH PACE under its belt,
j Stanford is now facing the c h a 1-
| lenge of a continued fund-raising
I effort for the next decade. The
I Board of Trustees and the Stan
; ford Associates are presently
I studying ways and means of
| raising the money to cover pro
i jected needs.
It is not yet decided whether
there will be another big push
similar to PACE. According to
| Cuthbertson, "We don't neces
j sarily need a monolithic campaign
! in order to do a good job at at
! trading large gifts."
Whatever is decided, the exped
ience gained during the PACE
; campaign will help it toward
future success.
THE EXTENSIVE national or
ganization used to collect th e
PACE funds is still active in many
areas. This consists of special gift
j committees of alumni in each re
gion who are kept in touch with
a committee of the Stanford As
sociations. "It's amazing how
many people were delighted to
stay on." said Cuthbertson.
Furthermore, he stated, "we
have learned a lot about how to
make known to prospective don
; ors what our needs are. We've got
ja better understanding of where
; the philanthropic dollar is t hat
; might be attracted to Stanford."
WIIIEE the broad strategy for
the next few years is still unde
termined, work has gone ahead to
j attract funds for special projects.
Left over fr om PACE are about
million, which, according to
Cuthbertson, can be used as
j "leverage" to attract further gifts.
| "Leverage" is a term used to de
scribe the phomonenon that when
a project is under way or partially
I financed (with 'leverage funds),
gifts arc much easier to get.
A continuing problem for Stan
ford is its small endowment
| (funds invested so that the in
come can be used to pay annual
expenses). Stanford has about
half the endowment of the more
established eastern schools.
TO HEM' meet the annual fund
problem, an alumni organization
'which was disbanded in the last

year of PACE is being rejuve
nated and will concentrate on
wider personal solieiation.
"Given our underfinaneing and
underbuilding, wc must be num
ber one or two in total gifts every
year in order to catch up," Cuth
bertson emphasized.
"Our biggest job is 1o get away
from the spectacular and get
people to understand how m u c h
the small gifts will do. We must
be able to convince the small
donor that he is doing some
thing."

there will be another big push
similar to PACE. According to
| Cuthbertson, "We don't neces
j sarily need a monolithic campaign
! in order to do a good job at at
! trading large gifts."
Whatever is decided, the exped
ience gained during the PACE
; campaign will help it toward
future success.
THE EXTENSIVE national or
ganization used to collect th e
PACE funds is still active in many
areas. This consists of special gift
j committees of alumni in each re
gion who are kept in touch with
a committee of the Stanford As
sociations. "It's amazing how
many people were delighted to
stay on." said Cuthbertson.
Furthermore, he stated, "we
have learned a lot about how to
make known to prospective don
; ors what our needs are. We've got
ja better understanding of where
; the philanthropic dollar is t hat
; might be attracted to Stanford."
WIIIEE the broad strategy for
the next few years is still unde
termined, work has gone ahead to
j attract funds for special projects.
Left over fr om PACE are about
million, which, according to
Cuthbertson, can be used as
j "leverage" to attract further gifts.
| "Leverage" is a term used to de
scribe the phomonenon that when
a project is under way or partially
I financed (with 'leverage funds),
gifts arc much easier to get.
A continuing problem for Stan
ford is its small endowment
| (funds invested so that the in
come can be used to pay annual
expenses). Stanford has about
half the endowment of the more
established eastern schools.
TO HEM' meet the annual fund
problem, an alumni organization
'which was disbanded in the last

year of PACE is being rejuve
nated and will concentrate on
wider personal solieiation.
"Given our underfinaneing and
underbuilding, wc must be num
ber one or two in total gifts every
year in order to catch up," Cuth
bertson emphasized.
"Our biggest job is 1o get away
from the spectacular and get
people to understand how m u c h
the small gifts will do. We must
be able to convince the small
donor that he is doing some
thing."
(Second of two articles)
"We must get behind us th c
idea that P£CE was the end-all.
Lots of people would like to feel
j that the effort is over, partly be
