# Grads Enter Resort Business

### RICH CASEY 
Throe Stanford graduate students have trans
formed what would have normally been a case
history assignment into a real-life situation in
volving the Consul General Bouphidis of Greece.
The trio. John Dare of New York. Bukk Carle
ton. forme! ly of Menlo Park, and Robert Ric hards
of Olympia, worked under the direction of Pro
fessor John Ewing and parlayed their course in
international business into a million-dollar, deluxe
overseas resort in the Greek Isles.
I'PON COMPLETING a 72-page master plan
for their 125-room, resort hotel on the island of
Corfu, their biggest problem was financing.
In order to secure the necessary capital of
$1,022,000 they applied for a $1.">0,000 loan from an
agency of the Greek government, and a bank
loan of $72,000, while hoping for $500,000 in pri
vate donations.
"In truth it was sheer luck," commented Prof.
Ewing, "that this venture ever got off the ground."
THE STI'OENTS were given a choice of four
countries in which to invest, assuming an initial
available capital of $100,000.
They chose Greece for many good reasons, and
to obtain background on this territory and up
to-date statistics they contacted Bouphidis.
As it happened, his wife had access to much
rnnl pstato oo Corfu: so wh.il st.'irtod as ;i rr^pnivh

project ended in a full-scale business venture.
"NORMALLY these assignments are designed
to provide employment for just one member of
the group, but through ingenuity and intelligence,
they fashioned a tremendous business for all
three of them," Prof. Ewing said.
John H. Rickey, owner of Rickey's Motels, has
agreed to go to Greece and serve as the students
building and finance consultant during the early
stages of development and operation.
They intend to incorporate as the "Kerkyra
Development Corporation," a stock-issuing com
pany. (Kerkyra is the Greek name for Corfu.)
THE TOURIST FLOW to this particular ami
off the northwest coast of Greece has increased
17 per cent over the past year. It is located right
on the ferry line linking the Italian and Greek
mainlands.
If, however the Cyprus dispute should escalate
into war between Greece and Turkey, they would
be out of business very quickly.
Nevertheless, they remain optimistic and hope
to see their plans begin lo materialize by
PRESENTLY, there fire no plans for other i«•-
sort hotels on the island which will provide such
varied recreational activities as swimming, water
skiing, horseback riding, spear-fishing, and sailing.
The hotel will be built in contemporary style
from native stone and other local materials. The
architects hone to complete the plans this month.
