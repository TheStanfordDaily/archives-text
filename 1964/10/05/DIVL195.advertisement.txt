How God
Speaks To Men
"Tii many separate revelations—cadi of which «et forth a portion of the Truth
anil in different ways God spoke of old to our Fathers in and by the prophets. Rut.
in the last of these days He lias spoken to us in the Person of a Son, Whom lie
appointed Heir and lawful Owner of all things, also by and through Whom 1 le ereateil
tlie worlds aud the reaches of space and the ages of time that is He made, produced,
built and arranged them in order, lie is the sole expression of the glory of (iod—
the Light-being, the out raying of the divine and He is the perfect imprint and very
image of Cod's nature, upholding and maintaining and guiding: and propelling the
universe by llis mighty word of power. When lie had by offering Himself accom
plished our cleansing of sins and riddance of guilt. He sat down at the right hand of
the divine Majesty on high." (Hebrews 1:1-3)
As noted, before Jesus Christ came to this earth Cod spoke to men through the
prophets and patriarchs of Israel. This Old Testament way of speaking to men has
now been set aside. God speaks to the present age only in and through the Lord
Jesus Christ, Who is, in fact the very image of the invisible God. These ''last days"
have extended over the past two thousand years of history, and will culminate with
the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.
It is vitally important that men today understand the revelation of Himself which
God has made in the Person of Jesus Christ. To ignore Jesus Christ is to ignore the
only avenue opened between God and man: "'that is, God was in Christ reconciling
the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to
us the ministry of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making
llis appeal through us. We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
For our sake lie made Him to be .sin who knew 110 sin, so that in Him we might
become the righteousness of God." (2 Corinthians 5:19-21)
Jesus Christ is met and known by millions today, as He has been over the cen
turies. These all testify, as did.the Apostle Paul, "For we ourselves were once fool
ish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our
days in malice and envy, hated by men and hating one another; but when the good
ness and loving kidness of God our Saviour appeared, lie saved us. not because
of deeds done in righteousness, but in virtue of His own mercy, by the washing of
regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit which He poured out upon us richly
through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that we might be justified by llis grace and
become heirs in hope of eternal life," (Titus 3:3-7)
Is God speaking to yon about your own needs and spiritual condition? Is God
calling you to Himself, urging you to seek llis forgiveness and love? Those who
received Jesus Christ have been joined to Him in a new and permanent relationship
of love and life. No strings attached, He stands ready to meet you today, if only
you are willing. Won't you let the Lord Jesus Christ be your all in all?

As noted, before Jesus Christ came to this earth Cod spoke to men through the
prophets and patriarchs of Israel. This Old Testament way of speaking to men has
now been set aside. God speaks to the present age only in and through the Lord
Jesus Christ, Who is, in fact the very image of the invisible God. These ''last days"
have extended over the past two thousand years of history, and will culminate with
the return of the Lord Jesus Christ.
It is vitally important that men today understand the revelation of Himself which
God has made in the Person of Jesus Christ. To ignore Jesus Christ is to ignore the
only avenue opened between God and man: "'that is, God was in Christ reconciling
the world to Himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to
us the ministry of reconciliation. So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making
llis appeal through us. We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
For our sake lie made Him to be .sin who knew 110 sin, so that in Him we might
become the righteousness of God." (2 Corinthians 5:19-21)
Jesus Christ is met and known by millions today, as He has been over the cen
turies. These all testify, as did.the Apostle Paul, "For we ourselves were once fool
ish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our
days in malice and envy, hated by men and hating one another; but when the good
ness and loving kidness of God our Saviour appeared, lie saved us. not because
of deeds done in righteousness, but in virtue of His own mercy, by the washing of
regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit which He poured out upon us richly
through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that we might be justified by llis grace and
become heirs in hope of eternal life," (Titus 3:3-7)
Is God speaking to yon about your own needs and spiritual condition? Is God
calling you to Himself, urging you to seek llis forgiveness and love? Those who
received Jesus Christ have been joined to Him in a new and permanent relationship
of love and life. No strings attached, He stands ready to meet you today, if only
you are willing. Won't you let the Lord Jesus Christ be your all in all?
