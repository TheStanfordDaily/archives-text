OUR UNIVERSITY SPORT
JACKETS ARE NOT ODD
Many people do call sport jackeis "odd jackets."
Ours are not. They are the results of information
gathered from many experts—the siaff in our on
campus shops at Yale, Princeton, Harvard, the
University of Michigan, Stanford University and our
stores across the nation. The fabrics — the finest
tweeds, flannels and hopsackings in a wide variety
of colors and patterns —come from the most re
nowned mills of Britain, and the United States. Each
jacket is precisely tailored on our own exclusive
University Shop model and must meet our exacting
standards of quality and perfection. The collection
starts at 45.00 in the University Shop. When you see
these sport jackeis you will know immediately that
they're not odd. Distinctive—but not odd!
