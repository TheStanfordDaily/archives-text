### 
Rixford K. Snyder, Admissions
Director for Stanford and Vice
Chairman of the College En
trance Examination Board,
stressed the need for standard ad
missions operations in American
universities at a recent meeting
of Ihe American Council on Edu
cal ion.
Ho said that the present auto
nomous operations create confu
sion for both officials and candi
dates, a particularly hindering
; situation in I he face of the widely
heralded tidal wave of college
I applicants.
HE CITED seven areas where
common standards are needed:
! common high school and college
transfer credentials, com m on
j standards for the length of high
school work considered in select
ing students, uniform admission
(dosing dates, a uniform reply
| date, standard procedures in han
; tiling multiple application, co-
I operation in handling and select
ing foreign students, and coordi
nation of admission of Negro
' students.
Snyder said, "The entire (pres
ent) procedure is one designed
| to protect ihe college rather than
I the candidate, and thus gives ex
pression to a philosophy which
' I personally abhor, namely that
! the college is more important
J than Ihe candidate. In fact, it
seems to me our philosophy
| should be based upon the position
that the college is bigger than the
candidate and therefore can af
ford to take more chances."
