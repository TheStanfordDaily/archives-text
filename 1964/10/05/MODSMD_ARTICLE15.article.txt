# USF CONTROLS PLAY, BUT...
## Tribe Toemen Tromp USF 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Stu Rawlings and Captain Klas
Bergman each scored two goals
to lead Stanford to a 5-2 romp
over USF, a perennial forerunner
in the Northern California con
ference last Saturday.
Although on the defense

throughout the second and third
quarters, the Indians maintained
the net to rap up the contest.
AT THE ten minute mark, in
the first quarter, Stu Rawlings
compensated for an earlier offen
sive lapse by taking a pass from
Kammel Kadi, and scoring to put
a slim lead going into the fourth

quarter. Stanford then turned the
tide, employing an aggressive off
ense, and rammed two goals into
Stanford ahead, 1-0.
Goaltender Mueller had a fine
quarter, making nine saves, but
an arm injury forced him to the
sidelines for the final three
periods.
USF completely dominated the
second and third quarters, but
was unable to gain the lead. The
fact that sub-goalie Paulson
made 15 saves in the middle two
quarters, while the Green goalie
made only two, indicates how de
cisively USF controlled play.
KLAS BERGMAN gave 1 h e
Cards a two-goal bulge midway
through the second quarter. By
halftime, USF had shaved the
lead to 2-1. The teams traded
goals in the third quarter, a n d
Stanford led 3-2, going into the
fourth and final stanza.
From that point on, the com
plexion of the game took a com
plete reversal. The Red men used
intricate passing and over-all ball
control to keep the play in their
offensive zone.
At the five minute mark, Klas
Bergman raced down the left side
line, squirmed past three defend
ers, and drove a long high shot
into the right corner of the goal.
WITH AN assist from Bianchi,
Stu Rawlings scored the clincher
at 17:25, as USF played a very
dispirited brand of ball.
Center halfback Bob Cox played
an outstanding defensive game,
holding All-American center for
ward Tom Marling scoreless
The defensive star also contrib
uted an assist to the offensive
cause.
Head Coach Friddle effectively
summed up the game when he re
marked, "The boys were deter
mined. and they went out and got
the game themselves."
