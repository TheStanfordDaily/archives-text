### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The Stanford varsity water polo
team defeated the alumni team,
12-9, in a tightly waged contest
last Saturday at the Eneina pool.
The varsity was forced to work
in and around a taut /.one de
fense thrown up by the alumni.
Despite the tightness of the de
fense on both sides, the game
was unmarred by excessive foul
ing. Not one player fouled out of
the contest.
BILL READY scored three
goals to lead the varsity in the
scoring column, while varsity
coach Jim Gaughran played for
the alumni and bagged four goals,
demonstrating the form that took
him to the Olympic Games in
1956.

TIIE VARSITY jumped out to
a convincing 5-1 lead in the first
quarter. Undaunted, the alumni
rebounded with four goals in the
second quarter to leave the half
time score at 7-5 in favor of the
younger Tribe. The teams played
evenly in the third quarter, scor
ing three goals apiece.
The alumni rut the IDS varsity
lead to one point in the middle
of the final quarter, but late quar
ter goals by Jensen and Ready
finally iced the game for the
varsity.
INDIAN GOALIE Mike Sorem,
subbing for the alumni, thwarted
21 varsity scoring attempts. The
alumni made fewer shots, forcing
15 saves on ihe part of the var
sity goalies.
The varsity meets Gal next
Friday.
