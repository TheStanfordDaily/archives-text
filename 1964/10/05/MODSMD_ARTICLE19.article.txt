# The 						Cal Demonstrations
## 
### 
The mob demonstrations at Berkeley last
week evinced a student immaturity and irre
sponsibility that is bound to hurt future ellorts
to change university regulations regarding cam
pus political activity.
The demonstrations began when eight stu
dents were suspended and one ex-student ar
rested for violation of university regulations.
The regulations in question, while allowing
distribution of information advocating a particu
lar view, prohibited students from certain on
campus political activities such as soliciting mem
bership in political parties, collecting funds to
aid activities not authorized by the university,
and "mounting political and social action" such
as sit-ins.
By Friday, as a front-page editorial in the
Daily Californian stated, "the demonstrations
(had) dissolved into a morass of distorted goals,
inconsistent means, and blindness to their falli
bility."
What, we ask. was the purpose of this mass
protest? 11 it was to reverse the suspensions and
the arrest, then the demonstrations were exces
sive. It would be analagous to picket a court
house in protest of a fine for running a stop
sign.
If the purpose of the demonstration was to
change the university rules, then it was doomed
to failure, since the rules merely carry out state
law preventing campus facilities from being used
for partisan action.

in any case, the use of raw force was exactly
tin; wrong means of dealing with the Berkeley
administration, which had done its best to allow
free political activity within the limits of the law.
lint while deploring the extreme action ol
the students and understanding the dilemma
faced by the Cal administrators, we oppose the
regulations in question.
It is essential to any form of meaningful stu
dent involvement iu the crucial political and
social issues of the day that students have the
right to organize free from such restrictions.
How effective, for example, would the Young
Democrats be it they could not mount voter
registration drives or collect money to support
democratic candidates?
The argument most frequently advanced
against complete freedom of political activity is
that a university cannot retain its independence
from partisan groups and cannot remain "above
the raging political battles.
We think that a university should never be
aloof to the point of denying its students full
participation in the political process. As long as
it retains its neutrality as an institution, objec
tivity in the classroom, and an open forum for
dissent and new ideas, a university cannot be
justly identified with a particular cause.
The regulations at Cal (and state Jaw)
should be changed as soon as possible, and if
reason prevails, rather than rioting, they will be.

The regulations at Cal (and state Jaw)
should be changed as soon as possible, and if
reason prevails, rather than rioting, they will be.
The mob demonstrations at Berkeley last
week evinced a student immaturity and irre
sponsibility that is bound to hurt future ellorts
to change university regulations regarding cam
pus political activity.
The demonstrations began when eight stu
dents were suspended and one ex-student ar
rested for violation of university regulations.
The regulations in question, while allowing
distribution of information advocating a particu
lar view, prohibited students from certain on
campus political activities such as soliciting mem
bership in political parties, collecting funds to
aid activities not authorized by the university,
and "mounting political and social action" such
as sit-ins.
By Friday, as a front-page editorial in the
Daily Californian stated, "the demonstrations
(had) dissolved into a morass of distorted goals,
inconsistent means, and blindness to their falli
bility."
What, we ask. was the purpose of this mass
protest? 11 it was to reverse the suspensions and
the arrest, then the demonstrations were exces
sive. It would be analagous to picket a court
house in protest of a fine for running a stop
sign.
If the purpose of the demonstration was to
change the university rules, then it was doomed
to failure, since the rules merely carry out state
law preventing campus facilities from being used
for partisan action.

in any case, the use of raw force was exactly
tin; wrong means of dealing with the Berkeley
administration, which had done its best to allow
free political activity within the limits of the law.
lint while deploring the extreme action ol
the students and understanding the dilemma
faced by the Cal administrators, we oppose the
regulations in question.
It is essential to any form of meaningful stu
dent involvement iu the crucial political and
social issues of the day that students have the
right to organize free from such restrictions.
How effective, for example, would the Young
Democrats be it they could not mount voter
registration drives or collect money to support
democratic candidates?
The argument most frequently advanced
against complete freedom of political activity is
that a university cannot retain its independence
from partisan groups and cannot remain "above
the raging political battles.
We think that a university should never be
aloof to the point of denying its students full
participation in the political process. As long as
it retains its neutrality as an institution, objec
tivity in the classroom, and an open forum for
dissent and new ideas, a university cannot be
justly identified with a particular cause.
