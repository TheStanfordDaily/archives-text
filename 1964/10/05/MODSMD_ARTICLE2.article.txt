THIO FIRST International was
founded Sept. 28, 1864. The goal
ol' this conference, according to
its director. Dr. Milorad Orach
kovilch of Hoover Institution, will
lie to "try to establish a balance
sheet for all revolutionary move
ments claiming Marxist patern
ity, and show how they have
shaped tlie history of the world
and of Marxism."
Thus the participants have been
invited as scholars, not as social
ists. right-wingers, or as politi
cians in egeneral, Drachkovitch
said. The spectrum of ideological
shadings has, however, been cov
ered as well as possible, he said.
According to the general plan
of the conference, historical mat
ters will l)e treated today as back
ground for tomorrow's session,
in which the various "isms"
Leninism. Stalinism, Khrushchev
ism, Maoism, and Titoism —will
be discussed. Wednesday's ses
sion will deal generally with pros
pects for the future, and other
comment.
