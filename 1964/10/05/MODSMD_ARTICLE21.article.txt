## Frosh Dollies Are Lonely 
### 
! Dear Sir:
Due to various forms of mass
media, specifically the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, radio station
KEWB. and your own newspaper,
it has been brought to the atten
tion of several of us freshman
girls that a large number of the
male section of the Stanford
Family is grossly dissatisfied
with its social life at the Univer
j sity.
We interpret this to mean that
j there just don't seem to be enough
girls to go around. From what
we are led to believe, it seems
that the desirable girls are either
already taken, are too busy with
their studies, or just don't have
time to waste on boys.
Fact (1>: it is not uncommon
for 60 per cent of the frosh
dollies at Roble to remain date-
I less on a Friday night.
Fact (2): this percentage de
creases only slightly on a Satur
â€¢ day night.
Fact (3): there is no such
animal as a girl who would

rather spend a Friday evening
alone at the library than be with
a boy.
Fact (4): there is'no such ani
mal as a girl who doesn't have
lime to spend with hoys, let alone
consider it time wasted.
We realize that there are young
lovelies who are bad risks as
dates, i.e., they would rather be
with some other guy, and never i
fail to let you know about it, but ;
wo believe they are the exception
and not the rule. Most of us are
just young innocents who spend :
our lives waiting for some nice
guy to ask us out.
If it isn't evident by now that
your complaint about the social
life lias no real basis, there is no
way we can help you. And if the
young ladies hero aren't to your
liking, it's your own damn fault
for being so conceited!
May we stress that the initia
tive must be taken by you. The
choice is yours. Waste not an
other minute!
Yours,
FROSH DOLLIES
