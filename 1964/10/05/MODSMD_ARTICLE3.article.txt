# Fund Drive Beginning
## 
### 
Thirty thousand dollars has
been set as this year's goal for
the United Fund Drive on cam
pus, which begins today and lasts
through Oct. 16. This amount,
however, concerns only Iho soli
citation of Stanford faculty and
staff, which is the only direct
solicitation permitted on campus
each year, according to Dr. Oliver
Byrd, M.D., executive head of the
Department of Health Education,
who is chairman of the drive.
Last year, the goal was $27.-
000, but a total of $39,500 was
collected and pledged.
A SOLICITOR for each depart
ment will be appointed by the
department's executive head.
Eventually, all of Stanford's ap
proximately 5,200 faculty an d
staff will have been contacted.
The funds from the drive go
to 63 different agencies, includ
ing Community Chest, the Red
Cross, the Salvation Army,
YMCA, etc. Some will eventually
return to the Stanford Medical
Center's Outpatient Clinic.
CONTRIBUTIONS may be on
a cash or a payroll deduction ba
sis.
The United Fund Drive involv
ing undergraduates will begin
later.
