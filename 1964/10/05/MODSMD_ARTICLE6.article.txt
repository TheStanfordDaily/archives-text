# UCLA Nips Tribe, 27-20
## 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
An assiduous Stanford attack
and an improved defense put a!
scare into the UCLA Bruins Sat-j
urday, but by the time the game I
had ended t lie opportunist hosts j
had eased past the Indians, 27-20,'
before 36,000 spectators on the
istrength of Larry Zeno's three
TD passes and scoring plunge.
Blessed by good field position
j throughout most of the contest,
1 1>io Cards continually knocked on
i the door, only to have the defense
!of tiie Bruins rudely greet them
I most of the time. Twice the In
j dians went for broke on fourth
[and goal situations and in both
■ cases ended up within the one
yard line.
IN Till; last minutes of the
game, tho Indians had a good,
Ishot at victory. From the UCLA;

34, Dick Berg took the team to
paydirt in four plays. Behind by
one, 21-20, Ralston sent Terry
DeSylvia in to execute a Ray
Handley sweep around right end
but an errant pitchout made the
two-point conversion attempt no
good.
With 3:22 remaining J. D. Lo
dato attempted an onside kick
which went only five yards. It
took two bounces and then Uclan
guard Barry Leventhal caught it
i?i stride and ran unimpeded to
the Stanford three. UCLA scored
on a Zeno to Altenbcrg pass and
then stymied Stanford's last gasp
of hope with an interception.
UCLA couldn't put tho wraps
on the Tribe's strong running at
tack. Hay Handley put on another
spectacular running display in
setting a personal rushing mark,
gaining 134 yards in 24 carries.
Fullback John Read powered for
(56 yards and two touchdowns.
OUTSTANDING in the line
were linebacker Jack Chappie,
tackle Gary Pettigrew, and Bob
Nichols. Chappie received line
man of the game honors for his
aggressive work stopping up the
middle of the line and hustling
to contain end runs.
Second to last in the AAWU in
passing offense going into the
game, Stanford went to the air
ways and was. for the most part,
successful. DeSylvia executed
roll out plays to perfection and
connected on 17 of 24 passes good

for 211 yards. Many completions!
; kept drives alive by coming on:
crucial third down situations. j
i For receivers, DeSylvia relied j
primarily on flankers Dave Lewis
and Dick Ragsdale and ends Mike
Connelly and John Mason. New
; comer Lewis topped receivers on
both sides with six catches for 82
yards.
BUT PASSING also proved a
nemesis as three interceptions
thwarted the attack at inoppor
i tune moments. One occurred when !
j the Indians were deep in B r u in !
territory, and another ultimately
| led to UCLA's go-ahead touch
down in the second quarter.
Stanford took 11k 1 opening kick
| off and marched 61 yards in 9,
Iplays. From the 35, Read hit the'
I middle for 5 then Handley circled;
J the left end for a couple. DeSyl
via then hit the flanker back'
i twice in the middle of the field to!
! move the ball to the UCLA 27. ;
At this point, Handley and Read '
alternated running chores with!
Read plunging the final three i
yards to put the Indians out in
I front. 7-0, as Braden Beck con-j
verted.
UCLA CAME right back to
i knot the score but Stanford gave!
! ground grudgingly. The big plays j
(were third and long yardage)
passes to Mike Haffner in the
(middle and to Kurt Altenbcrg on !
' tho right sideline.
The scoring play was a three- <

the Stanford secondary playing

THE BALL changed hands sev
eral times as UCLA intercepted
two passes and Rob Nichols re
covered a Zeno fumble. After the
second interception, Zeno moved
the Bruins on the ground, relying
mainly on Paul Horgan.
Stanford's goalline defense
forced a fourth and one at the
one situation on the Bruins, but
Zeno sneaked through a hole in
the line for the score.
The first time Stanford got
the ball, in the second half, Hand
ley ripped off 15 yards, DeSylvia
rolled left ,then hit Mason for 22
yards, and the Indians were on
the enemy fourteen.
FOUR RUNNING plays gave
Stanford a first down on the
three, but a bad pitchout lost
eight. 1-landley and Read recov
ered the lost distance and then
some but Handley was inches
short of the end zone on fourth
down.
Stanford held, and Guillory re
turned UCLA's punt 22 yards to
the Uclan 24. Rolling left and
then throwing up the middle, De-
Sylvia connected with Mason for
19 yards. Read scored up the mid

score at 14-14.
Zeno, throwing to Altenberg
and Ray Armstrong, directed a
drive that ended with a pass into
the left corner to Armstrong for
the winning TD.
AS SOON as Dick Ragsdale in
tercepted a Zeno aerial on 1 h e
Stanford 17, Stanford mounted a
drive that again frustratingly
ended inches short. UCLA was
forced to punt and the stage was
set for Stanford's final TD drive
and the hectic proceedings fol
lowed it.
An assiduous Stanford attack
and an improved defense put a!
scare into the UCLA Bruins Sat-j
urday, but by the time the game I
had ended t lie opportunist hosts j
had eased past the Indians, 27-20,'
before 36,000 spectators on the
istrength of Larry Zeno's three
TD passes and scoring plunge.
Blessed by good field position
j throughout most of the contest,
1 1>io Cards continually knocked on
i the door, only to have the defense
!of tiie Bruins rudely greet them
I most of the time. Twice the In
j dians went for broke on fourth
[and goal situations and in both
■ cases ended up within the one
yard line.
IN Till; last minutes of the
game, tho Indians had a good,
Ishot at victory. From the UCLA;

34, Dick Berg took the team to
paydirt in four plays. Behind by
one, 21-20, Ralston sent Terry
DeSylvia in to execute a Ray
Handley sweep around right end
but an errant pitchout made the
two-point conversion attempt no
good.
With 3:22 remaining J. D. Lo
dato attempted an onside kick
which went only five yards. It
took two bounces and then Uclan
guard Barry Leventhal caught it
i?i stride and ran unimpeded to
the Stanford three. UCLA scored
on a Zeno to Altenbcrg pass and
then stymied Stanford's last gasp
of hope with an interception.
UCLA couldn't put tho wraps
on the Tribe's strong running at
tack. Hay Handley put on another
spectacular running display in
setting a personal rushing mark,
gaining 134 yards in 24 carries.
Fullback John Read powered for
(56 yards and two touchdowns.
OUTSTANDING in the line
were linebacker Jack Chappie,
tackle Gary Pettigrew, and Bob
Nichols. Chappie received line
man of the game honors for his
aggressive work stopping up the
middle of the line and hustling
to contain end runs.
Second to last in the AAWU in
passing offense going into the
game, Stanford went to the air
ways and was. for the most part,
successful. DeSylvia executed
roll out plays to perfection and
connected on 17 of 24 passes good

for 211 yards. Many completions!
; kept drives alive by coming on:
crucial third down situations. j
i For receivers, DeSylvia relied j
primarily on flankers Dave Lewis
and Dick Ragsdale and ends Mike
Connelly and John Mason. New
; comer Lewis topped receivers on
both sides with six catches for 82
yards.
BUT PASSING also proved a
