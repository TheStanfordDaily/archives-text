# FROSH REPORT
## Quality Of Instruction Varies 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE Feature Editor (Second in a Series) 
The base of t ho freshman curriculum at Stan
ford rests very heavily on two key courses. Fresh
man English, and History of Western Civilization.
In fact, these two courses account for approxi
mately half I seven units* of almost every fresh
man's schedule.
IT WAS natural, then, that they should occup>
a very large portion of the academic section in the
Committee on General Studies report of the
freshman year at Stanford.
Since these courses involve most of the fresh
man class, and are of such a nature as to benefit
greatly from being taught in small classes, it is
inevitable that most of the teaching load must be
born by graduate assistants. However, the De
partment of Historj and the English Department
differ considerably in the methods in which Ihe\
utilize these teaching assistants.
Freshman English is administered in conjunc
tion with graduate studies in the English Depart
ment. Teaching assistants in the course and they
account for almost three-fourths of the instructors
are almost always graduate students working
for advanced degrees in English. They receive
a portion of their salaries in the form of tuition
credits, and in the words of the report, it is "not
impossible for them lo be chosen primarily in
consideration of their promise as graduate slu
deids and/or their financial need."

Till; WESTERN Civilization instructors, on the
other hand, are full-time "professional" teachers
holding academic appointments. Many of them
arc Ph.D's and the remainder "all-but-disserta
lion" candidates for the degree.
In any case, freshmen rated both courses very
highly, with large majorities of students report
ing "stimulating and challenging" content, and
"high quality" instruction. Students complained,
however, about the coordination of discussions
with lectures in Western Civ.
.MOST ST I DENTS felt that both courses were
"difficult" although they showed a preference for
the grading system used in the English courses
where written themes account for most of the
grade as opposed to the system used in Western
Civ which weighs papers, examinations, and class
participation together to arrive at a grade.
II was the grading system used in English,
however, which departed more sharply from the
"Stanford Curve." In examining class records
over the las) four years, the Committee found
that considerably fewer than the recommended
l.> per cent "A's" have been issued while "B's"
were passed out at rates well above .33 per cent.
This departure from the "curve" was especially
pronounced in the regular sections of English
where instruction is almost entirely handled by
teaching assistants.
IN CONTRAST, grades handed out in Western
Civilization followed very closely the suggested
distribution and all minor variations worked in
favor of the student.
