The Greatest Life Ever Lived
Jesus of Nazareth was born over ITiO years ago. For hundreds of years the
great prophets of Israel foretold I lis coming. The Old Testament, which was written
hv many individuals oyer a period of 1500 years, contains over 300 references to
Christ* At the age of 30 lie begun Mis niinistry. Space will not allow for detail
except to saj that in the three, years that followed, lie gave man the formula for .i
full and abundant life and for the life to come.
The life Jesus led, the miracles lie performed, the words He spoke, Tfis death
on the Cross, 1 lis resurrection, (lis ascent into heaven, all point to the fact that He
was not mere man. lint more than man, as lit Himself clantud: 'I and my Father
are One" (John 10:30), "He that hath seen me-hath seen the Father" (John 14:9).
Arnold Tovnbec, the eminent historian of our day, has given more space to Jesus
of Nazareth than tn any other six great men who have ever lived combined, includ
ing Mohammed, Buddha, Caesar, Napoleon, George Washington, etc.
The Encyclopedia Britatinjca devotes 20.000 words to Jesus. Men of other lands
and religions who have investigated the evidence will agree that Jesus is the greatest
leader and influence for good of all the centuries.
Tt is significant to consider that 'Jesus claimed to be God. He claimed to be the
author of a new way of life Wherever this message has gone, new life, new hope,
and purpose of living have resulted. Kit her Ji sns of Nazareth was Who He claimed
to be. the Son of God, the Savior of mankind, or He was the greatest imposter the
world has ever known. If His claims were false, a lie has accomplished more good
than the truth ever has!
Regarding the claims of Jesus, Professor Archibald M. Hunter of Aberdeen Uni
versity says: "Then what manner of man is this who knows that by I lis dying He.
will inaugurate this new and blessed order of relations between God and men: No
mortal man makes such a claim, or we know him to be mail. We are driven back
on the wunls of wise old 'Rabbi* Duncan: 'Christ either deceived mankind by con
scious fraud, or lie Himself, was deluded, or lie was divine. There is no getting
out of this trilemma* (Colloquia I'eripatctica)
Because His claims to Deity were alien to the Jewish thought of His day the
impression oMlis contemporaries is important. I'eter -aid. "You are the Christ, the
Son of the living God." (Matthew 16:1«»). Martha said, "Yea. Lord: I.have believed
that thou art the Christ, the Son of God .. ." (John 11: 7). Thomas said, "My
Lord and my God" «John JO-JS). John the Baptist said, "Behold, the Lamb of God
which taketh away the sin of tile world." (John I I'hilin said. "Him of whom
Moses in the law and also tlx- prophets wrote. Jesus of Nazareth" (John 2:45).
Nathaniel "The Son of God, the King of Israel." (John 1:49). The centurion who
with hi- Roman soldiers was assigned to watch over Jesus at the crucifixion, said,
"Truly this was Cod's Son!" (Matthew 27:54 )
Tn fulfillment of prophecy, attested to bv His contemporaries and confirmed by
multitudes through the centuries, Jesus Christ came that you might have an •'abun
dant life." lie came to die on the cross that you need not perish but have everlasting
life. His very own life imparted to you.
Your response to the claims of Jesus Christ will determine your eternal destiny
as well as the quality of life which you live on this earth.
Tn John's Gospel. Chapter 1, verse 12 we have the promise, "But as many as
received Him (Jesus Christ) to them gave He power to become the Sons of God."
To receive Christ involves the commitment of your intellect, yoin emotions and your
will as in a true marriage relationship the husband and wife give themselves to "each
others. Begin this gieat adventure with Christ today, the. adventure for which lie

The Greatest Life Ever Lived
Jesus of Nazareth was born over ITiO years ago. For hundreds of years the
great prophets of Israel foretold I lis coming. The Old Testament, which was written
hv many individuals oyer a period of 1500 years, contains over 300 references to
Christ* At the age of 30 lie begun Mis niinistry. Space will not allow for detail
except to saj that in the three, years that followed, lie gave man the formula for .i
full and abundant life and for the life to come.
The life Jesus led, the miracles lie performed, the words He spoke, Tfis death
on the Cross, 1 lis resurrection, (lis ascent into heaven, all point to the fact that He
was not mere man. lint more than man, as lit Himself clantud: 'I and my Father
are One" (John 10:30), "He that hath seen me-hath seen the Father" (John 14:9).
Arnold Tovnbec, the eminent historian of our day, has given more space to Jesus
of Nazareth than tn any other six great men who have ever lived combined, includ
ing Mohammed, Buddha, Caesar, Napoleon, George Washington, etc.
The Encyclopedia Britatinjca devotes 20.000 words to Jesus. Men of other lands
and religions who have investigated the evidence will agree that Jesus is the greatest
leader and influence for good of all the centuries.
Tt is significant to consider that 'Jesus claimed to be God. He claimed to be the
author of a new way of life Wherever this message has gone, new life, new hope,
and purpose of living have resulted. Kit her Ji sns of Nazareth was Who He claimed
to be. the Son of God, the Savior of mankind, or He was the greatest imposter the
world has ever known. If His claims were false, a lie has accomplished more good
than the truth ever has!
Regarding the claims of Jesus, Professor Archibald M. Hunter of Aberdeen Uni
versity says: "Then what manner of man is this who knows that by I lis dying He.
will inaugurate this new and blessed order of relations between God and men: No
mortal man makes such a claim, or we know him to be mail. We are driven back
on the wunls of wise old 'Rabbi* Duncan: 'Christ either deceived mankind by con
scious fraud, or lie Himself, was deluded, or lie was divine. There is no getting
out of this trilemma* (Colloquia I'eripatctica)
Because His claims to Deity were alien to the Jewish thought of His day the
impression oMlis contemporaries is important. I'eter -aid. "You are the Christ, the
Son of the living God." (Matthew 16:1«»). Martha said, "Yea. Lord: I.have believed
that thou art the Christ, the Son of God .. ." (John 11: 7). Thomas said, "My
Lord and my God" «John JO-JS). John the Baptist said, "Behold, the Lamb of God
which taketh away the sin of tile world." (John I I'hilin said. "Him of whom
Moses in the law and also tlx- prophets wrote. Jesus of Nazareth" (John 2:45).
Nathaniel "The Son of God, the King of Israel." (John 1:49). The centurion who
with hi- Roman soldiers was assigned to watch over Jesus at the crucifixion, said,
"Truly this was Cod's Son!" (Matthew 27:54 )
Tn fulfillment of prophecy, attested to bv His contemporaries and confirmed by
multitudes through the centuries, Jesus Christ came that you might have an •'abun
dant life." lie came to die on the cross that you need not perish but have everlasting
life. His very own life imparted to you.
Your response to the claims of Jesus Christ will determine your eternal destiny
as well as the quality of life which you live on this earth.
Tn John's Gospel. Chapter 1, verse 12 we have the promise, "But as many as
received Him (Jesus Christ) to them gave He power to become the Sons of God."
To receive Christ involves the commitment of your intellect, yoin emotions and your
will as in a true marriage relationship the husband and wife give themselves to "each
others. Begin this gieat adventure with Christ today, the. adventure for which lie
created you.
