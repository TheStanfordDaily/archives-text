Russia Re-Examined
BY
WILLIAM MAN DEL
"I know of no better one-volume description of the Soviet Union in our time.
. . . The major merit of Russia Re-examined is that it combines personal observa
tion with a thorough study of documentary and statistical sources. This proce
dure is most illuminating in Mandel s treatment of schools, religion, the Jews,
mental health, public opinion and the press." —Fred Schuman, Woodrow Wilson
Prof, of Govt., Williams College.
"lively . . . the feel of first-hand experience. . . . The sections on education and
science and the account of formal political structure—including what it is fash
ionable to call 'decision-making'—are excellent. . . . Remarkably fair." Dr.
Stephen Dunn, Inst, of Int l. Rel., U. of Calif.
"extremely stimulating." Arthur Hoppe.
