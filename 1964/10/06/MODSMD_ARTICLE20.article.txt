# Indians Strong In Stats, Need Wins
## 
### 
ALTHOUGH the Stanford foot
ball team was billed this fall as a
defensive squad, it came out of
Saturday night's battle with
UCLA with an enhanced reputa
tion as the Unstoppable Object of
the West. In all, the Stanford
backfield has ground out well
over 700 yards rushing, or more
than 200 yards per game.
Backbone of the Rod attack is
strongman Ray Handley, who has
lugged the football 59 times for
386 yards. His 6.5 yards-per-carry
average is good enough not only
to edge out heralded Junior Cof
fey for the AAWU rushing lead,
but to make him the nation's
leading rusher. Complementing
Hundley's bull-like antics is the
flashy fullback John Read and
flankers Dick Ragsdale and Dave
Lewis.
In addition, the Tribe has de
veloped an aerial attack behind
whispy quarterback Terry DeSyl
via to give added potency and
variety to its attack. Against Ihe
Bruins, DeSylvia went to the air
ways 24 times and successful
on 17 of those attempts, good
for 214 yards.
The combined rushing and pass
ing of the Stanford offensive unit
puts the Red just a shade behind
Southern California's Trojans
for the AAWU lead in total off
ense.
Although not flashy, the Indian
defense has been effective, plac
ing them in the middle of the
conference in that department.

ALTHOUGH the Stanford foot
ball team was billed this fall as a
defensive squad, it came out of
Saturday night's battle with
UCLA with an enhanced reputa
tion as the Unstoppable Object of
the West. In all, the Stanford
backfield has ground out well
over 700 yards rushing, or more
than 200 yards per game.
Backbone of the Rod attack is
strongman Ray Handley, who has
lugged the football 59 times for
386 yards. His 6.5 yards-per-carry
average is good enough not only
to edge out heralded Junior Cof
fey for the AAWU rushing lead,
but to make him the nation's
leading rusher. Complementing
Hundley's bull-like antics is the
flashy fullback John Read and
flankers Dick Ragsdale and Dave
Lewis.
In addition, the Tribe has de
veloped an aerial attack behind
whispy quarterback Terry DeSyl
via to give added potency and
variety to its attack. Against Ihe
Bruins, DeSylvia went to the air
ways 24 times and successful
on 17 of those attempts, good
for 214 yards.
The combined rushing and pass
ing of the Stanford offensive unit
puts the Red just a shade behind
Southern California's Trojans
for the AAWU lead in total off
ense.
Although not flashy, the Indian
defense has been effective, plac
ing them in the middle of the
conference in that department.
