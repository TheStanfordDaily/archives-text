# A
						Critical Look At NSA

### 
The National Student Association, ever since
Stanford re-affiliated with it in 1962, has been
something of a "sacred cow" on campus — at
least among those who know what it is.
Hut an objective look at the organization
eliminates the aura of sanctity and myth sur
rounding it.
It is obvious that NSA, in terms of what
might luive been achieved, has been a failure.
After seventeen years of leadership in the U.S.
student community, NSA is today an organiza
tion facing a crisis, its limited membership de
clining and its opposition growing ever stronger.
NS.Vs relevance to the individual student is
practically nil, as evidenced by the widespread
ignorance of its existence.
NSA's worth to the member school is ques
tionable; as a Stanford student body president
said not long ago, "Most of the NSA stuff (from
the Student Government Information Service)
ends lip in the wastebasket."
And NS.Vs activities on the national an d
international political scene, while numerous
and broad, are based on a fraudulent illusion of
representivity.
Only about eight per cent of all U.S. col
leges and universities are represented at the Na
tional Student Congress, and the resolutions
passed are hurriedly considered, often by a ques
tionable quorum in the late hours. Furthermore,
the delegates are not elected according to their
views on most of the issues under consideration.
Given the failure of the national organization,
one is compelled nevertheless to praise the ac
tivities of the NSA office on campus. The tuto
rials, work projects, seminars, and educational
programs under the direction of the Stanford
NSA coordinator can be of immense value and
ought to be promoted.
But these activities have been developed at
Stanford by Stanford students and owe neither
their origin nor their support to the national
organization.
We believe that the national body has failed
be cause it has tried to do too much. Il lias over
emphasized its international program to the neg
lect ol its members, and now the declining par
ticipation in NSA threatens its effectiveness in
the international arena.

It has over-emphasized the importance ol
the National Student Congress and its stands on
polities, ignoring the fact that the Congress bene
fits only the few who attend and by no means
represents the consensus of the U.S. student com
munity. More and more schools are withdraw
ing in disgust at the political stands and at the
waste of time and money.
If NSA is to reverse the tide, if it is ever to
fulfill what we believe to be the function of a
truly national (and not a limited) student or
ganization—namely, the improvement ol student
welfare, student government, and the educa
tional environment—then NSA will have to de
emphasize its political activities.
The Daily recommends that the Stanford
delegation to the next National Student Con
gress be instructed by LASSU to work (a) to
ward the withdrawal of NSA from the political
sphere (except as its affects the international
program); (b) toward a new emphasis on prob
lems of student welfare and student govern
ment; and (c) toward reforming the structure
of the Congress to decrease the emphasis on leg
islation and increase the amount of informal dis
cussion of mutual problems.
If such reforms are not made, the following
steps should be taken:
• Stanford NSA delegates should be elected
at large on the basis of their political views and
should pay their own way to congresses.
• The money normally used for that pur
pose (about $1,000) should go to supporting
the several projects being undertaken on cam
pus through the NSA coordinator.
• LASSU should reconsider Stanford's affilia
tion with NSA and place the issue before the
student body in a campus wide referendum.
In any ease immediate consideration should
be given to affiliation with the newly formed
Associated Student Governments of the U.S.A.
and Stanford should send an observer to the
first ASGUSA convention in November.
These proposals, we think, offer the basis
for a realistic policy toward an organization
which has too long escaped the critical evalua
tion it deserves.
