# Editor, The Daily
## Hallmark Of 'Lippmanism' 
### 
! Dear Sir:
In his editorial, "Hallmark of
Goldwaterism," which appeared
in The Daily on Monday, Septem
ber 28, Walter Lippmann accused
Senator Barry Goldwater of be
ing "unworldly" and generally un
j realistic. But in order to estab
lisli this unreality, Mr. Lippmann
himself showed a blatant disre
gard for tho facts and the con-
I text of the senator's statements.
Mr. Lippmann began by stating
j that Senator Goldwater's advo
! cacy of a weaker Presidency and
his advocacy of a tougher foreign
I policy are contradictory. I shall
I herewith contradict Mr. Lipp
mann: they are not contradictory.
The power which Senator Gold
| water wishes to reduce is the
power of the federal government
! (including the Presidency) in
state affairs. He does not wish to
reduce the power of the President
to form the nation's foreign pol
icy, nor does he wish to reduce
the power of the President as the
commander-in-chief of the armed
forces. There is, therefore, 110
contradiction. It is true that Sena
; tor Goldwater has promised to
reduce the federal budget, but in
no way would such a reduction
influence the country's foreign
I policy. For several years Senator
I Goldwater has advocated larger
: government spending 011 defense,
j The reductions would be made in
the portion of money spent in
I state affairs, since the federal

1 government's concern in state
I affairs would be reduced.
Mr. Lippmann has been eonfus
| ing Senator Goldwater's domest
tic and foreign policies, which are
in no way related to each other.
Mr. Lippmann continued to say
that President Johnson cannot
possibly be promoting the crime
which Senator Goldwater lias ac
cused him of promoting, because
President Johnson has supported
the civil rights act and sundry
welfare acts. But history shows
that welfare and charity tend to
1 promote laziness, which in turn
! not only promotes crime, but also
brings upon the lazy the con
tempt of those that work. Senator
Goldwater would alleviate the
problem of laziness by doing away
with welfare.
In this respect Mr. Lippmann
accused Senator Goldwater of be
ing cruel. Aside from promoting
crime, laziness, and contempt, the
civil rights and welfare acts have
no value except to win election
votes for Lyndon Baines Johnson.
What could be crueler than a
President (such as Lyndon Baines
Johson) who promotes laziness,
crime, and contempt of those who
"benefit" by the welfare acts,
merely in order to win a few elec
tion votes?
Yes, Mr. Lippmann is a very
i fine propagandist.
