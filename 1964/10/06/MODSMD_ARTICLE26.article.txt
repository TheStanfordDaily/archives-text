# NSA Debate: More Politics Or None?
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Editor (Last article of Series) 
A debate has raged for the past
decade within the National Stu
dent Association about the role
of the organization with respect
to the major political and social
issues of the day.
That debate ended in stalemate
last month at the I,7th National
Student Congress with NSA re
fusing to abandon its pronounce
ments and lobbying in national
politics and refusing to increase
its activism to become the "van
guard of the U.S. student move
ment," as the extreme radicals
at the Congress demanded. But
the debate is likely to go on, since
its resolution is crucial 1o the
future role of NSA.
Atmosphere of Crisis
The debate this year was car
ried on in an atmosphere per
meated with the feeling that this
is a year of crisis for NSA, that
the viability of the organization
is threatened.
NSA is facing a membership
crisis more ominous than any
since its founding in 1917. Today
NSA boasts fewer than 330 mem
bers of the 2,000 colleges an d
universities in the United States.
During the 1963-61 school year,
37 schools, or ten per cent, dis
affiliated. Schools such as An
tioch, Ohio State University,
Northwestern, Indiana Univer
sity, and the University of Texas
have withdrawn in the past few
years.
And according to Steve Rob
bins, newly elected NSA president,
Ihe organization will lose at least
35 members in the coming year.
Part of this loss will be due to
the formation of a new national
student organization last spring,
the Associated Student Oovern
inents of the U.S.A. Pledged to
pass no resolutions al its conven
tions and to maintain a com
pletely non-political stan c e,
ASGUSA emphasizes cooperation
among student governments. II
has attracted over sixty big-name
schools and \\ill hold its first con*
'M illion iii November.

Why Disaffiliation?
The reasons for past disaffilia
tion were al the core of the de
bate on NSA's political role. The
pro-politics faction cited the in
creased role of other student ac
tivist organizations, especially
I in the field of civil rights, as de
tracting from the importance of
! NSA.
According to this view, the As-
I social ion must become more ac
live in order to attract member
j ship. The reason for disaffiliation
; is that NSA does not mean any
thing to the average student, thai
j its programs do not have m u eh
effect on the member campus and
jdo not achieve student involve-j
j rnent.
The anti-politics school claims]
that NSA's participation in poli
tics, and its controversial stands
on issues outside the student's
concern as a student (for ex
ample, NSA sympathized with
the Japanese riots against Eisen
hower in 1960, and calls for the
abolition of the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee) result
in the disaffiliation of those cam
puses who do not agree with
these stands or who do not recog
nize NSA's right to represent
them in such areas.
NSA, so the thinking goes,
should concentrate on academic
reform and on student welfare
and leave politics and civil rights
to those specific activist groups
concerned with them.
International Stands
A weakness in the demands
j for NSA to withdraw completely
I from the political realm lies in
I NSA's participation in the inter
| national student movement, par
ticularly in the International Stu
dent Conference, which is an or
jganization composed of the na
jtional student unions of some 70
countries.
These student unions expect ai
good deal of leadership from the
i U.S. delegations, including stands)
endorsing the efforts of student
I groups in nearly every section of
I the globe. Since student unions in j
other countries are often an un 1

1 portant element in the day-to-day
j politics of the country — as in
jthe overthrow of the Diem re-
Igime in Viet Nam, or in opposing
the apartheid policies of the Union
of South Africa—, it: is difficult
! to draw the line between politics
! and the student in his role as stu
. dent.
Two great debates at the Con
gress serve to illustrate the cur
rent ambivalence over where NSA
should be heading. The first was
over the so-called Columbia Reso
lution, which would have taken
NSA out of issues not directly
affecting students in their aca
jdemie environment. This resolu
tion was proposed by the Colum
bia delegation, which was sent
with specific instructions from its
I student council to do everything
possible to move NSA in this
direction.
The Columbia Resolution
The Columbia delegation made
clear its belief that the student
should be actively concerned with
all vital issues, not just th os e
that, affect him because he is a
student. But the delegation also
felt that a student association
should specialize in those areas
that it alone can deal with —
namely, improving all phases of
education and the student's wel
fare. It was felt that NSA h a d
spread itself so thin, trying to
take stands and action in so many
areas, that it had failed to do any
thing well and had practically ig
nored student services.
The opposition to the Colum
bia Resolution called for total
student involvement, with NSA
at the forefront. They argued that
debate on all political issues was
a vital part of the Congress, and
that only by Ibis means could
interest be aroused on the local
campuses.
This position prevailed, al
i though not by enough to change
I NSA basic policy, which is, ac
cording to the Constitution, to
avoid partisan politics. It was ob
vious that many of the delegates
were interested in political debate.
J and thai, in reality, it was half
(lie "liiii" of the Congress.

Turning Point
The second crucial debate of
the Congress, one that marked
I the turning point in the direction
of the legislation, occurred on
the last day of plenary session.
At about 3:30 in the afternoon, a
resolution entitled "The Student
in the Urban North" was brought
to the floor. The resolution
j pointed out the gross inequali
ties existing in northern cities in
housing and educational oppor
tunities, largely due to de facto
segregation. It urged the member
student governments to involve
themselves in improving
conditions through establishing
tutorial projects for Negroes,
disseminating information to edu
cate the white population for the
purpose of erasing misunder
standing. and opposing any ef
forts (including proposition ID
to repeal fair housing laws. Part
of the declaration called for the
organizing of "unions of unem
ployed," rent strikes, sit-ins, and
school boycotts.
The debate was mostly favor
able to this resolution, with the
only opposing voices being those
of the Columbia delegation, call
! ing for restraint and for defeat
I of legislation not concerned with
j the university and its students.
Stop NSA
At about '1:50, when the plen
ary was about to recess for din
ner, it. became known that some
one was passing out anti-NSA
literature in the back of the hall,
some of which was not marked
with a required disclaimer. In
| eluded in the packet was a news
release announcing the formation
of a national student committee
! whose goal is to get 75 schools
j to withdraw from NSA in the
coming year. The committee, cn
| titled STOP-NSA (Students to
I Oppose Participation in the Na
j tional Student Association' was
1 rumored to have a $15,000 budget
I for (he year. Its organizer, Tom
Charles Huston, is National Vice
I Chairman of Young Americans
for Freedom, and a long-tune
'opponent <it IVS A.

Huston charged in the news
! release that NSA had been "cap- ■
i tured by the radical student left"
! and that the Congress was "spew- j
jing forth extremist policy state- i
I ments which so pollute the main-
I stream of American student j
jthinking that responsible stu
| dents cannot continue to support
or tolerate NSA." Huston pointed j
jto NSA's endorsement of the'
| seating of the Freedom Demo- 1
j cratic Party, its call for organiz- j
j ing migratory workers and its i
I support of student activist groups !
in the South as examples of ex-j
j trcme stands.
Staff Retreat
During the two-hour recess for |
dinner the national staff and offi
cers of NSA as well as some of
I the moderate and conservative
leaders at the Congress decided
that a damper had to be put on
j this type of legislation. The word
j was sent forth, and at the eve
| ning session amendments were
offered (and passed) to the Ur
ban North bill and a later resolu
tion 011 the War on Poverty strik
ing the sections" that asked mem-
I ber schools to organize the poor
and cooperate in various kinds of
| demonstrations.
In arguing for the deletion of!
the more activist sections, offi-i
jeers said that NSA was of limited 1
! funds and scope and therefore j
could not participate actively in!
anti-poverty and antidiscrimina
tion programs. This had been a
key argument of the proponents
of the Columbia proposal.
The move was only a token i
one: much legislation was passed ;
which still delt with affairs other
than purely student issues. But
it demonstrated the fear of the
| leaders of NSA that the stands'
for the Congress would hurt the!
Association on member campuses.
The Congress adjourned with
the moderates in full control, but
no decision had been made as to
what basic NSA policy would be
in the future with regard to poll
