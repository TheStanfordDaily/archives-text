## Course Probe Continues

Most freshmen, either l'rom
interest or under the influence of
the renowned General Studies
program, include in their first
quarter curriculum courses in
mathematics, sciences and/or
languages.
Departments in all three of
these areas invariably offer four
or five unit introductory courses
which are open to and in many
cases conducted almost exclu
sively for freshmen.
Will EE THESE courses have
considerably smaller classes than
the Freshman English or History
or Western Civilization they,
nevcr-t he-less, are large enough
to require extensive use of Teach
ing Assistants.
The General Studies Commit
tee notes, however, in their Fresh
man Report, that the division of
teaching responsibility between
graduate assistants and faculty
members is much more pro
nounced in these areas than in
the two required freshman
courses.
This difference is particularly
notable in the science courses
where graduate students usually
handle only lab sections, leaving
the lectures to full-time faculty
members.
SIGNIFICANTLY, it is in
these courses that the "Stanford
Curve'' is most closely observed.
Results from the six science
courses over the last four years
show that the distribution of
grades comes very close to the
recommended 15-35-313-15 percen

tiles.
The highest grades were given
in the two physics courses, fol
lower! by chemistry, geology,
physical science and biology.
Biology grade distributions were
somewhat skewed to the lower
end of the scale with almost one
fifth of the students receiving
"D's" or "F's."
A similar situation existed in
the beginning math courses where
18 per cent received poor or fail
ing grades.
LANGUAGE courses, on the
other hand, were overbalanced at
the opposite end of the scale. In
particular, class records for Ital
ian, Russian, and Spanish courses
showed a considerable inflation
in the number of honors grades.
The German and F r cnch
courses, however, followed the
suggested curve somewhat more
closely.
Students, p e r h a ps sensing
these figures, rated the mat he
matics courses as the most diffi
cult, followed by the language
and science courses. Faculty
science lecturers were the most

popular teachers, however, fol
lowed at some distance by mathe
matics and language instructors.
STUDENT RATED science lab
instructors highly on "knowl
edge," but reserved some doubts
concerning their enthusiasm and
teaching ability.
The future holds some promise
for incoming classes as grading
trends have been on the upward
swing during the last four years.
The sole exceptions to this trend
are beginning French courses,
and the Physics oO series. Grades
in these two courses have been
gradually dropping.
By the 19H2-63 school year, for
example, only Biology, among
the six science courses, had not
equalled or exceeded the sug
gested distribution of "A's," "B's"
and "C's."
IN MATHEMATICS courses
the same year, overall distribu
tion followed the curve very
closely, although this was partly
the result of higher grades in the
40 series balancing lower ones in
the 10-20 series.

Most freshmen, either l'rom
interest or under the influence of
the renowned General Studies
program, include in their first
quarter curriculum courses in
mathematics, sciences and/or
languages.
Departments in all three of
these areas invariably offer four
or five unit introductory courses
which are open to and in many
cases conducted almost exclu
sively for freshmen.
Will EE THESE courses have
considerably smaller classes than
the Freshman English or History
or Western Civilization they,
nevcr-t he-less, are large enough
to require extensive use of Teach
ing Assistants.
The General Studies Commit
tee notes, however, in their Fresh
man Report, that the division of
teaching responsibility between
graduate assistants and faculty
members is much more pro
nounced in these areas than in
the two required freshman
courses.
This difference is particularly
notable in the science courses
where graduate students usually
handle only lab sections, leaving
the lectures to full-time faculty
members.
SIGNIFICANTLY, it is in
these courses that the "Stanford
Curve'' is most closely observed.
Results from the six science
courses over the last four years
show that the distribution of
grades comes very close to the
recommended 15-35-313-15 percen

tiles.
The highest grades were given
in the two physics courses, fol
lower! by chemistry, geology,
physical science and biology.
Biology grade distributions were
somewhat skewed to the lower
end of the scale with almost one
fifth of the students receiving
"D's" or "F's."
A similar situation existed in
the beginning math courses where
18 per cent received poor or fail
ing grades.
LANGUAGE courses, on the
other hand, were overbalanced at
the opposite end of the scale. In
particular, class records for Ital
ian, Russian, and Spanish courses
showed a considerable inflation
in the number of honors grades.
The German and F r cnch
courses, however, followed the
suggested curve somewhat more
closely.
Students, p e r h a ps sensing
these figures, rated the mat he
matics courses as the most diffi
cult, followed by the language
and science courses. Faculty
science lecturers were the most

popular teachers, however, fol
lowed at some distance by mathe
matics and language instructors.
STUDENT RATED science lab
instructors highly on "knowl
edge," but reserved some doubts
concerning their enthusiasm and
teaching ability.
The future holds some promise
for incoming classes as grading
trends have been on the upward
swing during the last four years.
The sole exceptions to this trend
are beginning French courses,
and the Physics oO series. Grades
in these two courses have been
gradually dropping.
By the 19H2-63 school year, for
example, only Biology, among
the six science courses, had not
equalled or exceeded the sug
gested distribution of "A's," "B's"
and "C's."
IN MATHEMATICS courses

tion followed the curve very
