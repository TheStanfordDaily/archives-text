# Oxford Prof Analyzes Basic Marxist Drives

### MARY K. BECKER 
Marx's total "monism" and
his division of men into "children
of light and children of darkness"
were his two most arresting and
original contributions, Sir Isaiah
Berlin of Oxford University told
a capacity crowd in Memorial
Auditorium last night.
Speaking on the "Impact of
Marxism in the Nineteenth Cen
tury," Berlin said that Marx's doc
trine of one central, discoverable
truth is the basis of his theory's
impact. It afforded "Bible and
leadership," for a proletarian
movement in that it accounted
for the miseries of man and in
cluded them as evidence for the
coming felicitude of man, and at
tached this doctrine to an already
existing army, the proletariat.
A common theory of Marxism,
which Berlin termed "crude,
cosmic utilitarianism," says that
one must see the direction of the
bandwagon of "reality" and get
on, or be run over. This. Berlin
asserted, assumed tlie ability of
man to be impartial and free of
pre-existing values concerning

his environment.
The second new idea, accord
ing to Berlin, centers around the
inability of different classes to
communicate with each other.
The declining class traditionally
refuses—for economic reasons
to bo persuaded by the enlight
ened progressive class. This gives
the latter the moral right ac
cording to Marx—to eliminate
the former. "This doctrine is an
enormous weapon of belief and
propaganda," said Berlin.
Basically, then, Marx's doctrine
is "We or They—not Both," i.e.,
no intellectual or moral compro
mise! from Marxism. This theory,
however, contradicts his tactical
recommendation for a mass party,
party, Berlin said. Size, as well
as the accumulation of vested in
terests, cripples the revolutionary
power of pure Marxism.
Although Marx was a remark
able prophet, Berlin concluded,
he failed in the West because he
didn't recognize the flexibility of
the capitalist system or the force
of nationalism as an independent
movement.
