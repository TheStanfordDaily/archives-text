# Humphrey vs. Hecklers In San Jose
## CAMPAIGN 464 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Vice Presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey spoke
to a rally of 7,000 people yesterday morning at San
j Jose State, but his performance was preceded by a (lis
-1 play of political heckling and demonstrations that illumi
nated the chasm between Barry's Boys and Lyndon's
! Legions oven more clearly than the Minneosta Senator's
1 speech.
It was supposed to be Hubert's day in San Jose, but
as the crowd gathered tor the scheduled 9 a.m. rally, it
became apparent that not everyone had come to cheer
j the Senator. A group of students with Goldwatcr-Millcr
signs clustered around a YAF (Young Americans for
Freedom) standard under a scrub tree 100 feet from
I the speaker's rostrum. The pretty young coed holding
, the YAF sign explained that the placards had been
| handed out at a YAF meeting Sunday for use in this
i "spontaneous demonstration."
Nat all the Goldwater people were in this group and
many of the signs were homemade. One such effort, a
large white placard with a picture of Barry on one side
and the inscription "The Benedict Arnold Society En
dorses Current Spy-Exchange Program" on the other,
was held aloft by a well dressed student who said he had
| come "as would any patriotic American to protest this
The left-wing was sparsely represented, with oul\
!a few signs calling for an "End to the Harassment of
! Cuba" and "Self-determinism for the People's of the
World." And the character assassins of both wings
i strode about with "Pat Brown for Dogcatcher of So-
I bastopol" and "Communism via Fascism with Gold
water" placards. Symbolic of the whole mess was a
1 Goldwater face with a Hitler hairdo and mustaehc

underscored with the plea "Fight Extremism: Call
Cy 4-1600."
The main speaker was late, the crowd became rest
less. One Miss Woodbury, head of the San Jose State
Young Democrats, decided to go ahead and introduce
the 15-odd "dignitaries" on the rostrum. This group in
cluded such diverse personalities as Dr. Russell Lee of
the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, the head of the UAW local
and assorted politicians. To no one's surprise or glee,
these last were called upon to say a few words.
After a few placid offerings, Assemblyman Alquist
observed that "Not all of us are talented enough to
inherit a department store."
"What did LBJ inherit from Baker?" shouted an
irate student from beneath his Miller placard.
"1 know all about Bobby Baker," the Assemblyman
retorted, "just as I know all about Bill Miller's Fell
Company."
Some cheered, others began chanting "We Want
Barry," the majority waited restlessly for Humphrey.
Another Democratic hopeful for an Assembly seat
arose to denounce his opponent (Kiljoy or Kilroy or
something) for voting "against aid to the blind and dis
abled, against medical care for the needy unemployed,
and against minority groups." Few cheered. Barry's
Boys opened up again from under the scrub, a girl in
the rear turned to her escort and said. "I think this is
wonderful; I can't see anything. I should have stayed
in the library."
Finally, tile Candidate arrived -75 minutes late. Miss
Woodbury tried to lead the crowd in a chant of "We
Want Hubert" but the loyalists were matched by the
fioldwaterites. And the watchers in the rear drowned
out both sides with a cry of "Put Down Those Signs"
for the benefit of the numerous placard wavers in Iho
front obstructing the view.

A loile voice from a nearby roof screamed, "1 want j
Nixon."
Down on the platform, State Controller Alan Cran-1
ston was urging the assembled electorate to "keep Pierre j
in Washington where he belongs." Salinger was side- 1
lined with a cold.
At long last the Vice Presidential nominee was in
troduced. No sootier had he finished accepting a key
to the city "and the White House" when a heckler yelled
from the roof, "Socialism in the White House, too,;
Humphrey?"
The nominee, a veteran of many a heckling, quickly
shot back. "Friends, we'll have to bear with this man;
he's afflicted by the vagrancies of high altitude. I hope
we can continue without so much static from the far
right, but, then, they're always so far out that's all
you ever hear from them anvway."
The Goldwatcr people were jilcnt after that, suffer
ing through Humphrey clal.ns that local government
had expanded four times as rapidly as national govern
ment since 1945, that the California aereospace industry |
was built by Federal cooperation with industry and,
labor and that more Federally financed research and '
development was needed. When he began flailing his
arms even more rapidly, deriding the junior Senator
from Arizona for "preaching morality and a return to
ancient virtues while voting against the nuclear test
ban treaty and the civil rights bill, two votes which dis
qualify him from consideration for the Presidency of
this country," the crowd finally came to life with a pro
longed ovation.
Barry's Boys only waved their placards, a few booed,
a little old lady in the back wearing tennis shoes said,
to her husband, "These CJoldvvater people must be des- ;
pa rate." '
