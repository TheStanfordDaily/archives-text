# President Screens Students
## ASSU Committee Begins Sign-ups 
### 
ASSU Presided I Scott Mcßride
announced yesterday that sign-ups
will open today for students inter
ested in serving on Presidential
Advisory Committees.
In accordance with a LASSU
resolution passed last year Mc-
Brido and two members of the
Legislature, to bo chosen at the
first meeting of the year Thurs
day, will act as a screening com
mittee drawing up a list of "not
fewer than two nominees for each
opening" for students on the Pres
idential Committees.
STUDENT representation on
several of the committees was be
gun two years ago and last year
was the center of a bitter contro
versy between former ASSU
President Bud Wedin and the Ad
ministration over a cutback in the
number of students on two of the
committees and in the manner ol
student seleciton.
Ten committees had student
representatives last year: Athle
tics, which advices the President
on both intramural and intercol
legiate athletics; Foreign Visitors
and Students; Public Exercises
which controls all public events
held at the University; Stanford
Today Editorial Advisory, which
advises the professional staff on
editorial policy, suggesting auth
ors and article subjects; and the
Student Affairs and Services
which advices the Dean of Stu
dents and others in matters relat
ing to student life on campus and
to student services.
The final decision on member
ship will be made by President J.
E. Wallace Sterling from the list
of representative students sub
mitted by the ASSU committee.
LAST YEAR'S conflict broke
out when the number of students
on the highly important Commit
tee 011 Public Exercises was cut
from seven to three and that of
the Student Affairs and Services
Committee was cut from five to
three, without any reduction in
faculty representation.
Then in selecting the member
ship of the committees, according
to Dennis Sweeny in a letter to
the Daily, "... the President
went beyond both the slate pro
posed by the ASSU President and
that of the Dean of Students to
find student members for his
committee." Sweeny charged that
the entire method of appointing
members to the committees un
dercut representative student gov
ernment.
However this year Mcßride is
confident that all difficulties have
been overcome and that the stu
dent slate selected by the ASSU
will be the only one used by Presi
dent Sterling in choosing student
representatives to the Commit
tees.
