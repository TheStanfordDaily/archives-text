## Marxism 'Science Of Capitalism' Twentieth Century Impact Analyzed 
### NANCY L. STIFFEN Associate Editor 
Marxism is not the science of
socialism but rather the "Science
of Capitalism," and lias as its
basis certain immutable predic
tions of the course of global liis
! tory.
These were the terms in which
Raymond Aron, noted professor
! of the Ecole Praetique des Hautes
Etudes in Paris, grounded his dis
cussion of Marxism in the 20th
Century in a Tuesday Evening
Series speech last night.
ARON CENTERED his discus
sion around the endeavors of the
20th century "Marxists" to evolve
a tenable and coherent doctrine
. from the often tenuous and in
complete conceptions of Karl
Marx himself.
He suggested that, the continu
ing dilemma of the modern
"Marxist" is the necessity of jus
tifying Marx's initial prediction
I that tho economic circumstances
I of the proletariat would get worse
and worse to the point of some
apocalyptic, revolutionary explo
sion.
In time of depression, as in the
1930'5, the justification seems
possible.
HUT IN THE face of increasing
material well-being and the inter
nal progressive reform, of the
capitalistic system, Marx's as
sumptions become more difficult
I to support : Hence "The greatest
enemy of Marxism is prosperity."
ARON TRACED the shifting
ideological dialogue within "So
cialism"' through five distinct pe
riods: li the period before 19.1-4;
2) the period of the Lenin-Trot
sky split at the Second Interna
tional; 3» the Stalin era (1930 to
19.331 -1) the period of renewed
ideological dialogue under Khru
shchev and 5) the recent Khru
; shchev-Mao schism.
Aron stressed that in the course
of the West's dialogue with Marx
ism. we have unintentionally as
similated certain of its assump
tions—chiefly, an economic view
of history.
"We have perhaps both become
; Marxist," he noted, "and not. per-
I haps in the best sense of that
word.
TIMS TENDANCY is especially
evident in the U.S.'s Dollar Diplo
macy: We think that when they'
have enough goulash they will
think reasonably, by which we
mean they will think like us."
