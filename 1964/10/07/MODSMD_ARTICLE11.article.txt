# Electronic 'Pinball Machine' Aids In Mental Research
## 
### 
Dr. Paul Ekman, a psychology
and research associate in political
science, has announced the com
pletion of nn electronic machine
developed to lest interpersonal
behavior.
The device is remotely similiar
to a pinball machine, but it is de
signed to give two players control
of a single ball. It has been
dubbed "the thinking man's pin
ball," and the players receive
monetary gains or losses.
Male volunteers are needed to
play this newly devised "problem
situation" game, and are urged
to call Lois Swirsky at ext. 1171
or come to the Institute of Poli
tical Studies anytime. "We'll stake
them to the $2 playing fee," said
Dr. Ekman, "and there's a good
chance that some of them can go
home $5 or ยง10 winners."
TWO rLAVERS sit at sepa

rate control panels which govern
the movements of a large ball
bearing on a horizontal glass
panel four feet square.
The players work the ball,
guided by a magnet, toward
colored spots painted on the glass
for example, a yellow marker
touched by the ball means i li a t
player X gains 35c while Y loses
the same amount.
Each player also has a set of
buttons on his control panel
which connects with a lighted
communication panel. This allows
the players to register a wide
variety of offers, counter-offers,
rewards, and punishments, all of
which can produce a wide variety
of information for the researcher.
DR. EKMAN'S preliminary
study and development of the
equipment was underwritten by

a grant from Iho National Insti
tute of Mental Health. The game
took 13 months to develop with
the hoip of a Stanford electronics
I export, Mr. William Nichparenko.
j Dr. Ekman's research assistant
lon this project is Miss Swirsky.

quests that students not hold hill
i parties or similar functions in
the Stanford hills because of the
i "extremely high fire danger in
] that area." Tho traditional area
