# The 						Fearful Spectator
## Can It Be? Is The Daily Favorable To Sterling? 
### Art Fisher 
All Stanford stood aghast! Last
Thursday morning th e palm
fronds quivered from the gasps
of fratmen; coeds poured break
fast coffee past their chins and
onto their laps; dorm dwellers
wandered in a daze, heads shak
ing, momentarily forgetting to
trundle along to fight for a wash
basin. Silence swept the campus.
Unbelieving eyes fixed rigidly on
the endless columns of news
print. The Stanford Daily had
done the unthinkable!
The stalwart guardian of stu
dent freedoms and undergraduate
mythology had violated that most
sacred of all new Stanford tra
ditions: The Daily had printed an
article grudgingly favorable to
Wallace Sterling! Furtive glances
sought an answer to the unan
swerable question. What hallowed
institution would next topple?
The immediate student reac
tion was amazement. Sophomores
and Juniors nurtured on the!
tabasco and kerosene editorial {
formula of Ilene Strelitz, felt ;
deserted and alone at this sudden I
weaning. If you can't believe that j
the Administ ration harbors co- j
vert desires to oppress and bad- j
ger the academic community, 1
what can you believe? What have
we left to cherish, if not these
dreams?
Some Intricate Subversion
On the Union terrace, coffee-cup
philosophers, dressed up like ac
tors for roles in the pageant of
the university, debated the cour
age of the Daily's action. Even as
much as two years ago, what stu
dent would have dared allude,
even obliquely, to greatness in
Stanford's President? When in
the past have students possessed
the temerity to depict Dr. Ster
ling as extremely competent,
much less halfway human? Some
intricate subversion must have
been deployed to make a student
newspaper step so far as to show
respect for the dedication of a
man who has not even gone to
Mississippi. Has bribery pene
trated to the lowest levels, or
worse yet. doubt?
Amidst the crisis, Stanford's
second wall of Administrators
(not to be confused with the in
terior defensive wall of the Big
Indian machine) responded pre
dictably. Schooled in the precepts
of Gradualism, many refused to
believe their eyes. At first sight
of Dr. Sterling's name in the
headlines, administrators began

to emit the clucking sounds sig
nalling an imminent chiding of
the Daily.
As they glaced over the fifty
odd column inches of unmistake
able praise, their eyes latched
customarily to the five inches of
derogatory reference, largely
quoted from national magazines.
One administrator is known to
have lamented the "unfortunate
tone" of the article, coming just
at this period of excellent stu
dent-faculty relations (meaning
the first week of school.)
(jovemmcnt's Function
Soon the initial shock and ex
citement will end, and the article
will enter history as "the Sterling
piece," first as a reference and
then forgotten. Soon only diligent
scholars of old Daily's will know
'it well, but the questions it raised
will haunt and persue our student
loaders. For it is well established
I that the primary function of stu
dent government at Stanford is
j the protection of innocent under
graduates against the civil ravag
lings of the administration. ASSU
I leaders must act as "the con
science of the University," they
! must fight for the right to be
heard, and the right to be fol
lowed implicitly, and the right to
| herd.
Rut what if, indeed, the article
j contains some truth? What if
Wallace Sterling is not an incom
petent reactionary? What if he
really is interested in student wel
fare? What if he's kindly? The
tragic implication is obvious.
Bye-Bye Thirteen Units
Student government at S t a n
; ford University will die. Twenty
year old bureaucrats in glass
walled offices will be thrown out
of work, their thirteen unit pro
grams snatched from them, their
push-button telephones dangling
out of reach. Dejected and help
less, they will return to the
clubby atmosphere of their semi
nars on social thought, to bury
themselves in paperbacks an d
talk over the glorious days of the
revolution, their real work
wrested from them by a trick of
fate.
For what are Stanford student
leaders to do if they cannot ha
rangue the Administration for in
competence, revile them as reac
tionaries, and expose them as in
sensitive, uninvolved fascists?
What have they done until now?
As one, the worms have turned.
