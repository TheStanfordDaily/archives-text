## Abolish AWS; Rid Stanford Of Useless Organization 
### Justin Beck 
Margaret Kahn. the West Coast
Editor of Glamour Magazine,
came to Stanford Tuesday,
brought here by the Associated
Women Students to speak on
some vital issues of interest to
women only.
This burst of activity by th e
AWS leads one to ask, without
intending any slight on Margaret
Kahn or Glamour, "Is the AWS
really necessary?"
ONCE UPON a time, it is said,
there really was a need for an
organization which dealt solely
with the small feminine segment
of the Stanford student body, but
in recent times the AWS has
done very little, and has been
noticed even less.
$1,000 Yearly
lis most important function is
the drafting of women's social
regulations, a task it succeeds in
doing in copious quantities (fif
teen pages at latest count). But is
an AWS which spends approxi
mately $1.000 yearly really neces
sary even for as complex a task
as keeping loopholes out of the
social regs?
The answer to that might be
shown in t he interest which Stan
ford women showed in last
spring's election. Two girls, Ghana

China and Sandra Bergen ran for
President of the organization.
Nobody ran for any other AVVS
post, although one Chirk Sullivan
was elected vice-president with
91 write-in votes.
Apparently the positions of
corresponding secretary and re
porting secretary remain unfilled,
though the threat of AWS being
unable to correspond or even re
spond for lack of a secretary has
no doubt been resolved.
Sonic Other Committees
The AWS does have several
other committees in addition to
their social regulations commit
tee. There is one that works on
women's housing, an immensely j
successful one judging from the
outstanding condition of women's
housing on this campus.
One can visualize that commit
tee running from dorm to dorm
with hammer and nails, trying to
keep the places standing a little
longer.
The AVVS is happiest getting
professional women to speak on
the importance of women in the
world, or words to that effect.
Last year it brought Margaret
Keane to campus, and art stu
dents countered with a special
program of their own, releasing
some rats which caused more ex
citement than the AWS has seen
in many, many years.
Ever-great i'ul I'arents
Last year too, the AWS brought
out a book on social etiquette
which, no doubt, turned shy and
backward Stanford dollies into
the belles of many a fraternity
hill party. Parents in Sioux City,
lowa, and Billings, Montana will
probably be ever grateful to the
AWS for bringing their daughters
out of the cultural wilderness.
The valuable functions that the
AWS does have, and it does have !
some, such as drawing up the
social regs, conducting the an |
nual housing lottery, and choos-;
ing the sponsors, could easily be I
handled without going through !
the imposing but useless hier- j
archy of the AWS board.
The AWS Anomaly
A separate organization sup
posedly representing all the wom
en at Stanford is an anomaly as |
evidenced by the failure of the
AWS to generate any interest in
its programs. Its abolition, at the I
very least, would reduce the num
ber of useless organizations on
campus by one and might save
AWS President Ghana Chiba
from a very frustrating year.
