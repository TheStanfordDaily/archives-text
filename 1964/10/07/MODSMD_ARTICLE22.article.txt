## Fooey On Frosh Dollies! 
### 
Dear Sir:
In reply to the letter from the
"Frosh Dollies" wo should like to
present some points in defense of
masculinity by categorically deny
ing the allegations of the "Doll
ies."
FACT 1: Bearing in mind the
Stanford two-to-one ratio, if six
ty percent of the "Frosh Dollies"
are dateless on a given F r i d a y
night then it follows that 120 per
cent of the Frosh men are in a
similar situation.
FAC T 2: Since the percentage
increases only slightly on Satur
day night, it is logical to assume
that those Frosh men who were
fortunate enough to secure a date
on Friday night were also for
tunate enough to reapportion
their lime Saturday.
FACT 3: "There is no such
animal as a girl who would rather
spend Friday evening alone at i
t lie library than be with a BOY."
This is where we separate the
ME]N' from the boys. . .
We also realize that there are j
young "lovelies?" who are bad
risks as dates seven out of ten ;
as a matter of fact. Through ex-'
perience we have found this isj
the rule rather than the excep-!
tion.
We have taken the initiative,!
but that is all we have taken.;
Mere masculine pride has been J
mistaken for conceit. Further, |
though there has been little or no!
fog recently, we have noticed !
that the "Frosh Dollies" seem to!
have their heads in the clouds.
In closing, we should like to re- j
mind you young innocents who
are spending your lives waiting
for some nice guy to take you I
out—DON'T CALL US. WE'LL 1
CALL YOU! ! !
Yours,
frosh men

Dear Frosh Dollies of Iioble:
Wilbur shares your discontent
with the present degree of social !
exchange between Roble and Wil- i
bur and hopes to help remedy j
the situation.
During pre-reg most frosh men, ;
brainwashed with exaggerated
stories of Stanford's traditionally j
mediocre girls, shouted that there
was little hope for Roble, none
for Branner. This ridiculous night
mare has turned out to be far
from true.
RELATIONS HAVE been bet- |
tered by Thursday and Sunday j
meal exchanges, floral gifts, Wil- i
bur dances, a Branner fireside, j
and Roble cookies. Aside from:
several invasions of girls from
Paly High, Los Altos, and Foot- j
hill, Stanford freshmen have I
dated women mainly from Roble j
and Branner. We are relieved and j
pleased with Stanford women.
Wilbur hopes that Roble and
Branner will continue the intro-1
duction of the frosh women to
men with dances at the women's
dorms as well as at Wilbur.
Sincerely,
WILLIAM D. FRENCH

from true.
RELATIONS HAVE been bet- |
tered by Thursday and Sunday j
meal exchanges, floral gifts, Wil- i
bur dances, a Branner fireside, j
and Roble cookies. Aside from:
several invasions of girls from
Paly High, Los Altos, and Foot- j
hill, Stanford freshmen have I
dated women mainly from Roble j
and Branner. We are relieved and j
pleased with Stanford women.
Wilbur hopes that Roble and
Branner will continue the intro-1
duction of the frosh women to
men with dances at the women's
dorms as well as at Wilbur.

Dear Frosh Dollies and

PALY HIGH GIRLS
Dear Sir:
In reply to the letter from the
"Frosh Dollies" wo should like to
present some points in defense of
masculinity by categorically deny
ing the allegations of the "Doll
ies."
FACT 1: Bearing in mind the
Stanford two-to-one ratio, if six
ty percent of the "Frosh Dollies"
are dateless on a given F r i d a y
night then it follows that 120 per
cent of the Frosh men are in a
similar situation.
FAC T 2: Since the percentage
increases only slightly on Satur
day night, it is logical to assume
that those Frosh men who were
fortunate enough to secure a date
on Friday night were also for
tunate enough to reapportion
their lime Saturday.
FACT 3: "There is no such
animal as a girl who would rather
spend Friday evening alone at i
t lie library than be with a BOY."
This is where we separate the
ME]N' from the boys. . .
We also realize that there are j
young "lovelies?" who are bad
risks as dates seven out of ten ;
as a matter of fact. Through ex-'
perience we have found this isj
the rule rather than the excep-!
tion.
We have taken the initiative,!
but that is all we have taken.;
Mere masculine pride has been J
mistaken for conceit. Further, |
though there has been little or no!
fog recently, we have noticed !
that the "Frosh Dollies" seem to!
have their heads in the clouds.
In closing, we should like to re- j
mind you young innocents who
are spending your lives waiting
for some nice guy to take you I
out—DON'T CALL US. WE'LL 1
CALL YOU! ! !
Yours,

Dear Frosh Dollies of Iioble:

with the present degree of social !
exchange between Roble and Wil- i
bur and hopes to help remedy j
the situation.
During pre-reg most frosh men, ;
brainwashed with exaggerated
stories of Stanford's traditionally j
mediocre girls, shouted that there
was little hope for Roble, none
for Branner. This ridiculous night
mare has turned out to be far
from true.
