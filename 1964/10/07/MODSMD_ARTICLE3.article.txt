# Hoover Guest Hits Dems; Lectures Again Tonight
## 
### JOHN E. BONINE 
Democrat policy may lead to nuclear war and Barry Gold
water is "in no way as impulsive as Harry Truman," said one of
the participants in the Hoover Conference yesterday.
Dr. Gerhart Niemeyer of Notre Dame made the contentions in
an interview with the Stanford Daily. He will speak tonight at

8:00 p.m. in the Large Lounge ofi
Tresidder, sponsored by the Stan
ford Area Young Republicans. j
NIEMEYEK scoffed at the idea

that the Soviets
will be provoked
into war by
forceful U.S. pol
icy.
"One of the
major Commu
nist principles is
that a Commu
nist is not pro
voked. He is not
useful to the
class struggle if
he can be pro-

voked. The Communist is trained j
never to act from emotions."
But he noted that a policy'
"which refuses to weaken the!
Communists, which strengthens!
them during difficulties, which!
makes it appear the Cold War is j
ended," is quite likely to lead to .
war.
"TO THE EXTENT that the
Democrats lead us on the assump-1
tion that the Cold War is over!
they are like the Trojans who ad- j
vised their fellow citizens to take i
in the wooden horse."
Defending Senator Goldwater, j
Niemeyer, a political science pro-;
fessor, asked, "Who was reck

less? Churchill, who advocated
rearmament and opposition to!
Hitler? Or Chamberlain, who
signed the pact of Munich?"
The concept of war by provoca
tion "belongs to the 19th century,"
he said. "The magnitude of war
has caused this change. No one
would now risk war on the spur
of a provocation."
On the other hand, although I
we are not engaged in nuclear |
war. "the assumption that we are
at peace is dangerous," Niemeyer j
contended. Khrushchev's speech
of January 6, 1961, ruled out
i world wars and local wars as in-
I struments of policy, but said that
| the Communists would continue
to use "wars of national libera-
I tion" and "popular uprisings," he
I said.
EXAMPLES of these two types
of war, as cited by Niemeyer, are
I Vietnam, Cuba, Indonesian ag-1
' gression against Malaysia, sub-;
j version in Venezuela, the Congo j
| terrorism, and the recent fall of;
I Zanzibar.
Peaceful coexistence is "Khru
shchcv's method of creating the!
j impression that the Cold War is
lover and thereby dismantling our
resistance to Communism. Their j
j whole policy is studded with one I
j declaration after another that,
: peaceful coexistence does not -
mean the struggle is over."
The United States is purchasing j
"war on the installment plan."!
the professor charged. Although
"containment" netted us little, we
don't even have that any more,
"THE SUPREME objective of I
our policy should be peace," lie
said, "but peace is congenitally i
disturbed by the Communists in
their ideological restlessness.
| Communists who are not power
ful. are not very dangerous, such
as Tito.
"Thus, our long-range objective
must ix' to reduce the power of
Communism to disturb peace in
the world. We have to try to ac
complish this with the least pos
jsible injury to ourselves and
; others."
Niemeyer presented a paper
land lecture to the Conference on
Monday. He is one of Sen. Gold-
I water's principal advisers and
| was recently named to a commit
tee 1 of National Scholars for Gold
water-Miller, on which several
Stanford faculty members are
also serving.
