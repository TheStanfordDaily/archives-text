# HOOVER CONFERENCE
## USSR Planned Cuba Retreat, Stanford Professor Alleges 
### JOHN E. BONINE 
The Soviet retreat in the 1962
Cuban missile crisis was automa
tic and pre-planned, it was re
vealed at yesterday's Hoover Con
ference.
Prof. Jan Triska of the Stan
ford Political Science Department
raised the Cuban Crisis in re
marks on "Khrushehevism" at the
I morning session.
"WHEN THE U.S. got tough,"
I he pointed out, "the USSR backed
1 down. There was an automatic

I coupling mechanism" whereby
| the Soviets had pre-planned their
withdrawal in the event that the
United States should react to the
i introduction of offensive missiles
I into Cuba.
i The Cuban Crisis was one ex
ample of the low risk-taking pro
pensity of the Soviets in high-ten
fsion crises.
Dr. Stefan Possony, director of
t he International Political Studies
I program at Ihe Hoover Institu
tion. said this was verification of
Communist strategic doctrine re
pealed in writings and actions
from time immemorial."
CARRYING the point on, Pos
sony said, "You don't strike for
i an offensive war if you don't have
â–  the capability to get away with
it. When the risk is too high, the
i Communists pursue 'peaceful co-
I existence.'"
Triska also reported on the
i use of an IBM computer in ana
i lyzing Soviet "risk-taking propen
sity." lie said that 29 East-West
I crises from 1915 to 1963 had been

analyzed with the following con
clusions:
The level of Soviet risk-taking
has been low in this period. Be
havior has been cautious, deliber
ate, conservative and rational.
ATTITUDM has been a function
of capability.
The difference between Stalin
and Khrushchev in risk-taking
propensity has been minimal,
Khrushchev is more flamboyant
and imaginative in low-tension
crises, more cautious in high-ten
sion crises.
Prof. Lowenthal of the Free
University of Berlin offered his
.judgment that in the period 1957-
62 Khrushchev was more a risk
taker than Stalin.
