# TAIL WAGS DOG
## T. A. System Unbalanced

"ln short, the tail threatens to wag llie dog."
So the General Studies Committee Report
characterizes the present relationship between
graduate support and freshman instruction.
IN THE LAST few years, support of graduate
study through teaching assistanceships has in
; creased to the point where it now almost com
pletely overshadows the T.A. system's primary
goal of providing high-quality freshman instruc
tion, the Committee reports. Too many depart-
I merits appoint student instructors chiefly on the
! basis of financial need.
The Freshman report provides an impressive
array of facts to substantiate these assertions.
In the English Department, for example, in
1962-63, SS per cent of the teaching load in the
regular Freshman English course was turned
over to 37 teaching assistants, 24 of whom had
no previous experience in teaching the course.
Class records show that the variation of grades
among sections in regular English over the past
four years, has been the greatest of any fresh
man course.
A SIMII.AK situation exists in the two lan
guage departments, where almost two-thirds of
the first year language courses and 59 per cenl
of the second-year courses are taught by gradu
ate assistants. More than 50 per cent of these
instructors have never taught before at Stanford.
In the mathematics and science departments
many of the outstanding graduate students arc
awarded fellowships or research grants. It is
[thus possible, in the judgment of the General
Studies Committee, for leach in:.! assisianceshins

in these departments to he awarded to students
who lack "basic qualifications" for the job.
The report notes, however, that graduate in
structors are not necessarily poor instructors.
FOli EXAMPLE in the math "40" and physics
"50" scries, where teaching assistants handle
only discussion and lab sections with regular fac
ulty members giving the lectures results have
been "quite favorable."
The Committee concluded in general, that the
T.A. system has been most successful when it is
combined with faculty supervision and participa
tion.
The quality of instruction has been poorest
when classes are turned over to first-year gradu
ate students or students with no previous teach
ing experience, as happened in first-year French
where 288 students under eight new teaching
assistants compiled a 2.3.1 average with 21 "F's"
while ihe remaining 409 students registered a
2.48 with only 12 "F's."
The Committee is very complimentary of the
system used in the history of western civilization
course where qualified instructors who have com
pleted their graduate studies are hired full-time
for a maximum of three years.
However, adoption of this plan by all depart
ments is not recommended by the committee, as
"the (resulting) great increase in University ex
penditure for graduate support, which this would
entail, is impractical and undesirable."
Instead the Committee recommends moving as
rapidly as possible toward a better balance be
tween teaching assistants and regular faculty in
all areas and increased collaboration and supervi
sion on the part of the regular faculty as major
steps in improving Ihe quality of freshman instrue-
"ln short, the tail threatens to wag llie dog."

in these departments to he awarded to students
who lack "basic qualifications" for the job.
The report notes, however, that graduate in
structors are not necessarily poor instructors.
FOli EXAMPLE in the math "40" and physics
"50" scries, where teaching assistants handle
only discussion and lab sections with regular fac
ulty members giving the lectures results have
been "quite favorable."
The Committee concluded in general, that the
T.A. system has been most successful when it is
combined with faculty supervision and participa
tion.
The quality of instruction has been poorest
when classes are turned over to first-year gradu
ate students or students with no previous teach
ing experience, as happened in first-year French
where 288 students under eight new teaching
assistants compiled a 2.3.1 average with 21 "F's"
while ihe remaining 409 students registered a
2.48 with only 12 "F's."
The Committee is very complimentary of the
system used in the history of western civilization
course where qualified instructors who have com
pleted their graduate studies are hired full-time
for a maximum of three years.
However, adoption of this plan by all depart
ments is not recommended by the committee, as
"the (resulting) great increase in University ex
penditure for graduate support, which this would
entail, is impractical and undesirable."
Instead the Committee recommends moving as
rapidly as possible toward a better balance be
tween teaching assistants and regular faculty in
all areas and increased collaboration and supervi
sion on the part of the regular faculty as major
steps in improving Ihe quality of freshman instrue-
"ln short, the tail threatens to wag llie dog."
So the General Studies Committee Report
characterizes the present relationship between
graduate support and freshman instruction.
IN THE LAST few years, support of graduate
study through teaching assistanceships has in
; creased to the point where it now almost com
pletely overshadows the T.A. system's primary
goal of providing high-quality freshman instruc
tion, the Committee reports. Too many depart-
I merits appoint student instructors chiefly on the
! basis of financial need.
The Freshman report provides an impressive
array of facts to substantiate these assertions.
In the English Department, for example, in
1962-63, SS per cent of the teaching load in the
regular Freshman English course was turned
over to 37 teaching assistants, 24 of whom had
no previous experience in teaching the course.
Class records show that the variation of grades
among sections in regular English over the past
four years, has been the greatest of any fresh
man course.
A SIMII.AK situation exists in the two lan
guage departments, where almost two-thirds of
the first year language courses and 59 per cenl
of the second-year courses are taught by gradu
ate assistants. More than 50 per cent of these
instructors have never taught before at Stanford.
