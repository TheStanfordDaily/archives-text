"what can
my job be
at IBM?"
In IBM Data Processing, your job can be full of variety.
Especially when you consider all the ways computers are
used.
As an IBM Data Processing Systems Engineer, you would
be helping customers get the most from their computers.
They could be customers in science, government, educa
tion, defense, industry, or business. You might even spe
cialize in one field.
Or, as an IBM Data Processing Representative, you would
present to customer executives your ideas for doing their
work better with computers. Your own imagination and
initiative are the limits of what you can accomplish in
marketing IBM products.
If you are working toward a degree—in Liberal Arts, Engi
neering, the Sciences, or Business Administration—find
out what IBM can offer you in the way of achievement.
Thorough training at special IBM schoolswill prepare you
for work in either Systems Engineering or Marketing.
See your college placement officer for literature on these
careers—and make an appointment with our inter
viewers. IBM is an Equal Opportunity Employer.
