Jesus claimed to be God and for this very claim ITe was crucified in fulfillment
of prophecy given hundreds of years before He was born. He said. "I am the Way,
the Truth, and the Life; no one comes to the Father except through me" (John 14:o).
\\ bile on trial before the crucifixion the high priest asked Jesus, "Are you the Christ,
the Messiah, the Annointcd One. the Son of the Blessed?" Jesus said. "I am." Where
upon the high priest tore His garments and said. '"You have heard this blasphemy.
What js your decision?" (Mark I<i:M)-(>s). After His resurrection Jesus appeared
to the eleven disciples and they fell down and worshipped Him. lie said to them,
"All authority, .ill power of rule in heaven and on earth has been given to Me. Co
and make discipli s of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, and of the Holy Spirit . . . and low, I am with you constantly until the
end of the age." (Matthew 28:17-20)
Humility has always been a cardinal virtue in the lives of great men. Too, good
men always have a sense of their unworthincss. Could it be that Jesus was an ego
maniac? Was lie deluded or was He actually God. His claim to lit God, and the
prophecies about His life, death and resurrection arc facts which you can verify foi
yourself. Above all elsi you can meet and know this same Jesus Christ and have
all doubts disappear about Who lie really is.
