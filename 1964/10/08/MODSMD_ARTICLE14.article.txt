# Freedman: Pressure Is 'Devastating'
## 
### 
America's hard-headed, no-non
sense approach lo higher educa
tion today leaves liltle lime for
discoveries like Newton's and lit
tle room for mediocre students
like Winslon Churchill, Adlai Ste
! venson, or John Kennedy men
J who were to go a long way bul
showed few promising signs in
'their student years.
So says Mervin B. Freedman,
recently named assistant dean of
undergraduate education al Stan
ford. Dean Freedman devotes
much lime to studies of such
areas as curriculum, housing,
and student development.
IN THE ARTICLE that appeared
| peared in the Journal ol' the
American Association of Univer
sity W omen, he goes on to point
oul that the stepped-up pressures
for more work and better grades
have had "devastating" effects
, on today's college students. "With
| each passing year, college stu
dents seem more like Israelites
groaning under the Egyptian's
last — humorless, leisureless,
guilt-ridden drudges . . .
"Competition among students,
moreover, is intensified every
year by admitting a class that is
somewhat better than the previ
ous one — better, that is, by such
criteria a s secondary school
grades or college board scores."
Students have accepted a "slave
mentality" and are uncomfortable
unless they are working hard or
even being overworked, concludes
the article.
SIMILAR STUDIES of the
Stanford campus, such as a pro
posed study of the effects of sec
tioning in Western Civilization
classes, will provide the assistant
dean with data which will indi
cate areas in need of improve
ment.
A former research associate in
the Stanford Institute for the
Study of Human Problems, Freed
man was at one time chief psy
chologist at the Kaiser Founda
tion Hospital in Oakland.
Aside from doing research on
various aspects of campus life,
Dean Freedman will serve this
year as a faculty participant in
the newly-established seminar on
undergraduate education. He is
also in the process of arranging
the Jake Gimbel Sex Lectures,
scheduled for the beginning of
Winter quarter.
