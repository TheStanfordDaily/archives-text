# STANFORD'S 'JEWEL FUND'
## 
### 
The establishment of the li
brary at Stanford was made pos
sible by the $450,000 "Jewel
Fund" established by Mrs. Leland
Stanford in her will. Mrs. Stan
ford was willing to sell even her
personal jewels to keep the Uni
versity from closing in a time
when financial advisers were
counselling her to give up. She
requested that her jewels be sold
after her death, the proceeds to be
used exclusively for buying books
and other publications.
