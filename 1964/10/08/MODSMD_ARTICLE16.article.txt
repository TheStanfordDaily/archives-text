### 
Stanford Museum will reopen
today after some of the most ex
tensive renovation work in its
73-year history by featuring an
exhibition, "Current Painting and
Sculpture of tlie Bay Area."
The reopening, which will be
highlighted by an op en house |
with refreshments for all students I

from 3 to 5 p.m., will reveal new
lighting and ventilation systems,
8,500 square feet of carpeting,
specially designed case work and
paint throughout four galleries.
"SIMPLICITY AND elegance,
quiet and light â€” these we hope
to bring to the Museum," accord
ing to University Art Depart
ment Head Lorenz Eitner, who
further remarked that the furn
ishings and wall colors had been
particularly chosen to comple
ment the institution's works of
art.
The "Bay Area" exhibit will
contain approximately eighty
paintings and sculpture pieces by
local artists including Stanford
faculty members Keith Boyle and
Nathan Oliveira.
Stanford Museum was opened
in 1891 by Mrs. Leland Stanford,
who supervised its building as a
memorial to the collection of her
son Leland Junior, whose death
in 1884 occasioned the founding
of the University.
DURING HIS sixteen years
Leland Junior had been acutely
interested in antique art works
and had traveled throughout the
world in search of new and differ
ent pieces to add to his personal
collection.

Young Stanford's tutor H. C.
Nash wrote of him, "Leland had
acquired not only taste and judg
ment, but also a knowledge of
many of the techniques of art.
that made his criticism always
shrewd and generally very cor
rect ... he had an amount of
taste and .judgment unusual for
one so young."
The museum's rejuvenation
will continue with work proceed
ing on two large downstairs gal
leries which are due for opening
later this year. However, the
nostalgic and familiar rooms con
taining the Stanford Family Col
lections will remain as they are,
according to acting director John
LaPlante.
"VVe hope that the general ef
fect of the new galleries will be
one of restraint and restful
beauty. Spacious, light-filled, sim
ply furnished," commented Art
Head Eitner on the overall pur
pose of the renovation.
Co-operating in organization of
the contemporary art exhibit for
one of the oldest museums on the
West Coast are Mrs. Joanna Mag
loff of Art News, Paul Mills of
the Oakland Art Museum, Mrs.
Francis V. Keesling, Jr. and Dr.
William Fielder, both members
of the Committee for Art at
Stanford.
