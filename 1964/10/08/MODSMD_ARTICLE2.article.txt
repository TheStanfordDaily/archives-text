# Professors Differ On Castroism
## Castro's Early Beliefs Debated 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Whether or not Fidel Castro
w as a member of the Commu
nist Parly—or even a believer
in communist hlcolo^v—before
he came to power was the main
point of contention between The
odore Draper of the Hoover In
stitute and Hermino Portell-Vila,
professor of philosophy ;it I h e
University of Havana, 1939-1960,
in I he first session of the Hoover
Conference yesterday.
Draper held that "Castro gave
communism total power in Cuba
and communism gave Castro an
ideology of total power. . . . His
ideology has never come out of
himself. He has only produced a
'road to power' which has at
tached itself to different ideol
ogies. He won power with one
ideology and has held it with an
other."
Til 10 ONLY constant in the Cas
troite equation, Draper suggest
ed. is the use of violence and
armed revolt. Yet while he strug
gled for power in the years 1953-
."58, his statements were not ex
tremely radical. Castro hypocrit
ically signed democratic procla
mations "not because he believed
in something else profoundly but
because he believed in nothing
profoundly."
Only in 19(50 did the fusion of
Castroites and communists take
place, yet t his alliance is by no
means complete or final. Draper
concluded. "No one can forcast
what will happen to this 'cross
fertilization' of Latin revolution
ary zeal and European commu
nism."
Portell-Vila agreed that Castro
was -and still is a foe of the
Old Guard of the Party, but he
contended that Castro was ideol
ogically committed to communisiYi
as far back as 1917, when Portell-
Vila knew him as a student who
flunked one of his courses. "When
he entered the University, he was
prepared to be a right wing lead
er, but he saw there was no fu
ture in it." Portell-Vila then de
scribed how Castro, under the
tutelage of two Russian-trained
"mentors" now the heads of
tin 1 movie industry and the school
system in Cuba became a com
munist and joined the moderate
non-communist opposition party
solely to subvert it.
However, he was subverting it
for his own uses, not for the Old
Guard. Thus, these communists
were not overjoyed when Castro
came to power, Portell-Vila con
cluded, and they have been fight
ing among themselves ever since.

profoundly."
Only in 19(50 did the fusion of
Castroites and communists take
place, yet t his alliance is by no
means complete or final. Draper
concluded. "No one can forcast
what will happen to this 'cross
fertilization' of Latin revolution
ary zeal and European commu
nism."
Portell-Vila agreed that Castro
was -and still is a foe of the
Old Guard of the Party, but he
contended that Castro was ideol
ogically committed to communisiYi
as far back as 1917, when Portell-
Vila knew him as a student who
flunked one of his courses. "When
he entered the University, he was
prepared to be a right wing lead
er, but he saw there was no fu
ture in it." Portell-Vila then de
scribed how Castro, under the
tutelage of two Russian-trained
"mentors" now the heads of
tin 1 movie industry and the school
system in Cuba became a com
munist and joined the moderate
non-communist opposition party
solely to subvert it.
However, he was subverting it
for his own uses, not for the Old
Guard. Thus, these communists
were not overjoyed when Castro
came to power, Portell-Vila con
cluded, and they have been fight
ing among themselves ever since.
Whether or not Fidel Castro
w as a member of the Commu
nist Parly—or even a believer
in communist hlcolo^v—before
he came to power was the main
point of contention between The
odore Draper of the Hoover In
stitute and Hermino Portell-Vila,
professor of philosophy ;it I h e
University of Havana, 1939-1960,
in I he first session of the Hoover
Conference yesterday.
Draper held that "Castro gave
communism total power in Cuba
and communism gave Castro an
ideology of total power. . . . His
ideology has never come out of
himself. He has only produced a
'road to power' which has at
tached itself to different ideol
ogies. He won power with one
ideology and has held it with an
other."
Til 10 ONLY constant in the Cas
troite equation, Draper suggest
ed. is the use of violence and
armed revolt. Yet while he strug
gled for power in the years 1953-
."58, his statements were not ex
tremely radical. Castro hypocrit
ically signed democratic procla
mations "not because he believed
in something else profoundly but
because he believed in nothing
profoundly."
