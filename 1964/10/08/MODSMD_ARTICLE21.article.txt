# Frosh Open Season Against San Jose
## 
### HUGH WEST 
"John Ralston of Stanford is
j that football rarity, a coach who
' loves to recruit." If Sports IHus
, trated's words can be believed,
I then Ralston's past year was a
savory one for him, as one look
at this year's freshman team will
1 reveal.
Although Head Frosh Coach
j Lynn hedges a little and says he
, will not know "until the season
is over" how this year's squad
will stack up against previous
;Liille Indian contingents, he ad
; mils that "on paper, we have one
; of our best," and "we have some
fine varsity prospects."
STRONG SPOT at the moment
appears to the Tribe's vast reser
voir of beefy linemen. End Blaine
Nye (6'5", 240), Tackle Don
Swart/ (6'3", 215), Bob Bittner
i Ui'2", 210), Tim Wilson <6'5",
. 220), and John Becknell (6'4",
235), provide a formidable and
aggressive front wall.
Coach Lynn has a heavy de
! termined line and plans to gel
maximum use of its power by
working off the I Formation. Top
prospect presently as the master
| mind of the power I is Quarter
! back Dave Nelson, a native of
; Minnesota. A pre-med student,
Nelson appears to have the savvy
to direct an intelligent attack.
| Calm and cool-headed, he is a
! good passer ,and a deft ball-han
; dler.
LYNN is quick to point out that
! the lanky Minnesotan does not
have the job sewed up. Mike
| Recek and Frank Duffy, both top*
' notch signal-callers, are hot on
j his tail.
Since the Frosh football pro
! gram is designed basically as a
"boot camp" for the varsity, the

coaches are stressing fundamen
tals, and therefore there are no
specialists on the team. "We are
looking for the whole football
player," says Coach Lynn, and
he stresses that everyone will
play both ways. He plans a bal
anced attack, with equal time de
voted to running and passing.
THE COACH, although opti
mistic, sees some problems facing
the Red in this Saturday's con
test with San Jose State. Most
pressing will be Iho difficulty of
getting all the outstanding indi
viduals on the squad to work to
gether as a unit. They represent
all parts of the country and all
brands of football and have
worked together only a short
time. San Jose has been practic
ing two weeks longer than Stan
ford, and it, too, has one of its
best freshmen outfits.
Making up for the lack of pre
cision in this initial outing, how
ever, is the drive and spirit of
this particular team. Says Lynn:
"We have a bunch of boys who
really like to play football."

pressing will be Iho difficulty of
getting all the outstanding indi
viduals on the squad to work to
gether as a unit. They represent
all parts of the country and all
brands of football and have
worked together only a short
time. San Jose has been practic
ing two weeks longer than Stan
ford, and it, too, has one of its
best freshmen outfits.
Making up for the lack of pre
cision in this initial outing, how
ever, is the drive and spirit of
this particular team. Says Lynn:
"We have a bunch of boys who
really like to play football."
"John Ralston of Stanford is
j that football rarity, a coach who
' loves to recruit." If Sports IHus
, trated's words can be believed,
I then Ralston's past year was a
savory one for him, as one look
at this year's freshman team will
1 reveal.
Although Head Frosh Coach
j Lynn hedges a little and says he
, will not know "until the season
is over" how this year's squad
will stack up against previous
;Liille Indian contingents, he ad
; mils that "on paper, we have one
; of our best," and "we have some
fine varsity prospects."
STRONG SPOT at the moment
appears to the Tribe's vast reser
voir of beefy linemen. End Blaine
Nye (6'5", 240), Tackle Don
Swart/ (6'3", 215), Bob Bittner
i Ui'2", 210), Tim Wilson <6'5",
. 220), and John Becknell (6'4",
235), provide a formidable and
aggressive front wall.
Coach Lynn has a heavy de
! termined line and plans to gel
maximum use of its power by
working off the I Formation. Top
prospect presently as the master
| mind of the power I is Quarter
! back Dave Nelson, a native of
; Minnesota. A pre-med student,
Nelson appears to have the savvy
to direct an intelligent attack.
| Calm and cool-headed, he is a
! good passer ,and a deft ball-han
; dler.
LYNN is quick to point out that
! the lanky Minnesotan does not
have the job sewed up. Mike
| Recek and Frank Duffy, both top*
' notch signal-callers, are hot on
j his tail.
Since the Frosh football pro
! gram is designed basically as a
"boot camp" for the varsity, the

coaches are stressing fundamen
tals, and therefore there are no
specialists on the team. "We are
looking for the whole football
player," says Coach Lynn, and
he stresses that everyone will
play both ways. He plans a bal
anced attack, with equal time de
voted to running and passing.
THE COACH, although opti
mistic, sees some problems facing
