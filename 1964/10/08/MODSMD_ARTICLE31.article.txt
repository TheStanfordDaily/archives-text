# An Opportunity

### 
Stanford students are again being offered an
opportunity open to students of few universities,
the chance to participate in the formation of
Uni\ ersity policy.
It was only two years ago that student repre
sentation on such key policy-making boards as
the Public Exercises, Student Affairs and Ser
vices, and Athletic committees was introduced
on an experimental basis.
This is the first year since such representa
tion began that student body leaders and the
administration have not been acutely suspicious
of one other or at odds over some alleged in
fringement of student freedoms.
With the aura of good will presently in evi
dence. there would seem to be no insurmount
able obstacle in the way of a valuable student
contribution and close cooperation in the inter
ests of all concerned.
But student effectiveness, and with it the

whole future of student representation on ad
ministrative committees, is contingent on two!
important developments:
• That those competing for the posts he high
caliber students w ho can wade through the many
mundane and trivial problems considered by
these committees and still contribute meaning
fully to discussions of the basic philosophy be
hind the more important policy decisions.
• That the list submitted to President Ster- j
ling by ASSU President Scott Mcßridc be repre
sentative and fair to all student political factions:
and that it be free of any taint of "establishment
such as accompanied the list submitted last year
by ASSU President Hud W'edin.
Only if the student body government can pro-'
vide articulate and capable representatives and
can raise itself, in the interest of long-range goals,
above petty politics and in-group favoritism —
only then can it hope to gain or deserve the I
respect of the administration it seeks to advise.!
