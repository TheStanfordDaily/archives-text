## Charity Not Cause Of Laziness 
### 
Dear Sir:
In his letter criticizing 'Lipp
mannism.' which appeared in the
Daily on Tuesday, October <S, Mr.
Paine accused Mr. Lippmann of
being a propagandist, albeit a
line one. Furthermore, he as
serted that Lippmann showed a
"blatant disregard for the facts."
It is my contention that Mr. Paine
is guilty of these very same de
fects, but he is not a "fine" propa
gandist.
My main concern is with Mr.
Paine's remarks about civil rights
and welfare legislation. He agrees
with Senator Goldwater that
President Johnson is playing poli
tics with civil rights and wel
fare. But he goes even farther. He
asserts that "history shows that
welfare and charity tend to pro
mote laziness, which in turn, not
only promotes crime, but also
brings upon the lazy the contempt
of those that work."
AS A HUMAN being I am ap
palled, as a historian I am
offended. Mr. Paine's statement is
a bold assertion for which he
offers no historical proof or sta
tistical evidence. Hopefully, char
ity is still one of the Christian
virtues. Surely, Mr. Paine can
take a lesson from European
conservatives who have accepted
welfare legislation since the 19th
century. In spite of this, Western
Europe is experiencing an un
paralleled economic boom.
While it is true that some in
dividuals utilize charity and wel
fare measures as an excuse for
laziness, should wc punish the ma
jority who do not? Are the people
who cannot find a job because
the economy cannot provide jobs
for ."5 per cent of the labor force
to be denied welfare aid because
they are lazy? Would Mr. Paine
tell the people who lose their jobs
because of automation that they
are lazy when they have not been
provided with job retraining. In
a complex modern industrial
economy such a policy can only
lead to internal chaos. Even Sena
tor Goldwater has argued that he
would strengthen social security,
argues that "aside from promot-
FERTH EKMORE, Mr. Paine

ing crime, laziness and contempt,
the civil rights and welfare acts
have no value except to win elec
toral votes for Lyndon Johnson."
It is a sari comment on flit 1 values
of our society if the civil rights
act has no value except political
expediency. The civil rights act
embodies moral principles 112 or
which church and civic leaders
have joined to protect. If Mr.
Paine would like to see "freedom"
victorious let him start at home
by guaranteeing constitutional
rights to those who have been
denied them. Moreover, is Sena
tor Goldwater also playing poli
tics when he said he would en
force the civil rights act.
Mr. Paine's contention that civil
rights and welfare measures have
promoted crime is another bold
assertion. Once again he offers
no evidence. Moreover, how would
Mr. Paine explain the increase
in crime and dope-addiction of
th e upper-middle and middle
classes of the suburbs? Senator
Goldwater's attempt to stigma
tize the Democrats and "liberals"
for "crime-producing" welfare
measures is as fallacious as the
attempts to blame Herbert Hoover
for the Depression.
IN" EACH CASE, only a dis
tortion of the facts can link the
phenomena involved in a causal
relationship, Moreover, such tac
tics have their parallel in recent
history when Hitler conveniently
utilized a scapegoat to explain
Germany's internal problems in
order to win mass support.
Far from causing crime and
laziness, civil rights and welfare
legislation will alleviate these so
cial ills by restoring to the de
pressed person or group a sense
of his own dignity and the eco
nomic opportunity to rise above
his depressed condition.

Dear Sir:
I write regarding your "criti
cal look at NSA." As a delegate
to previous NSA Congresses and

a former regional officer, I have
some first-hand knowledge of
NSA. In general I feel that your
(interpretation and suggestions
i were fair, but in two cases you
j are wrong.
First, you suggest that NSA
limit itself to consideration of in
ternational issues alone; you
| seem to forget that foreign aid
j affects domestic taxes and that
i war or peace affects individual
i prosperity all d security. The
Founding Fathers may have
: wish'ed for a similar separation,
i giving foreign affairs substan
tially to the president and do
mestic affairs to Congress. But
our history and the complicated
interrelations of the Washington
! decision-making apparatus prove
j that this separation is impracti
cable.
SECOND, you would have NSA
delegates pay their own expenses.
The yearly Congresses have al
ways been east of St. Louis be
cause most member schools, in
deed most large American schools,
are east of St. Louis. Thus travel
ling expenses are near $200, and
another $100 must be added for
room and board and registration
for two weeks. And this makes
no account for salary lost for
summer work. Surely you do not
believe that only the wealthy
should be represented.
Apart from finances, delegates
should he aided with expenses be
cause they are serving their
school. They can gain both ex
perience and knowledge which
is of help to their student govern
ments. UCLA makes the practice
of choosing delegates from the
academic departments and re
quiring full written reports.
NSA does have many Haws: it
iis run by an in-group, it is re
| mote from its member schools,
lit is unrepresentative. But these
flaws might more easily be cor
rected by making membership
available only to individual stu
dents, instead of to student gov
ernments, than by adopting your
suggest ions.
