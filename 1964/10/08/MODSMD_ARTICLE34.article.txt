## Herzog: 'If I'm Crazy, It's All Right With Me' 
### Al Heineman 
Although the major reviews are
I already in on Saul Bellow's new
novel, Herzog, I think it might
be well to add another two cents
worth, for two reasons. One is
that the book concerns the strug
gle of an intellectual, a professor
j (the two are not necessarily mil
: tually exclusive), to adapt to
American society. In a college
community, this is pertinent ma
| terial.
The second reason is that most
of the reviews I've read have
somehow missed the major con
flict of the novel; that is, they
i dwell on the protagonist's psy
chological struggle without really
'examining the factors producing
that struggle.
Cynicism vs. The Good Life
The factors are, briefly, th e
| conflict between the intellectual
; cynicism about America's man
ners and mores, and the very hu
man, very bourgeois desire 112 or
security, the good life: home,
family, love, prestige. This con
flict. in tandem with a genuinely
fouled-up personal life - two
marital failures, spasmodic af
fairs. and an unfinished book re
sult in the crisis around which
i the book centers.
But. in point of fact, nothing
really happens in the book. Her
i zog retreats to his dilapidated
j estate in the Berkshires, medi
| tates, recreates what seems to
him a futile personal history,
land writes letters. He writes, at
: first, to people he knows, a n (i
(then, the dam of pent-up regrets
and desires bursting, he writes to
i people whose books he had read,
I to the famous dead, and finally,
i to a God he is not sure he believes
| in. He writes, trying to untangle
the cosmic chaos, trying to find
some shred of meaning in man's,
| or more particularly, his own, ex
! istenee. He writes on scraps of
paper, or composes the letters
| mentally, and, of course, never
j mails them.
An Animal's Idiot Joy
i What Herzog, philosophy pro
j fessor and privy to the most
! sophisticated arguments about
: the reasons for existence, eventu
| ally decides, is: "If I am crazy,
j it's all right with me." Or, later,
| "Is it an idiot joy that makes ibis
animal, the most peculiar animal
' of all, exclaim something? And
' he thinks this reaction a sign, a
proof of eternity? . . . But l have
I no arguments to make about it.
! . . . I am pretty well satisfied to
| be, to be just as it is willed, and
| for as long as T may remain in
J occupancy." And he stops writing
I letters.
The Dreaded 'lOgghead'
Bellow's use of the language is
unquestionably superb. He is at
home in tlie idiom of immigrant

Jews, of the middle class., of aca
demicians. One is bothered by
Herzog's occasional use of tough
or common language, and one
may feel thai il is a lapse on the
author's part, and unbelieveable,
until one of Herzog's lovers tells
him. "Stop talking tough. It's not
you. You're ;i poet. You don't
need to." And Ihe realization
dawns that the idiom is merely
another of Herzog's willing con
descensions to America; he is un
willing to remove himself from
the bourgeois mainstream and
become tlt e dreaded "egghead."
The detractors of Herzog have
said ilia I Ihe scope of Ihe book is
100 small for il to be a great novel.
The scope is small. It encom
p asses only the breadth
and depth of a human mind, and
to belittle (hat scope is to dis
count Proust and Joyce as unim
portant. In what is rapidly becom
ing, albeit unwittingly, an exis
tential society, perhaps an artful
creation of a complete and com
plex fictional character who mir
rors that society is the summit of
our literary potential; if not, it
is certainly not an achievement
to be passed off as unimportant.
Typically Superficial
And Time, in a typically super
ficial and uncomprehending sum
mary, has termed Herzog "maud
lin and passive." He is passive,
yes, because his motivations have
been suffocated by his own mis
takes and by others' cruelty. But
whether or not he can finish his
book, or face Moby Dick, or Gold
finger, for that matter, certainly
his mental death-struggle with
meaning is as great a crisis and
as powerful an action as exists.
And he is maudlin in his some
time effusions of what he calls
"potato love," unreasonable and
sentimental bestowing of affec
tion on the deserving and unde
serving alike. But to condemn
him for being irrational in it is
emotions is to rob him of his hu
manity. And the whole point of
the book is that there is no ulti
mate rationale behind being, that
it is there, and il is good.
With Humor And Insight
One may disagree with Bellow's
thesis, but one cannot deny that
lie has broached and wrestled
with some of the most significant
spiritual issues of our epoch. With
humor and insight, with compas
sion and precision, he lias etched
what is, for me, an unforgettable
character. The book is fun to
read, compelling, moving, and
important.
If Saul Bellow is not the logi
cal successor to Faulkner, he will
do until someone else comes
along. And the someone else may
very well reveal himself in Bel
low's next book.
