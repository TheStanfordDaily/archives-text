## The 						Goldwater Southern Strategy: All-White GOP 
### WALTER LIPPMANN 
When Sen. Barry Goldwater
j went campaigning in the South,
| his purpose, it appears, was not
i so much to win this election, but
j to inaugurate the socalled south
ern strategy in order to lay the
foundations for a radically new
Republican Party.
This was made plain by the
exuberant welcome he extended
to Sen. Strom Thurmond who
has now joined the Republican
Party. This new Republican
1 Party, which was born in San
Francisco, is 1o be built upon a
Goldwater-Thurmond alliance; it
is to be a white man's party and
not conservative at all, but radi
cally reactionary.
Goldwater and Thurmond
The formation of the Gold
j water-Thurmond alliance ex
plains what is otherwise madly
j inexplicable about Senator Gold
! water's campaign speeches dur
! ing the past week. There was
to begin with his almost total
silence about the Civil Rights Act.
though opposition to it is by all
I odds the main reason for hi s
I strength in the South.
There was no need for him to
mention civil rights or to take
notice of the existence of a large
Negro population when he could
consort publicly with Senator
Thurmond. Senator Thurmond is
( the most extreme segregationist
and the most extreme reaction
ary in the United States Senate.
Senator Goldwater may now
go on trying to confuse the
Northerners by talking about de
segregating the Arizona National
Guard and the airport dining
; room in Phoenix. But for all
Southerners, black or white, his
embrace of Strom Thurmond
places him squarely with the ex
it reme racists.
Ext ruvugant ly Keacf ionary
Since there was nothing fur
ther to be said on the race issue,
Senator Goldwater devoted him
self to the one thing still needed
to clinch the kind of southern
vote represented by Thurmond.
This was to be so boldly and ex
travagantly reactionary on other
issues that there could be no
doubt that he was wholly free of
the tainl of any of that progres-
I sivism which is the tradition of
| the West.
This was, I believe, why he
chose Florida, where there are so
many elderly people, to attack
I Medicare, why he chose in Ten
nessee to renew his proposal to
' sell the TVA and why he went to

i West Virginia to attack the poor.
Some have wondered whether
these are symptoms of a "suicide
{complex." I think they are the
! result of a decision to make over
the Republican Parly in the im
age of Barry Goldwater and
Strom Thurmond.
| Here again, as in his demands
| for a weaker government, but
| stronger policies, we see that the
I Senator is enclosed, as in an en
velope, in his private dream
I world. One of his persistent fan
tasies is that, since the poor are
a minority, a great political re
sult can be had by arousing the
rich against the poor. We all
! know of the demagogues and
! agitators who arouse the poor
against the rich. But in Barry
! Goldwater we have a demagogue
| who dreams of arousing the rich
against the poor.
For the proof of this we must
! look to his speech in Charleston,
I W.Va., on Friday, Sept. IS
omitting the wild ad lib remarks
i which were reported in the news
papers and using only the offi
cial text given out by the Repub
lican National Committee. This
speech was an attack on the ad
ministration's "war on poverty."
$11000: Average Living?
The Senator said that the Ken
nedy-Johnson objective is that "no
one is to be permitted to fall be
low the average." This is obvi
ously sheer gibberish, since there
cannot be an "average" if no one
is below it.
What Senator Goldwater was
trying to talk about is the fact
that the administration regards
as "poor" a non-farm family of
four which has an annual income
of less than $3,000. This figure is
: not an "average."
It is an amount of money which
! permits a family of four to spend
| about 70 cents a day per person
j for food, to spend $800 a year for
i housing, which covers rent or
mortgage payments, utilities and
heat. After food and housing,
there is left in this budget $1,200
or $23 a week for the whole
I family to pay for clothing, trans
portation, school supplies and
books, home furnishings and sup
j plies, medical care, personal
1 care, recreation, insurance and
everything else.
The more closely one examines
| the actual texts of the Gold
water speeches, the more appar
ent is the divorce between what
he thinks and says and what ac
tually exists in the real world.
His feet are not on the ground.

i West Virginia to attack the poor.

these are symptoms of a "suicide

the Republican Parly in the im
age of Barry Goldwater and

| Here again, as in his demands

I Senator is enclosed, as in an en
velope, in his private dream
I world. One of his persistent fan
tasies is that, since the poor are
a minority, a great political re
sult can be had by arousing the
rich against the poor. We all
! know of the demagogues and
! agitators who arouse the poor
against the rich. But in Barry
! Goldwater we have a demagogue
| who dreams of arousing the rich
against the poor.
For the proof of this we must
! look to his speech in Charleston,
I W.Va., on Friday, Sept. IS
omitting the wild ad lib remarks
i which were reported in the news
papers and using only the offi
cial text given out by the Repub
lican National Committee. This
speech was an attack on the ad
ministration's "war on poverty."
$11000: Average Living?
The Senator said that the Ken
nedy-Johnson objective is that "no
one is to be permitted to fall be
low the average." This is obvi
ously sheer gibberish, since there
cannot be an "average" if no one
is below it.
What Senator Goldwater was
trying to talk about is the fact
that the administration regards
as "poor" a non-farm family of
four which has an annual income
of less than $3,000. This figure is
: not an "average."
It is an amount of money which
! permits a family of four to spend
| about 70 cents a day per person
j for food, to spend $800 a year for
i housing, which covers rent or
mortgage payments, utilities and
heat. After food and housing,
there is left in this budget $1,200
or $23 a week for the whole
I family to pay for clothing, trans
portation, school supplies and
books, home furnishings and sup
j plies, medical care, personal
1 care, recreation, insurance and
everything else.
The more closely one examines
| the actual texts of the Gold
water speeches, the more appar
ent is the divorce between what
he thinks and says and what ac
tually exists in the real world.
His feet are not on the ground.
When Sen. Barry Goldwater
j went campaigning in the South,
| his purpose, it appears, was not
i so much to win this election, but
j to inaugurate the socalled south
ern strategy in order to lay the
foundations for a radically new
Republican Party.
This was made plain by the
exuberant welcome he extended
to Sen. Strom Thurmond who
has now joined the Republican
Party. This new Republican
1 Party, which was born in San
Francisco, is 1o be built upon a
Goldwater-Thurmond alliance; it
is to be a white man's party and
not conservative at all, but radi
cally reactionary.
Goldwater and Thurmond
The formation of the Gold
j water-Thurmond alliance ex
plains what is otherwise madly
j inexplicable about Senator Gold
! water's campaign speeches dur
! ing the past week. There was
to begin with his almost total
silence about the Civil Rights Act.
though opposition to it is by all
I odds the main reason for hi s
I strength in the South.
There was no need for him to
mention civil rights or to take
notice of the existence of a large
Negro population when he could
consort publicly with Senator
Thurmond. Senator Thurmond is
( the most extreme segregationist
and the most extreme reaction
ary in the United States Senate.
Senator Goldwater may now
go on trying to confuse the
Northerners by talking about de
segregating the Arizona National
Guard and the airport dining
; room in Phoenix. But for all
Southerners, black or white, his
embrace of Strom Thurmond
places him squarely with the ex
it reme racists.
Ext ruvugant ly Keacf ionary
Since there was nothing fur
ther to be said on the race issue,
Senator Goldwater devoted him
self to the one thing still needed
to clinch the kind of southern
vote represented by Thurmond.
This was to be so boldly and ex
travagantly reactionary on other
issues that there could be no
doubt that he was wholly free of
the tainl of any of that progres-
I sivism which is the tradition of
| the West.

When Sen. Barry Goldwater
j went campaigning in the South,
| his purpose, it appears, was not
i so much to win this election, but
j to inaugurate the socalled south
ern strategy in order to lay the
foundations for a radically new
Republican Party.
This was made plain by the
exuberant welcome he extended
to Sen. Strom Thurmond who
has now joined the Republican
Party. This new Republican
1 Party, which was born in San
Francisco, is 1o be built upon a
Goldwater-Thurmond alliance; it
is to be a white man's party and
not conservative at all, but radi
cally reactionary.
Goldwater and Thurmond
The formation of the Gold
j water-Thurmond alliance ex
plains what is otherwise madly
j inexplicable about Senator Gold
! water's campaign speeches dur
! ing the past week. There was
to begin with his almost total
silence about the Civil Rights Act.
though opposition to it is by all
I odds the main reason for hi s
I strength in the South.
There was no need for him to
mention civil rights or to take
notice of the existence of a large
Negro population when he could
consort publicly with Senator
Thurmond. Senator Thurmond is
( the most extreme segregationist
and the most extreme reaction
ary in the United States Senate.
Senator Goldwater may now
go on trying to confuse the
Northerners by talking about de
segregating the Arizona National
Guard and the airport dining
; room in Phoenix. But for all
Southerners, black or white, his
embrace of Strom Thurmond
places him squarely with the ex
it reme racists.
Ext ruvugant ly Keacf ionary
Since there was nothing fur
ther to be said on the race issue,
Senator Goldwater devoted him
self to the one thing still needed
to clinch the kind of southern
vote represented by Thurmond.
This was to be so boldly and ex
travagantly reactionary on other
issues that there could be no
doubt that he was wholly free of
the tainl of any of that progres-
I sivism which is the tradition of
| the West.
This was, I believe, why he
chose Florida, where there are so
many elderly people, to attack
I Medicare, why he chose in Ten
nessee to renew his proposal to
' sell the TVA and why he went to

i West Virginia to attack the poor.
Some have wondered whether
these are symptoms of a "suicide
{complex." I think they are the
! result of a decision to make over
the Republican Parly in the im
age of Barry Goldwater and
Strom Thurmond.
| Here again, as in his demands
| for a weaker government, but
| stronger policies, we see that the
I Senator is enclosed, as in an en
velope, in his private dream
I world. One of his persistent fan
tasies is that, since the poor are
a minority, a great political re
sult can be had by arousing the
rich against the poor. We all
! know of the demagogues and
! agitators who arouse the poor
against the rich. But in Barry
! Goldwater we have a demagogue
| who dreams of arousing the rich
against the poor.
For the proof of this we must
! look to his speech in Charleston,
I W.Va., on Friday, Sept. IS
omitting the wild ad lib remarks
i which were reported in the news
papers and using only the offi
cial text given out by the Repub
lican National Committee. This
speech was an attack on the ad
ministration's "war on poverty."
$11000: Average Living?
The Senator said that the Ken
nedy-Johnson objective is that "no
one is to be permitted to fall be
low the average." This is obvi
ously sheer gibberish, since there
cannot be an "average" if no one
is below it.
What Senator Goldwater was
trying to talk about is the fact
that the administration regards
as "poor" a non-farm family of
four which has an annual income
of less than $3,000. This figure is
: not an "average."
It is an amount of money which
! permits a family of four to spend
| about 70 cents a day per person
j for food, to spend $800 a year for
i housing, which covers rent or
mortgage payments, utilities and
heat. After food and housing,
there is left in this budget $1,200
or $23 a week for the whole
I family to pay for clothing, trans
portation, school supplies and

j plies, medical care, personal
