# 'Seduced And Abandoned' Not Worth The Eye Strain
## 
### JOHN THAYER 
Pictro Gerrni. who directed the
now-famous "Divorce â€” Italian
Style," has tried his luck again
in Seduced and Abandoned
with somewhat less success. The
movie is intended to be asatire
on Sicilian mores and manners,
that is, on the obsession of Sicil
ians with the preservation of
family honor.
The plot, based on a story writ
ten by Germi himself, is impos
sibly complicated; but in barest
outline it deals with the attempts
of a father to restore his daugh
ter Agnese's honor after she has
been seduced and abandoned by
her sister's fiance, Peppino. The
tortuous ramifications of this
seemingly simple situation are
undoubtedly part of the appeal
of the picture; raconteurs of the
let - me - tell - you - what - hap
pened school will find it quite a
challenge to keep everything
straight.
The acting is without exception
first rate. Saro Urzi is wonder
fully blustery, bull-headed, a n d
simple-minded as the father.
Stephanie Sandrelli as Agnese is
out of place, since she is at
once slender, beautiful, intelligent,
and not at all concerned with tlie

family's reputation. Aldo Puglisi
plays Peppino as he should, in
the manner of ji very frightened
mama's boy cowering before the
shopkeeper who has caught him
stealing candy.
The Italian women play them
|selves, and are variously bathetic
i and funny. The men are gossipy
' and generally impotent. The di
i reeling aims at making the pic
ture one of those long intervals
of lethargy, interrupted by short
and violent action, so typical of
j Sicily. It certainly succeeds,
[thanks to the cooperation of the
|camera and all the actors in
volved.
The script, however, has prob
lems; namely, (1) it tries to be
! burleque, satire, and tragedy all
at once, and (2) Germi makes no
| attempt to clarify the ensuing
confusion. Inevitably, like
! Humpty Dumpty, the picture
I takes a nasty fall; and all the
actors' heroic efforts at salvage
are to no avail. It remains in
; pieces.
! Finally, to those who couldn't
| care less whether Sicilians are
; pigheaded and hopelessly unrea
listic about their family's honor,
there are far too few laughs to
justify straining the eyes for two
hours in a dark room.
