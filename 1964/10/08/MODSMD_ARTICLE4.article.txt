# Lowenthal Sees No Communist Polarity

The current split between Bussia and China will not lead to
"a elear -cut division of spheres of inlluence within the communist
world," Richard Lowenthal of the Free University of Berlin said
yesterday to the Hoover Conference.
''While the prospects of any form of communism in the West

j appear increasingly doubtful."'*'
i Lowenthal continued, "both Mos
cow and Peking regard the un
derdeveloped world as the chief
areana of their competition. Both
I compete for influence on revolu
j tionary nationalist as well as on
(communist movements there.
"In competition, the Chinese
are likely to have more attrac-1
! tion for totalitarian revolution
i movements still fighting for
| power, but the Soviets may have
| an advantage with ruling revolu
; tionary parties, as they can offer
[ them more and demand less
risks."
Lowenthal predicted that the
I Chinese communists will try to;
form a new international of ac
tively revolutionary parties, based
on their own model and doctrinal
authority. But the strong pull of
'nationalism and the limited ap-
Ipeal of China's economic develop
| ment mean that such an interna
tional is "likely to be unstable," i
he added. '
"The Soviets are aware that
their only chance to rally broad
1 international support is to form
I a loose alliance without a very
j precise doctrinal platform and
| possibly without any clearly de
fined membership.
"One result of this is to make
it doubtful how long an 'ortho
dox' Soviet interpretation of the
communist doctrine will survive
at all «s an effective influence on
communist thought outside the
Soviet Union.
"Another result is that a num
j ber of communist parties, like
I the Cuban and perhaps even the \
Rumanian, may stay outside both
camps at least for a time, or may
choose a form of association with
the Soviets that carries no obliga
: tions whatever."

Given this uncertainty and flux,
the most stable relations among
the communist nations are likely
to emerge within geographic blocs
that have common interests, such
as Eastern Europe and East and
Southeast Asia, he added, and not
with Russia and Communist
China as poles.
