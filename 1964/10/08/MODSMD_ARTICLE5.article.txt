# Marxian Appeal Analyzed
## Hook Examines Intellectuals 
### 
The "recurrent allegiance to
Mar\ among intellectuals was
the topic ol one of yesterdays
major Hoover Conference pre
sentations. Professor Sidney
Hook of New York University
pointed to some major factors
which have contributed to the
persistent presence of Marxism
on the intellectual scene.
PROFESSOR Hook argued that
"the dominant mood of the West
ern World is critical." In addi
tion, he felt that "Marxism was
no longer handicapped by lies to
murderous communist regimes."
As a result, the intellectual,
who wants to "break with the im
perfect present," can scorn the
"reasonable programs" of the lib
erals and find "continuity with
the revolutionary past."
Professor Hook maintained that
non-Marxist or anti-Marxist re
forms did not generate as much
enthusiasm among intellectuals
since "programs of piece-meal
change strike the impatient as
half-hearted, and most of the in
tellectuals (not the scholars so
much as the opinion makers) are
impatient."
OTHER ATTRACTIONS of
Marxism are its strong sense of
social justice and its "promise to
fulfill the age-old dreams of ma
terial betterment.
Hook remarked that "as a sys
tem. Marxism is now invalid . . .
Nonetheless, there is no rival sys
tem freer of difficulties, especially
for those who hunger for the
emotional security of feeling that
they are thinking and living with
the true drift of things."
Continuing with the theme of
the invalidity of Marxism, Hook
noted that the new literature of
"Marxist rediscovery" was not
likely to serve as the basis for
an international revolutionary
movement.
"THE REINTERPRET ATIONS
of Marx have stressed the individ
ual. the deviant, the Utopian, and
the anarchist aspeeys of his be
liefs. There is no central core of
doctrine."
Hook expects this trend to con
tinue until some future date when
there will be "10,000 Marxes." De
spite this probability, however,
Marxism can be expected to con
tinue its seductive appeal.
