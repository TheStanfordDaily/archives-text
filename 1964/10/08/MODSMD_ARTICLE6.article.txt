# FROSH STUDY
## Report Initiates Action By JAMES B. BRISCOE Feature Editor (Last of a Series) 
### 
Few things arc more vilal to the undergradu
ate program at Stanford than the freshman year.
Poor grounding in math or science, improper
foundations laid in a language, insufficient in
struction in composition all of these can seri
ously. even fatally, hinder a student in his future
studies.
IT IS not hard to understand, then, why im
mediate action has been taken on many of the
recommendations made by the powerful General
Studies Committee, and why studies are cur
rently in progress on numerous others.
Among the programs reported underway by
Dr. Robert A. Walker, Chairman of the Commit
tee, are the following:
• A special course for training Teaching Assist
ants initialed last winter by the English Depart
ment on tlk* basis of preliminary reports released
by the General Studies Committee,
• A similar instructor training program now
being prepared in the French and Italian Depart
ment.
• A general program, now in progress in all
departments, to reduce and eventually to elimi
nate completely the use of first year graduate stu
dents as Teaching Assistants.
An additional inoiccl, for which I lie Commit

Leo cannot lake lull credit but which was hastened
along by their report, is the language laboratory in
the first floor of the Library. According to Walker,
plans for ihr laboratory were greatly accelerated
by preliminary reports of the Committee.
THE FROSH report is finished now, but the
Committee's work is far from over. This study
is only phase I of ;i much more extensive investi
gation of University policies and requirements in
undergraduate general education. Work has al
ready begun on Phase 11 the study of the goals
for general education at Stanford in the next dec
ade.
The aim of this study is to "develop a coordi
nated program of improvement" in a number ol
areas of undergraduate education. This study is
expected to provide the "major guidelines'' for
program improvement in general education and
for the "allocation of relevant funds" during the
next decade.

Strothmann. Head of the Modern European Lan
guages Dept. and Vice-Chairman; Dr. Gordon A.
