## Political Free Rein, But Within Limits 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM 
Members of the Stanford eonimunity are relative!)' free from
restrictions regarding political activity, a stud) of university pol
icy reveals.
"Our purpose is to give live rein to students while prevent
ing anything that might be really detrimental," Dean of Students

H. Donald Winbigler said Monday
in an interview with The Daily.
STUDENTS ARE not forbid
den. for example, to demonstrate
on campus, to pass out literature
of a partisan nature, or to solicit
funds on campus for outside poli
tical or social action although
these activities are subject to
certain University regulations.
In this regard Stanford is con
siderably more liberal than many
state universities where state
laws dictate various restrictions.
At the University of California,

where students protested last
'week for more political freedom,!
! the solicitation of funds on cam
pus is prohibited.
THKRK IS likewise a ban on
solicitation of political party
membership and on organization
| for political or social action.
Students on the Farm cannot;
indulge in these activities totally;
j without control fro m above, j
There are accompanying proce-;
dures and provisions.
There are rules governing stu-i
: dent demonstrations. They must, j
; for example, be conducted in an :
j "orderly manner" where they
| will not interfere with vehicular
or pedestrian traffic or wi I h
; classes.
1 In addition, they cannot be i
held within University buildings!
or in the private residential areas
of the campus.
"We have no limitations on stu
j dents or voluntary organizations
who wish to distribute literature
lon campus." the Dean said, al
though we want to avoid litering
up the campus. Pjut this is a privi
lege only for those of our own
community."
ON I,V "YOM NT/VKY Stan
ford organizations" are allowed
to use University facilities and.
j take public stands and these or
ganizations must be registered
[with the University.
Furthermore, they must, ac-
I cording to a policy statement be
approved by the Board of Trus
tees in 1963, have "purposes and
procedures not inconsistent with
'the goals and standards of the
| University."
"So far we have never refused
to recognize an organization," he
added.
In essence, the University re
tains the right to intervene if
things become "extreme" while
leaving a broad range of freedom
I for political expression and ac-:
' lion. '

"Our purpose is to give live rein to students while prevent
ing anything that might be really detrimental," Dean of Students

H. Donald Winbigler said Monday
in an interview with The Daily.
STUDENTS ARE not forbid
den. for example, to demonstrate
on campus, to pass out literature
of a partisan nature, or to solicit
funds on campus for outside poli
tical or social action although
these activities are subject to
certain University regulations.
In this regard Stanford is con
siderably more liberal than many
state universities where state
laws dictate various restrictions.
At the University of California,

where students protested last
'week for more political freedom,!
! the solicitation of funds on cam
pus is prohibited.
THKRK IS likewise a ban on
solicitation of political party
membership and on organization
| for political or social action.
Students on the Farm cannot;
indulge in these activities totally;
j without control fro m above, j
There are accompanying proce-;
dures and provisions.
There are rules governing stu-i
: dent demonstrations. They must, j
; for example, be conducted in an :
j "orderly manner" where they
| will not interfere with vehicular
or pedestrian traffic or wi I h
; classes.
1 In addition, they cannot be i
held within University buildings!
or in the private residential areas
of the campus.
"We have no limitations on stu
j dents or voluntary organizations
who wish to distribute literature
lon campus." the Dean said, al
though we want to avoid litering
up the campus. Pjut this is a privi
lege only for those of our own
community."
ON I,V "YOM NT/VKY Stan
ford organizations" are allowed
to use University facilities and.
j take public stands and these or
ganizations must be registered
[with the University.
Furthermore, they must, ac-
I cording to a policy statement be
approved by the Board of Trus
tees in 1963, have "purposes and
procedures not inconsistent with
'the goals and standards of the
| University."
"So far we have never refused
to recognize an organization," he
added.
In essence, the University re
tains the right to intervene if
things become "extreme" while
leaving a broad range of freedom
