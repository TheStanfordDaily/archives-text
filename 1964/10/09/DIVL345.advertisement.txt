A Plea For Honesty
Do von make important decisions without considering the fact - r For example, I
do you regard yourself as a Christian even though you do not understand or accept '
even tilt- basic teachings of Christ; Kvcn worse. <lu you categorically ri'jcct the
Christian concept of Cod and tin BiMe as Hi- authmtic communication to man with
out -i riottsly examining the evidence ?
A fatuous scholar, who for more than forty years had denied the IVity of Christ,
recently -aid, "\o ine can honestly consider tin- overwhelming evidence proving
tli< l)eil> of Jesns Christ without becoming a Christian. Having carefully inves
tigated the birth, life, teachings, death resurrection, and continuing influence of
lesus of Nazareth, he confessed that then is no mor< ennsistent clmiee. After nearly a
lifetime of agnosticism anil even antagonism toward Christianity. he liecanu- a devout i
follower of ("hrist.
C. S. I.i wis, late Professor at Oxford Cniversity, another who was for many J
years a vocal agnostic, wrote several convincing hooks advocating belief in Jesus i
Christ as thv only Savior and l.ord. Ileniadi this statement: "A man who was merely j
a man and said the sort of things Je-us said wouldn't lie a great moral teacher, lie
would either lie a lunatic on the level with a man who -a\ - lie's a poached egg, or
else he would lie the devil of hell; you must take your choice. Kither this was and
is tin- Son of (Jod, or else a mail man or something worse. Y>u can shut Hint up
for a demon: or you can fall at His feel and call llim l.ord and (iod. Hut don't
conic up. with anj patronizing nonsense ahout His hem.' .1 ureal moral teacher, lie
hasn't left that alternative open to us."
Very few reject Ji -u- Christ as the Son of (In I and the Savior of men for in
tellectual reasons alone. Of course there are many "intellectual sinoke screens" de
signed to ohscure tin real issue which is often stated, "hccomini! a Christian involves
certain moral responsibilities which I am not ready to accept."
Many professors and students who say they cannot hclicve in the Hible and tilt/
basic tenets of Christianity are inferring that they are "too intelligent to believe
such nonsense" and yet are embarrassed by the simplest questions regarding the same.
All too often, the so-called skeptics atv merely parroting what someone else has told
them without personally reading the Hible and evaluating tin many evidences.
Our challenge to you, then, is to consider, in all fairness, the claims Jesus Christ
| has made upon our lives, it is not our intent to promote religion as such, but rather
to introduce men and women to this Person whose influence has changed the whole
course of hist<irj.
No scientist who is worthy of the name, who. ignoring the facts, enters into a
laboratory experiment for the purpose of gaining information to support his precon
ceived ideas. It is our purpose to acquaint you with the facts and to invite you to
enter into a great experiment with (iod. Read the (iospi 1 of John in the New Testa
ment one hour every day for a month. Head it with an open mind and a prayerful
heart. You may wish to pray something like this each time you read:" (iod. if you
exist I want to know you. If you have a plan for my li\â€¢ I want to know and follow
that plan. I am aware of a need in m\ life. If you can forgive my sins and meet
my needs I want your help. If vol! actually interrupted history and revealed your
self to man in Jesus Christ, I want to know llim personally.
If the teaching of the llihle is true, what you do with Christ in this life deter
mines your eternal destiny. Contrary to all expectations, let tis suppose that, for you,
the |{ible is not true and the claims of Christ are false. What have you lost; Nothing.
You have invested thirty profitable hours reading tht wm Id's best seller, about the
most unique Person of history. Unite obviously, in performing this experiment, you
have everything to gain and nothing to lose.
