# Artist's 'Flowery' Style Beats Waterloo in Bio
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
Bright swirls of color, rhythmic
'lines, and a sense of movement
and vitality dominate a new ex
| hibit of paintings on display at
I the International Center through
out this month. They are the
work of Ann Balaam, a 21 year
old candidate for the Master's de
gree in art at Stanford.
Observers have compared the
I paintings to flowers, marine life,
I even cells seen oil slides under
a microscope. Miss Balaam de
scribes them as "studies in the
motion of biomorphic forms,
i opening, growing, folding, clos
! ing." but maintains thai it is up
|to the individual what he wants
I to see in them.
DMSI'ITE TIIE organic content
of the paintings, Miss Balaam in
sists that she got "horrible

grades" in Biology one, two, and
three, which she took as an un
dergraduate at Stanford. Most of
her courses were in Ihe studio,
where she was guided chiefly by
Keith Boyle, assistant professor
in the Department of Ait. Her
artistic awards include the Tres
idder Purchase Award, the Mor
timer C. Lewintritt Award, and
the first prize in Graphics at the
San Mateo County Fiesta last
summer.
The paintings represent part of
a long development, ihe artist
feels. She concentrated on figure
paintings until last spring, but
turned to biomorphic subjects in
an attempt to achieve more clar
ity of form. The forms in her cur
rent paintings are defined by pre
cise lines, and exist in "usually
undefined space."
The works will be discussed at
n dinner 1o be held Sunday at 7
p.m. at the International Center.
All students are invited. Signups
are al the center, and tickets are
$1 apiece.
