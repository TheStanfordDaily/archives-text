FILMS
RULES OF THE GAME, Jean Renoir's brilliantly funny tragedy
which was recently voted one of the best films ever made by an inter
national panel, is tonight's Tresidder film. RASHOMON, Kurosawa's
classic Japanese film dealing with the equally classic question, "What
is truth?," will be tomorrow's Tresidder film.
YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND TOMORROW is at the Guild (see
review on this page).
BEHOLD A PALE HORSE is Fred Zinneman's newest film. Star
ring Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn, it is at the Park. THE BEST
MAN, a comedy about political conventions with Henry Fonda and
Cliff Robertson, is co-featured.
SEDUCED AND ABANDONED, the newest film by Pietro ("Di
vorce Italian Style") Germi is appearing at the Fine Arts with Fel
lini's old but excellent LA STRADA.
THE VISIT, the Ingrid Bergman-Anthony Quinn film of Durren
matt's savage play, and THE EASY LIFE, a sort of small scale
"Dolce Vita" but funnier, are at the Paris.
GOOD NEIGHBOR SAM, a comedy with Jack Lcmmon and Romy
Schneider, is at the Bijou. With it is the first of the James Bond
films, DOCTOR NO, starring Sean Connery as lan Fleming's all
but-invincible hero.
CLEOPATRA, perhaps the only film in history where the final
budget showed an expenditure of almost $1,000,000 for "miscellane
ous," is at the Stanford. Rex Harrison acts magnificently, for which
he is killed off halfway through the movie; Richard Burton struggles
with what may Ik 1 the worst lines ever written; and Elizabeth Taylor
â€”well, she looks good.
