# Students Favor LBJ, 2-1
## THE 						STANFORD POLL 
### AL HAMMOND 
Stanford students favor Lyn
don B. Johnson two to one over
Barry Goldwater. a Daily-con
ducted poll shows.
Tlift POLL also revealed the
following:
• There are many more stu
dents with Republican back
grounds than Democratic.
• Freshmen are Goldwater's
most ardent followers, with
sophomores, juniors, and sen
iors progressively more favor
able to Johnson.
• Wilbur in particular is a
Goldwater stronghold, with a
majority for the Senator.
• Engineers are more con
servative than any other ma
jor.
To the question "If the elec
tion were held tomorrow and
you could vote, how would you
vote for president ?" the classes
divided as follows:
Goldwater Johnson
Total 30% 60%
Freshmen 37% 51%
Soph 31% 57%
Junior 22% <»«%
Senior 22% 00%
About five per cent were un
decided on the above question,
and three per cent indicated
thev would not vote. The fresh

men were most undecided, and
the juniors least, while more
sophomores a n d freshmen
would not vote than other
classes.
The family backgrounds of
those polled revealed that more
than half came from Republi
can homes. The answers to the
question "How are your par
ents registered?" split th is
way:
Both Republican 51%
Both Democratic 20%
Independent or mixed '24%
Of the last category homes
in which one parent was Re
publican and one Democratic
were the most common, with
fewer Independents. One per
cent indicated that their par
ents were either not registered
or were registered as some
thing other than one of the
above, while four per cent did
not know how their parents
were registered.
The basic Republicanism of
Stanford students was again
underscored by the results of
the question "If you could,
how would you register?," al
though the percentage of Re

publicans was not as high as
with their parents:
Republican VI"/,
Democrat 34%
Independent lU%
Hero the large Independent
group is the key to the results,
since most of them (eighty per
cent > indicated they would vote
for Johnson. Persons still un
decided as if) how they would
register totaled four per cent.
THK VOTE breakdown by
living group revealed Wilbur
as the home of Barry's boys,
with about 53 per cent intend
ing to vote (when they get old
enough) for the Senator. Wil
bur was the only living group
on campus which Goldwater
carried, all others going for
Johnson.
Eating clubs were slightly
more liberal than fraternities,
and the upperclass women's
dorms more liberal than the
row. Roble and Branner wore
almost exactly on the campus
average of two to one for John
son, and Stern was even more
for the Democratic candidate.
In general, the women were
more liberal than the men.
The division by major sub
ject gave the following results

to the question "What is your
major field?":
Goldwater Johnson
Engineering 44%, 44%
Science 28% 59%
Social Scicncc .'!(►%! 65%
Humanities 20%j 65%
Undecided 38% !7%
Engineering and science ma
jors had the greatest amount
of politically undecided s 1 u
dents, with almost all majors
having an equal number of
those who would not vote or
who would vote for someone
other than the two major can
didates.
THE POLL was adminis
tered selectively to ail under
graduate students in carefully
proportioned amounts, except
for those students who are
married or are off-campus and
non-affiliated. These students
were not polled because of dif
ficulties in reaching them.
Approximately one out of
every five students of those
who live in university housing
was polled. The number of polls
for each living group was
based on official housing fig
ures, anrl the correct percent
age 1 iti each case determined.
A total of NX7 polls were finally
collected and tabulated by com
puter at the Stanford computa-
