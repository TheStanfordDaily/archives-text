# Loren and Mastroianni Superb In New Movie
## 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
In contrast to its rather vague
title, Yesterday, Today, and To
morrow is a tightly logical and
theoretically flawless picture, pro
ceeding from its first premise
with an astounding inevitability
that is only slightly upset by real
ity.
First, it. is an Italian film;
therefore it is about sex. There
fore, it features the two people in
all Italy who know the most about
| sex, or at least who play it best,
Sophia Loren and Marcello Mas
troianni. Therefore, naturally, it is
produced by Carlo Ponti and Vit
torio di Sica.
FURTHER, it is a comedy. It
follows, then, that with such a
stellar cast and management, it
ought to be the last word in com
edy. Ah, but it isn't. It's only
nearly the last, and for a very
simple reason: the script. To say
that it is flimsy would be char
itable; actually, by all conven
tional standards of dramaturgy,
it is variously pointless, plotless,
trite, and banal.
However, conventional stand
ards don't apply to Yesterday, To
day, and Tomorrow, for Ponti and
di Sica have purposely thrown
out all the rules and are trying
to capture and hold their audi
ence with new rules and new de
vices. Theoretically, they will pre
sent three disconnected variations
on the same theme, all of them
mildly humorous.
Boredom will be avoided by the
change of locale and character;
laughter will be insured by the
absurdity of the goings-on and
the unquestioned skill of the prin
cipals. And sex, or the expectation
of it, will keep the audience's in
terest from flagging if things do,
in spile of all, get dull.
AND SO, Sophia Loren is Ade
lina of Naples, Anna of Milan,
and Mara of Rome, while Marcello
Mastroianni is, respectively, her
unemployed husband, her un
happy gigolo, and her childish
lover. In the first, Sophia plays a
peasant woman who keeps out of
jail by always being pregnant;
in the second she is an enorm
ously rich wife bored with her

! husband and her money; and in
the third she is a quixotic prosti
tute who gets entangled with a
young seminarian next door.
After a chuckle or two at the
initial absurdity of each, bore
dom does, unfortunately, tend to
| set in, because (1) all three of the
: stories are painfully trite, (2) the
I plotless situations fail to hold the
'viewer's attention, and (3) the
lines aren't nearly funny enough
! to keep him laughing. The sex and
'the marvelously hazy color
photography help some, but the
noble effort would indeed be lost
without the acting.
Marcello Mastroianni must be
one of the finest actors in the
world, for here, as usual, his per
formance is astounding. The se
cret of his characterizations is
that amazingly mobile face, which
he can change into any person or
expression at will. To this he adds
the precise body movement con
veying what pages of dialogue
could never do. And infusing it
all is that infectious bouyance he
brings to all his roles.
Sophia Loren needs no explain
ing; she is the eternal woman, in
finitely desirable no matter how
she is dressed or what she says.
Wisely, she has accepted her
limitations; and within them has
developed remarkable variety and
subtlety of expression, all of
which enhance her fundamental
sensuality. Together she and Mas
troianni are superb; they per
sonify the sex, the laughter, and
the enjoyment that is Yesterday,
Today, and Tomorrow.
