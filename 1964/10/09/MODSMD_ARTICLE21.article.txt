### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
Buddy Bohn, at the age of 24.
has hitchhiked around tho world
literally singing for his supper.
The world's only wandering min
strel and now manager (and per
former) at the Tangent in Palo
Alto, he entertains audiences with
a repertoire of over 250 songs as
well as stories from his travels in
45 countries on five continents.
Bohn became a minstrel after
his sophomore year in college.
Homo for the summer, his par
ents suggested that instead of
hanging around for three months,
he buy a round-trip ticket to Ha
waii and earn his expenses by
singing.
UK ARRIVED in Hawaii with
|no money, hitchhiked to Wai
kiki, sat on a bus stop bench and
began to sing and play his guitar.
A few people gathered, growing
to a crowd of over 100 and they
passed the hat when lie finished.
After graduation, he set out on
a round the world trip, singing
for his food, lodging and trans
portation and never, using money
as a medium of exchange. "I was,"
he says, "in search of adventure,
new sights, new sounds, new
foods, new philosophies of liv
ing."
1-Ie has sung in gypsy caves in
Spain and in the royal palace for
the King of Thailand. He crossed
the Saudi Arabian desert with a
champagne smuggling camel
caravan and sang in England for
Queen Elizabeth.
A true minstrel, says Bohn,
must follow two rules. He must
never use money, and he must
sing before heads of state as "an
ambassador for the free way of
life, showing Ihem that a capital
istic system—where young people
have the freedom to roam the
world at will — is indeed the best
way of life."
