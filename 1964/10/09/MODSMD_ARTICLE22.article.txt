# Yanks Take NO. 2
## 
### 
ST. LOUIS <APi —Rookie Mel
Stottlemyre, a name Yogi Bona
still has 1 rouble spelling confused
the St. Louis Cardinals with sev
en-hit pitching yesterday and the
Now York Yankees squared 1 h e
World Series with a 8-3 victory
in the second game.
The Yanks rolled out the heavy
artillery and bombed Bob Gibson
and two successors for 12 hits
that included a homer by Phil
Linz and four doubles.
Another standing room crowd
of 30,805 huddled in the chill
breezes and 58-degree tempera
ture of Busch Stadium while Ihe
Yanks broke open a tight game
with a four-run blast in the ninth.
Manager Johnny Keane, pa
raded Barney Schultz, Gordon
Richardson and finally Roger
Craig to the hill as the score
mounted.
Boos rattled through the stands
in the sixth when the Yanks broke
a 1-1 tie with the help of a con
troversial hit batsman call by
plate umpire Bill McKinley.
Mickey Mantle had walked and
Elston Howard had lined o u t
when it happened. Joe Pepitone,
half checking a swing at an in
side pitch, was nicked on ihe left
thigh.
Catcher Tim McCarver, pitcher
Gibson, manager Keane and Dick
Groat protested with fire, but to
no avail. Tom Tresh then scor
ing Mantle with the go-ahead run
2-1 amidst a chorus of boos.
Two more Yankee runs in the
seventh and the bundle of four
in the ninth left the home crowd

[ in a sombre mood as they file d
out.
The teams left for New Y or k
immediately after the game. Fri
day is an off day for travel.
When they resume Saturday
at Yankee Stadium it will be Jim
Bouton, 18-13, a 25-year-old right
hander, pitching for Ihe Yanks
and 35-year-old Curt Simmons 18-
9, a lefty, working for the Cards.
They will play three in New
York and then will come back to
St. Louis for the rest of the best
of-seven series if more are needed.
Stottlemyre, recalled from t he
Richmond farm club of the Inter
national League Aug. 11, had the
Cardinals hiting the ball into the
dirt all through the cloudy after
noon.
The slim 22-year-old right
hander from Mabton, Wash.,
banks on a sinker ball and he had
tight control of the situation un
til he appeared to lire in the
eighth and ninth.
Berra, the Yankee manager
came out to the mound twice,
once to see if his pitcher had been
hurt by a line smash off the bat
I of Lou Brock in the sixth. Yogi
made one more trip in the ninth
after a leadoff triple by Groat
and a single by McCarver pro
duced a run with nobody out.
Mike Shannon, the hero of Wed
nesday's Cardinal uprising,
slashed into a fast double play
and Stottlemyre struck out pinch
batter Charley James to end it.
It was quite a performance
for Stottlemyre who was pitch
ing in the minors most of the sea
son. In fact, Stottlemyre's 13-3
I record in Richmond earned him
the most valuable pitcher award
in that league despite his month's
! absence. More than any other
j pitcher, the youngster was respon
' sible for the late Yankee pennant
surge with his 9-3 victory record.
The victory halted a five-game
l series losing slump of the Yanks
: who hadn't won since they took
the seventh game from the San
Francisco Giants in 1962. They
went out in four straight to Los
Angeles last year and dropped
; the opener to the Cards 9-5.
