# Stanford Seeks Second Victory
## 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
At 1:30 p.m. Saturday in Stan
ford Stadium where the grass is
greener for the Tribe eleven, the
Indians will collide with the of
fensive and defensive might of
the Rice Owls, who are proudly
hooting after a 21-0 thrashing of

West Virginia last weekend.
THIS STANFORD-RICE series
I stands at 3-0 with Rice outclass
ing the Tribe in the first two
I games, 34-7 and 30-7, and edging
II hem last year 23-13 on a late
game TD. Tomorrow's game is the
first of a two-game homestand.
Nobody loves a home better than
the Indians love the reservation.
Under Ralston, they have hosted
opponents four out of six times
at homo but have yet to see vic
tory on the road.
Stanford, which has been rela
tively fortunate injury-wise this
campaign, will start the same per
sonnel which started the UCLA

fray with the exception of Dave
Lewis.
I.FWIS, WHO has been waiting
impatiently to show his wares at
the quarterback slot, found him
self on the receiving rather than
the propelling end of passes
against the Bruins. His impres
sive showing enabled the coaches
to let Dick Ragsdale concentrate
his duties in the defensive second
ary. Lewis' temporary transfer to
flankerback raises the total of ex
quarterbacks in the starting line
up to three. Left end Mike Con

nelly played quarterback , his
freshman and sophomore years
as did Ragsdale. You've got to
hand it to them ... no that's
i not right. You've got to pass it to
; them.
The game will be won or lost
in the line. The eight men up
front on both squads, the six line
men and two linebackers, average
i approximately 220 pounds. With
ja performance similar to that
against UCLA when Stanford's
lino came through with several
fine goal-line stands and excellent
I individual performances, especial
ly by Jack Chappie, the Owls will
not only hoot, they will hurt.

(OA( H RALSTON, who has
been working his charges hard
this week on goal-line defense and
offense, considers Rice a 1 o u g h
: football team, much better than
the statistics show. Besides Rice's
victory over West Virginia, it lost
, a 3-0 thriller to LSU.
Playing in the land of defense,
Rice has compiled 26S net yards
rushing in two games compared
i to Stanford's 657 yards in three
j games. The runners whom Ral
! ston calls impressive are wing
' back Billy Hale, tailback Paul
! Piper, and fullback Gene Walker.
• All boast per carry averages over
three yards.
A BIG factor in the game will
be the status of Piper, a two year
lettcrman, who sat out the LSU
game but accounted for the Owl's
last touchdown on a brilliant 3">
yard dash.
ANOTIIKK senior Rice star in
the backfield is quarlerback Wal
ter Mcßeynolds, who connected
I on a 32 yard scoring pass against
j the Mountaineers. But Stanford's
I radar system in the defensive sec
! ondary probably won't get much
jof a workout as the Owls have
only taken to the air ten times
! in its two games.
If Rice wins, it will be because
of its defense. Although oppo
nents have outrushed and out-
I passed the Owls, the defease has
j proved unyielding at th e right

I moments and has not given up a
| touchdown.
Heading t he defense is left line
backer Malcolm Walker, who car
ries 245 lbs. well on a 6'4" frame.
I He has 2(> tackles to his credit so
! far, 15 against LSU, 11 against
West Virginia, including a blocked
I field goal attempt. Except for end
J Dale Callihan, Walker is the only
| Rice player scheduled to start on
I both offense and defense. Offen
sively, he plays a capable center.
WALK ICR injured his knee
against West Virginia but the in-
I jury does not appear to be serious
enough to keep him from seeing
action although he may not see
extensive duty both ways.
Stanford's first three games
have been thrillers with a sur
prise ending. Alfred Hitchcock
couldn't have imagined better
plots to test the nerves of. an
audience. But for Stanford fans,
the endings have been strictly
Hamlet. Saturday's game should
be a as exciting as the first three.
And in Ihe waning minutes of
play, a boot of the pigskin may
decide the winner. Rice has Larry
Rice, a junior kicking specialist
who is 3-for-3 in the PAT depart
ment and has booted a 32 yarder
through the uprights so far this
year.
And Stanford has the ICBM
the Indefensible, Consistent, Beck
(Missile). In his varsity career,
Braden Beck has not mised an
extra point kick as he converted
12 last year and 5 thus far this
year.
