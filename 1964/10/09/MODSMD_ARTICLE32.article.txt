# The 						Hoover Conference
## 
### 
The Hoover Conlerence, which ended W ed
iiesday, was a landmark in the study of Commu
nism and has made a contribution of permanent
significance both to our campus and to the world.
The most distinguished and academically
qualified authorities in the field were brought
from Ceneva, London, Berlin, and numerous
American educational institutions to participate
in the Conference. It was attended as well by
members ol the State Department, Radio Free
Kurope, the U.S. information Agency, and by
many other interested observers.
The highly successful gathering was marred
only by the lack of interest shown by most Stan
ford students and faculty in the stimulating day

time presentations and debates, and by the un
fortunate scheduling of Dr. Fred Sell war/ by the
Political Union in conflict with the concluding
sessions.
The conference dealt in detail with the funda
mental philosophical and strategic principles of
Communist movements. The ramifications of the
conclusions reached affect the* most basic as
sumptions of American Cold War foreign policy.
The Hoover Institution deserves high praise!
for making possible such a sophisticated and in
valuable pooling of expert opinion on the major!
issue of our time. We can only hope that the con
tributions made here will be afFectively applied
to the practical world of international relations, j
