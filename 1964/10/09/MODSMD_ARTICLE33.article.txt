We oiler no partieular justification for such
an enterprise, except to say that the public, in
the Age of Gallup, has been anxious to find out
what it thinks, and a newspaper can help satisfy
that curiosity.
With the heavy criticism given lately to the
accuracx of national polls, we took great care in
obtaining an accurate and broad sample of resi
dent undergraduate opinion.

Some 1,200 questionnaires were distributed
to the various residences, and 887 w ere returned.
Distribution w as made proportionally so that our
sample is not unduly weighted with the opinions
of one living group or one sex. The size of our
sample makes The Stanford Poll literally hun
dreds of times more accurate than national polls.
We would like to thank the Computation
Center and particularly Professor Ceorge E. For
sythe for the free use of the Burroughs 5000 com
puter for tabulation of the poll.
