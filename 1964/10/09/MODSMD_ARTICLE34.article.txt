# Editor, The Daily
## President Of AWS Answers 
### 
Dear Mr. Beck:
In answer to your question, "is
the AWS really necessary?" I
must reply that I think that it
is. Otherwise I would not waste
my time. The AWS fulfills a need
of the women students at this
university in that it provides con
tact and communication among
the women, both generally and
in small groups, that is provided
for the men through the IFC and
the ICC.
It provides us with the oppor
tunity to speak with a united
voice when meeting with the ad
ministration and other groups.
AWS also provides for the women
an organization in which they
can actively participate and as
sume the responsibility of self
government.
The most evident facet of self
government is found in the social
regulations. They were originally
proposed by the women to the ad
ministration and are subject to
constant reevaluation and change
by the women. They are liberal
rules, liberally interpreted and lib
erally enforced. We have shown
the administration that we can
govern this area of our lives. It
is a rare occasion when the ad
ministration feels that it must
oppose our policy.
The housing committee, which
you accuse of "running from
dorm to dorm with hammer and
nails," does not do that at all.
The university provides a main
tenance crew. Rather the com
mittee works to educate the uni
versity as to the kind of housing
women would like (members of
the committee sat on the planning
board which has drawn up plans
for new housing to be built in the
future); and agitates for improve
ments in existing housing. The
committee also works to provide
the women with things like trans
fer meal tickets at times the wom
en want. It has been successful,
last year we were able to change
the time of meal transfers from
weekend to weekdays.
We also invite speakers to cam
pus. As you know, there is no
lack of speakers on campus.
Therefore we try to provide pro
grams that will appeal specifically
to women, programs that will in
some way. even if it is only in
how one can improve her appear
ance, enrich the lives of women.
As to your accusation of a lack
<>l interest in AWS as exempli
fied in the elections last spring,
827 out of 1,600 undergraduate
women voted in the AWS presi
dential election, which you will
find is a higher percentage than
students voting in the ASSU
presidential election. The posts of
corresponding and recording sec
retaries were filled by write in
vote The Fleet ion Committee and

the Daily did not announce that
; Marilyn Jensen and Sue Hater
won these posts until a week after
the other results were announced.
.: This year we have had no
I trouble in generating interest in
; out programs. We have had to ex
. pand the number of interview
; times for committee tryouts to
i j accommodate interested women,
t ! We had over two hundred women
I attend Mrs. Kahn's talk yester
day, which I feel is not a s mall
, i group and is a larger audience
than many campus speakers
I draw.
I do not think that AWS is a
I useless organization. We do not
I sit around and do nothing but
think up ways to spend the SI, 175
that the ASSU provides us. The
I budget is published, and I am
available to explain it to you. We
are continuing to find ways to ex
ploit the full potential of the or
ganization. This year we have al
j ready expanded our committees
and their scope of action. Your
concern in my spending a frus
■ (rated year is appreciated, but I
have already found that the office
is a rewarding experience and I
jam sure that it will continue to
j be so.

Dear Sir:
Those of us who are disturbed
at Senator Goldwater's schizo
phrenia concerning a weaker
i presidency vs. a stronger foreign
policy have, in the past, had to
; content themselves with nods of
assent to Lippmann's column as
a morning accompaniment to our
coffee. It is heartening indeed to
I know that now we can gel the
same word from the Senator's
own supporters. I refer, of course,
| to Frank Paine's third paragraph
(The Daily, October 6), which I
now quote in its entirety:
"Mr. Lippmann has been con
fusing Senator Goldwater's do
mestic and foreign policies, which
I are in no way related to each
i other."
1 think Mr. Paine has isolated
j the problem in brilliant fashion.

Dear Sir:
Shocked we were, thoroughly
j shocked, at how depraved er,
deprived is the social life of
The Stanford Dolly, frosh or
I otherwise. Can it be so that as
much as 60 per cent of the popu
j lation of certain dormitories
simnlv ve'/ctatc in their stalls on

Friday eve awaiting the Great
Gods of the Social Whirl to bless
them with a phone call? Dis
tressing it is to contemplate that
ihesc lovely Dollies, always metic
ulous about their appearance, al
ways presenting a pleasant as
pect to their fellow studenls, un
tiringly friendly, real "51-per
cent-of-<he-way"ers all, should be
committed to such a fate,
BUT WHAT disturbs us most
is that a supposedly conscientious
faculty committee, after exten
sive study of campus problems,
failed to report this crisis in its
findings. Could this committee
be guilty of the currently popu
lar sin of managed news? Were
its members in tfie employ of
the Wilbur Hall social chairmen,
as widespread rumors imply?
How else, we ask, could such in
justice go unheeded? Obviously,
the committee's suggestion that
more females be admitted would
serve only to glut the market.
Instead of 60 per cent out of ac
tion there would be 70 or per
haps even 80 per cent in the .Roble
Orphanage come Friday night.
OF COURSK, there is always
the possibility that one night one
of the more perceptive Dollies,
seized with some uncommon cour
age, might suggest to her peers,
"Maybe it's us. Maybe we should
drop our demand for deification
prior to accepting a date. Maybe
we shouldn't insist on two weeks
notice. Maybe we should allow
at least three hours before his
arrival to break a date." Such
suggestions would undoubterly
lead to the formation of a com
mittee among the girls, a com
mittee firmly dedicated to its
task.
The next morning would find

Dear Sir:
Those of us who are disturbed
at Senator Goldwater's schizo
phrenia concerning a weaker
i presidency vs. a stronger foreign
policy have, in the past, had to
; content themselves with nods of
assent to Lippmann's column as
a morning accompaniment to our
coffee. It is heartening indeed to
I know that now we can gel the
same word from the Senator's
own supporters. I refer, of course,

(The Daily, October 6), which I
now quote in its entirety:
"Mr. Lippmann has been con

BUT WHAT disturbs us most
is that a supposedly conscientious

sive study of campus problems,
failed to report this crisis in its
findings. Could this committee
be guilty of the currently popu

its members in tfie employ of

as widespread rumors imply?
How else, we ask, could such in

Dear Mr. Beck:
In answer to your question, "is
the AWS really necessary?" I
must reply that I think that it
is. Otherwise I would not waste
my time. The AWS fulfills a need
of the women students at this
university in that it provides con
tact and communication among
the women, both generally and
in small groups, that is provided
for the men through the IFC and
the ICC.
It provides us with the oppor
tunity to speak with a united
voice when meeting with the ad
ministration and other groups.
AWS also provides for the women
an organization in which they
can actively participate and as
sume the responsibility of self
government.
The most evident facet of self
government is found in the social
regulations. They were originally
proposed by the women to the ad
ministration and are subject to
constant reevaluation and change
by the women. They are liberal
rules, liberally interpreted and lib
erally enforced. We have shown
the administration that we can
govern this area of our lives. It
is a rare occasion when the ad
ministration feels that it must
oppose our policy.
The housing committee, which
you accuse of "running from
dorm to dorm with hammer and
nails," does not do that at all.
The university provides a main
tenance crew. Rather the com
mittee works to educate the uni
versity as to the kind of housing
women would like (members of
the committee sat on the planning
board which has drawn up plans
for new housing to be built in the
future); and agitates for improve

Dear Sir:
Those of us who are disturbed
at Senator Goldwater's schizo
phrenia concerning a weaker
i presidency vs. a stronger foreign
policy have, in the past, had to
; content themselves with nods of
assent to Lippmann's column as
a morning accompaniment to our
coffee. It is heartening indeed to
I know that now we can gel the
same word from the Senator's
own supporters. I refer, of course,
| to Frank Paine's third paragraph
(The Daily, October 6), which I
now quote in its entirety:
"Mr. Lippmann has been con
fusing Senator Goldwater's do
mestic and foreign policies, which
I are in no way related to each

Dear Sir:

much as 60 per cent of the popu
j lation of certain dormitories
simnlv ve'/ctatc in their stalls on

Friday eve awaiting the Great
Gods of the Social Whirl to bless
them with a phone call? Dis

ulous about their appearance, al
ways presenting a pleasant as
pect to their fellow studenls, un
tiringly friendly, real "51-per
cent-of-<he-way"ers all, should be
committed to such a fate,
BUT WHAT disturbs us most
is that a supposedly conscientious
faculty committee, after exten
sive study of campus problems,
failed to report this crisis in its
findings. Could this committee
be guilty of the currently popu
lar sin of managed news? Were
its members in tfie employ of
the Wilbur Hall social chairmen,
as widespread rumors imply?
How else, we ask, could such in
justice go unheeded? Obviously,
the committee's suggestion that

serve only to glut the market.
Instead of 60 per cent out of ac

Dear Mr. Beck:
In answer to your question, "is
the AWS really necessary?" I
must reply that I think that it
is. Otherwise I would not waste
my time. The AWS fulfills a need
of the women students at this
university in that it provides con
tact and communication among
the women, both generally and
in small groups, that is provided
for the men through the IFC and
the ICC.
It provides us with the oppor
tunity to speak with a united
voice when meeting with the ad
ministration and other groups.
AWS also provides for the women
an organization in which they
can actively participate and as
sume the responsibility of self
government.
The most evident facet of self
government is found in the social
regulations. They were originally
proposed by the women to the ad
ministration and are subject to
constant reevaluation and change
by the women. They are liberal
rules, liberally interpreted and lib
erally enforced. We have shown
the administration that we can
govern this area of our lives. It
is a rare occasion when the ad
ministration feels that it must
oppose our policy.
The housing committee, which
you accuse of "running from
dorm to dorm with hammer and
nails," does not do that at all.
The university provides a main
tenance crew. Rather the com
mittee works to educate the uni
versity as to the kind of housing
women would like (members of
the committee sat on the planning
board which has drawn up plans
for new housing to be built in the
future); and agitates for improve
ments in existing housing. The
committee also works to provide
the women with things like trans
fer meal tickets at times the wom
en want. It has been successful,
last year we were able to change
the time of meal transfers from
weekend to weekdays.
We also invite speakers to cam
pus. As you know, there is no
lack of speakers on campus.
Therefore we try to provide pro
grams that will appeal specifically
to women, programs that will in
some way. even if it is only in
how one can improve her appear
ance, enrich the lives of women.
As to your accusation of a lack
<>l interest in AWS as exempli
fied in the elections last spring,
827 out of 1,600 undergraduate
women voted in the AWS presi
dential election, which you will
find is a higher percentage than
students voting in the ASSU
presidential election. The posts of
corresponding and recording sec
retaries were filled by write in
vote The Fleet ion Committee and

the Daily did not announce that
; Marilyn Jensen and Sue Hater
won these posts until a week after
the other results were announced.

• Deprived Dollies
Dear Sir:
Shocked we were, thoroughly
j shocked, at how depraved er,
deprived is the social life of
The Stanford Dolly, frosh or
I otherwise. Can it be so that as
much as 60 per cent of the popu
j lation of certain dormitories
simnlv ve'/ctatc in their stalls on

Friday eve awaiting the Great
Gods of the Social Whirl to bless
them with a phone call? Dis
tressing it is to contemplate that
ihesc lovely Dollies, always metic
ulous about their appearance, al
ways presenting a pleasant as
pect to their fellow studenls, un
tiringly friendly, real "51-per
cent-of-<he-way"ers all, should be
committed to such a fate,
BUT WHAT disturbs us most
is that a supposedly conscientious
faculty committee, after exten
sive study of campus problems,
failed to report this crisis in its
findings. Could this committee
be guilty of the currently popu
lar sin of managed news? Were
its members in tfie employ of
the Wilbur Hall social chairmen,
as widespread rumors imply?
How else, we ask, could such in
justice go unheeded? Obviously,
the committee's suggestion that
more females be admitted would
serve only to glut the market.
Instead of 60 per cent out of ac
tion there would be 70 or per
haps even 80 per cent in the .Roble
Orphanage come Friday night.
OF COURSK, there is always
the possibility that one night one
of the more perceptive Dollies,
seized with some uncommon cour
age, might suggest to her peers,
"Maybe it's us. Maybe we should
drop our demand for deification
prior to accepting a date. Maybe
we shouldn't insist on two weeks
notice. Maybe we should allow
at least three hours before his
arrival to break a date." Such
suggestions would undoubterly
lead to the formation of a com
mittee among the girls, a com
mittee firmly dedicated to its
task.
The next morning would find
Our Crusader tarred and feath
ered and crudely impaled on one
of Ihe upper limbs of Mem Claw,

Dear Mr. Beck:
In answer to your question, "is
the AWS really necessary?" I
must reply that I think that it
is. Otherwise I would not waste
my time. The AWS fulfills a need
of the women students at this
university in that it provides con
tact and communication among
the women, both generally and
in small groups, that is provided
for the men through the IFC and
the ICC.
It provides us with the oppor
tunity to speak with a united
voice when meeting with the ad
ministration and other groups.
AWS also provides for the women
an organization in which they
can actively participate and as
sume the responsibility of self
government.
The most evident facet of self
government is found in the social
regulations. They were originally
proposed by the women to the ad
ministration and are subject to
constant reevaluation and change
by the women. They are liberal
rules, liberally interpreted and lib
erally enforced. We have shown
the administration that we can
govern this area of our lives. It
is a rare occasion when the ad
ministration feels that it must
oppose our policy.
The housing committee, which
you accuse of "running from
dorm to dorm with hammer and
nails," does not do that at all.
The university provides a main
tenance crew. Rather the com
mittee works to educate the uni
versity as to the kind of housing
women would like (members of
the committee sat on the planning
board which has drawn up plans
for new housing to be built in the
future); and agitates for improve
ments in existing housing. The
committee also works to provide
the women with things like trans
fer meal tickets at times the wom
en want. It has been successful,
last year we were able to change
the time of meal transfers from
weekend to weekdays.
We also invite speakers to cam
pus. As you know, there is no
lack of speakers on campus.
Therefore we try to provide pro
grams that will appeal specifically
to women, programs that will in
some way. even if it is only in
how one can improve her appear
ance, enrich the lives of women.
As to your accusation of a lack
<>l interest in AWS as exempli
fied in the elections last spring,
827 out of 1,600 undergraduate
women voted in the AWS presi
dential election, which you will
find is a higher percentage than
students voting in the ASSU
presidential election. The posts of
corresponding and recording sec
retaries were filled by write in
vote The Fleet ion Committee and

the Daily did not announce that
; Marilyn Jensen and Sue Hater
won these posts until a week after
the other results were announced.
.: This year we have had no
I trouble in generating interest in
; out programs. We have had to ex
. pand the number of interview
; times for committee tryouts to
i j accommodate interested women,
t ! We had over two hundred women
I attend Mrs. Kahn's talk yester
day, which I feel is not a s mall
, i group and is a larger audience
than many campus speakers
I draw.
I do not think that AWS is a
I useless organization. We do not
I sit around and do nothing but
think up ways to spend the SI, 175
that the ASSU provides us. The
I budget is published, and I am
available to explain it to you. We
are continuing to find ways to ex
ploit the full potential of the or
ganization. This year we have al
j ready expanded our committees
and their scope of action. Your
concern in my spending a frus
■ (rated year is appreciated, but I
have already found that the office
is a rewarding experience and I
jam sure that it will continue to
j be so.
