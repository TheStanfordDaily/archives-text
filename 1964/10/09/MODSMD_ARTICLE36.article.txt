# OVERSEAS CAMPUSES
## 'Education Italian Style' Produces Mixed Results 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate' Editor 
"Don't knock Ihe system," ad
vised a veteran overseas cam
puses' professor to the students
of Italy VIII one morning 1 hi s
summer, "it's the best one avail
able."
Six months at the Villa San
Paolo in Florence make one doubt
the complete veracity of this
statement. Certainly the Overseas
Campus Program is the best mass
program available. But many stu
dents would have preferred to
live and work with Italians. To
them, the symbol of the present
program is the barbed wire fenc
ing atop the Villa's garden wall.
One wonders whether it is
meant to keep the students in or
the natives out â€”or both.
Isolation
Actually, the barbed wire isn't
necessary, since the Florentines
are too proud to be excited by
the prospect of hosting Ameri
cans; and student initiative is soon
dulled by t'-e languid climate and
I he congenial coed living environ
ment.
The common retort from the
Administration is that students
with initiative can break down
the barriers, but at the Villa San
Paolo three of the four courses
are in English and one lives, eats
and speaks with 79 other Ameri
cans.
Some try and succeed in find
ing more Uian a few nominal
friends. And the girls have no
trouble meeting the boys al
though most of these cultural ex
changes start with a pinch on a
packed Florentine bus. For the
most pari, however, meaningful
contact is almost nonexistent.
"Fislibowl" Acquaintances
The result, then, is a very pleas
ant six months' existence in an
environment variously called ihc
"fishbowl" or the "ghetto" an
environment that teaches the stu
dent, albeit accidentally, more
about his fellow students than the
Italians.
When 80 students of diverse in
terests are stuck in one building
in a foreign country together for
two quarters, they are naturally
exposed to personalities and phil
osophies that many either
shunned or missed back on th e
Quad. Some form cliques in an
attempt to re-establish the shel
tered life back home, but most
find their horizons broadened, and
all learn tolerance, if nothing else.
Thus one gains a deeper insight
into American "culture" as well
as European.
Aside from the unintended ad
vantage of membership in the
group, the present mass program
offers benefits inherent in any
project of its size.
In May, there was a well-or
ganize d, excellent ly guided,
twleve-day field trip in Greece
for only $13. Italy VIII took a
shorter and cheaper trip of simi
lar quality to Venice in August.

An extremely well taught art ;
history lecture series prepared
the students for the numerous!
museum and gallery tours and
enabled them to appreciate as well !
as wonder at Renaissance genius, j
Above all, the Villa became a '
home of sorts to which the weary j
weekend traveller could return to j
rest and meditate and study.
No Time For Studies
This last occupation, studying,
was not too popular at the Villa, j
Unfortunately, one simply cannot
do justice to a IG-unit load while [
taking every weekend off to
travel.
Yet the Administration shows
signs ot giving up the pretense |
that the Overseas Campuses are
places where students can travel j
and handle a regular course load 1
at the same time.
In practice, the work is lighter I
and the grades come easier. One
girl suggested that, "Instead of
giving us four required courses,
they should only require iwo of
them and give us a choice on the I
third. That way, we would still!
have a choice in courses. Although
the overall work load would be!
lighter, we could cover three sub-1
jecls adequately instead of four j
superficially."
Some students have even more j
radical suggestions, but all the
dissidents agree that the faults j
of the program are inherent in |
its 'mass' character.
Should Be Supplemented
This is not to say that the pres- j
ent program should be discarded.
It is well suited for the many who
have neither the time nor the de-j
sire to master a language or ad-1
just to a different culture. Rather,
it should be supplemented with
a program patterned after the
Junior year aboard programs
offered by many universities.
When the first Italy group re- !
turned home four years ago, they
published a booklet to be used by
succeeding groups entitled But
Not As Tourists.
They were partially correct, i
One learns more about Italy and :
about one's contemporaries in six
months at the Villa than the
average tourist would. Yet for
those who refuse to consider re
vamping or supplementing the
present program the following
lines should have a sobering ef
fect. They are from a sonnet writ
ten by an Italy Campus professor
about his students' vaunted "Eu
ropean experience."
"Just as your faith in possibility
Sends you careening past Etrus
can ruins
Trusting an unknown driver's
sanity
While reading Kafka on the road
to Rome
Just as you trail Jake Barnes to
vanity
Run through Pamplona and take
pennants home.
So I accept the racing tourist's
thesis
That meditation starts when mo
tion ceases."
