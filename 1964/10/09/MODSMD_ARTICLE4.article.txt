Perhaps a job interview would he tlie last thing to expect on
television, vet, video-tape made it possible lor a young physician
to apply for a Stanford School of Medicine position last summer
while 3000 miles away.
The novel TV-taped interview was suggested and recorded by

Columbia University's Dr. James
11. Ryan to save a Stanford De
partment of psychiatry applicant
an expensive cross-country trip.
AS l)R. RYAN fired the ques
tions, the 75-minute interview was

i video-taped on a new reusable
| Precision Instrument Co. tape
which could be played back on a
i Stanford machine at a cost of less
J than a dollar per hour.
Dr. Thomas A. Gonda, Stanford
j associate professor of psychiatry
and chairman of the Resident
Selection Committee, commented,
"Interviews can be scheduled for
the convenience of the busy com
mittee members as a group, or
even one or two members at a
time. Either way, TV recording
presents committee members the
identical interview on which de
cisions can be made."
HITHERTO, a personal inter
view has been considered a
"must" for applicants to residency
in the Stanford Department of
Psychiatry. The department ac
cepts a do/en post-MDs in res
idency each year, yet more than
100 applications are received. The
interview is important because a
j resident must work daily with
: faculty and staff.
The prospect remains that many
a Stanford student will someday
; be interviewed for a job by tele
vision it's the next best thing
to being there. But a new method
does not guarantee admission any
more than the old: the Columbia
applicant was not one of the final
i d< i/en.
