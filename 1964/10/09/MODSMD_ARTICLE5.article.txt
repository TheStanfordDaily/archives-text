### JIM HAUSER 
Dr. D. F. Tuttle, professor of
electrical engineering and faculty
resident of Muir and Burbank
Houses in Stern, is teaching a new
seminar course this quarter in
the Department of the Humani
ties.
The 15 course members have

I been given freedom to choose the
subject and to compile tho read
ing list for the course. One unit
; credit is optional.
THE COURSE, humanities 175,
, Individual Work, meets Monday
j nights, 7:30 to 9 o'clock in Dr.
Tuttle's living room. Punch and
i cookies are served after each
j meeting.
"Il is a senior colloquium not
restricted to seniors," Dr. Tuttle
said.
Dr. Tuttle organized the semi
nal' on his own initiative, "because
there has been voiced some dis
: satisfaction with the senior collo
j quia, both by faculty and s t u
| dents."
TIIE NEW COURSE provides
: the close student-teacher relation
ship of the colloquia without the
restrictions of membership and
i subject material.
Fifteen residents of Stern
Houses are enrolled in the course.
! Eleven are taking credit. Four
elected to "sit in" and do the work
lor the benefit of small group
discussion.
Grading and tests have not yet
been fixed, but no papers wil be
1 required.
AT THE FIRST meeting of the
course last Monday, the members
I chose "modern morality" as the
'discussion theme for the quarter.
The Screwtape Eellers by C. S.
Lewis will be the first work read.
The students will choose a sec
ond work when they feel they
have sufficiently discussed the
first.
Dr. Tuttle said that his course
is not the first of this kitid to be
! given at Stanford, but the number
lof such courses is small. The
seminar is designed to bring edu
cation out of the classroom and
into the dormitory.
MORE THAN one fourth of the
! new seminar members are fresh
i men. Majors represent depart
ments from physics to history to
l "undeclared."
For this quarter, the seminar
is restricted to Stern residents,
, but, if interest continues, Dr. Tut
tle said, an exchange with a wom
en's residence may be arranged
