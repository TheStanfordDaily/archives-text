# McBride Bids LASSU Return to Leadership
## Legislature Cast In Critic's Role 
### 
ASS I President Scot t McHride
opened the 1964-65 session of
the Legislature last night with
a plea that the new members
make LASSU regain is appro
priate position of leadership on
this campus."
The inaugural address delt pri
marily with the problem of im
proving LASSU's performance
over that of tho past two years.
MrKKIDK fiAVK three reasons
why this improvement is neces
sary. First that it is "an integral
part of our tripartite system;"
Second that it is the Legislature
which is closest to the student
body and to campus opinion. And
third, that it is an effective Leg
islature which can make student
government "a respected force on
campus."
Calling upon LASSU to serve
in the role of critic of the univer
sity community, McHride told the
opening session that to fulfill that
obligation requires detailed re
search and evaluation.
"It is because of this need for
detailed evaluation and subse
quent action that the Legislature,
must be the critic of the univer
sity." ho said. "You are equipped
to bo an effective critic. You are
in close touch with the student
body, and you have the political
status to obtain information.'"
HE ADDED, "Criticism without
contemplating action is idle dis
cussion. Legislature, because it is
a Legislature, is empowered to
act upon its evaluation and thus
make criticism a worthwhile ac
tivity."
After hearing McBride's ad-1
dress the Legislature adjourned
for five minutes, and then held a |
second meeting. This was done in 1
order that a speaker be elected j
next week. ASSU by-laws require j
that the speaker be elected at the j
third meeting.
AT THE SECOND meeting!
some minor business was handled, j
and certain Presidential appoint-'
ments were approved, including I
the appointment of Ed Shaw, for- j
met'student financial manager, to
fill a vacant off-campus seat.
A reception was held for all j
LASSU representatives at the;
Alumni House after the meeting, i
The purpose of the reception was
to allow the LASSU members to)
meet deans Wert, Winbigler, and j
Gordon and to talk with poten-!
tial candidates for the speaker
ship of LASSU.
To date three representatives
have announced their intention to j
run for the speakership: Andy
Williams, Clyde Christoffcrson, i
and Ed Shaw.
ASSU President Scott McBride [
expressed satisfaction with the j
choice offered by those who have!
announced so far. "All are quali
fied for the job," lie said.
THE DAILY has offered space
to these and other candidates for
a three hundred word statement,
to'be run in Wednesday's news-j
paper. Those wishing to have ]
such a statement printed should !
hand it in by Monday at 2 p.m. I

ASS I President Scot t McHride
opened the 1964-65 session of
the Legislature last night with
a plea that the new members
make LASSU regain is appro
priate position of leadership on
this campus."
The inaugural address delt pri
marily with the problem of im
proving LASSU's performance
over that of tho past two years.
MrKKIDK fiAVK three reasons
why this improvement is neces
sary. First that it is "an integral
part of our tripartite system;"
Second that it is the Legislature
which is closest to the student
body and to campus opinion. And
third, that it is an effective Leg
islature which can make student
government "a respected force on
campus."
Calling upon LASSU to serve
in the role of critic of the univer
sity community, McHride told the
opening session that to fulfill that
obligation requires detailed re
search and evaluation.
"It is because of this need for
detailed evaluation and subse
quent action that the Legislature,
must be the critic of the univer
sity." ho said. "You are equipped
to bo an effective critic. You are
in close touch with the student
body, and you have the political
status to obtain information.'"
HE ADDED, "Criticism without
contemplating action is idle dis
cussion. Legislature, because it is
a Legislature, is empowered to
act upon its evaluation and thus
make criticism a worthwhile ac
tivity."
After hearing McBride's ad-1
dress the Legislature adjourned
for five minutes, and then held a |
second meeting. This was done in 1
order that a speaker be elected j
next week. ASSU by-laws require j
that the speaker be elected at the j
third meeting.
AT THE SECOND meeting!
some minor business was handled, j
and certain Presidential appoint-'
ments were approved, including I
the appointment of Ed Shaw, for- j
met'student financial manager, to
fill a vacant off-campus seat.
A reception was held for all j
LASSU representatives at the;
Alumni House after the meeting, i
The purpose of the reception was
to allow the LASSU members to)
meet deans Wert, Winbigler, and j
Gordon and to talk with poten-!
tial candidates for the speaker
ship of LASSU.
To date three representatives
have announced their intention to j
run for the speakership: Andy
Williams, Clyde Christoffcrson, i
and Ed Shaw.
ASSU President Scott McBride [
expressed satisfaction with the j
choice offered by those who have!
announced so far. "All are quali
fied for the job," lie said.
THE DAILY has offered space
to these and other candidates for

to'be run in Wednesday's news-j
paper. Those wishing to have ]
