The Most Important Question Ever Asked
The most important question a man can ask is, ' How can
I know God personally?" The rich young ruler questioned
Jesus, saying, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?' (Luke
18:18). The jailkeeper in ancient Philippi fearfully asked Paul
during a prison riot essentially the same question, ' What must
I do to be saved?" (Acts 16:30)
In a recent survey it was discovered that though 92.1 %
of American college students said they knew more about Jesus
than any other religious leader, with 62.7% stating they be
lieved Jesus to be the Son of God, the Savior, 89.1 % said they
did not know how to become Christians.
The National Collegiate Religious Survey was taken by
trained personnel who interviewed 10,500 college students on
scores of campuses in 17 states over a period of three years.
Perhaps you are one of the nearly 90% who are in ques
tion as to how you may know Christ as your Savior and Lord.
Commitment to Christ, as in the marriage relationship, in
volves the intellect, the emotions, and the will. Mutual respect
and even love for one another does not equal marriage. Mar
riage becomes a reality when the partners commit themselves
to each other by an expression of the will, "I do, until death
do us part."
In like manner, commitment to Christ involves more than
an intellectual acceptance of Christ as God's Son. There is even
more than an intellectual acceptance plus an emotional re
sponse. Commitment to Christ involves the will—one becomes
a Christian only when he surrenders control of all that he
knows of himself to all that he knows of Christ.
"He that has the Son has life; he that has not the Son has
not life." (I John 5:12) in John's Gospel, we are assured when
we receive Christ that we become members of God's family.
(John 1:12)
The answer to the greatest question one can ask, then, is
that we must receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord by per
sonal invitation. Why not answer this question in the realm of
your own life, and experience today and in prayer surrender
the control of yourself—intellect, will, and emotions—to Jesus
Christ now?

I do to be saved?" (Acts 16:30)
In a recent survey it was discovered that though 92.1 %
of American college students said they knew more about Jesus
than any other religious leader, with 62.7% stating they be
lieved Jesus to be the Son of God, the Savior, 89.1 % said they
did not know how to become Christians.
The National Collegiate Religious Survey was taken by
trained personnel who interviewed 10,500 college students on
scores of campuses in 17 states over a period of three years.
Perhaps you are one of the nearly 90% who are in ques
tion as to how you may know Christ as your Savior and Lord.
Commitment to Christ, as in the marriage relationship, in
volves the intellect, the emotions, and the will. Mutual respect
and even love for one another does not equal marriage. Mar
riage becomes a reality when the partners commit themselves
to each other by an expression of the will, "I do, until death
do us part."
In like manner, commitment to Christ involves more than
an intellectual acceptance of Christ as God's Son. There is even
more than an intellectual acceptance plus an emotional re
sponse. Commitment to Christ involves the will—one becomes
a Christian only when he surrenders control of all that he
knows of himself to all that he knows of Christ.
"He that has the Son has life; he that has not the Son has
not life." (I John 5:12) in John's Gospel, we are assured when
we receive Christ that we become members of God's family.
(John 1:12)
The answer to the greatest question one can ask, then, is
that we must receive Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord by per
sonal invitation. Why not answer this question in the realm of
your own life, and experience today and in prayer surrender
the control of yourself—intellect, will, and emotions—to Jesus
Christ now?

The Most Important Question Ever Asked
The most important question a man can ask is, ' How can
I know God personally?" The rich young ruler questioned
Jesus, saying, "What must I do to inherit eternal life?' (Luke
18:18). The jailkeeper in ancient Philippi fearfully asked Paul
during a prison riot essentially the same question, ' What must
I do to be saved?" (Acts 16:30)
