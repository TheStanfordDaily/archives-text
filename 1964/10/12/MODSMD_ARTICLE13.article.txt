# HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?
## Cards Hoot Over Owl Upset 
### 
A happy hut not overjoyed
hunch of Stanford football play
ers crowded into the dressing
room following their 34-7 mas
sacre of Rice Saturday and tried
to figure out how they had done
it.
"Rice just got desperate near
the end of the game," said line
backer Jack Chappie, who ran
back an intercepted pass in the
third quarter for a touchdown
which started the Indians rolling.
Defensive curl Guy Rounsavillo,
who intercepted two more Owl
passes tone for a touchdown),
agreed. "Their quarterbacks
weren't too good. They just
dropped Ihe b;di right in my
hands, that's all," he said matter
of-factly.
COACII John Ralston men
tioned that during halflimo he
decided to drop the defensive ends
away from the line. Five pass in
terceptions resulting. He indicated
that the lopsided score wasn't
really a true reflection of the
teams' strengths. "It was just a
case of the ball bouncing our
way," he said. "Without the
breaks the game would have
ended around 10-7 or 17-7 our fa
vor. But this time we gave Rice
the breaks and still came back to
win. I have the feeling that Ihe
team has finally jelled."
Quarterback Dick Berg, whose
39-yard run set up a 4th quarter
field goal, said, "I've never been
out in the open like that before,
so I didn't know what to do. I'm
used to running from way back.
Say coach ,they caught me from
the side, didn't they?" A voice
called out, "No, they caught you

from waaaay back." "Oh, no, not
again," wailed Berg.
Concerning next week's home
clash with the Washington Husk

ies, Berg, who comes from Puyal
lup, Washington, vowed, "I've
waited 21 years of my life to beat
Washington. Next Saturday is it."
