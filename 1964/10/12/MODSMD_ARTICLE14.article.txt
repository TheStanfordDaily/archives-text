### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The Tribe water poloists swam
ever the heads of the visiting Cal
Bears 21-4 last Friday to register
victory number one for the 1964
season. Stanford's undefeated sea
son lasted less than 24 hours,
however, as Foothill College took
a tight 8-6 contest Saturday morn
ing.
Bill Ready led the Bear-baiting
on Friday, scoring five goals for
the Indians. Tom Chalberg was
close behind in the scoring column
with four tallies.
DEFENSE was the story of the
first quarter, as each team scored
only once. The second period
brought an explosive Stanford
team out of the huddle. Mike
Kshelman twice hurled the yellow
ball past the Cal goalie, and
Ready and Chalberg scored once
each.
The Indian's also dominated
the third quarter on the strength
of Bill Ready's two goals. In Ihe
final period it was Tom Chal
berg's turn to score twice, a n d
Stanford wrapped up its first vic
tory
BILL READY, newly elected
varsity captain, and Mike Exhel
man scored twice apiece to ac
count for two thirds of Stanford's
goals in Ihe Foothill contest.
Stanford goalies Jim Ellis and
Mike Sorem put in a fine per
formance with 11 saves.
Stanford drew first blood early
in the game, as Bill Ready scored
on a fast break after Stanford
won the sprint. Ready's second
goal ended the Cards' scoring in
the first period, while Foothill
tallied three times.
Foothill's 3-2 lead was cushioned
in the second quarter, leaving the
halftime score at 5-3. The margin
was further padded to 7-4 in the
third quarter.
THE TRIBE came charging
back in the final period. Tom
Chalberg was fouled while in
scoring position and scored on
the resulting penalty throw. Mike
Eshelman tossed in his second
goal.
With less than a minute to go,
the score was 7-6, Foothill on top.
Foothill got the ball and played a
control game, tossing the ball
back and fort between their goalie
and two or three players. Then,
in the waning seconds of Ihe
game, Foothill's Greg Nielsen put
in his fourth goal of the game
to assure a tense Foothill victory.
