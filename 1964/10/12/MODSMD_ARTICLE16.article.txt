# The 						Sino-Soviet Split— A Cautious Appraisal
## 
### 
The most widely reported "conclusion ol
last week's Hoover Conference was that the age
of monolithic Communism has ended and that
"the intensification of conflict and disunity with
in the Communist camp seems inevitable."
At this juncture such a conclusion is quilt'
justified: a rift has developed due to national,
factional, and ideological (or at least strategic)
differences within the party; and in some coun
tries, as in Brazil, the competing factions have
split completely into separate parties.
But as several Hoover Conference partici
pants urged, we should be quite cautious in
assessing the Sino-So\ iet split, taking care neither
to misjudge its nature nor to be unduh optimistic
about its consequences.
It should be kept in mind, to begin with,
that the Soviet Union and Communist China
retain the common goal of a world socialist or
der to be effected through defeat of the capitalist
system.
Even in face of a bitter national rivalry, an
intense struggle for control of the movement,
and disagreement over tactics, this common
goal has prevented a complete break between
Moscow and Peking.
The Soviet Union, for example, is working
with Chinese agents in subversive efforts in Zan
zibar, Latin America (through Castro), and
the Congo. In Southeast Asia, the USSR is sup
plying arms to Indonesia for aggression in Ma
laysia, aggression praised by Peking.
An even more important consideration in
examining the Sino-Soviet split is that neither
the Soviet nor the Chinese concepts of immedi
ate Cold War tactics can offer the West much
comfort—in fact the rift may increase the net
danger of subversion and war.
The USSR's emphasis on "peaceful coexist
ence, as some Hoover participants pointed out,
is most probably a tactical gambit. Rather than
meaning a detente, as some would like to be
lieve, it signifies a greater emphasis on "safe
means of advancing the revolution.
These include "popular front'" efforts in more
advanced nations and economic aid, "popular

uprisings, and "wars of liberation directed to
ward the eventual takeover of neutralist and
underdeveloped areas.
\\ itliin the doctrine of "peaceful coexistence"
the attempt is always made to use proxies or in
direct agents in fomenting discontent in order
not to detract from Soviet claims of being the
great power for peace. This "soft" approach
means greater maneuverability and promotes
false Western hopes for a settlement.
Red China, on the other hand, does not agree
that the Soviet tactics are effective an d
favors a more militant, aggressive policy, press
ing forward on all fronts. That this poses a new
and potentially overwhelming threat is apparent
from the following considerations;
• Bed China is a master at guerilla warfare,
a method for the gradual takeover of a country
and its people which the United States has yet
to counter effectively.
• The Chinese, as uninvolved observers, are
in a good position to take advantage of the racial
tensions of Africa and parts of Latin America by
exploiting anti-white sentiment.
• By striving to build an independent net
work of Peking-oriented Communist parties, the
Chinese will supplement existing "soft on capi
talism parties with new and more threatening
subversive organizations.
For the first time, Communists can have
it both ways—potentially victorious "popular
front political parties as well as unpopular sub
versive groups dedicated to creating chaos and
intensifying existing dissatisfaction.
Thus, while it is true that a monolithic Com
munist movement no longer exists, let us not
assume, in a fit of wishful thinking, that the Cold
War is over or that the threat has in any way
lessened.
On the contrary, although this internecine:
struggle has had its weakening effects on the
Communist movement, it has also broadened the I
spectrum of Cold War techniques and may re-;
suit in a new wave of overt and covert subver- j
sive efforts. We cannot afford to underestimate I
the potential danger of this development.

the attempt is always made to use proxies or in
direct agents in fomenting discontent in order
not to detract from Soviet claims of being the
great power for peace. This "soft" approach
means greater maneuverability and promotes
false Western hopes for a settlement.
Red China, on the other hand, does not agree
that the Soviet tactics are effective an d
favors a more militant, aggressive policy, press
ing forward on all fronts. That this poses a new
and potentially overwhelming threat is apparent
from the following considerations;
• Bed China is a master at guerilla warfare,
a method for the gradual takeover of a country
and its people which the United States has yet
to counter effectively.
• The Chinese, as uninvolved observers, are
in a good position to take advantage of the racial
tensions of Africa and parts of Latin America by
exploiting anti-white sentiment.
• By striving to build an independent net
work of Peking-oriented Communist parties, the
Chinese will supplement existing "soft on capi
talism parties with new and more threatening
subversive organizations.
For the first time, Communists can have
it both ways—potentially victorious "popular
front political parties as well as unpopular sub
versive groups dedicated to creating chaos and
intensifying existing dissatisfaction.
Thus, while it is true that a monolithic Com
munist movement no longer exists, let us not
assume, in a fit of wishful thinking, that the Cold
War is over or that the threat has in any way
lessened.
On the contrary, although this internecine:
struggle has had its weakening effects on the
Communist movement, it has also broadened the I
spectrum of Cold War techniques and may re-;
suit in a new wave of overt and covert subver- j
sive efforts. We cannot afford to underestimate I
the potential danger of this development.
The most widely reported "conclusion ol
last week's Hoover Conference was that the age
of monolithic Communism has ended and that
"the intensification of conflict and disunity with
in the Communist camp seems inevitable."
At this juncture such a conclusion is quilt'
justified: a rift has developed due to national,
factional, and ideological (or at least strategic)
differences within the party; and in some coun
tries, as in Brazil, the competing factions have
split completely into separate parties.
But as several Hoover Conference partici
pants urged, we should be quite cautious in
assessing the Sino-So\ iet split, taking care neither
to misjudge its nature nor to be unduh optimistic
about its consequences.
It should be kept in mind, to begin with,
that the Soviet Union and Communist China
retain the common goal of a world socialist or
der to be effected through defeat of the capitalist
system.
Even in face of a bitter national rivalry, an
intense struggle for control of the movement,
and disagreement over tactics, this common
goal has prevented a complete break between
Moscow and Peking.
The Soviet Union, for example, is working
with Chinese agents in subversive efforts in Zan
zibar, Latin America (through Castro), and
the Congo. In Southeast Asia, the USSR is sup
plying arms to Indonesia for aggression in Ma
laysia, aggression praised by Peking.
An even more important consideration in
examining the Sino-Soviet split is that neither
the Soviet nor the Chinese concepts of immedi
ate Cold War tactics can offer the West much
comfort—in fact the rift may increase the net
danger of subversion and war.
The USSR's emphasis on "peaceful coexist
ence, as some Hoover participants pointed out,
is most probably a tactical gambit. Rather than
meaning a detente, as some would like to be
lieve, it signifies a greater emphasis on "safe
means of advancing the revolution.
These include "popular front'" efforts in more
advanced nations and economic aid, "popular

uprisings, and "wars of liberation directed to
ward the eventual takeover of neutralist and
underdeveloped areas.
