## Murphy-Salinger Debate: A Campaign Humor Spot 
### Steve Leopold 
Among the more humorous—and en lightening—evcuts of the '64
campaign so far has been the Murphy-Salinger debate. In it one
could see briel Hashes of what a kcnncdy-Goklwater confronta
tion would have been like.
Not that Pierre Salinger is am Kennedy; though competent

I and hard working, he has neither
! I tie rhetoric nor the charisma of
i the late President. And certainly
| even Goldwater is belter informed
that his bumbling representative
in California, George Murphy, a
man who during the debate looked
; like an actor performing without
j the aid of idiot cards, which, in
j fleed, he was.
1 EVEN" WITH these distinc
tions, the initial comparison is
valid. Murphy, like so many
j people who believe in that amor
phous blob termed Goldwaterism,
had a list of grievances, but just
like his ideological leader he
offered no specific alternatives.
During the whole debate, his only
specific proposal was for the de
salini/.ation of salt water. One
assumes that he was also in fa
vor of God. Mother and the Amer
ican flag, but then nobody has
proposed to do away with any of
these. Everything else, George
Murphy was against.
Another facet of Goldwaterism
that Murphy displayed was the
distressing Pavlavian reaction
produced in ultra-conservatives
when one mentions such catch
phrases as States' Rights or Pri
vate Enterprise. Significantly,
these men deal so exclusively in
catch phrases and generalities
that they are at a loss for words
when confronted with specifics.
The results can be humorous, as
well as pathetic, as Murphy
proved.
AT ONE POINT during the de
bate. Salinger asked his opponent
how he would have voted on the ■
hospital bill before the Sennato
one month ago. Murphy, con-j
fronted with a specific program,!
hemmed and hawed, declaring he j
wasn't against old folks at all.
After a few moments of such
stumbling it finally occurred to j
him that this bill might just have
something to do with Medicare.;
When Salinger agreed that it did,!
one could almost hear Murphy
sigh with relief. After running
off his set speech about the great- :
ness of the present system and I
the dangers inherent in such so
cialist endeavors as Medicare, he i
rather righteously proclaimed his
satisfaction that the Congress j
had defeated such legislation. 1

IT WAS HERE that Salinger
i deftly punctured Mr. Murphy's
moving plea and probably his
dream of being a US Senator
by making the challenger aware
| that the Congress had passed the
j bill in question.
This last shaft, though humor
ous to the politically indifferent,
simply illustrated the fact that:
Salinger had done his homework :
while Murphy had not. The previ- j
ous maneuverings more clearly
showed the main fault of the Gold
water philosophy.
A cry in the wilderness is no I
substitute for pragmatic pro- j
grams; the angry voice of protest I
is irrelevant if not accompanied
• by acceptable alternatives.
IN THIS WAY it is easy to see ;
i why a Kennedy-Goldwatcr de- j
bate or a Johnson-Goldwater de- j
i bate would have been worthless. I
The two men would have simply i
i talked on different planes. Nixon j
land Kennedy accepted the "rules
I of the game" which led to that
phenomenon known as "me-too
| ism," which is anathema to the
I Goldwater faction.
Goldwater, Murphy and friends ;
jdo not agree that the hallmark
! of conservatism is the support of'
! gradual — not radical — progress j
due to enlightened self-interest.
Their alternatives range from the
humorous and harmless (e.g., the I
desalinization of water) to the
paranoid and deadly. (Such as j
"perhaps" we should defoliate |
those supply lines in Indochina).
SINCE MOST Americans have I
too much respect — fear I sup- 1
pose the Goidwaterites would call
it for nuclear weapons to con- j
sider their use in any context ex
cept general war, and since most
Goldwater positions on TVA, So
cial Security and The Bomb
among others- are not debate
able in the opinion of most people,
including a majority of the Re
publicans in Congress, the cam
paign must therefore deal in per- j
sonalities and morals.
Goldwater can only call John-1
son a crook; Murphy can only !
call Salinger a carpetbagger. If j
this is our choice, give me an
echo.
