## 
### AUBIE BARTHOLD 
The Rice Owls, slated to beat
Stanford by twelve points Satur
day. left with their wings clipped ,
by an inspired Indian team. Stan-!
ford broke a 7-7 halftime tie wide
open with five interceptions which I
all led to either TD's or field
goals. The powerhouse Texan i
team with its highly touted de-1
tense found itself on the shortj
end of a 34-7 rout.
The outcome of the game was i
not apparent in the first half, j
Stanford fumbled three times to j
set up a Rice touchdown and to j
halt a good Indian drive on the!
Rice 18-yard line.
THE FIRST series of plays for j
Stanford ended when John Read j
fumbled on the Indian's own 26- i
yard line. A 12-yard pass play'

and the running of halfback Gene
Fleming took Rice down to the
one-yard line with a third down
situation, but a great effort by
the Card defense held Fleming
for no gain on two plays.
The Indians took over posses
sion. but again fumbled. Stanford
couldn't hold the Owls and on the
second play Rice quarterback Me-
Reynolds hit Fleming with a
swing pass for the TD. The con
version was good, and Rice led
7-0.
A 22-YARD kick-off return by
Middlekauff started another Stan
ford drive from their own 41-yard
line. A fifteen-yard pass play
from Berg to Connelly and the
running of Read and Handley
took the ball to the Rice 26 where
Berg passed to Dave Lewis at

the 12. Another Berg pass to
Handley put the ball on the two,
inches short of a first down.
Middlekauff get the needed yard
age, and three plays later Hand
ley carried the ball in for th e
score. Beck converted, tying the
score at 7-7.
IN THE SECOND half a de
fensive change by Stanford
dropped their ends off to help
on pass defense in the flat. This
move proved to be a decisive
one.
The Indians first drive of the
half found them on their own 26-
yard line with a fourth and 31
situation. However, a 68-yard,
line-drive punt by Dave Lewis
kept the Tribe out of trouble.
Rice and Stanford exchanged
punts, and the Owls started to
move from their 20-yard line.
With a third and 2 on the 39 Me-
Reynolds somehow decided to
pass. Jack Chappie, Stanford
guard, blocked the pass into the
air, caught it, and carried it into
the end zone.
Rice's next series fizzeled, but
so did Stanford's as the Cards
again fumbled. Ron Waldo, a new
Owl quarterback, quickly had one
of his passes intercepted on a
third and 26 attempt by Jake
Lodato, who returned the ball to
the Stanford 49-yard line. On the
second play Berg broke through
the middle on a quarterback de
lay to gain 39 yards. The Indians
were held on the Rice 3. On
fourth down Beck kicked a field
goal to make the score 17-7.
ON THE SEC OND play of the
Rice series Guy Rounsaville in
tercepted another Waldo pass and
returned it to the Rice 15-yard
line. Handley carried twice for
five yards to put tho ball on the
10. There, on the same tackle
