Stanford's first Summer Festival of Arts, which featured the
era ol Shakespeare and marked attendance at more than 67,000,
will be continued next summer with the production ol "The l'"ra of
Mozart.
Commenting on last summer's success, Festival Director Vir-

Gil Whitaker stated, "We really*
are "overjoyed at the warm sup
port with which our widespread »
audiences greeted our first of-j
forts. It certainly exceeded our
expectations in every way."
WITH THE "Era' of Mozart,":
the Summer Festival will present
a full exploration of the second
half of the eighteenth century
arts. Closely paralleling last sum
mer's festival, the Mo/art pro

. tival and to making Stanford a
cultural focus for the West."

sum m e r the emphasis will
shift to music, and in succeeding
