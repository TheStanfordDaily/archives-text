# Ancient Bones Are Identified
## 
### 
The fossil bones discovered at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center and pictured in last Tues
day's Daily arc definitely those of
a whale of the Miocene era, ac
cording 1o Dr. Earl Packard,
Stanford research associate and
paleontologist.
Packard said comparison of
the bone fragments with the Uni
versity's other fossil bones and
shells of the era made identifi
cation positive. The Miocene era
existed 20 to 30 million years ago.
In that geologic period, said
Packard, there were many local
shallow seas and the continents
were "in an emergent state."
Coastal California was much dif
ferent than it is today, and the
Coast Range as such did not exist.
The bones were found Oct. 2 by
a bulldozer wihch was scraping
out a channel to be used in the
construction of the accelerator.
