WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union laid
out its space cards yesterday, orbiting three
men in a mammoth spaceship.
Willi an already evident lead over th e
United States in the flight experience neces
sary to shoot for the moon, the Soviet Union
showed no signs of relaxing its space effort.
And despite more than a year's interval
since its last announced manned flight, the
Soviet Union's big new Sunrise spaceship
appears lo be a systematic step and an ex
travagant one—toward the moon.
Best guess: Its Sunrise spaceship with a
pilot, doctor and scientist aboard—would be
out to nearly double Soviet space experience
in the realm of weightlessness. The Soviets
did not say how long the flight would be. One
Moscow report said the craft might stay up
only two days.

higher in the outlawed Armed Forces of Na
tional Liberation. The sources said police did
not want to disclose the suspect's name until

WASHINGTON — The Soviet Union laid
out its space cards yesterday, orbiting three
men in a mammoth spaceship.

showed no signs of relaxing its space effort.
And despite more than a year's interval

Soviet Union's big new Sunrise spaceship
appears lo be a systematic step and an ex
travagant one—toward the moon.
Best guess: Its Sunrise spaceship with a

out to nearly double Soviet space experience
in the realm of weightlessness. The Soviets
did not say how long the flight would be. One
Moscow report said the craft might stay up
only two days.
