# "Unentered" Girl Wins Contest
## 
### 
This week's winner of t li e
Stanford Daily Pacific South
west Airlines football contest has
no idea how an entry blank with
her name on ii was placed in the
contest box.
Joan Ferguson, a senior classics
major living in Storey House,
maintains she did not submit an
entry which correctly picked the
winners of all six contest games
and predicted a 20-10 Stanford vic
tory over Rice in the tie-breaker,
games, but the guess of the
Stanford-Rice score on Miss Fer
guson's entry earned her th e
round-trip PSA ticket In Los An
geles.
Students who predicted the
winners of all seven contest
games are Barry Peterson, Lynne

Ludwig, Tim Cowles, Robert
Poirier, and Allen Anderson.
THE ENTRY blank for this
week's contest will be printed in
tomorrow's edition of The Daily.
The conlest; is open 1o all stu
dents, faculty, and staff members.
All entries must be placed in
the contest box in the Storke Pub
lications Building by fj p.m. Fri
day.
