## The 						Stanford Surprise Against UCLA, Rice 
### PETE EAKLAND 
After Stanford had played the first Hvo games of the season,
! not just a few Stanford rooters shrugged, "We!!, there goes the
easy part of our season. VVe may not win again all year." The In
dians had lost because of Clancy Williams' successful gamesman
ship maneuver to a Washington State Cougar squad that was ex
pected to bare its teeth this year but not attack a conference adver
sary with enough force to produce a victory and had only squeaked
by San Jose State in a neighborhood street fight showing only
occasional sparks of finesse. But Stanford's middle name is sur
prise.
UCLA promptly sent the Indians below the .500 mark: a condi
tion known as being in the Stanford Red. The Cards helped them
selves down the road to defeat by having three passes intercepted
and by a mix up in smoke signals on a potential winning play, bul
even discounting these misfortunes, Stanford, which played not only
a good but an outstanding game, could've won.
THREE POINTS OF VIEW
There are three points of view from which a college football
game can bo watched: the student's, the player's, and the sports
writer's. The player takes defeat hardest. Sitting in the locker room
after the game, he remembers with disgust missed assignments that
might have meant a TD or a first down, He realizes the hairline
difference between victory and defeat, and wonders how, wanting
to win so badly and playing so well, Ihe team could have had victory
snatched from its grasp by some indefensable turn of fate. He is
a bundle of emotion built of intensity resulting from physical exer
tion and tension. He extrapolates with optimism 1o Hie following
week.
The sportswriter has the goal of objectivity and conciseness
He describes things that happen, not things felt. At UCLA, objectiv
ity could not constrain the pride I had for Stanford's eleven as a
student. The terrible, but real fact of defeat was there but Stanford
had done things I had never seen it do.
THE NEW STANFORD
It came back time and time again. In all, Stanford was within
UCLA's 30-yard line eight times, five times within the ten.
Another feature of the game was tlie goalline defense of the
Indians. Tt never quite prevented the Bruins from reaching paydirt
but it almost took court action for UCLA to encroach on Stanford
real estate. With first downs on the 11, 5, 7, and 3-yard lines, the
Bruins needed four downs to put the ball across on two occasions
and three on the other two.
UCLA's last TD exemplifies the might of the forward wall. A
Bruin had returned Stanford's onside kick to the three. Zeno hit
the line for two, tried left guard again for no gain, sent his half
back straight ahead again for no gain, then resorted lo the pass
and flipped to his end in the corner of the endzonc for the clincher.
The defensive secondary, despite Zeno's performance, showed
some signs of improvement. John Guillory, timing a tackle perfectly
to coincide with the arrival of the ball, caused an on-target pass to
go as an incompletion. Playing in his initial game at defense this
year, Dick Ragsdale picked off a pass and played a fine game overall.
RICE OUT ON LIMB
The UCLA game was a prelude to the Rice upset. The things
that Stanford did well the week before, it did even better against
I the Owls, who found themselves out on the limb the entire second
half.
The line kept a check on the Rice running game. In fact, the line
cannot be given too much credit. Jack Chappie, on kickoffs, end runs,
and line plunges, of course, was outstanding. He got 16 tackles all
over the field, knocked away a pass over the middle in the first
half, and batted one up in the air in the second half which he then
intercepted. Also outstanding were the "down four:" Gary Petti
grew, Tom Ross, Mike Hibler, and Bob Nichols.
The goalline unit held off Rice for the required number of plays
after it had a first down on the Stanford ten.
The passing defense enjoyed a pleasant afternoon. This was due
to a combination of factors. Unlike UCLA, Rice doesn't make a habit
of putting the ball into the air more than it has to. It had to Satur
day, since it couldn't move on the ground. Also, the line put a tre
mendous rush on the passer. Several of the interceptions were indi
rectly attributed to jolts at the time the Rice quarterback released
the ball. The Indians were playing Little Big Horn with the Owl
passer serving as General Custer.
The pass defense finally solved its apparent weakness: flat passes.
In the regular Stanford defensive alignment, this territory is the
responsibility of the end. UCLA scored twice on flat passes. Rice
got its only TD via the same play. It isn't pleasant to get boat by
the same mistake in successive games so the coaches had the ends
play a bit looser in the second half. Result: five interceptions, three
by ends.
RALSTON HAPPY
The game was exremely gratifying to Coach John Ralston, who
saw his team come back to pile up ihe biggest winning margin of
his Stanford coaching career, after giving the Owls several oppor
tunities early in the game. Last year, notably against Oregon and
Washington State, Stanford was charitable in the early phases of
the game but did not have the ability to bounce back and eventually
change the tide. It has that quality this year. I hope it doesn't lose it.

THREE POINTS OF VIEW
There are three points of view from which a college football
game can bo watched: the student's, the player's, and the sports
writer's. The player takes defeat hardest. Sitting in the locker room
after the game, he remembers with disgust missed assignments that
might have meant a TD or a first down, He realizes the hairline
difference between victory and defeat, and wonders how, wanting
to win so badly and playing so well, Ihe team could have had victory
snatched from its grasp by some indefensable turn of fate. He is
a bundle of emotion built of intensity resulting from physical exer
tion and tension. He extrapolates with optimism 1o Hie following
week.
The sportswriter has the goal of objectivity and conciseness
He describes things that happen, not things felt. At UCLA, objectiv
ity could not constrain the pride I had for Stanford's eleven as a
student. The terrible, but real fact of defeat was there but Stanford
had done things I had never seen it do.
THE NEW STANFORD
It came back time and time again. In all, Stanford was within
UCLA's 30-yard line eight times, five times within the ten.
Another feature of the game was tlie goalline defense of the
Indians. Tt never quite prevented the Bruins from reaching paydirt
but it almost took court action for UCLA to encroach on Stanford
real estate. With first downs on the 11, 5, 7, and 3-yard lines, the
Bruins needed four downs to put the ball across on two occasions
and three on the other two.
UCLA's last TD exemplifies the might of the forward wall. A
Bruin had returned Stanford's onside kick to the three. Zeno hit
the line for two, tried left guard again for no gain, sent his half
back straight ahead again for no gain, then resorted lo the pass
and flipped to his end in the corner of the endzonc for the clincher.
The defensive secondary, despite Zeno's performance, showed
some signs of improvement. John Guillory, timing a tackle perfectly
to coincide with the arrival of the ball, caused an on-target pass to
go as an incompletion. Playing in his initial game at defense this
year, Dick Ragsdale picked off a pass and played a fine game overall.
RICE OUT ON LIMB
The UCLA game was a prelude to the Rice upset. The things
that Stanford did well the week before, it did even better against
I the Owls, who found themselves out on the limb the entire second
half.
The line kept a check on the Rice running game. In fact, the line
cannot be given too much credit. Jack Chappie, on kickoffs, end runs,
and line plunges, of course, was outstanding. He got 16 tackles all
over the field, knocked away a pass over the middle in the first
half, and batted one up in the air in the second half which he then
intercepted. Also outstanding were the "down four:" Gary Petti
grew, Tom Ross, Mike Hibler, and Bob Nichols.
The goalline unit held off Rice for the required number of plays
after it had a first down on the Stanford ten.
The passing defense enjoyed a pleasant afternoon. This was due
to a combination of factors. Unlike UCLA, Rice doesn't make a habit
of putting the ball into the air more than it has to. It had to Satur
day, since it couldn't move on the ground. Also, the line put a tre
mendous rush on the passer. Several of the interceptions were indi
rectly attributed to jolts at the time the Rice quarterback released
the ball. The Indians were playing Little Big Horn with the Owl
passer serving as General Custer.
The pass defense finally solved its apparent weakness: flat passes.
In the regular Stanford defensive alignment, this territory is the
responsibility of the end. UCLA scored twice on flat passes. Rice
got its only TD via the same play. It isn't pleasant to get boat by
the same mistake in successive games so the coaches had the ends
play a bit looser in the second half. Result: five interceptions, three
by ends.
RALSTON HAPPY
The game was exremely gratifying to Coach John Ralston, who
saw his team come back to pile up ihe biggest winning margin of
his Stanford coaching career, after giving the Owls several oppor
tunities early in the game. Last year, notably against Oregon and
Washington State, Stanford was charitable in the early phases of
the game but did not have the ability to bounce back and eventually
change the tide. It has that quality this year. I hope it doesn't lose it.
After Stanford had played the first Hvo games of the season,
! not just a few Stanford rooters shrugged, "We!!, there goes the
easy part of our season. VVe may not win again all year." The In
dians had lost because of Clancy Williams' successful gamesman
ship maneuver to a Washington State Cougar squad that was ex
pected to bare its teeth this year but not attack a conference adver
sary with enough force to produce a victory and had only squeaked
by San Jose State in a neighborhood street fight showing only
occasional sparks of finesse. But Stanford's middle name is sur
prise.
UCLA promptly sent the Indians below the .500 mark: a condi
tion known as being in the Stanford Red. The Cards helped them
selves down the road to defeat by having three passes intercepted
and by a mix up in smoke signals on a potential winning play, bul
even discounting these misfortunes, Stanford, which played not only
a good but an outstanding game, could've won.

had done things I had never seen it do.
THE NEW STANFORD
It came back time and time again. In all, Stanford was within
UCLA's 30-yard line eight times, five times within the ten.
Another feature of the game was tlie goalline defense of the
Indians. Tt never quite prevented the Bruins from reaching paydirt
but it almost took court action for UCLA to encroach on Stanford
real estate. With first downs on the 11, 5, 7, and 3-yard lines, the
Bruins needed four downs to put the ball across on two occasions
and three on the other two.
UCLA's last TD exemplifies the might of the forward wall. A
Bruin had returned Stanford's onside kick to the three. Zeno hit
the line for two, tried left guard again for no gain, sent his half
back straight ahead again for no gain, then resorted lo the pass
and flipped to his end in the corner of the endzonc for the clincher.
The defensive secondary, despite Zeno's performance, showed
some signs of improvement. John Guillory, timing a tackle perfectly
to coincide with the arrival of the ball, caused an on-target pass to
go as an incompletion. Playing in his initial game at defense this
year, Dick Ragsdale picked off a pass and played a fine game overall.
RICE OUT ON LIMB
The UCLA game was a prelude to the Rice upset. The things
that Stanford did well the week before, it did even better against
I the Owls, who found themselves out on the limb the entire second
half.
The line kept a check on the Rice running game. In fact, the line
cannot be given too much credit. Jack Chappie, on kickoffs, end runs,
and line plunges, of course, was outstanding. He got 16 tackles all
over the field, knocked away a pass over the middle in the first
half, and batted one up in the air in the second half which he then
intercepted. Also outstanding were the "down four:" Gary Petti
grew, Tom Ross, Mike Hibler, and Bob Nichols.
The goalline unit held off Rice for the required number of plays
after it had a first down on the Stanford ten.
The passing defense enjoyed a pleasant afternoon. This was due
to a combination of factors. Unlike UCLA, Rice doesn't make a habit
of putting the ball into the air more than it has to. It had to Satur
day, since it couldn't move on the ground. Also, the line put a tre
mendous rush on the passer. Several of the interceptions were indi
rectly attributed to jolts at the time the Rice quarterback released
the ball. The Indians were playing Little Big Horn with the Owl
passer serving as General Custer.
The pass defense finally solved its apparent weakness: flat passes.
In the regular Stanford defensive alignment, this territory is the
responsibility of the end. UCLA scored twice on flat passes. Rice
got its only TD via the same play. It isn't pleasant to get boat by
the same mistake in successive games so the coaches had the ends
play a bit looser in the second half. Result: five interceptions, three
by ends.
RALSTON HAPPY
The game was exremely gratifying to Coach John Ralston, who
saw his team come back to pile up ihe biggest winning margin of
his Stanford coaching career, after giving the Owls several oppor
tunities early in the game. Last year, notably against Oregon and
Washington State, Stanford was charitable in the early phases of
the game but did not have the ability to bounce back and eventually
change the tide. It has that quality this year. I hope it doesn't lose it.
After Stanford had played the first Hvo games of the season,
! not just a few Stanford rooters shrugged, "We!!, there goes the
easy part of our season. VVe may not win again all year." The In
dians had lost because of Clancy Williams' successful gamesman
ship maneuver to a Washington State Cougar squad that was ex
pected to bare its teeth this year but not attack a conference adver
sary with enough force to produce a victory and had only squeaked
by San Jose State in a neighborhood street fight showing only
occasional sparks of finesse. But Stanford's middle name is sur
prise.
UCLA promptly sent the Indians below the .500 mark: a condi
tion known as being in the Stanford Red. The Cards helped them
selves down the road to defeat by having three passes intercepted
and by a mix up in smoke signals on a potential winning play, bul
even discounting these misfortunes, Stanford, which played not only
a good but an outstanding game, could've won.
THREE POINTS OF VIEW
There are three points of view from which a college football
game can bo watched: the student's, the player's, and the sports
writer's. The player takes defeat hardest. Sitting in the locker room
after the game, he remembers with disgust missed assignments that
might have meant a TD or a first down, He realizes the hairline
difference between victory and defeat, and wonders how, wanting
to win so badly and playing so well, Ihe team could have had victory
snatched from its grasp by some indefensable turn of fate. He is
a bundle of emotion built of intensity resulting from physical exer
tion and tension. He extrapolates with optimism 1o Hie following
week.
The sportswriter has the goal of objectivity and conciseness
He describes things that happen, not things felt. At UCLA, objectiv
ity could not constrain the pride I had for Stanford's eleven as a
student. The terrible, but real fact of defeat was there but Stanford
had done things I had never seen it do.
