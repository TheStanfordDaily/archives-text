# Salinger Discusses Campaign
## Defends Demos Foreign Policy 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Senator Pierre Salinger "illu
minated the scenetv sniTOund
ing liis opponents foreign pol
icy and campaign tactics in a
speech yesterday to over 1.0(H)
students in Memorial Audito
rium.
Attacking Republican George
Murphy's charge that the U.S.
"hasn't had a foreign policy since
Potsdam," the 39-year-old former
press secretary to Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson, said that
America has had a "clear and re
sponsible program since World
War 11. a program of maintaining
our strength and firmness while
understanding that in the nuclear
ago it is impossible for any state,
especially the biggest, to refuse
to negotiate on matters of war
and peace."
"THIS is the cornerstone of our
foreign policy, the willingness to
sit down and talk about the issues
that divide us."
Salinger dealt with the foreign
policy of the Kennedy era in great
details, from the Bay of Pigs "a
tragic mistake and the only ma
jor defeat John Kennedy ever
suffered" — to the Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty "the thing the late
President will be remembered
longest for."
TURNING to today's problems,
he stressed the complexity of
such issues as the war in Viet
Nam: "Our only course is the
most difficult one the course we
are following now ... It requires
the patience and understanding
of the American people; but we
must continue. For if the Com
munists are successful, then 'wars
of liberation' will spring up
everywhere."
Salinger 1 also discussed the Alli
ance for Progress and the Berlin
situation, then lashed out at his
opponent's simplistic approach
and the "Goldwater. Murphy,
Nixon charge" that the Admin
istration is "soft of Communism."
"Does George Murphy agree
with Richard Nixon that Presi
dent Johnson is soft on Commu
nism?" Salinger asked,
Finally Salinger asked for the
rejection of Barry Goldwater in
November. "Any man who has so
little faith in America that he
thinks it's going to hell and so
little sense that he says he fears
Washington more than Moscow
should be defeated."


SENATOR PIERRE SALINGER displays the new technique in courting
the parent vote; no nonhygenic kisses—just a head pat.

Washington more than Moscow
should be defeated."


SENATOR PIERRE SALINGER displays the new technique in courting
the parent vote; no nonhygenic kisses—just a head pat.
Senator Pierre Salinger "illu
minated the scenetv sniTOund
ing liis opponents foreign pol
icy and campaign tactics in a
speech yesterday to over 1.0(H)
students in Memorial Audito
rium.
Attacking Republican George
Murphy's charge that the U.S.
"hasn't had a foreign policy since
Potsdam," the 39-year-old former
press secretary to Presidents
Kennedy and Johnson, said that
America has had a "clear and re
sponsible program since World
War 11. a program of maintaining
our strength and firmness while
understanding that in the nuclear
ago it is impossible for any state,
especially the biggest, to refuse
to negotiate on matters of war
and peace."
"THIS is the cornerstone of our
foreign policy, the willingness to
sit down and talk about the issues
that divide us."
Salinger dealt with the foreign
policy of the Kennedy era in great
details, from the Bay of Pigs "a
tragic mistake and the only ma
jor defeat John Kennedy ever
suffered" — to the Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty "the thing the late
President will be remembered
longest for."
TURNING to today's problems,
he stressed the complexity of
such issues as the war in Viet
Nam: "Our only course is the
most difficult one the course we
are following now ... It requires
the patience and understanding
of the American people; but we
must continue. For if the Com
munists are successful, then 'wars
of liberation' will spring up
everywhere."
Salinger 1 also discussed the Alli
ance for Progress and the Berlin
situation, then lashed out at his
opponent's simplistic approach
and the "Goldwater. Murphy,
Nixon charge" that the Admin
istration is "soft of Communism."
"Does George Murphy agree
with Richard Nixon that Presi
dent Johnson is soft on Commu
nism?" Salinger asked,
Finally Salinger asked for the
rejection of Barry Goldwater in
November. "Any man who has so
little faith in America that he
thinks it's going to hell and so
little sense that he says he fears
Washington more than Moscow
should be defeated."
