Dour Sir:
After reading Mr. Briscoe's
"T.A. System Unbalanced" (Daily,
October 7 > one would assume that
the situation it describes was
still in effect at Stanford. How
ever, according to Professor
Walker himself, the statistics in
the General Studies Committee
report, from which the article is
drawn, were based on the two
years prior to last year. Many
depai'tments have made consid
erable changes long before the
appearance of the Committee re
port.
Since one paragraph specifi
cally referred to the French De
partment, I feel obliged to in
form your readers that Teaching
Assistanlships in this department
are awarded only on the basis of
th e highest qualifications in
French.
Tin: PARAGRAPH stating
"the quality of instruction has
been poorest ... in French"
comes immediately after a brief
paragraph to the effect that "the
TA system has been most success
ful when it. is combined with fac
ulty supervision and participa
tion.'' This implies that such sup
ervision and participation does
not yet exist in this department.
The article following i Daily,
October 8) states that such a pro
gram "is now being prepared in
the French and Italian Depart
ment." However, for the past two
years, we have had a program of
teacher training, in which each
TA is under the direct supervi
sion of a skilled and experienced
language teacher, who regularly
visits his classes and discusses
them with hiin.
ON" THE BASIS of the national
tests we have administered, lan
guage instruction in French and
Italian at all levels at Stanford
compares very favorably with that
at other major universities. The
Department of French and Ital
ian is now entering its third year
as a department.
We have instituted a com
pletely audio-lingual teaching
method, and revised our curricu
lum. This fall we have opened a
new language laboratory which is
now in full operation. These steps
are the result of departmental
planning to achieve the goal of
the best instruction possible. Most
Stanford students, 1 feel sure, are
already aware of these facts.

• Greeks For Gold water
Dear Sir:
Due to my association with a
fraternity in my undergraduate
years, I have recently come upon
a piece of information vital to the

preservation of the American
way of life. This information
comes from a leaflet sent out to
fraternities by the "Greeks for
Goldwatcr."
I must admit that at first I was
dismayed by this heading were
these foreigners trying to weasel
in on the campaign for Mr. Red-
Blooded American? No! Impos
sible!
MAYBE, I thought, Barry had
changed what we were supposed
to think and was now advocating
a return to the golden age of
Greece instead of the golden age
of big business.
But no, far more important,
these were fraternity and soror
ity men and women —- good white
Americans all asking for our
aid in the election of Barry Gold
water. Then, as I read on, I found
out why we need his help.
BARKY was quoted as saying
"Against us who believe in the
fraternity system are arrayed the
same forces who would destroy
all associations dedicated to the
. . . principles I have outlined.
These are the same who would
take away our freedom of assem
bly, our freedom of speech, free
dom of the press, freedom of
property . . . these are people, my
friends, who are working 24 hours
a day . .
Fellow Americans, how can you
sit complacently over your cup
of coffee when you know that
at this very minute THEY are
working to undermine all that is
sacred in this country?
I WILL ADMIT, I had inklings
that perhaps our fraternities were
being infiltrated. There was that
nasty anti-discrimination clause
thing at Cal. I decided to try ;i
test of my own and put a (shud
der) LB J sticker on my car.
I had to park in front of the
ATO house six (G) times before
some freedom-loving patriot fin
ally ripped it off. Now Barry con
firms my earlier suspicions. And
after all, he is in the Senate, so
he should know.
WE MUST ACT. I have driven
by Stern Hall at 3 a.m. and seen
the lights on. Now we know
what's going on behind those
closed doors, while patriots sleep.
THEY are at work, against US. It
is time to defoliate the pinkos
and anti-fraternity conspirators.
Not a big bomb, mind you, just
a little one — nothing over a
megaton but one that will get
those rats out in the open where
wo can shoot at them like men—
from the hip.
Americans everywhere, jo in
with Barry and me in defeating
our country's foes. It is your pa
triotic duty.

• Prop. 11 Headline
Dear Sir:
Your News in Brief may come
, from tho wires of the Associated
j Press, but who writes the head
lines? Your headline on Jesse
i Unruh's comment on Proposition
14 could be viewed as wilful mis
representation or incredible cal
lousness.
When the Assembly Speaker
says,"I think the Negro people
would find the consequences eas
ier to bear than the rest of us
{would," he is talking about our
conscience, our sense of decency,
call it what you will.
AS THE REST of the quotation
j makes clear, he is talking about
an intensification of the feeling
of guilt that is the white man's
burden after centuries of injus
tice to the Negro.
Thus your headline, "Unruh
says Prop. 1 1 Not Bad," does a
disservice to Jesse Unruh and to
the many people who share his
view that Proposition 14 is bad
and must be defeated.
RUTH K. FRANKEIN
EDITOR'S NOTE: Several
of our readers have pointed
i out this headline to lis. It was
i the result of neither misrepre
sentation nor callousness. It re
sulted from a simple error on
the part of one of our rather
harried wire editors —for which
lie apologizes profusely.
