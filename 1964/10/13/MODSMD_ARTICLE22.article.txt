## NATO, Defoliation Issues Proved False By Press 
### John E. Bonine 
Barry Goldwater's alleged
"trigger-happiness' ha s become
the key issue in the Presidential
campaign, with some Republi
cans prepared even to vote for his
Democratic opponent because of
it.
Had this image been drawn
I from fact, the cries of "smear"
j from his followers could be dis
missed as election year rhetoric.
Unfortunately, the Senator's
portrait has been constructed
from (1) emanating untruths
from the White House itself and
(21 misreporting by the news
media.
Time Magazine set the record
I straight on nuclear control on
i September 25:
I "Johnson gets across the no
tion for instance, that Gold-

! water is irre
sponsible an d
i reckless because
I he has suggested
j l hat NATO's su
! preme comman
der ought to be'
i given some sort
of contingency
| 'i u I ho r i t y for
j using tactical
i nuclear weapons

-at a time when (Jen. Lemnitzer,
; under a delegation of power from
Johnson, has just such author
ity."
The New York Times reported
j two weeks ago:
"It is widely assumed in the
capital that certain field com
manders now have authority to
employ nuclear weapons under
certain circumstances."
Coldwater's statement on th e
i matter is this: "A nuclear NATO
j could meet local invasions, on
(the spot, with local tactical nu
j clear forces."
Richard Nixon revealed on
October 6 that "Both former
I President Eisenhower and Ken
i nedy gave NATO commanders
i in Europe the right to respond

I with tactical nuclear weapons in
j the event of a surprise attack by
it lie Communists."
The efforts of Lyndon Johnson
i and his fellow Democrats to mis
lead the American people on this
i issue for political purposes are
shocking and cause one to won
der to what lengths of distortion
I they have gone on other questions
i of national security.
The other bogus issue in this
I campaign is "defoliation."
Life Magazine put this "issue"
i to rest on September 18:
"An erroneous Associated Press
I report of a Goidwater TV inter
| view in May had him advocating
i the use of nuclear weapons to
j 'defoliate' jungle growth that
I conceals the Vietcong supply
t lines."
The AP itself sent out a full
! retraction in a matter of hours
after its erroneous report, but
' the undeserved damage had been
done in newspaper which had
: done in newspapers which had
! terview ("Issues and Answers,"
j May 21» showed Goidwater said:
"There have been several sug
gestions made. I don't think we
would use any of them. But de
foliation of the forest by low
yield atomic weapons could well
j be done."
As the paragraph clearly shows.
1 Sen. Goidwater was discussing,
! not advocating — and the idea
i was later revealed to have been
{circulated in the Defense Depart
ment.
i Some would have us believe,
j however, that questions of nu
i clear power should not be dis
| cussed — they are "not debat
| able."
Nuclear power is a fact. We will
learn how to fit it into our mili
tary arsenal by examining that
fact, not by burying our heads
ostrich-like, not by labeling "irre
sponsible" any man who forces us
to think about it.and not by dis
torting his statements on the sub
ject. (To be continued tomorrow).
