# Homo Politicus— The 'Salinger Species'
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
The life of a political cam
paigner must be an endlessly fas
cinating as well as tiring —•
occupation, if the brief 90-minute
foray of Senator Pierre Salinger
here yesterday is a representa
tive example.
You couldn't miss the candi
date's car at the Gate; it was the
one with Salinger-Johnson signs
on both bumpers and, one dis
covered on later inspection, on
the inside dashboard as well.
YOU COULDN'T miss the can
didate either. No sooner had he
stepped out of the car than two
little girls presented themselves
and waited for the Senator's
acknowledgement. lie quickly
reached down and patted each on
the head.
"I thought the accepted style
was kissing them," a student
cracked.
"No." Salinger demurred, "the
new technique calls for gentle
head patting".

WITH THAT he disappeared ;
into the back of Mem Aud where 1
lie was confronted with student j
escorts, the press and local candi
dates. After the inevitable KZSU i
interview and general introduc-1
! tions, the Senator found a seat,
scribbled a few notes in his one-'
I page text, and paused a few mo
■ ments to reflect before going on i
stage.
This unusually tranquil scene!
was disrupted by an announce- j
i ment that two "eminent" Russian;
I scientists were in the audience 1
and wanted to m< i et the candidate. '
Salinger bounded off the sofa to:
j shake hands and engage the two j
|of them in a short conversation
J in broken English.
At the rostum, he cracked!
i jokes, flattered the local crowd!
by recalling how Stanford always ,<
used to beat his alma mater, the!
j University of San Francisco
"and that's when wo gave up foot-J
' ball"—and then swung into his
speech with vigor.
IN THE QUESTION period fol- 1
| lowing the address, Salinger cf- j
j fectively squelched one irate stu
dent by questioning the la t -
tor's analyzation of the missile,
crisis of H)(>2 "since you never
have read the intelligence reports
I as I have."
"Boy, I ought to pay t hose;
YAF'ers." the candidate said later,
"They couldn't be more helpful." i
Finally, the campaigner left
after patting the same two little
girls on the head. As he settled,
in the seat of his oar, the image
faded somewhat, blurred by the
haze from the Senator's own per
sonal tranquilizer ;i big, black
! cigar.
