# Tuition Fees Will Rise To $1,575 In Fall '65
## Adds $55 A Quarter 
### MARY KAY BECKER News Editor 
L : tuition at Stan
ford will increase from $1,410
to $1,575 per academic year,
effective next fall (1965-66),
President Wallace Sterling au
nounced yesterday.
The increase amounts to $55
each for the autumn, winter, and
spring quarters. Summer quarter
tuition will be increased, but will
remain substantially below the
rest of the academic year.
THE INCREASE will permit
the University to continue rais
ing faculty and staff salaries.
Sterling said. Through scholar
ships. loans, and jobs, every effort
will be made to assure thai no
student, is denied an opportunity
to attend Stanford solely for lack
of funds, he added.
The Board of Trustees approved
the increase at the May meeting.
The announcement was withheld
until after the beginning of this
quarter to avoid confusion about
when the increase goes into ef
fect.
"There is nothing unusual about
the increase, considering recent
history," said Kenneth Cuthbert
son, University Vice-President
for Finance. "In long-range finan
cial planning, tuition adjustments
must be made; small increases
on a year-to-year basis are more
sensible than large sums all at
once." Moreover, when tuition was
raised about every four years, as
it was previously, the percentage
of increase was too high from the
student point of view, he added.
"NO RADICAL change in our
relative position is foreseen,"
Cuthbertson continued. "Tuition
increases will be considered every
two years." Primary needs to
which funds from the increase
will be directed are faculty sal
aries. ordinary operational in
creases, and expansion of library
facilities, he said.
Tuition was raised from $500
to $600 in 1948; to $66<> in 1950; to
$750 in 1954; to $1,005 in 1958; to
$1,260 in 1961; and then to $1,410
in 1963.
In recent years, according to
Sterling, tuition has covered only
about 43 per cent of the Univer
sity's operation costs which now
exceed $3,000 per student per
year. Of the remainder, 25 per
cent comes from gifts, 15 per
cent from endowment, 1 per cent
from land development, 9 percent
from special funds (outside
scholarships, fees, conferences,
etc.) and i percent from ot her
sources.
During the past decade, student
financial aid at Stanford has in
creased from $460,001) in 19,">2 to
$5.5 million in 1962-63. Nearly
half the freshman class receive
assistance averaging more than
$1,000 per recipient.
BASK COSTS for a year's
study now total approximately
$3,040. excluding transportation
to and from the campus. Besides
tuition, this figure includes room
and board, books and supplies,
laundry and cleaning, and recrea
tional expenses.
At least 57 other colleges and
universities already have estab
lished higher tuition and fee pay
ments than Stanford's, accord
ing to 1964-65 data published by

spring quarters. Summer quarter
tuition will be increased, but will
remain substantially below the
rest of the academic year.
THE INCREASE will permit
the University to continue rais
ing faculty and staff salaries.
Sterling said. Through scholar
ships. loans, and jobs, every effort
will be made to assure thai no
student, is denied an opportunity
to attend Stanford solely for lack
of funds, he added.
The Board of Trustees approved
the increase at the May meeting.
The announcement was withheld
until after the beginning of this
quarter to avoid confusion about
when the increase goes into ef
fect.
"There is nothing unusual about
the increase, considering recent
history," said Kenneth Cuthbert
son, University Vice-President
for Finance. "In long-range finan
cial planning, tuition adjustments
must be made; small increases
on a year-to-year basis are more
sensible than large sums all at
once." Moreover, when tuition was
raised about every four years, as
it was previously, the percentage
of increase was too high from the
student point of view, he added.
"NO RADICAL change in our
relative position is foreseen,"
Cuthbertson continued. "Tuition
increases will be considered every
two years." Primary needs to
which funds from the increase
will be directed are faculty sal
aries. ordinary operational in
creases, and expansion of library
facilities, he said.
Tuition was raised from $500
to $600 in 1948; to $66<> in 1950; to
$750 in 1954; to $1,005 in 1958; to
$1,260 in 1961; and then to $1,410
in 1963.
In recent years, according to
Sterling, tuition has covered only
about 43 per cent of the Univer
sity's operation costs which now
exceed $3,000 per student per
year. Of the remainder, 25 per
cent comes from gifts, 15 per
cent from endowment, 1 per cent
from land development, 9 percent
from special funds (outside
scholarships, fees, conferences,
etc.) and i percent from ot her
sources.
During the past decade, student
financial aid at Stanford has in
creased from $460,001) in 19,">2 to
$5.5 million in 1962-63. Nearly
half the freshman class receive
assistance averaging more than
$1,000 per recipient.
BASK COSTS for a year's
study now total approximately
$3,040. excluding transportation
to and from the campus. Besides
tuition, this figure includes room
and board, books and supplies,
laundry and cleaning, and recrea
tional expenses.
At least 57 other colleges and
universities already have estab
lished higher tuition and fee pay
ments than Stanford's, accord
ing to 1964-65 data published by
the Life Insurance Agency Man
