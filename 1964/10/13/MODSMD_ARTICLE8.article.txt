## 
### HOPE SELBY 
A wide sampling of the KZSU
"sound spectrum" kicked off the
Stanford radio station's program
of FM broadcasting at an inaugu
ral broadcast held in Memorial
Auditorium last night.
A flurry of helium-filled bal
loons marked with the station's
call letters filled the room as sta
tion personnel director Terry
Smith gave the program introduc
tion. The station can now be re
ceived at 90.1 megacycles FM as
well as the old frequency of 880
kilocycles.
UNIVERSITY President Wal
lace Sterling cited the station for
giving Stanford students the "ad
ditional opportunity to learn of
events a n d developments in
neighboring communities," and
for giving surrounding areas ihe

"amplified opportunity to share
the resources of the University."
Station news director Robert L.
Suffel gave a sampling of th e
ways in which KZSU brings out
side information to students in a
short newscast of national, state,
and local developments.
Increased coverage of nearby
communities is planned to aug
ment regular reporting of cam
pus events. Staffers compile news
at the station under a placard
reading "Some people boast of

their scruples . . . we boast of
our SINS (Stanford Integrated
News Service.)"
OTHER 'ADDRESSES congratu
lating the station on its power in
crease were given by chairman
of the Board of Trustees Richard
Guggenheim, Palo Alto Mayor
Dean Creasap, and ASSU presi
dent Scott Mcßride.
Musical numbers in the pro
gram included selections from
Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute"
performed by members of the
West Bay Opera Association,
Bach's "St. Anne's Fugue" played
by University organist Dr. Her
bert Nanncy, and a medley of
songs by the Stanford band.
FURTHER entertainment was
provided by a rendition of t. h <•
"Talking Dust Bowl Blues" by
Dave Barnum. noted for his per
formance of the "Frank Morse
Talking Blues" at Spring Sing
last year. A radio drama by staff
members satirized such campus
institutions as the PACE program
and freshman pre-reg activities.
