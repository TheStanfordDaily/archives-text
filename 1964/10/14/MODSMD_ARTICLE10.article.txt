### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
A small group of Slant o rd
students met last night for an
initial orientation session prepara
tory to their leaving for Missis
sippi to participate in the on-going
"Mississippi Freedom Project."
The group, whose numbers are
expected to swell in the next few
days, will leave for Mississippi in
one week shifts, starting October
18 and continuing through elec
tion day, November 3.
The Stanford volunteers will
aid in securing additional regis
tration for the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party (MFDP).
the indiginous political organiza
tion which leaped into the national
news when it challenged the seat
ing of the "Regular" Mississippi
Democratic delegation at the
August Atlantic City convention.
The registration drive will cul
minate in a "mock election" on
November 3. The party leaders
hope to poll a vote greater than
that attained by the "regular"
party candidates in the local con
test. If this occurs, the results of
the "official" election will be chal
lenged in the courts.
The "Mock Election" is a con
tinuing part of the "Mississippi
Sunmmer Project."
The "Mississippi Summer Proj
ect" was a massive voter registra
tion and remedial and "freedom"
education program which drew
large numbers of northern stu
dents, faculty and professional
men into t he state as teachers and
voter registration workers.
The Stanford Community first
became involved with the Missis
sippi Freedom Project last No
vember when the "Mississippi
Mock Vote Drive" suddenly gal
vanized the interest of the cam
pus.
Later in the year, the Civil
Rights Secretariat, a voluntary
student organization, was formed
under the auspices of ASSU.
Through the efforts of the Sec
retariat, over 10 members of the
Stanford community (students,
faculty, and staff* went south
this summer to work as volun
teers in the Mississippi Freedom
Project.
The Secretariat is now defunct.
It has been replaced by the newly
formed "Mississippi Free d o m
Pr o j ec t Stanford" gro up
(MFP-S).
The MFP-S will hold its iinitial
all-campus informational meeting
tomorrow afternoon at 4:15 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The pro
gram will center around a panel
discussion involving Stanford
volunteers who participated in
the Summer Project.
