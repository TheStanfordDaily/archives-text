students from lower class fami
lies are poor predictors of t heir

• They tend to equate high
school honors for general leader

men, including a cross section of
an entire class and an additional j
sampling of those with lower]
socio-economic background.

600. There were no major differ

Both groups came to Stanford

Students from lower class fam

good grades actually performed
the best. Their grade point aver

LOWER CLASS students who
anticipated good grades averaged
