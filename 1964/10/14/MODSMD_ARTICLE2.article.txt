# Historian Talks On Vietnam
## No Magic Formula From Either Party 
### BOB EGELKO 
\o matter which partv wins
the election, neither is going to
come up with a magic formula
lor \ ietnam, a Stanford histor
ian and former Foreign Service
oflieer I old a Tuesday Evening
Series audience last night.
"I don't think we're going any
where spectacular," Dr. Claude
Bliss stated to a Memorial Audi
torium gathering. "Our problem
is to find an economic and politi
cal program to go along w i th
the military effort, and it is not
an easy problem."
B! SS EMPHASIZED the im
portance of the current political
situation in South Vietnam, in
which the Khanh government,
which has been supported by this
country, is slated to turn over
power to a civilian group on Oc
tober 27.
"How can you expect a group
of Vietnamese civilians, in a
country with no democratic tra
dition, to come up with a work
ing constitution and legislature
in such a short time?" queried
Buss.
"And yet we can't step in and
say, 'This is the kind of constitu
tion you're going to have,' be
cause these people need to feel
independent as much as anybody
else."
"IX FACT," Buss added, "the
greatest danger is that the South
Vietnamese will start believing
what the propagandists in th e
North are saying, that is, that
their government is merely a pup
pet of the United States."
"If the day ever comes when
South Vietnam feels that the
United States is hurting their
cause more than the North Viet
namese would, our mission will
have failed. That day must not
come."
"SINCE WE took over for the
French after they were defeated
at Dienbienphu, they've shown a
, certain lac k of sympathy for our
position. We condemned their
colonial interests in Indochina, as
well as those of the British in
Burma and the Dutch in Indone
sia; now they want to know just
what it is that we're doing that's
so different from what they did."
"What I want to emphasize."
Buss concluded, "is that there is
no one solution to our problems
in Vietnam. But when we have
considered the diplomatic and
economic aspects, our interests,
the Vietnamese interests for inde
pendence. and especially the Red
Chinese interests, we will be on
our way to a successful effort in
Vietnam."

B! SS EMPHASIZED the im
portance of the current political
situation in South Vietnam, in
which the Khanh government,
which has been supported by this
country, is slated to turn over
power to a civilian group on Oc
tober 27.
"How can you expect a group
of Vietnamese civilians, in a
country with no democratic tra
dition, to come up with a work
ing constitution and legislature
in such a short time?" queried
Buss.
"And yet we can't step in and
say, 'This is the kind of constitu
tion you're going to have,' be
cause these people need to feel
independent as much as anybody
else."
"IX FACT," Buss added, "the
greatest danger is that the South
Vietnamese will start believing
what the propagandists in th e
North are saying, that is, that
their government is merely a pup
pet of the United States."
"If the day ever comes when
South Vietnam feels that the
United States is hurting their
cause more than the North Viet
namese would, our mission will
have failed. That day must not
come."
"SINCE WE took over for the
French after they were defeated
at Dienbienphu, they've shown a
, certain lac k of sympathy for our
position. We condemned their
colonial interests in Indochina, as
well as those of the British in
Burma and the Dutch in Indone
sia; now they want to know just
what it is that we're doing that's
so different from what they did."
"What I want to emphasize."
Buss concluded, "is that there is
no one solution to our problems
in Vietnam. But when we have
considered the diplomatic and
economic aspects, our interests,
the Vietnamese interests for inde
pendence. and especially the Red
Chinese interests, we will be on
our way to a successful effort in
Vietnam."
\o matter which partv wins

come up with a magic formula

"I don't think we're going any
where spectacular," Dr. Claude
Bliss stated to a Memorial Audi
torium gathering. "Our problem
is to find an economic and politi
cal program to go along w i th
the military effort, and it is not
an easy problem."
