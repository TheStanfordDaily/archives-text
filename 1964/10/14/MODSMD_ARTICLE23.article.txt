# Handley Leading Rushers; Beck Tops Point Kickers
## 
### 
With the season nearly half
over, Stanford's football team is
in the very unusual position of
having national leaders in two
important departments â€¢ rushing
and kicking.
Hard-running h a 1 112 b a c k Ray
Handley has rambled for 463
yards in four games, leading
Wake Forest's Piccolo by a good
20 yards. The west coast is
abounding in good rushers, as
evidenced by USC's Mike Garrett,
in fourth place with 397 yards,
and Washington's Junior Coffey,
sixth with 370 yards.
HANDLEY is averaging a fat
six yards per carry, far more than
the rest.
Last year's team rushing leader
was Steve Th u rl o w , with 495
yards in 10 games. At Handley's
present rate, he could surpass the
1000-yard mark, a feat not ac
complished on the Farm for
several years.

Braden Beck's accurate toe may
set a collegiate field g<ud kicking
record. He leads the nation's
kickers with 27 points, and his
six field goals in 10 allempls are
by far the most.
The single season field goal

record is 13, sot by Dyas of
Auburn in 19G0. At Bock's present
rate, ho would have 15 at year's
end.
BIX h DOES all right on kiok
offs, too, averaging 53.3 yards.
Last Saturday he sent two over
the goal lino and against Wash
ington State boomed one over TO
yards.
Elsewhere on the team, Dick
Ragsdale leads the punters with
a 42.6 yard average and returns
kiekoffs an average of 22 yards.
