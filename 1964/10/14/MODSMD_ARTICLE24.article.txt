victory.
NELSON, along with backs
Andy Sears, Jack Root, Andy Car
rigan, Bill Hoy, Wilson Riles,
Donn Renwick, and Tim Abena,
had plenty of time to operate be
hind the wall the Red line formed
against the smaller Spartans.
Stanford struck paydirt early
in (ho first quarter when Andy
Carrigan crashed over from the
two, and remained one step ahead
of San Jose thereafter. An inter
ception sot up the touchdown
drive.
The game settled into a defen
sive game with the ball changing
hands several times until early
in the second half, when Stan

bled.
THE ELATEI) Spartans caught
fire and covered the distance to
the goal in just six plays, the ser

The Red, not to be outdone,
took the kiokoff from their own
30 to a TD in foui plays. Nelson
