# The 						Speaker Of LASSU
## 
### 
Tomorrow night the Legislature will elect
its speaker. This dec ision is potentially the most
important choice LASSU will face this year.
The Speaker ol LASSU — his dynamism
and leadership or the lack thereof — will deter
mine the Legislature's role in student govern
ment and University alfairs.
He can make it the center of the ASSU, ulti
mately responsible for all programs and policy
decisions, or he can allow it to stagnate as a bi
weekly rubber stamp for the ASSU president.
i Le can direct its attention to issues of crucial
importance to the future of both student govern
ment and the student role in the policy-making
process ol the University, or he can allow it to
wallow in boring trivialities.
He can, in short, give new life to the Legisla
ture enabling it to gain the respect and atten
tion ol students and administrators, or be can
allow it to perpetuate itself as a virtual non
cntitv.

The Speaker of LASSU, to be effective, should
be a person of long experience in student affairs.
He should know the workings of the University
and should have well-established acquaintances
with key administrators.
lie should have a practical knowledge of
Legislature and how it functions and therefore
should have been directly associated with
LASSU for at least a year.
Finally, he should be politically neutral,
committed to neither the "ins" nor the "outs.
Only then can LASSU rise above petty political
squabbles with enough unity to make itself effec
tive.
We have never been overly optimistic about
I ASSU's potential or about ultimate student con
cern with the business of student government.
But il there is a chance to make it a legislature
worth the name, that chance lies in giving it a
forward-looking, experienced and politically
neutral Speaker.
