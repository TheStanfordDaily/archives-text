# Ringo For Chancellor

### ART FISHER 
Last week at Berkeley several
hundred s t udetit s effectively
dominated the Cal campus for a
few days in a demonstration in
tended to win greater rights and
privileges for on-campus political
act i vis-Is. The doings received
press coverage normally accorded
only to a particularly colorful
slaying.
A deafening tongue-clucking
resulted, and the clamor of de
nunciation now threatens to ob
scure any lessons which we at
Stanford can learn from the
demonstrations.
First and most obviously, it
couldn't happen here. As has been
amply pointed out, we at Stan
ford have far greater freedom
than exists at Cal.
More fundamentally, the es
sence of the personality of the
Stanford student makes him less
inclined to sympathize with dem
onstrations. The demonstrators
break with the conventional rules
of the game of society and search
for a short-cut to achievement of
their aims.
Stanford s t u d cuts in over
whelming numbers have for many
years embraced those rules and
have consequently parlayed con
siderable ability into considerable
success in the games of life, at
tendance at Stanford being a fur
ther proof of their winnings.
It lies beyond the temerity of
this column to suggest a corre
lation between the degree of suc
cess and the degree of conviction
in the value of the rules, but one
thing is certain. Stanford stu
dents are markedly within the
confines of the conventional.
Thai our student leaders are
tactically no different from the
Administration, and that both
are in the strong English tradi
tions of deliberation and negotia
tion, of word and law, is proof
enough.
No truly left-wing movement
has ever prospered at Stanford,
and the general nature of our
admissions policy offers the best
guarantee that none will prosper
in the future.
At Cal the situation is not alto
gether different.

But the Cal student and the
Cal radical are generally differ
ent. Whereas at Stanford a true
radical is someone you grab
eagerly, invite to dinner, and poke
and prod rather like a jellyfish, at
Cal you have to hide from them.
Cal students tell of walking
through Sather Gate, both arms
loaded with books, while political
activists stuff literature into their
pockets. Agitated agitators course
through the dorms at all hours,
fully as loud as those abominated
freshman bonfire fanatics at Wil
bur Hall.
The CORE demonstrators in
San Francisco, seen from afar at
Stanford, appear almost chivalric.
At Berkeley the dirty necks and
stinking clothing of the semi pro
fessional pickets are too close for
comfort, and a wave of reaction
has set in.
This reaction is fascinating.
Students, unable to distinguish
between a cause and its partici
pants, turn personal rejection into
ideological anathema.
Adults, having long since memo
rized the causes of all their ills,
red-bait vigorously. In rebuttal
the activists counter that today's
student is a new breed, politically
aware, with more ethical courage
than physical fear.
All are wrong. We are not un-
American, and we are not a new
breed. We are like teeth which,
subjected to constant pressure,
will shift to a new position in
the jaw.
Students today are following in
the steps of their ancestors, but
at a far faster pace.
Cigarettes, puffed covertly bv
our forebearers at seventeen,
were puffed covertly by us at
twelve and thirteen. "Dime
novels" and sex pictures, dis
covered by them at eighteen, were
in our eager hands before we en
tered high school. At an age
when sex was a word to them, it
was an experience for us.
A well-rounded precociousness
is a national condition. Their pre
cocity has extended to education.
These students arc immersed in
the study of American culture.
They feel themselves an integral

part of the great movements of I
the history of the nation.
Where our forebearers picketed
at twenty-six, we picket at twenty.
Where they ranted on morals at ;
thirty, we harrangue at twenty-,
two. Barry, wc are in the main- j
stream.
But why direct action, they ask.
Why can't these matters be set
tled peacefully, by gentler pres-:
sures and gradual change? The;
student demonstrators at Cal,!
the CORE pickets at Bank of
America, and many of the grass j
roots supporters of Barry Gold
water all show the same mental-1
ity. All are afraid.
All see a phenomenon in so- j
eiety which they perceive as evil j
and threatening. All feel helpless j
to make their will effective; with-!
in the conventional channels and
institutions of society. Certain;
that those holding power are:
somehow profoundly hostile to j
their aspirations and intolerant j
of their feelings, each group I
strikes out to cut across the in- j
stiutions. Each seeks, in part by
ignoring, to escape from the so- j
cial mechanisms which he sees as
debilitating him. All are moral
ists.
Where, then, do our nice young :
boys and girls belong in this pic-j
lure? Tn the middle. The Ameri-j
can teen-ager, in part by his own!
choice, is a half-caste in the so-1
ciety that conceived him. From
puberty to graduation the pri
mary concern of his life has be
come what he can and cannot do.!
II is not surprising that he has'
come to think in terms of "his
rights," and from there it is aj
short jump to "civil rights." Con
sistently, he identifies strongly
with Negroes, who are also
treated like children.
The Cal demonstrations are
not the manifestation of a new
race of superstudents; they are
one outgrowth of a spirit to
be found in every dormitory and '
hoys' club from Maine to San j
Diego. In short, the Cal demon
strations and the cult of the j
Beatles are fruits of the samej
seed.
Our immaturities take subter-1
forms.
