## Democrat Foreign Policy Reckless, irresponsible 
### John E. Bonine 
(Continued from yesterday)
Hecklessiics.s lias been made an issue in this Presidential cam
paign. lint far more reckless llian Senator Go Id water's discussion
ol Americas defenses is the apparent course being followed by
the Democrat Administration.
On December 2<, 1963, Lyndon Johnson stated in his press

conference: "We are going dowiH
any path that can possibly lead j
to peace. We will meet the Rus
sians halfway, and even further j
than halfway, if that is neces-;
sary."
Examples of the results of this
policy are legion:
• Abandonment of our demands
for UN inspection of Cuba in
1962;
• Forcing Laos into a coalition
government with Ihe Commu
nists;
• Plans for a "negotiated set
tlement" in Vietnam:
• Giving 90 minutes warning
of our intention to bomb th e
North Vietnamese bases after the
Gulf of Tonkin attack;
• Willingness to tolerate Cas- 1
tro's suiveisim of ihe Hemi- j
sphere (notably in Venezuela and!
Panama i;
• The statement in one of
President Jo li n so n ' s prepared j
texts that "Cuba is no longer a j
threat."
Foolhardy Policy
These attempts at "accommo-!
dation" are foolhardy and danger-1
ous. Given the continuing expan- i
sionism of the Russians, "half- j
way and even further" can only 1
be a net loss for the Free World.
The philosophy apparently un- j
deriving our actions pinpointed by
George Romney on February 9:
"We haven't taken the initiative
. . . This Administration has the
idea that if we don't offend them, '
we can win Khrushchev and the
Russians away from th e i r j
acknowledged objective of world :
domination."
Another facet of our policy is j
potentially even more risky. Par
tially under the policy of demon
strating our good intentions and
taking "unilateral initiatives,"
and partially under the excuse of
"obsolescence" and "economiz- \
ing," we are progressively weak-!
ening our military defenses.
Dismantling Of Bases
As U.S. News reported on
March 23, 19(53, "The ring of
forward U.S. bases around Rus- j
sia ... is being dismantled. Nu-;
clear bombers, medium missiles
and some forces are being with-1
drawn from England, Italy, Tur- j
key, Morocco, Spain, France,
Aslaska, and Guam."
Other similar actions:
• Unilateral reduction of 25
per cent in our production of fis-1
sionable materials (announced !
by President Johnson in Janu
ary );
• Robert McNamara's veto of
the nuclear aircraft carrier;

*
• Failure to initiate any new
major strategic weapons systems
i and cutting in half the existing
i non-strategic systems;
• Phasing out of our manned
bomber program, despite McNa
mara's own estimate that 75 per
cent of our nuclear capability is
lodged there, and despite th e
need for a mixed bomber-missile
force;
• Refusal to spend money ap
propriated for I lie RS-70 bomber;
• Discontinuance of our S k y
bolt program;
• Reduction of planned Minute
man deployment from 2.U00 to 950.
Just five days ago the Ho us e
i Military Operations Subcommit-
I tee accused Secretary McNamara
!of delaying a communications
1 satellite system at least two
years. "Had the (Defense) Depart
ment moved ahead according to
I plans and policies laid down two
! years ago and approved by the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, a system
j would have been operating now."
i The report said McNamara was
I "too timid and uncertain" and
tlicit he was "ovcreconomizing."
Such toying with vital matters
of our defense security may well
lead to what Dr. Gerhart Nie
meyer calls "war on the install
ment plan."
Our present foreign policy is
thus reckless in two ways.
"Do Unto Others"
It pretends the Cold War is
j ended and advises "do unto
I others" when the others have no
! intention of doing unto us cx
i cept, perhaps, with a shovel.
It is a policy of scrapping our
defenses and placing reliance on
an inflexible Maginot Line con
cept of missile defense, while even
that is not proved to be reliable.
Our President has shown a
capacity for firm, preventive mea
sures only when forced by fla
grant actions such as in the Gulf
of Tonkin. He seems not to have
the sophistication necessary to
recognize subtle maneuvers
Ihe kind which add up to a long
run debit in the power balance.
There is no more reckless and
certain road to war and defeat
than one based on wishful think
ing.
Sober examination of the pres
ent situation shows that the label
of "irresponsible" which has been
pinned to Senator Goldwater is
a cover-up for Ihe unspectacular,
yet irresponsible, acts of Lyndon
Johnson's Administration.
