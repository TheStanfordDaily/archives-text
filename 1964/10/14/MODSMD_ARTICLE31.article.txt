# LASSU Speaker Candidates Speak

KDITOK'S \()TK: Following; in alphabetical order are state
nients of the three candidates for the LASSU Speakership who
have announeed their eandidaey.
CLYDE CIIRISTOFFERSON
Is Legislature a joke? Anyone who has been to a Legislature
meeting, will testify that the proceedings are often humorous. But
then so are the proceedings of the House of Representatives. How
ever, the humor of Congressional operation is made less significant
than it might otherwise he by the fact that Congress has important
responsibilities and manages to discharge these responsibilities more
or less effectively.
Legislature has been less able than Congress to counteract the
"Great Comedy" image which tends to accompany large deliberative
bodies. Why? Is it because Legislature's responsibilities are less
important? Or is it because Legislature has not effectively exercised
the powers which it does have?
The former explanation is only partial. It is true that Legisla
ture's authority is largely limited to the University community. But
it seems to me that the opportunity to add consructively to this com
munity, by considered action and intelligent criticism, provides Legis
lature with options which are indeed important.
If, then, Legislature's failure has been the effective pursuance
oi these options, again the question is why? And again there are two
explanations. First, the members of Legislature may not have
enough detailed information about the University community to
know what these options are. Second, the members of Legislature
may not be familiar enough with legislative procedures to pursue
these options effectively.
If Legislature is to be an effective element of the Stanford com
munity, I think the bottlenecks in the areas of 1 » information and
2• procedure must be eliminated. I further Ihink this is a primary
responsibility of the Speaker, and it is with this responsibility in
mind thai I am a candidate for the office of Speaker.
ED SHAW
In theory student government is the most effective student voice
on campus but in practice its potential is yet to be realized. In the
past several years most of the responsibilities for managing student
affairs has rested with a series of highly competent ASSU presi
dents. While this trend of leaders is likely to continue, the job of
student government has outgrown the abilities of even the most
outstanding student.
In the Legislature there are as many as eighty people represent
ing all parts of the student body bound together principally by a
common interest in responsible student government. The task, then,
is for these people operating within the Legislature to both express
the views of their constituents within the framework of student
government and to insure that that government operates in the best
interests of the student body and the University community.
To accomplish this, a change in the attitude of both the students
to the Legislature and the individual legislator toward himself is
necessary. But to speak philosophically floes not solve this problem.
What is needed is a scries of positive reforms both of the legislative
mechanism and of the ASSU framework as a whole which would
encourage legislative responsibility, increasing student respect for
1 heir government.
An obvious and primary reform is broadening the committee
structure, but to create committees for the sake of creating commit
tees achieves little. There are areas of student concern, however,
with which the Legislature has not yet concerned itself. Standing
committees on housing, development and academic affairs and tempo
rary committees on matters as come to the attention of the Legisla
ture from time to time are needed to benefit not merely the Legisla
ture but the entire student body as well. Further, a temporary com
mittee chaired b\ the Speaker is necessary to study the finer points
of the legislative process and propose needed procedural changes.
Until the Legislature can resolve its own problems it cannot re
solve the problems of the student body.
ANDY WILLIAMS
In seeking to serve as an effective arm of student government.
LASSU faces two challenges: it must master the mechanics of con
ducting an efficient meeting, and it must truly represent the opinions
of the student body.
Each member shares the responsibility of determining the direc
tion and extent of the legislature's policy; it is the speaker's task
io do the work necessary to assure that this policy is democratically
and efficiently determined. A few essential reforms can facilitate
tnese tasks.
• Strengthening the committee system will enable LASSU to
handle efficiently the vast majority of routine, but necessary legisla
tion. while providing the experience needed to handle the larger and
more important issues as they arise.
• Capable chairmen mean effective committees, and accordingly.
I strongly recommend that an interview system replace the currently
used spoils system.
• Committee reports should be filed in writing and made avail
able to members before the meeting.
The second requirement which LASSU must meet is to effectively
represent its constituents. LASSU has failed to do this in the past,
but it can succeed this year if a sincere effort is made to discover
what the student body feels about the issues. To accomplish this:
The student body must know what LASSU intends to discuss,
and they must have adequate time to voice their opinions to their
representatives. To facilitate this, the agenda should be printed on
the Monday preceding the meeting, so as to allow the house meet
ings time to consider the various issues.
The legislature must feedback information to the student body.
Although the individual representatives are the primary links be
tween LASSU and the students, the speaker can supplement their
efforts. He should maintain personal contact with the various living
groups through a rotating meal program, and he should be available
as a source of information and clarification to both the student body
;md the legislators by holding at least two office hours daily.

bodies. Why? Is it because Legislature's responsibilities are less
important? Or is it because Legislature has not effectively exercised
the powers which it does have?
The former explanation is only partial. It is true that Legisla
ture's authority is largely limited to the University community. But
it seems to me that the opportunity to add consructively to this com
munity, by considered action and intelligent criticism, provides Legis
lature with options which are indeed important.
If, then, Legislature's failure has been the effective pursuance
oi these options, again the question is why? And again there are two
explanations. First, the members of Legislature may not have
enough detailed information about the University community to
know what these options are. Second, the members of Legislature
may not be familiar enough with legislative procedures to pursue
these options effectively.
If Legislature is to be an effective element of the Stanford com
munity, I think the bottlenecks in the areas of 1 » information and
2• procedure must be eliminated. I further Ihink this is a primary
responsibility of the Speaker, and it is with this responsibility in
mind thai I am a candidate for the office of Speaker.

In theory student government is the most effective student voice
on campus but in practice its potential is yet to be realized. In the
past several years most of the responsibilities for managing student
affairs has rested with a series of highly competent ASSU presi
dents. While this trend of leaders is likely to continue, the job of
student government has outgrown the abilities of even the most
outstanding student.
In the Legislature there are as many as eighty people represent
ing all parts of the student body bound together principally by a
common interest in responsible student government. The task, then,
is for these people operating within the Legislature to both express
the views of their constituents within the framework of student
government and to insure that that government operates in the best
interests of the student body and the University community.
To accomplish this, a change in the attitude of both the students
to the Legislature and the individual legislator toward himself is
necessary. But to speak philosophically floes not solve this problem.
What is needed is a scries of positive reforms both of the legislative
mechanism and of the ASSU framework as a whole which would
encourage legislative responsibility, increasing student respect for
1 heir government.
An obvious and primary reform is broadening the committee
structure, but to create committees for the sake of creating commit
tees achieves little. There are areas of student concern, however,
with which the Legislature has not yet concerned itself. Standing
committees on housing, development and academic affairs and tempo
rary committees on matters as come to the attention of the Legisla
ture from time to time are needed to benefit not merely the Legisla
ture but the entire student body as well. Further, a temporary com
mittee chaired b\ the Speaker is necessary to study the finer points
of the legislative process and propose needed procedural changes.
Until the Legislature can resolve its own problems it cannot re
solve the problems of the student body.

In seeking to serve as an effective arm of student government.
LASSU faces two challenges: it must master the mechanics of con
ducting an efficient meeting, and it must truly represent the opinions
of the student body.
Each member shares the responsibility of determining the direc
tion and extent of the legislature's policy; it is the speaker's task
io do the work necessary to assure that this policy is democratically
and efficiently determined. A few essential reforms can facilitate
tnese tasks.
• Strengthening the committee system will enable LASSU to
handle efficiently the vast majority of routine, but necessary legisla
tion. while providing the experience needed to handle the larger and
more important issues as they arise.
• Capable chairmen mean effective committees, and accordingly.
I strongly recommend that an interview system replace the currently
used spoils system.
• Committee reports should be filed in writing and made avail
able to members before the meeting.
The second requirement which LASSU must meet is to effectively
represent its constituents. LASSU has failed to do this in the past,
but it can succeed this year if a sincere effort is made to discover
what the student body feels about the issues. To accomplish this:
The student body must know what LASSU intends to discuss,
and they must have adequate time to voice their opinions to their
representatives. To facilitate this, the agenda should be printed on
the Monday preceding the meeting, so as to allow the house meet
ings time to consider the various issues.
The legislature must feedback information to the student body.
Although the individual representatives are the primary links be
tween LASSU and the students, the speaker can supplement their
efforts. He should maintain personal contact with the various living
groups through a rotating meal program, and he should be available
as a source of information and clarification to both the student body
;md the legislators by holding at least two office hours daily.

Is Legislature a joke? Anyone who has been to a Legislature
meeting, will testify that the proceedings are often humorous. But
then so are the proceedings of the House of Representatives. How
ever, the humor of Congressional operation is made less significant
than it might otherwise he by the fact that Congress has important
responsibilities and manages to discharge these responsibilities more
or less effectively.

know what these options are. Second, the members of Legislature
may not be familiar enough with legislative procedures to pursue
these options effectively.
If Legislature is to be an effective element of the Stanford com
munity, I think the bottlenecks in the areas of 1 » information and
2• procedure must be eliminated. I further Ihink this is a primary
responsibility of the Speaker, and it is with this responsibility in
mind thai I am a candidate for the office of Speaker.

In theory student government is the most effective student voice
on campus but in practice its potential is yet to be realized. In the
past several years most of the responsibilities for managing student
affairs has rested with a series of highly competent ASSU presi
dents. While this trend of leaders is likely to continue, the job of
student government has outgrown the abilities of even the most
outstanding student.
In the Legislature there are as many as eighty people represent
ing all parts of the student body bound together principally by a
common interest in responsible student government. The task, then,
is for these people operating within the Legislature to both express
the views of their constituents within the framework of student
government and to insure that that government operates in the best
interests of the student body and the University community.
To accomplish this, a change in the attitude of both the students
to the Legislature and the individual legislator toward himself is
necessary. But to speak philosophically floes not solve this problem.
What is needed is a scries of positive reforms both of the legislative
mechanism and of the ASSU framework as a whole which would
encourage legislative responsibility, increasing student respect for
1 heir government.
An obvious and primary reform is broadening the committee
structure, but to create committees for the sake of creating commit
tees achieves little. There are areas of student concern, however,
with which the Legislature has not yet concerned itself. Standing
committees on housing, development and academic affairs and tempo
rary committees on matters as come to the attention of the Legisla
ture from time to time are needed to benefit not merely the Legisla
ture but the entire student body as well. Further, a temporary com
mittee chaired b\ the Speaker is necessary to study the finer points
of the legislative process and propose needed procedural changes.
Until the Legislature can resolve its own problems it cannot re
solve the problems of the student body.

In seeking to serve as an effective arm of student government.
LASSU faces two challenges: it must master the mechanics of con
ducting an efficient meeting, and it must truly represent the opinions
of the student body.
Each member shares the responsibility of determining the direc
tion and extent of the legislature's policy; it is the speaker's task
io do the work necessary to assure that this policy is democratically
and efficiently determined. A few essential reforms can facilitate
tnese tasks.
• Strengthening the committee system will enable LASSU to
handle efficiently the vast majority of routine, but necessary legisla
tion. while providing the experience needed to handle the larger and
more important issues as they arise.
• Capable chairmen mean effective committees, and accordingly.
I strongly recommend that an interview system replace the currently
used spoils system.
• Committee reports should be filed in writing and made avail
able to members before the meeting.
The second requirement which LASSU must meet is to effectively
represent its constituents. LASSU has failed to do this in the past,
but it can succeed this year if a sincere effort is made to discover
what the student body feels about the issues. To accomplish this:
The student body must know what LASSU intends to discuss,
and they must have adequate time to voice their opinions to their
representatives. To facilitate this, the agenda should be printed on
the Monday preceding the meeting, so as to allow the house meet
ings time to consider the various issues.
The legislature must feedback information to the student body.
Although the individual representatives are the primary links be
tween LASSU and the students, the speaker can supplement their
efforts. He should maintain personal contact with the various living
groups through a rotating meal program, and he should be available
as a source of information and clarification to both the student body
;md the legislators by holding at least two office hours daily.

nients of the three candidates for the LASSU Speakership who
have announeed their eandidaey.

Is Legislature a joke? Anyone who has been to a Legislature
meeting, will testify that the proceedings are often humorous. But
then so are the proceedings of the House of Representatives. How
ever, the humor of Congressional operation is made less significant
than it might otherwise he by the fact that Congress has important
responsibilities and manages to discharge these responsibilities more
or less effectively.
Legislature has been less able than Congress to counteract the
"Great Comedy" image which tends to accompany large deliberative
bodies. Why? Is it because Legislature's responsibilities are less
important? Or is it because Legislature has not effectively exercised
the powers which it does have?
The former explanation is only partial. It is true that Legisla
ture's authority is largely limited to the University community. But
it seems to me that the opportunity to add consructively to this com
munity, by considered action and intelligent criticism, provides Legis
lature with options which are indeed important.
If, then, Legislature's failure has been the effective pursuance
oi these options, again the question is why? And again there are two
explanations. First, the members of Legislature may not have
enough detailed information about the University community to
know what these options are. Second, the members of Legislature
may not be familiar enough with legislative procedures to pursue
these options effectively.
