# Psychology Experiment Offers Help To Smokers
## 
### 
Prof. Karl I'. Koenig of the Psychology Department an
nounced yesterdax a new experiment dealing with habitual ciga
rette smoking among Stanford students. In the experiment, he
and six associates will employ experimental methods of clinical
psychology to help volunteers quit smoking.

The program will begin as soon-*
as volunteers have been screened
and selections have been made.
The department is seeking stu-1
dents between the ages of nine- ,
teen and twenty-five.
KOENKi is a visiting assistant
professor who graduated from
the University of Washington in
1960 and lias just completed a
year of internship at the Voter- j
ans' Administration Hospital in
Palo Alto.
Discussing the background of
the new experiment, Koenig
pointed out that millions of dol
lars and millions of man hours
had been absorbed in determin
ing the types of people who smoke
and various vague theories why
people smoke, but almost no

knowledge has been found on
how to stop smoking.
BY STUDYING the interests,
personalities, behavior, and social
j stimuli of each volunteer, it is
hoped that progress may be made
! in finding methods to stop smok
j ing.
Koenig expressed hope also
that this may be only the first of
j a series of experiments on smok
i ing. Ho noted that a year after
the Surgeon General's report on
i smoking was released, Americans
J continue to smoke as much and
more than before its release.
Students between the ages of
ninteen and twenty-five who are
reasonably disposed to quitting
smoking are asked to contact
Koenig. Details may be found in
today's Once Around the Quad.
