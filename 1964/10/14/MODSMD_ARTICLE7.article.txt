# Survey Reveals Study Habits

### BANNING GARRETT 
According to a 10 per cent random sampling
of the undergraduate student body, "two thirds
of the undergraduates spent more than half ot
their study time in their rooms," Robert J. Wert.
Vice-Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion reported recently to the Committee on Aca
demic Affairs of the Board of Trustees.
In some residence halls 7."i to 8n per cent of the
students do half or more of their studying in their
rooms.
TIIE RESULTS of the poll indicated that off
campus students use their rooms for studying
more than on-campus students; and fraternity
members study conspicuously less in their rooms
than do students living in University residence
halls.
It is not clear whether the students use their
rooms because they like comfort and convenience
and are not bothered by the noise of the residences,
or whether they cannot find satisfactory places
to study on Quad.
It is clear, however, that students find their
rooms much more satisfactory than the main
library. Students were asked to rate various places
on a 5-point scale, with 1 being excellent and ."i
being poor.
"There was remarkable agreement on a rat
ing of I for the library. 2 for student rooms, and
close to 2 for other places such as departmental
libraries, house libraries, etc. On these ratings.

the classes agreed, the sexes agreed, and practi
cally all major fields agreed," Wert stated.
The main library is little used by the majority
of the student body. "Almost 53 per cent never
study in the Reserve Book Room, and 98 per cent
spend less than 25 per cent of their study time
t here.
SIMILARLY about G5 percent of the students
sampled never study in the stacks, and 93 per cent
use them less than 25 per cent of their study
time," reported Wert.
More successful than the main library are the
house libraries at Wilbur, Toyon. and Stern. These
libraries are used by at least 30 per cent of the
students in the respective dorms, some of whom
use them for up to 50 per cent of their study time.
A similar study was done at Mt. Holyoke, Am
herst, Smith, and the University of Massachusetts.
The findings were similar in that 56 per cent of the
studying took place in dormitory rooms or library
carrels.
In Wert's opinion, "It is clear that students do
not wish to study in old-fashioned, large, high ceil
ing reading rooms. They wish instead to be alone
or with a small group."
The study was initially for the purpose of de
termining the use of house libraries in lieu of
fund raising for more house libraries, but was ex
panded in scope to include general student study
patterns. The first of these libraries, the Breer
Library for the first fraternity cluster, has already
I teen constructed.

spend less than 25 per cent of their study time
t here.
SIMILARLY about G5 percent of the students
sampled never study in the stacks, and 93 per cent
use them less than 25 per cent of their study
time," reported Wert.
More successful than the main library are the
house libraries at Wilbur, Toyon. and Stern. These
libraries are used by at least 30 per cent of the
students in the respective dorms, some of whom
use them for up to 50 per cent of their study time.
A similar study was done at Mt. Holyoke, Am
herst, Smith, and the University of Massachusetts.
The findings were similar in that 56 per cent of the
studying took place in dormitory rooms or library
carrels.
In Wert's opinion, "It is clear that students do
not wish to study in old-fashioned, large, high ceil
ing reading rooms. They wish instead to be alone
or with a small group."
The study was initially for the purpose of de
termining the use of house libraries in lieu of
fund raising for more house libraries, but was ex
panded in scope to include general student study
patterns. The first of these libraries, the Breer
Library for the first fraternity cluster, has already
I teen constructed.
According to a 10 per cent random sampling
of the undergraduate student body, "two thirds
of the undergraduates spent more than half ot
their study time in their rooms," Robert J. Wert.
Vice-Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion reported recently to the Committee on Aca
demic Affairs of the Board of Trustees.
In some residence halls 7."i to 8n per cent of the
students do half or more of their studying in their
rooms.
TIIE RESULTS of the poll indicated that off
campus students use their rooms for studying
more than on-campus students; and fraternity
members study conspicuously less in their rooms
than do students living in University residence
halls.
It is not clear whether the students use their
rooms because they like comfort and convenience
and are not bothered by the noise of the residences,
or whether they cannot find satisfactory places
to study on Quad.
It is clear, however, that students find their
rooms much more satisfactory than the main
library. Students were asked to rate various places
on a 5-point scale, with 1 being excellent and ."i
being poor.
"There was remarkable agreement on a rat
ing of I for the library. 2 for student rooms, and
close to 2 for other places such as departmental
libraries, house libraries, etc. On these ratings.

the classes agreed, the sexes agreed, and practi
cally all major fields agreed," Wert stated.
The main library is little used by the majority
of the student body. "Almost 53 per cent never
study in the Reserve Book Room, and 98 per cent
spend less than 25 per cent of their study time
t here.
SIMILARLY about G5 percent of the students
sampled never study in the stacks, and 93 per cent
use them less than 25 per cent of their study
time," reported Wert.
