# VOLUNTEER WORK:
## Grad Relates Teaching In Alabaman College 
### SHERRY ROSEN 
Volunteer teaching last summer at Miles College, a small Ne
gro school in Birmingham, Alabama, proved to he a unique and
rewarding experience lor a Stanford graduate student and his
wife.
Fred Burbank, a second-year student in (lie Stanford Medical
CaU/%A1 U4» u

■School, and his wife, who is
: junior high school teacher in Sun
nyvale, first heard of ihc college
through an article in the Novcm
; her 8, 1963 issue of Time maga
zine. "Since we are both deeply
interested in civil rights and we
i had the summer free," Burbank
recalled in an interview with the
Daily. "we decided to write to
| President L. H. Pitts and offer
; our voluntary services.
"IT WAS with a great deal of
vagueness about our duties and
! with some trepidation about en-j
t ering tho South as 'outside agita
tors' that we left for Birmingham,
arriving late in the evening after
i four days of hard driving. The
president, still at work in his
office, greeted us and introduced
| us to Dean George Jones, who
: had also returned to the adminis
tration building for some late
; evening work," he said.
Burbank then learned that he
j was to teach an introductory
! course in organic chemistry and
the accompanying lab for four
i teen students. "I had never seen
the text before, had no knowledge
i of the lab itself, and could find
on record no copy of any previ
ous problem set. lest, or lab in
ist ruction sheet," lie said.
Mrs. Burbank was assigned to
j teach an introductory sociology
j course and a readings course in
j sociology. The readings course.
: which was offered so that a hand
| ful of sociology majors could
graduate at the end of the sum
: mer, had never been offered
while either the president or the
j dean had been with Hie school.
Thus Mrs. Burbank had to deter-
I mine much «>f the course content.
"01 ESTIONS which a teacher
generally has months to answer
! were answered in the next day
at an obvious sacrifice to qual
ity," noted Burbank. "However.
I thh meant we were forced to fall

back on our own resources and
initiative, a requirement that
proved very rewarding to us in
return."
In addition to teaching and tak-
I ing an interest in campus activi-
I ties, the Stanford couple also be
came involved in several Birm
| ingham groups which were con
cerned with improving race rela
tions. "Through such organiza
tions as the Alabama Council on
Human Relations we met many
I white and Negro leaders of the
; city who expanded our experi
ences tremendously." Burbank re
-1 ported.
"Other summer visitors at
Miles included the dean of Har
an English professor from Har
vard College. John Munro, and
vard. There were also professors
as well as students like our
selves who had read the T i in <>
article and volunteered their ser
vices for the summer. In retro
; speet, ii is difficult to say which
was more interesting, our rela
tionship with our students or
with the visiting faculty."
ASSESSING the summer proj
ect as an experience of lasting
benefit. Burbank expressed the
, belief that "ii was of such intcr
; est to us that it would be very
' selfish if we did not try to com
municate a glimpse of our sum
i met- to others who might wish to
, have a similar experience. Miles
(College is hopeful that the sum
mer of 1965 will be as equally ex
j citing as last summer, and I
would be more than pleased to
answer any questions about the
college from well qualified volun
i tcers."
Inquiries max be sent to t he
Burbanks at P.O. Box (iISI, Stan
ford, and they may be reached
on Monday, Wednesday, and Fri
day afternoons at 3lii-st!X?d.
