day the heavens will disappear with a great rushing sound, the elements will disin
tegrate in Haines, and the earth with all that is in it will be laid bare.
"Since the whole universe is to break up in this way. think what sort of people
you ought to be, what devout and dedicated lives you should live! Look eagerly for
the coming of the Day of God and work to hasten it on; that day will set the heavens
ablaze until they fall apart, and will melt the elements in tlanies. Hut we have His
promise, and look forward to new heavens and a new earth, the home of justice.
"With this to look forward to, do your utmost to be found at peace with Him,
unblemished and above reproach in His sight. . . . Take care not to let unprincipled
men seduce you with their errors; do not lose your own safe foothold. Hut grow in
the grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Ilini be
