last weekend as they recorded
their first and second victories in

the last quarter and then spiked
Foothill's JV squad, 1.1-12.
Cal came to the Encina Pool
last Friday bringing with them, in
the opinion of Coach Joe lliggins,
the toughest competition the frosh
would face in the season. Indeed,

Indians. After being lied 5-5 at
the half, the Bear Cubs moved to
a 10-7 lead midway through the
third quarter.
FOUR GOALS by Pete Ready
evened the score at 11-1.1 going
into the final quarter. A three
point Stanford margin built up
early in the quarter held against

a Cal surge, and Ihe junior Tribe
chalked up victory number one,
1614.
Pete Ready scored six goals
against Ihe Cubs to register as
t lie high scorer. Gary Sheerer, and
Bill Meyer were close behind, con
tributing four goals each.
Visiting Foothill went the
same way as Cal, only faster.
Ready and Sheerer again were
high scorers.
FOOTHILL held a short-lived
4-3 lead at the end of the first
period. Nol a ball passed Stanford
goalie Terry Edeli while the
Cards tallied three times in the
second quarter. The first string
wailed to a 14-7 lead before de
parting in the third period. Every

squad "the best crop of fresh
men ever to come to Stanford."

Ready, Gary Sheerer, and Jo n
LaMar — were first string on
the high school Ail-American

the Indians on top, 15-12.
Coach Higgins calls this year's
squad "the best crop of fresh
men ever to come to Stanford."
Three team members — Pete
Ready, Gary Sheerer, and Jo n
LaMar — were first string on
the high school Ail-American
squad last. year. Supporling these
three is a team with demonstrated
potential. Coach Higgins was
also pleased that more frosh
turned out for water polo than
in any previous season.
