### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Playing without the services of
all-American Kammel Kadi, the
Stanford soccer team easily de
feated San Francisco State 5-2.
Stanford completely dominated
play, only once during Ihe entire
game did the Indian defense al
low State to mount a consistent
offense.
Klaus Bergman scored early
in the game for Stanford. The
defenses reigned after that until
the last few minutes of Ihe first
half. Stu Rawlings took a long
pass from the sidelines and
booted in a short, swift shot.
The Indians were on the at
tack as the second half began.
Rawlings scored his second goal
and Stanford lead 3-0. But San
Francisco State slipped aLarry
Ketzoff kick past the Stanford
goalie for their first point.
Halfway through the second
half Stanford scored their fourth
goal. It was all Bergman as he
dribbled from the side through
ihe State defense to get his kick.
A few moments later the ball
squirted out of a jam of players
and State's Ketzoff had his sec
ond goal. The score was then 4-2
in favor of Stanford.
With less than 3 minutes re
maining Rawlings took a fine
pass from Bergman in front of
the goal and put it away for
Stanford's fifth and final point.
