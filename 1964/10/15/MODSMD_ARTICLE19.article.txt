# We Must Win In Vietnam
## 
### 
The war in South Vietnam is one which the
United States cannot afford to lose, and yet, as
was emphasized Tuesday evening by Professor
Claude Buss, this country's position becomes
daily more precarious.
Why, we ask, is I lie United States facing its
first major military defeat?
There is little question that this country,
especially in earlier years, has displayed a gen
eral ineptitude in its approach to the baffling
problems of terrain, popular psychology, and
guerilla terrorism.
More disastrous, however, has been the over
all military strategy, a strategy which lias
doomed this nation to ultimate defeat in South
east Asia.
From the beginning we have fought a pureh
defensive war. By our refusal to take the neces
sary counter measures, we have guaranteed the
Vietcong guerillas an uninterrupted flow of
arms, ammunition, and propaganda materials
along numerous supply lines in Laos and North
Vietnam.
We have made no effort to halt the move
ment of troops and raiding parties into South
Vietnam from neighboring countries, and have
thereby committed the blunder of allowing Com
munist aggressors a privileged sanctuary from
which attacks can be launched at our maximum
inconvenience.
For years we have let the situation slide, fail
ing to commit ourselves to the action needed to
carry out our stated policy of guaranteeing South
Vietnamese (and previously Laotian) indepen
dence.
And now we are faced with the decision we
have put oil too long. We have either to com
mit ourselves anew to w inning the war or to
withdraw as gracefully as possible. A continua
tion of the present policy will result in certain
defeat.
The advocates of withdrawal, whether by
negotiation or surrender, reveal a regrettable
failure to understand two fundamental facts
about the situation in Southeast Asia:
• The Communist Chinese mean to expand
their sphere of control or indirect control (as
in North Vietnam) until they have absorbed
the entire subcontinent, particularly the rice-rich
delta areas.

• To accomplish this they will use every
available means (including the breaking of ne
gotiated settlements) and will wait whatever
time required, as long as that ultimate goal is
brought ever nearer to final realization.
Given these facts, the consequences of with
drawal are painfully predictable.
The United States will have proved what
has Jong been suspected by leaders of other
Asian nations, namely, that it lacks either the
capability or the will to do what is necessary
to protect these countries from infiltration, ag
gression, and eventual Communist takeover.
These leaders, having concluded this, will
have no choice but to accommodate Red China
or her agents.
As Ambassador Maxwell Taylor testified be
fore the House Foreign Affairs Committee last
September, an American withdrawal from South
Vietnam "would be a major disaster." He con
tinued:
"It would mean first that South Vietnam
would become Communist almost at once. . . .
After Communist success in South Vietnam, the
remainder of Southeast Asia would very shortly
thereafter go neutralist, possibly eventually
Communist. Burma would be affected, India
also, Indonesia would soon line up with the
Communists. We would be pushed out of the
Western Pacific back to Honolulu. That would
be the short-term effect over the next few years."
The United States has little choice, we feel,
but to take immediate and decisive action to
prevent further deterioration of the situation in
South Vietnam and ultimately to eliminate the
guerilla terrorists from a position in which they
threaten the peace and stability of that country.
To that end, all supply roads should be ex
posed and destroyed; further infiltration and
aggression should be halted bv eliminating guer
illa bases wherever they are found; and the long
and costly mopping-up campaign should be
started.
This country should commit whatever mili
tary forces and economic aid necessary and
should not be satisfied with anything short of
an independent, self-governing and peaceful
South Vietnam, set firmly on the road to pros
perity.

available means (including the breaking of ne
gotiated settlements) and will wait whatever
time required, as long as that ultimate goal is
brought ever nearer to final realization.
Given these facts, the consequences of with
drawal are painfully predictable.
The United States will have proved what
has Jong been suspected by leaders of other
Asian nations, namely, that it lacks either the
capability or the will to do what is necessary
to protect these countries from infiltration, ag
gression, and eventual Communist takeover.
These leaders, having concluded this, will
have no choice but to accommodate Red China
or her agents.
As Ambassador Maxwell Taylor testified be
fore the House Foreign Affairs Committee last
September, an American withdrawal from South
Vietnam "would be a major disaster." He con
tinued:
"It would mean first that South Vietnam
would become Communist almost at once. . . .
After Communist success in South Vietnam, the
remainder of Southeast Asia would very shortly
thereafter go neutralist, possibly eventually
Communist. Burma would be affected, India
also, Indonesia would soon line up with the
Communists. We would be pushed out of the
Western Pacific back to Honolulu. That would
be the short-term effect over the next few years."
The United States has little choice, we feel,
but to take immediate and decisive action to
prevent further deterioration of the situation in
South Vietnam and ultimately to eliminate the
guerilla terrorists from a position in which they
threaten the peace and stability of that country.
To that end, all supply roads should be ex
posed and destroyed; further infiltration and
aggression should be halted bv eliminating guer
illa bases wherever they are found; and the long
and costly mopping-up campaign should be
started.
This country should commit whatever mili
tary forces and economic aid necessary and
should not be satisfied with anything short of
an independent, self-governing and peaceful
South Vietnam, set firmly on the road to pros
perity.
The war in South Vietnam is one which the
United States cannot afford to lose, and yet, as
was emphasized Tuesday evening by Professor
Claude Buss, this country's position becomes
daily more precarious.
Why, we ask, is I lie United States facing its
first major military defeat?
There is little question that this country,
especially in earlier years, has displayed a gen
eral ineptitude in its approach to the baffling
problems of terrain, popular psychology, and
guerilla terrorism.
More disastrous, however, has been the over
all military strategy, a strategy which lias
doomed this nation to ultimate defeat in South
east Asia.
From the beginning we have fought a pureh
defensive war. By our refusal to take the neces
sary counter measures, we have guaranteed the
Vietcong guerillas an uninterrupted flow of
arms, ammunition, and propaganda materials
along numerous supply lines in Laos and North
Vietnam.
We have made no effort to halt the move
ment of troops and raiding parties into South
Vietnam from neighboring countries, and have
thereby committed the blunder of allowing Com
munist aggressors a privileged sanctuary from
which attacks can be launched at our maximum
inconvenience.
For years we have let the situation slide, fail
ing to commit ourselves to the action needed to
carry out our stated policy of guaranteeing South
Vietnamese (and previously Laotian) indepen
dence.
And now we are faced with the decision we
have put oil too long. We have either to com
mit ourselves anew to w inning the war or to
withdraw as gracefully as possible. A continua
tion of the present policy will result in certain
defeat.
The advocates of withdrawal, whether by
negotiation or surrender, reveal a regrettable
failure to understand two fundamental facts
about the situation in Southeast Asia:
• The Communist Chinese mean to expand
their sphere of control or indirect control (as
in North Vietnam) until they have absorbed
the entire subcontinent, particularly the rice-rich
delta areas.

• To accomplish this they will use every
available means (including the breaking of ne
gotiated settlements) and will wait whatever
time required, as long as that ultimate goal is
brought ever nearer to final realization.
