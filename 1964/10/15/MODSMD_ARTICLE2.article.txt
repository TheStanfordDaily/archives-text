# Evil In Mississippi 'Institutionalized'
## 
### NANCY STEFFEN Associate Editor 
"\\ e arc here, in part, to correct the* impression that the evil
in Mississippi is the result of a few individuals — a minority of
rednecks. The truth is that the evil in Mississippi is institutional
ized; it is written into the law. . . .
This phrase, "institutionalized evil, articulated In Stanford

student volunteer Chris Wilson,
formed the hard core definition
around which yesterday after-
panel discussion of th e
"Mississippi Summer Project" re
volved.
THE PANEL discussion, spon
sored by the newly-formed Mis
sissippi Freedom Project Stan
ford group (MFP-S), included
History Professor Otis A. Pease
and students Chris Wilson, Judy
Wallborn, Fred Goff. and Mar
garet Rose all volunteer work
ers in this summer's "Mississippi
Freedom Project."
Professor Pease began the pres
entation by stressing that "Our
history is the history of minority
groups." In the past, minority
groups have advanced by tradi
tional means, drawing from their
initial cultural resources to forge
instruments of political and
economic power.
THE NEGRO, however, has lit
tle coherent culture upon which
to draw. His social visibility defies
facile assimilation: "He wears his
color like a badge, every day of
the week, every hour of the day."
Further, in the south, the prob
lem is compounded by the "cul
tural baggage" which both whites
and Negroes carry with them to
their graves.

Thus, Pease concluded, tradi
tional modes of minority group
behavior provide but few answers
to what James Baldwin once
rightly termed "the white man's
problem."
In the South at least, the Ne
gro will not be able to rise from
the bottom social slot without a
massive infusion of federal pow
er and the continued concern and
aid of "external" communities.
AS OTHER speakers empha
sized in their more detailed dis
cussions, one of the long-term
aims of the "Freedom Project" is
to catalyze a sense of community
identity and from that base to
forge the political weapons neces
sary for lasting internal change
in Mississippi.
Out of the Mississippi Freedom
Project's efforts this summer,
this year, and for years and years
to come will grow a tentative pro
gram for action, drawn from the
Mississippi Negro himself.

gram for action, drawn from the
Mississippi Negro himself.
"\\ e arc here, in part, to correct the* impression that the evil
in Mississippi is the result of a few individuals — a minority of
rednecks. The truth is that the evil in Mississippi is institutional
ized; it is written into the law. . . .
This phrase, "institutionalized evil, articulated In Stanford

student volunteer Chris Wilson,
formed the hard core definition
around which yesterday after-
panel discussion of th e
"Mississippi Summer Project" re
volved.
THE PANEL discussion, spon
sored by the newly-formed Mis
sissippi Freedom Project Stan
ford group (MFP-S), included
History Professor Otis A. Pease
and students Chris Wilson, Judy
Wallborn, Fred Goff. and Mar
garet Rose all volunteer work
ers in this summer's "Mississippi
Freedom Project."
Professor Pease began the pres
entation by stressing that "Our
history is the history of minority
groups." In the past, minority
groups have advanced by tradi
tional means, drawing from their
initial cultural resources to forge
instruments of political and
economic power.
THE NEGRO, however, has lit
tle coherent culture upon which
to draw. His social visibility defies
facile assimilation: "He wears his
color like a badge, every day of
the week, every hour of the day."
Further, in the south, the prob
lem is compounded by the "cul
tural baggage" which both whites
and Negroes carry with them to
their graves.

Thus, Pease concluded, tradi
tional modes of minority group
behavior provide but few answers
to what James Baldwin once
rightly termed "the white man's
problem."
In the South at least, the Ne
gro will not be able to rise from
the bottom social slot without a
massive infusion of federal pow
er and the continued concern and
aid of "external" communities.
AS OTHER speakers empha
sized in their more detailed dis
cussions, one of the long-term
aims of the "Freedom Project" is
to catalyze a sense of community
identity and from that base to
forge the political weapons neces
sary for lasting internal change
in Mississippi.
Out of the Mississippi Freedom
Project's efforts this summer,
this year, and for years and years
to come will grow a tentative pro
gram for action, drawn from the
Mississippi Negro himself.
