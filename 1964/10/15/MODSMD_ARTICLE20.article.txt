## A 						Different View Of NSA 
### 
IH'ar Sir:
I would like to challenge your
recent copy on the NSA Congress
at several points. I assume your
figure of 359 voting delegates at
the Congress was correct; yel
might you not have confused this
figure with the number of NSA
member schools (approximately
330) whose student governments
represent 1,250,000 American stu
dents?
I FIND IT amazing t hat you
failed to take note of the alter
nate delegates (including two

from Stanford), the non-member
school observers, the educational
resource personnel (including
four from Stanford), and the
battery of foreign student lead
ers who played such a vital role
at the Congress and brought the
i figure of those in attendance over
I the 1,000 mark.
It also escapes me why you
! assert that "the resolutions
I passed are hurriedly considered
i . . Might I point out that seven
I full days of the Congress were
! spent in discussion and debate on

pending legislation: three days
in seminar discussing issues of
student concern; two days in sub
committee drafting and discuss
ing possible legislation; and two
days in committee debating and
passing on legislation to be
brought up before the Plenary.
Since much of the legislation
passed is merely up-dating of ex
isting policy resolutions in ac
cordance with NSA constitutional
procedure (this is especially true
in the sphere of international stu
dent affairs where specific situa
tions vary from year to year but
the applicable Basic Policy Dec
larations remain fairly constant),
the charge of inadequate consid
eration of new legislation re
mains without substantiation.
