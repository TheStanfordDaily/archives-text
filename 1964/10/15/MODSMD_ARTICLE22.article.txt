## LBJ's Popularity Drop: 'Personal Lack Of Ethics' 
### WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY 
The most recent polls indi
: cute, interestingly enough, not
so much a rise in the popular
ity of Senator Golclwater as a
diminution in the popularity of
President Johnson.
It becomes clearer, in retro
spect, that Mr. Johnson made
some instant calculations, hours
after achieving office, concerning
his political future. Someone re
cently remarked that if America's
liberals had been informed in
1960 that the race in 1964 would
he between Lyndon Johnson and
Barry Golclwater, they would
probably have marched out into
the ocean and drowned themsel
ves.
Lyndon Johnson's image in
1960 was that of the Southern, or
at any rate Southwestern alter
native to the Eastern and dog
matically Liberal wing of th e
Democratic P a r t y. lie was
roundly denounced by the prin
cipal Liberal spokesman of the
day, the labor union spokesman,
the thunder-makers of the ADA.
the tablet-keepers of the Liberal
ideology. He did little to woo their
favor. On one occasion he even
denounced "the KKK and th e
ADA."
The New Johnson
But when Mr. Kennedy w a s
killed. Lyndon recognized that he
would be regarded by his most
.ypcal consituents much as Ham
let's uncle was when he came to
bed between incestuous sheets.
Accordingly, a new Johnson was
borne. Within minutes, or so il
seemed, he breathed fire into the
civil rights bill. He went to New
York and gave a speech so far
gone in UN-action as might have
struck even Mrs. Roosevelt as
fulsome. Medicare . . . Anti-pov
erty . . . Increased social secur
ity, . . . See the Yellow Pages of
the ADA Directory; practically
everything there was quickly
bought by Lydon Johnson on be
coming President. It paid off bril
liantly.
Having consolidated his sup
port among the Liberals, th e
President turned to Business
America and identified himself
as, in effect, Honorary President
of the Chamber of Commerce.
Once again he succeeded. Many
businessmen were eager to be
lieve that Lyndon Johnson was
really at heart the Lyndon John
son the Liberals had fought so
ardently against during 1960, that
the overtures he now was making
to the Liberals were merely a
part of that campaign oratory !
that Wendell Willkie had taught j
us. way back in 1940. was neces
sary to any man who wants to ;
boob-bait his way into the White
House.
'Private Lack Of Ethics'
It was going swimmingly for:
LBJ: but the more or less per- (
sonal criticism of him is begin-1
ning to tell. The public expects

i criticism of LBJ from the Gold
water camp. But here was the
| Reverend Francis Sayre of Wash
! ington, an impeccable Liberal,
: publicly denouncing Johnson's
j 'private lack of ethics," his "cyni
i cal manipulation of power." The
widely respected Arthur Krock,
in the same column in which he
I admitted his belief that Johnson
; is the "best-equipped man for
!t he Presidency in public life,"
warns against Johnson's power
-1 hunger.
And Ihe long shadow of Bobby
Baker will not dissipate even un
der the brightest lights. It has
become the symbol of Mr. John
son's refusal to come clean about
his past.
Synthetic Euphoria
Finally there is working against
Lyndon Johnson the fundament
ally synthetic nature of Amer
ica's present euphoria. It is not
only that we have been adminis
tered happy pills by the federal
government Ihe farmers, the old
folks, the labor unions, defense
contractors, everybody. All the
microbes appear to be Demo- j
cratic-oriented, and are holding
back their poisons pending the j
renewal of their license in No
vember.
Things are hunky dory. Fewer j
people are killed in Vietnam than I
on the Merritt Parkway. Red
China hasn't been admitted to the |
United Nations. Khrushchev I
hasn't recently uttered an ultima-1
turn against West Berlin.
A cynical manipulator of the
world scene?
Precarious Equilibrium
Four years ago Khrushchev j
told Drew Pearson that he had |
intentionally laid low pending
what ho hoped would be the de-1
feat of Richard Nixon. Last July I
the leaders of the civil rights)
movement publicly instructed j
their followers to lay low pend-1
ing the successful conclusion of!
the campaign. A decision in Viet-!
nam is intentionally unconcluded I
pending the arrival and success
ful negotiation of the affair of:
November 3. The General Assem
bly of the United Nations oblig- j
ingly agrees not to convene to!
discuss the question of the admis- j
sion of Red China until, er, some
time in December or January.
But the tranquility sits on
some Americans on how many,
again we cannot know — as fic
titious, as having lamentably lit-J
tie to do with the nature of,
things; as suggesting not so
much an organic evolution into j
an era of peace and plenty, as a j
precarious equilibrium wrenched i
out of a mutinous world by the '
ten thumbs of Lyndon Johnson :
and his accommodating fellow ■
leaders. Can they maintain it for
just a few more weeks? There !
is no denying their skill. Or their
cynicism.

so much a rise in the popular
ity of Senator Golclwater as a
diminution in the popularity of
President Johnson.
It becomes clearer, in retro
spect, that Mr. Johnson made
some instant calculations, hours
after achieving office, concerning
his political future. Someone re
cently remarked that if America's
liberals had been informed in
1960 that the race in 1964 would
he between Lyndon Johnson and
Barry Golclwater, they would
probably have marched out into
the ocean and drowned themsel
ves.
Lyndon Johnson's image in
1960 was that of the Southern, or
at any rate Southwestern alter
native to the Eastern and dog
matically Liberal wing of th e
Democratic P a r t y. lie was
roundly denounced by the prin
cipal Liberal spokesman of the
day, the labor union spokesman,
the thunder-makers of the ADA.
the tablet-keepers of the Liberal
ideology. He did little to woo their
favor. On one occasion he even
denounced "the KKK and th e
ADA."
The New Johnson
But when Mr. Kennedy w a s
killed. Lyndon recognized that he
would be regarded by his most
.ypcal consituents much as Ham
let's uncle was when he came to
bed between incestuous sheets.
Accordingly, a new Johnson was
borne. Within minutes, or so il
seemed, he breathed fire into the
civil rights bill. He went to New
York and gave a speech so far
gone in UN-action as might have
struck even Mrs. Roosevelt as
fulsome. Medicare . . . Anti-pov
erty . . . Increased social secur
ity, . . . See the Yellow Pages of
the ADA Directory; practically
everything there was quickly
bought by Lydon Johnson on be
coming President. It paid off bril
liantly.
Having consolidated his sup
port among the Liberals, th e
President turned to Business
America and identified himself
as, in effect, Honorary President
of the Chamber of Commerce.
Once again he succeeded. Many
businessmen were eager to be
lieve that Lyndon Johnson was
really at heart the Lyndon John
son the Liberals had fought so
ardently against during 1960, that
the overtures he now was making
to the Liberals were merely a

'Private Lack Of Ethics'

sonal criticism of him is begin-1

And Ihe long shadow of Bobby

become the symbol of Mr. John

his past.
Synthetic Euphoria
Finally there is working against
Lyndon Johnson the fundament
ally synthetic nature of Amer
ica's present euphoria. It is not
only that we have been adminis
tered happy pills by the federal
government Ihe farmers, the old
folks, the labor unions, defense

Synthetic Euphoria
Finally there is working against
Lyndon Johnson the fundament
ally synthetic nature of Amer
ica's present euphoria. It is not
only that we have been adminis
tered happy pills by the federal
government Ihe farmers, the old
folks, the labor unions, defense
contractors, everybody. All the
microbes appear to be Demo- j
cratic-oriented, and are holding
back their poisons pending the j
renewal of their license in No
vember.
Things are hunky dory. Fewer j
people are killed in Vietnam than I
on the Merritt Parkway. Red
China hasn't been admitted to the |
United Nations. Khrushchev I
hasn't recently uttered an ultima-1
turn against West Berlin.
A cynical manipulator of the
world scene?
Precarious Equilibrium
Four years ago Khrushchev j
told Drew Pearson that he had |
intentionally laid low pending
what ho hoped would be the de-1
feat of Richard Nixon. Last July I
the leaders of the civil rights)
movement publicly instructed j
their followers to lay low pend-1
ing the successful conclusion of!
the campaign. A decision in Viet-!
nam is intentionally unconcluded I
pending the arrival and success
ful negotiation of the affair of:
November 3. The General Assem
bly of the United Nations oblig- j
ingly agrees not to convene to!
discuss the question of the admis- j
sion of Red China until, er, some
time in December or January.
But the tranquility sits on
some Americans on how many,
again we cannot know — as fic
titious, as having lamentably lit-J
tie to do with the nature of,
things; as suggesting not so
much an organic evolution into j
an era of peace and plenty, as a j
precarious equilibrium wrenched i
out of a mutinous world by the '
ten thumbs of Lyndon Johnson :
and his accommodating fellow ■
leaders. Can they maintain it for
just a few more weeks? There !
is no denying their skill. Or their
cynicism.

so much a rise in the popular
ity of Senator Golclwater as a
diminution in the popularity of
President Johnson.
It becomes clearer, in retro
spect, that Mr. Johnson made
some instant calculations, hours
after achieving office, concerning
his political future. Someone re
cently remarked that if America's
liberals had been informed in
1960 that the race in 1964 would
he between Lyndon Johnson and
Barry Golclwater, they would
probably have marched out into
the ocean and drowned themsel
ves.
Lyndon Johnson's image in
1960 was that of the Southern, or
at any rate Southwestern alter
native to the Eastern and dog
matically Liberal wing of th e
Democratic P a r t y. lie was
roundly denounced by the prin
cipal Liberal spokesman of the
day, the labor union spokesman,
the thunder-makers of the ADA.
the tablet-keepers of the Liberal
ideology. He did little to woo their
favor. On one occasion he even
denounced "the KKK and th e
ADA."
The New Johnson
But when Mr. Kennedy w a s
killed. Lyndon recognized that he
would be regarded by his most
.ypcal consituents much as Ham
let's uncle was when he came to
bed between incestuous sheets.
Accordingly, a new Johnson was
borne. Within minutes, or so il
seemed, he breathed fire into the
civil rights bill. He went to New
York and gave a speech so far
gone in UN-action as might have
struck even Mrs. Roosevelt as
fulsome. Medicare . . . Anti-pov
erty . . . Increased social secur
ity, . . . See the Yellow Pages of
the ADA Directory; practically
everything there was quickly
bought by Lydon Johnson on be
coming President. It paid off bril
liantly.
Having consolidated his sup
port among the Liberals, th e
President turned to Business
America and identified himself
as, in effect, Honorary President
of the Chamber of Commerce.
Once again he succeeded. Many
businessmen were eager to be
lieve that Lyndon Johnson was
really at heart the Lyndon John
son the Liberals had fought so
ardently against during 1960, that
the overtures he now was making
to the Liberals were merely a
part of that campaign oratory !
that Wendell Willkie had taught j
us. way back in 1940. was neces
sary to any man who wants to ;
boob-bait his way into the White
House.
'Private Lack Of Ethics'
It was going swimmingly for:
LBJ: but the more or less per- (
sonal criticism of him is begin-1
ning to tell. The public expects

water camp. But here was the
