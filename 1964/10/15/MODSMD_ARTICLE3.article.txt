As candidate of the Socialist
Workers Party. De Berry is tour
ing the country explaining why
the Democrats represent "the
same vicious system, backed by
the same corporate interests as

"and support these parties of the
capitalist power structure."
As a Marxist De Berry believes
that not only domestic injustices
but war are economic in causa

operating through its house or
gans. the major parties, has per
petrated and perpetuated the
Cold War which threatens, he be
lieves, to become quite hot before
