## Square Moorman Speaks 
### R.V. DENENBERG (First of a Two-Part Article) 
Square Moorman had only re
cently acquired the habit of mak
ing speeches, but the day after
the sheriff's election in Fayette
County, Tennessee, the burly Ne
gro cotton farmer felt he had
something important to say to a
certain gathering of college stu
dents, graduate students, and pro
fessors.
It was the send off party for
the 10 members of the Fayette
Project, who along with their Ne
gro hosts, sat on the tables or
lounged on the grass of the Ne
gro picnic grounds, listening to j
the gravelly intonation of Square i
Moorman's voice.
It was a speech of gratitude.
"I tried hard before to rouse!
the people, to organize them. But :
with your help I've been able to
do more this summer than in all J
these past years put together, j
You showed us the way."
At the beginning of last sum- '
mer Fayette County, in spirit, a
piece of Mississippi caught be- 1

hind the Tennessee state line, had
already come a long way from I
the violent days of 19.38 when Ne
groes first began to register to
vote. Some 1,500 Negroes in this
cotton county in the southwest
ern part of. the state had m a.n
aged to register after two federal
injunctions put an end to white I
primaries, the eviction of regis-;
tered Negro sharecroppers and
an economic boycott by white
stores and banks.
But Negroes never voted in
large numbers before and the test j
was to be provided in an August i
6 county election, in which a
white man openly sympathetic to
I lie Negroes and a local Negro;
minister were to run as inde-1
pendents for sheriff and tax as-'
sessor, respectively.
The Cornell group became in
terested in the Fayette election
When Charlie Haynie. a gradu
ate student, returned to the cam- j
pus last September after having i
spent the summer working on
voter registration in the county.!
Haynie believed that L. T. Red-j
fearn, the white man, and Rev. j
June Dowdy, the Negro minister,
stood a good chance of actually]
winning the election.
There were 17,000 Negroes in
the county and only 7,000 whites, 1
which meant that it might be pos-1
siblc to register more Negroesj
than there were eligible white
voters.
A Cornell Committee for Free I
and Fair Elections in Fayette!
County was formed to work on i
Negro registration in the two;
months preceding the election.
The group raised over $10,000
in contributions, some of which
came in the form of a grant of
$1,000 from Cornell's student
government one of the strong-,
est and most controversial actions
ever taken by that body. Several
disgruntled students petitioned,
and got a recall referendum 1
which nevertheless finally ap- ,
proved the grant by a 2-1 cam
pus vote.
Arriving in Fayette County in
mid-June, the volunteers moved
in with Negro families. A pair
of volunteers with a car lived in
each of the county's 15 electoral
districts.
The first three weeks were
spent covering every mile of dirt
road to find out exactly how
many Negroes were registered or
eligible and where they lived.
IjJach pair of volunteers made tie

tailed political census maps of
their districts, and began driving
eligible Negroes to the courthouse
on the one day of the week when
registration was open.
It became clear however by
the beginning of July that no
more than a few hundred Ne
groes could be registered before
the election. The registrar's, al
though having no literacy test to
administer, were frustratingly
slow. Out of 500 Negroes who
lined up to register one day, only
75 were actually enrolled. The
election could not be won. but
there were other things to be
done.
