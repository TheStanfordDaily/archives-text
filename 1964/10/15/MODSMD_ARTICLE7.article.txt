# Three Seek Speaker's Post; LASSU Will Decide Tonight
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
A week of quiet campaigning
in LASSU ends tonight as the
Legislature meets at 7:30 p.m.
in Room 320 to pick a Speaker
for the 1964-65 session.
Three students, one an old
member of LASSU, and two new
comers, are announced candi
dotes for the post.
THE TIIKEE are Clyde Chris
toffer.son, a member last year;
Ed Shaw a former student finan
cial manager; and Andy Williams,
a past Poli Union vice president.

In the past two years Speaker
elections have not generated too
much interest either in or out
of the Legislature. However, this
year all three candidates have
been working hard at gathering
votes.
Most observers regard Shaw
and Williams as the favorites and
feel that Christofferson will run
behind those two. However, a
large part of the Legislature is
at this time uncommitted, a un
official poll indicated.
ALL TIIRKE are experienced
in student government and ASSIJ
politics. Christofferson has served
for the past two years on the
LASSU By-Laws c o m mitt e e,
which handles most of the stu
dent legislation. Shaw served as
student financial manager last
year, a post which required close
contact with the Legislature. Wil
liams served in the Political
Union under Scott Mcßride, the
current ASSU President, and as
sisted in Mcßride's successful
campaign last spring.
In the meeting last week the
Legislature approved the election
rules. Foil o w in g nominating
speeches, each candidate will lie
entitled to make a ten minute
speech, after which a limited time
for debate by the legislators will
be allowed.
Each candidate has indicated

that he is considering certain
changes in LASSU if elected. Both
Shaw and Williams have s u g
gested changes in the committee
structure. Christofferson favors
changes in the areas of informa
tion and procedure.
PRESIDENTIAL assistant Pat
Forster said yesterday that aside
from the election of speaker no
major business is planned 112 or
tonight's session. He did state
thai anyone substituting at this
meeting for a regular member
must have written permission
from that member.
Mcßride is acting speaker to
night until the election results
are announced.
THIS YEAR'S ELECTION is
being held about three weeks
earlier in the quarter than was
last year's. Mcßride successfully
urged the Legislature to speed
up the election which according
to the By-Laws must be held at
the third meeting of the quarter.
The ASSU President felt that
having the ASSU President serve
as Speaker for the first six weeks
of the year weakened Legislative
appointment of committee chair
men had to be made by the Presi
dent during that period.
LASSU held two meetings last
Thursday in order to meet t h<>
requirement of the By-Laws at
the earliest possible date.

urged the Legislature to speed
up the election which according
to the By-Laws must be held at
the third meeting of the quarter.
The ASSU President felt that
having the ASSU President serve
as Speaker for the first six weeks
of the year weakened Legislative
appointment of committee chair
men had to be made by the Presi
dent during that period.
LASSU held two meetings last
Thursday in order to meet t h<>
requirement of the By-Laws at
the earliest possible date.
A week of quiet campaigning
in LASSU ends tonight as the
Legislature meets at 7:30 p.m.
in Room 320 to pick a Speaker
for the 1964-65 session.
Three students, one an old
member of LASSU, and two new
comers, are announced candi
dotes for the post.
THE TIIKEE are Clyde Chris
toffer.son, a member last year;
Ed Shaw a former student finan
cial manager; and Andy Williams,
a past Poli Union vice president.

In the past two years Speaker
elections have not generated too
much interest either in or out
of the Legislature. However, this
year all three candidates have
been working hard at gathering
votes.
Most observers regard Shaw
and Williams as the favorites and
feel that Christofferson will run
behind those two. However, a
large part of the Legislature is
at this time uncommitted, a un
official poll indicated.
ALL TIIRKE are experienced
in student government and ASSIJ
politics. Christofferson has served
for the past two years on the
LASSU By-Laws c o m mitt e e,
which handles most of the stu
dent legislation. Shaw served as
student financial manager last
year, a post which required close
contact with the Legislature. Wil
liams served in the Political
Union under Scott Mcßride, the
current ASSU President, and as
sisted in Mcßride's successful
campaign last spring.
In the meeting last week the
Legislature approved the election
rules. Foil o w in g nominating
speeches, each candidate will lie
entitled to make a ten minute
speech, after which a limited time
for debate by the legislators will
be allowed.
Each candidate has indicated

that he is considering certain
changes in LASSU if elected. Both
Shaw and Williams have s u g
gested changes in the committee
structure. Christofferson favors
changes in the areas of informa
tion and procedure.
PRESIDENTIAL assistant Pat
Forster said yesterday that aside
from the election of speaker no
major business is planned 112 or
tonight's session. He did state
thai anyone substituting at this
meeting for a regular member
must have written permission
from that member.
Mcßride is acting speaker to
night until the election results
are announced.
THIS YEAR'S ELECTION is
being held about three weeks
earlier in the quarter than was
last year's. Mcßride successfully
