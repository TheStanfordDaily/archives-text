Yoshiro Kikuchi, a member of
the Japanese Diet and Vict 1 min
ister ol Japan's Science and Tech
nology administration, said that
Ihe people of his country would
like tu see the United States take
a more commanding role in the
fight against Communism.
"We are grateful to the
United States for the security
with which they provide us," he
stated in a speech given last night
in the Otero Lounge. "But if the
United States would exert a more
forceful policy toward Russia and
Communist China, we would be
more grateful.
Disarmament without inspec
tion, Kikuchi said, is unrealistic,
and he went on to attack the
wheat deal with Russia. "Some
people feel the well-fed commu
nist is less dangerous than Ihe
hungry communist. We take the
opposite viewpoint."
During the Berlin crisis, Kiku
chi and the members of his con
stituency were disappointed by
the late stand that the American
military force took. "When we
saw the American soldiers in the
Japanese newsreels, however, that
was a great joy for us."
