MOSCOW (AP)-The Soviet
Union anounced through Tass
last night that Nikita S. Khru
shchev has been 'released' as
Communist secretary and prem
ier.
Leonid Brezhnev has been
named first secretary of the Com
munist Central Committee and
Alexei Kosygin has become
premier, the announcement said.
It added that Khrushchev asked
to be relieved of his duties be
cause of "his advanced age and
deterioration of his health."
The action closes a decade dur
which Khrushchev dominated
most of the Communist world. He
wound up with the Red world
shaken as Lenin and Stalin never
could have imagined in the
midst of ;ni ideological scramble
with Red China.
What effect the changes will
have on the Soviet Union's rela
tions with tiie West remains to
be seen.
In the eyes of Western diplo
mats, Brezhnev has seemed to
take action and to speak in a re
sponsible way, always of course
within the Soviet viewpoint.
Kosygin has been a leading
spokesman on the Soviet side in
1 lie dispute with China, a quarrel
that has tended at times to take
some of the heat off U.S.-Soviet
relat ions.
Poor health, and conceivably
an appraisal of poor results, were
probably the factors behind Khru
shchev's fall from power .just
three weeks before he hoped to
preside over a triumphant cele
bration of the 17th anniversary
of the Bolshevik Revolution.
The decision that Khrushchev
must gf) was reached at a ses
sion of tiie Central Committee of
the Communist party which be
gan Monday, informants said.
Mikhail Suslov, another spokes
man in the Kremlin's dispute with
Communist China, delivered the
key address. Suslov has appeared
at times to be lukewarm in his
support of Khrushchev.
