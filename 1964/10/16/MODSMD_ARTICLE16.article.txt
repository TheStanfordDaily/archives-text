# Powell And Evans In 'My Fair Ladyâ€™
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
Presenting "My Fair Lady" as
its first attraction, San Carlos'
Circle Star Theatre opened Tues
day night.
Although "My Fair Lady" does
not lend itself particularly well
to arena presentation, for the
most part this production suc
ceeds admirably.
TECHNICALLY the show is ex
cellent. All hough Hal Shafer's
sets are often too cumbersome,
they are always effective. Note
worthy also for its effectiveness
is A 1 Millman's lighting.
David Tihmar's inventive direc
tion and Zoya Leporska's lively
choreography are also quite
good.
"My Fair Lady," however, rises
or falls with the quality of its
cast, and here the Circle Star is
indeed fortunate.
I CAN IMAGINE no better
Henry Higgins than Michael
Evans. Keeping Higgins from
being romantic or sentimental,
yet making him sympathetic is a
difficult job, but he pulls it off.
Evans is, simply, superb.
Jane Powell is a lovely Eliza,
always warm and charming, but
she's just too American to make
Eliza's transformation really be
lievable.
Ben Wrigley, a delightfully
nimble Doolittle, and Laurie
Main, a properly brusque Picker
ing, head an excellent supporting
cast in which Terence Monck.
Cynthia Latham, Robert Miller
Driscoll and Jack Konzal stand
out. Mary Anderson, as Mrs.
Pearce, is a disaster.
