# The 						Jazz Track

### RICK BALE 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Kick
Bale's program JAZZ TRACK
appears on KZSII Thursday
evenings al seven.
The real essence of jazz lies in
j the live performance. The excite
| ment of spontaneous creativity is
j unparalleled in any recording.
I There is an all too prevalent myth
I on the peninsula that the leading
! jazz musicians seclude themsel
j ves in Chicago and New York
night clubs throughout the year,
but this is no longer true.
Following the emergence of
Monterey as the country's most
i respected jazz festival, San Fran
j cisco has become a major jazz
j center. The Bay Area now h a s
1 five major jazz clubs, and a host
I of small clubs and hotels featur
ing jazz on a weekend or part
j time basis.
THE MASONIC Auditorium and
the Berkeley Commuity Theater
will share a full jazz program in
! the coming months, and 1 certain
: !y hope that Stanford and the
j University of California will fol
low the fine example of jazz pro
gramming in Foothill Junior Col
lego's Fine Arts program.
In the coming weeks Jazz
Track will outline jazz activity
in the Bay Area during the follow
j ing weekend, with frequent re
| views of clubs and performances.
A major focus of the column
will be the growing trend among
clubs to admit minors, a policy
which is in effect in half of jazz
establishments presently.
OCTOBER JAZZ activity in the
Bay Area has been boosted by a j
fallout effect from the September i
Monterey festival, and the com
ing weekend is a busy one on the t
jazz scene.
Opening at the Jazz Workshop
Tuesday was tenor saxophonist j
John Coltrane. Opening night |
crowds were huge for this highly ;
imaginative jazzman, and sets will j
continue over the weekend at the i
North Beach club . . . Across the !
street from the Workshop is Bar- j
naby Con r ad's El Matador,
whose recent switch to jazz has ;
drawn capacity crowds nightly, j
Going into third week there are |
Vince Guaraldi and Bola Sete, who |
close October 17 to bo followed by
guitarist Juan Serranno ... At 1
tho end of the block on Broadway i
and Montgomery is new rival
Basin Street West, where Ahmad
Jainal opened this week. This 1
club, which opened just a few j
weeks ago and boasts an impres- |
sive list of advance bookings in- j
eluding Miles Davis, George
Shearing, Oscar Peterson, and
many others, is almost too good |
1o be true. The acoustics are mar- I
vclous, there is plush seating for!
350 on three decks with a view of 1
Iho city, and, because food is j
served, minors are welcome. All
this and no cover or minimum . . .
Singer-pianist Boh Dorough and
guitarist Al Shackman, who just
recorded "A Train Makes Me j
Lonely," with words by Kim No
vak (! > for RCA, continue sets at
The Trident in Sausilito.
Those of you that ski might re
member Shackman as accompian-1
ist for Bob Gibson at the Stanford
Winter Carnival last year. The
Trident, which is situated on the;
water and is probably among the j
most beautiful of all jazz clubs, j
charges no cover or minimum and j
is open to minors. . . . At the i
L'Horizon Room of the Hotel
Clareniont in Berkeley this week
end is the Cal Tjader quintet. The
new Claremont policy of combos |
on weekends is on a trial basis, j
and needs more support from the i
public to be maintained. I found
the opening of the room with
Vince Guaraldi and Bola Sete last
month very impressive, and
would hate to see this policy dis
continued at the Claremont. The
room is acoustically excellent,!
with a panoramic view of the city,
and minors are allowed.. . . Other
jazz doings around — Tin Pan
Alley in Redwood City, whose
jazz programming has been in
consistent since its recent open
ing, gets back on the right track
