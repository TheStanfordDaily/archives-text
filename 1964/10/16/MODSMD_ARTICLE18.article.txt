# HUSKIES HUNGRY FOR NO. 2
## Indians Prepare For Washington Invasion 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's resurgent Indians
take on Ihe perplexing Washing
ton Huskies tomorrow in an effort
to break Washington's five-game
win streak over the Cards and
gain their first Paeific Athletic
Conference victory.
The Huskies are an enigma this
season. Overwhelming favorites
in September to make it to the
Rose Bowl, they have lost three
of four games this season, and
five of their last seven overall.
AFTER sputtering to a 3-2 loss
to Air Force and being passed
to death by lowa, 28-18, Washing
ton still looked tough in the con
ference. After all, Coach Ji m
Owens' boys had lost the firs'
three last season and still bargee'
through six opponents to Pasa
dena.
Last weekend the confiden
Huskies took their first reach fo
1965's Roses against Oregon State
They came up with a handful ol
thorns. The Beavers threw up a
stodgy defense for a 9-7 win. That
result is ominous for the Indians,
j since Washington hasn't lost two
straight conference games in six
years.
But the Huskies will meet ?
Stanford team on the rebound
from two narrow defeats.
INDIAN PASSING has seldom
looked better. Against UCLA,
quarterback Terry DeSylvia com
pleted 17 of 24 and flanker Dave
Lewis caught all six passes with
in his reach. Last week DeSylvia
1 went three for four, while Dick
Berg, playing most of the game,
I tossed five of six completions.
This accuracy, plus the fact;
that the inept Husky pass de-j
' fense has given up over 200 yards j
a game this season, means spec
tators will most likely witness a
massive Card passing attack to
| morrow.
I Washington has been drilling
j frantically on pass defense all
! week long. Owens can afford to !
! let his ground defense rest. Wash-1
; ington has allowed a mere 76
yards per game on the ground.
AGAINST the purple-and-gold's
forward wall, the Indians will
hurl halfback Ray Handley — j
the nation's leading ground
gainer — and an offensive line:
averaging 210 pounds.
Although thrice-beaten, Wash
ington is as always very danger-!
ous. Fullback Junior "Instant"
Coffey has piled up 370 yards
i rushing.
The Cards remember halfback 1
' Ron Medved well. Last year he |
, bolted 88 yards up the middle for j
| the first H u sky touchdown !
| against Stanford.
LEADING scorer is Charley

Browning, with four touchdowns,
two on runs of 13 and 38 yards.
Stanford rooters had better hope
that few punts are kicked to 150-
pound Steve Bramwell, who spe
cializes in running them back for
touchdowns.
One highlight of the game will
be the battle of the number 66's,
Rick Redman of Washington and
Jack Chappie of Stanford. Red

man, a unanimous All-American
pick last year, has 57 tackles this
year. Both men have boon strong
in stopping line plunges.
If Stanford loses the ball more
than three times tomorrow on
fumbles or interceptions, look for
a Husky victory. The Cards will
match Washington in statistics,
but mistakes should determine
the outcome.
