Tonight, there will be a dance-;
rally with the music provided by
The Playboys, who will play R&R
music from 7:30 to 10:30. Con-j
ducted by the band, the pom-pon j
girls, and the yell leaders, the
rally itself will begin at 8:00. It
is hoped both people on dates
and passersby will stop to join
in the festivities.
A suggestion box for cheers
has been placed at Engineering
Corner. Any ideas, clever, subtle,
and otherwise, will be appreciated.
The card section, although good
last week, needs improvement.
Films of two of the stunts will be
shown at the Sunday flicks.
