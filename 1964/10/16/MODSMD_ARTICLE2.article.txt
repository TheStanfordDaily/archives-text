(APJ U.S. officials expressed
belief last night that Nikita Khru
shchev was forced oul of his posi
tions as Soviet premier and chief
of the Soviet Communist party be
cause of major issues of policy.
Speculation here centered on
the probability that others in the
Soviet ruling group were dis
pleased primarily with Khru
shchev's handling of t he problem
of lies within the Communist bloc
- a problem arising out of t he
split between the Soviet Union
and Rod China.
In the U.S. view it is consid
ered likely that Khrushchev's
critics felt that the Soviet Union
had lost too much influence with
the Communist countries of East
ern Europe, which have shown
increasing independence, and with
Communist parties in Western
Europe. Only Wednesday, the
French Communist party asserted
its independence of leadership
from any other party.
The U.S. officials took the posi
tion last night that news of the
surprise shakeup in Moscow had
been received here with calm and
without any sense of alarm. They
reported no evidence of any un
usual military activity on the
part of the Russians and said
there was no alert on the part
of the United States.
Some government experts dis
counted the possibility of any
radical change in Soviet policies
under Ihe new leadership, but
high officials refused any pre
diction. saying it was much too
early to assess what the new lead
ers might do.
