## Cardinals Win Series 
### 
ST. LOUIS (AP) â€” The St.
Louis Cardinals won their first
World Series championship in 18
years Thursday, whipping the
New York Yankees 7-5 in the
seventh and deciding game.
FIRE-BALLING Bob Gibson,
supported by an attack that in
cluded homers by Lou Brock and
Ken Boyer, pitched his second
victory of the Series despite Yan
kee slugging and set an all-time
strikeout record for baseball's fall
classic. He fanned nine, giving
him 31 for the Series.
BOBBY Richardson's two sin
gles for the Yanks gave him 13
hits for this Series, another rec
ord.
The Cards exploited their base
running skills in the fourth inn
ing with three runs off rookie
Mel Stottlemyre, then did some
long-range hilling off A 1 Down
ing for three more runs in the
fifth. Boyer's homer in the sev
enth, his third hit of the day,
closed out the St. Louis scoring.
