## NSA: More Than Its Congress 
### 
Dear Sir:
The? Editor has made some valid '
criticisms of the National Stu
dent Association Congress. For!
example, ho pointed to the inel'fi
cient operation and structure of
the Congress. Inefficiency seems
to be part of the essence of large
scale democratically run conven-1
tions, but at the NSA Congress
in particular, there is so little
time to consider so many prob
lems that many resolutions arc
poorly written, and many prob
lems inadequately researched.
Furthermore, as was pointed
out. too much time at the Con-;
gross is spent on political issues,
and not enough time considering
programs of direct benefit to the
student and the educational com
munity.
Certainly the structure of the
Congress is in need of reform.
Seminars and legislative sessions
should center around the imple
mentation of NSA programs. Yet.
here I should add that most dele
gates do come away from the ■
Congress fairly familiar with :
NSA's programs.
It also seems to me that the!
editor lias, throughout the d is-1
cussion so far, made the mistake
of judging NSA solely by its Con
gress, emphasizing the deficien
cies of that Congress, without
c on si d e ring NSA's activities
throughout the year. Among these I
are foreign exchange student
scholarships. Educational Travel, j
Inc. (which offers some fantastic!
tours and discounts for the travel-!
ing student), student-run tutorial I
projects, research into problems i
of American higher education,
and a low cost student life-insur
ance plan, to name a few.
The degree of politicization of

NSA has been exaggerated by Mr.
Nay lor, although he conceded in
his article "NSA Debate: More
Politics or None" that the Con
gress adjourned with those fight
ing increased politici/.ation in
control. He cited twenty-five gov
ernments condemned by the last
NSA Congress, but did not men
tion that these governments were
not condemned for their social or
economic policies, but for sup
pression of basic academic free
doms and civil liberties.
Furthermore, Ivlr. Naylor listed
only legislation passed at the last
Congress, whereas tlie heart of
NSA policy pronouncements con
sists in Basic Policy Declarations
which must be passed at two suc
cessive Congresses by a two-thirds
vote, after which they become the
basic and continuing policy of the
Association, reconsideration be
ing mandatory only every five
years. The vast majority of these
Basic Policy Declarations are non
political and educational in na
ture.
In any case, we should not
judge the degree of politicization
of NSA by the number of politi
cal stands taken at Congresses,
but by the manner in which it
allocates its staff and money
throughout the year. In this lat
ter respect, we find that NSA
does little to advance any par
ticular set of political ideas, but
is active in providing services
such as those mentioned previ
ously in this article, services
which can be approved by left
and right alike.
Another important point is that
resolutions calling for political or
social action by students, such as
those calling for organization of
migrant laborers and commit

ment to civil rights, must be im
plemented on the local campus if
they are to be implemented at
all. These resolutions art 4 recom
mendatory and not binding.
NSA at Stanford is not primar
ily a branch of the national office,
but is what Stanford students
choose to make of it. Its empha
sis here has been and will prob
ably continue to be education.
Among new programs planned
for the coming year are a tuto
rial program in East Palo Alto
and a "crises center" to provide
analyses of fast-breaking news
events. We will do our best to
carry out suggestions from stu
dents for new programs that fall
within our scope.

Dear Sir:
We are pleased that such an
authority as The Stanford Poll
has revealed the supremacy of
conservatism in Wilbur.
This poll shows that the Frosh
Men have not been taken in by
the liberal, ivory-tower pseudo
intellectualism that is so fashion
able among our "sophisticated"
upperclassmen.
IT IS refreshing, indeed, to see
that, even after a week of West
ern Civ., the majority of Frosh
Men are still clear thinkers.
In addition, a careful analysis
of this poll might explain the dat
ing predicament of the Frosh
Dollies: with sixty-seven percent
of them supporting LBJ & Co., it
is little wonder that sixty percent
spend lonely weekend evenings.

• Unsophisticated Frosh
Dear Sir:
We are pleased that such an
authority as The Stanford Poll
has revealed the supremacy of
conservatism in Wilbur.
This poll shows that the Frosh
Men have not been taken in by
the liberal, ivory-tower pseudo
intellectualism that is so fashion
able among our "sophisticated"
upperclassmen.
IT IS refreshing, indeed, to see
that, even after a week of West
ern Civ., the majority of Frosh
Men are still clear thinkers.
In addition, a careful analysis
of this poll might explain the dat
ing predicament of the Frosh
Dollies: with sixty-seven percent
of them supporting LBJ & Co., it
is little wonder that sixty percent
spend lonely weekend evenings.

Dear Sir:
The? Editor has made some valid '
criticisms of the National Stu
dent Association Congress. For!
example, ho pointed to the inel'fi
cient operation and structure of
the Congress. Inefficiency seems
to be part of the essence of large
scale democratically run conven-1
tions, but at the NSA Congress
in particular, there is so little
time to consider so many prob
lems that many resolutions arc
poorly written, and many prob
lems inadequately researched.
Furthermore, as was pointed
out. too much time at the Con-;
gross is spent on political issues,
and not enough time considering
programs of direct benefit to the
student and the educational com
munity.
Certainly the structure of the
Congress is in need of reform.
Seminars and legislative sessions
should center around the imple
mentation of NSA programs. Yet.
here I should add that most dele
gates do come away from the ■
Congress fairly familiar with :
NSA's programs.
It also seems to me that the!
editor lias, throughout the d is-1
cussion so far, made the mistake
of judging NSA solely by its Con
gress, emphasizing the deficien
cies of that Congress, without
c on si d e ring NSA's activities
throughout the year. Among these I
are foreign exchange student
scholarships. Educational Travel, j
Inc. (which offers some fantastic!
tours and discounts for the travel-!
ing student), student-run tutorial I
projects, research into problems i
of American higher education,
and a low cost student life-insur
ance plan, to name a few.
The degree of politicization of

NSA has been exaggerated by Mr.
Nay lor, although he conceded in
his article "NSA Debate: More
Politics or None" that the Con
gress adjourned with those fight
ing increased politici/.ation in
control. He cited twenty-five gov
ernments condemned by the last
NSA Congress, but did not men
tion that these governments were
not condemned for their social or
economic policies, but for sup
pression of basic academic free
doms and civil liberties.
Furthermore, Ivlr. Naylor listed
only legislation passed at the last
Congress, whereas tlie heart of
NSA policy pronouncements con
sists in Basic Policy Declarations
which must be passed at two suc
cessive Congresses by a two-thirds
vote, after which they become the
basic and continuing policy of the
Association, reconsideration be
ing mandatory only every five
years. The vast majority of these
Basic Policy Declarations are non
political and educational in na
ture.
In any case, we should not
judge the degree of politicization
of NSA by the number of politi
cal stands taken at Congresses,
but by the manner in which it
allocates its staff and money
throughout the year. In this lat
ter respect, we find that NSA
does little to advance any par
ticular set of political ideas, but
is active in providing services
such as those mentioned previ
ously in this article, services
which can be approved by left
and right alike.
Another important point is that
resolutions calling for political or
social action by students, such as
those calling for organization of
migrant laborers and commit

ment to civil rights, must be im
plemented on the local campus if
they are to be implemented at
all. These resolutions art 4 recom
mendatory and not binding.
NSA at Stanford is not primar
ily a branch of the national office,
but is what Stanford students
choose to make of it. Its empha
sis here has been and will prob
ably continue to be education.

Basic Policy Declarations are non
political and educational in na
ture.
In any case, we should not
judge the degree of politicization
of NSA by the number of politi
cal stands taken at Congresses,
but by the manner in which it
allocates its staff and money
throughout the year. In this lat
ter respect, we find that NSA
does little to advance any par
ticular set of political ideas, but
is active in providing services
such as those mentioned previ
ously in this article, services
which can be approved by left
and right alike.
Another important point is that
resolutions calling for political or
social action by students, such as
those calling for organization of
migrant laborers and commit

ment to civil rights, must be im
plemented on the local campus if
they are to be implemented at
all. These resolutions art 4 recom
mendatory and not binding.
NSA at Stanford is not primar
ily a branch of the national office,
but is what Stanford students
choose to make of it. Its empha
sis here has been and will prob
ably continue to be education.
Among new programs planned
for the coming year are a tuto
rial program in East Palo Alto
and a "crises center" to provide
analyses of fast-breaking news
events. We will do our best to
carry out suggestions from stu
dents for new programs that fall
within our scope.

Dear Sir:
We are pleased that such an
authority as The Stanford Poll
has revealed the supremacy of
conservatism in Wilbur.
This poll shows that the Frosh
Men have not been taken in by
the liberal, ivory-tower pseudo
intellectualism that is so fashion
able among our "sophisticated"
upperclassmen.
IT IS refreshing, indeed, to see
that, even after a week of West
ern Civ., the majority of Frosh
Men are still clear thinkers.
In addition, a careful analysis
of this poll might explain the dat
ing predicament of the Frosh
Dollies: with sixty-seven percent
of them supporting LBJ & Co., it
is little wonder that sixty percent
spend lonely weekend evenings.

Dear Sir:
The? Editor has made some valid '
criticisms of the National Stu
dent Association Congress. For!
example, ho pointed to the inel'fi
cient operation and structure of
the Congress. Inefficiency seems
to be part of the essence of large
scale democratically run conven-1
tions, but at the NSA Congress
in particular, there is so little
time to consider so many prob
lems that many resolutions arc
poorly written, and many prob
lems inadequately researched.
Furthermore, as was pointed
out. too much time at the Con-;
gross is spent on political issues,
and not enough time considering
programs of direct benefit to the
student and the educational com
munity.
Certainly the structure of the
Congress is in need of reform.
Seminars and legislative sessions
should center around the imple
mentation of NSA programs. Yet.
here I should add that most dele
gates do come away from the ■
Congress fairly familiar with :
NSA's programs.
It also seems to me that the!
editor lias, throughout the d is-1
cussion so far, made the mistake
of judging NSA solely by its Con
gress, emphasizing the deficien
cies of that Congress, without
c on si d e ring NSA's activities
throughout the year. Among these I
are foreign exchange student
scholarships. Educational Travel, j
Inc. (which offers some fantastic!
tours and discounts for the travel-!
ing student), student-run tutorial I
projects, research into problems i
of American higher education,
and a low cost student life-insur
ance plan, to name a few.
The degree of politicization of

NSA has been exaggerated by Mr.
Nay lor, although he conceded in
his article "NSA Debate: More
Politics or None" that the Con
gress adjourned with those fight
ing increased politici/.ation in
control. He cited twenty-five gov
ernments condemned by the last
NSA Congress, but did not men
tion that these governments were
not condemned for their social or
economic policies, but for sup
pression of basic academic free
doms and civil liberties.
Furthermore, Ivlr. Naylor listed
only legislation passed at the last
Congress, whereas tlie heart of
NSA policy pronouncements con
sists in Basic Policy Declarations
which must be passed at two suc
cessive Congresses by a two-thirds
vote, after which they become the
basic and continuing policy of the
Association, reconsideration be
ing mandatory only every five
years. The vast majority of these
Basic Policy Declarations are non
political and educational in na
ture.
In any case, we should not
judge the degree of politicization
of NSA by the number of politi
cal stands taken at Congresses,
but by the manner in which it
allocates its staff and money
throughout the year. In this lat
