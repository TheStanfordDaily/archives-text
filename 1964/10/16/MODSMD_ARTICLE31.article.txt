## Barry Hits Big Issues, But Dialogue impossible 
### Walter Lippmann 
There is a feeling, which I re
spect, I hat an election campaign
ought to bring on a discussion of
the great problems which con
front the country and trouble the
people, and that this campaign is
not producing such a discussion.
There are some who are so dis
appointed that they think nothing
is at stake, or at least that the
best they can do is to choose the
lesser of two evils. A cynic il h;is
been said, is a disappointed ideal
ist, and it is the disappointed
idealists, looking in vain for good
answers to the great questions,
who find that the campaign is
boring and that they could easily
become indifferent to it.
There Is A ( lioice
Those who are aware that there
is a choice, that it is in fact a
momentous choice, argue that
Sen. Barry Goldwater is a chal
lenger who touches ihe profound
issues. For myself. I agree w i th
this. However vague and unin
formed Sen. GoMwater's speeches,
he is reflecting problems which
no one can ignore.
I! is true that in the course of
three great wars the federal gov
ernment has expanded enorm
ously. It is also true that the
changeover from a predominantly
rural to a predominantly urban
society has caused all American
governments at the local, state
and national levels to expand
greatly. All this is costly, complex
and far from satisfactory.
But to turn this conglomera
tion of problems into campaign
issues is another matter. No one,
the candidates or the commenta
tors, has elicited from the turbu
lent collection of problems a scr
ies of defined issues. Senator
Goldwater is not even beginning
to do that.
No Solutions For Problems
The formula of his campaign is
in fact to point to a problem, to
crime and to vice, to sin and to
anxiety, to the expansion of gov
ernment, to the frustrations and
limitations of our world power
and to hope that because he has
named the problems the voters
will think lie has solved them.

He poses no issues that can be
debated. Who is not against sin,
crime, violence,'against large and
cumbersome government, against
being thwarted in our relations
with the rest of the world?
It is a false kind of perfection
ism to expect the Democrats to
respond to the challenge of Gold
water by stately discussions of
the problem of modern morality,
of the problem of federalism and
the problems of the world situa
tion.
II Johnson Were Jefferson
This would not be possible if
Lyndon Johnson were Thomas
Jefferson, Woodrow Wilson,
Franklin Roosevelt and Adlai
Stevenson rolled into one. For it.
takes at least two to hold a dis
cussion, and the Goldwater attack
is worlds away from John Adams,
from Taft and Hughes and Dewey,
from the younger Eisenhower of
1952.
If there were to be a debate, it
would have to be a genuine dia
logue and not a Johnson soliloquy.
It has not been possible to have a
dialogue with Barry Goldwater.
There is a deeper reason why
the protests which Goldwater
voices have not brought forth im
pressive state papers in reply. It
is that the protests touch prob
lems which cover the whole area
of modern life.
Why Anxious Affluence?
Nobody knows, for example,
just why our affluent society is
filled with so much anxiety, or
just why crime is increasing so
alarmingly among tne young, or
how the United States is to ad
just its military and ecomonie
strength to the impressive new
power of Europe and to the ris
ing expectations of a host of new
nations.
These are all matters which
can be mentioned, but which can
not be debated seriously in an
election not even in that ideal
election, which has never take n
place, between two very nearly
perfect candidate; - .. They could not
be discussed even by them, be
cause the wisest men among us
are still searching for, but have
not found, the answers.
