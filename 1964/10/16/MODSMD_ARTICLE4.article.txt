# Brezhnev
## 
### 
(APt Leonid Brezhnev is a
native of the Ukraine and a thirty
three year veteran of the Com
munist Party. He is fifty-seven
years old.
In July 1964, presumably with
Khrushchev's approval, Brezhnev
was moved from the largely cere
monial job of president to more
important work as Deputy First
Secretary of the Party.
At this time there was much
comment that Brezhnev was be
ing "groomed" as a possible suc
cessor to Khrushchev. Brezhnev
has always adhered to Khru
shchev line in major policy mat
ters.
