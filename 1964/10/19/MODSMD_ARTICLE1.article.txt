# Hoover Profs Give Analysis Of Kremlin Shake-up
## 
### BOB BJORING 
Some of the Soviet experts on the Stan
lord faculty have begun to comment on the
implications of the recent leadership shake-up
in the Kremlin in which Leonid Brezhnev and
Alexci Kosygin replaced Nikita Khrushchev as
leaders of the Russian Communist Govern
ment.
Prof. Wit old Sworakowski, Assistant Di
rector of the Hoover Institute, said the group
responsible for Khrushchev's removal had
been resentful of his single-handed leadership
of the Communist movement.
"It now seems clear," he said, "that the
people around Khrushchev wanted to get him
out of power." The day before the shake-up,
the French Communist Party had published
a declaration of independence saying that
they would no longer uphold the Russian line
in their country. The Italian Communists had
done the same one week earlier.
After Stalin's death, Malenkov and Bui
ganin had promised a "collective" leadership
which would erase tho bad aspects of the

previous monolithic government. Khrushchev
had then "collected all the power in his own
hand."
This, Prof. Sworakowski lelt, was the prin
ciple objection that the followers of Brezhnev
and Kosygin had for the Soviet Premier's
leadership. The Professor went on to say that
a collective government is "unrealistic in a
country like the Soviet Union." He believes
the present government will be rather un
stable.
THE BRIOZHNEV-KOSYGIN government
has promised to follow the policies of the
Khrushchev regime. "This can't happen," Prof.
Sorakowski said. "The changes will take some
time, but they will come."
In particular, Brezhnev has already post
poned a World Communist Congress. Khru
shchev had planned this to be a triumphant
show of party unity, but the present govern
ment believes either that this is impossible or
must have more work put into it.
It was this situation that Prof. Anatole G.
Mazour of the History Department viewed as

Khrushchev's chief failing. The French and
Italian declarations and the rift with the
Communist Chinese showed that the Commu
nist parties had reached the point of non-co
operation.
Although this was the primary factor in
Prof. Mazour's view, he listed several other
weaknesses in the policies of the former So
viet. government.
• The agricultural problem was still not
satisfactorily solved. The wheat deals with
Canada and the United States represented a
considerable embarrassment for the Soviet
leaders.
• Krushchev was raher "flambuoyant" ac
cording to Mazour. "He said things no states
man or diplomat should say. A statesman
should be eloquently silent."
• Brezhnev is only 60 years old, and Kosy
gin 55. They are members of what Prof. Ma
zour termed the "new" school. Khrushchev
was nearly 71.
• Before his removal, Khrushchev had an
nounced that production emphasis would be

put on consumer goods. This, Mazour thinks,
the new government will recind.
THIS WAS not the view, however, of Prof.
Stefan Possony, the Director of the Interna
tional Political Studies Program at the Hoover
Institute. "I have never seen a change in gov
ernment," he stated, "that is not accompanied
by a change in policies."
He foresees a much "harder" line toward
the western countries. And he also believes
that the chief mission of the Brezhnev-Kosy
gin government will be the strengthening of
ties with the Communist Chinese and the
French and Italian parties. He said, "The Chi
nese crisis is a thing which the Soviets cannot
afford. Khrushchev's p e r s onal animosity
created an untenable situation."
PROF. MILORAD Drachkovitch, an expert
on the development of the Communist move
ment, saw Ihe recent coup as a necessary
change. Khrushchev had lost authority over
the other Communist parties and nations. The
Soviet Union was in a hole as a result of this.
Any change, according to Drachkovitch,

would be positive. The Brezhnev-Kosygin gov
ernment lias the chance to begin anew in rela
tions with Communist China, in finding solu
tions to the agricultural problem, and in short
to rework all of the rusty hinges in the Com
munist setup.
Prof. Drachkoviteh found some irony in
ihe shake-up. "Marxism tells us that historical
phenomena are due to the influence of non
personal forces." In the case of Khrushchev's
turnout, he said, this was not true. Khru
shchev's personal antagonism and alienated
Red China and last sway with the Satellites
and the French and Italian parties. Khru
shchev's personal defects had lead to security
risks, bragging, and general bad relations.
Of the Professors interviewed, Drachko
viteh was the only man who found significance
in the recent explosion of Communist China's
first nuclear device While admitting that actu
ally it had little effect without a suitable de
livery system and perfection of the device
itself, nevertheless "one cannot forget the psy
chological implications of the Bomb."

• Krushchev was raher "flambuoyant" ac
cording to Mazour. "He said things no states
man or diplomat should say. A statesman
should be eloquently silent."
• Brezhnev is only 60 years old, and Kosy
gin 55. They are members of what Prof. Ma
zour termed the "new" school. Khrushchev
was nearly 71.
• Before his removal, Khrushchev had an
nounced that production emphasis would be

put on consumer goods. This, Mazour thinks,
the new government will recind.
THIS WAS not the view, however, of Prof.
Stefan Possony, the Director of the Interna
tional Political Studies Program at the Hoover
Institute. "I have never seen a change in gov
ernment," he stated, "that is not accompanied
by a change in policies."
He foresees a much "harder" line toward
the western countries. And he also believes
that the chief mission of the Brezhnev-Kosy
gin government will be the strengthening of
ties with the Communist Chinese and the
French and Italian parties. He said, "The Chi
nese crisis is a thing which the Soviets cannot
afford. Khrushchev's p e r s onal animosity
created an untenable situation."
PROF. MILORAD Drachkovitch, an expert
on the development of the Communist move
ment, saw Ihe recent coup as a necessary
change. Khrushchev had lost authority over
the other Communist parties and nations. The
Soviet Union was in a hole as a result of this.
Any change, according to Drachkovitch,

would be positive. The Brezhnev-Kosygin gov
ernment lias the chance to begin anew in rela
tions with Communist China, in finding solu
tions to the agricultural problem, and in short
to rework all of the rusty hinges in the Com
munist setup.
Prof. Drachkoviteh found some irony in
ihe shake-up. "Marxism tells us that historical
phenomena are due to the influence of non
personal forces." In the case of Khrushchev's
turnout, he said, this was not true. Khru
shchev's personal antagonism and alienated
Red China and last sway with the Satellites
and the French and Italian parties. Khru
shchev's personal defects had lead to security
risks, bragging, and general bad relations.
Of the Professors interviewed, Drachko
viteh was the only man who found significance
in the recent explosion of Communist China's
first nuclear device While admitting that actu
ally it had little effect without a suitable de
livery system and perfection of the device
itself, nevertheless "one cannot forget the psy
chological implications of the Bomb."
Some of the Soviet experts on the Stan
lord faculty have begun to comment on the
implications of the recent leadership shake-up
in the Kremlin in which Leonid Brezhnev and
Alexci Kosygin replaced Nikita Khrushchev as
leaders of the Russian Communist Govern
ment.
Prof. Wit old Sworakowski, Assistant Di
rector of the Hoover Institute, said the group
responsible for Khrushchev's removal had
been resentful of his single-handed leadership
of the Communist movement.
"It now seems clear," he said, "that the
people around Khrushchev wanted to get him
out of power." The day before the shake-up,
the French Communist Party had published
a declaration of independence saying that
they would no longer uphold the Russian line
in their country. The Italian Communists had
done the same one week earlier.
After Stalin's death, Malenkov and Bui
ganin had promised a "collective" leadership
which would erase tho bad aspects of the

previous monolithic government. Khrushchev
had then "collected all the power in his own
hand."
This, Prof. Sworakowski lelt, was the prin
ciple objection that the followers of Brezhnev
and Kosygin had for the Soviet Premier's
leadership. The Professor went on to say that
a collective government is "unrealistic in a
country like the Soviet Union." He believes
the present government will be rather un
stable.
THE BRIOZHNEV-KOSYGIN government
has promised to follow the policies of the
Khrushchev regime. "This can't happen," Prof.
Sorakowski said. "The changes will take some
time, but they will come."
In particular, Brezhnev has already post
poned a World Communist Congress. Khru
shchev had planned this to be a triumphant
show of party unity, but the present govern
ment believes either that this is impossible or
must have more work put into it.
It was this situation that Prof. Anatole G.
Mazour of the History Department viewed as

Khrushchev's chief failing. The French and
Italian declarations and the rift with the
Communist Chinese showed that the Commu
nist parties had reached the point of non-co
operation.
Although this was the primary factor in
Prof. Mazour's view, he listed several other
weaknesses in the policies of the former So
viet. government.
• The agricultural problem was still not
satisfactorily solved. The wheat deals with
Canada and the United States represented a
considerable embarrassment for the Soviet
leaders.
• Krushchev was raher "flambuoyant" ac

itself, nevertheless "one cannot forget the psy
chological implications of the Bomb."
Some of the Soviet experts on the Stan
lord faculty have begun to comment on the
implications of the recent leadership shake-up
in the Kremlin in which Leonid Brezhnev and
Alexci Kosygin replaced Nikita Khrushchev as
leaders of the Russian Communist Govern
ment.
Prof. Wit old Sworakowski, Assistant Di
rector of the Hoover Institute, said the group
responsible for Khrushchev's removal had
been resentful of his single-handed leadership
of the Communist movement.
"It now seems clear," he said, "that the
people around Khrushchev wanted to get him
out of power." The day before the shake-up,
the French Communist Party had published
a declaration of independence saying that
they would no longer uphold the Russian line
in their country. The Italian Communists had
done the same one week earlier.
After Stalin's death, Malenkov and Bui
ganin had promised a "collective" leadership
which would erase tho bad aspects of the

previous monolithic government. Khrushchev
had then "collected all the power in his own
hand."
This, Prof. Sworakowski lelt, was the prin
ciple objection that the followers of Brezhnev
and Kosygin had for the Soviet Premier's
leadership. The Professor went on to say that
a collective government is "unrealistic in a
country like the Soviet Union." He believes
the present government will be rather un
stable.
THE BRIOZHNEV-KOSYGIN government
has promised to follow the policies of the
Khrushchev regime. "This can't happen," Prof.
Sorakowski said. "The changes will take some
time, but they will come."
In particular, Brezhnev has already post
poned a World Communist Congress. Khru
shchev had planned this to be a triumphant
show of party unity, but the present govern
ment believes either that this is impossible or
must have more work put into it.
It was this situation that Prof. Anatole G.
Mazour of the History Department viewed as

Khrushchev's chief failing. The French and
Italian declarations and the rift with the
Communist Chinese showed that the Commu
nist parties had reached the point of non-co
operation.
Although this was the primary factor in
Prof. Mazour's view, he listed several other
weaknesses in the policies of the former So
viet. government.
• The agricultural problem was still not
satisfactorily solved. The wheat deals with
Canada and the United States represented a
considerable embarrassment for the Soviet
leaders.
• Krushchev was raher "flambuoyant" ac
cording to Mazour. "He said things no states
man or diplomat should say. A statesman
should be eloquently silent."
• Brezhnev is only 60 years old, and Kosy
gin 55. They are members of what Prof. Ma
zour termed the "new" school. Khrushchev
was nearly 71.
• Before his removal, Khrushchev had an
nounced that production emphasis would be

put on consumer goods. This, Mazour thinks,
the new government will recind.
THIS WAS not the view, however, of Prof.
Stefan Possony, the Director of the Interna
tional Political Studies Program at the Hoover
Institute. "I have never seen a change in gov
ernment," he stated, "that is not accompanied
by a change in policies."
He foresees a much "harder" line toward
the western countries. And he also believes
that the chief mission of the Brezhnev-Kosy
gin government will be the strengthening of
ties with the Communist Chinese and the
French and Italian parties. He said, "The Chi
nese crisis is a thing which the Soviets cannot
afford. Khrushchev's p e r s onal animosity
created an untenable situation."
PROF. MILORAD Drachkovitch, an expert
on the development of the Communist move
ment, saw Ihe recent coup as a necessary
change. Khrushchev had lost authority over
the other Communist parties and nations. The
Soviet Union was in a hole as a result of this.
Any change, according to Drachkovitch,

would be positive. The Brezhnev-Kosygin gov
ernment lias the chance to begin anew in rela
tions with Communist China, in finding solu
tions to the agricultural problem, and in short
to rework all of the rusty hinges in the Com
munist setup.
Prof. Drachkoviteh found some irony in
ihe shake-up. "Marxism tells us that historical
phenomena are due to the influence of non
personal forces." In the case of Khrushchev's
turnout, he said, this was not true. Khru
shchev's personal antagonism and alienated
Red China and last sway with the Satellites
and the French and Italian parties. Khru
shchev's personal defects had lead to security
risks, bragging, and general bad relations.
Of the Professors interviewed, Drachko
viteh was the only man who found significance
in the recent explosion of Communist China's
first nuclear device While admitting that actu
ally it had little effect without a suitable de
livery system and perfection of the device
itself, nevertheless "one cannot forget the psy
