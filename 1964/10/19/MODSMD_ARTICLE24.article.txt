# American Institute For Foreign Trade
## 
### 
Students interested in foreign trade and world business will have an unusual
opportunity to discuss current developments and prospects in the international
field when Dr. Robert L. Gulick, Jr., Dean of Admissions for the American Insti
tute for Foreign Trade (Thunderbird), Phoenix, Arizona, comes to this campus
on October 28th, 1 964.
The recent affiliation of the Institute with the American Management Associa
tion, a leading private enterprise group having a membership of over 32,000
progressive business firms, is of major importance. The AMA [ias a special divi
sion devoted to international commerce and is quite possibly the most influen
tial body in this country representing American interests abroad. This very direct
connection with unquestioned leaders of U.S. industry—the members of AMA—
is sure to lead to even greater opportunities for graduates of the Institute and
will certainly result in more concerns providing a greater variety of posts for
graduates.
There is today an increasing demand for you men and women qualifed to rep
resent America's expanding interests abroad. Companies want college grad
uates with such backgrounds as Agricultural Economics, Engineering, Accounting,
Social Anthropology, Marketing, Food Technology, Psychology and Foreign Trade.
Two highly successful Thunderbirds had undergraduate majors in Music. Among
the more than 1,500 employers of AIFT alumni are First National City Bank,
Monsanto Union Carbide, Chase Manhattan Bank, Hilton Hotels, Goodyear,
Sterling Products International, the U.S. Government, and private and religious
welfare groups, with activities in over eighty countries.
The Institute's curriculum emphasizes three main fields—languages most wanted
by companies (Spanish, Portuguese, French), area studies, and world trade and
banking. Language classes, taught by native teachers using the most advanced
methods, are limited to eight students. International business courses, presented
by scholars with a minimum experience of ten years as executives in foreign
lands are tailored to meet the needs of students in classes of seminar size. The
training is rigorous, with three to five hours a day on language study and the
balance of a very full schedule divided between the area studies and the tech
nical side of foreign trade.
The placement record is an astonishing one. Of students available for employ
ment in 1 964, 95 % of the January class and 86 % of the May class were placed
before graduation. The salaries received by alumni, together with special allow
ances for foreign sevice, run noticeably higher than the average given to per
sonnel having a year of graduate training (similar in length of time to the In
stitute's Bachelor of Foreign Trade degree); the difference tends to widen over
a five-year period.
If interested in the international economic field, students are invited to make an
appointment through the placement office for an interview with Dean Gulick,
who returned to American this year after spending more than a decade in
Libya, North Africa. Dean Gulick's career has included several years as Lecturer
in the Institute of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, preceded by ex
perience as an Economist with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
New York City, and as U.S. Customs Officer at San Francisco.

field when Dr. Robert L. Gulick, Jr., Dean of Admissions for the American Insti
tute for Foreign Trade (Thunderbird), Phoenix, Arizona, comes to this campus
on October 28th, 1 964.
The recent affiliation of the Institute with the American Management Associa
tion, a leading private enterprise group having a membership of over 32,000
progressive business firms, is of major importance. The AMA [ias a special divi
sion devoted to international commerce and is quite possibly the most influen
tial body in this country representing American interests abroad. This very direct
connection with unquestioned leaders of U.S. industry—the members of AMA—
is sure to lead to even greater opportunities for graduates of the Institute and
will certainly result in more concerns providing a greater variety of posts for
graduates.
There is today an increasing demand for you men and women qualifed to rep
resent America's expanding interests abroad. Companies want college grad
uates with such backgrounds as Agricultural Economics, Engineering, Accounting,
Social Anthropology, Marketing, Food Technology, Psychology and Foreign Trade.
Two highly successful Thunderbirds had undergraduate majors in Music. Among
the more than 1,500 employers of AIFT alumni are First National City Bank,
Monsanto Union Carbide, Chase Manhattan Bank, Hilton Hotels, Goodyear,
Sterling Products International, the U.S. Government, and private and religious
welfare groups, with activities in over eighty countries.
The Institute's curriculum emphasizes three main fields—languages most wanted
by companies (Spanish, Portuguese, French), area studies, and world trade and
banking. Language classes, taught by native teachers using the most advanced
methods, are limited to eight students. International business courses, presented
by scholars with a minimum experience of ten years as executives in foreign
lands are tailored to meet the needs of students in classes of seminar size. The
training is rigorous, with three to five hours a day on language study and the
balance of a very full schedule divided between the area studies and the tech
nical side of foreign trade.
The placement record is an astonishing one. Of students available for employ
ment in 1 964, 95 % of the January class and 86 % of the May class were placed
before graduation. The salaries received by alumni, together with special allow
ances for foreign sevice, run noticeably higher than the average given to per
sonnel having a year of graduate training (similar in length of time to the In
stitute's Bachelor of Foreign Trade degree); the difference tends to widen over
a five-year period.
If interested in the international economic field, students are invited to make an
appointment through the placement office for an interview with Dean Gulick,
who returned to American this year after spending more than a decade in
Libya, North Africa. Dean Gulick's career has included several years as Lecturer
in the Institute of Economics, University of California, Berkeley, preceded by ex
perience as an Economist with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,
New York City, and as U.S. Customs Officer at San Francisco.

Students interested in foreign trade and world business will have an unusual
opportunity to discuss current developments and prospects in the international
field when Dr. Robert L. Gulick, Jr., Dean of Admissions for the American Insti
tute for Foreign Trade (Thunderbird), Phoenix, Arizona, comes to this campus
