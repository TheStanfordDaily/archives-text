# Sex Without Sorrow
## 
### 
More and more today sex is hoi up billed as "the thing to do" and even among
collegians there is often little concern about the right and wrong of free sexual ex
pression. Soim who look at marriage as the ultimate place for sex openly'advocate
premarital "experience" as if one were in training for marriage. Quite a few think
that the sexual drive is in the same class as physical hunger, justifying their im
morality by saying that repression breeds neurosis. The wrong kind of sex not only
never satisfies but does lead to emotional problems, guilt, and anxiety from which
some people never recover. Perhaps you are among those who are discovering these
"facts of life" by experience. As much as one would like to believe otherwise at
times, the "right and "wrong" of sex are established law* of our being which, when
violated, inevitably have unhappy consequences.
Our Creator has given man strong drives for procreation, and a great potential
for love. The Christian view of sex is not one of repression and puritanical self
denial, but one which calls attention to the one proper channel of sexual expression
which God has provided. Within the bounds of holy matrimony sex is beautiful and
sacred, complementing other aspects of the relationship to produce deep ties of love.
God alone provides the self-control we need in single life, and God alone can bring
true sexual freedom and fulfillment within marriage. Only when God is in control,
however, are the energies and drives of a fallen nature channeled into their proper
use.
Our Lord Jesus Christ amplifies God's view of sex by pointing to the motive of
the heart as well as the overt act. for morality is deeper than deeds and stronger than
the surface behavior. In fact, said Jesus, You have heard that it was said, 'you
shall not commit adultery,' but 1 say to you that everyone who looks at a woman
lustfully has already committed adultery with her in her heart. (Matthew 5:27-28
The key to self-control in matters of sex, and to true morality in marriage or
outside of marriage is a personal relationship to Jesus Christ who alone can change
that depraved human heart which is bent 011 sinning.
"If any man be in Christ he is a new creation, old things have passed away, be
hold all things are become new." (2 Corinthinians 5:17)
Becoming a Christian involves a total transformation of a human being and a
new set of ideals and goals. This is why the Apostle Paul speaking in the strength of
God's Spirit admonishes Christians not to continue in their former ways which are
inconsistent with their relationship to Jesus Christ.
"Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kindom of God? Do
not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals,
nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers. nor robbers, will inherit the
kingdom of God. And stall wrc xoihc of yon, but you were washed, you were sanctified,
you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our
God." (I Corinthinians 6:9-l 1)
Perhaps you have not yet experienced the indwelling, delivering, saving power
of Jesus Christ in your life. Perhaps you do not know the cleansing and renewing
which only He can bring. Jesus Christ does not propose leading you down a narrow
road of self-negation, but down a path of fulfillment and happiness. He wants yon
to reach your fullest potential as a man or .woman, sex included, that you may know
life to its fullest and deepest. Let Jesus Christ lead you today.
