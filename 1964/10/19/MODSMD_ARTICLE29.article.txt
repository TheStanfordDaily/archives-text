## CARDS REPOSE IN PAC CELLAR Huskies Shut Out Indians, 6-0 
### PETE KING 
Stifled by its sputtering, incon
sistent offense and Washington's
consistently unyielding defense,
Stanford's football team went
down, 6-0, to the Huskies Satur
day in Stanford Stadium.
It was the first time in 20
games that the Indians had been
shut out. The last time, ironically,
it was done by Washington here
in 1962. Stanford has now lost
six straight to the Huskies.
THE LOSS dropped Stanford's
season record to 2-3, put them
convincingly in the Pacific Eight
conference collar at 0-3, and
showed that the Tribe will have
to scramble to win any of its re
maining five games.
The Cards had their scoring
chances early in the game, blew
them, then .spent the rest of the
afternoon staving off Husky
thrusts for touchdowns. The first

time Stanford got the ball, it
ripped off 65 yards in six plays
to lho Husky 24-yard line. An 18-
yard run by halfback Ray Hand
ley and two 17-yard passes from
Terry DeSylvia to Dave Lewis
highlighted ihe drive.
Then the Tribe ran into the
quicksand that always seems to
start around an opponent's 20-
yard line. Three plays fizzled and
Braden Rock missed a 31-yard
field goal.
THEN CAME Washington full
back Junior Coffey's omy uad
play of the game. He fumbled,
and Indian Tom Ross pounced
on it. In two plays Stanford was
at the 13, but an errant DeSylvia
pass was intercepted by u k
Redman, and the Cards ban ut> u
their last look at Washington
territory.
As has been the case in Stan
ford-Washington games, the In
dians made one mistake that cost

them dearly. Little 150-pound
Steve Rramweil snagged a punt
on the Husky 47 and darted
through 10 Stanford defenders.
However, punter Ragsdale had
i hung back for just such a possibil
ity, and gently nudged Brarmvell
! out of bounds on the 23.
BUT THE Huskies had momen
tum. Quarterback Jim Cart oris
hit end A 1 Lobke at the five-yard
line with one of his two comple
tions of the game. Coffey then
punched over for the score, with
just three minutes left in the
half.

Tribe, with 67 yards in 14 car
ries, but the Husky line closed
the holes and the linebackers
eliminated Hand ley's interference.
Handley now has 530 yards rush
ing, and may still lead the coun
try, since his closest competitors
had bad flays.
THREE FUMBLES lost in the
second half kept Stanford's off
ense well bottled up. Washington
couldn't capitalize, however, bolh
1 because Jack Chappie, Bob Ni
chols, and Gary Pettigrew kept
i dumping Washington backs for
losses, and because Husky Ron
i Medvcd missed three short field
i goal attempts. Two others were
hloeked bv Stanford.

As it became apparent that the
Indians weren't going to gain
much through the line, Washing
ton coach Jim Owens had Steve
Hinds and Jim Lambright shoot
ing through to nail Stanford quar
terbacks DeSylvia and Dick Berg
for huge losses. All told, the
Huskies blunted Stanford's aerial
attack for only four completions
in 16 tosses, none completed in
the second half.
If anything was encouraging
after such a frustrating game, it
was the Stanford defense, which
stopped Washington three times
inside the 20-yard line and forced
six punts and five field goal at
tempts.
KAfisnALK was outstanding in
defensive backfield. Besides pre
venting a Bramwell touchdown,
he stifled another TI) when ho
crashed into Husky A 1 Libke on
the goal line, knocking away a
pass which Libke had just caught.
Another bright spot was the
punting of Dave Lewis. Although
his first effort when a mere 17
yards, Lewis boomed two more
line drive kicks for 59 and 56
yards. His 44-yard average was
barely ahead of Redman, whose
soaring boots put Stanford in the
hole constantly.
Stanford received a crushing
lesson in ball control. Washing
ton had SI offensive plays, while
Ihe Indians could manage only
49.

was the Stanford defense, which
stopped Washington three times
inside the 20-yard line and forced
six punts and five field goal at
tempts.
KAfisnALK was outstanding in
defensive backfield. Besides pre
venting a Bramwell touchdown,
he stifled another TI) when ho
crashed into Husky A 1 Libke on
the goal line, knocking away a
pass which Libke had just caught.
Another bright spot was the
punting of Dave Lewis. Although
his first effort when a mere 17
yards, Lewis boomed two more
line drive kicks for 59 and 56
yards. His 44-yard average was
barely ahead of Redman, whose
soaring boots put Stanford in the
hole constantly.
Stanford received a crushing
lesson in ball control. Washing
ton had SI offensive plays, while
Ihe Indians could manage only
49.
Stifled by its sputtering, incon
sistent offense and Washington's
consistently unyielding defense,
Stanford's football team went
down, 6-0, to the Huskies Satur
day in Stanford Stadium.
It was the first time in 20
games that the Indians had been
shut out. The last time, ironically,
it was done by Washington here
in 1962. Stanford has now lost
six straight to the Huskies.
THE LOSS dropped Stanford's
season record to 2-3, put them
convincingly in the Pacific Eight
conference collar at 0-3, and
showed that the Tribe will have
to scramble to win any of its re
maining five games.
The Cards had their scoring
chances early in the game, blew
them, then .spent the rest of the
afternoon staving off Husky
thrusts for touchdowns. The first

time Stanford got the ball, it
ripped off 65 yards in six plays
to lho Husky 24-yard line. An 18-
yard run by halfback Ray Hand
ley and two 17-yard passes from
Terry DeSylvia to Dave Lewis
highlighted ihe drive.
Then the Tribe ran into the
quicksand that always seems to
start around an opponent's 20-
yard line. Three plays fizzled and
Braden Rock missed a 31-yard
field goal.
THEN CAME Washington full
back Junior Coffey's omy uad
play of the game. He fumbled,
and Indian Tom Ross pounced
on it. In two plays Stanford was
at the 13, but an errant DeSylvia
pass was intercepted by u k
Redman, and the Cards ban ut> u
their last look at Washington
territory.
As has been the case in Stan
ford-Washington games, the In
dians made one mistake that cost

them dearly. Little 150-pound
Steve Rramweil snagged a punt
on the Husky 47 and darted
through 10 Stanford defenders.
However, punter Ragsdale had
i hung back for just such a possibil
ity, and gently nudged Brarmvell
! out of bounds on the 23.
BUT THE Huskies had momen
tum. Quarterback Jim Cart oris
hit end A 1 Lobke at the five-yard
line with one of his two comple
tions of the game. Coffey then
punched over for the score, with
just three minutes left in the
half.

Handley now has 530 yards rush
ing, and may still lead the coun
try, since his closest competitors
had bad flays.
THREE FUMBLES lost in the
second half kept Stanford's off
ense well bottled up. Washington
couldn't capitalize, however, bolh

losses, and because Husky Ron

As it became apparent that the
Indians weren't going to gain
much through the line, Washing
ton coach Jim Owens had Steve
Hinds and Jim Lambright shoot
ing through to nail Stanford quar
terbacks DeSylvia and Dick Berg
for huge losses. All told, the
Huskies blunted Stanford's aerial

second half kept Stanford's off
ense well bottled up. Washington
couldn't capitalize, however, bolh
1 because Jack Chappie, Bob Ni
chols, and Gary Pettigrew kept
i dumping Washington backs for
losses, and because Husky Ron
i Medvcd missed three short field
i goal attempts. Two others were
hloeked bv Stanford.

As it became apparent that the
Indians weren't going to gain
much through the line, Washing
ton coach Jim Owens had Steve
Hinds and Jim Lambright shoot
ing through to nail Stanford quar
terbacks DeSylvia and Dick Berg
for huge losses. All told, the
Huskies blunted Stanford's aerial
attack for only four completions
in 16 tosses, none completed in
the second half.
If anything was encouraging
after such a frustrating game, it
was the Stanford defense, which
stopped Washington three times
inside the 20-yard line and forced
six punts and five field goal at
tempts.
KAfisnALK was outstanding in
defensive backfield. Besides pre
venting a Bramwell touchdown,
he stifled another TI) when ho
crashed into Husky A 1 Libke on
the goal line, knocking away a
pass which Libke had just caught.
Another bright spot was the
punting of Dave Lewis. Although
his first effort when a mere 17
yards, Lewis boomed two more
line drive kicks for 59 and 56
yards. His 44-yard average was
barely ahead of Redman, whose
soaring boots put Stanford in the
hole constantly.
Stanford received a crushing
lesson in ball control. Washing
ton had SI offensive plays, while
Ihe Indians could manage only
49.
Stifled by its sputtering, incon
sistent offense and Washington's
consistently unyielding defense,
Stanford's football team went
down, 6-0, to the Huskies Satur
day in Stanford Stadium.
It was the first time in 20
games that the Indians had been
shut out. The last time, ironically,
it was done by Washington here
in 1962. Stanford has now lost
six straight to the Huskies.
THE LOSS dropped Stanford's
season record to 2-3, put them
convincingly in the Pacific Eight
conference collar at 0-3, and
showed that the Tribe will have
to scramble to win any of its re
maining five games.
The Cards had their scoring
chances early in the game, blew
them, then .spent the rest of the
afternoon staving off Husky
thrusts for touchdowns. The first

time Stanford got the ball, it
ripped off 65 yards in six plays
to lho Husky 24-yard line. An 18-
yard run by halfback Ray Hand
ley and two 17-yard passes from
Terry DeSylvia to Dave Lewis
highlighted ihe drive.
Then the Tribe ran into the
quicksand that always seems to
start around an opponent's 20-
yard line. Three plays fizzled and
Braden Rock missed a 31-yard
field goal.
THEN CAME Washington full
back Junior Coffey's omy uad
play of the game. He fumbled,
and Indian Tom Ross pounced
on it. In two plays Stanford was
at the 13, but an errant DeSylvia
pass was intercepted by u k
Redman, and the Cards ban ut> u
their last look at Washington
territory.
As has been the case in Stan
ford-Washington games, the In
dians made one mistake that cost

them dearly. Little 150-pound
Steve Rramweil snagged a punt
on the Husky 47 and darted
through 10 Stanford defenders.
However, punter Ragsdale had
i hung back for just such a possibil
ity, and gently nudged Brarmvell
! out of bounds on the 23.
BUT THE Huskies had momen
tum. Quarterback Jim Cart oris
hit end A 1 Lobke at the five-yard
line with one of his two comple
tions of the game. Coffey then
punched over for the score, with
just three minutes left in the
half.
Coffey made believers out of
the 33,500 onlookers as ho gained
|117 yards in 27 carries—l 6 yards
— itie whole Stanford
1 team, naruut-j — - *
Tribe, with 67 yards in 14 car
ries, but the Husky line closed
the holes and the linebackers
eliminated Hand ley's interference.
Handley now has 530 yards rush
ing, and may still lead the coun
try, since his closest competitors
had bad flays.
