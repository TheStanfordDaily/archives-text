# Stanford's Winning Streak Snapped At One-As Usual
## 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
The jinx that has kept the Stan
ford Indians from winning two
games in succession since John
Ralston took over last year pre
vailed again S a t u r d a y. ''The
thing that bothered us, particu
larly on offense." Ralston ex
plained after the same, "was be

ing so spotty and erratic. Our con
sistency broke down just too
many times."
RALSTON praised Ihe work of
tlie defense, especially two mem
bers of the forward wall, Tom
Ross and Bob Nichols. Ross
missed getting lineman of the
game honors by just two votes 1o
Washington's All American line
backer Rick Redman. "The de
fensive unit takes a lot of pride
in shutting the door."
Stanford's offense, which has
been hold to one TD once this
year but which scored 20 points
or more in the other three out
ings, except for an impressive
i initial drive never found itself.
Ralston pinpointed the trouble.
"We lost two scoring opportuni
ties in the first half, and bad field
position hindered us from open-
I ing our attack in the second half."
Because of Washington's porous
passing defense in previous out
tings, many thought Stanford
j would go to the air with zeal.
1 Passing was in Stanford's stra
! tegy, but according to Ralston,
i"The breakdown of our pass pro-
I tection resulted in some 1 a rg e
I losses, and be became wary. Also,
I I hr e e sideline passes we r c
| dropped."
ASKED WHETHER the Wash
| ington defense was keying on
• Ray Handley, who netted only a
mediocre total of 67 yards, Ral
ston remarked that it was not
necessarily keying on anything
but was balenced for both run
ning and passing.
