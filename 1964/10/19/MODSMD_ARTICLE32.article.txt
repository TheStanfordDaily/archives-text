# The 						Jenkins Case
## 
### 
President Johnson spoke to the nation last
night about the new developments in the inter
national situation — the Khrushchev ouster and
the Chinese nuclear explosion, in particular.
lint he failed to comment on a lesser but
nevertheless important issue of the campaign,
the issue raised by the unfortunate case of Wal
ter \\. Jenkins.
The arrest last week of this top Presidential
adviser and confidant exposed a shocking negli
gence on the part of the President and the Secret
Service, a negligence in taking minimal precau
tions against the threat of security risks in sensi
tive positions.
Waller Jenkins has not been subject to a
security cheek since 1958. And yet, since 1959,
when he was first arrested on a morals charge,
|enkins lias been vulnerable to the most vicious
kind of blackmail.
As a 'casual participant in meetings of the
National Security Council and as a frequent
handler of top secret information, he could have
done inestimable damage to the security of the

United States, simply to protect himself from
exposure.
The fact that Jenkins was not cheeked more
recently than 1958 raises several important ques
tions:
• Did President Johnson, a close personal
friend of Jenkins for over 25 years, know about
the 1959 arrest, or, more importantly, about the
deviant behaviour which caused it?
• Why, iu any case, did Johnson fail to order
a security check on all members of the new
White 1 louse staff?
• Are there others who have also been al
lowed to escape minimal security precautions?
A Congressional investigation of security pro
cedures for all levels of civil servants should be
undertaken immediately, and the entire \\ hite
House staff should be screened.
The Jenkins case has revealed a kind of reck
lessness and laxity in matters of gravest national
concern which cannot safeb be tolerated in a
President of the United States.
