# Is U.S. In Wrong Space Race? Satellite Bombs Pose Danger
## 
### RICHARD A. WEINIG 
As Russia's space bus spun around the earth,
it confirmed the long-held conviction of many
American military strategists that the United
States has committed itself to the wrong space
race.
Rocketry capable of orbiting such weight may
vale a military threat which the United States is
unprepared to face.
For the past four years, the Kennedy and John
son administrations have repeatedly forsworn
exploration of the military capabilities of space.
Attention has been directed, instead, to purely
peaceful inquiries such as the effort to land a man
on the moon. While such an endeavor may dis
prove the green cheese theory of lunar construc
tion, it courts national suicide as well.
Unfortunately, Soviet plans for the exploita
tion of space may be anything but benign.
N'ikita Sergeivich is gone. But while the Soviet
military undoubtedly played a significant role in
his deposition, its publications look with favor
upon Khrushchev's principal concepts of global
conflict.
Khrushchev Policy
Perhaps the most comprehensive summary of
them is Khrushchev's speech to the highest plan
ning bodies of the Soviet Communist Party on
January 6. 1961. I)r. Stefan T. Possony of the
Hoover Institution has hailed the speech as "Khru
shchev's Mein Kainpf." The late President Ken
nedy accorded it similar importance.
While the speech was phrased in customary
"Aesopian language," its core might be summar
ized as follows:
World conquest remains the motivating force
behind Soviet foreign policy. The principal im
pediment to its achievement is American nuclear
might. If the Soviet Union can effect "the prohibi
tion and destruction of atomic weapons and other
weapons of mass destruction" possessed by the
West, victory will be assured.
Therefore, a course of peaceful coexistence
must be pursued "against imperialism < the West'
for restricting its military capabilities" without
similarly impairing those of the Soviet Union.
Under this cover, every effort must be made to
outstrip the Free World militarily and technologi
cally.
I-Acntiial I Itiiiiafmil
If the strategy is successful, Russia, in five to
ten years, will be strong enough to coerce the Free
World into surrender ("war is not fatally inevi
table"); or. failing to do this, fight and win a nu
lear war with minimal loss to the Soviet Union.
These precepts are treated favorably in Soko
lovsky's Military Strategy, the Soviet Union's most
authoritative military text. Khrushchev's succes
sors, furthermore, have indicated that his policies
will be continued.
The means by which the final ultimatum of
surrender or annihilation might he effected is sug
gested by Marshal Biriuzov, Chief of the Soviet
Strategic Missile Forces: "It has become possible,
at a command from the earth, to launch rockets
from a satellite, and this at any desirable time, at
any point in the satellite trajectory." (Foreign
Broadcast Information Service, USSR and Fasl -
ern Europe. February 25, 1963, p. CC-24.1
< <>ntineiital Incineration
According to Robert McNamara, a 100 megaton
warhead detonated at an altitude of 20 miles
would cause fire storms over entire states. Other
sources estimate that such weapons detonated 100
miles from the earth could incinerate most of the
North American continent. (Frank Kluckhohn.
Lyndon's l.egacy, p. 223.Â»
It is believed in some quarters that a rocket
with sufficient power to launch the recent space
bus would be adequate to launch a satellite carry
ing such a warhead.
More terrifying still is Ihe possibility that such
weapons could prevent any nuclear retaliation by
tlie United States.
Warning time of an attack loosed from such
close range as an overhead satellite is negligible.
Radar detection of the missiles' nearly vertical tra
jectories would be difficult. Anti-ballistic defenses
would lie rendered helpless even if we possessed
them, which we do not.

Properly hardened launching pads may protect
missiles from the heat and physical percussion
of all but a direct hit. However, many scientists
believe that high megatonage warheads emit an
"electromagnetic pulse" which could deactivate
missiles on the launching pad.
Firestorm lit'feets
This fear was expressed by General Thomas
S. Power in testimony before the Senate Prepared
ness Subcommittee in August, 1963. The electro
magnetic pulse, undoubtedly discovered in the
1961-62 high-yield Russian tests, is believed to
have an effect similar to that of lightning strik
ing a radio. The pulse may be capable of burning
out circuits, fusing wiring, erasing missile guid
ance systems, and even rendering missiles incap
able of being fired. And all 1 his from a long dis
tance.
For a detailed description of the electromag
netic pulse, the reader is referred to the highly
respected technological .journal Missiles and
Rockets. (September 16, 1963. pp. 1-4-15.)
Missiles on Polaris submarines are relatively
safe from the effects of the electromagnetic pulse.
However, prospects that they, too, could be pre
vented from retaliating are heightened by the
degree of personal control which President John
son appears to be placing upon use of all nuclear
weapons.
Presidential Control Risky
Under Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy,
such persons as the chief of the Strategic Air
Command and the NATO Supreme Commander
were given "contingency orders" to use nuclear
weapons in an emergency without consulting the
White House. (Confer: U.S. News and World lie
port. October, 5, 19G4, pp. 23, 47-49.'
Under President Johnson, this policy appears to
be undergoing alteration.
Robert McNamara told the Democratic Plat
form Committee in August that every effort was
being made to "bring nuclear weapons under the
actual, as well as theoretical, control of the Presi
dent."
Affirming this. President Johnson told an au
dience in Seattle on September 16 that: "The re
lease of nuclear weapons would come by presi
dential decision alone. Complex codes and elec
tronic devices prevent any unauthorized action
. . . we have placed permissive action locks on sev
eral of our weapons. These are electromagnetic
locks which must be opened by secret combina
tion before action at all is possible and we are
extending this system." (U.S. News and World
Report. October 19, 1964, p. IS.)
Retaliation Prevented
The electromagnetic code to open these locks
is possessed only by the President. In time of
emergency, it is to be issued by him and him
alone. When this control system is extended to
all weapons, several contingencies could prevent
any retaliation in case of Soviet attack.
(a) The President may not have the code with
in reach at all times. During a recent campaign
trip to Detroit, lack of space on President John
son's plane caused his assistant carrying the elec
tronic keys to ride in a different plane altogether.
(hi High megatonage warheads may destroy
the command center containing the President and
his coded key. Robert McNamara testified during
nuclear test ban hearings before the Senate For
eign Relations Committee thai a 100 megaton
warhead could destroy command centers situated
as far as 3,000 feet beneath solid rock. (Hearings,
p. 126.) Presidential authorization cannot be given
from a crater.
(e) If the President survived a surprise at
tack personally, his means of communication
particularly to Polaris submarines could well
be destroyed. The Soviet .18 megaton test in Siberia
in 1961 knocked out all radio and telephonic com
munication iti the central Pacific for a period of
time. In addition, it destroyed an American obser
vation satellite. Extant communication satellites
would undoubtedly by subject to the same fate.
America stands defenseless in the area between
100 and 500 miles in space. Yet the interim Presi
dent and his predecessor have steadfastly refused
to explore its military capabilities
