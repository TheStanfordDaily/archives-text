## Legislature May Improve, But What Can It Really Do? 
### Justin Beck 
Deep thought is a rarity in student government, a place where
seriousness is round in trickles, and where philosophy belongs to
someone else.
Most of the thinking tiiis year has centered around LASSU, a
body which prefers to think of itself, when it thinks at all.

While it's too early to tell if<
Legislative neurons and synapses

are functioning
pr op e r 1 y, the
first meeting of
the year gave an
indication of a
short circ u i t
somewhere in
student govern
ment's collective
m i nd. Perhaps
the aberation
wlii eh afflicts

LASSU, its skill at discerning and
then concentrating with vigor on
the unimportant, will depart with
time. Anyway they're thinking
about it, which indicates that
either the problem is trivial or the
legislature is getiing better.
W lint fan I,ASSU Do?
The question facing a
hypothetic imj roved student gov
ernment i> I suspect, like that of
a successful mountain climber:
"Now that we're here, what do
we do?"
The last few ASSU Presidents
have done some thinking about
the role of student government,
perhaps lo justify the time
spent getting elected. But what
ever the motive, it's the thought
that counts.
Basically the feeling has been
that student government has a
place in something called th e
"Stanford community." Former
President Bud Wedin, who spent
as much time 1 thinking up prin
ciples as lie did lighting in the
defense or those he had already
accumulated, had the clearest
view of where tie was headed in
that Community. The only prob
lem was that he didn't get there.
VVedin's Failure
Some have charged that Wedin
failed because lie was impractical.
In politics, it seems, a little
principle has never hurt anyone,
but an overdose is too often fatal.
But Wedin never really had a
chance to test his theories for
there was a genuine hostility
from another part of his "Stan
ford community" that to a large
degree prevented successful stu
dent action by his government.
The biggest problem that We
din had in trying to find a niche
for student government in the
Stanford community, is that the
community is already equipped
with a group of decision-makers
who, like true professionals, inis
trust the work of amateurs.
They are perfectly happy to lei
student government fill in th e
holes where they have missed a
decision or two, and hint that stu
dent advise is Administrative cat
nip as far as they're concerned.
But while advice is nice, student

interference isn't, and Wedin
seemingly never did learn th e
difference between the two.
"Spirit of ( amp David"
ASSU President Scott Mcßride
is currently basking in a sort of
"spirit of Camp David" with the
Administration, but could mess
up the whole works. He maintains
that student government should
serve as a critic of the University
community.
But he may find that the more
critical he becomes, the less the
Administration will consider him
a part of their community. In
other words the louder he may
yell, the less he will be heard. But
Mcßride isn't saying much now
and the reception is fine.
The hope of the current Legis
lature is that becoming more ef
fective, it can better represent the
student body in the University
community. Last year when the
Legislature spoke, it was quite
easily disregarded, for its base of
support was nearly as small as
the effort the membership put
into its work. Not only was what
LASSU said often unpleasant, but
it was felt that the Legislature,
especially when it said something
that was disagreeable, didn't
really represent the sponsor's
views.
Advisory Board Problem
The problem of Presidential
advisory committees illustrates
that problem of student govern
ment. Wedin presented a list of
representative students to the
President's Office for considera
tion. but instead, the President
picked different students whom
he apparently felt were more
representative than the Wedin
recommendations. 11 was a
strange situation indeed when the
President of the University quar
rels with the student body presi
dent over who can pick more rep
resentative students.
An effective LASSU could
change all that by providing au
thentic representation of the stu
dent body, and, as a bonus, re
duce the fluctuation of student
policy from year to year.
But exactly what an improved
Legislature's role in the commu
nity would be has not yet been
fully considered. Whether it's to
fill in the holes left by the Ad
ministration in governing th
University, or to represent the
students in the actual decision
making or to he a constructive
critic of the community or merely
to keep those who are too young
to drink busy in other construc
tive pursuits nobody has yet de
cided; least of all the students.

for student government in the
Stanford community, is that the
community is already equipped
with a group of decision-makers
who, like true professionals, inis
trust the work of amateurs.
They are perfectly happy to lei
student government fill in th e
holes where they have missed a
decision or two, and hint that stu
dent advise is Administrative cat
nip as far as they're concerned.
But while advice is nice, student

interference isn't, and Wedin
seemingly never did learn th e
difference between the two.
"Spirit of ( amp David"
ASSU President Scott Mcßride
is currently basking in a sort of
"spirit of Camp David" with the
Administration, but could mess
up the whole works. He maintains
that student government should
serve as a critic of the University
community.
But he may find that the more
critical he becomes, the less the
Administration will consider him
a part of their community. In
other words the louder he may
yell, the less he will be heard. But
Mcßride isn't saying much now
and the reception is fine.
The hope of the current Legis
lature is that becoming more ef
fective, it can better represent the
student body in the University
community. Last year when the
Legislature spoke, it was quite
easily disregarded, for its base of
support was nearly as small as
the effort the membership put
into its work. Not only was what
LASSU said often unpleasant, but
it was felt that the Legislature,
especially when it said something
that was disagreeable, didn't
really represent the sponsor's
views.
Advisory Board Problem
The problem of Presidential
advisory committees illustrates
that problem of student govern
ment. Wedin presented a list of
representative students to the
President's Office for considera
tion. but instead, the President
picked different students whom
he apparently felt were more
representative than the Wedin
recommendations. 11 was a
strange situation indeed when the
President of the University quar
rels with the student body presi
dent over who can pick more rep
resentative students.
An effective LASSU could
change all that by providing au
thentic representation of the stu
dent body, and, as a bonus, re
duce the fluctuation of student
policy from year to year.
But exactly what an improved
Legislature's role in the commu
nity would be has not yet been
fully considered. Whether it's to
fill in the holes left by the Ad
ministration in governing th
University, or to represent the
students in the actual decision
making or to he a constructive
critic of the community or merely
to keep those who are too young
to drink busy in other construc
tive pursuits nobody has yet de
cided; least of all the students.


BECK
Deep thought is a rarity in student government, a place where
seriousness is round in trickles, and where philosophy belongs to
someone else.
Most of the thinking tiiis year has centered around LASSU, a
body which prefers to think of itself, when it thinks at all.

While it's too early to tell if<
Legislative neurons and synapses

are functioning
pr op e r 1 y, the
first meeting of
the year gave an
indication of a
short circ u i t
somewhere in
student govern
ment's collective
m i nd. Perhaps
the aberation
wlii eh afflicts

LASSU, its skill at discerning and
then concentrating with vigor on
the unimportant, will depart with
time. Anyway they're thinking
about it, which indicates that
either the problem is trivial or the
legislature is getiing better.
W lint fan I,ASSU Do?
The question facing a
hypothetic imj roved student gov
ernment i> I suspect, like that of
a successful mountain climber:
"Now that we're here, what do
we do?"
The last few ASSU Presidents
have done some thinking about
the role of student government,
perhaps lo justify the time
spent getting elected. But what
ever the motive, it's the thought
that counts.
Basically the feeling has been
that student government has a
place in something called th e
"Stanford community." Former
President Bud Wedin, who spent
as much time 1 thinking up prin
ciples as lie did lighting in the
defense or those he had already
accumulated, had the clearest
view of where tie was headed in
that Community. The only prob
lem was that he didn't get there.
VVedin's Failure
Some have charged that Wedin
failed because lie was impractical.
In politics, it seems, a little
principle has never hurt anyone,
but an overdose is too often fatal.
But Wedin never really had a
chance to test his theories for
there was a genuine hostility
from another part of his "Stan
ford community" that to a large
degree prevented successful stu
dent action by his government.

BECK
Deep thought is a rarity in student government, a place where
seriousness is round in trickles, and where philosophy belongs to
someone else.
Most of the thinking tiiis year has centered around LASSU, a
body which prefers to think of itself, when it thinks at all.

While it's too early to tell if<
Legislative neurons and synapses

are functioning
pr op e r 1 y, the
first meeting of
the year gave an
indication of a
short circ u i t
somewhere in
student govern
ment's collective
m i nd. Perhaps
the aberation
wlii eh afflicts

LASSU, its skill at discerning and
then concentrating with vigor on
the unimportant, will depart with
time. Anyway they're thinking
about it, which indicates that
either the problem is trivial or the
legislature is getiing better.
W lint fan I,ASSU Do?
The question facing a
hypothetic imj roved student gov
ernment i> I suspect, like that of
a successful mountain climber:
"Now that we're here, what do
we do?"
The last few ASSU Presidents
have done some thinking about
the role of student government,
perhaps lo justify the time
spent getting elected. But what
ever the motive, it's the thought
that counts.
Basically the feeling has been
that student government has a
place in something called th e
"Stanford community." Former
President Bud Wedin, who spent
as much time 1 thinking up prin
ciples as lie did lighting in the
defense or those he had already
accumulated, had the clearest
view of where tie was headed in
that Community. The only prob
lem was that he didn't get there.
VVedin's Failure
Some have charged that Wedin
failed because lie was impractical.
In politics, it seems, a little
principle has never hurt anyone,
but an overdose is too often fatal.
But Wedin never really had a
chance to test his theories for
there was a genuine hostility
from another part of his "Stan
ford community" that to a large
degree prevented successful stu
dent action by his government.
The biggest problem that We
din had in trying to find a niche
for student government in the
Stanford community, is that the
community is already equipped
with a group of decision-makers
who, like true professionals, inis
trust the work of amateurs.
They are perfectly happy to lei
student government fill in th e
holes where they have missed a
decision or two, and hint that stu
dent advise is Administrative cat
nip as far as they're concerned.
But while advice is nice, student

interference isn't, and Wedin
seemingly never did learn th e
difference between the two.
"Spirit of ( amp David"
ASSU President Scott Mcßride
is currently basking in a sort of
"spirit of Camp David" with the
Administration, but could mess
up the whole works. He maintains
that student government should
serve as a critic of the University
community.
But he may find that the more
critical he becomes, the less the
Administration will consider him
a part of their community. In
other words the louder he may
yell, the less he will be heard. But
Mcßride isn't saying much now
and the reception is fine.
The hope of the current Legis
lature is that becoming more ef
fective, it can better represent the
student body in the University
community. Last year when the
Legislature spoke, it was quite
easily disregarded, for its base of
support was nearly as small as
the effort the membership put
into its work. Not only was what
LASSU said often unpleasant, but
it was felt that the Legislature,
especially when it said something
that was disagreeable, didn't
really represent the sponsor's
views.
Advisory Board Problem
The problem of Presidential
advisory committees illustrates
that problem of student govern
ment. Wedin presented a list of
representative students to the
President's Office for considera
tion. but instead, the President
picked different students whom
he apparently felt were more
representative than the Wedin
recommendations. 11 was a
strange situation indeed when the
President of the University quar
rels with the student body presi
dent over who can pick more rep
resentative students.
An effective LASSU could
change all that by providing au
thentic representation of the stu
dent body, and, as a bonus, re
duce the fluctuation of student
policy from year to year.
But exactly what an improved
Legislature's role in the commu
nity would be has not yet been
fully considered. Whether it's to
fill in the holes left by the Ad
