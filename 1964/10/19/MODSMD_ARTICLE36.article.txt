## McNamara Policy Lauded; Taipei Student Life Praised 
### 
Dear Sir:
Mr. Bonine's article on foreign
policy issues in the presidential
campaign was timely and valu
able. He rightly points out that
some of Mr. Goldwater's positions
have been widely misunderstood.
I fear, however, that Mr. Bonine
has failed to take the effort to
understand how American mili
tary policy has evolved in the
last three and one half years. This
has led him to an almost incred
ibly naive interpretation of Mr.
McNamara's defense policy mak
ing. . . .
While "progressively weaken
ing our military defenses," Mc-
Namara has increased the de
fense budget about 15 per cent
over fiscal year 19151. increased
by 45 per cent the number of
combat ready army divisions, in
creased by 800 per cent our coun
ter-insurgency forces, increased
by 40 per cent the funds spent
on military research and develop
ment, greatly increased the mega
tonnage in oiu- strategic alert
forces, and greatly increased our
airlift and tactical air power. In
1959 most of SAC was based on
about 40 airfields highly vulner
able to Soviet attack. Because of
SAC's fantastic strike-first cap
ability and high vulnerability,
what deterrence ii provides must
have been negative. Today our
strategic forces are dispersed,
hardened, and mobile capable
of riding out the worst surprise
attack the USSR could mount.
A rapid perusal of Mr. McNa
mara's speeches would quickly
dispel Mr. Bonine of the idea that
McNamara pretends "the cold
war has ended." He is well aware
of the Communist desire to rule
the world and is a careful student
of the military and economic poli
cies which support that effort.
The exact meaning of Mr. Bo
nine's metaphor "Maginot Line
concept of missile defense" is not
clear. Presumably he means we
should place more reliance on
Ihe manned bomber. Typical argu
ments for (he bomber are that
it can be launched and recalled,
it is reliable, it can deliver a
heavier payload more accurately,
and it can employ human judg
ment in selective target destruc
tion. But it's not that it can be
launched on ambiguous warn
ing it's that it has to be launched
because it cannot ride out a sur
prise attack. The electronic sys
tems on the proposed RS-70 are
so complicated that it would, be
yond any doubt, be far less re
liable than current missiles. Mr.
McNamara "vividly remembers"
calling a surprise alert and hav
ing an entire squadron of B-58's
abort for one reason or another.
Current bombers can, using free
fall bombs, deliver an enormous
payload quite accurately. That's
why we now have over 1,000 of
them. But in 1970 bombers will
be unable to get near enough to
a target to drop a bomb they
must use air to surface missiles
i such as Skybolt). . . .
I have discussed most of Mr.
Bonine's specific criticisms of our
defense posture. But 1 suspect
that when Mr. Bonine charged
McNamara with "economizing,"
lie betrays a more fundamental
misunderstanding of the McNa
mara approach to defense policy,
Mr. McNamara views defense
problems as economic problems
in a broad sense. That is, he views

I defense policy making as deliber
ate and careful choosing among
alternative weapons and strate
gies in an attempt to most effec
tively use our limited defense re
sources. This approach is the
heart of the McNamara revolu
tion; it is outlined at length in
The Economics of Defense in the
Nuclear Age by C. Hitch and R.
McKean.

â€¢ Taipei vs. Florence
Dear Sir:
As a veteran of the Stanford
Center in Formosa, I found your
recent article on student life at
the Italian Center most interest
ing.
Last year, when the Editor of
| The Daily wrote to Taipei solicit
ing articles on "student life" at
i the Center, no one bothered to
reply for the simple reason that
there was nothing one could de
scribe as "student life." After
reading the description of the Ita
lian Center, it seems to me that
this is a key point of contrast by
which one can measure the effec
tiveness of the respective centers
in integrating the student with
t he local environment.
In Taipei, students do not live
together in a dormitory or, for
that matter, in any one closely
circumscribed area. Married stu
dents naturally maintain separate
residences, while single students
must make their own living ar
rangements. These, generally, are
of two kinds. A truly adventurous
student may hazard the often try
j ing experience of living in a Chin
ese dormitory, usually in a four
j person room with three Chinese
undergraduates. Many, however,
live in with a Chinese family, an
arrangement which calls for a
high degree of adaptability, but
has its rewards in an inside view
of the Chinese family not often
; attained by Westerners. In addi
tion to this, a few students choose
to exist in a state of isolation in
I separate apartments.
This means that there is no
j such thing as "student life" in the
sense of an organized group life
as at the Italian Center. Indeed,
| attempts at organization usually
i do not get very far. What is lost
I in terms of "student life," how
lever, is more than made up for
in the individual's opportunity to
deepen his understanding of China
and Chinese life. There are, of
; course, friendships and associa
tions between students on an in
dividual or small group basis, but
the mere fact of residing in an all
Chinese neighborhood, buying
food in the local market places,
! and so on, leads to a fairly ex
tended involvement with Chinese
ways of life.
In short, the circumstances of
life at the Taipei Center make it
iinevitable that the student and
his family become involved with
! local life at the expense of stu
dent solidarity. I myself feel that
it is worth it. for the experiences
and insights derived from living
!in Taipei, rather than what is
learned in the classroom, are what
I justify the existence of the Cen
ter.
