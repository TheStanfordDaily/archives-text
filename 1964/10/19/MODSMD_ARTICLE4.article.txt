### MAKY KAY BECKER News Editor 
"What aren't we doing that we
could he doing to provide a richer
religious life on campus?"
This will be the guiding ques
! tion of the newly-formed presi
dential advisory body, the Com-
I mittee on Religious Activities, ac
, cording to its chairman, Prof.
Richard W. Lyman, Associate
Dean of the School of Humanities
I and Sciences.
A FiAIiGE impetus for the for
mation of this committee, which
| mev tor the first time last week,
! was the $1 million PACE grant
j made last year by Mr. and Mrs.
I Lowell Berry of Stockton and
Oakland. This grant, establishing
: the Jayne Berry memorial fund,
; carries the stipulation that il be
i spent on religious activities out
side the curriculum. "The gen
eral view of the committee, how
! ever, is that it should have edu
jcational impact," Lyman said.
"We will be involved in a range
|of questions, from fairly philo
| sophical issues about the place
| and purpose of religious activities
!on campus, to specific issues,
i such as how exactly to spend the
I income provided by this generous
; gift."
THERE IS NO student mem
: bership on the committee. Lyman
expressed the opinion that it is
: no great loss to students not to
have student representatives in
j this case.
The crucial question to the stu
dents, he said, is whether they
. will be consulted. "The answer is
unequivocally yes," Lyman said.
The Committee will be concerned
to seek student opinion."
It is better for committee mem
bers to consult a n d co-operate
student groups themselves than
to count on their representation
by, say. two student members,
who may be ineffective and non
representative, he added.
Before any definite plans are
made, the committee will first
i amass general information, and
! will meet frequently in the near
future. "We want to find out what
,<>oes on here, what goes on else
where, and gather ideas from all
sources," Lyman said.
