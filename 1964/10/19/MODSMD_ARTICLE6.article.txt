# Galbraith: 'Can't Cut Class During Campaign Toils'
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
"We have a rule at Harvard,"
explained John Kenneth Gal
braith, economist and diplomat
turned politician for the duration
of this campaign, "you can do any
amount of political campaigning
as long as you don't cut classes."
Galbraith is working hard this
year, teaching on Tuesdays and
Thursdays a n d spending his
weekends jetting around the
country, speaking to college audi
ences and others. He is not a
happy campaigner; he is a deter
mined one.
"I REM EM BER working for
Stevenson in '.">6. It was so wear
ing that I was almost too tired
out to teach the rest of the term."
The main problem for the 6'B"
professor that year was rather
unusual. Galbraith was a ghost
writer for candidate Stevenson
who was somewhat sensitive
about having such aid. "So I tried
to keep out of the way, which is
prel ty difficult for me."
This year the ex-Ambassador to
India has to cope with difficulties

| common to modern campaigning.!
His baggage is always one stop J
behind or one ahead. On one!
weekend foray with LHJ's daugh- j
Iter Luci through Ohio, Galbraith

never saw his bags until Sunday
as the trip closed.
TIIIO WORST inconvenience,
though, is the lack of time. Be
fore Galbraith could comfortably
sprawl his lanky frame across the
front seat of a Ford wagon at the
San Francisco airport, his aides
had stuck a fact sheet in his sheet
and told him his schedule; a
speech, cocktail party and back
1o a San Francisco hold for a
reception.
"I'm afraid there won't be a
break, Ambassador," one aide
told him.
"The campaigner began read
ing, pausing a few times to ask
whether he ought to refer to one
candidate as Charlie, how long to
make the speech, who would be
on the pat form with him. "This
isn't bad, though," ho said later,
"In some places you run into
these custodians of the orthodox,
who want you to know every
thing said in their district since
William Jennings Bryan."
AS ins CAIJ moved up Uni
versity Drive, the author of "The
Affluent Society" and critic of
the aesthetics of contemporary
technology said. "You come onto
this campus and discover how
beautiful California used to be."
But aesthetics have little place
in a political campaign. Galbraith
combed back th e hank of hair
that kept falling down his fore
head. grabbed his "little black
bag," and stolidly went out to
work.
