### JOE ROSEN BLOOM 
John Kenneth Galbraith called
Senator Barry Goldwater the
"first compulsive bomb-dropper" '
and the "last spasm of laissez
faire" here Friday.
In a political speech to a large'
! crowd in Memorial Auditorium,
tho former United States ambas
sador to India attacked Goldwater
and urged the election of Presi
dent Johnson.
Using ridicule and sarcasm, he.
I said Goldwater is an "admirable;
I man" and"I am not going to tell
j you he is a fascist or a commu
nist or that lie is soft on the
KKK.
i "1 am going to discuss Senator
Goldwater as an educator. H e
! doesn't read what he himself has
I written which. I think, to a point
reflects good judgment."
Galbraith cited four issues
which "it we had debaters on the
other side capable of discussing
the issues we would be discus
sing." They were: poverty, pub
lic squalor, "the crisis of the ur
ban metropoliis" and a. continua
tion of "the policy of quiet rea
son."
This policy calls for means of
| lessening world tensions while
I not surrendering liberties, he said.
"Coexistence is noi especially
degrading and it is to be preferred
1o no existence," he said.
In a reply to a question. Gal
braith said that the immediate
military implications of the Chin
-1 ese atomic bomb would not be
[great, although it would compli
| eate such things as the test-ban
treaty and nuclear control.
"This year we don't have either
an echo or a choice." he conclud-■
ed. "what we have is just «»n<■ ,
yooiJ ticket.'"
