ler, will be doing registration
work for the mock election to be
held in November by the Missis
sippi Freedom Democratic Party.
"Everything's fine now," Morse
reported from Jackson in a
phoned interview with The Daily,
"But 1 have a wicrd feeling that
it's very temporary. You better
start raising money—l think wo
might bo here longer than we
planned."
SORENSON reported u"> The
Daily from Columbus that the
drive there was in need of funds
for transportation, office supplies,
and campaign materials, and was
also short of volunteers.
Of the six. Sorenson, Miller, and
Kaufman have been assigned to
work in Columbus in the First
Congressional District. The other
three will be assisting the MFDP
in the Delta area around Marks
in Quipman County where the
Second District is located.
The MFDP is conducting a drive
similar to last year's Aaron
Henry for Governor Campaign, in
which Mississippi Negroes will be
given the chance to show that
they would register and vote if
only given the opportunity to do
so. The Jackson office of COFO
reports that 70- to 80.000 Negroes
have registered with the party
thus far, with several thousand
more expected before election
day.
THE REGISTRATION form be
ing used is a simplified version
of the official stale form, with
the discriminatory clauses re
moved. Registration is not re
quired in order to participate in
the mock election, however, the
Jackson COFO office reported, as
many of the Negroes fear giving
their names.
The MFDP voters will have the
opportunity to choose between
Lyndon Johnson and Barry Gold
water on the national ticket, and
between Senator John Stenis and
Aaron Henry, the MFDP candi
date, for U.S. Senator. The party
is also running Congressional
candidates in the Second, Fourth,
and Fifth Districts.
