a broken home, or know someone who doe-. You may have experienced or detected

of the- lasting influence divorce has on tile children. So often p->ehialrisl- and euitn j
sclors are not ahle to snvi a failing marriage unless lu-11> i- provided through spiritual ,
channels, for marriage i- an institution which God j» rsonally established. "And 11»>
I Lord (lod said. 'It is tint good that tin man -.In >nlil he alone: I will make him a helper
i lit tor hint' .. . So the Lord God caused a dc, p sleep to fall u|nm the man. and whih
! lie slept he took nti ' uf his ribs and clostd tip its place with flesh; and the rih which I
tile Lord God had taken front the man lie made into a woman and brought her to
tin man. Then tin man said, " I his at last i- hone of my hone- and llesh of my flesh;
she shall he called woman, because she was taken out of man.' Therefore a man
leaves his father and his mother and cltavi - to bis wife, and they become one flesh."
(Genesis : l<S-J-t >
Doubters of the Old Testament will lit.nl this passage and the institution of mar
riant verified by the Lord Jcsu- Christ Himself who said. "... but from the be
ginning of creation God made them male and female. For this cause a man shall
leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and file two shall become
one. So they are no longer two but one. Whatever therefore God has joined together,
! let not man put asunder." "And in the house the disciples asked Him again about !
1 tl\i- matter. And lie said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, -
; commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another
, she commits adultery.' " (Mark 5:5-10)
The proper key to a successful marriage is for both partners to be in the proper |
relationship with God through Jesus Christ Himself. A home with Christ at the
center is harmonious and secure. Although a man and woman ma\ live together in '
a married state without Christ, the deep bond of God-given love will be lacking unless j
both know Jesus Christ personally.
I'erhaps it i- not an cart lily marringi which is giving you trouble or concern. In
fact, you may not even be married at all. However, on the spiritual plane, one's
relationship to Je-us Christ i- of vital concern and importance. The Apostle I'aul
in Romans 7:1-1 likens becoming a Christian to a marriage relationship. Those who
are living without Jesus Christ are, spiritually speaking, "married to sin" according
to the Word of God. Hut Jesus Christ nine to this planet to set men free from a
relationship to sin which has them enslaved, so that they might be joined to Him
in an inseparable way. Those who. by personal decision and commitment of their will,
receive Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior are not only set free from "marriage to sin,"
but are placed in such close union with their Lord that their entire lives arc changed.
In love and devotion the Christian serves a new .Master and Partner in direct analogy
to the devotion of a wife for her husband.
Regardless of the problem in life or the need of a human heart, Jestis Christ is j
the answer. Find out for yourself by experiencing 11 is love today.

a broken home, or know someone who doe-. You may have experienced or detected
the dee|> scars which result when i marriage is severed'; you may know something
of the- lasting influence divorce has on tile children. So often p->ehialrisl- and euitn j
sclors are not ahle to snvi a failing marriage unless lu-11> i- provided through spiritual ,
channels, for marriage i- an institution which God j» rsonally established. "And 11»>
I Lord (lod said. 'It is tint good that tin man -.In >nlil he alone: I will make him a helper
i lit tor hint' .. . So the Lord God caused a dc, p sleep to fall u|nm the man. and whih
! lie slept he took nti ' uf his ribs and clostd tip its place with flesh; and the rih which I
tile Lord God had taken front the man lie made into a woman and brought her to
tin man. Then tin man said, " I his at last i- hone of my hone- and llesh of my flesh;
she shall he called woman, because she was taken out of man.' Therefore a man
leaves his father and his mother and cltavi - to bis wife, and they become one flesh."
(Genesis : l<S-J-t >
Doubters of the Old Testament will lit.nl this passage and the institution of mar
riant verified by the Lord Jcsu- Christ Himself who said. "... but from the be
ginning of creation God made them male and female. For this cause a man shall
leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and file two shall become
one. So they are no longer two but one. Whatever therefore God has joined together,
! let not man put asunder." "And in the house the disciples asked Him again about !
1 tl\i- matter. And lie said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, -
; commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another
, she commits adultery.' " (Mark 5:5-10)
The proper key to a successful marriage is for both partners to be in the proper |
relationship with God through Jesus Christ Himself. A home with Christ at the
center is harmonious and secure. Although a man and woman ma\ live together in '
a married state without Christ, the deep bond of God-given love will be lacking unless j
both know Jesus Christ personally.
I'erhaps it i- not an cart lily marringi which is giving you trouble or concern. In
fact, you may not even be married at all. However, on the spiritual plane, one's
relationship to Je-us Christ i- of vital concern and importance. The Apostle I'aul
in Romans 7:1-1 likens becoming a Christian to a marriage relationship. Those who
are living without Jesus Christ are, spiritually speaking, "married to sin" according
to the Word of God. Hut Jesus Christ nine to this planet to set men free from a
relationship to sin which has them enslaved, so that they might be joined to Him
in an inseparable way. Those who. by personal decision and commitment of their will,
receive Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior are not only set free from "marriage to sin,"
but are placed in such close union with their Lord that their entire lives arc changed.
In love and devotion the Christian serves a new .Master and Partner in direct analogy
to the devotion of a wife for her husband.
Regardless of the problem in life or the need of a human heart, Jestis Christ is j
the answer. Find out for yourself by experiencing 11 is love today.

a broken home, or know someone who doe-. You may have experienced or detected
the dee|> scars which result when i marriage is severed'; you may know something
of the- lasting influence divorce has on tile children. So often p->ehialrisl- and euitn j
sclors are not ahle to snvi a failing marriage unless lu-11> i- provided through spiritual ,
channels, for marriage i- an institution which God j» rsonally established. "And 11»>
I Lord (lod said. 'It is tint good that tin man -.In >nlil he alone: I will make him a helper
i lit tor hint' .. . So the Lord God caused a dc, p sleep to fall u|nm the man. and whih
! lie slept he took nti ' uf his ribs and clostd tip its place with flesh; and the rih which I
tile Lord God had taken front the man lie made into a woman and brought her to
tin man. Then tin man said, " I his at last i- hone of my hone- and llesh of my flesh;
she shall he called woman, because she was taken out of man.' Therefore a man
leaves his father and his mother and cltavi - to bis wife, and they become one flesh."
(Genesis : l<S-J-t >
Doubters of the Old Testament will lit.nl this passage and the institution of mar
riant verified by the Lord Jcsu- Christ Himself who said. "... but from the be
ginning of creation God made them male and female. For this cause a man shall
leave his father and his mother and be joined to his wife, and file two shall become
one. So they are no longer two but one. Whatever therefore God has joined together,
! let not man put asunder." "And in the house the disciples asked Him again about !
1 tl\i- matter. And lie said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another, -
; commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband and marries another
, she commits adultery.' " (Mark 5:5-10)
The proper key to a successful marriage is for both partners to be in the proper |
relationship with God through Jesus Christ Himself. A home with Christ at the
center is harmonious and secure. Although a man and woman ma\ live together in '
a married state without Christ, the deep bond of God-given love will be lacking unless j
both know Jesus Christ personally.
I'erhaps it i- not an cart lily marringi which is giving you trouble or concern. In
fact, you may not even be married at all. However, on the spiritual plane, one's
relationship to Je-us Christ i- of vital concern and importance. The Apostle I'aul
in Romans 7:1-1 likens becoming a Christian to a marriage relationship. Those who
are living without Jesus Christ are, spiritually speaking, "married to sin" according
to the Word of God. Hut Jesus Christ nine to this planet to set men free from a
relationship to sin which has them enslaved, so that they might be joined to Him
in an inseparable way. Those who. by personal decision and commitment of their will,
receive Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior are not only set free from "marriage to sin,"
but are placed in such close union with their Lord that their entire lives arc changed.
In love and devotion the Christian serves a new .Master and Partner in direct analogy
to the devotion of a wife for her husband.
Regardless of the problem in life or the need of a human heart, Jestis Christ is j
the answer. Find out for yourself by experiencing 11 is love today.
