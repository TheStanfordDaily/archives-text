# New Psych Seminars Will Start In Spring
## 
### 
Beginning winter quarter, Stanford's psychology department
will offer a series of undergraduate seminars on various topics in
psychology.
The primary objective of the series will be to provide under
graduate psychology majors with a chance for seminar experience

whore problems may be examined
intensively.
THE DEPARTMENT further
hopes to provide students with
moi"e chance for informal discus
sions and small-group contact
with both students and faculty.
The seminars which in general
will be limited to fifteen students
will be aimed primarily at senior
psychology majors. In the past
"too many students have gone
through a psychology major with
all lecture courses," stated de
partment head, Albert Hastorf.
These courses will broaden the
present independent study pro

gram in which a one-to-one ratio
between students and professors
exist.
PRESENT PLANS provide for
offerings in social psychology,
personality measurement, motiva
tion, child psychology, behavorial
change, and psycho-physiology of
dreaming and sleeping. Admis
sion to the seminar will be by
permission of the instructor, and
all groups will have prerequisites.
information concerning this
new program will be sent to all
undergraduate psychology ma
jors as soon as the new Student
Directory is printed.
