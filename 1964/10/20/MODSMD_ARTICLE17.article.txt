### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity water polo
team travelled south last week
end and came back with mixed
feelings. The Indians fell Friday
to USC, 10-b, then bounced back
the following day to trip UCLA,
9-8.
Southern Cal effectively hand
cuffed the Tribe's scoring punch
with a tight six-man zone defense.
USC commanded the game from
its outset, taking advantage of
the Cards' lack of opportunity to
practice against zone defense.
Bryan Beck and Bill Derrig led
the Indians with two goals each.
Bill Ready scored once.
COACH BILL Gaughran felt
the UCLA game Saturday was

the best Ihe Tribe has played this
season. Stanford beat UCLA at
Los Angeles for the first time
since 1961.
Stanford moved ahead early
and held a decisive lead through
out the game. The closeness of
the 9-8 score does not really indi
cate the balance of power in the
game. With two minutes of the
game remaining, Stanford led by
a convincing 9-4 margin.
One penalty throw and several
foul calls later the lead dimin
ished. The entire Indian starting
line-up fouled out, but UCLA
could not overtake the Tribe.
BILL BEADY had one of his
best days, scoring four limes.
Bryan Beck and Doug Jensen
each tallied twice.
Southern Cal now reigns in the
top position in the AAWU, but
by no means are they there for
keeps. Stanford victories from
both USC and UCLA when they
come to Encina pool would tip
the scales in favor of the Cards.
