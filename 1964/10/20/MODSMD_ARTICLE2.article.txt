### HILDA KOSSOFF "ATTENTION SMERCH 
"I am from RANCH) . . .
here to remind you that you
will he observed tonight.
Don't make any mistakes —
or ( lot will die. Proceed with
plan."
The hlaek cloaked, sear
faced hunchback flung this
note, along with a piece of
Clot's red fur, down before
the president of Gavilan
house in Florence Moore
Hall. He slunk out, leaving
Sunday night dinner in an
uproar.
SMERCH (Society for .Mur
der, Evil, Robbery, C haos and
Havoc) was organized in Ga
vilan at the beginning of the
quarter. Activities include
filling joluis with dry ice —
"Have you ever had gas-ice
in YOLK jolin?!" exploded
one Gavilonian when asked
why she hated S.MEKCII so
—and stapling enemy sheets
together.
It has generated, within
its own house, such opposing
groups as BESMERCH (Bin
ges! Enemy of, He.) and
SPECTRE (Society for the
Prevention of, etc.) plus a
rival, DIE (Deeds of Incest
and Eroticism.)
RANCID, however, is its
greatest foe. This group of
unknowns, probably male,
has spirited away SMERCII'S
moscot, Clot. As Clot, who is
a red wigglchy —a foot-long
fur duster with googy eyes—
lived in a cage upstairs in
Gavilan, SMERCH is search
ing for a spying RANCIDess.
To ransom their darling,
SMERCH was ordered, a
week ago Sunday, to go to
the Post Office at 11 p.m.,
run 13 tarantulas up Hie
flagpole in a bag, and retreat
to a wooded area oil Quad.
By midnight, Clot would
have replaced the spiders.
SMERCH didn't have any
tarantulas, so they substi
tuted ail artificial pile which

had already featured in sev
eral unpleasant in-Gavilaii
"jobs." They pretended to
leave for Quad, but circled
back and hid in tlu- buses to
await developments.
A couple of passers-by
hauled down the bag, looked
in, and hurriedly ran it hack
up the pole.
Towards m i d n i g h t two
cloaked figures appeared,
scouted around, and signalled
up the alley. An ancient
ga iis te r-ge t away type car
roared up and out leaped two
more RANCIDmen, burp
guns at the ready, and a
trench-coated babe with long
blond hair.
They cautiously approached
the flagpole.
Now also hidden nearby
and unknown to all but the
Mistress of SMERCH, was a
masculine ally of hers with
an air horn. He was supposed
to sound this as soon as ( lot
was in the bag, to frighten
off RANCID, but — lie was
a few seconds early. . .
RANCH) fled, fearing the
fuzz —but keeping Clot.
Last Sunday night, th e
hunchbacked horror reap
peared. lie brought a park
age this time, labeled "RAN
CID Food." In it, 011 a bed
of mouldy potato peels and
singed red fur, were a match
box and a note: "Clotmeat
is delicious."
Wit hin the box: small
hones, shreds of old meat. . .
and lots and lots of live
ants. . .
But ( l<»t is not dead yet,
for later in the evening a
muffled voice on the phone
warned that the box was only
a sign of what might happen
if SMERCH would not light
for their pet. Olympic games
have been declared for Thurs
day. and all Gavilan is prac
ticing — at jacks and hop
scotch—to aid SMERCH.
NOTE: "RANCIDmen need
not tear unmasking," assures

SMERCH (Society for .Mur

one Gavilonian when asked
why she hated S.MEKCII so
—and stapling enemy sheets
together.

RANCID, however, is its

Gavilan, SMERCH is search

To ransom their darling,
SMERCH was ordered, a

the Post Office at 11 p.m.,
run 13 tarantulas up Hie
flagpole in a bag, and retreat
to a wooded area oil Quad.
By midnight, Clot would

SMERCH didn't have any
tarantulas, so they substi

A couple of passers-by
