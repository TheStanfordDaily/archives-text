# Editor, The Daily
## Readers Attack The Daily, But For Opposite Reasons 
### 
Dear Sir:
In your first issue you called
Time Magazine "moderately lib
eral on some issues but usually
unbiased," Hearst's Examiner "lib
erally biased" and also ascribed
to the Los Angeles Times, which
calls itself Republican, a "liberal
bias."
In your issue of October 7, in
which the Hoover conferences
were featured, you published an
entire story of Dr. Niemeyer's
blasts at liberal foreign policy,
and not until ihe last paragraph
did you identify him as a promin
ent Goldwater aide; the impres
sion given throughout the rest of
the story was that he was a dis
interested political expert who
was recounting generally accepted
views of communism.
In the same issue, an article on
Dr. Fred Schwarz appeared. Dr.
Schwarz is one of America's lead
ing pat riot ism - for - profit sales
men; his Christian Anti-Commu
nist Crusade declares in its news
letter that liberals are turning the
country over to the communists.
Yet not only was the article you
ran laudatory, but tagged with an
opinion ("Many people in many
places have heard him speak. To
night is your chance.") This in a
news story!
Even in your AP news, an ar
ticle stating that Jesse Unruh
thought that Negroes, being used
to prejudice, would not feel the
effects of Proposition 14 as
strongly as the rest of us was
headlined. "Unruh Says Prop. 14
Not Bad."
In view of all this, how can you
claim to be unbiased?

• Objectivity A Farce
Dear Sir:
Your much-vaunted "objectiv
ity" has shown itself to be a farce
and a sham.
Although there was a very spir
ited debate at the Hoover Confer
ence concerning "The Prospects
of Pluralistic Communism," the
Stanford Daily only reported Pro
fessor Lowenthal's liberal views
in its news story.
Then, of course, there was that
unbelievably slanted "news" story
about Hubert Humphrey and
"Barry's Boys," which cast all
Goldwater supporters in the role
of rude, uncouth hecklers.
You talk about a balanced edi
torial page, but you have thus far
run only Walter Lippmann, de
spite your "intentions" to balance
it eventually.
You reported in the "News In
Brief" on Friday that Lyndon
Johnson was going to speak in
San Francisco on Sunday, but left
out Barry Goldwater, who was
speaking that very night. You ne
glected (?) even to give news
coverage to Dr. Fred Schwarz's
and conservative Dr. Gerhart Nie
meyer's speeches, both of whom
spoke last Wednesday, while re
porting instead the liberals Sidney
Hook, Richard Lowenthal, and
Theodore Draper (with a para
graph at the end of the latter
article reporting, but distorting,
ihe conservative professor who
disagreed with Draper).
The Stanford Daily seems not
to be more objective and fair this
year, but simply more subtle and
circumspect in its slanting and
bias.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Herbert
Bayard Swopo once claimed to
know a sure formula for failure:
"Try to please everybody." In
light ol this the Stanford Daily
only tries to give everybody some
thing to disagree with.

• Missiles Unreliable
Dear Sir:
In his letter today, Mr. Jamison
failed to answer any of Mr. Bo
nine's points, contenting himself
with trying to explain them away
us unimportant.
Our missiles, on which we are
placing all our defense hopes, arc
not yet proved to be reliable.
General Curtis LeMay told the
House Subcommittee on Defense
Department Appropriations:
"We know from past experi
ence how much work is neces
sary to go into an aircraft sys
tem to get it reliable enough
to guarantee carrying out the
mission. We know from thou
sands and thousands of sorties
exactly what the reliability is.
For instance, in an airplane we
have an abort rate of less than
5 per cent in carrying out com
bat missions. With the missile
we will never have the degree
of experience that we have
with the manned airplane."
Our bombers are being phased
out. The Skybolt missile, which
was designed to extend the effec
tiveness of the bomber force into
the 1970'5, was killed, despite
Great Britain's protests. The Nike-
Zeus antimissile was scrapped,
although its proposed substitute
will not be ready until 3969. The
Midas "spy satellite" was killed,
which would have given extra
warning and better reconnaisance.
Mr. Jamison says, "our stra
tegic forces are dispersed, hard
ened, and mobile." However, our
60 Thor IRBMs in England were
removed shortly after ihe Cuban
crisis. Jupiter bases in Italy and
Turkey, with 45 missiles, were
abandoned just after becoming
operational at a cost of 555 mil
lions. The "hardened" missile
sites in the United States cannot
be tested because of the test ban
treaty. The proposal to make the
Minuteman "mobile" by putting
it on railroad cars was vetoed by
McNamara.
While it is true that the de
fense budget has increased some
what in the last few years, it also
increased during the Eisenhower
Administration. The important
thing is how the money is being
used. The TFX dispute showed
that at least some of the money
is being wasted on politically
awarded contracts.
Most enlightening was an
article by Dr. Stefan T. Possony
of t he Hoover Institution, an
arms-race' expert, in April 1963.
Possony said:
"The fact that we presently are
investing in research and develop
ment 50 cents for every $1 we
are spending on procurement
means that we are financing
many exploratory research pr o
grams. It does not mean that we
are modernizing our decisive
weapon systems.
"Perhaps the philosophy of 'the
biggest bang for the buck' has
its faults. But the present phil
osophy of 'the least bang for the
most bucks' courts disaster. All
things considered, it does nol look
as though, under the stewardship
of Robert S. McNamara, the
United States is being equipped
to forestall a nuclear and techno
logical Pearl Harbor."
Sincerely,
GARRETT PA (.ON
• The 4Ju<l Guy Theory"
Dear Sir:
.Recent. Daily articles such as
Mr. John E. Bonine's "The Politi
cal Scene" (Oct. 14) and the Oct.
15 editorial on Vietnam seem to
indicate that there are many on
the Daily who hold what might

be called the bad guy theory of
foreign affairs. According to this
theory the world is divided into
two groups, the good guys it he
U.S. and a few other western na
tions) and the bad guys (Rus
sia, China and almost any country
that has more than an absolute
minimum of relations with these
two). The theory goes on to say
that the only mental effort that
the good guys have to put forth
in dealing with the bad guys is
just that amount necessary to
realize that the bad guys are
really sneaky, cynical, nasty
people whose one and only ob
ject in life is to "get" the good
guys. "To accomplish this," to
quote The Daily, "they will use
every available means (including
the breaking of negotiated settle
ments) and will wait whatever
time required, as long as that
ultimate goal is brought ever
nearer to final realization." Thus
the only foreign policy that will
be a success is one that recog
nizes and acts on the ultimate
badness of the bad guys.
From this theory it follows, as
Mr. Bonine says, that any reduc
tion in our armaments or any at
tempt at "negotiated settlement"
in Vietnam (these are Mr. Bo
nine's quotes, read "compromise
with evil") play right into the
bad guys hands. Indeed, any act
of trust, charity, or kindness to
ward anyone will be playing right
into their hands.
Fortunately. however, the
world is not so simple as the bad
guy theory would make it out to
be. Though no one will deny that
Communism has given rise to
some very evil things, a blanket
condemnation of Communism as
a monolithiely evil system in the
face of obvious diversity among
Communist nations and such good
results as increased material
wealth, simply cannot be main
tained. Such a condemnation gives
rise to the paradoxical situation
of belittling the Russian economic
on the one hand and being afraid
that they will "catch up with the
U.S." on the other.
The fact is that neither the
Communist or the American sys
tem has all the answers and that
neither is as good or as bad as
the bad guy theory holds them to
be. Perhaps Mr. Bonine and The
Daily, rather than continually
pointing out how bad the bad
guys arc, would lie better advised
to spend their lime trying to solve
the complicated human problems
that gave rise to these different
methods of solution in the first
place.

• The 'Temporary' Mess
Dear Sir:
Considering the frequent criti
cism of the Administration by
the student body, we feel it our
duty to praise them for preserv
ing one of the campus beauty
spots. Indeed, it warms our hearts
each day as we wearily trudge
back and forth between Cro Mem
and the Quad. Of what could we
be speaking, but the disaster
area surrounding Ihe half-razed
temporary classrooms west of
the education building?
Fortunately, the Administra
tion appears to have stopped the
work, in order to preserve the
wild, untamed beauty of the
place. Such a sight lightens the
heart in our otherwise orderly,
regimented environment.
This is but a step in the right
direction. Couldn't the Palo Alto
city dump be brought on cam
pus?
