# The 						Political Scene
## Internal Security Needless If The Cold War Has Elided 
### John E. Bonine 
The "Jenkins Affair" lias import perhaps not so much in its
seeming vindication of Republican charges of scandal and cover
up in the White House as in what it tells us about our internal
security program.
Even the New lork Time,y raised its editorial eyebrows at the

possible implications of the case.-*
both as to possible foreknowledge
by President Johnson and to the
laxity in our security program.
Lyndon Johnson, of course,
could not have comfortably dis
posed of Walter Jenkins even
upon learning of his arrest in
19.19, for, in the words of CBS
Newsman Dan Rather on Sunday
night, "No one man was as close
to Lyndon Johnson over the years
as Walter Jenkins."
Jenkins and Johnson
He has been with Johnson for
twenty-five years (since age 21),
was vice-president of the LBJ
company (which runs ihe John
son broadcasting empire), and
has been involved in most of Lyn
don Johnson's various activities.
He could spill a very large pot j
of beans, ranging from the 1948;
cleclion irregularities to the Bil
lie Sol Estes and Bobby Baker
cases.
As additional details of Die se
curity slippage unfold with each
passing day, it becomes obvious!
that there are great defects in
our internal security program, of
which this is only the most re
cent indication.
(It is important to point out j
here that a "security risk" is not
necessarily a "loyalty risk." Se- J
curity risks also include perfectly
loyal individuals who, neverthe
less, have character weaknesses, i
unpublicized backgrounds, or
relatives in unfriendly countries I
â€”and thus are potential targets |
for blackmail and threats.*
Security Files Burned
In September the Senate Inter
nal Security Subcommittee, which
has been investigating lax secur
ity practices, was told of an order
issued on August 28 to State Dei
partment security field offices,
instructing them to forward all
originals of their investigative
reports to Washington and to
burn their remaining files, both!
completed reports and "raw" data.
Several Senators objected pub
licly, including Everett Dirksen;
on September 29. Bill Miller j
spoke out the same day. Th e
Senate G.O.P. policy committee
met to consider the matter, but
file destruction was already com
pleted.
Another festering sore is the
Itto Otepka case. Otepka was the
ranking Deputy Director of the
Security Office in the State De
partment and was in charge of
the personnel security organiza
tion of the Department, before a
reshuffling required him to j
"show cause" why he should not
be fired on the basis of "econ- >
omy."
Otepka .Suspension
He was called to testify before!
the subcommittee last fall, then
suspended by the State Depart
ment for giving the subcommit
tee information which State did j
not want revealed. He also
offered proof that some Depart
ment officials had lied under
oath in testimony before the
committee.
Just two weeks ago Sen. Karl
Mundt claimed to have informa

tion showing that fifteen govern
ment officials at the ambassa
dorial level or higher had insuf
ficient security clearances.
These examples are illustrative
of a great change which has come
over security agencies. An article
in the May 19(51 issue of the
Bulletin of ihe Atomic Scientists
evaluated the history of the AEC
Q-Clearance program, conclud
ing:
"The overall attitude of secur
ity officials has changed percep
tively. Six years ago, most would
have described their basic mis
sion as keeping subversives and
security risks out of sensitive
positions. Today they would say:
'Our mission is to clear people.' "
More Cases Cleared
The author, Harold Green, for
mer counsel of the AEC's legal
division who now specializes in
defending persons accused of be
ing security risks, elaborated on
the matter in an interview: "I
handle a lot of security cases and
I can say with certainty that
there are cases being cleared to
day in all agencies of government
that couldn't possibly have been
cleared ten years ago." He added.
"I think this is a good thing."
The AEC denies the laxity, but
a former high-ranking official
told the editors of the"Washing
ton Report" of the American Se
curity Council: "Security has be
come unpopular throughout gov
ernment. And men who practice
it assiduously have found that
this is a good way to lose their
jobs."
It is entirely logical that our
security program should be going
on the rocks. It is difficult to
justify a rigid security program
if the Administration pursues a
policy based on the belief that the
Communists are "mellowing," the
Cold War is about over, and the
Soviets only desire peace.
Roslow's "Mellowing" Theory
In 1962, Walt W. Rostow, State
Department counselor and chair
man of its Policy Planning Board,
drew up a position paper as a
guide for future decisions by the
President and the National Secur
ity Council.
Word of the contents leaked
out to the press, and G.O.P. min
ority leader Everett Dirksen took
to the floor of the U.S. Senate on
June 18, to denounce it:"The
core of Mr. Rostow's proposal is
an assumption that the Soviet
Union ... | is | mellowing." News
papers reported 1 hat the plan con
tained suggestions for "unilateral
initiatives" in arms reduction.
It would be obviously incon
sistent to expect government offi
cials to run an internal security
program with any close attention
if they are operating under these
assumptions.
Ol least it can be said for the
Democratic Administration th.it
it is consistent in its beliefs and
actions. At least they are not eon-
I radict ory < t hough some fee J
they are wrongi, if that provides
any small comfort.
