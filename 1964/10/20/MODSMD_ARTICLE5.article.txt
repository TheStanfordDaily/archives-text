# Constitutional Changes Needed On Reapportionment: Younger
## 
### 
i "A constitutional amendment
i by the states is needed to nullify
the reapportionment decision of
the United States Supreme
! Court," declared .Republican Con
l gressman Art Younger yesterday
afternoon, as he addressed Stan
: ford's Young Republicans in Tre-
I sidder Union.
Younger, who represents San
Mateo County's 11th Congres
sional District, expressed the
: fear that "if the recent Supreme
Court decision is enforced, th e
: rural districts of Northern Cali
fornia would lose their voice.
"Where the people are, there is
your control," continued the Con
gressman. Using the folksy ex-
I pression of an old friend. Younger
emphasized bluntly that the "mas
sters of the state legislature" are
those "who got dah votes."
Emphasizing that minority

rights musl be protected in Cali
fornia, Younger suggested that
"if the Supreme Court decision
is enforced, Los Angeles, San
Diego, and Orange Counties will
control sixty per cent of the state
legislature unless a constitutional
amendment is sought."
Younger pointed out that the

principle of "one man, one vote,"
returns less populated districts
: and rural areas to the old dilem
| ma of representation faced at the
1 Constitutional Convention. He
, feared that Northern California
i would become ineffectual in ob
taining its demands in the state
I legislature.
