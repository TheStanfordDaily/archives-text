# LASSU SPEAKER
## Shaw Analyzes Duties 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
Ed Shaw, recently elected LASSU Speaker,
maintains that it is not for him to determine the
future of the Legislature. "They arc going to have
to define their own relationship with the Univer
sity," he says, pausing a moment before discuss
ing what he thinks the future ought to be.
Shaw sees the Legislature performing as a
constructive critic, asking questions of the Uni
versity administration, and presenting the stu
dent opinion on issues. But first, he feels, the
Legislature must prove that it is effective.
Will EE STUDENT government has no power
in the administration, it can present ideas and
these ideas will be listened to if the administra
tion has the assurance that the students are re
sponsible," he says. "At least I hope that they will
for if the administration won't listen to a respon
sible voice, it defeats what they're trying to do
here."
Last year, as student financial manager, Shaw
came into a great deal of contact with the Legis
lature. and makes no secret of his disappointment
in much of what he saw. "At one meeting," he
points oul. "The Legislature made a $3,000 appro
priation with virtually no discussion, and without
even finding out where the money was coming
from. They spent more time at the meeting hag
gling over a $30 appropriation to the AWS."
However, he does feel that the larger, 120 mem
ber Legislature is at least a potential improve
ment over the previous 30 member cabinet-type
government ol several years ago.
"THEKE IS more representation and there are
120 minds on the same problem rather than 30
in I he old cabinet."
Shaw noted thai there was some improvement
in the Legislature. As the year progressed, the
members sought more information on a subject

before they would vote. He feels, however, that
LAS.SU still depended too heavily on the student
body president and not enough on its own initia
tive.
"The Legislature didn't initiate anything of its
own, leaving the policy of the student government
to fluctuate with the yearly change of student
body presidents. Neither has the Legislature en
gaged in what might be called preventive main
tenance. Things go on until something serious
develops, such as some of the problems of the
judicial system, and then LASSU is told how to
solve the problem."
"1H T Tin; individual students on campus are
wrong in their opinions on student government.
The ASSU gets very little credit for the things that
it does do.
In the important area of student-administra
tion relationships, Shaw is more hesitant about
the future of the Legislature. "We are a transient
sub-section of the University community, and as
such can't expect a full voice in policy, hut we
can present constructive criticism, and we have
a right to air that criticism. Nor should we give
up because we make little headway in being
heard."
But I think students should be more than
merely critics of Ihe University. They should do
more, perhaps eventually actually participating in
making the University's decisions," he says. "But
there are some areas in which students should not
participate. You can't expect a bunch of 18 and
19-year-old kids to run a S3OO million business,"
the former student financial manger says.
"But,'' he adds, "We aren't going to cure the
ills of student government in a single year. It
will take a long time. And if the individual mem
bers of the Legislature fail l<> work, and fail in
their responsibilities, then we will be back where
wo started from."

dent opinion on issues. But first, he feels, the
Legislature must prove that it is effective.
Will EE STUDENT government has no power
in the administration, it can present ideas and
these ideas will be listened to if the administra
tion has the assurance that the students are re
sponsible," he says. "At least I hope that they will
for if the administration won't listen to a respon
sible voice, it defeats what they're trying to do
here."
Last year, as student financial manager, Shaw
came into a great deal of contact with the Legis
lature. and makes no secret of his disappointment
in much of what he saw. "At one meeting," he
points oul. "The Legislature made a $3,000 appro
priation with virtually no discussion, and without
even finding out where the money was coming
from. They spent more time at the meeting hag
gling over a $30 appropriation to the AWS."
However, he does feel that the larger, 120 mem
ber Legislature is at least a potential improve
ment over the previous 30 member cabinet-type
government ol several years ago.
"THEKE IS more representation and there are
120 minds on the same problem rather than 30
in I he old cabinet."
Shaw noted thai there was some improvement
in the Legislature. As the year progressed, the
members sought more information on a subject

before they would vote. He feels, however, that
LAS.SU still depended too heavily on the student
body president and not enough on its own initia
tive.
"The Legislature didn't initiate anything of its
own, leaving the policy of the student government
to fluctuate with the yearly change of student
body presidents. Neither has the Legislature en
gaged in what might be called preventive main
tenance. Things go on until something serious
develops, such as some of the problems of the
judicial system, and then LASSU is told how to
solve the problem."
"1H T Tin; individual students on campus are
wrong in their opinions on student government.
The ASSU gets very little credit for the things that
it does do.
In the important area of student-administra
tion relationships, Shaw is more hesitant about
the future of the Legislature. "We are a transient
sub-section of the University community, and as
such can't expect a full voice in policy, hut we
can present constructive criticism, and we have
a right to air that criticism. Nor should we give
up because we make little headway in being
heard."
But I think students should be more than
merely critics of Ihe University. They should do
more, perhaps eventually actually participating in
making the University's decisions," he says. "But
there are some areas in which students should not
participate. You can't expect a bunch of 18 and
19-year-old kids to run a S3OO million business,"
the former student financial manger says.
"But,'' he adds, "We aren't going to cure the
ills of student government in a single year. It
will take a long time. And if the individual mem
bers of the Legislature fail l<> work, and fail in
their responsibilities, then we will be back where
wo started from."
Ed Shaw, recently elected LASSU Speaker,
maintains that it is not for him to determine the
future of the Legislature. "They arc going to have
to define their own relationship with the Univer
sity," he says, pausing a moment before discuss
ing what he thinks the future ought to be.
Shaw sees the Legislature performing as a
constructive critic, asking questions of the Uni
versity administration, and presenting the stu
dent opinion on issues. But first, he feels, the
