# SF Columnist Charges Bias
## 'Liberal Conformism' Here? Examiner Writer Thinks So 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Editor 
Stanford University was charged with academic imbalanee
and "liberal conlorniism" in a column by George N. (Crocker which
appeared in Sunday's San Vrancixco Examiner.
The column, entitled "Bias on the Campus," enumerated at
tempts by donors here and elsewhere to contribute to the crea-

I tion of chairs for conservative
: professors of economics and po
litical science.
CROCKER pointed to several
instances in the last two years,
j involving the Winds of Freedom
I Foundation and individual donors,
j in which such donations have
I been turned down or not used.
He concluded: "In practice, a
conservative teacher, no matter
what his qualifications, is about
j as welcome in the Econ. or Poli.
I Sci. departments of most univer
sities as Ben-Gurion would be on
1 the Council of the Arab League
or Barry Goldwater in the ADA."
University officials, however,
j deny that political considerations
I have entered into the refusal of
funds.
THE FIRST case cited by
| Crocker was the contribution of
$500,000 made in October 1902 by
I Mr. and Mrs. Carroll Roush of
j Palo Alto for the establishment
I of a professorship in the free en
terprise economy. At the time
i President Wallace Sterling said
j that "the new professorship will
enable Stanford to expand its in
! struction and research concerning
| the American economy and others
I which organize their resources
through private enterprise. It
will also encourage study of the
impact of public policy on the
well-being and prosperity of these
1 economies."
No one has yet been recruited to
fill the chair created by the Roush
Jgift. Charged Crocker: "The es-
I tablishment, once entrenched,
: never surrenders a bastion, never
i relinquishes a monopoly grace
] fully. The Roushes ait* still wait
| ing. Excuses, so far, are the only
â–  reward for their fine intention,
while the university claims to be
I beating the bushes to find the
1 professor."
A D3IIN IST K AT I ON officials,
however, emphasize the care
which must be taken to locate a
i professor for this seat. Accord
ing to Professor Robert R. Sears.
| Dean of the School of Humanities
i and Sciences. "This is a very im
! portant professorship. We can't
just grab the first guy going by."
I Sears said that the University is
now very actively involved in re
| cruiting a professor to fill the
post. "We arc in hopes that we
j will be able to fill it by the end
of the year."
The second example of political
j discrimination used by Crocker
I was action taken on attempted
donations by the Winds of Free
dom Foundation, organized in
June 1962.
The Foundation is a group of
Stanford alumni organized into a
non-profit corporation whose
"prime purpose is to aggregate
iunds for gifts to Stanford."
TIIK FOUNDATION feels that
"a concerted effort should be
made to help Stanford be a lead
er in overtly standing for tradi
tional American principles . . .
of individualism, free enterprise,
private property, limited govern
ment and national sovereignty."
The Foundation immediately
set about soliciting gifts for Stan
ford. but it failed to gain the per
i mission of the Board of Trustees
to use Stanford's name.
The literature of the organiza
tion closely resembles that of the
Stanford Associates, the official
alumni soliciting organization.
ACCORDING to a 1038 general
policy statement, "The Board of
Trustees welcomes the formation
of organized groups to work for
the welfare ol tli' 1 University and
'wishes to encourage active par

ticipation by alumni and friends
in these organizations, but the in
terests of orderly and effective
procedure suggest that Board ap
proval and endorsement be sought,
before any groups bearing ihe
Stanford name are formed out
side the present pattern of or
ganizations to work on behalf of
the University."
Furthermore, according to Dav -
id Jacobson, General Secretary of
the University, "the trustees will
never accept a gift for any pur
pose from an organization, which.
as the Winds of Freedom has, sets
itself up to solicit funds in Stan
ford's name. The University
would be very reluctant to give
any outside group such permis
sion. We cannot allow competition
with present, long existing fund
raising organizations."
IN IOM the Board of Trustees
refused a WOF gift earmarked
to bring a professor the founda
tion would choose to Stanford for
one year. Later, the Foundation
submitted a list of six professors
from which Stanford could select.
Those included Francis Graham
Wilson of the University of 11 li
nois, Gerhari Nicmeyer of Notre
Dame. Warren G. Nutter of the
University of Virginia, Milton
Friedman and George Stigler of
the University of Chicago, and
Russell Kirk. The funds were
again refused.
The reasons for the refusal of
this gift were that the money had
been raised in Stanford's name
without Stanford's permission
and that the trustees reserve the
right to control the use of gifts to
Ihe University.
According to Keneth Cuthbert
son, Vice President for Finance.
"Accepting a gift from an un
authorized group is an endorse
ment which the trustees don't
feel they can give."
OFFICIALS emphasize that the
University will accept gifts whose
uses are stipulated in advance
such as the Roush gift. But it will
not share its authority over those
funds once the grant is made.
On May 7. 1963, it was disclosed
that the trustees had refused gift
offers from two individuals who
stipulated the use of the funds
1)0 designated or approved by the
Winds of Freedom Foundation di
rectors at a later date.
At Ihat time, tho trustees en
dorsed a previous policy state
ment thai: "the board cannot sur
render or divide the responsibil
ity and authority for controlling
iho University's affairs, including
the solicitation and acceptance of
gifts and the determination of
their use."
LAST JUNE, a further gift of
$500 was turned down again 011
the grounds that Winds of Free
dom had not been authorized to
solicit funds for Stanford.
University officials emphasize
that none of these actions were
taken with politics in mi.id. "Po
litical considerations are not the
issue at all," according to Jacob
son.
Any organization, regardless of
politics, would receive the same
treatment under similar condi
tions, officials conclude.
