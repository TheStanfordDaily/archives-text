"all the advantages with none of the disadvantages
Straw Men"
Have you ever seriously analyzed what it is that is keeping you from a personal
relationship with God? I ho overwhelming majority <>i people recognize that there is
a Cod; iim-i. however, honestly admit that they do not know (iod personally or feel
close to 11 im.
People often reject Christianity because they do not know what it really is,
Arnold Toynbee. the eminent historian, has said: "Most people have not rejected
Christianity, l'hey have rejected a caricature.'' I hey have actually created a "straw
man," called it Christianity, and decided against it.
Many famous skeptics such as Thomas Paine, \oltairc. Robert Tngcrsol, H. fi.
Wells, and Bertrand Russell, have gone to great ends to justify their rejection of
Christianity. A careful hearing of tin reasons often shows that they ha\e rejected
a "straw man" fabricated out of erroneous concepts and misunderstandings.
For example, strange as it may seem, some intelligent people reject, f hristianity
for no other reason than that they had an unhappy experience with a chudhoot
Sundav school teacher. Others sec the hypocrisy of professing Christians. Still others
judge Christianity by the Crusades, the Inquisition, and the well-known corruption
and in the Christian church throughout history.
Too often. Christianity is viewed as just a way of life a way involving church
attendance, giving offerings, and trying to live by the golden rule.
What does Christianity mean to you? Docs the word suggest steeples, prayer
hooks, boring >ermons, or it you are Jewish, terrible persecutions. I)«» you think
of a storv you heard about some church leader, or. perhaps an unpleasant expei lenee
with i pp.i'i .sine Christian? Are these votir "straw men"? Genuine paper currency
alwaj s lias its eoiinterfeit. W ould it be rational to reject the genuine just because the
counterfeit also exists.
Ood created tnan to enjoy fellowship with ITim and to experience the fullness of
His love and purpose, (iod's wonderful plan and love are explained in t h♦ BiMe and
fully reveal.d in tin Person of Jesus Christ. It is a thrilling revelation to many
people when they realize that Christ is a living Person.
Are \ oil among those who luwiestK want to know <>od, but somehow have not
been able to lind 11 im : Max we -uggest a simple plan we know w ill help .' I'.irst, read
the Ciospel of John in the New Testament, or better still tin entire New testament,
with receptive' spirit. Then, from what you have read, carefully write down who
you think Jesus Christ is and why lie came to this idanet. Thirdly, dcline a I liris
tian. Finally, writ, down your best reasons for not becoming a I hristian. Are you
sure that what you have been rejecting is Christianity '
Now we ( ncour i'.v to consider a living Person, Jestts Christ. T'orget for the mo
ment elmreb reli nit, > particular denomination, ministers, and Christians yon may
know Consider lesti* Christ: Ilis sinless lite. His claims to be (iod, and His re-ur
reel ion from the dead. Honestly, now, what do you lind wrong with Flim?
True Christianity, as described in the New Testament, is JesUs Christ living
His life in and through an individual. Christ alone can forgive and cleanse you of
votir Ins anil then fill your heart with .1 peace that cannot be experienced in any
other way. Simply confess your need avd invite Him to make Himself known to
you as Lord and Savior.
