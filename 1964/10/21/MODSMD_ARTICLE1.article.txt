can only be grateful and proud.
"If anything could assuage the

and human dignity and brought
idief to human suffering."
lIOOVEIi TOWKK, rising 2N.~>
leet above the Stanford campus,
is a constant reminder of the for
mer president's interest in the
pursuit of knowledge. Dedicated
in 19-11, the Hoover Institution
on War. Revolution, and Peace ■
is a loading center for advanced
study on political, social, and
(conomie changes in the twentieth
century.
Dr. W. Glenn Campbell. Direc
toi of the Hoover Institution,'
credits its Founder with "fore
sight of the highest order and a
degree of vision that few persons
ever equal in a lifetime of en

deavor."
Campbell notes that this is only
one among scores of Hoover's
public s e r vi ce achievements,
which he rates as "of unparalleled
scope and importance.
ACCORDING to Ralph 11. Lutz
emeritus professor of history at
Stanford, the Hoover Institute
reached "its present position of
world pre-eminence" because "Mr.
Hoover was the only great states
man of the First World War who
had tin" vision and the organiza
• tional ability to plan the docu
mentation of t he forces of good
and evil which emerged from this
first cataclysm of the Twentieth
Century involving all the major
powers."
Lutz, who was assigned in 1919
to do research in central and east
t'i n Kurope for the Institute, em
phasis that Mr. Hoover "had
the moral stature to carry out

this vision which obviously re
j quired the objective documenta
tion of political, ideological and
social movements resulting from
this titanic conflict."
The Founder himself was de
termined to dedicate the Institu
tion to pure research. "All the
original materials of contempor
ary history we can lay our hands
on are as free as the Sierra winds
for historians to interpret as they
see fit." lie said.
HOOVER SAID in 1911, "The
purpose of this Institution is to
promote peace. Its records stand
as a challenge to those who pro
mote war. They should attract
those who search for peace."
Every new experience in gov
ernment stimulated Mr. Hoover
lo provide for the accumulation
oJ knowledge. The Food Research
Institute was established at Stan
ford as a result ot his World War

I position ol United State- Food
; Administrator. In that capacity,
he provided foot! for the Allies
and controlled domestic produc
tion and distribution.
Dr. Joseph S. Davis, a director
: of the Institute from 1921 until
19.">2, explains that this wartime
experience influenced Hoover to
initiate the Food Research Insti
lute, "lie was aware of the gaps
in knowledge in this area, lie was
actually thirsty for reliable knowl
| edge."
ST I DIES OF the production,
consumption, and distribution of,
food were to be the function of
'the proposed Institute. The avail-j
ability of the trade data contained
in the annals of the Hoover Lib-1
j rary influenced I he decision to j
establish the new Food Research
project at Stanford.
Then Secretary of Commerce in
the Harding administration, Mr. |

Hoover became chairman ot an
advisory committee for the Foot!
Research Institute. Dr. Davis,
now emeritus director, stresses
the independence that Hoover al
ways desired for the Research
Institute, even in his later policy
making position as President.
THE EOOD Research Institute
had lead research in new fields,
most recently the agriculture of
Africa.
Humanitarian efforts such as
these prompted the respect of the
world. Dr. Thomas A. Bailey,
Stanford's Margaret Byrne Pro
lessor of American History, noted
their importance.
"Herbert Hoover will perhaps
be best known to history not as
the hard-luck president who was
bedeviled by a depression, but as
the dedicated public servant and
humanitarian who fed more peo
ple and saved more lives than

any other man who has e \ <• r
lived."
\<;\l\ ( OMMIMMM. (In
former president's humanitai ian
ism i Professor I lolon l-'arns
worth, Acting Director of the
Food Research Institute.
"His far-sighted realism and
humanitarianism will long re
! main a guiding light to many
thousands who never knew him,
as well as to those who did."
Close associates of Mr. Hoover
describe another facet of the dy
namic; man. Dr. Campbell, closeiy
i allied with Mr. Hoover through
i the Institution on War, Revolu
tion, and Peace, concluded:
"Above al, he was a warm and
j considerate person with a keen
sense of humor. The greatest
privilege of my life has been to
know Mr. Hoover and to enjoy
his friendship."
