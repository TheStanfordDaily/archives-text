## 
### 
The Stanford Health Service
and Public Health authorities
urge an annual influenza immu
nization for individuals with a
heart condition, lung problem or
respiratory illness.
Information gathered by the
U.S. Public Health Service Sur
veillance Unit in Chamblee, Geor
gia, indicates that there is no ex
pectation of an influenza epidemic
for the coming winter.
Therefore, for the average per
son in good health a sporadic in
cidence of influenza present no
problem and an immunization is
not required.
Some vaccine will be available
upon request for persons not suf
fering from a respiratory illness
or heart condition, but immuni
/.ation is not strongly urged at
this time.
