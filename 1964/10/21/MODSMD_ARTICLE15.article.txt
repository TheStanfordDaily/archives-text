# Truckload Of Whites Threaten 'Freedom Project' Volunteers
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
Two Stanford students, "Mis
sissippi Freedom Project" volun
teers, were greeted by a truck
load of angry whites yesterday
in Lambert, Mississippi, and told
to "get out of town and stay out
before somebody gets shot."
They will return to Lambert
today.
THE TWO volunteers, Frank
Morse and Dave Harris, reported
the incident to the Daily yester
day in a phone conversation
which was apparently being mo
nitored by the Mississippi oper
ator, The Daily was unable to
phone the project office in Marks
directly because all in-coming calls
were mysteriously being blocked
out, possibly by Ihe local Missis
sippi company.
Morse said that he and Harris
had endeavored to report Ihe
death threat to the local police,
but that this had proved impos
sible. When the two identified
themselves as COFO workers, the
police hung up.
The two students are based in
Marks, Mississippi, in the North
western part of the state -— an
area controlled by the White Citi
zens' Council. Morse reported that
one week ago a local Negro, sym
pathetic to the civil rights move
ment, had been killed, mutilated,
and thrown in a river. There was

| no local investigation.
A FEW days ago, one of the
civil rights workers, a Mississippi
Negro, was attacked by a band
of white youths on his way to a
rally, sustaining severe lacera
tions on one arm. He was sum
marily arrested by the local po
| lice.
Elsewhere in the state, the

climate is apparently quiet but
tense as the November 3 election
nears.
Doug Sorenson, another Stan
ford volunteer, reported that the
Columbus, Mississippi, Freedom
House had been burned to the
ground last week. There was no
investigation.
Sorenson added bitterly, . .
nobody investigates anything like
that anymore. They just happen
all the time."
HE IS BASED in Columbus
along with three other Stanford
workers — Marli Schenk, Mitch
Miller, and Ron Kaufman. The
students intend to leave Missis
sippi for Stanford this Saturday.
Another group of volunteers is
preparing to enter the state late
this week.
The "Freedom Project" as a
whole is in dire need off unds,
supplies, and volunteers, the six
students report. The Marks, Mis
sissippi, office is on a budget of
$25 per month, total.
BEFORE MORSE and Harris
arrived, there were only three
civil rights workers operating in
ihe whole of Quipman County.
There is no car, available to the
Marks office, so all local canvass
ing must be done on foot. There
is one teacher for the Freedom
School. There are no lawyers.
"These people need help bad,"
Harris pleaded.
