# Liturgical Series Begins Tonight
## Brown Speaks On Election 
### 
"Th e Protestant Liturgical
Heritage" will be the topic of
Toive Harjunpaa, professor of
Church History at the Pacific
Lutheran Theological Seminary,
speaking tonight at 8 p.m. in Rm.
275, Tresidder.
It is the first in a series of lec
tures sponsored by the Stanford
Christian Council and the Com
mittee on Religious Affairs in re
sponse to the increasing interest
of students in the worship prac
tices of churches other than their
own.
Lectures will deal with the
ceremonial traditions of the three
branches of Christendom. In addi
tion, services in Memorial Church
will demonstrate and explain the
particular features of liturgical
practice within each tradition.

California Governor Edmund G. "Pat" Browne
predicted here yesterday Proposition 14 would
pass and both Senator Pierre Salinger and Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson would win in November.
"In this whole campaign I haven't met anyone
who is really for Goldwater," he said. "I am sure
there are some, but I just haven't met them."
SITTING IN the midst of students, Brown made
the predictions and answered questions at an in
formal gathering of Stanford Young Democrats
in Tresidder Lounge.
He also paid tribute to former President Her
bert Hoover, who died yesterday, calling him
"Stanford University's most distinguished gradu
ate." Ho said President Hoover contributed a "tre
mendous amount to his country and to the world,
and I am a real admirer of his."
Turning to political issues, the Governor said
there is strong support for Proposition 14 in
Southern California, which would carry the initia
tive despite Northern California's opposition.
"SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA will make the dif
ference as in the Goldwater-Rockefeller primary.
But I never give up hope."
"A great many people in the soiith (California)
who normally vote Democratic will vote yes," he
predicted.
Brown said he had worked hard to defeat the
initiative. "They want freedom to discriminate,
that's all they want," he said.

THE GOVERNOR said its passage would be
"bad government" since it "will take away from
the legislature the right to deal with the most
burning issue of our day—the Negro revolt."
Between sips of coffee, Brown, who nominated
and is now campaigning for Johnson, said the
President would win by a "tremendous vote" and
that the "moderates" would regain control of the
Republican party.
He called Johnson's record "fine" and said he
"is as liberal a man as you would want for Presi
dent." "I believe he was far more of a conserva
tive eight years ago than he is today, but what
is important is where he stands today."
"The Republicans emphasize violence in the
streets, but they don't tell you what they are going
to do about it. . . . Are they going to have a na
tional police force."
SALINGER, Ihe campaigning Democrat said,
would have a "harder time" since he "lost mo
mentum" in the campaign when he went to Wash
ington as a senator.
But he said the Senator will win by a "good
vote" because he is a good candidate." He charged
Salinger's opponent, George Murphy, "knows
nothing of the problems of government."
On the question of reapportionment of the
state legislature, he said he did not approve of the
present reapportionment by "one person, one vote."
" I would hope a constitutional amendment
could be passed," he said.
