# GOLF TEAM LEADS
## Success Marks Last 10 Sports Years Here 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The last ten years in the Stan
ford Athletic Department have
been ones of ups and downs. On
the national level, while Stanford
; has not been national champion
I in any sport, Indian teams have
; finished second in the nation
three times.
Golf and tennis were nalional
runners-up in 1957 and 1958 re
spectively. The Stanford track
team, led by captain and field
event champion Dave Weill, was
second in the NCAA track meet
in 1963.
A 10-YEAR survey shows golf,
swimming, and rugby leading all
sports in won-lost percentage.
Swimming and rugby have never
had losing seasons at Stanford.
Since 1955 the golf team has com
piled a 100-20-1 record and since
1958 there have been 8 All-Ameri
i can golfers at Stanford. There
has been at least one All-Ameri
can in golf each year since 1958.
The lowest percentages belong
I to the gymnastics and football
teams. Their records are .226 and
.375. However, it should be noted
that for all 14 sports in w hi c h
i Sstanford competes on the inter
| collegiate level each year, the

| school has never had a "losing
i year." In fact the last two years
have seen the highest percent
ages. with the 1962-1963 school
year having a .688 won-lost record.
Chuck Taylor, who has been
connected with Stanford as stu
dent, coach, or athletic director
since 1939, comments that he has
! seen ''a decline in athletic success
since the Second World War." He
cites the increase in academic cm
! phasis in high schools as a cause
of tougher competition.
WITH REGARD to the physi
cal education and intramural pro
grams in the school, says Taylor,
"These programs haven't really
gotten belter this is not due to
limited interest, but to limited
facilities." This problem should
be largely eliminated with th e
planned construction of a 2mil
lion dollar pavilion sometime next
year. When completed, the pavil
ion will seat upwards ol' 8,000
people and will house vastly im
proved and expanded P.E. and
intramural programs.
Taylor predicts that the next
10 years should bring "a con
tinuous long-range prog ra m
which will include a greater inter
est in "newer" sports like crew,
soccer, and wrestling.

i Sstanford competes on the inter
| collegiate level each year, the

| school has never had a "losing
i year." In fact the last two years
have seen the highest percent
ages. with the 1962-1963 school
year having a .688 won-lost record.
Chuck Taylor, who has been
connected with Stanford as stu
dent, coach, or athletic director
since 1939, comments that he has
! seen ''a decline in athletic success
since the Second World War." He
cites the increase in academic cm
! phasis in high schools as a cause
of tougher competition.
WITH REGARD to the physi
cal education and intramural pro
grams in the school, says Taylor,
"These programs haven't really
gotten belter this is not due to
limited interest, but to limited
facilities." This problem should
be largely eliminated with th e
planned construction of a 2mil
lion dollar pavilion sometime next
year. When completed, the pavil
ion will seat upwards ol' 8,000
people and will house vastly im
proved and expanded P.E. and
intramural programs.
Taylor predicts that the next
10 years should bring "a con
tinuous long-range prog ra m
which will include a greater inter
est in "newer" sports like crew,
soccer, and wrestling.
The last ten years in the Stan
ford Athletic Department have
been ones of ups and downs. On
the national level, while Stanford
; has not been national champion
I in any sport, Indian teams have
; finished second in the nation
three times.
Golf and tennis were nalional
runners-up in 1957 and 1958 re
spectively. The Stanford track
team, led by captain and field
event champion Dave Weill, was
second in the NCAA track meet
in 1963.
A 10-YEAR survey shows golf,
swimming, and rugby leading all
sports in won-lost percentage.
Swimming and rugby have never
had losing seasons at Stanford.
Since 1955 the golf team has com
piled a 100-20-1 record and since
1958 there have been 8 All-Ameri
i can golfers at Stanford. There
has been at least one All-Ameri
can in golf each year since 1958.
The lowest percentages belong
I to the gymnastics and football
teams. Their records are .226 and
.375. However, it should be noted
that for all 14 sports in w hi c h
