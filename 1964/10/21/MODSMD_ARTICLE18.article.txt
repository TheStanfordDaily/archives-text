# Tribe Rooters Beaten Again By Bears, 2-1
## 
### ADRIAN ALMQUIST 
The Cnl soccer team dealt Stan
ford its second loss yesterday
afternoon, winning by a score of
2-1. The score was tied until early
in the fourth period when Cal
scored on a penalty kick to go
ahead. 2-1. Both teams were very
evenly matched and neither could
mount much of an offensive.
Cal scored first midway through
the first quarter when a Stan
ford player accidentally headed
in a corner kick by Cal's Duffy.
Cal's lead didn't last long though,
as Malcolm Taylor of Stanford
tied the game a few minutes later
with a high, long shot from 35
yards out.
THK SECOND and third quar
ters ended with the score still
deadlocked at 1-1.
Early in the fourth quarter Cal
received the big break of the
game when they were awarded a
penalty kick. Weisenburger had
no trouble putting the ball by

Stanford's substitute goalie, and
Cal took a 2-1 yead. For the re
mainder of the game Stanford
fought desperately to catch Cal,
but several erratic passes hurt
their chances.
