## Season Outlook: Things Look Grim 
### Pete king 
Half of Stanford's 1964 footb;Â» 11 season is gone, and it doesn't
: make very good reading: Won 2, Lost 3; Standing in AAWU Con
| ference: dead last. But even this poor record may seem outstand
| ing when compared wilh what lies ahead.
Right now Stanford is in the position of a New York Mots pitcher
who must face Willie Mays, Harmon Killibrew, Roger Maris, Hank
Aaron, and Mickey Mantle in succession.
Not thai there isn't hope. Coach John Ralston has a team with
fine potential, and ho is optimistic about his last five games. Only
the failure of the defense and offense to work at the same time has
prevented a 5-0 record.
NO MORE PATSIES
Trouble is, there are no more San Jose States or Washington
States on the schedule. The resl of the teams have TALENT. In the
next three weeks, the Indians face the number two-ranked team,
a team that once was ranked that high, and an unbeaten Coast
eleven. In short, things look grim.
The opponent this week is Notre Dame, which has absolutely
murdered four teams by 31-7, 34-15, 34-7, and 24-0 scores. The victims
haven't exactly been in the pushover league; they are Wisconsin.
Purdue, Air Force, and UCLA. UCLA, by the way, beat Stanford.
With quarterback John Huarte leading ihe way, the Irish have
completed 13 of 80 passes for an average of 180 yards a game. Touch
downs have come on passes of 12. 37. and 61 yards. The Irish have
thrown in scoring runs of 40 and 57 yards for good measure.
HALLOWEEN COULD BE ROUGH
Halloween looks dismal this year, since on that day Stanford
plays undefeated Oregon up in Portland, no less, where the Tribe'
hasn't won in over 10 years. The Ducks boast a potential All-Ameri
can in quarterback Bob Berry, who so far has accounted for 949
yards total offense and has thrown 12 yes, 12 touchdown passes.
The Cards' pass defense has mot only one good quarterback this
season. That was UCLA's Larry Zono, and it was because of Zeno
that UCLA beat Stanford, 27-20.
Alter those two "breathers," Stanford comes home for a little
more conference action against those perennial softies, the US<
Trojans. USC has lost two of five games, but only to powerful Bin
Ten teams. The Trojans have an on-and-oi'f offense, but when it's
e ~ nobody stops it. As it it matters, they also have one <>l the Coast's
nest defenses. Rose Bowl honors should go to Oregon or US<
Next comes Oregon State, a loam with nothing but an unyielding
defense. The Beavers are 4-1, and no team has scored more than
seven points on them yet, including Northwestern, Washington, and
Baylor. Sianford should bo able to win, with a good effort. Bui
long-time Indian rooters know that the game before Big Game has
consistently been one of the season's worst.
CAL LINE LIKE CARDBOARD
Lastly, there's Cal. The Bear line gives up yards liko wet card
board, so the country's leading rusher, Stanford's Ray Handley, con
ceivably could gain 200 yards. But Cal's pass attack is really some
thing to see. Quarterback Craig Morton is averaging nearly 200 j
air yards per game, a lot of those on long bombs. This will be the j
one game where the Tribe will definitely have a chance to win, but [
mistakes such as the eight fumbles lost in the last two games could j
kill the Big Rod.
Maybe the optimism of the coaches is justified. But viewing the
lost of the season through eyes that have witnessed many a come
from-behind Stanford loss, 1 can only say: rots of ruck.
