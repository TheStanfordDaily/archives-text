Herbert Homer, one ot this centurx s
towering \niericiins and Stanford's great
\ est alumnus, is dead.
()nl\ rare!) in the course ol history
have men given so much ol themselves so
tirelcssl) and toward such worth) ends as
did Herbert Hoover.
A man ol stupendous intellect, amaz
ing stamina, dri\ing energy, and profound
courage, Hoover left a deep mark of in
comparable achievement on all with which
lie. in his nine decades of public service,
came in contact.
It is no exaggeration to say that with
out Hoovers assistance Stanford today
would be but a shadow of the great univer
sity it is.
Prom 1894, w hen he became the first
student financial manager, until 1961, when
he was elected Emeritus Trustee after 49
years on the Board of Trustees, Hoover was
a constant source of ideas and programs
for tli' improvement of the I niversitv.
Hut his great help to Stanford is, remark
ably. t!ii • ol his lesser accomplishments.
Hoover r-sc to the vcr\ top of the engi
neering field b\ the time he wis 35, saved
millions from starvation during and after
World War I through his administration of
relief to the victims of the German armies,
anil achieved the highest honor his country
could l>'.stew upon him when lie was
elected i readeut b\ a majorit) of over
o.(K)(),()()0.
Hut the depression which he worked so
hard to prevent threw him from the pin
nacle of world acclaim for his humanitarian
ism ::to th;' depths ol derision and despair
ft r creating the o\crdue economic disaster
of 1929.
Subsequent stud) of his role in those
crucial years, his post-World War II work
in European reliel and in the reorganiza
tion of the Federal government, and the

r
man) honors which he has received in the
past two decades have served to reverse
the incomparably harsh judgment rendered
on him during the depression years.
It is difficult for contemporaries to judge
the ultimate merits ol the outstanding men
of their times, and the term "great man" is
bandied about far too freely. Administra
tive ability and hard work are by them
selves not enough to qualify a man for that
distinction.
Hut Hoover was more than an achiever.
As Eugene Lyons w rites in his recentl) pub
lished Hoover biography, "Herbert Hoover
has been the nation's most consistent, forth
right, and inspiring champion of what used
to be called the American way of life."
Hoover, more than any other President
of this century, approached in his personal
philosophy a rare balance in judging the
relative importance of the often conflicting
goals of individual freedom and individual
welfare and security.
W liili' he opposed unnecessan govern
mental intrusion in private affairs, he recog
nized that such intrusion was indeed some
times necessary. While he stood for the
preservation of the free enterprise system,
it was only for the sake of enhancing the
dignity and independence ol the individual.
While he was dedicated to individual in
itiative, and to the concept of the self-made
man, he spent his life helping the poor and
the destitute.
"Without planning it, writes Lyons, "by
mere!) acting as his mind and conscience
dictated, in disregard of prevailing social
pretensions and intellectual fashions, he
be came the spokesman and a living symbol
of vital and enduring truths."
Surely these are the credentials ot a
great man. We can express only our deep
est sorrow at his passing.
