# Padding The ASSU Budget?
## 
### 
Hear Sir:
Recently all uf the treasurers,
of ASS IT Organizations received
a memorandum from Bill Stone
of the Student Financial Man
ager's Office.
"The University receives $470
per student pei quarter and gives ,
! per cent of (his income to the
ASSU. . . . Mo.-1 ASSIJ Org'.miza- !
lions were not completely satis
lied with the authorizations which
they were given in the 1964-65
master budget. . . .The CniversitA
will raise quarterly tuition to
$500 next fall. The Student Fi
naicial Manager's Office hope
to use this action as a basis
for an increase in student fees
allocated to the ASSU. But we
have to build an extremely goo 1

argument if we are to be success-.
ful. We are in competition with ;
many worthwhile outlets for new I
income: library expansion, in-!
creasc in faculty salaries, and the ,
like."
WH < ONSEDER it inexcusable I
t hat the Un iv e r si t y has |
apparently informed the ASSU ;
St u d en t Financial Manager's j
Office of a raise in tuition before j
lot ilyiMg t'ie student body offi- 1
cially.
MY MAIN' objection is to what
I interpie: as Mr. Stone's unethi
cal and rather blatant insinuation
that ASSU Organizations should
pad their budgets merely to give
the ASSU more leverage in their
dealings with the Administration.
1 in no way mean to imply thai

these organizations pad their
budget now or will do so in the
future. On the contrary, I hope
this letter will stand as evidence
that ASSU Organizations are un
willing to do this.
I in no way object to increased
funds for the ASSU so thai they
may meet rising costs and plan
for the future; my objection is
to the implications in Ihe memo.
Besides, I feel that ASSU money
should under no circumstances
be taken from the pockets of
teachers nor from the shelves of
the library: but rather that Ihe
increase of one should be treated
exclusive from the increase of the
other.

naicial Manager's Office hope
to use this action as a basis
for an increase in student fees
allocated to the ASSU. But we
have to build an extremely goo 1

argument if we are to be success-.
ful. We are in competition with ;
many worthwhile outlets for new I
income: library expansion, in-!
creasc in faculty salaries, and the ,
like."
WH < ONSEDER it inexcusable I
t hat the Un iv e r si t y has |
apparently informed the ASSU ;
St u d en t Financial Manager's j
Office of a raise in tuition before j
lot ilyiMg t'ie student body offi- 1
cially.
MY MAIN' objection is to what
I interpie: as Mr. Stone's unethi
cal and rather blatant insinuation
that ASSU Organizations should
pad their budgets merely to give
the ASSU more leverage in their
dealings with the Administration.
1 in no way mean to imply thai

these organizations pad their
budget now or will do so in the
future. On the contrary, I hope
this letter will stand as evidence
that ASSU Organizations are un
willing to do this.
I in no way object to increased
funds for the ASSU so thai they
may meet rising costs and plan
for the future; my objection is
to the implications in Ihe memo.
Besides, I feel that ASSU money
should under no circumstances
be taken from the pockets of
teachers nor from the shelves of
the library: but rather that Ihe
increase of one should be treated
exclusive from the increase of the
other.
