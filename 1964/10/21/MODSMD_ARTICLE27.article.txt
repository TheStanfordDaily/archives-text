# ARIZONA REPORT
## 'Conservatism In Action': Corruption, Economic Lag 
### BARRY AMES (First of Two Articles) 
\\ hen voters ask if (.'onsen ative government can reall\ work.
Senator Harry Goldwater often rc*]>lit s by using his home state
ol \rizona as an example.
Here, he says, Conservative Government is an unqualified suc
cess. Implying that the Conservative Way in Arizona can he trans-

ferred to the country as a whole,•<
lie calls Paul Fannin "the best j
Governor Arizona ever had."
Arizona government is unques
tionably Conservative. Governor \
Fannin has been in office since
1958. By 1963 all 392 appointive l
positions in the State government
were Fannin appointees. The At
torney-General, the Phoenix-area
Congressman, the .junior Senator;
all are staunch conservatives.
Senator Goldwater is quite cor-j
rect when he points to Arizona
":s an example of Conservatism
in action.
The success of this Conserva
tism is not quite as simple to
establish. !l might be informative,
therefore. to examine various;
areas vv-> <> Conservatism pro
vides an 'il ernative approach.
t"c ■!';!! Relations
Arizon relations with the
v eder.d Government are a study
■il cj;Viras:s. Her leaders all ex
press hostility to Federal pro
grams; but while piously pro
claiming their devotion to state's'
rights, they gladly accept Federal
funds to build flams, missiles, and
highways, and to help politically
powerful farmers and ranchers.
Federal expenditures in the,
state are fifteen percent higher
than Federal tax receipts. This is j
higher than any other State in j
the Rocky Mountain area.
The Legislature has, however, j
refused to approve acceptance of
funds for high schools under
Title 111 of the NDEA. Arizona
has forfeited about one million
dollars in the past six years, most
of which has apparently gone to j
California.
Last May the Office of Educa-j
tion decided that the State Legis
lature did not have to approve
the funds. Arizona's school boards
do not seem to share the Legisla-i
lure's fear of Federal control, for
they are now asking for their;
share of the aid.
Senator Goldwater's attitude j
toward public power projects is I
similarly ambivalent. He de- j
nounces TVA as creeping social-
Ism. but he is a strong supporter
of the Federally-financed Central
Arizona Project. The Senator sees
no inconsistency in his support
of the $1.1 billion CAP.
The TVA is the largest single
taxpayer in the State of Tennes
see. while the CAP would pay no
taxes to anyone. Some may find
it amusing that the Senator's own
home is served by public power.
The electrically-operated flagpole.;
the ham radio, the Hi-Fi; all are
served by the Salt River Project
—at rates 15 per cent lower than
comparable private rates.

"Dynamic" Arizona
Senator Goldwater says that
the government should leave the!
economy alone. Here, again, he
points to "dynamic" Arizona. In
the post-war boom, Arizona grew
rapidly, but now the boom is gone. j
This year, for the first time in
thirty years, Arizona's unemploy
ment rate is higher than the na
tional average. Three out of every |
four newcomers into the State
must leave because they cannot 1
find jobs. Arizona's business fail
lire rate is twice the Mountain
State average.
These things may not be the
fault of the State Government,
but clearly it has refused to try
to solve our economic problems.
In the last four years virtually!
no new industry has come into i
the state. Financial assistance is >
offered to new industry by forty
five stales; Arizona offers!
nothing.
55i«li Crime Kate
One of the major issues in the
campaign has been crime. Some I
Goldwater people will admit that
this issue is merely a subtle way!
of exploiting backlash, but the j
thought that Senator Barry Gold-j
water would do anything that;
smacks of political manipulation i
seems akin to questioning the!
parentage of Jesus.
Is there really any validity to I
this issue?
The latest FBI Crime Report I
shows that among the states, Ari- i
zona has the third highest crime!
rate in the nation. Phoenix ranks i
fourth and Tucson nineteenth i
among all cities. Phoenix had a!
far higher crime rate than Wash-i
ington, D.C., a city that is 54 perl
cent Negro, and a crime rate four
times as high as riot-torn Roches
ter.
Even the moral aspects of Con-'
servative Government seem tar
nished. The Highway Department
headed by a Fannin appointee, has
been investigated by the House
Committee on Public Works. The
Committee charged 'gross irregu
larities." A Phoenix newspaper
showed pictures of roads conveni
ently routed around a farm
owned by the Highway Commis
sioner.
The poinl of all this is simple.
Conservatives argue that Conser
vative Government can bring a
now moral tone to politics. Ari
zona demonstrates the failure of
this doctrine. The State is rid
dled with crime and corruption
among men of both parties. Con
servatism in Arizona is hardly
without sin.

Arizon relations with the
v eder.d Government are a study
■il cj;Viras:s. Her leaders all ex
press hostility to Federal pro
grams; but while piously pro
claiming their devotion to state's'
rights, they gladly accept Federal
funds to build flams, missiles, and
highways, and to help politically
powerful farmers and ranchers.
Federal expenditures in the,
state are fifteen percent higher
than Federal tax receipts. This is j
higher than any other State in j
the Rocky Mountain area.
The Legislature has, however, j
refused to approve acceptance of
funds for high schools under
Title 111 of the NDEA. Arizona
has forfeited about one million
dollars in the past six years, most
of which has apparently gone to j
California.
Last May the Office of Educa-j
tion decided that the State Legis
lature did not have to approve
the funds. Arizona's school boards
do not seem to share the Legisla-i
lure's fear of Federal control, for
they are now asking for their;
share of the aid.
Senator Goldwater's attitude j
toward public power projects is I
similarly ambivalent. He de- j
nounces TVA as creeping social-
Ism. but he is a strong supporter
of the Federally-financed Central
Arizona Project. The Senator sees
no inconsistency in his support
of the $1.1 billion CAP.
The TVA is the largest single
taxpayer in the State of Tennes
see. while the CAP would pay no
taxes to anyone. Some may find
it amusing that the Senator's own
home is served by public power.

"Dynamic" Arizona
Senator Goldwater says that
the government should leave the!
economy alone. Here, again, he
points to "dynamic" Arizona. In
the post-war boom, Arizona grew
rapidly, but now the boom is gone. j
This year, for the first time in
thirty years, Arizona's unemploy
ment rate is higher than the na
tional average. Three out of every |
four newcomers into the State
must leave because they cannot 1
find jobs. Arizona's business fail
lire rate is twice the Mountain
State average.
These things may not be the
fault of the State Government,
but clearly it has refused to try
to solve our economic problems.

no new industry has come into i

Arizona government is unques
tionably Conservative. Governor \
Fannin has been in office since
1958. By 1963 all 392 appointive l
positions in the State government
were Fannin appointees. The At
torney-General, the Phoenix-area
Congressman, the .junior Senator;
all are staunch conservatives.
Senator Goldwater is quite cor-j
rect when he points to Arizona
":s an example of Conservatism
in action.

t"c ■!';!! Relations
Arizon relations with the
v eder.d Government are a study
■il cj;Viras:s. Her leaders all ex
press hostility to Federal pro
grams; but while piously pro
claiming their devotion to state's'
rights, they gladly accept Federal
funds to build flams, missiles, and
highways, and to help politically
powerful farmers and ranchers.
Federal expenditures in the,
state are fifteen percent higher
than Federal tax receipts. This is j
higher than any other State in j
the Rocky Mountain area.
The Legislature has, however, j
refused to approve acceptance of
funds for high schools under
Title 111 of the NDEA. Arizona
has forfeited about one million
dollars in the past six years, most
of which has apparently gone to j
California.
Last May the Office of Educa-j
tion decided that the State Legis
lature did not have to approve
the funds. Arizona's school boards
do not seem to share the Legisla-i
lure's fear of Federal control, for
they are now asking for their;
share of the aid.
Senator Goldwater's attitude j
toward public power projects is I
similarly ambivalent. He de- j
nounces TVA as creeping social-
Ism. but he is a strong supporter
of the Federally-financed Central
Arizona Project. The Senator sees
no inconsistency in his support
of the $1.1 billion CAP.
The TVA is the largest single
taxpayer in the State of Tennes
see. while the CAP would pay no
taxes to anyone. Some may find
it amusing that the Senator's own
home is served by public power.
The electrically-operated flagpole.;
the ham radio, the Hi-Fi; all are
served by the Salt River Project
—at rates 15 per cent lower than
comparable private rates.

"Dynamic" Arizona
Senator Goldwater says that
the government should leave the!
economy alone. Here, again, he
points to "dynamic" Arizona. In
the post-war boom, Arizona grew
rapidly, but now the boom is gone. j
This year, for the first time in
thirty years, Arizona's unemploy
ment rate is higher than the na
tional average. Three out of every |
four newcomers into the State
must leave because they cannot 1
find jobs. Arizona's business fail
lire rate is twice the Mountain
State average.
These things may not be the
fault of the State Government,
but clearly it has refused to try
to solve our economic problems.
In the last four years virtually!
no new industry has come into i
the state. Financial assistance is >
offered to new industry by forty
five stales; Arizona offers!
nothing.
55i«li Crime Kate
One of the major issues in the
campaign has been crime. Some I
Goldwater people will admit that
this issue is merely a subtle way!
of exploiting backlash, but the j
thought that Senator Barry Gold-j
water would do anything that;
smacks of political manipulation i
seems akin to questioning the!
parentage of Jesus.
Is there really any validity to I
this issue?
The latest FBI Crime Report I
shows that among the states, Ari- i
zona has the third highest crime!
rate in the nation. Phoenix ranks i
fourth and Tucson nineteenth i
among all cities. Phoenix had a!
far higher crime rate than Wash-i
ington, D.C., a city that is 54 perl
cent Negro, and a crime rate four
times as high as riot-torn Roches
ter.
Even the moral aspects of Con-'
servative Government seem tar
nished. The Highway Department
headed by a Fannin appointee, has
been investigated by the House
Committee on Public Works. The
Committee charged 'gross irregu
larities." A Phoenix newspaper
showed pictures of roads conveni
ently routed around a farm
owned by the Highway Commis
sioner.
