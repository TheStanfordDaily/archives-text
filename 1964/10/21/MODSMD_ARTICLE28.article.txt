## 'Nothing But The Best': An Incredibly Funny Picture 
### JOHN THAYER 
I o those who contend that hmjjand s last great coittril>iitioii
In the American scene was the surrender ol (oinwallis at York
town, A ofli Hut I lie Best offers irrefutable proof to the con
trary. It's an exuberantly mad burlesque of England's oft-satirized
Establishment, which, instead of kicking tin- dead horse, revives

him so that tic can make a fooM
of himself all over again.
The fun begins with the plot.
Frederic Raphael has concocted 1
an utterly incredible, absurdly
funny story about one James j
ijicwstev's attempts to become a
vice-president of Horton, Ltd.,
London Realtors.
Actually, what he really wants I
are the Rolls, the town house, and
all the other little goodies that
go with being a vice-president. 1
Anyway, the only disadvantage in
being where he begins, which is
at the bottom, is that it's so very
far down.
Realizing very quickly that his
little stratagems are not getting
him anywhere, he decides to in
augurate a crash-plan whose mot
to is "Someday, he (or shot has
got to go." He first acquires
Charles Prince, a cynical, unem
ployed, and inebriated member oi
the aristocracy, whose clothes lie
borrows and whose brain he picks
so that he may acquire the out
ward signs of that inward grace
known as breeding.
Brewster's next step is to eti
ticc Ann Horton, the president's
daughter, away from her fiance,
a total incompetent but neverthe
less a peer of the realm. By pre
tending to know everyone when
in reality he knows no one (thus
eventually meeting and impress
ing them all>, and through some
remarkably shrewd business
maneuvers, he succeeds not only
in discrediting Ann's fiance but
also in catching the eye of Horton
himself. Ann he has already
snared, because, as she says, he
is handsome, intelligent, ambiti
ous, and utterly immoral.
It would be unfair to reveal
what happens next; suffice it to
say that unfortunate complica
tions arise, only to be countered
by some unbelievable good for
tune, all of which culminate in a
perfect ending.

Clive Donner has chosen an
impeccable group of locations, all
of which he uses to full advan
tage. His camera direction sets
both them and the action off
beautifully. Lven the smallest de
tail is so perfectly conceived and
carried out that it miniatures the
picture as a whole. And he di
rects it all with a controlled non
chalance that complements both
the script and Alan Bates' per
formance.
For Alan Bates looks and plays
James Brewster flawlessly. Willi
his tousled hair, great sad eyes,
and that hopelessly captivating
smile, he strolls up the stairway
of success radiating a buoyant
confidence and a boundless optim
ism that is irresistible.

I o those who contend that hmjjand s last great coittril>iitioii
In the American scene was the surrender ol (oinwallis at York
town, A ofli Hut I lie Best offers irrefutable proof to the con
trary. It's an exuberantly mad burlesque of England's oft-satirized
Establishment, which, instead of kicking tin- dead horse, revives

him so that tic can make a fooM
of himself all over again.
The fun begins with the plot.
Frederic Raphael has concocted 1
an utterly incredible, absurdly
funny story about one James j
ijicwstev's attempts to become a
vice-president of Horton, Ltd.,
London Realtors.
Actually, what he really wants I
are the Rolls, the town house, and
all the other little goodies that
go with being a vice-president. 1
Anyway, the only disadvantage in
being where he begins, which is
at the bottom, is that it's so very
far down.
Realizing very quickly that his
little stratagems are not getting
him anywhere, he decides to in
augurate a crash-plan whose mot
to is "Someday, he (or shot has
got to go." He first acquires
Charles Prince, a cynical, unem
ployed, and inebriated member oi
the aristocracy, whose clothes lie
borrows and whose brain he picks
so that he may acquire the out
ward signs of that inward grace
known as breeding.
Brewster's next step is to eti
ticc Ann Horton, the president's
daughter, away from her fiance,
a total incompetent but neverthe
less a peer of the realm. By pre
tending to know everyone when
in reality he knows no one (thus
eventually meeting and impress
ing them all>, and through some
remarkably shrewd business
maneuvers, he succeeds not only
in discrediting Ann's fiance but
also in catching the eye of Horton
himself. Ann he has already
snared, because, as she says, he
is handsome, intelligent, ambiti
ous, and utterly immoral.
It would be unfair to reveal
what happens next; suffice it to
say that unfortunate complica
tions arise, only to be countered
by some unbelievable good for
tune, all of which culminate in a
perfect ending.

Clive Donner has chosen an
impeccable group of locations, all
of which he uses to full advan
tage. His camera direction sets
both them and the action off
beautifully. Lven the smallest de
tail is so perfectly conceived and
carried out that it miniatures the
picture as a whole. And he di
rects it all with a controlled non
chalance that complements both
the script and Alan Bates' per
formance.
For Alan Bates looks and plays
James Brewster flawlessly. Willi
his tousled hair, great sad eyes,
and that hopelessly captivating
smile, he strolls up the stairway
of success radiating a buoyant
confidence and a boundless optim
ism that is irresistible.
