# Hoover's Days With Stanford
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover's lifetime has
spanned the entire history of
Stanford University.
A member of Stanford's first
freshman class in 1891, Hoover
has served more than a half cen
tury on the University's Board of
Trustees. No other American
President has been more deeply

involved in the development of
a single academic institution for
so long a time.
MOST KNOW V ;it Stanford for
establishing the Hoover Institu
tion on War, Revolution, and
Peace, the former president was
also instrumental in planning
the University's first Student
Union, organizing the Food Re

search Institute and establishing
the Graduate School of Business.
All four organizations are thriv
ing today.
As a student, Hoover helped
arrange the first football contest
with the University of California.
Nearly 20,000 spectators saw
Stanford win ihe now traditional
j "Big Game," 14-10, on March 19,
1802 in San Francisco.
Hoover recalls this first game
! in his Memoirs. "We had seals
j for a total of 1 ."5,000 fans . . .
! and printed seat-numbered tickets
for only 10,000.
"THE ATTENDANCE piled up
j to nearly 20,000. We had no such
supply of tickets. So we set up
; an alley of our college boys from
: ihe box offices to the gates and
sold tickeis for cash the pur
chasers being carefully watched
so that no outsiders crowded
in. . . .
At that time few hills were
used in California. We dealt in
silver and gold. The cash piled
up to the extent that it spilled
on the floors; we had to rent ;i
wash boiler and a dishpan from
nearby householders for the price
of a free ticket.
"While these difficulties were
being solved, the captains of ihe
two teams turned up, demanding
to know where the football was.
We had overlooked that del ail and

had to delay the game lor a half
hour while we sent downtown for
two pigskins. 1 did not see the
game, but 10 our astonishment
we won."
NOT ONLY did this victory
give the brand-new university an
immense psychological lift, but
Hoover's management of t h e
tickets helped put athletics at
Stanford on a sound financial
footing.
Hoover also erased a $1,200 defi
cit and put student government
back in the black seven months
after his election as treasurer of
the Associated Students in 1981.
An orphan, Hoover came to
Stanford with a personal finan
cial backlog of $750. lie organized
a laundry service, newspaper
route and lecture agency to pay
part of his expenses. He also
worked summers and held part
time office jobs at the University.
HOOVKK (JHAIH ATICI) with
a bachelor's degree in geology in
198.1. "I came out with $40 in my
pockel and no debts," he once re
called.
The day before commencement,
i the University registrar discov
| ered Hoover had not properly
; passed the entrance examination
: in English. But "kindly and un
j derstanding professors persuaded
him (the registrar) to relax,"
I Hoover said. "Can any of you

wonder at my devotion to Stan
ford, with its Founders and its
traditions for its unending kind
ness?"
"Because of tho kindness of its
professors and duo 10 the fact
that at that time Stanford
charged no tuition, and been use
of my own right arm, i was able
to earn my way and get my de
gree,"' Hoover said. "I have had
many degrees conferred on me
since, but this was tho only one
I really earned."
OF MIS ACADKMIC work,
Hoover has said he was able "to
carry an unusual amount for
engineers of instruction in his
tory, economics and English and
French literature. ... As 1 recol
lect it, I failed in only one course
German. I do not recollect, how
ever, that I ever attained "A"
grades in any of them. I had too
many other yens and occupations
in non-curricular activities."
In 1912 Hoover became the first
alumnus elected to the Board of
Trustees. The following year.
University President David Starr
Jordan wrote: "It is marvelous
how Hoover is handling our
Board. Almost every reform we
ever dreamed of has slipped
through as if oiled."
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford's
third president, said of Hoover:
"No man ever inspired more in

tense loyalty or a finer sense of
teamwork among his co-workers
. . . he has been a constant inspir
ation to us all."
l!OOYI\K'S STRONG interest
in financial matters led to the
firsi full statement of the Univer
sity's resources and liabilities, in
come and expenditures, ever given
to ihe irustees and the public.
More recently. Hoover was
named honorary chairman of ihe
University's PACE program, a
■Slot) million building project.
In 1928, Hoover accepted the
Republican nomination for presi
dent in a speech at Stanford Sta
dium. On November 6 of that
year, he listened to the election
returns at his <impus home, now
the residence of ' niversity Presi

A member of Stanford's first
freshman class in 1891, Hoover
has served more than a half cen
tury on the University's Board of

President has been more deeply

involved in the development of
a single academic institution for
so long a time.

As a student, Hoover helped
arrange the first football contest
with the University of California.
Nearly 20,000 spectators saw
Stanford win ihe now traditional
j "Big Game," 14-10, on March 19,
1802 in San Francisco.
Hoover recalls this first game
! in his Memoirs. "We had seals
j for a total of 1 ."5,000 fans . . .
! and printed seat-numbered tickets
for only 10,000.
"THE ATTENDANCE piled up
j to nearly 20,000. We had no such
supply of tickets. So we set up
; an alley of our college boys from
: ihe box offices to the gates and
sold tickeis for cash the pur
chasers being carefully watched
so that no outsiders crowded
in. . . .
At that time few hills were
used in California. We dealt in
silver and gold. The cash piled
up to the extent that it spilled
on the floors; we had to rent ;i
wash boiler and a dishpan from
nearby householders for the price
of a free ticket.
"While these difficulties were
being solved, the captains of ihe
two teams turned up, demanding
to know where the football was.
We had overlooked that del ail and

had to delay the game lor a half
hour while we sent downtown for
two pigskins. 1 did not see the
game, but 10 our astonishment
we won."
NOT ONLY did this victory
give the brand-new university an
immense psychological lift, but
Hoover's management of t h e
tickets helped put athletics at
Stanford on a sound financial
footing.
Hoover also erased a $1,200 defi
cit and put student government
back in the black seven months
after his election as treasurer of
the Associated Students in 1981.
An orphan, Hoover came to
Stanford with a personal finan
