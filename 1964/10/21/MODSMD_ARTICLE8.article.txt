"If thirty to forty per cent of the Americans knew how the
Communist Conspiracy worked in America, it would begin to de
cline as a force in our society,' according to John 11. Rousselot,
National Director of Public Relations for the John Birch So
ciety, who spoke here last night.

Speaking before the law forum,
the former Congressman pr e
sented Iho principles and pro
grams of the conservative society.
The principles were to combat

more effectively the forces of col
jlectivism in America, to pull our
society out of a deepening morass
of collectivism toward greater in
dividual freedom and responsi
bility, and to create a faith-in
spired morality dedicated to the
aspirations upon which our gov
ernment was founded.
Rousselot saw the defeat of the
Communist conspiracy as the
greatest problem faced. Noting
ten methods the society was
using, he stressed the educational
purpose of all Ihe efforts.
I In the question period that
followed, he quickly emphasized:
"We aren't opposed to just Com
mit nists."
CHIEF JUSTICE Earl Warren
is not a Communist, claimed
Rousselot; however "sending him
to the bench was like sending a
gardener to do brain surgery."
To illustrate his point, the
spokesman for ihe John Birch So
ciety showed the "Impeach Earl
Warren Packet," a collection of
pamphlets on how the Chief Jus
tice has gone beyond his legal
jurisdiction.
