Our editorial eye lights this month on paperbacks
that are frankly, unabashedly timely. The first
provocative case in point is The Radical Right
(Anchor, $1.45), a symposium which draws on
the talents of nine distinguished sociologists and
political scientists, including David Riesman,
Peter Viereck, Seymour M. Lipset, and the book's
editor, Daniel Bell. Contributors comment specif
ically and significantly on the perennial recur
rence of extreme rightist movements in America;
the radical right in '60s politics; the revolt against
the elite; climates of tolerance and intolerance in
England and America; and, inevitably, the John
Birch Society. It's an objective, incisive study —
and eminently worthwhile.
Equally timely, is Paul Bohannan's Africa AND
Africans (Natural History Press, $1.25). Pains
takingly separating myth from fact, Professor
Bohannan (of Northwestern's anthropology
department) surveys colonialism and the slave
trade; tribes and families; markets, politics,
courts, religions, and arts; and the nature of
Africa's new nationalism and neutrality. Most
reviewers have agreed with the N. Y. Times Book
Review critic, who cited this as "perhaps the best
short general book on Africa."
We suspect that folk and freedom songs will out
last even the ever-present "Hootenany." A hun
dred convincing reasons for this have now been
collected by Edith Fowke and Joe Glazer in Songs
of Work and Freedom. (Dolphin, $1.95). This
oversize, but perfectly portable paperback pro
vides words, music, history and guitar chords for
100 songs of social protest from'The Cutty Wren"
(England, 1381) to "We Will Overcome" (U.S.A.,
'64)...fr0m standbys like "Casey Jones" and
"Drill, Ye Tarriers, Drill" to "My Sweetheart's
the Mule in the Mines." It's an amazingly com
plete, irresistible collection.
The three books reviewed above, are published by
the sponsors of this column, Doubleday Anchor
Hooks, 277 Park Avenue, New York City, and The,
Natural History Press, Garden City, Neiv York.
You'll find them all at one of the best equipped
I booksellers in the country — your own college, store.

Our editorial eye lights this month on paperbacks
that are frankly, unabashedly timely. The first
provocative case in point is The Radical Right
(Anchor, $1.45), a symposium which draws on
the talents of nine distinguished sociologists and
political scientists, including David Riesman,
Peter Viereck, Seymour M. Lipset, and the book's
editor, Daniel Bell. Contributors comment specif
ically and significantly on the perennial recur
rence of extreme rightist movements in America;
the radical right in '60s politics; the revolt against
the elite; climates of tolerance and intolerance in
England and America; and, inevitably, the John
Birch Society. It's an objective, incisive study —
and eminently worthwhile.
Equally timely, is Paul Bohannan's Africa AND
Africans (Natural History Press, $1.25). Pains
takingly separating myth from fact, Professor
Bohannan (of Northwestern's anthropology
department) surveys colonialism and the slave
trade; tribes and families; markets, politics,
courts, religions, and arts; and the nature of
Africa's new nationalism and neutrality. Most
reviewers have agreed with the N. Y. Times Book
Review critic, who cited this as "perhaps the best
short general book on Africa."
We suspect that folk and freedom songs will out
last even the ever-present "Hootenany." A hun
dred convincing reasons for this have now been
collected by Edith Fowke and Joe Glazer in Songs
of Work and Freedom. (Dolphin, $1.95). This
oversize, but perfectly portable paperback pro
vides words, music, history and guitar chords for
100 songs of social protest from'The Cutty Wren"
(England, 1381) to "We Will Overcome" (U.S.A.,
'64)...fr0m standbys like "Casey Jones" and
"Drill, Ye Tarriers, Drill" to "My Sweetheart's
the Mule in the Mines." It's an amazingly com
plete, irresistible collection.
The three books reviewed above, are published by
the sponsors of this column, Doubleday Anchor
Hooks, 277 Park Avenue, New York City, and The,
Natural History Press, Garden City, Neiv York.
You'll find them all at one of the best equipped
I booksellers in the country — your own college, store.
