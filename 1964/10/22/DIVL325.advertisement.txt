ihe slopes. College men who collect sweaters— ,
and many do—are adding these to iheir collec
tions and they have a definite preference for
those made in Italy to our exacting University
Shop specifications. All are hand embroidered,
hand finished and in a weight not just for ihe
sport itself. They come in a variety of gusty color
ings and are priced from 20.00. You will find
them in our University Shops across ihe country.
