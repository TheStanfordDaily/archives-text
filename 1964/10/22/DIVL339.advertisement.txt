You're the epitome of wisdom
when you choose these long-j
and-lean pants. They trim you i
up and taper you down. Post-1
Grads are the sine qua non j
of campus styles because I
they're absolutely authentic.!
j Neat belt loops. Narrow-but
not-too-narrow cuffs. Shaped |
on-seam pockets. You can !
look perfect for a pittance
since they cost but $6.98 a
pair in 65% Dacron* 35%
Cotton. Buy 'em and woooo!
