• Harry Rafts Foreign Policy
WASHINGTON — Sen. Barry Goldwater
said last night the Johnson administration
has created a grave threat to national secur
ity by helping to rebuild a once-divided and
economically strained Communist world.
He called for a bold new policy of con
frontation, based on rebuilt alliances, strength
and resolution, and full recognition that "com
munism is our enemy."
Goldwater, replying to President Johnson's
address to the nation Sunday, spoke in a na
tionwide telecast — ABC—9:3O p.m. EST
keyed to the fall of Soviet Premier Khru
shchev and Red China's explosion of its first
nuclear device.

• Unrest Grows Over K Ouster
BERLIN Unrest is spreading in East
European Communist party ranks over the
ou;tter of Nikita Khrushchev, and in East Ger
many party meetings were reported yesterday
to have been disrupted by unruly demonstra
tions.
Communist organizations rarely admit
their views are anything but unanimous.
Information Bureau West, an unofficial
Western intelligence agency, said its East Ger
man sources reported visible unrest over last
Thursday's fall of Khrushchev among th e
middle and lower ranks of the Communist
party.
Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the Polish,
Hungarian and Czechoslovak parties have

openly praised Khrushchev.
• New Viet Government To Form
SAIGON — The ruling military triumvi
rate decreed last night that South Viet Nam's
promised civilian government must be formed
before next Tuesday.
Maj. Gen. Nguyen Khanh, the caretaker
premier, and his partners in the triumvirate
held to the deadline Khanh established after
widespread rioting in late summer by Budd
hist and student critics of the Khanh admin
istration.
The order was directed to the High Na
tional Council, a 17-man agency named last
month to steer this Communist-plagued nation
from military to civilian control.

• Costa Nostra Boss Kidna/j/jed
NEW YORK — Two men in dark clothing
reportedly overpowered Costa Nostra boss
Joseph Joe Bananas Bonnano at gunpoint on
rainswept Park Avenue sidewalk yesterday.
He was sped away struggling in a car.
Bononno, one of the nation's top mobsters,
was to have appeared before a crime-probing
federal grand jury later in the day.
Almost immediately the FBI stepped into
the case, as bizarre as any fictional movie plot
- so much so as to raise the suggestion of a
hoax. However, there was no trace of Bonan
no and fears were expressed that he may have
met a gangland execution.
• Thousands Honor Hoover
NEW YORK — Thousands of New Yorkers
passed by the flag-draped, closed coffin of

Herbert Hoover to pay their final respects
yesterday to the nation's 31st president.
Many bowed, knelt or genuflected. Others

tholomew's Episcopal church on Park Avenue
in mid-Manhattan.
The body will lie in state there through
Th ursday.
Mourner's passed through the church at
a rate of about 2,600 an hour.
