# Between Beginning and End
## 
### 
Do you know that God's Holy Scriptures begin with "hi the beginning God Cre
ated the heavens and the earth" and that they end with "The grace of our Lord Jesus
Christ be with you all. Amen!"
And do you know that the following message from Him is contained between those
two verses ?
"Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understand
ing. In thy ways acknowledge llitn, and He shall direct thy paths.' Know ye that
the Lord He is God; it is He that hath made us, and not we ourselves . . .- All we
like sheep have gone astray; we have turned everyone to his own way; and the Lord
hath laid on Him (Jestts Christ) the iniquity of us all."
For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever
believeth in Hiiti should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not His
Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world THROI'GII Him might
be saved. 1 He that believeth in the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth
not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him." . . . God hath
not appointed its to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ. 0 For all
have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.'
Repent ye therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out.* . . . but
except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." If wc confess our sins, He is faithful
and to FORGIVE us our sins. l " For the wages of sin is death; but the GIFT
of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord." For by grace (God's) are yc
saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the GIFT of God . . ~ u
What must I do to be saved? . . . Relieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou
shall be saved . . .' 3 For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be
saved. 14 Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our
Lord Jesus Christ. 1 " For ye are all children of God by faith in Christ Jestts." 1
Jesus said unto her, '1 am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in Me,
though he were dead, yet shall be live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in Me
shall NEVER die! 17 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name
of the Son of God; that yc may KNOIV that yc If AVE eternal life, and that ye may
believe on the name of the Son of God. 18
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil: for Thou art with me. . . . Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the
days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.""'
Are you a doubting, but honest reader? Then cheek the above portions of Scripture
yourself and prove that this is the true record. As has been said. God will receive
each of tig who will accept His way of coming to Hint. Won't you settle with God
and confess the I.ord Jesus Christ as your Savior now while there is yet time?
