# Residences Host Student Leaders
## 
### 
Students residing in University
residences will be able to meet
their government leaders at their
daily meals. Student leaders have
been issued meal tickets in a move
designed to enable ASSU officials
to have wider contact with stu
dents.
The plan, originated by Dean of
Undergraduate Education Robert
Wert and Food Service Director
Dorothy Bell, "will allow people
to ask questions about student
government, and to meet those
who are involved in it," according
to Pat Forester, administrative
assistant to ASSU President Scott
Mc√üride.
Residences covered by the
tickets are Branner, Moore, Lagu
nita, Roble, Stern, and Wilbur.
