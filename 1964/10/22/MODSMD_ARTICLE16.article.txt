# Women's Council Publishes Cases
## 
### 
Women's Council voted last
week to publish precedent cases
as has been done in previous
years.
"The present council realizes,"
explains Nora Crow, chairman of
Women's Council, "that few stu
dents understand its procedures
lully, and it chooses this means
of education because it has
proved effective in the past."
AT THE SAME time Council
anticipates some difficulties.
"A student may thing her pen
alty unjust," says Miss Crow, "be
cause it is difficult from that pre

scribed in a similar case." Be
cause a published case of "poor
judgment" involves a penalty of
social restriction, she may con
clude that her own "poor judg
ment" deserved more than a mere
warning or a period of probation.
"The council must remind her
that the precedents are only rep
resentative and the penalties are
adjusted to the peculiarities of
the case," says Miss Crow. A stu
dent may find similarities be
tween her won case and a pub
lished precedent, but the council
can only reply that the published
cases are several years old; the
similarities she sees must be fic
tions of conscience" she says.
WOMEN'S COUNCIL has five
members with overlaping terms
of three quarters. A selection
committee, composed of represen
tatives from AWS, LASSU and
Women's Council, chooses two
new members in the fall and three
in the spring.
Each new member selects a res
idence area in which she will
work The Row, Florence Moore,
Roble, Branner, or Lagunita and
Union. She sits on tHe Auxiliary
Committee in her area while it

hears cases concerning minor vi
olations, and she explains pre
cedent so that decision arc con
sistent in all areas.
Of the major Fundamental
Standard violations, the Auxiliary
Committee is empowered to
handle only "gross negligence"
and "poor judgment cases and
many of these come under the
jurisdiction of Women's Council
itself.
BESIDES CASES of "gross
negligence" and "poor judgment,"
Women's Council deals with "de
liberate disregard," "intent to de
ceive," and "misconduct."
The council defines "gross neg
ligence" as lateness of fifteen
minutes or more resulting from
carelessness; "poor judgment" as
lateness of fifteen minutes or
more resulting from miscalcula
tion of time or distance; "delib
erate disregard" as the intention
al violation of a rule; "intend to
deceive" as the falsification of a
university record.
"Misconduct" usually involves
liquor, but the category includes
such minor violations as food
fights.
A STUDENT who violates the
Fundamental Standard reports
the circumstances of the viola
tion to the Women's Council rep
resentative for her area. The
council m embers determines
whether the violation falls under
the jurisdiction of an Auxiliary
Commiltee. If the violation is not
minor, the council member
charges the student appropriately,

explains her right, and makes an
appointment to appear before
the council.
At the hearing the chairman of
the council reminds the student
ol her rights, emphasizing that it
will:
• Consider her innocent until
proved guilty.
• Inform her of all evidence
against her.
• Permit the calling of charac
ter witnesses in her behalf.
• Permit the disqualification
of its own members on grounds
of prejudice.
• Encourage appeal to the
Dean of Women.
• Respect her right to secrecy.
COUNCIL MEMBERS do not
discuss the case outside the coun
cil room, and use their copy of
the minutes only for purposes of
precedent.
The Dean of Women and the
Dean of Students also possess
copies of the minutes, but they
do not volunteer information
about the case.
Under some circumstances, the
student may ask the Dean's Of
fice to handle her case, directly,
so that the council will have no
record of it. But she always has
the basic right to present her case
before the council.
"During her presentation, she
has the right," explains Miss
Crow, "to expect th e council's
credence once she has agreed to
tell the truth."
The council accepts her word
unless she contradicts herself, un

less more than one witness pre
sents evidence against her, or un
less the council comes upon ma
terial proof of her perjury.
IF THE COUNCIL finds a stu
dent guilty, it may place her on
probation. It may impose upon
her a form of social restriction
appropriate to her offense (re
striction of guest privileges, of
late leaves, of overnights).
If ihe violation involves dis
iscourtesy to others, the council
may assign work in the Conval
escent Home.
The Council may suspend a
student who appears incapable of
accepting responsibility under the
university system. If the council
has considered suspension but re
gards the penalty as harsh, or if
it believes that one more viola
tion will prove the student un
able to live within the system, it
may suspend her suspension.
The council merely recommends
a penalty to the Dean of Women,
who may request that the coun
cil or the Disciplinary Sub-Com
mittee review the case.

WOMEN'S COUNCIL has five
members with overlaping terms
of three quarters. A selection
committee, composed of represen
tatives from AWS, LASSU and
Women's Council, chooses two
new members in the fall and three
in the spring.
Each new member selects a res
idence area in which she will
work The Row, Florence Moore,
Roble, Branner, or Lagunita and
Union. She sits on tHe Auxiliary
Committee in her area while it

hears cases concerning minor vi
olations, and she explains pre
cedent so that decision arc con
sistent in all areas.
Of the major Fundamental
Standard violations, the Auxiliary
Committee is empowered to
handle only "gross negligence"
and "poor judgment cases and
many of these come under the
jurisdiction of Women's Council
itself.
BESIDES CASES of "gross
negligence" and "poor judgment,"
Women's Council deals with "de
liberate disregard," "intent to de
ceive," and "misconduct."
The council defines "gross neg
ligence" as lateness of fifteen
minutes or more resulting from
carelessness; "poor judgment" as
lateness of fifteen minutes or
more resulting from miscalcula
tion of time or distance; "delib
erate disregard" as the intention
al violation of a rule; "intend to
deceive" as the falsification of a
university record.
"Misconduct" usually involves
liquor, but the category includes
such minor violations as food
fights.
A STUDENT who violates the
Fundamental Standard reports
the circumstances of the viola
tion to the Women's Council rep
resentative for her area. The
council m embers determines
whether the violation falls under
the jurisdiction of an Auxiliary
Commiltee. If the violation is not
minor, the council member
charges the student appropriately,

explains her right, and makes an
appointment to appear before
the council.
At the hearing the chairman of
the council reminds the student
ol her rights, emphasizing that it
will:
• Consider her innocent until
proved guilty.
• Inform her of all evidence
against her.
• Permit the calling of charac
ter witnesses in her behalf.
• Permit the disqualification
of its own members on grounds
of prejudice.
• Encourage appeal to the
Dean of Women.
• Respect her right to secrecy.
COUNCIL MEMBERS do not
discuss the case outside the coun
cil room, and use their copy of
the minutes only for purposes of
precedent.
The Dean of Women and the
Dean of Students also possess
copies of the minutes, but they
do not volunteer information
about the case.
Under some circumstances, the
student may ask the Dean's Of
fice to handle her case, directly,
so that the council will have no
record of it. But she always has
the basic right to present her case
before the council.
"During her presentation, she
has the right," explains Miss
Crow, "to expect th e council's
credence once she has agreed to
tell the truth."
The council accepts her word
unless she contradicts herself, un

less more than one witness pre
sents evidence against her, or un
less the council comes upon ma
terial proof of her perjury.
IF THE COUNCIL finds a stu
dent guilty, it may place her on
probation. It may impose upon
her a form of social restriction
appropriate to her offense (re
striction of guest privileges, of
late leaves, of overnights).
If ihe violation involves dis
iscourtesy to others, the council
may assign work in the Conval
escent Home.
The Council may suspend a
student who appears incapable of
accepting responsibility under the
university system. If the council
has considered suspension but re
gards the penalty as harsh, or if
it believes that one more viola
tion will prove the student un
able to live within the system, it
may suspend her suspension.
The council merely recommends
a penalty to the Dean of Women,
who may request that the coun
cil or the Disciplinary Sub-Com
mittee review the case.
Women's Council voted last
week to publish precedent cases
as has been done in previous
years.
"The present council realizes,"
explains Nora Crow, chairman of
Women's Council, "that few stu
dents understand its procedures
lully, and it chooses this means
of education because it has
proved effective in the past."
AT THE SAME time Council
anticipates some difficulties.
"A student may thing her pen
alty unjust," says Miss Crow, "be
cause it is difficult from that pre

scribed in a similar case." Be
cause a published case of "poor
judgment" involves a penalty of
social restriction, she may con
clude that her own "poor judg
ment" deserved more than a mere
warning or a period of probation.
"The council must remind her

sistent in all areas.
Of the major Fundamental
Standard violations, the Auxiliary
Committee is empowered to
handle only "gross negligence"
and "poor judgment cases and
many of these come under the
jurisdiction of Women's Council
itself.
BESIDES CASES of "gross
negligence" and "poor judgment,"
Women's Council deals with "de
liberate disregard," "intent to de
ceive," and "misconduct."
The council defines "gross neg
ligence" as lateness of fifteen
minutes or more resulting from
carelessness; "poor judgment" as
lateness of fifteen minutes or
more resulting from miscalcula
tion of time or distance; "delib
erate disregard" as the intention
al violation of a rule; "intend to
deceive" as the falsification of a
university record.
"Misconduct" usually involves
liquor, but the category includes
such minor violations as food
fights.
A STUDENT who violates the
Fundamental Standard reports
the circumstances of the viola
tion to the Women's Council rep
resentative for her area. The
council m embers determines
whether the violation falls under
the jurisdiction of an Auxiliary
Commiltee. If the violation is not
minor, the council member
charges the student appropriately,

explains her right, and makes an
appointment to appear before
the council.
At the hearing the chairman of
the council reminds the student
ol her rights, emphasizing that it
will:
• Consider her innocent until
proved guilty.
• Inform her of all evidence
against her.
• Permit the calling of charac
ter witnesses in her behalf.
• Permit the disqualification
of its own members on grounds
of prejudice.
• Encourage appeal to the
Dean of Women.
• Respect her right to secrecy.
COUNCIL MEMBERS do not
discuss the case outside the coun
cil room, and use their copy of
the minutes only for purposes of
precedent.
The Dean of Women and the
Dean of Students also possess
copies of the minutes, but they
do not volunteer information
about the case.
Under some circumstances, the
student may ask the Dean's Of
fice to handle her case, directly,
so that the council will have no
record of it. But she always has
the basic right to present her case
before the council.
"During her presentation, she
has the right," explains Miss
Crow, "to expect th e council's
credence once she has agreed to
tell the truth."
The council accepts her word
unless she contradicts herself, un

less more than one witness pre
sents evidence against her, or un
less the council comes upon ma
terial proof of her perjury.
IF THE COUNCIL finds a stu
dent guilty, it may place her on
probation. It may impose upon
her a form of social restriction
appropriate to her offense (re
striction of guest privileges, of
late leaves, of overnights).
If ihe violation involves dis
iscourtesy to others, the council
may assign work in the Conval
escent Home.
The Council may suspend a
student who appears incapable of
accepting responsibility under the
university system. If the council
has considered suspension but re
gards the penalty as harsh, or if
it believes that one more viola
tion will prove the student un
able to live within the system, it
may suspend her suspension.
The council merely recommends
a penalty to the Dean of Women,
who may request that the coun
cil or the Disciplinary Sub-Com
mittee review the case.
Women's Council voted last
week to publish precedent cases
as has been done in previous
years.
"The present council realizes,"
explains Nora Crow, chairman of
Women's Council, "that few stu
dents understand its procedures
lully, and it chooses this means
of education because it has
proved effective in the past."
AT THE SAME time Council
anticipates some difficulties.
"A student may thing her pen
alty unjust," says Miss Crow, "be
cause it is difficult from that pre

scribed in a similar case." Be
cause a published case of "poor
judgment" involves a penalty of
social restriction, she may con
clude that her own "poor judg
ment" deserved more than a mere
warning or a period of probation.
"The council must remind her
that the precedents are only rep
resentative and the penalties are
adjusted to the peculiarities of
the case," says Miss Crow. A stu
dent may find similarities be
tween her won case and a pub
lished precedent, but the council
can only reply that the published
cases are several years old; the
similarities she sees must be fic
tions of conscience" she says.
WOMEN'S COUNCIL has five
members with overlaping terms
of three quarters. A selection
committee, composed of represen
tatives from AWS, LASSU and
Women's Council, chooses two
new members in the fall and three
in the spring.
Each new member selects a res
idence area in which she will
work The Row, Florence Moore,
Roble, Branner, or Lagunita and
Union. She sits on tHe Auxiliary
Committee in her area while it

hears cases concerning minor vi
olations, and she explains pre
