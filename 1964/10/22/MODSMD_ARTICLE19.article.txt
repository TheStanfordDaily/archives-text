# SRI's Electronic Braille May Help Blind In School
## 
### 
Electronic braille — a current
SRI project — may eventually
enable blind youngsters to attend
regular public schools.
The braille project, under the
direction of Professor John Lin
vill, head of the University's Elec
trical Engineering Department,
primarily involves the develop
ment and refinement of an elec
tronic reading machine w hi c h
would photo-electronically "read"
printed symbols and reproduce
them in a tactilely reeognizeable
form.
According to Dr. James Bliss,
a research engineer on the proj
ect, the machine would contain

cells sensitive to light.
"By responding to the light
and dark areas on a printed page,
the cells would stimulate corre
sponding reeds to vibrate and
create images of the symbols on
the page which can be tactilely
recognized by the blind."
The electronic braille machine
would enable blind students to
"read" sighted texts, including
algebra and foreign language ma
terials, and would enable blind
students to attend college.
Dr. Linvill. whose blind daugh
ter Candy has been the project's
guinea pig. notes that, "The ma
chine would overcome the prob
lem of limited braille texts and
enable blind individuals to lead
fuller, more nearly normal aca
demic lives."
