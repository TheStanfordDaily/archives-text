# Top Expert On Crystal Joins Staff
## 
### 
One of the nation's top experts
on the growth and formation of
crystals has joined Stanford Uni
| versity's Materials Science De-
I partment faculty.
Canadian-born Prof. William A.
j Tilier, 35, will augment the Uni
versity's teaching staff in this
I rapidly advancing field of science,
| and head a research team in "cry
| stallogenics," or crystal forma
tion. He previously headed a 20-
man research group at Westing
house Research and Development
Center in Pittsburgh, Pa., where
he was manager of the Crystal
logenics Section.
CRYSTALLOGENICS research
is aimed at understanding an d
learning to control all phases of
the "freezing" process that oc
curs when a material cools from
the liquid state to the solid state.
Different controls are known
to cause variations in structure
and purity of the solidified ma
terial. These in turn produce dif
ferent physical, chemical, and
electricali properties in the ma
terial.
Past work under Prof. Tiller
has led 10 some control over the
freezing process in producing
ingots, large-polymer crystals,
and ultra-pure water. These may
lead eventually to automated,
lower-cost foundry production of
ingots, new kinds of large-poly
mer crystals and electrical ma-
J terials, and simpler, low-cost svs-
I terns for purifying sea water and
chemicals.
The large-polymer work already
has produced what are probably
the world's only large crystals of
selenium, a material widely used
in photoelectric cells and glass
making, and which normally does
not crystallize at all.
Prof. Tiller received bachelor's,
master's, and doctoral degrees
from the University of Toronto.
He became a research engineer
in 1955 at Westinghouse, remain
ing there until taking over hi s
Stanford assignment Sept. 1. He
has published more than TO scien
tific papers in his field.
