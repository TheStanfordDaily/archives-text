# Irish Defense Best
## 
### 
When Stanford clashes with
! Notre Damp this weekend, two
squads impressively represented
on the National standings sheet
will come down to brass tacks.
Indian Ray Handley remains
on top of the nation in rushing
with 530 yards. Piccolo of Wake
Forest is close behind with 528,
and Washington's Coffey is third
with 487 yards.
Stanford's Braden Beck has
! kicked for 27 points, placing him
jin a tie for second nationally.
Alabama's Raj' holds the lead
I with 31 points.
STANFORD quarterbacKs will
have their hands full against the
Notre Dame line, who lead the
nation in rushing defense. Irish
man Bob Gary poses another
threat to Card passers. His five
interceptions place him in a four
way tie for second in the nation.
Indian defensive ends an d
backs, after their sterling p c r
formance against Rice, will have
| a real challenge this weekend.
Notre Dame's Jack Snow ranks
1 fourth in the nation in pass re
j ceiving, and Noire Dame ranks
. tenth in forward passing offense.
The Irish offense will put the
. Tribe Big D to the test. Only four
teams in the country have scored
more than Notre Dame.
John Huarte has led the Irish
to 709 yards total offense, enough
to place him in the fourteenth
position. His forward passing rec
ord is not so impressive, 41 com

i pletions out of 74 attempts for
i 699 yards and a 23rd ranking.
[ j Yet eight times this year hi s
