# New Pavilion Planned
## 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
The proposed $2.5 million has- J
ketba 11 pavilion, ever since its
plans were released, has been
anxiously awaited for by the Stan
ford community. Originally, it
was planned to be part of the suc
cessful PACE program, but con
tributions for it were meager in
deed.
Now, two committees are earn- j
estly soliciting funds and Mr. â€¢
Joseph Ruetz, an Associate Di-1
rector of Development, is hope-1
ful that by this coming June tho i
fund raisers will be able to show i
enough "evidence of progress" so I

that final pre-construction prep
arations can be made.
By 1 his time, the date set for
an extensive cost estimate, Ruetz
hopes at least half ol the money
will be in hand. Part of the rest
of the money will probably come
out of the University's unre
stricted funds. Since construction
costs rise yearly, the later the
job is done, the more it will cost.
Separate committees are solicit
ing money in Northern and South-
California. Henry McMicking
heads nine members in the north
and former Stanford football
great Bob Reynolds directs 25
members in the southland. Realiz
ing that at least one gift in the
million dollar category is neces

sary, these men have been seek
ing gifts of substantial amounts.
Generally, they are contacting
alumni and friends who did not
give to PACE or make an early
gift.
Al present, approximately $170
thousand has been raised, which
represents slightly less than one
tenth of the necessary funds. In
cluded are two individual contri
butions of $75 and $30 thousand
and two corporate ones of $25 and
$10 thousand.
The committees, organized only
last April, have shown much prog
ress. "And, you have to realize"
emphasized Ruetz, "that fund
raising is a time consuming proc
ess. Nobody is willing to donate a
large sum of money, no matter
what the cause, on the spur of the
moment, lie must be given time
to consider the extent of his com
mittment and at which time Hie
donation would be most beneficial
both to himself and to ihe insti
tution."
