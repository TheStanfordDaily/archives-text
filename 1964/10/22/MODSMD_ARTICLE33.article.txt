# Cold War Strategy And World Peace
## 
### 
The change in leadership in the Soviet Union
and the entry of China into the nuclear "club"
has necessitated a potentially valuable reassess
ment ol the world situation and the proper goals
of United States foreign policy.
It is agreed among leaders of both parties
and. really, among all peoples around the Nvorld,
that peace must be our overriding concern. And
peace, properly understood, is anil should be the
goal ol American foreign policy.
Hut here the concensus ends, for there is Nvide
disagreement about Nvhat programs should be
folloNved in achieving an acceptable peace.
There can be no doubt that the principle
agent of disorder, revolution, and overt or covert
aggression in the past two decades has been the
international Communist movement.
Aside from judgments as to whether Commu
nism is "all bad," or the West, "all good," this is
a fact nn illl which we must contend.
Neither can it be doubled that the ultimate
effectiveness of U.S. foreign polic) in achieving
anything like complete peace Nvill depend on
our understanding of and attitude toward the
agent n\ I iic fi constant!)' hinders the attainment
ol that goal.
It is our contention that present policies can
never achieve peace and are in fact, as one of
the participants of the Hoover Conference said,
leading to "Nvar on the installment plan.
for present policx is operating in part on the
assumption (or, more proper!)', on the hope)
that tlu* Son iet Union and the Communist move
ment are "mellow ing" in their designs for global
conquest, and that as long as nnc remain friendly
and willing to negotiate our differences, we n\ ill
be able to coexist peacefully for time eternal.
This, at least, is what we can gather from
reports of the Rostow memorandum and from
President Johnson himself, who asserted in a
press conference on December 27, 1963: "We
are going ilonvii any path that can possibly lead
to peace. We will meet the Russians half way,
anil even further than half way, if that is neces
sary."
This n ieN\ lails to account for the decisive
influence of ideology on the thinking of Commu
nist leaders, an ideology which prescribes the
inevitable ovcrthnm of capitalism and the estab
lishment o! a world socialist order, and outlines
as nn'i'll a set of heretofore effective strategic
principles designed to bring about such a revolu
tion.
There is no substantial evidence today to
indicate that an) of the Communist leaders, re
gardless of country, have abandoned or altered
significant!) these ideological assumptions around
which thc\" have operated for several decades.
Even where there are moves for greater in

dependence from Moscow domination, there re
mains around the world co-operation among
Communist powers in fomenting discontent and
revolution and in promoting so-called wars of
liberation.
A policy based on the wishful thinking that
this were not so can never further the cause o!
peace. It can only encourage the Communist
leaders to further aggressions and pressures. Anil
it can only dissipate our ability to contain and
limit the total influence of the Communist move
ment.
II peace is our goal, and il the nature ol the
Communist ideology has not changed, then our
policy must be to reduce, without war, the ability
ol the Communists to disturb peace. It must be,
iu short, to end the Cold War by eliminating the
primary cause of its existence.
To that end, the following is necessary:
• The United States must give clear evidence
at all times of its overwhelming military superior
ity with regard to every conceivable type ol con
flict, from guerilla war!are to nuclear exchange.
II the Son iet Union ever should achieve a definite
superiority in this area, we can expect more de
mands, ultimatums, and aggression.
• The United States must do everything in
its power to encourage a strong and effective
alliance system (NATO, SEA l(). OAS. etc.) in
nn liich ever) member participates to the best of
its ability toward reducing Communist poNver.
• The United States must adopt a fonvard
strategy which refuses to concede Communist
advances anywhere and which achieves and re
tains the initiative in the Cold War. The so
called containment policy is not effective because
it accepts a continual disturbance of the peace,
leaving us open to constant prodding and push
ing, which results in a slonv, but steady retreat.
• We must work at all times to counteract
and defeat Communism and in the long run to
establish in the Communist countries govern
ments which will confine their foreign policies
to their legitimate national interests. This means
informing all potential aggressors that we Nvill
counteract force nn ith force and that we w ill
apply economic, diplomatic and psychological
pressures wherever possible to reduce Commu
nist power.
These are, admittedly, bold policies which
aim at extremely long-range goals. They require
a constant and strenuous effort on the part of the
nations and people of the West.
Hut they are, barring a miraculous change
of heart on the part of Communist leaders, the
only means by which peace eventually Nvill be
obtained. And they are the only alternative to
a continual Western retreat and an eventual
choice between suicidal war, or surrender.

and willing to negotiate our differences, we n\ ill
be able to coexist peacefully for time eternal.
This, at least, is what we can gather from
reports of the Rostow memorandum and from
President Johnson himself, who asserted in a
press conference on December 27, 1963: "We
are going ilonvii any path that can possibly lead
to peace. We will meet the Russians half way,
anil even further than half way, if that is neces
sary."
This n ieN\ lails to account for the decisive
influence of ideology on the thinking of Commu
nist leaders, an ideology which prescribes the
inevitable ovcrthnm of capitalism and the estab
lishment o! a world socialist order, and outlines
as nn'i'll a set of heretofore effective strategic
principles designed to bring about such a revolu
tion.
There is no substantial evidence today to
indicate that an) of the Communist leaders, re
gardless of country, have abandoned or altered
significant!) these ideological assumptions around
which thc\" have operated for several decades.
Even where there are moves for greater in

dependence from Moscow domination, there re
mains around the world co-operation among
Communist powers in fomenting discontent and
revolution and in promoting so-called wars of
liberation.
A policy based on the wishful thinking that
this were not so can never further the cause o!
peace. It can only encourage the Communist
leaders to further aggressions and pressures. Anil
it can only dissipate our ability to contain and
limit the total influence of the Communist move
ment.
II peace is our goal, and il the nature ol the
Communist ideology has not changed, then our
policy must be to reduce, without war, the ability
ol the Communists to disturb peace. It must be,
iu short, to end the Cold War by eliminating the
primary cause of its existence.
To that end, the following is necessary:
• The United States must give clear evidence
at all times of its overwhelming military superior
ity with regard to every conceivable type ol con
flict, from guerilla war!are to nuclear exchange.
II the Son iet Union ever should achieve a definite
superiority in this area, we can expect more de
mands, ultimatums, and aggression.
• The United States must do everything in
its power to encourage a strong and effective
alliance system (NATO, SEA l(). OAS. etc.) in
nn liich ever) member participates to the best of
its ability toward reducing Communist poNver.
• The United States must adopt a fonvard
strategy which refuses to concede Communist
advances anywhere and which achieves and re
tains the initiative in the Cold War. The so
called containment policy is not effective because
it accepts a continual disturbance of the peace,
leaving us open to constant prodding and push
ing, which results in a slonv, but steady retreat.
• We must work at all times to counteract
and defeat Communism and in the long run to
establish in the Communist countries govern
ments which will confine their foreign policies
to their legitimate national interests. This means
informing all potential aggressors that we Nvill
counteract force nn ith force and that we w ill
apply economic, diplomatic and psychological
pressures wherever possible to reduce Commu
nist power.
These are, admittedly, bold policies which
aim at extremely long-range goals. They require
a constant and strenuous effort on the part of the
nations and people of the West.
Hut they are, barring a miraculous change
of heart on the part of Communist leaders, the
only means by which peace eventually Nvill be
obtained. And they are the only alternative to
a continual Western retreat and an eventual
choice between suicidal war, or surrender.
The change in leadership in the Soviet Union
and the entry of China into the nuclear "club"
has necessitated a potentially valuable reassess
ment ol the world situation and the proper goals
of United States foreign policy.
It is agreed among leaders of both parties
and. really, among all peoples around the Nvorld,
that peace must be our overriding concern. And
peace, properly understood, is anil should be the
goal ol American foreign policy.
Hut here the concensus ends, for there is Nvide
disagreement about Nvhat programs should be
folloNved in achieving an acceptable peace.
There can be no doubt that the principle
agent of disorder, revolution, and overt or covert
aggression in the past two decades has been the
international Communist movement.
Aside from judgments as to whether Commu
nism is "all bad," or the West, "all good," this is
a fact nn illl which we must contend.
Neither can it be doubled that the ultimate
effectiveness of U.S. foreign polic) in achieving
anything like complete peace Nvill depend on
our understanding of and attitude toward the
agent n\ I iic fi constant!)' hinders the attainment
ol that goal.
It is our contention that present policies can
never achieve peace and are in fact, as one of
the participants of the Hoover Conference said,

Communist ideology has not changed, then our
policy must be to reduce, without war, the ability
ol the Communists to disturb peace. It must be,
iu short, to end the Cold War by eliminating the
primary cause of its existence.
To that end, the following is necessary:
• The United States must give clear evidence
at all times of its overwhelming military superior
ity with regard to every conceivable type ol con
flict, from guerilla war!are to nuclear exchange.
II the Son iet Union ever should achieve a definite
superiority in this area, we can expect more de
mands, ultimatums, and aggression.
• The United States must do everything in
its power to encourage a strong and effective
alliance system (NATO, SEA l(). OAS. etc.) in
nn liich ever) member participates to the best of
its ability toward reducing Communist poNver.
• The United States must adopt a fonvard
strategy which refuses to concede Communist
advances anywhere and which achieves and re
tains the initiative in the Cold War. The so
called containment policy is not effective because
it accepts a continual disturbance of the peace,
leaving us open to constant prodding and push
ing, which results in a slonv, but steady retreat.
• We must work at all times to counteract
and defeat Communism and in the long run to
establish in the Communist countries govern
ments which will confine their foreign policies
to their legitimate national interests. This means
informing all potential aggressors that we Nvill
counteract force nn ith force and that we w ill
apply economic, diplomatic and psychological
pressures wherever possible to reduce Commu
nist power.
These are, admittedly, bold policies which
aim at extremely long-range goals. They require
a constant and strenuous effort on the part of the
nations and people of the West.
Hut they are, barring a miraculous change
of heart on the part of Communist leaders, the
only means by which peace eventually Nvill be
obtained. And they are the only alternative to
a continual Western retreat and an eventual
choice between suicidal war, or surrender.
The change in leadership in the Soviet Union
and the entry of China into the nuclear "club"
has necessitated a potentially valuable reassess
ment ol the world situation and the proper goals
of United States foreign policy.
It is agreed among leaders of both parties
and. really, among all peoples around the Nvorld,
that peace must be our overriding concern. And
peace, properly understood, is anil should be the
goal ol American foreign policy.
Hut here the concensus ends, for there is Nvide
disagreement about Nvhat programs should be
folloNved in achieving an acceptable peace.
There can be no doubt that the principle
agent of disorder, revolution, and overt or covert
aggression in the past two decades has been the
international Communist movement.
Aside from judgments as to whether Commu
nism is "all bad," or the West, "all good," this is
a fact nn illl which we must contend.
Neither can it be doubled that the ultimate
effectiveness of U.S. foreign polic) in achieving
anything like complete peace Nvill depend on
our understanding of and attitude toward the
agent n\ I iic fi constant!)' hinders the attainment
ol that goal.
It is our contention that present policies can
never achieve peace and are in fact, as one of
the participants of the Hoover Conference said,
leading to "Nvar on the installment plan.
for present policx is operating in part on the
assumption (or, more proper!)', on the hope)
that tlu* Son iet Union and the Communist move
ment are "mellow ing" in their designs for global
conquest, and that as long as nnc remain friendly
and willing to negotiate our differences, we n\ ill
be able to coexist peacefully for time eternal.
This, at least, is what we can gather from
reports of the Rostow memorandum and from
President Johnson himself, who asserted in a
press conference on December 27, 1963: "We
are going ilonvii any path that can possibly lead
to peace. We will meet the Russians half way,
anil even further than half way, if that is neces
sary."
This n ieN\ lails to account for the decisive
influence of ideology on the thinking of Commu
nist leaders, an ideology which prescribes the
inevitable ovcrthnm of capitalism and the estab
lishment o! a world socialist order, and outlines
as nn'i'll a set of heretofore effective strategic
principles designed to bring about such a revolu
tion.
There is no substantial evidence today to
indicate that an) of the Communist leaders, re
gardless of country, have abandoned or altered
significant!) these ideological assumptions around
which thc\" have operated for several decades.
Even where there are moves for greater in

dependence from Moscow domination, there re
mains around the world co-operation among
Communist powers in fomenting discontent and
revolution and in promoting so-called wars of
liberation.
A policy based on the wishful thinking that
this were not so can never further the cause o!
peace. It can only encourage the Communist
leaders to further aggressions and pressures. Anil
it can only dissipate our ability to contain and
limit the total influence of the Communist move
ment.
