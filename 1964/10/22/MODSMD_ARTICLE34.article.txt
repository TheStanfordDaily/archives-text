## Arizona's Problem Not All Conservative 
### 
Dear Sir:
As a progressive-minded liberal
and a native of Phoenix, I natur
ally fell mixed emotions upon
reading Mr. Barry Ames' article
on the corruption and crime thriv
ing in Arizona due to Goldwator
inspired.conservat ivc government.
Although the state suffers from
most of the ailments Mr. Ames
has enumerated. I seriously
doubt if the cause can be so sim
ply ascribed to the conservative
Republicans.
I would attribute Arizona's
present difficulties to two major
sources. One is the tremendous
growth the state has experienced
in the last decade. This tremen
dous influx of population has re
sulted in a greater amount of
social readjustment problems
than more stable communities
ordinarily have to face.
The second major source is a
tragically outdated political sys
tem. This problem antedates the
advent of Goldwater Repulican
ism. In fact, Goldwater first en
tered public office on an effec
tive reform ticket which defeated
a corrupt Phoenix city govern
ment machine. Political primi
tiveness can be best traced to
the primordial legislature sys
tem which has failed to adjust to
the enormous changes in th e
s t u ' e. Conservative Governor
Paul Fannin has relatively little
power compared to the old-style
Democrats in the House and Sen-

Solutions must come from the
reunification of the fragmented
Democratic Party which still
holds a majority of the registered
voters. Goldwaterism in Arizona
is an intermediate stage between
tho old system and modern gov
ernment by enlightened prin
ciples.

Dear Sir:
I.and many other interested
students, feel that your perform
ance thus far has been a singular
tragedy in the history of Stanford
journalism. We are willing to
tolerate the use of this paper as
a means for the promotion of
causes toward which we may have
no sympathy. And. though we
may pale at the thought of many
of the things said about the im
plications of recent happenings
and the current campaign for
the Presidency of the United
States, we admit that our feelings
might be classified as prejudicial
emotions. We are outraged, how
ever, w hen a Daily column worps
the statements of others in up
holding its own questionable
viewpoint. I refer to the column
of one John Bonine in th e
Daily of Tuesday, October 20th.
The real outrage, however,
comes in the deliberate warping
of the article by Harold Green in
the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
i11<• of Mnv 1 'Hit Mv com

i plaints are these: (1) Mr. Bonine
i does not mention that Mr. Green I
is the author of the article, but j
; mentions him as being inter
j viewed a few paragraphs later.
(2) Mr. Bonine construes Mr.
Green's statements to imply lax
ity on the part of the AE!C and
I other agencies and concludes that ;
lour security program is "going!
i on the rocks." In his article Mr.
Green proves the opposite to be
; true.
Mr. Green comments on th e j
many shattered lives of the Mar- j
Carth.v era. He further points out ;
that the AEC's security files are,
subject to complete review by;
congress under the Joint Com
i mittee on Atomic Energy. In con
trast to the conclusions reached
, by Bonine, Mr. Green states. " . . .
1 the AEC's security clearance pro
cedures have won acclaim as the {
most liberal in the rights afforded
unfortunate persons enmeshed in
the security procedures of any
government." However, at the
same time, the AEC's program is j
"one of the most stringent and'
effective security programs, and
there is no known instance of
subversive penetration of the
AEC program in its seventeen
year history."
I humbly suggest that Mr. Bo
nine confine his comments to
fact. If he is unwilling to do this
I suggest that he confine his
sources for invective to publica-,
i lions which arc hard to locate. I
