## U.S. Policy Must Use Negotiation 
### Walter Lippmann 
Two great events within the
Communist world, long foreseen
us inevitable, happened to eoin
! cide last week. This complicates
greatly the making of our own
policy.
Wc have, I think, to make two
assumptions at the veiy begin
ning. One is that tho post-Khru
shchev regime will be fluid and
uncertain for months, perhaps
for some years to come. The other
assumption is that while the
Chinese nuclear device is no j
doubt primitive by our own stand-'
aids and by Russian standards,
China will nevertheless soon be-\
gin to be regarded, at least in I
Eastern Asia, as a genuine nu- 1
clear power.
Coexistence Or Hostility?
The critical question for us and
| for our allies is whether Russia i
j and China will roach agreement
i on the basis of coexistence with)
; the West or on the basis of revo
lutionary hostility against th e
; West. There is no preordained
answer to this question. Quite
conceivably it can be answered
either way. Most certainly, more
! over, our own policies toward
China and Russia can be highly
influential and perhaps decisive
' in determining the outcome of
1 the question whether Russia goes
iwith China or China with Rus
i si a.
The foundation of a policy must
be extension to China of the mili
tary system which has played
such a crucial part in persuading
the Soviet Union under Khru
shchev to rule out nuclear w a r
and seek peaceable coexistence.
This is a policy of military su
periority without pretending to
supremacy, a superiority used to
deter, but not to dominate.
President Lvndon Johnson on
Sunday evening extended 1 hi s
policy to Eastern Asia.
Thus China starts its career as
a nuclear power within the same
framework of deterrence ilru th
So vie' T *vtn has lived in since
the m'c'.'.lV of the 19305. This
should s'" - vr as a big persuader
for a policy of coexistence in Pe
king.
Differing; National Interests
Along with deterrence, an in
tegral part of American policy
' begun under President Dwight
Eisenhower has been to negotiate
with the Communist nations on
the principle that they are not
identical and have differing na
tional interests. One of the cardi
nal fallacies of Goldwaterism,
which would paralyze American
diplomacy in the world, is the ig
norant prejudice that all Commu
nist states are alike and should
i be treated with the same degree j
I of hostility.
The truth is that Russia and
j China, though they both avow
I Marxism and Leninism, are in
| different stages of development
and have divergent national inter
ests. Moreover, the East Euro
! pean Communist nations desire
; an increasing degree of national
! Independence from Mosc o w.
There is also every reason to think
that the Southeast Asian Commu- (
nist nations, like North Vietnam!
: and Laos, would prefer to avoid
| domination from Peking.
It is. plainly enough, a vital
interest of the Soviet Union that
■ Red China should evolve out of
; its revolutionary militancy a n d
: concentrate on internal develop
i ment. This is also our interest.
| and we must not shut our minds !
to, or exclude from the consider- j
ation of our policies, the possibil-;
ity that within the coming goner-!
ation China will wish to make;
I peace with all her neighbors, on
I the land and on the sea.

Two great events within the
Communist world, long foreseen
us inevitable, happened to eoin
! cide last week. This complicates
greatly the making of our own
policy.
Wc have, I think, to make two
assumptions at the veiy begin
ning. One is that tho post-Khru
shchev regime will be fluid and
uncertain for months, perhaps
for some years to come. The other
assumption is that while the
Chinese nuclear device is no j
doubt primitive by our own stand-'
aids and by Russian standards,
China will nevertheless soon be-\
gin to be regarded, at least in I
Eastern Asia, as a genuine nu- 1
clear power.
Coexistence Or Hostility?
The critical question for us and
| for our allies is whether Russia i
j and China will roach agreement
i on the basis of coexistence with)
; the West or on the basis of revo
lutionary hostility against th e
; West. There is no preordained
answer to this question. Quite
conceivably it can be answered
either way. Most certainly, more
! over, our own policies toward
China and Russia can be highly
influential and perhaps decisive
' in determining the outcome of
1 the question whether Russia goes
iwith China or China with Rus
i si a.
The foundation of a policy must
be extension to China of the mili
tary system which has played
such a crucial part in persuading
the Soviet Union under Khru
shchev to rule out nuclear w a r
and seek peaceable coexistence.
This is a policy of military su
periority without pretending to
supremacy, a superiority used to
deter, but not to dominate.

Differing; National Interests
Along with deterrence, an in
tegral part of American policy
' begun under President Dwight
Eisenhower has been to negotiate
with the Communist nations on
the principle that they are not
identical and have differing na
tional interests. One of the cardi
nal fallacies of Goldwaterism,
which would paralyze American
diplomacy in the world, is the ig
norant prejudice that all Commu
nist states are alike and should
i be treated with the same degree j
I of hostility.
The truth is that Russia and
j China, though they both avow
I Marxism and Leninism, are in
| different stages of development
and have divergent national inter
ests. Moreover, the East Euro
! pean Communist nations desire
; an increasing degree of national
! Independence from Mosc o w.
There is also every reason to think
that the Southeast Asian Commu- (
nist nations, like North Vietnam!
: and Laos, would prefer to avoid
| domination from Peking.
It is. plainly enough, a vital
interest of the Soviet Union that
■ Red China should evolve out of
; its revolutionary militancy a n d
: concentrate on internal develop
i ment. This is also our interest.

to, or exclude from the consider- j
ation of our policies, the possibil-;
