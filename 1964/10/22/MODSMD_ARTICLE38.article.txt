## 'Conservatism In Action': Bad Tax Welfare Systems 
### BARRY AMES (Second of Two Articles) 
As it becomes more and more unrealistic to expect private
charities to shoulder the wellare hurden. Conservatives point to
the State as the appropriate level (or these programs.

Arizona's death rate among min
ority groups is the highest in the
Mountain States; its infant mor
tality rate is far greater than
neighboring States and nearly
double that of California; and.
next to Washington, D.C.. ii has
the highest TB rate in the rial ion.
Faccd with these neels. Wel
fare in Arizona seems either in
adequate or non-existent. Arizona
has no provision for medical aid
to Ihc Aged (Kerr Mills > ml no
provisions to aid the permanently
and totally disabled. !t has no
intermediate correctional invti
tut ion for boys, and no institu
tion at all for girls. It Ivis no out
patient psychiatric clinic, and ihc
900 patient Colony for Retarded
Children has only one doctor.
Mental Hospital 'Awful'
The Arizona State Mental Hos
pital was called "disgraceful" by
Dr. William Meninger. It is un
accredited because it has only
three psychiatrists for 1,900 pa
tients. Conditions within the hos
pital are indescribably awful.
This hospital seems a long way
from the 20th century.
It might seem surprising that
Arizona Conservatives enjoy talk
ing about the State welfare pro
grams. They note with approval
that in the last ten years per
capita welfare expenditures have
risen only six per cent, while per
capita income has risen fifty-three
per cent.
They add that in 19.13 Welfare
took 27 per cent of the State budg
et; today it takes only 15 per
cent. As an example of sound
business management, they point
to administrative costs in Ari
zona. For example, in Old Age As
sistance, Arizona has the lowest
administrative cost per case in
the country.
Heavy ( use Load
These statistics can be inter
preted in a different way, for they
simply prove the complete inade
quacy of Arizona Welfare. We
have the lowest administrative
cost in OAA because we have the
highest caseload per social work
er in the nation 530. We have
the third highest caseload for Aid
to Dependent Children, and this
results in a very small percentage
of people getting off welfare. Re
habilitation is difficult in Arizona
because employee turnover is so
high the third highest in the

fr
Nation. Most social workers leue
because of low pay, high case
loads, or both.
Arizona's methods of raising
money seem truly Conservative.
It has one of the most regressive
tax systems in the country. The
State gets twice as much of its
revenue as the average State from
'regressive taxes, but only half
as much i'rom income taxes. And
since the Fannin administration j
assumed power in 1958, (he sales I
tax has risen by fifty per cent;
the property la." by one-sixth,
i The effects of this kind of tax
ation, coupled with a general re- ;
1 fusal on the part of the Slate to
; accept obligations, leads to real
! problems. In most States 50-65
per cent of the cost of elementary
and secondary education is borne!
bv the State. In Arizona, the
i State pays only about half that i
j much. This means that poorer)
I districts may not be able to ob-j
, tain an equal educational pr o-1
! gram, even with much higher tax
j rates.
University Funds Cut
! The generosity of the Sta t e j
I government is also evident in its
support of higher education. In
April of this year President Har-!
vill of the University of Arizona j
pointed out that the U of A had I
less, space per student than any i
other land-grant college in Ihcj
nation, and that unless more j
buildings were provided quickly,j
students would have to be turned
away.
Unimpressed by his testimony,
the legislature cut the year's capi
tal outlay by nearly one-half. This
eliminated plans for building an •
architecture building, and that:
college may now lose its accredi- j
tation. The student newspaper at |
the U of A asked if the people!
want nothing better than "tene-,
ment education," but the legisla-J
ture remains unruffled.
The last problem is that of Civil
Rights. Here the candidate points j
both to his own record and to that i
of his State. In Arizona, he says, j
we have learned to get along with I
each other.
OJoldwater's 'Good Deeds'
"Goldwator's Good Deeds" have
been discussed in a recent article
in the New Republic. He did not
| integrate the Arizona Nat i on a 1
Guard; he simply did not segre
! gate it when it was formed. While !
| a member of the Phoenix Cityj
Council, he did not integrate the
Phoenix airport restaurant; he
; was out of town at the time. This ;
list could be extended, but per- j
, haps the record of the State will;
I redeem the Senator.
Until the Civil Rights Act, Ari
zona had no public aecommoda
; tions law, no general fair employ
j ment practices law. and still has
no fair housing law. In the lum
bering areas, there are company j
towns which had segregated hous-!
ing, public accommodations, rec
reational facilities even segre
-1 gated work shifts at the mill. One
\ well-known Phoenix motel, the
i Camelback Inn, even refused to
I accept Jews. (Perhaps the Sena-1
| tor, being only part Jewish, es-1
! capes such discrimination.)
These arc the results of Con- 1
i servative Government. Arizonans
j can be thankful that the State
rloes accept Federal funds, for it
' would be in sadder shape with-
I out them. Yet in those areas!
! where the State has primary re
sponsibility, the results are clear. |
Arizona is saddled with an archaic
lax system, an inaedquate educa
tional system; an abysmal wel
tional system, an abysmal wel- !
teriorating, and the crime rate
is mounting. If Arizona stands as ;
a monument to Conservatism, j
I hen il Is n monument in ruins.

that in the last ten years per

risen only six per cent, while per

per cent.
They add that in 19.13 Welfare
took 27 per cent of the State budg
et; today it takes only 15 per
cent. As an example of sound
business management, they point
to administrative costs in Ari
zona. For example, in Old Age As
sistance, Arizona has the lowest
administrative cost per case in
the country.
Heavy ( use Load
These statistics can be inter
preted in a different way, for they
simply prove the complete inade
quacy of Arizona Welfare. We
have the lowest administrative
cost in OAA because we have the
highest caseload per social work
er in the nation 530. We have
the third highest caseload for Aid
to Dependent Children, and this
results in a very small percentage
of people getting off welfare. Re
habilitation is difficult in Arizona
because employee turnover is so
high the third highest in the

Nation. Most social workers leue
because of low pay, high case
loads, or both.

The Arizona State Mental Hos

Dr. William Meninger. It is un
accredited because it has only
three psychiatrists for 1,900 pa

from the 20th century.
It might seem surprising that
Arizona Conservatives enjoy talk
ing about the State welfare pro
grams. They note with approval
that in the last ten years per
capita welfare expenditures have
risen only six per cent, while per
capita income has risen fifty-three
per cent.
They add that in 19.13 Welfare
took 27 per cent of the State budg
et; today it takes only 15 per
cent. As an example of sound
business management, they point
to administrative costs in Ari
zona. For example, in Old Age As
sistance, Arizona has the lowest
administrative cost per case in
the country.
Heavy ( use Load
These statistics can be inter
preted in a different way, for they
simply prove the complete inade
quacy of Arizona Welfare. We
have the lowest administrative
cost in OAA because we have the
highest caseload per social work
er in the nation 530. We have
the third highest caseload for Aid
to Dependent Children, and this
results in a very small percentage
of people getting off welfare. Re
habilitation is difficult in Arizona
because employee turnover is so
high the third highest in the

fr
Nation. Most social workers leue
because of low pay, high case
loads, or both.
Arizona's methods of raising
money seem truly Conservative.
It has one of the most regressive
tax systems in the country. The

pointed out that the U of A had I
less, space per student than any i
other land-grant college in Ihcj
nation, and that unless more j
buildings were provided quickly,j
students would have to be turned
away.
Unimpressed by his testimony,
the legislature cut the year's capi
tal outlay by nearly one-half. This
eliminated plans for building an •
architecture building, and that:
college may now lose its accredi- j
tation. The student newspaper at |
the U of A asked if the people!
want nothing better than "tene-,
ment education," but the legisla-J
ture remains unruffled.
The last problem is that of Civil
Rights. Here the candidate points j
both to his own record and to that i
of his State. In Arizona, he says, j
we have learned to get along with I
each other.
OJoldwater's 'Good Deeds'
"Goldwator's Good Deeds" have
been discussed in a recent article
in the New Republic. He did not
| integrate the Arizona Nat i on a 1
Guard; he simply did not segre
! gate it when it was formed. While !
| a member of the Phoenix Cityj
Council, he did not integrate the
Phoenix airport restaurant; he
; was out of town at the time. This ;
list could be extended, but per- j
, haps the record of the State will;
I redeem the Senator.
Until the Civil Rights Act, Ari
zona had no public aecommoda
; tions law, no general fair employ
j ment practices law. and still has
no fair housing law. In the lum
bering areas, there are company j
towns which had segregated hous-!
ing, public accommodations, rec
reational facilities even segre
-1 gated work shifts at the mill. One
\ well-known Phoenix motel, the
i Camelback Inn, even refused to
I accept Jews. (Perhaps the Sena-1
| tor, being only part Jewish, es-1
! capes such discrimination.)
These arc the results of Con- 1
i servative Government. Arizonans
j can be thankful that the State
rloes accept Federal funds, for it
' would be in sadder shape with-
I out them. Yet in those areas!
! where the State has primary re
sponsibility, the results are clear. |
Arizona is saddled with an archaic
lax system, an inaedquate educa
tional system; an abysmal wel
tional system, an abysmal wel- !
teriorating, and the crime rate
is mounting. If Arizona stands as ;
a monument to Conservatism, j
I hen il Is n monument in ruins.
