# FISHER
## Farm Sprats Are On The Way OUT 
### ART FISHER 
At Stanford, the fraternity sys
tem is on the way OUT. The signs
are here; the proof is everywhere.
Someplace inside the vast jungle
of the Administration, deep in
the world of IN baskets and OUT
baskets, of friendly-but-firm sec
retaries, of multi-button tele
phones, the Stanford administra
tors have fallen into a decision.
Of course, in accord with policy,
| they will never announce or ex
plain it, but to the astute observ
er the facts are enough. Fraterni
ities are on the way OUT. Ex
amine the evidence.
j Fact 1: During the past two
years, in an unprecedented man
j never of psychological subver
sion, the University has struck
directly at the foundations of the
fraternity system.
PALACES ON A LAKE
With asionishing alacrity the
University has allowed the Greeks
to abandon their bottle filled
twenty tour room shacks and mi
grate to the Clusters, a group of
carpeted palaces overlooking a
lake.
Note carefully the insidious
nature of this ploy. Will the frat
i men be able to retain their for
mer distinctive style of living?
Will they as easily laugh when
brother Scurrilous G. Fratworthy
pours Julio Gallo all over th e
(hair? Will they be as quick to
write "Marmuncle 's dead
seagulls!" on a knotty pine panel?
Can they overcome?
Fad 2: In a combination dis
ciplinary action and television
tryout, the Administration last
spring, took a step of singular
courage: they booted Zeta Psi.
The Zetes are dead. New emascu
lated Zetes may reappear, but
the Zetes we knew are dead.
I Which is marvelous.
But look closely at how this
diabolical trap now awaits the
I other houses. Is this a warning,
a signal that oth -r Ira's should
find the straight and narrow?
: Will the others cleanse and anoit
themselves in solemn respect for
the fate of their departed breth
ren?
Not on your life.
Already Delta Tau Delta is hold
ing secret strategy sessions. Can
■ they cop tiie banner that the Zetes
1 held so long? They've got the
size, but what about the spark?
I Could they steal a fire truck?
CONFIDENT ACROSS TIIE
TRENCH
Across the trench Phi Delta
Theta is eager and confident, a
(regular bunch of Cassius Clays.
If anyone deserves the top spot
surely it's they.
It's as if the Yankees had sud
i denly left the American League,
| moving up and beyond.
Only AKL has no plans. They
; know they can't make it. For one
I thing, they lack internal disei
| pline.
Fact 3: Although unconfirmed
at this writing, plans are report
edly in the works to abandon the
Clusters in a few years and de
vote Lake Lag to the develop
i ment of the world's largest mos-
I quito abatement laboratory. New
J fraternity houses will be co n
jstructed at University expense
'overlooking the shores of Sears
ville Lake, approximately four
! miles away. Stanford has already
| granted permission to the Federal
' Government for the construction
of an overhead railway across the
| old Farm.
Yes, OUT. Fraternity life is on
the way OUT. But, of course,
there are significant arguments
in favor of the fraternity system.
; For fraternity men it provides
a unique opportunity to develop
close friends from among fellows
with similar basic interests.
KEEP 'EM GUESSING!
For the Stern and Toyon men
it is a clever means of getting
a lot of obnoxious types out of
the dorms. To the Wilbur man it
is steaks and free booze as long
as he can keep 'em guessing,
i which seems mutually beneficial,
i An aspect which all have over
looked, however, is the long run
! effect of the entire Stanford hous
! ing pattern. First the innocent
Freshman man is tossed into the
great Concrete and Flesh Triple
Decker Sandwiches of Wilbur
j Hall.
Every one of these boys is well
! mannered, from a clean and re
ligious American home, and al
most every one finds himself in
with a lot of animals.
He learns to adjust to no heat;
I actually lie covers as much of
the place with nudes as lie can,
and tries to forget about it.
: Gradually, he becomes acclimated.
Then bango! He goes away for
the summer and comes back to
the Cluster palace. Where do you
■ put your fire extinguisher? No
cherry bombs? No hall soccer?
No throwing knives at the doors?
Here you have to respect the
furniture, man! Be careful! Don't
just flick your ashes on the floor!
It's enough to crack the best
of the old-type fraternity mind.
If a fellow lives through an ex
perience like that, he's never able
to watch the Beverly Hillbillies
j again. Which may be a desirable
j resiill of n Stanford education.

KEEP 'EM GUESSING!

Yes, OUT. Fraternity life is on
the way OUT. But, of course,
there are significant arguments
in favor of the fraternity system.
; For fraternity men it provides
a unique opportunity to develop
close friends from among fellows
with similar basic interests.
KEEP 'EM GUESSING!
For the Stern and Toyon men
it is a clever means of getting
a lot of obnoxious types out of
the dorms. To the Wilbur man it
is steaks and free booze as long
as he can keep 'em guessing,
i which seems mutually beneficial,
i An aspect which all have over
looked, however, is the long run
! effect of the entire Stanford hous
! ing pattern. First the innocent
Freshman man is tossed into the
great Concrete and Flesh Triple
Decker Sandwiches of Wilbur
j Hall.
Every one of these boys is well
! mannered, from a clean and re
ligious American home, and al
most every one finds himself in
with a lot of animals.
He learns to adjust to no heat;
I actually lie covers as much of
the place with nudes as lie can,
and tries to forget about it.
: Gradually, he becomes acclimated.
Then bango! He goes away for
the summer and comes back to
the Cluster palace. Where do you
■ put your fire extinguisher? No
cherry bombs? No hall soccer?
No throwing knives at the doors?
Here you have to respect the
furniture, man! Be careful! Don't
just flick your ashes on the floor!
It's enough to crack the best
of the old-type fraternity mind.
If a fellow lives through an ex
perience like that, he's never able
to watch the Beverly Hillbillies
j again. Which may be a desirable
j resiill of n Stanford education.
At Stanford, the fraternity sys
tem is on the way OUT. The signs
are here; the proof is everywhere.
Someplace inside the vast jungle
of the Administration, deep in
the world of IN baskets and OUT
baskets, of friendly-but-firm sec
retaries, of multi-button tele
phones, the Stanford administra
tors have fallen into a decision.
Of course, in accord with policy,
| they will never announce or ex
plain it, but to the astute observ
er the facts are enough. Fraterni
ities are on the way OUT. Ex
amine the evidence.
j Fact 1: During the past two
years, in an unprecedented man
j never of psychological subver
sion, the University has struck
directly at the foundations of the
fraternity system.
PALACES ON A LAKE
With asionishing alacrity the
University has allowed the Greeks
to abandon their bottle filled
twenty tour room shacks and mi
grate to the Clusters, a group of
carpeted palaces overlooking a
lake.
Note carefully the insidious
nature of this ploy. Will the frat
i men be able to retain their for
mer distinctive style of living?
Will they as easily laugh when
brother Scurrilous G. Fratworthy
pours Julio Gallo all over th e
(hair? Will they be as quick to
write "Marmuncle 's dead
seagulls!" on a knotty pine panel?
Can they overcome?
Fad 2: In a combination dis
ciplinary action and television
tryout, the Administration last
spring, took a step of singular
courage: they booted Zeta Psi.
The Zetes are dead. New emascu
lated Zetes may reappear, but
the Zetes we knew are dead.
I Which is marvelous.
But look closely at how this
diabolical trap now awaits the
I other houses. Is this a warning,
a signal that oth -r Ira's should
find the straight and narrow?
: Will the others cleanse and anoit
themselves in solemn respect for
the fate of their departed breth
ren?
Not on your life.
Already Delta Tau Delta is hold
ing secret strategy sessions. Can
■ they cop tiie banner that the Zetes
1 held so long? They've got the
size, but what about the spark?
I Could they steal a fire truck?
CONFIDENT ACROSS TIIE
TRENCH
Across the trench Phi Delta
Theta is eager and confident, a
(regular bunch of Cassius Clays.

surely it's they.

Fact 3: Although unconfirmed
