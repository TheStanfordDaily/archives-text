### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
Stanlonl Junior Frank Morse was abducted and brutalk beaten
by four white youths just outside ol Marks, Mississippi, shortly
after (i p.m. last night.
Morse, a "Mississippi Freedom Project volunteer, sustained
cuts, bruises, and a slight concussion. He was not hospitalized.

THE INCIDENT occurred when*
Morse left the COFO office alone
in his car to mail letter.
Dave Harris, a Stanford s t u
dent working witii Morse in
Marks, gave (he following ac
count in a phone call to The
Daily last night.
Morse was looking for a mail
box when four white men in a
white pick-up truck forced him
off the road. They said they
wanted to "talk civil righls" with
him.
TIIE WHITES entered Morse's
car and forced him to drive out a â€¢
deserted country road. The four
then dragged Morse out of the
car and told him "if you want
some fighting we're here to give
it to you."
According to Harris, the at
tackers told Morse, " 'We don't
want any trouble; we're just here
to help you.' And then one of
the cats hit him.

Morse fell lo the ground and
assumed the protective crouch
that all Project workers are
taught to use. Two of the boys
stood over him and began to
"stomp 011 him."
Harris continued, "Then, after
being kicked in the head and
groin for awhile, Frank tried to
get up. Then they hit him and
knocked him down again. Then
two of the guys sat on him while
the others urinated on him.
"IT TOOK HIM about ten min
utes to get up, during which time
a ear drove up. stopped and then
drove past him. That's ail until
he got back here."
When Morse returned to the
COFO office in Marks, Harris
called the local sheriff to report
the beating. "This is an exact
quote of what he said to me," Har
ris related. "He said, 'So some
body got whopped, huh? What do
you expect me to do about it?' "
THE INCIDENT has, however,
been reported to the President's
Special Counsel for Civil Rights,
Lee White, at the White House,
lie pledged his full cooperation
and gave assurances that the FBI
would conduct a full investigation
of the case.
Morse was treated by a doctor
in Clarksdale, some distance from
Marks. No local doctor would
attend him, because he was a
civil rights worker. He was given
a sedative and is expected to re
cover fully.
Morse and Harris reported
Tuesday that they had received
a death threat from a group of
local whites while doing voter
registration work in Lambert,
Mississippi. Harris received an
other such threat yesterday in
nearby Vance from a white carry
ing a knife. He was told to "got
out of town and never come back."
Both Morse and Harris will re
turn to Lambert today.
Both he and Harris have been
doing voter registration work for
the Mississippi Freedom Demo
cratic Party in the Mississippi
Delta an area controlled by the
White Citizen's Council. They are
part of a six-man Stanford con
tingent which left last week to
aid the "Mississippi Freedom
Project."
The Project is short of bo th
volunteers and money, and bar
rassment seems to lie increasing
as the November 3 "Mock Flec
tion" nears.
