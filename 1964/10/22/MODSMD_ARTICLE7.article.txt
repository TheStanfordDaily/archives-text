### NANCY L. STEFFEN BARBARA SAVERY 
"It's not the blatant noise of |
the bad people that disturbs us, |
| but the thundering silence of t lie
! good people," Dr. Aaron Henry,'
leader of the Mississippi Freedom ,
I Democratic Party, remarked in
I an address on the Negro's prob- j
1 Icm in Mississippi.
Discussing the uniquely critical!
i position of the Negro in Missis- j
sippi, Aaron, President of the:
j state's NAACP, declared thai:
j "For the Mississippi Negro, the j
| civil rights movement is more
| than a matter of dignity, more!
than a matter of being allowed l '
to buy a hamburger at a lunch j
stand or to rent the bridal suite
j at the Waldorf Astoria. It is,
j purely and simply, ;i matter of |
I survival."
MISSISSIPPI, he pointed out,
j is the least prosperous state in
j the Union. "And the Negro," he
i noted, "is the least prosperous
.citizen in Mississippi." He illus
trated his point by quoting statis
' tics which listed 32 per cent of
the population as receiving Jess
than $3,000 a year, and 20 per
cent less than $2,000 a year.
"In the rural delta area where
1 come from, 51 per cent of Hie
people earn less than $1,000 a
year. The Negro," Aaron ruefully
remarked "has an affinity for the ,
i bottom."
Turning to a general discus-,
| sion of the civil rights movement,
Aaron declared that Negro rights
are long overdue, and that the
(white population owes the Negro
a debt of gratitude for condes-1
;Â«-ending to take his rights piece
meal and one at a time.
"I CAN UNDERSTAND the
historical origins of prejudice, and
I can understand, intellectually,
the reasons for white reluctance
to extend civil rights, but the
M.jhl' an- our \ ncvcrthclci and

we are Americans nevertheless,
just as the Jews and the Ger
mans and the Japanese and the
Italians are Americans. The
rights we're seeking today were
ours yesterday."
"We Negroes are not going
back to Africa, and I doubt that
the Italians will go back to Italy,
the Germans back to Germany,
or the Japanese back to Japan."
Commenting on the problem of
inter-racial hatred, Aaron pro
posed that the whites and olack
races will be forced to co-exist
peacefully in America. "Civil
rights laws will not make the
white man love, but they'll at
least keep him from lynching me
. . . and that's pretty important."
"Peaceful racial co-existence
will he difficult to achieve, but
nothing worth fighting for is
ever easy to get."
