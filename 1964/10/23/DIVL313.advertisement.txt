Divinely Sustained
"Jesus Christ iln- s.ili expression ot tilt- glorj '<i tlu Light living. ilit'
outraying ut' tin- divinfc and He is the i>erfect imprint and very image of God's
nature, upholding and maintaining atul guiding and propelling tlu- universe by llis
mighty word of power." (Hebrews l:.i)
Physicists till us that matter and etictg) .in dilit rent forms of tlu- same tiling,
that our world is a dynamic package of energy and matter and motion tied to
getlul and interrelated in such a way that it operates as ,i cohesive whole. I litis,
our whole universe is describedile in terms of a flow of energy governed by laws
and principles which appear inviolable.
Tin Hible tells un that the universe we live in i- now being dynamically sits
taineil by the power of the Word of (iod (tlu 1 .ord J».-.n- Christ). It is llis
energy, then, which restrains the nucleus and binds the atom and tin- molecule
together. It is lli~ force which directs the progression of the stars and planets,
and the tlow of time. The universe is, we see, not a cold materialistic place where
impersonal power Hows in watts and kilowatts, but a realm where a living ( iod
is now directing and sustaining and propelling everything ill a dynamic, way.
One cannot talk physics and "physical laws" in a realistic way without con
sidering tlk' sovereign God who is holy, righteous, and just, for the imprint of llis
nature is everywhere. Since the physicist must involve himself in his experiments,
he in list be willing to meet personal!) tile sovereign God of the universe before
lie can hope to uncover any of the really deep secrets of the universe.
A day is coming, sajs the Bible, when the binding forces ot the atom will be
unloosed'and the latent forces of the nucleus released for the purpose of cleansing
and renovating this corrupted earth. This i-» tile warning of both the < >ld and New
Testaments:
"The Lord is not slow about llis promise as sonic count slowness, but is for
bearing toward you, nut wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach
repentance. Hut the day of the Lord will conic like a thief, atul tin- heavens will
pass awii* with a loud noise, and the elements wil be dissolved (literally in Greek,
"unloosed"') with lire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will bi
burned up." (_' Peter .3:9-10)
"For behold, the Lord will come in fire, and llis chariots like the -torm wind,
to render llis anger iti fury, and llis rebuke with flames of tire, lor by lire will
the Lord execute judgment . . . For as the new heavens and the new earth which
1 will make shall remain before tin.says the Lord, so shall your descendants and
vottr name remain. From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath,
all flesh shall come to worship before inc." (Isaiah 66:13-Jo)
The earth is one da) to be purged ot -in, death, unbelief, and idolatrv by the
lire of judgment which the living (iod will unloose in a moments time. Won't
you therefore be reconciled to God by acknowledging Jesus ( lirist as your own
Lord. Become a living, vital part of God's universe, which is d>namically sustained.
Meet the Director and Sustainer Himself, the Lord Jesus Christ.
