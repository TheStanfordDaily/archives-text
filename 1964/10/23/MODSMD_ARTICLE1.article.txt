TOKYO — Russia's strong boxers a n d

skilled gymnasts ait* expected to provide
enough medals to surpass the America total
Friday while the major East-West confronta
tion takes place on the basketball court as
the Tokyo Olympics reach their last full day
of competition.
The Russians, who added medals with
startling rapidity in gymnastics and canoeing
yesterday, are virtually assured of moving
ahead of the U.S. total. But for the first time
since the 19">2 Games at Helsinki their gold
medal total may fall short of America's.
U.S. forces collected two surprise medals
in women's canoeing yesterday as Marcia
Jones of Oklahoma City placed third in the
kayak singles and the women's kayak doubles
team of Gloria Ferrier and Francine Fox of
Washington, D.C., placed second.
That lifted America's over-all medal total to
88 34 gold, 26 silver and 28 bronze. Russia,
however, marshalled her forces in t lie sports
considered minor to Americans, won 13 medals
and lifted its total to 77, including 23 gold. 21
silver and 33 bronze.
