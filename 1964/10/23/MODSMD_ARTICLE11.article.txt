# Morse Is In Rapid Recovery
## Sends Message From Mississippi 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
Frank Morse, a Stanford jun
ior who was abducted and
beaten by lour Mississippi
\\ lutes Tuesday night, is recov
ering rapidly from the effects of
the attack.
In a phone conversation with
The Daily yesterday, Morse re
ported he is "just fine," except
for a slight headache and some
facial bruises.
BOTH MORSE and his fellow
rights worker Dave Harris re
turned to Lambert, Mississippi,
yesterday to distribute leaflets
for the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party. There were no
incidents.
The FBI and the Justice Depart
ment are presently investigating
the Tuesday beating. Harris, how
ever, suggested that the FBI man,
who is based in Clarksdale, was
less than totally cooperative.
Harris commented, "He looked
as if he were going to type up his
report and file it in the waste
basket. ... At one point we tested
him. We introduced him to one of
the local Negro volunteers and
he got very angry and called him
'Nigger' and refused to shake his
hand. . . . Later on one of our
guys heard him say, 'If those
guys are looking for trouble we're
going to give it to them.' "
MORSE AM) HARRIS expect
to leave Mississippi on Saturday,
arriving here sometime late Mon
day. Three other Stanford stu
dents now working in the state,
Marli Schenk, Mitch Miller, a n d
Doug Sorenson will return with
them. A sixth student, Ron Kauf
man, will stay in Columbus, Mis
sissippi, where he is presently
based.
Elsewhere in the state, the sit
uation appears relatively calm.
However, Jackson COFO re
ported that a crop dusting plane
dropped an explosive charge on
a Indianola, Mississippi, Freedom
School gathering today. There
were no immediate reports of
damage or injuries.
The plane first buzzed the
group and dropped a flare. On
the second pass, it dropped a
charge. After the explosion, a car
full of local whites who had been
surveying the gathering sped
away at high speed. The incident
lias been reported, but there has
been no action by the local police
so far.
