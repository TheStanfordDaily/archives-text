# Economist Sees More Expansion Throughout l965
## 
### 
Barring a prolonged strike at
home or war abroad, economic ex
pansion will continue throughout
1965 — but at progressively slow
er rates as the year rolls by, pre
dicts Prof. Ezra Solomon of the
Stanford Graduate School of
Business.
"Swift enactment of a $3 to $4
billion cut in excise taxes may
well be in order by mid-year," he
contends.
Increased consumer spending
for nondurable goods and ser
vices will account for most of the
expansion, Solomon says. These
two large components of the na
tional economy have grown by
approximately $20 billion in the
past year alone. In 1965 they'll
expand by another $22 billion, the
Stanford expert estimates.
UNSPENT PORTIONS of re
cently enacted tax cuts will enable
consumers to step up their buy
ing of nondurable goods and ser
vices, while sustaining the cur
rent high rate of spending for
cars and other durables, lie ex
plains.
But as 1965 rolls by, the quar
ter-to-quarter increases in con
sumer spending will diminish as
the effect of the tax cut wears
off.
Stepped-up spending by state
and local governments also
brightens the outlook for 1965,
in Solomon's opinion. By the end
of 1965, state and local purchases
of goods and services may move
ahead of those by the federal gov
ernment. This has not been the
case since 1911, Solomon notes.
BUSINESS INVESTMENT in
plant and equipment is likely to
stabilize through most of 1965 at
a level "somewhat higher" than
the $46 billion annual rate anti
cipated for the current quarter,
he says.
