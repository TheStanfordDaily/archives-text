# JAZZ TRACK
## Jamal 'Exciting' At New Club 
### RICK BALE 
KDITOK'S NOTK: Kick Bale's
| program JAZZ TRACK appears
on KZSU Thursday evenings at
I seven.
To t lie Internal Revenue Ser-
I vice he is Christopher Jones, but
I to Argo records and the rest of
I tiie jazz world, he is Ahmad Ja
mal. He is this country's top sell
ing jazz artist and is currently
appearing at Basin Street West.
Jamal is one of those rare jazz
| musicians whose sound is immedi
| ately appealing to a wide audi
| ence. He shares with Krrol Gar
ner a melodiousness and rhyth
mic drive that is readily commu
nicative.
I EXPERIENCED the Jamal
sound in person for the first time
Saturday night, atid the excite
ment is not to be found in even
the most careful listenings of his
recordings. The trio, with Jamal
on piano, Janil Nasser on bass,
and Chuck Lampkin on drums,
is so integrated that often there
is an effect of one instrument
rather than three.
Jamal's spare, abbreviated style,
what Time magazine once called
"syncopated silence," leaves a
| great burden of melodic line and
I pulse to his sidemen, and in past
years this has been handled bril
liantly by Israel Crosby on bass
and Vernell Fournier on drums.
Nasser, who took over on bass
after Crosby's death, was let
loose only once during the Satur
day night set, as the rest of his
"solos" were done jointly with
Lampkin. Nasser's solo, which
came in the middle of the second
number, was extremely lyrical i
and sensitive, but he seems less j
inclined to force his position in j
i the group than Crosby.
THE RHYTHMIC drive pro- ;
' vided by Lampkin, an ex-Dizzy
Gillespie man who replaced Four- j
nier, is nothing short of fantastic.
; More than Fournier. he has the !
j ability to build in and around the ■
dynamics, and is adept at the Ja- *
mal concept of the increasing ex-:
citement of a number from start
I to finish.
All in all, Jamal's new group is
one of the most dynamic and
emotional in jazz, and you
i shouldn't miss it. Sets continue
i over the weekend, and the earlier ;
I you get there in the evening, the
! better chance you'll have for sure
I seating.
BASIN STREET WEST, where
! Jamal is appearing, is the newest
' addition to the San Francisco jazz j
j scene. Converted from a restau
! rant on Broadway and Montgom-1
: ery in North Beach, its original
scheduled included both popular
and jazz artists. However, a last
minute switch of ownership was j
followed by the conversion of the ;
: program to all jazz.
The club is now owned by Jack j
Yanoff, an ex-jazz club owner j
from Denver, and Ted Levin, who
also owns the Peppermint Tree.
I They boldly decided to outfit the '
j club expensively, with an excel
j lent sound system, plush carpet-:
j ing and seating.
As opposed to most clubs, there
is little elbow pushing, as plenty
of space has been allowed on
three decks for over 300 people.
There is a minimum, but no door
or cover charge.
AFTER JAMAL will follow
Jon Hendricks & Co. on November
4, Sonny Rollins on November 2i5,
and the Jazz Crusaders opening
on December 9. After the first of
the year Anita O'Day, Dizzy Gil
lespie, Oscar Peterson, Jimmy
Smith, the Modern Jazz Quartet,
Miles Davis, and George Shearing
will appear.
Opening at the Jazz Workship
Tuesday was Chet Baker, who
has recently switched from trum
pet to Flugelhorn. In the early fif
ties, Baker's trumpet found a
great deal of success, especially
during his stint with the Gerry
Mulligan quartet.
Then, during a European tour
of 1956, Baker suffered a severe

shock at the death of his pianist i
and closest friend, Dick Twardzik.
After a brief return to the States,
he returned to Europe for several
long hard years of bad health as
well as a prison term in Italy be
fore returning to the U.S. last
spring.
BAKER'S STYLE is part of a
school of jazz that looks as much
toward the past as it does to the
future. This sort of neo-classic;
movement treats modern material
in a traditional context, and finds
its roots in the prewar playing
of Lester Young and Bix Beider
beeke.
Baker's playing since his return
is reportedly much more virile
while retaining its lyrical quali
ties, and he and his Flugelhorn
will continue sets over the week
end.
Barnaby Conrad's El Matador,
which for twelve years existed as
a bar with John Cooper on piano
and bullfight movies every Sun
day afternoon, seems to have
started off in a Latin vein with
its recent varied music policy.

Brazilian singer-guitarist Juno
Gilberto opened the "ncnv" club
a few weeks ago and was followed
by countryman Bola Sete with
Vince Guaraldi. Now appearing
is the famous flamenco guitarist
.Juan Serrano, who will be fol
lowed in a few weeks with a re
turn engagement of Gilberto.
Al the Berkeley Community
Theater Saturday at 8:30 and the
Masonic Sunday at 8:00 will be
saxophonist Stan (Jet/ and hi s
quartet with singer Astrud Gil
berto of "Girl from Ipanema"
fame. I recommend catching
them now, as it looks as though
they will be leaving the Bay Area
soon for an extended tour. Tickets
will reportedly be available at the
door.
Singer-pianist Bob Dorough and
guitarist Al Shackman close out
their stay at the Trident in Sau
salito over the weekend. Every
one there is very excited over the
return of pianist Jean Hoffman
for an eight week stand begin
ning Tuesday. Much more will be
said about this girl in later weeks.

and the Jazz Crusaders opening
on December 9. After the first of
the year Anita O'Day, Dizzy Gil
lespie, Oscar Peterson, Jimmy
Smith, the Modern Jazz Quartet,
Miles Davis, and George Shearing
will appear.
Opening at the Jazz Workship
Tuesday was Chet Baker, who
has recently switched from trum
pet to Flugelhorn. In the early fif
ties, Baker's trumpet found a
great deal of success, especially
during his stint with the Gerry
Mulligan quartet.
Then, during a European tour
of 1956, Baker suffered a severe

shock at the death of his pianist i
and closest friend, Dick Twardzik.
After a brief return to the States,
he returned to Europe for several
long hard years of bad health as
well as a prison term in Italy be
fore returning to the U.S. last
spring.
BAKER'S STYLE is part of a
school of jazz that looks as much
toward the past as it does to the
future. This sort of neo-classic;
movement treats modern material
in a traditional context, and finds
its roots in the prewar playing
of Lester Young and Bix Beider
beeke.
Baker's playing since his return
is reportedly much more virile
while retaining its lyrical quali
ties, and he and his Flugelhorn
will continue sets over the week
end.

sound in person for the first time
Saturday night, atid the excite
ment is not to be found in even
the most careful listenings of his
recordings. The trio, with Jamal
on piano, Janil Nasser on bass,
and Chuck Lampkin on drums,
is so integrated that often there
is an effect of one instrument
rather than three.
Jamal's spare, abbreviated style,
what Time magazine once called
"syncopated silence," leaves a
| great burden of melodic line and
I pulse to his sidemen, and in past
years this has been handled bril
liantly by Israel Crosby on bass
and Vernell Fournier on drums.
Nasser, who took over on bass
after Crosby's death, was let
loose only once during the Satur
day night set, as the rest of his
"solos" were done jointly with
Lampkin. Nasser's solo, which
came in the middle of the second

on December 9. After the first of
the year Anita O'Day, Dizzy Gil
lespie, Oscar Peterson, Jimmy
Smith, the Modern Jazz Quartet,
Miles Davis, and George Shearing
will appear.
Opening at the Jazz Workship
Tuesday was Chet Baker, who
has recently switched from trum
pet to Flugelhorn. In the early fif
ties, Baker's trumpet found a
great deal of success, especially
during his stint with the Gerry
Mulligan quartet.
Then, during a European tour
of 1956, Baker suffered a severe

shock at the death of his pianist i
and closest friend, Dick Twardzik.
After a brief return to the States,
he returned to Europe for several
long hard years of bad health as
well as a prison term in Italy be
fore returning to the U.S. last
spring.
BAKER'S STYLE is part of a
school of jazz that looks as much
toward the past as it does to the
future. This sort of neo-classic;
movement treats modern material
in a traditional context, and finds
its roots in the prewar playing
of Lester Young and Bix Beider
beeke.
Baker's playing since his return
is reportedly much more virile
while retaining its lyrical quali
ties, and he and his Flugelhorn
will continue sets over the week
end.

To t lie Internal Revenue Ser-
I vice he is Christopher Jones, but
I to Argo records and the rest of
I tiie jazz world, he is Ahmad Ja
mal. He is this country's top sell
ing jazz artist and is currently
appearing at Basin Street West.
Jamal is one of those rare jazz
| musicians whose sound is immedi
| ately appealing to a wide audi
| ence. He shares with Krrol Gar
ner a melodiousness and rhyth
mic drive that is readily commu
nicative.
I EXPERIENCED the Jamal
sound in person for the first time
Saturday night, atid the excite
ment is not to be found in even
the most careful listenings of his
recordings. The trio, with Jamal
on piano, Janil Nasser on bass,
and Chuck Lampkin on drums,
is so integrated that often there
is an effect of one instrument
rather than three.
Jamal's spare, abbreviated style,
what Time magazine once called
"syncopated silence," leaves a
| great burden of melodic line and
I pulse to his sidemen, and in past
years this has been handled bril
liantly by Israel Crosby on bass
and Vernell Fournier on drums.
Nasser, who took over on bass
after Crosby's death, was let
loose only once during the Satur
day night set, as the rest of his
"solos" were done jointly with
Lampkin. Nasser's solo, which
came in the middle of the second
number, was extremely lyrical i
and sensitive, but he seems less j
inclined to force his position in j
i the group than Crosby.
THE RHYTHMIC drive pro- ;
' vided by Lampkin, an ex-Dizzy
Gillespie man who replaced Four- j
nier, is nothing short of fantastic.
; More than Fournier. he has the !
j ability to build in and around the ■
dynamics, and is adept at the Ja- *
mal concept of the increasing ex-:
citement of a number from start
I to finish.
All in all, Jamal's new group is
one of the most dynamic and
emotional in jazz, and you
i shouldn't miss it. Sets continue

! better chance you'll have for sure
