# Intramurals Pick Up New Momentum
## 
### TOM EDISON 
With the second week of intra
mural football completed things
are starting to take shape; the
players have been separated
from the prayers.
Several ball clubs have made
impressive showings, but each
league still has two or three un
defeated teams. Next week should
produce a clear picture of which
are the strongest ball clubs in
each league.
The Phi Kap squad, which is
one of four ball clubs having a
3-0 record, is currently leading its j
league and seems to possess a j

well-balanced offensive team hav
ing won their last two games by
substantial margins, 24-6 and 15-0.
In three tilts they have only
been scored upon twice; once in
their first game in which they
were tied 6-6 but later won in
overtime.
Theta Chi, also boasting three
straight victories, is a light ball
! club averaging around 155 pounds
j per man but possesses more than
I adequate speed.
Defensively they rely primar
! ily on their speed and quick de
| fensive reactions. Offensively
j quarterbacks John Pace and Bob
; Vukhalovish, provide the needed
j experience for wide-open football.
Sigma Chi is currently waging
J a battle against Theta Chi 112 or
leadership rights in League No.
1. Sigma Chi is basically an offen
sive squad, winning their first
two games, 14-6 and 26-6. Jack
Owens, the prime receiver for
its two quarterbacks, Paul Hazel
rig and Bruce Hagensou, provides
the squad with key aerial
! strength.
| Two freshman teams, Rincon
| ada and Soto, are developing two
; fine looking squads. Soto added
a third plus mark after their
name by defeating a strong Ar
royo team last Wednesday. El
I Toro and El Capitan are c u r-
I rently commanding the lead spots
i in League No. 7. El Capitan is led
I by 6'S" quarterback John Murray.
