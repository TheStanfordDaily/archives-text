### 
Tom Ross, a 220 pound, 6'4"
junior from Sacramento lettered
last season. Ho saw little action
in the early games, but played
95 minutes in the last four. This
season Tom started playing most
ly at defense, but has lately been
switched to the offensive unit.
Tom has speed, size, and desire,
the requisites of a good lineman.
