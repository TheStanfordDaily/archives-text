# Notre Dame Offense, Defense Ready To Go
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's football team sport
ing a 2-3 record will he hard
pressed this Saturday to post vic
tory number three. The Indians
play Notre Dame at South Bend.
THE MOST exciting part of the
game for Stanford fans may be
the battle between the nation's
leading rusher, Ray Handley, and
the nation s best rushing defense,
the Notre Dame line.
Handley has 530 yards rushing,
leading the number two man by
two yards. Notre Dame's defen
sive wall, on the other hand, has
allowed a measely 33.5 yards per
game on the ground.
The four opponents of the Irish
have attempted 126 rushing plavs
and have scrounged but 134 yards
This is an average gain of 1.06
yards per play.
The Stanford defense is not a
pushover either. In their last
two outings they have given up

13 points. Last week against
Washington the defense, even
though they had the goal line
constantly at their back, let Wash
ington have only one touchdown.
THE DEFENSE has put forth
outstanding performances in each
of the last two tussles. Coach
John Ralston singled out line
backer Jack Chappie and defen
sive guard Tom Ross as doing
especially fine jobs.

The entire team will have to
bo at. its best to comtain the po
tent Irish attack. John Huarte
! leads the attack from his quarter
hack spot. He is in fourteenth
place among the nation's total off
ense leaders.
Huarte has gained most of his
yardage through the air lanes.
With 215 lb. split-end Jack Snow
as his target, Huarte has com
pleted 41 of 74 passes for 099
yards and eight touchdowns. Five
of those touchdowns have been
from the Huarte-Snow combina
tion.
SNOW is the number four pass
receiver in the nation. He has

snagged 26 tosses for 482 yards
and five touchdowns. Yardage
wise the big end from Long Beach,
Calif, is number two.
In the team category, Notre
Dame ranks tenth for passing
offense. They have averaged 176.5
yards per game, throwing the ball
20 times per game.
The Stanford offense, riding
mostly on the shoulders of Ray
Handley, was flying high un t i 1
last weekend. The Huskies, by
controlling the ball most of the
time, held the Indians to 167
yards. Before that, Stanford had
been grinding out nearly 350
yards per outing.
DEFINITELY unfavorable to
ihe Indians are the injuries to
Bruce Kehrli and Gary Rounsa
ville. Both are firststringers.
Kehrli is the starting guard and
Rounsaville starting defensive
end.
Larry Volmert will replace
Kehrli and A 1 Wilburn, Rounsa
ville. Both replacements are

sophomores.
If Stanford's offense is up to
past performances and the de
fense plays as well as it has been
Ihe last two games Stanford fans
can look for an exciting game.

to date on Saturday's football
game against Notre Dame, KCBS
Kadio of San Francisco will be in
South Bend to broadcast the
game. Broadcast time will be
11:10 a.m. (PDT).
