## Johnson Administration Active In Military Use Of Space Race 
### 
Dear Sir:
As the election draws nigh, it
is perhaps inevitable that the ma
nure begin to fly. Even so, I was
disappointed to read the second
article you have run in the last
week which could only charitably
he described as poorly informed.
Mr. Weinig asks if the U.S. is in
the wrong space race. To the ex
tent that he questions the desir
ability of American attempts to
put a man on the moon this dec
ade. 1 am in accord with him. His
article is, however, discursive.
Mr. Weinig makes four tenuously
related points: 1 t the Kennedy*
Jo h n so n administration has
"steadfastly refused to explore
military (space» capabilities," 2>
an orbital bomb or space platform
for launching nuclear missiles is
desirable, 3) the electromagnetic
pulse effect of nuclear missiles
is desireable, 3> the electromag
netic pulse effect of nuclear
weapons could vitiate our land
based strategic forces, and 4) the
American command and control
system is "risky."
Contrary to Mr. Weinig's flat
assertion, the Kennedy-Johnson
administration has extensively
utilized space for military pur
poses. Circling the earth now are
Midas infra-red reeonnaisance
satellites, the elaborite Samos,
successor to the U-2, Transit mili
tary navigation satellites, a n d
prototype military communica
tions satellites. Even the Tiros
and N'imbus meteorological satel
lites have important war time
missions. Compared to ours, the
Soviet military space effort is
small (though significant).
None of the above systems are
orbital weapons. Why? Because
both the eounterforce and retalia
tory mission can be more effec
tively and cheaply accomplished
from the earth. It is superfluous
and provoking to orbit a huge
bomb when, after absorbing a So
viet strike, we can already oblit
erate their society. The counter
force (i.e., counter military) mis
sion requires high payload, high
accuracy, invulnerability, coor
dination, and surprise — all of
which are considerably m or e
cheaply obtained by land and sea
based forces.
Electromagnetic pulse effects
are unknown. A Soviet test of
their effects on missile electron
ics would require a detectable
violation of the partial test: ban
treaty. In order that the Soviet
Union not be tempted to gamble
on unknown weapons effects, we
have incr eased the number a n d
disposal of our Minutemen and
ordered construction of 15 addi
tional Polaris submarines.
Construction of an effective
command and control system is
difficult. It means that respon
sible decision makers must have
the information available to make
coordinated decisions and that
they be able to implement their
decisions. Recognizing the vital

importance of command and con
trol. McNamara has spent billions
more on this alone than was
spent under Eisenhower. It. is
naive to assume, with Mr. Weinig,
that killing the President would
paralyze the system. As long as
he is alive, however, the Presi
dent alone must be responsible
for decisions which could plunge
the United States into a thermo
! nuclear holocaust.

• Orbital Weapons—No. 2
Dear Sir:
Mr. Weinig's comments on nu
i clear weapons in orbit reveal a
' technical knowledge based on
I thorough study of the right-wing
I press. Only in the columns of Da
vid Lawrence and the National
; Review do H-bombs emit an
"electromagnetic pulse" which
; can destroy hardened missile
sites at a distance of 20 miles.
This is not to say that orbital
, weapons cannot destroy civilian
targets. They can. However it is
the opinion of our currect admin
i istration that this job can be bet
ter handled by earth-based sys
j tems, which arc:
<ai Cheaper (I list this first in
1 deference to the right-wing ethic.»
(b) Far more dependable (or
bital devices must be completely
remote-controlled and sharply
limited in weight.)
(c> Less subject to enemy coun-
I ter-actions (because an orbital
weapon moves in an orbit it is
j a sitting duck, at least relative
Ito a?i earth launched missile
which can take evasive action and
emit decoys. We now possess an
| effective anti-orbital weapon, but
j development of an anti-missile
j missile has proved impossible.)
(d i Immune from communica
| tion interference. (An orbital
weapon, in contrast to an earth
launched missile, must he trig
gered by a radio command. A
single nuclear explosion in space
i could render all such weapons
; communicationless and hence use
; less. This is why the Minuteman
■and Titan systems have exclu
sively internal navigation a n d
' firing mechanisms.)
It is true that the United States
could now put large nuclear war
j heads into orbit. Russia would
I then undoubtedly answer in kind,
l and we would be that much closer
to the atomic showdown which
: Mr. Weinig and Mr. Goldwater
| seem afraid of missing. We could
I also give control of our nuclear
I arsenal to such dependable and
level-headed NATO field-comman
ders as General Walker, who, as
I a hero of the right-wing should
| occupy a position of trust in the
forth-coming Goldwater adminis
tration. Then, according to Mr.
Weinig's rules of logic, we will
have eliminated the risks con
nected with the present system.

• AEC Security—Reply
Dear Sir:
Mr. George E. Felling claimed
yesterday to have read both my
column of October 20 and the
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of
May, finding me to have "warped"
the statements of the latter. Mr.
Felling, however, ran and does
bring this off only by misquoting
the Bulletin article, misconstru
ing my statements, and misunder
standing the requisites of secur
ity programs. He is the one guilty
of "deliberate warping" — even
of shooting from the hip.
(It Mr. Felling says: "Mr. Bo
nine does not mention that | Har
old | Green is the author of the
article. . . ." My paragraph im
mediately following my quotation
began: "The auth or, Harold
Green . . ."
(2) Mr. Felling quotes Green
as saying the AEC's program is
"one of the most |Green said
"more" | stringent and effective."
But that meant relative to some
other programs. For Green also
said: "A person with substan
tially derogatory information in
his background has a much
greater chance of obtaining an
AEC Q-elearanee than a 'secret'
clearance from almost any other
government agency. I am person
ally aware of several cases in
which the AEC has granted clear
ance to persons unable to obtain
clearance in other agencies or per
sons who were discharged on se
curity grounds by other agencies."
(3) Mr. Felling correctly quotes
Green that there is "no known
instance of subversive penetra
tion of the AEC program in its 17
year history." The facts disagree,
but in any case that is only one
aspect of security. Green says:
"Derogatory information involv
ing . . . falsification of personnel
security questionnaires, mental
illness, alcoholism, and drug ad
diction" are some of the ot her
categories which create a "pre
sumption of security risk."
(4) Of the AEC's "stringency,"
Green says: "Many persons were
cleared despite a finding of truth
in allegations of a great deal of
seriously derogatory informa
tion." Furthermore, "the percent
age of derogatory information
cases cleared has been substan
tially higher |since 19571 than in
the earlier period." The AEC pro
gram, Green feels, has acquired
a greater degree of "understand
ing," and "compassion," as well
as "sophistication and courage."
Of this trend, Green said in an
interview: "The essence of my
argument is that the AEC pro
gram is illustrative of what is
happening throughout Govern
ment security programs."
I call that "going on the rocks."
Green calls it "sophistication."
Did you really read either my
column or Green's article, Mr.
Felling? JOHN E. BON INK
