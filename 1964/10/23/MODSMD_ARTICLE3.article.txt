# Crises Center Explains Reasons For 'K' Ouster
## 
### 
"Khrushchev w as ousted October 13 because the Soviets, quite
I l ankly, wanted a change." That was the feeling of Stanford pro
lessors Jan Triska, \\ itokl SworaKowski, and Milorad Drachko

NSA's newly launched Crisis Cen

search packets were distributed
to the audience. Many students
