## Dirty Campaign Continues; MAMA Presents 'Choice' By Steve Leopold 
### 
Now it's official.
To the surprise of no one, the Fair Campaign Practices Com
mittee yesterday concluded that this is indeed a "dirty campaign.
"The use of guilt by association, fraudulent documentation, cruel
and unusual punishment of whipping boys, and evasion of dif
ferences may be setting a record," continued this year's over-

worked committee. ■*
And the campaign will get dir
tier, unless as Newsweek maga

put their sexsational thriller
"Choice" on the air.
"Choice" Previews
The previews have set libidos
afire across the nation: topless
bathing suits, pornographic liter
ature, call girls, Twisters, beer
can tossing teenagers in I) lack
sedans; all face the stern wrath
of the "Moral" Mothers who, of
course, in their day never drank
bathtub gin, danced the Big
Apple, sang "Anything Goes." or
swooned over Frank Sinatra.
No, they were too busy at home,
knitting American flags, reading
Lassie and humming "Nearer My
God To Thee." Every once in a
while the spectre of some evil
would drive them out of their
saintly dens, but always the cru
sade was too limited in scope —
against alcohol, immigrants, or
crafty commies.
Today, these would-be deliver
ers have finally found an evil suf
ficiently grandiose for their
thunderous wrath American
society itself. Of course, for such
a crusade, there must be a pro
phet, and only a traitorous com
symp wouldn't know who that
might be. But just to make sure
no one is confused as to which
man is morally fit to be Presi
dent. MAMA has decided to show
us our "Choice."

"Messiah" Goldwater
Barry Goldwater, the silver
maned Messiah, is depicted as
heir apparent to the throne va
cated by the Founding Fathers
(say, wasn't Ben Franklin sup
posed to be something of a play
boy, not to mention that misce
genation-monger Thomas Jeffer
son?), the soldiers at Valley
Forge and Abraham Lincoln.
Lyndon Johnson does not come
off so well. By the time the Moral
Mothers are finished with him,
he has become the pornographer's
President, not the people's.
But, alas, it is not to be. Sena
tor Goldwater has decided that
the hedonist vote in America is
too powerful to attack directly
that is. Thus, he ducks another
issue by making snide remarks
about "buddyism" instead of let
ting MAMA show us the real
thing.
What Might Have Been
Just imagine what might have
been—and what still can be if the
hedonist lobby can make the NBC
censors and candidate Goldwater
sec the light!
Raymond Massey, Stove Pipe
hat and all, intones the Declara
tion of Independence, as the cam
era pans from the furrowed brow
of Senator Goldwater to a picture
of Luci Johnson, clad in a top
less bathing suit, a reefer in one
hand, a copy of Fanny Hill in the
other, doing the monkey with
Water Jenkins atop a black
limousine roaring across the beer
can laden Texas plain.
But we'll never see it. Even
Goldwater is too moral to let the
Moral Mothers have their day on
TV.
In his heart, he must know
that most Americans prefer smut
to nuts.
