# WOMEN'S COUNCIL
## Usual Result Of Lateness: Charges Of 'Poor Judgement' 
### SUE DALEY 
About 80 per cent of Women's Council cases
involve charges of "gross negligence," a serious
carelessness: or "poor judgment." a sincere but
faulty decision which usually results in lateness.
"Council charges a girl with a violation when
it feels she has not done her best to prevent it
from occurring," explains Caroline Ward, Wom
en's Council member. If she has been the victim of
circumstances beyond her control, the violation
may be removed from her record.
IN HEARING a case Women's Council seeks
to establish:
• The nature of the violation (the charge if
one is called for*.
• The girl's general awareness of time and of
problems which might hinder her return.
• The girl's responsibility for the violation.
"LESS THAN I'IVIO girls a year appear before
Council again after a warning of one quarter of
probation," says Miss Ward. "Such a reprimand
means that any other Fundamental Standard vio
lation during the period of her probation will be
considered more serious because she has been
warned."
The following examples are given by Miss
Ward as representative of violations which might
bring a woman before the council:

"NORA, A SENIOR, was late. She and her
date fell asleep in the car. At 2:.1(i a.m. she was J
located by the police, and she returned home,"

said Miss Ward.
"She was placed on probation for one quarter
because she abdicated responsibility for herself
by falling asleep.
"A girl is expected to come home if she can
not stay awake," explains Miss Ward.
IN ANOTHKII CASK, "Caroline, a freshman,
failed to sign out for an overnight," described
Miss Ward.
"She had planned to leave for home after her
Saturday class but changed her mind and didn't
signout. She changed her plans and went home
without signing out. When she returned the next
day she indicated her failure to sign out."
She received probation for one quarter.
POOR JtJDGMKNT
IN A CASIO of "poor judgment." "Fran, a
sophomore, attended a party which later moved to
another location. She did not change her signout
when she returned home for dinner, and returned
to the party where her date drank heavily," said
Miss Ward.
"She tried to awaken him at 1:50 a.m., but he
was sick when he awoke.
"She got him into the car about 2:.5(l and said
she wanted to call the dormitory. He said they
would be home shortly, so she did not call."
"Fran u°t in later than had been anticipated,"
said Miss Ward. "The Council felt that Fran had
made a valid attempt to jjcl herself home on time
twhich partially mitigated her violation," she said.
Fran was placed on probation for ' weeks.

About 80 per cent of Women's Council cases
involve charges of "gross negligence," a serious
carelessness: or "poor judgment." a sincere but
faulty decision which usually results in lateness.
"Council charges a girl with a violation when
it feels she has not done her best to prevent it
from occurring," explains Caroline Ward, Wom
en's Council member. If she has been the victim of
circumstances beyond her control, the violation
may be removed from her record.
IN HEARING a case Women's Council seeks
to establish:
• The nature of the violation (the charge if
one is called for*.
• The girl's general awareness of time and of
problems which might hinder her return.
• The girl's responsibility for the violation.
"LESS THAN I'IVIO girls a year appear before
Council again after a warning of one quarter of
probation," says Miss Ward. "Such a reprimand
means that any other Fundamental Standard vio
lation during the period of her probation will be
considered more serious because she has been
warned."
The following examples are given by Miss
Ward as representative of violations which might
bring a woman before the council:
