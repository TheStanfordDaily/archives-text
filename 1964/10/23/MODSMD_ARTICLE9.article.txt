"Religious Roots," a historical:
overview of world religions, was

Roots and Modern Practice" pre
sented last night by the Baha'i
Club.
Dr. Dwight Allen, Chairman of
the National Advisory Committee i
on Education for the Baha'i's, was
speaker for the opening talk.
DR. ALLEN stressed that the
concepts of the various religions'
of the world are basically the :
same, differing only in their con
text. He explained that God's rev-J
elations were on two levels: spirit-;
ual and social.
"Man's relation to God will al- j
ways be the same. . . . Man's |
relation to other men will change j
as conditions change." The differ
ences in religious practices are
due to different understandings
of the revelations of God.
Dr. Allen gave his own defini
tion of religion: "Religion is the
belief in spiritual beings." As
man's ideas of the supernatural
change, "religion becomes the ex
ploitation or investigation of the
sacred in man's behalf."

tained that we must always
search for the common denom
inator, keeping in mind the dif
ferent context for the same basic
concepts.
The series will cover Hinduism, I
Judaism, Buddhism. Christianity. ;
