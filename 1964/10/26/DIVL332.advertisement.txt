A Letter From John
Christ was alive when the world began, yet I myself have
seen Him with my own eyes and listened to Him speak. I
have touched Him with my own hands. He is God's Message
of Life. The One Who is Life from God has been shown to us
and we guarantee that we have seen Him; I am speaking
of Christ, Who is eternal Life. He was with the Father and
then was shown to us. Again I say, we are telling you about
what we ourselves have actually seen and heard, so that you
may share the fellowship and the joys we have with the
Father and with Jesus Christ His Son. And if you do as I say
in this letter, then you, too, will be full of joy, and so will we.
This is the message God has given us to pass on to you:
That God is Light and in Him is no darkness at all. So if we
say we are His friends, but go on living in spiritual darkness
and sin, we are lying. But if we are living in the light of
God's presence, just as Christ does then we have wonderful
fellowship and joy with each other, and the blood of Jesus
His Son cleanses us from every sin. If we say that we have no
sin, we are only foolingo urselves, and refusing to accept the
truth. But if we confess our sins to Him, He can be depended
on to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from every wrong.
And it is perfectly proper for God to do this for us because
Christ died to wash away our sins. If we claim we have not
sinned, we are lying and calling God a liar, for He says we
have sinned.
I
My little children, I am telling you this so that you will
stay away from sin. But if you sin, there is Someone to plead
for you before the Father. His name is Jesus Christ, the One
Who is all that is good and Who pleases God completely.
He is the One took God's wrath against our sins upon Him
self, and brought us into fellowship with God; and He for
gave not only our sins, but also the sins of all the world.
(First Epistle of John, 1, 2; Living Letters)
