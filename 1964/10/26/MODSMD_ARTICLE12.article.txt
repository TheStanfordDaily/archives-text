## 
### SUE DALEY 
Women's Council cases invoh ing charges of "deliberate dis
regard" occur much less often than those dealing with "gross
negligence* or "poor judgment, ' but are usually more serious in
nature because they involve an intentional violation of social regu
lations, according to Kate Bransten, Women's Council member.

This charge may involve the*
following decisions on the girl's!
part, Miss Bransten said:
• Decision to take a few late
minutes, even though she is able j
to return to her dormitory in time '
to sign in by 2:30.
• Decision to disregard house ;
or University rules.
• Decision to ignore her late |
minutes when signing in.
THE FOLLOWING examples
are given by Miss Bransten as
representative of violations which
might bring a woman before
Women's Council on this charge:
In one case, Jane, as she is
unpacking from vacation, remem
bers a hot tic of rum that she had
bought for her father in Mexico.
She decides lo finish off the
liquor and hide ihe empty bot
t lc.
BUT, BECAUSE she hears that
her R.A. knows what she did, she
turns herself in.
"Jane is found guilty of delib
erate disregard of a University
ruling, and given Suspended Sus
pension for one Quarter," explains
Miss Bransten.
In another case, Kate, a Senior,
goes up to her boy friend's room
in a fraternity to use some of his
books.
AFTER READING for a while
in his room, she lies down on the
bed to sleep. The boy falls asleep
also, on the foot of the bed.

(Neither awakens until the R.A.
j comes in at 3:00 a.m.
"The Council charges the girl
| with deliberate disregard for be
-1 ing in a boy's room after open
I house hours, and with gross neg-
I ligence for her carelessness in
j falling asleep," Miss Bransten
| said. "The Council recommends
Suspended Suspension for one
Quarter."
The Dean of Women then finds
that she cannot approve the de
cision and she asks that the Coun
cil reconsider the case; the Coun
cil remains unanimous for Sus
pended Suspension.
THE DEAN refers the case to
ihe Disciplinary Sub-Committee,
which recommends Suspension lie
cause of the moral implications
of the case. The girl is suspender!
lor one Quarter.

In one case, Jane, as she is
unpacking from vacation, remem
bers a hot tic of rum that she had
bought for her father in Mexico.
She decides lo finish off the
liquor and hide ihe empty bot
t lc.
BUT, BECAUSE she hears that
her R.A. knows what she did, she
turns herself in.
"Jane is found guilty of delib
erate disregard of a University
ruling, and given Suspended Sus
pension for one Quarter," explains
Miss Bransten.
In another case, Kate, a Senior,
goes up to her boy friend's room
in a fraternity to use some of his
books.

in his room, she lies down on the
bed to sleep. The boy falls asleep
also, on the foot of the bed.

j comes in at 3:00 a.m.
"The Council charges the girl
| with deliberate disregard for be

I house hours, and with gross neg-
I ligence for her carelessness in
j falling asleep," Miss Bransten

Suspended Suspension for one
Quarter."
The Dean of Women then finds
that she cannot approve the de
cision and she asks that the Coun
cil reconsider the case; the Coun
cil remains unanimous for Sus
pended Suspension.
THE DEAN refers the case to
ihe Disciplinary Sub-Committee,
which recommends Suspension lie
cause of the moral implications
of the case. The girl is suspender!
lor one Quarter.
Women's Council cases invoh ing charges of "deliberate dis
regard" occur much less often than those dealing with "gross
negligence* or "poor judgment, ' but are usually more serious in
nature because they involve an intentional violation of social regu
lations, according to Kate Bransten, Women's Council member.

This charge may involve the*
following decisions on the girl's!
part, Miss Bransten said:
• Decision to take a few late
minutes, even though she is able j
to return to her dormitory in time '
to sign in by 2:30.
• Decision to disregard house ;
or University rules.
• Decision to ignore her late |
minutes when signing in.
