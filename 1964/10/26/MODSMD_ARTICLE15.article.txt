# Geological Find Is 'Paleoparadoxia'
## 
### 
Hones of a prehistoric marine mammal found near the end sta
tion of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center October - ma) he
one of the most significant fossil discoveries on the North Anieri- ;
can continent, according to paleontologists.
Though at first to be the bones of a whale of the Middle \lio- j

cene era some 15 to 20 million"
years old, scientists have now de
termined that the remains are
those of a "paleoparadoxia" of the
same era- a scientific joke-name
for an animal that nearly defies
classification.
THE PALEOPARADOXIA was j
the appropriate size and shape of
a hippopotamus, to which it may
he dimly related. It had short
tusks for rooting in soft marshy
ground and shoreline areas, a
head that resembled a tapir's,
heavily-muscled hind legs like
those of a frog, and short front
legs with relatively long, linger
like claw.
Excavation in a cut-hank just
south of the future beam switch
yard of the two-mile long atom
smasher has revealed the bones
of a nearly completed animal, ac
cording to Raymond Cox, Cana
dian government geologist study
ing at Stanford for an advanced
degree.
Cox, Mrs. M. K. H. Panofsky,
wife of the accelerator director,
and Dr. Earl Packard, Stanford
research associate in geology,
have volunteered their time since
t lie discovery to exhume the
bones for reassembly in the Uni
versity's geology laboratory.
"I'VE KEEN waiting 40 years
for a find like this," Dr. Packard
said.
Turned up so far are the bones
of the creature's arm, hind limbs.
12 of a possible 11 ribs, the spinal
column and the lower mandible
with the remains of a tusk. So

+
well preserved are the remains !
that the cartilage between the
bone segments is still present.
The only item missing and j
which may yet be found is the |
top of the skull, Cox reports.
IN Tin; MIDDLE Miocene pe-|
riod, geologists say, there were I
many local shallow seas, and the
continents were in the process of
emerging. Central California was ;
radically different than it is today
and the Coast Range did no! exisi.
The paleoparadoxia was known
to have roamed the shores of
what later become the North Pa
cific basin. A similar find was
made in Japan in the early 1920'5. j
Almost lost in the excitement
over the discovery of the paleo
paradoxia was another find dat- 1
in£ to the same geological period
the skull of a Middle Miocene
whale. This was found in a cut
bank adjacent to the SLAC con
trol building, now under construc
tion. Excavation of this relic will
be postponed until the paleopara
doxia is assembled and the con
trol building finished.


DISCOVERY SITE-Rctymond Cox, graduate stu
dent in geology from Vancouver, 8.C., whisks
away dust from the rib-cage of a paleopara
doxia, discovered near the future beam switch
yard of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.

The bones were though 1o be those of a Middle-
Miocene age whale but diagnosis was changed
as the nearly complete marine mammal was un
earthed. Paleontologists say the find is one of
the most significant in North America.

the pcileoparadoxia might have looked like some 15 million years

remotely related to the hippopotamus. It swam by kicking with !
its front-like hind legs, and rooted for food with its tusks.

those of a frog, and short front
legs with relatively long, linger
