# Touch Football And The Intramuralists
## 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
"Mens sana in corpore sano" a sound mind in a sound body—
has always been the sino qua non of university athletic programs,
tho theme around which many an athletic director has woven many
an after-dinner speech.
Sports cognoscenti have generally appreciated the perspicacity
of a university in creating a dialectical, two-pronged program: the
intercollegiate, varsity athletic schedules for those possessed of the
corpore sano; the intramural counterpart for those boasting ihe
mens sana. Sometimes, the more irreverent among us have whis
pered, neither is possessed of either.
But such is not the case on tho Farm.
Indeed, after venturing out to an intramural contest which
counterposed t ho Fijis versus the Kappa Alphas and catching an occa
sional varsity encounter, I can attest that sometimes both can have
a little of both.
A PERFECT DAY
It; was a cloudy Saturday, tiemulating on the brink of rain and
inordinately chilly. Were Mel Allen announcing intramural games—
and someday he just may be- he would undoubtedly refer to it as
"a perfect day for football."
A few gold-shirted KA's were gaining last minute inspirations
from a lew wide-eyed coeds, while the Fijis, in more serious bent,
were plotting razzle-dazzle offensive fireworks on the turf through
the services of one of their own's grimy index finger.
Then came time for the struggle, and, as the two squads trotted
out onto the field, two distinct mental outlooks became apparent.
"Fire up out there, contain them," said a Fiji spectator, among
the twenty-five or so viewers of the contest.
"Slaughter the mothers, total victory," said a ICA.
A TOUCH FOOTBALL PARADIGM
The first half was a paradigm of what all touch football, played
on whatever level, always is. Jockeying up and down the field, at
tempting to break the opponents' 2-5 defensive set-up, the ball chang
ing hands only through interceptions or takeover on downs, the
atmosphere, cluttered with missiles, was befitting a junior birdman
aerial bombardment.
But the KA's were putting on the pressure, featuring a portside
throwing quarterback who rolled out to his left on every play, and
fired reasonably swift darts to his ends running through buttonhook
and look-in patterns.
As the KA's approached the Fiji twenty, the spectators became
tense, the cold war between the squads heatened.
"Fire up out there you guys—contain them" said the white-shirted
lad on the sidelines.
"Total victory slaughter the mothers," said a gold-shirted lad
next to the white-shirted lad.
"Don't get hurt, Hayes," muttered a self-conscious coed.
AN J) THE GOLD ONES TALLY
On the next play, the KA quarterback rolled out—to the left as
was his habit—and fired a look-in pass to his end who grabbed the
pigskin and stepped into the corner of the endzone. A blonde dolly
jumped up and down; the white-shirts looked downcast: "That's not
containing them; we won't win that way."
But the Fijis had had enough of acquiescence, and appeasement
and on a series of plays before the end of Ihe half, their beleaguered
quarterback threw a long bomb to a flanker with a strangely be
wildered look on his face, who caught the ball and ran over for the
score.
Half-time came.
The KA's heroes went to their girlfriends; the Fiji's went back
to the fellow with the dirty index finger, who explained with remark
| able erudition the virtues of the flat pass when the quarterback be
comes harrassed by a heated two-man rush.
The KA's weren't actually tot) happy. "We're screwin' up," re
marked one of their regulars. "It's a good game—looks like we can
contain them," enthused an opposing white shirt.
But containment in the second half seemed to no avail. The Fiji
quarterback, rushed and perplexed and not quite remembering the
advice of his teammate with the dirty finger, heaved a long pass
which plopped into the amazed hands of a gold-shirt, who began a
long impressive gallop through a myriad of whites.
"All the way Schweeny boy, all the way" emoted a teammate, who
was however, drowned out by the "don't let him get going" call of
a Fiji. '
And "old Schweeny" did get moving. Eluding defenders and
blockers alike, he raced nearly the entire length of the field and
into the endzone, to put Kappa Alpha up, 13-6.
KA'S WRAP IT CP
A few series later il was the KA's quarterback who became the
aggressor. Fieldmarshaling his charges with some skill, he put Ihe
coupe de grace on the morning's action, when he rolled out— of all
things—to tiie left of all things and raced into the endzone to
climax tho scoring for* the contest and bring KA the victory, 20-6.
"You didn't contain them," remonstrated a white shirt to some
iellow white shirts, "you were too non-violent." "No, if you had only
thrown some flat passes. . . ." corrected the lad with the dirty finger.
"Way to slaughter those mothers," cheered a KA. "Way to go,
you were so brilliant, Hayes," cooed the blonde.
DOES POLITICS MATTER?
And, after each team had properly and politely cheered the other,
; the winded players scrambled for their cigarettes and climbed into
| their cars. Perhaps it was an illusion, but almost all ihe KA's
seemed to have Goldwater stickers on their- bumpers.
A Fiji player had a book by George Kennan in the back window.
And having watched the game, I wondered if these battles- with
out the marching bands, the cheering pom-pon girls, the anxious
;nd vindictive alumni, the peanut venders or 1 lire cards sections
were not a pretty good example of the real "Mens sana in corpore
sano."
Simply some college students, under little pressure, contending
for the glory of their house and themselves, and playing only before
their friends and stray writer or two, utilizing whatever they know

about football to the best of their
ability, and emerging with a cer
tain unique mystical esprit do
corps.
One thing is certain. Intramural
football may not have much of an
aundience, but it certainly puts
on a show. Replete with flashes of
mens and eorpore.

and someday he just may be- he would undoubtedly refer to it as
"a perfect day for football."
A few gold-shirted KA's were gaining last minute inspirations
from a lew wide-eyed coeds, while the Fijis, in more serious bent,
were plotting razzle-dazzle offensive fireworks on the turf through
the services of one of their own's grimy index finger.
Then came time for the struggle, and, as the two squads trotted
out onto the field, two distinct mental outlooks became apparent.
"Fire up out there, contain them," said a Fiji spectator, among
the twenty-five or so viewers of the contest.
"Slaughter the mothers, total victory," said a ICA.
A TOUCH FOOTBALL PARADIGM
The first half was a paradigm of what all touch football, played
on whatever level, always is. Jockeying up and down the field, at
tempting to break the opponents' 2-5 defensive set-up, the ball chang
ing hands only through interceptions or takeover on downs, the
atmosphere, cluttered with missiles, was befitting a junior birdman
aerial bombardment.
But the KA's were putting on the pressure, featuring a portside
throwing quarterback who rolled out to his left on every play, and
fired reasonably swift darts to his ends running through buttonhook
and look-in patterns.
As the KA's approached the Fiji twenty, the spectators became
tense, the cold war between the squads heatened.
"Fire up out there you guys—contain them" said the white-shirted
lad on the sidelines.
"Total victory slaughter the mothers," said a gold-shirted lad
next to the white-shirted lad.
"Don't get hurt, Hayes," muttered a self-conscious coed.
AN J) THE GOLD ONES TALLY
On the next play, the KA quarterback rolled out—to the left as
was his habit—and fired a look-in pass to his end who grabbed the
pigskin and stepped into the corner of the endzone. A blonde dolly
jumped up and down; the white-shirts looked downcast: "That's not
containing them; we won't win that way."
But the Fijis had had enough of acquiescence, and appeasement
and on a series of plays before the end of Ihe half, their beleaguered
quarterback threw a long bomb to a flanker with a strangely be
wildered look on his face, who caught the ball and ran over for the
score.
Half-time came.
The KA's heroes went to their girlfriends; the Fiji's went back
to the fellow with the dirty index finger, who explained with remark
| able erudition the virtues of the flat pass when the quarterback be
comes harrassed by a heated two-man rush.
The KA's weren't actually tot) happy. "We're screwin' up," re
marked one of their regulars. "It's a good game—looks like we can
contain them," enthused an opposing white shirt.
But containment in the second half seemed to no avail. The Fiji
quarterback, rushed and perplexed and not quite remembering the
advice of his teammate with the dirty finger, heaved a long pass
which plopped into the amazed hands of a gold-shirt, who began a
long impressive gallop through a myriad of whites.
"All the way Schweeny boy, all the way" emoted a teammate, who
was however, drowned out by the "don't let him get going" call of
a Fiji. '
And "old Schweeny" did get moving. Eluding defenders and
blockers alike, he raced nearly the entire length of the field and
into the endzone, to put Kappa Alpha up, 13-6.
KA'S WRAP IT CP
A few series later il was the KA's quarterback who became the
aggressor. Fieldmarshaling his charges with some skill, he put Ihe
coupe de grace on the morning's action, when he rolled out— of all
things—to tiie left of all things and raced into the endzone to
climax tho scoring for* the contest and bring KA the victory, 20-6.
"You didn't contain them," remonstrated a white shirt to some
iellow white shirts, "you were too non-violent." "No, if you had only
thrown some flat passes. . . ." corrected the lad with the dirty finger.
"Way to slaughter those mothers," cheered a KA. "Way to go,
you were so brilliant, Hayes," cooed the blonde.
DOES POLITICS MATTER?
And, after each team had properly and politely cheered the other,
; the winded players scrambled for their cigarettes and climbed into
| their cars. Perhaps it was an illusion, but almost all ihe KA's
seemed to have Goldwater stickers on their- bumpers.
A Fiji player had a book by George Kennan in the back window.
And having watched the game, I wondered if these battles- with
out the marching bands, the cheering pom-pon girls, the anxious
;nd vindictive alumni, the peanut venders or 1 lire cards sections
were not a pretty good example of the real "Mens sana in corpore
sano."
Simply some college students, under little pressure, contending
for the glory of their house and themselves, and playing only before
their friends and stray writer or two, utilizing whatever they know

about football to the best of their
ability, and emerging with a cer
tain unique mystical esprit do
corps.
One thing is certain. Intramural
football may not have much of an
aundience, but it certainly puts
on a show. Replete with flashes of
mens and eorpore.
"Mens sana in corpore sano" a sound mind in a sound body—
has always been the sino qua non of university athletic programs,
tho theme around which many an athletic director has woven many
an after-dinner speech.
Sports cognoscenti have generally appreciated the perspicacity
of a university in creating a dialectical, two-pronged program: the
intercollegiate, varsity athletic schedules for those possessed of the
corpore sano; the intramural counterpart for those boasting ihe
mens sana. Sometimes, the more irreverent among us have whis
pered, neither is possessed of either.
But such is not the case on tho Farm.
Indeed, after venturing out to an intramural contest which
counterposed t ho Fijis versus the Kappa Alphas and catching an occa
sional varsity encounter, I can attest that sometimes both can have
a little of both.

ing hands only through interceptions or takeover on downs, the
atmosphere, cluttered with missiles, was befitting a junior birdman
aerial bombardment.
But the KA's were putting on the pressure, featuring a portside
throwing quarterback who rolled out to his left on every play, and
fired reasonably swift darts to his ends running through buttonhook
and look-in patterns.
As the KA's approached the Fiji twenty, the spectators became
tense, the cold war between the squads heatened.
"Fire up out there you guys—contain them" said the white-shirted
lad on the sidelines.
"Total victory slaughter the mothers," said a gold-shirted lad
next to the white-shirted lad.
"Don't get hurt, Hayes," muttered a self-conscious coed.
AN J) THE GOLD ONES TALLY
On the next play, the KA quarterback rolled out—to the left as
was his habit—and fired a look-in pass to his end who grabbed the
pigskin and stepped into the corner of the endzone. A blonde dolly
jumped up and down; the white-shirts looked downcast: "That's not
containing them; we won't win that way."
But the Fijis had had enough of acquiescence, and appeasement
and on a series of plays before the end of Ihe half, their beleaguered
quarterback threw a long bomb to a flanker with a strangely be
wildered look on his face, who caught the ball and ran over for the
score.
Half-time came.
The KA's heroes went to their girlfriends; the Fiji's went back
to the fellow with the dirty index finger, who explained with remark
| able erudition the virtues of the flat pass when the quarterback be
comes harrassed by a heated two-man rush.
The KA's weren't actually tot) happy. "We're screwin' up," re
marked one of their regulars. "It's a good game—looks like we can
contain them," enthused an opposing white shirt.
But containment in the second half seemed to no avail. The Fiji
quarterback, rushed and perplexed and not quite remembering the
advice of his teammate with the dirty finger, heaved a long pass
which plopped into the amazed hands of a gold-shirt, who began a
long impressive gallop through a myriad of whites.
"All the way Schweeny boy, all the way" emoted a teammate, who
was however, drowned out by the "don't let him get going" call of
a Fiji. '
And "old Schweeny" did get moving. Eluding defenders and
blockers alike, he raced nearly the entire length of the field and
into the endzone, to put Kappa Alpha up, 13-6.
KA'S WRAP IT CP
A few series later il was the KA's quarterback who became the
aggressor. Fieldmarshaling his charges with some skill, he put Ihe
coupe de grace on the morning's action, when he rolled out— of all
things—to tiie left of all things and raced into the endzone to
climax tho scoring for* the contest and bring KA the victory, 20-6.
"You didn't contain them," remonstrated a white shirt to some
iellow white shirts, "you were too non-violent." "No, if you had only
thrown some flat passes. . . ." corrected the lad with the dirty finger.
"Way to slaughter those mothers," cheered a KA. "Way to go,
you were so brilliant, Hayes," cooed the blonde.
DOES POLITICS MATTER?
And, after each team had properly and politely cheered the other,
; the winded players scrambled for their cigarettes and climbed into
| their cars. Perhaps it was an illusion, but almost all ihe KA's
seemed to have Goldwater stickers on their- bumpers.
A Fiji player had a book by George Kennan in the back window.
And having watched the game, I wondered if these battles- with
out the marching bands, the cheering pom-pon girls, the anxious
;nd vindictive alumni, the peanut venders or 1 lire cards sections
were not a pretty good example of the real "Mens sana in corpore
sano."
Simply some college students, under little pressure, contending
for the glory of their house and themselves, and playing only before
their friends and stray writer or two, utilizing whatever they know

about football to the best of their
ability, and emerging with a cer
tain unique mystical esprit do
corps.
One thing is certain. Intramural
football may not have much of an
aundience, but it certainly puts
on a show. Replete with flashes of
mens and eorpore.
"Mens sana in corpore sano" a sound mind in a sound body—
has always been the sino qua non of university athletic programs,
tho theme around which many an athletic director has woven many
an after-dinner speech.
Sports cognoscenti have generally appreciated the perspicacity
of a university in creating a dialectical, two-pronged program: the
intercollegiate, varsity athletic schedules for those possessed of the
corpore sano; the intramural counterpart for those boasting ihe
mens sana. Sometimes, the more irreverent among us have whis
pered, neither is possessed of either.
But such is not the case on tho Farm.
Indeed, after venturing out to an intramural contest which
counterposed t ho Fijis versus the Kappa Alphas and catching an occa
sional varsity encounter, I can attest that sometimes both can have
a little of both.
A PERFECT DAY
It; was a cloudy Saturday, tiemulating on the brink of rain and
inordinately chilly. Were Mel Allen announcing intramural games—
and someday he just may be- he would undoubtedly refer to it as
"a perfect day for football."
A few gold-shirted KA's were gaining last minute inspirations
from a lew wide-eyed coeds, while the Fijis, in more serious bent,
were plotting razzle-dazzle offensive fireworks on the turf through
the services of one of their own's grimy index finger.
Then came time for the struggle, and, as the two squads trotted
out onto the field, two distinct mental outlooks became apparent.
"Fire up out there, contain them," said a Fiji spectator, among
the twenty-five or so viewers of the contest.
"Slaughter the mothers, total victory," said a ICA.
A TOUCH FOOTBALL PARADIGM
The first half was a paradigm of what all touch football, played
on whatever level, always is. Jockeying up and down the field, at
tempting to break the opponents' 2-5 defensive set-up, the ball chang
ing hands only through interceptions or takeover on downs, the
atmosphere, cluttered with missiles, was befitting a junior birdman

and look-in patterns.

"Total victory slaughter the mothers," said a gold-shirted lad
