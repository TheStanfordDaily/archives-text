# PAPOOSES LOSE, 14-0
## UCLA Shuts Out Frosh 
### 
The Stanford freshman foot
hall loam, hindered hy an offense
that just wouldn't click, found
themselves two touchdowns bo
hind the UCLA yearlings after
lhe first half and couldn't make
up the difference, losing 14-0.
The passing of the opposition's
quarterback, Gary Beban, killed
the Papooses. After UCLA had
intercepted a pass early in the
game, a Beban aerial on Ihird
and long yardage netted a first
down. Soon after they scored.
Two long bombs by Beban in Ihe
second quarter led to another
touchdown and the winning mar
gin.
COACH GEORGE LYNN was
not happy because of his team's
impotent offense, but he ibought
his "defense was very good."
Stanford's gains always seemed
to be nullified by good UCLA de
fensive plays or by Papoose
fumbles.

The coach feels the team has
"individually, mighty fine play
ers." However, Lynn does not
feel the team is united yet.
He plans to work on passing
and timing this week in hopes of
arriving at a smooth operating
offense. The freshmen meet Cal
on Saturday in their final game
of the season.
