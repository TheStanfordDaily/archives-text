# Fighting Irish Crush Indians With Dazzling Offense, 28-6
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Notre Dame, after nearly a de
cade of pleasant mediocrity, has
this year returned to the heights
of a national ranking. Stanford
discovered this fad for them
selves Saturday, losing to the un
beaten Irish 28-6.
The game was never really in
doubt, though the Stanford de
tense, aided by a fumble on the
eight yard line, and later an in
terception in the end zone by
Craig Ritchey, kept Notre Dame
off the scoreboard until five min
utes into the second quarter.
BUT IF Stanford slowed the
Notre Dame attack, the Irish
stopped the Indian offense cold.
The visitors couldn't manage a
first down until late in the third
quarter, and gathered only four
in all.
Quarterback John Huarte, on
the other hand, guided the Irish
to 29 first downs and 482 total
yards. Stanford gained only one
yard on the ground and 55, all
in the second half, through ihe
air.
The first successful Irish drive
began at the close of the first
period with Huarte hitting his
ends, Jack Snow and Phil Sheri
dan for 19 yards down to the Stan
ford 48.
HALFBACK Nick Eddy went
for nine yards and on a third and
15 Huarte completed a 19-yard
pass to Snow on the 25. Finally
the drive stalled on the 11 yard
line, and Ken Ivan kicked a 28
yard field goal.
Notre Dame got all the insur
ance that they needed shortly
thereafter. Beginning on their
own 38. pass interference on
Snow gave the Irish a first down
on the 46. Huarte then caught
halfback Bill Wolski all alone on
the Stanford 20. Wolski, un
troubled by any earby Stanford
secondary, scored easily, ihe first
of his afternoon's touchdown total
of Ihree. When the kick failed,
the Irish led 9-0.
The final score of the half came
on the last second of the second
quarter. Tony Carey intercepted
a DeSylvia pass on the Stanford
46 with 53 seconds left.
HUARTE, after a couple of
misses, completed a 15 yard pass
to Snow. A holding penalty moved
the ball to the 15 and passes to
Eddy and Wolski moved the ball
down to the two. Eddy then went
around left end for the score, and
after a two point, try failed, ihe
Irish held a 15 point halftime
margin.
Things didn't get much better
for the Indians in the second half,
although Stanford opened the
second half by getting past mid
field for the first time. Only they
didn't get much farther, and a

punt by Dick Ragsdale jjiiI the
Irish back on their 17.
Huarte combined with fullback
Joe Kantor, for a 33 yard com
! pletion, and added IT more on a
| pass to Eddy. Seven plays later
the Irish were on the one foot
line. Wolski went over on the
next play, but a penalty put tho
Irish back on the 15.
JOE FARRELE on the third
down took a screen pass back
down to the one, and Wolski
again went over, this time for
real. Joe Azzaro kicked the point
after, and Noire Damp lod by 22.
Stanford meanwhile could do
nothing against the Irish line.
Ray I-Iandley, the nation's leading
rusher going into I ho game, was

I held to 43 yards, and oven that
took him 19 attempts.
The quarterbaeks, DeSylvla and
Don Cook, eould never get an
(effective air attack going. Con
stantly harried by a hard rush
they connected on only three
passes for 32 yards and vere
i dropped behind the line five time
j tor 64 yards lost.
Til 10 ONLY Indian score of the
day came on a three yard option
pass by Handley to flanker Dave
Lewis after the game had already
i been totally lost. And even then
the Tribe could only manage a
32 yard drive, the touchdown be
ing set up by a 2.'> yard runback
of an intercepted pass by J. D.
Lodato.
