# Stanford Harriers Surprise San Jose
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
An experienced Stanford cross j
country squad, teetering on the !
edge of greatness Saturday, beat
San Jose State, a team that isn't
in the habit of counting losses
among its experiences, 27-28.
Cowboy boot clad coach Jerry
Barland urged his forces along
the golf course trail and they re
sponded with efforts that hum
bled defending the NCAA champs
j and exacted just revenge for a
i defeat in the Sacramento Invita-
I tional earlier this year.
Led by Dan Murphy, who holds j
the Stanford course record at
19:34, San Jose's Varsity seemed
I t he heavy favorite. The Indians
I would have to gather many of the
' positions between first and sev
lenth to maintain any chance of
victory. They got only three, vol
won.
DANE DEFBNER managed to
turn the tide. With only one mile
remaining, he was running sev
enth. He was right behind three
San Jose runners. With the crowd
cheering him forward, he closed
the gap. With a tremendous last
kick, he passed two of them. For
the last three hundred yards only
rare courage kept him in front j
of his challengers.
Dan Murphy ran away with the 1
top honor in a time of 19:55.3.
Weym Kirkland from Stanford
avoided his usual fade at the fin
ish. and came in second at 20:17. 1
Harry McCalla, also from Stan
ford, finished third at 20:20. As ,
expected both these men ran well. 1

i Paul Sehlicke and Harlan An
jdrevvs finished eighth and ninth,
I respectively, for the industrious
i Indians.
The five man team times were
Stanford 1:42:55; San Jose
1:43:07.
THE FRESHMAN meet was
equally exciting. But the Frosh
meet really was more than just
an upset. It was a rout. The frosh
supposedly had absolutely no
prayer of winning.
In the final tabulation Alex
j Whittle ran Number One. with a
jtime of 20:47. Bob Kelly finished
third and Jim Letterer, fourth, as
Stanford swept four of the top
six positions.


DAVE DEUBNER NEARS the finish line after passing two San Jose
runners to sew up the meet victory for Stanford. Deubner only ran
in fifth place, but it was his last mile kick which marked him as
the hero.

six positions.


DAVE DEUBNER NEARS the finish line after passing two San Jose
runners to sew up the meet victory for Stanford. Deubner only ran
in fifth place, but it was his last mile kick which marked him as
the hero.
An experienced Stanford cross j
country squad, teetering on the !
edge of greatness Saturday, beat
San Jose State, a team that isn't
in the habit of counting losses
among its experiences, 27-28.
Cowboy boot clad coach Jerry
Barland urged his forces along
the golf course trail and they re
sponded with efforts that hum
bled defending the NCAA champs
j and exacted just revenge for a
i defeat in the Sacramento Invita-
I tional earlier this year.
Led by Dan Murphy, who holds j
the Stanford course record at
19:34, San Jose's Varsity seemed
I t he heavy favorite. The Indians
I would have to gather many of the
' positions between first and sev
lenth to maintain any chance of
victory. They got only three, vol
won.
DANE DEFBNER managed to
turn the tide. With only one mile
remaining, he was running sev
enth. He was right behind three
San Jose runners. With the crowd
cheering him forward, he closed
the gap. With a tremendous last
kick, he passed two of them. For
the last three hundred yards only
rare courage kept him in front j
of his challengers.
Dan Murphy ran away with the 1
top honor in a time of 19:55.3.
Weym Kirkland from Stanford
avoided his usual fade at the fin
ish. and came in second at 20:17. 1
Harry McCalla, also from Stan
ford, finished third at 20:20. As ,
expected both these men ran well. 1

i Paul Sehlicke and Harlan An
jdrevvs finished eighth and ninth,
I respectively, for the industrious
i Indians.
The five man team times were
Stanford 1:42:55; San Jose
1:43:07.
THE FRESHMAN meet was
equally exciting. But the Frosh
meet really was more than just
an upset. It was a rout. The frosh
supposedly had absolutely no
prayer of winning.
In the final tabulation Alex
j Whittle ran Number One. with a
jtime of 20:47. Bob Kelly finished
third and Jim Letterer, fourth, as
Stanford swept four of the top
six positions.
