# Barry Goldwater For President
## 
### 
Tin* 1964 Presidential election mav well he
judged by lutnre historians as the most profound
and decisive political confrontation in modern
times.
This year, as never hetore, the American elec
torate stands at a major crossroads: its decision
is likeh to determine the course

of United States policy for dec
ades to come.
Unfortunate!) the magnitude
ol the choice to be made on No
vember o has been clouded and
contused by a shallow, laek-lns
ter campaign — a campaign of
over-harsh invective and false
issues, rather than meaningful
debate.
Given the personalities of
the candidates and the nature
and depth of tile philosophic di
vision, perhaps this con Id not
be otherwise.

lint besides the hazy issues
created by this campaigns peculiar rhetoric,
there are two overriding and fundamental ques
tions which will be answered in tin's election.
These, we suggest, should be the ultimate basis
for making a choice.
The first question concerns the manner in
which America will approach the great domestic
problems which will coniront it in the coming
years — problems such as civil rights, the wel
fare of the aged, improved education, urban
blight, chronic poverty, and the cybernetic revo
lution.
Will we face these problems, and their in
creased demands on government, with a view to
ward preserving and strengthening the federal
system, with its division of powers and local par
ticipation and responsibility. Or will we continue
the trend tow ard centralization and loss of local
and state control?
Will we use prudence in our search for the
cures to social ills, refusing to tamper unneces
sarily with the economy, considering with care
tlit* full consequences of a proposed policy, and
allow ing and encouraging at all times voluntary
action in place of government decree? Or will we
continue to seek panaceas for every social prob
lem in massive federal expenditures and half
baked, politically-motivated, relief programs such
as the "War on Poverty" and the federal farm
program?
In short, will we emphasize indiv dualism and
enhance the creative initiative and freedom
from coercion for which the United States has
been known? Or will we, in a fit of misplaced
humanitarianism, erect a Brave New World,
a world ol stifling conformity and dulling secur
ity
Symbolic of this conflict between the individ
ual and the state is the second fundamental ques
tion of this campaign. This question concerns
the course of United States foreign policy vis
a ri.s international Communism.
The choice here is between two sets of basic
presuppositions which form the basis for policy
decisions:
• Is Communism or the Soviet Union "mel
lowing," with an end to the Cold War in sight?
• Or is "peaceful coexistence," as Pravda
said on September 2S, 19fi4, "only one weapon
in the battle against imperialism and the crimes
of the United States, the world imperialist gen
darme ?
Will a policy succeed which assumes that
true peace can be achieved at the conference
table or by "setting a good example" for the So
viets, or w ill such a policy result in the steady re
treat of the West before never-ceasing Commu
nist pressures, particularly in the underdeveloped
areas?
In short, is it possible to achieve peace
through mere negotiations and compromise, or
must it be won by working to reduce the power
of that force which prevents the attainment of
peace?
These two basic issues—the role of the state
with respect to the conflicting claims of freedom
and security, and the global struggle between
freedom and Communism—are, bv am measure,
the great questions of our time, the major di
lemmas confronting our civilization.
It is on the basis ol these issues that we
strough up'e the election of Barrv Goldwater

as President of the United States.
Senator Goidwater, as he himself has the
humility to admit, is hardly the ideal candidate.
Mis shortcomings are many.
Hnt it has been characteristic of this cam
paign for the Senator's detractors to overlook
(a) the serious shortcomings of

Lyndon Johnson, and (b) the
qualities of leadership wit h
which Gold water can justly be
credited.
In the area ol practical lead
ership, Goklwatcr has demon
strated during the Republican
convention and throughout the
subsequent campaign the impor
tant ability to gather around
him knowledgeable and compe
tent ad\ isors and to hear their
views before making important
decisions.
Six task forces composed of

leading experts in every field
have been organized to make policy and pro
grain proposals—demonstrating the necessary
ability of any administration to take practical
steps toward realization of the ideals for which
it stands.
In character, Barry Goldwater is a refreshing
combination of the pragmatist and the idealist.
He is best known, of course, for his idealism
rather than for is pragmatism, for integrity rather
than expediency. In taking stands on principle
(as in the votes on the Test Ban Treaty or the
Civil flights Bill), he has shown himself, in even*
sense of the term as it was used by John F. Ken
ned)', a profile in courage. This devotion to prin
ciple, we submit, is an important virtue too often
lacking in our politicians.
But to temper his idealism, Goldwater has a
keen understanding of the practical limitations
on w hat he, if elected, could achieve. While bis
ideals differ radically from those of the present
administration, his programs (especially in the
fields of tax reform, labor legislation, education,
and streamlining of government) have been mod
erate and practical, exhibiting if anything the
caution one would expect of a true conservative.
It is on the basis of his philosophy, however,
that Goldwater deserves strongest support. We
believe that the application of conservative prin
ciples to the practical problems of government
will bring myriad, long-needed reforms.
A Goldwater administration would put in
the service of the government men w ho too long
have been ignored in our highest councils, busi
nessmen and academicians who would initiate
long overdue changes.
We can only agree with Goldwater when be
says that "the tide has been running against free
dom." Surely there can be no mistaking the
trend in our domestic affairs toward greater cen
tralization, nor the trend in foreign affairs to
ward increasing Communist power.
The only hope of stemming that tide, and
perhaps of reversing it, is to elect to office men
who will seek to limit and decrease their own
power and to reverse the course of the Cold
War.
Only bv electing men like Goldwater can we
bring to government an essential distrust of con
centrated power, a concern for local and state
responsibility, and a will to contain the size of
government and its influence over the individual.
Only by electing men like Goldw ater can we
restore in the highest offices of the land an appre
ciation for and understanding of the private en
terprise economy as well as the will to preserve
that system and to prevent the passage of short
sighted legislation which would undermine it.
And only In electing men like Goldwater
can the foreign policy of this countrv be shaped
around a forward strategy in the Cold War, a
strategy aimed at reducing Communist power
and strengthening the Western Alliance, a stra
tegy based on a realistic appraisal of the Commu
nist movement, rather than one based on fear,
indecisiv eness, and wishful thinking.
These considerations, we believe, provide im
portant and compelling reasons to support the
liepublican ticket on November .'I

Will a policy succeed which assumes that
true peace can be achieved at the conference

These two basic issues—the role of the state
with respect to the conflicting claims of freedom
and security, and the global struggle between
freedom and Communism—are, bv am measure,
the great questions of our time, the major di
lemmas confronting our civilization.
It is on the basis ol these issues that we
strough up'e the election of Barrv Goldwater

as President of the United States.
Senator Goidwater, as he himself has the
humility to admit, is hardly the ideal candidate.
Mis shortcomings are many.
Hnt it has been characteristic of this cam
paign for the Senator's detractors to overlook
(a) the serious shortcomings of

Lyndon Johnson, and (b) the
qualities of leadership wit h
which Gold water can justly be
credited.
In the area ol practical lead
ership, Goklwatcr has demon
strated during the Republican
convention and throughout the
subsequent campaign the impor
tant ability to gather around
him knowledgeable and compe
tent ad\ isors and to hear their
views before making important
decisions.
Six task forces composed of

leading experts in every field
have been organized to make policy and pro
grain proposals—demonstrating the necessary
ability of any administration to take practical
steps toward realization of the ideals for which
it stands.
In character, Barry Goldwater is a refreshing
combination of the pragmatist and the idealist.
He is best known, of course, for his idealism
rather than for is pragmatism, for integrity rather
than expediency. In taking stands on principle
(as in the votes on the Test Ban Treaty or the
Civil flights Bill), he has shown himself, in even*
sense of the term as it was used by John F. Ken
ned)', a profile in courage. This devotion to prin
ciple, we submit, is an important virtue too often
lacking in our politicians.
But to temper his idealism, Goldwater has a
keen understanding of the practical limitations
on w hat he, if elected, could achieve. While bis
ideals differ radically from those of the present
administration, his programs (especially in the
fields of tax reform, labor legislation, education,
and streamlining of government) have been mod
erate and practical, exhibiting if anything the
caution one would expect of a true conservative.
It is on the basis of his philosophy, however,
that Goldwater deserves strongest support. We
believe that the application of conservative prin
ciples to the practical problems of government
will bring myriad, long-needed reforms.
A Goldwater administration would put in
the service of the government men w ho too long
have been ignored in our highest councils, busi
nessmen and academicians who would initiate
long overdue changes.
We can only agree with Goldwater when be
says that "the tide has been running against free
dom." Surely there can be no mistaking the
trend in our domestic affairs toward greater cen
tralization, nor the trend in foreign affairs to
ward increasing Communist power.
The only hope of stemming that tide, and
perhaps of reversing it, is to elect to office men
who will seek to limit and decrease their own
power and to reverse the course of the Cold
War.
Only bv electing men like Goldwater can we
bring to government an essential distrust of con
centrated power, a concern for local and state
responsibility, and a will to contain the size of
government and its influence over the individual.
Only by electing men like Goldw ater can we
restore in the highest offices of the land an appre
ciation for and understanding of the private en
terprise economy as well as the will to preserve
that system and to prevent the passage of short
sighted legislation which would undermine it.
And only In electing men like Goldwater
can the foreign policy of this countrv be shaped
around a forward strategy in the Cold War, a
strategy aimed at reducing Communist power
and strengthening the Western Alliance, a stra
tegy based on a realistic appraisal of the Commu
nist movement, rather than one based on fear,
indecisiv eness, and wishful thinking.
These considerations, we believe, provide im
portant and compelling reasons to support the
liepublican ticket on November .'I

Tin* 1964 Presidential election mav well he
judged by lutnre historians as the most profound
and decisive political confrontation in modern
times.
This year, as never hetore, the American elec
torate stands at a major crossroads: its decision
is likeh to determine the course

of United States policy for dec
ades to come.
Unfortunate!) the magnitude
ol the choice to be made on No
vember o has been clouded and
contused by a shallow, laek-lns
ter campaign — a campaign of
over-harsh invective and false
issues, rather than meaningful
debate.
Given the personalities of
the candidates and the nature
and depth of tile philosophic di
vision, perhaps this con Id not
be otherwise.

lint besides the hazy issues
created by this campaigns peculiar rhetoric,
there are two overriding and fundamental ques
tions which will be answered in tin's election.
These, we suggest, should be the ultimate basis
for making a choice.
The first question concerns the manner in
which America will approach the great domestic
problems which will coniront it in the coming
years — problems such as civil rights, the wel
fare of the aged, improved education, urban
blight, chronic poverty, and the cybernetic revo
lution.
Will we face these problems, and their in
creased demands on government, with a view to
ward preserving and strengthening the federal
system, with its division of powers and local par
ticipation and responsibility. Or will we continue
the trend tow ard centralization and loss of local
and state control?
Will we use prudence in our search for the
cures to social ills, refusing to tamper unneces
sarily with the economy, considering with care
tlit* full consequences of a proposed policy, and
allow ing and encouraging at all times voluntary
action in place of government decree? Or will we
continue to seek panaceas for every social prob
lem in massive federal expenditures and half
baked, politically-motivated, relief programs such
as the "War on Poverty" and the federal farm
program?
In short, will we emphasize indiv dualism and
enhance the creative initiative and freedom
from coercion for which the United States has
been known? Or will we, in a fit of misplaced
humanitarianism, erect a Brave New World,
a world ol stifling conformity and dulling secur
ity
Symbolic of this conflict between the individ
ual and the state is the second fundamental ques
tion of this campaign. This question concerns
the course of United States foreign policy vis
a ri.s international Communism.
The choice here is between two sets of basic
presuppositions which form the basis for policy
decisions:
• Is Communism or the Soviet Union "mel
lowing," with an end to the Cold War in sight?
• Or is "peaceful coexistence," as Pravda
said on September 2S, 19fi4, "only one weapon

fields of tax reform, labor legislation, education,
and streamlining of government) have been mod
erate and practical, exhibiting if anything the
caution one would expect of a true conservative.
It is on the basis of his philosophy, however,
that Goldwater deserves strongest support. We
believe that the application of conservative prin
ciples to the practical problems of government
will bring myriad, long-needed reforms.
A Goldwater administration would put in
the service of the government men w ho too long
have been ignored in our highest councils, busi
nessmen and academicians who would initiate
long overdue changes.
We can only agree with Goldwater when be
says that "the tide has been running against free
dom." Surely there can be no mistaking the
trend in our domestic affairs toward greater cen
tralization, nor the trend in foreign affairs to
ward increasing Communist power.
The only hope of stemming that tide, and
perhaps of reversing it, is to elect to office men
who will seek to limit and decrease their own
power and to reverse the course of the Cold
War.
Only bv electing men like Goldwater can we
bring to government an essential distrust of con
centrated power, a concern for local and state
responsibility, and a will to contain the size of
government and its influence over the individual.
Only by electing men like Goldw ater can we
restore in the highest offices of the land an appre
ciation for and understanding of the private en
terprise economy as well as the will to preserve
that system and to prevent the passage of short
sighted legislation which would undermine it.
And only In electing men like Goldwater
can the foreign policy of this countrv be shaped
around a forward strategy in the Cold War, a
strategy aimed at reducing Communist power
and strengthening the Western Alliance, a stra
tegy based on a realistic appraisal of the Commu
nist movement, rather than one based on fear,
indecisiv eness, and wishful thinking.
These considerations, we believe, provide im
portant and compelling reasons to support the
liepublican ticket on November .'I

Tin* 1964 Presidential election mav well he
judged by lutnre historians as the most profound
and decisive political confrontation in modern
times.
This year, as never hetore, the American elec
torate stands at a major crossroads: its decision
is likeh to determine the course

of United States policy for dec
ades to come.
Unfortunate!) the magnitude
ol the choice to be made on No
vember o has been clouded and
contused by a shallow, laek-lns
ter campaign — a campaign of
over-harsh invective and false
issues, rather than meaningful
debate.
Given the personalities of
the candidates and the nature
and depth of tile philosophic di
vision, perhaps this con Id not
be otherwise.

lint besides the hazy issues
created by this campaigns peculiar rhetoric,
there are two overriding and fundamental ques
tions which will be answered in tin's election.
These, we suggest, should be the ultimate basis
for making a choice.
The first question concerns the manner in
which America will approach the great domestic
problems which will coniront it in the coming
years — problems such as civil rights, the wel
fare of the aged, improved education, urban
blight, chronic poverty, and the cybernetic revo
lution.
Will we face these problems, and their in
creased demands on government, with a view to
ward preserving and strengthening the federal
system, with its division of powers and local par
ticipation and responsibility. Or will we continue
the trend tow ard centralization and loss of local
and state control?
Will we use prudence in our search for the
cures to social ills, refusing to tamper unneces
sarily with the economy, considering with care
tlit* full consequences of a proposed policy, and
allow ing and encouraging at all times voluntary
action in place of government decree? Or will we
continue to seek panaceas for every social prob
lem in massive federal expenditures and half
baked, politically-motivated, relief programs such
as the "War on Poverty" and the federal farm
program?
In short, will we emphasize indiv dualism and
enhance the creative initiative and freedom
from coercion for which the United States has
been known? Or will we, in a fit of misplaced
humanitarianism, erect a Brave New World,
a world ol stifling conformity and dulling secur
ity
Symbolic of this conflict between the individ
ual and the state is the second fundamental ques
tion of this campaign. This question concerns
the course of United States foreign policy vis
a ri.s international Communism.
The choice here is between two sets of basic
presuppositions which form the basis for policy
decisions:
• Is Communism or the Soviet Union "mel
lowing," with an end to the Cold War in sight?
• Or is "peaceful coexistence," as Pravda
said on September 2S, 19fi4, "only one weapon
in the battle against imperialism and the crimes
of the United States, the world imperialist gen
darme ?
Will a policy succeed which assumes that
true peace can be achieved at the conference
table or by "setting a good example" for the So
viets, or w ill such a policy result in the steady re
treat of the West before never-ceasing Commu
nist pressures, particularly in the underdeveloped
areas?
In short, is it possible to achieve peace
through mere negotiations and compromise, or
must it be won by working to reduce the power
of that force which prevents the attainment of
peace?
These two basic issues—the role of the state
with respect to the conflicting claims of freedom
and security, and the global struggle between
freedom and Communism—are, bv am measure,
the great questions of our time, the major di
lemmas confronting our civilization.
It is on the basis ol these issues that we
strough up'e the election of Barrv Goldwater

as President of the United States.
Senator Goidwater, as he himself has the
humility to admit, is hardly the ideal candidate.
Mis shortcomings are many.
Hnt it has been characteristic of this cam
paign for the Senator's detractors to overlook
(a) the serious shortcomings of

Lyndon Johnson, and (b) the
qualities of leadership wit h
which Gold water can justly be
credited.
In the area ol practical lead
ership, Goklwatcr has demon
strated during the Republican
convention and throughout the
subsequent campaign the impor
tant ability to gather around
him knowledgeable and compe
tent ad\ isors and to hear their
views before making important
decisions.
Six task forces composed of

leading experts in every field
have been organized to make policy and pro
grain proposals—demonstrating the necessary
ability of any administration to take practical
steps toward realization of the ideals for which
it stands.
In character, Barry Goldwater is a refreshing
combination of the pragmatist and the idealist.
He is best known, of course, for his idealism
rather than for is pragmatism, for integrity rather
than expediency. In taking stands on principle
(as in the votes on the Test Ban Treaty or the
Civil flights Bill), he has shown himself, in even*
sense of the term as it was used by John F. Ken
ned)', a profile in courage. This devotion to prin
ciple, we submit, is an important virtue too often
lacking in our politicians.
But to temper his idealism, Goldwater has a
keen understanding of the practical limitations
on w hat he, if elected, could achieve. While bis
ideals differ radically from those of the present
administration, his programs (especially in the
fields of tax reform, labor legislation, education,

be otherwise.

lint besides the hazy issues
created by this campaigns peculiar rhetoric,
there are two overriding and fundamental ques
tions which will be answered in tin's election.
These, we suggest, should be the ultimate basis
for making a choice.
The first question concerns the manner in
which America will approach the great domestic
problems which will coniront it in the coming
years — problems such as civil rights, the wel
fare of the aged, improved education, urban
blight, chronic poverty, and the cybernetic revo
lution.
Will we face these problems, and their in
creased demands on government, with a view to
ward preserving and strengthening the federal
system, with its division of powers and local par
ticipation and responsibility. Or will we continue
the trend tow ard centralization and loss of local
and state control?
Will we use prudence in our search for the
cures to social ills, refusing to tamper unneces
sarily with the economy, considering with care
tlit* full consequences of a proposed policy, and
allow ing and encouraging at all times voluntary
action in place of government decree? Or will we
continue to seek panaceas for every social prob
lem in massive federal expenditures and half
baked, politically-motivated, relief programs such
as the "War on Poverty" and the federal farm
program?
In short, will we emphasize indiv dualism and
enhance the creative initiative and freedom
from coercion for which the United States has
been known? Or will we, in a fit of misplaced
humanitarianism, erect a Brave New World,
a world ol stifling conformity and dulling secur
ity
Symbolic of this conflict between the individ
ual and the state is the second fundamental ques
tion of this campaign. This question concerns
the course of United States foreign policy vis
a ri.s international Communism.
The choice here is between two sets of basic
presuppositions which form the basis for policy
decisions:
• Is Communism or the Soviet Union "mel
lowing," with an end to the Cold War in sight?
• Or is "peaceful coexistence," as Pravda
said on September 2S, 19fi4, "only one weapon
in the battle against imperialism and the crimes
of the United States, the world imperialist gen
darme ?
Will a policy succeed which assumes that
true peace can be achieved at the conference
table or by "setting a good example" for the So
viets, or w ill such a policy result in the steady re
treat of the West before never-ceasing Commu
nist pressures, particularly in the underdeveloped
areas?
In short, is it possible to achieve peace
through mere negotiations and compromise, or
must it be won by working to reduce the power
of that force which prevents the attainment of
peace?
These two basic issues—the role of the state
with respect to the conflicting claims of freedom
and security, and the global struggle between
freedom and Communism—are, bv am measure,
the great questions of our time, the major di
lemmas confronting our civilization.
It is on the basis ol these issues that we
strough up'e the election of Barrv Goldwater

as President of the United States.
Senator Goidwater, as he himself has the
humility to admit, is hardly the ideal candidate.
Mis shortcomings are many.
Hnt it has been characteristic of this cam
paign for the Senator's detractors to overlook
(a) the serious shortcomings of

Lyndon Johnson, and (b) the
qualities of leadership wit h
which Gold water can justly be
credited.
In the area ol practical lead
ership, Goklwatcr has demon
strated during the Republican
convention and throughout the
subsequent campaign the impor
tant ability to gather around
him knowledgeable and compe
tent ad\ isors and to hear their
views before making important
decisions.
Six task forces composed of

leading experts in every field
have been organized to make policy and pro
grain proposals—demonstrating the necessary
ability of any administration to take practical
steps toward realization of the ideals for which
it stands.
In character, Barry Goldwater is a refreshing
combination of the pragmatist and the idealist.
He is best known, of course, for his idealism
rather than for is pragmatism, for integrity rather
than expediency. In taking stands on principle
(as in the votes on the Test Ban Treaty or the
Civil flights Bill), he has shown himself, in even*
sense of the term as it was used by John F. Ken
ned)', a profile in courage. This devotion to prin
ciple, we submit, is an important virtue too often
lacking in our politicians.
But to temper his idealism, Goldwater has a
keen understanding of the practical limitations
on w hat he, if elected, could achieve. While bis
ideals differ radically from those of the present
administration, his programs (especially in the
fields of tax reform, labor legislation, education,
and streamlining of government) have been mod
erate and practical, exhibiting if anything the
caution one would expect of a true conservative.
It is on the basis of his philosophy, however,
that Goldwater deserves strongest support. We
believe that the application of conservative prin
ciples to the practical problems of government
will bring myriad, long-needed reforms.
A Goldwater administration would put in
the service of the government men w ho too long
have been ignored in our highest councils, busi
nessmen and academicians who would initiate
long overdue changes.
We can only agree with Goldwater when be
says that "the tide has been running against free
dom." Surely there can be no mistaking the
trend in our domestic affairs toward greater cen
tralization, nor the trend in foreign affairs to
ward increasing Communist power.
The only hope of stemming that tide, and
perhaps of reversing it, is to elect to office men
who will seek to limit and decrease their own
power and to reverse the course of the Cold
War.
Only bv electing men like Goldwater can we
bring to government an essential distrust of con
centrated power, a concern for local and state
responsibility, and a will to contain the size of
government and its influence over the individual.
Only by electing men like Goldw ater can we
restore in the highest offices of the land an appre
ciation for and understanding of the private en
terprise economy as well as the will to preserve
that system and to prevent the passage of short
sighted legislation which would undermine it.
And only In electing men like Goldwater
can the foreign policy of this countrv be shaped
around a forward strategy in the Cold War, a
strategy aimed at reducing Communist power
and strengthening the Western Alliance, a stra
tegy based on a realistic appraisal of the Commu
nist movement, rather than one based on fear,
indecisiv eness, and wishful thinking.
These considerations, we believe, provide im
portant and compelling reasons to support the
liepublican ticket on November .'I

Tin* 1964 Presidential election mav well he
judged by lutnre historians as the most profound
and decisive political confrontation in modern
times.
This year, as never hetore, the American elec
torate stands at a major crossroads: its decision
is likeh to determine the course

of United States policy for dec
ades to come.
Unfortunate!) the magnitude
ol the choice to be made on No
vember o has been clouded and
contused by a shallow, laek-lns
ter campaign — a campaign of
over-harsh invective and false
issues, rather than meaningful
debate.
Given the personalities of
the candidates and the nature
and depth of tile philosophic di
vision, perhaps this con Id not
be otherwise.
