# The 						Political Scene
## Double Standard Applied To Goldwater, Johnson

"What would have happened it W alter Jenkins had been Barn
Goldwater's top aide and confidant of i! 5 years." 1 a evnical obser
| ver ol the political scene asked recently.
What indeed? The remark highlighted one ot the most obvi
: ous teatures of this year's election campaign. \ double-standard

unrivaled in memory is being ap-*
plied lo Ihe two major candidates. 1
Republicans are condemned Cor
things of which the Democrats ;ire
at least as guilty.
A Republican film on moral
tecay on which a single shol of

a strip-teaser ap
pears is turned
into a subject
for widespread
censure without
the film even be

a Democrat film,
in which Sena
tor Goldwater is

I depicted as a mean ogre who*
! would destroy little daisy-picking
girls and poison our milk, is |
I widely televised with nary a com-
I ment from any hut the Gold-!
! water camp.
Civil Rights Comparison
Civil rights is even more indica
tive. Lyndon Johnson's recent
| pro-civil rights stance can be com- 1
• pared with St. Paul's miraculous |
| conversion on the <oad to Damas-
I cus, with even money on the win
ner.
In 19.39 he said, "I have always
I been opposed to forced integra- j
tion, and I have not changed my
mind on this issue." In 1960,
Johnson voted with the Southern!
bloc on 13 of their 19 amendments j
to the civil rights bill. His recent |
advocacy of civil rights blots oui
all uncomfortable memories, how
ever.
But Senator Goldwater, again,
has fangs. Although his Senate
voting up to 1960 was slightly
more liberal on civil rights than
j Johnson's, according to one study,
i and although he supported five
I of the seven sections of the 1.964 1
j Civil Rights Act. he is tarred as j
! "anti-Negro." Never mind that
his objections to the other two!
| sections were on constitutional
grounds, or that President Ken
| nedy had himself opposed the
j F.E.P.C. proposal in 1963. Sen
ators are not to be concerned with :
such trivialities.
Lyndon Johnson's alterations
! arc "necessities of political life."
I But whenever Senator Goldwater
J makes a slight alteration in pol-'
i icy, it is "day-to-day mind-ehang-1
! ing." A better idea of the real con- j
i victions of these two men on civil
! rights can be gained from examin
ing their actions unrelated to!
j their present careers.
Past. Actions
j Senator Goldwater is admitted!
even by ardent left-winger Fred
| Cook, in his Barry Goldwater: K.v
I tremist of High!" ( which the
Democrats are peddling at cut
rate), to have been a leader in
Arizona integration work.
"One of his first major proj
ects fas leader of a reform group
on Phoenix's City Council| was
the desegregation of eating fae
lities at the municipally owned:
Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.
Though Goldwater in 1961 was
to vote against the civil rights bill
. . . he, personally, has never dis
played any racial prejudice." says j
Cook. Goldwater was "instru
mental in forcing the desegrega
tion of the Arizona Air National
j Guard." <page 52.)
Has Lyndon Johnson shown
any such concern in his personal
' life? Here is a clause which he
j inserted in a private deed of sale
i on October 23, 1915:
"No part of the above de
| scribed premises shall ever be
conveyed or in any way trans-;
ferred, demised, leased, or rented
to any person or persons of Afri
can descent; nor ever be held in
any way by or for such person
or person? . "

Two LBJ Platforms
it is common knowledge that
| Johnson ran in two thoroughly
contradictory platforms in 1960,
[the national Democratic one
promising liberal actions and the
| Texas Dixiecral one opposing
| them, from sit-ins to abolition of
the Connally Amendment, But.
his apologists tell us, that" was
necessary i read: expedient?) be
cause of •ho views of Texans.
One could go on, of course, giv
ing such quotes as LB.l's 1957
statement on Little Rock: "There
should be no troops from either
* side patrolling our schools." Or
i extremism, 1960: "We don't want
the support of the oddballs on
ihe left or right the ADA or the
; KKK."
In truth, Senator Goldwater's
positions have been much more
consistent than those of any poli
tician in recent memory. This is
j because of the large element of
| principle informing his positions.
His proposals are not the gerry
built "remedies" of a vote-seeking
politico. He sticks by his positions
1 in the face of the most virulent
| storms of criticism from the lib-
I eral press.
Thus he voted against the test
j ban. because of military and stra
-1 tegie considerations, when he was
! being encouraged to find an ex
! euse to support it. Thus he regis
tered his disapproval of two sec
tions of the civil rights bill, de
spite widespread speculation that
i he might vote for it in order to
court Republican liberals. Thus
| he stuck doggedly by his position
•on control of nuclear weapons,
until finally it became known that
, his proposals had been official
1 policy before the Johnson Admin
i istration took office.
Principles vs. Specifics
Those without deep principles
underlying their political phil
osophies or those who never
: enunciate them need not worry
about possible conflicts with the
necessities of public action. Those
who, like Goldwater, spell them
out for all the world to see, face
| salvos of vituperation at the
slightest diviation.
Goldwater's position on the in
come tax is quite illustrative in
this regard: "I am against the
i progressive feature of the income
j tax, but I wouldn't reduce the
| progressive feature and nothing
else, beca us c this wouldn't
I work. . .
The supposed inconsistencies
J in the Senator's public statements
can often be traced to just this
dichotomy sometimes he dis-
I cusses idealistic goals (much as
Hubert Humphrey advocates the
admission of Rod China "some
day"), while at other times he
makes specific proposals.
The shifts in Lyndon Johnson's
positions (.which have earned
him the name "The Texas Mug
wump"! are real, however, and
appear to bo dictated by nothing
I more than appealing to this group
| of voters, or that one.
Not Goldwater vs. St. Paid
The voter must remember that
lie is not choosing between Barry
Goldwater and some abstract,
ideal candidate who embodies
every virtue and agrees with him
on all issues. Those who disagree
with Goldwater half the time also
disagree with Johnson that much.
Some assuredly cannot fully sup
port Senator Goldwater. Bui
many of these might find that,
in examining their hearts and
consciences, they have even less
basis for supporting Lyndon
Johnson.
Goldwater is, after all, not run
nim* ;i!' dust SI P.inl

Two LBJ Platforms
it is common knowledge that

[the national Democratic one

the Connally Amendment, But.
his apologists tell us, that" was
necessary i read: expedient?) be
cause of •ho views of Texans.
One could go on, of course, giv
ing such quotes as LB.l's 1957
statement on Little Rock: "There
should be no troops from either
* side patrolling our schools." Or
i extremism, 1960: "We don't want
the support of the oddballs on
ihe left or right the ADA or the
; KKK."
In truth, Senator Goldwater's
positions have been much more
consistent than those of any poli
tician in recent memory. This is
j because of the large element of
| principle informing his positions.
His proposals are not the gerry
built "remedies" of a vote-seeking
politico. He sticks by his positions
1 in the face of the most virulent
| storms of criticism from the lib-
I eral press.
Thus he voted against the test
j ban. because of military and stra
-1 tegie considerations, when he was
! being encouraged to find an ex
! euse to support it. Thus he regis
tered his disapproval of two sec
tions of the civil rights bill, de
spite widespread speculation that
i he might vote for it in order to
court Republican liberals. Thus
| he stuck doggedly by his position
•on control of nuclear weapons,
until finally it became known that
, his proposals had been official
1 policy before the Johnson Admin
i istration took office.
Principles vs. Specifics
Those without deep principles
underlying their political phil
osophies or those who never
: enunciate them need not worry
about possible conflicts with the
necessities of public action. Those
who, like Goldwater, spell them
out for all the world to see, face
| salvos of vituperation at the
slightest diviation.
Goldwater's position on the in
come tax is quite illustrative in
this regard: "I am against the
i progressive feature of the income
j tax, but I wouldn't reduce the
| progressive feature and nothing
else, beca us c this wouldn't
I work. . .
The supposed inconsistencies
J in the Senator's public statements
can often be traced to just this
dichotomy sometimes he dis-
I cusses idealistic goals (much as
Hubert Humphrey advocates the
admission of Rod China "some
day"), while at other times he
makes specific proposals.
The shifts in Lyndon Johnson's
positions (.which have earned
him the name "The Texas Mug
wump"! are real, however, and
appear to bo dictated by nothing
I more than appealing to this group
| of voters, or that one.
Not Goldwater vs. St. Paid
The voter must remember that
lie is not choosing between Barry
Goldwater and some abstract,
ideal candidate who embodies
every virtue and agrees with him
on all issues. Those who disagree
with Goldwater half the time also
disagree with Johnson that much.
Some assuredly cannot fully sup
port Senator Goldwater. Bui
many of these might find that,
in examining their hearts and
consciences, they have even less
basis for supporting Lyndon
Johnson.

Two LBJ Platforms
it is common knowledge that

the Connally Amendment, But.
his apologists tell us, that" was
necessary i read: expedient?) be
cause of •ho views of Texans.
One could go on, of course, giv
ing such quotes as LB.l's 1957
statement on Little Rock: "There
should be no troops from either
* side patrolling our schools." Or
i extremism, 1960: "We don't want
the support of the oddballs on
ihe left or right the ADA or the
; KKK."
In truth, Senator Goldwater's
positions have been much more
consistent than those of any poli
tician in recent memory. This is
j because of the large element of
| principle informing his positions.
His proposals are not the gerry
built "remedies" of a vote-seeking
politico. He sticks by his positions
1 in the face of the most virulent
| storms of criticism from the lib-
I eral press.
Thus he voted against the test
j ban. because of military and stra
-1 tegie considerations, when he was
! being encouraged to find an ex
! euse to support it. Thus he regis
tered his disapproval of two sec
tions of the civil rights bill, de
spite widespread speculation that
i he might vote for it in order to
court Republican liberals. Thus
| he stuck doggedly by his position
•on control of nuclear weapons,
until finally it became known that
, his proposals had been official
1 policy before the Johnson Admin
i istration took office.
Principles vs. Specifics
Those without deep principles
underlying their political phil
osophies or those who never
: enunciate them need not worry
about possible conflicts with the
necessities of public action. Those
who, like Goldwater, spell them
out for all the world to see, face
| salvos of vituperation at the
slightest diviation.
Goldwater's position on the in
come tax is quite illustrative in
this regard: "I am against the
i progressive feature of the income
j tax, but I wouldn't reduce the
| progressive feature and nothing
else, beca us c this wouldn't
I work. . .
The supposed inconsistencies
J in the Senator's public statements
can often be traced to just this
dichotomy sometimes he dis-
I cusses idealistic goals (much as
Hubert Humphrey advocates the
admission of Rod China "some
day"), while at other times he
makes specific proposals.
The shifts in Lyndon Johnson's
positions (.which have earned
him the name "The Texas Mug
wump"! are real, however, and
appear to bo dictated by nothing
I more than appealing to this group
| of voters, or that one.
Not Goldwater vs. St. Paid
The voter must remember that
lie is not choosing between Barry
Goldwater and some abstract,
ideal candidate who embodies
every virtue and agrees with him
on all issues. Those who disagree
with Goldwater half the time also
disagree with Johnson that much.
Some assuredly cannot fully sup
port Senator Goldwater. Bui
many of these might find that,
in examining their hearts and
consciences, they have even less
basis for supporting Lyndon
Johnson.

In truth, Senator Goldwater's
positions have been much more
consistent than those of any poli
tician in recent memory. This is
j because of the large element of
| principle informing his positions.
His proposals are not the gerry
built "remedies" of a vote-seeking
politico. He sticks by his positions
1 in the face of the most virulent
| storms of criticism from the lib-
I eral press.
Thus he voted against the test
j ban. because of military and stra
-1 tegie considerations, when he was
! being encouraged to find an ex
! euse to support it. Thus he regis
tered his disapproval of two sec
tions of the civil rights bill, de
spite widespread speculation that
i he might vote for it in order to
court Republican liberals. Thus
| he stuck doggedly by his position
•on control of nuclear weapons,
until finally it became known that
, his proposals had been official
1 policy before the Johnson Admin
i istration took office.
Principles vs. Specifics
Those without deep principles
underlying their political phil
osophies or those who never
: enunciate them need not worry
about possible conflicts with the
necessities of public action. Those
who, like Goldwater, spell them
out for all the world to see, face
| salvos of vituperation at the
slightest diviation.
Goldwater's position on the in
come tax is quite illustrative in
this regard: "I am against the
i progressive feature of the income
j tax, but I wouldn't reduce the
| progressive feature and nothing
else, beca us c this wouldn't
I work. . .
The supposed inconsistencies
J in the Senator's public statements
can often be traced to just this
dichotomy sometimes he dis-
I cusses idealistic goals (much as
Hubert Humphrey advocates the
admission of Rod China "some
day"), while at other times he
makes specific proposals.
The shifts in Lyndon Johnson's
positions (.which have earned
him the name "The Texas Mug
wump"! are real, however, and
appear to bo dictated by nothing
I more than appealing to this group
| of voters, or that one.
Not Goldwater vs. St. Paid
The voter must remember that
lie is not choosing between Barry
Goldwater and some abstract,
ideal candidate who embodies
every virtue and agrees with him
on all issues. Those who disagree
with Goldwater half the time also
disagree with Johnson that much.
Some assuredly cannot fully sup
port Senator Goldwater. Bui
many of these might find that,
in examining their hearts and
consciences, they have even less
basis for supporting Lyndon
Johnson.

• pared with St. Paul's miraculous |

I cus, with even money on the win
ner.
In 19.39 he said, "I have always
I been opposed to forced integra- j
tion, and I have not changed my
mind on this issue." In 1960,
Johnson voted with the Southern!
bloc on 13 of their 19 amendments j
to the civil rights bill. His recent |
advocacy of civil rights blots oui
all uncomfortable memories, how
ever.
But Senator Goldwater, again,
has fangs. Although his Senate
voting up to 1960 was slightly
more liberal on civil rights than
j Johnson's, according to one study,
i and although he supported five
I of the seven sections of the 1.964 1
j Civil Rights Act. he is tarred as j
! "anti-Negro." Never mind that
his objections to the other two!
| sections were on constitutional
grounds, or that President Ken

j F.E.P.C. proposal in 1963. Sen
ators are not to be concerned with :
such trivialities.

J makes a slight alteration in pol-'
i icy, it is "day-to-day mind-ehang-1

i victions of these two men on civil
! rights can be gained from examin
ing their actions unrelated to!
j their present careers.

j Senator Goldwater is admitted!
even by ardent left-winger Fred
| Cook, in his Barry Goldwater: K.v
I tremist of High!" ( which the
Democrats are peddling at cut
rate), to have been a leader in
Arizona integration work.
"One of his first major proj
ects fas leader of a reform group
on Phoenix's City Council| was
the desegregation of eating fae
lities at the municipally owned:
Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.
Though Goldwater in 1961 was
to vote against the civil rights bill
. . . he, personally, has never dis
played any racial prejudice." says j
Cook. Goldwater was "instru
mental in forcing the desegrega
tion of the Arizona Air National
j Guard." <page 52.)
Has Lyndon Johnson shown
any such concern in his personal
' life? Here is a clause which he
j inserted in a private deed of sale
i on October 23, 1915:
"No part of the above de
| scribed premises shall ever be
