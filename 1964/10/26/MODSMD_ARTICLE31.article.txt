## Red Chinese A-Bomb No Argument For Recognition 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
As one might have supposed, Hed China's sueeess in detonat
ing an atomic bomb is qnickh being parlayed into a diplomatic
imperative to admit her into the United Nations. The reasoning is
as follows: "Inasmuch as Red China has, by virtue oi this great
technological breakthrough, become an indisputably great power.

we can no longer pretend that she*
doesn't exist."
There are several things wrong j
with tlicit statement, the analysis j

of which should
however a w a i t
a moment's
thought to the
sublime) 1 imper
atives of the
American politi
ca 1 campaign.
The existing sit
uation is this:
t li o Democratic
and the Repub-

lican Party Platforms are hot h
against the recognition of Red
China. Any amateur observer of
the political scene could bet with
considerable security one-thou
sand-to-one that neither Mr. John
son nor Mr. Humphrey will in
the next two weeks advertise any
change in their position on Rei
China. And any betting man wilh
;i sharp political eye will bet one
thousand-to-one that in the ensu
ing period, assuming the Demo
cratic Administration is reelected,
their position will change.
l. T N Admission?
Not noticeably. The probable
route is the United Nations. What
a Johnson Administration is likely
to do during 1965-1966- is to
allow a majority in Ihe United
Nations to go ahead and admit
•Red China. 1 sa\ "allow" be
cause il is indisputably a fact of
diplomatic life that if the Unite I
States with all its power and
prestige were to inform th e
United Nations in unambiguous
terms that we would not tolerate
the admission of Red China, that
would settle the matter; for good
and <i 11. In short, if Red China i.
admitted during the next period
even if the United Slates were
to vote against admission it
would be only because of the tacit
acquiescence of the U.S.
As for the arguments. The most
vulnerable surely is the argument
that by failing to recognize Red
China we "ignore" her existence.
Surely the contrary is true. It is
impossible to ignore the existence
of Red China. There, after all, she
is. The decision not to recognize
her is above all, however para
doxical. a recognition of her ex
istence - and a corollary com
mitment not to recognize her
legitimacy.
If a labor union decides to boy-

' cott the Kohler Manufacturing
Company, it can hardly be main
tained that the Union "ignores"
Kohler's existence: on the con
trary, the union doubly recog
nizes it the Kohler Company
exists and moreover must pre
cisely be boycotted, according to
; the union's argument.
I What difference has the bomb
; made? Only the difference th a t
! precisely Red China has sought to
j make by detonating it. As a mili-
I tary threat it is remote. She has
no delivery system, no means to
' produce the bomb on a scale suffi
cient to threaten the peace of
1 the world. She has already threat
ened the peace of the world in
Korea, in Laos, in South Vietnam,
way before her ownership of the
bomb.
Itnmh Meant To Panic
Precisely the point of the bomb
is not to exert military pressure,
but diplomatic pressure. Our panic
in the face of the existence of
the bomb i- precisely what Red
1 China had in mind for us. The
more dangerous the enemy tie
comes. surely, the greater need
to isolate her and to choke t<>
death her potential threat.
The challenge posed by Re d
China's bomb is precisely to
; America's diplomatic and military
resources. The challenge is to
fight her salient imperialisms
tooth and nail, in Laos, and South
j Vietnam, an I Indonesia, and In
dia. To embargo the exportation
i of food products. To mobilize Far
Eastern support against her. Ad
mit her into the United Nations
11i<i you do to her prestige, to her
presumption of Far Eastern pre
eminence. precisely what she
hopes, and supposes, we and the
UN will do.
It would bo timely for Senator
Gold water to reiterate his recom
mendation of several years ago:
that if the UN should submit to
Red China's blackmail, the United
States will answer by saying: we
will withdraw. Senator Gold
water was absolutely correct in
suggesting that such a crisis
would never, under such circum
stances, occur. We have only to
say we would withdraw in the
; event of recognition, in order to
I guarantee absolutely that recog
nition would never happen.

I What difference has the bomb
; made? Only the difference th a t
! precisely Red China has sought to
j make by detonating it. As a mili-
I tary threat it is remote. She has
no delivery system, no means to
' produce the bomb on a scale suffi
cient to threaten the peace of
1 the world. She has already threat
ened the peace of the world in
Korea, in Laos, in South Vietnam,
way before her ownership of the
bomb.
Itnmh Meant To Panic
Precisely the point of the bomb
is not to exert military pressure,
but diplomatic pressure. Our panic
in the face of the existence of
the bomb i- precisely what Red
1 China had in mind for us. The
more dangerous the enemy tie
comes. surely, the greater need
to isolate her and to choke t<>
death her potential threat.
The challenge posed by Re d
China's bomb is precisely to
; America's diplomatic and military
resources. The challenge is to
fight her salient imperialisms
tooth and nail, in Laos, and South
j Vietnam, an I Indonesia, and In
dia. To embargo the exportation
i of food products. To mobilize Far
Eastern support against her. Ad
mit her into the United Nations
11i<i you do to her prestige, to her
presumption of Far Eastern pre
eminence. precisely what she
hopes, and supposes, we and the
UN will do.
It would bo timely for Senator
Gold water to reiterate his recom
mendation of several years ago:
that if the UN should submit to
Red China's blackmail, the United
States will answer by saying: we
will withdraw. Senator Gold
water was absolutely correct in
suggesting that such a crisis
would never, under such circum
stances, occur. We have only to
say we would withdraw in the
; event of recognition, in order to
I guarantee absolutely that recog
nition would never happen.

As one might have supposed, Hed China's sueeess in detonat
ing an atomic bomb is qnickh being parlayed into a diplomatic
imperative to admit her into the United Nations. The reasoning is
as follows: "Inasmuch as Red China has, by virtue oi this great
technological breakthrough, become an indisputably great power.

we can no longer pretend that she*
doesn't exist."
There are several things wrong j
with tlicit statement, the analysis j

of which should
however a w a i t
a moment's
thought to the
sublime) 1 imper
atives of the
American politi
ca 1 campaign.
The existing sit
uation is this:
t li o Democratic
and the Repub-

lican Party Platforms are hot h
against the recognition of Red
China. Any amateur observer of
the political scene could bet with
considerable security one-thou
sand-to-one that neither Mr. John
son nor Mr. Humphrey will in
the next two weeks advertise any
change in their position on Rei
China. And any betting man wilh
;i sharp political eye will bet one
thousand-to-one that in the ensu
ing period, assuming the Demo
cratic Administration is reelected,
their position will change.
l. T N Admission?
Not noticeably. The probable
route is the United Nations. What
a Johnson Administration is likely
to do during 1965-1966- is to
allow a majority in Ihe United
Nations to go ahead and admit
•Red China. 1 sa\ "allow" be
cause il is indisputably a fact of
diplomatic life that if the Unite I
States with all its power and
prestige were to inform th e
United Nations in unambiguous
terms that we would not tolerate
the admission of Red China, that
would settle the matter; for good
and <i 11. In short, if Red China i.
admitted during the next period
even if the United Slates were
to vote against admission it
would be only because of the tacit
acquiescence of the U.S.
As for the arguments. The most
vulnerable surely is the argument
that by failing to recognize Red
China we "ignore" her existence.
Surely the contrary is true. It is
impossible to ignore the existence
of Red China. There, after all, she
is. The decision not to recognize
her is above all, however para
doxical. a recognition of her ex
istence - and a corollary com
mitment not to recognize her
legitimacy.

BUCKLEY
As one might have supposed, Hed China's sueeess in detonat
ing an atomic bomb is qnickh being parlayed into a diplomatic
imperative to admit her into the United Nations. The reasoning is
as follows: "Inasmuch as Red China has, by virtue oi this great
technological breakthrough, become an indisputably great power.

we can no longer pretend that she*
doesn't exist."
