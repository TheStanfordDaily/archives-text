## Arizona Debate 
### 
Dear Sir:
Although I found myself, as a
resident of Arizona, in agreement
with many of the points made by
Mr. Barry Ames in regard to eco
nomic and political conditions in
that state, I nevertheless feel
that in his haste to condemn the
inherent evils of Goldwaterism
he overlooked many factors which
account for Arizona's dismal rec
ord, factors which should not he
ascribed to conservatism per se
or to Arizona's Republicans,
It should be noted that although ;
Arizona now has a conservative ;
junior senator, Congressman, and ;
governor, it also sends a fairly
liberal Democrat to the Senate
and has two liberal Congressmen.
The Legislature is solidly Demo
rat ic, and has been since State
hood (the Republicans controlled
the State Senate 1921-23), as are
practically all elected state offi
cials.
The crime rate iti Phoenix is
admittedly scandalous, but it is I
due in many cases to "snowbirds" j
those who wish to partake of
Arizona's winter sun and let Ari-j
zona citizens pay for it. The crime !
rate, incidentally, is a major issue;
in this election the Republicans j
are using it against the incumbent
Democratic sheriff and county:
attorney.
If we are to bring up charges j
of crime and corruption, the spec-,
tacle of the impeachment of two
Democratic members of the Cor-1
poration Commission, (quashed j
by the overwhelming Democratic!
Senate after a bipartisan major-,
ity in the House had preferred the
charges) or of the indictment of
two Democratic members of the
Tax Commission on bribery
charges (conveniently (plashed
by the courts because of certain
irregularities involved with the
Democratic county attorney's
handling of evidence I would seem
to indicate that Gov. Fannin's ap-1
pointces are relatively honest in
comparison with many Democra
tic incumbents.
Although Arizona's per capita
111<<<11M' i-s indi'i'il 14> 1;11 iv i-k ti>\\ 1

it might be noted that this is gen
erally attributed to low incomes
on the part of Arizona's large In
dian population, who are wards of
the federal government, not the
state, and who go to federal
schools, use federal hospital facili
ties, and in general are kept in a
state of perpetual tutelage by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs. Dis
ease and infant mortality statis
tics should also be laid at the
doorstep of the aforesaid federal
agency. TB statistics are mislead
ing; Arizona has long been a hav
en for persons suffering from
respiratory diseases, and many
if not most of Arizona's TB suf
ferers had the disease before they
entered the state.
While Arizona's record on
health and welfare legislation is
not a proud one, lliis should not
be ascribed to "conservativism"
but rather to cow-county control
of the Senate. Gov. Fannin has re
peatedly asked the legislature to
accept Kerr-Mills; repeatedly his
proposals have died in Ihe senate.
Tax reforms have been repeatedly
urged upon the legislature and
repeatedly ignored; it now ap
pears that initiative measures
may finally break the logjam.
Finally we come to the matter
of civil rights. While Arizona's
record is not a good one, it is not
abhorrent. School segregation was
thrown out by state courts iti
1952 on the grounds used by the
U.S. Supereme Court in its 1931
decision, and the state courts or
ders were promptly complied
with. Both Phoenix and Tucson,
with Republican administrations,
recently enacted public accommo
dations ordinances after the
Democratic legislature killed pro
posed statewide legislation, and
while there is no fair housing
law. neither is there an initiative
proposal on the ballot similar to
that recently enacted in Walter
Reuthcr's bailiwick of Detroit
or to the proposal on California's
ballot which appears well on its
way to blackening California's
once envied position as a focal
point of progressive and humani
tarian legislation.
