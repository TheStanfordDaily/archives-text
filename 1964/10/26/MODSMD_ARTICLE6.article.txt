# Sweeney Out On Bond After McComb Arrest
## Campus Donates $1800 Bail Fund 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
The arrest of Stanford student
Dennis Sweeney Friday in Mc-
Comb, Mississippi, touched off a
spontaneous fund-raising drive
here which has so far netted over
$ 1,800.
Sweeney and twelve other Free
dom Project workers were taken
into custody by the McComb po
lice late Friday on charges of
ooerating a food-handling estab
lishment without a county health
certificate. Three of the arrested
were released immediately on
$100 bond. The other ten, includ
ing Sweeney, spent the night in
the Pike County jail. They are
now out on bonds financed by
syndicated columnist Drew Pear
son.
All thirteen Project workers
will stand trial in McComb this
morning. It' convicted, they face
fines of $3 to $100 each. There
is no jail term under the charge.
Judy Wallborn. Chairman of
the Mississippi Freedom Project
- Stanford group, which coordin
ated the Friday drive, reports that
part of the money collected will
be sent to McComb through the
Freedom Project's central office
in Jackson.
The remainder of the money
will be placed in a bail fund here
to be used for future emergency
situations involving Stanford stu
dent volunteers. Money collected
specifically as bail for those ar
rested Friday will be returned,
if the donor so requests, Miss
Wallborn said. Such refunds will
be made at the ASSU office today
and tomorrow from 2 to 4 p.m.
The first arrests Friday came
at 1:30 p.m. when the McComb
police entered a Project "Free
dom House" and charged three
workers with the "health certifi
cate" violation. The three were
taken into custody and then re
leased on bond. The police re
turned at 7:1.1 p.m. and arrested
ten more workers, including
Sweeney, on the same charge.
They were booked and then held
overnight in the basement of the
Pike County jail. There were no
beds in their cells, Sweeney later
reported.
ACCORDING to McComb Po
lice Chief George Guy, the basis
for the arrests was that the "over
crowding" of the McComb Free
dom House created "a boarding
house situation" for which a
county health certificate is re
quired. Another phone call to the
Pike County jail elicited the in
formation that Sweeney had been
arrested on a charge of violating
the county food code because he
"hadn't taken a bath in 90 days
. . . which comes from living with
niggers."
The arrests were first reported
here at 7:15 (PSTi by Stanford
student volunteer Marli Sehenk
j who is based in MeComh. She ex
-1 pressed grave concern for Ihe
safety of Sweeney and the others
while they remained in jail.
As news of the arrests spread,
members of the Mississippi Free
! dom Project â€” Stanford group
| began a bail-fund drive across the
j campus. Efforts were made to
(contact the McComb authorities
and to inquire as to the condi
tion of those in custody.
At 11:20, James Haas, a Stan
ford graduate presently working
for Senator Pierre Salinger,
talked with Sweeney in the Piko
County jail. Lie reported that he
and the other nine had received
fair treatment from the local po
j lice.
I TEN MINUTES LATER, how

over, an apparent crisis developed
when Stanford student Ned Borg
strom reported a phone conver
sation with a Pike County jailer
during which lie had been told
that "Sweeney has just broken
out of jail." After nearly an hour
of frantic checking, during which
several national officials were
alerted, the story proved to be
nothing more than a joke.
According to Sweeney, the 13
arrests were calculated to force
the cancelling of the Project's
"Freedom Day" scheduled for to
day. He stressed it will not be
cancelled but expressed fear that
more harrassment and arrests
were imminent. "We're headed
into the most difficult week yet,"
he said.
Four other Stanford volunteers,
including Frank Morse who was
beaten by four white in Marks,
Mississippi, last Tuesday, will ar
rive back on the campus today.
