## Campus Donates $1800 Bail Fund 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
The arrest of Stanford student
Dennis Sweeney Friday in Mc-
Comb, Mississippi, touched off a
spontaneous fund-raising drive
here which has so far netted over
$ 1,800.
Sweeney and twelve other Free
dom Project workers were taken
into custody by the McComb po
lice late Friday on charges of
ooerating a food-handling estab
lishment without a county health
certificate. Three of the arrested
were released immediately on
$100 bond. The other ten, includ
ing Sweeney, spent the night in
the Pike County jail. They are
now out on bonds financed by
syndicated columnist Drew Pear
son.
All thirteen Project workers
will stand trial in McComb this
morning. It' convicted, they face
fines of $3 to $100 each. There
is no jail term under the charge.
Judy Wallborn. Chairman of
the Mississippi Freedom Project
- Stanford group, which coordin
ated the Friday drive, reports that
part of the money collected will
be sent to McComb through the
Freedom Project's central office
in Jackson.
The remainder of the money
will be placed in a bail fund here
to be used for future emergency
situations involving Stanford stu
dent volunteers. Money collected
specifically as bail for those ar
rested Friday will be returned,
if the donor so requests, Miss
Wallborn said. Such refunds will
be made at the ASSU office today
and tomorrow from 2 to 4 p.m.
The first arrests Friday came
at 1:30 p.m. when the McComb
police entered a Project "Free
dom House" and charged three
workers with the "health certifi
cate" violation. The three were
taken into custody and then re
leased on bond. The police re
turned at 7:1.1 p.m. and arrested
ten more workers, including
Sweeney, on the same charge.
They were booked and then held
overnight in the basement of the
Pike County jail. There were no
beds in their cells, Sweeney later
reported.
ACCORDING to McComb Po
lice Chief George Guy, the basis
for the arrests was that the "over
crowding" of the McComb Free
dom House created "a boarding
house situation" for which a
county health certificate is re
quired. Another phone call to the
Pike County jail elicited the in
formation that Sweeney had been
arrested on a charge of violating
the county food code because he
"hadn't taken a bath in 90 days
. . . which comes from living with
niggers."
The arrests were first reported
here at 7:15 (PSTi by Stanford
