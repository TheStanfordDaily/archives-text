In spite ol the faet tliat "honeheacl Llnglish..' for college fresh
men lias beeome a thing ol the past, Stanford will continue to stress
fundamentals in teaching this subject, Prof. Robert \\ . Ackennan.
director of freshman LCnglish, told a Parents' Day meeting here
Saturday.

There has been major improve- *
ment in recent years because of:
the high competence of entering j
students, the concerted "post-j
Sputnik" effort on behalf of'
American high schools to improve
the curriculum, the accurate test- i
ing of the College Entrance Ex-j
amining Board, and the advanced
placement program, he said.
"The number of our freshmen
who have taken advanced place-;
ment programs in high school is
increasing steeply year by year," '
Prof. Ackennan told 1000 parents j
ol new students gathered in Me-1
morial Auditorium.
"Some 103 of our 1313 enter
ing freshmen this year completed
advanced placement programs
and took examinations: of these. |
40 scored high enough to receive :
10 free units toward the gradua
tion requirement and were ex
empted from English III."
Stanford was one of 20 univer
sities selected in 1961 for a two
year program sponsored by the
CEEB to administer special sum- j
mor training for high school Eng
lish teachers. Forty-four of the
best teachers from 37 public, pri
vate and parochial high schools
in the Bay Area were selected for
training high schools from j
which Stanford normally draws
many students, he related.
"We feel that this program has
notably improved the quality of;
college preparatory work in the
high schools represented." he told
the parents, "not only when
taught by the teachers we trained,

but because many of these teach
ers are departmental heads and
principal themselves. . . . Wc are
now more closely in touch with
the most important schools in this
part of Ihe state, and we are not
i relinquishing these contracts,"
Dr. Ackerman said, emphasizing
1 that each understands the prob
lems of the other better than ever.
Letter grades on required
themes are withheld until the
fifth week of the term to lessen
; the difference between the grades
i received for high school and col
lege-level work, ho explained.
Teaching assistants are culled
from the best graduate students
in English, many of whom are
Woodrow Wilson scholars em
barking on a teaching career.
The majority have had previous
teaching experience.
