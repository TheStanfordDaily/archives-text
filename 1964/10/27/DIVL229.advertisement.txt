"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things
not seen. For by it the men of old received divine approval. By faith we under
stand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was
made of things which do not appear." (Hebrews 11:1—3)
There is a missing dimension in the lives of certain men. These individuals
may believe they have all Ihe facts, but there are always inconsistencies in
their views. Their world-picture reflects that fact that they have not entered
fully into life by giving themselves to tho living God who made them. However,
when any individual is willing to himself become a part of life by simple faith
and trust in Jesus Christ, he makes a most amazing discovery. He finds not only
that God exists and is very real, but that the world as it really is opens up in
every direction, on every side. The first rule of life, the first key to the way
things are," is, then, that one must believe in God and be willing to meet Him
in order to discover what life is really all about:
"... without faith it is impossible to please God. For whoever would draw
near to God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek
i Him." (Hebrews 11:6)
Faith is not wishing or hoping that God might be true or pretending that
He is there. Faith acts upon the reality of the living God and moves out to claim
His promises in experience. We are led by faith to the demonstrateable con
clusion that the world of reality is vaster and greater than our physical senses
and instruments reveal to us. The Bible tells us that the entire visible world
stems from, springs out of, a vaster, deeper dimension of the spirit. ("What is
seen was made out of things which do not appear ). While the unbeliever looks
toward the visible world detected by the senses, the Christian looks to the unseen
source of the visible world: ' Not to things that are seen but to things that are
unseen; for the things which are seen are transient, but the ihings that are
unseen are eternal." (2 Corinthinians 4:1 8)
The spiritual realm, the "real world, is not a place of ghosts and shadows,
but a place where everything takes on a deeper and richer quality of life and
texture which the things of this earth only hint at (read Luke 24 and C. S. Lewis,
The Great Divorce). Thus those who have not been spiritually born, who are not
in "touch" with the unseen world all around, who are not in communication
with God by faith in Jesus Christ, are living in a world of unreality!
"Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks himself wise in
this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. For the wisdom of
this world is foolishness with Cod . . . the natural man does not receive the
gifts of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to under
stand them because they are spiritually discerned." (I Corinthinians 3:18, 19;
I Corinthinians 2:14)
If you haven't yet met Jesus Christ your world is far le:s teat than it can
be. Wake up and l.ve! Latch hold of reality and be made alive in Christ Jesus,
life in the Light is life at its fullest and best. Anything less is unreal and counter
feit!

"Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks himself wise in
this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise. For the wisdom of
this world is foolishness with Cod . . . the natural man does not receive the
gifts of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to under
stand them because they are spiritually discerned." (I Corinthinians 3:18, 19;
I Corinthinians 2:14)
If you haven't yet met Jesus Christ your world is far le:s teat than it can
be. Wake up and l.ve! Latch hold of reality and be made alive in Christ Jesus,
life in the Light is life at its fullest and best. Anything less is unreal and counter
feit!

"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things
not seen. For by it the men of old received divine approval. By faith we under
stand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was
made of things which do not appear." (Hebrews 11:1—3)
There is a missing dimension in the lives of certain men. These individuals
may believe they have all Ihe facts, but there are always inconsistencies in
their views. Their world-picture reflects that fact that they have not entered
fully into life by giving themselves to tho living God who made them. However,
when any individual is willing to himself become a part of life by simple faith
and trust in Jesus Christ, he makes a most amazing discovery. He finds not only
that God exists and is very real, but that the world as it really is opens up in
every direction, on every side. The first rule of life, the first key to the way
things are," is, then, that one must believe in God and be willing to meet Him
in order to discover what life is really all about:
"... without faith it is impossible to please God. For whoever would draw
near to God must believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek
i Him." (Hebrews 11:6)
Faith is not wishing or hoping that God might be true or pretending that
He is there. Faith acts upon the reality of the living God and moves out to claim
His promises in experience. We are led by faith to the demonstrateable con
clusion that the world of reality is vaster and greater than our physical senses
and instruments reveal to us. The Bible tells us that the entire visible world
stems from, springs out of, a vaster, deeper dimension of the spirit. ("What is
seen was made out of things which do not appear ). While the unbeliever looks
toward the visible world detected by the senses, the Christian looks to the unseen
source of the visible world: ' Not to things that are seen but to things that are
unseen; for the things which are seen are transient, but the ihings that are
unseen are eternal." (2 Corinthinians 4:1 8)
The spiritual realm, the "real world, is not a place of ghosts and shadows,
but a place where everything takes on a deeper and richer quality of life and
texture which the things of this earth only hint at (read Luke 24 and C. S. Lewis,
The Great Divorce). Thus those who have not been spiritually born, who are not
in "touch" with the unseen world all around, who are not in communication
with God by faith in Jesus Christ, are living in a world of unreality!
