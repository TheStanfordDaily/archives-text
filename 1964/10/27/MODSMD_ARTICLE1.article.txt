# Civil Rights Volunteers Call Mississippi ‘Unreal’
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
Frank Morse, D o u g Sorenson,
Mitch Miller, and Dave Harris re
turned to Stanford early yesterday
after spending over a week as Free
dom Project Volunteers in the heart
of rural Mississippi.
A week is not long, but apparently
it was long enough for them to absorb
a full measure of the violence, fear,
and bitterness which day to day de
fines the quality of life for white and
black alike.
"IT'S JUST UNHEAL," Morse ex
claimed. "It's just unreal."
He had good reason to know; he is
still suffering from the aches and
pains of a Tuesday beating he sus
tained at the hands of four whites out
side of Marks, Mississippi.
He, and his fellow worker Dave Har
ris left Marks with some haste last

Friday. just didn't want to become
another one of those statistics, and
under the circumstances, we thought
discression was the better part of
valour."
The circumstances, as Harris re
lated them, were these: "That morn
ing Frank and I got word that the
sheriff wanted to talk with us. . . .
He wouldn't say why. All we could
remember was that the last time one
Project worker was beaten they ended
up charging another COFO worker
with his beating. . . . We figured the
odds were pretty good that Deputy
Sheriff Faust was going to work at
least one of us over, so we decided
the best thing was to get out of the
county . . . fast."
THE LOCAL LAW enforcement
officers apparently have quite a repu
tation with the Negro community.
Harris elaborated, "The Sheriff. Clint
Turner, can't read or write, so his

deputy, Sanford Faust, serves as in
terpreter to the outside world. He
takes him everywhere with him —
to write up the tickets and stuff."
"Faust is 'head sadist' of the jail.
. . . When they bring some Negro in
for questioning it's Faust that gets
to do all the good work on him."
There's a rumour current in th e
Negro community, Harris related,
that Faust met a young Negro boy on
the road three weeks ago who wasn't
"courteous" to him; so he gouged
one of the boy's eyes out. The story
may not be true, but the local popu
lation has good precedent for believ
ing it.
Last spring, Harris recounted, a
young Negro, sympathetic to the civil
rights movement, was taken into
custody on a charge (legitimate) of
assault and battery. Faust "interro
gated him." Harris told the story as
he had heard it from the young Ne

gro:
"IT WAS ABOUT 90 degrees out
side, so they locked him in this little
room with no windows and turned on
two heaters. They kept him in there
for three days. He said he passed out
twice." After that they put him in a
cell and let the jailer, Jessie Sim
mons stomp on him. . . . He was con
victed and given 90 days. He served
109 days. . . . For his sentence, they
sent him around to nine different
counties all over the state to chop
cotton on private farms. . . . Now they
want to try his case over a second
time."
Harris told of another case of
Faust's brutality: "A boy I met down
there nick-named "Mudturtle" (every
body has nick-names) was arrested on
suspicion of breaking a car window.
. . . They kept him in jail for 8 days
without notifying his parents. He's
fourteen years old."

"They started to question him. and
Faust brought in a cattle prod. (A cat
tle prod is a cane-like instrument,
electrically charged; they use it to
herd cattle into trucks.) Mudturtle
had never seen one before I guess.
. . . Faust told him it was a lie-detec
tor and that all he had to do was grab
on to it and if he was telling the
truth it wouldn't hurt... so he grabed
onto it ... I guess it hurt."
THE "FAUST STORIES" go on and
Dn. "Last month," Harris recounted,
'a young Negro was jumped by a
bunch of white youths when ho was
?oing to a mass meeting. . . . His arm
.vas gashed from the elbow nearly to
the wrist. He couldn't get medical
treatment until the next morning;
there was no doctor that would treat
him.
"During the fight, a bunch of Ne
gro kids had jumped in to help. One
white boy got knifed. The police took

the Negro who gut beaten down lu
Ihe police station. They wanted him
to change his story and admit that he
had done the knifing.
"Faust got at him and started to
work on him with his fists. He hit
him—in the stomach, on the top of
his head, in his face. . . . He just kept
hitting him and everytime the boy
tried to say something, he said, 'Shut
up, Nigger.' . . . Then they put him in
jail and fed him ice-cold, frozen
beans. . . ."
Much of this brutality goes on un
known and unreported; when ii is
known, when the pressures of exter
nal publicity are applied, the number
overt incidents seems to be reduced.

Frank Morse, D o u g Sorenson,
Mitch Miller, and Dave Harris re
turned to Stanford early yesterday
after spending over a week as Free
dom Project Volunteers in the heart
of rural Mississippi.
A week is not long, but apparently
it was long enough for them to absorb
a full measure of the violence, fear,
and bitterness which day to day de
fines the quality of life for white and
black alike.
"IT'S JUST UNHEAL," Morse ex
claimed. "It's just unreal."
He had good reason to know; he is
still suffering from the aches and
pains of a Tuesday beating he sus
tained at the hands of four whites out
side of Marks, Mississippi.
He, and his fellow worker Dave Har
ris left Marks with some haste last

Friday. just didn't want to become
another one of those statistics, and
under the circumstances, we thought
discression was the better part of
valour."
The circumstances, as Harris re
lated them, were these: "That morn
ing Frank and I got word that the
sheriff wanted to talk with us. . . .
He wouldn't say why. All we could
remember was that the last time one
Project worker was beaten they ended
up charging another COFO worker
with his beating. . . . We figured the
odds were pretty good that Deputy
Sheriff Faust was going to work at
least one of us over, so we decided
the best thing was to get out of the
county . . . fast."
THE LOCAL LAW enforcement
officers apparently have quite a repu
tation with the Negro community.
Harris elaborated, "The Sheriff. Clint
Turner, can't read or write, so his

deputy, Sanford Faust, serves as in
terpreter to the outside world. He
takes him everywhere with him —
to write up the tickets and stuff."
"Faust is 'head sadist' of the jail.
. . . When they bring some Negro in
for questioning it's Faust that gets
to do all the good work on him."
There's a rumour current in th e
Negro community, Harris related,
that Faust met a young Negro boy on
the road three weeks ago who wasn't
"courteous" to him; so he gouged
one of the boy's eyes out. The story
may not be true, but the local popu
lation has good precedent for believ
ing it.
Last spring, Harris recounted, a
young Negro, sympathetic to the civil
rights movement, was taken into
custody on a charge (legitimate) of
assault and battery. Faust "interro
gated him." Harris told the story as
he had heard it from the young Ne

gro:
"IT WAS ABOUT 90 degrees out
side, so they locked him in this little
room with no windows and turned on
two heaters. They kept him in there
for three days. He said he passed out
twice." After that they put him in a
cell and let the jailer, Jessie Sim
mons stomp on him. . . . He was con
victed and given 90 days. He served
109 days. . . . For his sentence, they
sent him around to nine different
counties all over the state to chop
cotton on private farms. . . . Now they
want to try his case over a second
time."
Harris told of another case of
Faust's brutality: "A boy I met down
there nick-named "Mudturtle" (every
body has nick-names) was arrested on
suspicion of breaking a car window.
. . . They kept him in jail for 8 days
without notifying his parents. He's
fourteen years old."

"They started to question him. and
Faust brought in a cattle prod. (A cat
tle prod is a cane-like instrument,
electrically charged; they use it to
herd cattle into trucks.) Mudturtle
had never seen one before I guess.
. . . Faust told him it was a lie-detec
tor and that all he had to do was grab
on to it and if he was telling the
truth it wouldn't hurt... so he grabed
onto it ... I guess it hurt."
THE "FAUST STORIES" go on and
Dn. "Last month," Harris recounted,
'a young Negro was jumped by a
bunch of white youths when ho was
?oing to a mass meeting. . . . His arm
.vas gashed from the elbow nearly to
the wrist. He couldn't get medical
treatment until the next morning;
there was no doctor that would treat
him.
"During the fight, a bunch of Ne
gro kids had jumped in to help. One
white boy got knifed. The police took

the Negro who gut beaten down lu
Ihe police station. They wanted him
to change his story and admit that he
had done the knifing.

had never seen one before I guess.
. . . Faust told him it was a lie-detec
tor and that all he had to do was grab
on to it and if he was telling the
truth it wouldn't hurt... so he grabed
onto it ... I guess it hurt."
THE "FAUST STORIES" go on and
Dn. "Last month," Harris recounted,
'a young Negro was jumped by a
bunch of white youths when ho was
?oing to a mass meeting. . . . His arm
.vas gashed from the elbow nearly to
the wrist. He couldn't get medical
treatment until the next morning;
there was no doctor that would treat
him.
"During the fight, a bunch of Ne
gro kids had jumped in to help. One
white boy got knifed. The police took

the Negro who gut beaten down lu
Ihe police station. They wanted him
to change his story and admit that he
had done the knifing.
"Faust got at him and started to
work on him with his fists. He hit
him—in the stomach, on the top of
his head, in his face. . . . He just kept
hitting him and everytime the boy
tried to say something, he said, 'Shut
up, Nigger.' . . . Then they put him in
jail and fed him ice-cold, frozen
beans. . . ."
Much of this brutality goes on un
known and unreported; when ii is
known, when the pressures of exter
nal publicity are applied, the number
overt incidents seems to be reduced.

Frank Morse, D o u g Sorenson,
Mitch Miller, and Dave Harris re
turned to Stanford early yesterday
after spending over a week as Free
dom Project Volunteers in the heart
of rural Mississippi.
A week is not long, but apparently
it was long enough for them to absorb
a full measure of the violence, fear,
and bitterness which day to day de
fines the quality of life for white and
black alike.
"IT'S JUST UNHEAL," Morse ex
claimed. "It's just unreal."
He had good reason to know; he is
still suffering from the aches and
pains of a Tuesday beating he sus
tained at the hands of four whites out
side of Marks, Mississippi.
He, and his fellow worker Dave Har
ris left Marks with some haste last

Friday. just didn't want to become
another one of those statistics, and
under the circumstances, we thought
discression was the better part of
valour."
The circumstances, as Harris re
lated them, were these: "That morn
ing Frank and I got word that the
sheriff wanted to talk with us. . . .
He wouldn't say why. All we could
remember was that the last time one
Project worker was beaten they ended
up charging another COFO worker
with his beating. . . . We figured the
odds were pretty good that Deputy
Sheriff Faust was going to work at
least one of us over, so we decided
the best thing was to get out of the
county . . . fast."
THE LOCAL LAW enforcement
officers apparently have quite a repu
tation with the Negro community.
Harris elaborated, "The Sheriff. Clint
Turner, can't read or write, so his

deputy, Sanford Faust, serves as in
terpreter to the outside world. He
takes him everywhere with him —
to write up the tickets and stuff."
"Faust is 'head sadist' of the jail.
. . . When they bring some Negro in
for questioning it's Faust that gets
to do all the good work on him."
There's a rumour current in th e
Negro community, Harris related,
that Faust met a young Negro boy on
the road three weeks ago who wasn't
"courteous" to him; so he gouged
one of the boy's eyes out. The story
may not be true, but the local popu
lation has good precedent for believ
ing it.
Last spring, Harris recounted, a
young Negro, sympathetic to the civil
rights movement, was taken into
custody on a charge (legitimate) of
assault and battery. Faust "interro
gated him." Harris told the story as
he had heard it from the young Ne

gro:
"IT WAS ABOUT 90 degrees out
side, so they locked him in this little
room with no windows and turned on
two heaters. They kept him in there
for three days. He said he passed out
twice." After that they put him in a
cell and let the jailer, Jessie Sim
mons stomp on him. . . . He was con
victed and given 90 days. He served
109 days. . . . For his sentence, they
sent him around to nine different
counties all over the state to chop
cotton on private farms. . . . Now they
want to try his case over a second
time."
Harris told of another case of
Faust's brutality: "A boy I met down
there nick-named "Mudturtle" (every
body has nick-names) was arrested on
suspicion of breaking a car window.
. . . They kept him in jail for 8 days
without notifying his parents. He's
fourteen years old."

"They started to question him. and
Faust brought in a cattle prod. (A cat
tle prod is a cane-like instrument,
electrically charged; they use it to
herd cattle into trucks.) Mudturtle
had never seen one before I guess.
. . . Faust told him it was a lie-detec
tor and that all he had to do was grab
on to it and if he was telling the
truth it wouldn't hurt... so he grabed
onto it ... I guess it hurt."
