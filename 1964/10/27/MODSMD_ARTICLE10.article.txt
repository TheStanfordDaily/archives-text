## Papers Published For Trial Period 
### BOB BJORING 
Opinion, a trial project "to
provoke controversy and a freer
exchange of ideas on campus,"
was initialed yesterday by ASSU
j President Scott Mcßride.
The project will provide any
I permanent or voluntary group
registered under the ASSU with
the means for free distribution of
mimeographed statements.
'The President's office will
handle the program until Novem
ber 5, Mcßride said. "At that time
I will take the idea to the Legis-
I lature, if the trial period is suc
cessful, and ask for funds and a
j permanent organization."
FOII THE TRIAI, period, elig
ible groups will be able to turn
a finished form of their state
, ment in to the ASSU secretary.
: Tt must be confined to a stand
; ard 8V« by 11 inch page. The sec
retary will stencil the statement,
: run off 500 copies and distribute
l it to key locations on the campus.
The kiosks and the post office
j have already been arranged as
j distribution points. Mcßride said
I negotiations are underway to es
! tablish distribution points in the
jTresidder Union meal area.
"If the program works as well
i as I would hope," he stated, "we
may be forced to ask the groups
lo type their own stencils and
distribute the statements them
j selves. However, the mimeo
graphing services will be com
pletely free."
"CENSORSHIP is only after
[ the fact," Mcßride continued.
| "That is lo say. the chairman of
i a group is responsible for any
; language used in poor taste, any
malicious comments, etc. Such
control applies fo all other pub
lications of the university. How
! ever, nothing will be suppressed
so long as it is printable."
Statements will bo due in to
the ASSU secretary by noon of
: the day preceding the morning
| of distribution.
; IN THE PAST, groups who
: wishes to issue statements had
I to arrange for the printing and
| distribution themselves. Although
| this represents only a nominal
! cost, it requires time and organ
| ization.
It is the hope of the ASSU
j President that the new system
j will enable ideas that might or
! dinarily die to reach the student
| body. '
