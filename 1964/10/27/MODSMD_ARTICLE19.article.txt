# Ready And Meyer Star As Frosh Romp In Water Polo
## 
### 
Stanford's undefeated freshman
water polo team increased to six
its number of victories by crush
ing Cal Davis, San Jose State
frosh, and the Olympic Club JV's
last weekend.
The frosh have never scored
fewer than 15 points, compiling
an average of bettor than 18
points per game. As Coach Joe
Higgins has tried to let as many
team members play as possible,
the first string has never played
an entire game. The Papooses'
consistently high scores point to
a formidable degree of depth on
the Stanford bench.
Gary Sheerer led a 22-5 rout of
the Cal Aggies with six goals.
Doug Mac-Lean scored four limes,
and Pete Heady and Bill Meyer
threw for three each. Eighteen
Stanford players participated in

'the pa me.
AGAINST SAN JOSIO State, the
Papooses started slow and then
built up momentum. At the half,
Stanford hold a slim ihree point
load. Goalie Tony Edeli blocked
everything the junior Spartans
threw in the third quarter. Moan
while, his teammates were busy
building up a seven point lead.
The game ended with Stanford on
top lli-7.
Olympic Club's JV goalie had a
harrowing day last Saturday.
Twenty-one times he saw the yel
low ball fly past him, eight in the
: last quarter alone. The Olympic
* Club could muster only eight
goals in the entire game.
