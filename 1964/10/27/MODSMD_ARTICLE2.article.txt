• Miller Questions IJiJ Morality
NEW ORLEANS — President Johnson demonstrated "a dis
torted, incredible view of morality" by trying to "downgrade the sig
nificance of the Bobby Baker case and the Walter Jenkins arrest,"
Rep. William E. Miller charged yesterday.
"How in the world can we expect the younger people of America
to avoid being . . . skeptical of basic concepts of morality and integ
rity when they witness this kind of performance?" the Republican
vice presidential nominee asked in a statement.
• Johnson Baps Brinkmanship
COLUMBIA, S.C. President Johnson said last night Sen. Barry
Gold water "offers a policy of brinkmanship with nuclear power.
'I disagree and so do you," Johnson said in a speech prepared for
a Democratic rally at the South Carolina state capital.
In earlier speeches in Florida and Georgia yesterday, Johnson
flailed away at his Republican opponents, accusing them of "wild
and impulsive statements" and"the most radical proposals ever
made to the American people."
INTERNATIONAL
• Kremlin Appeals For Un'ty
MOSCOW The new Kremlin regin e appealed to East European
allies yesterday for unity with the Communist camp. The call ap
parently sought to quiet the alarm caused by the ouster of Nikita
Khrushchev.
The appeal came in an editorial on the front page of the gov
ernment paper Izvestia. It warned that the future economic prog
ress in Eastern Europe will demand stronger Communist unity.
There was no mention of Communist China and the appeal
seemed aimed only at Eastern Europe, where doubt had been raised
as to the wisdom of ousting Khrushchev.

auto industry giant.

Mich., and the Buick Division at Flint. But at least 28 bargaining
units remained idle because of unresolved disputes, including 15 of
