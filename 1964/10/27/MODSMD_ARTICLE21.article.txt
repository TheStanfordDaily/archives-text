! to bo seen here this year.
The Yugoslavs, now en route
; to Belgrade from Tokyo, played
1 the San Francisco Olympic Club
| last night. The Olympic Club
j downed the Indians 11-7 last week
| end.
Averaging 2.") years old, the
Yugoslavs practiced at Stanford
j yesterday morning. Their warm- j
up consisted of a l.~> minute soc
cer game with a water polo ball
| on the pool deck. A swimming
i workout followed.

j ran, himself an Olympian water
; poloist in 19HG, will play with the
; varsity against the impressive
i Yugoslav team.
Wednesday afternoon at 3:00
â€¢ Stanford's unbeaten freshman
team will scrimmage against the
Yugoslavs.
Last weekend tho Stanford var
sity won bui one of three games
! in a tough schedule. Tho Indians
! cruised by San Francisco State
i on Thursday, 1.1-4, but fell Friday
night to a foul-prone San Jose
State squad, 12-9.
Saturday, tho Cards dropped an
11-7 game to the Olympic Club in
a contest more closely matched
than tho score indicates. Coach
Gaughran was pleased with the
Tribe's performance against the
Olympic Club, believing it to be
their best effort this season. The
Indians will need their best effort,
if not more, when they cope with
1 ihe Yugoslavs tonight.
SAN FRANCISCO State played
I the losing role from tho outset.;
! Stanford increased a 4 0 first j
quarter lead to 8-2 at the half,
j Goalie Jim Ellis permitted only j
I two SFS shots to pass him in i
j the final half.
Bryan Beck and Bill Ready had j
a productive scoring game, each :
making good on live shots.
Friday night the Cards travelled
to San Jose. The Indians had to
cope with a shortened pool and
a shallow-end goal. San Jose has
been perennially hard to beat un
der those conditions. The Spar
tans, with their best team in
years, used their home pool ad
vantage and other tactics to turn
back the Indians, 12-9.
SAN JOSE accumulated 43
fouls. One of these fouls resulted
in a cut eye for Stanford's Bill:
Ready. Then Spartans fouled
out. of the game, leaving San Jose
with only six players at tho close
of the final quarter.
Practically every time an In
dian received the ball, ho wast
fouled by San Jose. If the referee

called the foul, then the Spartan
fall-back defense had time to set
up and thwart a Stanford scor
ing attempt.
SATi HDAY'S game with the
Olympic Club brought into En
cina pool two evenly matched
teams. Both teams scored three
times in the first period. Bill
Ready tallied twice and Bryan
Beck once for the Indians. Doug
Jensen's goal was Stanford's only
score in the second period, and
likewise Ihe Olympic Club came

up with only one.
Stanford moved from tho -1-1
halftimo tie to ;i 7 rs load on tho
strength of goals by Bock and
Ready and a penalty toss hy Mike
Eshoiman. The Olympic Club
closed tho quarter hard, tying the
score going into ihe final period.
The Indians were pinched in
the last quarter, losing all four
of ihe previous scorers to foul
outs. The Olympic Club swept
in with four goals to register the
viclory.
