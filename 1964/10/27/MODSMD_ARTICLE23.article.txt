## Mixed Reaction To Goldwater Editorial; Daily One-Sided? 
### 
Dear Sir:
For five weeks, the past stan
dards of sometime-excellence of
the Daily have seemed absent.
The unfortunate endorsement of
Sen. Goldwater makes that ab
sense of quality crystal clear. How
any major college newspaper
north or east of Orange County
could endorse the Republican can
didate and retain a clean consci
ence is a mystery to us. Gold
water's election would be disas
trous for America and the world.
His endorsement by the Daily is
already a disaster for the Univer
sity's only and sadly lacking—
news organ. Cancel our subscrip
tion.

• improves Campaign
Dear Sir:
We who support Barry Gold
water for president were pleas
antly surprised to open The Daily
on Monday and find that there
actually is a publication in the
nation today that is making an
attempt to bring the campaign
out of the cesspool into which it
has fallen and present the basic
issues which will confront Ameri
cans when they go to the polls
in a week. . . .
Thanks to The Daily, there is
now hope that we may see a cam
paign on issues rather than on
who has pulled the most shady
deals during his term in office.
We sincerely hope that The
Daily keeps up its definite at
tempt to raise the level of the
campaign to a position that will
allow responsible people to make
a choice that will lead to a re
sponsible. cautious government,
instead of one that will lead to
losses of freedom, at home and
abroad.

• Partisan Journal
Dear Sir:
The editorial page ot Monday's
Daily seems 1o confirm my sus
picion that revolutionary "intel
lectual" forces have seized con
trol of that revered campus insti
tution. . . .
They have thrown together on
a single page the imperceptive
seribblings of Mr. Bonine and
Mr. Buckley, plus an unconvinc
ing blurb advocating "Goldwater
for President." In addition, there
was a letter defending Arizona
conservative government to fill
the remainder of the page. One
might even suspect that the origi
nal copy of the political cartoon
showed the head of Pres. John
son. but that a token attempt at
"impartiality" dictated the de
capitation of yet another politi
cian.
What can liberals do about this
unfortunate situation? Demand
equal time? Question the molal
ity of the Daily's leadership? Or
perhaps merely demand that Tile
Daily change its name to fit the
readership it seeks something
like "Partisan Journal for Indoc
-1 rinated Conservatives."

• Hold War Strategy
Dear Sir:
With its usual perspicuity and
sagacity the Daily has conde
scended to bestow upon the Stan
ford community a brilliantly con
ceived blueprint for the attain

merit of eternal world peace and
universal brotherhood.
The Daily editorial staff, living
as they do in the ethereal heights
of political theory, no doubt con
sider it beneath them to apply
this blueprint to any specific and
finite area. Far be it from us, the
undersigned, to presume to im
prove this epochal masterplan for
the salvation of civilzation. How
ever, with all due humility, we
desire to further this worthy
cause by offering a few concrete
applications.
Keeping in mind "that peace
must be our overriding concern:"
1. "The United States must give
clear evidence at all times of its
overwhelming military superior
ity with regard to every conceiv
able type of conflict." We suggest
specific applications in the fol
lowing areas: the resumption of
nuclear testing in the atmosphere,
utilizing our largest yield weap
ons, preferably where visible to a
large foreign audience; the block
ading of the coasts of the Soviet
Union and the Chinese People's
Republic; the dispatching of
flights of B-70's to reconnoitre the
U.S.S.R., and the posting of U.S.
soldiers every two feet or so
along the beaches of Quemoy and
Matsu. Such actions would as
suredly serve the double function
of cowing ihe communist powers
into halting weapon production
and of demonstrating America's
peaceful intentions to the world.
2. "The United States must
adopt a forward strategy . . .
which achieves and retains the
initiative in the cold war." This
could readily be accomplished by
sending'troops into North Korea,
North Viet-Nam, Laos, Tibet, and
East Germany and aiding India
and Taiwan in attacks on Red
China. This is obviously prefer
able to any "containment policy
. . . (which) accepts a continual
disturbance of the peace."
3. The U.S. "must work at all
times . . . to establish in the com
munist countries governments
which will confine their foreign
policies to their legitimate na
tional interests." Thus, after mili
tarily liberating all countries pre
viously liberated by the commu
nists, America could establish, or
"support," democratic govern
ments, as we have done in the
past Syngman Rhee in South
Korea, Diem in Viet-Nam, a n d
various benevolent despots of
Latin America. Naturally, these
governments, in serving "their
legitimate national interests"
would not conflict with U.S. pol
icy.
But perhaps there is an easier
solution. "It must be, in short,
to end the Cold War by eliminat
ing the primary cause of its exis
tence." The primary cause is the
ideological conflict between the
East and tin.' West. Possibly, ther
monuclear weapons administered
by an impartial body such as the
United Nations could be employed
to excise the malignant cancer.
The charred remnant of our
planet would then indeed be a
peaceful place, undisturbed by
even the most innocent organic
activities.
Respect fully,

• Fraternities Defended
Dear Sir:
Mr. Art Fisher's column in the
October 22 Daily. "Farm Frats
Are on the Way Out," seems to

have been intended as a personal
attack on fraternities in general
instead of a statement of Univer
sity policy as his title implies. Re
gardless of Mr. Fisher's social
affiliations, which presumably are
non-fraternal, judging from the
vituperative nature of his com
ments, his denouncements are not
supported by facts. Instead he
harps on the age old themes, that
fraternity men are really chil
dren playing silly mystic games,
without bothering about the aca
demic side of University life.
As an ex-fraternity man, a n d
former Zola Psi "animal," I am
well aware of the faults of the
system. However I reject the as
sertions 1) that the fraternity
men were the "obnoxious" mem
bers of Wilbur Hall, 2) that their
entire lives are spent throwing
knives into furniture. Were Mr.
Fisher to check the record, he
would find that the majority of
positions of leadership on cam
pus were held by members of this
group. In typecasting the fratern
ity member as an irresponsible,
the author is not only in error,
but far behind the times. It would
seem that the other less well de- j
fined campus groups escape his
judgment due to their anonymity,
less than their contributions. Also
Mr. Fisher may well remember
that his tuition is lower due to
the historical generosity of fra
ternity alumni, who as a group
have given far more than the in
dependents. Perhaps it may be
said that "an animal never for
gets."

EDITOR'S NOTE: Mr. Fisher
substantially concurs in your ar
guments and feels that you
wholly missed the message of his
essay.
• Mixed NATO Foree
Dear Sir:
To use one's brain for what it
was originally intended is a rare
occurrence these days, but I am
glad to see that England's new
Prime Minister, Harold Wilson,
is using his. In the News In Brief
section of the 19 October Daily,
Wilson pledged to stay out of the
U.S. project for a mixed-manned,
nuclear-armed fleet for NATO.
I have participated in a couple;
of SEATO exercises with tli c i
Royal Navy and I know some j
of the problems that a mixed-1
manned ship would face. Prob-1
ably the most: noticeable and!
ironic problem is that the English
and the Americans do not speak
the same language. With the
necessity of good radio commu
nication this could be hazardous
for the mission. For example,
when the Americans say, "I read
you loud and clear," the British ]
say, "I read you five square."
Putting British and American
crews on the same ship would
embarrass the Americans be
cause the British sailor tends to
be more efficient than the Ameri
can. These two problems are some
of the many that would be faced j
by mixed-manned ships had not '
Mr. Wilson quit this rather fool-j
ish plan.
