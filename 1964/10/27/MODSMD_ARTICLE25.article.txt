# STAFF OPINION
## Our Choice: Johnson In '64 
### 
"The Stanford Daily, while owned by and operated under the
auspices of the Associated Students of Stanford University, is edi
torially independent from both the Associated Students and the Uni
versity. Editorial opinions are those of the editor and do not neces
sarily express the views of either tin* Associated Students or the
University." — Stanford Daily masthead.
The "we" in yesterday's editorial supporting Barry Goldwater
for the Presidency of the United States was, in reality, a singular "I."
Of the 10 members of The Daily's Edit Board (from Editor-in-
Chief through Sports Editor on the masthead above), seven favor
Lyndon Johnson, two hold a "plague on both your houses" attitude
and one, the Editor-in-Chief, wants Barry, as was made clear yester
day.
The Daily is a benevolent dictatorship, not a democracy, and will
always be that way. From the 1960 volume when The Daily sup
ported John F. Kennedy while two-thirds of the campus disagreed —
through last Spring's editorial denouncing Goldwater's candidacy in
the California primary and yesterday's editorial defending the jun
ior Senator, the editors of The Daily have exercised their peroga
tive of making a choice, unpopular as it may bo. We support the
right of the editor to exercise this perogative.
We Disagree
But we wish to make clear our complete disagreement with yes
terday's editorial.
Lyndon Johnson deserves to be re-elected President of the United
States; Barry Goldwater deserves the most severe electoral repudi-j
at ion ever bestowed by the American people upon a Presidential
candidate.
The Goldwater philosophy on both domestic and foreign policy
issues reflect the worst in the American political tradition—reaction
ism and chauvinism.
Domestically, Goldwaterism is little more than an angry cry.,
It is more, far more, than the traditional- and responsible—conser-1
vative argument that the federal system, with its separation of
powers and accent on local effort and responsibility, ought to be j
given a chance to solve the problems that confront us before dele-j
gating that power to the central government.
Barry Goldwater and his supporters would rather repeal the New
Deal and most of its committments. His stands against Social Secur- j
ity, TVA and unemployment insurance have put him virtually alone
among the American people.
And Goldwater has realized this. Since his disastrous defeat in
New Hampshire last spring, he has refrained from mentioning So
cial Security and the plight of the poor in the hope that silence will
erase the past.
Goldwater and Civil Rights
He has ignored other pressing problems such as welfare for the j
aged, improved education and urban blight because he can offer j
us no alternatives. These problems have been left to the cities and
states, and for the most part they have been either unable or un
willing to solve them. Meanwhile, Senator Goldwater, in Hubert
Humphrey's words "Sits under the no-no tree in the shade of his
own indifference."
But even Barry Goldwater was not able to hide behind his indif
ference when the Civil Rights bill came before the Senate this sum-;
mer.
Integration is a moral issue, a matter to be rectified in the heart, j
not through compulsory legislation, he told us then as he voted ■
against the overwhelming majority of his Republican colleagues.
And some applauded him for displaying this "profile in courage."
What courage? Goldwater did not lose any votes; no Negro was
going to vote for him anyway. But where would the Southern sup
port have gone if he had said "Aye?"
Perhaps one could forgive the Senator for his overly zealous |
regard for moral relativism and strict constitutionality if it were
a hallmark of his entire philosophy. Unfortunately, it. is not.
The 'Choice' In Foreign Policy
The Goldwater foreign policy has no place J'ur moral relativism. |
The man who would leave the Negro to the tender mercies of Ross ,
Burnett stnd Strom Thurmond would have us liberate Eastern Eur
ope, Asia and any other part of the world now bereft of our influence, i
The policy of containment and limited accommodation that all
four of our post-War Presidents have followed would be replaced j
with an implacable hostility to all Communist governments.
As the New York Times editorialized in the October 10 issue. "A
Goldwater election -even if it did not lead to a disastrous East-West I
clash—undoubtedly would spur arms production in Russia and halt
disintegration of the Communist bloc in Europe. It might even arrest
the Sino-Sovict feud and pave tlie way for a reconciliation that, under
present circumstances, seems highly unlikely. And it would, at the 1
same time, disrupt what unity and strength remain in the Atlantic |
Alliance."
In the final analysis, the true meaning of Goldwaterism can be
seen in two votes -The Civil Rights Act and the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty. His "no" votes on those crucial issues disqualify him fori
consideration for the Presidency of the United States.
Johnson Well Qualified
Lyndon Johnson, on the other hand, is well qualified for the job
ho now holds. In his 28 years on the Hill he lias served four Presi
dents in both houses and as Vice-President. He knows the govern
mental system of this country better than any other living Ameri
can. And his running mate, unlike Sen. Goldwater's, is a man cap
able of ably filling the officc of the Presidency, not a pathetic politi
cal hack.
We do not agree with all he has done and in 11 months he has
done more than many Presidents could or would do in an entire j
term —and we are a bit confused as to what The Great Society would '
be like. But the alternative, tho "choice," this year is all too clear.
It is for this reason that we. as a majority of the Edit Board ol
the Stanford Daily, urge support of the Johnson-Humphrey ticket
this November.

As the New York Times editorialized in the October 10 issue. "A
Goldwater election -even if it did not lead to a disastrous East-West I

disintegration of the Communist bloc in Europe. It might even arrest
the Sino-Sovict feud and pave tlie way for a reconciliation that, under
present circumstances, seems highly unlikely. And it would, at the 1

Alliance."
In the final analysis, the true meaning of Goldwaterism can be
seen in two votes -The Civil Rights Act and the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty. His "no" votes on those crucial issues disqualify him fori
consideration for the Presidency of the United States.
Johnson Well Qualified
Lyndon Johnson, on the other hand, is well qualified for the job
ho now holds. In his 28 years on the Hill he lias served four Presi
dents in both houses and as Vice-President. He knows the govern
mental system of this country better than any other living Ameri
can. And his running mate, unlike Sen. Goldwater's, is a man cap
able of ably filling the officc of the Presidency, not a pathetic politi
cal hack.
We do not agree with all he has done and in 11 months he has
done more than many Presidents could or would do in an entire j
term —and we are a bit confused as to what The Great Society would '
be like. But the alternative, tho "choice," this year is all too clear.
It is for this reason that we. as a majority of the Edit Board ol

The Daily is a benevolent dictatorship, not a democracy, and will
always be that way. From the 1960 volume when The Daily sup
ported John F. Kennedy while two-thirds of the campus disagreed —
through last Spring's editorial denouncing Goldwater's candidacy in
the California primary and yesterday's editorial defending the jun
ior Senator, the editors of The Daily have exercised their peroga
tive of making a choice, unpopular as it may bo. We support the
right of the editor to exercise this perogative.
We Disagree
But we wish to make clear our complete disagreement with yes
terday's editorial.
Lyndon Johnson deserves to be re-elected President of the United
States; Barry Goldwater deserves the most severe electoral repudi-j
at ion ever bestowed by the American people upon a Presidential
candidate.
The Goldwater philosophy on both domestic and foreign policy
issues reflect the worst in the American political tradition—reaction
ism and chauvinism.
Domestically, Goldwaterism is little more than an angry cry.,
It is more, far more, than the traditional- and responsible—conser-1
vative argument that the federal system, with its separation of
powers and accent on local effort and responsibility, ought to be j
given a chance to solve the problems that confront us before dele-j
gating that power to the central government.
Barry Goldwater and his supporters would rather repeal the New
Deal and most of its committments. His stands against Social Secur- j
ity, TVA and unemployment insurance have put him virtually alone
among the American people.
And Goldwater has realized this. Since his disastrous defeat in
New Hampshire last spring, he has refrained from mentioning So
cial Security and the plight of the poor in the hope that silence will
erase the past.
Goldwater and Civil Rights
He has ignored other pressing problems such as welfare for the j
aged, improved education and urban blight because he can offer j
us no alternatives. These problems have been left to the cities and
states, and for the most part they have been either unable or un
willing to solve them. Meanwhile, Senator Goldwater, in Hubert
Humphrey's words "Sits under the no-no tree in the shade of his
own indifference."
But even Barry Goldwater was not able to hide behind his indif
ference when the Civil Rights bill came before the Senate this sum-;

versity. Editorial opinions are those of the editor and do not neces
sarily express the views of either tin* Associated Students or the
University." — Stanford Daily masthead.
The "we" in yesterday's editorial supporting Barry Goldwater
for the Presidency of the United States was, in reality, a singular "I."
Of the 10 members of The Daily's Edit Board (from Editor-in-
Chief through Sports Editor on the masthead above), seven favor
Lyndon Johnson, two hold a "plague on both your houses" attitude
and one, the Editor-in-Chief, wants Barry, as was made clear yester
day.
The Daily is a benevolent dictatorship, not a democracy, and will
always be that way. From the 1960 volume when The Daily sup
ported John F. Kennedy while two-thirds of the campus disagreed —
through last Spring's editorial denouncing Goldwater's candidacy in
the California primary and yesterday's editorial defending the jun
ior Senator, the editors of The Daily have exercised their peroga
tive of making a choice, unpopular as it may bo. We support the
right of the editor to exercise this perogative.
We Disagree
But we wish to make clear our complete disagreement with yes
terday's editorial.
Lyndon Johnson deserves to be re-elected President of the United
States; Barry Goldwater deserves the most severe electoral repudi-j
at ion ever bestowed by the American people upon a Presidential
candidate.
The Goldwater philosophy on both domestic and foreign policy
issues reflect the worst in the American political tradition—reaction
ism and chauvinism.
Domestically, Goldwaterism is little more than an angry cry.,
It is more, far more, than the traditional- and responsible—conser-1
vative argument that the federal system, with its separation of
powers and accent on local effort and responsibility, ought to be j
given a chance to solve the problems that confront us before dele-j
gating that power to the central government.
Barry Goldwater and his supporters would rather repeal the New
Deal and most of its committments. His stands against Social Secur- j
ity, TVA and unemployment insurance have put him virtually alone
among the American people.
And Goldwater has realized this. Since his disastrous defeat in
New Hampshire last spring, he has refrained from mentioning So
cial Security and the plight of the poor in the hope that silence will
erase the past.
Goldwater and Civil Rights
He has ignored other pressing problems such as welfare for the j
aged, improved education and urban blight because he can offer j
us no alternatives. These problems have been left to the cities and
states, and for the most part they have been either unable or un
willing to solve them. Meanwhile, Senator Goldwater, in Hubert
Humphrey's words "Sits under the no-no tree in the shade of his
own indifference."
But even Barry Goldwater was not able to hide behind his indif
ference when the Civil Rights bill came before the Senate this sum-;
mer.
Integration is a moral issue, a matter to be rectified in the heart, j
not through compulsory legislation, he told us then as he voted ■
against the overwhelming majority of his Republican colleagues.
And some applauded him for displaying this "profile in courage."
What courage? Goldwater did not lose any votes; no Negro was
going to vote for him anyway. But where would the Southern sup
port have gone if he had said "Aye?"
Perhaps one could forgive the Senator for his overly zealous |
regard for moral relativism and strict constitutionality if it were
a hallmark of his entire philosophy. Unfortunately, it. is not.
The 'Choice' In Foreign Policy
The Goldwater foreign policy has no place J'ur moral relativism. |
The man who would leave the Negro to the tender mercies of Ross ,
Burnett stnd Strom Thurmond would have us liberate Eastern Eur
ope, Asia and any other part of the world now bereft of our influence, i
The policy of containment and limited accommodation that all
four of our post-War Presidents have followed would be replaced j
with an implacable hostility to all Communist governments.
As the New York Times editorialized in the October 10 issue. "A
Goldwater election -even if it did not lead to a disastrous East-West I
clash—undoubtedly would spur arms production in Russia and halt
disintegration of the Communist bloc in Europe. It might even arrest
the Sino-Sovict feud and pave tlie way for a reconciliation that, under
present circumstances, seems highly unlikely. And it would, at the 1
same time, disrupt what unity and strength remain in the Atlantic |
Alliance."
In the final analysis, the true meaning of Goldwaterism can be
seen in two votes -The Civil Rights Act and the Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty. His "no" votes on those crucial issues disqualify him fori
consideration for the Presidency of the United States.
Johnson Well Qualified
Lyndon Johnson, on the other hand, is well qualified for the job
ho now holds. In his 28 years on the Hill he lias served four Presi
dents in both houses and as Vice-President. He knows the govern
mental system of this country better than any other living Ameri
can. And his running mate, unlike Sen. Goldwater's, is a man cap
able of ably filling the officc of the Presidency, not a pathetic politi
cal hack.
We do not agree with all he has done and in 11 months he has
done more than many Presidents could or would do in an entire j
term —and we are a bit confused as to what The Great Society would '
be like. But the alternative, tho "choice," this year is all too clear.
It is for this reason that we. as a majority of the Edit Board ol
the Stanford Daily, urge support of the Johnson-Humphrey ticket
this November.
