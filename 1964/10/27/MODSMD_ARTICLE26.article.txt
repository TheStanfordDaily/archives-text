# Today and Tomorrow
## Goldwater Inconsistent, Not A True Conservative 
### Walter Lippmann 
There is a persistent eontraclietion in Sen. Bam Goldwater s
talks between what lie complains about and what lie wishes to do
about it, between the problems he poses and the solutions he pro
poses.
This is evident in the field of foreign affairs, defense, fiscal

policy, Social Security and in-*
deed in almost every great con
cern of a President and of the
federal government.
Crime and Violence
Except for trying to revise his
own record, he has in fact turned
away from the discussion of the
great issues of national policy
and is putting his main emphasis
on crime, violence and immoral
ity.
The central theme of the Gold-1
water campaign has now become !
in effect that crime and sin are
evils which can be dealt with suc
cessfully by the personal example
and virtue of Barry Goldwater
and William Miller. We two are,
he is trying to tell the voters,
morally superior men who, be
cause of what we are and what
we say, will drive crime and vio-1
lence from the city streets and j
inaugurate a new era of virtue
in this corrupted land.
Not A lieal Conservative
Stripped down, this is no doubt !
a remarkable example of self-ad-!
miration. But this being an c-lec-1
lion campaign, the self-righteous-1
ness does not matter too much.
What does matter is that while
these two men take their indomi
table stand against crime and:
vice, they are at the same time
silent or scornful about almost i
every practical measure dealing
with crime and vice. They have
nothing they want to do about the
schools, housing, the police, rec
reation, health. They want to save
us from our troubles by their per
sonal example, by their capacity
to exude virtue and by denounc
ing sin. They are like the preacher
who, said President Calvin Cool-
J idge when he returned from

church one Sunday morning, had
preached on .sin and was against
it.
Not only do Messrs. Goldwater
and Miller propose no remedies
except their personal example,
but when they expound their
philosophy, they cut themselves
off from any kind of concerted
effort to introduce discipline, au
thority and order into modern
life.
No Practical Measures
What is their remedy for all our
moral evils? To liberate the in
dividual from Ihe tyranny of gov
ernment and the constraints of so
ciety, to deny and reject Ihe be
lief which is the central convic
tion of genuine conservatism
that the individual is part of a
community of the dead, the living
and of the unborn, to which he is
bound, as Edmund Burke said, by
"ties which though light as air.
are as strong as links of iron."
It is because of the existence of
this invisible community that 1
once ventured to write that
"young men die in battle for
their country's sake and . . . old
men plant trees they will never
sit under."
There is no more unfounded
claim than that Barry Goldwater
is a conservative. He denies the
fundamental principle of conser
vatism which is that we belong
to a community which is greater,
older and more enduring than
ourselves. Senator Goldwater is
in fact a radical opponent of con
servatism who under the banner
of personal freedom would com
pound that moral disorder, which
is the paramount problem of the
modern age.

ness does not matter too much.
What does matter is that while
these two men take their indomi
table stand against crime and:
vice, they are at the same time
silent or scornful about almost i
every practical measure dealing
with crime and vice. They have
nothing they want to do about the
schools, housing, the police, rec
reation, health. They want to save
us from our troubles by their per
sonal example, by their capacity
to exude virtue and by denounc
ing sin. They are like the preacher
who, said President Calvin Cool-
J idge when he returned from

church one Sunday morning, had
preached on .sin and was against
it.
Not only do Messrs. Goldwater
and Miller propose no remedies
except their personal example,
but when they expound their
philosophy, they cut themselves
off from any kind of concerted
effort to introduce discipline, au
thority and order into modern
life.
No Practical Measures
What is their remedy for all our
moral evils? To liberate the in
dividual from Ihe tyranny of gov
ernment and the constraints of so
ciety, to deny and reject Ihe be
lief which is the central convic
tion of genuine conservatism
that the individual is part of a
community of the dead, the living
and of the unborn, to which he is
bound, as Edmund Burke said, by
"ties which though light as air.
are as strong as links of iron."
It is because of the existence of
this invisible community that 1
once ventured to write that
"young men die in battle for
their country's sake and . . . old
men plant trees they will never
sit under."
There is no more unfounded
claim than that Barry Goldwater
is a conservative. He denies the
fundamental principle of conser
vatism which is that we belong
to a community which is greater,
older and more enduring than
ourselves. Senator Goldwater is
in fact a radical opponent of con
servatism who under the banner
of personal freedom would com
pound that moral disorder, which
is the paramount problem of the
modern age.
There is a persistent eontraclietion in Sen. Bam Goldwater s
talks between what lie complains about and what lie wishes to do
about it, between the problems he poses and the solutions he pro
poses.
This is evident in the field of foreign affairs, defense, fiscal

policy, Social Security and in-*
deed in almost every great con
cern of a President and of the
federal government.
Crime and Violence
Except for trying to revise his
own record, he has in fact turned
away from the discussion of the
great issues of national policy
and is putting his main emphasis
on crime, violence and immoral
ity.
The central theme of the Gold-1
water campaign has now become !
in effect that crime and sin are
evils which can be dealt with suc
cessfully by the personal example
and virtue of Barry Goldwater
and William Miller. We two are,
he is trying to tell the voters,
morally superior men who, be
cause of what we are and what
we say, will drive crime and vio-1
lence from the city streets and j
inaugurate a new era of virtue
in this corrupted land.
Not A lieal Conservative
Stripped down, this is no doubt !
a remarkable example of self-ad-!
miration. But this being an c-lec-1
lion campaign, the self-righteous-1
ness does not matter too much.
