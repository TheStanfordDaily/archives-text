# LAB RENOVATED
## Language Study Improved 
### ALEC VAN SINDEREN 
This year's new language laboratory, the re
sult primarily of planning by Colonel Morgan of
the Modern European Languages Department, is
to serve both as a two-year filler until the new
library is built and as a basis for experimenta
tion in the methods of teaching languages in the
lab.
This last purpose explains the two different set
ups in the present, language lab. The lab is now
divided into two parts; on one side French and
Italian are taught, on the other German, Spanish,
Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Slavonics,
and English as a foreign language.
THE FRENCH ;ind Italian side allows the stu
dent free control of the tape, permitting him to go
back over parts of the tape and to hear his rec
orded voice in direct comparison to the correct
pronunciation.
Students do not have to follow a prescribed
time schedule. The more commonly used tapes arc
set up in some booths for convenience but can be
replaced easily.
The side for the other languages, however, has
a scheduled set-up for Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday* for many of the lower-number language
courses, except for Chinese and Japanese. fHtrin;:
these scheduled times the students have no eon
trol over the tapes other than volume and must
follow a definite time lay-out.

ON TUESDAY and Thursday, and at some
booths on the other days, there are free time
periods when students taking higher-number
courses and Chinese and Japanese may have free
use of their course tapes.
Students who arc scheduled arc not allowed to
use these free time periods, unless making up for
a missed time, and then still not with free control.
These two procedures have advantages and dis
advantages. The French and Italian method be
cause it is time-consuming creates rush hours
during the middle afternoon, and lul> times during
the noon hour.
THE OTHEK METHOI> creates a uniform flow
of students and thus fewer overflows.
The average French and Italian student uses
the tapes between once and twice a week <75()-<Sf)O
users a week; about 600 students enrolled), while
the average German 1 students (scheduled), for
instance, uses the tapes almost three time a week
(about 510 users a week; 180-plus students en*
This year there is a greater variety of tapes,
and in many cases professional tapes are avail
able. Often more than one voice is recorded on
each tape. This all provides the student with the
advantage of hearing different accents and styles
of speech within the same language.
The new labs also have entire plays and elassi
cal theatre available in innst of the languages
represented in the lab.
