Our engineers wear
false noses And you are
right! Miikinp these is child's play.
But not so the task of inventing and
producing the Mattel toy that molds
noses — and dozens of other things —
from plastic sheet. It's done with our
new Vac-U-Form™, a working minia
ture of the plastic industry's multi
thousand-dollar vacuum forming
machine. Yet we make it to retail at
under $16.
Maybe you'd enjoy solving the sort
of problems involved in designing and
mass producing it to high quality
standards. Like, how would you achieve
and hold a vacuum of 2?> inches of
mercury with components costing less
than 25('! Or design a child-safe, in
frared heater, producible in quantities
of half a million— at a specified com
petitive cost?
Interesting engineering problems
like these are the daily, year-round
business of the professional engineers
who've helped us become the biggest
and fastest-growing designer and
manufacturer of toys anywhere. Which
means we continue to expand our
already sizeable technical staff. Which
is where you come in. Maybe.
If you have the educational back
ground we need — and the imagination
to turn complicated ideas into simple,
reliable and saleable products — you'll
like working here. And settling your
family in one of the beach or mountain
communities practically next door to
our multi-plant facilities near the Loa
Angeles International Airport.
Interested? Tell our professional
employment interviewer. He'll be on
campus soon. And he'll want to see you.
