# Coeds Football Experts, Win Contest This Week
## 
### 
Two coeds tied for first place
in the October 24 Stanford Daily-
Pacific Southwest Airlines foot
} ball contest.
BOTH EILEEN Roach and Dian
I Odell correctly picked the win
ners of all seven games and
missed the actual score of the
Stanford-Notre Dame game by
four points.
Miss Roach picked a 27-3 Notre
Dame victory while Miss Odell
predicted a 28-10 score. The actual
score was 28-6.
SINCE ONLY one round-trip
! ticket to Los Angeles can be

awarded in each week's contest,
the predictions of the two girls in
this week's contest will be used
to determine the winner.
Runner-up to the two coeds
was Ken Castleton who predicted
a 27-10 Notre Dame win.
OTHER TOP prognasticators
and their predicted scores of the
Stanford-Notre Dame game were:
Ken Castleton, Stuart Zarembo,
Richard Hulett, Craig Franklin,
Clifford Comisky, Allen McCur
dy, and Arthur Lange.
