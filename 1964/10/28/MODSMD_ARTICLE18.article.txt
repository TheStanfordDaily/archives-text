## 'Fantasticks' Superbly Acted At S.F. Theater 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
In the plethora of huge, gaudy
and ostentatious musicals ihat
have become all too standard in
recent years, it is rare 1o find
one that is not only small, sim
ple and quiet but is charming and
delightful as well.
"The Fantasticks," now at San
Francisco's Little Fox, is such a
musical. It is, in fact, a little
jewel of a show—a jewel in which
each carefully polished facet is
flawless.
MAJOR CREDIT must, of
course, go to author - lyricist
Tom Jones and composer Harvey
Schmidt. Jones' beguiling — but
immensely complicated — plot
(about a 20-year-old boy who
loves the 16-year-old girl next
door) is filled with wit and irony.
The songs, which range from
the haunting "Try To Remember"
and "Soon It's Gonna Rain" to
the jazzy "This Plum Is Too
Ripe" and the vaudevillian "Plant
A Radish." are marvelous. Using
only a piano and a harp (plus a
few special percussive instru
ments in a few numbers) Schmidt
does more than most Broadway
composers can do with an entire
orchestra.
Each member of the cast (there
are only eight > is superb. Each
is given several moments in
which to individually shine, but
each contributes to an overall
sense of smooth ensemble play
ing that is vital for "The Fan
tasticks" to succeed.
.JACK DAVISON, as the Nar

rat or, does a magnificent job of
lying together the loose ends of
the plot. And his death scene
must be seen to be believed.
Although Tina Hermansen is
not as perfect a singer as one
might desire, she turns this liab
ility to her advantage in project
ing the image of an innocent and
terribly romantic young girl. Her
acting and dancing are beyond
reproach.
As the Boy, Jerry Wyatt com
bines a sure vocal technique with
a truly winning personality. His
duet with the Narrator—"l Can
See It"—is to this reviewer the
vocal highlight of the show.
DOUGLAS REYNOLDS and
Gerard Lyly — respectively the
girl's and boy's father—provide
much of the comedy. Their song
with the Narrator discussing the
various types of abduction—"lt
Depends On What You Pay"—is
one of the funniest numbers ever
staged.
Richard de Faut, as a rather
confused Old Actor; Louis Fran
cisco, as an American Indian with
a Cockney accent who specializes
in dying; and Fernando Toro, in
the vital role of the mute, are
also excellent.
Geoffrey Brown's ingenious
staging makes full use of the
Little Fox's minute stage and
keeps the show moving at a lively
pace.
The stark setting and atmos
pheric lighting, so important in
sustaining the mood of "The Fan
tasticks," are the work of un
named designers, and are quite
good.


THE GIRL-Tina Hermansen plays the role of The Girl in "The Fan
tasticks," the musical now at San Francisco's Little Fox. Miss Her
mansen, the only female in the cast of eight, is a native of Redwood
City and has performed widely in musicals throughout the Bay
Area.

named designers, and are quite
good.


THE GIRL-Tina Hermansen plays the role of The Girl in "The Fan
tasticks," the musical now at San Francisco's Little Fox. Miss Her
mansen, the only female in the cast of eight, is a native of Redwood
City and has performed widely in musicals throughout the Bay
Area.
In the plethora of huge, gaudy
and ostentatious musicals ihat
have become all too standard in
recent years, it is rare 1o find
one that is not only small, sim
ple and quiet but is charming and
delightful as well.
"The Fantasticks," now at San
Francisco's Little Fox, is such a
musical. It is, in fact, a little
jewel of a show—a jewel in which
each carefully polished facet is
flawless.
MAJOR CREDIT must, of
course, go to author - lyricist
Tom Jones and composer Harvey
Schmidt. Jones' beguiling — but
immensely complicated — plot
(about a 20-year-old boy who
loves the 16-year-old girl next
door) is filled with wit and irony.
The songs, which range from
the haunting "Try To Remember"
and "Soon It's Gonna Rain" to
the jazzy "This Plum Is Too
Ripe" and the vaudevillian "Plant
A Radish." are marvelous. Using
only a piano and a harp (plus a
few special percussive instru
ments in a few numbers) Schmidt
does more than most Broadway
composers can do with an entire
orchestra.
Each member of the cast (there
are only eight > is superb. Each
is given several moments in
which to individually shine, but
each contributes to an overall
sense of smooth ensemble play
ing that is vital for "The Fan
tasticks" to succeed.
.JACK DAVISON, as the Nar

rat or, does a magnificent job of
lying together the loose ends of
the plot. And his death scene
must be seen to be believed.
Although Tina Hermansen is
not as perfect a singer as one
might desire, she turns this liab
ility to her advantage in project
ing the image of an innocent and
terribly romantic young girl. Her
acting and dancing are beyond
reproach.
As the Boy, Jerry Wyatt com
bines a sure vocal technique with
a truly winning personality. His
duet with the Narrator—"l Can
See It"—is to this reviewer the
vocal highlight of the show.
DOUGLAS REYNOLDS and
Gerard Lyly — respectively the
girl's and boy's father—provide
much of the comedy. Their song
with the Narrator discussing the
various types of abduction—"lt
Depends On What You Pay"—is
one of the funniest numbers ever
staged.
Richard de Faut, as a rather
confused Old Actor; Louis Fran
cisco, as an American Indian with
a Cockney accent who specializes
in dying; and Fernando Toro, in
the vital role of the mute, are
also excellent.
Geoffrey Brown's ingenious
staging makes full use of the
Little Fox's minute stage and
keeps the show moving at a lively
pace.
The stark setting and atmos
pheric lighting, so important in
sustaining the mood of "The Fan
tasticks," are the work of un
named designers, and are quite
good.
