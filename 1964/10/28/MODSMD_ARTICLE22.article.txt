said.

regard" from "intent 1o deceive."

of her dormitory by 2:29 on her

but when she gets to the sign-out
desk, it" is 2:31. Her watch says

when she signed in, the Council
would have charged her with in
lent to deceive," Miss Moran said.
Kate, a junior, came in at 2:40
and wrote 2:29 as her sign-in
lime. The council considered her
violation as cause for suspension,
but decided since her testimony
had been completely honest and
her record was good she should
be given another chance to live
within the system.

freshman, who came in one min
ute past 12. She signed in at 12
to avoid using a late leave. She
had been warned by the council
about signing in correctly two
weeks before.
"BECAUSE FRAN had been
warned and knew the seriousness
ol her offense, the council placed
her on suspended suspension for

one quarter and, in addition, pro
bation for t lie following quarter,"
Miss Moran said.

cided on suspension for a ease of
"intent to deceive." Caroline, a

ment," Miss Moran explained.
The majority of the council felt

the false testimony were cause for
suspension.
Caroline appealed the decision

to require counseling for Caroline
but to allow her to remain at the
University under strict penalty.
