# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## Qb Problem: Quantity, Ability, Few Results 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Stanford is off schedule. Up to the Notre Dame game, tho Indians
wore playing lose, then win. The offense which sputtered against
the Huskies turned over and played dead against Notre Dame. The
: quarterback problem having plagued Coach John Ralston for the
\ better part of last year has arisen again. And the conditions are
j similar.
Tho quarterback is the mainspring of a football team. On his
j abilities as a play caller, loader, runner, and passer depend tho
! offensive success of a football team. Quarterbacks are a Stanford
tradition, as the likes of Frankio Albert, Bobby Garrett, John Brodio,
: and Dick Norman have all put in service for Indian elevens in past
years. During each <>112 Ralston's two years at the Farm, ho has tried
to uncover among a multitude of candidates a consistent signal
caller with tho ability it) move the team to paydirt when the chips
are down.
A STUTTERING OFFENSE
When a car doesn't respond to the flick of tho starter, tho logical
place to begin 1 rouble-shooting is Iho battery. In similar manner,
when a team bogs down, look first at the guy w ho starts every play,
the quarterback.
Last year, Ralston's quest for a consistent loader centered on four
quarterbacks, three of whom at one time during tho season wore in
the starting role. Three of the four returned this year and two new
comers boosted the list of field generals to five.
A good showing in spring training put Terry DeSylvia in line for
the starting role, but Dick Berg and Dave Lewis were not far behind.
Don Cook, generally appraised as the best passer of the lot. was
also in contention. Mike Connolly, who momentarily was tho starting
; QB after Clark Weaver's knee in jury, missed spring ball as ho' hurled
I for tho baseball team.
Going on the old kitchen adage that two many chefs ruin the
j stew, Ralston as last year delegated some of his candidates other
responsibilities and left the others in iho background when he for
i all practical purposes gave tho quarterback job to one person. When
! Mike Connelly split his finger in pro-season drills, ho was shifted
! to left end and Dave Lewis, who already had many Indian followers
I thinking he woidd emerge as one of Stanford's best perhaps tkis
j season, became a flanker when Dick Ragsdale was needed on defense.
THREE QUARTERBACKS
So, Stanford has three quarterbacks. Dimunilive DeSylvia calls
.a good game and for the most part executes one well. His big prob
' lom is hesitancy. On roll-out passes, he has passed up some running
! daylight sh should not have, and he is low in picking out receivers.
Easy to wrestle to tho ground if a hefty lineman gets within grab
! bing distance, ho can't afford to dance in Iho backficld.
! Dick Berg has been the number two man. Although used spar
ingly, he was outstanding in a brief appearance against UCLA and
! impressed sportswriters in the Rico game to iho extent that he
missed grabbing the back of tho game honors by just five votes.
Stanford followers, who eheish memories of pasl glory, recall
Berg's heroics of last year against Notre Dame and Cal. They won
der why Berg has not played more this year, as do a lot of people.
They forgot that coaches do not thrive on sentimentality, but their
thoughts are focused on game films of tho previous week and prac
-1 tice sessions. Perhaps, this is too bad.
Stanford has a group of good but not exceptional quarterbacks,
; relatively equal in ability. Their abilities arc somewhat com
i plementary. When in the game, each poses a slightly different prob
' lem to the defense. During their careers, each will play badly, per
j haps very badly, but they will also each play well, perhaps very well,
i The point is Stanford does not have a quarterback that deserves to
j play an entire game, even an entire half. When one falters, another
should be tried. Stanford's best game, the Rice upset, saw an effec
tive rotation of DeSylvia and Berg. Albeit, the same strategy pro
duced somewhat less than spectacular results the following week
j against tho Huskies, but this is no reason to give it up. Only last
i year, a professional football (cam, with two quarterbacks of equal
I talent shuttled them ovory ; .play. Stanford's answer, it seems to mo
llies in finding a good combination for each game individually.
