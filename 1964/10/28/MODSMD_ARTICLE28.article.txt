# Lewis Might Quarterback In Offensive Shake-up
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's football offense may |
romp up with some much-needed
new wrinkles against Oregon Sat
urday, if scrimmages this week
are any indication.
For two days, sophomore Dave
Lewis has been working at quar
terback in the practice sessions,
and has looked fairly good, espe
cially on the quarterback roll out
plays that Stanford uses so much.
Lewis was considered a prime
candidate for ihe starting QB
slot before the season began, but
saw no action until ihe UCLA
game. Since then he has been
used as a flanker and a punier.
Lewis has the most powerful
arm on the team. Most of his
short passes are bullets, and his
long ones can easily go ;~>o yards.
His main problem up to now has

been accuracy.
The addition of Lewis, plus a
few new tricky plays, indicates
an offensive shake-up following
two had games. The Indians have
socred six points and have ac
counted for only 223 yards in
their last two games.
Another switch in practice has
been Dale Rubin playing on the
defensive team, in place of Jack
Lodato.
