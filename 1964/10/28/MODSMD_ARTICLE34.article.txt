# Editor, The Daily
## Daily Staff Dissent: Exercise In Negativism 
### 
Dear Sir:
My compliments to the Dis
senting Seven on the Edit Board
for their masterful exercise it
negativism on the editorial page
of Tuesday's Daily.
They entitle their column "Our
Choice: Johnson in '64." With
such a title one would expect elo
quent praise of Mr. Johnson's
pasi actions and reasons why his
re-election to the Presidency
would serve the best interests of
the United States. But what do
we find? A column-long article
criticizing Senator Goldwater.
In the whole article I find but
seven lines of positive endorse
ment of President Johnson, fol
lowed by a rather cryptic state
ment admitting that the authors
are confused about President
Johnson's intentions relative to
"The Great Society." It seems
even they aren't sure what their
man alvocates or what they are
voting for.
It is easy to criticize Sen. Gold
water, because he takes a stand.
But apparently President John
son can't even be supported, ex
cept in the negative sense of tear
ing down his opponent, because
even his supporters are confused
as to what he stands for.

Dear Sir:
I found your "editorial" endors
ing Goldwater a disgusting effort
on the part of a very distorted
mind. If, as you put it, it was an
editorial, why didn't you state it
to be as such. As it stands, it rep
resents "we," Stanford U., to the
rest of the nation. Furthermore,
I do not feel that the school paper
should i)e the airing platform for
one politically frustrated individ
ual.
You, Mr. Naylor, aren't "we"
the student body and don't ever
again think you are. If, as you
say, the paper doesn't represent
the views of the campus or the
students, why not change the
name to the Naylor News or some
such title. Believe it or not. you
do have a responsibility to the
campus, a fact sadly overlooked.
If I were an undecided voter,
it would be actions such as these
on the part of Goldwater sup
porters that would change my
mind. Imagine endorsing him on
behalf of "we." when "we" favor
Johnson 2-1.
Thank God you will only be
here another year.

• Paleo-Political Paradox
Dear Sir:
. . . Consider the situation out
here on the Farm, where not
even the "Winds of Freedom" can
blow. A large majority of Stan
ford students (according to a
Daily poll) favor President John
son in the current election. Many
medical students have even helped
organize county-wide Democra
tic registration and election pre
cinct work united by a common
concern over the radical shift in
Republican philosophy personi
fied by Goldwater.
Then came your Monday edi
torial. We stumbled in disbelief
through line after line of cliches
reflecting the frightened distrust
or contemporary American social
a n d economic realities. We
slogged our way right up to the
astounding blasphemy attempt
ing to present 'Senator Barely
lloldwater' as a "profile in cour
age." How can one honestly use
this phrase in speaking of Gold
water's weak evasions in the face
of two great contemporary moral
issues -- the Test Ban Treaty and
the Civil Rights Bill? If you had
not filled out the page with com
ments by Bonine and Buckley, the
conflict between the views you
echo and the real world might
have been too great for even the
most mythically-minded of your
readers to bear.
The concern lhat many of us
feel for this election is partly
based on the paradoxes your
views so ably reflect. If we only
had a mcssiah to show us how to
weaken national government and
at the same time 'stem the tide'
of "increasing Communist pow
er'' then all of America's re

pressed individuals could could
what?—run department stores
and operate ham radios?? Surely,
there would be nothing else to do,
for we would have destroyed all
the evil 'out there' leaving only
what we started with in our
hearts - pure righteousness.
We continue to wait a cogent
apologist to interpret Goldwater's
latest word in paleo-political para
doxes.

Dear Sir:
In your editorial endorsing
Barry Goldwater for President
you mentioned John F. Kennedy's
term, "profile in courage," but
failed to list the exact criteria to
which Senator Goldwater is said
to conform.
Each of Mr. Kennedy's profiles
stood steadfast, despite "the risks
of their careers, the unpopularity
of their courses, the defamation
of their characters, and some
times, but sadly only sometimes,
the vindication of their reputa-1
tions and their principles."
Each of Mr. Kennedy's heroes i
was a man whose "desire to win I
or maintain a reputation for in
tegrity and courage was stronger
than his desire to maintain his
office because his conscience, j
his personal standard of ethics, I
his integrity, or morality was
stronger than the pressures of!
public disapproval because his
faith that his course was the best j
one, and would ultimately be vin- j
dicated, outweighed his fear of |
public reprisal."
The great Americans of the:
past, from John Quincy Adams
to Robert A. Taft, can make way ;
for a newcomers. Barry Go 1 d- j
water is a man who would rather j
be right than President could i
be hot h.

Dear sir:
Although I can agree with Mr.
Naylor th;it "Senator Goldwater
. . . is hardly the ideal candidate. I
His shortcomings are many," I
must disagree with Mr. Naylor's
belief in Senator Goldwater's phil
osophies 1 consist ency.
A true conservative, worried
about the growth of I he federal
budget, and realizing that 68 per,
cent of that budget goes for cold,
war activities, would be more in-,
terested in disarmament than Hum

Senator is. In fact. Senator Gold
water has attacked Secretary Me-
Namara for refusing to spend
more on defense than the Secre
tary though necessary.
If there is a threat of a "world
of stifling conformity," it comes
from over-zealous insistance on
political conformity on the part
of groups like the House Un-
Amercan Activities Committee in
the name of anti-Communism.
President Eisenhower's farewell
address warning the nation of
an "industrial-military complex"
should be taken more seriously.
How can the Senator charge
that enforcement of the Civil
flights bill would require a fed
eral police state, and then promise
to enforce it? How can he vote
against federal aid to education
because, he says, he fears federal
control of education, yet support
those controls (loyalty affidavits,
etc.)? How can he attack the
President for failing to stop vio
lence on the streets, yet favor in
creased state and local responsi
bilities?
True conservatives, worried
about the torrent of hatred set.
loose by the Senator's campaign,
support President Johnson's re
election and his plea for national
reconciliation.

Dear Sir:
I am getting more than a little
weary and perturbed at the use
of class time by my English in
structor to denegrate Senator
Goldwater. A lengthy political
criticism of The Daily editorial
consumed much of Monday's
class — surely our tuition should
be going to something more
worthwhile than partisan polem
ics. My definition of an education
does not include such misuse of
my tuition money, especially when
when equal time is not given.

Hi" Rnrrv is Ihe man I»u you
Dear Sir:
My compliments to the Dis
senting Seven on the Edit Board
for their masterful exercise it
negativism on the editorial page
of Tuesday's Daily.
They entitle their column "Our
Choice: Johnson in '64." With
such a title one would expect elo
quent praise of Mr. Johnson's
pasi actions and reasons why his
re-election to the Presidency
would serve the best interests of
the United States. But what do
we find? A column-long article
criticizing Senator Goldwater.
In the whole article I find but
seven lines of positive endorse
ment of President Johnson, fol
lowed by a rather cryptic state
ment admitting that the authors
are confused about President
Johnson's intentions relative to
"The Great Society." It seems
even they aren't sure what their
man alvocates or what they are
voting for.
It is easy to criticize Sen. Gold
water, because he takes a stand.
But apparently President John
son can't even be supported, ex
cept in the negative sense of tear
ing down his opponent, because
even his supporters are confused
as to what he stands for.

Dear Sir:
I found your "editorial" endors
ing Goldwater a disgusting effort
on the part of a very distorted
mind. If, as you put it, it was an
editorial, why didn't you state it
to be as such. As it stands, it rep
resents "we," Stanford U., to the
rest of the nation. Furthermore,
I do not feel that the school paper
should i)e the airing platform for
one politically frustrated individ
ual.
You, Mr. Naylor, aren't "we"
the student body and don't ever
again think you are. If, as you
say, the paper doesn't represent
the views of the campus or the
students, why not change the
name to the Naylor News or some
such title. Believe it or not. you
do have a responsibility to the
campus, a fact sadly overlooked.
If I were an undecided voter,
it would be actions such as these
on the part of Goldwater sup
porters that would change my
mind. Imagine endorsing him on
behalf of "we." when "we" favor
Johnson 2-1.
Thank God you will only be
here another year.

• Paleo-Political Paradox
Dear Sir:
. . . Consider the situation out
here on the Farm, where not
even the "Winds of Freedom" can
blow. A large majority of Stan
ford students (according to a
Daily poll) favor President John
son in the current election. Many
medical students have even helped
organize county-wide Democra
tic registration and election pre
cinct work united by a common
concern over the radical shift in
Republican philosophy personi
fied by Goldwater.
Then came your Monday edi
torial. We stumbled in disbelief
through line after line of cliches
reflecting the frightened distrust
or contemporary American social
a n d economic realities. We
slogged our way right up to the
astounding blasphemy attempt
ing to present 'Senator Barely
lloldwater' as a "profile in cour
age." How can one honestly use
this phrase in speaking of Gold
water's weak evasions in the face
of two great contemporary moral
issues -- the Test Ban Treaty and
the Civil Rights Bill? If you had
not filled out the page with com
ments by Bonine and Buckley, the
conflict between the views you
echo and the real world might
have been too great for even the
most mythically-minded of your
readers to bear.
The concern lhat many of us
feel for this election is partly
based on the paradoxes your
views so ably reflect. If we only
had a mcssiah to show us how to
weaken national government and
at the same time 'stem the tide'
of "increasing Communist pow
er'' then all of America's re

pressed individuals could could
what?—run department stores
and operate ham radios?? Surely,
there would be nothing else to do,
for we would have destroyed all
the evil 'out there' leaving only
what we started with in our
hearts - pure righteousness.
We continue to wait a cogent
apologist to interpret Goldwater's
latest word in paleo-political para
doxes.

Dear Sir:
In your editorial endorsing
Barry Goldwater for President
you mentioned John F. Kennedy's
term, "profile in courage," but
failed to list the exact criteria to
which Senator Goldwater is said
to conform.
Each of Mr. Kennedy's profiles
stood steadfast, despite "the risks
of their careers, the unpopularity
of their courses, the defamation
of their characters, and some
times, but sadly only sometimes,
the vindication of their reputa-1
tions and their principles."
Each of Mr. Kennedy's heroes i
was a man whose "desire to win I
or maintain a reputation for in
tegrity and courage was stronger
than his desire to maintain his
office because his conscience, j
his personal standard of ethics, I
his integrity, or morality was
stronger than the pressures of!
public disapproval because his
faith that his course was the best j
one, and would ultimately be vin- j
dicated, outweighed his fear of |
public reprisal."
The great Americans of the:
past, from John Quincy Adams
to Robert A. Taft, can make way ;
for a newcomers. Barry Go 1 d- j
water is a man who would rather j
be right than President could i

Dear sir:
Although I can agree with Mr.
Naylor th;it "Senator Goldwater
. . . is hardly the ideal candidate. I
His shortcomings are many," I
must disagree with Mr. Naylor's
belief in Senator Goldwater's phil
osophies 1 consist ency.
A true conservative, worried
about the growth of I he federal
budget, and realizing that 68 per,
cent of that budget goes for cold,
war activities, would be more in-,
terested in disarmament than Hum

Senator is. In fact. Senator Gold
water has attacked Secretary Me-
Namara for refusing to spend
more on defense than the Secre
tary though necessary.
If there is a threat of a "world
of stifling conformity," it comes
from over-zealous insistance on
political conformity on the part
of groups like the House Un-
Amercan Activities Committee in
the name of anti-Communism.
President Eisenhower's farewell
address warning the nation of
an "industrial-military complex"
should be taken more seriously.
How can the Senator charge
that enforcement of the Civil
flights bill would require a fed
eral police state, and then promise
to enforce it? How can he vote
against federal aid to education
because, he says, he fears federal
control of education, yet support
those controls (loyalty affidavits,

President for failing to stop vio

bilities?

Dear Sir:
I am getting more than a little
weary and perturbed at the use
of class time by my English in
structor to denegrate Senator
Goldwater. A lengthy political
criticism of The Daily editorial
consumed much of Monday's
class — surely our tuition should
be going to something more
worthwhile than partisan polem
ics. My definition of an education
does not include such misuse of
my tuition money, especially when
when equal time is not given.

Dear Sir:
I am getting more than a little
weary and perturbed at the use
of class time by my English in
structor to denegrate Senator
Goldwater. A lengthy political
criticism of The Daily editorial
consumed much of Monday's
class — surely our tuition should
be going to something more
worthwhile than partisan polem
ics. My definition of an education
does not include such misuse of
my tuition money, especially when
when equal time is not given.

• The Hoover Institution
Dear Sir:
The Stanford Community was
extremely grateful for the com
ments of several noted Hoover
Institute scholars on the signifi
cance and possible ramifications
of Khrushchev's dismissal for the
future of Soviet politics.
Perhaps they would care to
speculate on the significance and
possible ramifications of former
President Hoover's passing for
their own futures as Hoover In
stitute scholars.

Hi" Rnrrv is Ihe man I»u you
Dear Sir:
My compliments to the Dis
senting Seven on the Edit Board
for their masterful exercise it
negativism on the editorial page
of Tuesday's Daily.
They entitle their column "Our
Choice: Johnson in '64." With
such a title one would expect elo
quent praise of Mr. Johnson's
pasi actions and reasons why his
re-election to the Presidency
would serve the best interests of
the United States. But what do
we find? A column-long article
criticizing Senator Goldwater.
In the whole article I find but
seven lines of positive endorse
ment of President Johnson, fol
lowed by a rather cryptic state
ment admitting that the authors
are confused about President
Johnson's intentions relative to
"The Great Society." It seems
even they aren't sure what their
man alvocates or what they are
voting for.
It is easy to criticize Sen. Gold
water, because he takes a stand.
But apparently President John
son can't even be supported, ex
cept in the negative sense of tear
ing down his opponent, because
even his supporters are confused
as to what he stands for.

Dear Sir:
I found your "editorial" endors
ing Goldwater a disgusting effort
on the part of a very distorted
mind. If, as you put it, it was an
editorial, why didn't you state it
to be as such. As it stands, it rep
resents "we," Stanford U., to the
rest of the nation. Furthermore,
I do not feel that the school paper
should i)e the airing platform for
one politically frustrated individ
ual.
You, Mr. Naylor, aren't "we"
the student body and don't ever
again think you are. If, as you
say, the paper doesn't represent
the views of the campus or the
students, why not change the
name to the Naylor News or some
such title. Believe it or not. you
do have a responsibility to the
campus, a fact sadly overlooked.
If I were an undecided voter,
it would be actions such as these
on the part of Goldwater sup
porters that would change my
mind. Imagine endorsing him on
behalf of "we." when "we" favor
Johnson 2-1.
Thank God you will only be
here another year.

• Paleo-Political Paradox
Dear Sir:
. . . Consider the situation out
here on the Farm, where not
even the "Winds of Freedom" can
blow. A large majority of Stan
ford students (according to a
Daily poll) favor President John
son in the current election. Many
medical students have even helped
organize county-wide Democra
tic registration and election pre
cinct work united by a common
concern over the radical shift in
Republican philosophy personi
fied by Goldwater.
Then came your Monday edi
torial. We stumbled in disbelief
through line after line of cliches
reflecting the frightened distrust
or contemporary American social
a n d economic realities. We
slogged our way right up to the
astounding blasphemy attempt
ing to present 'Senator Barely
lloldwater' as a "profile in cour
age." How can one honestly use
this phrase in speaking of Gold
water's weak evasions in the face
of two great contemporary moral
issues -- the Test Ban Treaty and
the Civil Rights Bill? If you had
not filled out the page with com
ments by Bonine and Buckley, the
conflict between the views you
echo and the real world might
have been too great for even the
most mythically-minded of your
readers to bear.
The concern lhat many of us
feel for this election is partly
based on the paradoxes your
views so ably reflect. If we only
had a mcssiah to show us how to
weaken national government and
at the same time 'stem the tide'
of "increasing Communist pow
er'' then all of America's re

pressed individuals could could
what?—run department stores
and operate ham radios?? Surely,
there would be nothing else to do,
for we would have destroyed all
the evil 'out there' leaving only
what we started with in our
hearts - pure righteousness.
We continue to wait a cogent
apologist to interpret Goldwater's
latest word in paleo-political para
doxes.

Dear Sir:
In your editorial endorsing
Barry Goldwater for President
you mentioned John F. Kennedy's
term, "profile in courage," but
failed to list the exact criteria to
which Senator Goldwater is said
to conform.
Each of Mr. Kennedy's profiles
stood steadfast, despite "the risks
of their careers, the unpopularity
of their courses, the defamation
of their characters, and some
times, but sadly only sometimes,
the vindication of their reputa-1
tions and their principles."
Each of Mr. Kennedy's heroes i
was a man whose "desire to win I
or maintain a reputation for in
tegrity and courage was stronger
than his desire to maintain his
office because his conscience, j
his personal standard of ethics, I
his integrity, or morality was
stronger than the pressures of!
public disapproval because his
faith that his course was the best j
one, and would ultimately be vin- j
dicated, outweighed his fear of |
public reprisal."
The great Americans of the:
past, from John Quincy Adams
to Robert A. Taft, can make way ;
for a newcomers. Barry Go 1 d- j

be right than President could i

Dear sir:
Although I can agree with Mr.
Naylor th;it "Senator Goldwater
. . . is hardly the ideal candidate. I
His shortcomings are many," I
must disagree with Mr. Naylor's
belief in Senator Goldwater's phil
osophies 1 consist ency.
A true conservative, worried
about the growth of I he federal
budget, and realizing that 68 per,
cent of that budget goes for cold,
war activities, would be more in-,
terested in disarmament than Hum

Senator is. In fact. Senator Gold
water has attacked Secretary Me-
Namara for refusing to spend
more on defense than the Secre
tary though necessary.
If there is a threat of a "world
of stifling conformity," it comes
from over-zealous insistance on
political conformity on the part
of groups like the House Un-
Amercan Activities Committee in
the name of anti-Communism.
President Eisenhower's farewell
address warning the nation of
an "industrial-military complex"
should be taken more seriously.
How can the Senator charge
that enforcement of the Civil
flights bill would require a fed
eral police state, and then promise
to enforce it? How can he vote
against federal aid to education
because, he says, he fears federal
control of education, yet support
those controls (loyalty affidavits,
etc.)? How can he attack the
President for failing to stop vio
lence on the streets, yet favor in
creased state and local responsi
bilities?
True conservatives, worried
about the torrent of hatred set.
loose by the Senator's campaign,
support President Johnson's re
election and his plea for national
reconciliation.

Dear Sir:
I am getting more than a little
weary and perturbed at the use
of class time by my English in
structor to denegrate Senator
Goldwater. A lengthy political
criticism of The Daily editorial
consumed much of Monday's
class — surely our tuition should
be going to something more
worthwhile than partisan polem
ics. My definition of an education
does not include such misuse of
my tuition money, especially when
when equal time is not given.

Dear Sir:
My compliments to the Dis
senting Seven on the Edit Board
for their masterful exercise it
negativism on the editorial page
of Tuesday's Daily.
They entitle their column "Our
Choice: Johnson in '64." With
such a title one would expect elo
quent praise of Mr. Johnson's
pasi actions and reasons why his
re-election to the Presidency
would serve the best interests of
the United States. But what do
we find? A column-long article
criticizing Senator Goldwater.
In the whole article I find but
seven lines of positive endorse
ment of President Johnson, fol
lowed by a rather cryptic state
ment admitting that the authors
are confused about President
Johnson's intentions relative to
"The Great Society." It seems
even they aren't sure what their
man alvocates or what they are
voting for.
It is easy to criticize Sen. Gold
water, because he takes a stand.
But apparently President John
son can't even be supported, ex
cept in the negative sense of tear
ing down his opponent, because
even his supporters are confused
as to what he stands for.

Dear Sir:
I found your "editorial" endors
ing Goldwater a disgusting effort
on the part of a very distorted
mind. If, as you put it, it was an
editorial, why didn't you state it
to be as such. As it stands, it rep
resents "we," Stanford U., to the
rest of the nation. Furthermore,
I do not feel that the school paper
should i)e the airing platform for
one politically frustrated individ
ual.
You, Mr. Naylor, aren't "we"
the student body and don't ever
again think you are. If, as you
say, the paper doesn't represent
the views of the campus or the
students, why not change the
name to the Naylor News or some
such title. Believe it or not. you
do have a responsibility to the
campus, a fact sadly overlooked.
If I were an undecided voter,
it would be actions such as these
on the part of Goldwater sup
porters that would change my
mind. Imagine endorsing him on
behalf of "we." when "we" favor
Johnson 2-1.
Thank God you will only be

• Paleo-Political Paradox
Dear Sir:
. . . Consider the situation out
here on the Farm, where not
even the "Winds of Freedom" can
blow. A large majority of Stan
ford students (according to a
Daily poll) favor President John
son in the current election. Many
medical students have even helped
organize county-wide Democra
tic registration and election pre
cinct work united by a common
concern over the radical shift in
Republican philosophy personi
fied by Goldwater.
Then came your Monday edi
torial. We stumbled in disbelief
through line after line of cliches
reflecting the frightened distrust
or contemporary American social
a n d economic realities. We
slogged our way right up to the
astounding blasphemy attempt
ing to present 'Senator Barely
lloldwater' as a "profile in cour
age." How can one honestly use
this phrase in speaking of Gold
water's weak evasions in the face
of two great contemporary moral
issues -- the Test Ban Treaty and
the Civil Rights Bill? If you had
not filled out the page with com
ments by Bonine and Buckley, the
conflict between the views you
echo and the real world might
have been too great for even the
most mythically-minded of your
readers to bear.
The concern lhat many of us
feel for this election is partly
based on the paradoxes your
views so ably reflect. If we only
had a mcssiah to show us how to
weaken national government and
at the same time 'stem the tide'
of "increasing Communist pow
er'' then all of America's re

pressed individuals could could
what?—run department stores
and operate ham radios?? Surely,
there would be nothing else to do,
for we would have destroyed all
the evil 'out there' leaving only
what we started with in our

We continue to wait a cogent
apologist to interpret Goldwater's

Dear Sir:
In your editorial endorsing
Barry Goldwater for President
you mentioned John F. Kennedy's
term, "profile in courage," but
failed to list the exact criteria to
which Senator Goldwater is said
to conform.
Each of Mr. Kennedy's profiles
stood steadfast, despite "the risks
of their careers, the unpopularity
of their courses, the defamation
of their characters, and some
times, but sadly only sometimes,
the vindication of their reputa-1
tions and their principles."
Each of Mr. Kennedy's heroes i
was a man whose "desire to win I
or maintain a reputation for in
tegrity and courage was stronger
than his desire to maintain his
office because his conscience, j
his personal standard of ethics, I
his integrity, or morality was
stronger than the pressures of!
public disapproval because his
faith that his course was the best j
one, and would ultimately be vin- j
dicated, outweighed his fear of |

Dear sir:
Although I can agree with Mr.
Naylor th;it "Senator Goldwater
. . . is hardly the ideal candidate. I
His shortcomings are many," I
must disagree with Mr. Naylor's
belief in Senator Goldwater's phil
osophies 1 consist ency.
A true conservative, worried
about the growth of I he federal
budget, and realizing that 68 per,
cent of that budget goes for cold,
war activities, would be more in-,
terested in disarmament than Hum

Senator is. In fact. Senator Gold
water has attacked Secretary Me-
Namara for refusing to spend
more on defense than the Secre
tary though necessary.
If there is a threat of a "world
of stifling conformity," it comes
from over-zealous insistance on
political conformity on the part
of groups like the House Un-
Amercan Activities Committee in
the name of anti-Communism.
President Eisenhower's farewell
address warning the nation of
an "industrial-military complex"
should be taken more seriously.
How can the Senator charge
that enforcement of the Civil
flights bill would require a fed
eral police state, and then promise
to enforce it? How can he vote
against federal aid to education
because, he says, he fears federal
control of education, yet support
those controls (loyalty affidavits,
etc.)? How can he attack the
President for failing to stop vio
lence on the streets, yet favor in
creased state and local responsi
bilities?
True conservatives, worried
about the torrent of hatred set.

Dear Sir:
I am getting more than a little
weary and perturbed at the use
of class time by my English in
structor to denegrate Senator
Goldwater. A lengthy political
criticism of The Daily editorial
consumed much of Monday's
class — surely our tuition should
be going to something more
worthwhile than partisan polem
ics. My definition of an education
does not include such misuse of
my tuition money, especially when
when equal time is not given.

Dear Sir:
My compliments to the Dis
senting Seven on the Edit Board
for their masterful exercise it
negativism on the editorial page
of Tuesday's Daily.
They entitle their column "Our
Choice: Johnson in '64." With
such a title one would expect elo
quent praise of Mr. Johnson's
pasi actions and reasons why his
re-election to the Presidency
would serve the best interests of
the United States. But what do
we find? A column-long article
criticizing Senator Goldwater.
In the whole article I find but
seven lines of positive endorse
ment of President Johnson, fol
lowed by a rather cryptic state
ment admitting that the authors
are confused about President
Johnson's intentions relative to
"The Great Society." It seems
even they aren't sure what their
man alvocates or what they are
voting for.
It is easy to criticize Sen. Gold
water, because he takes a stand.
But apparently President John
son can't even be supported, ex
cept in the negative sense of tear
ing down his opponent, because
even his supporters are confused
as to what he stands for.

Dear Sir:
I found your "editorial" endors
ing Goldwater a disgusting effort
on the part of a very distorted
mind. If, as you put it, it was an
editorial, why didn't you state it
to be as such. As it stands, it rep
resents "we," Stanford U., to the
rest of the nation. Furthermore,
I do not feel that the school paper
should i)e the airing platform for
one politically frustrated individ
ual.
You, Mr. Naylor, aren't "we"
the student body and don't ever
again think you are. If, as you
say, the paper doesn't represent
the views of the campus or the
students, why not change the
name to the Naylor News or some
such title. Believe it or not. you
do have a responsibility to the
campus, a fact sadly overlooked.
If I were an undecided voter,
it would be actions such as these
on the part of Goldwater sup
porters that would change my
mind. Imagine endorsing him on
behalf of "we." when "we" favor
Johnson 2-1.
Thank God you will only be

• Paleo-Political Paradox
Dear Sir:
. . . Consider the situation out
here on the Farm, where not
even the "Winds of Freedom" can
blow. A large majority of Stan
ford students (according to a
Daily poll) favor President John
son in the current election. Many
medical students have even helped
organize county-wide Democra
tic registration and election pre
cinct work united by a common
concern over the radical shift in
Republican philosophy personi
fied by Goldwater.
Then came your Monday edi
torial. We stumbled in disbelief
through line after line of cliches
reflecting the frightened distrust
or contemporary American social
a n d economic realities. We
slogged our way right up to the
astounding blasphemy attempt
ing to present 'Senator Barely
lloldwater' as a "profile in cour
age." How can one honestly use
this phrase in speaking of Gold
water's weak evasions in the face
of two great contemporary moral
issues -- the Test Ban Treaty and
the Civil Rights Bill? If you had
not filled out the page with com
ments by Bonine and Buckley, the
conflict between the views you
echo and the real world might
have been too great for even the
most mythically-minded of your
readers to bear.
The concern lhat many of us
feel for this election is partly
based on the paradoxes your
views so ably reflect. If we only
had a mcssiah to show us how to
weaken national government and
at the same time 'stem the tide'
of "increasing Communist pow
er'' then all of America's re

pressed individuals could could
what?—run department stores
and operate ham radios?? Surely,
there would be nothing else to do,
for we would have destroyed all
the evil 'out there' leaving only
what we started with in our
hearts - pure righteousness.
We continue to wait a cogent
apologist to interpret Goldwater's
latest word in paleo-political para
doxes.

Dear Sir:
In your editorial endorsing
Barry Goldwater for President
you mentioned John F. Kennedy's
term, "profile in courage," but
failed to list the exact criteria to
which Senator Goldwater is said
to conform.
Each of Mr. Kennedy's profiles
stood steadfast, despite "the risks
of their careers, the unpopularity
of their courses, the defamation
of their characters, and some
times, but sadly only sometimes,
the vindication of their reputa-1
tions and their principles."
Each of Mr. Kennedy's heroes i
was a man whose "desire to win I
or maintain a reputation for in
tegrity and courage was stronger
than his desire to maintain his
office because his conscience, j
his personal standard of ethics, I
his integrity, or morality was
stronger than the pressures of!
public disapproval because his
faith that his course was the best j
one, and would ultimately be vin- j

* Religion Series
Dear Sir:
The Stanford Christian Council 1
and the Committee on Religious
Affairs are to be commended for j
broadening and extending there- j
ligious experiences available to
students thru the current series
of lectures and services of the j
three branches of Chistendom.
Those of us among faculty, staff ;
and student body who are inter-1
ested in eastern religions a n d
other non-Christian religions
such as Humanism, Ethical Cul
ture and Unitarian Unixersalism
hope and expect that these, too,
will be explored and demon
strated. Such an expanded series
would show an even greater uni
versality of man's quest for a
good and meaningful life.
Sincerely.

• Harry Inconsistent
Dear sir:
Although I can agree with Mr.
Naylor th;it "Senator Goldwater
. . . is hardly the ideal candidate. I
His shortcomings are many," I
must disagree with Mr. Naylor's
belief in Senator Goldwater's phil
osophies 1 consist ency.
A true conservative, worried
about the growth of I he federal
budget, and realizing that 68 per,
cent of that budget goes for cold,
war activities, would be more in-,
terested in disarmament than Hum

Senator is. In fact. Senator Gold
water has attacked Secretary Me-
Namara for refusing to spend
more on defense than the Secre
tary though necessary.
If there is a threat of a "world
of stifling conformity," it comes
from over-zealous insistance on
political conformity on the part
of groups like the House Un-
Amercan Activities Committee in
the name of anti-Communism.
President Eisenhower's farewell
address warning the nation of
an "industrial-military complex"
should be taken more seriously.
How can the Senator charge
that enforcement of the Civil
flights bill would require a fed
eral police state, and then promise
to enforce it? How can he vote
against federal aid to education
because, he says, he fears federal
control of education, yet support
those controls (loyalty affidavits,
etc.)? How can he attack the
President for failing to stop vio
lence on the streets, yet favor in
creased state and local responsi
bilities?
True conservatives, worried
about the torrent of hatred set.
loose by the Senator's campaign,
support President Johnson's re
election and his plea for national
reconciliation.

• Polities In Classroom
i. 11' i
Dear Sir:
I am getting more than a little
weary and perturbed at the use
of class time by my English in
structor to denegrate Senator
Goldwater. A lengthy political
criticism of The Daily editorial
consumed much of Monday's
class — surely our tuition should
be going to something more
worthwhile than partisan polem
ics. My definition of an education
does not include such misuse of
my tuition money, especially when
when equal time is not given.

• The Hoover Institution
Dear Sir:
The Stanford Community was
extremely grateful for the com
ments of several noted Hoover
Institute scholars on the signifi
cance and possible ramifications
of Khrushchev's dismissal for the
future of Soviet politics.
Perhaps they would care to
speculate on the significance and
possible ramifications of former
President Hoover's passing for
their own futures as Hoover In
stitute scholars.
