## '64 Campaign: A Symbol Of Student Disillusionment 
### Art Fisher 
Election night is nearly upon us. The polls promise a thrash
ing lor Goldwater, a narrow passage lor California's Proposition
14.
Within hours journalists will have explored and propounded
the significance ol the results. Europeans will discuss the mean-

ing of the election in the UnitecH
; States; commentators here will
! debate its effect on the continent.
And most Americans will sigh
with relief, bored and exhausted,
| eager to lose themselves again in
j earning and consumption, eager
1 to forget Bobby Baker and Billy
; Miller once and for all time.
; For this campaign has been
roundly reviled. The two presi
dential candidates stand as fat
apart as have any since the 19305, |
land yet the issues separating,
them have been discussed only!
: by outside observers and aggres
sive special-interest groups.
The Republicans have centered
their attack on the misdeeds of
: three men over the past six years, :
! claiming to have unearthed a!
seething den of corruption.
The second great issue on which
campaign oratory offers us "a |
choice" is in the middle name of
the next vice-president, a matter,
| of vital concern to any thinking
jperson.
I The Democrats sit like a hen
j over too many chicks, frightened
I to move lest a few escape 1 h e
j maternal wing.
The main event should bo as
| intellectually gripping as a Pills
\ bury bake-off. One by one, alert
j commentators are damning the j
! campaign of 19(vl as a frightful,
' perversion of the democratic proc-:
! ess.
Student Reaction
i The reaction within the student
I community has been far different, '
i far more important. The observa-1
! tions of the professionals, men
| seasoned by dozens of elections,
J are largely irrelevant for us. The
I effect of this election on the stu
dent community may be analyzed !
long before the returns are in,
an effect produced by the atmos- j
: phere and emotions of the past
: months, wholly unrelated to the
! final outcome.
The campaign of 1961 has been ;
a fitting conclusion to a year of
bitter disillusionment for the
! American student.
I This is not a dissappointed j
J yelp of self-righteous moralism j
i at the cynical refusal of both par
j tics to discuss the "important
| issues." Any student who reaches !
I the age of fourteen still believing :
I that politico! candidates anywhere
will diligently offer their opinions
on all issues has been protected
j from newspapers. Too. there ex-'
ists in this country an "articula-1
tion gap," perhaps more signifi
cant than any missile gap, which
tends to preclude discussion of j
intimate and fundamental mat- 1
| tors.
Sources ni Disillusionment
Our disillusionment began with
the tragedy of the assassination.
John Kennedy more than any
other leading political figure ex
emplified the best of the values
of a university community. That j
he had died, and with his passing
intellectuality was de-emphasized
i if not displaced, crushed many;
I who had felt that at last they had
a spokesman to challenge the ad
vocates of hard-nose-ism and use
; fulism.
In Dixie, Stanford students and
hundreds of others risked their
lives and struggled and tried and
learned that massive efforts yields
small results in moving those
I minds are like flock pilings. We
are asking men suddenly to stand
; up, men who for five generations
: have saved themselves only by
! cowering. We have long damned
the slowness of the whites; only
now are we learning the depth,!
: the immensity of that slowness. |

i 111 California, the light over
I Proposition II hrv done more to I

shatter relations between age
groups thaji a battalion of Beatles
ever could. Most of us have been
raised to respect and treat equally
men of all colors. We assumed
that those who preached believed
as well. All that is over. We have
I learned that to millions "man
kind" means "my kind," that to
many, hope for Negro equality is
like allegiance to a ball team: still
ja virtue but well down the list,
i Students have been shocked,
confounded, and saddened by their
l patents, much as the parents
would be if a student were to re
| turn home with an illegitimate
j baby. There is no anger, only an
| aching disappointment.
Effects of Goldwaterism
In Goldwaterism we have seen
self-interest masquerading as the
Declaration of Independence; we
have seen fear disguised as a posi
tive foreign policy. Make no mis
j take. Were Goldwater himself
not thought to be a potential
Wyatt Earp with H-bombs, his
; support would be far broader. It
j is not sinful that people living on
the prairies of Nebraska and Wy
oming cannot understand or sym
j pathize with the problems of slum
clearance, urban renewal, rapid
J transit, and better schools in the
big cities. But that their votes,
cast in all good conscience, should
work to fell these vital programs
does not breed optimism in the
I student community.
We listened too intently; we
believed too readily. We sorely
misunderstood the inner nature
of the "American way of life,"
; and we now pay the price of re
learning.
( oiiservative Disenchantment
Even for the most conservative,
| riding the wave of emotional re
lease that Goldwaterism affords
them, there must be glum mo
ments. The austere, hardworking
j midwestern farmer must recoil at
1 the thought that his political bene
factors are the bermuda-shorted,
i tail-finned new-rich of Los An-
S gcles.
Doesn't doubt nibble at the
more sensitive of Barry's Boys
Jas they employ the iron-fisted
j ward politics so long the exclu
sive province of the big city
Democratic machines — raving,
singing, stamping mass meetings
J for Individualism?
Barring an astounding upset,
Johnson will win easily. And yet
for students the Johnson victory
will be loss signifcant than th e
Goldwater candidacy, for it is
I Goldwaterism that has arisen as
a phenomenon of our time, an
unexpected development to chal
lenge our understanding.
The collision with Goldwater
ism, the unmasking of sentiment
: over Proposition 14, and the small
: ness of the South are the forces
shaping and hardening our poli
tical minds. In a twelve month
period we have received a concen
trated opportunity for matura
tion, an opportunity equalled in
few previous peacetime periods.
We stand disillusioned; perhaps
we should be profoundly thank
ful.
Despite 1h c disillusionment,
Stanford students are returning
to Mississippi; youth is effective
in politics as seldom before. From
disillusionment one chooses be
tween withdrawal and a return to
the fray, aware of the odds, com
-1 mil tod. We have made our choice.
Later perhaps not all of that will
be sacrificed to concern over
I hab|e<- and the bo* •
