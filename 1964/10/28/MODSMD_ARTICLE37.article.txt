## Radicals: Don't Vote For Johnson Either 
### GARRETT LAMBREV 
1 ake man) radicals in this campaign, I find niyseli caught be
tween the devil and the deep bine sea. 1 get psychic cramps when
I think that most radicals will allow themselves to be deceived
into supporting President Johnson and a host of lesser evils, all
militant supporters of the arms race and ot our poor excuse for

i an economic system.
Compromise, I heartily agree, is
. a valuable tool but it is only of
! use when there exists a common
■ basis of values and philosophy on
which to compromise. Where is |
the basis for this compromise J
| with the warfare-state liberals?
How Is Minority Hoard
A political minority exerts
| power only in proportion to its!
: size and to its willingness to
i threaten withdrawal of support !
from a major contender. As small j
I a minority as the democratic left
| will only be absorbed and dis- 1
! solved if it allows itself to enter
the Democratic Party. Instead of
achieving contact with the 'grass;
roots,' it will retire into the back
ground and lose touch with any
constituency, potential or actual.
In any case, the major parties
need no longer bargain with it.
1 can take it for granted without
: fearing loss of votes..
A minority exercises influence
not only by this process of lever- 1
i age but by education as well.
Rarely do the voters open their
: minds to new ideas; even more
rarely does the mass media allow
them to reach the electorate. One
of these rare oecasionse is a presi
dential election like the present.

Goldwater's semi- or demi- Hit

support of the Democrats. Yet for

be opposed. If Johnson is not op-I
! posed from the left, then the!

whole political dialogue in this
country will be moved so many
more degrees to the right.
The real issues of peace and
>a peaceful society will continue
I to be ignored and replaced with
I destructive and irrelevant ones.
; The question is not whether to
extend the war to North Vietnam,
las it is currently posed, but
i whether to continue the fruitless
■ one in South Vietnam. The ques
j tion is not whether field com
| mandcrs should be allowed to
I make the nuclear decisions; it is
whether anyone, civilian or mili
tary, should be so empowered.
The basic question of our times,
that of an alternative to war and
preparation for war, the question
of non-violence, has not been
posed let alone debated. And it
cannot be debated within the
framework of the two-party svs
lem.
An inclusive radical party has
not been formed for this election.
But radicals do not have to go
all or even part of the way with
LBJ; nor do they have to stay
home. They can cast protest votes
for either Clifton Deßerry and
Edward Shaw of the Socialist
Workers Party or Eric Mass and
Henning Blomen of the Socialist
Labor Party. Where they are not
on the ballot as in California
one can write them in.
Don't be so glum Chicken Lit

I to fall . . . yet.
