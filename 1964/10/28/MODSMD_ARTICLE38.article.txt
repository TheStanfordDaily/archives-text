## Lanier's 'Drive, He Said': A Promising First Effort 
### Al Heineman 
It is a banal phrase, and one an author would sooner die than
hear, but it is an appropriate one for Jeremy Lanier's Drive, lie
Said: the novel is a very promising first effort.
The book, winner of the $10,000 Delta Prize \'<>vel Contest,
was seleeted from over 1,000 manuscripts, the jacket blurb tells

( us, by Leslie Fiedler, Mary Mc-"
I Carthy and Walter Van Tilburg
j Clark (in descending order of
: competence). It is very rich, very
resonant, at times extremely
funny, and certainly relevant to
j the personal world of any who
involve themselves subjectively
I with the current political scene.
The Plot
The novel concerns a college
basketball star. Hector Bloom,
who cannot stop playing the
i game a microcosm of author
Larner's concept of the world
! "game" of little wars and tactical
; maneuverings with countries as
pawns- and yet is disgusted with
himself for participating in such
a meaningless sport. His best
! friend, Gabriel Reuben, the dis
illusioned scion of a comfortably
J bourgeois businessman, seeks di
rection through political revolu
tion, which he tries to achieve
; through pacifism, Communism,
j Zen, marijuana, or any of a num
ber of other emotional outlets.
1 There are some remarkable
parallels to The Great Gatsby in
i the story. Bloom is having an
! affair with the wife of one of his
1 teachcrs; he has her, and yet
doesn't wholly have her, since he
wants her to renounce her hus
j band and escape, somewhere, with
1 him. She is not willing to give up
; her home-familv-security ties. And
Larner describes a party in the
j course of the novel which makes,
i any of Gat shy's orgies resemble
afternoon teas.
Tragi-Comie lOnding
What eventually happens is
that Gabriel, careening nearer
; and nearer to a final crack-up,
| semi-accidentally stabs to death
the wife of another teacher at ihe
college (presumably NYCC) and
commits suicide by setting fire 1
to the gigantic homecoming float
atop which he is perched, on the
l nose of the simulated college
i president, the largest of three
figures on the float. He dies with
his arms outstretched, in a tragi
. comic burlesque of the crucifixion
and the Trinity.
There are a great many prob
lems with the book, however; they
seem technical problems, which
may be resolved in later works,
which is one reason for the epithet
"promising." The most basic of
these would seem to be a shift
; ing point of view and tone. Lar
ner from third-person omniscient
| to internal monologue, and from
very moving, involving subjective
I reaction to a detached and often
I cruel irony. It is perhaps too
j much to expect that the reader
follow along.
Undiluted Crisis
Another vaguely disturbing fea-1
| lure of Ihe novel is its almost j
Icon t;iht (Ifpiction of nc i in the i

life of Hector and or Gabriel. The
! sustained excruciating tenor is
I wearying, and the possibility of
I effectiveness by contrast is lost.
! These crises are presented in an
! episodic fashion, in terribly rapid
| sequence; Larner may have
wanted to suggest the hectic and
; frantic color of the protagonist's
life, but he also makes it difficult
for the reader to be carried with
him. The reader must, in effect,
supply his own continuity.
Finally, and occasionally dis
astrously, the minor characters
| are in many cases caricatured to
fit the purposes of the book. A
wild old capitalist who cackles
epigrams of Love and Death, a
basketball coach not appreciably
different from any other basket
ball coach in literature (begin
ning with Frank Merriwell), a
cuckolded babbitt of a classic
teacher, an effeminate beat poet;
all are interesting and sometimes
truly funny, but they are card
board, not flesh and blood.
Book Has Its Virtues
All of which is not to say that
Drive, He Said is an unworth
while bit of work. The major
characters are very well done, and
Larner (who studied at Brandeis
and Cal) is close enough to the
contemporary college world to
pinpoint beautifully many of the
seemingly endless burdens of the
post-adolescent looking for a
meaningful values system. The
concept itself life as a game
whose rules are set up by unap
proachable. ineffable Authority,
a game we abhor but must mind
lessly continue to play is set
up on several levels within the
book, and intelligently examined
at all of the levels.
And the prose is good. Larner
has a clear grasp of the language,
and if he is not poetic, he is pre
cise and usually effective. One is
led to suspect that the lack of
poetic exposition is due to the
author's purposeful portrayal of
the contemporary world as hur
ried and harried, with senseless
rock and roll lyrics and hack
neyed folk songs as its substitute
for poetry.
Perhaps, however, the most val
uable aspect of Drive, He Said is
Larner's often frightening extra
polation of society into absurd or
savage grotesqueries. He throws
a bit too much of the spectrum
of experience into the book
killings and near killings and
the constant presence of poten
tial or actual violence but his
sardonic satire is perceptive and
telling.
The book is, in short (and for
give, God, this barbaric analogy),
a healthy chunk of meat, but it
hasn't been cooked exactly right.

Larner (who studied at Brandeis

rock and roll lyrics and hack

for poetry.
Perhaps, however, the most val

Larner's often frightening extra
polation of society into absurd or
savage grotesqueries. He throws
a bit too much of the spectrum
of experience into the book
killings and near killings and
the constant presence of poten

sardonic satire is perceptive and

The Plot
The novel concerns a college
basketball star. Hector Bloom,
who cannot stop playing the
i game a microcosm of author
Larner's concept of the world
! "game" of little wars and tactical
; maneuverings with countries as
pawns- and yet is disgusted with
himself for participating in such
a meaningless sport. His best
! friend, Gabriel Reuben, the dis
illusioned scion of a comfortably
J bourgeois businessman, seeks di
rection through political revolu
tion, which he tries to achieve
; through pacifism, Communism,
j Zen, marijuana, or any of a num
ber of other emotional outlets.
1 There are some remarkable
parallels to The Great Gatsby in
i the story. Bloom is having an
! affair with the wife of one of his
1 teachcrs; he has her, and yet
doesn't wholly have her, since he
wants her to renounce her hus
j band and escape, somewhere, with
1 him. She is not willing to give up
; her home-familv-security ties. And
Larner describes a party in the
j course of the novel which makes,
i any of Gat shy's orgies resemble
afternoon teas.
Tragi-Comie lOnding
What eventually happens is
that Gabriel, careening nearer
; and nearer to a final crack-up,
| semi-accidentally stabs to death
the wife of another teacher at ihe
college (presumably NYCC) and
commits suicide by setting fire 1
to the gigantic homecoming float
atop which he is perched, on the
l nose of the simulated college
i president, the largest of three
figures on the float. He dies with
his arms outstretched, in a tragi
. comic burlesque of the crucifixion
and the Trinity.
There are a great many prob
lems with the book, however; they
seem technical problems, which
may be resolved in later works,

The Plot
The novel concerns a college
basketball star. Hector Bloom,
who cannot stop playing the
i game a microcosm of author
Larner's concept of the world
! "game" of little wars and tactical
; maneuverings with countries as
pawns- and yet is disgusted with
himself for participating in such
a meaningless sport. His best
! friend, Gabriel Reuben, the dis
illusioned scion of a comfortably
J bourgeois businessman, seeks di
rection through political revolu
tion, which he tries to achieve
; through pacifism, Communism,
j Zen, marijuana, or any of a num
ber of other emotional outlets.
1 There are some remarkable
parallels to The Great Gatsby in
i the story. Bloom is having an
! affair with the wife of one of his
1 teachcrs; he has her, and yet
doesn't wholly have her, since he
wants her to renounce her hus
j band and escape, somewhere, with
1 him. She is not willing to give up
; her home-familv-security ties. And
Larner describes a party in the
j course of the novel which makes,
i any of Gat shy's orgies resemble
afternoon teas.
Tragi-Comie lOnding
What eventually happens is
that Gabriel, careening nearer
; and nearer to a final crack-up,
| semi-accidentally stabs to death
the wife of another teacher at ihe
college (presumably NYCC) and
commits suicide by setting fire 1
to the gigantic homecoming float
atop which he is perched, on the
l nose of the simulated college
i president, the largest of three
figures on the float. He dies with
his arms outstretched, in a tragi
. comic burlesque of the crucifixion
and the Trinity.
There are a great many prob
lems with the book, however; they
seem technical problems, which
may be resolved in later works,
which is one reason for the epithet
"promising." The most basic of
these would seem to be a shift
; ing point of view and tone. Lar
ner from third-person omniscient
| to internal monologue, and from
very moving, involving subjective
I reaction to a detached and often
I cruel irony. It is perhaps too
j much to expect that the reader
follow along.
Undiluted Crisis
Another vaguely disturbing fea-1
| lure of Ihe novel is its almost j
Icon t;iht (Ifpiction of nc i in the i

life of Hector and or Gabriel. The
! sustained excruciating tenor is
I wearying, and the possibility of
I effectiveness by contrast is lost.
! These crises are presented in an
! episodic fashion, in terribly rapid
| sequence; Larner may have
wanted to suggest the hectic and
; frantic color of the protagonist's
life, but he also makes it difficult
for the reader to be carried with
him. The reader must, in effect,
supply his own continuity.
Finally, and occasionally dis
astrously, the minor characters
| are in many cases caricatured to
fit the purposes of the book. A
wild old capitalist who cackles
epigrams of Love and Death, a
basketball coach not appreciably
different from any other basket
ball coach in literature (begin
ning with Frank Merriwell), a
cuckolded babbitt of a classic
teacher, an effeminate beat poet;
all are interesting and sometimes
truly funny, but they are card
board, not flesh and blood.
Book Has Its Virtues
All of which is not to say that
Drive, He Said is an unworth
while bit of work. The major
characters are very well done, and
Larner (who studied at Brandeis
and Cal) is close enough to the
contemporary college world to
pinpoint beautifully many of the
seemingly endless burdens of the
post-adolescent looking for a
meaningful values system. The
concept itself life as a game
whose rules are set up by unap
proachable. ineffable Authority,
a game we abhor but must mind
lessly continue to play is set
up on several levels within the
book, and intelligently examined
at all of the levels.
And the prose is good. Larner
has a clear grasp of the language,
and if he is not poetic, he is pre
cise and usually effective. One is
led to suspect that the lack of
poetic exposition is due to the
author's purposeful portrayal of
the contemporary world as hur
ried and harried, with senseless
rock and roll lyrics and hack
neyed folk songs as its substitute
for poetry.
Perhaps, however, the most val
uable aspect of Drive, He Said is
Larner's often frightening extra
polation of society into absurd or
savage grotesqueries. He throws
a bit too much of the spectrum
of experience into the book
killings and near killings and
the constant presence of poten
tial or actual violence but his
sardonic satire is perceptive and
telling.
The book is, in short (and for
give, God, this barbaric analogy),
a healthy chunk of meat, but it
hasn't been cooked exactly right.
