### FRED KOCH 
A "Southerners for Johnson" committee has
been organized on the mid-peninsula by two Stan
ford students to campaign for (lie president's re
election, fighl Proposition 14, and to combat the
Soulh's white supremacist image.
Serving as organizers and co-chairmen of the
group are John Rosenberg, a history student from
Alabama, and Robert Canzoncri, a soul hern col
lege professor from Mississippi now on a study
grant given by the English department.
MKMBKKS OF the organization include Pro
fessors George Sensabaugh of Texas, John Loll is
of Georgia, and Claude Simpson of Texas, all
members of the English department, and more
than 1" students representing all the slates south
of the MasonDixon Line.
Calling for the support of all I heir fellow
Southerners, the group urge the election of John
son and Humphrey.
As their statement said:
"WE BELIEVE that because of oui particular
background we are able to recognize in Senator
Goldwater's platform and public statements many
of the same policies which have legalized inhuman
ity, promoted social upheaval, and retained eeo
noinii privation in the South."

Their statement continued, "On the same
grounds, vve advocate a NO vote Proposition 14,
passage of which would result in a legal codifica
tion for California of a basic Southern policy."
Proposition 14 is the initiative constitutional
amendment on the November 3 ballot that would
nullify the state's anti-discrimination housing laws,
including the Rumford Act, and prevent future
legislation in the same field.
HEADING THE advisory board of the commit
tee is Marry Ashmorc, the Pulitzer prize-winning
editor of the Arkansas Gazette, who editorialized
against demonstrations protesting integration of
Little Hock schools.
Also on the board are Floyd Lowe, formei
ORE A president and long-time opponent of Propo
sition I 1, a native Mississippian, and Sidna Browcr,
prize-winning editor of the University of Missis
sippi student paper duiing the student riots there,
Both Rosenberg and Can/oneri emphasized that
the group is releasing this statement of informa
tion about itself at this time because "invasion ol
Ihe Bay Area by the Citizens Councils makes it
urgent that Califortiians hear from Southerners
who know better."
Information about the organization may be ob
tained by phoning 323-lUj9.

A "Southerners for Johnson" committee has
been organized on the mid-peninsula by two Stan
ford students to campaign for (lie president's re

Alabama, and Robert Canzoncri, a soul hern col
lege professor from Mississippi now on a study
grant given by the English department.
MKMBKKS OF the organization include Pro
fessors George Sensabaugh of Texas, John Loll is
of Georgia, and Claude Simpson of Texas, all
members of the English department, and more
than 1" students representing all the slates south
of the MasonDixon Line.
Calling for the support of all I heir fellow
Southerners, the group urge the election of John
son and Humphrey.
As their statement said:
"WE BELIEVE that because of oui particular
background we are able to recognize in Senator
Goldwater's platform and public statements many
of the same policies which have legalized inhuman
ity, promoted social upheaval, and retained eeo
noinii privation in the South."

Their statement continued, "On the same
grounds, vve advocate a NO vote Proposition 14,
passage of which would result in a legal codifica
tion for California of a basic Southern policy."
Proposition 14 is the initiative constitutional
amendment on the November 3 ballot that would
nullify the state's anti-discrimination housing laws,
including the Rumford Act, and prevent future
legislation in the same field.
