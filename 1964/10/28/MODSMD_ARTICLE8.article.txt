# High Schools Use Computer To Plan Students' Activities
## 
### HARRY KELLOGG 
A new concept of flexible sehed
i uling using data-processing equip
i ment has been introduced in vary
ing degrees into 22 high schools
j in seven Western states this fall.
J The program was developed by.
! Prof. Dwight Allen and Prof.
I Robert Bush, both of the Stan
i ford Education Department.
! The classes are scheduled elec
tronically at the Stanford Com
putation Center, "determining
who teaches what to whom,
; where, when, and how much of it
; for how long."
THE PROGRAM was developed,
j according to Prof. Allen, to aid
schools. If education is compul
t sory, schools have an obligation
to arrange their curriculum so
; everyone will succeed.
Allen suggests the grammar
or high school should first set
: its achievement standards, and
then try to help students reach

them with a minimum rather
lhan a maximum amount of el
fort.
fie proposes specific reforms in
education according to two gen
eral categories. The first is struc
tural reform: the general organ
ization of the school, the length
of class periods, and the size of
classes. The second concerns it
self with content: which courses
to give the student, how far to
go into a subject, from what
point of view to approach the
subject, etc.
THi; ADJUSTMENT of the
length of class periods, Allen ex
plains, is based on basic premises.
Every student does not need to
study the same subject for the
same amount of time. What the
individual student intends to do
with the subject should determine
the amount of time he spend on
it.
Similarly, the content of the
course and its approach should be
determined by how far the stu
dent excepts to go in a subject.
The emphasis of a course de
signed for students planning to
attend college would be different
from that in the same course
taught to those preparing for a
trade.
Professor Allen extended this
concept to the case of the student
who is likely to drop out of school.
"He should be helped by school
authorities to find a job while
lie is still in school. They should
reduce the amount of his class

room time so that ho can stay
in school and work."
"I WOULD like to see tho
school day go from 8:00 in the
morning to 5:00 in the afternoon,"
Allen added, "but with everything
done during that time."
According to Allen, this means
that students would finish their
homework, do research papers,
and participate in extra-curric
ulum activities during that pe
riod of time. They would have
assistance from teachers avail
able, a better environment for
study, and better research facil
ities in this way.
The new school day would also
be applied by teachers. They
would be able to prepare the fol
lowing day's class, check home
work, and graduate exams before
leaving the school.
The program was first intro
duced last, fall under the super
vision of Bush and Allen at three
high schools in California and
one in Oregon.
