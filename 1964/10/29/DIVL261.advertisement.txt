The Box or the Ring I
Life is real, life is earnest,
And the grave is not its goal;
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
Was not spoken of the soul.—LONGFELLOW
If man should give a young lady a valuable ring in a box
wouldn't it be ridiculous for the girl to be more concerned '
about the box than the ring? Likewise, isn't it foolish for in
dividuals to be spending all their time and thoughts on their
bodies when these are only cases, containers, for the real
person, the soul? The Bible tells us that our bodies will crum
ble into dust from whence they came after physical death,
but that our souls are immortal and will continue forever.
(Eccl. 12:7, Rev. 20:12-15)
Jesus Christ in Mark 8:36 asks the question, "What shall
it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his
own soul?" So in the estimation of Jesus Christ, a man's soul
is something incomparably more valuable than the whole
world. We learn from the Bible, where the Gospel of Mark
is found, that in order for an individual to "save his soul he
must personally acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord. "That if 1
thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the
dead, thou shalt be saved.' (Romans 10:9)
Conversely if a person rejects Jesus Christ, God says our
souls will be condemned to eternal punishment after phys
ical death. "He that believeth on him is not condemned; but
he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath
not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.'
(John 3:18)
Are you today more concerned about your physical welfare
than the destiny of your real self, the soul? Is it the box or
the contents which has captured your attention? Salvation
can be experienced and assurance from God is positive for
all those who claim the name of Jesus Christ as Lord. i

it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his
own soul?" So in the estimation of Jesus Christ, a man's soul
is something incomparably more valuable than the whole
world. We learn from the Bible, where the Gospel of Mark
is found, that in order for an individual to "save his soul he
must personally acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord. "That if 1
thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt
believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the
dead, thou shalt be saved.' (Romans 10:9)
Conversely if a person rejects Jesus Christ, God says our
souls will be condemned to eternal punishment after phys
ical death. "He that believeth on him is not condemned; but
he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath
not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.'
(John 3:18)
Are you today more concerned about your physical welfare
than the destiny of your real self, the soul? Is it the box or
the contents which has captured your attention? Salvation
can be experienced and assurance from God is positive for
all those who claim the name of Jesus Christ as Lord. i

The Box or the Ring I
Life is real, life is earnest,
And the grave is not its goal;
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
Was not spoken of the soul.—LONGFELLOW
If man should give a young lady a valuable ring in a box
wouldn't it be ridiculous for the girl to be more concerned '
about the box than the ring? Likewise, isn't it foolish for in
dividuals to be spending all their time and thoughts on their
bodies when these are only cases, containers, for the real
person, the soul? The Bible tells us that our bodies will crum
ble into dust from whence they came after physical death,
but that our souls are immortal and will continue forever.
(Eccl. 12:7, Rev. 20:12-15)
