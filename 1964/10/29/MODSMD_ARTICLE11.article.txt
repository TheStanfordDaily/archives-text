THE CONSTITUTION can now
be interpreted to prohibit such
elections except at the spring
quarter ASSU election.
The By-Laws Committee will
also hear discussion of the pro
posed LASSU Executive Secretary
and Director of Operations.
According to Hillenbrand, with
the increased business in the
Legislature this year, "more non
member staff will be needed to
do paperwork and typing. Both
the Legislature and its Commit
tees will need help in preparing
resolutions and bills," explains
Hillenbrand.
The By-Laws Committee has
been instructed by the Legislature
to draw up "The necessary legis
lation to permanently create these
positions."
