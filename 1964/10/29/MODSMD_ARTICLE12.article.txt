# Liquor Heads List Of 'Misconduct' Charges Before Women's Council
## 
### SUE DALEY (Last in a Series) 
Cases which come up before Women's Council
under the charge ol "misconduct" usually involve
liquor, but the category includes such minor vio
lations as food fights, according to Nora Crow,
Women's Council chairman.
She gave the following cases as examples:
FRAN ATTENDED a rush party with a boy
she knew only casually. Her date did not dance,
and the loud music made conversation difficult.
She and her date eventually sat down with ac
quaintances and they drank about four screwdriv
ers apiece.
Never having drank vodka before, Fran was
unfamiliar with its effects. The drinks affected
her in particular, since she had slept little the
night before and had eaten nothing for lunch and
dinner. She became nauseated at the party and
again at her dormitory.
Four of her friends helped her to her room
after she lost consciousness and a friend signed
her in. The next day Fran reported herself to her
council representative.
"THE COUNCIL decided to place her on sus
pended suspension for one quarter and on proba
tion for the second," Miss Crow said, and listed
these reasons as the basis for this action:
• She had incurred no previous violations.
• She controlled her actions to the extent that
she did not attract public notice.
• Her attitude before the Council and the testi
mony of her character witnesses indicated that
she had learned from the experience.
• The offense itself was not part of a larger
pattern of irresponsible behavior.
According to records in the Women's Council
files, Carol, a widow with a three-year-old daugh
ter, lived off-campus with a Stanford man for two
years. Her parents telephoned the University and
asked that the Deans take action, since their own

protests seemed ineffectual. If the Deans decided j
not to act, Carol's parents said that they would !
call in the civil authorities.
"THE DEAN of Women informed the chair-!
man of Women's Council about the case, and the I
chairman agreed that the Deans' Office should j
handle it. The Deans chose to revoke her registra-1
lion at Stanford," Miss Crow said.
Women's Council policy regarding morals
cases was formulated and approved by the Dean !
of Women last year, Miss Crow said. It provides 1
that "the Council shall have jurisdiction in a case
involving any woman who is a registered Stan-;
ford student, including graduate studenls and
others living off-campus."
The Council may relinquish its jurisdiction i
when a competent physician has found the stu-j
dent mentally unstable or when the student re
quests that the Dean handle her case so that she
will have no official record of disciplinary action S
taken against her, Miss Crow said.
"IX AXY CASE, however, the Dean of Women !
informs the chairman of ihe circumstances; and j
the chairman informs the Council," she said.
According to the policy statement, the Council
believes that it should take action in proved cases
of sexual intercourse between unmarried students,
"when the students' disregard of common moral j
standards, if known, might result in public cen
sure of the University."
Before it takes action, however, the students
may be offered the choice of ceasing before their
conduct becomes widely known, Miss Crow said.

sten, Fran MeCarthur, and Teresa Moran, Mem-1
ber's of Women's Council, assume equal respon
sibility with Miss Crow for the statements in this
article. In yesterday's article mention was made of
an appeal to the "Faculty Appeal Board." This
should have been the "Disciplinary Subcommit
tee of the Committee on Student Affairs and Ser-:
vices.")
