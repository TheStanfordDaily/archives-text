# Yugoslav Olympians Beat Stanford, 13-2
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Yugoslavia's Olympic water
polo team dunked the Stanford
varsity last Tuesday, 13-2. The
Yugoslav nationals dealt similarly
with the San Francisco Olympic
Club on Monday, 14-6.

The Yugoslavs went undefeated
in the Olympic games earlier this
month, tying Hungary 4-4 in the
final game. As there are no play
offs in the Olympics, Hungary
was awarded the gold medal on
the basis of scores in earlier
games.
Averaging o'2", 220 pounds, and
25 years old, the Yugoslavs are
awesome opponents. Their goalie,
Milan Muskatirovic, is the world's
outstanding nctman. Bozidar Sta
nicie, who scored three goals
against Stanford, and G'T" center
forward Zlatko Simenc help to
promote Yugoslav winning ways.
WATER POLO is second only
to soccer in spectator appeal in
Yugoslavia. Most of the members
of the Yugoslavian team have
been playing water polo since the
age of ten and, naturally, are
also avid soccer players.
During their stay at Stanford,
the Yugoslavs were hosted by the
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Al
pha Tau Omega, and Delta Tau
Delta houses and by Stern Hall.
Bill Ready accounted for both
of the Stanford scores. His first
score came in the second period
when he passed the All-World
Muskatirovic with a red hot back
hand. Ready tallied once more in
the final period for Stanford's last
score.
STANFORD GOALIE Jim Ellis
turned in a fine performance.
Ellis made 11 saves against the
hard-shooting Yugoslavs.
UCLA will come to the Encina
pool tomorrow afternoon at 3:30
rying to avenge their 9-8 loss to
he Indians earlier in the season.
Stanford needs a win over the
(Jclans to stay in the race for the
conference crown. The frosh meet
College of Sequoias following the
varsity game.
Saturday, the varsity travels
south to meet the perennially
tough Long Beach State. At 11:00
a.m. at Stanford, the freshman
team will seek to lengthen its un
defeated string. Their opponents,
Await High, took fifth in th e
Olympic trials and should put the
Papooses to a true test.
