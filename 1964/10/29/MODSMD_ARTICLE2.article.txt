# Walker Is Critical Of U.S. Military
## Denounces Gov't Foreign Policies 
### LEE WRIGHT 
CÂ»eneral Edwin A. Walker
iired a shotgun blast at failure 1
and weakness in U.S. military
management in a speech last
night before a capacity crowd in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Criticizing sharply first U.S.
foreign policy in such areas as
Laos. Vietnam, and Cuba, he
moved on to denunciations of the
political use of troops and mili
tary agencies in United States
itself, as in Oxford, Mississippi.
Walker, former commander of
troops on four continents, re
signed from the U.S. Army in
1961 after being assigned to a
high post of army troops in the
Pacific which would have in
cluded planning, training and
operations of all army troops in
Laos and South Vietnam. He re
signed in protest against the mis
direction and absence of "whole
hearted" effort in Asia. "We are
losing that war," he said.
Walker condemned the poor
handling of the U.S. Special
Forces in Laos, which, he said,
canceled its effectiveness in guer
rilla warfare. Dual leadership of
the U.S. and the U.N. also led to
confusion, he asserted. "So many
contradictory visions were impos
sible."
Misuse of U.S. military agen
cies also on the domestic scene.
Walker claimed. Citing his per
sonal experience in Oxford. Mis
sissippi. he stated that the origi
nal purposes of the military have
been corrupted by political ele
ments. By army regulation, "No
soldier can force any civilian to
obey any law," in any situation
other than martial law, said Walk
er. The trend of events in the
South, however, indicate increas
ing political control over the mili
tary, he said.
"Who's got the button?" Walk
er asked in connection with the
question of control of our nuclear
power. According to our consti
tution. the President of the U.S.
"wears two hats,' 'as chief of the
civilian government and as Com
mader-in-Chicf of the Armed
Forces. In reality, says Walker,
the president's powers have been
taken over by various members
of the president's cabinet as well
as by the U.N. Secretary of De
fense McNi'amara was named as a
major offender for assuming con
trol of U.S. nuclear forces.
When asked how he would solve
problems he brought out in his
speech. General Walker concluded
that it's up to the next generation
but "I do not feel this respon
sibility should have been shoved
on any generation."
