nificance as well as a source of
great encouragement to nie. 1 am

in America, and that you are dedi

• From A Former Editor
Dear Sir:
While I disagree wholeheartedly
with Mr. Naylor's editorial en
dorsement of Senator Goldwater,
i must agree wholeheartedly with
his right to do so.
The Daily has never been, and
can never be, run as a democratic
institution, li would be foolish to
feel that the editorials of the edit- j
or will agree consistently with!
the majority of the Daily staff or
even the editorial board, much less
with the majority of the Stanford
community. Part of the editor's,
responsibility involves working j
within the framework of his own
integrity and own personal con-j
vietions; to do anything less j
would be to deprive The Daily of
its essential freedom.
The masthead of The Daily was !
enlarged two years ago (and has.
been expanded since t to empha
size that The Daily is editorially 1
independent of both the Univer
sity and the Associated Students. ;
The "Editorial opinions are (and!
must be) those of the editor . . '
no other condition would bo toler-;
able. Mr. Naylor's only other re-j
sponsibility in this regard is to
provide space for other opinions, j
which he seems to be doing freely !
and fairly.
Mr. Naylor should be compli
mented on both his courage and
his uniqueness. The Daily has had
"liberal" editors for over three
years, and his opinions while
not agreed with are welcome.!

• American Mainstream
Dear Sir:
Adlai Stevenson, campaigning
for the Johnson-Humphrey ticket
in Minneapolis a few weeks ago
claimed that "Barry Goldwater is |
outside the philosophical tradition j
of his own party, the party of
Lincoln and of Teddy Roosevelt, j
and is without the fabric of the|
larger American democratic tra-!
dition, a tradition of Thomas Jef
ferson. . . ."
Meanwhile, tlneo blocks across
town, Goldwater was himself ad- j
dressing 18,000 votarians and ex
plaining that "Adlai Stevenson,
who has defended criminal ac
tions, and Lyndon Johnson, who

, has consistently urged bigger and
I more costly federal government
'encroachment upon the individ
ual, are the ones outside the main-
I stream of America's great principles.
| ciples. . . ."
The s-i thing is, both were
right.
True, Johnson and Goldwater
have disagreed on occasion, a n d
true, both candidates manage to
sound like old American heroes
from time to time (Johnson is
ivrriiniscent of co-vulgarian Many
"ruman when he tells a jnerirv
audience thai i- they don't like
I his programs o ' don'l agr?e wW*
his benign but omnipercipient
ejaculations, they may "go to you
! know where" presumably the
; nt"irest local YMCAt, hut on the
real issues, the "gut issues," e tj.
!ii.' conspiracy of international
bankers, civil rights, and e'c. we
WASPS of the great American
i mainstream are left without an
alternat iv e.
Where, when there are more
conspiracies than Mark Lane or
Phoebe Courtney can blink an eye
at. and the bankers seem poised
to take over, is the calm, reason
ing voice of the mainstreamer
par oxcellance, Ben Franklin,
warning darkly of the "grave con
sequences" we risk by letting
Jewish bankers into the 1 country.
Where, indeed, when both Barry
' and Lyndon are desperately at
| tempting to out egalitarianize
i each other in fulminations over
some saccharine brotherhood of
equal men, is that very thread of
i American fabric, Abe Lincoln, to
suggest that if "God gave (the
Negro) but little, that little let
; him enjoy" while insisting, of
■ course, that "the white man
j should have the superior posi
! tion."
Or where, when both candidates
admit to deploring racial stereo
i types, is the All-American, all
: time great of the U.S. mainstream
ing, Thomas Jefferson, to advise
the makers of the nation's anti
; perspirants that "the Negro has
; a strange odor."
And where, when both Gold
water and Johnson seem capable
j of substantial hopes for the em
i erging nations on the African
: Continent, is the great contempo
rary, humanitarian-type main
streamer. Albeit Schweitzer, to
| counsel that the new "African
nationalism won't amount to
anything" because "you can't
i change their basic inability to
think."
Yes, to relate, we native
! born floaters in the grand main
i stream, wo who are bound to "the
! magnificent fabric" of "tradition
' al American principles." we vvh o
recognize the "grave eonse
| quence's" of Jewish immigration
i and granting Negroes an equal
' position, are once again disen
franchised, once more ignored.
But after so many echoes and
j extremists, there still exists in
this moderate's heart the glim
mer of hope that one of these fine
1 days shall arise a statesman who

will draw his principles from
those of our great forefathers,
rind take mainstream stands on
ithe "gut issues." An undupable.

• Nobody Likes Lyndon
Dear Sir:
The contrast between the oppos
ing "endorsements" in the Daily
j points out perhaps the most in
, teresting aspect of the Presiden
| tial campaign - nobody likes
Lyndon.
The first editorial praises Gold
water and tells why the author
favors him. The second denounces
I Goldwater in no uncertain, but
perhaps misguided, terms and
• hen, in four short sentences near
the end finally says something
about Johnson. Let's see he
comes from a one-party state,
, knows how to wheel-and-deal in
j Washington, and has a running
mate that is sufficiently liberal to
' merit praise by the national news
media. My, what a rinigng "en
dorsement."
This second editorial effort says
in effect We don't like Goldwater
! and can't think of anything good
to say about Johnson, but he is
the only alternative, so we are for
■ him.
Doesn't anyone like Lyndon?

• Winds Of Freedom
Dear Sir:
The future looked somber to
| me until I read in the S.F. Exam
iner today that The Stanford
Daily is supporting the candidacy
of Barry Goldwater for President.
Your editorial comes as a fresh
breeze from the sea to clear away
the Boeotian fog.
Despite the avalanche of lies and
; hate the germ of freedom lives
; and will again blossom and bear
fruit. The motto David Starr Jor
dan chose for Stanford and which
Senator Stanford approved takes
on new meaning—"The Winds of
Freedom Blow."
