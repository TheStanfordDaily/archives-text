## Some Modest Proposals To Solve Farm Problem 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
\ ice Presidential candidate William Miller is quoted as saying
that Barry Coldwatcr would not alter evisting arrangements with
respect to Farmers' subsidies. There are those who hope Mr.
Miller is profoundly wrong, ii there is am domestic situation that
urgently needs mending, it is the agricultural boondoggle; and one

hopes I hat before Senator Gold
water is through campaigning, he
will have suggested a few re
forms.
I recall a statement 1 heard

three years
ago which I have
neve r hear d
gainsaid. It was
a professor who
said it, and of
liberal leaning.
"1 do not know,"
he confessed, "of
any one of intel
lectual responsi
bility who do-

j consumed crops, at prices that the
market will not countenance?
I think the professor's idea is
sound, but 1 would combine it
with the idea of another professor
who has also written searchingly
on the problem. His suggestion is
that the Federal Government con
tinue its subsidy of the individual
farmer with one strict provision,
namely that no offspring of any
farmer now working on a farm,
will be entitled to a similar suh
j sidy.
Why Institutionalize It?
Ii is, the professor reasons cor
rectly, one thing for the govern
ment to shield a farmer against
the ravages of a volatile market
place; it is something quite dif
: ferent for the government to in
stitutionalize a demonstrably un
j economic situation. If Mr. Jones
discovers, half way through his
lifetime, that he cannot make a
: living by growing wheat, go
ahead so runs the wclfarist
argument and pay Jones to not
raise wheat, or pay him to raise
wheat by giving him artificially
i high prices. But what reason on
j earth to encourage Jones Junior
;to follow in his father's foot
steps? Let the government sub
sidy extend to Mr. Jones. But let
| it, like the British honorific, be
; a lifetime peerage, untransferable
to his son. There is no reason, in
economics, in charity, or in jus
i tice, to tax productive secretaries
; and coal miners and carpenters
| and bus drivers in order to pay
| people indefinitely to glow a use
j less commodity.
Can't .Subsidize Everything
It is pleasant 1o suppose that
! the Federal Government can sub
l sidize, indefinitely, every uneco
| nomic activity. Common sense
requires the conclusion that in
! fact it cannot; that if every far
; mer puts forward a claim to per
{ petual protection against eco
! nomic progress so can every pro
ducer of coal, of penicillin, of ce
ment blocks, of mimeograph ma

Senator Goldwater has shown
himself prepared to look down the
throat of any number of political
dragons. What the heck, why not

subsidy programs."
Wli'ii Should Be Done?
Dui the program cannot be

j that no one of intellectual probity
! will stand up and defend the ex
| isting distortions, it is another

Any number of proposals have

i income, from whatever sources,
i exceeds seven thousand dollars
per year. His point is very simply
this, that when the Federal Gov

those farmers whose income ex

people for the benefit of richer

\ ice Presidential candidate William Miller is quoted as saying
that Barry Coldwatcr would not alter evisting arrangements with
respect to Farmers' subsidies. There are those who hope Mr.
Miller is profoundly wrong, ii there is am domestic situation that
urgently needs mending, it is the agricultural boondoggle; and one

hopes I hat before Senator Gold

will have suggested a few re
forms.
I recall a statement 1 heard

three years
ago which I have

gainsaid. It was
a professor who
said it, and of
liberal leaning.
"1 do not know,"
he confessed, "of
any one of intel
lectual responsi
bility who do-

j consumed crops, at prices that the
market will not countenance?
I think the professor's idea is
sound, but 1 would combine it
with the idea of another professor
who has also written searchingly
on the problem. His suggestion is
that the Federal Government con
tinue its subsidy of the individual
farmer with one strict provision,
namely that no offspring of any
farmer now working on a farm,
will be entitled to a similar suh
j sidy.
Why Institutionalize It?
Ii is, the professor reasons cor
rectly, one thing for the govern
ment to shield a farmer against
the ravages of a volatile market
place; it is something quite dif
: ferent for the government to in
stitutionalize a demonstrably un

discovers, half way through his
lifetime, that he cannot make a
: living by growing wheat, go
ahead so runs the wclfarist
argument and pay Jones to not
raise wheat, or pay him to raise
wheat by giving him artificially
i high prices. But what reason on

;to follow in his father's foot

\ ice Presidential candidate William Miller is quoted as saying
that Barry Coldwatcr would not alter evisting arrangements with
respect to Farmers' subsidies. There are those who hope Mr.
Miller is profoundly wrong, ii there is am domestic situation that
urgently needs mending, it is the agricultural boondoggle; and one

hopes I hat before Senator Gold
water is through campaigning, he
will have suggested a few re
forms.
I recall a statement 1 heard

three years
ago which I have
neve r hear d
gainsaid. It was
a professor who
said it, and of
liberal leaning.
"1 do not know,"
he confessed, "of
any one of intel
lectual responsi
bility who do-

j consumed crops, at prices that the
market will not countenance?
I think the professor's idea is
sound, but 1 would combine it
with the idea of another professor
who has also written searchingly
on the problem. His suggestion is
that the Federal Government con
tinue its subsidy of the individual
farmer with one strict provision,
namely that no offspring of any
farmer now working on a farm,
will be entitled to a similar suh
j sidy.
Why Institutionalize It?
Ii is, the professor reasons cor
rectly, one thing for the govern
ment to shield a farmer against
the ravages of a volatile market
place; it is something quite dif
: ferent for the government to in
stitutionalize a demonstrably un
j economic situation. If Mr. Jones
discovers, half way through his
lifetime, that he cannot make a
: living by growing wheat, go
ahead so runs the wclfarist
argument and pay Jones to not
raise wheat, or pay him to raise
wheat by giving him artificially
i high prices. But what reason on
j earth to encourage Jones Junior
;to follow in his father's foot
steps? Let the government sub
sidy extend to Mr. Jones. But let
| it, like the British honorific, be
; a lifetime peerage, untransferable
to his son. There is no reason, in
economics, in charity, or in jus
i tice, to tax productive secretaries
; and coal miners and carpenters
| and bus drivers in order to pay
| people indefinitely to glow a use
j less commodity.
Can't .Subsidize Everything
It is pleasant 1o suppose that
! the Federal Government can sub
l sidize, indefinitely, every uneco
| nomic activity. Common sense
requires the conclusion that in
! fact it cannot; that if every far
; mer puts forward a claim to per
{ petual protection against eco
! nomic progress so can every pro
ducer of coal, of penicillin, of ce
ment blocks, of mimeograph ma
< bines, of, God save us. editorial
' copy.
Senator Goldwater has shown
himself prepared to look down the
throat of any number of political
dragons. What the heck, why not
! one more?
