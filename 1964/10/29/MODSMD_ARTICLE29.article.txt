## Hubert Humphrey: Profile In Socialism 
### RICHARD A. WEIDIG 
The issue of extremism lias been interjected into tin's Presidential
campaign and rightly so. If Lyndon Johnson is elected in Novem
ber and dies in office, his successor will become the first socialist
President of the United States.
Hubert Horatio Humphrey is hailed as a legislator and scholar.

Convivial toasts with the man
who sent tanks into Budapest
have drawn upon him the aura of
statesmanship. But his political
creed is mirrored best by the poli
cies of Americans for Democra
tic Action (ADA), of which he
was a founder, National Chair
m a n, and perennial Vice-Chair
man until shortly before his ap
pointment as the Democratic
Vice-Presidential nominee.
The ADA's leftward list once
prompted the late President Ken
nedy to remark: "I'm not com
fortable with those people." In
1960, none other than Lyndon
Johnson compared the ADA
with the Ku Klux Klan when he
declared: "We don't want the sup
port of the odd balls on the left
or the right . . . ADA or KKK."
Yet four years later, who did
Johnson select as ihe man bos'
qualified to become President of
Ihe United Slates? The man who
founded Ihe ADA.
Humphrey And Th ADA
Of 191 issues appearing before
the Senate between 1949 and 1961
upon which the ADA made iis
wishes known, Senator Hum
phrey voted with the organiza
tion 19! times. Looking back
upon his few momenis of dissent,
Humphrey said:
"I think it is no secret that on
occassion this great organization
has seen fit to chastise me, a n d
perhaps properly so. Perhaps I
did not understand why at liic
moment, but their judgment was
undoubtedly better than mine."
(Congressional Record. June 20,
1957, p. 9807.)
The ADA has been described
aptly as the political arm of fa
bian socialism in the United
States. Its extensive ties with
the British Fabian Society are
documented fully in Philip
Crane's' volume, The Democrat's
Dilemma. (Regnery. 1964.) Crane
is an assistant professor of his
tory at Bradley University.
Fabianism
The ADA's mentor, the Fabian
Society, was brough to fruition
in the 1890's by socialists such as
George Bernard Shaw and the
Webbs, Sidney and Beatrice. Its
program rested upon the assump
tion that a free people would
never knowingly vote to place
themselves und e r socialism.
Therefore, the Fabians forged a
new strategy:
"People who would not dream
of calling themselves Socialists,
much less of contributing funds
to a Socialist Society, become en
thusiastically interested in sepa
rate parts of its program . . .
provided that these parts are
presented in their own merits
and not as approaches to Social
ism." (Crane, p. 5.)
Following this philosophy of
selling socialism under false pre
tenses, Arthur Sehlesinger Jr.
wrote, in 1947, what was to be
come the guiding principle of the
ADA:
"Series of New Deals"
Transition to socialism in the
United States "must be piecemeal
. . . Socialism by this means used
to seem fantastic to the hard-eyed
melodramatists of the Leninist
persuasion; but even Stalin is re
ported to have told Harold Laski
that it might be possible. There
seems no inherent obstacle to the
gradual advance of socialism in
the United States through a series
of New Deals." (Congressional
Record. February 6, 1962. p.
A 881.)

A year later, Sehlesinger co
lounded the ADA with Hum
phrey. Currently, he and John
Itoeh ADA National Chairman
are Humphrey's speech writ
ers.
The ADA's startling adherence
to Schlesingor's strategy is docu
mented in Frank L. Kluckhohn's
book, Lyndon's Legacy. (Mon
arch. 19(51. pp. 276-297.) Compare
its views with those of Senator
Humphrey.
Economic Affairs
The ADA advocates increased
government planning, financing,
and even takeover on every spe
cific economic issue before t li e
public today. Among oth e r
things:
"Government subsidies and fi
nancing and. if necessary, gov
ernment plants must be used to
provide more power, more steel,
and other vitally necessary raw
materials."
"The government needs in
creased authority over the
'amount of bank credit and bank
resources."
''Housing goals must be set by
Federal Government."
In addition, the ADA calls for
"a broad and comprehensive fed
eral program . . for schools, hos
pitals. cultural and recreational
centers, mass transit, and water
supply systems." (Kluckhohn.
pp. 288-289. i
Hubert Humphrey concurs and
goes further still. In his new
book. War Oil Poverty, he states:
"every family's income could be
brought above the $3,000 cut-off
level by direct subsidy of $11 bil
lion a year to ihe iowest income
groups . . . Certainly, this nation
could pay such ;i price, if need
tie, to provide a reasonable stan
dard of living for all Americans."
Unilateral Disarmament
The ADA would counter com
munist imperialism by "breaking
out of the vicious cycle of mutual
distrust between ourselves and
Russia. We favor a policy based
on an understanding of the legiti
mate aspirations of the Soviet
Union." (Ibid. p. 286.1
Therefore, the United States
should begin unilateral disarma
ment "which might improve the
atmosphere for multilateral dis
armament negotiations."
In this spirit, Senator Hum
phrey attempted to dissuade
President Eisenhower from send
ing the Seventh Fleet to prevent
Chinese aggression in the For
mosa Straits in 3955.
In 1959, the Senator said of
Khrushchev's disarmament pro
posals before the UN proposals
which would have left the United
States defenseless in the face of
Soviet aggression "Premier
Khrushchev's speech is the speech
our President should have made."
In 1960 during the so-called
"missile gap" Senator H u m
phrey told his colleagues: "We
must seek control and reduction
of long range missiles. But con
trol is not enough. The missiles
and bombers must either be elimi
nated or they must bo placed
und e r international control."
(Congressional Record. January
27, 1960.)
Small wonder that socialist
Norman Thomas remarked last
spring: "Humphrey is the type of
Democrat I like and one who
would be a socialist if he got to
Europe."
Less understandable is Presi
dent Johnson: "I feel strength
ened knowing that he <Hum-
phrey i is at my side at all times."
