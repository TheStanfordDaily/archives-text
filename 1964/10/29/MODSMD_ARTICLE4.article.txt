the words of Ed Shaw, last year's
Student Financial Manager and

The plea for continuity in LASSU has been in part answered
by the recent creation of the Development Committee. The spe

will hopefully offset this situa
tion by heading for long range
goals, independent of the periodic
ups and downs of LASSU.
