# CHAPPIE
## A 						Choice—Not An Echo 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGALE III 
AH previous predictions on this year's Presi
dential election may be violently upset when the
'Chaparral's first issue of the year appears on
campus tomorrow.
In a one-page statement on Political Philoso
phy, the Chappies modestly thrust forth their
own opinions on Ihe campaign ("we don't think
such a Bad Crook or such a Half-baked Fascist
jean really represent etc.") and end by urging a
great repudiation of all political parties and en
dorsing as a write-in candidate the Old Boy, who
apparently is running on a ticket of Benevolent
. Anarchy and Free Love.
TO iIELP GET the Old Boy's campaign off to
;i good start, the Chappie has thoughtfully filled
the inside of their cover with bumper stickers and
campaign buttons with which budding young an
archists and others can decorate their rest room
i walls. (An example of the OB's slogans: "Why not
PROPOSITION 11 girls today.")
, This issue is the first turned out by the Chap
pies since tliev moved from their dank little back
| room in the old Quad shack to a spacious suite
of offices (complete with halconv) in tlie palatial
i new Storke Publications Building.
At first glance it appears these new surround
ings have exerted an influence on the Chappie
Mind. From a real "artsy-craftsy" type cover
somewhat reminiscent of an infamous "Realist"
cartoon to an erudite British analysis of the out
come of the upcoming Presidential contest be
tween Baines-Johnson and Williams-Ooldwatcr
• written by the Right Honourable K. W. Smythet,
I his issue of Chappie resembles an unlikely cross
between Playboy Magazine and the Manchester
1 < ?uaidian.

A CARKFUL rending shows that the traditional
Chappie smut has not boon eliminated, however;
it has just been camouflaged. The little dirty
phrases and sexual inuendos which so characterize
the Chappie style are now slyly worked in at the
bottom of stories instead of headlined across the
lop.
Highlight of the magazine, (after the Old Boy's
announcement, of course) is a photo-type feature
on the campaign tactics of the two leading can
didates. The real prize is two pictures which may
well afford the first definite proof of Johnson's
involvement in the Jenkin's ca.se.
Another attention-arresting story is "Whispers
From A Neutral Corner." a stream-of-conscious
ness type report on an Alabama political rally.
Other interesting features include a collection of
campaign folksongs, and a lit I It 1 exercise in quasi
abstract designs entitled "The Dobbs Dialectic."
>lOUI2 IN Tin; Chappie tradition are "The
Little People." profiles of the typical Johnson and
Goldv/ater supporters, and "An Unmovcable
Feast." a letter from Abnorman Mailer to Wilhelm
Buckley in which Abbie announces his defection to
the Conservatives.
Other regular Chappie features include the Old
Boy's answer to Playboy the October Queen
Diana Mitchell, plus the traditional Now That
column describing how the < >ld Boy singlehandedly
saved the America's Cup and the usual selection
<>112 dirl\ jokes stolen from Playboy and the Head
er's Digest.
And finally as an added attraction, the Chappie
offers one of the sexiest ads to be -een on this
side of Camino in quite a while. With her uphol
stery, few readers will even notice that tin 1 young
lad> is washing I lie cut with its cover still on.
