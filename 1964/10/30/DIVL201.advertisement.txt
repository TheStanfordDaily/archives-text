And sanies. And talking horses. It's all
in a day's work. Because our engineers
are in the business of thinking up, per
fecting and producing first-of-their
kind toys like Chatty Cathy w ~ the doll
that really talks —prized possession of
more than f> million little girls. Produc
ing her, and hundreds of other soph is*

industrial engineers solve lots of first

assure opportunity for continual prod

Maybe you're a man who likes noth
ing better than finding ways to make
tilings simpler, better and cheaper. If
so, you'll find our business stimulat ing,
rewarding and loaded with potential.
Because your brand of talent has
helped us grow so fast we've become
the biggest toymaker around, with no
end to expansion in sight. That's why
we're substantially expanding our
already sizeable engineering staff,
again, during the next twelve months.
We work near the Los Angeles Inter
national Airport and raise our famflies
in the pleasant beach and valley com
munities nearby. If you think you'd
like to join us-in manufacturing, R&D

ment today to see our interviewer, on
campus.
