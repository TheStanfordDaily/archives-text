Why a racing-type engine
in a car like this?
Where do you think the Imp
gets all its go? And, go is just the beginning of
what it's got. You get up to 40 miles on a gallon
... over 70 mph speed. And, it converts
from a 4-passenger sedan to a station wagon (with
19-14 cu. ft. of cargo space) in seconds. Ever
drive one? What are you waiting for?
