# 'Hopeless Cause' No Longer Hopeless
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
The Mississippi Movement prop
erly began in 1961 when one man
-New York Negro teacher Rob
ert Moses—decided that it was
time to have a crack at cracking
the closed society.
In 1961 most civil rights groups
had marked Mississippi flown as a
hopeless cause. But Moses and the
Student Non-Violent Coordinating
Committee (SNCC) recognized
that, hopeless thought it seemed.
Mississippi was the key to the
entire South. If the worst system
of injustice could be broken and
put back together again in a new.
just form, then progress else
where 1 would be rapid.
For nearly three years, Moses
worked in Mississippi virtually
alone, feeling his way from com
munity to community, breaking
down the barriers of fear and ig
norance, taking his beatings, mo
bilizing, organizing.
SNCC had always recognized
that the Mississippi society could
be c h a n g e d permanently only
from within by an organized,
demanding Negro population
equipped to apply pressure where
the wall was weakest. By 1964,
however, SNCC recognized some
thing else that outside aid, in
the form of white northern volun
teers, was crucial if the precon
ditions to Negro organization
were ever to be established.
SNCC was aware of two things
that the segregationist society
could not stand: publicity and fed
eral intervention. The white north
erners, in a personal confrontation
with Mississippi, could catalyze
both. Thus, in the winter of 1964,
the Mississippi Movement '"deseg
regated itself" in the form of the
"Summer Project."
The Summer Project was con
ducted under the auspices of a
new organization, The Council of
Federated Organizations iCOFO)
— an amalgamation of all civil
rights groups working in the
state I CORE, NAACP, SCLC.

and, predominantly, SNCC). At
its height, the Project involved
over 600 out-of-state volunteers,
students, teachers, and profes
sional men in ihe most massive
voter registration and freedom
education program ever attempt
ed in the deep South.
The Mississippi Movement has
always been structured around atr
attempt to develop the ingredients
for a genuine, internal political
re-alignment, in the belief that
segregation can be sustained only
so long as the political system,
with its legislated injustice, re
mains stable and intact. The Sum
mer Pr oject merely sought to ex
pand the base of this attempt.
IN I IS STRUCTURE, the Sum
mer Project was tripartite: re
medial and supplementary educa
tion in the Freedom Schools, com
munity organization in the Com
munity Centers, and voter regis
tration.
The fundamental area of activ
ity was, as always, voter regis
tration. "Integration" pure anc
simple is not the issue. The Negrc
is not to be "eased into" the white
man's world.
"This movement is pointed in a
different direction," explained Bob
Moses in a New Yorker article
this summer, "not toward the
downtown white but toward the
rural Negro, not toward accept
ance by the white community bu<
toward the organization of politi
cal and other kinds of expression
in the Negro commmunity, oi
really toward the organization of
a Negro society."
THE MOVEMENT'S motto
"One Man, One Vote" is a sum
mary of the problem and Ihe aj
proach. The problem is a circle of
paralyzing injustice. If the Negro
is denied the vote "because he is
ignorant" (a common bit of
naivete) then he will always be
ignorant, because he will lack the
weapon to force the extant power
structure to educate him. The ulti
mate approach, then, is simple
the franchise, without qualifica

tion.
In Mississippi today, only 6 per
cent of all voters are Negro. 42 !
per cent of all Mississippians are |
Negro. The white power structure j
has systematically and continu-!
ally denied the Negro his most i
basic constitutional l ight. Despite

all its efforts, the Movement has I
made only a slight dent in these J
figures in three years.
Having failed in a direct frontal j
attack then,, the Movement has
adopted a new approach, em-1
bodied in the Mississippi Freedom j
Democratic Party (MFDP).

TIIE MFDP WAS air outgrowth
| of last November's Mock Election,
I held concurrent to the "official"
| Mississippi gubernatorial r ace,
j Aaron Henry, president of the
I Mississippi NAACP ran for gov-
I ernor oir a Freedom Slate. The
j only requirements for voting were

those of residence and age. De
spite severe harassment from the
white community, the Mock Ele< -
tion involved more than 100,000
Mississippi Negroes.
The MFDP, like the Moek Vote,
began as a demonstration, de
signed to show to the nation the
depth of the Negro's desire to vote
and ihe injustice of the system
which prevents him from fulfill
ing that desire. Since its inception,
however, t he MFDP has devel
oped, almost of necessity, into an
indiginous political organization,
organized parallel to the white
Democratic Party and challenging
it's authority at every point.
DURING THE Summer Pro.j
ect, the most intensive political
activity was directed, not toward
the court house and "official" reg
istration, but toward the MFDP
and the Atlantic City Convention
challenge.
As a demonstration, pure a n d
simple, the convention challenge
was a success, despite the party's
failure to seat the MFDP delega
tion. But by August, it had begun
to be clear that the MFDP was
to be more than a demonstration,
more than a paper- party that it
could bo the core around which
the Negro community, all across
the state, could organize itself.
The MFDP has continued be
yond the Summer Project, in
creasing its registration, prepar
ing the way for another Mock
Election which will be used as a
basis for challenging the legiti
macy of the "official elections" in
the courts. The MFDP is no
longer a SNCC project; it belongs
to the people of Mississippi.
TIIE SUMMER Project and its
on-going counterpart entail more
than voter registration and MFDP
activities. The project is aimed at
creating a broad base of social
and educational programs to fill
the urgent need for institutions
existing outside the established
structure to meet the vastly ne
glected needs of the Negro com
munities. The most intensive
and perhaps most important -—
program of this sort was em
bodied in the Fi'eedom Schools.
At the height of the Summer
Project, there were 41 Freedom
Schools functioning in 20 commu
nities, involving over 2,165 s 1 u

dents (twice the projected num
ber), and staffed by 175 full-time
teachers (40 of them profes
sional!. The projected curriculum
was intended to create a balance
between remedial academic work
and supplementary cultural and
political education.
The curriculum of the regular
Mississippi Negro schools ignores
political education almost entirely
and instead concentrates on th e
proliferation of concepts of South
ern history and "Southern" mores.
The Negro child "learns" his "in
feriority" in.school; any mention
of civil rights is punishable by ex
pulsion.
THE BASIC AIM of the Free
dom School curriculum then was
to bring the Negro child (students
ranged in age from 9 to 1G) into
a confrontation with himself —
with his own history as a race,
with his own identity as a person.
In practice, Freedom School
classes were conducted "ad lib"
without a formal structure. The
usual method was informal dis
cussion — "story telling" — de
signed to develop in the children
the long-neglected art of self-ex
pression.
The final aim was, in itself,
radical: not to inculcate middle
class values, but to criticize and
examine middle class values —
"to create an education experi
ence for students which will make
it possible for them to challenge
the myths of our society, to per
ceive more clearly its realities,
and to find alternatives — ulti
mately new directions for action.
The Freedom Schools will con
tinue; in a real sense they consti
tute the hope of the Mississippi
Movement. Social and political or
ganization demands leaders. The
Freedom Schools are designed to
develop such leaders -- to create
a cadre of young people who, be
cause they see the possibilities
for change, will stay in Missis
sippi, and work in Mississippi and
re-make Mississippi along the
lines of their own vision.
When that happens — when a
young cadre of realistic informed
leaders emerges, in perhaps a dec
ade's time, - then the Mississippi
Project as such will be over; the
"Movement" will have become the
people.
