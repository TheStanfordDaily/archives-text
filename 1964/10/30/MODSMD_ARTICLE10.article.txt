# Life In The Delta: 'Lard And Greens'
## 
### 
(The following' is an excerpt
from a letter by Dave Harris, a
Stanford sophomore who spent
last week doing voter registration
work in Marks, Mississippi. He
gives a documented economic pro
file of a Negro family in rural
Quitman County.
The figures I list cannot begin
to describe the conditions that ex
ist in the Mississippi Negro so
ciety. I cannot cease to be amazed
that these people bear up so well
under the circumstances. . . .
Hospitals for blacks are but a
step from "witch-doctory." Some
childcare is available at clinics;
little or no adult care is given.
. . . Death in childbirth is a con
stant fact of life. Dental care is
nonexistent. Birth control is al
most unknown. . . .
ONCE THE COTTON has been
picked and chopped, the residents
of Quitman County are liable to
starve. The family 1 studied is
presently afflicted with a case of
goiter due to malnutrition. A
"prosperous" family eats three
meals a day, with bacon instead
of fat back for breakfast. . . .
The sanitary conditions in num
erous living arrangements are
beyond imagination. Some of the
people hero have houses that sil
in the middle of large pools of
excrement. These people pay sew
er taxes and have outdoor heads,
pay street taxes and have gravel
roads. . . .
We don't need to send a Peace
Corps all the way 1o Africa to
find subhuman living conditions.
THE FOLLOWING is my fam
ily study:
• Occupation: The father is a
farm laborer, chopping and pick

ing cotton. The children also pick
cotton. The mother does not work.
(She cares for three step children
in addition to her own three.»
• Family income: $110 per
month.
• Education: The father has
had two years of school; the
mother, three. The children at
tend classes from time to time.
• Nutrition: For breakfast yes
terday the family ate biscuits and
fatback. which is a hunk of lard
or a hog's spine. The family had
no lunch, and had only turnip
greens for dinner.
• Medical and dental care, in
cluding prenatal: The wife has
had eight pregnancies; five of her
children have died. Three were de
livered by a doctor; the other five
by midwife because no doctor was
available due to a lack of money.
The family has a private physi
cian, white, who will not make
home calls; his office consulta
tions cost $1.00. Yearly medical
expenses total $130; 1 lie family
cannot afford to attend to such
medical needs as the mother's
fever and pains. The family does
not receive dental care, again lx*-
cause of the expense.
I WENT TO a mass meeting
tonight and fell in love with
Marks' black community. How
these people have managed to
stay non-violent (it is like a word
of God to them) in the face of so
much hate is beyond me. 1 want
to do so much for them. They
are such good people warm,
friendly, completely open to me,
a white man.
I wish I could take every ado
lescent cuddling in the warm in
tellectual womb of Stanford and
show him what needs to be done.

had eight pregnancies; five of her
children have died. Three were de
livered by a doctor; the other five
by midwife because no doctor was
available due to a lack of money.
The family has a private physi
cian, white, who will not make
home calls; his office consulta
tions cost $1.00. Yearly medical
expenses total $130; 1 lie family
cannot afford to attend to such
medical needs as the mother's
fever and pains. The family does
not receive dental care, again lx*-
cause of the expense.
I WENT TO a mass meeting
tonight and fell in love with
Marks' black community. How
these people have managed to
stay non-violent (it is like a word
of God to them) in the face of so
much hate is beyond me. 1 want
to do so much for them. They
are such good people warm,
friendly, completely open to me,
a white man.
I wish I could take every ado
lescent cuddling in the warm in
tellectual womb of Stanford and
show him what needs to be done.
(The following' is an excerpt
from a letter by Dave Harris, a
Stanford sophomore who spent
last week doing voter registration
work in Marks, Mississippi. He
gives a documented economic pro
file of a Negro family in rural
Quitman County.
The figures I list cannot begin
to describe the conditions that ex
ist in the Mississippi Negro so
ciety. I cannot cease to be amazed
that these people bear up so well
under the circumstances. . . .
Hospitals for blacks are but a
step from "witch-doctory." Some
childcare is available at clinics;
little or no adult care is given.
. . . Death in childbirth is a con
stant fact of life. Dental care is
nonexistent. Birth control is al
most unknown. . . .
ONCE THE COTTON has been
picked and chopped, the residents
of Quitman County are liable to
starve. The family 1 studied is
presently afflicted with a case of
goiter due to malnutrition. A
"prosperous" family eats three
meals a day, with bacon instead
of fat back for breakfast. . . .
The sanitary conditions in num
erous living arrangements are
beyond imagination. Some of the
people hero have houses that sil
in the middle of large pools of
excrement. These people pay sew
er taxes and have outdoor heads,
pay street taxes and have gravel
roads. . . .
We don't need to send a Peace
Corps all the way 1o Africa to
find subhuman living conditions.
THE FOLLOWING is my fam
ily study:
• Occupation: The father is a
farm laborer, chopping and pick

ing cotton. The children also pick
cotton. The mother does not work.
(She cares for three step children
in addition to her own three.»
• Family income: $110 per
month.
• Education: The father has
had two years of school; the
mother, three. The children at
tend classes from time to time.
• Nutrition: For breakfast yes
terday the family ate biscuits and
fatback. which is a hunk of lard
or a hog's spine. The family had
no lunch, and had only turnip
greens for dinner.
• Medical and dental care, in
cluding prenatal: The wife has
had eight pregnancies; five of her
children have died. Three were de
livered by a doctor; the other five
by midwife because no doctor was
available due to a lack of money.
