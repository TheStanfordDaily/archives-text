# Mississippi: All-White, One-Party System
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
Mississippi boasts of pure white,
one parly polities. The governor,
the lieutenant governor and all
other stale politicians are both
white and Democrats. The state's
two senators and its five con
gressmen are white Democrats.
In the legislature all 49 senators
and 122 representatives are white,
though there is one Republican
representative.
THIS HAS BEEN the case in
the state since the end of Recon
struction in 1875, and since then,
the constitutional convention of
lS9ii, has virtually prevented all
Negroes from even voting.
From 1890 to the present, the
politics of ihe slate has produced
a series of white supremacy gov
enors and history of generally bad
government. James K. Vardaman,
governor from 1904 to 1908 felt
the Negro was "a lazy, lying, lust
ful animal which no conceivable
amount of training can transform
into a tolerable citizen." At th e
time of his election fewer than
2,000 Negroes were permitted to
vote.
Vardaman's greatest rival in
the field was Theodore G. Bilbo,
twice governor and a United
States senator. Bilbo believed
"if Hip blood of our white race
should become corrupted with
the glood of Africa, then the pres
ent greatness of the United States
of America would lie destroyed
and all hope for the future would
be forever gone." To Professor
James Silver, Bilbo is "sympto
matic of the chaos and bank
ruptcy of Mississippi's one-party
svstem."
' A MORE RECENT governor of
the state, Ross Barnett once
stated, "If we start off with the
self-evident proposition that the
whites and colored are different,
we will not experience any diffi

| culty in reaching the conclusion
that they are not and never can
be equal."
The current governor Paul
! Johnson operates well within this
tradition of political leadership.
Although in his inaugural, he re
minded the people that they were
"Americans as well as Mississip
pians," since that time he has
made comments to the effect that
the National Council of Churches
was an extremist group and that
"if an> blood is shed in this state,
it will be on their hands."
V. O. KEY HAS said of South
crn politics "the almost over
whelming temptation, especially
in areas with many Negroes, is
lo take advantage of the short-run
opportunity to maintain the sta
tus-quo by using the race issue
to blot up the discontents of the
lesser whites. By this means the
governing classes can kill off or
minimize pressures for improved
governmental services from
whites and find support for low
public outlays for the benefit of
the Negro."
For example, the House passed
a bill this year (100-13) which
would have ended urban renewal
in Mississippi except in the four
cities where projects are already
under construction. The .lackson
Clarion-Ledger stated "House sup
porters of the measure said the
federal government could use the
program to force racial integra-
I tion."
The dominant party within the
.stale, while calling itself Demo
cratic, has little allegiance to the
national party.
The state party platform of
1960 stated among other things
that "We believe in the separation
of the races in the universities and
colleges, in public playgrounds,
and in all spheres of activity
where experience has shown that
it is for the best interest of both

raccs that such separation be ob
served."
GOVERNOR Johnson's cam
paign literature proclaimed
proudly in the 1962 campaign
that, "Our Mississippi Democratic
Party is entirely independent and
is free of the influence or domina
tion of any national political
party, and"the truth is that
neither national party is 'conser
vative.' Both the National Repub

lican Party and Ihe National j
Democratic Party are the dedi
cated enemies of the people of
Mississippi. The national leaders 1
j of both consistently across thel
' years — have pursued courses of
| action which have moved our be
| loved country ever leftward
I which have threatened our citi
| zens with ever more centralized
I power at Washington."
I To a large degree, however, the

maintenence of segregation in the
South depends upon the continued
one party democracy. Professor
Otis Pease of the Stanford his
tory department, writes, "State-!
wide minority groups can seldom j
gain a toehold where no fairly
stable 'opposition party' exists.
Any group which wants to use
its small vote to win favors from
majority voters must make deals
with an organized party which

can deliver on its promises or can
be counted on because of its per
manence in the community. . . .
People who are economically and
socially 'in' have a stake in any
political system which discour
ages Ihe development of issues;
where issues are kept low, pres
ent control tends to flourish. . . .
One-party politics isolates the
bulk of voters from the important
emotional and educational forces
of national politics. The cold fact
is that genuine party contests are
vital to the political process, and
they do not usually arise within
states these days unless the state
is also a battleground for a na- j
tional party contest. National or
ganizations often act as galvan
izers for local leadership, and
most really crucial local issues
are now national issues."
PERHAPS LESS eloquently,
Mississippi Democratic cam
paign literature during the 1962
election staled, "These inexperi
ence d, so-called Republicans
proudly boast that 'they are not
bound by any deep-seated taboos
and prejudices handed d o w n 1
blindly from past generations,"
but they never discuss the real
dangers of a two-party political
system in a state like Mississippi
with a 'block-voting' minority
group that represents over 4.i per |
cent of our population."
This concept is elaborated in I
other literature which states "A
DIVISION OF CONSERVATIVE
MISSISSIPPI ANS INTO TWO
POLITICAL CAMPS, as now be
ing attempted by these self-styled
Republicans, WOULD GIVE THE
BALANCE OF POWER IN MIS
SISSIPPI TO OUR MINORITY
GROUP. This would be Ihe end
of our way of life in Mississippi

and the peace, tranquillity, law
and order we now enjoy in all of
our communities would soon
come 1o an awesome end."
At the present time, however,
Mississippi's minority group is
generally far removed from any
"balance of power." The denial
of the right to vote is a conscious
and deliberate practice by county
clerks and by the state legislature.
As a result, less than 10 per cent
of Negroes over 21 in the stale
are eligible to vote, and none hold
any state political office.
REGISTERING IN Mississippi
is a long and difficult process.
Under the constitution approved
in 1892 a person had to be able
to write any section of the Mis
sissippi Constitution, or under
stand any section when read to
him, or give a reasonable inter
pretation of any section.
Following a court ruling in
1961 which, it was felt, would en
able more Negroes to qualify, an
amendment was passed to the
1892 constitution and after fail
ing in 1952, was passed in 1954.
New qualifications in the
amendment included:


A GREENWOOD, Mississippi, policeman drags a
pregnant Negro woman to jail during a Free
dom Day demonstration. A white radio announc-

er reporting the arrests drawled, "And they
dumped that Nigger woman in the back of that
paddy wagon like a sack of potatoes."
