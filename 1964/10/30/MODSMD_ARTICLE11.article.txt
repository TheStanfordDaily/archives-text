# Mississippi: All-White, One-Party System
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
Mississippi boasts of pure white,
one parly polities. The governor,
the lieutenant governor and all
other stale politicians are both
white and Democrats. The state's
two senators and its five con
gressmen are white Democrats.
In the legislature all 49 senators
and 122 representatives are white,
though there is one Republican
representative.
THIS HAS BEEN the case in
the state since the end of Recon
struction in 1875, and since then,
the constitutional convention of
lS9ii, has virtually prevented all
Negroes from even voting.
From 1890 to the present, the
politics of ihe slate has produced
a series of white supremacy gov
enors and history of generally bad
government. James K. Vardaman,
governor from 1904 to 1908 felt
the Negro was "a lazy, lying, lust
ful animal which no conceivable
amount of training can transform
into a tolerable citizen." At th e
time of his election fewer than
2,000 Negroes were permitted to
vote.
Vardaman's greatest rival in
the field was Theodore G. Bilbo,
twice governor and a United
States senator. Bilbo believed
"if Hip blood of our white race
should become corrupted with
the glood of Africa, then the pres
ent greatness of the United States
of America would lie destroyed
and all hope for the future would
be forever gone." To Professor
James Silver, Bilbo is "sympto
matic of the chaos and bank
ruptcy of Mississippi's one-party
svstem."
' A MORE RECENT governor of
the state, Ross Barnett once
stated, "If we start off with the
self-evident proposition that the
whites and colored are different,
we will not experience any diffi

| culty in reaching the conclusion
that they are not and never can
be equal."
The current governor Paul
! Johnson operates well within this
tradition of political leadership.
Although in his inaugural, he re
minded the people that they were
"Americans as well as Mississip
pians," since that time he has
made comments to the effect that
the National Council of Churches
was an extremist group and that
"if an> blood is shed in this state,
it will be on their hands."
V. O. KEY HAS said of South
crn politics "the almost over
whelming temptation, especially
in areas with many Negroes, is
lo take advantage of the short-run
opportunity to maintain the sta
tus-quo by using the race issue
to blot up the discontents of the
lesser whites. By this means the
governing classes can kill off or
minimize pressures for improved
governmental services from
whites and find support for low
public outlays for the benefit of
the Negro."
For example, the House passed
a bill this year (100-13) which
would have ended urban renewal
in Mississippi except in the four
cities where projects are already
under construction. The .lackson
Clarion-Ledger stated "House sup
porters of the measure said the
federal government could use the
program to force racial integra-
I tion."
The dominant party within the
.stale, while calling itself Demo
cratic, has little allegiance to the
national party.
The state party platform of
1960 stated among other things
that "We believe in the separation
of the races in the universities and
colleges, in public playgrounds,
and in all spheres of activity
where experience has shown that
it is for the best interest of both

raccs that such separation be ob
served."
GOVERNOR Johnson's cam
paign literature proclaimed
proudly in the 1962 campaign
that, "Our Mississippi Democratic
Party is entirely independent and
is free of the influence or domina
tion of any national political
party, and"the truth is that
neither national party is 'conser
vative.' Both the National Repub

lican Party and Ihe National j
Democratic Party are the dedi
cated enemies of the people of
Mississippi. The national leaders 1
j of both consistently across thel
' years — have pursued courses of
| action which have moved our be
| loved country ever leftward
I which have threatened our citi
| zens with ever more centralized
I power at Washington."
I To a large degree, however, the

maintenence of segregation in the
South depends upon the continued
one party democracy. Professor
Otis Pease of the Stanford his
tory department, writes, "State-!
wide minority groups can seldom j
gain a toehold where no fairly
stable 'opposition party' exists.
Any group which wants to use
its small vote to win favors from
majority voters must make deals
with an organized party which

can deliver on its promises or can
be counted on because of its per
manence in the community. . . .
People who are economically and
socially 'in' have a stake in any
political system which discour
ages Ihe development of issues;
where issues are kept low, pres
ent control tends to flourish. . . .
One-party politics isolates the
bulk of voters from the important
emotional and educational forces
of national politics. The cold fact
is that genuine party contests are
vital to the political process, and
they do not usually arise within
states these days unless the state
is also a battleground for a na- j
tional party contest. National or
ganizations often act as galvan
izers for local leadership, and
most really crucial local issues
are now national issues."
PERHAPS LESS eloquently,
Mississippi Democratic cam
paign literature during the 1962
election staled, "These inexperi
ence d, so-called Republicans
proudly boast that 'they are not
bound by any deep-seated taboos
and prejudices handed d o w n 1
blindly from past generations,"
but they never discuss the real
dangers of a two-party political
system in a state like Mississippi
with a 'block-voting' minority
group that represents over 4.i per |
cent of our population."
This concept is elaborated in I
other literature which states "A
DIVISION OF CONSERVATIVE
MISSISSIPPI ANS INTO TWO
POLITICAL CAMPS, as now be
ing attempted by these self-styled
Republicans, WOULD GIVE THE
BALANCE OF POWER IN MIS
SISSIPPI TO OUR MINORITY
GROUP. This would be Ihe end
of our way of life in Mississippi

and the peace, tranquillity, law
and order we now enjoy in all of
our communities would soon
come 1o an awesome end."
At the present time, however,
Mississippi's minority group is
generally far removed from any
"balance of power." The denial
of the right to vote is a conscious
and deliberate practice by county
clerks and by the state legislature.
As a result, less than 10 per cent
of Negroes over 21 in the stale
are eligible to vote, and none hold
any state political office.
REGISTERING IN Mississippi
is a long and difficult process.
Under the constitution approved
in 1892 a person had to be able
to write any section of the Mis
sissippi Constitution, or under
stand any section when read to
him, or give a reasonable inter
pretation of any section.
Following a court ruling in
1961 which, it was felt, would en
able more Negroes to qualify, an
amendment was passed to the
1892 constitution and after fail
ing in 1952, was passed in 1954.
New qualifications in the
amendment included:


A GREENWOOD, Mississippi, policeman drags a
pregnant Negro woman to jail during a Free
dom Day demonstration. A white radio announc-

er reporting the arrests drawled, "And they
dumped that Nigger woman in the back of that
paddy wagon like a sack of potatoes."
First, a person must be able to
read, write and interpret any sec
tion of the constitution.
Second, a person must bo able
to demonstrate to the county reg
istrar a reasonable understand
ing of the duties and obligations
of citizenship.
Third, a person must make a
sworn written application for
registration, and fourth that all
persons registered before Janu
ary 1, 1954 were exempted from
the requirements.
A FURTHER amendment in
19(50 was approved by the voters.
It called for voters to be of good
moral character. However, neither
the amendment nor the statutes
passed in 1962 which directed its
enforcement, give any standards
of what determines good moral
character. Presumably the state's
white registrars are able to de
cide without the use of any legal
guidelines.
Other bills passed by the legis
lature provide that registration
records may be destroyed 30 days
after the filing of the application
form; that no application can be
approved if any blank on the
form is not "properly and respon
sibly" filled out by the applicant
(University of Mississippi Profes
sor Russell H. Barrett said of the
form, ". . . it does include a num
her of questions which must have
been intended as booby traps for
the person attempting to com
plete the form. . . . The questions
are not difficult, but many reason
ably intelligent people might find
them confusing.")
Further legislation requires
that a person applying must have
his name published once e a eh
week for two consecutive weeks,
in a local newspaper. Within 30
days after the application, any al
ready-qualified elector in th e
county may challenge in an affa
davit the good moral character
of the applicant. If there is no
challenge, the registrar must de
termine the qualifications of the
applicant "within a reasonable
time."
SHOULD THE applicant pass,

the registrar will write "passed"
on the application, and if the ap
plicant returns to the registrar
and asks for the result, he is reg
istered.
Should he fail t he registrar will
write "failed" on the application,
but he must not specify the rea
sons, for it "may constitute as
sistance to the applicant on an
other application." However if the
applicant fails only because of
poor moral character, the reg
istrar must specify the reasons
on the application form.
Following the pasage of the
24th amendment, additional legis
lation was passed with the intent
of further restricting Negro vot
ing in the state. The law states
that the poll tax shall not be re
quired in any federal election, but
that "any person who is subject to
the payment of poll tax may apply
to the tax collector. . . . The appli
cant shall furnish to the tax col
lector all information necessary.
. . . and the tax collector shall
issue the receipt as in cases where
the poll tax is paid, except that
he shall place the following notice
on the face of the original an''
duplicate receipt: 'Poll Tax Not
Paid.' "
COFO CLAIMS that "Because
only thirty days were allowed for
obtaining receipts of 'non-pay
ment' this year, and because the
'non-payment' provision received
almost no coverage in the Mis
sissippi press, many Negroes who
have recently registered in the
state were not aware of the pro
vision and it appeared that they
would therefore not be allowed
to vote in the elections this year,
including the June 2 primary."
Professor Barrett in a speech
delivered at a meeting of the Mis
sissippi Council on Human Re
lations made three general points
on the state's voting laws.
"First, the whole pattern of
voting requirements and of the
regisration form is calculated to
make the process appear to the
voter to be a hopelessly formid
able one. ... A second important
point is that the law provides no
clear or meaningful standards for

its highly general requirements.
. . . My third generalization is
that both of the previous points
are reinforced by the fact that
the enforcement of voting require
ments is left to one official —the
Circuit Clerk."
THERE IS ONE other method
which Negroes are kept from
participating in Mississippi poli
tics. the virtual exclusion of even
registered Negroes from activity
within the Democratic Party. Ac
cording to the Mississippi Free
dom Party, Negroes "are not
wanted as members of this party,
and arc not permitted to function
in the party's operation."
Although some progress has
been made in registering voters,
and the federal government has

been bringing suits to enforce the
civil rights laws (as evidenced b\
a bill proposed in the state sen
ate which would permit the fines
leveled against county clerks foi
violating the civil rights laws
of 1957 and 1960, to bo paid out
of state funds), the state and its
political institutions today re
mains one of the last and strong
est bastions of white supremacy

of the right to vote is a conscious
and deliberate practice by county
clerks and by the state legislature.
As a result, less than 10 per cent
of Negroes over 21 in the stale
are eligible to vote, and none hold
any state political office.
REGISTERING IN Mississippi
is a long and difficult process.
Under the constitution approved
in 1892 a person had to be able
to write any section of the Mis
sissippi Constitution, or under
stand any section when read to
him, or give a reasonable inter
pretation of any section.
Following a court ruling in
1961 which, it was felt, would en
able more Negroes to qualify, an
amendment was passed to the
1892 constitution and after fail
ing in 1952, was passed in 1954.
New qualifications in the
amendment included:


A GREENWOOD, Mississippi, policeman drags a
pregnant Negro woman to jail during a Free
dom Day demonstration. A white radio announc-

er reporting the arrests drawled, "And they
dumped that Nigger woman in the back of that
paddy wagon like a sack of potatoes."
First, a person must be able to
read, write and interpret any sec
tion of the constitution.
Second, a person must bo able
to demonstrate to the county reg
istrar a reasonable understand
ing of the duties and obligations
of citizenship.
Third, a person must make a
sworn written application for
registration, and fourth that all
persons registered before Janu
ary 1, 1954 were exempted from
the requirements.
A FURTHER amendment in
19(50 was approved by the voters.
It called for voters to be of good
moral character. However, neither
the amendment nor the statutes
passed in 1962 which directed its
enforcement, give any standards
of what determines good moral
character. Presumably the state's
white registrars are able to de
cide without the use of any legal
guidelines.
Other bills passed by the legis
lature provide that registration
records may be destroyed 30 days
after the filing of the application
form; that no application can be
approved if any blank on the
form is not "properly and respon
sibly" filled out by the applicant
(University of Mississippi Profes
sor Russell H. Barrett said of the
form, ". . . it does include a num
her of questions which must have
been intended as booby traps for
the person attempting to com
plete the form. . . . The questions
are not difficult, but many reason
ably intelligent people might find
them confusing.")
Further legislation requires
that a person applying must have
his name published once e a eh
week for two consecutive weeks,
in a local newspaper. Within 30
days after the application, any al
ready-qualified elector in th e
county may challenge in an affa
davit the good moral character
of the applicant. If there is no
challenge, the registrar must de
termine the qualifications of the
applicant "within a reasonable
time."
SHOULD THE applicant pass,

the registrar will write "passed"
on the application, and if the ap
plicant returns to the registrar
and asks for the result, he is reg
istered.
Should he fail t he registrar will
write "failed" on the application,
but he must not specify the rea
sons, for it "may constitute as
sistance to the applicant on an
other application." However if the
applicant fails only because of
poor moral character, the reg
istrar must specify the reasons
on the application form.
Following the pasage of the
24th amendment, additional legis
lation was passed with the intent
of further restricting Negro vot
ing in the state. The law states
that the poll tax shall not be re
quired in any federal election, but
that "any person who is subject to
the payment of poll tax may apply
to the tax collector. . . . The appli
cant shall furnish to the tax col
lector all information necessary.
. . . and the tax collector shall
issue the receipt as in cases where
the poll tax is paid, except that
he shall place the following notice
on the face of the original an''
duplicate receipt: 'Poll Tax Not
Paid.' "
COFO CLAIMS that "Because
only thirty days were allowed for
obtaining receipts of 'non-pay
ment' this year, and because the
'non-payment' provision received
almost no coverage in the Mis
sissippi press, many Negroes who
have recently registered in the
state were not aware of the pro
vision and it appeared that they
would therefore not be allowed
to vote in the elections this year,
including the June 2 primary."
Professor Barrett in a speech
delivered at a meeting of the Mis
sissippi Council on Human Re
lations made three general points
on the state's voting laws.
"First, the whole pattern of
voting requirements and of the
regisration form is calculated to
make the process appear to the
voter to be a hopelessly formid
able one. ... A second important
point is that the law provides no
clear or meaningful standards for

its highly general requirements.
. . . My third generalization is
that both of the previous points
are reinforced by the fact that
the enforcement of voting require
ments is left to one official —the
Circuit Clerk."
THERE IS ONE other method
which Negroes are kept from
participating in Mississippi poli
tics. the virtual exclusion of even
registered Negroes from activity
within the Democratic Party. Ac
cording to the Mississippi Free
dom Party, Negroes "are not
wanted as members of this party,
and arc not permitted to function
in the party's operation."
Although some progress has
been made in registering voters,
and the federal government has

been bringing suits to enforce the
civil rights laws (as evidenced b\
a bill proposed in the state sen
ate which would permit the fines
leveled against county clerks foi
violating the civil rights laws
of 1957 and 1960, to bo paid out
of state funds), the state and its
political institutions today re
mains one of the last and strong
est bastions of white supremacy
Mississippi boasts of pure white,
one parly polities. The governor,
the lieutenant governor and all
other stale politicians are both
white and Democrats. The state's
two senators and its five con
gressmen are white Democrats.
In the legislature all 49 senators
and 122 representatives are white,
though there is one Republican
representative.
THIS HAS BEEN the case in
the state since the end of Recon
struction in 1875, and since then,
the constitutional convention of
lS9ii, has virtually prevented all
Negroes from even voting.
From 1890 to the present, the
politics of ihe slate has produced
a series of white supremacy gov
enors and history of generally bad
government. James K. Vardaman,
governor from 1904 to 1908 felt
the Negro was "a lazy, lying, lust
ful animal which no conceivable
amount of training can transform
into a tolerable citizen." At th e
time of his election fewer than
2,000 Negroes were permitted to
vote.
Vardaman's greatest rival in
the field was Theodore G. Bilbo,
twice governor and a United
States senator. Bilbo believed
"if Hip blood of our white race
should become corrupted with
the glood of Africa, then the pres
ent greatness of the United States
of America would lie destroyed
and all hope for the future would
be forever gone." To Professor
James Silver, Bilbo is "sympto
matic of the chaos and bank
ruptcy of Mississippi's one-party
svstem."
' A MORE RECENT governor of
the state, Ross Barnett once
stated, "If we start off with the
self-evident proposition that the
whites and colored are different,
we will not experience any diffi

| culty in reaching the conclusion
that they are not and never can
be equal."
The current governor Paul
! Johnson operates well within this
tradition of political leadership.
Although in his inaugural, he re
minded the people that they were
"Americans as well as Mississip
pians," since that time he has
made comments to the effect that
the National Council of Churches
was an extremist group and that
"if an> blood is shed in this state,
it will be on their hands."
V. O. KEY HAS said of South
crn politics "the almost over
whelming temptation, especially
in areas with many Negroes, is
lo take advantage of the short-run
opportunity to maintain the sta
tus-quo by using the race issue
to blot up the discontents of the
lesser whites. By this means the
governing classes can kill off or
minimize pressures for improved
governmental services from
whites and find support for low
public outlays for the benefit of
the Negro."
For example, the House passed
a bill this year (100-13) which
would have ended urban renewal
in Mississippi except in the four
cities where projects are already
under construction. The .lackson
Clarion-Ledger stated "House sup
porters of the measure said the
federal government could use the
program to force racial integra-
I tion."
The dominant party within the
.stale, while calling itself Demo
cratic, has little allegiance to the
national party.
The state party platform of
1960 stated among other things
that "We believe in the separation
of the races in the universities and
colleges, in public playgrounds,
and in all spheres of activity
where experience has shown that
it is for the best interest of both

raccs that such separation be ob
served."
GOVERNOR Johnson's cam
paign literature proclaimed
proudly in the 1962 campaign
that, "Our Mississippi Democratic
Party is entirely independent and
is free of the influence or domina
tion of any national political
party, and"the truth is that
neither national party is 'conser
vative.' Both the National Repub

lican Party and Ihe National j
Democratic Party are the dedi
cated enemies of the people of
Mississippi. The national leaders 1
j of both consistently across thel
' years — have pursued courses of
| action which have moved our be
| loved country ever leftward
I which have threatened our citi
| zens with ever more centralized
I power at Washington."
I To a large degree, however, the

maintenence of segregation in the
South depends upon the continued
one party democracy. Professor
Otis Pease of the Stanford his
tory department, writes, "State-!
wide minority groups can seldom j
gain a toehold where no fairly
stable 'opposition party' exists.
Any group which wants to use
its small vote to win favors from
majority voters must make deals
with an organized party which

can deliver on its promises or can
be counted on because of its per
manence in the community. . . .
People who are economically and
socially 'in' have a stake in any
political system which discour
ages Ihe development of issues;
where issues are kept low, pres
ent control tends to flourish. . . .
One-party politics isolates the
bulk of voters from the important
emotional and educational forces
of national politics. The cold fact
is that genuine party contests are
vital to the political process, and
they do not usually arise within
states these days unless the state
is also a battleground for a na- j
tional party contest. National or
ganizations often act as galvan
izers for local leadership, and
most really crucial local issues
are now national issues."
PERHAPS LESS eloquently,
Mississippi Democratic cam
paign literature during the 1962
election staled, "These inexperi
ence d, so-called Republicans
proudly boast that 'they are not
bound by any deep-seated taboos
and prejudices handed d o w n 1
blindly from past generations,"
but they never discuss the real
dangers of a two-party political
system in a state like Mississippi
with a 'block-voting' minority
group that represents over 4.i per |
cent of our population."
This concept is elaborated in I
other literature which states "A
DIVISION OF CONSERVATIVE
MISSISSIPPI ANS INTO TWO
POLITICAL CAMPS, as now be
ing attempted by these self-styled
Republicans, WOULD GIVE THE
BALANCE OF POWER IN MIS
SISSIPPI TO OUR MINORITY
GROUP. This would be Ihe end
of our way of life in Mississippi

and the peace, tranquillity, law
and order we now enjoy in all of
our communities would soon
come 1o an awesome end."
At the present time, however,
Mississippi's minority group is
generally far removed from any
"balance of power." The denial
of the right to vote is a conscious
and deliberate practice by county
clerks and by the state legislature.
As a result, less than 10 per cent
of Negroes over 21 in the stale
are eligible to vote, and none hold
any state political office.

lS9ii, has virtually prevented all
Negroes from even voting.
From 1890 to the present, the
politics of ihe slate has produced
a series of white supremacy gov
enors and history of generally bad
government. James K. Vardaman,
governor from 1904 to 1908 felt
the Negro was "a lazy, lying, lust
ful animal which no conceivable
amount of training can transform
into a tolerable citizen." At th e
time of his election fewer than
2,000 Negroes were permitted to
vote.
Vardaman's greatest rival in
the field was Theodore G. Bilbo,
twice governor and a United
States senator. Bilbo believed
"if Hip blood of our white race
should become corrupted with
the glood of Africa, then the pres
ent greatness of the United States
of America would lie destroyed
and all hope for the future would
be forever gone." To Professor
James Silver, Bilbo is "sympto
matic of the chaos and bank
ruptcy of Mississippi's one-party
svstem."
' A MORE RECENT governor of
the state, Ross Barnett once
stated, "If we start off with the
self-evident proposition that the
whites and colored are different,
we will not experience any diffi

| culty in reaching the conclusion
that they are not and never can
be equal."
The current governor Paul
! Johnson operates well within this
tradition of political leadership.
Although in his inaugural, he re
minded the people that they were
"Americans as well as Mississip
pians," since that time he has
made comments to the effect that
the National Council of Churches
was an extremist group and that
"if an> blood is shed in this state,
it will be on their hands."
V. O. KEY HAS said of South
crn politics "the almost over
whelming temptation, especially
in areas with many Negroes, is
lo take advantage of the short-run
opportunity to maintain the sta
tus-quo by using the race issue
to blot up the discontents of the
lesser whites. By this means the
governing classes can kill off or
minimize pressures for improved
governmental services from
whites and find support for low
public outlays for the benefit of
the Negro."
For example, the House passed
a bill this year (100-13) which
would have ended urban renewal
in Mississippi except in the four
cities where projects are already
under construction. The .lackson
Clarion-Ledger stated "House sup
porters of the measure said the
federal government could use the
program to force racial integra-
I tion."
The dominant party within the
.stale, while calling itself Demo
cratic, has little allegiance to the
national party.
The state party platform of
1960 stated among other things
that "We believe in the separation
of the races in the universities and
colleges, in public playgrounds,
and in all spheres of activity
where experience has shown that
it is for the best interest of both

raccs that such separation be ob
served."
GOVERNOR Johnson's cam
paign literature proclaimed
proudly in the 1962 campaign
that, "Our Mississippi Democratic
Party is entirely independent and
is free of the influence or domina
tion of any national political
party, and"the truth is that
neither national party is 'conser
vative.' Both the National Repub

lican Party and Ihe National j
Democratic Party are the dedi
cated enemies of the people of
Mississippi. The national leaders 1
j of both consistently across thel
' years — have pursued courses of
| action which have moved our be
| loved country ever leftward
I which have threatened our citi
| zens with ever more centralized
I power at Washington."
I To a large degree, however, the

maintenence of segregation in the
South depends upon the continued
one party democracy. Professor
Otis Pease of the Stanford his
tory department, writes, "State-!
wide minority groups can seldom j
gain a toehold where no fairly
stable 'opposition party' exists.
Any group which wants to use
its small vote to win favors from
majority voters must make deals
with an organized party which

can deliver on its promises or can
be counted on because of its per
manence in the community. . . .
People who are economically and
socially 'in' have a stake in any
political system which discour
ages Ihe development of issues;
where issues are kept low, pres
ent control tends to flourish. . . .
One-party politics isolates the
bulk of voters from the important
emotional and educational forces
of national politics. The cold fact
is that genuine party contests are
vital to the political process, and
they do not usually arise within
states these days unless the state
is also a battleground for a na- j
tional party contest. National or
ganizations often act as galvan
izers for local leadership, and
most really crucial local issues
are now national issues."
PERHAPS LESS eloquently,
Mississippi Democratic cam
paign literature during the 1962
election staled, "These inexperi
ence d, so-called Republicans
proudly boast that 'they are not
bound by any deep-seated taboos
and prejudices handed d o w n 1
blindly from past generations,"
but they never discuss the real
dangers of a two-party political
system in a state like Mississippi
with a 'block-voting' minority
group that represents over 4.i per |
cent of our population."
This concept is elaborated in I
other literature which states "A
DIVISION OF CONSERVATIVE
MISSISSIPPI ANS INTO TWO
POLITICAL CAMPS, as now be
ing attempted by these self-styled
Republicans, WOULD GIVE THE
BALANCE OF POWER IN MIS
SISSIPPI TO OUR MINORITY
GROUP. This would be Ihe end
of our way of life in Mississippi

and the peace, tranquillity, law
and order we now enjoy in all of
our communities would soon
come 1o an awesome end."
At the present time, however,
Mississippi's minority group is
generally far removed from any
"balance of power." The denial
of the right to vote is a conscious
and deliberate practice by county
clerks and by the state legislature.
As a result, less than 10 per cent
of Negroes over 21 in the stale
are eligible to vote, and none hold
any state political office.
REGISTERING IN Mississippi
is a long and difficult process.
Under the constitution approved
in 1892 a person had to be able
to write any section of the Mis
sissippi Constitution, or under
stand any section when read to
him, or give a reasonable inter
pretation of any section.
Following a court ruling in
1961 which, it was felt, would en
able more Negroes to qualify, an
amendment was passed to the
1892 constitution and after fail
ing in 1952, was passed in 1954.
New qualifications in the
amendment included:


A GREENWOOD, Mississippi, policeman drags a
pregnant Negro woman to jail during a Free
dom Day demonstration. A white radio announc-

er reporting the arrests drawled, "And they
dumped that Nigger woman in the back of that
paddy wagon like a sack of potatoes."
First, a person must be able to
read, write and interpret any sec
tion of the constitution.
Second, a person must bo able
to demonstrate to the county reg
istrar a reasonable understand
ing of the duties and obligations
of citizenship.
Third, a person must make a
sworn written application for
registration, and fourth that all
persons registered before Janu
ary 1, 1954 were exempted from
the requirements.
A FURTHER amendment in
19(50 was approved by the voters.
It called for voters to be of good
moral character. However, neither
the amendment nor the statutes
passed in 1962 which directed its
enforcement, give any standards
of what determines good moral
character. Presumably the state's
white registrars are able to de
cide without the use of any legal
guidelines.
Other bills passed by the legis
lature provide that registration
records may be destroyed 30 days
after the filing of the application
form; that no application can be
approved if any blank on the
form is not "properly and respon
sibly" filled out by the applicant
(University of Mississippi Profes
sor Russell H. Barrett said of the
form, ". . . it does include a num
her of questions which must have
been intended as booby traps for
the person attempting to com
plete the form. . . . The questions
are not difficult, but many reason
ably intelligent people might find
them confusing.")
Further legislation requires
that a person applying must have
his name published once e a eh
week for two consecutive weeks,
in a local newspaper. Within 30
days after the application, any al
ready-qualified elector in th e
county may challenge in an affa
davit the good moral character
of the applicant. If there is no
challenge, the registrar must de
termine the qualifications of the
applicant "within a reasonable
time."
SHOULD THE applicant pass,

the registrar will write "passed"
on the application, and if the ap
plicant returns to the registrar
and asks for the result, he is reg
istered.
Should he fail t he registrar will
write "failed" on the application,
but he must not specify the rea
sons, for it "may constitute as
sistance to the applicant on an
other application." However if the
applicant fails only because of
poor moral character, the reg
istrar must specify the reasons
on the application form.
Following the pasage of the
24th amendment, additional legis
lation was passed with the intent
of further restricting Negro vot
ing in the state. The law states
that the poll tax shall not be re
quired in any federal election, but
that "any person who is subject to
the payment of poll tax may apply
to the tax collector. . . . The appli
cant shall furnish to the tax col
lector all information necessary.
. . . and the tax collector shall
issue the receipt as in cases where
the poll tax is paid, except that
he shall place the following notice
on the face of the original an''
duplicate receipt: 'Poll Tax Not
Paid.' "
COFO CLAIMS that "Because
only thirty days were allowed for
obtaining receipts of 'non-pay
ment' this year, and because the
'non-payment' provision received
almost no coverage in the Mis
sissippi press, many Negroes who
have recently registered in the
state were not aware of the pro
vision and it appeared that they
would therefore not be allowed
to vote in the elections this year,
including the June 2 primary."
Professor Barrett in a speech
delivered at a meeting of the Mis
sissippi Council on Human Re
lations made three general points
on the state's voting laws.
"First, the whole pattern of
voting requirements and of the
regisration form is calculated to
make the process appear to the
voter to be a hopelessly formid
able one. ... A second important
point is that the law provides no
clear or meaningful standards for

its highly general requirements.
. . . My third generalization is
that both of the previous points
are reinforced by the fact that
the enforcement of voting require
ments is left to one official —the
Circuit Clerk."
THERE IS ONE other method
which Negroes are kept from
participating in Mississippi poli
tics. the virtual exclusion of even
registered Negroes from activity
within the Democratic Party. Ac
cording to the Mississippi Free
dom Party, Negroes "are not
wanted as members of this party,
and arc not permitted to function
in the party's operation."
Although some progress has
been made in registering voters,
and the federal government has

been bringing suits to enforce the
civil rights laws (as evidenced b\
a bill proposed in the state sen
ate which would permit the fines
leveled against county clerks foi
violating the civil rights laws
of 1957 and 1960, to bo paid out
of state funds), the state and its
political institutions today re
mains one of the last and strong
est bastions of white supremacy
Mississippi boasts of pure white,
one parly polities. The governor,
the lieutenant governor and all
other stale politicians are both
white and Democrats. The state's
two senators and its five con
gressmen are white Democrats.
In the legislature all 49 senators
and 122 representatives are white,
though there is one Republican
representative.
THIS HAS BEEN the case in
the state since the end of Recon
struction in 1875, and since then,
the constitutional convention of
lS9ii, has virtually prevented all
Negroes from even voting.
From 1890 to the present, the
politics of ihe slate has produced
a series of white supremacy gov
enors and history of generally bad

ful animal which no conceivable
amount of training can transform

Vardaman's greatest rival in
the field was Theodore G. Bilbo,
twice governor and a United

"if Hip blood of our white race
should become corrupted with
the glood of Africa, then the pres
ent greatness of the United States
of America would lie destroyed
and all hope for the future would
be forever gone." To Professor
James Silver, Bilbo is "sympto
matic of the chaos and bank
ruptcy of Mississippi's one-party
svstem."

pretation of any section.
Following a court ruling in
1961 which, it was felt, would en
able more Negroes to qualify, an
amendment was passed to the
1892 constitution and after fail
ing in 1952, was passed in 1954.
New qualifications in the
amendment included:


A GREENWOOD, Mississippi, policeman drags a
pregnant Negro woman to jail during a Free
dom Day demonstration. A white radio announc-

er reporting the arrests drawled, "And they
dumped that Nigger woman in the back of that
paddy wagon like a sack of potatoes."
First, a person must be able to
read, write and interpret any sec
tion of the constitution.
Second, a person must bo able
to demonstrate to the county reg
istrar a reasonable understand
ing of the duties and obligations
of citizenship.
Third, a person must make a
sworn written application for
registration, and fourth that all
persons registered before Janu
ary 1, 1954 were exempted from
the requirements.
A FURTHER amendment in
19(50 was approved by the voters.
It called for voters to be of good
moral character. However, neither
the amendment nor the statutes
passed in 1962 which directed its
enforcement, give any standards
of what determines good moral
character. Presumably the state's
white registrars are able to de
cide without the use of any legal
guidelines.
Other bills passed by the legis
lature provide that registration
records may be destroyed 30 days
after the filing of the application
form; that no application can be
approved if any blank on the
form is not "properly and respon
sibly" filled out by the applicant
(University of Mississippi Profes
sor Russell H. Barrett said of the
form, ". . . it does include a num
her of questions which must have
been intended as booby traps for
the person attempting to com
plete the form. . . . The questions
are not difficult, but many reason
ably intelligent people might find
them confusing.")
Further legislation requires
that a person applying must have
his name published once e a eh
week for two consecutive weeks,
in a local newspaper. Within 30
days after the application, any al
ready-qualified elector in th e
county may challenge in an affa
davit the good moral character
of the applicant. If there is no
challenge, the registrar must de
termine the qualifications of the
applicant "within a reasonable
time."
SHOULD THE applicant pass,

the registrar will write "passed"
on the application, and if the ap
plicant returns to the registrar
and asks for the result, he is reg
istered.
Should he fail t he registrar will
write "failed" on the application,
but he must not specify the rea
sons, for it "may constitute as
sistance to the applicant on an
other application." However if the
applicant fails only because of
poor moral character, the reg
istrar must specify the reasons
on the application form.
Following the pasage of the
24th amendment, additional legis
lation was passed with the intent
of further restricting Negro vot
ing in the state. The law states
that the poll tax shall not be re
quired in any federal election, but
that "any person who is subject to
the payment of poll tax may apply
to the tax collector. . . . The appli
cant shall furnish to the tax col
lector all information necessary.
. . . and the tax collector shall
issue the receipt as in cases where
the poll tax is paid, except that
he shall place the following notice
on the face of the original an''
duplicate receipt: 'Poll Tax Not
Paid.' "
COFO CLAIMS that "Because
only thirty days were allowed for
obtaining receipts of 'non-pay
ment' this year, and because the
'non-payment' provision received
almost no coverage in the Mis
sissippi press, many Negroes who
have recently registered in the
state were not aware of the pro
vision and it appeared that they
would therefore not be allowed
to vote in the elections this year,
including the June 2 primary."
Professor Barrett in a speech
delivered at a meeting of the Mis
sissippi Council on Human Re
lations made three general points
on the state's voting laws.
"First, the whole pattern of
voting requirements and of the
regisration form is calculated to
make the process appear to the
voter to be a hopelessly formid
able one. ... A second important
point is that the law provides no
clear or meaningful standards for

its highly general requirements.
. . . My third generalization is
that both of the previous points
are reinforced by the fact that
the enforcement of voting require
ments is left to one official —the
Circuit Clerk."
THERE IS ONE other method
which Negroes are kept from
participating in Mississippi poli
tics. the virtual exclusion of even
registered Negroes from activity
within the Democratic Party. Ac
cording to the Mississippi Free
dom Party, Negroes "are not
wanted as members of this party,
and arc not permitted to function
in the party's operation."
Although some progress has
been made in registering voters,
and the federal government has

been bringing suits to enforce the
civil rights laws (as evidenced b\
a bill proposed in the state sen
ate which would permit the fines
leveled against county clerks foi
violating the civil rights laws
of 1957 and 1960, to bo paid out
of state funds), the state and its
political institutions today re
mains one of the last and strong
est bastions of white supremacy
Mississippi boasts of pure white,
one parly polities. The governor,
the lieutenant governor and all
other stale politicians are both
white and Democrats. The state's
two senators and its five con
gressmen are white Democrats.
In the legislature all 49 senators
and 122 representatives are white,
though there is one Republican
representative.
THIS HAS BEEN the case in
the state since the end of Recon
struction in 1875, and since then,
the constitutional convention of
lS9ii, has virtually prevented all
Negroes from even voting.
From 1890 to the present, the
politics of ihe slate has produced
a series of white supremacy gov
enors and history of generally bad
government. James K. Vardaman,
governor from 1904 to 1908 felt
the Negro was "a lazy, lying, lust
ful animal which no conceivable
amount of training can transform
into a tolerable citizen." At th e
time of his election fewer than
2,000 Negroes were permitted to
vote.
Vardaman's greatest rival in
the field was Theodore G. Bilbo,
twice governor and a United
States senator. Bilbo believed
"if Hip blood of our white race
should become corrupted with
the glood of Africa, then the pres
ent greatness of the United States
of America would lie destroyed
and all hope for the future would
be forever gone." To Professor
James Silver, Bilbo is "sympto
matic of the chaos and bank
ruptcy of Mississippi's one-party
svstem."
' A MORE RECENT governor of
the state, Ross Barnett once
stated, "If we start off with the
self-evident proposition that the
whites and colored are different,
we will not experience any diffi

| culty in reaching the conclusion
that they are not and never can
be equal."
The current governor Paul
! Johnson operates well within this
tradition of political leadership.
Although in his inaugural, he re
minded the people that they were
"Americans as well as Mississip
pians," since that time he has
made comments to the effect that
the National Council of Churches
was an extremist group and that
"if an> blood is shed in this state,
it will be on their hands."
V. O. KEY HAS said of South
crn politics "the almost over
whelming temptation, especially
in areas with many Negroes, is
lo take advantage of the short-run
opportunity to maintain the sta
tus-quo by using the race issue
to blot up the discontents of the
lesser whites. By this means the
governing classes can kill off or
minimize pressures for improved
governmental services from
whites and find support for low
public outlays for the benefit of
the Negro."
For example, the House passed
a bill this year (100-13) which
would have ended urban renewal
in Mississippi except in the four
cities where projects are already
under construction. The .lackson
Clarion-Ledger stated "House sup
porters of the measure said the
federal government could use the
program to force racial integra-
I tion."
The dominant party within the
.stale, while calling itself Demo
cratic, has little allegiance to the
national party.
The state party platform of
1960 stated among other things
that "We believe in the separation
of the races in the universities and
colleges, in public playgrounds,
and in all spheres of activity
where experience has shown that
it is for the best interest of both

raccs that such separation be ob
served."
GOVERNOR Johnson's cam
paign literature proclaimed
proudly in the 1962 campaign
that, "Our Mississippi Democratic
Party is entirely independent and
is free of the influence or domina
tion of any national political
party, and"the truth is that
neither national party is 'conser
vative.' Both the National Repub

lican Party and Ihe National j
Democratic Party are the dedi
cated enemies of the people of
Mississippi. The national leaders 1
j of both consistently across thel
' years — have pursued courses of
| action which have moved our be
| loved country ever leftward
I which have threatened our citi
| zens with ever more centralized
I power at Washington."
I To a large degree, however, the

maintenence of segregation in the
South depends upon the continued
one party democracy. Professor
Otis Pease of the Stanford his
tory department, writes, "State-!
wide minority groups can seldom j
gain a toehold where no fairly
stable 'opposition party' exists.
Any group which wants to use
its small vote to win favors from
majority voters must make deals
with an organized party which

can deliver on its promises or can
be counted on because of its per
manence in the community. . . .
People who are economically and
socially 'in' have a stake in any
political system which discour
ages Ihe development of issues;
where issues are kept low, pres
ent control tends to flourish. . . .
One-party politics isolates the
bulk of voters from the important
emotional and educational forces
of national politics. The cold fact
is that genuine party contests are
vital to the political process, and
they do not usually arise within
states these days unless the state
is also a battleground for a na- j
tional party contest. National or
ganizations often act as galvan
izers for local leadership, and
most really crucial local issues
are now national issues."
PERHAPS LESS eloquently,
Mississippi Democratic cam
paign literature during the 1962
election staled, "These inexperi
ence d, so-called Republicans
proudly boast that 'they are not
bound by any deep-seated taboos
and prejudices handed d o w n 1
blindly from past generations,"
but they never discuss the real
dangers of a two-party political
system in a state like Mississippi
with a 'block-voting' minority
group that represents over 4.i per |
cent of our population."
This concept is elaborated in I
other literature which states "A
DIVISION OF CONSERVATIVE
MISSISSIPPI ANS INTO TWO
POLITICAL CAMPS, as now be
ing attempted by these self-styled
Republicans, WOULD GIVE THE
BALANCE OF POWER IN MIS
SISSIPPI TO OUR MINORITY
GROUP. This would be Ihe end
of our way of life in Mississippi

and the peace, tranquillity, law
and order we now enjoy in all of
our communities would soon
come 1o an awesome end."
At the present time, however,
Mississippi's minority group is
generally far removed from any
"balance of power." The denial
of the right to vote is a conscious
and deliberate practice by county
clerks and by the state legislature.
As a result, less than 10 per cent
of Negroes over 21 in the stale
are eligible to vote, and none hold
any state political office.
REGISTERING IN Mississippi
is a long and difficult process.
Under the constitution approved
in 1892 a person had to be able
to write any section of the Mis
sissippi Constitution, or under
stand any section when read to
him, or give a reasonable inter
pretation of any section.

vote.
Vardaman's greatest rival in
the field was Theodore G. Bilbo,
twice governor and a United
States senator. Bilbo believed
"if Hip blood of our white race
should become corrupted with
the glood of Africa, then the pres
ent greatness of the United States
of America would lie destroyed
and all hope for the future would
be forever gone." To Professor
James Silver, Bilbo is "sympto
matic of the chaos and bank
ruptcy of Mississippi's one-party
svstem."
' A MORE RECENT governor of
the state, Ross Barnett once
stated, "If we start off with the
self-evident proposition that the
whites and colored are different,
we will not experience any diffi

| culty in reaching the conclusion
that they are not and never can
be equal."
The current governor Paul
! Johnson operates well within this
tradition of political leadership.
Although in his inaugural, he re
minded the people that they were
"Americans as well as Mississip
pians," since that time he has
made comments to the effect that
the National Council of Churches
was an extremist group and that
"if an> blood is shed in this state,
it will be on their hands."
V. O. KEY HAS said of South
crn politics "the almost over
whelming temptation, especially
in areas with many Negroes, is
lo take advantage of the short-run
opportunity to maintain the sta
tus-quo by using the race issue
to blot up the discontents of the
lesser whites. By this means the
governing classes can kill off or
minimize pressures for improved
governmental services from
whites and find support for low
public outlays for the benefit of
the Negro."
For example, the House passed
a bill this year (100-13) which
would have ended urban renewal
in Mississippi except in the four
cities where projects are already
under construction. The .lackson
Clarion-Ledger stated "House sup
porters of the measure said the
federal government could use the
program to force racial integra-
I tion."
The dominant party within the
.stale, while calling itself Demo
cratic, has little allegiance to the
national party.
The state party platform of
1960 stated among other things
that "We believe in the separation
of the races in the universities and
colleges, in public playgrounds,
and in all spheres of activity
where experience has shown that
it is for the best interest of both

raccs that such separation be ob
served."
GOVERNOR Johnson's cam
paign literature proclaimed
proudly in the 1962 campaign
that, "Our Mississippi Democratic
Party is entirely independent and
is free of the influence or domina
tion of any national political
party, and"the truth is that
neither national party is 'conser
vative.' Both the National Repub

lican Party and Ihe National j
Democratic Party are the dedi
cated enemies of the people of
Mississippi. The national leaders 1
j of both consistently across thel
' years — have pursued courses of
| action which have moved our be
| loved country ever leftward
I which have threatened our citi
| zens with ever more centralized
I power at Washington."
I To a large degree, however, the

maintenence of segregation in the
South depends upon the continued
one party democracy. Professor
Otis Pease of the Stanford his
tory department, writes, "State-!
wide minority groups can seldom j
gain a toehold where no fairly
stable 'opposition party' exists.
Any group which wants to use
its small vote to win favors from
majority voters must make deals
with an organized party which

can deliver on its promises or can
be counted on because of its per
manence in the community. . . .
People who are economically and
socially 'in' have a stake in any
political system which discour
ages Ihe development of issues;
where issues are kept low, pres
ent control tends to flourish. . . .
One-party politics isolates the
bulk of voters from the important
emotional and educational forces
of national politics. The cold fact
is that genuine party contests are
vital to the political process, and
they do not usually arise within
states these days unless the state
is also a battleground for a na- j
tional party contest. National or
ganizations often act as galvan
izers for local leadership, and
most really crucial local issues
are now national issues."
PERHAPS LESS eloquently,
Mississippi Democratic cam
paign literature during the 1962
election staled, "These inexperi
ence d, so-called Republicans
proudly boast that 'they are not
bound by any deep-seated taboos
and prejudices handed d o w n 1
blindly from past generations,"
but they never discuss the real
dangers of a two-party political
system in a state like Mississippi
with a 'block-voting' minority
group that represents over 4.i per |
cent of our population."
This concept is elaborated in I
other literature which states "A
DIVISION OF CONSERVATIVE
MISSISSIPPI ANS INTO TWO
POLITICAL CAMPS, as now be
ing attempted by these self-styled
Republicans, WOULD GIVE THE
BALANCE OF POWER IN MIS
SISSIPPI TO OUR MINORITY
GROUP. This would be Ihe end
of our way of life in Mississippi

and the peace, tranquillity, law
and order we now enjoy in all of
our communities would soon
come 1o an awesome end."
At the present time, however,
Mississippi's minority group is
generally far removed from any
"balance of power." The denial
of the right to vote is a conscious
and deliberate practice by county
clerks and by the state legislature.
As a result, less than 10 per cent
of Negroes over 21 in the stale
are eligible to vote, and none hold
any state political office.
REGISTERING IN Mississippi
is a long and difficult process.
Under the constitution approved
in 1892 a person had to be able
to write any section of the Mis
sissippi Constitution, or under
stand any section when read to
him, or give a reasonable inter
pretation of any section.
Following a court ruling in
1961 which, it was felt, would en
able more Negroes to qualify, an
amendment was passed to the
1892 constitution and after fail
ing in 1952, was passed in 1954.
New qualifications in the
amendment included:


A GREENWOOD, Mississippi, policeman drags a
pregnant Negro woman to jail during a Free
dom Day demonstration. A white radio announc-

er reporting the arrests drawled, "And they
dumped that Nigger woman in the back of that
paddy wagon like a sack of potatoes."
First, a person must be able to
read, write and interpret any sec
tion of the constitution.
Second, a person must bo able
to demonstrate to the county reg
istrar a reasonable understand
ing of the duties and obligations
of citizenship.
Third, a person must make a
sworn written application for
registration, and fourth that all
persons registered before Janu
ary 1, 1954 were exempted from
the requirements.
A FURTHER amendment in
19(50 was approved by the voters.
It called for voters to be of good
moral character. However, neither
the amendment nor the statutes
passed in 1962 which directed its
enforcement, give any standards
of what determines good moral
character. Presumably the state's
white registrars are able to de
cide without the use of any legal
guidelines.
Other bills passed by the legis
lature provide that registration
records may be destroyed 30 days
after the filing of the application
form; that no application can be
approved if any blank on the
form is not "properly and respon
sibly" filled out by the applicant
(University of Mississippi Profes
sor Russell H. Barrett said of the
form, ". . . it does include a num
her of questions which must have
been intended as booby traps for
the person attempting to com
plete the form. . . . The questions
are not difficult, but many reason
ably intelligent people might find
them confusing.")
Further legislation requires
that a person applying must have
his name published once e a eh
week for two consecutive weeks,
in a local newspaper. Within 30
days after the application, any al
ready-qualified elector in th e
county may challenge in an affa
davit the good moral character
of the applicant. If there is no
challenge, the registrar must de
termine the qualifications of the
applicant "within a reasonable
time."
SHOULD THE applicant pass,

the registrar will write "passed"
on the application, and if the ap
plicant returns to the registrar
and asks for the result, he is reg
istered.
Should he fail t he registrar will
write "failed" on the application,
but he must not specify the rea
sons, for it "may constitute as
sistance to the applicant on an
other application." However if the
applicant fails only because of
poor moral character, the reg
istrar must specify the reasons
on the application form.
Following the pasage of the
24th amendment, additional legis
lation was passed with the intent
of further restricting Negro vot
ing in the state. The law states
that the poll tax shall not be re
quired in any federal election, but
that "any person who is subject to
the payment of poll tax may apply
to the tax collector. . . . The appli
cant shall furnish to the tax col
lector all information necessary.
. . . and the tax collector shall
issue the receipt as in cases where
the poll tax is paid, except that
he shall place the following notice
on the face of the original an''
duplicate receipt: 'Poll Tax Not
Paid.' "
COFO CLAIMS that "Because
only thirty days were allowed for
obtaining receipts of 'non-pay
ment' this year, and because the
'non-payment' provision received
almost no coverage in the Mis
sissippi press, many Negroes who
have recently registered in the
state were not aware of the pro
vision and it appeared that they
would therefore not be allowed
to vote in the elections this year,
including the June 2 primary."
Professor Barrett in a speech
delivered at a meeting of the Mis
sissippi Council on Human Re
lations made three general points
on the state's voting laws.
"First, the whole pattern of
voting requirements and of the
regisration form is calculated to
make the process appear to the
voter to be a hopelessly formid
able one. ... A second important
point is that the law provides no
clear or meaningful standards for

its highly general requirements.
. . . My third generalization is
that both of the previous points
are reinforced by the fact that
the enforcement of voting require
ments is left to one official —the
Circuit Clerk."
THERE IS ONE other method
which Negroes are kept from
participating in Mississippi poli
tics. the virtual exclusion of even
registered Negroes from activity
within the Democratic Party. Ac
cording to the Mississippi Free
dom Party, Negroes "are not
wanted as members of this party,
and arc not permitted to function
in the party's operation."
Although some progress has
been made in registering voters,
and the federal government has

been bringing suits to enforce the
civil rights laws (as evidenced b\
a bill proposed in the state sen
ate which would permit the fines
leveled against county clerks foi
violating the civil rights laws
of 1957 and 1960, to bo paid out
of state funds), the state and its
political institutions today re
mains one of the last and strong
est bastions of white supremacy
Mississippi boasts of pure white,
one parly polities. The governor,
the lieutenant governor and all
other stale politicians are both
white and Democrats. The state's
two senators and its five con
gressmen are white Democrats.
In the legislature all 49 senators
and 122 representatives are white,
though there is one Republican
representative.
THIS HAS BEEN the case in
the state since the end of Recon
struction in 1875, and since then,
the constitutional convention of
lS9ii, has virtually prevented all
Negroes from even voting.
From 1890 to the present, the
politics of ihe slate has produced
a series of white supremacy gov
enors and history of generally bad
government. James K. Vardaman,
governor from 1904 to 1908 felt
the Negro was "a lazy, lying, lust
ful animal which no conceivable
amount of training can transform
into a tolerable citizen." At th e
time of his election fewer than
2,000 Negroes were permitted to
vote.
Vardaman's greatest rival in
the field was Theodore G. Bilbo,
twice governor and a United
States senator. Bilbo believed
"if Hip blood of our white race
should become corrupted with
the glood of Africa, then the pres
ent greatness of the United States
of America would lie destroyed
and all hope for the future would
be forever gone." To Professor
James Silver, Bilbo is "sympto
matic of the chaos and bank
ruptcy of Mississippi's one-party
svstem."
' A MORE RECENT governor of
the state, Ross Barnett once
stated, "If we start off with the
self-evident proposition that the
whites and colored are different,
we will not experience any diffi

| culty in reaching the conclusion
that they are not and never can
be equal."
The current governor Paul

tradition of political leadership.
Although in his inaugural, he re
minded the people that they were
"Americans as well as Mississip
pians," since that time he has

First, a person must be able to
read, write and interpret any sec
tion of the constitution.
Second, a person must bo able
to demonstrate to the county reg
istrar a reasonable understand
ing of the duties and obligations
of citizenship.
Third, a person must make a
sworn written application for
registration, and fourth that all
persons registered before Janu
ary 1, 1954 were exempted from
the requirements.
A FURTHER amendment in
19(50 was approved by the voters.
It called for voters to be of good
moral character. However, neither
the amendment nor the statutes
passed in 1962 which directed its
enforcement, give any standards
of what determines good moral
character. Presumably the state's
white registrars are able to de
cide without the use of any legal
guidelines.
Other bills passed by the legis
lature provide that registration
records may be destroyed 30 days
after the filing of the application
form; that no application can be
approved if any blank on the
form is not "properly and respon
sibly" filled out by the applicant
(University of Mississippi Profes
sor Russell H. Barrett said of the
form, ". . . it does include a num
her of questions which must have
been intended as booby traps for
the person attempting to com
plete the form. . . . The questions
are not difficult, but many reason
ably intelligent people might find
them confusing.")
Further legislation requires
that a person applying must have
his name published once e a eh
week for two consecutive weeks,
in a local newspaper. Within 30
days after the application, any al
ready-qualified elector in th e
county may challenge in an affa
davit the good moral character
of the applicant. If there is no
challenge, the registrar must de
termine the qualifications of the
applicant "within a reasonable
time."
SHOULD THE applicant pass,

the registrar will write "passed"
on the application, and if the ap
plicant returns to the registrar
and asks for the result, he is reg
istered.
Should he fail t he registrar will
write "failed" on the application,
but he must not specify the rea
sons, for it "may constitute as
sistance to the applicant on an
other application." However if the
applicant fails only because of
poor moral character, the reg
istrar must specify the reasons
on the application form.
Following the pasage of the
24th amendment, additional legis
lation was passed with the intent
of further restricting Negro vot
ing in the state. The law states
that the poll tax shall not be re
quired in any federal election, but
that "any person who is subject to
the payment of poll tax may apply
to the tax collector. . . . The appli
cant shall furnish to the tax col
lector all information necessary.
. . . and the tax collector shall
issue the receipt as in cases where
the poll tax is paid, except that
he shall place the following notice
on the face of the original an''
duplicate receipt: 'Poll Tax Not
Paid.' "
COFO CLAIMS that "Because
only thirty days were allowed for
obtaining receipts of 'non-pay
ment' this year, and because the
'non-payment' provision received
almost no coverage in the Mis
sissippi press, many Negroes who
have recently registered in the
state were not aware of the pro
vision and it appeared that they
would therefore not be allowed
to vote in the elections this year,
including the June 2 primary."
Professor Barrett in a speech
delivered at a meeting of the Mis
sissippi Council on Human Re
lations made three general points
on the state's voting laws.
"First, the whole pattern of
voting requirements and of the
regisration form is calculated to
make the process appear to the
voter to be a hopelessly formid
able one. ... A second important
point is that the law provides no
clear or meaningful standards for

its highly general requirements.
. . . My third generalization is
that both of the previous points
are reinforced by the fact that
the enforcement of voting require
ments is left to one official —the
Circuit Clerk."
THERE IS ONE other method
which Negroes are kept from
participating in Mississippi poli
tics. the virtual exclusion of even
registered Negroes from activity
within the Democratic Party. Ac
cording to the Mississippi Free
dom Party, Negroes "are not
wanted as members of this party,
and arc not permitted to function
in the party's operation."
Although some progress has
been made in registering voters,
and the federal government has

been bringing suits to enforce the
civil rights laws (as evidenced b\
a bill proposed in the state sen
ate which would permit the fines
leveled against county clerks foi
violating the civil rights laws
of 1957 and 1960, to bo paid out
of state funds), the state and its
political institutions today re
mains one of the last and strong
est bastions of white supremacy
Mississippi boasts of pure white,
one parly polities. The governor,
the lieutenant governor and all
other stale politicians are both
white and Democrats. The state's
two senators and its five con
gressmen are white Democrats.
In the legislature all 49 senators
and 122 representatives are white,
though there is one Republican
representative.
THIS HAS BEEN the case in
the state since the end of Recon
struction in 1875, and since then,
the constitutional convention of
lS9ii, has virtually prevented all
Negroes from even voting.
From 1890 to the present, the
politics of ihe slate has produced
a series of white supremacy gov
enors and history of generally bad
government. James K. Vardaman,
governor from 1904 to 1908 felt
the Negro was "a lazy, lying, lust
ful animal which no conceivable
amount of training can transform
into a tolerable citizen." At th e
time of his election fewer than
2,000 Negroes were permitted to
vote.
Vardaman's greatest rival in
the field was Theodore G. Bilbo,
twice governor and a United
States senator. Bilbo believed
"if Hip blood of our white race
should become corrupted with
the glood of Africa, then the pres
ent greatness of the United States
of America would lie destroyed
and all hope for the future would
be forever gone." To Professor
James Silver, Bilbo is "sympto
matic of the chaos and bank
ruptcy of Mississippi's one-party
svstem."
' A MORE RECENT governor of
the state, Ross Barnett once
stated, "If we start off with the
self-evident proposition that the
whites and colored are different,
we will not experience any diffi

| culty in reaching the conclusion
that they are not and never can
be equal."
The current governor Paul
! Johnson operates well within this
tradition of political leadership.
Although in his inaugural, he re
minded the people that they were
"Americans as well as Mississip
pians," since that time he has
made comments to the effect that
the National Council of Churches
was an extremist group and that
"if an> blood is shed in this state,
it will be on their hands."
V. O. KEY HAS said of South
crn politics "the almost over
whelming temptation, especially
in areas with many Negroes, is
lo take advantage of the short-run
opportunity to maintain the sta
tus-quo by using the race issue
to blot up the discontents of the
lesser whites. By this means the
governing classes can kill off or
minimize pressures for improved
governmental services from
whites and find support for low
public outlays for the benefit of
the Negro."
For example, the House passed
a bill this year (100-13) which
would have ended urban renewal
in Mississippi except in the four
cities where projects are already
under construction. The .lackson
Clarion-Ledger stated "House sup
porters of the measure said the
federal government could use the
program to force racial integra-
I tion."
The dominant party within the
.stale, while calling itself Demo
cratic, has little allegiance to the
national party.
The state party platform of
1960 stated among other things
that "We believe in the separation
of the races in the universities and
colleges, in public playgrounds,
and in all spheres of activity
where experience has shown that
it is for the best interest of both

raccs that such separation be ob
served."
GOVERNOR Johnson's cam
paign literature proclaimed
proudly in the 1962 campaign
that, "Our Mississippi Democratic
Party is entirely independent and
is free of the influence or domina
tion of any national political
party, and"the truth is that
neither national party is 'conser
vative.' Both the National Repub

lican Party and Ihe National j
Democratic Party are the dedi
cated enemies of the people of
Mississippi. The national leaders 1
j of both consistently across thel
' years — have pursued courses of
| action which have moved our be
| loved country ever leftward
I which have threatened our citi
| zens with ever more centralized
I power at Washington."
I To a large degree, however, the

maintenence of segregation in the
South depends upon the continued
one party democracy. Professor
Otis Pease of the Stanford his
tory department, writes, "State-!
wide minority groups can seldom j
gain a toehold where no fairly
stable 'opposition party' exists.
Any group which wants to use
its small vote to win favors from
majority voters must make deals
with an organized party which

can deliver on its promises or can
be counted on because of its per
manence in the community. . . .
People who are economically and
socially 'in' have a stake in any
political system which discour
ages Ihe development of issues;
where issues are kept low, pres
ent control tends to flourish. . . .
One-party politics isolates the
bulk of voters from the important
emotional and educational forces
of national politics. The cold fact
is that genuine party contests are
vital to the political process, and
they do not usually arise within
states these days unless the state
is also a battleground for a na- j
tional party contest. National or
ganizations often act as galvan
izers for local leadership, and
most really crucial local issues
are now national issues."
PERHAPS LESS eloquently,
Mississippi Democratic cam
paign literature during the 1962
election staled, "These inexperi
ence d, so-called Republicans
proudly boast that 'they are not
bound by any deep-seated taboos
and prejudices handed d o w n 1
blindly from past generations,"
but they never discuss the real
dangers of a two-party political
system in a state like Mississippi
with a 'block-voting' minority
group that represents over 4.i per |
cent of our population."
This concept is elaborated in I
other literature which states "A
DIVISION OF CONSERVATIVE
MISSISSIPPI ANS INTO TWO
POLITICAL CAMPS, as now be
ing attempted by these self-styled
Republicans, WOULD GIVE THE
BALANCE OF POWER IN MIS
SISSIPPI TO OUR MINORITY
GROUP. This would be Ihe end
of our way of life in Mississippi

and the peace, tranquillity, law
and order we now enjoy in all of
our communities would soon
come 1o an awesome end."
At the present time, however,
Mississippi's minority group is
generally far removed from any
"balance of power." The denial
of the right to vote is a conscious
and deliberate practice by county
clerks and by the state legislature.
As a result, less than 10 per cent
of Negroes over 21 in the stale
are eligible to vote, and none hold
any state political office.
REGISTERING IN Mississippi
is a long and difficult process.
Under the constitution approved
in 1892 a person had to be able
to write any section of the Mis
sissippi Constitution, or under
stand any section when read to
him, or give a reasonable inter
pretation of any section.
Following a court ruling in
1961 which, it was felt, would en
able more Negroes to qualify, an
amendment was passed to the
1892 constitution and after fail
ing in 1952, was passed in 1954.
New qualifications in the
amendment included:


A GREENWOOD, Mississippi, policeman drags a
pregnant Negro woman to jail during a Free
dom Day demonstration. A white radio announc-

er reporting the arrests drawled, "And they
dumped that Nigger woman in the back of that
paddy wagon like a sack of potatoes."
First, a person must be able to
read, write and interpret any sec
tion of the constitution.
Second, a person must bo able

istrar a reasonable understand

plete the form. . . . The questions
are not difficult, but many reason
ably intelligent people might find
