# Segregation, Poverty Hurt Mississippi
## 
### 
Segregation and poverty are
the twin bonds that restrict Ihe
state of Mississippi. And in the
segregated society, Negroes are
given a special position at tho
bottom of tho state's economic
strata.
In 1960, the per capita personal
income was only $1173 or 52.8 per
cent of the national average, and
had increased only 17 per cent
from the end of World War 11.
The state's own Economic Coun
cil has declared that "experience
since the end of World War II
gives little basis for projecting
that per capita income in Missis
sippi will increase at a faster pace
than in the nation as a whole."
Ironically it is the federal gov
ernment which to a large degree
supports the economic life of the
state. Mississippi 1959-61, paid in
per capita taxes $218, and re
ceived. per capita, $270 from the
government. Over 2>S per cent of
the state's income came from the
federal government.
BUT THE state's politicians
maintain that, the growth of the
government should be stopped,
fearing increased centralization
of government. Both houses
passed the Liberty Amendment ,
this year which states that the}
government shall not engage in
any business, professional, com
mercial, financial or industrial en
terprise except as specified in the
Constitution," and that three
years after tho ratification of the
amendment, "the Sixteenth
Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States shall stand
repealed and thereafter Congress ;
shall not levy taxes on personal
incomes, estates, and/or gifts."
The senate passed it 26-21.
The platform of the Mississippi
Democratic party in 1960 stated,
"We believe in States' Rights and

local self-government, and are un
alterably opposed to any encroach
ment upon the rights of the states
by the federal government, or
any department or agency there
of, and upon county and municip
al government by the state, or
any department or agency there
of. It added, "We are opposed to
strong centralized government,
national or state."
BUT WHILE the state is the
poorest in the nation, the Negroes
are the poorest part: of Mississippi
society. In 1960 only 4.5 per cent
of the white labor force was un
employed. hut 7.1 of the non
whites were.
The whites in the state had a
median income of $2,023, but the
nonwhite median was $606. In
rural areas, which include well
over half the state's population,
the non-white median was only
$474.
By every standard the Negro
is economically behind the whites,
and he has responded by leaving
the state in large numbers. Be
tween 1950 and 1960 the number
of Negroes in the 20-34 age group
declined nearly 40 per cent in tho
state, and that of the 35-44 age
group dropped about 35 per cent.
TIIK NEGRO population as a
whole fell 7-1 per cent. In Issa
quena County the Negro popula
tion declined 28.3 per cent during
tho decade, and in only 15 of the
state's 82 countries was there a
rise in Negro population.
Statistics on the housing condi
tions are quite interesting. Only
38 per cent of tho Negroes own
their own homes, and of tho 128,-
0(10 rented occupied units, 95,483
wore classified by the Bureau of
tho Census as either deteriorat
ing or dilapidated. In addition,
42,403 owner occupied units are
placed in like categories.

Of the total Negro housing
units, 207,611, 100,138 have no
piped water, 137,881 have no flush
toilets, and 160,413 have no bath
tub or shower.
BUT DESPITE this, segrega
tionist columnist Charles Hills in
the Jackson Clarion-Ledger be
lieves the North is attacking the
South because of "jealousy be
cause of Mississippi's industrial
expansion."
The Negro in Mississippi re
ceives less education than the
white and is also in school for less
lime. Census figures state that
of tho nonwhite population over
25 the median grade completed
is six.
ONLY 4.2 per cent have grad
uated from high school, compared
to 24.6 per cent of the whites.
Over eight per cent of tho Ne
groes have never gone to school
Tho state pays little for educa
tion. Tho Mississippi classroom
teacher's average salary is $2125
loss than the national average.
Negro teachers average about
$500 loss than the whites. The
state is last in tho nation in pot
capita expenditures for students
and of the small total that ihe
state spends on education, tho Ne
groes get far less than the whites.
In North Pike Countv $30.89 is

spent per white pupil, and only
$.76 is spend per Negro. In South
Pike, the figures are $59.55 for
the whites and $1.35 for the Ne
groes. In Forrest County and Hat
tiesburg the ratio is about two to
one.
And when students finally got
an education in the slate they find
that there are no jobs for them.
Only 21-35 per cent of the engi
neering graduates of Mississippi
State University, a white school,
were able to find their first job
in the state, and only 57.8 per
cent of the state's education grad
uates remain.
Labor in the state is also feared.
In tho spring of 1963, Vaughn
Watkins, president of the Missis
sippi Economic Council, said thai
unless effective counter action
wore taken, "tho plan of tho AFL
CIO to take control of politics
in Mississippi will succeed."
The major of Pelahatchie wrote
in 1954 to a New Haven manufac
ture that, "Our wonderful labor,
98 per cent native born, mostly
high school graduates, will lower
average hourly industrial wage
rates 6 cents to 49 cents below
other Southern states, and from
50 cents to 95 cenls below North
ern states. You will also got a
much higher average man produe

tion, some plants even getting
double what they got in Northern
plants. This labor is truly Amer
ican, not inflicted with the 'Some
thing for Nothing' idea and works
together joyously with manage
ment for the success of both."
Meanwhile the life for the Ne
groes continues to be sub-stand
ard. For example, the death rates
of Negroes per 1,000 population
in the state is 11.0, higher than
that of whites in 1913, and the
death rate for children under one
year old is ")0 per 1,000. That is
twice the figure for whites, and
equivalent to the white death
rate in 1930.
COFO REPORTS that "The ca
lorie inlake of some not all
poor rural Mississippians is at
some -not al 1 times sufficient.
. . . The rest of the time the poor
rural families, the under and un
employed, fare as best they can.
. . . Even when people get enough
food, il is largely starches and
fats. There is great reliance on
corn bread, sweet potatoes, rice
and fat or side pork. Even the
government commodities are not
sufficient for adequate nutrition.
The poor in Mississippi do not
get enough protein, calcium, es
sential vitamins and minerals for
proper nutrition."
