# RIGHTS WORKER'S DIARY
## Non- Violence In A Hot, Green Land 
### 
EDITORS NOTE: Lucien Kit
bat, a Stanford Medical student, I
s|*Mit this summer in Meridian,
Mississippi working 1 as a tcacher i
in a Freedom School. Following
arc excerpts from his diary.
Although tli«' general outline j
of th«' excerpts is chronological, !
no attempt lias been made to pre
serve the chronology of the par
ticular incidents. Our purpose
was to reproduce the effect of
the original 12,000-word document
in a little over 1,000 words.
THE CALL
In Meridian Mississippi, a Ne
gro woman calls to the white
people in the North: "They (the
Mississippi whites) bomb o u r
churches. I say they bomb o u r
churches. You know they bomb
our churches. You see it on tele
vision. And then you don't be
lieve it. Will you please come and
help us. Would you please come
down here and help us?"
THE THOUGHTS BEFORE
(Mr. Kabat describes the week
of orientation in Oxford, Ohio.)
I have a funny feeling as I
write this diary that it might out
live me. I have never thought so
much about death before.
Dr. Martin Luther King told
us that if you're scared at night
for no apparent reason and feel
silly about it, tell everybody about
your fear.
THE FIRST DAYS
We must be in Mississippi now. !
The country is green and pretty. |
It looks too calm and nice to be j
so violent.
We were rather shocked to
learn that Freeman, Ruth, Diane
and I were brought here (Meri
dian. Miss.) to take the place of
the three missing civil rights
workers.
In the evening we met the Ne

gro man who invited lis to spend
the summer at his house. He was
quite ill, (Parkinsonism, I think>.
He is also very poor, the father
of ten children and has not been
to a doctor.
The reverend asked us not to
attend his church as the people
were afraid that their church
would be bombed.
Lon, a Negro civil rights work
er, returned from New York with
frightening stories of tin 1 violence
there. He said he was glad to be

back to the peace and quiet of
Meridian.
I hold my classes in the Free
dom School's "Science Room," so
named because of the presence
of a bat in a bottle.
Some of the people here are
very dedicated. Marshall is a 13-
year-old boy who went into u
White-Only library to test th e
Civil Rights Law all by himself.
Lilly, a 15-year-old Negro girl,
lives with her mother and daugh
ter in conditions that could be de

scribed only as utter squalor. The
rent is $6 a week and she strug
gles to pay that. She works 12
hours a day for COFO (Council
ot Federated Organizations) with
out compensation.
"ONLY OF LIFE"
It's strange that only a few
weeks ago I was in Memphis and
thinking of impending death in
Mississippi. Now I'm in Missis
sippi and am thinking only of
life.
If you walked into the comma

■ i nity center cjii a typical day, you
! might find kids on (lie floor with
!! paints and might hear music
; from the record player. You
| might see five or six kids wres-
I tling with Freeman and lie would
be smiling under the pile. 1 might
j be off in a corner with little Mary
Lance. Ray and some of the Wal
| lace kids might be reading a
| story, "Morton Hatches the Egg."
Lilly would be flirtatiously pok
ing some boy or other and she
! would smille and say in a sultry
j voice, "I'll beat your butt."
I gave "medical" advice earlier
i this week to a father whose son
i had an adscession in his chest.
II told them to take the kid to a
t doctor. The father thanked me
I and kissed my hand, I was em
i harassed and didn't know what to
' do. So I kissed his hand.
At lunch time all the kids
were dancing and I particularly
liked the "monkey," a very funny
dance in which you "climb a tiee
pick a banana, cat it and rub
your tummy." When I mentioned
| the swim everybody said 1 was
old fashioned. They never even
j heard of the bop.
Today Freeman and I went to
j the community center. Two Ne
| gro boys that were coming with
iiis to the center had to pretend
; that they didn't know us and had
I to sit in the back of the bus.
Today we discussed non-vio
lence with the kids in the free
| dom school. One boy said, "If
! all the white people are dead, you
will still have a race problem.
I The only difference is that the
problem will be among Negroes."
Yesterday I drove some kids to
test the Civil Rights Law. We got
j served at Chick 'n Treat, Big R.
Root Beer, and the Dairy Queen,
bui were turned away at Burger
| Chef. Lilly said "You toll the
folks back home it was a beauti
ful experience (to be served at
the Chick 'n Treat). And it was.
We all saved our cups and nap
i kins.
Today I went to the community
center and asked the kids in the
ancient Passover style: "Why is
i this day different from all t he
rest?" They answered: "Because
I Mickey and them are dead." (The
i three civil rights workers whose
i bodies were found after a search
of more than a month.)
LKAVIXC*
This my last week in Missis
sippi and it is hard for me to
I leave. I am fighting a non-violent
battle because 1 believe that hate
begets hate and perhaps thai love
1 begets love.


FREEDOM SCHOOL IN HATTIESBURG: Perhaps
if people felt free inside themselves—felt that

they were peaceful and had control of themselves
they would not need to fight with each other.

THE FIRST DAYS
We must be in Mississippi now. !
The country is green and pretty. |
It looks too calm and nice to be j
so violent.
We were rather shocked to
learn that Freeman, Ruth, Diane
and I were brought here (Meri
dian. Miss.) to take the place of
the three missing civil rights
workers.
In the evening we met the Ne

gro man who invited lis to spend
the summer at his house. He was
quite ill, (Parkinsonism, I think>.
He is also very poor, the father
of ten children and has not been
to a doctor.
The reverend asked us not to
attend his church as the people
were afraid that their church
would be bombed.
Lon, a Negro civil rights work
er, returned from New York with
frightening stories of tin 1 violence
there. He said he was glad to be

back to the peace and quiet of
Meridian.
I hold my classes in the Free
dom School's "Science Room," so
named because of the presence
of a bat in a bottle.
Some of the people here are
very dedicated. Marshall is a 13-
year-old boy who went into u
White-Only library to test th e
Civil Rights Law all by himself.
Lilly, a 15-year-old Negro girl,
lives with her mother and daugh
ter in conditions that could be de

scribed only as utter squalor. The
rent is $6 a week and she strug
gles to pay that. She works 12
hours a day for COFO (Council
ot Federated Organizations) with
out compensation.
"ONLY OF LIFE"
It's strange that only a few
weeks ago I was in Memphis and
thinking of impending death in
Mississippi. Now I'm in Missis
sippi and am thinking only of
life.

At lunch time all the kids
were dancing and I particularly
liked the "monkey," a very funny

Today Freeman and I went to

iiis to the center had to pretend

Today we discussed non-vio

"ONLY OF LIFE"
It's strange that only a few
weeks ago I was in Memphis and
thinking of impending death in
Mississippi. Now I'm in Missis
sippi and am thinking only of
life.

At lunch time all the kids

FREEDOM SCHOOL IN HATTIESBURG: Perhaps

EDITORS NOTE: Lucien Kit
bat, a Stanford Medical student, I
s|*Mit this summer in Meridian,
Mississippi working 1 as a tcacher i
in a Freedom School. Following
arc excerpts from his diary.
Although tli«' general outline j
of th«' excerpts is chronological, !
no attempt lias been made to pre
serve the chronology of the par
ticular incidents. Our purpose
was to reproduce the effect of
the original 12,000-word document
in a little over 1,000 words.
THE CALL
In Meridian Mississippi, a Ne
gro woman calls to the white
people in the North: "They (the
Mississippi whites) bomb o u r
churches. I say they bomb o u r
churches. You know they bomb
our churches. You see it on tele
vision. And then you don't be
lieve it. Will you please come and
help us. Would you please come
down here and help us?"
THE THOUGHTS BEFORE
(Mr. Kabat describes the week
of orientation in Oxford, Ohio.)
I have a funny feeling as I
write this diary that it might out
live me. I have never thought so
much about death before.
Dr. Martin Luther King told
us that if you're scared at night
for no apparent reason and feel
silly about it, tell everybody about
your fear.
THE FIRST DAYS
We must be in Mississippi now. !
The country is green and pretty. |
It looks too calm and nice to be j
so violent.
We were rather shocked to
learn that Freeman, Ruth, Diane
and I were brought here (Meri
dian. Miss.) to take the place of
the three missing civil rights
workers.
In the evening we met the Ne

gro man who invited lis to spend
the summer at his house. He was
quite ill, (Parkinsonism, I think>.
He is also very poor, the father
of ten children and has not been
to a doctor.
The reverend asked us not to
attend his church as the people
were afraid that their church
would be bombed.
Lon, a Negro civil rights work
er, returned from New York with
frightening stories of tin 1 violence
there. He said he was glad to be

back to the peace and quiet of
Meridian.
I hold my classes in the Free
dom School's "Science Room," so
named because of the presence
of a bat in a bottle.
Some of the people here are
very dedicated. Marshall is a 13-
year-old boy who went into u
White-Only library to test th e
Civil Rights Law all by himself.
