## Never-Never Land 
### 
There is a sickness in this land ... a paralysis ... a cancer . . .
a pallor hidden beneath our patriotic rouge. In our "good north
ern communities, in San Francisco — here — the disease is in
remission. In Mississippi it has erupted iu an open sore. The dif
ference, though crucial, is one of degree. Mississippi is our na
tional caricature.
The story ot Mississippi as sketched in these pages is neces
sarily one-sided. Quite possibly, it defies credulity. For this is
the land ot "Never-Ncver" where a "Way ol Life for some de
mands a Way of Death for others — a topsy-turvy world where
injustice is law and justice is treason and the good people stand
deaf, dumb, and blind in the vortex of the whirlpool.
It is easy to be self-righteous — to be self-righteous and to do
nothing. For years no one did anything. \nd tor years Negroes
were degraded and beaten and murdered in Mississippi. And no
one knew. The formula is not "agitation equals violence. I here
has always been violence, greater before than now. Ihe differ
ence is that now we know , or are beginning to know, and to be
lieve and to be outraged and, perhaps, to act.
The Mississippi Way ot Life can only exist in isolation. With
in Mississippi, the vocal and \iolent minority can rule only so long
as it has the silent permission of the majority. Within the nation,
Mississippi can mock democracy only so long as those outside re
main ignorant and apathetic.
Solon once said the just society will be achieved only w hen
those not dircctlv affected by injustice feel more deeply offended
than those who are its victims. This is the point Irom which all
efforts to crack the closed society depart..
The "outsiders" who went to Mississippi this summer gener
ated the first catalytic action necessary to real social change. Their
presence was painful, as antiseptic applied to a festering sore is
painful. But Mississippi will not change without pain.
They were not righteous, these "outsiders." They came not to
a front the majority but to aid the minority. They came not to force
change but to demonstrate the need for change. Thev came not
to outrage but to expose outrage. \nd. most of all, they came to
shatter silence. Thev will be back. — XLS
