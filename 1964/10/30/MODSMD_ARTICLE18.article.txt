"1 had tears in my eyes a few
weeks ago. A Negro was was
mowing a white man's yard.
Everybody came in for lunch.
After they finished they put some
food on the Negro's plate and fed
him out in the yard by the clothes
line. I prayed to the Lord to let
us have freedom."
"NECJRO MAN have to feed his
family just like the white man
