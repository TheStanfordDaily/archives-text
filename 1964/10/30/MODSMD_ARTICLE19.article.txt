## Vocal Minority Rules In Miss. 
### 
Mississippi prides itself on its citizens' individual freedom, hut
the \oice of the state—its news media, its civic leaders, the people
who care to make their opinions known—is surprisingly singular.
Nowhere do the moderates lead, and in all hut the rarest of cases
—the Hoddini* Carters, the |ames Silvers, and a handful of others

—the moderate is silent. The*
voice of Mississippi then does not j
represent the majority, but rather |
a vocal and intransient minority.
This is Ihe voice of white Missis
sippi :
"THKRK IS NO racial problem!
here in this state -Our system of |
strict segregation permits the two
races to live in close proximity j
and harmony with each other and ,
eliminates any racial problem.!
What the communists are so anx- j
ious to do is to create a RAt'IAL
ISSUE, and expand the issue into
a bloody revolution."
"Here where I live wo have
always treated our col o red
friends good and they love us.
Our colored friends here have |
good schools and the same kind :
of chances for education that we
do and have been happy with it
and surely we want them to have j
equal chances for improvement." j
"The Negro reproduction rate j
is higher than that of the Can- j
casion and sexual practices more
lax."
"The Negro masses prefer their
own kind as do white people."
"THE NEGROES' rate of intel-'
leelual pr ogre s s differs from
whites, lagging somewhat behind
until adolescence, then falling far
! behind."
"The Negro possesses a ehanu • 1
teristic odor of the skin, which is ;
inherent and not caused by un-i
cleanliness."
"These 'white niggers' are the
rottenest of the race-mixing crim
inals. All race-mixers will some-'
day bo brought 10 justice for their
crimes against humanity and all
future generations, and. since]
race-mixing is m<> rail y more
CRIMINAL than MURDER, it
would give me greal satisfaction
if 1 were selected to sit on such
I a jury."

"NOW TIIE Kennedys they
took away our freedom
Rut they'll never take away
our pride
And I'll always thumb my nose
at little Robby
And congratulate the devil
when he dies."
"For the last several years the
Communist in s pi re d northern
press has been preaching to the
southern Negro and the nation
how dissatisfied the southern Ne
gro is with his way of life. If the
| southern Negro is dissatisfied
I with his way of life, I don't be
j lieve we would have 68 per cent
1 Negroes in Leflore County. . . .
| I hope no one will believe Civil
'Rights is a real issue here. The
agitators that are infesting our
i cities are here to destroy our
j economy. . . ."
"TIIE MOTIVATION behind
the Mississippi invasion is a sub
ject of deep concern. If the mo-
I tives were understood, lawless
ness and strife might be curbed.
A generation ago, it would have
I been helpful to know what moved
the Hitler Brown Shirt youths
j who rampaged in the streets and
destroyed the law-abidding char
acter of Germany."
"The strange thing is that while
everyone sees violence and blood
shed in the South, we folks who
live here have never been witness.
I. . . Yet we stand accused, the
whitest people in the world, we
stand accused, not for what we
have done, but for what we have
refused to do."
"THE CITIZENS' Councils,
(since their inception, have been
opposed to violence and disorder
and have sought to accomplish
their purposes through legal and
constitutional means. . . Gov
ernor Paul Johnson.
