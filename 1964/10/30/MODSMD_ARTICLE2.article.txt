# Negro's Place In Mississippi

"Mississippi society is structured around a 'system of power
lessness' by which the Negro is consistently prevented from climb
ing on the turning wheel of progress," said Dr. Otis A. Pease,
Stanford history profesor, in a recent speech.
"The \egro in Mississippi literally exists at the white man's

whim," Pease stressed. "So he- 1
learns to be a sensitive judge of
character . . . and when he meets
the white man, he wears a mask
that ancient mask of apathy and
submission, and maybe a little bit
ol comedy. . . . He learns to be
n good actor; he has to be."
THE ENTIRE social structure
of Mississippi is designed to give
one group of people, the whites,
total control of another group of
people the Negroe's Pease reiter
ated: "Brutality is endemic to
such a system. . . . You remem
ber the line, 'Power tends to cor
rupt and absolute power corrupts
absolutely.' . . . Well, the Missis
sippi white man has that kind of
absolute power."
Pease related a few of the end
less stories of white brutality, re
fering frequently to a COFO docu
ment summarizing the incidents
"some trivial, some tragic"
which occured between June 16

and August 25. It runs to 26 pages,
single spaced typed.
lie concluded the "horror
stories" by reading from a north
ern doctor's statement of his
autopsy on the bodies of the three
civil rights workers, Goorlman,
Schwerner, and Chancy, murdered |
in Nasoba County last June. The
doctor reported that Goodman
and Schwerner, both white, had
been shot once each through the
heart
CHANKY, a Mississippi Negro,
was beaten 1o death with such
consummate force that all the
bones in his arms and shoulders
were pulverized and his body was
generally in the condition of
bodies smashed in extremely high
speed accidents. "Even in death,
the Negro got 'special' treatment,"
Pease commented.
However, such heinous crimes
as the triple slaying are only part
of the picture, Pease stressed.
There are also the thousands of
little outrages and indignities that
define a Mississippi Negro's life
from birth to death, so that rarely
a day goes by when he doesn't
"know again, that day, that he's
a 'nigger'—less than human, an
animal."
BEHIND ALL the brutality,
tragic and trivial, is the political
structure of Mississippi society —
the base of all other injustice.
Because ho has no vote, and until
recently, no political organization
that could belong to him, the Ne
gro has been powerless to effect
change.
If he is to break out from the
vicious circle in which his life
runs, the Mississippi Negro must
have outside aid: "If you have
no friends within the state, if you
are powerless, then you try to
find powerful friends outside the
state."
The federal government, when
it has acted, or threatened to act,
has been effective in catalyzing
the essential first change: an end
to violence as a means of defend
ing the "Way of Life." But "the
government is composed of divid
ed sovereignties. The President
does not have infinite power."
BRINGING PRESSURE to bear
upon Mississippi whites through
the federal government in its
many capacities may be the essen
tial means of effecting an initial
revision of the Mississippi social
structure, hut it is slow and often
tedious. There is always the latent
danger of wholesale violence:
"When rising expectations collide
with the forms of oppression, you
have the pre-conditions of revo
