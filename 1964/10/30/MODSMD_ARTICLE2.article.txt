# Negro's Place In Mississippi
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
"Mississippi society is structured around a 'system of power
lessness' by which the Negro is consistently prevented from climb
ing on the turning wheel of progress," said Dr. Otis A. Pease,
Stanford history profesor, in a recent speech.
"The \egro in Mississippi literally exists at the white man's

whim," Pease stressed. "So he- 1
learns to be a sensitive judge of
character . . . and when he meets
the white man, he wears a mask
that ancient mask of apathy and
submission, and maybe a little bit
ol comedy. . . . He learns to be
n good actor; he has to be."
THE ENTIRE social structure
of Mississippi is designed to give
one group of people, the whites,
total control of another group of
people the Negroe's Pease reiter
ated: "Brutality is endemic to
such a system. . . . You remem
ber the line, 'Power tends to cor
rupt and absolute power corrupts
absolutely.' . . . Well, the Missis
sippi white man has that kind of
absolute power."
Pease related a few of the end
less stories of white brutality, re
fering frequently to a COFO docu
ment summarizing the incidents
"some trivial, some tragic"
which occured between June 16

and August 25. It runs to 26 pages,
single spaced typed.
lie concluded the "horror
stories" by reading from a north
ern doctor's statement of his
autopsy on the bodies of the three
civil rights workers, Goorlman,
Schwerner, and Chancy, murdered |
in Nasoba County last June. The
doctor reported that Goodman
and Schwerner, both white, had
been shot once each through the
heart
CHANKY, a Mississippi Negro,
was beaten 1o death with such
consummate force that all the
bones in his arms and shoulders
were pulverized and his body was
generally in the condition of
bodies smashed in extremely high
speed accidents. "Even in death,
the Negro got 'special' treatment,"
Pease commented.
However, such heinous crimes
as the triple slaying are only part
of the picture, Pease stressed.
There are also the thousands of
little outrages and indignities that
define a Mississippi Negro's life
from birth to death, so that rarely
a day goes by when he doesn't
"know again, that day, that he's
a 'nigger'—less than human, an
animal."
BEHIND ALL the brutality,
tragic and trivial, is the political
structure of Mississippi society —
the base of all other injustice.
Because ho has no vote, and until
recently, no political organization
that could belong to him, the Ne
gro has been powerless to effect
change.
If he is to break out from the
vicious circle in which his life
runs, the Mississippi Negro must
have outside aid: "If you have
no friends within the state, if you
are powerless, then you try to
find powerful friends outside the
state."
The federal government, when
it has acted, or threatened to act,
has been effective in catalyzing
the essential first change: an end
to violence as a means of defend
ing the "Way of Life." But "the
government is composed of divid
ed sovereignties. The President
does not have infinite power."
BRINGING PRESSURE to bear
upon Mississippi whites through
the federal government in its
many capacities may be the essen
tial means of effecting an initial
revision of the Mississippi social
structure, hut it is slow and often
tedious. There is always the latent
danger of wholesale violence:
"When rising expectations collide
with the forms of oppression, you
have the pre-conditions of revo
of aeting as a coordinator of civil
rights activities on campus and
as a as a disseminator of informa
tion on the then upcoming Mis
sissippi Summer Project to inter
ested colleges and universities on
the West Coast.
In April, the Secretariat spon
sored the three-day All Western
States Civil Rights Conference,
which brought Martin Luther
King to the Stanford campus for
a key-note address.
It was largely through the ef
forts of the Secretariat that over
forty members of the Stanford
community—the largest single
such group in the Freedom Proj
ect—left for Mississippi last June.
TIIE FIRST STOP was an or
ientation session in Oxford, Ohio,
to learn the rules of the difficult
game: "Doors of cars should be
locked at all times; no one should
go anywhere alone, but certainly

not in a car, and certainly not at
night; when getting out of a car
at night, make sure the car's in
side light is out; try not to sleep
near open windows; do not stand
in doorways at night with the
light at your back . . and on
and on.
The next stop was Mississippi.
For those working in voter reg
istration, the first job—and some
times the continual job—was to
break down the barriers of sus
picion and fear.
MEDICAL STUDENT Luke Ra
bat, working out of Meridian,
wrote in his diary: "James Mere
dith, Medgar Evers, four girls
killed in Birmingham bombings
multiplied by three and one-half
centuries make it difficult to love.
The black man in Mississippi is
bitter against the white man and
the civil rights worker is the
white man to many of them. They
meet you with hope and distrust.
When you come wtih your high
flown answers, your greatly ar

ticulated theories, the Negroes
you work with will hate your
guts."
"When you a p pr o a c h e d the
porch," said senior Carolyn
Eagan, "they wouldn't look at you.
And then they'd say, 'Yes, Ma'am.
Yes, Ma'am' (from women 40
years older than me). 'I'm for the
movement 100%, but I jus' can't
sign that form.' "
It wasn't apathy that held them
back, but rather a "combination
of fear and ignorance." "Apathy,
hell; I hate that word!" said
sophomore Chris Wilson. "If a
guy's going to lose his job because
he tries to register, he's got good
reason to hestitate; and that's not
apathy."
"THE GREAT moment is when
you first break through the
mask," he continued. "The white
Mississippian doesn't know Ne
groes; he only knows the Negro
that said 'Yes, Sir' to me, not the
Negro that started matching wits
with me. . . . It's amazing. Even

after all these years, they don't
accept it; way down deep inside,
these people burn. . . ."
For white and black, the sum
mer was a time of mutual dis
covery. "There was this little girl,
Bobby Jean," recalled Dave Bar
num, who taught in a rural free
dom school. "There was always a
lot of scuffling in the grass . . .
and when we were playing, at
first, she would claw at me, just
a little bit, furtively, as if she
had to get it out of her system.
. . . I guess we were the first
white people she had ever encoun
tered who were even remotely
vulnerable."
As the white student discovered
the Mississippi Negro, he also dis
covered the Negro's constant
companion: fear. He discovered it
and learned how to deal with it.
IN A MID-JULY letter, Ilene
Strelitz, for mer editor of the Stan
ford Daily, wrote: "For all our
fears, they (the Negroes) have
somehow managed to live day
after day with psychological and
physical stress that no white
northern summer visitor will ever
come near to experiencing. There
was something that kept them

going and this we begun to grope
for madly.
"We discovered that there are
at least two types of fear, one
which mesmerizes and one which
activates. It was the latter we ex
perienced, for by some strange
phenomenon, once we knew that
the three missing workers prob
ably were dead, we knew, as we
had never known before, that we
had to be in Mississippi."
FEAR — mesmerizing fear
once dealt with, could be lot got
ten; there was too much to do,
too much to discover.
"There are all kinds of reasons
why people go to Mississippi,"
said Larry Spears, "some sordid,
some naive, some realistic. . . .
For me it was the need to speak
out. ... It seems that the only
way we can speak to our prob
lems is to speak to their prob
lems."
"Come with me to see those
people," said Chris Wilson, "just
one day, and then you'll really
see. ... It's like they say, if we
just got to know each other. . . .
Well, I got to know them. . . .
And when I think of those people.
. . . Then I really see."
