FREEDOM DAY in Greenwood: One day they will look back and
[hey will say that we called them bad names, we looked down
on them, we murdered them, but they taught us something we
needed to know . . . They may murder you now, but the day is going
to come when they 11 call you blessed. . . . There comes a time when
you have to keep on walkin' and you can't turn back. It's high noon
in America."
