# SEGREGATION:
## The 						Wall Of Guilt And Fear 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
The human tradegy of segregation ironically,
paradoxically, knows no color lines. A steay diet
of hate and fear breaks the human mind and the
human heart. And Mississippi is full of broken
people, both black and white.
THE TRAGEDY of the Mississippi white is
that he thought he could dehumanize and destroy
the Negro without dehumanizing and destroying
himself. And he was wrong. The White Mississip
ian erected a wall to keep the Negroes out and of
that wall, unknowingly, built a prison within which
he has only his fears for company.
"Fear approaches paranoia," writes Stanford
medical student Luke Kabat, based Meridian dur
ing the summer. "Everything new and strange
threatens the white Mississippian. Everything is
against them; the rest of the country, the U.N.,
other countries, and they feel they are fighting a
lonely and noble battle.
THE WHITE Mississippian — especially the
Klu Klux Klansman — is, in truth, a Romantic
fiercely engaged in a battle to retain belief in the
myths of his heritage and history — the myths
upon which he has built his life. James Baldwin's
concept of the "White Man's Problem" is per
fectly apt. He explains that the white man says
one thing about himself, and his country, and then
acts another way. So to hide the disparity he has
to tell a big lie.
Lillian Smith, herself a white southerner, do
fined the nature of Ihe Big Lie, and its conse
quences, in an October issue of Saturday Review
thus: "For nearly a century we Southerners have
stereotyped not only the Negro but ourselves. . . .
We see ourselves as nice people, who if not pushed
too hard, will give the Negro a bag of goodies now
and then. . . . We see ourselves in an aura of kind
ness; we feel good-hearted, and often gently tender
as we give our little presents. . . ."
"SUDDENLY THE stereotypes we have made
of them and us collide and crash and break into
splinters; we feel nakedly exposed as we stare at
our real selves, and stunned as we stare at them.
. . . ; we see something dishonest which we can
not bear to acknowledge."
In an effort to avoid the kind of shocking con
frontation of which Smith speaks, the white Mis
sissippian has developed the art of non-seeing and
nn»i it tlm \*rtv\r unmn ?i ntiA rannnt hnln

but remarking, that enabled the German people
two decades ago somehow not to nolice that, two
million Jews were being carried off to concentra
tion camps and death.
The deception, at best, involves constant ten
sion.
"THE WHITES, — the good people,, Ihe intel
ligent people, the moderate people — are a people
without a sense of joy," commented Rev. Richard
Roe of Palo Alto, a minister-counselor with the
Summer Project in Greenville. "Their lives are
riddled with guilt feelings which they can't face •
feelings which express themselves in persistent,
undefined tension."
There is tension in the Mississippi Negro com
munity, too. And overt fear. Larry Spears, a Stan
ford senior beaten by two whites in Hattiesburg
this summer, explained, "Fear here is an every
day problem. It is a constant of a Negro's life.
Sometimes it is amorphous and general. Some
times it is clear and sj)ecific. but it is constant."
"The system in Mississippi," Spears continued,
"works by cutting people off from one another—
through fear. The terrorists aim at one person
. . . one. But nobody wants to be that one. So
everybody tries to shrink into the gray, into the
shadows. . . . And the community just breaks up."
INDIVIDUALLY, tho Mississippi Negroes have
learned long ago how to deal with tension and fear.
They know the rules of Iho white man's game, and
play it with utter sophistication when they have
to. In public the mask is always up. But, since
the Freedom Project began, the Mississippi Negro
is learning how 1o deal with fear and tension as
a community. They are developing, slowly and
tentatively a sense of collective self-assurance.
They are learning the simple truth that in unity
there is strength.
The other simple truths of life they have al
ways known:
"We are trying to show people that we're not
monkeys," says Fanny Lou I lamer of Ruleville.
"That we are peoples. . . . We are decent people.
... I have four in my family. I don't even get
$40 a week for them . . . but I'm willing to share
with humanity. It doesn't matter what color. . . .
I'm willin' to share whatever I have. . . . It's jus
that I can't understand what those crazy white
folks are doin*. They're jus eating themselves up
inside hating us so much."

times it is clear and sj)ecific. but it is constant."
"The system in Mississippi," Spears continued,
"works by cutting people off from one another—
through fear. The terrorists aim at one person
. . . one. But nobody wants to be that one. So
everybody tries to shrink into the gray, into the
shadows. . . . And the community just breaks up."
INDIVIDUALLY, tho Mississippi Negroes have
learned long ago how to deal with tension and fear.
They know the rules of Iho white man's game, and
play it with utter sophistication when they have
to. In public the mask is always up. But, since
the Freedom Project began, the Mississippi Negro
is learning how 1o deal with fear and tension as
a community. They are developing, slowly and
tentatively a sense of collective self-assurance.
They are learning the simple truth that in unity
there is strength.
The other simple truths of life they have al
ways known:
"We are trying to show people that we're not
monkeys," says Fanny Lou I lamer of Ruleville.
"That we are peoples. . . . We are decent people.
... I have four in my family. I don't even get
$40 a week for them . . . but I'm willing to share
with humanity. It doesn't matter what color. . . .
I'm willin' to share whatever I have. . . . It's jus
that I can't understand what those crazy white
folks are doin*. They're jus eating themselves up
inside hating us so much."
The human tradegy of segregation ironically,
paradoxically, knows no color lines. A steay diet
of hate and fear breaks the human mind and the
human heart. And Mississippi is full of broken
people, both black and white.
THE TRAGEDY of the Mississippi white is
that he thought he could dehumanize and destroy
the Negro without dehumanizing and destroying
himself. And he was wrong. The White Mississip
ian erected a wall to keep the Negroes out and of
that wall, unknowingly, built a prison within which
he has only his fears for company.
"Fear approaches paranoia," writes Stanford
medical student Luke Kabat, based Meridian dur
ing the summer. "Everything new and strange
threatens the white Mississippian. Everything is
against them; the rest of the country, the U.N.,
other countries, and they feel they are fighting a
lonely and noble battle.
THE WHITE Mississippian — especially the
Klu Klux Klansman — is, in truth, a Romantic
fiercely engaged in a battle to retain belief in the
myths of his heritage and history — the myths
upon which he has built his life. James Baldwin's
concept of the "White Man's Problem" is per
fectly apt. He explains that the white man says
one thing about himself, and his country, and then
acts another way. So to hide the disparity he has
to tell a big lie.
Lillian Smith, herself a white southerner, do
fined the nature of Ihe Big Lie, and its conse
quences, in an October issue of Saturday Review
thus: "For nearly a century we Southerners have
stereotyped not only the Negro but ourselves. . . .
We see ourselves as nice people, who if not pushed
too hard, will give the Negro a bag of goodies now
and then. . . . We see ourselves in an aura of kind
ness; we feel good-hearted, and often gently tender
as we give our little presents. . . ."
"SUDDENLY THE stereotypes we have made
of them and us collide and crash and break into
splinters; we feel nakedly exposed as we stare at
our real selves, and stunned as we stare at them.
. . . ; we see something dishonest which we can
not bear to acknowledge."
In an effort to avoid the kind of shocking con
frontation of which Smith speaks, the white Mis
sissippian has developed the art of non-seeing and
nn»i it tlm \*rtv\r unmn ?i ntiA rannnt hnln

but remarking, that enabled the German people
two decades ago somehow not to nolice that, two
million Jews were being carried off to concentra
tion camps and death.
The deception, at best, involves constant ten
sion.
"THE WHITES, — the good people,, Ihe intel
ligent people, the moderate people — are a people
without a sense of joy," commented Rev. Richard
Roe of Palo Alto, a minister-counselor with the
Summer Project in Greenville. "Their lives are
riddled with guilt feelings which they can't face •
feelings which express themselves in persistent,
undefined tension."
There is tension in the Mississippi Negro com
munity, too. And overt fear. Larry Spears, a Stan
ford senior beaten by two whites in Hattiesburg
this summer, explained, "Fear here is an every
day problem. It is a constant of a Negro's life.

"SUDDENLY THE stereotypes we have made
of them and us collide and crash and break into
splinters; we feel nakedly exposed as we stare at
our real selves, and stunned as we stare at them.

not bear to acknowledge."

"THE WHITES, — the good people,, Ihe intel
ligent people, the moderate people — are a people
without a sense of joy," commented Rev. Richard
Roe of Palo Alto, a minister-counselor with the
Summer Project in Greenville. "Their lives are
riddled with guilt feelings which they can't face •
feelings which express themselves in persistent,
undefined tension."
There is tension in the Mississippi Negro com
munity, too. And overt fear. Larry Spears, a Stan
ford senior beaten by two whites in Hattiesburg
this summer, explained, "Fear here is an every
day problem. It is a constant of a Negro's life.
Sometimes it is amorphous and general. Some
times it is clear and sj)ecific. but it is constant."
"The system in Mississippi," Spears continued,
"works by cutting people off from one another—
through fear. The terrorists aim at one person
. . . one. But nobody wants to be that one. So
everybody tries to shrink into the gray, into the
shadows. . . . And the community just breaks up."
INDIVIDUALLY, tho Mississippi Negroes have
learned long ago how to deal with tension and fear.
They know the rules of Iho white man's game, and
play it with utter sophistication when they have
to. In public the mask is always up. But, since
the Freedom Project began, the Mississippi Negro
is learning how 1o deal with fear and tension as
a community. They are developing, slowly and
tentatively a sense of collective self-assurance.
They are learning the simple truth that in unity
there is strength.
The other simple truths of life they have al
ways known:
"We are trying to show people that we're not
monkeys," says Fanny Lou I lamer of Ruleville.
"That we are peoples. . . . We are decent people.
... I have four in my family. I don't even get
$40 a week for them . . . but I'm willing to share
with humanity. It doesn't matter what color. . . .
I'm willin' to share whatever I have. . . . It's jus
that I can't understand what those crazy white
folks are doin*. They're jus eating themselves up
inside hating us so much."
The human tradegy of segregation ironically,
paradoxically, knows no color lines. A steay diet
of hate and fear breaks the human mind and the
human heart. And Mississippi is full of broken
people, both black and white.
THE TRAGEDY of the Mississippi white is
that he thought he could dehumanize and destroy
the Negro without dehumanizing and destroying
himself. And he was wrong. The White Mississip
ian erected a wall to keep the Negroes out and of
that wall, unknowingly, built a prison within which
he has only his fears for company.
"Fear approaches paranoia," writes Stanford
medical student Luke Kabat, based Meridian dur
ing the summer. "Everything new and strange
threatens the white Mississippian. Everything is
against them; the rest of the country, the U.N.,
other countries, and they feel they are fighting a
lonely and noble battle.
THE WHITE Mississippian — especially the
Klu Klux Klansman — is, in truth, a Romantic
fiercely engaged in a battle to retain belief in the
myths of his heritage and history — the myths
upon which he has built his life. James Baldwin's
concept of the "White Man's Problem" is per
fectly apt. He explains that the white man says
one thing about himself, and his country, and then
acts another way. So to hide the disparity he has
to tell a big lie.
Lillian Smith, herself a white southerner, do
fined the nature of Ihe Big Lie, and its conse
quences, in an October issue of Saturday Review
thus: "For nearly a century we Southerners have
stereotyped not only the Negro but ourselves. . . .
We see ourselves as nice people, who if not pushed
too hard, will give the Negro a bag of goodies now
and then. . . . We see ourselves in an aura of kind
ness; we feel good-hearted, and often gently tender
as we give our little presents. . . ."
