"There comes a point w hen v<

reasons why you can't <j;o to Missi
. . . It's a subtle kind of trap. .
when a leap has to be made—no
merely to stop putting obstacles'*
ip the way."
FOR SPEARS and forty other
Stanford students and faculty the
"time to stop making excuses"
came this summer. The leap was
made; and Stanford went to Mis
sissippi en mass to work in the
Freedom Project.
Stanford's emotional ties with
the Mississippi Project were first
forged during Ihe "Aaron Henry
Mock Vote Campaign" last fall.
The November "Mock Vote"
was a SNCC - organized project
aimed at demonstrating both the
desire of the Mississippi Negro
to vote and the political inequities
of the state establishment which
systematically prevent him from
fulfilling that desire.
The "Mock Election," conducted
concurrently with the "official"
state election, ran NAACP leader
Aaron Henry, a Mississippi Negro
pharmacist, for governor and the
Rev. Ed King, Tugaloo Chaplain,
for lieutenant governor.
The "Mock Vote" workers reg
istered Mississippi Negros on
their own forms and conducted a
"Freedom Election" based on that
registration which drew over
100.000 local participants despite
gross intimidation from the white
community.
As election day neared last No
vember and the "Mock Vote" ap
proached real success, harrass
ment of the voter registration
workers became so severe as to
effectively stall the project.
At one of the lowest points, the
Stanford community received
word of the arrest of A Hard Lo
wenstein, former Stanford pro
fessor and assistant Dean of Men
and long-time civil rights worker.
After his release, Lowenstein con
tacted several Stanford students
and informed Ihem of the dire
straights in which the "Mock
Vote" was then floundering.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney
! (who has temporarily dropped
out of school to work full time
in McComb, Mississippi), imme
diately left to aid the Project. An

informal fund-raising drive.
As word of the Mississippi Proj
ect spread through the commu
ity, the drive snow-balled. The
peak of the interest was reached
just before the election when
Stanford send over $1,000 a day
for five straight days to the state,
effectively turning the tide for
i the "Mock Election."
In the spring of last year a Civil
