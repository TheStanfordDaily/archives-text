### 
Editor's Note: Stanford senior Larry Spears, a his
tory major, spent three months Ihis summer do
ing voter registration work in Hattiesburg, Miss.
On Friday, July 10, lit*-. Project worker Dave Owen
of Pasadena, Rahhi Lelyveld of Cleveland, and two
local Negro girls were attacked and beaten by two
whites armed with iron pipes. Spears described the
beating in a letter to his family.
This has been one of the longest and probably
one of the most important days of my life. This
morning ... as we were returning from canvass
ing the surrounding area of Hattiesburg . . . we
were attacked by two armed white men. They left
their truck with two iron bars. . . . We had been
walking on the railroad track. As they walked up
the embankment, the three of us stood together
and waited for them. . . .
"AS THE APPROACHEI>, I stepped to one side
to divide them as we had been taught. ... I
stepped to the left. The younger man with the
iron rod stepped toward me . . . and started beat
me with the iron rod about the head and shoiil
ders.
As I raised my arms to protect myself, he
struck me, pushing me over the tracks and down
the embankment on the other side into a little
ravine.
"He followed me—but without the iron bar. He
kicked mo with his work boots and beat me with
his fists. The whole incident lasted not more than
two minutes.
"ALL THIS TIME he was swearing at me, call
ing me such things as 'nigger-lover,' 'white nigger,'
'Commie,' and 'Jew' and different combinations of
these. They weren't interested in hurting the two
Negro girls who were with us but only the three
'white niggers.'
"Meantime, the older man . . . had been beating
the other two (Dave Owen and Rabbi Lelyveld)
with a piece of machinery. He was beating Dave

about the head and shoulders; Dave fell to the
ground to protect himself.
"THE RABBI HAD not remembered what he
had been taught in orientation. . . . When he fi
nally fell to the ground he did not pull his knees
up . . . and left himself open to being beaten in
the abdomen.
"The two Negro girls were not accosted at all.
At one point, as one of them was kneeling over
Dave to protect him . . . the man looked at her
and said, 'I ought to wup you, nigger,' and then
went back to beating the Rabbi.
"AS I RETURNED to the top of the embank
ment, the Rabbi was kneeling, and blood was
streaming from an eye wound and a wound on the
back of his head. I helped him to his feet and the
five of us moved down the tracks trying to get
help. As we came to the first street which crossed
the tracks and proceeded into the Negro commu
nity . . . the truck . . . came up behind us and
attempted to kill us by running us down.
"The Rabbi, who was standing, slightly dazed,
closest to the man, was bleeding profusely. I
stepped to the Rabbi's right and said, 'Haven't you
hurt him enough?' The man didn't stop, and raised
his weapon and hit the Rabbi again. I shielded the
blow with my left forearm. This is where I in
curred my major injury.
"AT THE HOSPITAL . . . the local police came
in to question us. . . . They found time to have
two private jokes between them while the Rabbi
was still in such terrible condition.
"Profesor Pease was at a Volkswagen repair
shop in Hattiesburg when the news came over the
radio. . . . Five white mechanics let out a cheer."
(Postscript: All three workers recovered from
their beating. A month later, two men, Estes
Keyes and Clinton Hayes, were convicted of the
attack. They were fined $500 and 90 days at hard
labor. Both sentences were suspended.)

"He followed me—but without the iron bar. He
kicked mo with his work boots and beat me with
his fists. The whole incident lasted not more than
two minutes.
"ALL THIS TIME he was swearing at me, call
ing me such things as 'nigger-lover,' 'white nigger,'
'Commie,' and 'Jew' and different combinations of
these. They weren't interested in hurting the two
Negro girls who were with us but only the three
'white niggers.'
"Meantime, the older man . . . had been beating
the other two (Dave Owen and Rabbi Lelyveld)
with a piece of machinery. He was beating Dave

about the head and shoulders; Dave fell to the
ground to protect himself.
"THE RABBI HAD not remembered what he
had been taught in orientation. . . . When he fi
nally fell to the ground he did not pull his knees
up . . . and left himself open to being beaten in
the abdomen.
"The two Negro girls were not accosted at all.
At one point, as one of them was kneeling over
Dave to protect him . . . the man looked at her
and said, 'I ought to wup you, nigger,' and then
went back to beating the Rabbi.
"AS I RETURNED to the top of the embank
ment, the Rabbi was kneeling, and blood was
streaming from an eye wound and a wound on the
back of his head. I helped him to his feet and the
five of us moved down the tracks trying to get
help. As we came to the first street which crossed
the tracks and proceeded into the Negro commu
nity . . . the truck . . . came up behind us and
attempted to kill us by running us down.
"The Rabbi, who was standing, slightly dazed,
closest to the man, was bleeding profusely. I
stepped to the Rabbi's right and said, 'Haven't you
hurt him enough?' The man didn't stop, and raised
his weapon and hit the Rabbi again. I shielded the
blow with my left forearm. This is where I in
curred my major injury.
"AT THE HOSPITAL . . . the local police came
in to question us. . . . They found time to have
two private jokes between them while the Rabbi
was still in such terrible condition.
"Profesor Pease was at a Volkswagen repair
shop in Hattiesburg when the news came over the
radio. . . . Five white mechanics let out a cheer."
(Postscript: All three workers recovered from
their beating. A month later, two men, Estes
Keyes and Clinton Hayes, were convicted of the
attack. They were fined $500 and 90 days at hard
labor. Both sentences were suspended.)

whites armed with iron pipes. Spears described the
beating in a letter to his family.

stepped to the left. The younger man with the
iron rod stepped toward me . . . and started beat
me with the iron rod about the head and shoiil
