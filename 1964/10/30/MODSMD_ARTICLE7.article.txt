# Terror At 10:50: McComb Bombings
## 
### 
Editor's Note: Since June 21, the
Negro community of McComb,
Mississippi, has endured 17 bomb
ings, 2 church burnings, a dozen
or more eases ol' assault, and 3 J
arrests. 14 of the arrests were
made under Mississippi's Crimi
nal Syndicalism Law after a
group of anguished McComb Ne
groes gathered in the streets to
protest a double bombing t li a t
occurred on August 20. The fol
lowing is an eye-witness account,
written by a S'NCC Field worker,
of that incident.
The first bombing comes at
10:150. Most of the Negroes of Mc-
Comb are in bed — but only some
are sleeping.
These days most Negro adults
don't fall asleep until the wee
hours of the morning.
Then the blast. That sickening,
anguishing sound that Negroes in
McComb have come to know so
well. And everyone in McComb
hears the sound of the blast
McComb is a small town and
very, very quiet.
THIS NIGHT the sound of the
blast is heard for the 13th time—•

I and shortly later for the 14th
time.
I Tonight the sound is more an
guishing — for the pain grows
worse with each bombing. Every
Negro in McComb knows w hat
the sound means. And then the
moments of torment that follow
—whose house, who is dead? It's
i not mine. Then who?.
i Who? And one's stomach aches
with pain and the pain seeps up
into the chest and the head and
comes out of every paw. Who? Is
someone dead? The fear and the
suspense grows — the anguish
becomes unbearable. People grab
whatever clothing they can find
and run out into the streets.
PEOPLE QUICKLY learn the
news — it's Mama Quinn's house.
It couldn't be worse. Everyone
loves Mama Quinn. She owns a
popular cafe. She is kind and good
to everyone. Bui more than that,
she is a towering figure of
strength. Shc.can't be intimidated.
And so it was Mama Quinn—
and it couldn't be worse. It comes
at 10:50. And two little children
are hurt. The house is almost de
molished. They weren't out to
frighten tonight. Mama Quinn
was to be killed.
How much can a human being
take?
AND IN THE midst of the pain
and anguish, comes the second
thud. It's on the other side of
town. Who now?
The police stride in. The Ne
groes crowd in the street, brood
ing, anguishing. To the police this
is a mob. So they tell the press:
3,000 Negroes gather in the
streets: Yet the entire Negro pop
ulation of McComb is just over
3,000. This doesn't matter. Paint
a picture of rioting Negroes. This
is what tlie press will pick up.
And so Mike Wallace calmly
and objectively explains to morn
ing national TV viewers that last
night the Negroes of McComb re
acted with violence — the rest
to "two bombings" follows, but is
not heard. And so the story of
the murder of a community goes
untold.

she is a towering figure of
strength. Shc.can't be intimidated.
And so it was Mama Quinn—
and it couldn't be worse. It comes
at 10:50. And two little children
are hurt. The house is almost de
molished. They weren't out to
frighten tonight. Mama Quinn
was to be killed.
How much can a human being
take?
AND IN THE midst of the pain
and anguish, comes the second
thud. It's on the other side of
town. Who now?
The police stride in. The Ne
groes crowd in the street, brood
ing, anguishing. To the police this
is a mob. So they tell the press:
3,000 Negroes gather in the
streets: Yet the entire Negro pop
ulation of McComb is just over
3,000. This doesn't matter. Paint
a picture of rioting Negroes. This
is what tlie press will pick up.
And so Mike Wallace calmly
and objectively explains to morn
ing national TV viewers that last
night the Negroes of McComb re
acted with violence — the rest
to "two bombings" follows, but is
not heard. And so the story of
the murder of a community goes
untold.
Editor's Note: Since June 21, the
Negro community of McComb,
Mississippi, has endured 17 bomb
ings, 2 church burnings, a dozen
or more eases ol' assault, and 3 J
arrests. 14 of the arrests were
made under Mississippi's Crimi
nal Syndicalism Law after a
group of anguished McComb Ne
groes gathered in the streets to
protest a double bombing t li a t
occurred on August 20. The fol
lowing is an eye-witness account,
written by a S'NCC Field worker,
of that incident.
The first bombing comes at
10:150. Most of the Negroes of Mc-
Comb are in bed — but only some
are sleeping.
These days most Negro adults
don't fall asleep until the wee
hours of the morning.
Then the blast. That sickening,
anguishing sound that Negroes in
McComb have come to know so
well. And everyone in McComb
hears the sound of the blast
McComb is a small town and
very, very quiet.
THIS NIGHT the sound of the
blast is heard for the 13th time—•

I and shortly later for the 14th
time.
I Tonight the sound is more an
guishing — for the pain grows
worse with each bombing. Every
Negro in McComb knows w hat
the sound means. And then the
moments of torment that follow
—whose house, who is dead? It's
i not mine. Then who?.
i Who? And one's stomach aches
with pain and the pain seeps up
into the chest and the head and
comes out of every paw. Who? Is
someone dead? The fear and the
suspense grows — the anguish
becomes unbearable. People grab
whatever clothing they can find
and run out into the streets.
PEOPLE QUICKLY learn the
news — it's Mama Quinn's house.
It couldn't be worse. Everyone
loves Mama Quinn. She owns a
popular cafe. She is kind and good
to everyone. Bui more than that,
she is a towering figure of
strength. Shc.can't be intimidated.
And so it was Mama Quinn—
and it couldn't be worse. It comes
at 10:50. And two little children
are hurt. The house is almost de
