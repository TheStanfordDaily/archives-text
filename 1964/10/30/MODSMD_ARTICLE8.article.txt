# Mississippi: The South's "Closed Society"
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
Up to the present time, Mis
sissippians have shown little abil
ity to handle the racial problems
of the state, or even to admit that
there exists a problem. Almost
alone in the South, they have re
fused to accept the inevitability
of integration, and so far if the
option today in the South is
peaceable integration or violence,
they have chosen the latter. For
Mississippi today is what has
been termed by Professor James
W. Silver, "The Closed Society."
SILVER, A MEMBER of the
faculty of the University of Mis
sissippi, maintains that within
the state, the ingredients for mak
ing a correction decision — an
enlightened electorate and an in- j
telligent leadership — are lacking, j
because "freedom of inquiry and
expression have not been toler-1
ated. Criticism of the reigning
orthodoxy has resulted in expul
sion of the critic and the imposi
tion of the smothering hand of
conformity on the society."
Mississippians, Silver believes,
suffer a distorted view of Missis
sippi's past and present, a view
that is reinforced by an "almost
absolute support of the status
quo by the makers of public opin
ion, the pulpit, and the politi
cians."
The most extreme view of the J
racial problems of the state is j
held by white supremacy groups j
such as the Citizen's Councils, an j
organization founded in Indian-j
ola following the Supreme Court j
school decision of 1954 and since
widely spread throughout the
deep south. One pamphlet p u b
lished by the Council includes tlie
following facts:
"THE TIME honored and his
tory proven custom of segrega
tion has been a major factor in
the South's great progress since
'Reconstruction.'"
"Segregation has kept racial
friction at a minimum allowing
both races to progress peace
fully."
"Miscegenation has been a fac
tor in the decline of past civiliza
tions such as Egypt, Greece,
Rome, India and Portugal."
"The perfect solution to the race
problem would be geographical
separation but the best alterna- j
tive is neighborhood and social
separation."
"The races of man are the
handiwork of God, as is every
thing in nature. If He had wanted
only one type of man, He would :
have created only one."
While in other parts of the
country, an organization main
taining such beliefs might be con
sidered extreme, the Councils are
quite numerous and quite power
fid in Mississippi. According to <
COFO, at least ten of the 53
members of the Mississippi state i
Senate are Council members, in
cluding the president pro tem,
and 19 out of 122 members of the '
House, including 11 committee- i
men chairmen. ]
SILVER, IN HIS book Missis
sippi: The Closed Society, points
out the power of the Councils, l
quoting a legislator as saying, i
"When the bill came up in the i
House to give cities and counties
authority to make donations to <
the Citizens Councils, I thought <
it was unconstitutional. Rut 1 I
voted for it because if I had voted <
against the Councils, Bill Sim- i
mons (national administrator of <
the Citizens Councils of America) \
would brand me as an integra- <

I tionist."
The Ku Klux Klan is another
large segregationist organization
in the stte, claiming, according
• to SNCC, nearly 100,000 mem
; bers, and control of one third of
the state's votes.
The press in Mississippi, for
the most part supports the stan
dard view of the closed society to
r ward segregation and civil rights.
> One paper, following the arrest
. of Byron La Beckwith for the
murder of Medgar Evers, ran the

headline "Californian Is Charged
With Murder of Evers." Beckwith
was the son of an old Mississippi
family, and although he had been
born in California, he had lived in
Mississippi for 38 years.
SILVER CHARGES that "The
Mississippi press mounts vigilant
guard over the racial, economic,
political, and religious orthodoxy
of the closed society. Despite vary
ing degrees of moderation ex
pressed in the daily papers of
Greenville, Tupelo, McComb, and,

until recently, Pascagoula, and
in an occasional rural weekly, the
extremist Jackson Clarion-Ledger
and the Daily News dominate
Mississippi thought. . . . Only a
constant and critical reader of
the capital press would believe
the extent to which news is ma
nipulated. Negro crime and im
morality in the North, Negro com
plicity in Communism, and even
Negro support of the present
Governor are given the headlines
day after day."
In return, Silver is not too pop
ular with the local Mississippi
press. Following the speech in
Asheville, North Carolina, which
was the basis for his hook. Silver
received the following coverage
in the Clarion-Ledger:
"Dr. Jim Silver, longtime his
tory professor at Ole Miss, spoke
in Asheville, N.C., Thursday night.
Press wire reports he abused the
state of Mississippi, its people,
officials and newspapers in the
same fashion he has in previous
speeches in Atlanta, Memphis, and
and other points."
THE RESULT of this "closed
society," Silver feels, is that Mis
sissippi is taking the wrong ap
proach toward the solutions o'
its problems. He says,"The mr
jority in Mississippi was wron
in 1961, and the minority pei
haps thirty per cent was righl
The majority has been wronr
many times since. This has been
due in part to ignorance, lack of
good leadership, and also to the
exclusion of the non-conformist.
The riots at the University of
Mississippi were what disturbed
Silver the most. Not only does he
feel that the closed society
created the atmosphere which
made the riots likely, but that
after they had occurred, it "in
tuitively and immediately pro
jected the orthodox version that
the insurrection came as the in
evitable result of federal en
croachment, deliberately planned
by the Kennedys and callously in
cited by MeShane, the Chief Mar
shal, when he called for tear gas."

He adds, "cleverness in shifting i
the culpability for defiance of
law from those creating the vio
lence to those enforcing the law j
could only succeed among a '
people suffering from a touch of j
paranoia."
WHITE SUPREMACY in the
state, Silver believes, is based on i
a whole series of descredited as-1
sumptions: "the biological a n d
anthropological 'proof' of Negro
inferiority"; "the presumed sanc
tion of God as extrapolated from

the Bible"; "the present state of
affairs as one that is desired and
endorsed by Negroes and whites
alike"; the repeated assurance
that only through segregation can
law and order prevail"; a view of
history which declares that there
has been a century of satisfactory
racial experience in Mississippi";
a constitutional interpretation
which denies the validity of the
Supreme Court desegregation de
cisions." Silver adds that nearly
everybody in the civilized world

has long since abandoned those
premises.
Beyond those believes, the so
ciety is further supported by a
distortion of both the past history
of the state, and of the present.
In addition. Silver says, "Every
lawmaking body and every law
enforcing agency is completely
in the hands of those whites who
are faithful to the orthodoxy.
From governor to constable, from
chief justice to justice of the
peace, each of every office of the
society is dedicated to upholding
and maintaining the status quo
by whatever means are necessary
. . . The non-conformist learns the
advisability of keeping his mouth
shut, or is silenced in one way
or another, or he finds it expedi
ent to depart the state."
SILVKR HAS, himself, been
subject to some pressure. Gover
nor Ross Barnett said of him,
"Old Silver is liable to say any
thing. He should have been kicked
out long ago." Congressman John
Bell Williams commented, "Sil
ver has been biting the hand that
fed him for twenty-eight years.
It's time to get rid of him."
Despite the occasional voice of
lissent in the state, Silver be
lieves that there is liltle hope
hat the state can, by itself, rc
'orm. "As yet there is little evi
lenee that the closed society will
aver possess the moral resources
to reform itself, or the capacity
for self-examination, or even the
tolerance of self-examination. In
asmuch as a nation marching
vith deliberate speed toward the
'ulfillment of the promise of the
Declaration of Independence and
the Emancipation Proclamation
is at the same time fighting for
survival against communism, it
will not much longer indulge the
frustration of its will. Neverthe
'ess. it would seem that for the
foreseeable future the people of
! Mississippi will plod along the
| troubled road of resistance, vio
! lenee, anguish, and injustice, mov
ing slowly until engulfed in a
i predieable cataclysm."


IT'S A SHAME to ! ive in a nation that can supply a good deal of !
j the world's needs and cannot supply rural Mississippi."

Mississippi for 38 years.
SILVER CHARGES that "The
Mississippi press mounts vigilant
guard over the racial, economic,
political, and religious orthodoxy
of the closed society. Despite vary
ing degrees of moderation ex
pressed in the daily papers of
Greenville, Tupelo, McComb, and,

until recently, Pascagoula, and
in an occasional rural weekly, the
extremist Jackson Clarion-Ledger
and the Daily News dominate
Mississippi thought. . . . Only a
constant and critical reader of
the capital press would believe
the extent to which news is ma
nipulated. Negro crime and im
morality in the North, Negro com
plicity in Communism, and even
Negro support of the present
Governor are given the headlines
day after day."
In return, Silver is not too pop
ular with the local Mississippi
press. Following the speech in
Asheville, North Carolina, which
was the basis for his hook. Silver
received the following coverage
in the Clarion-Ledger:
"Dr. Jim Silver, longtime his
tory professor at Ole Miss, spoke
in Asheville, N.C., Thursday night.
Press wire reports he abused the
state of Mississippi, its people,
officials and newspapers in the
same fashion he has in previous
speeches in Atlanta, Memphis, and
and other points."
THE RESULT of this "closed
society," Silver feels, is that Mis
sissippi is taking the wrong ap
proach toward the solutions o'
its problems. He says,"The mr
jority in Mississippi was wron
in 1961, and the minority pei
haps thirty per cent was righl
The majority has been wronr
many times since. This has been
due in part to ignorance, lack of
good leadership, and also to the
exclusion of the non-conformist.
The riots at the University of
Mississippi were what disturbed
Silver the most. Not only does he
feel that the closed society
created the atmosphere which
made the riots likely, but that
after they had occurred, it "in
tuitively and immediately pro
jected the orthodox version that
the insurrection came as the in
evitable result of federal en
croachment, deliberately planned
by the Kennedys and callously in
cited by MeShane, the Chief Mar
shal, when he called for tear gas."

He adds, "cleverness in shifting i
the culpability for defiance of
law from those creating the vio
lence to those enforcing the law j
could only succeed among a '
people suffering from a touch of j
paranoia."
WHITE SUPREMACY in the
state, Silver believes, is based on i
a whole series of descredited as-1
sumptions: "the biological a n d
anthropological 'proof' of Negro
inferiority"; "the presumed sanc
tion of God as extrapolated from

the Bible"; "the present state of
affairs as one that is desired and
endorsed by Negroes and whites
alike"; the repeated assurance
that only through segregation can
law and order prevail"; a view of
history which declares that there
has been a century of satisfactory
racial experience in Mississippi";
a constitutional interpretation
which denies the validity of the
Supreme Court desegregation de
cisions." Silver adds that nearly
everybody in the civilized world

has long since abandoned those
premises.
Beyond those believes, the so
ciety is further supported by a
distortion of both the past history
of the state, and of the present.
In addition. Silver says, "Every
lawmaking body and every law
enforcing agency is completely
in the hands of those whites who
are faithful to the orthodoxy.
From governor to constable, from
chief justice to justice of the
peace, each of every office of the
society is dedicated to upholding
and maintaining the status quo
by whatever means are necessary
. . . The non-conformist learns the
advisability of keeping his mouth
shut, or is silenced in one way
or another, or he finds it expedi
ent to depart the state."
SILVKR HAS, himself, been
subject to some pressure. Gover
nor Ross Barnett said of him,
"Old Silver is liable to say any
thing. He should have been kicked
out long ago." Congressman John
Bell Williams commented, "Sil
ver has been biting the hand that
fed him for twenty-eight years.
It's time to get rid of him."
Despite the occasional voice of
lissent in the state, Silver be
lieves that there is liltle hope
hat the state can, by itself, rc
'orm. "As yet there is little evi
lenee that the closed society will
aver possess the moral resources
to reform itself, or the capacity
for self-examination, or even the
tolerance of self-examination. In
asmuch as a nation marching
vith deliberate speed toward the
'ulfillment of the promise of the
Declaration of Independence and
the Emancipation Proclamation
is at the same time fighting for
survival against communism, it
will not much longer indulge the
frustration of its will. Neverthe
'ess. it would seem that for the
foreseeable future the people of
! Mississippi will plod along the
| troubled road of resistance, vio
! lenee, anguish, and injustice, mov
ing slowly until engulfed in a
i predieable cataclysm."

j the world's needs and cannot supply rural Mississippi."


"YOU SEE a face completely defeated, completely bitter and you

Up to the present time, Mis
sissippians have shown little abil
ity to handle the racial problems
of the state, or even to admit that
there exists a problem. Almost
alone in the South, they have re
fused to accept the inevitability
of integration, and so far if the
option today in the South is
peaceable integration or violence,
they have chosen the latter. For
Mississippi today is what has
been termed by Professor James
W. Silver, "The Closed Society."
SILVER, A MEMBER of the
faculty of the University of Mis
sissippi, maintains that within
the state, the ingredients for mak
ing a correction decision — an
enlightened electorate and an in- j
telligent leadership — are lacking, j
because "freedom of inquiry and
expression have not been toler-1
ated. Criticism of the reigning
orthodoxy has resulted in expul
sion of the critic and the imposi
tion of the smothering hand of
conformity on the society."
Mississippians, Silver believes,
suffer a distorted view of Missis
sippi's past and present, a view
that is reinforced by an "almost
absolute support of the status
quo by the makers of public opin
ion, the pulpit, and the politi
cians."
The most extreme view of the J
racial problems of the state is j
held by white supremacy groups j
such as the Citizen's Councils, an j
organization founded in Indian-j
ola following the Supreme Court j
school decision of 1954 and since
widely spread throughout the
deep south. One pamphlet p u b
lished by the Council includes tlie
following facts:
"THE TIME honored and his
tory proven custom of segrega
tion has been a major factor in
the South's great progress since
'Reconstruction.'"
"Segregation has kept racial
friction at a minimum allowing
both races to progress peace
fully."
"Miscegenation has been a fac
tor in the decline of past civiliza
tions such as Egypt, Greece,
Rome, India and Portugal."
"The perfect solution to the race
problem would be geographical
separation but the best alterna- j
tive is neighborhood and social
separation."
"The races of man are the
handiwork of God, as is every
thing in nature. If He had wanted
only one type of man, He would :
have created only one."
While in other parts of the
country, an organization main
taining such beliefs might be con
sidered extreme, the Councils are
quite numerous and quite power
fid in Mississippi. According to <
COFO, at least ten of the 53
members of the Mississippi state i
Senate are Council members, in
cluding the president pro tem,
and 19 out of 122 members of the '
House, including 11 committee- i
men chairmen. ]
SILVER, IN HIS book Missis
sippi: The Closed Society, points
out the power of the Councils, l
quoting a legislator as saying, i
"When the bill came up in the i
House to give cities and counties
authority to make donations to <
the Citizens Councils, I thought <
it was unconstitutional. Rut 1 I
voted for it because if I had voted <
against the Councils, Bill Sim- i
mons (national administrator of <
the Citizens Councils of America) \
would brand me as an integra- <

I tionist."
The Ku Klux Klan is another
large segregationist organization
in the stte, claiming, according
• to SNCC, nearly 100,000 mem
; bers, and control of one third of
the state's votes.

the most part supports the stan

lawmaking body and every law
enforcing agency is completely
in the hands of those whites who
are faithful to the orthodoxy.
From governor to constable, from
chief justice to justice of the
peace, each of every office of the
society is dedicated to upholding
and maintaining the status quo
by whatever means are necessary
. . . The non-conformist learns the
advisability of keeping his mouth
shut, or is silenced in one way
or another, or he finds it expedi
ent to depart the state."
SILVKR HAS, himself, been
subject to some pressure. Gover
nor Ross Barnett said of him,
"Old Silver is liable to say any
thing. He should have been kicked
out long ago." Congressman John
Bell Williams commented, "Sil
ver has been biting the hand that
fed him for twenty-eight years.
It's time to get rid of him."
Despite the occasional voice of
lissent in the state, Silver be
lieves that there is liltle hope
hat the state can, by itself, rc
'orm. "As yet there is little evi
lenee that the closed society will
aver possess the moral resources
to reform itself, or the capacity
for self-examination, or even the
tolerance of self-examination. In
asmuch as a nation marching

"YOU SEE a face completely defeated, completely bitter and you

Up to the present time, Mis
sissippians have shown little abil
ity to handle the racial problems
of the state, or even to admit that
there exists a problem. Almost
alone in the South, they have re
fused to accept the inevitability
of integration, and so far if the
option today in the South is
peaceable integration or violence,
they have chosen the latter. For
Mississippi today is what has
been termed by Professor James
W. Silver, "The Closed Society."
SILVER, A MEMBER of the
faculty of the University of Mis
sissippi, maintains that within
the state, the ingredients for mak
ing a correction decision — an
enlightened electorate and an in- j
telligent leadership — are lacking, j
because "freedom of inquiry and
expression have not been toler-1
ated. Criticism of the reigning
orthodoxy has resulted in expul
sion of the critic and the imposi
tion of the smothering hand of
conformity on the society."
Mississippians, Silver believes,
suffer a distorted view of Missis
sippi's past and present, a view
that is reinforced by an "almost
absolute support of the status
quo by the makers of public opin
ion, the pulpit, and the politi
cians."
The most extreme view of the J
racial problems of the state is j
held by white supremacy groups j
such as the Citizen's Councils, an j
organization founded in Indian-j
ola following the Supreme Court j
school decision of 1954 and since
widely spread throughout the
deep south. One pamphlet p u b
lished by the Council includes tlie
following facts:
"THE TIME honored and his
tory proven custom of segrega
tion has been a major factor in
the South's great progress since
'Reconstruction.'"
"Segregation has kept racial
friction at a minimum allowing
both races to progress peace
fully."
"Miscegenation has been a fac
tor in the decline of past civiliza
tions such as Egypt, Greece,
Rome, India and Portugal."
"The perfect solution to the race
problem would be geographical
separation but the best alterna- j
tive is neighborhood and social
separation."
"The races of man are the
handiwork of God, as is every
thing in nature. If He had wanted
only one type of man, He would :
have created only one."
While in other parts of the
country, an organization main
taining such beliefs might be con
sidered extreme, the Councils are
quite numerous and quite power
fid in Mississippi. According to <
COFO, at least ten of the 53
members of the Mississippi state i
Senate are Council members, in
cluding the president pro tem,
and 19 out of 122 members of the '
House, including 11 committee- i
men chairmen. ]
SILVER, IN HIS book Missis
sippi: The Closed Society, points
out the power of the Councils, l
quoting a legislator as saying, i
"When the bill came up in the i
House to give cities and counties
authority to make donations to <
the Citizens Councils, I thought <
it was unconstitutional. Rut 1 I
voted for it because if I had voted <
against the Councils, Bill Sim- i
mons (national administrator of <
the Citizens Councils of America) \
would brand me as an integra- <

I tionist."
The Ku Klux Klan is another
large segregationist organization
in the stte, claiming, according
• to SNCC, nearly 100,000 mem
; bers, and control of one third of
the state's votes.
The press in Mississippi, for
the most part supports the stan
dard view of the closed society to
r ward segregation and civil rights.
> One paper, following the arrest
. of Byron La Beckwith for the
murder of Medgar Evers, ran the

headline "Californian Is Charged
With Murder of Evers." Beckwith
was the son of an old Mississippi
family, and although he had been
born in California, he had lived in
Mississippi for 38 years.
SILVER CHARGES that "The
Mississippi press mounts vigilant
guard over the racial, economic,
political, and religious orthodoxy
of the closed society. Despite vary
ing degrees of moderation ex
pressed in the daily papers of
Greenville, Tupelo, McComb, and,

until recently, Pascagoula, and
in an occasional rural weekly, the
extremist Jackson Clarion-Ledger
and the Daily News dominate
Mississippi thought. . . . Only a
constant and critical reader of
the capital press would believe
the extent to which news is ma
nipulated. Negro crime and im
morality in the North, Negro com
plicity in Communism, and even
Negro support of the present
Governor are given the headlines
day after day."
In return, Silver is not too pop
ular with the local Mississippi
press. Following the speech in
Asheville, North Carolina, which
was the basis for his hook. Silver
received the following coverage
in the Clarion-Ledger:
"Dr. Jim Silver, longtime his
tory professor at Ole Miss, spoke
in Asheville, N.C., Thursday night.
Press wire reports he abused the
state of Mississippi, its people,
officials and newspapers in the
same fashion he has in previous
speeches in Atlanta, Memphis, and
and other points."
THE RESULT of this "closed
society," Silver feels, is that Mis
sissippi is taking the wrong ap
proach toward the solutions o'
its problems. He says,"The mr
jority in Mississippi was wron
in 1961, and the minority pei
haps thirty per cent was righl
The majority has been wronr
many times since. This has been
due in part to ignorance, lack of
good leadership, and also to the
exclusion of the non-conformist.
The riots at the University of
Mississippi were what disturbed
Silver the most. Not only does he
feel that the closed society
created the atmosphere which
made the riots likely, but that
after they had occurred, it "in
tuitively and immediately pro
jected the orthodox version that
the insurrection came as the in
evitable result of federal en
croachment, deliberately planned
by the Kennedys and callously in
cited by MeShane, the Chief Mar
shal, when he called for tear gas."

He adds, "cleverness in shifting i
the culpability for defiance of
law from those creating the vio
lence to those enforcing the law j
could only succeed among a '
people suffering from a touch of j
paranoia."
WHITE SUPREMACY in the
state, Silver believes, is based on i
a whole series of descredited as-1
sumptions: "the biological a n d
anthropological 'proof' of Negro
inferiority"; "the presumed sanc
tion of God as extrapolated from

the Bible"; "the present state of
affairs as one that is desired and
endorsed by Negroes and whites
alike"; the repeated assurance
that only through segregation can
law and order prevail"; a view of
history which declares that there
has been a century of satisfactory
racial experience in Mississippi";
a constitutional interpretation
which denies the validity of the
Supreme Court desegregation de
cisions." Silver adds that nearly
everybody in the civilized world

has long since abandoned those
premises.
Beyond those believes, the so
ciety is further supported by a
distortion of both the past history
of the state, and of the present.
In addition. Silver says, "Every
lawmaking body and every law
enforcing agency is completely
in the hands of those whites who

"The races of man are the

While in other parts of the
country, an organization main

sidered extreme, the Councils are
quite numerous and quite power
fid in Mississippi. According to <
COFO, at least ten of the 53
members of the Mississippi state i
Senate are Council members, in
cluding the president pro tem,
and 19 out of 122 members of the '
House, including 11 committee- i
men chairmen. ]

sippi: The Closed Society, points
out the power of the Councils, l
quoting a legislator as saying, i
"When the bill came up in the i
House to give cities and counties
authority to make donations to <
the Citizens Councils, I thought <
it was unconstitutional. Rut 1 I
voted for it because if I had voted <

would brand me as an integra- <

The Ku Klux Klan is another
large segregationist organization
in the stte, claiming, according
• to SNCC, nearly 100,000 mem
; bers, and control of one third of
the state's votes.
The press in Mississippi, for
the most part supports the stan
dard view of the closed society to
r ward segregation and civil rights.
> One paper, following the arrest
. of Byron La Beckwith for the
murder of Medgar Evers, ran the

headline "Californian Is Charged
With Murder of Evers." Beckwith
was the son of an old Mississippi
family, and although he had been
born in California, he had lived in
Mississippi for 38 years.
SILVER CHARGES that "The
Mississippi press mounts vigilant
guard over the racial, economic,
political, and religious orthodoxy
of the closed society. Despite vary
ing degrees of moderation ex
pressed in the daily papers of
Greenville, Tupelo, McComb, and,

until recently, Pascagoula, and
in an occasional rural weekly, the
extremist Jackson Clarion-Ledger
and the Daily News dominate
Mississippi thought. . . . Only a
constant and critical reader of
the capital press would believe
the extent to which news is ma
nipulated. Negro crime and im
morality in the North, Negro com
plicity in Communism, and even
Negro support of the present
Governor are given the headlines
day after day."
In return, Silver is not too pop
ular with the local Mississippi
press. Following the speech in
Asheville, North Carolina, which
was the basis for his hook. Silver
received the following coverage
in the Clarion-Ledger:
"Dr. Jim Silver, longtime his
tory professor at Ole Miss, spoke
in Asheville, N.C., Thursday night.
Press wire reports he abused the
state of Mississippi, its people,
officials and newspapers in the
same fashion he has in previous
speeches in Atlanta, Memphis, and
and other points."
THE RESULT of this "closed
society," Silver feels, is that Mis
sissippi is taking the wrong ap
proach toward the solutions o'
its problems. He says,"The mr
jority in Mississippi was wron
in 1961, and the minority pei
haps thirty per cent was righl
The majority has been wronr
many times since. This has been
due in part to ignorance, lack of
good leadership, and also to the
exclusion of the non-conformist.
The riots at the University of
Mississippi were what disturbed
Silver the most. Not only does he
feel that the closed society
created the atmosphere which
made the riots likely, but that
after they had occurred, it "in
tuitively and immediately pro
jected the orthodox version that
the insurrection came as the in
evitable result of federal en
croachment, deliberately planned
by the Kennedys and callously in
cited by MeShane, the Chief Mar
shal, when he called for tear gas."

He adds, "cleverness in shifting i
the culpability for defiance of
law from those creating the vio
lence to those enforcing the law j
could only succeed among a '
people suffering from a touch of j
paranoia."
WHITE SUPREMACY in the
state, Silver believes, is based on i
a whole series of descredited as-1
sumptions: "the biological a n d
anthropological 'proof' of Negro
inferiority"; "the presumed sanc
tion of God as extrapolated from

the Bible"; "the present state of
affairs as one that is desired and
endorsed by Negroes and whites
alike"; the repeated assurance
that only through segregation can
law and order prevail"; a view of
history which declares that there
has been a century of satisfactory
racial experience in Mississippi";
a constitutional interpretation
which denies the validity of the
Supreme Court desegregation de
cisions." Silver adds that nearly
everybody in the civilized world

has long since abandoned those
premises.
Beyond those believes, the so
ciety is further supported by a
distortion of both the past history
of the state, and of the present.
In addition. Silver says, "Every
lawmaking body and every law
enforcing agency is completely
in the hands of those whites who
are faithful to the orthodoxy.
From governor to constable, from
chief justice to justice of the
peace, each of every office of the
society is dedicated to upholding
and maintaining the status quo
by whatever means are necessary
. . . The non-conformist learns the
advisability of keeping his mouth
shut, or is silenced in one way
or another, or he finds it expedi
ent to depart the state."
SILVKR HAS, himself, been
subject to some pressure. Gover
nor Ross Barnett said of him,
"Old Silver is liable to say any
thing. He should have been kicked
out long ago." Congressman John
Bell Williams commented, "Sil
ver has been biting the hand that
fed him for twenty-eight years.
It's time to get rid of him."
Despite the occasional voice of
lissent in the state, Silver be
lieves that there is liltle hope
hat the state can, by itself, rc
'orm. "As yet there is little evi
lenee that the closed society will
aver possess the moral resources
to reform itself, or the capacity
for self-examination, or even the
tolerance of self-examination. In
asmuch as a nation marching
vith deliberate speed toward the
'ulfillment of the promise of the
Declaration of Independence and
the Emancipation Proclamation
is at the same time fighting for
survival against communism, it
will not much longer indulge the
frustration of its will. Neverthe
'ess. it would seem that for the
foreseeable future the people of
! Mississippi will plod along the
| troubled road of resistance, vio
! lenee, anguish, and injustice, mov
ing slowly until engulfed in a
i predieable cataclysm."

j the world's needs and cannot supply rural Mississippi."

Up to the present time, Mis
sissippians have shown little abil
ity to handle the racial problems
of the state, or even to admit that
there exists a problem. Almost
alone in the South, they have re
fused to accept the inevitability
of integration, and so far if the
option today in the South is
peaceable integration or violence,
they have chosen the latter. For
Mississippi today is what has
been termed by Professor James
W. Silver, "The Closed Society."
SILVER, A MEMBER of the
faculty of the University of Mis
sissippi, maintains that within
the state, the ingredients for mak
ing a correction decision — an
enlightened electorate and an in- j
telligent leadership — are lacking, j
because "freedom of inquiry and
expression have not been toler-1
ated. Criticism of the reigning
orthodoxy has resulted in expul
sion of the critic and the imposi
tion of the smothering hand of
conformity on the society."
Mississippians, Silver believes,
suffer a distorted view of Missis
sippi's past and present, a view
that is reinforced by an "almost
absolute support of the status
quo by the makers of public opin
ion, the pulpit, and the politi
cians."
The most extreme view of the J
racial problems of the state is j
held by white supremacy groups j
such as the Citizen's Councils, an j
organization founded in Indian-j
ola following the Supreme Court j
school decision of 1954 and since
widely spread throughout the
deep south. One pamphlet p u b
lished by the Council includes tlie
following facts:
"THE TIME honored and his
tory proven custom of segrega
tion has been a major factor in
the South's great progress since
'Reconstruction.'"
"Segregation has kept racial
friction at a minimum allowing
both races to progress peace
fully."
"Miscegenation has been a fac

its problems. He says,"The mr
jority in Mississippi was wron
in 1961, and the minority pei
haps thirty per cent was righl
The majority has been wronr
many times since. This has been
due in part to ignorance, lack of
good leadership, and also to the
exclusion of the non-conformist.
The riots at the University of
Mississippi were what disturbed
Silver the most. Not only does he
feel that the closed society
created the atmosphere which
made the riots likely, but that
after they had occurred, it "in
tuitively and immediately pro
jected the orthodox version that
the insurrection came as the in
evitable result of federal en
croachment, deliberately planned
by the Kennedys and callously in
cited by MeShane, the Chief Mar
shal, when he called for tear gas."

He adds, "cleverness in shifting i
the culpability for defiance of
law from those creating the vio
lence to those enforcing the law j
could only succeed among a '
people suffering from a touch of j
paranoia."
WHITE SUPREMACY in the
state, Silver believes, is based on i
a whole series of descredited as-1
sumptions: "the biological a n d
anthropological 'proof' of Negro
inferiority"; "the presumed sanc
tion of God as extrapolated from

the Bible"; "the present state of
affairs as one that is desired and
endorsed by Negroes and whites
alike"; the repeated assurance
that only through segregation can
law and order prevail"; a view of
history which declares that there
has been a century of satisfactory
racial experience in Mississippi";
a constitutional interpretation
which denies the validity of the
Supreme Court desegregation de
cisions." Silver adds that nearly
everybody in the civilized world

has long since abandoned those
premises.
Beyond those believes, the so
ciety is further supported by a
distortion of both the past history
of the state, and of the present.
In addition. Silver says, "Every
lawmaking body and every law
enforcing agency is completely
in the hands of those whites who
are faithful to the orthodoxy.
From governor to constable, from
chief justice to justice of the
peace, each of every office of the
society is dedicated to upholding
and maintaining the status quo
by whatever means are necessary
. . . The non-conformist learns the
advisability of keeping his mouth
shut, or is silenced in one way
or another, or he finds it expedi
ent to depart the state."
SILVKR HAS, himself, been
subject to some pressure. Gover
nor Ross Barnett said of him,
"Old Silver is liable to say any
thing. He should have been kicked
out long ago." Congressman John
Bell Williams commented, "Sil
ver has been biting the hand that
fed him for twenty-eight years.
It's time to get rid of him."
Despite the occasional voice of
lissent in the state, Silver be
lieves that there is liltle hope
hat the state can, by itself, rc
'orm. "As yet there is little evi
lenee that the closed society will
aver possess the moral resources
to reform itself, or the capacity
for self-examination, or even the
tolerance of self-examination. In
asmuch as a nation marching
vith deliberate speed toward the
'ulfillment of the promise of the
Declaration of Independence and
the Emancipation Proclamation
is at the same time fighting for
survival against communism, it
will not much longer indulge the
frustration of its will. Neverthe
'ess. it would seem that for the
foreseeable future the people of
! Mississippi will plod along the
| troubled road of resistance, vio
! lenee, anguish, and injustice, mov
ing slowly until engulfed in a
i predieable cataclysm."


IT'S A SHAME to ! ive in a nation that can supply a good deal of !
j the world's needs and cannot supply rural Mississippi."


"YOU SEE a face completely defeated, completely bitter and you
have the feeling that deep inside there's a human being waiting
Up to the present time, Mis
sissippians have shown little abil
ity to handle the racial problems
of the state, or even to admit that
there exists a problem. Almost
alone in the South, they have re
fused to accept the inevitability
of integration, and so far if the
option today in the South is
peaceable integration or violence,
they have chosen the latter. For
Mississippi today is what has
been termed by Professor James
W. Silver, "The Closed Society."
SILVER, A MEMBER of the
faculty of the University of Mis
sissippi, maintains that within
the state, the ingredients for mak
ing a correction decision — an
enlightened electorate and an in- j
telligent leadership — are lacking, j
because "freedom of inquiry and
expression have not been toler-1
ated. Criticism of the reigning
orthodoxy has resulted in expul
sion of the critic and the imposi
tion of the smothering hand of
conformity on the society."
Mississippians, Silver believes,
suffer a distorted view of Missis
sippi's past and present, a view
that is reinforced by an "almost
absolute support of the status
quo by the makers of public opin
ion, the pulpit, and the politi
cians."
The most extreme view of the J
racial problems of the state is j
held by white supremacy groups j
such as the Citizen's Councils, an j
organization founded in Indian-j
ola following the Supreme Court j
school decision of 1954 and since
widely spread throughout the
deep south. One pamphlet p u b
lished by the Council includes tlie
following facts:
"THE TIME honored and his
tory proven custom of segrega
tion has been a major factor in
the South's great progress since
'Reconstruction.'"
"Segregation has kept racial
friction at a minimum allowing
both races to progress peace
fully."
"Miscegenation has been a fac
tor in the decline of past civiliza
tions such as Egypt, Greece,
Rome, India and Portugal."
"The perfect solution to the race
problem would be geographical
separation but the best alterna- j
tive is neighborhood and social
separation."
"The races of man are the
handiwork of God, as is every
thing in nature. If He had wanted
only one type of man, He would :
have created only one."
While in other parts of the
country, an organization main
taining such beliefs might be con
sidered extreme, the Councils are
quite numerous and quite power
fid in Mississippi. According to <
COFO, at least ten of the 53
members of the Mississippi state i
Senate are Council members, in
cluding the president pro tem,
and 19 out of 122 members of the '
House, including 11 committee- i
men chairmen. ]
SILVER, IN HIS book Missis
sippi: The Closed Society, points
out the power of the Councils, l
quoting a legislator as saying, i
"When the bill came up in the i
House to give cities and counties
authority to make donations to <
the Citizens Councils, I thought <
it was unconstitutional. Rut 1 I
voted for it because if I had voted <
against the Councils, Bill Sim- i
mons (national administrator of <
the Citizens Councils of America) \
would brand me as an integra- <

I tionist."
The Ku Klux Klan is another
large segregationist organization
in the stte, claiming, according
• to SNCC, nearly 100,000 mem
; bers, and control of one third of
the state's votes.
The press in Mississippi, for
the most part supports the stan
dard view of the closed society to
r ward segregation and civil rights.
> One paper, following the arrest
. of Byron La Beckwith for the
murder of Medgar Evers, ran the

headline "Californian Is Charged
With Murder of Evers." Beckwith
was the son of an old Mississippi
family, and although he had been
born in California, he had lived in
Mississippi for 38 years.
SILVER CHARGES that "The
Mississippi press mounts vigilant
guard over the racial, economic,
political, and religious orthodoxy
of the closed society. Despite vary
ing degrees of moderation ex
pressed in the daily papers of
Greenville, Tupelo, McComb, and,

until recently, Pascagoula, and
in an occasional rural weekly, the
extremist Jackson Clarion-Ledger
and the Daily News dominate
Mississippi thought. . . . Only a
constant and critical reader of
the capital press would believe
the extent to which news is ma
nipulated. Negro crime and im
morality in the North, Negro com
plicity in Communism, and even
Negro support of the present
Governor are given the headlines
day after day."
In return, Silver is not too pop
ular with the local Mississippi
press. Following the speech in
Asheville, North Carolina, which
was the basis for his hook. Silver
received the following coverage
in the Clarion-Ledger:
"Dr. Jim Silver, longtime his
tory professor at Ole Miss, spoke
in Asheville, N.C., Thursday night.
Press wire reports he abused the
state of Mississippi, its people,
officials and newspapers in the
same fashion he has in previous
speeches in Atlanta, Memphis, and
and other points."
THE RESULT of this "closed
society," Silver feels, is that Mis
sissippi is taking the wrong ap
proach toward the solutions o'
its problems. He says,"The mr
jority in Mississippi was wron
in 1961, and the minority pei
haps thirty per cent was righl
The majority has been wronr
many times since. This has been
due in part to ignorance, lack of
good leadership, and also to the
exclusion of the non-conformist.
The riots at the University of
Mississippi were what disturbed
Silver the most. Not only does he
feel that the closed society
created the atmosphere which
made the riots likely, but that
after they had occurred, it "in

jected the orthodox version that
