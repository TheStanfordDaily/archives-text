# Pease: Caste System Replaces Slavery

### 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Following
are excerpts from an essay writ
ten in July, 1964 by Otis Pease
of Stanford, entitled, "The De
velopment of Negro Power in
American Polities Since 1900."
The author, who was writing for
the Hattiesburg, Miss. Freedom
School, said in his introduction:
"This survey is one historian's
interpretation ... it makes no
claim for completeness or total
objectivity. I look for discussion,
argument, and even replies dis
tribuated similarly in a spirit of
dissent.")
"The present pattern of dis
crimination and prejudice against
the Negro was forged mainly in
the period from 1900 to 1930.
These years were a time of politi
cal reform and social advance
ment for most Americans, even
for immigrants and northern Ne
groes, but . . . they seem to have
been the most humiliating years
since slavery in the equal treat
ment of southern Negroes.
"WHERE THEY were once en
couraged to vote and hold minor
office . . . they were now kept
from voting by law, by private
coercion, and by habit . . . Where i
white and Negro southerners j
once rode and ate in the same
passenger cars .. . they were now j
excluded by local ordinance from ;

virtually every possible contact
i with white people. . . .
{ "Between 1896 and 1903 every
i southern stale possessing a sub
stantial Negro poplation
j amended their constitutions to
j permit official white primaries
I and to prohibit —- by ingenious
I laws — both Negroes and unco
operative poor whites from vot
ing. Note the graphic case of
Louisiana:
White Negro
1887 registration (old
constitution) 165,000 130,000
1900 registration (new
constitution) 125,000 5,000
1904 registration (poll
tax added) 92,000 1,300
. . LIBERALS North and
South commonly defended Negro
disenfranchiseme nt on
the grounds that political corrup
tion would disappear and that, by
forcing the Negro to concentrate
; on improving himself instead of
! increasing his power, race rela
j tions would qiuckly improve . . .
I But the political process remain-
I ed as corrupt as before and far
I less responsive to the growing
j needs of the social order.
"It is equally clear that in pro
portion to the Negro's loss of poli
| tical power his general security
and independence deteriorated.
I and unchecked violence to hi s

person and properly grew. A sys
tem of caste had in lime come to
replace the system of slavery . . .
"Before the 1890's the Negro
had hoped that occasional Federal
intervention would sustain his
newly won rights of citizenship
suffrage, and equal treatment be
fore the law . . . But in a series
of discouraging decisions ... the
Supreme Court overthrew or di
luted the laws which had sus
stained him. while Congress and
the Executive gradually came to
terms with the politically power
ful white southerners . . . and by
1900 the Negro could no longer
count on the Federal government
to assist him in overcoming his
hopelessly unequal political posi
tion . . .
"THUS IN A DAY when doc
trines of social reform . . . swept
the North and parts of the white
South . . . the Negro exercised
less real political power than at
any time since the years of his
slavery . .
"Slowly . . . but with increasing
effectiveness the NAACP was
able to focus the energies and
hopes of northern liberals, white
and black, who believed that the
quest for political power must
precede, not follow, the quest for
economic and social gains."
(Details of the NAACP's first
major success — the 1930 rejec
tion of a Washington-backed,
anti-enfranchisement S u preme
Court nominee—followed. I
". . . THERE . . . developed in
the same period a massive shift
in the Negro voting population
itself—a shift toward Ihe largest
northern and western cities, and
a shift which is still taking place
fifty years later ... In those cities
politicians in search of votes were

not deterred from organizing the
Negro vote . . .
"Gradually the power of this
vote affected the national govern
ment . . . and became in time cru
cial to the political success of
Harry Truman and John Ken
nedy. Again, Negroes were vot
ing for specific economic and so
cial gains, and their votes paid
off. ... By the time Truman be
came President, the Negro had
become one of the major voting
blocs to shape national policies ...
"From this point on . . . the na
tional government permanently
committed itself to the business
of civil rights. . .
"... BY THE 1950's the founda
tions as well as the structure of
inequality and prejudice were be
ginning to crack . . .
"In 1944 the Supreme Court
outlawed the white primary, and
from 1948 through 1954 it heard
arguments in favor of compul
sory desegregation of schools and
universities.
"Finally came Brown v. Board
of Topeka, which stated that raci
ally separate facilities in educa
tion were inherently unequal . . .
The intellectual climate . . . had
indeed powerfully reinforced legal
and political commitment to
equality."
"THE GROWTH of Federal in
terest in defining and protecting
equal opportunities for Negroes
in America, simply stated, repre
sents a response to pressures in
northern urban centers on behalf
of Negroes everywhere, whether
politically powerful (as in th e
North) or powerless (as in the
deep South).
"These pressures came from
more than organized votes; they
were the result of a new genera

tion of Negro leadership so im
aginative and courageous in com
batting the forces of social dis
crimination that liberals in the
white community . . . soon came
to their support."
(Pease then explained how
changes in Iho economic and so
cial structure of the South — the
trend from agrarian to mechan
ized and industrial economy, the
increasing urbanization, uni on
power, and subsequent progres
sivism — could eventually break !
patterns of discrimination. He
then described a retarding force

wel-entrenehed in Southern so
ciety: the one-party system.)
"I OFFER only a brief final
comment: let no one underrate
the problem of generating a gen
uine political power among any
Neg r o community struggling
against the forces which have
dominated (he history of our na
tion since the Civil War . . .
"It is certainly possible that
Americans who do not study the
history of minority politics are
doomed to repeat some of its fail
ures and might never recognize
its successes when they see them.
