# Professors Predict Johnson Victory Tomorrow
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
To professors as well as pollsters,
it looks like a landslide for Lyndon
tomorrow.
Only one Stanford Professor, of
eight interviewed, would declare that
Republican nominee Barry Goldwater
had a chance.
THE LONE dissenter was Glenn
Campbell, director of the Hoover In
stitute. Campbell believes that, "Gold
water ('an win with a massive effort
in the last three days." The success
of this effort depends on Gold water's
ability to dispel misconceptions about
his political philosophy however.
Other members of the faculty
thought Johnson would win and win
big.

"l think the polls are probably accu
rate, " Hubert Marshall Professor of
Political Science, said. The reasons for
the Goldwater debacle are numerous,
he continued. "After rereading the
'Conscience of a Conservative,' one can
only conclude that he is against the
present social security system and the
progressive income tax. Add this to his
repeated endorsement of right-to-work
laws and we can see that his phil
osophy is outside the accepted politi
cal concensus in this country."
(iOLDWATEK'S greatest liability,
however, Marshall observed, lies in his
"repeated statements that, in the long
run, there cannot be a peaceful accom
modation between Capitalism and
Communism." In Marshall's opinion,
enough Republicans of the Kuchel-
Romney-Keating stripe are genuinely

frightened by Goldwater's foreign pol
icy to join in the "most massive de
fection from a major political party
in this century."
Piofessors Betty Zisk and Charles
Drekmeier of the Political Science de
partment agreed that Johnson would
win handily, but neither would predict
what would happen to the GOP after
wards.
"Goldwater is in control of the party
machinery," Zisk contended, "and if
his Congressional candidates win or
hold on while such men as Keating
and Scott lose, then the moderates
will have a great deal of trouble dis
lodging the Goldwater apparatus.
"IT WILL TAKE a pitched battle
to get them (the Goldwater forces)
out. Six months ago, the moderates
woke up to discover they were out
maneuvered. Today they have no
choice but to go in and try to recap
ture control of the Republican Assem-

blies," Zisk concluded.
Drekmeier, too, thought that Gold
waterism might not prove a passing
political phenomenon. "This sort of
thing is always below the surface . . .
There will always be people who think
something it wrong and that the an
swers to the problems of a terribly
complex world are quite simple."
The inflexibility of a Barry Go 1 d
water will always appeal to those
people who find the ambiguity of co
existence and tolerance unbearable,
Drekmeier declared.
MARSHALL, Zisk and Drekmeier
agreed that Goldwater was not a con
servative in the classical sense, and
because of this, in Marshall's opinion,
he is "outside the body politic in
America today."
But what if Goldwater wins?
The professors agreed that as far
as domestic policy goes, Goldwater
would be hamstrung by a Democratic

Congress. But opinions were divided
over the effects of his foreign policy.
PROE. PHILIP BUCK, an expert on
British government, thought "the new
Labor regime and a Goldwater Admin
istration would be able to accommo
date each other, "although the diffi
culties and tensions would be greater
than they are now."
"The British want to go along with
the United States as far as possible,"
Buck said. "Goldwater will need sup
port. Thus, the two should be able to
accommodate their diverse purposes."
U.S.-Soviet relations, however,
would probably take a decided turn
for the worse, according to Professor
Jan Triska of the Political Science De
partment.
"IE THE RESULTS of our latest
studeies are correct, then a Go Id
water victory would bring the Sino-
Soviet bloc closer and intensify the
Cold War," he said.

The "studies" of which Triska
spoke showed that the conflict be
tween the Chinese and the Soviets has
oscillated with their perception of the
intensity of the Cold War. That is, the
greater the intensity (as they per
ceive it), the greater their hostility to
ward the West and the lesser their
hostility toward each other.
"The Soviets would probably per
ceive a Goldwater Administration as
an overtly hostile enemy, which, in
turn, would lead to increased caution,
cohesion and unity in the Communist
camp,"he concluded.
But will Goldwater win?
THE FIVE Political Science profes
sors say no. Campbell says maybe.
Witold Sworakowski and Stefan Pos
sony, both ol the Hoover Institute and
acknowledged Goldwater conserva
tives, refused to "play prophet."
Perhaps they know something Gal
lop doesn'tâ€”or perhaps not.
