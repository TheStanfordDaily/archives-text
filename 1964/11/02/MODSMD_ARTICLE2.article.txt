• (Candidates ]\ear Campaign a fcinl
WASHINGTON One of the roughest presidential campaigns in J
modern history neared its end yesterday, with the usual last-gap;
flurries and with the dark shadow of Viet Nam hovering over it.!
On Tuesday more than 7') million voters answer the critical ques-1
tion that has always worried, sometimes excited and often bored
this nation for two hectic months:
Should Lyndon B. Johnson be kept on as president for the next
four years, or should the job be given his Republican challenger, Sen.
Batry Goldwa t er?
For President Johnson yesterday meant church and a confer- j
cnce with Secretary of State Dean Rusk and Secretary of Defense
Robert S. McNamara over a Communist attack on the Bien Hoa air;
base in South Viet Nam.
For Goldwater, Sunday meant a day of rest at home in Phoenix. I
Ariz. Monday he will return to San Francisco in the state that put j
him over the hump in his bid for the GOP nomination with a final
bid for its 40 electoral votes.

• Johnson lightens Viet Defenses
WASHINGTON President Johnson sought means yesterday
to tighten defenses against mortar attacks such as raked a U.S. air
base in South Viet Nam on Saturday. And he immediately replaced
the jet bombers destroyed in that strike.
The nocturnal, flash attack on Bien Hoa airfield near Saigon
killed four Americans and destroyed five 857 twin-engine light jet
bombers.
The Viet Cong apparently slipped through outer defenses and
may have come as close .is 500 feet from the Bs7's before opening !
up with mortars and machine guns at 20 minutes alter midnight.
The administration tended to regard the affair as serious because
of the loss of life and planes, but not as a major development in the
long-drawn-out war against the Red insurgents.
About 40 of the B.TT.s were moved into Viet Nam after the August
Tonkin Gulf incident and are regarded as a tacit threat to Communist
North Viet N'am bases which supply the Red rebels in South Viet '
Nam.
Airmen working to have the 857s on the ramp during the battle
found several mortar shells which had failed to explode.
One was marked "United States Marine Corps 1011."
• East Cerman Oldsters lie gin I isits
FRANKFURT. Germany The vanguard ot probably millions
of elderly men and women crossed early today from East Germany
into West Germany where they will visit relatives for the first time
after years of separation.
"Operation Oldster," hailed by the East German press as proof of i
the Communist regime's "humanitarian attitude," was on its way.!
Eligible for four-week permits to visit relatives in the West are pen
sioners, men over (5.1 and women over Hi), whose possible defection
would not deplete East Germany's manpower reserves.
