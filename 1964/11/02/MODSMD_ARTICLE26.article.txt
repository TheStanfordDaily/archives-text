# Prop. 14: Fearful Reaction To A Revolution In Unman Values
## 
### MICHAEL D. COHEN Editorial Director 
Proposition 14 is ihe second
most important issue on tomor
row's ballot. Massive efforts are
being made by both sides in the
battle for men's votes, and yet,
surveying if all. one is saddened
slightly to realize that the strug
gle has been only obliquely a bat
tle for men's minds.
Jusl as i.i ihe presidential cam
paign. the deeper implications of
our choice have been obscured.
Instead, we are confronted w i I h
porlr.'ils of Abraham Lincoln and
the late President Kennedy bid
d in g us "DON'T LEGALIZE
IIATE!" or pamphlets pointing
out that the Rumford "Forced"
Housing Act is one more step
down the road to a totalitarian
police state.
Half the citizens of the state —
if we arc to believe Ihe polls
favor th e proposition. These
people are no more Mississippi
racists than Edmund iPati Brown
is a Stalin in governor's clothing.

In part, the deeper issues have
been obscured by the nature of
the proposition itself. If it only
repealed the Rumford Act we
might have had clearer and more
m e a n in g 112 u 1 debate. But the
amendment would repeal working
civil rights legislation (the Unruh
and Hawkins Acts of 1059) and
go on to frustrate completely all
attempts to deal with the housing
aspect of the civil rights problem
through the legislative process.
The proposition goes so far be
yond repealing the Rumford Acl
that many people who oppose the
Rumford legislation are neverthe
less opposed to the proposition.
Because the specifics of the
proposition offer something for
jusl about everyone to oppose,
the anti fourteen campaign has
concentrated heavily on expos
ing the voter to the ridiculous
ramifications of the measure.
But beyond the specifics of the
proposition and the battle of the
billboards there is a larger issue
which has received distressingly
little attention, the issue of long
standing American values which
seem threatened by the Negro's

advance on the established order
Lot us make no mistake about
it. A vote for Proposition 14 is
for the most part a vote against
the un painted house, Ihe un
mowed lawn and the watermelon
patch in the front yard. That is
the image I hat the average Yes
voter- wants to keep from ma
terializing next door. It matters
not that the Rumford Act prob-;
ably doesn't apply to the house |
next floor; il is still that image
which he is trying to stop.
It's not just his properly values
h<> is trying to save. New free j
ways have never met the opposi- 1
tion being met by fair housing
legislation.
The truth of the matter is that, I
at least in the "image" held by I
the white voter, Ihe Negro threat
ens something beyond property!
values he threatens personal
values.
As a result of the Negro revolu i
tion. America is undergoing a
revolution in human values. The,
firm position of work at the top
of the American order of values)
is facing a serious challenge. We ;
have long viewed property as the
direct correlative of work, as a
physical symbolical ion of personal
worth, as a way of evaluating our
selves and others.

To the white voter the Negro i
does not seem "to care what other
people will think about him" when i
they see his property. To the
white voter it is primarily among
Negroes that one finds that dis
picable individual who is content
to stay on relief. To the w hi t e
voter the Negro revolution is a j
threatening inuendo that he may
have used the wrong system of |
measurement for evaluating him- i
self and those around him.
It matters not whether this im
age is true. (Though it may well
he that the Negro, denied access
to property for centuries and con
stantly plagued by ten per cent
unemployment, has a different j
view of property and work than
the white.) What matters is the
fact that Ihe image, true or not, j
is what the white man thinks.
That is in part why the whole j
civil rights movement and Ihe
Rumford Act in particular, seems'

so threatening. Feeling threat
ened in this way, many people
will vole for Proposition 1-1.
One thing is certain if it passes,
we will have established a brittle
ness that will hinder our every
attempt at a later date.
What is more, the Negro revolu
tion is only (he first wave in the
revolution in hum a n values.
Economists now tell us that auto
mation and computerization of in
dustry and management may ren
der a large segment of the popula
tion permanently unemployable
within the next few generations.
We will be able to produce more
than adequate goods for this new
class of permanently unemployed,
but we will have no jobs for them.
We will have no way of giving
them access to the goods. Will we
find ourselves, 30 years hence,
saying to men for whom there are
no jobs, what we have always said
to the Negro and to each other:
"He who does not work, does not
deserve to eat?"
★ * *
The Negro revolution is but the
first warning of the impending
invalidation of our old way of
looking at the world. The ever
accelerating mechanism of social
change has now reached a pace
near the upper limits of our com
prehension, and within our life
time we may be required to at
tempt a complete revision of our
way of looking at the world.
Such a prospect makes any rea
sonable per so n uneasy. Very
clearly such a situation tempts a
man to retreat in fear, to fall back
on an absolute like the "absolute
discretion" clause of Proposition
14.
But no problem was ever solved
without the faith that someone
could solve it and the hope that
someone would. We must believe
as Adlai Stevenson once noted,
that "in the long run. hope is
more powerful than fear." We
must reject Proposition 14.
