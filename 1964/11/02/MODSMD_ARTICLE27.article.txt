## Johnson's Hopes For A 'Cheerful' Foreign Policy 
### John E. Bonine 
I lie nationally televised speeches by Lyndon Johnson and
Barn Goldwater concerning the recent events in the Communist
world provided a clear view of the esssential vacuity of the incum
bent's foreign policy, as well as an indication of the reasoned
analysis and purposive action which Goldwater would follow.

| LBJ recounted his novel view
of recent history. ''In the last 20
years . . . we have steadily moved
toward a more hopeful world. We
have moved toward widening free
j dom . . ." Tell that to the Chinese
iand the Cubans and the captive
peoples of Eastern Europe. ". . .
I and more lasting peace." Tell that
j to the Vietnamese and the Ber
i liners and Africans and the Latin
i Americans.
Senator Goldwater was more to
| the point in his charge that "the
: tide has been running against
I freedom."
Communists Desire Peace?
I Johnson demonstrated his be
lief that the Communists really
: desire peace. He said he hopes
1 the new leaders will be "ready to
work for peace."
In his speech, Senator Go 1 ci
water deftly punctured the myth
of Khrushchev's opposition to
! war, and his successors' "readi-
I ness to work for peace." Last
July Khrushchev said:
"Of course, when I say that
| we are against war, I mean ag
gressive, predaton wars |i.e.,
Western initiatives!. But there
are other wars, wars of national
liberation: such wars aie .just
and sacred. We support the
peoples who take up arms and
uphold their independence and
! freedom, and we support them
not only in words but by con
crete deeds." (my emphasis.)
Johnson's misconception of the
, nature of the conflict caused him
| to misjudge the requisites to
achieve peace. "I said to the am
bassador [Dobrynin| that I would
I be ready to talk to anyone, when
it would help the cause of peace."
Will Talking Work?
Senator Thomas J. Dodd il).-
Conn.) criticized this attitude
5 some time ago:
"... whereas we in the West
regard peace as the normal order
of things, and warfare as an inter
ruption of •'■:11 order. Communist
doctrine regards warfare, cense
less conflict and violence as the
essential order of life. There is no
|s:.c!i ihing as peace to them. . . .
it is only the West that seeks
peace, and the notion that peace
is being prevented by mere mis
understandings or resolvable dif
ferences is absurd."
Continuing his optimistic ap
praisal LBJ said "it is likely that
the men in the Kremlin will be

so concerned with internal prob- j
lems that they "may not be |
tempted to reckless external acts." |
Goldwater's Realism
Senator Goldwater's reply was I
much more specific and workable,
aimed at forcing t lie Communists
to turn away from "external
.acts":
"If we have the will and wis- !
dom to show the Communist
leaders that we firmly intend.to
protect our interests, we will :
blunt the thrust of Communist
aggression. We will deny sue-1
cess to their ambitions for ex-1
pansion. We will cause the Com- !
munist leaders to look inward i
to their own internal problems j
und to work out solutions
solutions that can be found only
through relaxing the totalitar-'
ian despotism that now reigns 1
in the Communist world."
Peace Through Strength
The Democrats have been prais
ing themselves as "prudent" and
"cautious." Senator Goldwater
warned in his speech: "Let us
never again fall into the trap of
thinking that weakness means
prudence, or that inaction means
caution." He offered a policy of
"peace through strength and reso
lution."
On the other hand, here is how :
Harlan Cleveland, Assistant Sec
retary of State, has defined o u r
present "grand design":
" . . . a many-sided effort, un-j
der the canopy of nuclear deter
rence, to make the non-Commu- j
nist world hum with the cheer
ful and contagious sounds of
success, and thereby help to sub
vert the Communist world by
demonstrating that free choice!
works better, and feels better, ;
than coercion." Delightful.
It is hard to believe that our
government is pursuing a policy
based on making "cheerful and
contagious sounds" in order to set
an example for the Communists.
The Johnson administration is not
conducting a foreign policy; it
seems to be trying to conduct an
orchestra. It is exemplified by
LBJ's statement earlier this year i
that "in a world with 120 nations !
we must have 120 foreign poli- i
cies."
Try to direct an orchestra or
combat a determined enemy —
with a policy like that!

lems that they "may not be |

Goldwater's Realism
Senator Goldwater's reply was I
much more specific and workable,
aimed at forcing t lie Communists
to turn away from "external
.acts":
"If we have the will and wis- !
dom to show the Communist
leaders that we firmly intend.to
protect our interests, we will :
blunt the thrust of Communist
aggression. We will deny sue-1
cess to their ambitions for ex-1
pansion. We will cause the Com- !
munist leaders to look inward i
to their own internal problems j
und to work out solutions
solutions that can be found only
through relaxing the totalitar-'
ian despotism that now reigns 1
in the Communist world."
Peace Through Strength
The Democrats have been prais
ing themselves as "prudent" and
"cautious." Senator Goldwater
warned in his speech: "Let us
never again fall into the trap of
thinking that weakness means
prudence, or that inaction means
caution." He offered a policy of
"peace through strength and reso
lution."
On the other hand, here is how :
Harlan Cleveland, Assistant Sec
retary of State, has defined o u r
present "grand design":
" . . . a many-sided effort, un-j
der the canopy of nuclear deter
rence, to make the non-Commu- j
nist world hum with the cheer
ful and contagious sounds of
success, and thereby help to sub
vert the Communist world by
demonstrating that free choice!
works better, and feels better, ;
than coercion." Delightful.
It is hard to believe that our
government is pursuing a policy
based on making "cheerful and
contagious sounds" in order to set
an example for the Communists.
The Johnson administration is not
conducting a foreign policy; it
seems to be trying to conduct an
orchestra. It is exemplified by
LBJ's statement earlier this year i
that "in a world with 120 nations !
we must have 120 foreign poli- i
cies."
Try to direct an orchestra or
combat a determined enemy —
with a policy like that!
I lie nationally televised speeches by Lyndon Johnson and
Barn Goldwater concerning the recent events in the Communist
world provided a clear view of the esssential vacuity of the incum
bent's foreign policy, as well as an indication of the reasoned
analysis and purposive action which Goldwater would follow.

| LBJ recounted his novel view
of recent history. ''In the last 20
years . . . we have steadily moved
toward a more hopeful world. We
have moved toward widening free
j dom . . ." Tell that to the Chinese
iand the Cubans and the captive
peoples of Eastern Europe. ". . .
I and more lasting peace." Tell that
j to the Vietnamese and the Ber
i liners and Africans and the Latin
i Americans.
Senator Goldwater was more to
| the point in his charge that "the
: tide has been running against
I freedom."
Communists Desire Peace?
I Johnson demonstrated his be
lief that the Communists really
: desire peace. He said he hopes
1 the new leaders will be "ready to
work for peace."
In his speech, Senator Go 1 ci
water deftly punctured the myth
of Khrushchev's opposition to
! war, and his successors' "readi-
I ness to work for peace." Last
July Khrushchev said:
"Of course, when I say that
| we are against war, I mean ag
gressive, predaton wars |i.e.,
Western initiatives!. But there
are other wars, wars of national
liberation: such wars aie .just
and sacred. We support the
peoples who take up arms and
uphold their independence and
! freedom, and we support them
not only in words but by con
crete deeds." (my emphasis.)
Johnson's misconception of the
, nature of the conflict caused him
| to misjudge the requisites to
achieve peace. "I said to the am
bassador [Dobrynin| that I would
I be ready to talk to anyone, when
it would help the cause of peace."
Will Talking Work?
Senator Thomas J. Dodd il).-
Conn.) criticized this attitude
5 some time ago:
"... whereas we in the West
regard peace as the normal order
of things, and warfare as an inter
ruption of •'■:11 order. Communist
doctrine regards warfare, cense
less conflict and violence as the
essential order of life. There is no
|s:.c!i ihing as peace to them. . . .
it is only the West that seeks
peace, and the notion that peace
is being prevented by mere mis
understandings or resolvable dif
ferences is absurd."
Continuing his optimistic ap

Senator Goldwater was more to

Communists Desire Peace?
I Johnson demonstrated his be
lief that the Communists really
: desire peace. He said he hopes
1 the new leaders will be "ready to
work for peace."
In his speech, Senator Go 1 ci
water deftly punctured the myth
of Khrushchev's opposition to
! war, and his successors' "readi-
I ness to work for peace." Last
July Khrushchev said:
"Of course, when I say that
| we are against war, I mean ag
gressive, predaton wars |i.e.,
Western initiatives!. But there
are other wars, wars of national
liberation: such wars aie .just
and sacred. We support the
peoples who take up arms and
uphold their independence and
! freedom, and we support them
not only in words but by con
crete deeds." (my emphasis.)
Johnson's misconception of the
, nature of the conflict caused him
| to misjudge the requisites to
achieve peace. "I said to the am
bassador [Dobrynin| that I would
I be ready to talk to anyone, when
it would help the cause of peace."
Will Talking Work?
Senator Thomas J. Dodd il).-
Conn.) criticized this attitude
5 some time ago:
"... whereas we in the West
regard peace as the normal order
of things, and warfare as an inter
ruption of •'■:11 order. Communist
doctrine regards warfare, cense
less conflict and violence as the
essential order of life. There is no
|s:.c!i ihing as peace to them. . . .
it is only the West that seeks
peace, and the notion that peace
is being prevented by mere mis
understandings or resolvable dif
ferences is absurd."
Continuing his optimistic ap
praisal LBJ said "it is likely that
the men in the Kremlin will be

so concerned with internal prob- j
lems that they "may not be |
tempted to reckless external acts." |
Goldwater's Realism
Senator Goldwater's reply was I
much more specific and workable,
aimed at forcing t lie Communists
to turn away from "external
.acts":
"If we have the will and wis- !
dom to show the Communist
leaders that we firmly intend.to
protect our interests, we will :
blunt the thrust of Communist
aggression. We will deny sue-1
cess to their ambitions for ex-1
pansion. We will cause the Com- !
munist leaders to look inward i
to their own internal problems j
und to work out solutions
solutions that can be found only
through relaxing the totalitar-'
ian despotism that now reigns 1
in the Communist world."
Peace Through Strength
The Democrats have been prais
ing themselves as "prudent" and
"cautious." Senator Goldwater
warned in his speech: "Let us
never again fall into the trap of
thinking that weakness means
prudence, or that inaction means
caution." He offered a policy of
"peace through strength and reso
lution."
On the other hand, here is how :
Harlan Cleveland, Assistant Sec
retary of State, has defined o u r
present "grand design":
" . . . a many-sided effort, un-j
der the canopy of nuclear deter
rence, to make the non-Commu- j
nist world hum with the cheer
ful and contagious sounds of
success, and thereby help to sub
vert the Communist world by
demonstrating that free choice!
works better, and feels better, ;
than coercion." Delightful.
It is hard to believe that our
government is pursuing a policy
based on making "cheerful and
contagious sounds" in order to set
an example for the Communists.
The Johnson administration is not
conducting a foreign policy; it
seems to be trying to conduct an
orchestra. It is exemplified by
LBJ's statement earlier this year i
that "in a world with 120 nations !
we must have 120 foreign poli- i
cies."
Try to direct an orchestra or
combat a determined enemy —
with a policy like that!
I lie nationally televised speeches by Lyndon Johnson and
Barn Goldwater concerning the recent events in the Communist
world provided a clear view of the esssential vacuity of the incum
bent's foreign policy, as well as an indication of the reasoned
analysis and purposive action which Goldwater would follow.

| LBJ recounted his novel view
of recent history. ''In the last 20
years . . . we have steadily moved
toward a more hopeful world. We
have moved toward widening free
j dom . . ." Tell that to the Chinese
iand the Cubans and the captive
peoples of Eastern Europe. ". . .
I and more lasting peace." Tell that
j to the Vietnamese and the Ber
