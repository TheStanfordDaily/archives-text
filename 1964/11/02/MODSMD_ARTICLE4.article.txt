Mississippi, now that the state
has reached a "fluid situation,"

in the Freedom Project there.
Lowenstein, speaking inform

done in Mississippi by Stanford
volunteers, stating that they have
been "tremendously significant."
He recalled one incident during
a particularly tense period, fol
lowing the shooting of a Negro

where six students were staying.
All turned out to be from Stan
ford.
"UNDER S I M I L A R circum

these students were sitting
around a table planning their les
sons for the next day, as though
nothing unusual had been hap
pening. Their courage was a
moving tribute to t his institu

Lowenstein also praised Dennis
Sweeney, a Stanford student, who
has been subjected to a great deal
ot harrassment in Mississippi,
"lie is one of the most extraor
dinary people I have known.
Many people who have gone
through less than he has have
come out embittered or warped,
but he hasn't."
