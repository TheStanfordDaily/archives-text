By I'l Ti; I\l\<;
Stanford <• <» m p 1 e t e 1 y over
whelmed Oregon's seventh-ranked
Dueks, Saturday, but it was only
because of quarterback Dave
Lewis' accurate arm and Braden
Beck's toe that the Indians upset
Oregon, 10-8, on Beck's 27-yard
field goal in the final K> seconds.
Before that wild finish, it
looked like a rewrite of the famil
iar Stanford script for a moral
victory. The Indians had all but
pushed Ihc Ducks out of Port
land's ramshackle Multnomah
Stadium, only to apparently blow
it when a ID-yard interception run
back set up an Oregon touchdown.
A two-point conversion made it
8-7 for the Ducks.
MOST OF Till; credit for Ihe
atypical last-second Tribe come
back goes to Lewis. The ii-2, IPD
pound sophomore booted a beau
tiful (il yard line-drive punt in Un
closing minutes that rolled dead
on the Oregon one-yard line.
Then, ailei three Duck plays
had gotten four yards, Oregon
punted to Craig Kitchey on t he
Oregon 39-yard line.
With less than a minute remain

ing. Lewis came through with ai
perfect sideline pass to halfback j
Bob Blunt, who took it at full]
| speed and was nudged out of!
bounds at Ihe 12. Fullback Pete
' Middlehauff moved the ball to the ;
(middle of the field, and then, with '
'no time-outs remaining, the In-j
dians hurriedly lined-up and Beck j
booted his perfect field goal.
The victory was the first for
Stanford over Oregon since 19."iH, !
I snapped a 10-game Duck win!
j streak, and was coach John Ral-1
ston's first away-from-home win
in eight tries.
STATISTIC S tell the slory: j
First downs, Stanford 21, Oregon '
5; total offense, Stanford 371
yards, Oregon 73.
It was the defense* that provided
the biggest shock. Oregon's
j vaunted Bob Berry, third in the
i nation in total offense, was under j
extreme pressure all afternoon
from Stanford's "down four,"
Gary Pettigrew. Mike Hibler, Hob
Nichols, and Tom Ross. In addi-1
tion, Berry had a miserable day,
missing several open receivers. Hi*
completed four of 13 for only Hi
■ yards. I

What's more, none of his receiv
ers were able to get loose down
field. Ritehey and John Guillory
covered Oregon's Ray Palm and
Corky Sullivan like glue, an d
Berry was trapped in the hack
field five times for losses. Reason
for the success was a man-to-man
pass defense, used for Ihe first
time this year.
The "down four" plus lineback
er Jack Chappie stopped virtually
every Oregon running play, lie
sides the costly interception and ;i
brief push in the second quarter
that Ritehey stopped with a pass
interception, Oregon never got be
yond its own 39-vard line.
OFFKNKIVKI.V, it was half
back Ray Handley and the Indian
pass attack that spelled the differ
ence. Handley gained 113 yards
including a five-yard cut-back run
off two taeklers for Stanford's
touchdown, lie also had one break
away 30-yard dash, a 16-yarder,
and caught an 18-yard pass.
Three Card quarterbacks com
pleted IS of 12!) passes for 201
yards. Pick Berg handled most of
the work, and run the team quite
well. In ilit' second half, Ralston
instituted a quarterback rotation!
system that saw Berg in for two
plays, followed by Lewis, then
Berg again.
J. D. Lodato looked great at
flanker, the first time this season
for him at thai position. He:
snarled five passes for 74 yards, 1
and on nearly every catch the'
nearest defender was 15 feet
away.
LEWIS averaged 15 yards pet
punt. He and Dick Ragsdale were
so effective that Oregon had to !
start live times from inside its'
own 215-yard lino.
The Indians missed an early
scoring chance after quarterback
Terry DeSylvia took the team 50
yards and Beck missed a 47-yard
field goal, thai curved away by
inches.

PENALTIES just about sank
I she Tribe. Three promising fourth
quarter drives were ended by 15-
! yarders. In all, Stanford picked Lip
!)2 yards in penalties, to one-half
yard for the Ducks.
Right after Handlcy's third
quarter TD, Berg was rushed
j hard and threw an interception to
i Les Palm, who grabbed ihe ball
I on his own 45 and ran it back 1o
the Indian 15 before .hie Neal
pushed him oul of bounds.
Three plays later Oregon
scored, Ray Palm stepped in fronl
| of Ritchey to snag a Berry pass
, for the two points, and il looked
like the same dismal story thai
Stanford rooters have become ac
customed to. But Lewis, who
hadn't played quarterback earlier
this season, refused to let gloomy
: history repeat itself.
