Stanford <• <» m p 1 e t e 1 y over
whelmed Oregon's seventh-ranked
Dueks, Saturday, but it was only
because of quarterback Dave
Lewis' accurate arm and Braden
Beck's toe that the Indians upset
Oregon, 10-8, on Beck's 27-yard
field goal in the final K> seconds.
Before that wild finish, it
looked like a rewrite of the famil
iar Stanford script for a moral
victory. The Indians had all but
pushed Ihc Ducks out of Port
land's ramshackle Multnomah
Stadium, only to apparently blow
it when a ID-yard interception run
back set up an Oregon touchdown.
A two-point conversion made it
8-7 for the Ducks.
MOST OF Till; credit for Ihe
atypical last-second Tribe come
back goes to Lewis. The ii-2, IPD
pound sophomore booted a beau
tiful (il yard line-drive punt in Un
closing minutes that rolled dead
on the Oregon one-yard line.
Then, ailei three Duck plays
had gotten four yards, Oregon
punted to Craig Kitchey on t he
Oregon 39-yard line.
With less than a minute remain

ing. Lewis came through with ai
perfect sideline pass to halfback j
Bob Blunt, who took it at full]
| speed and was nudged out of!
bounds at Ihe 12. Fullback Pete
' Middlehauff moved the ball to the ;
(middle of the field, and then, with '
'no time-outs remaining, the In-j
dians hurriedly lined-up and Beck j
booted his perfect field goal.
The victory was the first for
Stanford over Oregon since 19."iH, !
I snapped a 10-game Duck win!
j streak, and was coach John Ral-1
ston's first away-from-home win
in eight tries.
STATISTIC S tell the slory: j
First downs, Stanford 21, Oregon '
5; total offense, Stanford 371
yards, Oregon 73.
It was the defense* that provided
the biggest shock. Oregon's
j vaunted Bob Berry, third in the
i nation in total offense, was under j
extreme pressure all afternoon
from Stanford's "down four,"
Gary Pettigrew. Mike Hibler, Hob
Nichols, and Tom Ross. In addi-1
tion, Berry had a miserable day,
missing several open receivers. Hi*
completed four of 13 for only Hi
■ yards. I

What's more, none of his receiv
ers were able to get loose down
field. Ritehey and John Guillory
covered Oregon's Ray Palm and
Corky Sullivan like glue, an d
Berry was trapped in the hack
field five times for losses. Reason
for the success was a man-to-man
pass defense, used for Ihe first
time this year.
The "down four" plus lineback
er Jack Chappie stopped virtually
every Oregon running play, lie
sides the costly interception and ;i
brief push in the second quarter
that Ritehey stopped with a pass
interception, Oregon never got be
yond its own 39-vard line.
OFFKNKIVKI.V, it was half
back Ray Handley and the Indian
pass attack that spelled the differ
ence. Handley gained 113 yards
including a five-yard cut-back run
off two taeklers for Stanford's
touchdown, lie also had one break
away 30-yard dash, a 16-yarder,
and caught an 18-yard pass.
Three Card quarterbacks com
pleted IS of 12!) passes for 201
yards. Pick Berg handled most of
the work, and run the team quite
