Even If
Even if Jesus Christ were not the Son of God, but just a
great teacher, wouldn't it be worth your while to learn more
about this man who changed the entire course of world history?
Even if the Bible were not the inerrant, infallible, inspired
World of God, shouldn't you, as a well-informed collegian, be
familiar with this all-time best seller and great work of lit
erature?
Even if heaven and hell were mythological remnants from
the past, shouldn't you consider the real possibility of some
kind of life after death?
Even if all religions have some truth in them, shouldn't you
consider Christianity which claims to have the entire truth,
the religion whose founder said He was "the way, the truth
and the life'' (John 14:6)?
Even if the Christians you know are lukewarm or hypocrit
ical, shouldn't you see for yourself what they claim to know
regarding a living person, Jesus Christ?
Even if there were were no God at all, wouldn t a life based
on the teachings of Jesus Christ be the best kind of life for you
and for your fellow men?
Even if the Bible and Jesus Christ and the Christian faith
seem irrelevant today, shouldn't you seek the reasons why
millions down through the ages have completely sold-out them
selves to Jesus Christ?
What if the claims of Christianity are true? What if you have
been wrong about Jesus Christ, God and the Bible? Have you
looked at the issues and the facts? A true believer in Christ
proclaims that you need have no doubts, that you can throw
"ifs," "and,'' and "buts" out of your life and rejoice in the
certain knowledge of a personal Savior and Friend, Jesus
Christ, the one and only mediator between God and man. (I
Timothy 2:5).
