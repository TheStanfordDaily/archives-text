THE CAMPAIGN
• /ill rolls Forecast Johnson Victory
WASHINGTON The sound and fury of what has been called
the most bitter presidential campaign in modern times ended with
a final burst of oratory last night — and with all polls forecasting a
victory for President Johnson.
Many of the polls estimate it will be a Johnson landslide rivaling
Franklin D. Roosevelt's victory in 1936. But the President's Repub
lican rival, Sen. Barry Goldwater, says he doesn't believe the polls
and is predicting the "upset of the century."
I lis lieutenants say they see a chance of carrying every state
except Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Alaska and Hawaii.
Johnson's aides, however, have given up hope only on Mississippi
and Alabama, a state where Johnson's name isn't even on the ballot.
Beginning at one minute after midnight in some New England
towns, an estimated 71 million Americans — a record number
will deliver their verdict in the presidential race and also choose
25 governors, 435 House members and 35 senators.

• Thurmond: 400, AW i, Killed In \ iet Raid
COLUMBIA, S.C. Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said last night
he had received information "on reliable authority" that casualties
in last Saturday night's raid on a South Viet Nam air base amounted
to 300 to 400 persons.
Earlier in the day, Thurmond said "many more" Americans were)
killed in the mortar attack at the Bien Joa air base than were an-i
riounced. In Washington, Asst. Secretary of Defense Arthur Sylves
ter said "the report is absolutely untrue."
Thurmond charged the Defense Department "was suppressing;
the facts and hiding from the American people the massacre of:
American personnel.

• LliJ I,cads In Mock Election
JACKSON, Miss. Partial returns from IS of 69 counties voting
in the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party- MFDP -mock elec
tion gave President Johnson and Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey an over
whelming lead last night.
The MFDP headquarters here estimated that of about 20,000
returns the national Democratic party candidates had more than
19,000 votes compared to less than 100 for Republicans Barry Cold
water and William E. Miller.
Four Negro candidates of the MFDP, opposing regular members!
of Mississippi's congressional delegation, had all but a handful of!
votes.
The four-day mock election, which ended yesterday was held in j
all hut 13 counties which were bypassed because of racial tension
there.
Party workers said that since the freedom vote began last month, ;
119 arrests had been made and there had been 63 incidents of harass
ment.
The Freedom party said the \ote, carried out by 75 out-of-state i
college volunteers and some 200 regular civil rights organization (
workers in Mississippi, was designed to give state Negroes a vehicle
for political participation.
STATE AND LOCAL
• Record California Vote Expected
SAN FRANCISCO California voters split their election day I
interest among a presidential election, a bitter senatorial race and aj
controversial civil rights issue.
The three contests were expected to lure at least 92 per cent of
the state's 8 million voters to the polls. This would be the largest
turnout in history, surpassing the record 88.3 per cent who voted in
the 1960 general election.
Vying with the presidential race for the attention of Californians,
is the battle for a U.S. Senate seat between the appointed incumbent
Democrat Pierre Salinger, a one-time presidential press aide, and
Republican George Murphy, former movie musical star.
The civil rights issue of the 1964 campaign was magnified for
Californians by a proposed state constitutional amendment, Proposi
tion 11, involving the sale or rental of homes and apartments.
Latest polls indicate the proposition will carry.

JACKSON, Miss. Partial returns from IS of 69 counties voting
in the Mississippi Freedom Democratic party- MFDP -mock elec

The MFDP headquarters here estimated that of about 20,000
returns the national Democratic party candidates had more than
19,000 votes compared to less than 100 for Republicans Barry Cold
water and William E. Miller.
Four Negro candidates of the MFDP, opposing regular members!
of Mississippi's congressional delegation, had all but a handful of!
votes.
The four-day mock election, which ended yesterday was held in j

there.
Party workers said that since the freedom vote began last month, ;
119 arrests had been made and there had been 63 incidents of harass

STATE AND LOCAL
• Record California Vote Expected
SAN FRANCISCO California voters split their election day I
interest among a presidential election, a bitter senatorial race and aj
controversial civil rights issue.
The three contests were expected to lure at least 92 per cent of
the state's 8 million voters to the polls. This would be the largest
turnout in history, surpassing the record 88.3 per cent who voted in
the 1960 general election.
Vying with the presidential race for the attention of Californians,
is the battle for a U.S. Senate seat between the appointed incumbent
Democrat Pierre Salinger, a one-time presidential press aide, and
Republican George Murphy, former movie musical star.
The civil rights issue of the 1964 campaign was magnified for
Californians by a proposed state constitutional amendment, Proposi
tion 11, involving the sale or rental of homes and apartments.
Latest polls indicate the proposition will carry.

• Record California Vote Expected
SAN FRANCISCO California voters split their election day I
interest among a presidential election, a bitter senatorial race and aj
controversial civil rights issue.
The three contests were expected to lure at least 92 per cent of
the state's 8 million voters to the polls. This would be the largest
turnout in history, surpassing the record 88.3 per cent who voted in
the 1960 general election.
Vying with the presidential race for the attention of Californians,
is the battle for a U.S. Senate seat between the appointed incumbent
Democrat Pierre Salinger, a one-time presidential press aide, and
Republican George Murphy, former movie musical star.
The civil rights issue of the 1964 campaign was magnified for
Californians by a proposed state constitutional amendment, Proposi
tion 11, involving the sale or rental of homes and apartments.
Latest polls indicate the proposition will carry.
