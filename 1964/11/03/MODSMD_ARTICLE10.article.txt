### STAN DALEY 
Stanford students can keep
up with the latest election re
sults tonight as KZSU will otter
complete coverage beginning at
7:00 p.m. and numerous televi
sion sets will be provided at key
campus locations.

Raymond Wolfinger, and Richard
Fagen. They will be joined by
Associate Dean Robert Rosen/-
weig of the Graduation Division.
According to Station News Di
rector Bob Suffel, KZSU will
broadcast no computerized predic
tions of the election. "KZSU will
offer an alternative choice to
those who don't want to be told,
before the race is over, what the
results will be," Suffel said.
FOR THOSE who like the com
puter "projections," all three ma
jor networks will be on the air
at Tresidder from 6 to 11:30 p.m.
Sets tuned into NBC's Huntley-
Brinkley news team on channel
four will be available at the north
end of the grill room and in the
large lounge.
Walter Cronkite and the CIJS
election coverage on channel five
will be viewed in the Tresidder
Small Lounge. The ABC coverage,
headed by Howard K. Smith, will
be on channel seven in the booth
area of the grill room.
A television will also be set up
in the Beehtel International Cen
ter which will be open throughout
the day and the night.
KZSU will be able to report re
turns with the same speed and
accuracy as the network stations
due to its participation in the Net
work Election Service, Suffel
said.
The campus radio station will
originate a network broadcast to
be heard on stations at Berkeley
and Santa Barbara. It will also
exchange reports with 32 stations
of the "Ivy League Network."
THE KZSU coverage will give
special emphasis to gubernatorial
and senatorial races in the key
states of New York, Michigan, and
Illinois.
