### 
A planned expansion of the
graphics department will "make
it equal to any in (he country,"
according to Professor Nathan
Oliveira, director of the art de
partment.
The department is now eon
fined to lithographing; however,
Oliveira foresees future develop
ment of the printing renter, to in
clude typography and the print
ing of Stanford publishments.
Although this program is de
signed primarily for graduate
students, Professor Oliveira em
phasized that printing disciplines
are beneficial to the artist at any
level.
Professor Oliveira, an artist
from Oakland, chose to teach at
Stanford although offered the
chairmanship of ihe graphics
studio at Cornell.
He now intends solely to dem
onstrate the craft and its im
port;! nee and to procreate a taste
for the art until more sophisti
cated equipment is introduced.
