## 
### STAN SPOKESMAN Daily Correspondent 
The 1961 election probably will ,U<) clown in history as the first!
in which a majority of the nations newspapers failed to take an;
editorial stand for either presidential candidate, Prof. Chilton R.
Hush <>l Stan lord's Communication Department told the Faculty
Club last ni^ht.

And an election eve straw bal
lot of 167 Faculty Club members
showed practically all expect a
Johnson victory and two-thirds
will support the President at the
polls.
In 1936, Bush noted, only seven
per cent of the national press

failed to pick a candidate. By
1944, this proportion rose to 22
j per cent and in the last election
■ the uncommitted reached 31 per
jeent.

I con I of the total national circula
tion have endorsed Johnson, while
newspapers backing Goldwater
have only 15 per cent of the cir
culation. The rest remain on the
fence.
IN TDK STRAW poll, of those
"who will win," 159 (or 95 per
cent > predicted Johnson, seven
said Goldwater, and one remained
undecided.

ference, 111 (or 66 per cent)
hacked Johnson, 10 (or 21 j>er

i "intensifies the tempo, no the
trend" of politics.
