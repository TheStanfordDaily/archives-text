						Reluctant 'No' On 14

### 
Proposition 14 presents an uncomfortable di
lemma to the thoughtful voter, a dilemma which
is not easily resolved.
Those who have opposed the Proposition
from the beginning have done so with admirable
motives, namely, to enable the Negro and other
minority groups to raise their economic and so
cial stature according to ability, initiative, and
personal merit — without fear of discrimination
on the absurd, morally indefensible, and mani
festly unjust basis of race, color, or national
origin.
Those who endorse Proposition 14, however,
operate from an equally admirable libertarian
belief that a man ought to be quite free to do
with his property as he pleases and that he should
not be forced to sell liis property to someone he
dislikes, regardless of the reasons for that dislike.
Furthermore, those w ho favor the amendment
retain what we believe to be, healthy suspicion
of governmental power and its interference in the
affairs of the individual, especially with regard
to personal values.
It is the conflict between these two beliefs—
the belief that racial discrimination is morally
wrong, and the belief that a man ought to have
"absolute discretion" over the use of his property
(and that government ought not to be involved
iu legislating morality) that makes the campaign
so bitter.
Because of our essential agreement with the

underlying philosophy of both sides of the issue,
it is only reluctantly that we take a stand against
Proposition J 4.
We agree with the opponents oi the Rumford
Act that it contains serious Haws, and we hope
that the legislature will make considerable
changes.
But, perhaps unfortunately, the Huniford Act
is not the issue. The issue, rather, is whether
California will meet with any sort of flexibility
the problems raised by the civil rights drive and
the rising expectations of the Negro minority.
Adjustments will have to be made to make
way for the legitimate interests of the Negro,
and, unfortunately, legislation may be the only
avenue toward a peaceful and moderate resolu
tion of racial tensions.
Proposition 14, if passed, will cause an unfor
tunate stiffening of the barriers to social equality
for the Negio. Besides abolishing the Rumford
Act, it w ill prevent, exactly at the wrong time,
any efforts by state and local government to deal
with w hat lias become the most perplexing issue
of our day.
We reiterate our conviction that legislation
in this area should be kept at a minimum and
used with utmost moderation. And we reaffirm
our belief that property rights should, wherever
possible, be protected.
But Proposition 14 fails to account for the
glaring need for change. It must, however re
luctantly, be opposed.
