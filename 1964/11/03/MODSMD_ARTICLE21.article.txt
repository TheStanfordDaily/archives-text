# Conservatives: Don't Lose Hope
## 
### WM.F. BUCKLEY, JR 
The pollsters are very ompha
lic in predicting that Senator
] Goldwater will a) lose the elec
| tion, and b) lose it by a very sub
j stantial margin. They may be
! light, and they may be wrong.
As Casey Stengel said earnestly
after a long pause pondering a
difficult question from the floor
—"Whom knows."
I write today exhypothesi on
the assumption that the pollsters
i are correct. There will, after all,
he plenty of time to analy/e their
mistakes, and the public's clair
voyance, if an upset victory is
registered. On the assumption,
however, they are correct, 1 wish
to meditate for a moment on the
probable collapse in the morale
of the Republican Party.
GOP Threatened
It is quite true, for reasons I
have described in a precious an
alysis, that the future of the Re
publican Party is threatened. If
liberal Republicans will here
after refuse to vote for conserva
tive Presidential candidates; and
if conservative Republicans will
tit-for-tat hereafter refuse to vote
for liberal Republican Presiden
tial candidates, then the chances
are at least very good that the
GOP has had it, and that we shall
he left in America either with a
one-party system, or else that we

shall embark upon a convulsive
period at the end of which there
will be a massive political re
grouping, with liberal Republi
cans joining Democratic ranks,
and conservative Democrats join
ing their soulmates either in the
Republican Party, or in a new na
tional party.
Notwithstanding, it was deeply
fewer votes than any of the na-
These are, clearly, possibilities.
Another is that the juices of re
generation will go to work with
in the Republican Party, and that
in due course it will bounce back
- and take power.
The Democrats Of The '20s
Consider some fairly recent fig
ures. As recently as in 1924, the
Democratic Party, under John W.
Davis, managed to get only 28
per cent of the popular vote.
In 1920, the Democrat Cox
(with FDR as his running mate)
got only 34 per cent of the vote,
well below the 37 per cent that
the Republican Landon got in the
year of FDR's greatest triumph,
in 1936. Indeed, in the three Presi
dential elections that immediately
preceded Roosevelt's sweep in
1932, the Democrats averaged less
than 35 per cent of the popular
vote.
If one wishes to concentrate on
the ideological relevance of Mr.

Gold water's candidacy, consider
the fate of the Socialist Party in
American elections between 1900
and 1932. It was a substantial
party. Even so, it averaged only
7 per cent of the popular vote.
Notwithstanding, it was deeply
influential in American politics.
Norman Thomas, its principal
spokesman during that period and
later, confessed a few years ago
that he had no serious quarrel
with the domestic policies of
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Since
most Goldwater Republicans are
manifestly interested more in the
propagation of their point of
view than in any statistical blitz
kreigs, it will take time to mea
sure the full effect of Mr. Gold
water's candidacy on the public
philosophy.
Conservatism Not Discredited
Assuming, then to repeat -
that the pollsters are correct,
there are precedents aplenty for
American conservatives to resist
such conclusions as many of our
publicists will stampede towards,
to the effect that conservative
principles have for all time been
"discredited." Socialism (alas!t
was not discredited during the
first one-third of the century, not
withstanding its dismal perform
ance at the polls. Nor was th e
Democratic Partv, whose candi

date in 1920 and 1924 received
few votes than any of the na
tionally registered pollsters pre
dict for Senator Goldwater.
The political event of 1904 that
the historians will especially note
1 venture the prediction was
what happened in San Francisco
on July 15, not what happened at
the polls on November 3. There
does remain, to be sure, the ques
tion whether there will l)e a fu
ture for historians to write in.
But then of course that is, in a
way, one of the issues of the cur
rent campaign.

GOP Threatened
It is quite true, for reasons I
have described in a precious an
alysis, that the future of the Re
publican Party is threatened. If
liberal Republicans will here
after refuse to vote for conserva
tive Presidential candidates; and
if conservative Republicans will
tit-for-tat hereafter refuse to vote
for liberal Republican Presiden
tial candidates, then the chances
are at least very good that the
GOP has had it, and that we shall
he left in America either with a
one-party system, or else that we

shall embark upon a convulsive
period at the end of which there
will be a massive political re
grouping, with liberal Republi
cans joining Democratic ranks,
and conservative Democrats join
ing their soulmates either in the
Republican Party, or in a new na
tional party.
Notwithstanding, it was deeply
fewer votes than any of the na-
These are, clearly, possibilities.
Another is that the juices of re
generation will go to work with
in the Republican Party, and that
in due course it will bounce back
- and take power.
The Democrats Of The '20s
Consider some fairly recent fig
ures. As recently as in 1924, the
Democratic Party, under John W.
Davis, managed to get only 28
per cent of the popular vote.
In 1920, the Democrat Cox
(with FDR as his running mate)
got only 34 per cent of the vote,
well below the 37 per cent that
the Republican Landon got in the
year of FDR's greatest triumph,
in 1936. Indeed, in the three Presi
dential elections that immediately
preceded Roosevelt's sweep in
1932, the Democrats averaged less
than 35 per cent of the popular
vote.
If one wishes to concentrate on
the ideological relevance of Mr.

Gold water's candidacy, consider
the fate of the Socialist Party in
American elections between 1900
and 1932. It was a substantial
party. Even so, it averaged only
7 per cent of the popular vote.
Notwithstanding, it was deeply
influential in American politics.
Norman Thomas, its principal
spokesman during that period and
later, confessed a few years ago
that he had no serious quarrel
with the domestic policies of
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Since
most Goldwater Republicans are
manifestly interested more in the
propagation of their point of
view than in any statistical blitz
kreigs, it will take time to mea
sure the full effect of Mr. Gold
water's candidacy on the public
philosophy.
Conservatism Not Discredited
Assuming, then to repeat -
that the pollsters are correct,
there are precedents aplenty for
American conservatives to resist
such conclusions as many of our
publicists will stampede towards,
to the effect that conservative
principles have for all time been
"discredited." Socialism (alas!t
was not discredited during the
first one-third of the century, not
withstanding its dismal perform
ance at the polls. Nor was th e
Democratic Partv, whose candi

date in 1920 and 1924 received
few votes than any of the na
tionally registered pollsters pre
dict for Senator Goldwater.
The political event of 1904 that
the historians will especially note
1 venture the prediction was
what happened in San Francisco
on July 15, not what happened at
the polls on November 3. There
does remain, to be sure, the ques
tion whether there will l)e a fu
ture for historians to write in.
But then of course that is, in a
way, one of the issues of the cur
rent campaign.

liberal Republicans will here
after refuse to vote for conserva
tive Presidential candidates; and
if conservative Republicans will
tit-for-tat hereafter refuse to vote
for liberal Republican Presiden
tial candidates, then the chances
are at least very good that the
GOP has had it, and that we shall
he left in America either with a
one-party system, or else that we

shall embark upon a convulsive
period at the end of which there
will be a massive political re
grouping, with liberal Republi
cans joining Democratic ranks,
and conservative Democrats join
ing their soulmates either in the
Republican Party, or in a new na
tional party.
Notwithstanding, it was deeply
fewer votes than any of the na-
These are, clearly, possibilities.
Another is that the juices of re
generation will go to work with
in the Republican Party, and that
in due course it will bounce back
- and take power.
The Democrats Of The '20s
Consider some fairly recent fig
ures. As recently as in 1924, the
Democratic Party, under John W.
Davis, managed to get only 28
per cent of the popular vote.
In 1920, the Democrat Cox
(with FDR as his running mate)
got only 34 per cent of the vote,
well below the 37 per cent that
the Republican Landon got in the
year of FDR's greatest triumph,
in 1936. Indeed, in the three Presi
dential elections that immediately
preceded Roosevelt's sweep in
1932, the Democrats averaged less
than 35 per cent of the popular
vote.
If one wishes to concentrate on
the ideological relevance of Mr.

Gold water's candidacy, consider
the fate of the Socialist Party in
American elections between 1900
and 1932. It was a substantial
party. Even so, it averaged only
7 per cent of the popular vote.
Notwithstanding, it was deeply
influential in American politics.
Norman Thomas, its principal
spokesman during that period and
later, confessed a few years ago
that he had no serious quarrel
with the domestic policies of
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Since
most Goldwater Republicans are
manifestly interested more in the
propagation of their point of
view than in any statistical blitz
kreigs, it will take time to mea
sure the full effect of Mr. Gold
water's candidacy on the public
philosophy.
Conservatism Not Discredited
Assuming, then to repeat -
that the pollsters are correct,
there are precedents aplenty for
American conservatives to resist
such conclusions as many of our
publicists will stampede towards,
to the effect that conservative
principles have for all time been
"discredited." Socialism (alas!t
was not discredited during the
first one-third of the century, not
withstanding its dismal perform
ance at the polls. Nor was th e
Democratic Partv, whose candi

date in 1920 and 1924 received
few votes than any of the na
tionally registered pollsters pre
dict for Senator Goldwater.
The political event of 1904 that
the historians will especially note
1 venture the prediction was
what happened in San Francisco
on July 15, not what happened at
the polls on November 3. There
does remain, to be sure, the ques
tion whether there will l)e a fu
ture for historians to write in.
But then of course that is, in a
way, one of the issues of the cur
rent campaign.
