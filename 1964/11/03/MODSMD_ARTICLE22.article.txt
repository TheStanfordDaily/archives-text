## Johnson's 1948 'Landslide' 
### 
Wednesday's New York Times
reported that 2,963 illegal voters
I were stricken from the registra-
I tion lists in just two of Chicago's
i 20 wards. II seems that their affi
davits were forged. Ostensibly
: these people resided in grave
' yards, empty lots, etc.
Lite Magazine in the August
14 issue reported on ihe circum
stances of President Johnson's
"election" as Senatorial Candi
-1 date in the 1948 Texas Democratic
i Primary. "Landslide" Lyndon
eventually won by just ST votes.
I It seems that "Coke" Stevenson,
Johnson's opponent and then Gov
ernor, had won by 113 votes. A
j "recanvass" of Box 13 in South
! Texas' Jim Wells county came in
1 giving Stevenson one more vote,
Johnson got 202 .. . and the elec
tion. Investigation revealed that
I surprisingly enough 202 names
j had been added to the voting list
in blue ink and alphabetical or
i der. The "earlier" names were en
tered in random order as they
voted and were written in black
ink. Some of the people who were
on-the "addendum" reported that
they were in Mexico at the time.
Others resided on the local boot
hill. Since further investigation
was warranted, the election rec
ords were subpoenaed by the Fed
eral Court in Fort Worth, but to
no avail. The wife of the County
Clerk had "innocently" burned
them. In such ways are our des
tinies determined.
Politics often is not the hyper
bole you may expect from some
ivy-towered prof who is probably

allergic to cigar smoke. It is pow
er, work ,sweat, emotions, and
scheming. It can be an uplifting
experience and it can be degrad
ing. Vote stealing makes a mock
ery of the democratic process. It
is incumbent upon all of us to
make our elections legal, whether
in Cook County, Illinois, Jim
Wells, Texas, or Santa Clara, Cali
fornia. This can be done only if
well meaning people from both
sides get out and work for their
parties, making sure that no
ward healers usurp the voice of
the people.

Dear Sir:
I congratulate the Daily editor
and his assistants for their valiant
attempt of October 26 to advance
the candidacy of Sen. Gold water
to defend the indefensible. But.
unfortunately, their full-page
product does not measure up to
their effort.
As Sen. Goldwater stumbles
through his campaign, it has
become increasingly more com
mon to urge support for the prin
ciples of conservatism rather
than for its present candidate.
Mr. Naylor has. to an extent, fol
lowed this attempt. He empha
sizes the able men that Gold
water could appoint to run his
administration and the men like
Goldwater who could accomplish
conservatism's ideals. But even
granting that this may be true
and desirable, even granting that
the conservative doctrine may

offer a valid choice, I cannot
grant that this accomplishment
is worth the elevation of Sen.
Goldwater to the Presidency. For
it is the President, not the men
around him. who, in the final
analysis, establishes the policies
and sets the tone of his adminis
stration. The President cannot be
a man who urges the invasion of
Cuba on a whim, who wishes to
leave the problem of civil rights
to unresponsive local authorities,
who easily reverses his positions
on various issues during the
length of a campaign. More im
portant, the President cannot
be a man who turns his political
campaign into an evangelical cru
sade, who does not spe a k to
issues but rather to emotions,
who paints grotesque pictures of
unsafe streets, Godless schools,
and morally corrupt and unpa
triotic government (the old "soft
on Communism" charge), who
criticizes the Supreme Court for
ruling that criminals have cer
tain inalienable rights also, who
compares the Soviet Union with
a schoolyard bully and nuclear
weapons with conventional weap
ons of World War 11. and who
now has finally stated that it was
actually Russia who exploded
the bomb in China. The President
must be a man capable of reflec
tive and rational thought. Let
conservatism find such a man,
let conservatism find a spokes
man who lacks Goldwater's aura
of ignorance and oversimplifica
tion — then let it return to really
offer America a choice.
