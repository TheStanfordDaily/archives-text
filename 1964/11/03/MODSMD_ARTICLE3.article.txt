# Views Aired On Controversial AWS
## 
### BOB BJORING 
The mist of ambiguity which seem
ingly surrounds all Stanford student or
ganizations is nowhere thicker than in
the vicinity of the Associated Women
Students.
At the dinner table one discusses
ASSU, KZSU, or even LASSU, but never
AVVS. This is perhaps because few Stan
ford students have the faintest idea of
the purpose or function of AWS.
Yet, despite its aura of obscurity,
AWS has been attacked as a "useless
organization." AWS president, Chana
Chiba, has vigorously denied these
charges.
Miss Chiba said, "The Associated
Women Students fulfills a need of the
women students at this University pro
viding contact and communication
among the women, both generally and
in small groups, that is provided for the
men through the IFC and ICC."
ON THE OTHER hand, Justin Beck
off-campus LASSLJ representative, stated
"the abolition of AWS would provide a
very useful function by ridding the cam
pus of one more useless organization."
The AWS formed within itself a
group for self-study and improvement.

The committee, headed by sophomore
Sandra Anselmo, will look into "the in
consistencies of the ASSU by-laws con
cerning AWS and the inconsistencies in
the structure of AWS itself." Miss An
selmo stated that "we hope change will
bring about improvement."
BECK, an ex-officio member of the
self-study group, said he thought that
"change is not necessarily the only solu
tion."
What are the current laws of the
AWS, its statement of purpose, its ac
tions in the past, and its importance on
campus?
The AWS is not a body of malicious
women who, after disappointing frosh
dolly experiences, have decided to make
the world unsafe for dating.
THE NOTES for the AWS Handbook
state the principles underlying formula
lion of the social regulations. The pur
pose of the social regulations is five
fold:
• "To describe the minimal stand
ards of conduct consistent with the
Fundamental Standard;
• "To give a woman as much freedom
as practical so that she can develop her
good judgment and social maturity;
• "Safety;

• "To enable the University to con
tact a woman in case of an emergency;
• "And to provide a structure that:
may be of assistance to the woman who
may need it."
ANOTHER AREA which fell under
Beck's criticism was the Projects Com
mittee of the AWS. Beck questioned the
value of presenting Margaret Kahn to
speak on glamour.
President Chana Chiba admits: "Proj
ects are our weakest area. We do have
a limited budget, and it is not really pos
sible to get a first-rate speakers program.
We can't provide travel expenses, we just
have to hope that the people will drop
nearby."
"In addition to this," Miss Chiba con
tinued, "a great deal of our projects are
composed of meetings and get-togethers
that, no one hears about. While all the
frosh boys are off learning about ROTC,
the women meet the Dean of Women.
AWS takes care of that."
Exchanges between women's dormi
tories, a program that the girls enjoy
according to house presidents' reports,
was initiated and expanded under AWS,
she said.
LAST YEAR president Sydne Rogers
made the exchanges available on Tues

days and Wednesdays instead of just
weekends. This year they are available
on all days.
Miss Roger's notes included the
following items for consideration by the
next Board.
"Provide list of outstanding and inter
esting women in Stanford community.
Possible guest list. Integrate frosh in
upper-class dorms. DEAD Dead Week!
Reading period before finals. More In
formal Social Functions on Campus!
First quarter sophs to live with upper
class women ... in the big dorms!"
WHETHER or not the AWS can pro
vide these programs and projects is spec
ulatory. AWS, however, does provide an
initial point for the working of such
plans.
More clearly defined jobs of AWS
include gathering the opinions of the
women and bringing them to the Com
mittee on Building and Grounds; con
ducting the Draw system lottery; and
disseminating the plans of the Adminis
tration to the women.
The administrative organization
necessary to accomplish these tasks is
termed by Beck "an imposing hierarchy."
Miss Chiba calls it an "efficient dissemi
nation structure."
