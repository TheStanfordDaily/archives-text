### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
LASS Us recently - formed
Committee to Investigate the
Judicial Process at Stanford was
told by Speaker Ed Shaw last
night that the students "must
strengthen their own judicial sys
tem internally" before expecting
more responsibility.
Committee Chairmen Steve
Stern identified the areas in which
the committee would work as
"judicial structure; judicial pro
cedures; and the relationship of
the student judicial system to the
University administration."
Roth Shaw and Stern agree that
the current ASSU constitution
and by-laws contain numerous in
consistencies and omissions, Stern
noting that "over a period of
years a network of subordinate
councils, none recognized in the
by-laws, has arisen, greatly com
plicating the entire judicial proc
ess."
THE COMMITTEE began work
by studying the current judicial
structure and process. "For the
foreseeable future, the commit
tee's study of procedure will only
follow procedures up to and in
cluding those of the Judicial Coun
cil itself."
Committee members are, in ad
dition to Stern, Jim Huey, Mar
tha Evans, Ken Kennedy, Julie
Stulee, Mike Dorsey, and Sue Bur
night. Pat Halligan was named by
Stern as the committee's staff di
rector.
The chairman added that any
non-legislators who wish to work
with the committee as special
staff members may apply in the
ASSU Office.
The committee was originally
proposed by Stern along with a
proposal to continue the commit
tee on executive and legislative
reorganization. Both proposals
were accepted by the Legislature
in amended form at its last meet
ing. Oct. 22.
