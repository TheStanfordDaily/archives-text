## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
"It you ever want, proof of the impact of in
dividual effort on a society, it's what's been done
in one year in the State of Mississippi,'' commented
former Stanford professor Allard K. Lowenstein in
an interview yesterday.
Lowenstein, assistant dean of men in 1961,
assessed Stanford's contribution to the Mississippi
Movement during a brief visit here between chores
as a campaign aid to Vice Presidential candidate
Hubert 11. Humphrey.
HIS was appropriate, tor il was his
arrest in Mississippi, nearly one year ago, that lirst
focused campus attention on the problems of the
"Closed Society."
Since that time, Stanford has raised over $8,000
for rights efforts in Mississippi and has sent 40
members of its community to work as volunteers
in the Freedom Project.
"I'm not a historical determinist," Lowenstein
stressed . "Nothing is inevitable." "But, in fact,
what Stanford did the incredible array of talent
that has poured out of this community has had
an absolutely crucial impact on the whole Missis
sippi Movement."
"IT'S II.XI) an impact <>n the Stanford campus,
too," Lowenstein continued. "Change is never

final; there are always forces of counter change j
at work. . . . But nothing will ever be quite as it
was before. If nothing else, this whole involve
ment has destroyed forever the myth of the Apa-;
thctic Generation."
"Since the tremendous enthusiasm for the
Peace Corps," Lowenstein continued, "everyone
has suspected that one of the hallmarks of this ,
generation is its desire to serve. . . . What was
extraordinary about Mississippi, was to have this
desire to serve express itself on a controversial
social question whose solution is trough! with per
sonal danger."
IF NOTHING IiI.SK, he emphasized, the in
volvement of large numbers of white northern stu
dents has allowed the Mississippi Movement to ac
complish a long-needed "desegregation" of itself. ,
"This intensive student participation came at
an absolutely crucial time to break up what was
a potentially racist situation." he said.
It is difficult to predict w hat future course the
Mississippi Movement will follow, Lowenstein
stressed.
"It's hard to see the ultimate. There are some
doors open now. The question is whether you go
through them or not."
But whatever the future, the progress made in
Mississippi iu the recent past is incalculable, he
said. I

what Stanford did the incredible array of talent
that has poured out of this community has had
an absolutely crucial impact on the whole Missis

final; there are always forces of counter change j
at work. . . . But nothing will ever be quite as it
was before. If nothing else, this whole involve

"Since the tremendous enthusiasm for the
Peace Corps," Lowenstein continued, "everyone
has suspected that one of the hallmarks of this ,
generation is its desire to serve. . . . What was
extraordinary about Mississippi, was to have this
desire to serve express itself on a controversial
social question whose solution is trough! with per
sonal danger."

"It you ever want, proof of the impact of in
dividual effort on a society, it's what's been done
in one year in the State of Mississippi,'' commented
former Stanford professor Allard K. Lowenstein in
an interview yesterday.
Lowenstein, assistant dean of men in 1961,
assessed Stanford's contribution to the Mississippi
Movement during a brief visit here between chores
as a campaign aid to Vice Presidential candidate
Hubert 11. Humphrey.
HIS was appropriate, tor il was his
arrest in Mississippi, nearly one year ago, that lirst
focused campus attention on the problems of the
"Closed Society."
Since that time, Stanford has raised over $8,000
for rights efforts in Mississippi and has sent 40
members of its community to work as volunteers
in the Freedom Project.
