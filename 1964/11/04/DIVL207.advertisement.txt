We talk to horses...
| ... and this horse talks back. It's all lit
J a day's work here at Mattel Toymakers.
| You see, we make that amazing talking
j hobby horse, Blaze.™ And those fan
tastic-sounding V-RROOM!™ toys—
! the ones with the. real motor roar. And
I lots of others. Maybe you've heard of
I us. Anyway, we started out as a fairly
small company. And in a short period
of time, we've managed to herome not
i only the largest toymakers in the
' world, but a major factor in the girl's
j fashion field (with our new subsidiary,
j Mattel Fashions, Inc.).
Now, that kind of growth is very
' nice. And it's made us very proud. But',
it's also caused some problems. For one
j thing, it's created quite a need for
| ambitious, imaginative young people
j who can grow into key management
j positions. People who are intrigued
| with the challenge of a frankly boom-
I ing company. People who work in such
areas as Accounting, Finance, Market
ing, Production, the Commercial Arts
I and Administration.
Because our growth has been Loth
constant and rapid, there's more oppor
j tunity for advancement — especially
among our middle management people
(who, incidentally, probably average
the youngest of any company in South
ern California).
Here at Mattel you'll find vital
people doing exciting work. Which is
! satisfying. Using the latest tools of
! modern business. Which is also satis
fying. Making products that have
changed an industry. Which is very
satisfying. If you have the education
and drive we need... and you think
you'd like this stimulating kind of
why not talk it over with us?
