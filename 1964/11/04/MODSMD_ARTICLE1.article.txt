# LYNDON LEADS DEMOCRATIC SWEEP
## Deep South Votes For Goldwater 
### 
(AP) President Lyndon B.
Johnson, running as powerfully
as pre-election polls had pre
dicted, rolled to a landslide vic
tory over Senator Harry Gold
water Tuesday night, sweeping
Democratie senators, representa
tives and governors into office
with him.
With 80 per cent of the pre
cincts reporting, Johnson had 34,-
•113,913 voles to Gold water's 21,-
347,75(5.
In electoral votes the President
led IGo to 17 with 270 needed for
elect ion.
Johnson's landslide helped to
bolster substantially Democratic
margins in both houses of Con
gress. Latest returns showed 26
I )emocrats and ti .Republicans had
been elected to the Senate. In ad
dition one Democrat and two Re
publicans were leading.
233 Democrats and S3 Republi
cans had gained election to the
House. 53 Democrats and 54 Re
publicans were leading in races.
This will result in a net gain of
25 io 10 Democratic seats in the
House.
Denison Kitchel, Goldwater's
campaign manager, said late
Tuesday night "We have to wait
four years, but we're going to get
this government back where it be
longs."
"It's not over yet," Kitchel
added. "But there's no reason to
he very optimistic." Goldwater
was descriped as "disappointed
but not yet convinced."
Goldwater, who just before the
election had predicted the "upset
of the century," had won only
four Deep South States - South
Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama
and Louisiana at the time.
Johnson's landslide victory was
apparent to many observers from
the very beginning, when Ken
tucky. a state which has voted
Republican in the last two elec
tions, jumped onto the President's
bandwagon.
Johnson's svveep faltered only
in tho South, as victories piled up
ii. New England, the East, the
Midwest and on into California —
one of Goldwater's "must" states.
Even Maine and Vermont, tradi
tional Republican bastions, broke
with the past and went Demo
cratic.
In the last count of 25 guber
natorial races, Democrats had
won in 12 states - Indiana, Illi
nois. Vermont, New Hampshire,
Florida, North Carolina, Texas,
Deleware, Nebraska, Missouri,
lowa, and West Virginia.
Incumbent Democratic governor
Otio Ivor nor defeated Republican
Charles Percy in a race that had
received much national attention.
In Michigan Governor George
Romncy romped to a surprisingly
easy re-election over Democrat
Neil Staebler, congrcssman-at
large.
Romney's re-election was one
of the few bright notes in the
election for Republican candi
dates, who were running better
than Goldwater, but not well
enough to wrest away control
from the Democratic party.
In addition to Michigan, Repub
licans kept the governorship in
Rhode Island where Governor
John H. Chaffe won a second
two-year term.
Democratic incumbents who
fell before the GOP uprising in
the South were William A. Win
stead of Mississippi, in the House
22 years, and three Alabamans
George Grant, George Iluddleston
and Kenneth Roberts.
In an impromptu news confer
ence held soon after he voted
Tuesday, Johnson said he would
try to unite the country and heal
campaign divisions by attempting
to "make the government as bi
partisan as possible."

(AP) President Lyndon B.
Johnson, running as powerfully
as pre-election polls had pre
dicted, rolled to a landslide vic
tory over Senator Harry Gold
water Tuesday night, sweeping
Democratie senators, representa
tives and governors into office
with him.
With 80 per cent of the pre
cincts reporting, Johnson had 34,-
•113,913 voles to Gold water's 21,-
347,75(5.
In electoral votes the President
led IGo to 17 with 270 needed for
elect ion.
Johnson's landslide helped to
bolster substantially Democratic
margins in both houses of Con
gress. Latest returns showed 26
I )emocrats and ti .Republicans had
been elected to the Senate. In ad
dition one Democrat and two Re
publicans were leading.
233 Democrats and S3 Republi
cans had gained election to the
House. 53 Democrats and 54 Re
publicans were leading in races.
This will result in a net gain of
25 io 10 Democratic seats in the
House.
Denison Kitchel, Goldwater's
campaign manager, said late
Tuesday night "We have to wait
four years, but we're going to get
this government back where it be
longs."
"It's not over yet," Kitchel
added. "But there's no reason to
he very optimistic." Goldwater
was descriped as "disappointed
but not yet convinced."
Goldwater, who just before the
election had predicted the "upset
of the century," had won only
four Deep South States - South
Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama
and Louisiana at the time.
Johnson's landslide victory was
apparent to many observers from
the very beginning, when Ken
tucky. a state which has voted
Republican in the last two elec
tions, jumped onto the President's
bandwagon.
Johnson's svveep faltered only
