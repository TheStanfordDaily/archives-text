## Big Test: Indian Savvy Vs. Brawn 
### PETE EAKLAND 
The Big Game against Cal will always bo the traditional must
game on Stanford's schedule whose outcome will decide the ultimate
success of a season. But the Southern California series, filled with
much tradition and feeling, is a clear-cut second to Big Game.
Don Liebendorfer, Ihe director of sports publicity, remembers Ihe
days in the '30s when as many as ten special trains carried the ma
jority of the Farm's students to enemy territory for the weekend of
the SC tilt. And when the game was at Stanford Stadium, SC troops
came northward in equal numbers.
BRAINS VS. BRAWN
Many of the players on Stanford's team live in Southern Califor
nia and would feel great satisfaction in pinning a loss on L.A.'s col
lege football pride, the Trojans. Also, Southern California is the
only other private institution in the PAC besides Stanford.
Furthermore, there is a faint note of revenge in the rivalry. Un
like Cal and Stanford, which are similar institutions in objectives
and methods, SC and Stanford are commonly pictured as being
distinct opposites. With some validity, the game could be tabbed
"Brains vs. Brawn."
Southern California has always prided itself on the accomplish
ments of its athletic teams. To make sure it stays on top, it brings
in many athletes who are marginal academically. And it engages in
an intense recruiting program. In short, Southern California has
a cocky attitude towards sports, and because they expect to win,
they take defeat hard, which makes them all the more enjoyable to
knock off. The publicity agent for the Trojans, talking about the
Washington setback, said that the loss dissolved their season. Stan
ford can't have much sympathy for such an attitude. We lost to
Washington and it didn't dissolve our season. Then he bemoaned
the fact that ten of the lop twenty-two Trojans are sideline cases.
Another case for deep sympathy. SC has about as many depth prob
lems as a Roman phalanx.
The team will be up for the game, as it has been for each of the
games this season. The spirit was great at Oregon when the Indians
sent the Ducks in a swan dive from the national rankings. Oregon's
defensive unit, dubbed "Casey's Commandos," took a beating from
the Tribe offense and in fact it was "Chappie's Commandos"
led by raiders Ross and Rath, pirate Pettigrew, and henchmen Hib
ler and Howard who ripped assunder any semblance of an offensive
drive. Their guerrilla tactics should be at least as effective against
1 he Trojans.
The rivalry has gone pretty much true 1o form, upsets being
1 rare exception rather than the rule. The last big upset was the 1951
toppling of SC. Both teams entered the game undefeated, but SC
! was the favorite. Scoring 20 points in the second half, 14 in the last
five minutes of the game, Iho Indians bounced from a seven point
i deficit to win, 27-20.
VOW BOYS WOW 'EM
Then there's the story of the Vow Boys, one of Stanford's most
colorful elevens. The formation of the famous Vow look place after
i the 1932 SC game won by the Trojans, 13-0.
Only freshmen, Ihey turned a remark by Frankie Alustiza, into
a team pledge "They will never do that to our team. We will never
lose to the Trojans," and they didn't either. The unbeatable young
sters edged out the Trojans 13-7 on two fourth quarter field goals
i to stop a long SC winning streak the next year, and won 160 and
I 3-0 the two following years to keep their vow.
