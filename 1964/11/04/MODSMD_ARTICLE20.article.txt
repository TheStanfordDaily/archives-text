As our press deadline approaches, the mount
ing returns show an overwhelming victory for
I A'ndon Johnson.
We would not be candid il we did not ad
mil a profound disappointment at the outcome
ol tin's election and at the quality of the cam
paign which preceded it.
Those who sympathize with the conservative
viewpoint can only regret that this year of deci
sions, a year that is potentially a turning
point in the history of the United States, was
so wasted. What a tragedy it is that in a con
frontation such as this, the men heading the
parties were not adequate to the challenging
task of conducting a reasoned, high level, mean
ingful exchange on the great issues of our time.
\\ ith the disappointment over the campaign
is mixed a heartsiekness at the bitterness and
hatred which appeared throughout—in editorials
and columns of respected journals of opinion,
in campaign literature, and in even the normally
friendly personal relations of reasonable men.
But the campaign is over, and in the days
ahead we can expect a flood of analysis of its
implications.
It will be charged vigorously that the election
represents a monumental repudiation of conser
vatism and, perhaps, a mandate from the people

for the politics and programs of Lyndon John
son.
Such conclusions are certainly not justified
Irom the evidence at hand. This, after all, was
not a campaign on the issues, hut on personali
ties; not on the candidates' philosophies of gov
ernment, hut on which man was the "lesser of
two evils."
The campaign of 1964, despite its low qual
ity, has left a deep mark on the face of American
polities. The political map of this country—let
there he no mistake—has undergone a revolution
in the past lour months.
Now in the American political conscience
there is a new, if somewhat binned awareness
of an alternative to the foreign and domestic
policies of the past three decades.
Within the next four years, the programs of
the incumbent will be tested as never before
against the charges made in this campaign.
We can only hope that in 196S the American
people, seeing the folly of the prevailing phil
osophy of government, will reverse the decision
they made so forcefully yesterday.
1964 should be the year of the first step to
ward long-needed reforms, not the year in which
we closed our minds to real alternatives; it should
be the beginning of a change, not the end of a
choice.

hatred which appeared throughout—in editorials
and columns of respected journals of opinion,
in campaign literature, and in even the normally
friendly personal relations of reasonable men.
But the campaign is over, and in the days
ahead we can expect a flood of analysis of its
implications.
It will be charged vigorously that the election
represents a monumental repudiation of conser
vatism and, perhaps, a mandate from the people

for the politics and programs of Lyndon John
son.
Such conclusions are certainly not justified
Irom the evidence at hand. This, after all, was
not a campaign on the issues, hut on personali
ties; not on the candidates' philosophies of gov
ernment, hut on which man was the "lesser of
two evils."
The campaign of 1964, despite its low qual
ity, has left a deep mark on the face of American
polities. The political map of this country—let
there he no mistake—has undergone a revolution
in the past lour months.
Now in the American political conscience
there is a new, if somewhat binned awareness
of an alternative to the foreign and domestic
policies of the past three decades.
Within the next four years, the programs of
the incumbent will be tested as never before
against the charges made in this campaign.
We can only hope that in 196S the American
people, seeing the folly of the prevailing phil
osophy of government, will reverse the decision
they made so forcefully yesterday.
1964 should be the year of the first step to
ward long-needed reforms, not the year in which
we closed our minds to real alternatives; it should
be the beginning of a change, not the end of a
choice.
As our press deadline approaches, the mount
ing returns show an overwhelming victory for
I A'ndon Johnson.
We would not be candid il we did not ad
mil a profound disappointment at the outcome
ol tin's election and at the quality of the cam
paign which preceded it.
Those who sympathize with the conservative
viewpoint can only regret that this year of deci
sions, a year that is potentially a turning
point in the history of the United States, was
so wasted. What a tragedy it is that in a con
frontation such as this, the men heading the
parties were not adequate to the challenging
task of conducting a reasoned, high level, mean
ingful exchange on the great issues of our time.
\\ ith the disappointment over the campaign
is mixed a heartsiekness at the bitterness and
hatred which appeared throughout—in editorials
and columns of respected journals of opinion,
in campaign literature, and in even the normally
friendly personal relations of reasonable men.
