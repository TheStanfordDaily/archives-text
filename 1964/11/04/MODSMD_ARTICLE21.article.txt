## LBJ 'Merits Respect, Support' 
### 
Dear Sir:
The time has come to make
one tiling clear. We like Lyndon
Johnson as a man and as a presi
dent.
When he was Senate Majority

Leader during the Eisenhower ad
ministration, he worked closely
I with Eisenhower and proved his
concern for our national welfare.
He has shown great courage by
i going to New Orleans during t lie
: current campaign and making
clear that he supports civil rights
and equal opportunities for Ne
| groes. Meanwhile, Goldwater has
done his best to collect the "back
j lash vote. Johnson has shown
! both labor and management that
I they are expected to solve their
mutual problems and, in the proe
| ess. he lias quieted the great rail
road controversy. In foreign pol
icy, he has shown great forceful
ness combined with discretion.
The retribution dealt the North
Vietnamese for the Tonkin Gulf
j incidents was swift, precise and
| measured.
As a person, Mr. Johnson is as
j human as the rest of us. He likes
I people, loves a good .joke and ob
i viously has deep concern for the
I welfare of our people. Like other
j politicians he is an egotist and
I he is reputed to have quite a tern
| per, but he has kept these in care
! ful check. His statements do not
need explanation, clarification,
restatement and reclarifieation.
They are easily understood and
calmly made. He has enough con
fidence in America that he can
remain calm and rational in time
of crisis.

Dear Sir:
In Thursday's Daily Mr. Wil-:
liam F. Buckley, Jr.. in discuss-1
ing our perpetual farm problem,!
wrote as follows:
"... The program cannot be;
eliminated altogether. Granted
that no one of intellectual probity
will stand up and defend the ex
isting distortions, it is another!
question altogether to find a poli- j
tieian who will stand up and sug-:
gest that something ought to be
done about it. Senator Goldwater
is on record in his book. The Con
science of a Conservative, as sug- i
gesting that something should be
done, for instance. What?"
Mr. Buckley sidesteps his own j
question slightly by going on to
discuss the proposals of Profes
sor Van den Haag for limiting!
farm subsidy payments to those
with incomes under $7,000 per
year.
Wondering what the senator
himself had proposed, I referred
to The ( on science of a Conserva-:
five and found the following j
(Hillman edition, p. 43.):
"... What has been lacking is!
not an understanding of a prob-j
lem it is really quite impossible
not to understand, but the politi
cal courage to do something about
it.
"Doing something about it
means and their can be no
equivocation here - prompt and
final termination of the farm sub
sidy program."
The boldface are the senator's.

Dear Sir:
The time has come to make
one tiling clear. We like Lyndon
Johnson as a man and as a presi
dent.
When he was Senate Majority

Leader during the Eisenhower ad
ministration, he worked closely
I with Eisenhower and proved his
concern for our national welfare.
He has shown great courage by
i going to New Orleans during t lie
: current campaign and making
clear that he supports civil rights
and equal opportunities for Ne
| groes. Meanwhile, Goldwater has
done his best to collect the "back
j lash vote. Johnson has shown
! both labor and management that
I they are expected to solve their
mutual problems and, in the proe
| ess. he lias quieted the great rail
road controversy. In foreign pol
icy, he has shown great forceful
ness combined with discretion.
The retribution dealt the North
Vietnamese for the Tonkin Gulf
j incidents was swift, precise and
| measured.
As a person, Mr. Johnson is as
j human as the rest of us. He likes
I people, loves a good .joke and ob
i viously has deep concern for the
I welfare of our people. Like other
j politicians he is an egotist and
I he is reputed to have quite a tern
| per, but he has kept these in care
! ful check. His statements do not
need explanation, clarification,
restatement and reclarifieation.
They are easily understood and
calmly made. He has enough con
fidence in America that he can
remain calm and rational in time
of crisis.

Dear Sir:
In Thursday's Daily Mr. Wil-:
liam F. Buckley, Jr.. in discuss-1
ing our perpetual farm problem,!
wrote as follows:
"... The program cannot be;
eliminated altogether. Granted
that no one of intellectual probity
will stand up and defend the ex
isting distortions, it is another!
question altogether to find a poli- j
tieian who will stand up and sug-:
gest that something ought to be
done about it. Senator Goldwater
is on record in his book. The Con
science of a Conservative, as sug- i
gesting that something should be
done, for instance. What?"
Mr. Buckley sidesteps his own j
question slightly by going on to
discuss the proposals of Profes
sor Van den Haag for limiting!
farm subsidy payments to those
with incomes under $7,000 per
year.
Wondering what the senator
himself had proposed, I referred
to The ( on science of a Conserva-:

(Hillman edition, p. 43.):
"... What has been lacking is!
