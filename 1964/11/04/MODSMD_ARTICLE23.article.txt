# 'Fail Safe' Is Absorbing, Sober, Compelling Drama
## 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
la spite of its being the latest;
in a series of movies about the
trials and tribulations of 1 ho
President. and consequently
cursed with what have now be
come their cliches, Fail Safe
nevertheless is a visually exciting
and emotionally absorbing pic
ture. (Whether it really could hap
pen, however, is a function of the
intellect that ought to be consid
ered later and elsewhere.)
And so, chronicling its nimble
avoidance of ihe yawning gulfs
that open all around it is t lie best j
way to recount its not inconsider
able virtues.
Probably the most gaping of,
them all is the Fail Safe Box that !
triggers the whole mess. A more
unreal name and a more bogus
looking contraption could not pos
sibly have been found. Mercifully,
ii is all but forgotten after those;
painful minutes when it unac- j
countably goes awry.
The next largest chasm is re-j
sponsibility. Again, fortunately,
the immediate culprit, the mili-.
tary, is justly passed over, and
the ultimate causes, fear and dis
trust among men, are blamed in
stead. And they, in turn, are saved
from the triteness of the "Adam
and Eve and the Serpent in the
Garden" cliche by not being
blamed too much.
The President
These alone would make Fail
Safe enjoyable; the rest of its!
accomplishments make it very j
fine indeed. And not among the
least is the President. By now!
everybody is tired of hearing that j
Chief Executives are lonely, over-1
worked, totally dependent on their j
cabinets for information and ad
vice, and so on ad nauseum.
Sidney Lumct, the director, has |
summarized all this in one master
fully understated gesture: he
locks the President in a sound
proof room, devoid of papers,

beagles, and all the clutter of a
normal office, and makes the only
connection with the outside world
an interpreter and a telephone
console. He accomplishes effort
lessly what words never could,
and he does it better.
Civilian-Military Motif
Equally adroitly handled is the
civilian-military motif. For this,
Eugene Burdick and Harvey
Whaler, who wrote the novel, de
serve the praise. To the usual
moronic generals, timid admirals,
and battle-mad colonels, they
have added one perceptive, hu
mane brigadier and the four-star
commander of SAC, who are will
ing to make the necessary sacri
fices in spite of tragic conse
quences. By the same token, the
civilians who always know it all
are just this once dead wrong.
Finally, since nearly everyone
must have heard what happens
that cannot be what engrosses
the viewer. Rather, what holds
him is a shifting identification
with all the characters, thanks to
fine acting by all concerned, and
the numbing grimness that per
vades Fail Safe, thanks to excel
lent direction and professional
writing.
What comes of all these poten
tial disasters is two hours of
sober, compelling drama, among
the best in town.

trust among men, are blamed in
stead. And they, in turn, are saved
from the triteness of the "Adam
and Eve and the Serpent in the
Garden" cliche by not being
blamed too much.
The President
These alone would make Fail
Safe enjoyable; the rest of its!
accomplishments make it very j
fine indeed. And not among the
least is the President. By now!
everybody is tired of hearing that j
Chief Executives are lonely, over-1
worked, totally dependent on their j
cabinets for information and ad
vice, and so on ad nauseum.
Sidney Lumct, the director, has |
summarized all this in one master
fully understated gesture: he
locks the President in a sound
proof room, devoid of papers,

beagles, and all the clutter of a
normal office, and makes the only
connection with the outside world
an interpreter and a telephone
console. He accomplishes effort
lessly what words never could,
and he does it better.
Civilian-Military Motif
Equally adroitly handled is the
civilian-military motif. For this,
Eugene Burdick and Harvey
Whaler, who wrote the novel, de
serve the praise. To the usual
moronic generals, timid admirals,
and battle-mad colonels, they
have added one perceptive, hu
mane brigadier and the four-star
commander of SAC, who are will
ing to make the necessary sacri
fices in spite of tragic conse
quences. By the same token, the
civilians who always know it all
are just this once dead wrong.
Finally, since nearly everyone
must have heard what happens
that cannot be what engrosses
the viewer. Rather, what holds
him is a shifting identification
with all the characters, thanks to
fine acting by all concerned, and
the numbing grimness that per
vades Fail Safe, thanks to excel
lent direction and professional
writing.
What comes of all these poten
tial disasters is two hours of
sober, compelling drama, among
the best in town.
la spite of its being the latest;
in a series of movies about the
trials and tribulations of 1 ho
President. and consequently
cursed with what have now be
come their cliches, Fail Safe
nevertheless is a visually exciting
and emotionally absorbing pic
ture. (Whether it really could hap
pen, however, is a function of the
intellect that ought to be consid
ered later and elsewhere.)
And so, chronicling its nimble
avoidance of ihe yawning gulfs
that open all around it is t lie best j
way to recount its not inconsider
able virtues.
Probably the most gaping of,
them all is the Fail Safe Box that !
triggers the whole mess. A more
unreal name and a more bogus
looking contraption could not pos
sibly have been found. Mercifully,
ii is all but forgotten after those;
painful minutes when it unac- j
countably goes awry.
The next largest chasm is re-j
sponsibility. Again, fortunately,
the immediate culprit, the mili-.
tary, is justly passed over, and
the ultimate causes, fear and dis
trust among men, are blamed in
stead. And they, in turn, are saved
from the triteness of the "Adam
and Eve and the Serpent in the
Garden" cliche by not being
blamed too much.
