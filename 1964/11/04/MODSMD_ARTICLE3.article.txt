## Voters Endorse Prop. 14; Gubser, Younger Returned 
### 
<AP) California voters ap
proved Tuesday night an initia
tive measure writing off state and
local laws against racial discrim
ination in housing.
Proposition 14. which would
nullify anti-discrimination hous
ing statutes and assure property
owners absolute discretion to re
fuse to sell or rent to any person
for any reason, held a steady
margin of 3-2.
Returns from 3.133 of the
state's 31,198 precincts showed
2 10,562 yes votes to 169,000 no.
Polls had shown the measure
favored despite a campaign in
which most of the political, reli
gious and labor union leaders of

the state opposed the proposed
amendment to the State Constitu
t ion.
Opponents, led by Democratic
Gov. Brown, conceded their cause
appeared to be lost. They prom
ised a fast court test of the initia
tive measure, which they said
was unconstitutional.
IN OTHER California measures,
voters indicated disapproval of a
state-wide lottery plan and pay
TV. but gave three state bond
issues solid leads.
Proposition 10. which dealt
with a state-franchised but pri
vately operated lottery, was being
beaten by a margin of nearly 31
in early returns.
Proposition 1 a measure to
ban pay TV in private homes,

held a firm and increasing margin
of better than 2-1.
THK THREE bond issues, call
ing for $790 million in state
spending, all held what appeared
to be comfortable leads.
In the California race for the
House of Representatives, early
returns indicale a victory for
Charles Gubser <R> over Day
Carmen < D) in the 10th Congres
sional District.
, In the 11th district Younger (Fit
i was leading over Mark Sullivan
(I)i, 106,083 to 89,799.
GOV. EDMUND <i. BROWN
| said Tuesday night: "I am dis
appointed by the passage of
Proposition 11 but Ido not regard
the election as the end of Cali
i fornia's fight against discrimina
tion and segregation in housing."
The Democratic governor
; added: "It is not the end but a
j new beginning in the effort
against segregation."
He challenged the California
Real Estate Association, which
led the Proposition 11 campaign,
to "come forward now with sug-
I gestion and programs for solving
the discrimination which it pro
! fesses to abhor and which it
claims can be eliminated w i th
i voluntary efforts."
BOVVN ADDED in a statement
1 released in Los Angeles:
"For the first time, tens of
thousands of persons from many
different walks of life from
churches, civic organizations,
unions, and professional groups
worked together and became
deeply involved in a critical prob
lem of human relations.
"That magnificent effort must
not, and shall not. have been in
vain. For wc now will move for
ward vs ith new approaches to
solve the problems which Propo
; s;ition 11 left behind.
