PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S vot
ing sweep over Senator Barry
Goldwater for the presidency
I contrasted sharply with the vie
j tory by Murphy, former Holly-
I wood actor.
Salinger had been appointed by
California Gov. Edmund G. "Pat"
Brown to fill out the term of the
j late Senator Clair Engle.
Late polls on the Senate con-
I test, indicated a close race, though
; a relatively large percentage of
voters had remained undecided.
California Democrats counted
jon a l - million margin in voter
! registration to put Salinger over
i the top. but voters split their bal
lot choices in large numbers.
Murphy in Los Angeles said!
that he wanted to "thank the
press for its good treatment dur
i ing the campaign. Then endorse
i ments by the press helped a great
| deal."
The senator-elect, joined by his
; family and supporters admitted,
j "I'm trying to play it cool but
I'm really very pleased."

Kennedy defeated incumbent Re
publican Kenneth B. Keating in

i Senator Pierre Salinger yester
day, sending Murphy to the U.S.

Late polls on the Senate con-
I test, indicated a close race, though
; a relatively large percentage of
voters had remained undecided.
California Democrats counted
jon a l - million margin in voter
! registration to put Salinger over
i the top. but voters split their bal
lot choices in large numbers.
Murphy in Los Angeles said!
that he wanted to "thank the
press for its good treatment dur
i ing the campaign. Then endorse
i ments by the press helped a great
| deal."
The senator-elect, joined by his
; family and supporters admitted,
j "I'm trying to play it cool but
I'm really very pleased."
