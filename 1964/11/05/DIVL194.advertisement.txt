At the 1964 stockholders' meeting, Arjay Miller,
President of Ford Motor Company, emphasized the
Company's far-sighted recruitment program and its accent
on developing management talent:
"One aspect of our planning is crucial to the success of
everything else we do. It engages the best thoughts and efforts of
our whole management team, from top to bottom, throughout the
world. I am speaking of the development of management. The
immediate future of our Company depends heavily upon the abilities
of the people who are now key members of our management team.
"In the longer run, our future depends on what we are doing at
the present time to attract and develop the people who will
be making the major decisions 10 to 20 years from now. We are
developing management competence in depth in order to attack the
problems that will confront a company of great growth—and
great growth (both in profits and sales) is exactly the goal
we have established for Ford Motor Company.
"We are continuing to emphasize recruiting. Last spring, 180 of our
management people devoted part of their time to recruiting
outstanding graduates from colleges and universities throughout
the U.S. Last year, these efforts resulted in our hiring over
1,000 graduates, 220 more than the year before.
"We are seeking and we are finding young men—and young women,
too—with brains and backbone—people who have the ability and
the desire to make room for themselves at the top. We give our
trainees challenging assignments with as much responsibility as
they can carry. We promote them as fast as they are ready. Those
who are interested in easy security soon drop out. Those who
have what we want stay with us, and move up quickly to increased
responsibility and the pay that goes with it. Thanks to the quality
of the people we are recruiting and developing, I am firmly
convinced that our outlook is most promising."
