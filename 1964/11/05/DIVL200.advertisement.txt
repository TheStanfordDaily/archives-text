The Powers that Be
Election-time and the nation has gone to the polls to select the men God
has chosen to rule over us. For as men move freely, God acts sovereignly:
"Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no
authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God"
(Romans 13:1).
A proper view of God, a glimpse of His greatness will dispel quickly all
doubt and concern about the powers that be, for God is very much in charge
over all that happens in the world which He Himself brought into being.
"Have you not known, have you not heard? Has it not been told you from
the beginning? Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? It
is He who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are like grass
hoppers,- who stretches out the heavens like a curtain, and spreads them like a
tent to dwell in; who brings princes to nought, and makes rulers of the earth
as nothing. Scarcely are they planted, scarcely sown, scarcely has their stem
taken root in the earth, when He blows upon them, and they wither, and the
tempest carries them off like stubble" (Isaiah 40:21-74).
All rulers, all powers, all authorities hold office because God has placed
them where they are. This includes the Hitlers, the Stalins, the Khrushchevs, the
Brezhnevs. About 600 B.C. a king named Nebuchadnezzar discovered that God
is very much in charge of all the universe. After quite a wrestling match with
God, this great king finally came to the point where he saw reality: "I Nebu
chadnezzar lifted up mine eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and
I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored Him who lives forever; for
His dominion is an everlasting dominion, and His kingdom endures from genera- ;
tion to generation; all the inhabitants of the earth are accounted as nothing; |
and He does according to His will in the host of heaven and among the in- j
habitants of the earth; and none can stay His hand or say to Him, 'what doest |
thou?' . . . Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the King of j
heaven; for all His works are right and His ways are just; and those who walk !
in pride He is able to abase" (Daniel 3:34-37).
You,, like Nebuchadnezzar, can know this Sovereign, Reigning God. You
need not become a leader or king to find out who is in charge of everything.
Ultimately all will acknowledge Jesus Christ, "every knee shall bow and every :
tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of the Father" (Phillippians ,
2:10,11). But why not acknowledge Jesus Christ now as Lord and Savior? Be j
included in His family, those who know Him as the faithful witness, the first
born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. . . . Him who loves ;
us and has freed us from our sins by His blood ..." (Revelation 14 -6)
