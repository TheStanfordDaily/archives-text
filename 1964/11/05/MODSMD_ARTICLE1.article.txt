• Clio a To Visit Moscow
MOSCOW Premier Chou En-lai of Red
China is coming to Moscow for a meeting of
world Communist leaders which could have
far-reaching cffects on the Soviet-Chinese
split
The Soviet news agency Tass said yester

the Bolshevik Revolution. Private talks on the
Peking-Moscow feud are likely.

• Demos Repeat '36 Landslide
WASHINGTON — The voters gave Presi
dent Johnson the biggest Democratic majority
in the House of Representatives since Frank
lin D. Roosevelt's 1936 landslide and kept the
2-to-l majority in the Senate.
This occurred despite some surprising
Democratic losses in the South in Tuesday's
elections in which political Big Names soared
or toppled in odd voting patterns elsewhere
across the nation.
Among them, Robert F. Kennedy, brother
of the slain president, elbowed himself into
the ranks of the potential political powers
with a decisive victory over Republican Sen.
Kenneth B. Keating in New York.
Robert Taft Jr., son of the late Sen. Rob
ert A. Taft who was known as "Mr. Republi

can," trailed Democratic Ben. Stephen M.
Young in the flicker-finish. race for Young's
Ohio Senate seat.
Taft had built up such an apparently safe
and decisive lead in early returns that politi
cians quickly spoke of him as a possible suc
cessor to his father as a GOP power. But the
lead disappeared under a barrage of late re
turns and the discovery of errors in the earlier
tabulations, and Young was'barely the winner
as t lie count stood.
Complete unofficial returns from Nevada
gave Democratic Sen. Howard W. Cannon a
margin of fewer than 300 votes over his Re
publican challenger, Paul Laxalt. The margin
was so skimpy it could be upset in the offi
cial canvas and, perhaps, by a recount if
Laxalt demands one.
• LB J To Reappraise Policy
WASHINGTON — President Johnson will
begin work almost immediately on a post
election foreign policy strategy pointing to
ward talks with Allied leaders in Europe and
a possible summit meeting with Soviet chiefs

later next year.
The global reappraisal, informed oi l Rials
say, is likely to put new emphasis 011 strength
ening ties with individual Allied governments
to get around the split in the Atlantic alliance
created by French President Charles de Gaulle.
But the most dramatic result could come
in Southeast Asia.
Some officials are now privately convinced
the President and his advisers may decide an
intensive new political-military effort is
needed to provide a basis for settlement of
the war in South Viet Nam.
There has been an increase in talk here
recently about expanding the conflict.
• Hurry It lasts Columnists
PHOENIX — Barry Goldwater said today
columnists and commentators who harshly
criticized him during the campaign, "should
hang their heads in shame because 1 think
they've made the whole Fourth Estate a rather
sad, sorry mess."
That drew a round of applause as he held
a concession news conference.
Goldwater said working reporters who have
covered him have been laii*, but he said col
umnists tried to hurt his race for the White
House.
Goldwater said they called him a coward,
uneducated, ungentlemanly, a bigot.

"I've never seen or heard in my life such
vitriolic unbased attacks on one man," Gold
water said.
• COP Battle Takes Shape
WASHINGTON — A conservative-vs.-lib
eral battle shaped up inside the Republican
party yesterday in the aftermath of the GOP's
crushing defeat.
Sen. Barry Goldwater, criticized by liberals
in his party, declared that his loss to President
Johnson does not mean that conservatism is
dead.
"I don't believe the conservative cause has
been hurt," he said in his concession of defeat
remarks. "Twenty-five million votes is a lo
of votes."
He said he has every intention of staying
around to help build the party into a winning
force with a philosophy he likes.
On the other hand, the Republican na
tional committeeman for Michigan, John Mar
tin, called for a housecleaning of the present
party leadership, starting with the ditching of
National Chairman Dean Burch.
Burch commented that the election proved
"a minority party cannot afford the luxury
of disunity. Now is the time to abandon all
the bickering and come together."

• COP Battle Takes Shape
WASHINGTON — A conservative-vs.-lib
eral battle shaped up inside the Republican
party yesterday in the aftermath of the GOP's
crushing defeat.
Sen. Barry Goldwater, criticized by liberals
in his party, declared that his loss to President
Johnson does not mean that conservatism is
dead.
"I don't believe the conservative cause has
been hurt," he said in his concession of defeat
remarks. "Twenty-five million votes is a lo
of votes."
He said he has every intention of staying
around to help build the party into a winning
force with a philosophy he likes.
On the other hand, the Republican na
tional committeeman for Michigan, John Mar
tin, called for a housecleaning of the present
party leadership, starting with the ditching of
National Chairman Dean Burch.
Burch commented that the election proved
"a minority party cannot afford the luxury
of disunity. Now is the time to abandon all
the bickering and come together."

MOSCOW Premier Chou En-lai of Red
China is coming to Moscow for a meeting of
world Communist leaders which could have
far-reaching cffects on the Soviet-Chinese

The Soviet news agency Tass said yester

here for the 47th anniversary on Saturday of

the Bolshevik Revolution. Private talks on the
Peking-Moscow feud are likely.
Poland's Wladyslaw Gomulka. Hungary's

• Demos Repeat '36 Landslide
WASHINGTON — The voters gave Presi
dent Johnson the biggest Democratic majority
in the House of Representatives since Frank
lin D. Roosevelt's 1936 landslide and kept the
2-to-l majority in the Senate.
This occurred despite some surprising
Democratic losses in the South in Tuesday's
elections in which political Big Names soared
or toppled in odd voting patterns elsewhere
across the nation.
Among them, Robert F. Kennedy, brother
of the slain president, elbowed himself into
the ranks of the potential political powers
with a decisive victory over Republican Sen.
Kenneth B. Keating in New York.
Robert Taft Jr., son of the late Sen. Rob
ert A. Taft who was known as "Mr. Republi

can," trailed Democratic Ben. Stephen M.
Young in the flicker-finish. race for Young's
Ohio Senate seat.
Taft had built up such an apparently safe
and decisive lead in early returns that politi
cians quickly spoke of him as a possible suc
cessor to his father as a GOP power. But the
lead disappeared under a barrage of late re
turns and the discovery of errors in the earlier
tabulations, and Young was'barely the winner
as t lie count stood.
Complete unofficial returns from Nevada
gave Democratic Sen. Howard W. Cannon a
margin of fewer than 300 votes over his Re
publican challenger, Paul Laxalt. The margin
was so skimpy it could be upset in the offi
cial canvas and, perhaps, by a recount if
Laxalt demands one.
