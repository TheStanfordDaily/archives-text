# SC Trojans, 4-3, Hard To Conquer
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The football year is half over
for Southern California's Trojans.
And their 4 win, 3 loss record
seems to uphold the contention
of ihe USC coaching staff that as
far as the Rose Bowl is concerned
"the season has dissolved."
But Trojan pleas fell on deaf
ears. With personnel like Mike
Garrett, Craig Fertig, Fred Hill
and Ron Heller, plus a bevy of
tough linemen how bad off can
USC really be?
GARRET is ranked eighth na
tionally in rushing. He is first in
the conference in scoring with 44
points. Quarterback Fertig is the
number five man in total offense
among major college performers,
and he is ninth in passing in the
nation.
The offensive line led by 225 lb.
tackles Bob Svihus and Chuck Ar
robio and Bill Fisk, a 220 lb.
guard, has at times ground the
opposition with such thorough
ness that even head coach John
McKay has been ecstatic.
AGAINST Colorado in the sea
son opener McKay turned Garrett
loose for three first half touch
downs and then played his young
reserves the rest of the way. As
expected the subs were nervous
in their first taste of varsity ac
tion but never was USC's 21-0
lead endangered.
The next Trojan opponent, Ok
lahoma, thought they had run
into a reincarnation of the "thun
dering herd" as USC trampled
the Sooners, 40-14. Troy ran up
3(51 yards against the, then, num
ber two team in the nation.
The Spartan life was definitely
not. to the Trojan liking the fol
lowing weekend though. Despite
the fact that they out gained their
opponent by over 100 yards Michi
gan State defeated USC, 17-7.
IT WAS Garrett again versus
Texas A&M. He gained 121 yards
and scored twice. Troy breezed
past the Aggies, 31-7.
Ohio State, playing its usual
"three yards and a cloud of dust"
game, crunched USC for a 17-0
win the next Saturday. The Buck
eyes did not give the Trojan off
ense a chance to get going as
Ohio St. controlled the ball on
89 plays out of 144.
In last week's victory over
Oregon, Stanford had the ball
78 times, while Oregon, thor
oughly held in check by the In
dian defensive crew, had the ball
on only 45 plays.
TH K US(' (AL game proved
that neither team has an impreg
nable defense. Cal chalked up 362
yards. But the Trojan offense,
mostly on Craig Fertig's passing,
amassed 490 yards on their way
to a 26-21 win.
Last Saturday USC was leading
Washington 13-0 in the first half
and then their defense rolled over
and gave Washington 14 points
in the second half.
But the Trojans realize as much
as anyone that NO ONP] has been
eliminated from the Rose Bowl
picture for sure. USC coach Mc-
Kay is playing possum this week.
Stanford hopes to help him play
possum Saturday afternoon also.

as anyone that NO ONP] has been
eliminated from the Rose Bowl
picture for sure. USC coach Mc-
Kay is playing possum this week.
Stanford hopes to help him play
possum Saturday afternoon also.
The football year is half over
for Southern California's Trojans.
And their 4 win, 3 loss record
seems to uphold the contention
of ihe USC coaching staff that as
far as the Rose Bowl is concerned
"the season has dissolved."
But Trojan pleas fell on deaf
ears. With personnel like Mike
Garrett, Craig Fertig, Fred Hill
and Ron Heller, plus a bevy of
tough linemen how bad off can
USC really be?
GARRET is ranked eighth na
tionally in rushing. He is first in
the conference in scoring with 44
points. Quarterback Fertig is the
number five man in total offense
among major college performers,
and he is ninth in passing in the
nation.
The offensive line led by 225 lb.
tackles Bob Svihus and Chuck Ar
robio and Bill Fisk, a 220 lb.
guard, has at times ground the
opposition with such thorough
ness that even head coach John
McKay has been ecstatic.
AGAINST Colorado in the sea
son opener McKay turned Garrett
loose for three first half touch
downs and then played his young
reserves the rest of the way. As
expected the subs were nervous
in their first taste of varsity ac
tion but never was USC's 21-0
lead endangered.
The next Trojan opponent, Ok
lahoma, thought they had run
into a reincarnation of the "thun
dering herd" as USC trampled
the Sooners, 40-14. Troy ran up
3(51 yards against the, then, num
ber two team in the nation.
The Spartan life was definitely
not. to the Trojan liking the fol
lowing weekend though. Despite
the fact that they out gained their
opponent by over 100 yards Michi
gan State defeated USC, 17-7.
IT WAS Garrett again versus
Texas A&M. He gained 121 yards
and scored twice. Troy breezed
past the Aggies, 31-7.
Ohio State, playing its usual
"three yards and a cloud of dust"
game, crunched USC for a 17-0
win the next Saturday. The Buck
eyes did not give the Trojan off
ense a chance to get going as
Ohio St. controlled the ball on
89 plays out of 144.
In last week's victory over
Oregon, Stanford had the ball
78 times, while Oregon, thor
oughly held in check by the In
dian defensive crew, had the ball
on only 45 plays.
TH K US(' (AL game proved
that neither team has an impreg
nable defense. Cal chalked up 362
yards. But the Trojan offense,
mostly on Craig Fertig's passing,
amassed 490 yards on their way
to a 26-21 win.
Last Saturday USC was leading
Washington 13-0 in the first half
and then their defense rolled over
and gave Washington 14 points
in the second half.
