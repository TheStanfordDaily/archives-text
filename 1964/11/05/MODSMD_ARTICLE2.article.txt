## We Ain't Copped No Cat Cannon 
### BRUCE BURTON 
If you see a strange assort
ment. of suspicious, frustrated
students roaming the eanipus,
don't be alarmed. They are
only ( aI students looking for
their copped cannon.
Saturday night, in probably
one of the biggest "rf's" of
Halloween, a group of Stanford
undergraduates stole the Uni
versity of California's cannon,
in keeping with traditions of
axe-stealing, banner - hanging
and newspaper-filling between
the two schools.
According to the group's
ringleader, the C'al cannon
weighs <>00 pounds, is painted
gold and is used to celebrate
occasional C'al touchdowns and
football rallies. Donated to the
university by the Class of
1904, it was supposedly hidden
among inpregnahle protection
devices.
Here is the leader's story:
"The cannon was hidden in
an underground storage tun
nel in the locked Cal stadium.
Saturday night, a group of us
called the SUKF's went up and
pulled it out, then brought it
back here and left it in a
locked car.
"Apparently, they found out
which car it was in and stole
it hack Monday night. With Hi
guys, two cars, one panel truck
and two locksmiths, they broke
into the car and took the can
non away.
"Unfortunately, our 'rivals'
overlooked two fittings for the
cannon. Without these fittings,
they can't use the cannon.
Then they (members of the
Cal football rally committee)
started pressuring us to return
the fittings.
"We said we would. On Wed
nesday we went back up to
Cal and left the fittings with
one of t he Rally Com members.
About I a.m. that morning we
stole the cannon again."
To get the cannon the sec
ond time, the now smaller
SURF group—numbering four
—bad to determine the weap
on's location. Mysterious con
tacts said it was in the new

student union, so the four
made their way through the
locked main doors of the union
and then upstairs and through
three more locked doors. The
SURF's then levitated the can
non back down the stairs and
off to the Stanford campus.
When queried concerning the
second theft of the cannon, a
spokesman for the unofficial
UCRF said said: "When Stan
ford stole the cannon the first
time, that was disaster. When
we got it back, that was jubil
ation; and when they stole it
the second time, that was dis
aster compounded feloniously."
At this point, several com
plicating factors entered the
matter of the vacillating own
ership of the artillery piece.
According to the SURF leader,
members of the Cal rally com
mittee had promised their stu
dent body they would have the
cannon back in time for a
Wednesday afternoon rally.
They never made it.
Another perplexing point
about tin* cannon confiscation,
at least to Cal authorities, was
how the Stanford group man
aged to enter the student
union through several locked
doors in order to reach the
weapon. Breaking and entering
can l>e a serious charge, and
the Stanford group was curious
about rumors that Cal officials
might press charges.
But.' to dispell such rumors,
the ringleader said "that to
reassure University of Cali
fornia authorities, the spon
sors of this R.F. would like to
emphasize that NO keys were
used to gain admittance to the
union building."
Furthermore, another prob
lem presented itself to the
Stanford group: how to keep
the cannon secure from ma
rauding Cal students in search
of their missing property.
"It was apparent that we
had a security leak the first
time," continued the ringlead
er, "so this time we made ar
rangements with a second
Stanford group. They'll never
steal it back this time."

Saturday night, in probably
one of the biggest "rf's" of
Halloween, a group of Stanford
undergraduates stole the Uni
versity of California's cannon,
in keeping with traditions of
axe-stealing, banner - hanging
and newspaper-filling between
the two schools.
According to the group's
ringleader, the C'al cannon
weighs <>00 pounds, is painted
gold and is used to celebrate
occasional C'al touchdowns and
football rallies. Donated to the
university by the Class of
1904, it was supposedly hidden
among inpregnahle protection
devices.
Here is the leader's story:
"The cannon was hidden in
an underground storage tun
nel in the locked Cal stadium.
Saturday night, a group of us
called the SUKF's went up and
pulled it out, then brought it
back here and left it in a
locked car.
"Apparently, they found out
which car it was in and stole
it hack Monday night. With Hi
guys, two cars, one panel truck
and two locksmiths, they broke
into the car and took the can
non away.
"Unfortunately, our 'rivals'
overlooked two fittings for the
cannon. Without these fittings,
they can't use the cannon.
Then they (members of the
Cal football rally committee)
started pressuring us to return
the fittings.
"We said we would. On Wed
nesday we went back up to
Cal and left the fittings with
one of t he Rally Com members.
About I a.m. that morning we
stole the cannon again."
To get the cannon the sec
ond time, the now smaller
SURF group—numbering four
—bad to determine the weap
on's location. Mysterious con
tacts said it was in the new

student union, so the four
made their way through the
locked main doors of the union
and then upstairs and through
three more locked doors. The
SURF's then levitated the can
non back down the stairs and
off to the Stanford campus.
When queried concerning the
second theft of the cannon, a
spokesman for the unofficial
UCRF said said: "When Stan
ford stole the cannon the first
time, that was disaster. When
we got it back, that was jubil
ation; and when they stole it
the second time, that was dis
aster compounded feloniously."
At this point, several com
plicating factors entered the
matter of the vacillating own
ership of the artillery piece.
According to the SURF leader,
members of the Cal rally com
mittee had promised their stu
dent body they would have the
cannon back in time for a
Wednesday afternoon rally.
They never made it.
Another perplexing point
about tin* cannon confiscation,
at least to Cal authorities, was
how the Stanford group man
aged to enter the student
union through several locked
doors in order to reach the
weapon. Breaking and entering
can l>e a serious charge, and
the Stanford group was curious
about rumors that Cal officials
might press charges.
But.' to dispell such rumors,
the ringleader said "that to
reassure University of Cali
fornia authorities, the spon
sors of this R.F. would like to
emphasize that NO keys were
used to gain admittance to the
union building."
Furthermore, another prob
lem presented itself to the
Stanford group: how to keep
the cannon secure from ma
rauding Cal students in search
of their missing property.
"It was apparent that we
had a security leak the first
time," continued the ringlead
er, "so this time we made ar
rangements with a second
Stanford group. They'll never
steal it back this time."
If you see a strange assort
ment. of suspicious, frustrated
students roaming the eanipus,
don't be alarmed. They are
only ( aI students looking for
their copped cannon.
