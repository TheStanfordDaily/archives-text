## A
						Case Not Reviewed 
### 
Dear Sir:
Women's Council has very
kindly lifted out of their annals
some very moving accounts con
cerning justice and the Stanford
Woman. Unfortunately the Daily
readers have been spared a cer
tain case which must now be con
sidered.
June, a sweet and spry co-ed
from a suburb in Chicago, was
regularly attending open house
at Max's fraternity. Roth June
and Max were known for study
ing together on the bed, since as
June later testified — "as we lay
there together with our books
open, we found we could develop
a greater sensitivity toward the
complexity of modern day exist
ence."
Unfortunately it wasn't until
the good R.A. came in at four in
the morning, somewhat bitter
about his own trials in modern '
flay existence, that he discovered i
Max and June communing in '
their natural thoughts. June was j
brought before Women's Council 1
with all due haste.
The noble members of Women's :
Council asked June what she did j
during the Open House, why did j
she study on the bed in close
proximity of Max, and was she
aware of her "deliberate disre
gard" of a fraternity man's pri- '
vacy after 2:30.
June was somewhat beside her- -
self as to how to answer these!
profound and deep-reaching ques-!
tions. She humbly confessed her |
enjoyment of intercourse and
hastened to point out that Max's
mattress was far more comfort-'

able than her own in Lagunita.
The Council members chastened
June to remember the implica
tions of her immoral and disre
spectful behavior. One member
warned June to consider Ihe ex
ample of the graduate students
and the problems they are facing
in Escondido village. "Because of
I heir indiscreteness the Univer
sity has been forced into a build
ing program which may not end
for another twenty years. Imagine
half of our sacred PACE funds
being devoted to dormitory space
that only leaves us another fifty
per cent for a new gymnasium,
the faculty cocktail club house,
and improvements on the bowling
alley."
The Women's Council deliber
ated in earnest with the help of
the good Deans and decided unani
mously that June must be charged
with "gross negligence," and a
penalty of five years of hard la
bor in the good Dean's garden. In
retrospect Ihe Men's Council also
concluded that there was some
thing gross about the entire af
fair and duly awarded Max with
the Annual Gross Award donated
at last by the Winds of Freedom
Committee.
It is not the rules per se that
are so completely bothersome (al
though the rules do have an ab
surdity all their own) but the
reality that the most intelligent !
girls in the nation not only sup- i
port these rules but condemn one i
another by these inhuman stand-1
ards. One would think that among ;
all the "aggressive" and Ayn
Rand personality types that exist
on campus there would be one
who would carry the cause for a

more intelligent justice in order
that a Stanford Woman could in
deed become a real woman.

Dear Sir:
Today at 4:15 p.m. Stanford
will be subjected to venomous
gush of bigotry and slander from
a cardboard version of Adolph
Hitler. There is absolutely no
justification whatsoever for al
lowing George Lincoln Rockwell
to speak on this campus in t he
first place, but now it is the re
sponsibility of Stanford to show
George Rcokwell that there is no
sympathy here for his views.
Everyone knows what the Fas
cist has to say and anyone w ho
shows up for his rally is merely
doing so for the thrill of hearing
a real, live Nazi speak. Rut in
lending Rockwell your ears you
are giving him just the kind of
support he expects.
If you can remove yourself
from your bourgeois apathy and
remember six million human be
ings who died as a result of those
very ideas that Rockwell is ex
pressing, do not lend him your
support by attending his version
of a Nuremberg rally.
If you feel that your intellec
i tual ego will be damaged by not
i being exposed to Rockwell's side
I of ihe issue and you decide you
| must go to hear him, please wear
a yellow armband with a Star of
David on it to indicate your rejec
tion of his ideas.
