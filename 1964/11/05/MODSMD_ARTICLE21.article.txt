## 'Exodus': 'Zionist Propaganda' 
### GHAEB A. HOURANI 
KIHTOK'S NOTK: 31 r. Huurani, a
native of Palestine is at Stanford
workin on a Ph.D. in edueation.

The Stanford community saw
last Sunday the naked face of
Zionist propaganda, presented in
the highly emotional film, "Exo
dus."
If the film did not contain a
good number of falsehoods, which
are an insult to the intelligence
of the audience, I would not
bother to make the following
comments. But the misrepresenta
tion in the film makes it a matter
of great importance to those of
us who know the facts—-and are
willing to document them to fur
nish the reader with an objective
account of the Palestine question.
In view of the limitation of
space, let us consider only those
issues in tho film that can be re
jected with a minimum knowl
edge of history.
<1) Anyone who read the his
tory of the British mandate over
Palestine would know that the
Jewish immigration to Palestine
was one of the major tasks that
was undertaken by His Majesty's
government. Hence, the Jewish
immigration from all parts of the
globe to Palestine was not in any
way harmed by the British gov
ernment, as shown in the film.

| <2) In one scene of the film,
at an afternoon tea at the home
I of the British high commander
! in Cyprus, a friend of the British
general — an American lady
I was arguing with him that the
I B a 1 112 o u r Declaration promised
|a national home for the Jews in
i Palestine. As far as the Arabs of
i Palestine are concerned the Bal
! four Declaration has no validity.
(3) The height of irony was
reached when we watched a Ger
man officer acting as a special
representative of the Mufti of
Palestine. We were asked to be
lieve, as the scene went on, that
the German Nazi officer was
hired by the Mufti (which has
been one of the outstanding
leaders in defending the
rights of the Arabs of Palestine
! in their homes and lands which
they inhabited thousands of years
ago), to murder all the Jews who
were in Palestine at the time.
I should like to make it clear,
i once and for all, that this naked
j lie in the film is nothing but one
I of many approaches being used
i by the Zionists to cover up for
! their crimes against the Arabs
| of Palestine in 1948.
If we were to consult the U.N.
; Security Council records since
that period until now, we would
j find the candid proof that, in al-
I most every instance reported by

| the U.N. officers the armed
forces of the so-called Israel were
condemned for starting the ag
gression.
(4) In regard to the Nazi crimes j
I towards the Jews in Germany, I
j should like to state it very clearly
j here, for the record, that the Arab
nation was one of the first i
|to condemn the Nazis for their
J wrong-doings. The Arab nations'
i attitude has been one of great
sympathy to the side of the Jews
with regard to the Nazi crimes i
against them.
i Having held this attitude, the,
I people of the Arab world were
j shocked to watch the Hajana and
; other Zionist forces commiting,'
in some instances, much worse |
crimes against the Arabs of Pales-1
I tine. Therefore, the alleged ex
• amples of Arab crimes against j
| the Jews seen in the film existed |
| only in the guilty conscience of
the Hajana and other Zionist or
ganizations.
In the final analysis, if the mil
lions of dollars that were spent
I to produce such an ill-made film
j were devoted to help ease the'
| misery of the Arab refugees of
Palestine — who are driven by
i force out of their homes — the
j interest of humanity would be bet
ter served. Let us all remember
that Arab refugees represent an
other "exodus."

The Stanford community saw
last Sunday the naked face of
Zionist propaganda, presented in
the highly emotional film, "Exo
dus."
If the film did not contain a
good number of falsehoods, which
are an insult to the intelligence
of the audience, I would not
bother to make the following
comments. But the misrepresenta
tion in the film makes it a matter
of great importance to those of
us who know the facts—-and are
willing to document them to fur
nish the reader with an objective
account of the Palestine question.
In view of the limitation of
space, let us consider only those
issues in tho film that can be re
jected with a minimum knowl
edge of history.
<1) Anyone who read the his
tory of the British mandate over
Palestine would know that the
Jewish immigration to Palestine
was one of the major tasks that
was undertaken by His Majesty's
government. Hence, the Jewish
immigration from all parts of the
globe to Palestine was not in any
way harmed by the British gov
ernment, as shown in the film.

| <2) In one scene of the film,
at an afternoon tea at the home
I of the British high commander
! in Cyprus, a friend of the British
general — an American lady
I was arguing with him that the
I B a 1 112 o u r Declaration promised
|a national home for the Jews in
i Palestine. As far as the Arabs of
i Palestine are concerned the Bal
! four Declaration has no validity.
(3) The height of irony was
reached when we watched a Ger
man officer acting as a special
representative of the Mufti of
Palestine. We were asked to be
lieve, as the scene went on, that
the German Nazi officer was
hired by the Mufti (which has
been one of the outstanding
leaders in defending the
rights of the Arabs of Palestine
! in their homes and lands which
they inhabited thousands of years
ago), to murder all the Jews who
were in Palestine at the time.
I should like to make it clear,
i once and for all, that this naked
j lie in the film is nothing but one
I of many approaches being used
i by the Zionists to cover up for
! their crimes against the Arabs
| of Palestine in 1948.
If we were to consult the U.N.
; Security Council records since
that period until now, we would
j find the candid proof that, in al-
I most every instance reported by

| the U.N. officers the armed
forces of the so-called Israel were
condemned for starting the ag
gression.
(4) In regard to the Nazi crimes j
I towards the Jews in Germany, I
j should like to state it very clearly
j here, for the record, that the Arab
nation was one of the first i
|to condemn the Nazis for their
J wrong-doings. The Arab nations'
i attitude has been one of great
sympathy to the side of the Jews
with regard to the Nazi crimes i
against them.
i Having held this attitude, the,
I people of the Arab world were
j shocked to watch the Hajana and
; other Zionist forces commiting,'
in some instances, much worse |
crimes against the Arabs of Pales-1
I tine. Therefore, the alleged ex
• amples of Arab crimes against j
| the Jews seen in the film existed |
| only in the guilty conscience of
the Hajana and other Zionist or
ganizations.
In the final analysis, if the mil
lions of dollars that were spent
I to produce such an ill-made film
j were devoted to help ease the'
| misery of the Arab refugees of
Palestine — who are driven by
i force out of their homes — the
