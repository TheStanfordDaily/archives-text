## Politicians, Not Computers, Analyze '64 Election Best 
### Steve Leopold 
So far, the two most revealing pronouncements on what hap
pened Tuesday have come from the politicians involved.
When asked by a reporter whether he thought Republicans
as well as Democrats had repudiated him in the election, Barry
Gold water, soon-to-be-unemployed Senator and itinerant launcher

of crusades, said simply, "Unfor
tunately 1 think you're right."
The night before, Rep. Hales
Boggs, a Louisiana Democrat and
Majority Whip in the House, told
pressmen, "Every vote Gold
water got in this state was a
racist vote, every one."
Both men exaggerated, of
course, but basically they were
correct, and it is for these two
reasons that Goldwater conserva
tism not just Goldwater has
such a short political life expec
tancy today.
Goldwater conservatism was
not merely rejected, it was en
gulfed. In state after state, Gold
water ran far behind the slale
ticket. Tragically, his very pres
ence on the ballot spelled defeat
for such men as Percy, Keating,
and perhaps Taft. Not so
tragically, his proteges in Texas,
Wyoming and New Mexico — the
heart <>112 "Goldwaterland" were
rejected also.
Class of '58
This was the year the Demo
cratic Class of '58 was supposed
to go down to defeat. Six years
ago, Democratic Senators—liberal
Democrats were swept into
office from such unlikely places
as North Dakota, Wyoming, Utah,
Indiana and Texas. Last night all
five of these men were returned.
Again, six years ago, with a
recession hurting the Republicans
in normally Republican states,
the Democrats upped their ma
jority in the House of Representa
tives to 270, the largest Demo
cratic majority since 1936. In the
past two elections they lost 1 I of
these seats, but today they made
a net gain of approximately 35
seats, giving them an incredible
majority of 295 or so.
Outside the South the liberal
Democrats added about 45 to
their ranks, while the 10 seats
the Republicans gained were all
in the South, half of them at
the expense of conservative Demo
crats. Thus, t he liberals in Con
gress have added about 40 to their
number.
Only in California, Nebraska,
Arizona and Deleware did men
of what one could call the Gold
water stripe win Senate seats.
And of these, only one was a
challenger George Murphy.
Murphy And '11*
Significantly, Murphy's victory
was abetted by the one trump in
the Goldwater strategy race.
Murphy ducked Proposition II;
Salinger, who has been called an
ace practitioner of political ex
pediency by his critics, did not.
In the South, Goldwater's luke

warm if not downright hostile \
attitude toward the Civil Rights |
Bill gave him his only state vie-!
Tories and turned some of these!
states into genuine two-party en- j
tities.
So much the better. Only fools |
and Goldwater Republicans (the)
two are not necessarily mutually :
exclusive) can see much future
to segregation in the South. |
Even in Mississippi and Alabama j
the death knoll must surely sound :
eventually for the "Southern!
Way of Life" as Negroes gain j
their voting rights.
Southern Democrats are the
most crucial element in the con
servative coa 1 i t ion presently
blocking progressive legislation
in the Congress. If they are out
flanked to Ihe right, then their
only course or their younger
proteges' only course is to move
left.
Conservatism in the Deep South
is prospering now due to an un
holy alliance between the new-rich j
who dominate the South's grow
ing cities and the rural racist vote.
It cannot last as the vote and the!
resulting economic demands it en-1
tails come to the Negro.
Northern Reaction
In the North, the new rich have j
become the old rich, and last j
night they showed exactly what j
they thought of the new leader i
of the Grand Old Party. In Roch
ester, New York, one of the;
wealthiest suburbs in the United
States. Lyndon Johnson did some
thing even FDR never did. He car
ried Rochester with over 60 per
cent of the vote.
Again, outside the South, the |
farmers of America are more im- j
pressed with where a politician
stands on price supports, rural
electrification and government
loans than civil rights. Goldwater
conservatism is anathema to most
of them; even in Nebraska and
Wyoming Ihe junior senator lost.
Barry Goldwater is not known
for accurate predictions, but in
our hearts we'll all admit that
his nomination was a revolution
in the Republican Party. Whether
that revolution will last is an
other question; after yesterday,
the chances seem to be slim and
none.
However, the prediction we •
think most appropriate for the
whole campaign this year was
uttered — most appropriately
by Rep. William Miller just be
fore the 1962 Congressional elee- 1
tion, "If we lose any more seats in j
the Congress this year, we'll have
to look under a rock to find a !
ticket in '61."
