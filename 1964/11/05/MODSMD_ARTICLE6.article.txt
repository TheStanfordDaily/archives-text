# CAMPUS OPINION
## No 'Mandate' For Johnson 
### BOB BJORING 
Stanford professors and stu-
I dent leaders failed to see a "man-
I date" in Lyndon Johnson's sweep-
I ing victory at the polls Tuesday,
I though their reactions to the
[meaning of the ballots differed
I greatly.
Professor Milorad Drachko
| vitch of the Hoover Institute did
j not think that Goldwater's defeat
! necessarily spelled the defeat of
i the conservative cause.
1.."1T IS VERY difficult to say
! that the conservative cause has
! received an insufferable blow by
the defeat of a man. Of course
: he was a spokesman for conversa
; tism, but he was not an ideal
! spokesman, and his defeat is not
| necessarily the defeat of his
ideals."
John Bonine, President of the
Stanford Area Young Republi
cans. was optimistic about the fu

lure of these ideals. "This is by
no means the first defeat \vc have
endured, but we have always bo
fore gone back to work with re
newed vigor until we finally
triumphed, and shall do so again.
"It is signifeant that two-fifths
; of the American people endorsed
jour cause this year. It is a great
i increase over the past, and it will
j be magnified in the future. The
(trend of conservatism is defin
j itelv on the upswing. 1966 will be
the next important chapter."
TIM INGRAM, President of the
i Young Democrats on campus,
j viewed the results differently.
| "Every President has called hi s
election a mandate, but of course
! a mandate is not really clear in
an election."
, "I would think that the correct
! thing to say is that the electorate
i was in favor of Johnson's policies
1 and were happy with his presi
| dency."
Ingram also commented on
I Salinger's defeat. "I think Cali-
I fornia has lost a good man." he
| said. "There was a lot of talk
I about issues in the campaign,
and Salinger came out on t he
j issues. His stand against 14 prob
i ably hurt him very much, especi
i ally in southern California."
PROPOSITION II was ac
cepted. according to Ingram, by
what Governor Brown ca lied
i "people voting their prejudice at
i the polls." Hod Pickus. a worker
lon the Stanford Students for Fair
j Housing disagreed with this.
"It was definitely not a case of
; misinformation. I think the voters
j knew what they were voting for.
j It is a very complicated matter,
: but the fear for property rights
probably played a large part in
! the vote."
Professor Richard Brody of the
Political Science Department
thought that the civil rights issue
was an "extremely important
i one" in Goldvvater's defeat. Of the
people interviewed, Brody was
the only man who seemed to think
j that the election was a clear man
date.
"I THINK that President .John
son has a better claim to a clear
! mandate than did Kennedy. The
vote seems to indicate* a pretty
thorough rejection of Goldwaler's
policies all across the country. It
I gives an added impetus for pro-
I grants like Medicare and the War
i on Poverty."
Professor Brody thought that
I questions as to whether Johnson
I had won or Goidwater had lost
were irrelevant. "In either case,

with a strong majority in the
Congress, he will be able to carry
out his program."
W. Glenn Campbell, Director of
the Hoover Institute, said that
the defeat of Barry Goldwater
was not at all a blow to the con
servative philosophy.
"1 DO NOT consider the elec
tion to be a repudiation of con
servatism. After all, Goldwater
received more than 25 million
votes. In 1956 Stevenson received
about the same number of votes
and a percentage of the popular
vote not much larger than Gold
water. I do not recall that my
friends characterized this as a
repudiation of the liberal cause.
"He was battling an incumbent
who had served during a period
of high prosperity and an incum
bent who did not hestiate to use
the high powers of the presidency
to advance his cause."
Campbell went on to describe
what he felt the meaning of the
election held for the conservatives.
"I am not discouraged by Gold
water's defeat. What this means
is that conservatives have to do
a better job of articulating their
philosophy.

Ingram also commented on
I Salinger's defeat. "I think Cali-
I fornia has lost a good man." he

I about issues in the campaign,
and Salinger came out on t he
j issues. His stand against 14 prob
i ably hurt him very much, especi

PROPOSITION II was ac
cepted. according to Ingram, by
what Governor Brown ca lied
i "people voting their prejudice at

lon the Stanford Students for Fair
j Housing disagreed with this.
"It was definitely not a case of

j knew what they were voting for.
j It is a very complicated matter,
: but the fear for property rights
probably played a large part in
! the vote."
Professor Richard Brody of the
Political Science Department
thought that the civil rights issue
was an "extremely important
i one" in Goldvvater's defeat. Of the
people interviewed, Brody was
the only man who seemed to think
j that the election was a clear man
date.
"I THINK that President .John
son has a better claim to a clear
! mandate than did Kennedy. The
vote seems to indicate* a pretty
thorough rejection of Goldwaler's
policies all across the country. It
I gives an added impetus for pro-
I grants like Medicare and the War
i on Poverty."
Professor Brody thought that
I questions as to whether Johnson
I had won or Goidwater had lost
were irrelevant. "In either case,

with a strong majority in the
Congress, he will be able to carry
out his program."
W. Glenn Campbell, Director of
the Hoover Institute, said that
the defeat of Barry Goldwater
was not at all a blow to the con
servative philosophy.
"1 DO NOT consider the elec
tion to be a repudiation of con
servatism. After all, Goldwater
received more than 25 million
votes. In 1956 Stevenson received
about the same number of votes
and a percentage of the popular
vote not much larger than Gold
water. I do not recall that my
friends characterized this as a
repudiation of the liberal cause.
"He was battling an incumbent
who had served during a period
of high prosperity and an incum
bent who did not hestiate to use

Campbell went on to describe

election held for the conservatives.
"I am not discouraged by Gold

triumphed, and shall do so again.
"It is signifeant that two-fifths
; of the American people endorsed
jour cause this year. It is a great
i increase over the past, and it will
j be magnified in the future. The
(trend of conservatism is defin
j itelv on the upswing. 1966 will be
the next important chapter."
TIM INGRAM, President of the
i Young Democrats on campus,
j viewed the results differently.
| "Every President has called hi s
election a mandate, but of course
! a mandate is not really clear in
an election."
, "I would think that the correct
! thing to say is that the electorate
i was in favor of Johnson's policies
1 and were happy with his presi
| dency."
Ingram also commented on
I Salinger's defeat. "I think Cali-
I fornia has lost a good man." he
| said. "There was a lot of talk
I about issues in the campaign,
and Salinger came out on t he
j issues. His stand against 14 prob
i ably hurt him very much, especi
i ally in southern California."
PROPOSITION II was ac
cepted. according to Ingram, by
what Governor Brown ca lied
i "people voting their prejudice at
i the polls." Hod Pickus. a worker
lon the Stanford Students for Fair
j Housing disagreed with this.
"It was definitely not a case of
; misinformation. I think the voters
j knew what they were voting for.
j It is a very complicated matter,
: but the fear for property rights
probably played a large part in
! the vote."
Professor Richard Brody of the
Political Science Department
thought that the civil rights issue
was an "extremely important
i one" in Goldvvater's defeat. Of the
people interviewed, Brody was
the only man who seemed to think
j that the election was a clear man
date.
"I THINK that President .John
son has a better claim to a clear
! mandate than did Kennedy. The
vote seems to indicate* a pretty
thorough rejection of Goldwaler's
policies all across the country. It
I gives an added impetus for pro-
I grants like Medicare and the War
i on Poverty."
Professor Brody thought that
I questions as to whether Johnson
I had won or Goidwater had lost
were irrelevant. "In either case,

with a strong majority in the
Congress, he will be able to carry
out his program."
W. Glenn Campbell, Director of
the Hoover Institute, said that
the defeat of Barry Goldwater
was not at all a blow to the con
servative philosophy.
"1 DO NOT consider the elec
tion to be a repudiation of con
servatism. After all, Goldwater
received more than 25 million
votes. In 1956 Stevenson received
about the same number of votes
and a percentage of the popular
vote not much larger than Gold
water. I do not recall that my
friends characterized this as a
repudiation of the liberal cause.
"He was battling an incumbent
who had served during a period
of high prosperity and an incum
bent who did not hestiate to use
the high powers of the presidency
to advance his cause."
Campbell went on to describe
what he felt the meaning of the
election held for the conservatives.
"I am not discouraged by Gold
water's defeat. What this means
is that conservatives have to do
a better job of articulating their
philosophy.
