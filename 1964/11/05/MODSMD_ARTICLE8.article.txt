# LASSU To Study Elections
## New Committee May Be Formed 
### 
Creation of a special commit
tee to study campus elections
will be the principal concern ol
the Legislature at 7:30 tonight
in Room 370.
According to LASSU Speaker
Ed Shaw the committee would
"study the entire procedures ol
all types of campus elections and
would make clarifications in the
elections by-laws."
"The Committee," explains
Shaw, "would consider such prob
lems as method of selection of
the head yell leader and the selec
tion of off-campus LASSU rep
resentatives."
ANOTHER problem whi c h
would be considered by the com
mittee is the tenure of LASSU
representatives. The ASSU Con
stitution provides for a full-year
term, but many living groups
hold elections at the beginning
of each quarter.
Shaw suggests that the man
ner in which Ihe head yell leader
is chosen may warrant study.
"It is a question," says Shaw, "of
whether a campus-wide elections
should be held each fall or
whether the head yell leader
should be appointed, perhaps
along with the pom pon girls."
OTHIiK committees lo which
appointments are slated tonight
include:
• Judicial Reform. This com
mittee held an organizational
meeting Tuesday night, and will
study "judicial procedures, judi
cial structure, and the relation
ship of the student judicial sys
tem to the University adminis
tration."
• Executive-Legislative Reor
ganization. This special commit
tee will study the duties of and
the relationship between the
executive and legislative branches
of student government.
• Housing and Religion. Bo th
committees will work alongside
Faculty Committees who are
studying problems in these areas.
• Development. Shaw hopes to
convert this special committee
into a fifth LASSU standing
committee which would concern
itself with the long-range goals
of the ASSU and its various or
ganizations.
