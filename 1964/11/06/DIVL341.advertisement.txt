by TIMOTHY LEARY, Ph.D.
and RICHARD ALPERT, Ph.D.
• formerly of Harvard University
• authors of "The Psychedelic Experience"
Sunday, Nov. 8, 1964 — 3:30 p.m.
"THE ECSTATIC EXPERIENCE"
1. The Scientific Situation. A review of those findings mid theories of astronomy,
genetics, physics, and neurology which define man's position in the evolutionary
process. Special attention will be given to the neurological and pharmacological situa
tion—that is, to the incredible potentiality of the brain and to drugs which affect
consciousness.
2. Religions Applications. Psychedelic worship defined and profusely illustrated;
the method, preparation, production and frequency of psychedelic worship noted; the
ecstatic-robot compromise defined; the theological and physical reasons for taking
psychedelic drugs on the seventh day reported.
3. Psychological Applications. A look taken of man's little mind and his big,
big brain. Why it is necessary to "go out of your mind" to "use your head." Two
types of learning—biochemical imprinting (sudden, ecstatic, non-conceptual, and
irreversible by any except chemical means) and associative-conditioning explored.
Sunday, Nov. 8, 1964 8:00 p.m.
"THE ECSTATIC COMMUNITY"
1. Social Applications. Man's recent, unnatural and disastrous digression into
uni-family life examined. The multi-family community explored. Reports on recent
experiments in communial living.
2. The Politics of the Nervous System. Ecstacy and stasis defined. Kcstacy and
leisure related. The meaning and social use of ecstasy indicated, hcstalogenic train
ing centers and psychedelic re-imprinting centers suggested, l'.-ychcdelic organiza
tions evaluated. The strategic program for consciousness expansion in the next decade
outlined.
