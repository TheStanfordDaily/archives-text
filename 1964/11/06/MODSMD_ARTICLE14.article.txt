# WORLD UNIVERSITY SERVICE
## Funds Will Help Abroad 
### 
In response to studenl needs in
underprivileged countries and re
gions, World University Service
(WUS) will open its annual all
campus fund raising drive next
week, November 9-13.
WUS, a voluntary association
of students and professors in
more than 50 countries, is "a link
between the thousands of miles
dividing the Stanford community
from the impoverished conditions
of students in all continents," ac
cording to Stephen Mick, Stanford
chairman.
WUS IS DIRECTLY concerned
with the support of students
through scholarship aid, self-help
work grants, clinical, library, and
classroom facilities, food services,
and work camp projects.
"Recognizing the need in so
many countries for education to
ward progress, WUS organizes
itself explicitly around student
aid in all manners of forms,"
Mick said.

A WUS SPOKESMAN said re
cently, "In both long-term and
emergency programs World Uni
versity Service has demonstrated
a consistent ability to act effec
tivly on behalf of its far-reaching

constituency. Moreover, this ac
tivity is often far in advance of
world opinion, pointing a way
and setting a pace for agencies
and governments eventually to
follow."
