## JAZZ TRACK Eccentric Monk At The Workshop 
### RICK BALE 
Thelonious Sphere Monk will be
•—somewhat erratically, as usual
—at the Jazz Workshop for the
coming two weekends. Some
what erratically, I say, as the
eccentricities of the great jazz
pianist have paralleled his highly
individualistic an d uncompro
mising style during his twenty
odd years in jazz.
I first saw Monk one late sum
mer evening a few years ago at
the Five Spot Cafe in Green
wich Village, where he is en
trenched most of the year. After
his sidemen had taken the stage
and warmed up, Monk slowly
wandered towards the platform,
glassy-eyed and emotionless, and
sat down to his pre-set contem
plation of the keyboard. It is at
this point that Monk has walked
out of many appearances, in
cluding his recent concert at the
Masonic.
MONK'S MANNER and ways
during performance seem as lost
to the real people around him
as his music is separate from
the forms and conventions of the
mainstream of modern jazz. It is
only after a while of listening
that one becomes aware of
Monk's total involvement with
the realities of the vibrant, pul
sating world as Monk sees it and
as Monk plays it.
Monk's style is difficult to re
late, as it tends to transcend the
well worn adjectives and cliches,
seemingly belonging to a lan
guage all its own. His angular
and eccentric melodies, which are
interpreted by a great many
musicians, have always been sec
ondary to his brilliant rhythmic
subtleties and peculiar tone which
have never and cannot be imi
tated.
A good part of the audience
was irritated by Monk's frequent
departures from the platform
during sets, and when he walked
across the room to absorb the
East Side street scene through
the plate glass window while his
sidemen held the drive for over
five minutes, many left in dis
gust.
BUT THE hard core jazz fans
and musicians who form the ma
jority of the Five Spot's patron
age just smiled and waited for
Monk to return, sacrificing them
selves to the eccentricities for
those moments of greatness, as a
public often will to a superior
and rare talent.
Just across the street from
the Workshop at the El Matador
is French pianist Martial Solal,
probably the most important
European jazzman since the late
Django Reinhardt. Solal is mak
ing his first appearance on the
west coast following his U.S.
debut at the Newport Jazz Festi
val earlier this year.
The Frenchman received his
jazz education as a teenager in
Algiers from G.I. broadcasts fol
lowing the American landings,
and his style shows the influence
of Bud Powell, Errol Garner,
and particularly Art Tatum. Ap
pearing with Solal are drummer
Jerry Granelli and ex-Trident
house bassist John Mosher.

OPENING Wednesday at Basin
Street West were Jon Hendricks
& Co, who made their debut at
the Monterey Jazz Festival in
September. You might recall Hen
dricks as one third of the famed
vocal trios of Lambert, Hen
dricks, and Ross, and the later
Lambert, Hendricks, and Bavan.
Now backed by Pat Harris and
Don Chastin, Hendricks has in
terspersed bossa nova tunes
among his famed vocal renditions
of classic blues and jazz numbers.
At Tin Pan Alley in Redwood
City is Duke Ellington, who will
close out his ten-day engagement
this weekend. Ellington, backed
by his veteran band including
Johnny Hodges, Paul Gonsalves,
Cut Anderson, and Sam Wood
yard, is breaking all records dur
ing his second visit to the Alley.
Count Basie is slated for Dec. 12.
OTHER DOINGS: Jean Hoff
man, a powerful pianist-singer,
goes into her second week of an
eight week stint at. the Trident in
Sausalito. In Oakland Vince
Guarldi and liola Sete are at the
Gold Nugget, and Brook Benton
is at the Showcase.
I was fortunate to catch the
Berkeley concert a few weeks ago
of Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto
(the "Girl from Ipanema"). The
concert, which was surprisingly
sparsely attended, was magnifi
cent, primarily due to Getz's ex
cellent form.
Getz's new group, together
since January, is a rare quartet
combination of saxophone, bass,
drums, and vibraphone. Getz and
bassist Gene Cherico, one time
biology major at Harvard, are
veterans, but the other half of
the group is of a different gener
ation. Twenty-six year old Joe
Hunt is on drums, and twenty-one
year old Gary Burton, who looks
fifteen, is featured on the vibes.
BURTON IS obviously an im
portant new talent, and his solo
rendition of ''My Funny Valen
tine" was impressive. His pian
istic style is reminiscent of Dave
Brubeck, but it is interesting to
note the great influence dynami
cally of Getz.
The performance of Astrud
Gilberto, who was featured on
four numbers, is particularly
difficult to evaluate. Although
her voice might resemble that of
your kid sister in Ihe shower, her
phrasing is marvelous, and tends
to carry her through most num
bers successfully. She fails, how
ever, on straight jazz ballads, and
should stay in the Brazilian vein.
Astrud and th e Getz group,
who are presently on a national
tour, will have a new album re
leased in the near future. In a
talk with Getz after the con
cert, he indicated that he would
very much enjoy playing Frost
Amphitheater, which sent your
cub jazz critic's organizational
mind a spinnin'. . . .

jority of the Five Spot's patron
age just smiled and waited for
Monk to return, sacrificing them
selves to the eccentricities for
those moments of greatness, as a
public often will to a superior
and rare talent.
Just across the street from
the Workshop at the El Matador
is French pianist Martial Solal,
probably the most important
European jazzman since the late
Django Reinhardt. Solal is mak
ing his first appearance on the
west coast following his U.S.
debut at the Newport Jazz Festi
val earlier this year.
The Frenchman received his
jazz education as a teenager in
Algiers from G.I. broadcasts fol
lowing the American landings,
and his style shows the influence
of Bud Powell, Errol Garner,
and particularly Art Tatum. Ap
pearing with Solal are drummer
Jerry Granelli and ex-Trident
house bassist John Mosher.

OPENING Wednesday at Basin
Street West were Jon Hendricks
& Co, who made their debut at
the Monterey Jazz Festival in
September. You might recall Hen
dricks as one third of the famed
vocal trios of Lambert, Hen
dricks, and Ross, and the later
Lambert, Hendricks, and Bavan.
Now backed by Pat Harris and
Don Chastin, Hendricks has in
terspersed bossa nova tunes
among his famed vocal renditions
of classic blues and jazz numbers.
At Tin Pan Alley in Redwood
City is Duke Ellington, who will
close out his ten-day engagement
this weekend. Ellington, backed
by his veteran band including
Johnny Hodges, Paul Gonsalves,
Cut Anderson, and Sam Wood
yard, is breaking all records dur
ing his second visit to the Alley.
Count Basie is slated for Dec. 12.
OTHER DOINGS: Jean Hoff
man, a powerful pianist-singer,
goes into her second week of an
eight week stint at. the Trident in
Sausalito. In Oakland Vince
Guarldi and liola Sete are at the
Gold Nugget, and Brook Benton
is at the Showcase.
I was fortunate to catch the
Berkeley concert a few weeks ago
of Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto
(the "Girl from Ipanema"). The
concert, which was surprisingly
sparsely attended, was magnifi
cent, primarily due to Getz's ex
cellent form.
Getz's new group, together
since January, is a rare quartet
combination of saxophone, bass,
drums, and vibraphone. Getz and
bassist Gene Cherico, one time
biology major at Harvard, are
veterans, but the other half of
the group is of a different gener
ation. Twenty-six year old Joe
Hunt is on drums, and twenty-one
year old Gary Burton, who looks
fifteen, is featured on the vibes.
BURTON IS obviously an im
portant new talent, and his solo
rendition of ''My Funny Valen
tine" was impressive. His pian
istic style is reminiscent of Dave
Brubeck, but it is interesting to
note the great influence dynami
cally of Getz.
The performance of Astrud
Gilberto, who was featured on
four numbers, is particularly
difficult to evaluate. Although
her voice might resemble that of
your kid sister in Ihe shower, her
phrasing is marvelous, and tends
to carry her through most num
bers successfully. She fails, how
ever, on straight jazz ballads, and
should stay in the Brazilian vein.
Astrud and th e Getz group,
who are presently on a national
tour, will have a new album re
leased in the near future. In a
talk with Getz after the con
cert, he indicated that he would
very much enjoy playing Frost
Amphitheater, which sent your
cub jazz critic's organizational
mind a spinnin'. . . .
For those of you that are as
yet unacquainted, my KZSU show
"Jazz Track," heard Thursdays
from seven to eight, is a spectrum
of jazz in the Bay Area, with fur
ther details of the engagements
and backgrounds of the various
performers and selections of their
recorded works.
Thelonious Sphere Monk will be
•—somewhat erratically, as usual
—at the Jazz Workshop for the
coming two weekends. Some
what erratically, I say, as the
eccentricities of the great jazz
pianist have paralleled his highly
individualistic an d uncompro
mising style during his twenty
odd years in jazz.
I first saw Monk one late sum
mer evening a few years ago at
the Five Spot Cafe in Green
wich Village, where he is en
trenched most of the year. After
his sidemen had taken the stage
and warmed up, Monk slowly
wandered towards the platform,
glassy-eyed and emotionless, and
sat down to his pre-set contem
plation of the keyboard. It is at
this point that Monk has walked
out of many appearances, in
cluding his recent concert at the
Masonic.
MONK'S MANNER and ways
during performance seem as lost
to the real people around him
as his music is separate from
the forms and conventions of the
mainstream of modern jazz. It is
only after a while of listening
that one becomes aware of
Monk's total involvement with
the realities of the vibrant, pul
sating world as Monk sees it and
as Monk plays it.
Monk's style is difficult to re
late, as it tends to transcend the
well worn adjectives and cliches,
seemingly belonging to a lan
guage all its own. His angular
and eccentric melodies, which are
interpreted by a great many
musicians, have always been sec
ondary to his brilliant rhythmic
subtleties and peculiar tone which
have never and cannot be imi
tated.
A good part of the audience
was irritated by Monk's frequent
departures from the platform
during sets, and when he walked
across the room to absorb the
East Side street scene through
the plate glass window while his
sidemen held the drive for over
five minutes, many left in dis
gust.
BUT THE hard core jazz fans
and musicians who form the ma

I was fortunate to catch the
Berkeley concert a few weeks ago
of Stan Getz and Astrud Gilberto
(the "Girl from Ipanema"). The
concert, which was surprisingly
sparsely attended, was magnifi
cent, primarily due to Getz's ex
cellent form.
Getz's new group, together
since January, is a rare quartet
combination of saxophone, bass,
drums, and vibraphone. Getz and
bassist Gene Cherico, one time
biology major at Harvard, are
veterans, but the other half of
the group is of a different gener
ation. Twenty-six year old Joe
Hunt is on drums, and twenty-one
year old Gary Burton, who looks
fifteen, is featured on the vibes.
BURTON IS obviously an im
portant new talent, and his solo
rendition of ''My Funny Valen
tine" was impressive. His pian
istic style is reminiscent of Dave
Brubeck, but it is interesting to
note the great influence dynami
cally of Getz.
The performance of Astrud
Gilberto, who was featured on
four numbers, is particularly
difficult to evaluate. Although
her voice might resemble that of
your kid sister in Ihe shower, her
phrasing is marvelous, and tends
to carry her through most num
bers successfully. She fails, how
ever, on straight jazz ballads, and
should stay in the Brazilian vein.
Astrud and th e Getz group,
who are presently on a national
tour, will have a new album re
leased in the near future. In a
talk with Getz after the con
cert, he indicated that he would
very much enjoy playing Frost
Amphitheater, which sent your
cub jazz critic's organizational
mind a spinnin'. . . .
For those of you that are as
yet unacquainted, my KZSU show
"Jazz Track," heard Thursdays

and backgrounds of the various
performers and selections of their

Thelonious Sphere Monk will be
•—somewhat erratically, as usual
—at the Jazz Workshop for the
coming two weekends. Some
what erratically, I say, as the
eccentricities of the great jazz
pianist have paralleled his highly
individualistic an d uncompro
mising style during his twenty
odd years in jazz.
I first saw Monk one late sum
mer evening a few years ago at
the Five Spot Cafe in Green
wich Village, where he is en
trenched most of the year. After
his sidemen had taken the stage
and warmed up, Monk slowly
wandered towards the platform,
glassy-eyed and emotionless, and
sat down to his pre-set contem
plation of the keyboard. It is at
this point that Monk has walked
out of many appearances, in
cluding his recent concert at the
Masonic.
MONK'S MANNER and ways
during performance seem as lost
to the real people around him
as his music is separate from
the forms and conventions of the
mainstream of modern jazz. It is
only after a while of listening
that one becomes aware of
Monk's total involvement with
the realities of the vibrant, pul
sating world as Monk sees it and
as Monk plays it.
Monk's style is difficult to re
late, as it tends to transcend the
well worn adjectives and cliches,
seemingly belonging to a lan
guage all its own. His angular
and eccentric melodies, which are
interpreted by a great many
musicians, have always been sec
ondary to his brilliant rhythmic
subtleties and peculiar tone which
have never and cannot be imi
tated.
A good part of the audience
was irritated by Monk's frequent
departures from the platform
during sets, and when he walked
across the room to absorb the
East Side street scene through
the plate glass window while his
sidemen held the drive for over
five minutes, many left in dis
gust.
BUT THE hard core jazz fans
and musicians who form the ma
jority of the Five Spot's patron
age just smiled and waited for
Monk to return, sacrificing them
selves to the eccentricities for
those moments of greatness, as a
public often will to a superior
and rare talent.
Just across the street from
the Workshop at the El Matador
is French pianist Martial Solal,
probably the most important
European jazzman since the late
Django Reinhardt. Solal is mak
ing his first appearance on the
west coast following his U.S.
debut at the Newport Jazz Festi
val earlier this year.
The Frenchman received his
jazz education as a teenager in
Algiers from G.I. broadcasts fol
lowing the American landings,
and his style shows the influence
of Bud Powell, Errol Garner,
and particularly Art Tatum. Ap
pearing with Solal are drummer
Jerry Granelli and ex-Trident
house bassist John Mosher.

OPENING Wednesday at Basin
Street West were Jon Hendricks
& Co, who made their debut at
the Monterey Jazz Festival in
September. You might recall Hen
dricks as one third of the famed
vocal trios of Lambert, Hen
dricks, and Ross, and the later
Lambert, Hendricks, and Bavan.
Now backed by Pat Harris and
Don Chastin, Hendricks has in
terspersed bossa nova tunes
among his famed vocal renditions
of classic blues and jazz numbers.
At Tin Pan Alley in Redwood
City is Duke Ellington, who will
close out his ten-day engagement
this weekend. Ellington, backed
by his veteran band including
Johnny Hodges, Paul Gonsalves,
Cut Anderson, and Sam Wood
yard, is breaking all records dur
ing his second visit to the Alley.
Count Basie is slated for Dec. 12.
OTHER DOINGS: Jean Hoff
man, a powerful pianist-singer,
goes into her second week of an
eight week stint at. the Trident in
Sausalito. In Oakland Vince
Guarldi and liola Sete are at the
Gold Nugget, and Brook Benton
