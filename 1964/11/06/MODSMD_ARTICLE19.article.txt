# Beatle Movie Has 'Something For Everyone'
## 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
There are three kinds of people
who by all means ought to stay
away from A Hard Day's Night:
people who abhor watching hy
sterical teen-age girls screaming,
people who get headaches from
listening to very loud Beatle mu
sic, and those who get headaches
from listening to Beatle music at
all. Otherwise, as they say about
the Walt Disney's, there's some
thing in it for everyone.
First, for those who would like
to see what the English country
side (and city-side) looks like, but
don't want to get involved with
one of those depressing sex stor
ies, lIDN offers the perfect solu
tion. Thanks to some sensitive and
candid camera work, the elder-
America glows, mellowed by age
and occasionally crumbling
through neglect, but always
peaceful.
FOR THOSE who like their
photography fancy, the super
visor of such things has perfected
a perpetual motion camera whose
effect totters on the brink of mal
de nrer. Not content with one tour
de force, he also carries off some
stop-and-go, speed - up - and - slow
down, and run-it-backwards se
quences that went out with slap
stick silents and should have been
back long before now.
Music lovers everywhere will
be happy to know that John, Paul,
George, and Ringo sing some new
numbers in addition to the old
favorites. The title song, often
lost amid the screams of you
know-who, is even quite good.
They will be somewhat less
pleased, however, to discover that
the compositions are performed
in a fine, unchanging forte
which tends to be not only deaf
ening but brainwashing.
However, the dialogue provides
much-needed moments of relative
quiet. And, by the way, the script
sounds suspiciously ad libbed, as
if someone had made a recording
of the Beatles' conversation and
then written it down. So the rea
son the dialogue sounds spon
taneous and refreshingly natural
is that it is.
THE PLOT, as one might ex
pect, exists not, being more or
less a series of irrelevant and
absurd encounters with various
strange people during a typical
day or so in the Beatles' life. It
is designed to display their shin
ing, if slightly idiotic, virtues, and
thus to set them apart from the
sordid, degenerate, but equally
idiotic world of "other people."
All this it does, and in addition
runs the gamut from amusing
to hysterically funny, mainly be
cause of the nonchalance with
which its heroes say and do some
of the most incredible things.
They are so fresh and well
scrubbed, their antics are so en
dearing, and their clothes are so
atrocious that no one can help en
joying himself enormously.
A Hard Day's Night is an ex
perience not to be missed, for all
kinds of reasons, but for one in
particular: this picture proves
that the Beatles are here to stay,
and so offers a golden opportunity
to jump on the bandwagon
quickly and jump right off again,
thus avoiding both the- rush and
crush that will inevitably accom
pany their next appearance.
