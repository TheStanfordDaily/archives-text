publication maintains a sales rate
better than twice that of its near
est contender. Time magazine.

sales rate than Playboy," Miss
Silva noted, "but it also has the
highest individual subscription
rate on the Stanford campus."
The best seller among the high
class monthlies is Atlantic, with
Harper's a very close second. The
highest priced journal. Fortune.,
at a dollar and fifty cents an
issue, invariably sells out all its
twenty-five copies every month.
Among the weekly news maga
zines. Time ranks first, selling
close to two hundred editions per
week. I'.S. News and Newsweek

paratively small following of
seventy-five issues at each print
ing.

given an important position in re
gard to tho literary appetite of
