If you've never felt the presence of God you can not realize what true holiness is.
Isaiah, the Old Testament prophet, had a life-changing encounter with the Lord
Jesus Christ; his description of the holiness of God and his own uncleancss is vivid
indeed: "In the year that King Uzziah died 1 saw the Lord sitting upon a throne,
high and lifted up. and His train filled the temple. Above Him stood the seraphin;
each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered hisfeet,
and with two he flew. Above one called to another and said, "Holy, Holy, Holy, is
the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is filled with His glory.' And the foundations of
the threshold shook at the voice of Him who called, and the house was filled with
smoke. And I said, 'woe is me! For I am lost, for I am a man of unclean lips; for
my eyes have seen tlu King. the. Lord of hosts!' Then flew one of the seraphin to
me, having in his hand a burning coal which he had taken with tongs front the altar.
And he touched my mouth, and said: 'Heboid, this has touched your lips, you guilt
is taken away, and your siti forgiven.' (Isaiah 6:1-7)
Isaiah knew the cleansing and forgiveness which God alone can bring, for He
knew the Lord Jesus Christ whose atoning sacrifice on the cross made possible the
bridging of the great gulf between a holy God and sinful man.
Mecattse God is a righteous and just God whose holiness is untouched and per
fect. the writer to the New Testament epistle Hebrews tells us, "It is a fearful
thing to fall into the hands of the living God." (Hebrews 10:31). Ihe fate of those
who reject Jesus Christ is described in vivid Biblical terms as a Lake of Fire where
the eternal torment of consuming tire is like a burning thirst which seeks a single
drop of water. (Luke 16:19-31. Revelation 20:11-15)
However, none of us need spend the endless ages of eternity banished front the
presence of a holy God. A way of salvation has been opened up by which all who
will, may enter and know salvation, forgiveness and total cleansing of all guilt
forever. Jesus Christ left this message for His followers to pass on to others, a
message which lie Himself will make real to all who call upon His name. He said,
"Write this, fot these words are trustworthy and true ... I am the Alpha and
tlu Omega, tin beginning and tin end. To the thirsty 1 will given without price
from tin fountain of the water of life, lie who conquers shall have this inheritance,
and I will be His God and He shall be my sou. Hut as for the cowardly, the faith
less. the polluted, as for murderers, fornicators, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars,
their lot shall be in the lake of lire that burns with lire and brimstone, which is the
second death." (Revelation -1:5-8)
lesus Christ. God Himself, is to be taken seriously, not treated lightly or con
descendingly trampled under foot. (Hebrews 9:J6-31). 11. is a God of love and
mercy ana forgiveness who today graciously extends to us a free otter to meet
llim. Hut (iod is a holy and just God who has said "My Spirit shall not always
strive v\itli 111.111" (Genesis (»:.•>>. Goti lias appointed a <lay of judgment and the
consequences of turning from Hint are terrible indeed; " . . . knowing therefore
the terror of tlu Lord, we persuade men . . ." (2 Corinthinians 5:10. 11), Rtcctve
Christ is \ our Lord and he saved. "... behold, now is the accepted time, behold,
now is tiie day of salvation." (2 Corinthinians 6:2)
