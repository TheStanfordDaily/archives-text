# 'Sea Gull' Overlong, Inconsistent Comedy
## 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
The Stanford Players have ad
vertised their latest offering, The
Sea Gull, as a Chekhov comedy.
By Chekhov it is, but Comedy it
is not. It is neither comic nor
tragic, satiric nor romantic; at
one time or another it is all of
these, of course; but consistently
it is mostly inconsistent.
Chekhov's setting is late 19th
century Russia; and he apparent
ly is worried about mens' pro
found dissatisfaction with their
lives. Unfortunately, however, in
his anxiety he dabbles in all the
possibilities of his situation with
out settling on one of them and
pursuing it.
SUCH A FLAW in unity would
not be so serious were it not for
an equally glaring defect in the
writing itself. Regardless of
whether the fault lies with the
translation or the Russian itself,
the lines are still almost unspeak
able. No amount of .covering-up
by the actors land .thejje is a lot
of it) can conceal the monumental
awkwardness, flatness, pompo
sity, and/or sticky sentimentality
of nearly every specrh. tit's like
trying to hide Hoover Tower by
draping it with a sheet: a noble
effort, but destined to faiL
This is not to say there are. n6
good Jines, in -the .play; .there are
a few here and there, but; they
are nearly lost in the interminable
crawl at which Sea Gull proceeds.
It is four acts —at least one top
long—with totally uncalled-for
ten-minute intermissions between
each act. The result is agonizingly
long and extremely frustrating.
Someone, namely the director,
certainly should have seen to it
that things moved at a little
faster clip. Gerald Hiken is ad
vertised as being fresh from
Broadway, which only proves that
Broadway directors are not .sure
fire guarantees of greatness.
HE CLEARLY was as muddled
as everyone alse about the focus
of Sea Gull, and really can't be
blamed for leaving it hazy. Al
though the unwieldiness of the
sets unfortunately demands ten
minutes between acts, he did not
have to lengthen the pauses be
tween lines and even words to a
tempo slower than a funeral
march, unless, of course, that is
why the Alta Mesa Cemetery is
listed in the acknowledgements.
On the brighter side, Holmes
Easley has again outdone himself.
Their clumsiness aside, his sets
do a magnificent job of dressing
up a bad play. Since they are

changed in full view of the au
dience, most of the wall units roll
away or reverse.
The rigid, tasteless Victorian
furniture (carted on and off with
great alacrity by stagehands)
captures admirably the dull, pro
vincial, and stuffy atmosphere of
late 19th century Russian country
life. Douglas Russell's costumes
are mixed: the women's are ex
cellent and in profusion; the
men's look as if they came
straight from the pawnshop
without even a stop at the clean
ers.
AS FOR the acting, the best of
the consistently professional per
formances are Ruth Hunt's, as
the actress, and Ellen Headley's,
as the country girl in love.
Madame Treplev, at whose
brother's home the action takes
place, is supposed to be a celeb
rated (if not talented) actress
with a weakness for equally
celebrated novelists. She is also
inclined to egoism and miserli
ness. Ruth Hunt's characteriza
tion is perhaps a little too flam
boyant, a little too stagey, but
otherwise her grand manner and
petulance are excellent.
Ellen Headley plays the love
lorn Masha well, in spite of
Chekhov's unyielding lines. She
uses a slightly mocking tone that
conveys what the words refuse
to do, and at the same time
makes her disillusionment with
life all too convincing.
STEPHEN NE W MAN, as
Madame Treplev's moody son. has
a fine voice but an annoying
habit of prefacing every sentence
with a wry grin and a little
chuckle. His bad lines very nearly
do him in. as they also do Wil
liam Sharp, who plays Madame
Treplev's current celebrated nov
elist.* Sharp's bluff geniality is
refreshing, but when it meets
Chekhov's pomposity head-on the
result is unfortunate.
Leon Katz as Dorn, the family
doctor, is quite good, but inclined
to woodenness when his lines are
more than usually bad. Among
the minor characters, Jack Fisher
as the steward is appropriately
obsequious and offensive; but
James Bierman plays the lovelorn
schoolmaster, frustrated by
Masha's indifference, with little
more than a stoop and a lisp.
Much more than that is demand
ed by the part, and his deficiency
is mirrored in both the directing
and the writing.
In short, The Sea Gull may be
"legitimate theater," but this pro
duction certainly doesn't show it.
It is recommended only for those
hardened masochists who will sit
through anything.

good Jines, in -the .play; .there are

It is four acts —at least one top

ten-minute intermissions between

long and extremely frustrating.

HE CLEARLY was as muddled
as everyone alse about the focus
of Sea Gull, and really can't be
blamed for leaving it hazy. Al
though the unwieldiness of the
sets unfortunately demands ten
minutes between acts, he did not
have to lengthen the pauses be
tween lines and even words to a
tempo slower than a funeral

why the Alta Mesa Cemetery is
listed in the acknowledgements.
On the brighter side, Holmes
Easley has again outdone himself.
Their clumsiness aside, his sets
do a magnificent job of dressing
up a bad play. Since they are

changed in full view of the au
dience, most of the wall units roll
away or reverse.
The rigid, tasteless Victorian
furniture (carted on and off with
great alacrity by stagehands)
captures admirably the dull, pro
vincial, and stuffy atmosphere of
late 19th century Russian country
life. Douglas Russell's costumes
are mixed: the women's are ex
cellent and in profusion; the
men's look as if they came
straight from the pawnshop
without even a stop at the clean
ers.
AS FOR the acting, the best of
the consistently professional per
formances are Ruth Hunt's, as
the actress, and Ellen Headley's,
as the country girl in love.
Madame Treplev, at whose
brother's home the action takes
place, is supposed to be a celeb
rated (if not talented) actress
with a weakness for equally
celebrated novelists. She is also
inclined to egoism and miserli
ness. Ruth Hunt's characteriza
tion is perhaps a little too flam
boyant, a little too stagey, but
otherwise her grand manner and
petulance are excellent.
Ellen Headley plays the love
lorn Masha well, in spite of
Chekhov's unyielding lines. She
uses a slightly mocking tone that
conveys what the words refuse
to do, and at the same time
makes her disillusionment with
life all too convincing.
STEPHEN NE W MAN, as
Madame Treplev's moody son. has
a fine voice but an annoying
habit of prefacing every sentence
with a wry grin and a little
chuckle. His bad lines very nearly
do him in. as they also do Wil
liam Sharp, who plays Madame
Treplev's current celebrated nov
elist.* Sharp's bluff geniality is
refreshing, but when it meets
Chekhov's pomposity head-on the
result is unfortunate.
Leon Katz as Dorn, the family
doctor, is quite good, but inclined
to woodenness when his lines are
more than usually bad. Among
the minor characters, Jack Fisher
as the steward is appropriately
obsequious and offensive; but
James Bierman plays the lovelorn
schoolmaster, frustrated by
Masha's indifference, with little
more than a stoop and a lisp.
Much more than that is demand
ed by the part, and his deficiency
is mirrored in both the directing
and the writing.
In short, The Sea Gull may be
"legitimate theater," but this pro
duction certainly doesn't show it.
It is recommended only for those
hardened masochists who will sit
through anything.

good Jines, in -the .play; .there are
a few here and there, but; they
are nearly lost in the interminable
crawl at which Sea Gull proceeds.
It is four acts —at least one top
long—with totally uncalled-for
ten-minute intermissions between
each act. The result is agonizingly
long and extremely frustrating.
Someone, namely the director,
certainly should have seen to it
that things moved at a little
faster clip. Gerald Hiken is ad
vertised as being fresh from
Broadway, which only proves that
Broadway directors are not .sure
fire guarantees of greatness.
HE CLEARLY was as muddled
as everyone alse about the focus
of Sea Gull, and really can't be
blamed for leaving it hazy. Al
though the unwieldiness of the
sets unfortunately demands ten
minutes between acts, he did not
have to lengthen the pauses be
tween lines and even words to a
tempo slower than a funeral
march, unless, of course, that is
why the Alta Mesa Cemetery is
listed in the acknowledgements.
On the brighter side, Holmes
Easley has again outdone himself.
Their clumsiness aside, his sets
do a magnificent job of dressing
up a bad play. Since they are

changed in full view of the au
dience, most of the wall units roll
away or reverse.
The rigid, tasteless Victorian
furniture (carted on and off with
great alacrity by stagehands)
captures admirably the dull, pro
vincial, and stuffy atmosphere of
late 19th century Russian country
life. Douglas Russell's costumes
are mixed: the women's are ex
cellent and in profusion; the
men's look as if they came
straight from the pawnshop
without even a stop at the clean
ers.
AS FOR the acting, the best of
the consistently professional per
formances are Ruth Hunt's, as
the actress, and Ellen Headley's,
as the country girl in love.
Madame Treplev, at whose
brother's home the action takes
place, is supposed to be a celeb
rated (if not talented) actress
with a weakness for equally
celebrated novelists. She is also
inclined to egoism and miserli
ness. Ruth Hunt's characteriza
tion is perhaps a little too flam
boyant, a little too stagey, but
otherwise her grand manner and
petulance are excellent.
Ellen Headley plays the love
lorn Masha well, in spite of
Chekhov's unyielding lines. She
uses a slightly mocking tone that
conveys what the words refuse
to do, and at the same time
makes her disillusionment with
life all too convincing.
STEPHEN NE W MAN, as
Madame Treplev's moody son. has
a fine voice but an annoying
habit of prefacing every sentence
with a wry grin and a little
chuckle. His bad lines very nearly
do him in. as they also do Wil
liam Sharp, who plays Madame
Treplev's current celebrated nov
elist.* Sharp's bluff geniality is
refreshing, but when it meets
Chekhov's pomposity head-on the
result is unfortunate.
Leon Katz as Dorn, the family
doctor, is quite good, but inclined
to woodenness when his lines are
more than usually bad. Among
the minor characters, Jack Fisher
as the steward is appropriately
obsequious and offensive; but
James Bierman plays the lovelorn
schoolmaster, frustrated by
Masha's indifference, with little
more than a stoop and a lisp.
Much more than that is demand
ed by the part, and his deficiency
is mirrored in both the directing
and the writing.
In short, The Sea Gull may be
"legitimate theater," but this pro
duction certainly doesn't show it.
It is recommended only for those
hardened masochists who will sit
through anything.


"THE SEA GULL"—Ruth Hunt and Robert Chase appear in a scene
from"The Sea Gull," the Chekhov comedy now playing in Little
Theatre.
The Stanford Players have ad
vertised their latest offering, The
Sea Gull, as a Chekhov comedy.
By Chekhov it is, but Comedy it
is not. It is neither comic nor
tragic, satiric nor romantic; at
one time or another it is all of
these, of course; but consistently
it is mostly inconsistent.
Chekhov's setting is late 19th
century Russia; and he apparent
ly is worried about mens' pro
found dissatisfaction with their
lives. Unfortunately, however, in
his anxiety he dabbles in all the
possibilities of his situation with
out settling on one of them and
pursuing it.
SUCH A FLAW in unity would
not be so serious were it not for
an equally glaring defect in the
writing itself. Regardless of
whether the fault lies with the
translation or the Russian itself,
the lines are still almost unspeak
able. No amount of .covering-up
