# The 						Inside Pitch
## Stanford Is Ahead Of Cal In Willing Rose Bowl Race 
### Pete King 
With just three games remaining, seven ol the eight AAWU
ban teams yes, even Stanford — have a mathematical chance
< 112 playing host team in the Rose Bowl. And with the speed with
wv.ch upsets have occurred so far this year, don't count anyone
out yet.
Here's the scrambled situation:
Team \V L To Play
Oregon St. 2 0 Stanford (away), Oregon (home)
UCLA 2 0 Washington (away), USC (home)
Oregon 1 1 Wash. St. (home), Ore. St. (away)
1 1 Stanford (away), UCLA (home)
Wash. St. 1 I Oregon (away), Wash, (home)
Washington 2 2 Cal ( home), UCLA (home), WSU (away)
Stanford 1 3 USC (home), Ore. St. (home), Cal (away)
0 2 Washington (away), Stanford (home)
Since every school except Stanford and Washington plays only
four games, it only takes two losses to eliminate them. Stanford
does have a very faint hope of winning the conference with a 4-3
record, but Khrushchev has a better chance of regaining his former
job.
IT'S ONLY SPECULATION
Just for speculation's sake, here's how the Indians could be in
Pasadena on Jan. 1: First, naturally, they must beat USC, Oregon
State, and Cal which hardly seems likely, but remember, this is
only speculation.
Next, Washington State must beat Oregon (on Oregon's field)
and tie Washington. Also, it would be nice if Cal could beat Wash
ington. Oregon defeat Oregon State, and LJCLA lose to Washington
and USC.
That is the only possible way for Stanford to go to the .Rose Bowl.
The od is are too high for even an IBM 490 computer to figure out.
.ever, aside from the three Stanford victories and Washington's
win over Oregon, the results are perfectly plausible. Visiting teams
would have to win, but last week all four visitors were victorious,
three of them upsets.
CARDS WOULD BK 4-3
Were fate to grant the Indians the above results, these would be
conference standings: WSU, 2-1-1; Stanford, 4-3; others, 2-2 or worse.
With a 1-5-1 record, Washington State wouldn't be a Rose Bowl
choice, while the Cards, at 6-4 would. On second thought, with all
teams sporting such mediocre records, Alabama and Notre
Dame might play in Pasadena.

Washington 2 2 Cal ( home), UCLA (home), WSU (away)
Stanford 1 3 USC (home), Ore. St. (home), Cal (away)

Since every school except Stanford and Washington plays only
four games, it only takes two losses to eliminate them. Stanford
does have a very faint hope of winning the conference with a 4-3
record, but Khrushchev has a better chance of regaining his former
job.
IT'S ONLY SPECULATION
Just for speculation's sake, here's how the Indians could be in
Pasadena on Jan. 1: First, naturally, they must beat USC, Oregon
State, and Cal which hardly seems likely, but remember, this is
only speculation.
Next, Washington State must beat Oregon (on Oregon's field)
and tie Washington. Also, it would be nice if Cal could beat Wash
ington. Oregon defeat Oregon State, and LJCLA lose to Washington
and USC.
That is the only possible way for Stanford to go to the .Rose Bowl.
The od is are too high for even an IBM 490 computer to figure out.
.ever, aside from the three Stanford victories and Washington's
win over Oregon, the results are perfectly plausible. Visiting teams
would have to win, but last week all four visitors were victorious,
three of them upsets.
CARDS WOULD BK 4-3
Were fate to grant the Indians the above results, these would be
conference standings: WSU, 2-1-1; Stanford, 4-3; others, 2-2 or worse.
With a 1-5-1 record, Washington State wouldn't be a Rose Bowl
choice, while the Cards, at 6-4 would. On second thought, with all
teams sporting such mediocre records, Alabama and Notre
Dame might play in Pasadena.
With just three games remaining, seven ol the eight AAWU
ban teams yes, even Stanford — have a mathematical chance
< 112 playing host team in the Rose Bowl. And with the speed with
wv.ch upsets have occurred so far this year, don't count anyone
out yet.
Here's the scrambled situation:
