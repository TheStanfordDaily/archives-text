# Cardinal Defense Eager
## USC-A 342 Yard Per Game Offense 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's defensive platoon ,
will gel one of its sternest tests
tomorrow afternoon. As Home- j
coming foe the Indians have
drawn the offensive minded Tro
jans of the University of South
ern California.
THE INDIANS are going into
this contest with high hopes of
evening their record at four wins j
and four losses.
Two weeks ago when the In
dians were being trampled by
Notre Dame, and USC was liter
illy passing by Cal the chances
for a Stanford victory were, in
deed. slim.
Offensively, Stanford seems to
have found themselves again as
they rolled up 374 yards on the
Oregon Ducks. Coach Ralston's i
crew did have the usual Stanford !
malady though.
IMPRESSIVE as the total yard- J
age was, the Indians only man
aged one touchdown and one ;
fieldgoal. Th ewe-get-nervous- j
within-the-twenty disease is one !
of th e main reasons Stanford
isn't 6-1, 5-2, or surely 4-3 as com- j
pared to the current 3-4 record, j
Presuming the Indians will !
shrug off ihe inability to capital- j
ize on scoring opportunities the :
Trojan defensive unit could be in
for a miserable day.
CARDINAL passers, last week, !
completed 18 out of 29 passes for
201 yards. Dick Berg, who is ex
pected to get the starting nod
this week, led the passers with
12 out of 21 completitions.
Troy's offense is no mean thing.
Even in losing 14-13 to Washing
ion USC ran up 346 yards. The
week before, with Craig Fertig
passing for 371 yards, they rang
up 490 total yards in beating Cal
26-21.
Ohio State held them to their j
lowest total, 170 yards. The only i
other time they weren't substan
tially over 300 yards was against
Michigan State. They gained 270
yards in that one.
THE HARD • WORKING de
fonsive "crew of the Indians could ,
be the third team to shackle the,
offensive machine of Troy.
The defensive line improved ;
greatly in the last game. They j
thoroughly handled Oregon's of
fense by putting tremendous pres
sure on passer Bob Berry. Ore
gon's touchdown was scored not j
on the defense but by an inter
cepted pass runback.
The front wall is made up of
Bob Howard, Gary Pettigrew.
Tom Ross, Bob Nichols, Glen n I
Myers, Jack Chappie, and sopho j
mores Mike Hibler and Al Wil- j
burn.
uses DEFENSE has been
only mediocre. Against Cal it
would have been more appropri- j
ale to have two sieves on th e i
field. And although they did not
allow Washington very many j
yards, they gave yardage up when
and where it counted.
