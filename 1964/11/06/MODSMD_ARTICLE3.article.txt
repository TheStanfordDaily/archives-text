• Amerivtm Embassy !o Leave Cambodia
PHNOM PENH. Cambodia Anti-American sentiment is run
ning full tilt in this Southeast Asian country. 1! appears onl\ a
a matter of time before the 33-man embassy staff will be forced
to leave.
In anticipation of a viulenl anti-American demonstration, the
embassy recently sent 31 dependent wives and children to Bangkok,
ThailanJ, as a precautionary measure. There is strong feeling that
one more serious incident along the border with South Viet Nam
would load Cambodia to break completely with the United States.
In a real sense, diplomatic: relations already are virtually non
existent. Cambodia has pulled out its ambassador to Washington
and there is no U.S. Ambassador here.

• Mariner .'i Spacecraft bails
CAPE KENNEDY The Mariner 3 spacecraft was rocketed
yesterday toward Mars, but a combination of problems apparently
ruined the United States' first effort to probe the red planet.
A twin spacecraft, Mariner I, was being readied for a second
try later in the month.
The Mariner project manager, Jack N. James, said 3 1 - hours
after launching that the situation did not look good.
Tracking data was fuzzy, but it indicated that the second stage
of ihe Atlas-Agena D booster rocket shut down four seconds pre
maturely when it reignited its engine a second time to shove Mariner
3 into space. The restart of a modified model of the Agena D was
receiving its first trial in space and apparently flunked.
