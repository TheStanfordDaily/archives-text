## A
						Failure For Conservatism 
### DAVID COMMONS 
It may ho back to the store in sixty-four" lor
Barry Gold water, hut many of his supporters
have already started to explain away their recent
failure and to pave the way for another attempt
in I'.HIX.
Typical of these apologies is Mr. Nayior's
Wednesday morning editorial in the Pally. He
argues that because the election was not really
decided upon the "issues," the conservatives should
maintain their hold on the Republican party and
should try again in 1968. He seems convinced that,
presented with an even clearer choice than in 1964,
the American voter will openly embrace the con
servative philosophy.
Not A Philosophy
Such an attitude reflects the basic nature of
American conservatism, which, not really a "phil
osophy" at all, is rather an emotional reaction
against the complex issues of the modern world
and a sentimental attachment to the intrinsic
"rightness" of political naivete. This is tlie kind
of conservatism which can still call for a return
to the economic system of the 1890's and a for
eign policy of the 1900's. This is the kind of con
servatism whose exponents can claim in a letter
to the Daily that more freshmen are conservative
because they have yet to bo "corrupted" by educa
tion. This is the kind of conservatism typified by
Goldwater's election eve pronouncement: "I wish
fifteen-year-olds could vote."
Quixotic And Vicious
This Goldwaier brand of conservatism is ac
companied by an emotional conviction of its own
tightness that makes it appear alternately oui\
otic and vicious: quixotic when, in the heartland
of t he TV A. Goklwater would steadfastly refuse
to be silent about his feelings that TV A should
be terminated; vieiou••• when, in the name of moral
ity and integrity, the conservatives could come
up with an approach as immoral and unethical
as that typified by the Mothers for a Moral Amer
ion.
These conservatives are convinced, as most
people arc, that the ideals in which they believe
are right. Cut so enamored are ihey with their
goals, that they do not seem 'o care how they
achieve them. In such a situation anything trim
virulent, twisted paperbacks attacking the Presi
dent. to open espousal of pro-American propa
ganda in the schools becomes acceptable ammu
nition in the war for American conservatism.

Fortunately, the overwhelming minority of the
American people, as demonstrated on Tuosdav.

do not accept this brand of conservatism. Mr.
Naylor commits a serious error in ignoring this
fact. He argues that this particular election is not
a true test of conservatism because Barry Gold
water the man almost universally acknowledged
up until 1964 by conservatives as "Mr. Conserva
tive'' somehow went astray.
But it would seem that this tendency to go
astray is inherent in the approach of most of those
who supported Barry Goldwater in San Fran
cisco. Because of the basic unreality of conserva
tism's goals, and the highly emotional, frequently
naive attachment which it engenders in its follow
ers, those campaigning for its adoption often em
ploy methods which are separated from political
reality— and the results are sometimes comic,
sometimes pathetic, and sometimes extremely
dangerous.
Destruct ion of GOP
In such a form conservatism cannot be made
politically viable. To argue that the proponents
of such a doctrine should be allowed to continue
to control one of the two major political parties
is to advocate the destruction of that pary and all
the consequences thereof.
For many years American conservatives ar
gued: "Give us one chance and we will show you
that conservatism can win." They were given
that chance and they ended in unqualified failure.
Now Mr. Naylor and others are trying to excuse
conservatism's failure as the failure of only one
man. This is not the case.
K.OITOK'S NOTK: We did not contend that Sena
tor Goldwater "somehow went astray," but only
that he was a relatively poor presidential candi
date. He was saddled I'rem Pie he "*lnn?ng by fin
politic statements he had made long before the
nomimt'.on, and he was on the defensive during
the entire campaign, not about the issues, but
about his own "impulsiveness" and about "the
peop?e aromul him."
"fa such a form," we agree c nipletelv. "err:!
servatism cannot he made politically viable." But
defeat or a conservative candidate about whom
opinions had hardened long before he was nomi
nated is not necessarily a repudiation of his ideas,
and does not mean that conservatism can never be
male politically viable.
As for the future, the task of conservatives is
to find an p.rtieulate candidate who is a politician
(as Senator Goldwater was not), and who can
appeal to the mass of American voters with a
carefully formulated conservative program — a
program which need by no means be inherently
"naive" or "unrealistic."
