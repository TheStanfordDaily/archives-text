# Johnson Unfit For Presidency
## 
### PAUL CORLEY 
L y n d on Johnson's sweeping
"mandate" is a tragedy for Amer
ica, because he is morally unfit
to he our President.
How did Johnson win such a
smashing vi c to r y ? Partially
through the power, prestige and
publicity accruing to the Presi
dency especially after the assa
sination and reluctance to
change m i (is t rea m . Partially
through the vitriolic attacks of
the "liberal" Republicans on
Goldwater, their lack of support,
and Goldwater's difficulty, self
induced and otherwise to gel his
message across. But just as sig
nificantly, through Johnson's in
stigation of a scare campaign
that his opponent would get us
into war, is irresponsible, would
overturn practically every good
institution going, and deprive de
pendent people of their due. in
short, that liis opponent would
undermine everyone's security.
Nowhere did he dehaV and d?s
pufe his opponent's charges no

where did he offer evidence for
charges he made, but rather in
nuendos and sly references.
In view of his background
Johnson's conduct is not surpris
ing. He is a hypocrite, having run
in 1.960 on contradictory state and
national platforms, having radic
ally reversed himself on civil
rights, having neglected his wife's
tenant farmers in Alabama while
conducting a "war on poverty."
His Austin TV monopoly denotes
spurious relationships with the
Federal Government, as does his
1918 "landslide" in Jim Wells
County. Billie Sol Estes a n d
Bobby Baker remain disquieting
symbols. But one need only to
listen to the man speak, to con
sider his phrases to become un
easy.
The question of morality in
Government is no joke, nothing
for the "sophisticated" and (he
cynical to laugh about. A nation
and civilization cannot endure
without a well-conceived hiorar
': n ' of va'ues. without consistent

devol ion to principles, without
those who strive for the loftiest,
without men of high integrity, as
leaders. But Lyndon Johnson is
not such a man.
Let us therefore not forget
those principles and ideals which
have made our political institu
tions a landmark in Western civ
ilization. Let us each consider and
endeavor that only men of high
est integrity and selfless dedica
tion are chosen to guide these in
stitutions and set examples. And
in the face of polemical charges
of "extremism" and "divisiveness"
let us not by false solicitations
for "unity" be misled from just
criticism and demands for truth.
The pre-election issues have not
automatically disappeared. Their
dispute must be pressed forward.
Americans should be concerned
and indignant that such a man as
Lyndon Johnson has found his
way to the Presidency. Instead
hey are for tho most part com
plaisant and content. This is tlr~
trarredv of his e'ection.

in the face of polemical charges
of "extremism" and "divisiveness"
let us not by false solicitations
for "unity" be misled from just
criticism and demands for truth.
The pre-election issues have not
automatically disappeared. Their

Americans should be concerned
and indignant that such a man as
Lyndon Johnson has found his
way to the Presidency. Instead
hey are for tho most part com
plaisant and content. This is tlr~
trarredv of his e'ection.
L y n d on Johnson's sweeping
"mandate" is a tragedy for Amer
ica, because he is morally unfit
to he our President.
How did Johnson win such a
smashing vi c to r y ? Partially
through the power, prestige and
publicity accruing to the Presi
dency especially after the assa
sination and reluctance to
change m i (is t rea m . Partially
through the vitriolic attacks of
the "liberal" Republicans on
Goldwater, their lack of support,
and Goldwater's difficulty, self
induced and otherwise to gel his
message across. But just as sig
nificantly, through Johnson's in
stigation of a scare campaign
that his opponent would get us
into war, is irresponsible, would
overturn practically every good
institution going, and deprive de
pendent people of their due. in
short, that liis opponent would
undermine everyone's security.
Nowhere did he dehaV and d?s
pufe his opponent's charges no

where did he offer evidence for
charges he made, but rather in
nuendos and sly references.
In view of his background
Johnson's conduct is not surpris
ing. He is a hypocrite, having run
in 1.960 on contradictory state and
national platforms, having radic
ally reversed himself on civil
rights, having neglected his wife's
tenant farmers in Alabama while
conducting a "war on poverty."
His Austin TV monopoly denotes
spurious relationships with the
Federal Government, as does his
1918 "landslide" in Jim Wells
County. Billie Sol Estes a n d
Bobby Baker remain disquieting
symbols. But one need only to
listen to the man speak, to con
sider his phrases to become un
easy.
The question of morality in
Government is no joke, nothing
for the "sophisticated" and (he
cynical to laugh about. A nation
and civilization cannot endure
without a well-conceived hiorar
': n ' of va'ues. without consistent

devol ion to principles, without
those who strive for the loftiest,
without men of high integrity, as
leaders. But Lyndon Johnson is
not such a man.
Let us therefore not forget
those principles and ideals which
have made our political institu
tions a landmark in Western civ
ilization. Let us each consider and
endeavor that only men of high
est integrity and selfless dedica
tion are chosen to guide these in
stitutions and set examples. And
in the face of polemical charges
of "extremism" and "divisiveness"
