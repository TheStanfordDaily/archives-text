# Editor, The Daily
## 'Exodus' Critic 'A Victim Of Gross Misinformation 
### 
I Dear Sir:
I do not want to engage in any
discussion of the merits of the
film Exodus, or of the Palestine
Problem per se, however I do
feel that Mr. Hourani has been
the victim of gross misinforma
tion. As one who has only a "mini
mum knowledge of history" I
j wish to enlarge on his statements.
(1) According to Mr. Hourani,
I the British Government did not
I interfere with Jewish immigra
| tion into Palestine. This may have
I heen true until 1938, at which
j time the British government
launched on a policy of appease
i merit, both towards the Nazis
, and ihe Arabs. Jewish imrnigra
; tion was virtually halted by the
| 1939 White Paper on Palestine,
although the events taking place
in Europe were becoming general
I'lnwledge. Despite the promises
of the Labour (Jo ve r n m ent
elected after the war, the sur
vivors of Hitler's concentration
camps were not allowed to immi
grate to Palestine, but were
hunted on the high seas, and sent
to camps on the island of Cyprus.
! fir in the ense of the ill fated im
migranl ship Exodus, were re
turned to "amburg, Germany.
(2> Mr. Hourani states that the
| r.-i-'rw Declaration has no va
lidity. This document was drawn
up by Lord Balfour, a member of
j His Majesty's Govt, in 1917 and
: was used as a basis by Ihe League
; of Nations in setting up the Brit
ish Mandate over Palestine.
(3) The Mufti of Jerusalem,
leader of the Palestine Arabs,
spent considerable time in Ger
many during World War 11. Film
strips are available (seen on chan
nel 9 on Monday) showing th e
Mufti and Hitler inspecting Ger
man troops. This alone bespeaks
of the Arab position towards the
Jews during the war, and of
their sympathies.
(4) I must remind Mr. Hourani
that i1 was the Arab States who
invaded Palestine in May 1948 in
order to prevent the implementa
tion of the U.N. decision on the
establishment of Israel, and that
it was the Arab Fedayeen based
in Sinai, who terrorized Jewish
villagers by hurling grenades
into children's houses and wed- j
ding celebrations, and thus pro-1
voked the Sinai Campaign. I do
not have lo depend on Zionist :
propaganda for these facts, since!
I was an eye-witness to this ter
ror.
In only one item can I agree j
with Mr. Hourani. The Arab I
refugee problem was created as
a result of the formation of Is
•iel. and tint these people must
be helped. Since Israel has ac
cepted hundreds of th uisands o'

Jewish refugees fro m Iraq,
Egypt, Morocco, etc., why can
not the Arab States settle these
refugees into their economy or
discuss the problem with Israel,
rather than holding them in
j camps, as a political pawn in a
| game that can only lead to more
suffering for Jew and Arab alike?

Dear Sir:
I know you will be as shocked
las I to learn that the Southern
| California newspapers tod a y
(October 27) are carrying an AP
story claiming that your paper
has endorsed Goldwaler for Presi
dent.
While it is appreciated that the
planting of this story is un
doubtedly a moronic practical
joke of some Berkeley student or
alumnus, unquestionably many
of the? newspaper readers here
are apt to take the story seri
ously.
It is suggested, therefore, in the
interest of maintaining the im
age of Stanford University as an
oasis of sanity, that you immedi
ately issue a denial of this vile
canard.
GEORGE E. SHIBLEY,
Fisi'.lifully yours.

Dear Sir:
Though I would not consider
quarreling with his right 1o make
the statements he did, I do find
fault with you in allowing a let
ter to be written by the 'Main
streamer" (Thursday, October 29,
1964) without publishing his
name. Any WASP, as he calls
himself, that is proud of the name
should be man enough and have
"guts" enough to allow his name
to be published. I guess he is just
gutless, and you, sir, are a dis
grace to our University for allow
ing it to be published in this man
ner.
Very truly yours.

that i1 was the Arab States who

with Mr. Hourani. The Arab I
refugee problem was created as

Jewish refugees fro m Iraq,
Egypt, Morocco, etc., why can
not the Arab States settle these
refugees into their economy or
discuss the problem with Israel,
rather than holding them in
j camps, as a political pawn in a

suffering for Jew and Arab alike?

Dear Sir:
I know you will be as shocked
las I to learn that the Southern
| California newspapers tod a y
(October 27) are carrying an AP
story claiming that your paper
has endorsed Goldwaler for Presi
dent.
While it is appreciated that the
planting of this story is un
doubtedly a moronic practical
joke of some Berkeley student or
alumnus, unquestionably many
of the? newspaper readers here
are apt to take the story seri
ously.
It is suggested, therefore, in the
interest of maintaining the im
age of Stanford University as an
oasis of sanity, that you immedi
ately issue a denial of this vile
canard.

(4) I must remind Mr. Hourani
that i1 was the Arab States who
invaded Palestine in May 1948 in
order to prevent the implementa
tion of the U.N. decision on the
establishment of Israel, and that
it was the Arab Fedayeen based
in Sinai, who terrorized Jewish
villagers by hurling grenades
into children's houses and wed- j
ding celebrations, and thus pro-1
voked the Sinai Campaign. I do
not have lo depend on Zionist :
propaganda for these facts, since!
I was an eye-witness to this ter
ror.
In only one item can I agree j
with Mr. Hourani. The Arab I
refugee problem was created as
a result of the formation of Is
•iel. and tint these people must
be helped. Since Israel has ac
cepted hundreds of th uisands o'

Jewish refugees fro m Iraq,
Egypt, Morocco, etc., why can
not the Arab States settle these
refugees into their economy or
discuss the problem with Israel,
rather than holding them in
j camps, as a political pawn in a
| game that can only lead to more
suffering for Jew and Arab alike?

Dear Sir:
I know you will be as shocked
las I to learn that the Southern
| California newspapers tod a y
(October 27) are carrying an AP
story claiming that your paper
has endorsed Goldwaler for Presi
dent.
While it is appreciated that the
planting of this story is un
doubtedly a moronic practical
joke of some Berkeley student or
alumnus, unquestionably many
of the? newspaper readers here
are apt to take the story seri
ously.
It is suggested, therefore, in the
interest of maintaining the im
age of Stanford University as an
oasis of sanity, that you immedi
ately issue a denial of this vile
canard.
GEORGE E. SHIBLEY,
Fisi'.lifully yours.

Dear Sir:
Though I would not consider
quarreling with his right 1o make
the statements he did, I do find
fault with you in allowing a let
ter to be written by the 'Main
streamer" (Thursday, October 29,
1964) without publishing his
name. Any WASP, as he calls
himself, that is proud of the name
should be man enough and have
"guts" enough to allow his name
to be published. I guess he is just
gutless, and you, sir, are a dis
grace to our University for allow
ing it to be published in this man
ner.
Very truly yours.

Lippinaiin Held Over
Walter Lippmann has been
held over in order that we can
print his analysis of the election,
which, unfortunately, we have
not yet received.
I Dear Sir:
I do not want to engage in any
discussion of the merits of the
film Exodus, or of the Palestine
Problem per se, however I do
feel that Mr. Hourani has been
the victim of gross misinforma
tion. As one who has only a "mini
mum knowledge of history" I
j wish to enlarge on his statements.
(1) According to Mr. Hourani,
I the British Government did not
I interfere with Jewish immigra
| tion into Palestine. This may have
I heen true until 1938, at which
j time the British government
launched on a policy of appease
i merit, both towards the Nazis
, and ihe Arabs. Jewish imrnigra
; tion was virtually halted by the
| 1939 White Paper on Palestine,
although the events taking place
in Europe were becoming general
I'lnwledge. Despite the promises
of the Labour (Jo ve r n m ent
elected after the war, the sur
vivors of Hitler's concentration
camps were not allowed to immi
grate to Palestine, but were
hunted on the high seas, and sent
to camps on the island of Cyprus.
! fir in the ense of the ill fated im
migranl ship Exodus, were re
turned to "amburg, Germany.
(2> Mr. Hourani states that the
| r.-i-'rw Declaration has no va
lidity. This document was drawn
up by Lord Balfour, a member of
j His Majesty's Govt, in 1917 and
: was used as a basis by Ihe League
; of Nations in setting up the Brit
ish Mandate over Palestine.
(3) The Mufti of Jerusalem,
leader of the Palestine Arabs,
spent considerable time in Ger
many during World War 11. Film
strips are available (seen on chan
nel 9 on Monday) showing th e
Mufti and Hitler inspecting Ger
man troops. This alone bespeaks
of the Arab position towards the
Jews during the war, and of
their sympathies.

tion of the U.N. decision on the
