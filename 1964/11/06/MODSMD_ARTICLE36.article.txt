### DOUGLASS MORRIS 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Tills is (lie first in a serje,, ot five articles to
ppear during' the next two weeks concerning Atlantic Union, tin*
roposed federation of the world's stable tree nations. Future articles
"his series will deal more specifically with sonu* of the points in
this article.

"Now when man's future seems so vast, catastrophe threatens
to cut iis from it.
These opening words of Clarence Streit's Union Nou\ originally
written in the time of Hitler and the Depression, are more valid
than ever in this time of Communist imperialism, unbalanced inter-

national payments, and thermo
nuclear war.
Fortunately Streit's proposals
for permanently ending the
threats of dictatorship, depression,
i and war has also retained its va
lidity. He suggests that as many
of the world's stable free nations
as feasible, including at the very
least the United States, Great
Britain, and France, unite in a
federation, much as the thirteen
American states did in 1789. Be
cause the stable free nations tend
to be concentrated in the North
Atlantic area, this proposed fed
eration is usually called Atlantic
Union.
Constitutional Convention Needed
More specifically, Streit calls
for a federal convention modeled
on the American Constitutional
[Convention of 1757, with dele
gates chosen by each participat
ing nation from among its own
citizens, but acting on their own
without instructions and without
the power to commit their coun
tries.
These delegates would draw up
a federal Constitution and submit
it for ratification by each nation;
probably most nations would rat
ify by amending their own Con
stitutions. Each nation would be
free to refuse to ratify; if the
number of those ratifying was
not less than a minimum speci
fier! in the Constitution, it would
go into effect among the ratify
ing nations.
The Constitution would of
course provide for a Union legis
lature and executive, elected by
tlie people of the Union, and a
Union judiciary; it would of
course contain a bill of rights and
the other safeguards necessary
to freedom and federalism. It
and the laws passed under i'
would be the supreme law of the
Union. It would provide for a
Union common market and a
Union citizenship, and would give
the Union the sole right to issue
'■•urrenc". to provide for defense,
to regulate commerce among its
spates and between itself and
other parts of the world, and to
conduct diplomacy toward other
narts of the world.
Unlike the American Const it u
tion. it would probably provide
for gradual implementation of
some of its provisions by the
Union government, under specific
deadlines, since time would be
needed to work out the details
of transition and since sudden
change could be harmful.
Would Accomplish Much
Atlantic Union would bring its
citizens such benefits as free
trade and travel within the Union,
stable currency, an end to the
present expensive duplication of
military facilities and scientific
research, and legal and political
machinery to settle disputes
among its states peacefully a n d
equitably and to solve economic
problems none of its slates could
solve alone.
It would improve the world
situation by strengthening the na-1
tions most dedicated to peace and
freedom, by providing a stronger
deterrent to would-be aggressors.'
and by giving Europeans the j
greater voice they want in con- i
trol of nuclear weapons while at ;
the same reducing the danger of I
nuclear proliferation. It would!
encourage freedom throughout j
the world by placing a premium ;
<»nit an opportunity for na-1
tions showing promisp in this di- ;
rection to join.

♦
Bi'St Alternative
Atlantic Union has several ad
vantages over other proposed
methods of uniting the Atlantic
community and the free world.
While allowing for as much grad
ualism as necessary in working
i out the details of transition, it
j would allow these details to be
j treated as a coherent whole, the
I way they should be, rather than
; piecemeal, the only way they can
I be now; and it would provide a
j guarantee that disagreement on
! a few details could not sabotage
| agreement on most others, since
: a federal Constitution and gov
ernment would be much more
durable than present forms of
unity.
Unlike the presently popular
1 plan of federating Europe and
| then joining it and the United
i States in an as yet undefined
"partnership," Atlantic Union
; would make the admission of new
nations into the system reason-
I ably simple and straightward,
I avoid placing Canada in a diffi
| cult position, avoid the dangerous
| economic situation that would re
i suit from two currencies (Euro
pean and American) competing
for dominance in international
exchange and from the large
number of claims against th e
American dollar held in Europe,
| and avoid the danger that th e
| United States and Europe would
i lose effectiveness by working at
cross purposes.
All this is not to say that the
i European nations could not
I achieve closer unity within the
i Union by making interstate
! agreements much as states of the
i American Union do now, nor that
t work on other steps toward At
i lantic and free world unity need
•bo stopped while I lie Atlantic
i Union is being formed.
Is It Practical?
I No matter how good Atlantic
j Union is, it can be worthy of seri-
I ous consideration only if there is
a reasonable chance of bringing
it about. To do this we must get
1 a great many people to agree to
; it, and at first sight this seems
; a great, perhaps insurmountable,
j obstacle.
j Actually the situation is con-
I siderablv better than one might
I think at first. Support for At
j lantic unity in general and At
lantic Union in particular has
j come from quarters where one
; would expect, solid opposition,
; and there are a number of indi
cations that such support may
become more widespread.
Even Charles de Gaulle has
made some statements in hi s
press conferences which sound
very much like hints that he
would be more receptive to At
lantic unity, and quite possibly
Union, if the United States
showed more interest in giving
Europeans a fairer share of con
trol over decisions that affect
, the entire Atlantic community.
Also, a careful study of t ii e
| formation of the United States
| shows that the obstacles to Amer
ican Union then were probably
at least as great as the obstacles
to Atlantic Union now, yet the
American Union succeeded.
