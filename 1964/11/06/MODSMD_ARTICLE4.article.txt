"Oh where, 011 where has our
gold cannon gone . . ."
This question now plagues
the Cal Rally Committee as
ownership of the traditional
cannon seesaws between the
Rally Com and a group of Stan
ford students.
The (500-pound cannon, stolen
late Saturday by a Stanford
group known as the SURF's,
was recovered Monday by Cal.
But Wednesday morning, the
SURF raided the Berkeley
campus again and retook the
cannon.
According to the anonymous
Stanford leader, discovery of

the second theft led to a hassle
among: several Cal groups. The
Cal official from whose fourth
floor office the cannon was
taken, the Rally Com and the
Cal hand all accused each other
of having it. Then they all con
cluded gloomily that Stanford
must have the weapon again.
This prompted a quick Rally
Com trip to Stanford Wednes
day night to negotiate for the
cannon. "I don't feel that
breaking into the executive of
fice is in the spirit of big game
fun," cried one Rally Com
member.
The president of SURF said
members of ( li e Cal group,

who have reportedly pressed
breaking and entering charges
against the Stanford group,
said "it was in bad faith" to
steal the cannon a second time.
"While tliey were preaching
'bad faith' to us," the SURF
leader stated, "they were dying
Mem Claw blue."
Attempting to persuade the
SURF to return the cannon,
the Rally Com said they hud
gotten special permission from
the governor of Washington to
fire the cannon there Saturday.
But the SURF's didn't have
the cannon. They had given it
to a group of unknown Stan
ford students.
