# Objections Postpone Legislation

Reference of a bilJ concerning
the Student Affairs Committee
to the LASSU By-Laws Commit
tee highlighted last night's ses
sion of that body.
The action came after the bill
had been reported out of commit
tee with a recommendation to ap
prove. However, objections from
the floor, including a charge by
ASSU President Scott. Mcßride
that the Bill was "full of incon
sistancies," prompted a \<>te to
send it back to the committee for
further hearings.
APPROVAL OF the legislation
would allow LASSU representa
tives who are members of the
Student Affairs Committee to
have a vote in the executive
board or committee to which they
are assigned. Mcßride further re
marked that several chairmen of
such committees had come to
him personally and expressed
their objections to the bill.
In other action the legislature
voted to establish a five member
committee to investigate election
by-laws and procedures and make
recommendations for reetifica
t ion of problems.
It further passed resolutions
urging its members to invite their
constituents to all open meetings
of the body and instructing th e
Elections Commission to conduct
an election of eight more off
campus LASSU representatives in
order to meet the maximum num
ber of fifteen.
ROUNDING OUT the evening's
meeting, LASSU adopted a reso
lution authorizing the formula
tion of a history of the legislature
after striking a clause recom
mending use of the Daily as a
source of past actions.
Earlier in the assembly Presi
dent Mcßride reported to I ASSU
that his plan to provide the op
portunity for any authorized
group on campus to have .100 cop
ies of a statement of their opinion
distributed through his office, had
met a general lack of interest.
