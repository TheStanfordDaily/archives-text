Life
Is What You Make It?
I
Is life what you make it? Certainly most people hold that, as a creature
of free will, man is what tie wants to be and gets to the top only by hard
work and effort. The leader is thought of as a man of strong will and deter
mination, someone who drives himself in order to succeed. But there is more
to "successful" life than firm resolve and arduous effort.
"Do not be deceived; God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that
he will also reap. For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap
corruption; but he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal
life." (Galatians 6:7â€”8)
But what is "sowing to the flesh ? Basically, it is acting independently
of God, in self-effort, striving forword with selfish ends and motives in mind.
This process has inevitable consequences; Now the works of the flesh are
plain: immorality, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, emnity, strife, j
jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension, party spirit, envy, drunkeness, carous
ing and the like. I warn you as I warned you before that those who do such
things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." (Galatians 5:19-21). Since all
of us have sinned (Romans 3:23) we all know something of the works of
the flesh" in experience.
But what is the alternative? Only those who turn to God and seek His
help know the liberation and freedom from a man-centered life which Jesus
Christ brings: "For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh,
could not do: sending His own Son ir. the likeness of sinful flesh, and for :
sin He condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the just requirement of the
law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but accord
ing to the Holy Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their !
minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit j
set their minds on the things of the Spirit. To set the mind on the flesh is
death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace." (Romans 8:3-6)
To live and walk with Jesus Christ, to live in total dependence on His
Holy Spirit (resident within every believer) produces results which must be '
experienced to be comprehended. However you too can know this experience:
"... the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, against such there is now law.' (Gala
tians 5:22-23)
Yes, in a way, life is what you make it. Bui in the fullest sense, life is
! what you let God make it lor you. The principles on which God's universe
I operates are invariant and the conseauences of every action inevitable. If
you fail to discover this truth until after your life on this earth, you II be too
late! "Discover" the truth now! Meet today the Savior who promises to make
real a rich, full life of love and peace. A life which He promises, quite
I literally speaking, will continue forever. For whosoever shall coll upon the
name of the lord shall be saved. (Romains 10:13)
