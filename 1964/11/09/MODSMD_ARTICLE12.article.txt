# Further Cal Riots Expected
## Protest Group To Exercise Rights 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Further demonstrations seem
like!) at Cal-Berkeley today,
j Mario Savio, chairman ol the
Free Speech Movement (FSM)
Steering Committee, told a press
conference yesterday that "we in
tend to exercise our Constitu
tional rights . . . and advocate
political action by setting up
tables (on campus) to distribute
information and solicit funds . .
Under current University pol
icy, this action would be illegal.
THE CONFLICT on this issue
led to massive student demonstra
tions early last month.
At that time, University Presi
dent Clark Kerr agreed to set up
an impartial Political Activity
Committee consisting of six stu
dents (some of them members of
I FSM), six faculty professors and
j six administrators to study FSM's
i demands for "complete freedom of
| speech, assembly and association
I on campus under the First a nd
i Fourteenth Amendments to the
j Constitution of the United States"
(FSM Bulletin).
Saturday, the committee readied
what Savio called an "impasse."
The students had submitted a
resolution the week before declar
ing, "It is the sense of this com
mittee that there be complete free
dom of speech on campus for all
j persons, in certain geographical
! areas." A vote on this resolution
i was tabled until next Saturday.
At that time, according to The
Daily Cal, the administrators re
jected the resolution because the
University was under "external
pressures" from the surrounding
community so great that they
could not comply with this de
mand.
DURING the same session of
: the Political Activities Committee,
| the faculty proposed an alterna*
tive resolution, Art Goldberg told
The Daily yesterday.
Goldberg was one of eight slu
-1 dents suspended last month for
his participation in the demonstra
i tions.
The faculty proposed, and the
[Administration supported, a reso
lution supporting freedom of
spech on the campus except for
j "illegal advocacy." The exact
I meaning of this phrase was de
| bated and then rejected by the stu-
I dents.
The next confrontation should
i take place today at noon at Sproul
! Hall.
