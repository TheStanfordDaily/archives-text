# Hong Kong Education Now Severely Limited
## 
### 
An influx of more than three million people into Hong Kong
in the last twenty years has created acute problems, particularly
in the field of education, according to Jim Baxter of the World
University Service of Stanford.
The government and private organizations have found it impos-

sible to adjust to the educational
needs of more than one million
school-age people in Hong King.
In spite of accelerated school con
struction programs, only 750,000
of the million are in school, many
on split sessions.
OPPORTUNITY for higher edu
cation is severely limited. The
restrictions are too extensive for
many of the people and the edu
cation itself is relatively expen
sive. One requirement calls for "a
good knowledge of spoken and
written English." Baxter pointed
out that fewer than 70,000 of
Hong Kong's secondary students
are in English schools.
Students with the English edu

cation can hope to attend the Uni
versity of Hong Kong with an
enrollment of about seventeen
hundred. The remainder and vast
majority of the secondary stu
dents have the alternative of at
tending a "post-secondary Col
lege."
THESE SCHOOLS are no t
recognized by the British as uni
versities, but even with them, only
one in forty-one studertts in Hong
Kong can now expect to go to
college.
Baxter said that all is needed
now is funds and by supporting
the WUS, Stanford can help limit
the waste of human potential and
aid the development of Hong
Kong.
