# STANFORD'S MISTAKES LEAD TO LOSS
## Trojans Edge Indians, 15-10 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's defense played vali
antly Saturday, but a combination
of offensive mistakes and the run
ning of University of Southern
California rushing ace, Mike Gar
rett, was just too much. The In
dians lost the game 15-10.
For the most part the Indians
contained the passing of USC
quarterback Craig Fertig, but
stopping the off-tackle slants of
halfback Garrett was another
case.
IN GAINING his 98 yards and
two touchdowns Garrett was su
perb. When his tackles weren't
able to open a hole for him he just
scooted around end for yardage.
Numerous times he stepped out of
tacklers' grasps to gain four ex
tra yards. Garrett was voted Back
of the Game unanimously.
Offensively, mistakes took a
high toll on Stanford's aspira
tions to victory.
The Trojans capitalized on three
of these mistakes to score all of
their points.
STANFORD'S scores came from
a recovery of an USC fumble and
from a 16 play, 82-yard drive in
the third quarter.
The first score of the game was
the result of some good defensive
play by co-captain and safety Dick
Ragsdale. USC's 220-pound full

back Homer Williams was sweep
ing right end when Ragsdale hit
him with a jarring tackle forcing
Williams to fumble. John Guil
lory recovered for Stanford at the
Trojan 32-yard line.
Then with a fourth and two sit
uation Eraden Beck booted a 41-
yard field goal.
FOLLOWING the kick-off Troy
moved 50 yards in eight plays to
a first and ten situation at the In
dian 14-yard marker.
Stanford's defense stiffened at
this point and with fourth down
and six yards to go from the 11 a
pass fell incomplete. The key play
in the stand was Boh Howard, de
fensive end, throwing Ron Heller
for a three-yard loss at the eight.
Before the loss USC had a third
and four situation.
Taking over at the 11 the Car
dinals moved to the 42 were Pete
Middlekauff had the ball knocked
from his hand. Nate Shaw recov
ered for USC.
GARRETT swept left end from
seven yards for the touchdown.
The extra point, try was blocked
by Howard.
An 11-yard pass to flanker Rod
Sherman over the middle and a
16-yard pass to end Fred Hill on a

cross pattern set up ihe score.
Halfway through the second
quarter the Indians showed signs
of being on the move until a clip
ping penalty forced them to at
tempt a 55-yard field goal w hi c h
missed.
With third and fifteen from the
Trojan 35, an end sweep gained
14 yards, but a clipping infraction
put the ball on the 38 instead,
making them go for the field goal.
USC THEN marched 80 yards
in 13 plays to increase their lead
by 6 points. Garrett capped the
drive with an off-tackle dive for
the last yard.
The big plays of the drive were
two passes. The first was from
the Trojan 31. Fertig hit Sherman
who was wide open for a gain of
23 yards. On the next play Fertig
hit end Dave Moton for 14 yards
to the Stanford 32.
The pass for two extra points
was broken up by Ragsdale and
Guillory.
Late in the third quarter behind
some fine blocking by guard Joe
Neal Stanford moved steadily
down field from its own 18.
SOPHOMORE Dave Lewis was
running the team with a third and j
nine situation from the USC 29- :

yard lino. As the quarter ended
on the first play of the last period,
Lewis rolled to the right faking
an end sweep. Meanwhile another
sophomore Bob Blunt, Ray Hand
ley's sub, flared around left end,
sped up the sideline, caught
Lewis' cross field pass at the four,
and cakewalked into the end zone.
Beck made the PAT. Narrowing
the score to 12-10 in favor of Troy.
Following an USC punt Stan
ford had the ball on their own 10,
first and 10 to go. Handley, w ho
could only gain 37 yards, then
fumbled. The Trojans recovered
the ball at the 10-yard line.
GARY PETTIGREW kept what
hopes Stanford had alive by hit
ting Fertig for an eight-yard loss
at the seven-yard line. This made
USC go for the three points in
stead of a touchdown. The field
goal was good and Troy lead by
five points with 10 minutes left
to play.
The Indians got the ball three
times after that but the first time
John Lockwood intercepted for
USC, the second time John Read
fumbled and USC linebacker Marv
Bain recovered at the 50, the third
time Stanford lost one yard on
a fourth and one situation.
