Last Thursday, The Daily Calil'ornian published an editorial
lambasting Cal's Rally Com for its "extreme carelessness" in
guarding the university's famed golden cannon.
•'Mow was it stolen this time?" the editorial sarcastically
questioned. Rally Com was not able to provide a satisfactory
answer.
The editorial, in effect, charged Kally Com with gross neg
ligence. Cause for its scolding tone was the loss of the big
howitzer, stolen by the SUKF's (a local group), for the second
time within a four day period.
As will be recalled, the enterprising Sl'RF's abducted the
big gun last Sunday. Csil quickly organized its own UCRF and,
under the leadership of Doric Ball, was successful in recover
ing the cannon. (Ball is reputed to have certain, strategic Stan
ford "contacts.")
The SURF's, undauhted by the rapid turn of events, reas
sembled their forces and again took up the campaign. Their
perseverance was amply rewarded — they succeeded in nab
bing the cannon straight from the executive offices of Cat's
student union.
When pressed to explain this second "kidnapping" of the
cannon, Cal's Rally Coin was finally forced to theorize that the
Sl'RF's had "entered the Union looking for anything, and acci
dentally found the cannon."
The editorial found this theory .j list a bit unpalatable, and
dutifully accused the cannon's guardians with "either extreme
carelessness or some form of foul play."
"It's foul play we hope — we would hah- to believe Rally
Com couldn't keep track of a cannon.
"A golden cannon at that."
