While visiting the Mausoleum
one night I unearthed two adobe
tablets from the Great YelMeader
in the sky.
1. Thou shalt have no other
Yell-leaders before thous, except
ing such assistants as 1 shall
choose. 2. Thou shalt not make of
thyself a raving image (that's my
job). 3. Thous shalt not raise
thine essential finger in vain. 4.
Remember Saturday, to keep it
spirited; for six days are set aside
for booking and the seventh day
for fun and spirits. 5. Honor thy
Yell-leader and thy footbal team,
that thy days in the rooting sec
tion might be bitchin'. 6. Thous
shalt not kill, excepting referees
and opponents. 7. Thou shalt not
allow that educational factory
across the bay to steal thy axe.
8. Thous shalt not covet thy pom
pan girls; thou shalt not covet
thy neighbor's seat, nor his date,
"nor his manservant, nor his
maidservant, nor his ox, nor his
ass," nor anything. ... 9. How i
ever, thous shalt elect Gil Ber
keley thy next Yell-leader.
The office of Head Yell-leader
is a demanding one. It requires a
unique combination of tact, re
sponsibility, sense of timing and
appropriateness, enthusiasm, crea
tivity, and perspiration. I am sin
cere in my desire to both lead and
serve the cheering section.

The position of Head Yell Lead
er on Stanford campus is of high
importance. Because of the variety
of talents necessary to a Head
Yell Leader, this person must be
extremely versatile, yet stable, a
person quick-witted, yet retaining
his coordination and poise, more
over, a person with a wide imagi
nation. Pie must be able to lead
yells that will be pleasing and en
joyable for everyone at the game.
I am running for Head Yell Lead
er because I know I can fulfill all
these requirements. From the
type of campaign I am employ
ing, I hope to prove that point.
I have definite, serious ideas
about: the post. For example, I
would like to see basketball games
given just as much support as
football, I would also like to hear
cheers intended to oppose the

enemy cheering section, thus pro
moting two contests, one on the
playing field and one in the
stands.
FLOOD'S
FOOTBALL FORMULA
Spear the Spartans! Bare the
Bruins! Hood the Falsons! Shoot
the Beavers! Hound the Huskies!
Cage the Cougars! Goose the
Ducks! Scuttle the Middies! Wear
out the Trojans! Snare the Bears!
Good Cheers plus Original Yells
plus Lot'sa Noise equals TOM
FLOOD as Head Yell Leader. A
vote for Flood is a vote for an
undefeated cheering section.

Some people consider me the
dark horse candidate for Head
Cheer Leader. However, dark
horses have been known to
change the complexion of many a
race. I know I can add more
spirit, life, spontaneity, noise and
color to the office of head cheer-
jyeader than anyone this side of

the Sheraton Palace lobby.
I'm sure that more enthusiasm
from the cheering section during
the games will definitely produce
exciting, WINNING games on the
playing field. Even if we lose the
game we'll claim a moral victory
for staging the largest, noisiest
si tin ever.
If elected I plan to employ all
sorts of stunts to transform the
Stanford cheering section into a
raging mob.
And yes sports fans—just what
you've all been waiting for: MOB
VIOLENCE YELLS. These yells
require a bodily contribution
from everyone in the crowd. Who
knows, w« may even use some
Mississippi KKK techniques.
This off-'color" cheerleader may
shock you, will make you laugh,
and may rattle your adenoids —
but you will never forget me!
Why by bothered by superior
products, discard your brand "Y"
and "Z", vote brand "X", me —
FRANCISCO "X."
