## Observations Among 'The Red's' Rooters 
### Roger Magnuson 
A variegated train of Stanford spectators, having scraped the last
remnants of crepe paper from under the chicken wire scarred
fingernails, made its habitual and serene Saturday somnambulance
into the student rooting section.
The gross top third of Hoover tower extended above the press
box with its symbolic antithesis, The Big Dish, clearly visible against
the foothills in the afternoon sun.
"Zorch on cultural exchanges," I remarked, hunched over on a
musty wooden pew. Separating a sportswriter from the comforts
j and prestige of his beloved pressbox in a fit of misplaced egalitarian
I other-directedness is certainly above and beyond, I thought.
The scent of fresh dunagree aroused me from my sulk and I
noted a lad with greasy black hair take a seat and roll up the cuffs
on his new Lee Riders, his now union-made Lee Riders as the label
advertised.
"It should be a real R.F. day,"he beamed to a similarly clad
female companion.
THE GREASY AND GROSS
Soon everyone was seated; including a group of about twenty
five under the command of an intense fellow whose unique specialty
was gross cheers.
"Stop the Trojan penetration," he yelled. Before the game began.
(Gross heckles need never be relevant.)
On the field Jack Chappie was applying a rather rigorous tackle
to Miko Garrett of S.C. "R.F." cried the lad in the bluejeans. "Tro
jans are weak and unreliable" cried the fuehrer of the group of
gross storm troopers.
The play also managed to excite some more adequately garbed
victims of the Stanford experience.
"What would you do if he came running at you like that?" the
dolly asked her escort, whose face was contorted into a permanent
"cool" look.
THE NEAT AND NON VIOLENT
"First," he said after a moment of reflection, "I would assume
a non-violent position."
By this time the referee had made a series of unpopular decisions;
in point of fact, the gentleman was either a possessor of extremely
bad judgment or else downright sinister. He moved the ball around
so much after a whistle had blown that one linesman was fatally
strangled in his own chains.
His inadequacies did not escape the purview of the Stanford spec
tators. "Your mother drives a beer truck." "Ohhhhhhhhhhh, horse
merde," contributed the gross ones.
AND TIME FOR INSPECTION
And soon it was halftime, and with the S.C. Band in their silly uni
forms (who ever saw a Trojan in tennis shoes) and Tom Trojan
on his white palomino forming the background, the fans settled back
to the really important business of closely inspecting the candidates
for yell leader.
After some run-of-the-mill yells, a roar greeted the arrival of the
KKK hooded supporters of Francisco X.
"R.F., R.F." shrieked the girlfriend of the greasy one. Who
scratched his union-label.
"They'll never win depending on the Stanford backlash," observed
the lad temporarily innovating on his permanent "cool" look.
Then Francisco X took off his hood.
"With the frontlash, he just may be the darkhorse in the race,"
said the lad now once more fixed into his permanent facial expres
sion.
Francisco gave his cheer, and the teams trotted back on the
gridiron.
And eventually the game was over, and everyone was rather
disappointed. And rather relieved. Wooden pews, and also knees, can
be uncomfortable. And some of the best of homecoming week was
yet to come.
