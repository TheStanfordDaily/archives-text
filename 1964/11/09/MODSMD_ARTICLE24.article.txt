## Lesson Of '64 Election: Mass Of Voters In Center 
### Walter Lippmann 
The returns have confirmed is a most remarkable way the find
ings ol the national polls, particularly the Harris and the Gallup.
They reported that Johnson and Humphrey would win by a ma
jority in the range between 60 and 70 per cent ol the votes cast,
and that this would give them a landslide majority in the electorial

college. 4
The returns confirm also the
predictions of the leading anti-
Goldwater Republicans, notably
Rockefeller and Scranton, who
warned their party that the nomi- j
nation of Goldwater would be a
devastating blow to the Republi
can party in the leading Repub
lican states of the East and Mid
dle West.
No Latent Conservatives
At the same time the returns!
prove the falsity of tho claim, j
which has been put forward since j
the Roosevelt days, that there is
a great, silent latent majority of j
''conservative" Republicans who
will emerge as soon as the Re
publican party turns its back on |
"me-tooism" and offers them "a j
choice."
The Johnson majority is indis
putable proof that the preponder
ant mass of the American voters
are in the center, inside the two
extremes, and that the reason
the Democrats win is thai Ken
nedy and Johnson have worked
carefully and deliberately to make
the Democratic party represent
the center.
Extremist Rebellion Fails
This surely is the primary man
date of the 1964 election, a man
date to both parties to seek their
strength and define their issues!
within, not against, the prevailing
concensus. Senator Goldwater
took the Republican party down
to a catastrophic defeat because)
he made himself t lie leader, or j
at least ihe rallying point, of an
extremist rebellion against the I
great majority of Americans. The |
will of the majority has prevailed ]
over him.
The election is a resounding
vote of confidence in the capacity
of President Johnson to represent
the will of the great majority. The
campaign did not produce a pre
view of what his administration
will do about the myriad of speci
fic problems which it will have to

deal with. The campaign did not
produce a debate about specific
programs, and this was fortunate.
Accepted Line Confirmed
For the real business of the
campaign was not to map out a
course for the future. It was to
beat and crush a rebellion against
the established and accepted line
of domestic and foreign policy
which was laid down in the gen
eration which followed the great
j depression and the second world
j war.
So on the day after election it
j is too early, and in fact beside the
! point, to attempt to read into the
I return's an outline of the policies
| of the Johnson administration. It
| is too early also to attempt to
j read into the Republican disaster
a prescription for the party's sal
: vat ion and survival.
Consequence of SF Surrender
But the first lesson for the Re
publicans is clear that they will
not prosper if they surrender, as
they did at San Francisco, and do
not stand up for their own be
liefs. The returns, which leave the
Republican party with virtually
nothing more than a handful of
states, won by racist votes, is a
squalid and humiliating conse-
I quence of the San Francisco sur
! render.
What Johnson should do with
his victory and what the Repub
licans can do with their defeat is
as yet unanswerable: it is rather
like trying on the morning after
! an earthquake to select the cur
tains and the rugs for the houses
which will be built when the dam
age has been studied and the dust
j has settled.
