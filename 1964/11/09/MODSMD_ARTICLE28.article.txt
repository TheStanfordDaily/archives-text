## Has Americanism Gone Out Of Style? 
### 
IJcar Sir:
The "Campus Opinion" column
of 6 November by Mr. Commons
contains several statements with
which I disagree. There is one,
however, with which I take par
ticular umbrage. In discussing
conservative methods of achieving
their goals, it is stated that con
servatives will do anything in
cluding "... open espousal of pro-
American propaganda in the
schools. . . . "in this cause.
It is inconseivable to me that
there exists in the minds of some
American citizens the idea that we
should not espouse "pro-American
propaganda." The word propa
ganda was used, I am sure, to
lend an additional aura of shadi
ness to the idea that pro-Ameri
can teachings be openly allowed
to exist in the schools. It is to be
inferred from this column tlicit it
is now considered unfashionable
in some circles to be pro-American
in this country?
If we do not teach future Ameri
cans in American schools that the
Constitution and all its ramifica
tions is worthy of their support,
where in this wide world will it
be taught? Have we lost our devo
tion to our country and its ideals?
It is time to strengthen our na

tion's foundations not weaken
them by ridicule and innuendo.
Such phrases as "pro-American
, propaganda," used in the context
of Mr. Commons article, are the
type of statement one expects
from people with political persua
: sions other than democracy. . . .

• Totalitarian Attitude
Dear Sir:
Huey Long once spoke to the
i effect that Fascism would come
I to America in the form of anti
' fascism. Though not approving
of Mr. Long's principles, I sub
mit David Steingarten's letter as
proof of the Kingfish's intuition.
A university such as Stanford
ought to tolerate every sort of
J opinion not destructive of the
; public order so that its student
: body may have access to those
I opinions. Education does not exist
to preserve prejudice by refusing
j some the l ight to speak, but to
encourage diversity of opinion so
students, who are presumed to
be mature, may make their own
choices.
In this context, Mr. Rockwell
has every right and justification
to speak at Stanford. And it is
the student body's responsibility
to listen with open minds to what
he has to say, then judge what
I he has said in the light of their
education and experience.
It is neither the responsibility
; of this university to show sym
pathy nor express disgust at Mr.
Rockwell's antics. It is our re
sponsibility to listen to even this
pathetic philosophy. Twelve mil
lions of men of all nations, all
creeds, all ideologies willingly
gave their lives for our right to
hear and say whatsoever we wish.
We must make it our sad task
I to listen to the totalitarian atti
tude which admits only its own
views and seeks to suppress all
others so that we may understand
and avoid it whatever symbols it
! uses — Swastika or Star of David.
