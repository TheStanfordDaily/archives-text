## Defeat Of Goldwater Not Death Of Conservatism 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
It will have been said, by the time these words appear, that
Goldwater eonservatism is dead, dead, dead. The undertakers
are premature, I do believe.
There are a number of statistical precedents of some bearing.
Granted that statistics are wonderfully servile things, which can

be ordered around to prove al-+
most anything at all. Still, those
conservatives who have given
way to despair might remind
themselves that the socialist party
in England only five years ago
lost by a percentage roughly
equal to Senator Goldwater's:
and there they are, back in power.
Those liberals who have given

way to elation
s ho u 1 d remind
themselves that
th e Democrats
lost in 1924 by
a margin rough
ly comparable
to Senator Gold
wate r ' s, just
eight years be
fore they seized
American hi s-

! tory by the mane and ruled su
| preme for twenty years. One;
! year's landslide loss, in other
J words, is not necessarily a per-!
I manent thing in a dynamic so-!
! eiety, and there is no reason for '
American conservatives to believe !
either that their hearts deceived i
them in telling them he was right, !
or that the time will never come j
again when the American people j
can correct our public policies.
Original Chances Slim
The odds against Senator Gold- j
I water were enormous, beyond tlie i
! unpopular conservatism of his
! position. I ventured to say after
his victory in California that the
! odds against him were roughly !
five to one, and that the odds
were at least as great, if not
greater, against any other con
ceivable Republican candidate. It
is. I believe, important to stress
this distinction in conducting the
post-mortems.
Senator Goldwater won the Re-:
! publican primary in California, j
j Having done so he was cast by:
: history as the inevitable candidate j
j of the Republican Party. If Gov-,
i ernor Sr a n ton, Govern or
| Rockefeller, or Governor Romney
I had wrested the nomination at
j that point, Goldwater Republi
cans would have deserted the
j GOP in droves even greater than
those that deserted the Party in
! protest against Senator Gol d
water's nomination. (It is hardly
an insignificant achievement that
Goldwater got 25,000,000 Ameri
cans to vote for him.) The Repub
lican Party, in short, was stuck
in 1964 with the crystallization of
the deep split within its ranks.
Johnson's Good Fortune
If one then adds to this division
the natural factors that worked ,
for Lyndon Johnson—a new Presi- '

dent enjoying a political honey-!
moon, sustained by the trauma
that persists as the result of the I
assassination of his predecessor,
buoyed by the felicitous coopera
tion of the world around him, a
! booming economy, a Communist
J world momentarily paralyzed by
introversion. ... It would have
taken a jumbosized miracle to ac
complish a victory for any man
who seemed to be saying to the
people that the reigning sun-king
should be impreached because his !
soul is unlaundered.
American conservatives should j
not then, so far as I can see, lose !
j heart; although some of them
| should, finally and forever, put
| aside that consoling dogma th e y
1 have tucked under their pillows j
ever since Willkie was defeated in j
1940, namely, that the Republi
| cans have only to nominate a
I sure-enough conservative to guar
|an toe a sweep, coast to coast j
! That little romantic wraith was)
I forever intoned by ihe vote last !
; Tuesday.
Another Myth Interred
And henceforward conserva-1
| tives will, 1 hope, be forever liber- j
ated from the Platonic trance j
that one has only to make Truth
j available as an alternative to Er-!
j ror, in order to rest secure. Truth j
1 is a demure lady, much too lady- j
like to knock you on the head and ,
: drag you to her cave. She is |
there, but the people must want 1
! her, and seek her out.
Finally, American conserva
tives are entitled hotly to resent
i the notion that the returns have
transcribed for all time the Ameri
can consensus on the critical j
issues of our day. It is unsafe to j
conclude that the people endorsed i
the President's ambiguous foreign j
policy, that they are prepared to
j endure Die rigors of a coerced 1
j egalitarianism (in New York both
, Keating and Kennedy were con-
I strained to come out against the
! bussing of students to integrated
schools), premature to suppose
; that the question is forever set
-1 tied to retain the federal system.
What the conservatives need to j
; meditate upon is something more
j than the artificial factors that
tended to militate in President's
favor. They need to develop, if
they can, a political idiom which
will successfully communicate to I
the masses of the people the in
extricable relationship between
their political ideas and the best!
ideals of humankind.

It will have been said, by the time these words appear, that
Goldwater eonservatism is dead, dead, dead. The undertakers
are premature, I do believe.
There are a number of statistical precedents of some bearing.
Granted that statistics are wonderfully servile things, which can

be ordered around to prove al-+
most anything at all. Still, those
conservatives who have given
way to despair might remind
themselves that the socialist party
in England only five years ago
lost by a percentage roughly
equal to Senator Goldwater's:
and there they are, back in power.
Those liberals who have given

way to elation
s ho u 1 d remind
themselves that
th e Democrats
lost in 1924 by
a margin rough
ly comparable
to Senator Gold
wate r ' s, just
eight years be
fore they seized
American hi s-

! tory by the mane and ruled su
| preme for twenty years. One;
! year's landslide loss, in other
J words, is not necessarily a per-!
I manent thing in a dynamic so-!
! eiety, and there is no reason for '
American conservatives to believe !
either that their hearts deceived i
them in telling them he was right, !
or that the time will never come j
again when the American people j
can correct our public policies.
Original Chances Slim
The odds against Senator Gold- j
I water were enormous, beyond tlie i
! unpopular conservatism of his
! position. I ventured to say after
his victory in California that the
! odds against him were roughly !
five to one, and that the odds
were at least as great, if not
greater, against any other con
ceivable Republican candidate. It
is. I believe, important to stress
this distinction in conducting the
post-mortems.
Senator Goldwater won the Re-:
! publican primary in California, j
j Having done so he was cast by:
: history as the inevitable candidate j
j of the Republican Party. If Gov-,
i ernor Sr a n ton, Govern or
| Rockefeller, or Governor Romney
I had wrested the nomination at
j that point, Goldwater Republi
cans would have deserted the
j GOP in droves even greater than
those that deserted the Party in
! protest against Senator Gol d
water's nomination. (It is hardly
an insignificant achievement that
Goldwater got 25,000,000 Ameri
cans to vote for him.) The Repub
lican Party, in short, was stuck
in 1964 with the crystallization of
the deep split within its ranks.
Johnson's Good Fortune
If one then adds to this division
the natural factors that worked ,
for Lyndon Johnson—a new Presi- '

dent enjoying a political honey-!
moon, sustained by the trauma
that persists as the result of the I
assassination of his predecessor,
buoyed by the felicitous coopera
tion of the world around him, a
! booming economy, a Communist
J world momentarily paralyzed by
introversion. ... It would have
taken a jumbosized miracle to ac
complish a victory for any man
who seemed to be saying to the
people that the reigning sun-king
should be impreached because his !
soul is unlaundered.
American conservatives should j
not then, so far as I can see, lose !
j heart; although some of them
| should, finally and forever, put
| aside that consoling dogma th e y
1 have tucked under their pillows j
ever since Willkie was defeated in j
1940, namely, that the Republi
| cans have only to nominate a
I sure-enough conservative to guar
|an toe a sweep, coast to coast j
! That little romantic wraith was)
I forever intoned by ihe vote last !
; Tuesday.
Another Myth Interred
And henceforward conserva-1
| tives will, 1 hope, be forever liber- j
ated from the Platonic trance j
that one has only to make Truth
j available as an alternative to Er-!
j ror, in order to rest secure. Truth j
1 is a demure lady, much too lady- j
like to knock you on the head and ,
: drag you to her cave. She is |
there, but the people must want 1
! her, and seek her out.
Finally, American conserva
tives are entitled hotly to resent
i the notion that the returns have
transcribed for all time the Ameri
can consensus on the critical j
issues of our day. It is unsafe to j
conclude that the people endorsed i
the President's ambiguous foreign j
policy, that they are prepared to
j endure Die rigors of a coerced 1
j egalitarianism (in New York both
, Keating and Kennedy were con-
I strained to come out against the
! bussing of students to integrated
schools), premature to suppose
; that the question is forever set
-1 tied to retain the federal system.
What the conservatives need to j
; meditate upon is something more
j than the artificial factors that
tended to militate in President's
favor. They need to develop, if
they can, a political idiom which
will successfully communicate to I
the masses of the people the in
extricable relationship between
their political ideas and the best!
ideals of humankind.

Goldwater eonservatism is dead, dead, dead. The undertakers
are premature, I do believe.
There are a number of statistical precedents of some bearing.
Granted that statistics are wonderfully servile things, which can

be ordered around to prove al-+
most anything at all. Still, those
conservatives who have given
way to despair might remind
themselves that the socialist party
in England only five years ago
lost by a percentage roughly
equal to Senator Goldwater's:
and there they are, back in power.
Those liberals who have given

way to elation
s ho u 1 d remind
themselves that
th e Democrats
lost in 1924 by
a margin rough
ly comparable
to Senator Gold
wate r ' s, just
eight years be
fore they seized
American hi s-

! tory by the mane and ruled su
| preme for twenty years. One;
! year's landslide loss, in other
J words, is not necessarily a per-!
I manent thing in a dynamic so-!
! eiety, and there is no reason for '
American conservatives to believe !
either that their hearts deceived i
them in telling them he was right, !
or that the time will never come j
again when the American people j
can correct our public policies.
Original Chances Slim
The odds against Senator Gold- j
I water were enormous, beyond tlie i
! unpopular conservatism of his
! position. I ventured to say after
his victory in California that the
! odds against him were roughly !
five to one, and that the odds
were at least as great, if not
greater, against any other con
ceivable Republican candidate. It
is. I believe, important to stress
this distinction in conducting the
post-mortems.
Senator Goldwater won the Re-:
! publican primary in California, j
j Having done so he was cast by:
: history as the inevitable candidate j
j of the Republican Party. If Gov-,
i ernor Sr a n ton, Govern or
| Rockefeller, or Governor Romney
I had wrested the nomination at
j that point, Goldwater Republi
cans would have deserted the
j GOP in droves even greater than
those that deserted the Party in
! protest against Senator Gol d
water's nomination. (It is hardly
an insignificant achievement that
Goldwater got 25,000,000 Ameri
cans to vote for him.) The Repub
lican Party, in short, was stuck
in 1964 with the crystallization of
the deep split within its ranks.
Johnson's Good Fortune
If one then adds to this division
the natural factors that worked ,
for Lyndon Johnson—a new Presi- '

dent enjoying a political honey-!
moon, sustained by the trauma
that persists as the result of the I
assassination of his predecessor,
buoyed by the felicitous coopera
tion of the world around him, a
! booming economy, a Communist
J world momentarily paralyzed by
introversion. ... It would have
taken a jumbosized miracle to ac
complish a victory for any man
who seemed to be saying to the
people that the reigning sun-king
should be impreached because his !
soul is unlaundered.
American conservatives should j
not then, so far as I can see, lose !
j heart; although some of them
| should, finally and forever, put
| aside that consoling dogma th e y
1 have tucked under their pillows j
ever since Willkie was defeated in j
1940, namely, that the Republi
| cans have only to nominate a
I sure-enough conservative to guar
|an toe a sweep, coast to coast j
! That little romantic wraith was)
I forever intoned by ihe vote last !
; Tuesday.
Another Myth Interred
And henceforward conserva-1
| tives will, 1 hope, be forever liber- j
ated from the Platonic trance j
that one has only to make Truth
j available as an alternative to Er-!
j ror, in order to rest secure. Truth j
1 is a demure lady, much too lady- j
like to knock you on the head and ,
: drag you to her cave. She is |
there, but the people must want 1
! her, and seek her out.
Finally, American conserva
tives are entitled hotly to resent
i the notion that the returns have
transcribed for all time the Ameri
can consensus on the critical j
issues of our day. It is unsafe to j
conclude that the people endorsed i
the President's ambiguous foreign j
policy, that they are prepared to
j endure Die rigors of a coerced 1
j egalitarianism (in New York both
, Keating and Kennedy were con-
I strained to come out against the
! bussing of students to integrated
schools), premature to suppose
; that the question is forever set
-1 tied to retain the federal system.
What the conservatives need to j
; meditate upon is something more
j than the artificial factors that
tended to militate in President's
favor. They need to develop, if
they can, a political idiom which
will successfully communicate to I
the masses of the people the in
extricable relationship between
their political ideas and the best!
ideals of humankind.
