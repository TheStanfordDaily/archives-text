ASSU President Scott Mcßride, Associate NSA Coordinator
Chuck Mcßrian, and Judy Wallborn, Chairman of the Mississippi
Freedom Project—Stanford (MFP-S) announced yesterday joint
plans for a "Thanksgiving Fast For Freedom" day November 19.
The "Fast," sponsored nationally by NSA, hopes to provide large

quantities of staple foods for the
impoverished Negro families of
rural Mississippi.
STANFORD STUDENTS will
ho asked to forgo the evening
meal on November 19 and attend
instead an hour-long presentation
on Mississippi. The University
Food Service has agreed to con
tribute the money saved on each
meal to a common fund which will
be used by NSA to purchase food.
The National Brotherhood of
Teamsters has agreed to ship the
food to Mississippi w i th o u t
charge.
Last year the "Fast For Free
dom" raised $10,250 on 42 cam
puses across the country and sent
80,000 pounds of food to Missis
sippi.
THIS YEAR to date over 46
colleges and universities are
pledged to participate in the pro
gram which has drawn the back
ing of every major civil rights or
ganization.
"The need for food during the
long, cold winter months of agri
cultural unemployment in Mis
sissippi is enormous," said M is s
Wallborn. "If sufficient relief is

not provided through efforts like
the Thanksgiving Fast For Free
dom, thousands of children and
adults will suffer from malnutri
tion bordering on starvation."
