According to George Nieolau,

the size of the student body, this is
a tremendous contribution."
"THE DIFFICULTY is that the
need is almost limitless," he said.
"At a time when more than 3,000
volunteers are scheduled to re
turn home, the countries of Asia,
Africa and Latin America are
doubling, and, in some cases, tripl
ing their requests for help."
