# 350 College Students Finish Advanced Training Session
## 
### 
Four college campuses were
sites this summer for the Peace
Corps" first advanced training
program for college juniors.
More than 400 students, rep
resenting 91 schools, had eight
week training sessions at Yale,
Dartmouth, the University of
California at Berkeley and San
Francisco State College. An in
housc training camp in Puerto
Rico served as a fifth facility.
By the end of August, 350
of the juniors had received basic
training for teaching in Africa
and community development
work in Latin America.
Following completion of their
senior year, the trainees will re
turn to training sites for addi
tional four-to-six week periods
before being sent overseas.
Dartmouth, host for the largest
program, saw 1 34 students com
plete its session, preparing for
secondary teaching in French
speaking West Africa.
Trainees had a full schedule,
beginning their day of classes,
seminars, panel discussions and
recreation activities at H a.m.
and closing out the slate at 9
p.m. Much of the rest of the
evening was devoted to prepara
tion for the next day's classes.
"One of the big advantages of
the Advanced Training program
is that it provides participants
with more intensive language
training," said Roger Landrum,
the program's training officer, a
former Volunteer who spent two
years teaching at the college level
in Nigeria. Trainees received
classroom training in French
four hours a day, six days a
week.

"The program attempts to
stress community life rather than
the national scope of the coun
tries," he explained. "We want
to deal with Africans as indi
viduals. Thus, we shifted the
emphasis from political and eco
nomic spheres to the more hu
manistic studies."
A highlight of this summer's
program was the participation of
15 Frenchmen, seven African
nationals and 10 returned Vol

unteers. They served as lan
guage tutors, lectured and led
panel discussions and seminars.
The program is not divided
into separate subject components
as are most Peace Corps training
projects. African studies, world
affairs, communism and Ameri
can studies were considered as
an integrated unit of ideas and
issues. These subjects were
taught and discussed as they have
been found to be relevant to con
temporary Africa and to the spe
cific work and experiences of
Peace Corps Volunteers.
Next summer several parts of
the Peace Corps' regular training
program, such as health training,
specific country and assignment
briefings and additional intensive

language and teacher training,
will be emphasized.
To participate in the advanced
training program, juniors must
fill out a regular Peace Corps
Questionnaire, write on the
front "Advanced Training," and
submit it when they take the
nation-wide placement test.
All applicants should have an
up-to-date transcript of college
records forwarded to the Peace
Corps, Division of Selection, as
soon as possible.
As with all trainees, juniors
selected to participate in the Ad
vanced Training program receive
travel allowances to cover trans
portation to and from the train
ing center and a modest living
allowance during the training
period.
