# 350 College Students Finish Advanced Training Session
## 
### 
Four college campuses were
sites this summer for the Peace
Corps" first advanced training
program for college juniors.
More than 400 students, rep
resenting 91 schools, had eight
week training sessions at Yale,
Dartmouth, the University of
California at Berkeley and San
Francisco State College. An in
housc training camp in Puerto
Rico served as a fifth facility.
By the end of August, 350
of the juniors had received basic
training for teaching in Africa
and community development
work in Latin America.
Following completion of their
senior year, the trainees will re
turn to training sites for addi
tional four-to-six week periods
before being sent overseas.
Dartmouth, host for the largest
program, saw 1 34 students com
plete its session, preparing for
secondary teaching in French
speaking West Africa.
Trainees had a full schedule,
beginning their day of classes,
seminars, panel discussions and
recreation activities at H a.m.
and closing out the slate at 9
p.m. Much of the rest of the
evening was devoted to prepara
tion for the next day's classes.
"One of the big advantages of
the Advanced Training program
is that it provides participants
with more intensive language
training," said Roger Landrum,
the program's training officer, a
former Volunteer who spent two
years teaching at the college level
in Nigeria. Trainees received
classroom training in French
four hours a day, six days a
week.

"The program attempts to
stress community life rather than
the national scope of the coun
tries," he explained. "We want
to deal with Africans as indi
viduals. Thus, we shifted the
emphasis from political and eco
nomic spheres to the more hu
manistic studies."
A highlight of this summer's
program was the participation of
15 Frenchmen, seven African
nationals and 10 returned Vol
