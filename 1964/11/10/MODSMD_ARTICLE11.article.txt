# Peace Corps Frightened By Any Hints of "Bureaucracy"
## 
### 
One thing the Peace Corps doesn't want to become is a
bureaucracy.
"There are signs of it creeping in now and then, but we try to
fight it," said one Washington office administrator. He attributed
these problems to the rapid growth of the Peace Corps.
The atmosphere in the Washington office is more like that of a
busy city room in a metropolitan newspaper plant than that of a
government department.
The work gets done, and lots of it, but it is done in a friendly,
informal atmosphere which enables departmental chiefs to work
alongside typists and secretaries without any thought of protocol.
The main reason for this refusal to become tied up in the
traditional red tape of the government is that about three-fourths
or more of the employees, according to one administrator, have
not been government workers previously.
Corresponding to this factor is the fact that most of the Peace
Corps people are around only for two or three years, then they
move on to other public jobs or back to private business. There
is no hard and fast rule decreeing that two years shall be the
length of service in the United States, just as it is overseas; but
that is the way the system works.
Another Washington official, with the Peace Corps two years,
put it this way:
"The Peace Corps, as a rule, is not something to make a career
of, but rather an ideal or dream with which to work while you
are fresh. After several years in any job, a person tends to
become entrenched and set in his ways. This is not the kind of
person that is best for the Peace Corps."
Another example of the lack of bureaucracy is evident in the
recruiting system, which sooner or later uses everyone in every
office for road trips to explain the Peace Corps to prospective
Volunteers.
"Instead of setting up a rigid system of trying to bring in new
people, we like to send out the people who really know the Peace
Corps to explain it to others," said the administrator.
Perhaps the most revealing glimpse into the free-wheeling
setup of the Peace Corps is the fact that the recruiting depart
ment doesn't recruit — it merely explains the Peace Corps to
those who arc interested in it.
"If we tried to sell the Peace Corps, we would be defeating
our own purpose," a recruiting official said. "The Peace Corps
by its very nature demands that its workers should be 'sold' on it
by its own merits — not by some high pressure sales from
Washington."

fight it," said one Washington office administrator. He attributed
these problems to the rapid growth of the Peace Corps.
The atmosphere in the Washington office is more like that of a
busy city room in a metropolitan newspaper plant than that of a
government department.
The work gets done, and lots of it, but it is done in a friendly,
informal atmosphere which enables departmental chiefs to work
alongside typists and secretaries without any thought of protocol.
The main reason for this refusal to become tied up in the
traditional red tape of the government is that about three-fourths
or more of the employees, according to one administrator, have
not been government workers previously.
Corresponding to this factor is the fact that most of the Peace
Corps people are around only for two or three years, then they
move on to other public jobs or back to private business. There
is no hard and fast rule decreeing that two years shall be the
length of service in the United States, just as it is overseas; but
that is the way the system works.
Another Washington official, with the Peace Corps two years,
put it this way:
"The Peace Corps, as a rule, is not something to make a career
of, but rather an ideal or dream with which to work while you
are fresh. After several years in any job, a person tends to
become entrenched and set in his ways. This is not the kind of
person that is best for the Peace Corps."
Another example of the lack of bureaucracy is evident in the
recruiting system, which sooner or later uses everyone in every
office for road trips to explain the Peace Corps to prospective
Volunteers.
"Instead of setting up a rigid system of trying to bring in new
people, we like to send out the people who really know the Peace
Corps to explain it to others," said the administrator.
Perhaps the most revealing glimpse into the free-wheeling
setup of the Peace Corps is the fact that the recruiting depart
ment doesn't recruit — it merely explains the Peace Corps to
those who arc interested in it.
"If we tried to sell the Peace Corps, we would be defeating
our own purpose," a recruiting official said. "The Peace Corps
by its very nature demands that its workers should be 'sold' on it
by its own merits — not by some high pressure sales from
Washington."
