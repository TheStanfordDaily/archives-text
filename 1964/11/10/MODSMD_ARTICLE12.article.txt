"Upon returning to the United
States, the Volunteer sees some
of the problems here that he wit
nessed abroad, but he doesn't
immediately see how he can do
anything about them," said Dr.
Joseph English, chief psychiatrist
with the Peace Corps.
"We don't want the returnees
to lose this restlessness, but
rather we hope they will be able
to use some of the knowledge
and skills they acquired overseas
to help alleviate some of the

problems facing this country,"
he said.
"The greatest adjustment for
the Volunteer when he gets over
seas is a psychological one," ex
plained Dr. English. "His life
can be filled with boredom, frus
tration and disappointment."
"Most Volunteers feel a deep
sense of depression after being
in the field about six months.
However, all but a few cheer up
in a short time and fill out their
two years of service," said Dr.
Joseph Col men, a psychologist
and deputy director of the Peace
Corps Division of Planning,
Evaluation and Research.
