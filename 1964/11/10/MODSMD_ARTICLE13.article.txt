# American Sacred Cow
## Peace Corps Stature Grows 
### 
In three years the Peace Corps
has become a fixture on the
world scene. Movie stars will
ingly donate their talents to pro
motion film clips, radio and tele
vision stations provide enormous
amounts of prime broadcast time
and even Congress casts an ap
proving smile at nearly everything
the Peace Corps does. In short,
the Peace Corps has become per
haps the most sacred of Amer
ica's sacred cows.
But it was not always that
way. In its early days, the Peace
Corps had more critics than
any governmental agency can
comfortably handle and more
troubles than any fledgling proj
ect deserves.
Anticipating the pitfalls, Pres
ident Kennedy put the project in
charge of his brother-in-law, Sar
gent Shriver, on the premise that
"It is easier to fire a relative than
a friend."
Even a simple thing such as
choosing a name caused no end
of consternation. On Nov. 2,
1960, the then Senator Kennedy
had proposed a peace corps in
a San Francisco campaign
speech. The name seemed a
natural, but advisors were criti
cal. The word "peace" had been
distorted by Communists, while
"corps" had a military stigma.
Back to Original
"We studied dozens of other
names and finally came back to
the original," Shriver recalled.
"Peace is the fundamental goal
of our times. We believed the
Peace Corps could contribute to
its attainment, for while arma
ments can deter war, only men
can create peace."
The stickiest question posed in
those early days was how Vol
unteers should act in event of
political crisis. Perhaps the most
succinct and straightforward an
swer came from Secretary of
State Dean Rusk, who said:
"The Peace Corps is not an in
strument of foreign policy, be
cause to make it so would rob it
of its contribution to foreign
policy."
The Corps has gone a long
way in adhering to this principle.
Current rules prohibit any per
son who has formerly engaged in
intelligence work from serving as
a Volunteer.
Conceived through a Presi
dential executive order in the
Spring, the Peace Corps took its
first official breath of life on Sep
tember 22, 1961. On October
22, it nearly took its last breath
of life, being felled by an inno
cent, but ill-timed, postcard from
Nigeria.
Describes Conditions
Twenty-three-year-old Mar
gery Michelmore penned a post
card to a friend in Massachu
setts, describing her amazement
at the squalid and filthy condi
tions prevalent in the country.
Anti-American candidates in a
student union election at the
University of Nigeria played the
comments for all they were
worth.

The Peace Corps weathered
the storm, though Miss Michel
more left the project and re
turned to the United States.
Today, the Nigerian project is
the largest operation in Africa
and the second largest in the
world, trailing Columbia by less
than 40 workers.
A misplaced postcard wasn't
the only menace to the in
fant Peace Corps in 1961. At
tacks of equal intensity emanated
from critics here at home. Many
skeptics viewed the new agency
as a haven for impractical ideal
ists, confused liberals and beat
niks. The "image" wasn't helped
very much by Shriver's refusal
to outlaw beards.
Saved Trouble Abroad
But while the initial stereotype
may have caused troubles at
home, it may very well have
saved trouble abroad. The Com
munists, expecting the Peace
Corps to collapse of its own
weight, launched vicious propa
ganda campaigns wherever the
Volunteers landed, but did very
little else. By the time they real
ized their mistake, it was too
late. The Peace Corps was firmly
entrenched and could not be
dislodged.
The Peace Corps still has an
"image" problem today, but not
the same one it had three years
ago. On the contrary, it is now
trying to play down its successes
rather than exploiting them.
Image Difficult
In the words of one distressed
Volunteer, "I am tired of being
considered a hero. It is too diffi
cult to live up to the image back
in the States."
While it is true that not all
Volunteers spend their days
sloshing through alligator-infest
ed swamps and their nights fight
ing oil tsetse flies, neither do
they while away their time danc

ing at embassy balls or sunning
themselves on the Riviera. They
live at a level comparable to
that of nationals doing the same
jobs in the countries where they
serve.
Strangely enough, though this
sometimes may mean working in
an air-conditioned office in the
heart of the capital city, most
Volunteers seem to prefer the
mud hut-alligator swamp treat
ment.
"They feel they are accom
plishing more," explained Dr.
Joseph Colmen, Peace Corps
psychologist.
Intangible Things
Just what has the Peace Corps
accomplished?
As with any application of the
human equation, the answer is
not easy to come by. The vari
ous news media emphasize the
number of school rooms built,
the number of acres plowed or
the number of bridges completed.
Returning Volunteers talk of
more subtle, more intangible
things. A significant, but not un
reasonably large, portion of the
returnees believe their so-called
"achievements" are non-existent.
President Johnson recently
praised the organization for re
versing Parkinson's Law. "As
the size of the Peace Corps has
gone up, its costs have come
down," he beamed.
Director Shrivcr, who has been
with the Corps since it was no
more than a gleam in his brother
in-law's eye, might view his
agency from any or all these per
spectives â€” and a few others
known only to him.
To date, however, the essence
of the Peace Corps has best been
described by a foreigner. In the
countryside of Iran, a Volunteer
was approached on Nov. 22 by
an Iranian co-worker who, tears
streaming from his eyes, an
nounced, "Our President is
dead."
