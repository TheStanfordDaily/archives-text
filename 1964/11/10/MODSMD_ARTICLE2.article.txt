# Peace Corps Growing As Fourth Year Starts
## 
### 
The future of the Peace Corps
looks bright regardless of which
candidate sits in the White House
in 1965.
Both candidates have publicly
supported the work of the Peace
Corps. Senator Goldwater, an
initial skeptic, has said, "At first
1 thought it would advance work
for a group of beatniks, but this
is not so . . . I'll back it all the
way."
President Johnson, an original
backer of the Peace Corps and
chairman of the Peace Corps
National Advisory Council, last
summer called for doubling the
size of the Corps.
"The nations of the world
want our young people. The
peoples of the world need our
young people. And surely a na
tion rich in goods and ideals can
provide young people," said the
President.
The Democratic platform spe
cifically calls for expansion of
the Peace Corps. Neither the
President in his speech nor the
platform presented any date by
which this expansion should be
completed.
Peace Corps legislation on the
Senate agenda calls for expan
sion of the Peace Corps to
14,000 by the end of next sum
mer, explained Nathaniel Davis,
deputy director of the Office of
Program Development and Op
erations.
Both Davis and Harris Wof
ford, associate director of the
Peace Corps in charge of Plan
ning, Evaluation and Research,

felt that, in the future, major
areas of work of the agency will
continue to be in teaching and
community development.
While Volunteers now teach
primarily in secondary schools,
both officials look for more Peace
Corps help at the primary and
college levels.
They both felt the Peace Corps
had learned in almost every
phase of its operations. Wof
ford cited a need for acquiring

more of the top students and
added that there is a shortage of
Volunteers who are interested in
the political process.
"Some of the training program
is too rigidly constructed for
some of the situations the Vol
unteers encounter," said Davis.
"We need to prepare Volunteers
for the unstructured situation
abroad."
"Requests from countries for
Peace Corps help are growing
and the number of Volunteers
is on the rise. We should meet
these interests with expanded
programs," he said.
Davis referred to the impact
of the Peace Corps on American
society.
"It is changing some of our
attitudes toward service and is
helping to make the orientation
to service more respectable on
the college campus."
Both officials said the Peace
Corps idea should bring foreign
visitors to the United States to
work in schools and community
improvement projects.
"A greater two-way movement
of peoples to and from America,
a 'Reverse Peace Corps for
America,' would be beneficial to
the U. S. and to other nations,"
Wofford said.
"The experience of actually
working here on American so
cial problems, helping and edu
cating Americans, should have a
profound impact on young lead
ers from developing nations.
They should return to their lands
with new ideas and new determi
nation," explained Wofford.

The future of the Peace Corps
looks bright regardless of which
candidate sits in the White House
in 1965.
Both candidates have publicly
supported the work of the Peace
Corps. Senator Goldwater, an
initial skeptic, has said, "At first
1 thought it would advance work
for a group of beatniks, but this
is not so . . . I'll back it all the
way."
President Johnson, an original
backer of the Peace Corps and
chairman of the Peace Corps
National Advisory Council, last
summer called for doubling the
size of the Corps.
"The nations of the world
want our young people. The
peoples of the world need our
young people. And surely a na
tion rich in goods and ideals can
provide young people," said the
President.
The Democratic platform spe
cifically calls for expansion of
the Peace Corps. Neither the
President in his speech nor the
platform presented any date by
which this expansion should be
completed.
Peace Corps legislation on the
Senate agenda calls for expan
sion of the Peace Corps to
14,000 by the end of next sum
mer, explained Nathaniel Davis,
deputy director of the Office of
Program Development and Op
erations.
Both Davis and Harris Wof
ford, associate director of the
Peace Corps in charge of Plan
ning, Evaluation and Research,

felt that, in the future, major
areas of work of the agency will
continue to be in teaching and
community development.
While Volunteers now teach
primarily in secondary schools,
both officials look for more Peace
Corps help at the primary and
college levels.
They both felt the Peace Corps
had learned in almost every
phase of its operations. Wof
ford cited a need for acquiring

more of the top students and
added that there is a shortage of
Volunteers who are interested in
the political process.
"Some of the training program
is too rigidly constructed for
some of the situations the Vol
unteers encounter," said Davis.
"We need to prepare Volunteers
for the unstructured situation
abroad."
"Requests from countries for
Peace Corps help are growing
and the number of Volunteers
is on the rise. We should meet
these interests with expanded
programs," he said.
Davis referred to the impact
of the Peace Corps on American
society.
"It is changing some of our
attitudes toward service and is
helping to make the orientation
to service more respectable on
the college campus."
Both officials said the Peace
Corps idea should bring foreign
visitors to the United States to
work in schools and community
improvement projects.
"A greater two-way movement
of peoples to and from America,
a 'Reverse Peace Corps for
America,' would be beneficial to
the U. S. and to other nations,"
Wofford said.
"The experience of actually
working here on American so
cial problems, helping and edu
cating Americans, should have a
profound impact on young lead
ers from developing nations.
They should return to their lands
with new ideas and new determi
nation," explained Wofford.
