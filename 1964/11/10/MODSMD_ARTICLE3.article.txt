# Staff Works For Volunteers
## 
### 
The Washington office of the
Peace Corps was described by
one administrator there as "just
a glorified support group for the
Volunteers in the field."
"The real work goes on out
there," he said, "so we don't like
to get too many big ideas about
ourselves here."
The structure of the Peace
Corps, then, is centered around
the Office of Program Develop
ment and Operations (PDO),
one of five offices within the
Peace Corps. It is headed by
Associate Director Warren Wig
gins.
PDO includes four world areas
in which Peace Corps Volunteers
are working. These are Latin
America, Far East, Africa and
North Africa-Near East-South
Asia (NANESA). Each area is
headed by a regional director.

Perhaps the second most im
portant segment of the Corps —
the Division of Recruitment —
is located in the Office of Public
Affairs. Besides recruiting, the
office also handles public infor
mation and advertising.
The recruiting duties are
looked upon as of prime impor
tance, because without new re
cruits there soon would be no
Peace Corps. All personnel in
all offices are expected to take
at least one rccruiting trip dur
ing the year.
Ten former Volunteers arc
the only full-time recruiters.
A third office is that of the
Peace Corps Volunteers, which
takes over where the recruiters
leave off. This office in turn is
divided into three areas — Se
lection, Training and Volunteer
Support.
The Selection division pro
cesses applications, checks Ques
tionnaires and invites applicants
who qualify to go through the
training proccss.

During training, the prospec
tive Volunteers undergo physical
training, instruction in a language
and practice in the work they will
be doing overseas. At this point,
trainees who do not qualify may
be "selected out" for various
reasons.
Volunteer Support arranges
for the Volunteers travel over
seas and to training sites, takes
care of their personnel needs,
publishes the Peace Corps news
letter and acquires materials
helpful to the Volunteers on
their job.
The fourth office is the Office
of Management, which includes
the divisions of Personnel, Bud
get and Finance and Manage
ment Services.
The fifth office is the Office
of Planning and Evaluation,
which among other things, docs
an annual evaluation of each
overseas project so that the Peace
Corps can benefit by any mis
takes that it may have made and
continue to do what has been
successful.

"Oh, missionaries are OK, I guess. But I like Peace
Corpsmev better—they always help us build the fire."
The Washington office of the
Peace Corps was described by
one administrator there as "just
a glorified support group for the
Volunteers in the field."
"The real work goes on out
there," he said, "so we don't like
to get too many big ideas about
ourselves here."
The structure of the Peace
Corps, then, is centered around
the Office of Program Develop
ment and Operations (PDO),
one of five offices within the
Peace Corps. It is headed by
Associate Director Warren Wig
gins.
PDO includes four world areas
in which Peace Corps Volunteers
are working. These are Latin
America, Far East, Africa and
North Africa-Near East-South
Asia (NANESA). Each area is
headed by a regional director.

Perhaps the second most im
portant segment of the Corps —
the Division of Recruitment —
is located in the Office of Public
Affairs. Besides recruiting, the
office also handles public infor
mation and advertising.
The recruiting duties are
looked upon as of prime impor
tance, because without new re
cruits there soon would be no
Peace Corps. All personnel in
all offices are expected to take
at least one rccruiting trip dur
ing the year.
Ten former Volunteers arc
the only full-time recruiters.
A third office is that of the
Peace Corps Volunteers, which
takes over where the recruiters
leave off. This office in turn is
divided into three areas — Se
lection, Training and Volunteer
Support.
The Selection division pro
cesses applications, checks Ques
tionnaires and invites applicants
who qualify to go through the
training proccss.

During training, the prospec
tive Volunteers undergo physical
training, instruction in a language
and practice in the work they will
be doing overseas. At this point,
trainees who do not qualify may
be "selected out" for various
reasons.
Volunteer Support arranges
for the Volunteers travel over
seas and to training sites, takes
care of their personnel needs,
publishes the Peace Corps news
letter and acquires materials
helpful to the Volunteers on
their job.
The fourth office is the Office
of Management, which includes
the divisions of Personnel, Bud
get and Finance and Manage
ment Services.
The fifth office is the Office
of Planning and Evaluation,
which among other things, docs
an annual evaluation of each
overseas project so that the Peace
Corps can benefit by any mis
takes that it may have made and
continue to do what has been
successful.
