# Staff Works For Volunteers
## 
### 
The Washington office of the
Peace Corps was described by
one administrator there as "just
a glorified support group for the
Volunteers in the field."
"The real work goes on out
there," he said, "so we don't like
to get too many big ideas about
ourselves here."
The structure of the Peace
Corps, then, is centered around
the Office of Program Develop
ment and Operations (PDO),
one of five offices within the
Peace Corps. It is headed by
Associate Director Warren Wig
gins.
PDO includes four world areas
in which Peace Corps Volunteers
are working. These are Latin
America, Far East, Africa and
North Africa-Near East-South
Asia (NANESA). Each area is
headed by a regional director.
