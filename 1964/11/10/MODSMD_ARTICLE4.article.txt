"Peace Corps . . . where is that?" asked an
incredulous Nepalese villager, unable to believe
the young man standing before him was "a
Westerner."
Though somewhat naive in approach, the Ne
palese was not so far wrong in asking "where"
rather than "what" the Peace Corps is. Since the
American variety was inaugurated in 1961,
some 18 other similar corps have sprung up in
countries all over the world. The fever has
become so intense that 14 more nations cur
rently have peace corps plans in the works,
including ambitious little Liechtenstein, with a
population of less than 17,000.
Foreign peace corps fall naturally into two
categories, depending on the internal needs and
fiscal resources of the country. Industrial na
tions of western Europe and elsewhere, as in the
United States, are sending volunteers abroad.
Those nations with workers currently in the field
include The Netherlands, West Germany, Nor
way, Great Britain, France, Switzerland, Den
mark, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
Countries such as Peru, Fl Salvador, Northern
Rhodesia, Tanganyika, Kenya, Malawi and
the Philippines use their volunteers for internal
development, often working in conjunction with
American Peace Corps Volunteers.

Foreign peace corps differ from the American
version in other rcspects, particularly in size,
length of training programs and administrative
support.
France, typical of the foreign ventures, had
75 volunteers in the field, as of June, with plans
to add 175 more by the end of the year. North
ern Rhodesia, concentrating on internal develop
ment and an unemployment problem, is shoot
ing for a goal of 3,000 in the field by 1965,
with hopes of eventually building a force of
50,000.
Industrial nations, drawing heavily on skilled
and professional volunteers, have often cut the
American training period of 10-12 weeks in
half. Britain's Committee for Service Overseas,
an intermediary body between private volunteer
organizations and the British government, has
broken all records by running training programs
as short as seven days.
Burgeoning efforts by other countries to
create and strengthen their own peace corps are
currently being aided by the International Secre
tariat for Volunteer Service. Born in 1962
under the aegis of the U. S. Peace Corps, the
Secretariat, although quartered in the Peace
Corps Building in Washington, is a separate
entitv.
