# Peace Corps Gives Personal Touch to Selection Process
## 
### 
The Peace Corps selection
process amounts to an assembly
line with the personal touch.
Once a prospective trainee has
proven his stamina by complet
ing the 123-item Questionnaire,
the selection team begins the
long, trying task of selecting a
Peace Corps Volunteer.
Frank Erwin, director of re
cruiting operations, stresses that
the job of the selection team is
"to select men and women into
the Peace Corps, not to select
them out. We don't want this
process to take on a negative
outlook."
After the Questionnaire ar
rives in Washington its 12 pages
are carefully read and only the
obviously unqualified applicants
are dropped. The number drop
ped at this point is about 10 per
cent. Such applicants are usual
ly dropped for filing incomplete
Questionnaires or because the
applicant is not a citizen or has
dependents under 18.
All information concerning a
prospective Volunteer is put on
a computer tape. Any later
information is added so the

Peace Corps can keep a com
plete file on each Volunteer.
After this initial screening, the
selection team sends out 12 to
15 reference forms. "Those who
complete the Peace Corps
forms," says Erwin, "are com
pletely honest and sincere."
"People recognize the serious
ness of sending others overseas
to represent the United States,"
he says.
After the applicant processing
has been completed, suitability
screening begins. Both the Ques
tionnaire and the references are
reviewed again and suitability
ratings are assigned.
These suitability ratings are a
"prediction of success," and
score an applicant on a point
system of one to five. A score
of three or better is necessary for
the process to continue.
The average trainee rates a
three, which is a sign he has the
basic qualifications. Candidates
who score a four show a high
amount of promise, while the
uncommon ones who score a five
practically are "shoo-ins."

Once the suitability screening
has been completed, classifica
tion begins so that the Peace
Corps can "find the best assign
ment for the person and the best
person for the assignment."
All of the candidate's capabili
ties are fed into a computer with
the requirements for a specific
assignment overseas. Included
with the requirements are what
we know as "highly desired" and
"desired" characteristics. These
three items are used as a basis
for scoring, on a zero to two
range. The average score is be
tween 1.5 and 1.8.
The machine then "nominates"
candidates to serve at a specific
post. Both Erwin and other offi
cials are quick to point out that
the computer merely nominates,
it does not judge. All decisions
are made by the selection team.
Many Decline Training
Those selected are then invited
to train. Because of the amount
of time spent in selection, many
candidates have changed their
plans due to other commitments,
marriage or simply a reconsider
ation of the sacrifice involved.
About 45 per cent of those invi
ted turn the offer down.
The trainee must then fill out
a form dealing with his back
ground. This form is investigated
by the Civil Service Commission,
which checks the places where
trainees have lived, worked, gone
to school, etc.
The trainee then travels to one
of the college training centers.
"Up to now," Erwin says, "every
thing has been on paper. At the
training center we get our first
look at the Volunteer. We look
so much that he's literally in a
goldfish bowl."
At the training center, a field
selection officer, a field assess
ment officer and other members
of the selection board participate
in the final process. The training
project director is also a partici
pant in the board's deliberations.
Other members of the board
include a staff member from the
country to which the Volunteers
will go, a medical doctor, a psy
chiatrist and members of the uni
versity training site faculty.
After the first five or six weeks
of training, the board meets and
studies what is now a relatively
complete picture of the trainee.
Final Rating
The trainee is rated again, this
time on a one to six rating scale.
A one is dropped and a two is
postponed. A three is deemed
not suitable for the particular
post and may be transferred. The
other patterns are the same as
before — a four is average, a five
has good potential and a six has
his foot in the door.
The board meets once again at
the end of the training stint. It
makes its final decision — the
trainee goes or he does not go.
The fruits of the trainees' labors
are generally good. Some 82 per
cent of those who make it this far
are sent overseas.

of the college training centers.
"Up to now," Erwin says, "every
thing has been on paper. At the
training center we get our first
look at the Volunteer. We look
so much that he's literally in a
goldfish bowl."
At the training center, a field
selection officer, a field assess
ment officer and other members
of the selection board participate
in the final process. The training
project director is also a partici
pant in the board's deliberations.
Other members of the board
include a staff member from the
country to which the Volunteers
will go, a medical doctor, a psy
chiatrist and members of the uni
versity training site faculty.
After the first five or six weeks
of training, the board meets and
studies what is now a relatively
complete picture of the trainee.
Final Rating
The trainee is rated again, this
time on a one to six rating scale.
A one is dropped and a two is
postponed. A three is deemed
not suitable for the particular
post and may be transferred. The
other patterns are the same as
before — a four is average, a five
has good potential and a six has
his foot in the door.
The board meets once again at
the end of the training stint. It
makes its final decision — the
trainee goes or he does not go.
The fruits of the trainees' labors
are generally good. Some 82 per
cent of those who make it this far
are sent overseas.
The Peace Corps selection
process amounts to an assembly
line with the personal touch.
Once a prospective trainee has
proven his stamina by complet
ing the 123-item Questionnaire,
the selection team begins the
long, trying task of selecting a
Peace Corps Volunteer.
Frank Erwin, director of re
cruiting operations, stresses that
the job of the selection team is
"to select men and women into
the Peace Corps, not to select
them out. We don't want this
process to take on a negative
outlook."
After the Questionnaire ar
rives in Washington its 12 pages
are carefully read and only the
obviously unqualified applicants
are dropped. The number drop
ped at this point is about 10 per
cent. Such applicants are usual
ly dropped for filing incomplete
Questionnaires or because the
applicant is not a citizen or has
dependents under 18.
All information concerning a
prospective Volunteer is put on
a computer tape. Any later
information is added so the

Peace Corps can keep a com
plete file on each Volunteer.
After this initial screening, the
selection team sends out 12 to
15 reference forms. "Those who
complete the Peace Corps
forms," says Erwin, "are com
pletely honest and sincere."
"People recognize the serious
ness of sending others overseas
to represent the United States,"
he says.
After the applicant processing
has been completed, suitability
screening begins. Both the Ques
tionnaire and the references are
reviewed again and suitability
ratings are assigned.
These suitability ratings are a
"prediction of success," and
score an applicant on a point
system of one to five. A score
of three or better is necessary for
the process to continue.
The average trainee rates a
three, which is a sign he has the
basic qualifications. Candidates
who score a four show a high
amount of promise, while the
uncommon ones who score a five
practically are "shoo-ins."

Once the suitability screening
has been completed, classifica
tion begins so that the Peace
Corps can "find the best assign
ment for the person and the best
person for the assignment."
All of the candidate's capabili
ties are fed into a computer with
the requirements for a specific
assignment overseas. Included
with the requirements are what
we know as "highly desired" and
"desired" characteristics. These
three items are used as a basis
for scoring, on a zero to two
range. The average score is be
tween 1.5 and 1.8.
The machine then "nominates"
candidates to serve at a specific
post. Both Erwin and other offi
cials are quick to point out that
the computer merely nominates,
it does not judge. All decisions
are made by the selection team.
Many Decline Training
Those selected are then invited
to train. Because of the amount
of time spent in selection, many
candidates have changed their
plans due to other commitments,
marriage or simply a reconsider
ation of the sacrifice involved.
About 45 per cent of those invi
ted turn the offer down.
The trainee must then fill out
a form dealing with his back
ground. This form is investigated
by the Civil Service Commission,
which checks the places where
trainees have lived, worked, gone
to school, etc.
The trainee then travels to one
of the college training centers.

uncommon ones who score a five
practically are "shoo-ins."

Once the suitability screening
has been completed, classifica
tion begins so that the Peace
Corps can "find the best assign
ment for the person and the best
person for the assignment."
All of the candidate's capabili
ties are fed into a computer with
the requirements for a specific
assignment overseas. Included
with the requirements are what
we know as "highly desired" and
"desired" characteristics. These
three items are used as a basis
for scoring, on a zero to two
range. The average score is be
tween 1.5 and 1.8.
The machine then "nominates"
candidates to serve at a specific
post. Both Erwin and other offi
cials are quick to point out that
the computer merely nominates,
it does not judge. All decisions
are made by the selection team.

Those selected are then invited
to train. Because of the amount
of time spent in selection, many
candidates have changed their
plans due to other commitments,
marriage or simply a reconsider
ation of the sacrifice involved.
About 45 per cent of those invi
ted turn the offer down.
The trainee must then fill out
a form dealing with his back
ground. This form is investigated
by the Civil Service Commission,
which checks the places where
trainees have lived, worked, gone
to school, etc.
The trainee then travels to one
of the college training centers.
"Up to now," Erwin says, "every
thing has been on paper. At the
training center we get our first
look at the Volunteer. We look
so much that he's literally in a
goldfish bowl."
At the training center, a field
selection officer, a field assess
ment officer and other members
of the selection board participate
in the final process. The training
project director is also a partici
pant in the board's deliberations.
Other members of the board
include a staff member from the
country to which the Volunteers
will go, a medical doctor, a psy
chiatrist and members of the uni
versity training site faculty.
After the first five or six weeks
of training, the board meets and
studies what is now a relatively
complete picture of the trainee.
Final Rating
The trainee is rated again, this
time on a one to six rating scale.
A one is dropped and a two is
postponed. A three is deemed
not suitable for the particular
post and may be transferred. The
other patterns are the same as
before — a four is average, a five
has good potential and a six has
his foot in the door.
The board meets once again at
the end of the training stint. It
makes its final decision — the
trainee goes or he does not go.
The fruits of the trainees' labors
are generally good. Some 82 per
cent of those who make it this far
are sent overseas.
The Peace Corps selection
process amounts to an assembly
line with the personal touch.
Once a prospective trainee has
proven his stamina by complet
ing the 123-item Questionnaire,
the selection team begins the
long, trying task of selecting a
Peace Corps Volunteer.
Frank Erwin, director of re
cruiting operations, stresses that
the job of the selection team is
"to select men and women into
the Peace Corps, not to select
them out. We don't want this
process to take on a negative
outlook."
After the Questionnaire ar
rives in Washington its 12 pages
are carefully read and only the
obviously unqualified applicants
are dropped. The number drop
ped at this point is about 10 per
cent. Such applicants are usual
ly dropped for filing incomplete
Questionnaires or because the
applicant is not a citizen or has
dependents under 18.
All information concerning a
prospective Volunteer is put on
a computer tape. Any later
information is added so the

Peace Corps can keep a com
plete file on each Volunteer.
After this initial screening, the
selection team sends out 12 to
15 reference forms. "Those who
complete the Peace Corps
forms," says Erwin, "are com
pletely honest and sincere."
"People recognize the serious
ness of sending others overseas
to represent the United States,"
he says.
After the applicant processing
has been completed, suitability
screening begins. Both the Ques
tionnaire and the references are
reviewed again and suitability
ratings are assigned.
These suitability ratings are a
"prediction of success," and
score an applicant on a point
system of one to five. A score
of three or better is necessary for
the process to continue.
The average trainee rates a
three, which is a sign he has the
basic qualifications. Candidates
who score a four show a high
amount of promise, while the
uncommon ones who score a five
practically are "shoo-ins."
