# Peace Corps Training: 'A Miracle'
## 
### 
Teach over 40 languages —
some of which have never been
parts of formal instruction pro
grams in the United States . . .
develop complete training pro
grams with as little advance no
tice as 10 days . . . prepare a
Volunteer for overseas service in
12 weeks.
"A miracle," said Dr. John
Groebli, deputy director. Divi
sion of Training, in describing
the success of the Peace Corps
training program.
The Peace Corps works with
more than SO colleges and uni
versities in the United States.
Puerto Rico and the Virgin Is
lands and 10 private agencies to
prepare Volunteers for two years
of service in 46 nations.
Custom-Designed
"Every program is custom
designed on the basis of the in
dividual involved and the type
of job he will perform in his
assigned country," explained Dr.
Groebli.

The Peace Corps designs its
training programs with the idea
that the Volunteer must be tech
nically, physically, intellectually,
socially and psychologically pre
pared.
60 Hours a \V eek
Basic training is usually con
ducted in this country and lasts
from eight to twelve weeks. The
normal training week consists of
60 scheduled hours—lo hours
a day for a six-day week. This
includes some planned study
time.
The university training pro
gram includes:
• Technical Studies — The
trainee acquires the technical

and academic skills needed for
the type of work he will perform
overseas.
• Language Training — In
struction averages five hours
daily.
• Area Studies—The trainee
gains a background in the cul
ture in which he will work.
• American Studies — The
trainee receives a refresher
course in the geography, history
and institutions of the United
States.
• World Affairs — A back
ground in contemporary world
affairs is obtained.
• Health and Medical Train
ing— This course teaches a
trainee to protect himself and to

help improve the health condi
tions in the host country through
health education.
• Physical Training and Rec
reation — This course is de
signed to assure the trainee of
his physical capacity to perform
his assigned task and provides
him with basic recreational
knowledge and skills.
e Peace Corps Service—The
trainee learns of the purpose,
philosophy and various pro
grams of the Peace Corps.
A small portion of Volunteers
then goes into 26 days of field
training. This affords the oppor
tunity for testing and improving
the linguistic, technical, informa
tional, physical and social skills

required of the trainee's assign
ment.
To encourage confidence in
the Volunteer, he is confronted
with a program of physical con
ditioning, rock-climbing, swim
ming, map-reading, hiking and
outdoor living.
Closing out the field training
preparation is an opportunity for
the prospective Volunteer to per
form his assigned task under
conditions approximating those
he will confront abroad. This
course lasts from one to two
weeks.
Dr. Groebli pointed out that
there have been some miscon
ceptions about the physical
training undergone by Volun
teers. He stressed that all such
programs are geared to the
trainee's age and physical con
dition.
"The majority of trainees
never go through the outward
bound training phase which in
volves more strenous activities
like rock-climbing. Only those
whose assignment overseas calls
for such training receive it," said
Dr. Groebli.
Before entering the field, the
Volunteer spends one to two
weeks of orientation in the host
country.
