# Agency Has Three Goals
## 
### 
What are the purposes of the
Peace Corps? What are the goals
of the Volunteers in the field?
There are three broad guide
lines by which the Peace Corps
governs its operations, said Na
thaniel Davis, deputy director of
the Office of Program Develop
ment and Operation, which ad
ministers operations in the field.
The general aims of the Peace
Corps are:
To provide skilled manpower
for developing countries which
request help.
To contribute to the under
standing abroad of the United
States and its people and
To send Americans abroad so
they may learn about the peoples
of other nations and spread this
understanding in the United States
upon their return.
"We don't just blindly accept
an invitation to go to a country,"
Davis said. "There has to be a
commitment on the part of the
nation which invites the Peace
Corps."
"This decision on where to
send a Volunteer is not purely
scientific," Davis said. He pointed
(Hit that the Volunteer's basic
needs such as shelter and health
facilities have to be taken care of.
And before any Volunteers arc
sent into an area, the Peace Corps
representative must check with
local or tribal leaders and with
governmental officials of the
country.
As for the functions of Volun
teers, Davis emphasized that
they arc not supposed to be "ad
visors" but workers. Their work
should be a catalyst for change
in a community.
"1 he Peace Corps shouldn't
have to supply a lot of equip
ment and machinery," Davis
said. "We're in the business of
supplying people, not machines."
