# Volunteers Being Recruited From New, Varied Sources

### 
The Peace Corps is looking for
workers ranging from university
science professors to secretaries
to young farmers who may never
have gone to college.
To prevent the Peace Corps
from becoming an organization
made up solely of liberal arts
graduates, Director Sargent Shri
ver recently appointed a task force
to develop ways for the agency
to become more representative of
the American people.
Arts (irads Needed
At the top of list from other
nations arc requests for doctors,
nurses, math and science teachers
and agriculture experts. But also
much in demand are liberal arts
graduates who don't have one
particular skill, senior citizens
who would like to contribute two
years to helping others and gen
eral "handymen '
The recruiting efforts to date
have been geared closely to col
lege campuses and will continue

to be so, since the overwhelming
majority of Volunteers are recent
college graduates. But there will
he a corresponding recruiting
effort made in industrial plants,
; junior colleges and labor conven
tions.
Ken Coffey, special assistant
in the Peace Corps Recruiting
Offce, said the following types of
non-college Volunteers would be
sought:
• The "practical agriculturist"
who could wc r k in rural com
munity development projects.
• Secretaries who could work
in Peace Corps offices overseas.
• Skilled workers who could
teach lesser skilled workers either
in vocational programs or in on
the-job training programs.
• "General handymen" who
could work in machine shops
doing a wide range of mechan
ical jobs.
• Senior citizens who, although
having retired, would be inter

ested in contributing their exper
1 icnce for two years in whatever
field they may be skilled.
• Intelligent young men and
women who, although they do not
have a degree, are the "common
sense" type needed for commun
ity development programs.
"We need the kind of Volun
teer who can go into a community,
see what problems exist, and
work them out," one official ex
plained. "The Volunteer doesn't
have to have a special interest,
hut simply the ability to get along
with people and to get them or
ganized to work out solutions."
Volunteer Type
These Volunteers might be the
type who, while on campus, had
been precinct workers for politi
cal parties, volunteers for tutor
ial projects or civil rights wor
kers, he said.
"They should be the free
wheeling type and should be well
organized." he concluded.
