The Key
To a Happy Life
What is the key to happiness? Happiness is not found in
pleasure alone, for Lord Byron, famous for his flamboyant
ways, once said, "The worm, the canker, and the grief are
mine." Happiness can not be found in money, for more than
one of the most famous American millionaires has said, "I
suppose I am the most miserable man on earth." Happiness
cannot be found in fame, for Lord Beaconsfield said, "Youth
is a mistake, manhood is a struggle, and old age is a regret."
Happiness cannot be found in military success or glory, for
Alexander the Great, having conquered the known world of
his day, is reported to have wept in his tent, "There are no more
worlds left to conquer." And happines cannot be found in god
lessness, for Voltaire said; "I wish I had never been born."
Americans spent millions in pursuit of happiness today,
but instead of achieving their goal, there is recurring defeat.
Instead of peace and rest, there is turmoil, fear, and uncertainty
because people are looking in the wrong places. True peace
and joy can never be found apart from God. And the only
way to establish a personal relationship with God is through
Jesus Christ. Christ said, "I am the Way, the Truth, and the
Life —no one comes unto the Father but by Me." (John 14.6).
This is the key to happiness! When a person accepts Jesus
Christ as Lord and Savior, he is born-again (a spiritual birth
from God) and he receives the abundant provisions God has
made for the pleasure and welfare of those who love Him.
Jesus said: I am the door: by Me if any man enter in he shall
be saved, and shall go in and find pasture." (John 10:9)
God's love and salvation cire available to all, a free gift
from God to man. Why not invite Him into your life today?
Christ said, "I am come that you might have life, and that
you might have it more abundantly . . . ask and you shall
receive, that your joy may be full." (John 16:24)
