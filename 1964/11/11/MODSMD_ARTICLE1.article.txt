• India Struck By Hunger
NEW DELHI, India Special trains sped
food southward last night toward Kerala
State, a Communist stronghold hard hit by
the hunger that troubles much of India.
A food rationing scheme instituted in Ke

rala by Prime Minister Lai Bahadur Shastri's
government was in ruins.
Shastri sought to pacify roving mobs of
looters who attacked government officials
and raided storehouses for rice and wheat.
But food was not arriving fast enough
for the mobs. For the second consecutive
day, they stoned policemen in Kerala's capital,
Trivandrum, and — at times 1,500 strong
marched through the streets shouting "We
want rice!"
Shastri, speaking in nearby Madras State,
ordered the government railway system to
give top priority to food shipments to Kerala.
• SIOO Billion Budget Seen
JOHNSON SITY, Tex. — President John
son sized up preliminary figures with Secre
tary of Defense Robert M. McNamara yester
day and saw a good chance of holding the next
defense budget below $50 billion.
If this can bo accomplished, the prospects
of keeping the entire federal budget to less

than $100 billion for the second year in a row
will be increased substantially.
Johnson conferred with McNamara pri
marily on the defense budget and with Secre
tary of State Dean Rusk on a broad sweep
of international affairs.
McNamara told newsmen that the later
session, extending through the lunch hour,
ranged over international issues including
South Viet Nam.
The defense secretary said things look a
little more favorable in South Viet Nam and
there are "no plans to send further combat
divisions" there, but it will be "many years
in the future" before the goal of freedom and
independence is assured for that Far Eastern
nation.
