# Author Attacks Big Govt.
## Dos Passos Airs Rightist Viewpoint 
### DOUG OHMANS 
John Dos Passos last night dis
missed the idea of analyzing the
election's implications because
"it is really too early to tell."
For over an hour, Stern Hall's
famous guest-in-residenee gave
conservative answers to questions
from the many liberals in the au
dience.
DOS PASSOS was concerned
with the trend in the United
States toward big government. He
cited the "law of diminishing re
turns in bureaucratic manage
ment" as one reason why Ameri
can government needs "a house
cleaning by new management."
"Barry Goldwater would have
made an able President," said Dos
Passos, "but he could hardly have
beaten Johnson when times were
so good." Johnson had great con
trol over major economic blocs.
And lie used Roosevelt's "wonder
ful system of tax, tax, tax; spend,
spend, spend; elect, elect, elect."
This system, said Dos Passos,
has led to "a terrific deteriora
tion in production of various
areas of government," to tli e
point where "there is more racket
connected with our social pro
grams than advantage." Citing
agricultural subsidies as an ex
ample, Dos Passos staled that
"there are departments in gov
ernment which could be dropped
with no one harmed but the em
ployees."
THK ORIGINAL conceptions of
government agencies have de
veloped into inefficient bureau
cracies, he said.
The question of civil rights in
evitably arose, and Dos Passos'
advice to the activists was to "go
easy." "1 am in favor of civil
rights," he said, "but I have al
ways hated racial antagonism.
. . . I don't think that federal in
tervention is going to be as suc
cessful as many think. You have
to go gradually."
DOS PASSOS argued that it is
usually best to wait until citi
zens get excited enough about a
problem to get their local govern
ment to solve it. Citizens, how
ever. are apathetic. "The Ameri
can public shows no interest at
all in whiat happens in Vietnam
or Cuba," he said. "And even the
Negroes in Virginia show no real
desire to integrate the school
system."
"The general tendency of forc
ing schools to integrate is that
the quality of instruction goes
down. ... It would be better to
let Southern integration ease
along as it is. . . . After all," said
Dos Passos, "anyone who doesn't
like it can move."

can public shows no interest at
all in whiat happens in Vietnam
or Cuba," he said. "And even the
Negroes in Virginia show no real
desire to integrate the school
system."
"The general tendency of forc
ing schools to integrate is that
the quality of instruction goes
down. ... It would be better to
let Southern integration ease
along as it is. . . . After all," said
Dos Passos, "anyone who doesn't
like it can move."
John Dos Passos last night dis
missed the idea of analyzing the
election's implications because
"it is really too early to tell."
For over an hour, Stern Hall's
famous guest-in-residenee gave
conservative answers to questions
from the many liberals in the au
dience.
DOS PASSOS was concerned
with the trend in the United
States toward big government. He
cited the "law of diminishing re
turns in bureaucratic manage
ment" as one reason why Ameri
can government needs "a house
cleaning by new management."
"Barry Goldwater would have
made an able President," said Dos
Passos, "but he could hardly have
beaten Johnson when times were
so good." Johnson had great con
trol over major economic blocs.
And lie used Roosevelt's "wonder
ful system of tax, tax, tax; spend,
spend, spend; elect, elect, elect."
This system, said Dos Passos,
has led to "a terrific deteriora
tion in production of various
areas of government," to tli e
point where "there is more racket
connected with our social pro
grams than advantage." Citing
agricultural subsidies as an ex
ample, Dos Passos staled that
"there are departments in gov
ernment which could be dropped
with no one harmed but the em
ployees."
THK ORIGINAL conceptions of
government agencies have de
veloped into inefficient bureau
cracies, he said.
The question of civil rights in
evitably arose, and Dos Passos'
advice to the activists was to "go
easy." "1 am in favor of civil
rights," he said, "but I have al
ways hated racial antagonism.
. . . I don't think that federal in
tervention is going to be as suc
cessful as many think. You have
to go gradually."
DOS PASSOS argued that it is
usually best to wait until citi
zens get excited enough about a
problem to get their local govern
ment to solve it. Citizens, how
ever. are apathetic. "The Ameri
can public shows no interest at
all in whiat happens in Vietnam
