# Cal Revenges Itself; Bell Takes A Trip

### 
IJC'RF lias retaliated and the gods of Stanford and Cal have
spoken.
One of four bells in tin* Old Bell Tower behind Memorial
Church was carried away by parties unknown Monday night.
The surviving" three, under fresh coats of telltale blue and gold
paint, point to a midnight raid by USRF.
Meanwhile, hack at the campus, ASSII President Scott Mr-
Bride and Charlie Powell, president of the Cal student body,
have issued the following joint, open letter to the students of
the two universities:
As Big Game approaches, many students at the Univer
sity of California and at Stanford turn their thoughts to
ingenious and sometimes less than ingenious pranks. Well
aware that these activities are annual occurrences, we ad
dress this letter to our respective student bodies, wishing
to inform them of our opinions, and. as best we can, the
opinions of our student judicial councils.
The weeks before the Big Game do not constitute an
open season for assault, battery, or vandalism, nor is mis
guided school spirit a basis for pardon. It should be obvious
that property damage or personal injury of any sort is
inexcusable. Nol so obvious is that many innocently con
ceived pranks lead to unforeseen and reprehensible results.
This statement is in no way intended to be a legal posi
sition but only an appeal to students to make their own
decisions about these matters in a rational manner. We
appeal to you to look before you leap and to think before
you act.
s SCOTT McBRIDE and CHARLIE POWELL
