# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## Referees Outperform 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Sportswriters are greedy for good copy material, and if the In
dians' fourth quarter come-from-behind exploits Saturday had pro
duced a victory against the Trojans, the keyboard of my typewriter
would have been a flurry of inspired fingers. The heroes would
have been obvious: True-blood Indian Dave Lewis, who didn't call i
his own smoke-signals, but did an excellent job of executing them,!
led the Cards to their only TD and might have got the winning score !
except several scouting parties were ambushed by the Trojans.
And there's Stanford's "Big D," hereafter to be known as "Chap
pie's Congregation." Jack Chappie, whether he was chasing SC
halfbacks on end sweeps and needless to say hauling them down,
blocking passes, stopping plays up the middle, or covering passes,
was the outstanding lineman on the field. He picked up lineman of
the game honors for the third time this year.
Gary Pettigrew was another on the defense that limited the Tro-1
jans to one first down in the second half. Playing his best game of i
the year, he consistently knifed through the SC line from his right
defensive end position to dump an assortment of Trojan backs run
ning his way.
However, Stanford lost. The team engaged itself in defensive
trench combat and won most crucial battles. But whenever the Cards
tried to mount an offensive, either the refs of the war games flagged
them down or they gave to charity. Billy Mitchell advocates had
their say and the Indians went to the air and goi their only touch
down.
On the question of refs. . . . For important games, referees feel
they have to put on a show. They become performers and only inci
dentally pay attention to the action on the field. They assume the
role of marchers when they pace off the penalties. They imagine
themselves as heroic semaphore operators as they majestically sig
nal illegalities observed, and lastly they play the roles of bullfighters
in the classic tradition through the clever manipulation of their red
flags.
An SC player calls "hike," prompting Carl Schrader to center
the ball prematurely. Is a 15-yarder assessed against SC as it should
be? No, Stanford loses the ball on a fumble caused by the charging
Trojan line. Earlier in the game, the refs incorrectly explained a
penalty situation to field goal holder Dick Berg, who because of the
illegal tackle was in no condition to understand it anyway. Did Stan
ford get the ball first and ten on the 11? No, it got three points
which turned out to be insignificant.
