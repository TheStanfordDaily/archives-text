## Stanford's Football Tradition: A Remnant Of Ages Long Past 
### ART FISHER 
Breathes there an Indian
With soul so dead
That he longs not
To singe the hair
From a Sponsor's legs,
And set first torch,
In dark, unknown,
To the Freshman Bonfire?
—Scurrillus
To the uninitiated, this must seem a period of
gala festivity.
Happy boys and girls erect twenty-foot savages
of uninflammable crepe and facial tissue on the
sunny lawns. Old alums eagerly return to relive
the studly successes that always are worthier
long afterwards. At least one scholar becomes
Red-Hot Prof, while the others presumably glow
lukewarm on the sidelines.
Midterms past, finals still comfortably around
the corner, Stanford students seem immersed in
a traditional American ritual. Beat Cal!
Pari Of 'Stanford Education'
So it all must seem to the outsider. Tragically
for the believers, it is not so simple. For this is
not merely a period of gushing gayety, of com
pelling music and the cleanest exotic dancing in
America. For many, this is an integral aspect of
that continuing process of self-illumination, the
Stanford education.
We are now celebrating our annual, autumnal
psychological debacle, when the Stanford commu
nity must face afresh the reasons for continuing
the Big Game tradition.
In short, why football? Why Cal? Why cheer
leaders? Why care?
Elaborate and accurate motivational explana
tions of these rites are doubtlessly available. That
these might receive widespread admission to the
conventional wisdom is unlikely. For one thing,
such theories are probably overwhelmingly un
flattering.
Komnant Of Ages Past
Besides, everybody already has his own theory.
However else Stanford students may be damnable,
they are universally bright. Even to the most
apple-cheeked of the enthusiastic, it must some
time occur that the football spectacle is a rem
nant of ages long past, a holdover from the days
of such psychological delights as bathtub gin,
the Rough Riders, and naive girls.
Intrespectively, students question themselves.
Sadistically, they question others.
We have long since abandoned the swallow-the
whole-pie-on-faith ethic of our forebears. Even
as he eagerly joins in the fun, today's Stanford
student knows he is slightly ridiculous; he knows
he is servant and not master of his impulses. He
tries to explain himself. These attempts at justi

fying our continued participation in the Big Game
Tradition are a signifcant aspect of a Fall Quarter
education at Stanford.
Why?
Why do we do it? Is it as an outlet for frustra
tions and energy bottled too long? Do we scream
"Blood!" as an alternative to drawing a little?
Competition is involved too. Most of us would
push a potato two miles with our nose, if we
could beat somebody at it and eke out a little
respect.
Self-adulation grips us. If one were to arise
every three minutes and bellow his own name lie
might well be put away. Encoding his name as
"Stanford" protects him. That all have Ihe same
code seems to perturb few.
Who would tamper with tradition? How is to
day's student to have a flavorful Stanford ex
perience ,how is he to grasp the sweet quintes
sence of Farm life without partaking of this old
and colorful Festival?
Mississippi vs. Paper Folding-
Young men and women toss and turn in their
dorm bunks, a haunting insomnia of doubt pur- j
suing them. Why do they go to Mississippi? Did
I fold enough paper begonias? Am I doing my !
duty?
One can find uppcrclassmen who eschewed all
this as freshmen, who now wish sadly that they
had let themselves go then. The pitiless confines
of maturity prevent their participating now. It
looks so free and beautiful and enjoyable, a good
way to meet a lot of kids and joke and laugh and
have a good time. Does it matter at all whether i
or not the whole thing is for real? Isn't one pre
text for a social gathering about as good as an
other? Not unlike charades.
School Spirit
Some even maintain that such affairs preserve)
"school spirit," a vital ingredient in any "good"
school. Nothing makes you crack that Civ like
knowing that your blockbusters are the roughest
and the toughest. Pride in one's school iscssen
tial.
Regardless of his personal feelings, no rational
being would ever anticipate Stanford dumping the
Big Game. One can only hope for an increasing i
sophistication of the justifications.
For a variety of reasons, we appear to need a
football tradition at Stanford. Let us recognize
that need, tempering loyalty with honesty.
Indeed, to the uninitiated, it may well appear!
that this fall Stanford is engaged in one of the;
best aspects of American college life. The hidden
truth of that statement should be profoundly en
couraging, at least consoling. Such a truth should
be zealously guarded lest a disillusioned alumni
abandon us, leaving Stanford an indigent, abject
shell of its former upholstered self.

Mississippi vs. Paper Folding-
Young men and women toss and turn in their
dorm bunks, a haunting insomnia of doubt pur- j
suing them. Why do they go to Mississippi? Did
I fold enough paper begonias? Am I doing my !
duty?
One can find uppcrclassmen who eschewed all
this as freshmen, who now wish sadly that they
had let themselves go then. The pitiless confines
of maturity prevent their participating now. It
looks so free and beautiful and enjoyable, a good
way to meet a lot of kids and joke and laugh and
have a good time. Does it matter at all whether i
or not the whole thing is for real? Isn't one pre
text for a social gathering about as good as an
other? Not unlike charades.
School Spirit
Some even maintain that such affairs preserve)
"school spirit," a vital ingredient in any "good"
school. Nothing makes you crack that Civ like
knowing that your blockbusters are the roughest
and the toughest. Pride in one's school iscssen
tial.
Regardless of his personal feelings, no rational

Big Game. One can only hope for an increasing i

For a variety of reasons, we appear to need a
football tradition at Stanford. Let us recognize
that need, tempering loyalty with honesty.
Indeed, to the uninitiated, it may well appear!
that this fall Stanford is engaged in one of the;
best aspects of American college life. The hidden
truth of that statement should be profoundly en
couraging, at least consoling. Such a truth should
be zealously guarded lest a disillusioned alumni
abandon us, leaving Stanford an indigent, abject
shell of its former upholstered self.
Breathes there an Indian
With soul so dead
That he longs not
To singe the hair
From a Sponsor's legs,
And set first torch,
In dark, unknown,
To the Freshman Bonfire?
—Scurrillus
To the uninitiated, this must seem a period of
gala festivity.
Happy boys and girls erect twenty-foot savages
of uninflammable crepe and facial tissue on the
sunny lawns. Old alums eagerly return to relive
the studly successes that always are worthier
long afterwards. At least one scholar becomes
Red-Hot Prof, while the others presumably glow
lukewarm on the sidelines.
Midterms past, finals still comfortably around
the corner, Stanford students seem immersed in
a traditional American ritual. Beat Cal!
Pari Of 'Stanford Education'
So it all must seem to the outsider. Tragically
for the believers, it is not so simple. For this is
not merely a period of gushing gayety, of com
pelling music and the cleanest exotic dancing in
America. For many, this is an integral aspect of
that continuing process of self-illumination, the
Stanford education.
We are now celebrating our annual, autumnal
psychological debacle, when the Stanford commu
nity must face afresh the reasons for continuing
the Big Game tradition.
In short, why football? Why Cal? Why cheer
leaders? Why care?
Elaborate and accurate motivational explana
tions of these rites are doubtlessly available. That
these might receive widespread admission to the
conventional wisdom is unlikely. For one thing,
such theories are probably overwhelmingly un
flattering.
Komnant Of Ages Past
Besides, everybody already has his own theory.
However else Stanford students may be damnable,
they are universally bright. Even to the most
apple-cheeked of the enthusiastic, it must some
time occur that the football spectacle is a rem
nant of ages long past, a holdover from the days
of such psychological delights as bathtub gin,
the Rough Riders, and naive girls.
Intrespectively, students question themselves.
Sadistically, they question others.
We have long since abandoned the swallow-the
whole-pie-on-faith ethic of our forebears. Even
as he eagerly joins in the fun, today's Stanford
student knows he is slightly ridiculous; he knows
he is servant and not master of his impulses. He
tries to explain himself. These attempts at justi

fying our continued participation in the Big Game
Tradition are a signifcant aspect of a Fall Quarter
education at Stanford.
Why?
Why do we do it? Is it as an outlet for frustra
tions and energy bottled too long? Do we scream
"Blood!" as an alternative to drawing a little?
Competition is involved too. Most of us would
push a potato two miles with our nose, if we
could beat somebody at it and eke out a little
respect.
Self-adulation grips us. If one were to arise
every three minutes and bellow his own name lie
might well be put away. Encoding his name as

not merely a period of gushing gayety, of com
pelling music and the cleanest exotic dancing in
America. For many, this is an integral aspect of
that continuing process of self-illumination, the
Stanford education.
We are now celebrating our annual, autumnal
psychological debacle, when the Stanford commu
nity must face afresh the reasons for continuing
the Big Game tradition.
In short, why football? Why Cal? Why cheer
leaders? Why care?
Elaborate and accurate motivational explana
tions of these rites are doubtlessly available. That
these might receive widespread admission to the
conventional wisdom is unlikely. For one thing,
such theories are probably overwhelmingly un
flattering.
Komnant Of Ages Past
Besides, everybody already has his own theory.
However else Stanford students may be damnable,
they are universally bright. Even to the most
apple-cheeked of the enthusiastic, it must some
time occur that the football spectacle is a rem
nant of ages long past, a holdover from the days
of such psychological delights as bathtub gin,
the Rough Riders, and naive girls.
Intrespectively, students question themselves.
Sadistically, they question others.
We have long since abandoned the swallow-the
whole-pie-on-faith ethic of our forebears. Even
as he eagerly joins in the fun, today's Stanford
student knows he is slightly ridiculous; he knows
he is servant and not master of his impulses. He
tries to explain himself. These attempts at justi

fying our continued participation in the Big Game
Tradition are a signifcant aspect of a Fall Quarter
education at Stanford.
Why?
Why do we do it? Is it as an outlet for frustra
tions and energy bottled too long? Do we scream
"Blood!" as an alternative to drawing a little?
Competition is involved too. Most of us would
push a potato two miles with our nose, if we
could beat somebody at it and eke out a little
respect.
Self-adulation grips us. If one were to arise
every three minutes and bellow his own name lie
might well be put away. Encoding his name as
"Stanford" protects him. That all have Ihe same
code seems to perturb few.
Who would tamper with tradition? How is to
day's student to have a flavorful Stanford ex
perience ,how is he to grasp the sweet quintes
sence of Farm life without partaking of this old
and colorful Festival?
Mississippi vs. Paper Folding-
Young men and women toss and turn in their
dorm bunks, a haunting insomnia of doubt pur- j
suing them. Why do they go to Mississippi? Did
I fold enough paper begonias? Am I doing my !
duty?
One can find uppcrclassmen who eschewed all
this as freshmen, who now wish sadly that they
had let themselves go then. The pitiless confines
of maturity prevent their participating now. It
looks so free and beautiful and enjoyable, a good
way to meet a lot of kids and joke and laugh and
have a good time. Does it matter at all whether i
or not the whole thing is for real? Isn't one pre
text for a social gathering about as good as an
other? Not unlike charades.
School Spirit
Some even maintain that such affairs preserve)
"school spirit," a vital ingredient in any "good"
school. Nothing makes you crack that Civ like
knowing that your blockbusters are the roughest
and the toughest. Pride in one's school iscssen
tial.
Regardless of his personal feelings, no rational
being would ever anticipate Stanford dumping the
Big Game. One can only hope for an increasing i
sophistication of the justifications.
For a variety of reasons, we appear to need a
football tradition at Stanford. Let us recognize
that need, tempering loyalty with honesty.
Indeed, to the uninitiated, it may well appear!
that this fall Stanford is engaged in one of the;
best aspects of American college life. The hidden
truth of that statement should be profoundly en
couraging, at least consoling. Such a truth should
be zealously guarded lest a disillusioned alumni
abandon us, leaving Stanford an indigent, abject
shell of its former upholstered self.
Breathes there an Indian
With soul so dead
That he longs not
To singe the hair
From a Sponsor's legs,
And set first torch,
In dark, unknown,
To the Freshman Bonfire?
—Scurrillus
To the uninitiated, this must seem a period of
gala festivity.
Happy boys and girls erect twenty-foot savages
of uninflammable crepe and facial tissue on the
sunny lawns. Old alums eagerly return to relive
the studly successes that always are worthier
long afterwards. At least one scholar becomes
Red-Hot Prof, while the others presumably glow
lukewarm on the sidelines.
Midterms past, finals still comfortably around
the corner, Stanford students seem immersed in
a traditional American ritual. Beat Cal!
