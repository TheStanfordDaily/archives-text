## Why Did Poli U. Sponsor George Lincoln Rockwell? 
### 
i Dear Sir:
The motivation of the Stanford
I Political Union inviting George
Lincoln Rockwell, Commander of
i the Nazi Party, to the Campus is
j incomprehensible, totally bewild
; ering to me. If the purpose of the
i Union was to gain political en
! lightenment, it seems to me it did
j not have to descend to the gutter
to seek light.
If, on the other hand, the pur
pose of the invitation was, accord*
; ing to some students, "entertain
ment," the Union demonstrated
I immaturity, ignorance, poor taste.
The tragic past, alas, of only too
i recent date, can not be regarded
as "funny" even in jest.
It so happened that I person
ally witnessed a similar clown in
politics, Herr Adolf Hitler, who
came to "entertain" the German
people. The end proved far from
; being humorous. What is worse,
lit proved tragic not only for the
I German people, but for the entire
humanity and, above all, for
' Christendom. The sorrowful leg
acy of this period is with us—a
profound de-Christianization, de
humanization of western society.
It is a great pity tHat memory is
so short; it is tragic that students
are unaware of the scars the short !
period of the thirties had inflicted
upon all of us. As to the implica
tions for the future of such hu
i mor it is indeed frightening.

• Jews First In Palestine
Dear Sir:
I have little to add to Mr. Tay
lor's excellent refutation of Gha
leb A. Hourani's criticism of the
film "Exodus," except the follow
ing:

It is historically absurd to af-
I ifirm, as Mr. Hourani does in the
i 1 November sth issue of The Daily,
| that Arabs inhabited Palestine
; j "thousands of years ago."
If anything, the historical truth
> is that it was these very Jews
I about whom Mr. Hourani is so in
censed that inhabited Palestine
• thousands of years ago (more spe
cifically from about 1300 B.C. un
til TO A.D., if we take the Roman
conquest, led by Vespasian and
!Titus, as initiating the dispersion
: of the Jews).
I
I Palestine was then successively
; Roman, Byzantine, and Turkish.
| Turkish occupation and adminis*
jtration ended only in 1917, when
j General Allenby defeated the
j Turks and entered Jerusalem.
■ This coincides with the Balfour
declaration and the subsequent
British Mandate which ended in
1918. At no time in history was
Palestine ever an independent,
sovereign, Arab state. It is true |
that Arabs did settle there in the
wake of the crusades of Moham
med's successors, but that was in
j the seventh century A.D., not;
thousands of years ago, and Pales- j
tine was only just another prov-1
ince of a larger Arab caliphate, i
soon to fall under the Turkish j
yoke.
I am afraid that on purely
chronological grounds (I am not j
passing judgment on present-day 1
legality) the Jews were there I
first. This is quite evident from
even "a minimum knowledge of
history."
yours truly,
