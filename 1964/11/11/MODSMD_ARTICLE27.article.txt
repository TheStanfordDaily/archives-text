# COMMITMENT
## 
### 
"Paradoxically though it may
scorn, true frcodoin comos
through commitment to people,
to ideas, to causes greater than
one's self. . . . We are happiest
when we are fully used, and it
is the boredom and frustration of
disengagement that makes us
i querulous and petty and mean.
