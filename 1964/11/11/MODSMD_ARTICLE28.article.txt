# WORK NOT PAID FOR

### 
"The work the world will rn>i
let die was never paid for. . . .
No man was hired to find out that
the world was round, or that val
leys were worn by water, or that
the stars were suns. No man was
ever paid to burn at the stake, or
to die, that other men might be
free to live." David Starr Jordan
