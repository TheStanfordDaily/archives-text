# Shakespearean Critic Discusses King Lear
## 
### 
Kins; Lear is "the play of Shake
speare that speaks with greatest
urgency to this century," said
Prof. Maynard Mack last night as
he addressed the Tuesday Eve
ning Series audience in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
Mack, on the faculty of Yale
University, is a visiting professor
at Berkeley, and also serves as
associate director of the Yale
Shakespeare Institute.
ACCORDING to him. one of
the principle reasons for Lear's
greatness is that it has no scenes
of introspection. "Action seems to
spring directly out of the bed
rock of personality." He stressed
that "it is only today that the
play can be seen approaching its
original grandeur."
Remarking that the play is
highly appropriate to our con
temporary world. Mack empha

sized that this is why "every
where in the fifties and sixties
young people are responding to
King; Lear as never before."
He concluded by stating the
main theme of the play: "The
ultimate question to which all
questions in King: Lear lead is
that of man's fate."
