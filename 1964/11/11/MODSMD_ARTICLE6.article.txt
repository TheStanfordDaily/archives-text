# RADIO CONTACT
## Stanford Scientists Confirm Discovery In Astronomy 
### 
The first direct confirmation
o! a Frencli discovery that one
of the sky's most intense radio
sources is, a shell-like sphere
has been reported by a pair of
Stanford radio astronomers.
Cassiopeia's A-shell and five
more of the strongest known ra
dio sources yielded their secrets
I to Drs. A. Richard Thompson and
; Thiruvcnkata Krishnan, who used
the Stanford Cross radio tele
| scope. This is a much more ela
borate device than was used in
! the original discovery of the Cas
siopeia A-shell by Dr. James Le
i queux of the Paris Observatory in
j 1962.
THIS STANFORD meas u re
: merits are among the most aceu
j rate ever made of 9.1 -centimeter
i (3300-megaeycle) radio waves
; from space.
They indicate that Cassiopeia's
A-shell is about 30 per cent thicker
than originally thought, or around
three light years thick.
A supernova which exploded in
Cassiopeia gave off a radio
emitting cloud of gas which
i formed a hollow shell surround
ing the remains of the star some
11,000 liglit years from the earth.
MODIFICATION'S of the 32-
j dish Stanford Cross telescope has
more than doubled its resolving
power ami narrowed the "slit."
through which the astronomers
saw a sharp, one-dimensional fo
cus of the radio source, to less
than 1 H( it h of a degree.
These modifications were car
ried out by James S. Pieken and
Dr. fjovinda .Swarup under t li e
direction of Prof. Ronald N.
Biaeeweli, director of the Stan
ford Radio Astronomy Institute
who originally designed and built
the radio telescope more than
five years ago.
The work was supported by the
National Science Foundation and
the Air Force Office of Scientific
Research.
