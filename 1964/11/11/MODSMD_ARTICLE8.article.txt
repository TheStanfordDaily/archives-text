# Author Dos Passos Eyes Conservatism Favorably
## 
### BOB DAVIS 
"I believe that the conserva
tives are on the side of ordinary
citizens." explained noted Ameri
can novelist John Dos Passos
Tuesday in reply to a query about
his present political philosophy.
Dos Passos, who publicly sup

ported the Communist Party can
didate for the presidency in 1932.
this year found Senator Go Id
vvatcr "a very attractive candi
date, t hough he made some sev
eral mistakes during the cam
paign."
STERN'S "Guest-in-Ilesidence,"
Dos Passos has produced a con
tinuing commentary on American
society during his more than 40
years on the literary scene. He
has also maintained an active in
terest in politics, and critics re
peatedly examine the political
significance of his novels.
John Dos Passos' movement
form the political left to the right
seems best explained, as he him
self said over lunch in Stern Hall,
by his "constant concern for the
individual." In his novels he has
attempted to present the "individ
ual against the background of so
ciety."
One of America's foremost so
cial-reform novelists, Dos Passos
protested theeconomic and moral
inequalities he found in the
United States during the 1920's
and 1930'5. And, as he remarked
at lunch, "I was willing to give
tiic Marxists the chance to change
a very bad situation."
"< 'ONSKRVATIVIvS take a
sharply different attitude toward
means to achieve social reform,"
Dos Passos remarked. "Reform
cannot effectively be attained
through inefficient and unwork
able government programs."
In viewing American society
now, Dos Passos sees a "trend to

ward too much dependence on
government by the average man."
"The modern Democratic Party
platforms read like the Socialist
Party platforms of the 1930'5,"
he said.
Stern's guest would emphasize
the role of individual action in
our society "beginning, of course,
at the local level."
JOHN I>OS Passos finds a
I "good deal" of talent on the Amor
ican literary sccne today, but also
| observes a strong movement, to
| ward subjectivism. "Writers arc
| trying to completely divorce
| characters from their environ
! ments," he commented.
i Alert and productive, Dos Pas
! Sos contributes to William F.
i Buckley's National Review. He
| has also recently published a book
! of essay's entitled Occasions and
; Protests. The author added ener
! getically, "Now I'm working on a
| study of the later part of the Jef
; fersonian era in American his-
I tory."
