"I ;un tin Alpha and tin < ; >niega, says tin Lord <iod. Who i>, and Who was. I
j and Who is to ionic, tin Almighty." (Revelation 1 :K)
It is not Cod who changes, hut man < whose distortions of «iod seem to always i
be putting Him in a "new perspective." The way some modern theologians talk
ahout God it is difficult to tell if He is supposed to be a life-force, the ground of
our being, a benevolent kindly helping hand who cooperates with men when they
ask Him to, or what have you. Many people look to scholarly, but often blind,
religious leaders. Hoping to find light for "modern" man they ignore the Light
of the world, the eternally begotten Son of God the Father who is " . . . the
only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality
and dwells in unapproachable light . . ." (I Timothy 6:16)
A personal meeting with Jesus Christ is the beginning of a true relationship
with God. The Word of God says "there is one mediator between God and men,
the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself as ransom for all." (I Timothy 2:5, 6).
There are no human go-betweens, no earthly mediators necessary in order for you
to discover for yourself what God is like, for the moment you meet Him you
not only become His own, but also thenceforth are a priest in the household of
God (I Peter 2:4-6). It is when you settle your account with God the Father,
by personally meeting as your Lord, Jesus the Son of God, that in the depths
of your heart you'll find a personal Friend and Comforter, God the Holy Spirit:
"For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. For you did not
receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the
spirit of sonship. When we cry, 'Abba! Father!' it is the Spirit Himself bearing >
I witness with our spirit that we are the children of (,o«l, and if children, then I
heirs, joint heir- with (Tuisi . . , anyone who does have the Spirit of Christ is
I none of I lis" (Kotnaus 8:14-16,9).
