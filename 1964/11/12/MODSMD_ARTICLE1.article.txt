# 'Fast For Freedom' To Feed Poor Of Mississippi
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
Mississippi Negroes have an aver
age annual income of $606.
That fact, translated into human
terms, means that some 50 per cent
of Mississippi's Negro families, exist
ing at or below a level of marginal
substance, will sit down to a Thanks
giving dinner of greens, biscuit, and
a little fat back.
The November 19 "Fast For Free
dom." coordinated on college cam
puses across the nation by NSA, will
attempt to deal with this problem
the inequality of America's Thanks
giving abundance -by supplying food
staples to the "disinherited" people of
Mississippi.

STANFORD STUDENTS may par
ticipate in the "Fast" by voluntarily
signing up this week in their resi
dences or on quad to forego the eve
ning meal of Nov. 19. The University
Food Service has agreed to donate the
raw food cost (50c) saved on each meal
to a common fund which NSA will
use to purchase food. The Interna
tional Brotherhood of Teamsters will
ship the food to Mississippi without
charge.
Supporters of the "Fast" justify
the project with a recitation of the
economic facts of life in Mississippi.
THE MYTH of American abun
dance has somehow passed the Missis
sippi Negro by. At best, he earns
enough to supply his basic needs, with
perhaps enough left over for a luxury

or two. His consumption is maxi
mized; his residual security, mini
mized.
At worst, in the rural agricultural
communities, he lives day to day un
der subhuman conditions, dependent
upon external aid, for his very exist
ence. In America, in 1964, starvation
is still a reality.
In the rural areas of Mississippi,
such as the northwest delta, relative
"prosperity" depends on the cotton
crop.
FOR MANY families, the income
for an entire year is earned during the
few months of the summer when la
borers are needed to chop cotton. Dur
ing the winter, life is eatch-as-catch
ean.
The Council of Federated Organiza

tions (COFO), coordinator of the Free
dom Project, supplies the following
analysis of the economic conditions of
the rural Mississippian Negro.
"The adequacy of dietary levels
Is* measured by two criteria: caloric
intake (quantity) and nutritional con
tent (quality). The caloric intake of
Some — not all — poor rural Missis
sippians is at some — not all — times
sufficient.
"THESE TIMES are usually when
they receive government commodities;
When the tenant or low-income farmer
receives money from his cotton and
other minor crops, usually in early
and mid-fall; and when landlords give
credit to tenant families, usually from
late March to July.
"The rest of the time the poor rural

families, the under- and un-employed.
fare as best they can. Usually this
means tightening their belts, surviv
ing on one meal a day, adults going
without so that children may eat- in
short, it means starving.
"Even when people get enough
food, it is largely starches and fats.
There is great reliance on corn bread,
sweet potatoes, rice and fat or side
pork. Even the government commodi
ties are not sufficient for adequate
nutrition. The poor in Mississippi do
not. get enough protein, calcium, es
sential vitamins and minerals for
proper nutrition."
THE NUTRITIONAL needs of the
poor of Mississippi, which the "Fast"
hopes to supply, are basic. The hard
ships of their lives, however, are Con

tinually augmented by the substan
dard conditions in which the economic
and social system of the state forces
them to live.
Dave Harris, a Stanford sophomore
who worked in t lie Delta with the
Mississippi Freedom Project, made
the following observations in a letter:
"Tiie family I studied is presently
afflicted with a case of goiters due to
malnutrition. . . . The sanitary condi
tions in numerous living arrange
ments are beyond imagination. Some
of the people here have houses that
sit in the middle of large pools of ex
crement. . . . Death in childbirth is a
constant fact of life. . . . We don't
need to send a Peace Corps all the
way to Africa to find subhuman liv
ing conditions."
