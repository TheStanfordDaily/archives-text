# By-Laws Committee To Meet
## Will Discuss Hoard Voting Changes 
### 
A second meeting of the Hy
| Laws Committee will be held at
7:30 p.m. today at Tresidder to
reconsider the reactix ation of the
Fundamental Standard Commis
sion and changes in tho voting
I membership of ASSU Boards.
The hearing will also initiate
discussion on the proposed salary
increases for the ASSU Travel
Manager, according to By-Laws
Committee Chairman Carl Ilillen
! brand.
At the first healing, members
i
of the Fundamental Standard and
Honor Code Commission, Nora
I Crow. Carolyn Ward, Dick Berg,
I Bill Brown. Steve Stem, Ed Shaw,
! Berny Lohr-Schmidt, and ASSU
j President Scott Meßride, were
: not all present. This necessitated
j the second hearing on measures
j to reactivate the Committee.
ALTHOUGH THE Fundamental
Standard Committee is still le
gally in operation, it has not .N et
acted on any issues. Under the
proposed by-laws amendments,
the Commission would serve as
a research and advisory body to
i the judicial councils and the Leg
! islature. It would organize case
histories and precedents for the
information of the student body.
The hearing will also consider
by-laws changes concerning I h e
, voting status of the ASSU Presi
dent and LASSU representatives
j in ASSU Board actions.
Presently, the LASSU const it u
, iion provides that Meßride w ill
have a vote in the boards and
: that a LASSU representative will
(participate as a non-voting mem
! tier.
THESE MEMBERS, however,
are not acknowledged in the in
dividual boards' By-Laws.
The proposed amendments
i would correct this inconsistency
las well as give a vote to the
j LASSU representatives.
At t fie last LASSU meeting, one
chairman of an ASSU board
stated that he had not been in
formed of the hearing on the
| proposed changes, and therefore
requested that a second hearing
i be held.
The final item for consideration
by the By-Laws Committee will
be the proposed increase of salary
I for ASSU travel managers, Chris
tine Hoover and John Anderholt.
; from $200 to $300 per quarter.
