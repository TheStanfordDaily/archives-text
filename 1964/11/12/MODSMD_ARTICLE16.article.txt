mer in Hong Kong, sponsored by

They participated in spring quar
ter training sessions, toured Ja
pan, and then lived and worked
in Hong Kong.
Several girls shared a tiny
room in which Ihere was running
water for only a few hours in
the mornings and evenings. One
of them, Ruth Anion, taught Eng
lish to China University students
and helped her roommates with
child recreation programs on
tenement rooftops.
There were three girls and 23
boys participating in the pro
gram.
"HONG KONG is crowded with
three and a half million people,"
Miss Anion said, "and it is easy
to see why many Chinese long to
come to America to study. . . .
They struggle through Chem
istry books written in 1921 . . .
and try to study in areas more
crowded than Tresidder during
the lunch hour."
