# Foreign Policy Institute Opens Tomorrow

### 
"Exciting . . . provocative ..." Those are
the words lIR Conferences Vice-President
Mike Pillsbury uses in describing the Eighth
Annual Foreign Policy Institute to be held to
morrow and Satuday.
The conference is titled, "Riding the Tiger's
Tail: The U.S. in Southeast Asia," and the
speaker's list is a "Who's Who" of Asian
scholars, topped by Professor B. B. Fall of
Howard University, Washington, D.C.
THE FOREIGN POLICY Institutes were
inaugurated at Stanford in the spring of 1958,
when James "Scotty" Reston of the New York
Times addressed the University on "American
Foreign Policy."
In succeeding years, the Institute has
grown to national prominence, hosting such
distinguished gentlemen as Averill Harriman
(1960), Ralph Bunche (1961), and former Sec
retary of State Christian Herter (1962).
Since the opening Foreign Policy Institute,
the program topics have narrowed to focus on
a particular problem facing American policy

makers, including the Si no-Soviet split and the
implications of an emerging Africa. In line
with previous conferences, the program this
year is topical and timely.
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS in South
east Asia have taken on a new dimension since
World War 11. The growing political maturity
within a distinctly Asian context demands con
siderable attention and study by the West if
peaceful and effective communication between
these two different "worlds" is to develop.
This supplement and the Foreign Policy In
stitute are designed to provide an initial under
standing of the factors which have and con
tinue to influence national political develop
ments in Southeast Asia.
The Japanese occupation of Southeast Asia
in World War II ended the unquestioned politi
cal dominance of the white 'imperialists" in
this region. Nationalist thought, inspired by
the Japanese, led to demands for independence
from colonial rulers who returned for a short
occupation after the war.

THESE DEMANDS could not be ignored
and the post war decades saw the creation of
several nation-states, among them Laos, Ma
laysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Burma, and Cambodia.
In this supplement, the political systems
and national goals of these states are dis
cussed.
In general, the political development of
these nations has been a process of modifying
the political traditions inherited from the West.
The reasons for these modifications (and in
some cases complete rejectionsi have their
root in the history of contacts with Indian and
Chinese cultures, as well as the indigenous
facts of ethnic rivalries, substance agricultural
economies, intra national geographic isolation,
and the dominance of primitive technological
and educational practices.
THESE ARE BRIEFLY highlighted in the
supplement's illustrations and in the literature
available to conference registrants in their
working papers.

Registration for the conference will con
tinue through Friday on Engineering Corner,
at the Post Office, and at Union Patio.
The conference fee, used to defray speakers'
honoraria, is only $1.00. Tickets to the confer
ence entitle a student to admission to all ad
dresses, seminars, and to the speakers' recep
tion Friday evening, as well as to a working
paper on Southeast Asia, writton by the author
of this supplement, Miss Harriet Hatcher, of
the Food Research Institute.
THE CONFERENCE program is as follows:
• Friday at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel, the
opening address will be given by Professor Joel
Halpern of Brandeis University, "Dominant
Social Customs and the Role of Religion in
Southeast Asia." The well-known anthropolo
gist will attempt to explain the Buddhist-
Catholic conflicts of the region as well as show
the structure of those villages that have pre
sented our military strategists with such prob
lems.
• Friday evening at 7:30 p.m., a panel of

Bay Area economists will oiler a critique of
America's foreign aid program in Southeast
Asia, and comment on the conditions of Asian
economic development.
• Later that evening, at S: 45 p.m., still in
Dinkclspiel, Professor David Wilson of UCLA
will discuss "Continuity in Southeast Asia,"
explaining relations intra-regionally as well as
providing a basis for understanding Asian bi
lateral relations with the U.S.
• Saturday morning at 9:30, the Foreign
Policy Institute will consider future American
policy alternatives in Asia in a panel discus
sion. At 10:30, the group will divide for semi
nars, examining nation-by-nation the theses
and ideas presented as guides to understand
ing the whole Southeast Asian region.
• Closing the conference, Dr. Bernard B.
Fall, one of the youngest political historians
of our time, will probe "Nationalism and the
Problems of Stability in Southeast Asia" in an
attempt to lock the whole conference into per
spective.

"Exciting . . . provocative ..." Those are
the words lIR Conferences Vice-President
Mike Pillsbury uses in describing the Eighth
Annual Foreign Policy Institute to be held to
morrow and Satuday.
The conference is titled, "Riding the Tiger's
Tail: The U.S. in Southeast Asia," and the
speaker's list is a "Who's Who" of Asian
scholars, topped by Professor B. B. Fall of
Howard University, Washington, D.C.
THE FOREIGN POLICY Institutes were
inaugurated at Stanford in the spring of 1958,
when James "Scotty" Reston of the New York
Times addressed the University on "American
Foreign Policy."
In succeeding years, the Institute has
grown to national prominence, hosting such
distinguished gentlemen as Averill Harriman
(1960), Ralph Bunche (1961), and former Sec
retary of State Christian Herter (1962).
Since the opening Foreign Policy Institute,
the program topics have narrowed to focus on
a particular problem facing American policy

makers, including the Si no-Soviet split and the
implications of an emerging Africa. In line
with previous conferences, the program this
year is topical and timely.
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS in South
east Asia have taken on a new dimension since
World War 11. The growing political maturity
within a distinctly Asian context demands con
siderable attention and study by the West if
peaceful and effective communication between
these two different "worlds" is to develop.
This supplement and the Foreign Policy In
stitute are designed to provide an initial under
standing of the factors which have and con
tinue to influence national political develop
ments in Southeast Asia.
The Japanese occupation of Southeast Asia
in World War II ended the unquestioned politi
cal dominance of the white 'imperialists" in
this region. Nationalist thought, inspired by
the Japanese, led to demands for independence
from colonial rulers who returned for a short
occupation after the war.

THESE DEMANDS could not be ignored
and the post war decades saw the creation of
several nation-states, among them Laos, Ma
laysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Burma, and Cambodia.
In this supplement, the political systems
and national goals of these states are dis
cussed.
In general, the political development of
these nations has been a process of modifying
the political traditions inherited from the West.
The reasons for these modifications (and in
some cases complete rejectionsi have their
root in the history of contacts with Indian and
Chinese cultures, as well as the indigenous
facts of ethnic rivalries, substance agricultural
economies, intra national geographic isolation,
and the dominance of primitive technological
and educational practices.
THESE ARE BRIEFLY highlighted in the
supplement's illustrations and in the literature
available to conference registrants in their
working papers.

Registration for the conference will con
tinue through Friday on Engineering Corner,
at the Post Office, and at Union Patio.
The conference fee, used to defray speakers'
honoraria, is only $1.00. Tickets to the confer
ence entitle a student to admission to all ad
dresses, seminars, and to the speakers' recep
tion Friday evening, as well as to a working
paper on Southeast Asia, writton by the author
of this supplement, Miss Harriet Hatcher, of
the Food Research Institute.
THE CONFERENCE program is as follows:
• Friday at 4:15 p.m. in Dinkelspiel, the
opening address will be given by Professor Joel
Halpern of Brandeis University, "Dominant
Social Customs and the Role of Religion in
Southeast Asia." The well-known anthropolo
gist will attempt to explain the Buddhist-
Catholic conflicts of the region as well as show
the structure of those villages that have pre
sented our military strategists with such prob
lems.
• Friday evening at 7:30 p.m., a panel of

Bay Area economists will oiler a critique of
America's foreign aid program in Southeast
Asia, and comment on the conditions of Asian
economic development.

"Exciting . . . provocative ..." Those are
the words lIR Conferences Vice-President
Mike Pillsbury uses in describing the Eighth
Annual Foreign Policy Institute to be held to
morrow and Satuday.
The conference is titled, "Riding the Tiger's
Tail: The U.S. in Southeast Asia," and the
speaker's list is a "Who's Who" of Asian
scholars, topped by Professor B. B. Fall of
Howard University, Washington, D.C.
THE FOREIGN POLICY Institutes were
inaugurated at Stanford in the spring of 1958,
when James "Scotty" Reston of the New York
Times addressed the University on "American
Foreign Policy."
In succeeding years, the Institute has
grown to national prominence, hosting such
distinguished gentlemen as Averill Harriman
(1960), Ralph Bunche (1961), and former Sec
retary of State Christian Herter (1962).
Since the opening Foreign Policy Institute,
the program topics have narrowed to focus on
a particular problem facing American policy

makers, including the Si no-Soviet split and the
implications of an emerging Africa. In line
with previous conferences, the program this
year is topical and timely.
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS in South
east Asia have taken on a new dimension since
World War 11. The growing political maturity
within a distinctly Asian context demands con
siderable attention and study by the West if
peaceful and effective communication between
these two different "worlds" is to develop.
This supplement and the Foreign Policy In
stitute are designed to provide an initial under
standing of the factors which have and con
tinue to influence national political develop
ments in Southeast Asia.
The Japanese occupation of Southeast Asia
in World War II ended the unquestioned politi
cal dominance of the white 'imperialists" in
this region. Nationalist thought, inspired by
the Japanese, led to demands for independence
from colonial rulers who returned for a short
occupation after the war.

THESE DEMANDS could not be ignored
and the post war decades saw the creation of
several nation-states, among them Laos, Ma
laysia, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Burma, and Cambodia.
In this supplement, the political systems
and national goals of these states are dis
cussed.
In general, the political development of
these nations has been a process of modifying
the political traditions inherited from the West.
The reasons for these modifications (and in
some cases complete rejectionsi have their
root in the history of contacts with Indian and
Chinese cultures, as well as the indigenous
facts of ethnic rivalries, substance agricultural
economies, intra national geographic isolation,
and the dominance of primitive technological
and educational practices.
THESE ARE BRIEFLY highlighted in the
supplement's illustrations and in the literature
available to conference registrants in their
working papers.

Registration for the conference will con
tinue through Friday on Engineering Corner,
at the Post Office, and at Union Patio.
The conference fee, used to defray speakers'
honoraria, is only $1.00. Tickets to the confer
ence entitle a student to admission to all ad
dresses, seminars, and to the speakers' recep
tion Friday evening, as well as to a working
paper on Southeast Asia, writton by the author
of this supplement, Miss Harriet Hatcher, of
the Food Research Institute.
