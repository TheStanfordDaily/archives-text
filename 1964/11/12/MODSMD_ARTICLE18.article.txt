# Experts See Instability In Laos Politics
## 
### 
Although a representative,
premier-cabinet type political
system was created lor inde
pendent Laos in 1953, discus
sion of an organized political
system in this country today is
impossible.
This is so. according to a South
east Asia expert, because, since
19.">3, "There has been an unmis
takable resemblance between gov
ernment in Laos and the old par
lor game of musical chairs."
THE CURRENT political chaos
has its roots in the political strug
gles in the decade following World
War II when members of the rul
ing elite (mostly from the s a me '
family) were divided over the
isue of renewed French protec
tion.
King Sisavong Vang's accept
ance of the French return in 1946
led his half brother. Prince Sou
vanna Vong, to organize a rebel
lion. With the aid of the Viet
Minh, he controlled the northern
two provinces and harassed the
King's government. Only the de
parture of the French in 19:53
made possible a coalition govern
ment, restitution of the rebellious
provinces to the country, and the
dissolution of Sou vanna Vong's
communist party, the Pathet Lao.
Still the new nation could not
maintain internal unity in the face
of outside influences. And the
strategic position of Laos with
respect to Chinese Communist
advances in Southeast Asia meant
continued support by the Viet
Minh of the Pathet Lao in spite
of its official dissolution.
THUS, since independence, con
trol of the Laotian government
has been prey to factional dis
putes outside of an organized poli
tical system.
International organizations have
attempted to mediate the disputes
and, particularly, put an end to
foreign intervention in Laotian
politics. But the political fact of
life that communist subversion is
beyond the pale of international
agreements has meant that anti
communist and neutral factions
have been supported by aid from
Western nations interested in pre
venting the spread of communism.
Complete communist control of
Laos has thus been avoided, but
also has the development of an
organized political system.
As with an organized political
system, a discussion of national
goals is inapplicable to the Lao
tian situation. The complete lack
of national unity and the instabil
ity of each regime has precluded
effective planning in national
terms.
