In independent South Vietnam
irom 1956 to 1963, the organized
political system did not function
as an instrument for the defini

Rather, the organized political
system functioned as the tool by
which one family sought to
achieve its ambitions for itself
and the nation.
NATIONAL goals, even those
of the educated middle class to
say nothing of the uneducated
peasants were ignored. All at
tempts to implement them were
made outside the political sys

These "extra-legal" attempts
were culminated in the forceful
overthrow of the ruling family in

In independent South Vietnam
irom 1956 to 1963, the organized
political system did not function
as an instrument for the defini
tion and expression of national
goals.
Rather, the organized political
system functioned as the tool by
which one family sought to
achieve its ambitions for itself
and the nation.
NATIONAL goals, even those
of the educated middle class to
say nothing of the uneducated
peasants were ignored. All at
tempts to implement them were
made outside the political sys
tem.
These "extra-legal" attempts
were culminated in the forceful
overthrow of the ruling family in
1963 and led to the reorganiza
tion of the political system in
1964.
The import of this reorganiza
tion becomes clear when it is
viewed in the context of the earl

THE PLEBISCITE in 1956, in
which officials reported that 98
per cent of the people of South
Vietnam chose the republican
form of government over a mon

The 1956 elections for the first
Constituent Assembly were
rigged. Ratification by that body
of the constitution was merely
a rubber stamping of the de
