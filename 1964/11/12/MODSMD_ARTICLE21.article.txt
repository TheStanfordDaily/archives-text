# Malaysia's Political System Defines Its National Goals
## 
### 
The political system in the in
dependent Federation of Ma
laysia is intended to be the in
strument through which na
tional goals are defined.
The system is a federated dem
ocracy (composed of the Malay
States, Sinpagore, Sarawak, and
North Borneo.
ITS STABILITY and effective
ness remain to be proven for the
nation is only a year old. But
the successful experience of the
former Federation of Malaya
with this system indicates that
it can be effective in Southeast
Asia.
The present national goals,
however, are still those of the
founders of the Federation of Ma
laysia and have not been devel
oped through the workings of the
new institutions. Instead, they
were defined in the Federation
of Malaya under the strong in
fluence of Tungku Abdul Rah
man, now leader of the new na
tion.
His political goal is to contain
growth of communism that mush
roomed in the late fifties in the
Chinese community of Singapore
on the doorstep of his former na
tion.
THE TUNGKU plans to supress
communism by force and via the
political system by counterbalanc
ing th e eleetorial power of the
large numbers of Chinese in Ma
laya and Singapore with the non-
Chinese populations of these
areas, Sarawak and North Bor
neo.
The extent of support for the
Tungku's goal and the strength
of the opposition are difficult to
assess. Tungku's main support
ers, the Malay, fear political do
mination by the Chinese, and until
! 19(»1 he opposed the union with
Singapore since it would reduce
the Malay to a minority.

In the Federation of Malaya the
dominant political party was the
alliance composed of Chinese,
Malayans, and Indians. The coor
dination it represented depended
on the special privileges given to
the Malay and the tacit under
standing that the Malay would
dominate the politics and the
Chinese would dominate the eco
nomic activities.
HE IS NOW counting on the
indigenous people of Borneo and
Sarawak, but they are known to
fear Ihe Malay as much as the
Chinese. And thus, it is possible
that the Chinese will assume po
litical as well as economic control
of the new nation.
On the other hand, ihere is ap
parently dissention within the
Chinese population.
There are communists support
ed by Peking and Djakarta;
wealthy, conservative. English

speaking Chinese; and some fol
lowers of Chiang Kai Shek.
FURTHERMORE, it is charac
teristic of the Chinese 1o be pri
marily concerned with economic
advancement, and they have been
responsive to the economic sanc
tions against communist countries
by the West and are not likely to
risk losing these markets.
The prosperous Chinese who
have made Malaya and Singapore
their home have then a vested
interest in supporting the Tung
ku's anti-communist goals as they
have done in the Malayan Alli
ance Party and the moderate gov
ernment of Singapore prior to
Malaysia.
The Tungku's goals may bo fur
ther strengthened by Hie contrast
which the democratic system pre
sents to the workings of the to
talitarian states of Peking and
Djakarta.

dependent Federation of Ma
laysia is intended to be the in
strument through which na
tional goals are defined.
The system is a federated dem
ocracy (composed of the Malay
States, Sinpagore, Sarawak, and
North Borneo.
ITS STABILITY and effective
ness remain to be proven for the
nation is only a year old. But
the successful experience of the
former Federation of Malaya
with this system indicates that
it can be effective in Southeast
Asia.
The present national goals,
however, are still those of the
founders of the Federation of Ma
laysia and have not been devel
oped through the workings of the
new institutions. Instead, they
were defined in the Federation
of Malaya under the strong in
fluence of Tungku Abdul Rah
man, now leader of the new na
tion.
His political goal is to contain
growth of communism that mush
roomed in the late fifties in the
Chinese community of Singapore
on the doorstep of his former na
tion.
THE TUNGKU plans to supress
communism by force and via the
political system by counterbalanc
ing th e eleetorial power of the
large numbers of Chinese in Ma
laya and Singapore with the non-
Chinese populations of these
areas, Sarawak and North Bor
neo.
The extent of support for the
Tungku's goal and the strength
of the opposition are difficult to
assess. Tungku's main support
ers, the Malay, fear political do
mination by the Chinese, and until
! 19(»1 he opposed the union with
Singapore since it would reduce
the Malay to a minority.

In the Federation of Malaya the
dominant political party was the
alliance composed of Chinese,
Malayans, and Indians. The coor
dination it represented depended
on the special privileges given to
the Malay and the tacit under
standing that the Malay would
dominate the politics and the
Chinese would dominate the eco
nomic activities.
HE IS NOW counting on the
indigenous people of Borneo and
Sarawak, but they are known to
fear Ihe Malay as much as the
Chinese. And thus, it is possible
that the Chinese will assume po
litical as well as economic control
of the new nation.
On the other hand, ihere is ap
parently dissention within the
Chinese population.
There are communists support
ed by Peking and Djakarta;
wealthy, conservative. English

speaking Chinese; and some fol
lowers of Chiang Kai Shek.
FURTHERMORE, it is charac
teristic of the Chinese 1o be pri
marily concerned with economic
advancement, and they have been
responsive to the economic sanc
tions against communist countries
by the West and are not likely to
risk losing these markets.
The prosperous Chinese who
have made Malaya and Singapore
their home have then a vested
interest in supporting the Tung
ku's anti-communist goals as they
have done in the Malayan Alli
ance Party and the moderate gov
ernment of Singapore prior to
Malaysia.
The Tungku's goals may bo fur
ther strengthened by Hie contrast
which the democratic system pre
sents to the workings of the to
talitarian states of Peking and
Djakarta.
