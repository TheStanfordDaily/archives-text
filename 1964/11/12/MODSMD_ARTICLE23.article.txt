# Indonesia's Aims Determine Government Organization
## 
### 
In independent Indonesia the organized political -system has
not functioned as an accepted instrument for the attainment of
national goals. On the contrary, the organized political system
lias been determined by the national goals.
Thus, as there has been but one major change in the national
err*a 1 e cinnn in/lAnoiirlnnnn I _

goals since independence, there*
has been but one corresponding
major change in Ibe political sys
tem.
THE 1945 national goal was in-
I ternational independence fro m
the re-established Dutch colonial
rule, and internal independence of
che bourgeoisie from the estab
lished elite, whether its members
were Indonesian or foreign.
The system then was an or
ganized military hierarchy of
guerilla fighters, which, when hos
tilities ceased, quickly evolved
i into a parliamentary democracy
with a strong executive.
The legislature served to main
tain the internal independence of
the articulate middle class, and
their interest groups were the |
only ones represented ( civil ser-j
• vants, army officers, trade union j
leaders, Muslims, youth and stu
dent organizations, bankers, edi
tors, and importers).
THE strong presidency served
to maintain the goal of interna ]
tional independence and was thus
awarded to Sukarno, recognized
leader of the revolution.
The achievement of these j
things brought an end to unified (
Indonesian aspirations to the ex-1
tent that soon after the revolu
tion there really were no national
goals and no workable political
system. The democracy that was
established was rendered ineffec
tive by factionalism.
Tile first parliamentary dec-

•r • —.
tions were held in 1955 after ten
j years of rule by legislators ap
pointed from among the leaders
i ol the revolution. In this election,
j at least 27 parties came to the
; fore. The cabinets chosen by the
| legislature of the first decade
were so unstable that there were
i nine changes.
The decisive issues were never
questions of national import, but
iof personal ambitions. Corrup
' tion and extra-legal activities oc
curred in a mire of political stag-
I nation.
SI'KAKNO divorced himself
from any party affiliations and
! concerned himself with maintain
i ing his political power by playing
| the factions against one another.
The power which he accumu
lated has never been absolute, but
in 197)9 it was sufficient to en
able him to articulate new na
; tional goals and change the politi
! cal system.
The new national goal defined
by Sukarno is, not surprisingly,
national unity. As the faction

j indicates, it is not a nationwide
j aspiration, but Sukarno's own, as
I is the new political system.

In independent Indonesia the organized political -system has
not functioned as an accepted instrument for the attainment of
national goals. On the contrary, the organized political system

THE 1945 national goal was in-
I ternational independence fro m
the re-established Dutch colonial
rule, and internal independence of
che bourgeoisie from the estab

were Indonesian or foreign.
The system then was an or
ganized military hierarchy of
guerilla fighters, which, when hos
tilities ceased, quickly evolved
i into a parliamentary democracy
with a strong executive.
The legislature served to main
tain the internal independence of
the articulate middle class, and
their interest groups were the |
only ones represented ( civil ser-j
• vants, army officers, trade union j
leaders, Muslims, youth and stu
dent organizations, bankers, edi
tors, and importers).
THE strong presidency served
to maintain the goal of interna ]
tional independence and was thus
awarded to Sukarno, recognized
leader of the revolution.
The achievement of these j
things brought an end to unified (

goals and no workable political
system. The democracy that was
