# Filipino Democracy: Mass Support Fights Corruption
## 
### 
The cultural liiston ol the Philippines differs from that of
the rest ol Southeast \sia in that it contains only the barest threads
el the religious influences Ironi the Indian culture.
Buddhism never look root and Islam onlv touched the southern

Philippine Islands.
i:x< lOPT FOR limited trade re
lations with the Chinese, the Phil
ippines were not influenced from
the outside until the arrival of the
Spanish in the sixteenth century.
The Spanish brought zealous
Catholic missionaries who spread
their word in indigenous lan
guages throughout the islands
with such success that today the
Philippines claim to be a 90 per
cent Catholic nation.
Acting as feudal landlords, they
reduced the majority of Filipinos
to debt-ridden share-tenancy and
promoted feelings of inferiority
and hopelessness among them.
FILIPINO political develop
ment did not occur until the colo
nial rule of the United States
which lasted from the Spanish-
American War until 191(i. Then
the educational base was broad
ened and a political system on the
American pattern was set up.
One major difference between
the functions and institutions of
ihe three branch republican gov
ernment of the Philippines and
the United States is the greater
power awarded to the Philippine
presidency. Another difference is
that the Filipino parlies are not at
all distinguishable on the basis of
policy, but only on the basis of
personality.
When viewed in the perspective
of the Philippine history of abso
lute chieftan rule followed by co
lonial administration, these are
clearly products of the political
tradition and, were it not for the
American influence, would have
been much more pronounced.
YLT, THK Filipinos have vig
orously supported their system,
and popular vote has been con
sidered so important that buying
and fighting over it has been the
rule lather than the exception.
It is important to note, how
ever, that the violence and appar
ent corruption, occurring at the
poles, the legislature, and the ad
ministrative offices as well as the
frequent crossing of party lines
does not reflect political irrespon
sibility so much as the attempt
to express traditional Philippine
values in a system based on for
eign values.
The twenty years of this value

conflict has not changed the po
litical system but it has modified
the political values of the Fili
pinos. While this change is not
ia* all complete, it is worthy of
notice that President Macapagal
I lias listed cleaning up government
las his first priority objective.
CORRUPTION has limited ef
fective political articulation to the
landowning and wealthy classes,
but they have used the system to
define the national goals. Today
this goal is economic development
and since it has become apparent
that this requires the wholeheart
ed support of the masses, it has
been translated into a-concerted
effort to inspire nationalism
among all social groups.
The main target of these efforts
is the majority of peasants, who
i he enlightened recognize must be
made to feel that they have a
stake in and can contribute to
economic progress.
11 has become clear that the
two most direct routes to such a
feeling of participation are to
provide opportunity for economic
advancement to the peasant and
to make sure his vote has poli
tical validity.
Till: POLITICAL elite have
thus confronted themselves with
the paradox that achievement of
economic development, their own
mandate, requires a broadening
of the political and economic base
that is likely to weaken their po
sition in both spheres for the
short run at least.
This elite has not responded to
the paradox as a group. On the
one hand the younger, moi'e mo
bile liberals have favored changes
and on the other hand, those more
involved in the land and the social
tradition have chosen to keep the
status quo.
Neither has consistently had
their way, and the result is much
cont radietory legislation.
Nevertheless, economic prog
ress has been made, the political
base has become wider, and the
conclusion seems to be that the
national goal will be achieved but
that progress will be as it has
been, very irregular.
