# Burmese Past Shows Failure Of Democracy
## 
### 
The political history of independent Burma indicates that it
is a nation where the organized political system is a function of,
rather than an instrument for the definition of, national goals.
The nation that was born with independence was really a tenu
ous union of separate ethnic communities.

ITS ECONOMIC core was in
disrepair as a result of World War
of independence wore prosperity
II and ethnic rivalries. The goals
and unity, and tho system through
which they were to be achieved
was a parliamentary democracy

derived from the experience with
British colonialism.
The system was replaced, how
ever, as it failed to promote these
goals.
Key to the failure of democracy
in Burma was the intense rival
ries of the eihnic groups which
continued in spite of government
efforts to overcome them.
THE GOVERNMENT group
'as composed of the most ad
vanced, most numerous and best
irganized groups, ihe Burmans
"rom the lowland rice plains. They
were disliked by the others but
tiled by virtue of their superior
power in strategic places.
Enlightened as it was, the group
recognized the need for coopera
tion and integration among a 1 1
groups if a truly strong national
state were to lx- built, and instru
ments for this were incorpomted
Into the system.
The nation created was the
Union of Burma, and the m a jo r
ethnic groups (which are also geo
graphically separated i were
recognizer! as having semi-auton
omous states with the right of
succession.
WITHIN THE system, U Nu.
first Prime Minister .attempted to
create unity and prosperity by: 1.
the 'Burmanization' policy, an edu
cational and social policy to en
courage all to "Love Burma,
Speak Burmese, Encourage Bur
mese Literature"; 2. extension of
Buddhism, not only important as
a common denominator among
'he groups, bin also as a philoso
phy of non-violence; and 3. for-
Mgn economic and technical as
sistance.
Factionalism prevailed, how
ever, and the Anti-Fascist Peoples
Freedom League, led by the Bur
man, educated elite, could not com
pletely control the rice roots com
munities.
Ethnic leaders and communists
who were in closer communica
tion with the peasants encouraged
insurgency and gained strength in
the parliament.
THUS, IN 19fn8, to put an end
to insurgency and avoid reliance
upon communist support, U Nu
arranged for a coup against him
self and retired to a monastery
(which he had always preferred
to political office). This placed
the reins of government in th e
hands of the military, lor! by Gen
eral Ne Win.
This first departure from de
mocracy stemmed the political
chaos by virtue of strict military
controls. Its methods were un
popular, however, and after rela
tive stability had been achieved,
Ne Win bowed to the results of
the free election of 190(1 which
overwhelmingly recalled U Nu.
But democracy again succumbed
to factionalism, and political and
economic chaos reigned.
SO FAR WAS Burma from the
attainment of her national goals
in 1961, one general remarked that
i after twelve years of civilian rule,
j "we still cannot manufacture a
1 needle . . . at this rate our country
| will go to the dogs."
Ne Win staged his own coup in
' 1962, and as military dictator has
; formally abolished the democratic
institutes of the legislature and
political parties and assumed the
Prime Ministership himself.
