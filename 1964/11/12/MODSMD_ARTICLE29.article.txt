# Thailand Government Unique In Its Stability
## Lacks Influence Of Colonial Rule 
### 
"It is the custom of the coun-|
try: when we are told to go and i
vote, we have to do so, a Thai |
peasant is reported to have re
marked. I lis statement is a re
flection of Thai political tradition
and reveals the nature of the pros
ent political system.
For Thailand is unique among
the countries of Southeast Asia
in that it never experienced
colonial rule. And thus the presen'
system is based on the centuriey
old assumption that there are two
distinct political classes: the one
that rules and the one that obeys
YKT, THAILAND'S politica 1
system today is not led by the di
vine monarch of the past, but by
a layman premier with authoritar
ian power. As such it reflects an
other unique Thai tradition which
has been responsible for the poli
tical independence Thailand has
always maintained.
The Thai have always greeted
foreign cultures with open-mind
edness and a willingness to experi
ment and assimilate. Thus, as con
querors of the Angkor kingdom
in Cambodia in the 14th century
the Thai borrowed heavily from
this culture and the Cambodian
prisoners "became to the Thai as
the Greeks to the Romans — edu
cators of their captors." (Thomas
Fitzsimmons, Th a i I a n d, Its
People, Its Society, Its Culture,
p. 119.)
Conquered for a while in the
16th century by the Burmese, the
Thai assimilated aspects of their
culture. In the 19th century, King
Rama avoided colonialism by
opening the doors of Thailand to
numerous western nationalities
and permitting them to establish
their own communities and to
carry out commercial enterprises
on Thai soil.
RAMA IV was the King of
Anna ami the King of Siam who
realized that colonial protection
might protect one out of all he
owns and so accepted what was
good and gave what he could
without sacrificing Thailand's na
tional integrity.
Historians will be able to record
the first half of the 20th century
in Thailand, as they have the rest,
as a period of cultural borrowing.
The donors this time are the west
ern cultures from whom the di
vine kings borrowed technology j
and sociology.
The most brilliant boys who
were sent to the West also \
brought back the philosophy of J
individual liberty and surprised ;
their monarch by demanding poli-!
tical reforms accompany others. !
Thus, the intelligentsia and thci
military deposed him in 1932.
IN TIIK following two and a
half decades, the Thai experi
mented with a parliamentary
democracy. But the retaining, as
they did, of the king as a consti- i
tutional figurehead was symbolic
of the fact that Thai tradition
could not be ignored; that changes
which would come could only be
assimilations into the culture and
could not be revolutionary. Thus,
the Thai experiments with democ
racy were a farce from a western
viewpoint.
In fact, western students wrote
in 1958:
The salient features of mod-i
ern politics in Thailand are rule
by party and faction; the coup
d'etat as an instrument of
change; absence of ideological!

debate in politics; widespread
public apathy toward politics;
concentration of political life
in the capital city; abuse of
office for personal profit; dis
tortion of western parliamen
tary and electoral forms.
IN 1957 General Sarit Thana
rate. who had been active through
the stormy period of experimenta
tion, staged a coup d'etat and
created the present form of gov
ernment. Acquiescing to the domi
nance of Thai political heritage,
he resurrected the basic assump
tion of autocracy and authoritar
ianism and assimilated only those
democratic institutions whi c h
served to strengthen the basic
political system.
Thus, elections replaced th e
tradition of ceremony surround
; ing the initiation of a new head
of state. Peasants participated in
j them, as they have always par-
I ticipated in national events, at

the command ol' the ruling group
who told them what to do a n d
whom to vote for.
THE LEGISLATURE became
the rubber stamp of the premier's
thoughts and was composed of
his appointees. The body was con
sidered necessary, however, in
furthering the image of tradi
tional government rituals.
To attribute all of the accoutre
ments of democracy presently re
tained in the Thai political sys
tem to the need for show is to be
somewhat misleading, however.
For, there is an urban educated
group and a growing popular
awareness of the meaning of
democracy in Thailand. And
while the politically aware may
be a small minority today, the
I spread of education is likely to
! mean benevolent despotism will
fall in popular esteem in favor
of a more broadly based political
' system.


THE BUDDHIST INFLUENCE—Buddhism pervades the philosophy
and lives of the majority of the people of mainland Southeast Asia.
While the depth of its reach renders it a potential agent for political
and social change, at present it must be viewed as it has emerged
from the past, as a dominant, open minded but conservative, un
ambitious social philosophy.

ian power. As such it reflects an
other unique Thai tradition which
has been responsible for the poli
tical independence Thailand has
always maintained.
The Thai have always greeted
foreign cultures with open-mind
edness and a willingness to experi
ment and assimilate. Thus, as con
querors of the Angkor kingdom
in Cambodia in the 14th century
the Thai borrowed heavily from
this culture and the Cambodian
prisoners "became to the Thai as
the Greeks to the Romans — edu
cators of their captors." (Thomas
Fitzsimmons, Th a i I a n d, Its
People, Its Society, Its Culture,
p. 119.)
Conquered for a while in the
16th century by the Burmese, the
Thai assimilated aspects of their
culture. In the 19th century, King
Rama avoided colonialism by
opening the doors of Thailand to
numerous western nationalities
and permitting them to establish
their own communities and to
carry out commercial enterprises
on Thai soil.
RAMA IV was the King of
Anna ami the King of Siam who
realized that colonial protection
might protect one out of all he
owns and so accepted what was
good and gave what he could
without sacrificing Thailand's na
tional integrity.
Historians will be able to record
the first half of the 20th century
in Thailand, as they have the rest,
as a period of cultural borrowing.
The donors this time are the west
ern cultures from whom the di
vine kings borrowed technology j
and sociology.
The most brilliant boys who
were sent to the West also \
brought back the philosophy of J
individual liberty and surprised ;
their monarch by demanding poli-!
tical reforms accompany others. !
Thus, the intelligentsia and thci
military deposed him in 1932.
IN TIIK following two and a
half decades, the Thai experi
mented with a parliamentary
democracy. But the retaining, as
they did, of the king as a consti- i
tutional figurehead was symbolic
of the fact that Thai tradition
could not be ignored; that changes
which would come could only be
assimilations into the culture and
could not be revolutionary. Thus,
the Thai experiments with democ
racy were a farce from a western
viewpoint.
In fact, western students wrote
in 1958:
The salient features of mod-i
ern politics in Thailand are rule
by party and faction; the coup
d'etat as an instrument of
change; absence of ideological!

debate in politics; widespread
public apathy toward politics;
concentration of political life
in the capital city; abuse of
office for personal profit; dis
tortion of western parliamen
tary and electoral forms.
IN 1957 General Sarit Thana
rate. who had been active through
the stormy period of experimenta
tion, staged a coup d'etat and
created the present form of gov
ernment. Acquiescing to the domi
nance of Thai political heritage,
he resurrected the basic assump
tion of autocracy and authoritar
ianism and assimilated only those
democratic institutions whi c h
served to strengthen the basic
political system.
Thus, elections replaced th e
tradition of ceremony surround
; ing the initiation of a new head
of state. Peasants participated in
j them, as they have always par-
I ticipated in national events, at

the command ol' the ruling group
who told them what to do a n d
whom to vote for.
THE LEGISLATURE became
the rubber stamp of the premier's
thoughts and was composed of
his appointees. The body was con
sidered necessary, however, in
furthering the image of tradi
tional government rituals.
To attribute all of the accoutre
ments of democracy presently re
tained in the Thai political sys
tem to the need for show is to be
somewhat misleading, however.
For, there is an urban educated
group and a growing popular
awareness of the meaning of
democracy in Thailand. And
while the politically aware may
be a small minority today, the
I spread of education is likely to
! mean benevolent despotism will
fall in popular esteem in favor
of a more broadly based political
' system.

culture. In the 19th century, King
Rama avoided colonialism by
opening the doors of Thailand to
numerous western nationalities
and permitting them to establish
their own communities and to
carry out commercial enterprises
on Thai soil.
RAMA IV was the King of
Anna ami the King of Siam who
realized that colonial protection
might protect one out of all he
owns and so accepted what was
good and gave what he could
without sacrificing Thailand's na
tional integrity.
Historians will be able to record
the first half of the 20th century
in Thailand, as they have the rest,
as a period of cultural borrowing.
The donors this time are the west
ern cultures from whom the di
vine kings borrowed technology j
and sociology.
The most brilliant boys who
were sent to the West also \
brought back the philosophy of J
individual liberty and surprised ;
their monarch by demanding poli-!
tical reforms accompany others. !
Thus, the intelligentsia and thci
military deposed him in 1932.
IN TIIK following two and a
half decades, the Thai experi
mented with a parliamentary
democracy. But the retaining, as
they did, of the king as a consti- i
tutional figurehead was symbolic
of the fact that Thai tradition
could not be ignored; that changes
which would come could only be
assimilations into the culture and
could not be revolutionary. Thus,
the Thai experiments with democ
racy were a farce from a western
viewpoint.
In fact, western students wrote
in 1958:
The salient features of mod-i
ern politics in Thailand are rule
by party and faction; the coup
d'etat as an instrument of
change; absence of ideological!

debate in politics; widespread
public apathy toward politics;
concentration of political life
in the capital city; abuse of
office for personal profit; dis
tortion of western parliamen
tary and electoral forms.
IN 1957 General Sarit Thana
rate. who had been active through
the stormy period of experimenta
tion, staged a coup d'etat and
created the present form of gov
ernment. Acquiescing to the domi
nance of Thai political heritage,
he resurrected the basic assump
tion of autocracy and authoritar
ianism and assimilated only those
democratic institutions whi c h
served to strengthen the basic
political system.
Thus, elections replaced th e
tradition of ceremony surround
; ing the initiation of a new head
of state. Peasants participated in
j them, as they have always par-
I ticipated in national events, at

the command ol' the ruling group
who told them what to do a n d
whom to vote for.
THE LEGISLATURE became
the rubber stamp of the premier's
thoughts and was composed of
his appointees. The body was con
sidered necessary, however, in
furthering the image of tradi
tional government rituals.
To attribute all of the accoutre
ments of democracy presently re
tained in the Thai political sys
tem to the need for show is to be
somewhat misleading, however.
For, there is an urban educated
group and a growing popular
awareness of the meaning of
democracy in Thailand. And
while the politically aware may
be a small minority today, the
I spread of education is likely to
! mean benevolent despotism will
fall in popular esteem in favor
of a more broadly based political
' system.


THE BUDDHIST INFLUENCE—Buddhism pervades the philosophy
and lives of the majority of the people of mainland Southeast Asia.
While the depth of its reach renders it a potential agent for political
and social change, at present it must be viewed as it has emerged
from the past, as a dominant, open minded but conservative, un
ambitious social philosophy.
"It is the custom of the coun-|
try: when we are told to go and i
vote, we have to do so, a Thai |
peasant is reported to have re
marked. I lis statement is a re
flection of Thai political tradition
and reveals the nature of the pros
ent political system.
For Thailand is unique among
the countries of Southeast Asia
in that it never experienced
colonial rule. And thus the presen'
system is based on the centuriey
old assumption that there are two
distinct political classes: the one
that rules and the one that obeys

system today is not led by the di
vine monarch of the past, but by
a layman premier with authoritar
ian power. As such it reflects an
other unique Thai tradition which
has been responsible for the poli
tical independence Thailand has
always maintained.
The Thai have always greeted
foreign cultures with open-mind
edness and a willingness to experi
ment and assimilate. Thus, as con
querors of the Angkor kingdom
in Cambodia in the 14th century
the Thai borrowed heavily from
this culture and the Cambodian
prisoners "became to the Thai as
the Greeks to the Romans — edu
cators of their captors." (Thomas
Fitzsimmons, Th a i I a n d, Its
People, Its Society, Its Culture,
