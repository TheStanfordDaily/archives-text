# Prince Rules In Cambodia; No 'Guise Of Democracy'
## 
### 
Since Cambodia is governed by Prince Norodem Sihanouk,
regardless of the title lie assumes, the parliamentary system insti
tuted since independence does not function as an instrument tor
national goal information. \<>r is it a product of the national goal,
for Sihanouk, unlike other Southeast Asian dictators, need not

hide behind I lie guise of democ
racy.
He need not because, unlike
most of the others, Cambodian in
dependence was not a result of
nationalist demands of an educat
ed middle class. Rather, it was
a by-product of the Vietnamese
nationalist war against France
and came with the Geneva Agree
ment in 1954. At that time Cam

bodian politics were far less de
veloped than most other South
east Asian nations, and the divine
monarch reigned without ques
tion.
T()I>AV, HOWEVER, Cambo
dian politics are developing from
an authoritarian system to a
broadly-based popular gove r n
ment.
The political system is now
functioning as part of the former,
but il can be expected to serve as
the means for articulation of pop
ular national goals when the na
tion attains a sufficient degree
of political maturity.
The national goal for which
Sihanouk endeavors is to foster
this political development. "You
must remember that the people
will eventually decide the fate of
underdeveloped countries," he
says, and distinguishes himself
from other dictators in not trying
to fight this.
THIS TODAY Sihanouk ap
points the Prime Minister, the
President and the cabinet and
controls 100 per cent of the legis
lature by virtue of his control
over the People's Social Commu
nity Party.
But in so doing, Sihanouk has
carefully avoided creating a rul
ing clique out of touch with the
masses. He has traveled exten
sively in the n a 1 i o n, explaining
government policy and keeping
abreast of the political climate.
Furthermore, Sihanouk has fur
thered the development of poli
tical maturity in Cambodia by
concentrating on the developing of
a good educational system at
home and s ending students
abroad, mostly to France.
In spite of these forward-look
ing policies, Sihanouk has be
come concerned by the commu
nist philosophy being expounded
by Paris students and intellec
tuals. For, while he is anticipating
popular rule, he strongly favors
international neutralism and do
mestic.' political development, inde
pendent of foreign ideology.
Whether this is possible in the
twentieth century is a question
whose answer remains to be seen.

The national goal for which
Sihanouk endeavors is to foster
this political development. "You
must remember that the people
will eventually decide the fate of
underdeveloped countries," he
says, and distinguishes himself
from other dictators in not trying
to fight this.
THIS TODAY Sihanouk ap
points the Prime Minister, the
President and the cabinet and
controls 100 per cent of the legis
lature by virtue of his control
over the People's Social Commu
nity Party.
But in so doing, Sihanouk has
carefully avoided creating a rul
ing clique out of touch with the
masses. He has traveled exten
sively in the n a 1 i o n, explaining
government policy and keeping
abreast of the political climate.
Furthermore, Sihanouk has fur
thered the development of poli
tical maturity in Cambodia by
concentrating on the developing of
a good educational system at
home and s ending students
abroad, mostly to France.
In spite of these forward-look
ing policies, Sihanouk has be
come concerned by the commu
nist philosophy being expounded
by Paris students and intellec
tuals. For, while he is anticipating
popular rule, he strongly favors
international neutralism and do
mestic.' political development, inde
pendent of foreign ideology.
Whether this is possible in the
twentieth century is a question
whose answer remains to be seen.
Since Cambodia is governed by Prince Norodem Sihanouk,
regardless of the title lie assumes, the parliamentary system insti
tuted since independence does not function as an instrument tor
national goal information. \<>r is it a product of the national goal,
for Sihanouk, unlike other Southeast Asian dictators, need not

hide behind I lie guise of democ
racy.
He need not because, unlike
most of the others, Cambodian in
dependence was not a result of
nationalist demands of an educat
ed middle class. Rather, it was
a by-product of the Vietnamese
nationalist war against France
and came with the Geneva Agree
ment in 1954. At that time Cam

bodian politics were far less de
veloped than most other South
east Asian nations, and the divine
monarch reigned without ques
tion.
T()I>AV, HOWEVER, Cambo
dian politics are developing from
an authoritarian system to a
broadly-based popular gove r n
ment.
The political system is now
functioning as part of the former,
but il can be expected to serve as
the means for articulation of pop
ular national goals when the na
tion attains a sufficient degree
of political maturity.
