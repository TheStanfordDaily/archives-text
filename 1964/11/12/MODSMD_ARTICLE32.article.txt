# Sleight, Experience Back; Cardinal's Outlook Good
## 
### 
Three of five starters return
from last year's basketball team
which was runner-up in the
A AWL with a 9-6 record and the
outlook is good, but outstanding

j success will depend on several ifs.
Tom Dose, who led the Indians
last year in scoring with 179
points despite knee injuries, will
Ibe sorely missed. Junior Ray
j Kosanke, who stands 6-9 and
I weighs 232 lbs. and hails from
j Tucson, Ariz., is the replacement
who will try to fill the gap. A
J lung infection sidelined him for
i the beginning of last season. Be-
I hind him are senior Craig Cordes
I ?nd sophomore Brock Gowdy,
j both 6-7.
BATTLING FOR the guard po
sition left vacant by the gradua
tion of Mollis Moore are Gary
j Loveridge, an aggressive player
I who saw limited action last year;
j Rod Young, who red-shirted last
I year; and Tom Nesbit, a .soph-
I omore who averaged 13.5 points
j with the Papooses.
The other three positions are
fixed with captain Clayton Raaka
and Boh Bedell at the forward
position and Kent Hinckley at one
guard. Raaka and Bedell aver
aged 8.2 and 11.6 points per game
respectively, and Hinckley con
tributed an average of 11.8 points
per contest.
These averages are all respect
able but not outstanding and point
to the fact that the Indians this
year will be without the big gun.
Says Coach Howie Dallmar, "With
this type of scoring, the team
will have more balance and of
fensive maneuverability."
DALLMAR HOPES the Indians
can continue to be as tough on
the boards as they have been the
last couple of years. Raaka. only
6-5 but capable of high jumping
several inches over his height,
has the necessary spring and tim
ing to do an excellent rebounding
job. Last year, he led the squad
with 233. He grabbed off 21
missed shots in the final game
against California for a season
high.
Raaka, not only excels in re
bounding, but is called on by
Dallmar each game to defense the
opponent's top scorer in the front
line.
Three problems face th e In
dians this year: speed, reserve
strength, and UCLA. The last is
self-explanatory. Speed, which is
especially crucial at the guard po
sition, will prevent the Indians
from employing the fast break
much and will necessitate a great
deal of switching on defense. The
Indians must be defense-minded
because they will not be able to
gamble and make mistakes and
then hustle back to erase them.
PERHAPS the most critical
problem is reserve strength. Rich
Bilker, a letterman who did an
outstanding job on the boards as
a reserve last year, is red-shirt
i ing this year and will not be avail
able. So behind the starting for
wards are three players with lit -
| tie or no varsity game experience:
I Dick Weaver at 6-4. Bill Farley
jat 6-6. and Jack Gilbert at 6-8.
At the guard position, Dallmar
| can choose among Mike Preisler,
j Skip Hutchinson, and Chris
i Babbs.

will have more balance and of
fensive maneuverability."
DALLMAR HOPES the Indians
can continue to be as tough on
the boards as they have been the
last couple of years. Raaka. only
6-5 but capable of high jumping
several inches over his height,
has the necessary spring and tim
ing to do an excellent rebounding
job. Last year, he led the squad
with 233. He grabbed off 21
missed shots in the final game
against California for a season
high.
Raaka, not only excels in re
bounding, but is called on by
Dallmar each game to defense the
opponent's top scorer in the front
line.
Three problems face th e In
dians this year: speed, reserve
strength, and UCLA. The last is
self-explanatory. Speed, which is
especially crucial at the guard po
sition, will prevent the Indians
from employing the fast break
much and will necessitate a great
deal of switching on defense. The
Indians must be defense-minded
because they will not be able to
gamble and make mistakes and
then hustle back to erase them.
PERHAPS the most critical
problem is reserve strength. Rich
Bilker, a letterman who did an
outstanding job on the boards as
a reserve last year, is red-shirt
i ing this year and will not be avail
able. So behind the starting for
wards are three players with lit -
| tie or no varsity game experience:
I Dick Weaver at 6-4. Bill Farley
jat 6-6. and Jack Gilbert at 6-8.
At the guard position, Dallmar
| can choose among Mike Preisler,
j Skip Hutchinson, and Chris
i Babbs.
Three of five starters return
from last year's basketball team
which was runner-up in the
A AWL with a 9-6 record and the
outlook is good, but outstanding

j success will depend on several ifs.
Tom Dose, who led the Indians
last year in scoring with 179
points despite knee injuries, will
Ibe sorely missed. Junior Ray
j Kosanke, who stands 6-9 and
I weighs 232 lbs. and hails from
j Tucson, Ariz., is the replacement
who will try to fill the gap. A
J lung infection sidelined him for
i the beginning of last season. Be-
I hind him are senior Craig Cordes
I ?nd sophomore Brock Gowdy,
j both 6-7.
BATTLING FOR the guard po
sition left vacant by the gradua
tion of Mollis Moore are Gary
j Loveridge, an aggressive player
I who saw limited action last year;
j Rod Young, who red-shirted last
I year; and Tom Nesbit, a .soph-
I omore who averaged 13.5 points
j with the Papooses.
The other three positions are
fixed with captain Clayton Raaka
and Boh Bedell at the forward
position and Kent Hinckley at one
guard. Raaka and Bedell aver
aged 8.2 and 11.6 points per game
respectively, and Hinckley con
tributed an average of 11.8 points
per contest.
These averages are all respect
able but not outstanding and point
to the fact that the Indians this
year will be without the big gun.
Says Coach Howie Dallmar, "With
this type of scoring, the team
will have more balance and of
fensive maneuverability."
