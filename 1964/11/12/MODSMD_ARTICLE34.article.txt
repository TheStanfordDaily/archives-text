## Tribe Tough On Oregon; Handley Will Set Record 
### PETE EAKLAND 
On its schedule Stanford has almost as many nemeses as the num
ber ol' Mets-killers, pitchers who are undefeated against New York's
pride and grief. Southern Cal has had the winning touch against the
Indians for the last seven years, Washington State ran its string to
eight this year, and Washington won foi the sixth consecutive time
several weeks ago. Before bowing to the Cards, the Oregon Ducks
had a seven game streak going. Oregon State hasn't lost to a Stan
ford eleven since 1961.
The trend is evident. Take the states one at a time. We came
within angstroms of defeating Washington State, Washington, UCLA,
and USC bui we really aren't too worried about this. California (with
the exception of our neighbor acros the bay) and Washington can
wait till the next two years. Oregon is the state chosen to receive
the brunt of the tomahawk-wielding Indians this year. We knocked
Oregon from the undefeated ranks with an overwhelming 10-8 vic
tory (if such a thing exists). Oregon Stale has boon nice enough to
mature to the same state of over-confidence that the Ducks had.
After an initial loss to Northwestern, they have since compiled seven
consecutive wins. The most impressive are a 9-7 win over Washing
ton, a 31-14 pasting of Syracuse, and a 24-14 win over Indiana. But
all these wins were on home territory.
THE CRY Saturday will be "Smother Brothers." Paul Brothers,
the talented quarterback of OSU, may well get the same type of
treatment given his Oregon counterpart, Bob Berry.

The Reno ripper, Ray Handley, who currently has a net yardage
total of 723 yards in 145 carries for a 5.0 average, will break Stan
ford's "rushing record" if he can average better than sixty yards in
the two remaining games.
During the Second World War when Don Liebendorfer, sports
publicist, was on leave of absence from his duties at the Farm, all
statistics were somehow lost. Liebendorfer says that Ernie Nevers
and Bobby Grayson undoubtedly rambled for more than a 1,000 yards,
but there is no proof. So the leading ground gainer (Roger Maris
wasn't the first to get the asterisk treatment) in Stanford history for
one season is Chuek Shea, a left halfback on the 1957 eleven.
IN THAT YEAK Shea compiled a net of 840 yards on 163 carries
and a 5.15 average. And on a Jack Curtice football team! His teams
only stopped passing when the quarterback's throwing arm was tired.
Shea's rise to stardom was a quick one. In 1956, he carried the ball
only 17 times. The 1957 pressbook called him "a slashing type ol
runner who has showed flashes of real class but has never been con
sistent. Chuck wants to play and can help the Indians if he steadies
down a little."
In different terms, the 1961 pressbook shows Ray Handley, a
second stringer last year but Stanford's third leading rusher. "A
fine running back who makes few mistakes, he is a real workhorse
and may develop into a full-fledged star." Both rose from relative
obscurity to stardom in one short year. The statements show the rea
son for the quick change: latent ability and desire.
