# The 						Purpose Of The Fast
## 
### 
The deadline is quickly approaching for sign
ups for the Fast for Freedom, scheduled to take
place next Thursday, but there still exists con
siderable confusion about what exactly the proj
ect intends to accomplish. As a result, full effec
tiveness of the program may be sacrificed.
A good many students, ourselves included,
have been led to believe that it is primarily a
fund-raising project to help hungry Mississippi
Negro families during the long winter.
Actually, tlu* Fast for Freedom is intended
primarilv to be a demonstration — l>v as mam
as 100.000 students across the nation — of a com
mitment to relieving the general conditions of
racial discrimination as they exist in Mississippi
and elsewhere.
\s (,'hirles Mcßrian, associate campus coor
dinator o| \S.\, states: "These people aren't
doing it lor money. This is a fast for them. The
fast is a classical form of expression of dedica
tion.
This emphasis on the expression of commit
ment to the cause of civil rights is admirable.

But many students, seeing it as a money-raising
effort, are planning to skip their dinner, only
to have a hamburger at the Union or send out
for pizza. In short, many do not intend to fast
at all.
What has not been brought out is that,
though students pay from $1 to $1.50 for their
dinners, only about 50 cents will be saved by the
Food Service for each meal not eaten. The only
money saved will be the raw food costs, while
hashers and stall must still be paid.
Thus students wishing to contribute money
and who plan to eat anyw.iy will do far better
to eat at the dormitory and contribute 81 to the
civil rights movement, than to forego their meal
and, by doing so, contribute less than 50 cents.
We hope that the Fast lor Freedom is a suc
cess. and that an understanding by the students
of its purpose w ill help it achieve maximum effec
tiveness. Those who wish to demonstrate their
commitment I>\ lasting should do so. Hut those
u ho just want to give money should not do it I>\
skipping a meal. That will waste more monev
than it will contribute.
