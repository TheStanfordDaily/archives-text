### DEAN JAMISON 
Ki")n'Ol'S NOTK: The following are excerpts
from a raMier lengthy letter containing Mr. Jami
son's impressions of the Mississippi Project gath
ered while lie was working in the Mock Election.
. . . Mv cousin was working out of Ifoily Springs,
too. But the police had him when I arrived. He
got sj.i ung and we started work together the next
day. We went from floor to door urging people
to register and vote in the mock election. We
tracked town Negro leaders and convinced them
of the importance of what we were doing, pleaded
for their aid. allayed their fears. The votes piled
up.
On Sunday we spoke in the churches, put a bal
lot box by the door and reaped the votes. It wasn't
very much like a regular election.
. . . The COFO headquarters was a busy place.
People hurried, didn't talk much, didn't smile.
Things are bad for the Mississippi Negro; Civil
Rights workers don't have time to sit and-shoot
the breeze. They don't even have much time to
think. This was obvious.
My cousin and I like to ask questions. Exactly
what are the objectives of the Freedom Election?
What arc alternative methods of gaining these
objectives? Why is your election so sloppily run?
(I pointed to the box where the Negro was to

mark his X dozens of times.) What does ihe free
dom vote measure"-' Why don't you care about
the law; Why don't you use violence"- Why, why,
why ■
We didn't hear many good answers. We rareiv
found a systematic, analytic approach. An ap
proach which explicitly .listed objectives and
examined the extent to which they were incom
patible, an approach which somehow attempted
to allocate scarce human, financial, legal, and
intellectual resources to realize to the greatest
possible extent the objectives established.
Some people through! that our analytic ap
proach was heartless, that we didn't care about
the Negroes. I think it's heartless not to attempt
to use the resources available to the civil rights
movement in the most effective manner.
The gratitude of the Negroes I registered and
helped to vote for the first time amply repaid
my journey south. I learned a lot about poverty
and people and the value of analysis. As I headed
north again to Memphis, I was more convinced
than ever, that every American should "enjoy
the privilege of being American without regard
to his race or color."
But I was sadly disappointed with the civil
rights movement. Unless it more effectively
utilizes the resources at its disposal, what should
be and what shall be will remain two.

objectives? Why is your election so sloppily run?
(I pointed to the box where the Negro was to

mark his X dozens of times.) What does ihe free
dom vote measure"-' Why don't you care about
the law; Why don't you use violence"- Why, why,
why ■
We didn't hear many good answers. We rareiv
found a systematic, analytic approach. An ap
proach which explicitly .listed objectives and
examined the extent to which they were incom
patible, an approach which somehow attempted
to allocate scarce human, financial, legal, and
intellectual resources to realize to the greatest
possible extent the objectives established.
Some people through! that our analytic ap
proach was heartless, that we didn't care about
the Negroes. I think it's heartless not to attempt
to use the resources available to the civil rights
movement in the most effective manner.
The gratitude of the Negroes I registered and
helped to vote for the first time amply repaid
my journey south. I learned a lot about poverty
and people and the value of analysis. As I headed
north again to Memphis, I was more convinced
than ever, that every American should "enjoy
the privilege of being American without regard
to his race or color."
But I was sadly disappointed with the civil
rights movement. Unless it more effectively
utilizes the resources at its disposal, what should
be and what shall be will remain two.
Ki")n'Ol'S NOTK: The following are excerpts
from a raMier lengthy letter containing Mr. Jami
son's impressions of the Mississippi Project gath
ered while lie was working in the Mock Election.
. . . Mv cousin was working out of Ifoily Springs,
too. But the police had him when I arrived. He
got sj.i ung and we started work together the next
day. We went from floor to door urging people
to register and vote in the mock election. We
tracked town Negro leaders and convinced them
of the importance of what we were doing, pleaded
for their aid. allayed their fears. The votes piled
up.
On Sunday we spoke in the churches, put a bal
lot box by the door and reaped the votes. It wasn't
very much like a regular election.
. . . The COFO headquarters was a busy place.
People hurried, didn't talk much, didn't smile.
Things are bad for the Mississippi Negro; Civil
Rights workers don't have time to sit and-shoot
the breeze. They don't even have much time to
think. This was obvious.
My cousin and I like to ask questions. Exactly
what are the objectives of the Freedom Election?
What arc alternative methods of gaining these
objectives? Why is your election so sloppily run?
