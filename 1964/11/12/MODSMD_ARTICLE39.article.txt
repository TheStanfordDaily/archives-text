## Nazi Horror Can Happen Here 
### 
Dear Sir:
Unfortunately 1 did not have
sufficient space in my first letter
to explain why I think Rockwell
should not be allowed to make
his views public. The basis of my
opinion is a clearly documented
period in history from 1919 to
194.-5.
Hitler started out much as
Rockwell is starting now, with
a very small solid following, but
with the availability of a very
large audience guaranteed by
"Freedom of Spech" in the Wei
mar Constitution. From the
small following and large audi
ence Hitler gained the support
he needed. We all know the con
sequences.

| I don't expect that more than
a few actually sympathize with
Rockwell's ideas now. However,
everyone who has been subjected
! to Rockwell's ideas may at some
future time (when social condi
tions are different) look back and
say, "Maybe he was right; may
be we should have taken him seri
ously then." And therein lies the
j danger.
It is possible to conceive of a
situation not far off when we
I may sec the United States play
j ing the roll of Nazi Germany.
I Perhaps there will not be enough
I Jews to persecute but there
i will be Negroes. Perhaps Rock
> well will propose a Final Solu-
I tion to the race riots and civil

rights disorders. If riots get
much bloodier this Final Solu
tion may begin to appeal to the
White majority the backlash.
And many more millions of
men may have to die to save the
world from Nazi America, be
cause we refused to learn from
history.
The loss in civil liberties for
the Nazis is a very small price
to pay for the possible preven
tion of a recurrence of World
War 11, but this time with nu
clear repercussions. Atlhough the
chances of it happening here are
slight, the end in this case justi
fies the means.
