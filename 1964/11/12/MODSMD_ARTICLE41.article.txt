# Today and Tomorrow
## Johnson Free To Follow Own Policy judgments 
### Walter Lippmann 
Thanks to tin* kind of \ ictory he has won, President Lyndon
Johnson can now look lorward to a stretch ol time when he has
a license to follow his own judgment, Iree from partisan politics,
lie is free not only because the size ol his majority is .in enormous
\ote ol confidence in him personally but also because a principal

element of the landslide was the*
rejection of extremism at home
and abroad.
As soon as the votes are!
counted, a newly elected Presi-j
dent is beset by tactions in the,
bureaucracy which have their
special causes ;uid their pet proj
ects to promote. They tell the,
Presidem that during the cam
paign many things in foreign af
fairs had to be postponed. Now
that lie has won, lie must reach
immediate decisions and move,
prompt ly.
Hureacratic Pressures

have inves ;\1 personally in their!
projects. , e effect of yield-!
ing to the.i .u. is.eiK .■ would be'
to tie • lir* -resident's hands be-1
fore he has had a chance to make |
use ol tlie unique opportunity to!
take a fresh look which his elec-:
lion gives him.
President John Kennedy was a j
victim of these bureaucratic pres-1
sures, and in yielding to them he
came near to wrecking his ad
ministration at the outset. Presi-1
dent Johnson in 19(>4 is in a much j
stronger position than was Presi-j
dent Kennedy after his election in
1960. For President Kennedy had
not yet acquired enough self con
fidence in the White House and
he was acutely aware of the
frailty of his majority.
He did not feel that he was free.
That is why President Kennedy
acquiesced, though with doubt
and a bad conscience, in the crazy
project of the Bay of Pigs. That
is why he allowed himself to be
come extensively and deeply com
mitted in South Vietnam than
President Dwight Eisenhower had
ever been. That is why at the out
set he adopted without reserve
the Dulles-Adenauer line on the
two Germanys and on relations
with the Soviet Union.
Johnson's Opportunity
For President Kennedy never
had the opportunity which Presi
dent Johnson now has, which is
to review deliberately what cornes
up to the White House from the
State Department and the Penta
gon.
It is already apparent that
President Johnson will be under
pressure from various bureau
cratic lobbies promoting the sale
of their projects. One of the
characteristics of the bureaucra
tic lobbies is that they redouble
their pressures when their proj
ects run into trouble.
The bureaucratic lobbies will!

♦
all be in a hurry. They will teli
j the President that Europe is in
disarray and that the President
: must act at once to set Europe
in order. They will tell him that
Asia is in chaos and thai unless
! the President acts at once, the
Chinese will drive the Americans
, back to San Francisco and be
: vond.
Luxury Of A New Look
The bureaucratic lobbies will
all be pressing the President to
' forego his most precious right,
which is to get out of the ruts
j and unsnarl the tangles w hi c h
| come from a quite different past.
! Surely Ihe first business of a
President elected with such a ma
! jority after sue i a campaign is to
enjoy the luxury of taking a new
! look at the national interest, and
j of making a fresh judgment of
' the workability of policies.
In this unique time when par
tisan politics is adjourned, when
j the aii' is no longer filled w i th
| campaign slogans, there can be
I an unhurried and calm re-exami
i nation of how to fulfill our com
j mitments in South Vietnam, of
| such projects as the mixed
manned nuclear fleet (MLF)
which is the brainchild of profes
sors miscast as military strate
gists, on our antiquated China
policy, our obsolescent German
policy, our confused European
policy.
In this whole field, President
Johnson will never again be so
free as he is now to do what is
right and damn the torpedoes.

President John Kennedy was a j
victim of these bureaucratic pres-1
sures, and in yielding to them he
came near to wrecking his ad
ministration at the outset. Presi-1
dent Johnson in 19(>4 is in a much j
stronger position than was Presi-j
dent Kennedy after his election in
1960. For President Kennedy had
not yet acquired enough self con
fidence in the White House and
he was acutely aware of the
frailty of his majority.
He did not feel that he was free.
That is why President Kennedy
acquiesced, though with doubt
and a bad conscience, in the crazy
project of the Bay of Pigs. That
is why he allowed himself to be
come extensively and deeply com
mitted in South Vietnam than
President Dwight Eisenhower had
ever been. That is why at the out
set he adopted without reserve
the Dulles-Adenauer line on the
two Germanys and on relations
with the Soviet Union.
Johnson's Opportunity
For President Kennedy never
had the opportunity which Presi
dent Johnson now has, which is
to review deliberately what cornes
up to the White House from the
State Department and the Penta
gon.
It is already apparent that
President Johnson will be under
pressure from various bureau
cratic lobbies promoting the sale
of their projects. One of the
characteristics of the bureaucra
tic lobbies is that they redouble
their pressures when their proj
ects run into trouble.
The bureaucratic lobbies will!

: must act at once to set Europe
in order. They will tell him that
Asia is in chaos and thai unless

Chinese will drive the Americans

Thanks to tin* kind of \ ictory he has won, President Lyndon
Johnson can now look lorward to a stretch ol time when he has
a license to follow his own judgment, Iree from partisan politics,
lie is free not only because the size ol his majority is .in enormous
\ote ol confidence in him personally but also because a principal

element of the landslide was the*
rejection of extremism at home
and abroad.
As soon as the votes are!
counted, a newly elected Presi-j
dent is beset by tactions in the,
bureaucracy which have their
special causes ;uid their pet proj
ects to promote. They tell the,
Presidem that during the cam
paign many things in foreign af
fairs had to be postponed. Now
that lie has won, lie must reach
immediate decisions and move,
prompt ly.
Hureacratic Pressures
Tiiese .res on the Presi :
dvMit coi .e i >:n sincere men who \
have inves ;\1 personally in their!
projects. , e effect of yield-!
ing to the.i .u. is.eiK .■ would be'
to tie • lir* -resident's hands be-1
fore he has had a chance to make |
use ol tlie unique opportunity to!
take a fresh look which his elec-:
lion gives him.
President John Kennedy was a j
victim of these bureaucratic pres-1
sures, and in yielding to them he
came near to wrecking his ad
ministration at the outset. Presi-1
dent Johnson in 19(>4 is in a much j
stronger position than was Presi-j
dent Kennedy after his election in
1960. For President Kennedy had
not yet acquired enough self con
fidence in the White House and
he was acutely aware of the
frailty of his majority.
He did not feel that he was free.
That is why President Kennedy
acquiesced, though with doubt
and a bad conscience, in the crazy
project of the Bay of Pigs. That
is why he allowed himself to be
come extensively and deeply com
mitted in South Vietnam than
President Dwight Eisenhower had
ever been. That is why at the out
set he adopted without reserve
the Dulles-Adenauer line on the
two Germanys and on relations
with the Soviet Union.
Johnson's Opportunity
For President Kennedy never
had the opportunity which Presi
dent Johnson now has, which is
to review deliberately what cornes
up to the White House from the
State Department and the Penta
gon.
It is already apparent that
President Johnson will be under
pressure from various bureau
cratic lobbies promoting the sale
of their projects. One of the
characteristics of the bureaucra
tic lobbies is that they redouble
their pressures when their proj
ects run into trouble.
The bureaucratic lobbies will!

♦
all be in a hurry. They will teli
j the President that Europe is in
disarray and that the President
: must act at once to set Europe
in order. They will tell him that
Asia is in chaos and thai unless
! the President acts at once, the
Chinese will drive the Americans
, back to San Francisco and be
: vond.
Luxury Of A New Look
The bureaucratic lobbies will
all be pressing the President to
' forego his most precious right,
which is to get out of the ruts
j and unsnarl the tangles w hi c h
