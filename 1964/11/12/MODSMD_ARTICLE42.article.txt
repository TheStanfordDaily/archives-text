# ART REVIEW
## Farmer's Paintings Show Rare Directness, Warmth 
### DUNCAN McCANDLESS 
Currently on display in the
Stanford art gallery are the paint
ings oil and watercolor — of
Professor Edward Farmer.
The paintings of this retrospec*
I live exhibit have all been execut
! Ed since 1936 and the sequence
from that time to the present is
undisturbed by sudden stylistic
changes or migratory innova
tions; nor do the paintings them
selves register protests or docu
ment a "trend." There is only a
subtle softening evident in the
paintings of more recent vintage
; and, too, a deeper involvement
! with, and commitment to, nature.
A painter of landscapes, of trees
and flowers, and, more distantly,
of unusual still-life assemblages,
Prof. Farmer has sought to ar
ticulate what he sees with an
exactness that is not stringent
and a vision that is not common
j place.
He attends the distant and min
; lite, the shadows and shades, witli
\ the same care and intensity with
| which ho approaches the general
(and over-all. Chance or accident
share no pari in his work.
Two watercolors. "Derelicts"
•nd "Salt Harvest," and an oil
'»112 "Shells" exemplify this control,
a control complete and confident
and.it would seem, capable only
of warm expression.
Perhaps the most conspicuous
characteristic of Prof. Farmer's
r>:-iniings is the quality of light
"fused into each of them, the
ight and atmosphere of weather,
•>l times of day, of coming storms
or morning mists; for in each
painting a particular mood is
shaped by a particular condition
of nature.
"Inverness Dawn" and "Inver
ness Sunset," two oils of the same
;< ene at opposite ends of the day.
ire especially illustrative of this
ability to create, from an ob
served natural phenomenon of

, limited duration, a physical rec
ord of the event which can, in
I turn, reproduce in the viewer a
response similar to that had by
the artist.
To Prof. Farmer it is the mood,
the atmosphere, the feeling con
veyed in a finished painting that
is most valid. There ait> no dis
tinct brushstrokes to describe the
method nor any obvious technical
devices to immediately betray the
means.
Close inspection simply ampli
fies what is seen at a distance;
colors fuse together gathering
light from subtle mutation rather
than from the startling juxtapo
sition of lights and darks; and
forms subjected to point-blank
scrutiny do not disintegrate.
Because Prof. Farmer has been,
in the words of Prof. Daniel Men
delowitz, unfailingly loyal to his
own "particular vision of beauty,"
one's visual contact with liis
paintings is intellectually uncom
plicated, for the eye communi
cates directly with the senses
i rather than being engaged in a
; merely intellectual experience be
yond its ocular function.
This directness of communica
i lion is becoming increasingly rare
in contemporary art and it is pri
marily for this reason that one
can readily recommend this ex
hibit to the Stanford community.

Perhaps the most conspicuous
characteristic of Prof. Farmer's

ability to create, from an ob

, limited duration, a physical rec
ord of the event which can, in
I turn, reproduce in the viewer a
response similar to that had by
the artist.
To Prof. Farmer it is the mood,
the atmosphere, the feeling con
veyed in a finished painting that
is most valid. There ait> no dis
tinct brushstrokes to describe the
method nor any obvious technical
devices to immediately betray the
means.
Close inspection simply ampli
fies what is seen at a distance;
colors fuse together gathering
light from subtle mutation rather
than from the startling juxtapo
sition of lights and darks; and
forms subjected to point-blank
scrutiny do not disintegrate.
Because Prof. Farmer has been,
in the words of Prof. Daniel Men
delowitz, unfailingly loyal to his
own "particular vision of beauty,"
one's visual contact with liis
paintings is intellectually uncom
plicated, for the eye communi
cates directly with the senses
i rather than being engaged in a
; merely intellectual experience be
yond its ocular function.
This directness of communica
i lion is becoming increasingly rare
in contemporary art and it is pri
marily for this reason that one
can readily recommend this ex
hibit to the Stanford community.
Currently on display in the
Stanford art gallery are the paint

Professor Edward Farmer.
The paintings of this retrospec*
I live exhibit have all been execut
! Ed since 1936 and the sequence
from that time to the present is
undisturbed by sudden stylistic
changes or migratory innova
tions; nor do the paintings them
selves register protests or docu
ment a "trend." There is only a
subtle softening evident in the
paintings of more recent vintage
; and, too, a deeper involvement
! with, and commitment to, nature.
A painter of landscapes, of trees
and flowers, and, more distantly,
of unusual still-life assemblages,
Prof. Farmer has sought to ar
ticulate what he sees with an
exactness that is not stringent
and a vision that is not common
j place.
He attends the distant and min
; lite, the shadows and shades, witli
\ the same care and intensity with
| which ho approaches the general
(and over-all. Chance or accident
share no pari in his work.
