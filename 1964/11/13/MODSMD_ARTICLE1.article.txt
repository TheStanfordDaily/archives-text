• I'.S. Defense Lend Dwindling
LONDON America's strategic military
superiority over the Soviet Union dramati
cally increased in recent years is likely to
narrow in the future.
In its annual review of the comparative
fighting strengths of the East and West mili
tary blocs and the uncommitted nations, the
institute of Strategic Studies reported that
the Soviet Union now fields 200 interconti
nental ballistic missiles ICMBS double the
figure of a year ago. This may increase sub
stantially in 1965.
But by early 1965, the United States will
have 925 ICMBS as against 715 a year earlier
thus retaining a lead of more than 4-to-l
over the U.S.S.R., the ISS report said.
But then it added:
"However, this may be the last year in
which the Western superiority in long-range
striking power is so marked the American

ICMB program becomes substantially com
pleted next year, and the Soviet missile build
up may continue under Kosygin and Brezhnev
the Soviet Union's new leaders."
• Floods Strike In \ ie.t Nam
DA NANG - The most disastrous floods in
(jij years have drowned 5,000 or more persons
in the north of Saigon and dealt a severe
blow to the war on the Communist guerrillas,
officials said yesterday.
With roads, bridges and railways washed
away, a U.S. military adviser declared:
"This flood has hurt our communications
more than thousands of tons of Viet Cong
explosives could have done."
Rebuilding the roads and railroads pre
sented an enormous problem to a nation where
already the Viet Cong stage daring strikes at
the doorstep of Saigon.
"To rebuild all this," a U.S. adviser said,
"will take large engineer units.
"If the Viet Cong tries to interfere with

this work, very large numbers of security
troops will have to be brought in to secure
the engineers. As it is, we're very short of
troops anyway. This in turn could lie damag
ing to other areas, if we have to divert troops
here."
• Per on May Return
BUENOS AIRES — Tire government put
the armed forces on alert yesterday as rumors
spread that former dictator Juan D. Peron
was on his way here from exile.
But police in Madrid, Spain, where Peron
has been living, said he was still there. A
rumor that he had landed at Lima, Peru, also
was denied.
The alert, coupled with other security

measures, followed a predawn cabinet meet
ing at the home of President Arturo lllia.
Unconfirmed reports that Peron hal left Spain
reached the government "through two differ
ent channels," official sources said.
Despite the denials, nervousness prevailed
in official circles here throughout the day.
• II ilson Seeks Credit Change
LONDON — Prime Minister Harold Wil
son intends to ask President Johnson's sup
port for a vast new system of international
credit, British informants reported last night.
The plan being shaped up by the Labor
government aims at staving off what Wilson
sees as the peril of a world slump.
Wilson will visit Johnson in Washington
Dec. 7 and 8. Informed sources said they plan
a second meeting early next year.
A major purpose is to swap ideas about
the reorganization of the Atlantic alliance
with emphasis on future nuclear weapons
management. But the economic difficulties

lacing the non-Communist world, particularly
Europe — are due for thorough airing.
The British leader was portrayed as being
convinced urgent international discussions
leading to a world economic conference at
the summit level are needed.
