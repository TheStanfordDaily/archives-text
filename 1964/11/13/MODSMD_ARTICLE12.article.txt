## Senate Freezes NSA Dues Money 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE Feature Editor 
The University of California
at Berkeley may disaffiliate itsell
Iroin the National Student Asso
ciation (NSA), reliable sources
there reported yesterday.
Action is expected to occur in
the wake of an official policy
statement released by NSA con
demning (lie recent student dem
onstrations.
THE STATEMENT, however,
supports tho actions of the stu
dent-faculty committee and "all
students . . . who responsibly seek
recognition of their freedoms to
advocate, persuade, solicit, re
cruit, and plan activities for stu
dent political and social organiza
tions on campus."
Phil Sher'iurn. NSA National
Affairs Vice-President spent foui
days on the U.C. campus immedi
ately following the riots in Octo
ber.
The statement was read to the
Student Senalc during its meet
ing last Tuesday and reportedly
excited considerable animosity
toward NSA among the students
present. The Senate approved a
restraining order stopping pay
ment of the NSA dues for this
yea r.
ACTION ON a motion censur
ing the NSA was postponed until
the following week's meeting.
A motion was also proposed to
disassociate U.C. from the policy
statement, but no action was tak
en on it.
CARL .JAC OBS, NSA coordi
nator at Cal reported that inter
est in NSA at U.C. had been low
for several years and this incident
would probably bring matters to
a head.
According to Jacobs, a motion
to disaffiliate the University from
NSA seems imminent at the next
Student Senate meeting.
A constitutional amendment will
he required to accomplish the dis
affiliation, and all amendments
must he approved by two-thirds
of the student body. To be placed
on the ballot for the December
elections the amendments must
be passed by the Student Senate
at this Tuesday's meeting (No
vember 171.
This will require direct action
on the hill rather than a referral
to Committee as is standard
practice. However Jacobs felt
that approval by both the Senate
and the student body was likely.
"It looks like now we'll be out of
NSA by the end of the year," he
commented.
