# Playing God
## 
### 
Recently Newsweek's science editor reviewed the giant strides which bio
chemists have made toward understanding the mechanisms of heredity. He
said in part, "The first time man changed the destiny of a living organism
by implanting it with the genetic material from another, a Noble prize-win
ning scientist called the achievement 'playing God for real.' "
Man's knowledge of the universe indeed has increased during the present
century even as the Bible has predicted: "... even to the time of the end:
many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased." (Daniel 12:4).
But rather than giving God thanks and credit for the knowledge he has at
tained, man is forever claiming the praise for himself. Without perhaps being
so bold as to admit it, many individuals set themselves up as their own god
and refuse to allow the true and living God to rule in their hearts. Such
behavior is also in full accord with the predictions of Scripture. "... when
they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but
became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools . . . and worshipped
and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever." (Ro
mans 1:21, 25)
Men who play God are, consciously or unconsciously, in rebellion against
Him. Rebellion in His universe is tolerated only for finite times by a Sovereign
and righteous God who gave the Jews this First Great Commandment in the
early history of their nation: "I am the Lord thy God which have brought
thee out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other
gods before me." (Exodus 20:1-3).
If you are one of those individuals who have lost sight of the fact that
God is your Creator and the Giver of knowledge, repent today and turn
away from this unbelief. Humble yourself and acknowledge your dependence
on God for everything you have, all that He has given you, all that you
possess. You can in this way meet and know God through Jesus Christ His
Son. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved" is the assur
ance of the New Testament and the experience of millions. Your acknowledg
ment of Jesus Christ as Lord will make it quite unnecessary for you to pre
tend you are something more than you really are inside, and quite unneces
sary for you to seek answers outside the resources of Christ in you, which
God gives freely to all those who seek Him!

Him. Rebellion in His universe is tolerated only for finite times by a Sovereign
and righteous God who gave the Jews this First Great Commandment in the
early history of their nation: "I am the Lord thy God which have brought
thee out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other
gods before me." (Exodus 20:1-3).
If you are one of those individuals who have lost sight of the fact that
God is your Creator and the Giver of knowledge, repent today and turn
away from this unbelief. Humble yourself and acknowledge your dependence
on God for everything you have, all that He has given you, all that you
possess. You can in this way meet and know God through Jesus Christ His
Son. "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved" is the assur
ance of the New Testament and the experience of millions. Your acknowledg
ment of Jesus Christ as Lord will make it quite unnecessary for you to pre
tend you are something more than you really are inside, and quite unneces
sary for you to seek answers outside the resources of Christ in you, which
God gives freely to all those who seek Him!

Recently Newsweek's science editor reviewed the giant strides which bio
chemists have made toward understanding the mechanisms of heredity. He
said in part, "The first time man changed the destiny of a living organism
by implanting it with the genetic material from another, a Noble prize-win
ning scientist called the achievement 'playing God for real.' "
Man's knowledge of the universe indeed has increased during the present
century even as the Bible has predicted: "... even to the time of the end:
many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased." (Daniel 12:4).
But rather than giving God thanks and credit for the knowledge he has at
tained, man is forever claiming the praise for himself. Without perhaps being
so bold as to admit it, many individuals set themselves up as their own god
and refuse to allow the true and living God to rule in their hearts. Such
behavior is also in full accord with the predictions of Scripture. "... when
they knew God, they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful; but
became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools . . . and worshipped
and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever." (Ro
mans 1:21, 25)
Men who play God are, consciously or unconsciously, in rebellion against
Him. Rebellion in His universe is tolerated only for finite times by a Sovereign
and righteous God who gave the Jews this First Great Commandment in the
early history of their nation: "I am the Lord thy God which have brought
thee out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other
gods before me." (Exodus 20:1-3).
