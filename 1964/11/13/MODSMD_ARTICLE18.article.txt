# Driftwood Singers Have Good Blend
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
The Driftwood Singers, the
I folksinging trio currently at the
| Tangent, have only been singing
together since August. But in this
j short lime they have acquired
! thai most vital ingredient for a
j singing group- good vocal blend.
Recently at the Hungry i in
San Francisco, they are scheduled
I at the Tangent this weekend and
j next weekend.
THEItt SONGS cover a wide
range, varying from the Bob Dy
i lan protest "The Times They Are
! A Changing" to the blues of "Cool
Colorado" and the satirically topi
j cal "The Ten Days Of Peacetime"
I (sample lyric: "On the third day
lof peacetime my government
j said to me: 'Fallout doesn't hurt,
1 Sputnik's just a gimmick, and we
won't have a World War Three.' ")
Other songs in their show are
the pulsating "Old 'Frisco,"
"Daddy's Coming Home" and the
beautiful "The Midnight Special."
In addition, they intersperse their
songs with amusing and interest
i ing stories.
They accompany themselves on
j guitar and a harmonica-like in
j strument called the huarp which,
according to group leader Bill
j Roberts, is "used to get a blues
I sound."
! ALTHOUGH they at times re
semble some other well-known
folksinging groups, this young
group has a distinctive sound and
style of its own and should do
very well in the future.
j Also on the program is wander
ing minstrel (and Tangent man
j ager) Buddy Bohn. Bohn has a
j pleasant voice and sings selections
! from a repetoire picked up while
traveling around iho world.
Bohn's songs tend toward the
light side, such as "Away, Away
With Rum By Gum" and "Th c
j Persian Kitty." But he also in
! eludes the well-known Stan Wil
son song "Jane, Jane" and an
Australian calypso "A Bunch of
Bananas and a Bottle of Gin."
But it is his non-vocal selections
which are most outstanding: his
flamenco numbers are excellent.
At least once a night he plays the
classic "Malaguena," which may
well be the most famous piece of
music ever written for the guitar
— and justifiably so. In the hands
of a really good guitarist, it can
be both tender and thrilling. And
Bohn does it full justice.
