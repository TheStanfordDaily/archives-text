## 'Guys & Dolls' Worth Telling Friends About 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
In his after-the-curtain speech
at Tuesday's opening of "Guys
and Dolls," star Dan Dailey told
the audience thai if they liked it
they should tell their friends.
Since the entire audience- this
reviewer included was having a
I ball, it seems a fairly safe bet
| that this fifth presentation at the
Hyatt House Theatre will be
playing to packed houses during
its two week run.
"GUYS AM) DOLLS," the
classic musical for which Jo
Swel ling and Abe Burrows wrote
the book and Frank Loesser sup
! plied the music and lyrics, is
I fashioned from the stories and
characters who inhabited the
i Broadway of Damon Runyon, Al
though written in 1950, its tale
of gamblers, showgirls and mis
sionaries is, surprisingly, in no
way dated.
The cast, with only minor ex
ceptions, is exceptional. Dailey
; plays Sky Masterson, the free-
I wheeling gambler who falls in
! love with a missionary, and he
: plays it very well indeed. He has
(done the role many times before
and his ease in the part is evi-
I dent, but unfortunately lie rushes
his lines a bit too much in the
I opening scenes.
Marilyn Maxwell co-stars as
Miss Adelaide, one of the great
i dumb blondes of iho theater.
Whether chastising her fiance for
i the length of their engagement
■14 years or throwing flowers to
the audience in the marvelously
I inane "A Bushel and A Peck"
: number, she is delightful.
EILEEN C HRISTY, as Sarah
I Brown (the missionary girl), is
i the standout of the cast. Her
• charm and sincerity combine
j with a clear and pure voice
j which can be heard anywhere in
j the theater- to convince the au
j dience that Sarah is much more
j than just a romantic ingenue
I lead. And in her hilarious drunk
: scene she manages, aided an d
abetted by Dailey, to siop the
j show right in the middle of her
j song "If I Were A Bell."
I Irwin Charone does not just
j play Nathan Detroit; he IS Na
: than Detroit, fiance of Adelaide
j and proprietor of t he oldest estab
lished permanent floating crap
j game in New York. With every
: phrase and gesture he makes, he
epitomizes the archtypical small
| time con man.
The supporting roles are also
I excellently filled. Sam Resnick's
! malevolent Big Jule, Do lo s
! Jewkes' touching Arvide, and the
| humor of Jim Demarest, Brian
Turner, Bob Hudson and Bee
I Peters all add immeasurably.
Michael Pollock's direction and
I Eddie Gasper's stylized dances
admirably capture the mood of
i the show, with the crap shooter's
' ballet particularly effective. Jo
seph Klein's sensitive musical di
: rection is superb.
Technically, the sets by Tad
; Anheier and the lighting by Al
i Jutzi also contribute a great deal
j to the overall success of this first-
I rate production.
