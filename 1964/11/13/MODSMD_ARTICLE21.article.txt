# TWO SOPH QB'S TO BATTLE
## Spoiler Role For Indians 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
The luckless Indians, who must
win the last two games of the
season to salvage a .500 season,
collide with the Oregon State
Beavers, the surprise team of the |
IAAYVU this year, tomorrow in
j Stanford Stadium. The Tribe!

hopes to successfully play the
spoiler role for the second time
this year against an Oregon
eleven.
The game may prove to be a
battle of sophomore quarterbacks.
Oregon State's Paul Brothers will
be pitted against Stanford's Dave
Lewis, who has waged an uphill

battle for tho starting berth and
finally has landed it.
BOTH ARE scramblers and equal
ly adept at passing and running.
Lewis' running average of 1.3 and
passing percentage of .412 aren't
impressive but he has performed
primarily in crucial situations.
OREGON STATE was not
picked to be a serious contender
in pre-season polls probably be
cause it hasn't any proven super
stars. What it does have, Coach
Tommy Prothro had used to ad

vantage and the result is a well
balanced football team that gets
the job done and then some.
The season has been nolhing
short of spectacular for the Beav
ers thus far. They have seven
victories since an initial loss to
Northwestern that caused little
concern in the OSU camp and, in
fact, was the arena where star
sophomore quarterback Paul
Brothers got his indoctrination
into college football. He has been
starting ever since.
BROTHERS, at 6-1 and 181 lbs.,
is the key to the Beaver offense.
He has averaged only slighily
more than a dozen pass attempts
per game, but his 58 completions
have been good for 836 yards and
six TD's. Significantly, only two
passes have been intercepted. His
prime receiver is Olvin Moreland,
who has caught 28 passes.
Pass they do, but the Beavers

prefer to keep the ball on the
ground. Their bread and butter
play is an end sweep by Brothers,
the team's leading rusher.
Defense-minded, the Beavers
have allowed no more than two
touchdowns during the season
and only twice have given up two
scores. They are third in the con
ference in rushing defense and
second in passing defense. A pair
of linebackers, Jack O'Billovich
and Dick Ruhl, rank with the best
on the coast and bulwark the
stingy forward wall.
DESPITE THE dissimilarity in
records, statistic-wise the Indians
and the Beavers are not far apart.
The place where they differ most
is in total defense where the Ore
gonians are second in the league
to IJSC. The Stanford offense has
the unenviable task of playing the
top defensive teams on consecu
tive weekends.

primarily in crucial situations.
OREGON STATE was not
picked to be a serious contender
in pre-season polls probably be
cause it hasn't any proven super
stars. What it does have, Coach
Tommy Prothro had used to ad

vantage and the result is a well
balanced football team that gets
the job done and then some.
The season has been nolhing
short of spectacular for the Beav
ers thus far. They have seven
victories since an initial loss to
Northwestern that caused little
concern in the OSU camp and, in
fact, was the arena where star
sophomore quarterback Paul
Brothers got his indoctrination
into college football. He has been
starting ever since.
BROTHERS, at 6-1 and 181 lbs.,
is the key to the Beaver offense.
He has averaged only slighily
more than a dozen pass attempts
per game, but his 58 completions
have been good for 836 yards and
six TD's. Significantly, only two
passes have been intercepted. His
prime receiver is Olvin Moreland,
who has caught 28 passes.
Pass they do, but the Beavers

prefer to keep the ball on the
ground. Their bread and butter
play is an end sweep by Brothers,
the team's leading rusher.
Defense-minded, the Beavers
have allowed no more than two
touchdowns during the season
and only twice have given up two
scores. They are third in the con
ference in rushing defense and
second in passing defense. A pair
of linebackers, Jack O'Billovich
and Dick Ruhl, rank with the best
on the coast and bulwark the
stingy forward wall.
DESPITE THE dissimilarity in
records, statistic-wise the Indians
and the Beavers are not far apart.
The place where they differ most
is in total defense where the Ore
gonians are second in the league
to IJSC. The Stanford offense has
the unenviable task of playing the
top defensive teams on consecu
tive weekends.

The luckless Indians, who must

spoiler role for the second time
this year against an Oregon
eleven.
The game may prove to be a
battle of sophomore quarterbacks.
Oregon State's Paul Brothers will
be pitted against Stanford's Dave
Lewis, who has waged an uphill

battle for tho starting berth and
finally has landed it.
BOTH ARE scramblers and equal
ly adept at passing and running.
Lewis' running average of 1.3 and
passing percentage of .412 aren't
impressive but he has performed
primarily in crucial situations.
