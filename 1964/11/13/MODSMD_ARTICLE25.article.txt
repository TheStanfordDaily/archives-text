The Stanford varsity soccer

I travels to San Jose State this eve-
I ning to seek revenge for one of
its losses. Riding high on two i
j eight goal outputs last week, the |
1 Indians hope to force the league-!
I leading Spartans into a play-off

; contingent, now 7-7, will partici-1
pate in the Nor-Cal Open this |
I weekend. The tournament will be
'held at Stanford, compeition pro- j
; ceeding steadily from 3:00 p.m. to- j
; day. Stanford plays Cal and Foot
; hill at 5:30 and 8:00 this evening, j

X-COUNTRV
Cross-Country, undefeated in j
!dual and triangular competition!
thus far, meets USC and UCLA I
Saturday at 10:00 at Los Angeles. I
Cross-Country Coach Barland
says that tho Tribe strategem will
bo to gain more speed in the first
two miios and gain the psychology
I ical advantage on USC and UCLA.
Although Stanford has beaten
j UCLA before this season, the
j Uclans will be no easy victims for
the tribe. The two teams will be
on a much different footing than
when they met before. For one
(thing, both UCLA and USC have
i been working all week under the
balmy conditions at Los Angeles, j
while Stanford has been wading i
through mud and slop the entire
period. In addition, the race will
be a home meet for both UCLA
and USC, a distinct advantage in
cross-country eompetitions.
This meet could prove to be de
cisive in the conference standings, j
Although the Tribe is 4-0 against :
conference teams, only two of J
these meets were official in con-1
j ference standings. If UCLA wins \
\ they will take over sole owner
ship of the conference lead.
