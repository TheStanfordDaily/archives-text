# The 						Ups And Downs Of Polo Players And Fans
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER THE SPECTATORS 
What kind of person goes to a water polo game?
Go to the Nor-Cal Open Tournament at the Encina poo] this after
noon and you can discern a variety of types. Sitting in the front row
of the stands and yelling, "Set it up! Set it up . . . Not now . . .
Free man!" will be the ex-water polo players. Then turn to the
source of the boisterous, "Swim it! C'mon, Blue, swim it!" Behold
the all-around water sports aficionado.
You may detect more personal overtones among the crowd. A
I well-seasoned bass booms out. "Nail that guy! Don't let 'im get
away with that! Hey rel'!" Of greater interest to the poloist than
his frat brother is the meek but enthusiastic voice piping out subtle
encouragement from beiween blonde curls.
Still another segment of spectator response emanates in a "Go,
go, go . . . shoot!" Here is the fan who is likely to turn up at a
j basketball game later in the year. He may not understand team
; moves and patterns as well as the ex-player, nor may he appreciate
j the special ball handling techniques as well as the water sports fan.
j Yet he knows a good pass or a good shot when he sees one. He
; cheers when his goalie makes an impossible save, and, above all,
: he yells when his team pounds Ihe yellow ball past the opposing
! goalie.
In a tight water polo game, as in a close basketball contest, Ihe
spectator knows one fast break can put the trailing team right back
i in the game. A two goal lead with two minutes remaining in the
l final quarter is by no means a safe margin.
THE GAME
Water polo, like basketball, is essentially a non-contact sport . . .
I except when a player is holding the ball. A poloist with his hands
; on the ball is liable to aggression from all sides. When a player con
! trolling the ball is grabbed or hit while not holding the ball, or when
J the ball carrier himself pushes an opposing player, the referee calls
| a personal foul. After his fourth personal, a contestant takes an
j obligatory respite for the remainder of the game.
Technical fouls, holding the ball under or offsides, do not count
i against a competitor. Major fouls overtly attacking a player,
fouling while time is out, or defaming the referee — constitute
grounds for immediate ejection from the game.
Fouls in water polo do not, except in one case, result in a free
throw at. the net as they do in basketball. Instead, the fouled poloist
is awarded an unobstructed toss to a teammate who then may fire
at the goal. A player who has been fouled within the four-yard line
while in scoring position gets a penalty shot at the goal. Rarely
does a goalie manage to stop one of these.
THE PLAYERS
j Aquatically inclined athletes participate in water polo for two
j major reasons. The great majority of polists enjoy the game for
j its own sake. Arduous training and the intense competition pro
| vide a satisfaction in themselves.
Second, and less common as a motivation, is the fact that water
I polo provides the best conditioning available for the upcoming swim
' ming season. Nearly all outstanding water poloists excel equally
! as swimmers, although the best swimmers often make only mediocre
' water polo players.
W ATER POLO AT STANFORD
j Stanford University played its first intercollegiate water polo
1 game in 1920, trouncing Cal 14-2. Since then, the Indians have piled
up a 45-24 record against the Berkeley Bears. The Tribe has been
! successful over the years against subsequent opponents. (33-18 with
I UCLA, 31-22 with USC. and 36-2-11 with San Jose State). The San
Francisco Olympic Club, holds a 2!)-21 edge over the Cards.
Perhaps the high point of the present season came as the Indians
had the opportunity to compete with the Olympic silver medalist
I Yugoslavian team. Also to be rated high in the list of memorables
was the 8-4 victory over touted Southern Cal last weekend.
The Cards go into the Nor-Cal Open Tournament today with a
7-7 record. Win number seven came Wednesday as the varsity, rid-
I ing on the arms of Bill Ready and Brian Beck, dunked San Jose
! State, 7-5. The Indians face a stiff challenge from Foothill before
| going to the finals tomorrow morning.

What kind of person goes to a water polo game?
Go to the Nor-Cal Open Tournament at the Encina poo] this after
noon and you can discern a variety of types. Sitting in the front row
of the stands and yelling, "Set it up! Set it up . . . Not now . . .
Free man!" will be the ex-water polo players. Then turn to the
source of the boisterous, "Swim it! C'mon, Blue, swim it!" Behold
the all-around water sports aficionado.
You may detect more personal overtones among the crowd. A
I well-seasoned bass booms out. "Nail that guy! Don't let 'im get
away with that! Hey rel'!" Of greater interest to the poloist than
his frat brother is the meek but enthusiastic voice piping out subtle
encouragement from beiween blonde curls.
Still another segment of spectator response emanates in a "Go,
go, go . . . shoot!" Here is the fan who is likely to turn up at a
j basketball game later in the year. He may not understand team
; moves and patterns as well as the ex-player, nor may he appreciate
j the special ball handling techniques as well as the water sports fan.
j Yet he knows a good pass or a good shot when he sees one. He
; cheers when his goalie makes an impossible save, and, above all,
: he yells when his team pounds Ihe yellow ball past the opposing
! goalie.

THE GAME
Water polo, like basketball, is essentially a non-contact sport . . .
I except when a player is holding the ball. A poloist with his hands
; on the ball is liable to aggression from all sides. When a player con
! trolling the ball is grabbed or hit while not holding the ball, or when
J the ball carrier himself pushes an opposing player, the referee calls
| a personal foul. After his fourth personal, a contestant takes an
j obligatory respite for the remainder of the game.

i against a competitor. Major fouls overtly attacking a player,
fouling while time is out, or defaming the referee — constitute
