# Rockwell And Poll U
## 
### 
Last week s visit by American Nazi leader
George Lincoln Rockwell has created a heated
debate, both in the letters columns of The Daily
and around the campus. That debate lias raised
two important questions: first, whether Rock
well should have been allowed to speak at all,
and second, whether the Political Union was
wise in sponsoring him.
The first issue concerns one of the most re
vered "institutions" in the academic community,
the idea that there should always exist absolute
freedom of speech and a completely open forum.
Many fail to realize, however, that there
are practical limits to this freedom. For there
are times, especially times of crisis, when certain
individuals or ideas are so threatening to the
public order that they cannot safely be tolerated.
This is especially true in the case of dema
gogues such as Rockwell (and, lest we forget,
his Communist counterparts), who disguise their
ideas and intentions by presenting them in
moderate and appealing terms ("peace," "Ameri
canism,' etc.).
The issue of Rockwell's right to speak was
raised by those who feel, as Mr. Steingart so
expressed in yesterdays Daily, that Rockwell
represents a clear threat, and, therefore, that
Stanford should not provide him a platform 112 rom
which to push his ideas.
Rockwell was allowed to speak quite simply
because the University community did not feel
so directly threatened, and because Stanford
students are credited with enough intelligence
and common sense to take Rockwell's ideas for
what they are, the ravings of a near lunatic, re
gardless of his attempts at Hag-waving and mod
eration.
We agree with that policy, but at the same
time acknowledge the validity of the argument
that if an individual presents a clear danger, his
"rights" should not be enforced at the expense
of the community as a whole.
But the issue of whether Rockwell had a right
to speak is quite different from that of whether
Political Union should have brought him here.

Allowing the expression of extremist ideas is
quite a different matter from encouraging it.
Rockwell's visit, if it had any merit at all,
was valuable only in that it promoted active dis
cussion. Rut he was a novelty whom people
came to see out of curiosity, not a source
of any new knowledge for his listeners. We
doubt whether the expenditure (some $60 plus
student police and publicity costs) was justified.
More alarming than the Rockwell speech,
however, is the apparent concentration by the
Political Union this quarter on presenting fringe
viewpoints â€” evidently for the entertainment of
the Stanford community.
Aside from the rather one-sided election eval
uation of last week, the three biggest programs
of Political Union have been Dr. Fred Schwarz,
head of the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade,
(scheduled during the more valuable Hoover
Conference), Major-General Edwin A. Walker,
and Rockwell.
Next week students will be enlightened by
Peter How ard of the "Moral Rearmament" move
ment, and law yer Marc Lane, w ho will argue the
innocence of Lee Harvey Oswald.
Why is it necessary to sponsor almost exclu
sively such eccentric speakers? Is this not a
waste of the tuition money entrusted to Political
Union for the purpose of bringing stimulating
and informative programs to campus?
We hope that Poli U will direct its attention
toward a more positive and respectable segment
of the American political spectrum and w ill in
vite, besides the several politicians it has sched
uled (Senators Morse, Murphy and Kuehel), a
number of journalists and academicians of more
responsible liberal and conservative stripe. James
Burnham, Walter Lippmann, Milton Friedman,
Robert Hutchins, Arthur Sehlessinger, and Will
moore Kendall are just a few of the many im
portant and exciting available guest speakers.
There is nothing wrong with the novel, or
even the absurd, but it should be limited and in
good taste. Surely Stanford deserves better fare
than it has been given this quarter.
