## Daily's Role In Ticket Fiasco 
### 
Dear Sir:
The responsibility for Monday's
"ticket fiasco" cannot be placed
solely on the shoulders of the
Department of Athletes.
According to Mr. Chuck Taylor,
notification a propos the ticket
sales was given to The Daily last
week - notification which in
cluded the information that buy
ers woidd be limited to four sea
son tickets. While a notice ap
peared in Friday's Daily concern
ing the sale, no notice was given
that customers would not be able
to buy more than four tickets
until the morning of the sale.
Thus when representatives from
three Wilbur houses who had
spent the night at the Pavilion
(Rinconada had a man at the
ticket window at 8 p.m. Sunday
and I joined him at 2 a.m. Mon

day representing Madera) in
hopes of purchasing for th c i r
entire house were told of the
limit, we complained lo Mr. Tay
lor who lifted the restriction in
light of the Daily's slip-up.
Limiting buyers to four tickets
is a good idea, as it would expose
the basketball team to a more
homogeneous group of students.
However if the school's commu
nication organ doesn't notify the
studentry of the limit, it would
be unfair to impose the rule on
those who were counting on buy
ing blocks of tickets.
Ergo maybe all those influen
tial Sigma Chi jocks would do
well to mob the Daily office rather
than attacking the athletic de
partment.
RICH HARK IS
Madera

EDITOR'S NOTE: The infor
mation cut from Friday's article
was ommitted by accident, clue
to space difficulties. The Daily
apologizes for any harmful ef
fects this may have had.
We can only wonder, how
ever, how it happened that
those from Wilbur who waited
in line so long 1 did not read the
sign above the ticket window,
which stated the policy of four
tickets to a customer.
And we wonder also at the
Athletic Department's indiffer
ence to the welfare of the others
in the line who, as a result of
the sudden policy change,
waited several hours in the rain
to no avail.
