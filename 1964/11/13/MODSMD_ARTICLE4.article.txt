Blue and gold will become

fire rally, which starts at the
boat house at (irXO Friday and
is climaxed by the ignition of
a three story high pyre rep
resenting the freshman class'
attempt to outdo the Leaning
Tower of Pisa.
As the last wisp of smoke
drifts from the remains of
the once-haughty Golden
Bear across the fraternity
dance in the new clusters, the
Indians' appetities for fur
ther gore will merely be
warmed up for the slaughter
slated the next day at Cal.
