• ( .A. Hears Syria, Israel
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — The U.N. Se
curity Council will meet this afternoon to
discuss border clashes between Syria and
Israel.
U.S. delegate Adlai E. Stevenson, council
president for November, called the meeting
yesterday, the morning after Syrian delegate
Rafik Aslia asked that he convene the council
urgently to consider "the latest aggression
commit ted by Israel against the Syrian Arab
Republic.'' Forces of the two nations fought a

SAIGON, South Vietnam Soldiers and
Marines in battle gear camped in parks, rode
around in trucks and patrolled the streets of
Saigon yesterday forestalling anti-government

demonstrations threatened by students and
other political dissidents.
The only demonstration of sorts came when
about 500 persons crowded into a hall, sur
rounded by troops, and demanded dissolution
of Premier Trail Van Huong's 13-day-old civil
ian cabinet.
The massive show of armed force in the
city apparently discouraged the students who
claimed during the week they would stage
street demonstrations to demand the resigna
tion of Huong's government.
• Rebels Threaten Death
LEOPOLDVILLE, The Congo — A rebel
leader of the "Congolese People's Republic"
in Stanleyville has assured "neutral" coun

But rebel Defense Minister Gaston Soumia
lot singled out the United States, Belgium,
Italy and Britain as countries backing the
Leopoldville regime of Premier Moise Tshom

be. He implied their citizens would not be pro
tected.
As a central government column spear
headed by white mercenary soldiers prepares
for a final thrust against the rebel capital,
there is increasing anxiety for more than 1,000
foreigners — including GO Americans — inside
the rebel zone.
