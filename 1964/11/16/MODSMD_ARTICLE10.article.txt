# Savio To Speak At Open Meeting
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Free speech at Cal—the realit\
and proposed reforms — will be
discussed today by Mario Savio,
chairman of the Free Speech
Movement (FSM) in an open
meeting sponsored by the Young
Democrats at 4:15 p.m. in the
Large Lounge of Tresidder.
The Young Democrats, through
FSM. are trying to arrange for
one of the members of the Cal fac
ulty committee to attend so that
the University's viewpoint might
also be represented. As of late last
night it was not yet known
whether or not this was possible.
Both Mark Weissbluth and Bob
Rosen, presidents of the Peace
Caucus and Socialist Caucus re
spectively, have urged their mem
bers to attend.
THE YD'S will consider a reso
lution tentatively adopted by the
Socialist Caucus and the 1 Peace
Caucus (see next column). The
three groups hope to circulate the
resolution—as adopted or amend
ed—as a petition for faculty and
student signatures. It would then
be sent to Cal President Clark
Kerr before the Regents meet this
Friday.
The main point of contention
between the FSM proposals and
the 10-point program recommend
ed to the University Administra
tion by a specially formed six
man faculty committee concerns
the issue of whether or not the
Administration has the right to
discipline students engaged in
illegal off-campus activity.
Savio contends that the faculh
recommendation amou nt s 1o
"double jeopardy," since any stu
dent convicted of an off-campus
felony could then be punished a
second time by the University.
THE FACULTY committee
holds that if the University
agrees to allow on-eampus solici
tation for off-campus projects
then it must take responsibility
for the legality of these projects.
The debate on this issue will
probably be the focus of today's
discussion. Prior to Savio's lalk,
Professors Charles Drekmcier
and Christian Bey will delivci
short explanatory introductions
on the meaning and scope of the
free speech dilemma both for Cal
and Stanford.
YD President Tim Ingram
urged all interested students to
attend.
He also asked that YD mem
bers arrive 15 minutes early to
elect a Vice-President. Loren
Mitchell and Doug Beaty are the
students running for the office.
