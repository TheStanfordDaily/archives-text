# Lunch Hour At The I-Center Features Lively Discussion
## 
### ANN SATTLER 
The chatter ol American and foreign tongues competes with
the clatter of knives and forks during lunch hour at the Interna
tional Center, where American and foreign students gather to ex
change ideas and satisfy their appetites.
\\ hether the discussion centers around comparison of television

quality in Israel and the United*
States or analysis of the problems j
in inter-cultural courtship, the di-!
versity of backgrounds provides a !
stimulating cross-current of infor-'
mat ion and opinion.
EACH OF THE seven luncheon
groups, while limited to 15 mom
ers to maintain the casual atmos
phere, offers great diversity. In
addition to the balance of foreign
and American students, interested
citizens of the community are in
cluded to provide still another
viewpoint.
Topics of conversation are
loosely guided by the categories
of the luncheons: Men and Wom
en, Values and Social Change, So
cial Revolution in the 20th Cen
tury, Open End, and Political
Y ear.
In a group, a student proposed
his theory that the education of
women in underdeveloped coun
tries is not economically profit
able.
"YOU SPEND YEARS and dol
lars giving a woman a profes

sional education and what hap
pens? She is put out of commis
sion for ten valuable years while
she raises her kids," he said.
A community lawyer's wife
objected. "I think that children in
such rapidly industrializing na
tions will need progressive, edu
cated mothers during their forma
tive years."
A GRADUATE STUDENT in
sociology introduced anot h e r
point. Imagine the chaos that
would overcome a society in
which the men are highly educat
ed in modern technology and the
women are left behind in the
traditionay ways of their ances
tors."
First-hand evidence of the ac
ceptance of women in professional
capacities was provided by a
young girl formerly attached to
U.S. Consulates in Gennany and
Greece.
"It was almost easier to operate
in the society of Greece than in
that of Germany," she said,
"Since the field of foreign diplo
macy was relatively new in
Greece there were fewer tradi
tional taboos regarding women in
politics."
Tom Clagett, program coordi
nator of the I-Center, notes:
"IF WE ASSUME that Stanford
is a very selective institution, we
must recognize that the students
are usually special people. For
eign students admitted are there
fore very special. It would be a
waste for them to move in sepa
rate spheres here on campus, be
cause each group is capable of
giving so much to the other."

In a group, a student proposed
his theory that the education of
women in underdeveloped coun
tries is not economically profit
able.
"YOU SPEND YEARS and dol
lars giving a woman a profes

sional education and what hap
pens? She is put out of commis
sion for ten valuable years while
she raises her kids," he said.
A community lawyer's wife
objected. "I think that children in
such rapidly industrializing na
tions will need progressive, edu
cated mothers during their forma
tive years."
A GRADUATE STUDENT in
sociology introduced anot h e r
point. Imagine the chaos that
would overcome a society in
which the men are highly educat
ed in modern technology and the
women are left behind in the
traditionay ways of their ances
tors."
First-hand evidence of the ac
ceptance of women in professional
capacities was provided by a
young girl formerly attached to
U.S. Consulates in Gennany and
Greece.
"It was almost easier to operate
in the society of Greece than in
that of Germany," she said,
"Since the field of foreign diplo
macy was relatively new in
Greece there were fewer tradi
tional taboos regarding women in
politics."
Tom Clagett, program coordi
nator of the I-Center, notes:
"IF WE ASSUME that Stanford
is a very selective institution, we
must recognize that the students
are usually special people. For
eign students admitted are there
fore very special. It would be a
waste for them to move in sepa
rate spheres here on campus, be
cause each group is capable of
giving so much to the other."
The chatter ol American and foreign tongues competes with
the clatter of knives and forks during lunch hour at the Interna
tional Center, where American and foreign students gather to ex
change ideas and satisfy their appetites.
\\ hether the discussion centers around comparison of television

quality in Israel and the United*
States or analysis of the problems j
in inter-cultural courtship, the di-!
versity of backgrounds provides a !
stimulating cross-current of infor-'
mat ion and opinion.
EACH OF THE seven luncheon
groups, while limited to 15 mom
ers to maintain the casual atmos
phere, offers great diversity. In
addition to the balance of foreign
and American students, interested
citizens of the community are in
cluded to provide still another
viewpoint.
Topics of conversation are
