## Frosh Writes Gaieties Score 
### 
Freshman Gary Levinson is
largely responsible for the crea
tion of what Director Phil Ellis
calls "the finest musical score
Gaieties has ever had.''
The seventeen-year oJd grad
uatel of Santa Monica High
School has written the music and
many of the lyrics for nineteen
of the show's twenty-three music
al numbers. He says he enjoys
"just sitting at the piano making
up tunes."
LEVINSON has been working
on the show since early in the
quarter. Although he has been
plagued with problems of orches
tration, getting music copied for
the cast and orchestra, and con
stant time pressures, his calm,
friendly, unassuming manner
continues to amaze other mem
bers of the production. Asked if
he would consider doing another
Gaieties, he replied: "Certainly.
I'm fascinated by it."
Trained for eight years in class
ical piano under a private tutor,
Levinson explains that ho has
kept up with his music for the
last four years without any out
side instruction. He admits that
his first fling into musical come
dy, when he was a junior in high
school, was a bomb.
"The music was good," he says,
"but, in the words of our drama
ties prof, the dialogue lacked
'sparkle.' "The dialogue of "It's
Jane!" was plenty of sparkle," he
added.
LKVINSON shares credit for
the music with three veterans of
Gaieties productions, Nancy
Fiver, Stove Lawry, and Director
Ellis.
One number, introducing a new
dance, "The Peel," was composed
and arranged by Gaieties Musical i
Director Ron Simpson. Levinson ,
denies the persistent rumor that !
the choreographer for this scene I
is being hold under house arrest '
at Dean Winbigler's office.
Other musical goodies sure to
be popular among the Stanford
student body include "Stanford
Dollies," "I Just Met a Row Girl," i
"it's the Loot that Counts," and
the song of the Dean's office, "It's |
Not in My Line."
