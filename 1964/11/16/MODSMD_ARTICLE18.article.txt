Ham's Head Business Manager
Jay Weaver reports that Friday
night is nearly sold out but that
seats remain for the other
! three performances.
SINCE ALL seats are reserved
! Weaver recommends that stu
dents purchase their tickets early
to insure themselves the best pos
! sible location in Memorial Audi-
I torium.
Prices downstairs range from
! $2.50 to $1.50. Balcony seats are
$2.00, $1.50, and $1.00.
All profits from Gaieties are
i equally divided between a drama
tics scholarship fund and the pur
chase of needed stage equipment.
"Student response to 'It's Jane!'
should be such that we can make
sizeable additions to both these
accounts," Weaver predicted.

see both the Scholarship Fund and the Equip
ment Improvement Fund of the organization
grow as the result of the show.
