# PRODUCTION CREW
## 50 Work Behind Scenes 
### 
Including the fifty members of the cast,
well over one hundred students have con
tributed to making "It's Jane!" a success.
Many of these people will never bo seen on
stage and most members of the audience
will only scan their names on the program.
However, without their efforts production
of a show the size of Gaieties would be im
possible.

Cast members and working hands of the
backstage crew often cast envious glances
at a group of people wandering the set who
never seem to have anything to do. These
are the show's Producers. Their job is a
never ending attention to a plethora of de
tail.
Charged with making certain that
every phase of the production is proceed
ing on schedule and that all problems have
been anticipated and rectified in advance
of their occurrence, the Producers spend
a great deal of their lime accepting other
people's problems as their own.
Head Gaieties Producer Ed Blair reports
that his is not the job to have "if you value
! your sleep." One of the show's Assistant
i Producers, Robert Webster, was discovered
S in a quiet corner of the stage at 2 a.m. Sat
j urday night puzzling over how many per

formers could change costumes at one time
in the women's john. "Somebody's got to
do it,"he commented, flushing profusely.
Amidst a welter of wood scraps, empty
paint cans, and stage flats backstage in
Memorial Auditorium, the little kingdom of
T. J. McHose, Gaieties Technical Director,
one finds the fantastic and the unexpected.
A whimsical replica of Mem Claw spews
forth streams of water, Memorial Church
and Tresidder Union hang some forty foot
over the stage ready to he lowered into
place, pieces of a Dean's office are piled in
one corner.
Scenes change 22 times in "It's Jane!"
Rapid shifts are necessary to keep up the
pace of the show. Each must be planned
for speed and efficiency. The simplicity and
the effectiveness of the set designs McHose
and crew have created within the bounds of
a relatively limited budget are a real tribute
to the ingenuity and stagecraft skill of the
Ram's Head technical staff.
"Did you ever try to find a witch's mask
in a store two weeks after Halloween?
Clerks look at you as though you'd really
flipped."
This was among the lesser problems
faced by Gaieties costume executor Lynn
Fox. Responsible for outfitting a cast of

more than fifty performers, plus providing
duplicate costumes for all the lead char
acters' understudies, Lynn and her crew
have spent long hours behind the sewing
machines in the basement of Memorial Au
ditorium.
Among the costumes created by John
Pasqualetti and Karen Ratncr, one of the
most time consuming projects the costum
ers handled was the outfitting of thirty-five
angels complete with wings and halos.
Other scenes called for four Beatle types,
two coolies, and several rather elaborate
costumes for Jane.
Lynn counts herself fortunate that most
of the action in the show takes place on
the Stanford campus. Many of the scenes
require nothing more than Quad dress.
However, even these must be carefully co
ordinated to avoid unnecexsaray distractions
on stage.
Athletic Department officials were some
what startled the other day when a slight,
attractive girl entered their office and asked
if she could borrow some barbells. The girl,
Karen Hayes, cleared their clouded expres
sions by explaining that she was managing
properties for Big Game Gaieties and
needed the equipment for the production.
Among the few things Karen still needs
to complete her list is a saxaphone. Can
anyone help her out?
