# SURF-Cal Airport Meet Fails Friday
## Stanford Envoy Rejects Cal Offer 
### STAN KNIGHTLY 
Tlu» first I aee-to-face meeting
dI the president of SURF and the
chairman of the Cal Rally Com
ended in failure at the San Fran
cisco Airport Friday night.
The summit conference had
been arranged earlier at the mu
tually-agreed-upon rendezous site.
It was hoped that some form of
exchange agreement might be
reached over the lost school spirit
symbols of both Stanford and Cal.
BERKELEY IS missing one can
non. one ASUC flag, and one
Rally Com football. Stanford is
short 20,000 stunt cards, one bell,
and one football banner.
Cal's representatives, headed by
Doug Patterson, came to the air
port with a pickup truck loaded
down with the 350-pound pile of
cards. Patterson had hoped to ex
change the lot in an across-the
board trade for Cal's golden gun.
This offer, however, was re
jected by SURF representative
Biff Deßivort, who wanted th e
long-missing S t a n 112 or d football
banner thrown into the deal.
BOTH SIDES then retired to a
nearby coffee shop, and continued
dickering until 2 a.m., when ne
gotiations were broken off.
The stunt cards were removed
from the Stanford Stadium, with
the help of some innocent by
standers from the Stanford track
team, last Wednesday afternoon.

two schools.
