### JOHN MERRILL 
After defeating Rose Bowl hope
ful Oregon State, Coach John Ral
ston was jubilant.
The Stanford coach stated in
the locker room after the game
that "we had a lot of fun doing i
it. The boys really wanted to win |
this one and they weren't look- j
ing ahead one foot."
RALSTON said he had the feel
ing that the team had been beat
ing itself all season so "we went
out there and eliminated all past
mistakes."
Coach Tommy Prothro of Ore
gon State thought that Rose Bowl
consciousness "may have hurt the
team a little, but the big differ
ence that I saw was a Stanford i
team that didn't fumble or have
a pass intercepted."
Prothro had high praise for
Stanford back Ray Handley who
outgained the whole Oregon State j
team in the first half, and 112 or
Dave Lewis.
PROTHRO commended the
Stanford defense and said, "They
kept us backed up all day and
the few times we backed them
up, we couldn't keep them there.
Every time we got the ball, we
had a long way to go. The players
just couldn't get the job done."
Coach John Ralston cited two
plays as key parts of the game, j
The first was an attempted fair I
catch of a Lewis punt by Beaver |
Dan Espalin. Ralston said "There >

was no doubt in my mind that he
| Espalin J touched the ball before
he made the block."
John Guillory recovered th e
fumble on the OSU 8 and Braden
Beck then kicked his ninth field
| goal of the season to put Stanford
j in the lead 3-0.
THE OTHER key play came
1 with less than two minutes re
maining in the first half. Olvin
Moreland of OSU ran around
right end for 56 yards on a re
verse before Dick Ragsdale a n d
John Guillory made the stop after
hemming in the ball carrier and
dodging blockers.
Ralston said, "I can still see
that reverse going down the field.
Ragsdale and Guillory played it
i perfectly and did a tremendous
job in staying on their feet."
After the game, Gary Pettigrew,
defensive tackle who was named
the games outstanding lineman,
j said, "1 think they just may have
underrated us."
PETTIGREW, Craig Ritchey,
and Bob Rath were defensive
standouts all day and each h a d
nine tackles for the game. Both
Pettigrew and Dave Lewis, the
Back of the Game, received high
praise from Coach Ralston.
Coach Ralston stated that for
many players, but not the team,
| this was the best game of the
season. He added, "This has been
a disappointing season for what
j is a real solid football team. We've
1 had a lot of bad bounces."

out there and eliminated all past
mistakes."
Coach Tommy Prothro of Ore
gon State thought that Rose Bowl
consciousness "may have hurt the
team a little, but the big differ
ence that I saw was a Stanford i
team that didn't fumble or have
a pass intercepted."
Prothro had high praise for
Stanford back Ray Handley who
outgained the whole Oregon State j
team in the first half, and 112 or
Dave Lewis.
PROTHRO commended the
Stanford defense and said, "They
kept us backed up all day and
the few times we backed them
up, we couldn't keep them there.
Every time we got the ball, we
had a long way to go. The players
just couldn't get the job done."
Coach John Ralston cited two
plays as key parts of the game, j
The first was an attempted fair I
catch of a Lewis punt by Beaver |
Dan Espalin. Ralston said "There >

was no doubt in my mind that he
| Espalin J touched the ball before
he made the block."
John Guillory recovered th e
fumble on the OSU 8 and Braden
Beck then kicked his ninth field
| goal of the season to put Stanford
j in the lead 3-0.
THE OTHER key play came
1 with less than two minutes re
maining in the first half. Olvin
Moreland of OSU ran around
right end for 56 yards on a re
verse before Dick Ragsdale a n d
John Guillory made the stop after
hemming in the ball carrier and
dodging blockers.
Ralston said, "I can still see
that reverse going down the field.
Ragsdale and Guillory played it
i perfectly and did a tremendous
job in staying on their feet."
After the game, Gary Pettigrew,
defensive tackle who was named
the games outstanding lineman,
j said, "1 think they just may have
underrated us."
PETTIGREW, Craig Ritchey,
and Bob Rath were defensive
standouts all day and each h a d
nine tackles for the game. Both
Pettigrew and Dave Lewis, the
Back of the Game, received high
praise from Coach Ralston.
Coach Ralston stated that for
many players, but not the team,
| this was the best game of the
season. He added, "This has been
a disappointing season for what
j is a real solid football team. We've
1 had a lot of bad bounces."
After defeating Rose Bowl hope
ful Oregon State, Coach John Ral
ston was jubilant.
The Stanford coach stated in
the locker room after the game
that "we had a lot of fun doing i
it. The boys really wanted to win |
this one and they weren't look- j
ing ahead one foot."
RALSTON said he had the feel
ing that the team had been beat
ing itself all season so "we went
out there and eliminated all past
mistakes."
