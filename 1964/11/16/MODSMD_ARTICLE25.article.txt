# Open Letter from the Secretary-General of Stanford United Nations
## 
### 
I would like to acquaint you with a unique organization
on the Stanford campus, the largest intra-school model
United Nations in the world: the Stanford United Na
tions.
SUN exists for the sole purpose of providing the Stan
ford student with an unsurpassable opportunity. By
participating in SUN, the individual will learn, through
personal contact and through research, specific and
practical knowledge about the nation he is selected to
represent; by participating in SUN the student-delegate
will engage in pertinent discussion of international
issues and problems, not as himself but as a repre
sentative of a member nation of the U.N. As a delegate
to SUN, you will be provided with information from
missions to the United Nations, embassies, and con
sulates. You will have the opportunity to correspond
personally with envoys. In January there will be a
reception for the consuls-general present in San Fran
cisco; at this coffee hour the delegates may informally
discuss issues affecting their respective nations with
qualified representatives from those nations. Faculty
members and foreign students will also be available
for consultation.
The keynote speaker of the general assembly tradition
ally concerns himself with over-all viewpoints and prob
lems of the U.N. Last year Senator Frank Church of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee spoke; this year
former ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., has been
invited.
The Stanford United Nations is modeled after the organ
ization in New York. Blocks of nations meet to decide
a unified strategy on specific issues. Nations submit
resolutions dealing with some international dispute or
problem; these resolutions are hammered into compro
mises in committees and then sent to the general assem
bly for final decision.
SUN has three operating committees: the Political and
Security Committee will be confronted with the complex
and delicate matter of attempting to work out equitable
soluions to the heated quesions of Southern Rhodesia
and Chinese representation. The Economic, Social, and
Humanitarian Committee will consider the issues of in
ternational trade agreements and world-wide viola
tions of human rights. The Special Committee on U.N.
Organization is concerned with averting the crisis which
recently began developing over non-payment of dues
and assessments and the subsequent deficit of funds.
It will also consider the possibility of charter revisions,
affecting a change in the number of nations on ECOSOC
and on the Security Council.
In the past, SUN sessions have proved exciting as well
as authentic. Accuracy of viewpoint is stressed, but one's
imagination and intepretation is not to be superceded
by dogma. If you are interested in applying for a dele
gation chairmanship, please sign up in the downstairs
ASSU offices for a short interview on either the 16th,
17th, or 1 8th of November. (For those who have already
been interviewed, country assignment will be postponed
until next week in order to allow for the continuation
of these interviews and applications.)
One's country assignment is based as heavily as pos
sible upon personal preference. Your participation is
welcomed, and I believe that SUN, in return, can offer
you a challenging and rewarding experience.
Sincerely,
STUART NOVICK

In the past, SUN sessions have proved exciting as well
as authentic. Accuracy of viewpoint is stressed, but one's
imagination and intepretation is not to be superceded
by dogma. If you are interested in applying for a dele
gation chairmanship, please sign up in the downstairs
ASSU offices for a short interview on either the 16th,
17th, or 1 8th of November. (For those who have already
been interviewed, country assignment will be postponed
until next week in order to allow for the continuation
of these interviews and applications.)
One's country assignment is based as heavily as pos
sible upon personal preference. Your participation is
welcomed, and I believe that SUN, in return, can offer
you a challenging and rewarding experience.
Sincerely,
STUART NOVICK
Secretary-General
Stanford United Nations
I would like to acquaint you with a unique organization
on the Stanford campus, the largest intra-school model
United Nations in the world: the Stanford United Na
tions.
SUN exists for the sole purpose of providing the Stan
ford student with an unsurpassable opportunity. By
participating in SUN, the individual will learn, through
personal contact and through research, specific and
practical knowledge about the nation he is selected to
represent; by participating in SUN the student-delegate
will engage in pertinent discussion of international
issues and problems, not as himself but as a repre
sentative of a member nation of the U.N. As a delegate
to SUN, you will be provided with information from
missions to the United Nations, embassies, and con
sulates. You will have the opportunity to correspond
personally with envoys. In January there will be a
reception for the consuls-general present in San Fran
cisco; at this coffee hour the delegates may informally
discuss issues affecting their respective nations with
qualified representatives from those nations. Faculty
members and foreign students will also be available
for consultation.
The keynote speaker of the general assembly tradition
ally concerns himself with over-all viewpoints and prob
lems of the U.N. Last year Senator Frank Church of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee spoke; this year
former ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., has been
invited.
The Stanford United Nations is modeled after the organ
ization in New York. Blocks of nations meet to decide
a unified strategy on specific issues. Nations submit
resolutions dealing with some international dispute or
problem; these resolutions are hammered into compro
mises in committees and then sent to the general assem
bly for final decision.
SUN has three operating committees: the Political and
Security Committee will be confronted with the complex
and delicate matter of attempting to work out equitable
soluions to the heated quesions of Southern Rhodesia
and Chinese representation. The Economic, Social, and
Humanitarian Committee will consider the issues of in
ternational trade agreements and world-wide viola
tions of human rights. The Special Committee on U.N.
Organization is concerned with averting the crisis which
recently began developing over non-payment of dues
and assessments and the subsequent deficit of funds.
It will also consider the possibility of charter revisions,
affecting a change in the number of nations on ECOSOC
and on the Security Council.
In the past, SUN sessions have proved exciting as well
as authentic. Accuracy of viewpoint is stressed, but one's
imagination and intepretation is not to be superceded
by dogma. If you are interested in applying for a dele
gation chairmanship, please sign up in the downstairs
