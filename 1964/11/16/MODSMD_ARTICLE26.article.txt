						Significant Saturday As Tribe Dumps OSU 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Stanford doesn't win football games it doesn't deserve. And it
doesn't always win the games it does deserve, but Saturday it beat
the Oregon State Beavers in both statistics and scoring. The Tribe's
loyal but hardened corps of spectators could utter a "Whew!" in-1
stead of the usual "Oh, no!" at the end of the game. In many ways, I
it was a significant afternoon.

Ray Handley, who Ls a handy man to have around twisted and
squirmed for 141 yards to boost his season rushing- mark to 861
yards which eclipses C'liuck Shea's old mark of 840 yards set in Is)f>7.

The Indians won their fourth game of the season which already
gives them a mark better than last season's and a chance to end the
campaign at .500. The 16-7 victory was the fifth time Stanford's de
fense has limited the opposition to one TD and marks the first time
this has happened since 1950.

The triplets of the underworld who usually lurk in the shadows
and appear at inopportune moments — penalities, fumbles, and in
terceptions — did little damage to the Stanford cause. There were
no fumbles or interceptions and only a paltry 15 yards paced off
against the insidious Indians who seem to enjoy the spoiler role,
now having knocked off two Oregon teams with Rose Bowl ambitions.

Sophomore Dave Lewis emerged as the number one Stanford
quarterback. His manner of accession was in direct contrast to that
of Paid Brothers, Oregon State's soph field general. After a fine
showing in spring ball, he did not play at all in the first two games
which prompted a sportswriter to ask Coach John Ralston, "Is Dave,
Lewis a myth?"
Beginning with the UCLA game, ho has been nutured slowly, got -!
ting a taste of flanker back, then gradually gaining experience at
quarterback when it was realized neither Dick Berg or Terry DeSyl
via could handle the job. On the other hand, Brothers as- i
sumed the starting position after the first game of the season. Many j
will argue, and perhaps rightfully so, that Lewis should have been j
given a chance earlier. Although it is debatable whether or not Ral- j
ston's timing of the starting of the Chookchancee Charger was be- J
lated or not, Lewis certainly was ready Saturday. For the first time 1
this year, a Stanford quarterback received back of the game honors. 1
And he was the choice of 20 of the 26writers casting votes.
Well, the Indians have come of age once again. They have done it
sporadically throughout the season, but this time the effort deserves ]
more than a casual glance. The mark of a mature football team, is
that it does not let up and reacts well under pressure.

, The defense must be able to i
stop a pass or a run when it j
counts the most. Saturday, the
key plays, according to John Ral- <
ston, were the last-ditch tackle by !
Dick Rags dale and John Guillory i
of a reverse and the pass inter
ception by Ragsdale. Thus, t he '
defense fulfilled its part.
The offense must be able to
build up a lead instead of Jetting
down and sitting on a slim mar
gin, and to come from behind
when necessary. Against the Beav-

ers, the Tribe spared its rooters
any undue trauma by staying ahead and used touchdowns in the
third and fourth quarters to bolster slim leads. The offense seems
to have caught up to the defense.

For Stanford's previous games, there have been questions about, j
whom the starters will be. For the Big Game, the line-up appears !
solidly set. And because of the fine showings of such reserves
as Roger Clay, Bob Blunt, Bill Ogle, and Bob Montgomery, if any

starters falter, there will be.
proven talent available.
Small, spontaneous outbursts I
such as tho team's running to and |
from the half time looker room ;
janci the enthusiasm that per-!
' meated the Stanford locker room !
after the game indicate high:
' squad spirit.
i What most served to fire up
the Indians was an incident which I
occurred before the game began.
The Beavers, who had not said
what side of the field they would
practice on before the game, were
all over the field when the Indians
appeared for their pre-game drills
land began to run onto the field.
Oregon State's coach, Tommy Pro
thro, when asked by Ralston if he
would move some of his players,
replied, "If you run through my
team, I'll challenge you." The in
sult extremely provoked Ralston,
iand he related it to the team in
his pre-game talk. Add to this that
news from Oregon State has
termed the Indians, scrappers, not
real fighters, and that the Beav
ers tried a field goal attempt in
the first half, hoping to get to,
I Pasadena on a tie, and you've got
a bunch of hopping-mad Indians
bent on destruction.
The only sour note of signifi- j
cance was that Braden Beck, who !
had not missed a PAT attempt in
j his college career, missed a con
version after 23 successful at
tempts over a two year span.
