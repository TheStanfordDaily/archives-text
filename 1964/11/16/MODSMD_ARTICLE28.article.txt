# CLOSE OUT SEASON
## Tribe Hooters Tie Spartans 
### HUGH WEST 
A minute and a half left in the j
ball game; a San Jose player takes j
a shot at the goal; Stanford goalie
Kent Mueller dives and bats it
away, falling to the ground .
Another shot is taken at the!
empty goal, hut alert Indian full- j
back John Price heads it out; j
there is a scramble for the ball:
and Sparton inside A 1 Borbus fin- 1
ally boots it into the corner of the !
net, salvaging a 3-3 tie with 1:11
on the clock.
THIS GOAL topped Stanford's
final game of the season against
Nor-Cal League leader San Jose I
State Friday night. The game,
played before a cold, wet, parti
san, and excited crowd, in cold,
soggy Spartan Stadium seemed a
do or die cause for both teams.
It was a strange mixture of
shoddy and simply beautiful play,
with few letdowns in excitement.
As play opened, it looked as if
it were going to be a Spartan day.
The Greeks were passing with j
precision and any attempt for the
Tribe to get into enemy territory
were stopped by the booming
kicks of the San Jose fulbacks.
Stanford played shoddy ball for
the first ten minutes, but finally
settled down to give San Jose a
game.
THE INDIAN'S ability to capi
talize on mistakes, while the Spar
tans blew many gifts from the ;
Stanford defense proved a big
difference in the early minutes.
With 40 seconds left in the first
quarter, Red left inside Klas
Bergman found himself all alone

in front of the nets and poked I
the ball into the lower right cor
ner, giving Stanford a 1-0 lead.
Stanford then took tho advan
tage in the second quarter with
the Spartans kicking open shots
i off to the side and over the nets.
With the quarter half-gone, a
Spartan fullback helped Bergman
! put in Stanford's second goal for
; a 2-0 lead.
THE ADVANTAGE see sawed
back and forth until SJS star A 1
Korbus scored on a fast break,
cutting the Indian margin to one.
The power of Zeus appeared
greater than that of the Great
l Spirit in the third period, as sev
j oral apparent Stanford goals!
bounced off the post or the po
tential scorer slipped just before)
the final shot.
Meanwhile, Ediok Akpan<
slipped one through Mueller'/
finger tips to tie the score.
The spirit must have been an
gered. The Indians kicked off and i
scored 10 seconds later to take
back the lead.
THE BRAVE defense buckled
down and held this slim lead for
over 25 tense minutes. Brandt,!
j Hemholz, Kadi, and Bianchi were j
I all over the field and a leaping, :
diving, scrapping Mueller kept
I things anchored brilliantly in the!
j goal.
A Spartan penalty kick at 1:40
I failed. Thirty seconds later th e
I seemingly inevitable tying goal
! came.
Neither team threatened in an
j overtime of two five minute per
| iods and the tie stood.
ALTHOUGH not happy about

JL
the outcome, Stanford coach Fred
Priddle praised his team. "They
did well. If we'd played that way
against them the last time we
would have won. Bui they (the
Spartans) wanted this one."
THE COACH did feel that on
a faster, better turfed field the
Tribe would have won.

THIS GOAL topped Stanford's
final game of the season against
Nor-Cal League leader San Jose I
State Friday night. The game,
played before a cold, wet, parti
san, and excited crowd, in cold,
soggy Spartan Stadium seemed a
do or die cause for both teams.
It was a strange mixture of
shoddy and simply beautiful play,
with few letdowns in excitement.
As play opened, it looked as if
it were going to be a Spartan day.
The Greeks were passing with j
precision and any attempt for the
Tribe to get into enemy territory
were stopped by the booming
kicks of the San Jose fulbacks.
Stanford played shoddy ball for
the first ten minutes, but finally
settled down to give San Jose a
game.
THE INDIAN'S ability to capi
talize on mistakes, while the Spar
tans blew many gifts from the ;
Stanford defense proved a big
difference in the early minutes.
With 40 seconds left in the first
quarter, Red left inside Klas
Bergman found himself all alone

in front of the nets and poked I
the ball into the lower right cor
ner, giving Stanford a 1-0 lead.
Stanford then took tho advan
tage in the second quarter with
the Spartans kicking open shots
i off to the side and over the nets.
With the quarter half-gone, a
Spartan fullback helped Bergman
! put in Stanford's second goal for
; a 2-0 lead.
THE ADVANTAGE see sawed
back and forth until SJS star A 1
Korbus scored on a fast break,
cutting the Indian margin to one.
The power of Zeus appeared
greater than that of the Great
l Spirit in the third period, as sev
j oral apparent Stanford goals!
bounced off the post or the po
tential scorer slipped just before)
the final shot.
Meanwhile, Ediok Akpan<
slipped one through Mueller'/
finger tips to tie the score.
The spirit must have been an
gered. The Indians kicked off and i
scored 10 seconds later to take
back the lead.
THE BRAVE defense buckled
down and held this slim lead for
over 25 tense minutes. Brandt,!
j Hemholz, Kadi, and Bianchi were j
I all over the field and a leaping, :
diving, scrapping Mueller kept
I things anchored brilliantly in the!
j goal.
A Spartan penalty kick at 1:40
I failed. Thirty seconds later th e
I seemingly inevitable tying goal
! came.
Neither team threatened in an
j overtime of two five minute per
| iods and the tie stood.
ALTHOUGH not happy about

JL
the outcome, Stanford coach Fred
Priddle praised his team. "They
did well. If we'd played that way
against them the last time we
would have won. Bui they (the
Spartans) wanted this one."
THE COACH did feel that on
a faster, better turfed field the
Tribe would have won.
