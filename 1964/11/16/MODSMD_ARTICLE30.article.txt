one for the Cards. Bill Ready led |
the bear baiting with four goals, i
while Brian Beck and Tom Chal- i
berg tallied twice apiece for Stan-!

first pushed the Stanford margin j
to 5-2 at half time. Cal never again ;
seriously threatened as Stanford
husted five more scores in the:
second half.
FOOTHILL topped the Cards;
8-4 in the second game, an icy af- i
fair Friday night. The contest was i
tight throughout the first half, j
Foothill scoring two in the first
period to Stanford's one.
Neither team could make goud !
a shot in the second period, Foot- j
hill being thwarted by Jim Ellis' j
six saves. Foothill opened the sec
ond half with a four-goal spurt j
and then kept the Tribe at bay for ;
the remainder of the game.
Stanford played the Olympic'
Club Saturday morning. Follow
ing the pattern of the earlier |
games, the first half was knotted, j
giving neither team a true advan
tag. The Olympic Club moved
from a 1-1 tie in the first period
to a 3-2 margin at the half. Mike
Eshelman and Bill Ready ac
counted for Stanford's two goals.
The third period. Stanford's
nemesis in the Foothill game,
came back to haunt the Tribe. The
Olympic Club scored twice to end
the scoring, 5-2 over the Indians.
FBI JSTRATED, the Tribe
dropped its last game to San Jose j
State, 3-2. Both of Stanford's goals
came by the hands of Bill Ready,
both in the first half. San Jose
scored once in the third period to
break a 2-2 tie and successfully
stalled for the rest of the game.
The Olympic Club became cham
pions of the league by defeating

Foothill 5-4 in a thrilling climax
to the tournament. The Olym
pians, after carrying a 5-2 lead,
barely beat off a fourth quarter
surge by Foothill to carry the con
test and the championship.
Stanford's 112 res hm a n team
boosted their season record to 12-
(i with a 14-12 victory over a tough
College of San Mateo squad. The
Papooses' Bill Meyer scored more
than half of Stanford's goals,
passing the CSM goalie eight
times.
