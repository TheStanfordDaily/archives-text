# Editor, The Daily
## Kappa Sigs Oppose Linking Stanford To The Miss. Project 
### 
Dear Sir:
We object to your continual
reference to the Mississippi Free
dom Projec: as a program en
dorsed by Stanford University.
We rile as an example the article
by Nancy L. Steffen in which she
makes such comments as, "The
peak of in crest was reached just
before ihe election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day . . ~" and
"Stanford's emotional ties with
the Mississippi Project . . ."
We do not believe that the en
thusiasm of the Project's workers
and certain members of the
Daily staff is necessarily indica
tive of the feeling of the majority
of Stanford students. For exam
ple, a poll of the members of our
living group shows lhat 35 oppose
the project, only 10 favor it, ;ind
five are undecided. The vast ma
jority of the 35 opposing the
Freedom Project do not, we em
phasize, oppose the civil rights
movement in general, but oppose
the approach taken by this par
ticular project. We are sure many
others feel the same way. There
fore, we suggest that you inves
tigate the sentiments of the en
tire student body before endors
ing the Mississippi Freedom Proj
ect with Stanford's name. You
may be surprised with the results.

Dear Editor:
Why are Stanford students in
Mississippi? The Mississippi Free
dom Project-Stanford group is not
helping the situation there; it is
only making matters worse Seg
regationists resent the intrusion
of others they regard as knowing
nothing about the problem, and I
question if any of the arrested
company from California, Illinois,
New York, Oregon. Germany, or
England could call themselves
well-qualified in knowledge of
Southern psychology. With each
voter the outsider registers, Mis
sissippi's own integi ationist ef
forts go down the drain, because
when the college student leaves,
resentment must fall on those
workers who remain, the well
meaning Mississippi c i t iz ens.
These are the very people who
can eventually bring about an in
tegrated South if college stu
dents will only stay away.
As a supporter of Proposition
14 on main 1 y Constitutional
grounds, who cannot keep a "Yes"
sticker on his car for moit? than
3(» hours before a violent negative
individual rips it off, I wonder
what sentiments, what atrocities
would greet a delegation from
Mississippi working for Proposi
tion 14 on the overwhelmingly lib
eral Stanford campus. Think of
how you'd feel, then get a refund
for your ticket.

• Conservative Rethink
Dear Sir:
Do not despair, conservatives,
says William Buckley, for "th e
socialist party in England only
five years ago lost by a percent
age roughly equal to Senator
Goldwatcr's, and there they are,
back in power" (Daily, November
9).
Let us examine the record, as
they say. In the British general
election of 1959, the percentage
poll was Conservative, 49.4; La
bour, 43.8; others, 6.8.

If Mr. Buckley really wishes to
:-,eek British analogies for the
current plight of the conserva
tives, perhaps he should go back
to 1915. Then the Conservative
party led by Winston Churchill
' suffered a humiliating defeat.
; much to the surprise of most
Americans. The Tories then con
i ducted a massive 're-think' under
j the guidance uf R. A. Butler, and
| considerably reduced the Labour
| majority in the 1950 election prior
| to regaining control in 1951.
What rethought policies led to
! this comeback? Suffice it to say
; that the Conservatives used such
(descriptions as "a re-adaptation
j to the realities of the mid-twen
tieth century," though many
; would doubt the accuracy of that
any longer. Mr. Buckley and his
fellows would shout, disparag
i ingly, "me-tooism." It worked
though, so evidently it provided
a sufficient choice.

• Threat To Democracy
Dear Sir:
Wej-e it not for John Mac-
Laren's clear-sighted letter on
Monday, many people might have
missed the underhanded slur at
Americanism so carefully hidden
in Mr. Common's article of last
Friday. Mr. MacLaren's percep
tive reasoning strips away Mr.
(Commons' cunning facade and
; reveals underneath an unwilling
ness to shape the unformed minds
of American youth. Mr. Commons'
j attack on "pro-American pro
paganda in the schools" obviously
i means that he is in favor of
! giving any political doctrine the
same consideration he would
American ideals. A more serious
threat to democracy cannot be
envisioned.
Perhaps there was once a time
when the rightness of democracy
was so obvious that given a free
choice people would choose it
'over all others. Perhaps there
was a time when Lincoln could
seriously conclude that you can't
fool all of the people all of the
time. But how very naive this
approach is today. The disease
like spread of atheistic Commu
nism necessitates a corollary to
Lincoln's words: " unless you
happen to be un-American, then
odds are that you can dupe most
of the people most of the time."
No, Mr. MacLaren is right;
such satements as Mr. Commons'
are definitely the type "one ex
pects from people with political
persuasions other than democ
racy. . . ." H is only through a
fortunate combination of his
torical freaks and divine guidance
that democracy has limped along
for the past 175 years. If it is to
survive, then dangerous opposing
doctrines cannot be taught in our
schools. To advocate, as does Mr.
i Commons, an unbiased presenta
tion of political philosophies is
to permit impressionable youth
| to choose something other than
i pure Americanism. Such un
guided ideas threaten democracy
and all it stands for.

• Nazi Horror Here?
Dear Sir:
Mr. Steingart's first letter led
' me to believe he was afraid Rock-
I well might succeed in gaining
i enough adherents to the Ameri
j can Nazi Party. His second letter

confirms my suspicions. In fact,
it goes two steps further. He im
plies: i) Ail Christian Caucasian
Americans are potentially Nazis
a contention almost too ludicrous
o merit reply and 2) he can
" . . . conceive of a situation not
far off when we may see I h e
United States playing the role of
Nazi Germany . . . because we re
fused to learn from history."
Whose ignorance of history is
noisily calling attention to itself?
Is he so conceited that he cannot
learn from history himself?
The Steingartian Oracle fatu
ously proclaims "The basis of my
opinion is a clearly documented
period in history from 1919 to
19-15." (I trust he means "in Ger
man history.") Whatever has
happened to that tool of ultimate
truth, the comparative study?
A comparative study of the Ger
man economy of the '30s and the
present American one, a compara
tive study of the Weimar consti
tution and German political situ
ation vs. the American, a com
parative study of national heri
tage (especially cultural and dip
plomatic), etc. all would be quite
enlightening. Apparently, these
are unsteingartion. He can be
forgiven these oversights by
pleading ignorance.
Aside from the issue of civil
liberties on which others have
answered Mr. Steingart, what
cannot be forgiven is his indict
ment of the Christian Caucasian
American. His bugaboo is in
keeping with a long tradition:
the post-World War I Bolshevik
scare in America, the '30s Fascist
fright and more recently, the Mr
Carthy madness. Each in its owr
way indicted the American pub
lic on the grounds that it was
"susceptible." Each in its own
way provided a forum for the
purgers to display their potential
danger as well as their ignor
ance. And each in its own wav
showed that it needs an unhealthy
mind to breeed its kind of sus
picion.

• Constructive RFing
Dear Sir:
With the large traffic of RFs
associated with Big Game, I would
like to differentiate between a
clever, constructive RF an d
thoughtless, destructive vandal
ism. Scott Mcßride and Charles
Powell had this distinction in
mind when they presented their
resolution in Wednesday's Daily.
The story of how Stanford
RFers twice captured ihe Cal
cannon is a model to good RFing.
There was no property damage
or personal injury inflicted by
this imaginative enterprise. The
same can be said of past S t a n
ford RFs such as the fake edition
of Big Game Californians.
Cal RFers have lacked this in
genuity and discretion. It will
take a great deal of time and ex
pense to remove the C from the
bookstore roof and the paint
from the chapel bells. Most
people are unimpressed by the
"imaginative sayings" that Cal
students annually paint about our
campus.
It is my sincere hope that
Stanford midnight excursions will
remain at the high level they have
held, and that Stanford students,
unlike Cal students, will not give
up imagination for a brush and
can of paint.

• Threat To Democracy
Dear Sir:
Wej-e it not for John Mac-
Laren's clear-sighted letter on
Monday, many people might have
missed the underhanded slur at
Americanism so carefully hidden
in Mr. Common's article of last
Friday. Mr. MacLaren's percep
tive reasoning strips away Mr.
(Commons' cunning facade and
; reveals underneath an unwilling
ness to shape the unformed minds
of American youth. Mr. Commons'
j attack on "pro-American pro
paganda in the schools" obviously
i means that he is in favor of
! giving any political doctrine the
same consideration he would
American ideals. A more serious
threat to democracy cannot be
envisioned.
Perhaps there was once a time
when the rightness of democracy
was so obvious that given a free
choice people would choose it
'over all others. Perhaps there
was a time when Lincoln could
seriously conclude that you can't
fool all of the people all of the
time. But how very naive this
approach is today. The disease
like spread of atheistic Commu
nism necessitates a corollary to
Lincoln's words: " unless you
happen to be un-American, then
odds are that you can dupe most
of the people most of the time."
No, Mr. MacLaren is right;
such satements as Mr. Commons'
are definitely the type "one ex
pects from people with political
persuasions other than democ
racy. . . ." H is only through a
fortunate combination of his
torical freaks and divine guidance
that democracy has limped along
for the past 175 years. If it is to
survive, then dangerous opposing
doctrines cannot be taught in our
schools. To advocate, as does Mr.
i Commons, an unbiased presenta
tion of political philosophies is
to permit impressionable youth
| to choose something other than
i pure Americanism. Such un
guided ideas threaten democracy
and all it stands for.

• Nazi Horror Here?
Dear Sir:
Mr. Steingart's first letter led
' me to believe he was afraid Rock-
I well might succeed in gaining
i enough adherents to the Ameri
j can Nazi Party. His second letter

confirms my suspicions. In fact,
it goes two steps further. He im
plies: i) Ail Christian Caucasian
Americans are potentially Nazis
a contention almost too ludicrous
o merit reply and 2) he can
" . . . conceive of a situation not
far off when we may see I h e
United States playing the role of
Nazi Germany . . . because we re
fused to learn from history."
Whose ignorance of history is
noisily calling attention to itself?
Is he so conceited that he cannot
learn from history himself?
The Steingartian Oracle fatu
ously proclaims "The basis of my
opinion is a clearly documented
period in history from 1919 to
19-15." (I trust he means "in Ger
man history.") Whatever has
happened to that tool of ultimate
truth, the comparative study?
A comparative study of the Ger
man economy of the '30s and the
present American one, a compara
tive study of the Weimar consti
tution and German political situ
ation vs. the American, a com
parative study of national heri
tage (especially cultural and dip
plomatic), etc. all would be quite
enlightening. Apparently, these
are unsteingartion. He can be
forgiven these oversights by
pleading ignorance.
Aside from the issue of civil
liberties on which others have
answered Mr. Steingart, what
cannot be forgiven is his indict
ment of the Christian Caucasian
American. His bugaboo is in
keeping with a long tradition:
the post-World War I Bolshevik
scare in America, the '30s Fascist
fright and more recently, the Mr
Carthy madness. Each in its owr
way indicted the American pub
lic on the grounds that it was
"susceptible." Each in its own
way provided a forum for the
purgers to display their potential
danger as well as their ignor
ance. And each in its own wav
showed that it needs an unhealthy
mind to breeed its kind of sus
picion.

• Constructive RFing
Dear Sir:
With the large traffic of RFs
associated with Big Game, I would
like to differentiate between a
clever, constructive RF an d
thoughtless, destructive vandal
ism. Scott Mcßride and Charles
Powell had this distinction in
mind when they presented their
resolution in Wednesday's Daily.
The story of how Stanford
RFers twice captured ihe Cal
cannon is a model to good RFing.
There was no property damage
or personal injury inflicted by
this imaginative enterprise. The
same can be said of past S t a n
ford RFs such as the fake edition
of Big Game Californians.
Cal RFers have lacked this in
genuity and discretion. It will
take a great deal of time and ex
pense to remove the C from the
bookstore roof and the paint
from the chapel bells. Most
people are unimpressed by the
"imaginative sayings" that Cal
students annually paint about our
campus.
It is my sincere hope that
Stanford midnight excursions will
remain at the high level they have
held, and that Stanford students,
unlike Cal students, will not give
up imagination for a brush and
can of paint.

Dear Sir:
We object to your continual
reference to the Mississippi Free

We rile as an example the article

makes such comments as, "The
peak of in crest was reached just
before ihe election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day . . ~" and
"Stanford's emotional ties with
the Mississippi Project . . ."
We do not believe that the en

and certain members of the
Daily staff is necessarily indica

of Stanford students. For exam
ple, a poll of the members of our

the project, only 10 favor it, ;ind
five are undecided. The vast ma
jority of the 35 opposing the

the approach taken by this par

Dear Editor:
Why are Stanford students in
Mississippi? The Mississippi Free
dom Project-Stanford group is not
helping the situation there; it is
only making matters worse Seg
regationists resent the intrusion
of others they regard as knowing
nothing about the problem, and I
question if any of the arrested
company from California, Illinois,
New York, Oregon. Germany, or
England could call themselves
well-qualified in knowledge of
Southern psychology. With each
voter the outsider registers, Mis
sissippi's own integi ationist ef
forts go down the drain, because
when the college student leaves,
resentment must fall on those
workers who remain, the well

These are the very people who
can eventually bring about an in

• Nazi Horror Here?
Dear Sir:
Mr. Steingart's first letter led
' me to believe he was afraid Rock-
I well might succeed in gaining
i enough adherents to the Ameri
j can Nazi Party. His second letter

confirms my suspicions. In fact,
it goes two steps further. He im
plies: i) Ail Christian Caucasian
Americans are potentially Nazis
a contention almost too ludicrous
o merit reply and 2) he can
" . . . conceive of a situation not
far off when we may see I h e
United States playing the role of
Nazi Germany . . . because we re
fused to learn from history."
Whose ignorance of history is
noisily calling attention to itself?
Is he so conceited that he cannot
learn from history himself?
The Steingartian Oracle fatu
ously proclaims "The basis of my
opinion is a clearly documented
period in history from 1919 to
19-15." (I trust he means "in Ger
man history.") Whatever has
happened to that tool of ultimate
truth, the comparative study?
A comparative study of the Ger
man economy of the '30s and the
present American one, a compara
tive study of the Weimar consti
tution and German political situ
ation vs. the American, a com
parative study of national heri
tage (especially cultural and dip
plomatic), etc. all would be quite
enlightening. Apparently, these
are unsteingartion. He can be
forgiven these oversights by
pleading ignorance.
Aside from the issue of civil
liberties on which others have
answered Mr. Steingart, what
cannot be forgiven is his indict
ment of the Christian Caucasian
American. His bugaboo is in
keeping with a long tradition:
the post-World War I Bolshevik
scare in America, the '30s Fascist
fright and more recently, the Mr
Carthy madness. Each in its owr
way indicted the American pub
lic on the grounds that it was
"susceptible." Each in its own

• Constructive RFing
Dear Sir:
With the large traffic of RFs
associated with Big Game, I would
like to differentiate between a
clever, constructive RF an d
thoughtless, destructive vandal
ism. Scott Mcßride and Charles
Powell had this distinction in
mind when they presented their
resolution in Wednesday's Daily.
The story of how Stanford
RFers twice captured ihe Cal
cannon is a model to good RFing.
There was no property damage
or personal injury inflicted by
this imaginative enterprise. The
same can be said of past S t a n
ford RFs such as the fake edition
of Big Game Californians.
Cal RFers have lacked this in
genuity and discretion. It will
take a great deal of time and ex
pense to remove the C from the
bookstore roof and the paint
from the chapel bells. Most
people are unimpressed by the
"imaginative sayings" that Cal
students annually paint about our
campus.
It is my sincere hope that
Stanford midnight excursions will
remain at the high level they have
held, and that Stanford students,
unlike Cal students, will not give
up imagination for a brush and
can of paint.

Dear Sir:
We object to your continual
reference to the Mississippi Free
dom Projec: as a program en
dorsed by Stanford University.
We rile as an example the article
by Nancy L. Steffen in which she
makes such comments as, "The
peak of in crest was reached just
before ihe election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day . . ~" and
"Stanford's emotional ties with
the Mississippi Project . . ."
We do not believe that the en
thusiasm of the Project's workers
and certain members of the
Daily staff is necessarily indica
tive of the feeling of the majority
of Stanford students. For exam
ple, a poll of the members of our
living group shows lhat 35 oppose
the project, only 10 favor it, ;ind
five are undecided. The vast ma
jority of the 35 opposing the
Freedom Project do not, we em
phasize, oppose the civil rights
movement in general, but oppose
the approach taken by this par
ticular project. We are sure many
others feel the same way. There

• Mississippi Project
Dear Editor:
Why are Stanford students in
Mississippi? The Mississippi Free
dom Project-Stanford group is not
helping the situation there; it is
only making matters worse Seg
regationists resent the intrusion
of others they regard as knowing
nothing about the problem, and I
question if any of the arrested
company from California, Illinois,
New York, Oregon. Germany, or
England could call themselves
well-qualified in knowledge of
Southern psychology. With each
voter the outsider registers, Mis
sissippi's own integi ationist ef
forts go down the drain, because
when the college student leaves,
resentment must fall on those
workers who remain, the well
meaning Mississippi c i t iz ens.
These are the very people who
can eventually bring about an in
tegrated South if college stu
dents will only stay away.
As a supporter of Proposition
14 on main 1 y Constitutional
grounds, who cannot keep a "Yes"
sticker on his car for moit? than
3(» hours before a violent negative
individual rips it off, I wonder
what sentiments, what atrocities
would greet a delegation from

• Conservative Rethink
Dear Sir:
Do not despair, conservatives,
says William Buckley, for "th e
socialist party in England only
five years ago lost by a percent
age roughly equal to Senator
Goldwatcr's, and there they are,
back in power" (Daily, November
9).
Let us examine the record, as
they say. In the British general
election of 1959, the percentage
poll was Conservative, 49.4; La
bour, 43.8; others, 6.8.

If Mr. Buckley really wishes to
:-,eek British analogies for the
current plight of the conserva
tives, perhaps he should go back
to 1915. Then the Conservative
party led by Winston Churchill
' suffered a humiliating defeat.
; much to the surprise of most
Americans. The Tories then con
i ducted a massive 're-think' under
j the guidance uf R. A. Butler, and
| considerably reduced the Labour
| majority in the 1950 election prior
| to regaining control in 1951.
What rethought policies led to
! this comeback? Suffice it to say
; that the Conservatives used such
(descriptions as "a re-adaptation
j to the realities of the mid-twen
tieth century," though many
; would doubt the accuracy of that
any longer. Mr. Buckley and his
fellows would shout, disparag

though, so evidently it provided
a sufficient choice.

• Threat To Democracy
Dear Sir:
Wej-e it not for John Mac-
Laren's clear-sighted letter on
Monday, many people might have
missed the underhanded slur at
Americanism so carefully hidden
in Mr. Common's article of last
Friday. Mr. MacLaren's percep
tive reasoning strips away Mr.
(Commons' cunning facade and
; reveals underneath an unwilling
ness to shape the unformed minds
of American youth. Mr. Commons'
j attack on "pro-American pro
paganda in the schools" obviously
i means that he is in favor of
! giving any political doctrine the
same consideration he would
American ideals. A more serious
threat to democracy cannot be
envisioned.
Perhaps there was once a time
when the rightness of democracy
was so obvious that given a free
choice people would choose it
'over all others. Perhaps there
was a time when Lincoln could
seriously conclude that you can't
fool all of the people all of the
time. But how very naive this
approach is today. The disease
like spread of atheistic Commu
nism necessitates a corollary to
Lincoln's words: " unless you
happen to be un-American, then
odds are that you can dupe most
of the people most of the time."
No, Mr. MacLaren is right;
such satements as Mr. Commons'
are definitely the type "one ex
pects from people with political
persuasions other than democ
racy. . . ." H is only through a
fortunate combination of his

Dear Sir:
We object to your continual
reference to the Mississippi Free
dom Projec: as a program en
dorsed by Stanford University.
We rile as an example the article
by Nancy L. Steffen in which she
makes such comments as, "The
peak of in crest was reached just
before ihe election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day . . ~" and
"Stanford's emotional ties with
the Mississippi Project . . ."
We do not believe that the en
thusiasm of the Project's workers
and certain members of the
Daily staff is necessarily indica
tive of the feeling of the majority
of Stanford students. For exam
ple, a poll of the members of our
living group shows lhat 35 oppose
the project, only 10 favor it, ;ind
five are undecided. The vast ma
jority of the 35 opposing the
Freedom Project do not, we em
phasize, oppose the civil rights
movement in general, but oppose
the approach taken by this par
ticular project. We are sure many
others feel the same way. There

Dear Editor:
Why are Stanford students in
Mississippi? The Mississippi Free
dom Project-Stanford group is not
helping the situation there; it is
only making matters worse Seg
regationists resent the intrusion
of others they regard as knowing
nothing about the problem, and I
question if any of the arrested
company from California, Illinois,
New York, Oregon. Germany, or
England could call themselves
well-qualified in knowledge of
Southern psychology. With each
voter the outsider registers, Mis
sissippi's own integi ationist ef
forts go down the drain, because
when the college student leaves,
resentment must fall on those
workers who remain, the well
meaning Mississippi c i t iz ens.
These are the very people who
can eventually bring about an in
tegrated South if college stu
dents will only stay away.
As a supporter of Proposition
14 on main 1 y Constitutional
grounds, who cannot keep a "Yes"
sticker on his car for moit? than
3(» hours before a violent negative
individual rips it off, I wonder
what sentiments, what atrocities
would greet a delegation from
Mississippi working for Proposi
tion 14 on the overwhelmingly lib
eral Stanford campus. Think of
how you'd feel, then get a refund
for your ticket.

• Conservative Rethink
Dear Sir:
Do not despair, conservatives,
says William Buckley, for "th e
socialist party in England only
five years ago lost by a percent
age roughly equal to Senator
Goldwatcr's, and there they are,
back in power" (Daily, November
9).
Let us examine the record, as
they say. In the British general
election of 1959, the percentage
poll was Conservative, 49.4; La
bour, 43.8; others, 6.8.

If Mr. Buckley really wishes to
:-,eek British analogies for the
current plight of the conserva
tives, perhaps he should go back
to 1915. Then the Conservative
party led by Winston Churchill
' suffered a humiliating defeat.
; much to the surprise of most
Americans. The Tories then con
i ducted a massive 're-think' under
j the guidance uf R. A. Butler, and
| considerably reduced the Labour
| majority in the 1950 election prior
| to regaining control in 1951.
What rethought policies led to
! this comeback? Suffice it to say
; that the Conservatives used such
(descriptions as "a re-adaptation
j to the realities of the mid-twen
tieth century," though many
; would doubt the accuracy of that
any longer. Mr. Buckley and his
fellows would shout, disparag
i ingly, "me-tooism." It worked
though, so evidently it provided
a sufficient choice.

• Threat To Democracy
Dear Sir:
Wej-e it not for John Mac-
Laren's clear-sighted letter on
Monday, many people might have
missed the underhanded slur at
Americanism so carefully hidden
in Mr. Common's article of last
Friday. Mr. MacLaren's percep
tive reasoning strips away Mr.
(Commons' cunning facade and
; reveals underneath an unwilling
ness to shape the unformed minds
of American youth. Mr. Commons'
j attack on "pro-American pro
paganda in the schools" obviously
i means that he is in favor of
! giving any political doctrine the
same consideration he would
American ideals. A more serious
threat to democracy cannot be
envisioned.
Perhaps there was once a time
when the rightness of democracy
was so obvious that given a free
choice people would choose it
'over all others. Perhaps there
was a time when Lincoln could
seriously conclude that you can't
fool all of the people all of the
time. But how very naive this
approach is today. The disease
like spread of atheistic Commu
nism necessitates a corollary to
Lincoln's words: " unless you
happen to be un-American, then
odds are that you can dupe most
of the people most of the time."
No, Mr. MacLaren is right;
such satements as Mr. Commons'
are definitely the type "one ex
pects from people with political
persuasions other than democ
racy. . . ." H is only through a
fortunate combination of his
torical freaks and divine guidance
that democracy has limped along
for the past 175 years. If it is to
survive, then dangerous opposing
doctrines cannot be taught in our
schools. To advocate, as does Mr.
i Commons, an unbiased presenta
tion of political philosophies is
to permit impressionable youth
| to choose something other than
i pure Americanism. Such un
guided ideas threaten democracy
and all it stands for.

• Nazi Horror Here?
Dear Sir:
Mr. Steingart's first letter led
' me to believe he was afraid Rock-
I well might succeed in gaining
i enough adherents to the Ameri
j can Nazi Party. His second letter

confirms my suspicions. In fact,
it goes two steps further. He im
plies: i) Ail Christian Caucasian
Americans are potentially Nazis
a contention almost too ludicrous
o merit reply and 2) he can
" . . . conceive of a situation not
far off when we may see I h e
United States playing the role of
Nazi Germany . . . because we re
fused to learn from history."
Whose ignorance of history is
noisily calling attention to itself?
Is he so conceited that he cannot
learn from history himself?
The Steingartian Oracle fatu
ously proclaims "The basis of my
opinion is a clearly documented
period in history from 1919 to
19-15." (I trust he means "in Ger
man history.") Whatever has
happened to that tool of ultimate
truth, the comparative study?
A comparative study of the Ger
man economy of the '30s and the
present American one, a compara
tive study of the Weimar consti
tution and German political situ
ation vs. the American, a com
parative study of national heri
tage (especially cultural and dip
plomatic), etc. all would be quite
enlightening. Apparently, these
are unsteingartion. He can be
forgiven these oversights by
pleading ignorance.
Aside from the issue of civil
liberties on which others have
answered Mr. Steingart, what
cannot be forgiven is his indict
ment of the Christian Caucasian
American. His bugaboo is in
keeping with a long tradition:
the post-World War I Bolshevik
scare in America, the '30s Fascist
fright and more recently, the Mr
Carthy madness. Each in its owr
way indicted the American pub
lic on the grounds that it was
"susceptible." Each in its own
way provided a forum for the
purgers to display their potential
danger as well as their ignor
ance. And each in its own wav
showed that it needs an unhealthy
mind to breeed its kind of sus
picion.

• Conservative Rethink
Dear Sir:
Do not despair, conservatives,
says William Buckley, for "th e
socialist party in England only
five years ago lost by a percent
age roughly equal to Senator
Goldwatcr's, and there they are,
back in power" (Daily, November
9).
Let us examine the record, as
they say. In the British general
election of 1959, the percentage
poll was Conservative, 49.4; La
bour, 43.8; others, 6.8.

If Mr. Buckley really wishes to
:-,eek British analogies for the
current plight of the conserva
tives, perhaps he should go back
to 1915. Then the Conservative
party led by Winston Churchill
' suffered a humiliating defeat.
; much to the surprise of most
Americans. The Tories then con
i ducted a massive 're-think' under
j the guidance uf R. A. Butler, and
| considerably reduced the Labour
| majority in the 1950 election prior
| to regaining control in 1951.
What rethought policies led to
! this comeback? Suffice it to say
; that the Conservatives used such
(descriptions as "a re-adaptation
j to the realities of the mid-twen
tieth century," though many
; would doubt the accuracy of that
any longer. Mr. Buckley and his
fellows would shout, disparag
i ingly, "me-tooism." It worked
though, so evidently it provided
a sufficient choice.

• Threat To Democracy
Dear Sir:
Wej-e it not for John Mac-
Laren's clear-sighted letter on
Monday, many people might have
missed the underhanded slur at
Americanism so carefully hidden
in Mr. Common's article of last
Friday. Mr. MacLaren's percep
tive reasoning strips away Mr.
(Commons' cunning facade and
; reveals underneath an unwilling
ness to shape the unformed minds
of American youth. Mr. Commons'
j attack on "pro-American pro
paganda in the schools" obviously
i means that he is in favor of
! giving any political doctrine the
same consideration he would
American ideals. A more serious
threat to democracy cannot be
envisioned.
Perhaps there was once a time
when the rightness of democracy
was so obvious that given a free
choice people would choose it
'over all others. Perhaps there
was a time when Lincoln could
seriously conclude that you can't
fool all of the people all of the
time. But how very naive this
approach is today. The disease
like spread of atheistic Commu
nism necessitates a corollary to
Lincoln's words: " unless you
happen to be un-American, then
odds are that you can dupe most
of the people most of the time."
No, Mr. MacLaren is right;
such satements as Mr. Commons'
are definitely the type "one ex
pects from people with political
persuasions other than democ
racy. . . ." H is only through a
fortunate combination of his
torical freaks and divine guidance
that democracy has limped along
for the past 175 years. If it is to
survive, then dangerous opposing
doctrines cannot be taught in our
schools. To advocate, as does Mr.
i Commons, an unbiased presenta
tion of political philosophies is
to permit impressionable youth
| to choose something other than
i pure Americanism. Such un
guided ideas threaten democracy
and all it stands for.

• Nazi Horror Here?
Dear Sir:
Mr. Steingart's first letter led
' me to believe he was afraid Rock-
I well might succeed in gaining
i enough adherents to the Ameri
j can Nazi Party. His second letter

confirms my suspicions. In fact,
it goes two steps further. He im
plies: i) Ail Christian Caucasian
Americans are potentially Nazis
a contention almost too ludicrous
o merit reply and 2) he can
" . . . conceive of a situation not
far off when we may see I h e
United States playing the role of
Nazi Germany . . . because we re
fused to learn from history."
Whose ignorance of history is
noisily calling attention to itself?
Is he so conceited that he cannot
learn from history himself?
The Steingartian Oracle fatu
ously proclaims "The basis of my
opinion is a clearly documented
period in history from 1919 to
19-15." (I trust he means "in Ger
man history.") Whatever has
happened to that tool of ultimate
truth, the comparative study?
A comparative study of the Ger
man economy of the '30s and the
present American one, a compara
tive study of the Weimar consti
tution and German political situ
ation vs. the American, a com
parative study of national heri
tage (especially cultural and dip
plomatic), etc. all would be quite
enlightening. Apparently, these
are unsteingartion. He can be
forgiven these oversights by
pleading ignorance.
Aside from the issue of civil
liberties on which others have
answered Mr. Steingart, what
cannot be forgiven is his indict
ment of the Christian Caucasian
American. His bugaboo is in
keeping with a long tradition:
the post-World War I Bolshevik
scare in America, the '30s Fascist
fright and more recently, the Mr
Carthy madness. Each in its owr
way indicted the American pub
lic on the grounds that it was
"susceptible." Each in its own
way provided a forum for the
purgers to display their potential
danger as well as their ignor
ance. And each in its own wav
showed that it needs an unhealthy
mind to breeed its kind of sus
picion.

• Constructive RFing
Dear Sir:
With the large traffic of RFs
associated with Big Game, I would
like to differentiate between a
clever, constructive RF an d
thoughtless, destructive vandal
ism. Scott Mcßride and Charles
Powell had this distinction in
mind when they presented their
resolution in Wednesday's Daily.
The story of how Stanford
RFers twice captured ihe Cal
cannon is a model to good RFing.
There was no property damage
or personal injury inflicted by
this imaginative enterprise. The
same can be said of past S t a n
ford RFs such as the fake edition
of Big Game Californians.
Cal RFers have lacked this in
genuity and discretion. It will
take a great deal of time and ex
pense to remove the C from the
bookstore roof and the paint
from the chapel bells. Most
people are unimpressed by the
"imaginative sayings" that Cal
students annually paint about our
campus.
It is my sincere hope that
Stanford midnight excursions will
remain at the high level they have
held, and that Stanford students,
unlike Cal students, will not give
up imagination for a brush and
can of paint.

Dear Sir:
We object to your continual
reference to the Mississippi Free
dom Projec: as a program en
dorsed by Stanford University.
We rile as an example the article
by Nancy L. Steffen in which she
makes such comments as, "The
peak of in crest was reached just
before ihe election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day . . ~" and
"Stanford's emotional ties with
the Mississippi Project . . ."
We do not believe that the en
thusiasm of the Project's workers
and certain members of the
Daily staff is necessarily indica
tive of the feeling of the majority
of Stanford students. For exam
ple, a poll of the members of our
living group shows lhat 35 oppose
the project, only 10 favor it, ;ind
five are undecided. The vast ma
jority of the 35 opposing the
Freedom Project do not, we em
phasize, oppose the civil rights
movement in general, but oppose
the approach taken by this par
ticular project. We are sure many
others feel the same way. There
fore, we suggest that you inves
tigate the sentiments of the en
tire student body before endors
ing the Mississippi Freedom Proj
ect with Stanford's name. You
may be surprised with the results.

• Mississippi Project
Dear Editor:
Why are Stanford students in
Mississippi? The Mississippi Free
dom Project-Stanford group is not
helping the situation there; it is
only making matters worse Seg
regationists resent the intrusion
of others they regard as knowing
nothing about the problem, and I
question if any of the arrested
company from California, Illinois,
New York, Oregon. Germany, or
England could call themselves
well-qualified in knowledge of
Southern psychology. With each
voter the outsider registers, Mis
sissippi's own integi ationist ef
forts go down the drain, because
when the college student leaves,
resentment must fall on those
workers who remain, the well
