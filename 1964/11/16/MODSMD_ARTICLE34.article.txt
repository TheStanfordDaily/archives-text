## A 						Potpourri Of Opinions, Rumors And Speculations 
### Justin Beck 
One of the more interesting aspects of working lor The Daily
I is the collection of rumors, opinions, speculations, and occasional
I news items that one can accumulate in the course of a quarter.
Since there is no Walter Winchell or Drew Pearson on campus
' these seldom see the light of clay, lacking enough ncwswortliiness

j in themselves to justify publica-*
i tion. But those that follow are in- j
teresting and to a large degree
| are indicative oi' a student's view
: of many of the minor issues on
campus which never reach the
public eye.

j One complaint recently regis
tei-ed by students against the
Dean of Women is her reported
•move in restricting the number
of women participating in the
Wilbur Associate Program to one
! per house. Dean Allen supposed
ly argues that to have any more;
than eight women eat meals at
Wilbur would sap leadership from -
I women's dorms.

The Financial Director of the ;
ASSU, app tinted by President i
Sterling, is believed to be the I
I main botth eek in a move to es-!
!;iMj h potty cash funds for SOF j
| controlled liv ing groups. As the j
| system is now. every expenditure i
has to be separately approved by I
the student financial manager, re- j
suiting in endless paperwork fori
[those unfortunate students who j
are named as house treasurers.

. What frosh dollies aren't writ- j
I ing home separate lists of girls ;
i going on fraternity overnights, j
Reportedly several frosh dollies
have been upset when their dates
have asked them to state a pre
ference as to bedroom aceom
l modations. But the liberally mind
led fratmen apparently feel that
i any girl who does not wish to
sleep with her date doesn't have:
i to. as long as she decides ahead ,
of time.

LASSU members are currently ;
laughing about Administration;
I claims of a "power vacuum." i
Most members feel that the vac- i
; uum exists only in the adminis- j
j tration's minds.

Who was it that Professor i
i James T. Wat kins singled out at
| the first I.F.C. meeting of the
i year as the fraternities' greatest
i enemy? Fratmen were shocked to :
| find that their enemy is even
more strongly entrenched at this j
| university than they are.

j j
Is it true that there is a sacred j
| fish hidden away in the museum i
basement? One student claims I
I that Leland's brother Tom Stan
ford sent th e museum several
sacred fish that fell from the sky.
but that these interesting items
have not been displayed. Tom's

¥
I other gift to the University, a
chair of the study of the occult,
;is likewise being ignored by the
| University.

The new faculty club, now un
der construction, will be bringing
liquor that much closer to eur
j rently dry Tresidder Union. Ad
ministration thinkers have report
edly found a method of circum
venting University regulations
barring liquor from campus. They
feel that a dry faculty club just
i isn't right.

, Dean Gordon could be 1 tying
to smother the I.F.C. rush policy.
It was developed last spring and
! still no action has been taken. Per
haps the new rush policy is too
| reactionary for even the Arimin
! istration to handle.
* * *
j A proposal to stimulate all new
! women's housing on the other
side of campus from the men
I may have been formed in re-
I sponse to pressure from the Dean
IoJ Women's office. Dean Allen
seems to believe that geograph
' ieal separation is the best solu
11ion to threats of boy-girl dating
| on campus.

One sponsor has recently com
plained that "fear" is the motiv
ating force behind enforcement
of the social regulations for fresh
men. However, sponsors are una
nimous in justifying the system
as necessary to protect their
charges.

Some LASSU members are pri
j vately disturbed at the less than
I enthusiastic response the Admin
istration has shown to LASSU
I committees. The administration
| reportedly prefers to deal with
! ASSU President Scott Mcßride on
| important issues, possibly because
! of a fear that LASSU may be less
j pliable than the student body
president. They are also saying
; that Mcßride seems to forget his
self-proclaimed role as University
"critic" when he sits down across
from administrators.
* * *
A rumor is currently going
around the student body that
I Norman Mailer, Fulton Lewis,
and Eugene Burdick are current
: ly persona non grata on campus.
| All three have been critical of
i the University at one time or an
! other during their public careers.
* * *
Associates of ASSU President
Scott Mcßride are currently
claiming credit for a new com
mittee formed to investigate a
possible SU tie-up with student
work projects. Other students
state that this just isn't so, that
discussions along those lines be
gan last year under Bud Wedin,
Mcßride's predecessor.

Why didn't John Dos Passos
speak at ihe Tuesday Evening
Series? Although there may be
(other reasons behind it, students
j are complaining that Dos Passos
I was felt to he too political for
I that staid group to handle.
