# Indians Trap Beavers, 16-7
## 
### BETH STEVENS 
Oregon Slate was entertaining
I thoughts of the Rose Bowl, and
j Stanford was perhaps thinking
; about the Big Game a week away.
| Stanford, which normally
j doesn't thrive on opponent's mis
j cues, turned a fumble and a pen
j alty for too many men on the
' field to advantage. The fumble led
[ to a Braden Beck three-pointer
1 and the penalty kept alive a drive
that led ultimately to the Tribe's
first TD.
But the Beavers daydreamed
too much, and the Indians upset
I the visitors from Stanford's favor
j ite state, lfj-7.
OREGON STATK, ranked sec
! ond to USC in AAWU defensive
statistics, met its match in an in
spired Stanford defense that
I didn't let the Beavers out of their
I own territory until the second

quarter. Gary Petti grow, Stan
ford's 215-pound tackle from
Washington, was voted lineman of
the game.
Stanford meanwhile was
thwarted by two Beaver goal-line
stands on the one-yard line and
had to settle for a 3-0 halftime
lead on ;i 23-yard Beck field goal.
THE SECOND half was another
story as sophomore QB Lewis, in
his first start for the Indians,
moved them (54 yards in 15 plays
and 57 yards in 5 plays for 12
points of insurance.
But the Beaver offensive unit
finally got going with 4min
utes remaining in the third stanza
as Brothers piloted them 77 yards
in just five plays and hit Bob
Grim in the end zone with a 21-
yard TD pass for Oregon State's
only score.
CARDS' first points came on a
miscalculation by Oregon State

safely Dan Espalin. fielding a
punt by Lewis in the first quarter.
Espalin signalled for a fair catch
but let the ball bounce toward
the end /one as he held off sev
eral Indians trying to down it. But
the football didn't play along, hit
ting Espalin's log and finally be
ing grabbed by John Guillory to
give Stanford first and goal on
the 8.
Handley was stopped cold at
right guard, but got five through
the middle on second try. Bob
Blunt lost 3 around right end, and
on fourth and six Beck came in
to kick his ninth field goal of the
season.
STANFOKI) came back in the
third as an illegal procedure pen
alty against OSU for having
twelve mon on the field put t he
Tribe on the 50 with first and 10.
Stanford marched to the 24, Hand
ley steam-rollered for 12 up the
middle, and the referees walked
off six more yards as an OSU
player drew a personal foul. Three
plays gained five yards before
Middlehauff nudged it over from
the one on third down.
At 1:07 Bob Blunt sprinted 2-1
yards over left end. eluding two
would-be tacklers at the 19 and
outdistancing the OSU secondary
to the end /one. Beck's kick was
good; and off-again, on-again,
Stanford had turned the AAWU
upside down again with a 16-7 up
set of the conference-loading Beav
ers.
