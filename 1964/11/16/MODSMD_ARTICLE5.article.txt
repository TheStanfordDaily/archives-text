a constitutional regime. Russia
very quickly developed very pow
erful industry, and we were on
the eve of a new political regime

When the Bolsheviks took over,

was Lenin, supported by the Ger
mans. One the other side, General
Kornilov was supported by a very
small portion of the Russian

to fight the Communists while
fighting the, in my opinion, reac
