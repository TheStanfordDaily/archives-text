# SNCC CONFERENCE
## McComb Tension Rising 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
"Tension is building up in McComb again. You
can foci it," Dennis Sweeney lold an audience of
500 at the West Coast Conference of the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee <SNCCi in
San Francisco this weekend.
Sweeney, a former Stanford student on leave
to work with the Mississippi Freedom Project in
McComb. returned briefly here last Friday along
with Robert Moses, Program Director for the
Project, to attend the three-day conference. He and
Moses left today for Mississippi where Sweeney
faces trial soon on a "trespassing" charge.
IN A SHORT speech to the conference to the
conference delegates, Sweeney stressed that when
the local authorities want to control the violence
they can. "This summer," he recalled, "things were
relatively quiet in McComb. We felt significant re
straints had been applied to the white community.
"The thing was that these people really believed
that we'd leave in the fall.'' Sweeney continued.
"And when we didn't they got irate." By late Sep
tember. the Project and the local Negro commu
nity had endured sixteen bombings, and innumer
able waves of arrests.
'Then another kind of pressure stopped the vio
lence for a while . . . . " Sweeney explained, "We
sent three of the ladies whose homes had been
bombed to Washington to see the President. After
throe d.ivs when he realized he wasnf iroini! to

gel rid of them, lie saw them. What's more, Drew
Pearson saw them, and he started writing about
Mississippi." The situation in McComb calmed
down.
PROJECT DIRECTOR Moses, keynote speaker
of the Conference followed Sweeney.
"I think we will get violence in the North,"
Moses said. "In the big cities those are our jun
gles. There's room enough to hide. But in the South,
things are different. The Negro is too exposed."
The Mississippi Negro is armed for self protec
tion. Moses explained. "The right to defend one's
property, even for Negroes is deeply ingrained in
the Southern Code. . . . Besides, the people who
preach non-violence as a theory of love aren't the
people who are down there." he commented.
TIIE .MISSISSIPPI MOVEMENT, as Moses in
vasions it. is not an effort to "integrate." "What
needs to happen is not to have bridges between the
white and Negro, but for the white to be free with
in his own community to discuss issues and find
some answers for himself. ..."
When Moses came to Mississippi in H<Gl he
went to McComb, one of the toughest areas in the
state. "The logical place to begin was any place."
he explained. "I went down to see what could Ix*
done. And the first thing that I learned was what
couldn't be done, and that helped to define what
could. What 1 learned was all that's involved in
setting up a society for people to run ihcir own
lives' . . People have to run their own lives."

San Francisco this weekend.
Sweeney, a former Stanford student on leave
to work with the Mississippi Freedom Project in
McComb. returned briefly here last Friday along
with Robert Moses, Program Director for the
Project, to attend the three-day conference. He and
Moses left today for Mississippi where Sweeney
faces trial soon on a "trespassing" charge.
IN A SHORT speech to the conference to the
conference delegates, Sweeney stressed that when
the local authorities want to control the violence
they can. "This summer," he recalled, "things were
relatively quiet in McComb. We felt significant re
straints had been applied to the white community.
"The thing was that these people really believed
that we'd leave in the fall.'' Sweeney continued.
"And when we didn't they got irate." By late Sep
tember. the Project and the local Negro commu
nity had endured sixteen bombings, and innumer
able waves of arrests.
'Then another kind of pressure stopped the vio
lence for a while . . . . " Sweeney explained, "We
sent three of the ladies whose homes had been
bombed to Washington to see the President. After
throe d.ivs when he realized he wasnf iroini! to

gel rid of them, lie saw them. What's more, Drew
Pearson saw them, and he started writing about
Mississippi." The situation in McComb calmed
down.
PROJECT DIRECTOR Moses, keynote speaker
of the Conference followed Sweeney.
"I think we will get violence in the North,"
Moses said. "In the big cities those are our jun
gles. There's room enough to hide. But in the South,
things are different. The Negro is too exposed."
The Mississippi Negro is armed for self protec
tion. Moses explained. "The right to defend one's
property, even for Negroes is deeply ingrained in
the Southern Code. . . . Besides, the people who
preach non-violence as a theory of love aren't the
people who are down there." he commented.
TIIE .MISSISSIPPI MOVEMENT, as Moses in
vasions it. is not an effort to "integrate." "What
needs to happen is not to have bridges between the
white and Negro, but for the white to be free with
in his own community to discuss issues and find
some answers for himself. ..."
When Moses came to Mississippi in H<Gl he
went to McComb, one of the toughest areas in the
state. "The logical place to begin was any place."
he explained. "I went down to see what could Ix*
done. And the first thing that I learned was what
couldn't be done, and that helped to define what
could. What 1 learned was all that's involved in
setting up a society for people to run ihcir own
lives' . . People have to run their own lives."
"Tension is building up in McComb again. You
can foci it," Dennis Sweeney lold an audience of
500 at the West Coast Conference of the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Committee <SNCCi in
San Francisco this weekend.
