## FSM Disavows Faculty Proposal 
### 
The Free Speech Movement
(FSM) Saturday rejected a key
section of the compromise ten
point program submitted to the
administration of Cal-Berkeley
by a six-man faculty committee.
The controversial part of the
faculty proposals had recommend
ed that students judicially found
guilty of violating California or
federal laws off campus would
be subject to university discipline,
if the illegal acts wore planned
on campus.
IN CONTRAST, the FSM of
fered an eleven-point program of
their own with the key proposal
declaring that "the Administra
tion may not regulate the con
tent of speech and political con
duct and must leave solely to ap
propriate civil authorities the
right of punishment for trans
gressions of the law."
The FSM promised to publish
a "detailed comparison" of the
two proposals before the faculty
report is presented at the Friday
meeting of the Regents by Presi
dent Clark Kerr.
ALSO. OVER the weekend, the
Heyman Committee finished its
hearings on the suspension of
eight students last month for
their participation in the student
demonstrations of Sept. 30-octo
ber 2.
The Committee recommended
re-instatement for all eight. Six
were to be censured, the other
two — Mario Savio and Arthur
Goldberg, members of the FSM
Steering Committee — were giv
en a six weeks retroactive sus
pension beginning Sept. 30 and
ending today.
