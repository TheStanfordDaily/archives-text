President Clark Kerr.
University of California:
We, the undersigned mem
bers of the Stanford U.
community, support the stu
dents of the Univ. of Cal in
their demands to allow stu
dent political groups the
right to use designated cam
pus areas to solicit funds
and membership and to ad
vocate political demonstra
tions or other action.
We support their further
condition that the Univer
sity may nol regulate eon
tent of free speech and po
litical conduct and must
leave solely to the appro
priate civil authorities the
punishment for any trans
gressions of law off-campus.
We feel the University in
not guaranteeing these free
doms is violating the pur
pose of tho University com
munity as a place of learn
ing and investigation of
ideas and that political free
doms guaranteed to a stu
dent as a citizen off the 1
campus should be equally
protected on the campus.
We urge that you do all
in your power to reach an
agreement imp 1 e menting
these principles.
