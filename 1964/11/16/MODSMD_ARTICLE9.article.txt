## 
### 
Dr. Benard B. Fall, professor of international relations at Howard
University and an expert on the politics of \ iet Nam, kevnoted
Stanford's Foreign Policy Institute Saturday by debunking the
mvths which, he says, have permeated our thinking on Southeast

Asia.
"The new myth would have us
believe that what we face in Viet
Nam is merely a terror campaign
conducted by guerrilla fighters."
explained Dr. Fall. "This is non
sense. You don't attack a major
j air base with terrorists."
THIO PROFESSOR stated that
we are now facing "revolutionary
warfare" and not 'guerrilla war."
"Subversion cannot now be
curtailed by military means"
Fall insisted. A rapport must be
! established between the govern-
I ment and I he people and the
i people must be given a chance
i to express themselves.
Professor David Wilson of
' UCLA, in an Institute speech Fri-
I day evening, explained that "al
most all the territory of South
east Asia has been part of the
; European imp e rial system.
Though Europe brought an order
liness to Asia, the Administrative
j system imposed on ihe Asian
| countries was "coming apart at
the seams" in the late 1930'5."
"Till; AKFA has fallen be
: tween two stools." he explained.
; "Imperialism pushed it off one
land if has never made it over to
, the other."
Dr. Joel Halpern of Brandcis
j Universtity opened the Institute
; Friday afternoon by discussing
j the role of social customs and
religion in regard to our prob
lems in Southeast Asia.
