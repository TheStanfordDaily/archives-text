YOUR STANDING BEFORE GOD
Standing at the end of every human life is a holy and
righteous God who "judges the secrets of men by Jesus Christ"
(Romans 2:16). The Holy One of Israel waits to ask each one of
us what we have done about His Son, the Lord Jesus who died
that we might have forgiveness of sin and eternal life.
"For God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the
world, but that the world through Him might be saved. He
who believes on Him (Christ) is not condemned; he who does
not believe in Him is condemned already, because he has not
believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this
is the judgment, the condemnation, that light is come into the
world, and men loved darkness rather than light because their
deeds were evil. For everyone who does evil hates the light, and
does not come to the light lest his deeds should be exposed.
But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be
clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God (John
3:17-21).
It is not that God stands ready to condemn, but that men
are condemned already! It is in fact true that men prefer dark
ness to the saving light. "Theie is none who seeks God Ro
mans 3:10 tells us!
The unique claim of Christianity above and beyond any
and all claims made by other religions is that Jesus Christ (God
Himself) entered this world from another realm to save men
from themselves. Unless you have met Jesus Christ on a per
sonal basis you can't realize the incredible blindness and de
ception which exists in man's hearts and minds. But you can
know Jesus and you can join in prayer with those who do,
praying as Paul did two thousand years ago:
"... we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you
may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual
wisdom and understanding, to lead a life worthy of the Lord,
fully pleasing lo Him, bearing fiuil in eveiy good woik and
increasing in the knowledge of Him. May you be strengthened
with all power, according to His glorious might, for all endur
ance and patience with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who
has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in
light. He has delivered us from the dominion of darkness and
transferred us to the kindom of His Beloved Son, in whom we
have redemption, the fotgiveness of sins (Colossiuns I 9-14).
