# Militants Dominate Cal's Free Speech Movement
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Editor 
The Cal campus continues to boil
with controversy this week with a
massive rally, picketing, and vigil
slated Friday to coincide with a meet
ing of the Regents.
Behind all the furor is the remark
able organization called the Free
Speech Movement (FSM), headed by
junior philosophy major Mario Savio,
who spoke here yesterday.
OPERATING from Savio's modest
apartment just off the Berkeley cam
pus, FSM in the past month has con
fronted the administration of the Uni
versity of California with a major dis
ciplinary crisis, a crisis raised by
FSM's clamoring for complete on-cam
pus political freedom.
The nature of FSM, its tactics and
supporters, are likely to determine its
success during the next few weeks in
winning its demands.

A common misconception arising
out of the press's superficial coverage
of FSM is that it is a left-wing organi
zation composed purely of militant
pacifists, civil rights workers, etc.
TO BEGIN W ITH FSM represents
more than one political view. Organ
ized shortly after the October incident
in which a police car was surrounded
by students for over 30 hours, FSM's
Executive Committee is composed of
groups representing all shades of poli
tical opinion, from the Young Republi
cans and the University Society of In
dividualists, to the various leftist and
pacifist organizations, such as the Du-
Bois clubs and the Young People's
Socialist League.
Thus, while there is danger of
charges that FSM is a Communist
leaning group (Bettina Aptheker,
daughter of a member of the National
Committee of the Communist Party
and former leader of a New York
Communist youth group, is one of
FSM's 12 steering committee mem

bers), some conservative organiza
tions also participate.
BUT EVEN EESS recognized than
the inclusion of differing groups in
the FSM is the internal dissension
over how the common cause should
be promoted.
Within the Executive Committee,
there has never been full agreement
over tactics and the degree of mili
tancy to be used in pressing toward
the goal of unhampered political ac
tivity on the UC campus.
The division over tactics was
caused primarily by the concern of
some of the members that over-mili
tancy will reduce the chances of a
reasonable solution to the problems.
THERE HAS BEEN open opposi
tion by the Young Republicans and
others with regard to resumption of
demonstrations, with the more mod
erate groups opposing civil disobedi
ence and fearing that further violence
would hamper the cause.
Some students feel that the leaders

of FSM, concentrated in the Steering
Committee, were "more interested in
perpetuating the organization, rather
than furthering free speech," and that
the constantly-voiced misgivings of
the moderates are being ignored.
Reacting to criticism that the or
ganization was controlled by a clique
and run undemocratically, Mario Sa
vio Sunday expanded the Steering
Committe to include three new mem
bers, one of which represented the
moderate forces.
IN GENERAL, however, as was ap
parent in Savio's presentation yester
day, FSM will probably continue to
be quite militant.
Strange as it may seem, the most
militant factions, which have a 2-1
edge on the Steering Committee, are
not the extreme leftists, what UC
President Clark Kerr called the fol
lowers "of the Castro-Mao line." (As
one of the conservative members of
the Executive Committee put it,"It
is quite an experience working with

a group in which the Communists are
moderates.")
The militancy stems rather from
FSM's deep roots in the activist civil
rights movement at Cal. The organi
zation's dominant leadership has been
directly involved in Bay Area picket
ing and sit-in demonstrations.
TIiESE LEADERS are deeply con
cerned about the affects on the civil
rights movement of the third point of
the ten-point proposal that the Com
mittee on Campus Political Activity
brought forward last Friday.
The effect of the proposal would be
to give the University disciplinary au
thority over students whose political
speeches on campus were linked with
ilegal actions off campus.
Savio and other FSM leaders are
quite frank in admitting that these
regulations could have the effect of
lessening student support for "test
ing" laws which they feel to be im
moral. They do not hesitate to link
Bav Area business interests with the

proposal.
THOtJ(*H THE rest of the Commit
tee's report liberalizes rules regarding
soliciting members, collecting funds,
and "mounting" political and social
action from campus, the FSM loader
ship, rejected the recommendations,
at least publicly.
As Savio puts it. although "we will
have won a good deal if the the Com
mittee report is adopted by the He
gents, we will not have won the prin
ciple, and we mean not to stop with
out the principle."
The events coming up this week,
particularly the demonstrations sched
uled Friday, may bring the internal
rift of FSM well into the open, when
moderate fears of the possible tor
pedoing of an acceptable compromise
will reach their peak.
Even now. many of the members of
the Eexecutive Committee are pri
vately saying that the cause of free
speech at Berkeley should not be
linked exclusively with the FSM.
