## 
### ROBERT THIERIOT 
Stanford's Cross Country squad
successfully continued the de
fense of the AAWU title won
last year by defeating UCLA and
USC in a triangular meet held
in Los Angeles, on November 14.
UCLA was very obviously key
ing for this meet as the highlight
of their schedule. It appears that
they rested some of their top run
ners in their previous meet, just

j for Sat urday's competition
t against Stanford.
ALTHOUGH Uclan John Weeks
established a new mark of 20:27
for the 4.3 mile course, the Stan
ford harriers were able to capture
three of the subsequent four
notches. Weym Kirkland this
lime led his warriors home in
20:34, which also is below the old
record time.
Stanford was not able to stay
in the famed "pack," but no op
position was able to fill ihe gaps
successfully.

course, 20:40, to grab off third,
