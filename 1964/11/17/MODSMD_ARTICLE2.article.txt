# Speakers Dedicate New Lab
## Open House At Stauffer Center 
### 
The itow, million-dollar John
Stauffer Laboratory for Physical
Chemistry w ill be dedicated at
Stanford I'nivcrsity this morn
ing in special ceremonies led by
President Wallace Sterling.
John Stauffer of Los Angeles,
senior director of the Stauffer
Chemical Company and son of
the firm's founder, will he among
the dedication speakers. His gift,
together with another from his
firm and a grant from the Na
tional Science Foundation, pro
vided the funds for the building.
AN OPKX lionsi: beginning
at 10:30 a.m. will be held in the
new laboratory, when its equip
ment and research will be ex
plained by faculty and students.
The dedication ceremony will take
place at 11:30 a.m.
The new laboratory contains
16,000 net square feet on two
floors and a basement. A modular
design allows great flexibility in
use of the space. Utilities, includ
ing nitrogen and other gases ordi
narily piped into chemistry la
boratories, are located overhead
for easy re-routing.
The new physical chemist ry fa
cility is elegantly equipped with
the latest N-M-R (nuclear mag
netic resonance) and E-P->R( elec
tron paramagnetic resonance) in
struments for analyzing sub
stances without breaking them
down in the process.
