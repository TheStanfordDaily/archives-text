# Big Game Fever
## 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
Big (iame lever is about to hit
the Stanford campus, and the
germ that causes the disease is
a healthy tradition extending
back to 1892. In the next few
days the entire student body will
contact symptoms and the results
will be a lot of color, excitement,
and merry-making.
Cal Coach Ray Willsey, in his
first year at Cal, and Stanford's
John Ralston in a sense started
the Big Game whirlwind with
their comments at the weekly
sportswritors' luncheon held yes
terday at the Berkeley House.
"TWO AND ONE-HALF hours
after the game Saturday we went
right to work on Cal, which after
all is the important thing right
now. This will be the key ball
game; any games in the past this
season we quickly forget about."
Ralston then went on to add that
Cal should be favored. This
brought muffled laughter from
the group of men who are sup
posed to know such things.
Ray Willsey then stepped to the
podium and talked about Cal's
sad. Saturday effort. He gave no
alibis for the Golden Bear's re
trograde motion in the latter half
of the season and even said none
were possible. "The Utah game
was without a doubt our poorest

game of the season and 1 don't
know why it happened."
He then turned his thought to
Big Game. "I don't need to tell
you how 1 feel or tell you about
the atmosphere." It is difficult to
predict a winner or a favorite. The
concept of favorite or underdog
you must throw out the window.
"THi: BIG GAME is the Big
Game and it will be a real inter
esting affair this year as it, has
always been in the past."
It was the last pre-game speech
the two coaches would make this
year. They praised their own
squads and with even more super
latives praised the opposition. But
this is the way of all coaches.
Neither said that he thought his
team would win it. Inward conceit
works for you but outward con
ceit plays into the enemy's hands.
