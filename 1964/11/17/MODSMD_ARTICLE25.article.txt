# Editor, The Daily
## Extremists Should Be Heard 
### 
Dear Sir:
I find the sentiments expressed
in Friday's editorial far more dis
turbing than Mr. Rockwell's past
presence on campus.
It is as if the extremist can have
nothing significant to say, or that
the consensus in the middle holds
a natural monopoly on truth.
We should not need reminding
that the major contributors to
human thought and welfare have
been extremists par excellence.
While I will not compare Rock
well with Socrates or Jesus
Christ, let me be the first to advo
cate his right to speak here. If
his appearance "was valuable only
in that it promoted active discus
sion," (sic) then no other justifi
cation is necessary. If he threat
ened the public order, then the
public order can profit from the
threat by being forced to estab
lish a rational justification for
its position or else it speaks
poorly for that order.
What is more, I think visits by
holders of minority opinions are
precisely those which should be
encouraged and solicited at a

1 university. Freedom of speech is
a hollow, meaningless right if •
one cannot speak here, here, orj
here. Simply because there exist j
few sponsoring organizations fori
those opinions at Stanford, it is
certainly proper that Political
Union take the incentive in bring
ing them to us.
The Editor goes on to suggest
we hear more of the "respectable
segment of the American political
spectrum." But in actuality, we
hear little else. Respectable opin
ion happens to coincide with ma
jority opinion, and with syndi
cated opinion, appearing locally.;
And the Editor proposes several:
respectable names for inclusion,
but Mark Lane and the head of i
j Moral Re-Armament are "eccen- j
! trie," "fringe viewpoints."
The arbitrariness of these cri-■
| teria might convince one of thej
I folly and danger of having them
; when the issue is one of promot
ing the free expression of all!
opinions. The basic and incon
travertihle point, I believe, is;
that those who damp ideas, di-1
reetly or indirectly, discount the
ability of man to use his most
precious gift his mind.

Dear Sir:
An enormous error was made
in Monday's Stanford Daily in a
front page article which said the
Young Democrats' resolution con
cerning the situation at the Uni
versity of California would "he
considered" by (lie Young Repub
licans as well as the Young Demo
crats at a meeting sponsored by
the YDs that afternoon. That
statement is wholly erroneous
and without substantiation in fact.
The Stanford Area YRs have
not authorized the use of t heir
name in any such connection,
especially considering the unsav
ory nature of some of the leaders
of the "Free Speech Movement"
at the University of California.
Another big mistake was made
in the "Once Around the Quad"
section on Monday which changed
an executive board meeting into
a general YR meeting, by omit
ting the words "executive board."
We would like to expect more
responsible journalism from the
Daily in the future.

ory nature of some of the leaders
of the "Free Speech Movement"

Another big mistake was made
in the "Once Around the Quad"
section on Monday which changed
an executive board meeting into
a general YR meeting, by omit

Dear Sir:
I find the sentiments expressed
in Friday's editorial far more dis
turbing than Mr. Rockwell's past
presence on campus.
It is as if the extremist can have
nothing significant to say, or that
the consensus in the middle holds
a natural monopoly on truth.
We should not need reminding
that the major contributors to
human thought and welfare have
been extremists par excellence.
While I will not compare Rock
well with Socrates or Jesus
Christ, let me be the first to advo
cate his right to speak here. If
his appearance "was valuable only
in that it promoted active discus
sion," (sic) then no other justifi
cation is necessary. If he threat
ened the public order, then the
public order can profit from the
threat by being forced to estab
lish a rational justification for
its position or else it speaks
poorly for that order.
What is more, I think visits by
holders of minority opinions are
precisely those which should be
encouraged and solicited at a

1 university. Freedom of speech is
a hollow, meaningless right if •
one cannot speak here, here, orj
here. Simply because there exist j
few sponsoring organizations fori
those opinions at Stanford, it is
certainly proper that Political
Union take the incentive in bring
ing them to us.
The Editor goes on to suggest
we hear more of the "respectable
segment of the American political
spectrum." But in actuality, we
hear little else. Respectable opin
ion happens to coincide with ma
jority opinion, and with syndi
cated opinion, appearing locally.;
And the Editor proposes several:
respectable names for inclusion,
but Mark Lane and the head of i
j Moral Re-Armament are "eccen- j
! trie," "fringe viewpoints."
The arbitrariness of these cri-■
| teria might convince one of thej
I folly and danger of having them
; when the issue is one of promot
ing the free expression of all!
opinions. The basic and incon
travertihle point, I believe, is;
that those who damp ideas, di-1
reetly or indirectly, discount the
ability of man to use his most
precious gift his mind.

Dear Sir:
An enormous error was made
in Monday's Stanford Daily in a
front page article which said the
Young Democrats' resolution con
cerning the situation at the Uni
versity of California would "he
considered" by (lie Young Repub
licans as well as the Young Demo
crats at a meeting sponsored by
the YDs that afternoon. That
statement is wholly erroneous
and without substantiation in fact.
The Stanford Area YRs have
not authorized the use of t heir
name in any such connection,
especially considering the unsav
ory nature of some of the leaders
of the "Free Speech Movement"
at the University of California.
Another big mistake was made
