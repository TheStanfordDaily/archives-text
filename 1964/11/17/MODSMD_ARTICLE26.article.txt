# Poli U Replies To The Daily
## 
### 
Dear Sir:
I would like to make the Political Union's posi
tion clear in regard to last Friday's editorial in
The Daily. The editorial had three major themes:
1 I the relationship between the safety of the com
munity and the rights of the individual, 2) whether
the Political Union ought to have presented George
Lincoln Rockwell, and 3i a criticism of the Politi
cal Union's programs this quarter as being too
concerned with fringe viewpoints.
Mr. Naylor dealt with the first issue at length,
finally coming to the conclusion that George Lin
coln Rockwell did not pose a threat to the Univer
sity. He decided, as the officers of the Political
Union did long ago, that Stanford students can
be "credited with enough intelligence and com
mon sense to take Rockwell's ideas for what they
are. ..." The officers of tho Political Union
heartily endorse Mr. Naylor's apparently tortured
decision.
In regard to the second issue, Mr. Naylor had
the following to say: "Rockwell's visit, if it had
any merit at all, was valuable only in that it pro
moted active discussion." I must disagree with
this statement. Rockwell's speech can be justified
on the basis of the discussion it has raised on this
campus, particularly in regard to freedom of
speech. But Rockwell is not just a controversial
speaker. He is also a living example of an his
torical phenomenon which held sway over mil
lions of people only twenty years ago. Professor
Ma/our says he can remember another man like
Rockwell and the tremendous influence that this
man, Hitler, was able to exert over a whole nation.
But until Rockwell came to this campus the only
knowledge most of us had of Hitler, his tech
niques, and his appeal was derived from history
books. While one does not have to murder to know
it is bad, one can learn by talking to a murderer.
The knowledge to be gained from the Rockwell
speech did not lie so much in the factual validity
of his statements as in the opportunity to observe
his techniques and to see at what level he made
his appeal.
In a sense, what I am saying is that Mr. Nay
lor's statement that people attended the Rockwell
speech out of curiosity is correct. But I believe
that curiosity is a prime source of knowledge,
not to be condemned but to be encouraged.

Mr. Naylor and I are also in disagreement about
the third point of his editorial. In the first place,
Mr. Naylor neglected to point out that the Politi
cal Union supplied the honorarium for Galbraith,
who spoke to a full house at Memorial Auditorium,
and presented the Northern California coordinator
of the "Yes on Proposition 11" campaign. Al
though many of us disagree with this individual's
opinions, the results of the recent election indi
cate that he is not on the American fringe. May I
also point out that if the Rockwell, Walker, and
Schwarz programs were big, it was because many
students attended them, not because the Political
Union made a special effort to promote them. In
fact it was the Daily which gave George Lincoln
Rockwell a headline on the front page and an
election evaluation program including Professors
Pease, Tarshis, and Prewitt a small article in the
lower right hand corner of the page.
The Political Union is always attempting to
bring speakers of the highest caliber. I have a list
of fifty people with whom the Political Union is
corresponding, including many of those suggested
by Mr. Naylor in his editorial. It is not, however,
easy to bring out people of the quality of Wayne
Morse, Arthur Schlessinger, or Walter Lippmann
even if they want to come.
Wayne Morse, for example, wanted to speak
on campus this month. He also wants, however,
a $700 honorarium, transportation to and from
Washington, D.C., and "incidental" expenses. Since
the Political Union is given a budget of only $2460,
expensive speakers arc extremely difficult to get
on campus, even when they are already on the
West Coast. We, of course, do all we can to bar
gain with these speakers and sometimes succeed.
For example, Mr. Howard, a speaker in much
demand, has generously consented to address the
Stanford student body at a sizable reduction in
his normal honorarium. Often speakers of such
renown cannot he expected to accept such an offer.
In closing, 1 would like to pose a question
which 1 think is relevant to this whole discussion.
If we cannot hear minority viewpoints while we
are attending a university theoretically motivated
by a search for the truth, where will we be able
to hear them?
