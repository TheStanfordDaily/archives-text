# Today and Tomorrow
## American Dream: Society Of Harmonized Interests 
### Walter Lippmann 
As the election campaign recedes into tlie distance, we can
begin to sec more clearly what it was about. In the midst of the
baw ling and braw ling it seemed to many to be mere din and blur,
oliering only a shallow and a sterile choice. Hut in retrospect, in
the clearer view of hindsight, it is becoming evident that the choice

was profound, and that it was
pregnant with the central affirma
tion of the American way of life.
The choice was between the
polities of extremism and the poli
ties of consensus, and in the dif
ference between them there was
at stake the identity of this coun
try.
(Outlict Irreconsilable
Extremism in any of its many
forms rests always on a belief
that some conflict within a so
ciety is irreconsilable. There is,
therefore, no solution of the con
flict except the destruction of one
or the other contending groups.
In the world of the extremists
there can be no solution of im
portant issues by conciliation and
consent. There must always be a
winner and a loser. The conflict
must always cud in unconditional
surrender. There is no such thing
as the harmonizing of interests.
Tlius, Marxism-Leninism is an
extremist doctrine which has at
its core the dogma that all the
evils of poverty and oppression
arise from an irreconsilable con
flict between the capitalist class
and the proletarian class. Fascism
and Nazism are extremist doc
trines which have at their core
the belief that all that is unde
sirable springs from irreconcil
able differences of ideology, re
ligion and race. The white su
premacists are an extremist sect
who contend that the survival of
the white race depends on its su
premacy over a subjugated Negro
race.
Appeals To Decent JVople
Extremist doctrines appeal not
only to pride and prejudice, to
hate and envy, but also in some
degree to the worldly wisdom of
quite civilized and decent people.
They find it hard to believe that
the persistent conflicts are not
insoluable.
In all societies and throughout
recorded history, there have been
persistent conflicts of class, re
ligion and race: is it not Utopian
and soft-headed to suppose that
in the real world such conflicts
can be composed? That is why the
extremists, who always know in
their hearts that they cannot be
wrong, have much more respect
for opposing extremists than for
the contemptible sentimental

visionaries in the mushy middle.
The American dream, the prom
ise of American life, has always
been tlie revolutionary and (it has
always been argued) the un
worldly conviction that within a
free society all interests can be
conciliated by persuasion and sat
! isfied by consent. Nobody can pre
! tend that the American nation has
| always followed this dream or
I that, even when il tried to follow
it.it has realized the dream. One
of the worst civil wars in history
was fought by Americans, and
in the 100 years since then t he
| cause which was victorious has
j not yet been fully achieved.
Mystic Chord of Memory
Nevertheless, the vision of a
j society in which all conflicts can
i be reconciled is deep in t lie souls
I of Americans. Here is the mystic
I chord of memory, of which Abra
ham Lincoln spoke. To it Ameri
; cans respond when they are jolted
! out of the routine and material
ism of their daily lives. In the re
cent election campaign, Senator
; Goldwater jolted the conscience
I of the great mass of Americans
: and President Johnson struck the
mystic chord of memory to which
they respond.
In the current political jargon,
the name for the old American
dream of harmony is the politics
of consensus. It has been a dra
matic coincidence that when the
polities of consensus was chal
lenged by an extremist, the de
fender happened to be a man who
is a conspicuously successful har
monizer of conflicting interests.
As a result, though it sounds
Utopian and unworldly to talk in
the abstract of harmonizing all
conflicting interests, in the per
son of Lyndon Johnson it does
not seem unreal and unworldly
at all because in fact it isn't. Lyn
don Johnson is very far from
being an unworldly man. Indeed,
the politics of consensus as prac
ticed by him includes the use of
quite worldly means to overcome
the conflict and push and pull the
contenders together.
Our people have, I think, under
stood this. They are not too fas
tidious to have been reassured
rather than put off by the spec
tacle of a worldly man pursuing
their ancient; dream.

the politics of consensus as prac

quite worldly means to overcome
the conflict and push and pull the
contenders together.
Our people have, I think, under
stood this. They are not too fas
tidious to have been reassured
rather than put off by the spec
tacle of a worldly man pursuing
their ancient; dream.
As the election campaign recedes into tlie distance, we can
begin to sec more clearly what it was about. In the midst of the
baw ling and braw ling it seemed to many to be mere din and blur,
oliering only a shallow and a sterile choice. Hut in retrospect, in
the clearer view of hindsight, it is becoming evident that the choice

was profound, and that it was
pregnant with the central affirma

The choice was between the

(Outlict Irreconsilable
Extremism in any of its many
forms rests always on a belief
that some conflict within a so
ciety is irreconsilable. There is,
therefore, no solution of the con
flict except the destruction of one
or the other contending groups.
In the world of the extremists
there can be no solution of im
portant issues by conciliation and
consent. There must always be a
winner and a loser. The conflict
must always cud in unconditional
surrender. There is no such thing
as the harmonizing of interests.
Tlius, Marxism-Leninism is an
extremist doctrine which has at
its core the dogma that all the
evils of poverty and oppression
arise from an irreconsilable con
flict between the capitalist class
and the proletarian class. Fascism
and Nazism are extremist doc
trines which have at their core
the belief that all that is unde
sirable springs from irreconcil
able differences of ideology, re
ligion and race. The white su
premacists are an extremist sect
who contend that the survival of
the white race depends on its su
premacy over a subjugated Negro
race.
Appeals To Decent JVople
Extremist doctrines appeal not
only to pride and prejudice, to
hate and envy, but also in some
degree to the worldly wisdom of
quite civilized and decent people.
They find it hard to believe that
the persistent conflicts are not
insoluable.
In all societies and throughout
recorded history, there have been
persistent conflicts of class, re
ligion and race: is it not Utopian
and soft-headed to suppose that
in the real world such conflicts
can be composed? That is why the
extremists, who always know in
their hearts that they cannot be
wrong, have much more respect
for opposing extremists than for
the contemptible sentimental

visionaries in the mushy middle.
The American dream, the prom
ise of American life, has always
been tlie revolutionary and (it has
always been argued) the un
worldly conviction that within a
free society all interests can be
conciliated by persuasion and sat
! isfied by consent. Nobody can pre
! tend that the American nation has
| always followed this dream or
I that, even when il tried to follow
it.it has realized the dream. One
of the worst civil wars in history
was fought by Americans, and
in the 100 years since then t he
| cause which was victorious has
j not yet been fully achieved.
Mystic Chord of Memory
Nevertheless, the vision of a
j society in which all conflicts can
i be reconciled is deep in t lie souls
I of Americans. Here is the mystic
I chord of memory, of which Abra
ham Lincoln spoke. To it Ameri
; cans respond when they are jolted
! out of the routine and material
ism of their daily lives. In the re
cent election campaign, Senator
; Goldwater jolted the conscience
I of the great mass of Americans
: and President Johnson struck the
mystic chord of memory to which
they respond.
In the current political jargon,
the name for the old American
dream of harmony is the politics
of consensus. It has been a dra
matic coincidence that when the
polities of consensus was chal
lenged by an extremist, the de
fender happened to be a man who
is a conspicuously successful har
monizer of conflicting interests.
As a result, though it sounds
Utopian and unworldly to talk in
the abstract of harmonizing all
conflicting interests, in the per
son of Lyndon Johnson it does
not seem unreal and unworldly
at all because in fact it isn't. Lyn

As a result, though it sounds
Utopian and unworldly to talk in
the abstract of harmonizing all
conflicting interests, in the per
son of Lyndon Johnson it does
not seem unreal and unworldly
at all because in fact it isn't. Lyn
don Johnson is very far from
being an unworldly man. Indeed,
the politics of consensus as prac
ticed by him includes the use of
quite worldly means to overcome
the conflict and push and pull the
contenders together.
Our people have, I think, under
stood this. They are not too fas
tidious to have been reassured
rather than put off by the spec
tacle of a worldly man pursuing
their ancient; dream.
As the election campaign recedes into tlie distance, we can
begin to sec more clearly what it was about. In the midst of the
baw ling and braw ling it seemed to many to be mere din and blur,
oliering only a shallow and a sterile choice. Hut in retrospect, in
the clearer view of hindsight, it is becoming evident that the choice

was profound, and that it was
pregnant with the central affirma
tion of the American way of life.
The choice was between the
polities of extremism and the poli
ties of consensus, and in the dif
ference between them there was
at stake the identity of this coun
try.
(Outlict Irreconsilable
Extremism in any of its many
forms rests always on a belief
that some conflict within a so
ciety is irreconsilable. There is,
therefore, no solution of the con
flict except the destruction of one
or the other contending groups.
In the world of the extremists
there can be no solution of im
portant issues by conciliation and
consent. There must always be a
winner and a loser. The conflict
must always cud in unconditional
surrender. There is no such thing
as the harmonizing of interests.
Tlius, Marxism-Leninism is an
extremist doctrine which has at
its core the dogma that all the
evils of poverty and oppression
arise from an irreconsilable con
flict between the capitalist class
and the proletarian class. Fascism
and Nazism are extremist doc
trines which have at their core
the belief that all that is unde
sirable springs from irreconcil
able differences of ideology, re
ligion and race. The white su
premacists are an extremist sect
who contend that the survival of
the white race depends on its su
premacy over a subjugated Negro
race.
Appeals To Decent JVople
Extremist doctrines appeal not
only to pride and prejudice, to
hate and envy, but also in some
degree to the worldly wisdom of
quite civilized and decent people.
They find it hard to believe that
the persistent conflicts are not
insoluable.
In all societies and throughout
recorded history, there have been
persistent conflicts of class, re
ligion and race: is it not Utopian
and soft-headed to suppose that
in the real world such conflicts
can be composed? That is why the
extremists, who always know in
their hearts that they cannot be
wrong, have much more respect
for opposing extremists than for
the contemptible sentimental

visionaries in the mushy middle.
The American dream, the prom
ise of American life, has always
been tlie revolutionary and (it has
always been argued) the un
worldly conviction that within a
free society all interests can be
conciliated by persuasion and sat
! isfied by consent. Nobody can pre
! tend that the American nation has
| always followed this dream or
I that, even when il tried to follow
it.it has realized the dream. One
of the worst civil wars in history
was fought by Americans, and
in the 100 years since then t he
| cause which was victorious has
j not yet been fully achieved.
Mystic Chord of Memory
Nevertheless, the vision of a
j society in which all conflicts can
i be reconciled is deep in t lie souls
I of Americans. Here is the mystic
I chord of memory, of which Abra
ham Lincoln spoke. To it Ameri
; cans respond when they are jolted
! out of the routine and material
ism of their daily lives. In the re
cent election campaign, Senator
; Goldwater jolted the conscience
I of the great mass of Americans
: and President Johnson struck the
mystic chord of memory to which
they respond.
In the current political jargon,
the name for the old American
dream of harmony is the politics
of consensus. It has been a dra
matic coincidence that when the
polities of consensus was chal
lenged by an extremist, the de
fender happened to be a man who
is a conspicuously successful har
monizer of conflicting interests.
As a result, though it sounds
Utopian and unworldly to talk in
the abstract of harmonizing all
conflicting interests, in the per
son of Lyndon Johnson it does
not seem unreal and unworldly
at all because in fact it isn't. Lyn
don Johnson is very far from
being an unworldly man. Indeed,
the politics of consensus as prac
ticed by him includes the use of
quite worldly means to overcome
the conflict and push and pull the
contenders together.
Our people have, I think, under
stood this. They are not too fas
tidious to have been reassured
rather than put off by the spec
tacle of a worldly man pursuing
their ancient; dream.
