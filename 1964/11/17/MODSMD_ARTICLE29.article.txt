# ATLANTIC UNION
## World Political, Economic Problems Can Be Solved 
### DOUGLASS MORRIS (Third in a Series) 
T he need for Atlantic I nion becomes clear w hen one consid
ers the present international economic and political situation. At
lantic Union provides the best solution to the most outstanding
problems.
The full benefit of an Atlantic free trade area cannot be

realized without Atlantic Union.
Without a common currency, the
complexities of currency ex
change would hamper trade.
Without a permanent commit
ment on the part of the partici
pants, such as the establishment
of a Constitution to be carried
out by a federal government, lack
of confidence would hamper
trade.
Businessmen would fear that
new markets or sources of sup
ply they would develop and per
haps come to depend on could be
cut off from them by a change
in policy on the part of a mem
ber government. A common cur
rency could not command confi
dence if it was subject to the
vagaries of diplomatic maneuver
! ing.
The Weak Dollar
Besides freeing trade, Atlantic
Union would eliminate a serious
danger of which people are gen
erally unaware that the state
of the U.S. dollar could cause
panic and a run which would ruin
the dollar, at least internation
ally, and as a consequence destroy
! the main support of many other
currencies and of the interna
; tional payments system.
The value of the dollar in in
{ternational exchange is based on
: tlie ability of foreign countries
: to redeem iheir dollar holding in
j U.S. gold. Twelve billion dollars
| of the U.S. gold stock are by law
set aside lo back dollars circulat
ing domestically.
I Calculations based on figures
from Ihe September Federal Re
serve Bulletin show that at the
; end of March the amount remain
i ing to cover foreign exchange
j was less than 84 per cent of the
j dollar holdings in France a n d
| West Germany, less than 80 per
; cent of the dollar holdings in Can
| ada and Great Britain, and less
i than 32 per cent of the dollar
; holdings in these four countries
j together with Switzerland, Italy,
! Belgium, and the Netherlands.
Reliance on Dollar
| The present European practice
j of basing national currencies in
; part on the U.S. dollar rather than
J entirely on gold worsens the sit
uation. It increases the damage
i that a run on the dollar could do
; while at the same time increas
; ing the chance that such a run
; will occur.
European economists consider
this practice inflationary, with
good reason, considering the small
percentage of dollar face value
j represented by actual U.S. gold
| reserves. Inflation is presently a
particularly serious problem in
Europe.
Thus European governments
; must face a great temptation to
seek stabler currencies by convert
ing much of their dollar holdings
into gold. Such action could eas
ily precipitate a panic.
Atlantic Union would end the
danger. The Union currency
would be backed by the pooled
gold reserves of the nations join
ing, and most of the claims
against this pooled reserve would
: be held within the Union.
Nuclear Weapons
j Present problems within the
! Western Alliance concerning the
sharing and proliferation of nu
[ clear weapons would be greatly
j alleviated by Atlantic Union, with

each side in t lie dispute achieving
its aims.
Since these weapons, along with
the rest of the defense establish
ment, would belong to the entire
Union, it would be clear that they
would protect Europeans just as
much as Americans.
Since there would be a single
Atlantic nuclear force rather
than separate national ones,
Americans could be sure that no
war would be started without
their having a part in the deci
sion. Also, the process of nuclear
proliferation would be partially
reversed.
All this would improve the
chances of reaching disarmament
agreements with Communists
i which would not compromise the
| interests of the free world.
Effect on Communists
The nations joining an Atlantic-
Union would be safe from the
Communists' strategy of piece
meal conquest, and from the dan
j ger of an economic collapse which
j would make them easy pickings
i for the Communists. At the same
time Atlantic Union would greatly
| increase the support available
throughout the world to those
; forces opposing Communist irn
! perialism.
Confronting the Communists
'with this situation would contri
bute much toward inducing them
I to end their program of expan
! sion, a step which is necessary
before there can be genuine world
! peace.
In addition Atlantic Union
(would hold a tremendous attrac
tion for the Communist subjects
jin Eastern Europe. In the long
; run this would force the Commit-
I nists to choose between liberaliz
ing their empire and giving inde
! pendence to at least part of it.
A similar attraction would af
j feet such non-Communist dicta
: torships as Spain and Portugal.
; In many such cases economic and
military ties between the particu
i lar country and the Union would
accelerate the effect.
Other Reactions
The uncommitted nations would
1 probably be suspicious of At
lantic Union at first. It would be
I up to the Union to avoid policies
j that would make them hostile to
ward it.
Their reaction would become
more favorable as they found that
the Union improved prospects for
peace and that its increased pros
perity provided a better market
for their products and a better
shopping place for their needs.
Such traditional neutrals as
Switzerland and Sweden might
well decide to join the Atlantic
I Union, which would be very dif
ferent from an alliance. If not,
their policy toward the Union
would undoubtedly be much the
same as their present policies to
ward the nations which would be
its states, including a willingness
to participate in free trade agree
ments.
Would any nation be offended
at not being included among the
founders of the Union? Probably
| not international organizations
j such as NATO have been formed
i in the past without offending non
! members, and the Union would
| be ready to admit more members
i after its founding.

j would make them easy pickings

the Union improved prospects for
peace and that its increased pros

for their products and a better

Such traditional neutrals as
Switzerland and Sweden might
well decide to join the Atlantic

their policy toward the Union
would undoubtedly be much the

T he need for Atlantic I nion becomes clear w hen one consid

problems.
The full benefit of an Atlantic free trade area cannot be

realized without Atlantic Union.
Without a common currency, the
complexities of currency ex

Without a permanent commit

agreements with Communists
i which would not compromise the
| interests of the free world.
Effect on Communists
The nations joining an Atlantic-
Union would be safe from the
Communists' strategy of piece
meal conquest, and from the dan
j ger of an economic collapse which
j would make them easy pickings
i for the Communists. At the same
time Atlantic Union would greatly
| increase the support available
throughout the world to those
; forces opposing Communist irn
! perialism.
Confronting the Communists
'with this situation would contri
bute much toward inducing them
I to end their program of expan
! sion, a step which is necessary
before there can be genuine world
! peace.
In addition Atlantic Union
(would hold a tremendous attrac
tion for the Communist subjects
jin Eastern Europe. In the long
; run this would force the Commit-
I nists to choose between liberaliz
ing their empire and giving inde
! pendence to at least part of it.
A similar attraction would af
j feet such non-Communist dicta
: torships as Spain and Portugal.
; In many such cases economic and
military ties between the particu
i lar country and the Union would
accelerate the effect.
Other Reactions
The uncommitted nations would
1 probably be suspicious of At
lantic Union at first. It would be
I up to the Union to avoid policies
j that would make them hostile to
ward it.
Their reaction would become
more favorable as they found that
the Union improved prospects for
peace and that its increased pros
perity provided a better market
for their products and a better
shopping place for their needs.
Such traditional neutrals as
Switzerland and Sweden might
well decide to join the Atlantic
I Union, which would be very dif
ferent from an alliance. If not,
their policy toward the Union
would undoubtedly be much the
same as their present policies to
ward the nations which would be
its states, including a willingness
to participate in free trade agree
ments.
Would any nation be offended
at not being included among the
founders of the Union? Probably
| not international organizations
j such as NATO have been formed
i in the past without offending non
! members, and the Union would
| be ready to admit more members
i after its founding.
T he need for Atlantic I nion becomes clear w hen one consid
ers the present international economic and political situation. At
lantic Union provides the best solution to the most outstanding
problems.
The full benefit of an Atlantic free trade area cannot be

realized without Atlantic Union.
Without a common currency, the
complexities of currency ex
change would hamper trade.
Without a permanent commit
ment on the part of the partici
pants, such as the establishment
of a Constitution to be carried
out by a federal government, lack
of confidence would hamper
trade.
Businessmen would fear that
new markets or sources of sup
ply they would develop and per
haps come to depend on could be
cut off from them by a change
in policy on the part of a mem
ber government. A common cur
rency could not command confi
dence if it was subject to the
vagaries of diplomatic maneuver
! ing.
The Weak Dollar
Besides freeing trade, Atlantic
Union would eliminate a serious
danger of which people are gen
erally unaware that the state
of the U.S. dollar could cause
panic and a run which would ruin
the dollar, at least internation
ally, and as a consequence destroy
! the main support of many other
currencies and of the interna
; tional payments system.
The value of the dollar in in
{ternational exchange is based on
: tlie ability of foreign countries
: to redeem iheir dollar holding in
j U.S. gold. Twelve billion dollars
| of the U.S. gold stock are by law
set aside lo back dollars circulat
ing domestically.
I Calculations based on figures
from Ihe September Federal Re
serve Bulletin show that at the
; end of March the amount remain
i ing to cover foreign exchange
j was less than 84 per cent of the
j dollar holdings in France a n d
| West Germany, less than 80 per
; cent of the dollar holdings in Can
| ada and Great Britain, and less
i than 32 per cent of the dollar
; holdings in these four countries
j together with Switzerland, Italy,
! Belgium, and the Netherlands.
Reliance on Dollar
| The present European practice
j of basing national currencies in
; part on the U.S. dollar rather than
J entirely on gold worsens the sit
uation. It increases the damage
i that a run on the dollar could do
; while at the same time increas
; ing the chance that such a run
; will occur.
European economists consider
this practice inflationary, with
good reason, considering the small
percentage of dollar face value
j represented by actual U.S. gold
| reserves. Inflation is presently a
particularly serious problem in
Europe.
Thus European governments
; must face a great temptation to
seek stabler currencies by convert
ing much of their dollar holdings
into gold. Such action could eas
ily precipitate a panic.
Atlantic Union would end the
danger. The Union currency
would be backed by the pooled
gold reserves of the nations join
ing, and most of the claims
against this pooled reserve would
: be held within the Union.
Nuclear Weapons
j Present problems within the
! Western Alliance concerning the
sharing and proliferation of nu
[ clear weapons would be greatly
j alleviated by Atlantic Union, with

each side in t lie dispute achieving
its aims.
Since these weapons, along with
the rest of the defense establish
ment, would belong to the entire
Union, it would be clear that they
would protect Europeans just as
much as Americans.
Since there would be a single
Atlantic nuclear force rather
than separate national ones,
Americans could be sure that no
war would be started without
their having a part in the deci
sion. Also, the process of nuclear
proliferation would be partially
reversed.
All this would improve the
chances of reaching disarmament
