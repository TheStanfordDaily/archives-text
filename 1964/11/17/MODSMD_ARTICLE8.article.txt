# Legislature May Study Relationship With NSA
## Tor Information, Not Disaffiliation' 
### JIM HORNE Managing Editor 
The Legislature will consider
establishment of a Special Com
mittee to "investigate the rela
tionship of the \SSU to the U.S.
\ational Student Association ' at
its 7:30 meeting tonight.
A resolution establishing a five
man committee to study NSA
will he introduced by Michael
Couzens. a sophomore transfer
s t u d c n I representing Stanford
Village.
According to Couzens, "Both
Hie Legislature and the general
student body lack the information
to appreciate or appraise the ac
tivities of the local NSA chapter."
COUZENS EMPHASIZES that
this resolution is not an attempt
to disaffiliate with NSA. "We be
lieve," explains Couzens, "th a t
criticism of the organization is
either valid and should be publi
cized or is based upon misunder
standing of NSA itself."
"In either case, the situation
should be corrected," says Cou
zens.
He cites "disenchantment with
NSA on other campuses" along
with the "general ignorance of
the association on this campus"
as reasons for the study.
More than 323 college and uni
versities are members.
About $1,700 has been budgeted
for the Association in 1964-65,
with the bulk of this money ap
propriated for expenses for a doz
en students at the 18th Student
Congress next summer.
STANFORD WAS represented
at the first National Student Con
gress in 1047, but withdrew from
the Association in April, 1950, be
cause it was felt that most of
NSA's programs had been a n d
could be provided by other cam
pus organizations.
In 1953, Stanford rejoined NSA
on a provisional basis. Many stu
dents had difficulty justifying the
then $800 per year expense, while
I others questioned whether ihe
political stands taken by Ihe or
ganization were in accord with
the general feeling of Ihe student
body.
IN ANY CASK, Stanford con
tinued as a member until 19r>6
i when live per cent of the student
i body signed a petition requesting
disaffiliation. A student referen
i dum resulted in Stanford's second
withdrawal in six years.
IN 1960, LASSU itself opposed
j reaffiliation, but decided to sub
mit the issue to a campus vote.
The proposal was defeated by
! more than a two-to-onc margin.
Stanford's present affiliation
j resulted from a 1962 referendum

when students voted 799 to 614
H) rejoin the organization.
Till; STI'IIKNT Senate at ihe
University of California last
week voted to slop payment on
NSA dues for the coming year.
Carl Jacobs, NSA co-ordinator
at Berkeley, believes that "low
interest in NSA ihe past few
years" and a recent condemnation
of the student demonstrations for
free speech are the causes for
Ihe discontent.
Jacobs believes that a resolution
to disaffiliate with ihe organiza
tion is inevitable at the next meet
ing of the Senate.
A constitutional amendment
passed by two-thirds of the stu
dent body would be necessary to
withdraw from the Association.

tion is inevitable at the next meet
ing of the Senate.
A constitutional amendment
passed by two-thirds of the stu
dent body would be necessary to
withdraw from the Association.
The Legislature will consider
establishment of a Special Com
mittee to "investigate the rela
tionship of the \SSU to the U.S.
\ational Student Association ' at
its 7:30 meeting tonight.
A resolution establishing a five
man committee to study NSA
will he introduced by Michael
Couzens. a sophomore transfer
s t u d c n I representing Stanford
Village.
According to Couzens, "Both
Hie Legislature and the general
student body lack the information
to appreciate or appraise the ac
tivities of the local NSA chapter."
COUZENS EMPHASIZES that
this resolution is not an attempt
to disaffiliate with NSA. "We be
lieve," explains Couzens, "th a t
criticism of the organization is
either valid and should be publi
cized or is based upon misunder
standing of NSA itself."
"In either case, the situation
should be corrected," says Cou
zens.
He cites "disenchantment with
NSA on other campuses" along
with the "general ignorance of
the association on this campus"
as reasons for the study.
More than 323 college and uni
versities are members.
About $1,700 has been budgeted
for the Association in 1964-65,
with the bulk of this money ap
propriated for expenses for a doz
en students at the 18th Student
Congress next summer.
STANFORD WAS represented
at the first National Student Con
gress in 1047, but withdrew from
the Association in April, 1950, be
cause it was felt that most of
NSA's programs had been a n d
could be provided by other cam
pus organizations.
In 1953, Stanford rejoined NSA
on a provisional basis. Many stu
dents had difficulty justifying the
then $800 per year expense, while
I others questioned whether ihe
political stands taken by Ihe or
ganization were in accord with
the general feeling of Ihe student
body.
IN ANY CASK, Stanford con
tinued as a member until 19r>6
i when live per cent of the student
i body signed a petition requesting
disaffiliation. A student referen
i dum resulted in Stanford's second
withdrawal in six years.
IN 1960, LASSU itself opposed
j reaffiliation, but decided to sub
mit the issue to a campus vote.
The proposal was defeated by
! more than a two-to-onc margin.
Stanford's present affiliation
j resulted from a 1962 referendum

when students voted 799 to 614
H) rejoin the organization.
Till; STI'IIKNT Senate at ihe
University of California last
week voted to slop payment on
NSA dues for the coming year.
Carl Jacobs, NSA co-ordinator
at Berkeley, believes that "low
interest in NSA ihe past few
years" and a recent condemnation
of the student demonstrations for
free speech are the causes for
Ihe discontent.
