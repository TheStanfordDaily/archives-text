Why an Angry God?
Men looking for a way out have been quick to attempt to placate the anger
and wrath of God by their own theologies which ignore the righteous cinger
God holds against sin. Seizing upon the true attribute of the love of God,
popular cults and idolatries have ignoied the fact that God is determined to
utterly destroy sin and rebellion in His universe. Not only is God all-out against
sin, he holds all men accountable and responsible to Him for their rejection of
Himself:
' For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and
wickedness of men who by their wickedness suppress the truth. For what can
be known about God is plain to them. Ever since the creation of the world His
invisible nature, namely His eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived
in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse; for although
they knew God they did not honor Him as God or give thanks to Him, but they
became futile in their thinking and their senseless minds were darkened. Claim
ing to be wise they became fools . . ." (Romans 1:18-22)
Read the rest of Chapter One of Paul's letter to the Christians at Rome, or
better still, this entire great epistle which forms the bulwark of the Christian
faith. You'll find that men who reject the Light given to them, who turn from
the knowledge of God, fail deeply into error, blindness and depravity: "And
since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a base
mind and to improper conduct. They were filled wtih all manner of wickedness,
evil, covetousness, malice. Full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, malignity, they
are gossips, slanderers, haters oF God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of
evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Though they
know God s decree that those who do such things deserve to die, they not only
do them but approve those who practice them'' (Romans 1:28-32).
With sin and corruption eating away at the lives of men He created, is it
any wonder that a God of love should be angry and wrathful towards the
disease of sin and concerned with those, who deliberately ignoring the cure,
spread further the infectious virus which eats away at human life?
It is a marvel of God s mercy and love toward men that He should rescue
any from their selfish, life-destroying ways,- yet today with an infinite heart
of compassion, God does offer to all free reconciliation to Himself: ' While
we were yet helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. Why, one
will hardly die for a righteous man â€”though perhaps for a good man one will
dare to die. But God shows His love for us in that while we were yet sinners
Christ died for us. Since therefore we are justified by His blood, much more shall
we be saved by Him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies of
God we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more, now that
we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His Life. Not only so, but we also
rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now re
ceived our reconciliation'' (Romans 5:6-11).
Won't you, if you have not yet done so, accept God's great gift of recon
ciliation and eternal life? All of us have sinned (Romans 3:23), there is none
who deserves His mercy. Yet so freely is it now given that no man need be
excluded. Invite Jesus Christ to be Lord of your life today.
