Ray Handley and Dave Lewi;

This weekend brings the tradi
tional games to Pacific Coasi
teams, and all but one of then
will have a bearing on the Cham
pionship race.
The AAWU championship h
determined on a percentage bash
with a tie counting as half i
game won and half lost. Present
ly OSU, UCLA. USC, and Wash
ington are tied for first with i
.667 percentage.
WASHINGTON, with a sever
game conference schedule, is ir

a precarious position. Washing-j
ton can win only if USC and |
UCLA tie and Oregon either ties
or beats Oregon State. This
seems hardly likely.
Looking at tlie other three top |
teams, the Oregon OSU game;
should prove to be the deciding
factor. If Oregon State wins, then
the Beavers will tie the winner of
the USC-UCLA game. If, on the
other hand, Oregon is the victor,
the winner of the Trojan-Bruin
affair will be AAWU champs by
Ail the hustle-bustle for the con

ference Championship will go by
the boards when the Rose Howl
representedive is selected. The
A AYVU's Rose Bowl competitor
will be c hosen by ;t majority vote
ol' 11k 1 AAYVU Council, an organ
ization consisting of faculty rep
resentatives of the eight member
institutions.
Conference finish order will
not be the delermnning factor in
Rose Bowl selection. Instead, the
Council looks at recent showings
to decide which team would rep
resent the AAWU best.
