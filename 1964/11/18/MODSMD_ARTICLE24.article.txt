# The 						Free Speech Petition
## 
### 
Students are being asked to sign a petition
supporting the students of the University of Cali
fornia in their efforts to eliminate restrictions on
political activity.
Unfortunately there is good reason to he skep
tical about such a petition.
We endorse fully the idea that student orga
nizations should be free to solicit members, col
lect funds, and advocate political action, and we
sincerely hope that the Berkeley administration
will change the regulations to allow such activity.
We think also, that students in general should
be given the same freedom of speech and action
accorded to the rest of the citizenry: that stu
dents. in short, should be treated as adults.
But this petition, from the very beginning,
has been tied to the free Speech Movement at
Cal ami is likely to be interpreted as an endorse
ment of that group. This organization has never
had the sympathy of the mass of students at Cal.
FSM has been and will continue to be overly
militant in its tactics and more interested in
rabble rousing than coming by negotiation and
compromise to a rational and reasonable agree
ment with the Bcrkelev administration.

Within FSM there is a moderate element
which may, in spite of the organization's leader
ship and tactics, work out an acceptable agree
ment with the administration.
But if the direction in which FSM has been
heading is not changed, it will create only tur
moil, accomplishing nothing worthwhile and in
Fact hurting the cause of free political activity
at Cal. Indeed, we wonder if turmoil is not the
main objective of some of the Movement's
leaders.
It is true that the Stanford petition does not
mention the Free Speech Movement, but it can
not escape the connection. For it was produced
alter a speech by FSM s leader, Mario Savio, a
presentation at which, despite VI) efforts, no
representative of the Berkeley administration
was present.
Such a petition cannot in any way aid a final
agreement at Cal and will only encourage an
organization whose tactics may hurt its cause.
We do not disparage the motives of those
pushing the petition. On the contrary, in sum we
agree with them. But we must recommend that
Stanford students abstain from signing it.
