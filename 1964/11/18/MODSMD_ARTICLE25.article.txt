There are reasons far beyond the idealism of
students or even the particular good that they can
do in registering Negroes that justify Ihe Mis
sissippi Project as a constructive part of the civil
rights movement.
While the immediate concern of volunteers has
been to organize and register Negro communities
for the general election and the Freedom Vote,
Ihc long-range aim is to change the existing power
structure in Mississippi. This structure, which
places the wealthy Protestant white over the poor
white farmers, who are in turn granted power over
Negroes, is primarily an economic one. but racism
is its phychological and spiritual means.
Since the days of reconstruction, when the
Confederate South rebuilt around economic and
political restriction (as opposed to actual slavery)
of the Negro, the state of Mississippi has almost
singlemindedly devoted itself to the perpetuation
of this structure.
Even today, the murderers of three civil rights
workers can escape indictment; de la Beckwith
can be acquitted; confessed house and church
bombers can go free on suspended sentences; and
the state can pass a law against "social change."
For the Mississippian has been conditioned through
the past hundred years to believe that social
change, or any imbalance of the existing social
order, is his greatest enemy.
The white minority in power they control
the government, the laws, the press, business, and
the churches, —has as its greatest means for con
tinuing the status quo a full monopoly on infor
mation, or more basically, on knowledge.
In the rural, immobile, and poverty-ridden
communities of much of Mississippi, as well as
in other areas of the South, men are simply con
ditioned through the previous indoctrination of
their grandparents and parents, through the pres
sures of their employers (the owner of the cotton
gin. for instance; or in the case of tenant farmers,
the landowner), through stale government, and

through the local press — to believe that the white
boss is their friend and the black man is a hostile
animal. These ideas, of course, are the rich white's
means for staying in power and for exploiting the
poor whites; the Negro is merely a victim of the
means.
If Mississippi is really to change, these ideas
the foundation of the status quo — must be
changed. And it is here, regardless of his par
ticular idealism or even of how many Negroes
lie can "freedom-register" in an afternoon, that
the out-of-state volunteer, by his mere presence,
can have long-term effect.
The Negro may for the first time in his life
see a white man on his front porch, shake a white
hand, talk reasonably with a white man. For per
haps the first time, the white world — traditionally
and totally closed opens up. And hopefully, with
in time, communities will organize and take from
civil rights workers what they are really offering:
the initiative for social improvement. (Already
many high school and college students are join
ing the movement and beginning to assume lead
ership.)
Further, and absolutely necessary to social
change, the presence of the white college student
will affect, and is now affecting, the poor white.
The fact that there are now white men in the
slate who do not believe thai Negroes are inferior,
who are in fact living with Negroes in the same
houses and communities, is in direct contradic
tion with standard Mississippi thought and be
havior.
And the fact that these white people will not
despair and will not lie intimidated, that they in
tend to stay no matter what, is jarring to the white
Mississipian and particularly to the poor white
when he realizes that the out-of-stater's target is
his boss.
For the first time, he sees disagreement among
white people, and the question must arise, "Which
white man is right?"
11 is at 1 his point, by raising dissonance and
opening for the first time the possibility that the
status quo may be wrong in other words, by
offering the first semblance of a choice to the
Mississippian thai there is real hope for peace
ful revolution in Mississippi and for moderation
in the white communities of (he state.

There are reasons far beyond the idealism of
students or even the particular good that they can
do in registering Negroes that justify Ihe Mis
sissippi Project as a constructive part of the civil
rights movement.
While the immediate concern of volunteers has
been to organize and register Negro communities
for the general election and the Freedom Vote,
Ihc long-range aim is to change the existing power
structure in Mississippi. This structure, which
places the wealthy Protestant white over the poor
white farmers, who are in turn granted power over
Negroes, is primarily an economic one. but racism
is its phychological and spiritual means.
Since the days of reconstruction, when the
Confederate South rebuilt around economic and
political restriction (as opposed to actual slavery)
of the Negro, the state of Mississippi has almost
singlemindedly devoted itself to the perpetuation
of this structure.
Even today, the murderers of three civil rights
workers can escape indictment; de la Beckwith
can be acquitted; confessed house and church
bombers can go free on suspended sentences; and
the state can pass a law against "social change."
For the Mississippian has been conditioned through
the past hundred years to believe that social
change, or any imbalance of the existing social
order, is his greatest enemy.
The white minority in power they control
the government, the laws, the press, business, and
the churches, —has as its greatest means for con
tinuing the status quo a full monopoly on infor
mation, or more basically, on knowledge.
In the rural, immobile, and poverty-ridden
communities of much of Mississippi, as well as
in other areas of the South, men are simply con
ditioned through the previous indoctrination of
their grandparents and parents, through the pres
sures of their employers (the owner of the cotton
gin. for instance; or in the case of tenant farmers,
the landowner), through stale government, and

through the local press — to believe that the white
boss is their friend and the black man is a hostile
animal. These ideas, of course, are the rich white's
means for staying in power and for exploiting the
poor whites; the Negro is merely a victim of the
means.
If Mississippi is really to change, these ideas
the foundation of the status quo — must be
changed. And it is here, regardless of his par
ticular idealism or even of how many Negroes
lie can "freedom-register" in an afternoon, that
the out-of-state volunteer, by his mere presence,
