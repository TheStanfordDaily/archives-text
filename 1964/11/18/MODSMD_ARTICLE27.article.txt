## Social Regulations: Moral Dictatorship 
### 
| Dear Sir:
; Ideally, the following are axio
matic for anyone attending or ad
! ministering a residence-univer
sity: a) Dormitories exist for tho
I convenience of the student and
j for the advancement of an intel
lectual milieu, not for the conveni
ence of the Dean's Office in regu
lating the social conduct of stu
dents; b) Legal systems are for
the protection of personal a n d
'property rights, not for the impo
sition of arbitrary moralities.
Most of the social regulations
j at Stanford are dictated by stan
i dards of "morality" set by the
Dean's Office. Furthermore, these
standards seem to us to be either
i a) the promulgation of a moral
code peculiar to Dean Allen her
self, or b> the Dean's imaginative
assumption of herself in loco pa
rentis for 1718 undergraduate
women students.
We have at our side a copy of
"Social Regulations and Proce
dures" for this year. Let us quote:
"... in this country most resi
dential universities are expected
to t;iko some responsibility for the
conduct and well-being of their
women students." This is of
| course the Naturalistic Fallacy.
The rest of the pamphlet con
sists of a minute and falicious ap
plication of the Fundamental
Standard to the "social" (read in
"sexual") lives of Stanford Un
dergraduate women, hypocriti
cally based upon this intention,
among others: "to give a woman
as much freedom as practical so
that she can develop her good
judgment and social maturity."
| Some entertaining examples of
the description of "the minimal
! standards of conduct consistent
with the Fundamental Standard"
■ are: "During the second and third
I quarters a (freshman) woman
| has the privilege of distributing
1 her quota over the quarter";
i "There are to be no erasures on
| a sign-out card"; "Intelligent use
of the overnight leave requires
thoughtful planning on the part
of each woman"; "... Stanford
! students may take advantage of
j cultural activities which are lo
i fated in adjacent areas and cities
(not Sail Francisco) (boldface
I ours)."
In case a woman has violated
• her understanding of "what she
I may not do and what she may do,"
: she is privileged with "possible
disciplinary action" in which the
Dean's Office and its subsidiaries
exchange in loco parentis for in
loco Dei, conveniently extrapolat
ing fifteen late minutes into
| "gross negligence" or possibly "in
; tent to deceive and other moral de
linquencies.
After four years, we are finally
! furious, We are not attacking so
; much the Social Regulations pam
phlet as the hypocrisy it under
writes and the attempt at moral
[dictatorship, largely unsucessful,
for which it stands. The Univer

sity's sphere of influence has far
exceeded its academic preroga
tives; its attempt to educate wom
en students into "social maturity"
by simply removing occasion for
temptation is naive. We have ex
amined the functions and politices
of Stanford University with re
spect to ourselves and we find the
social directives superfluous and
irrelevant. Therefore we reject
them.

Dear Sir:
It is unfortunate that sending
food to the Mississippi Negroes
has been confused with the cur
rent Civil Rights effort.
As one who cannot sympathize
with the tactics used by the Stu
dent Non-violent Co-ordinating
Committee and its related organ
izations, as I feel they are both
harmful and wrong, I would like
to see this project organized in
dependently, without being asso
ciated with anything but what it
expressly intends to accomplish.
Rather than being motivated
by the self-satisfying anticipa
tion that giving to this project
will relieve a falsely inspired
sense of guilt, the project should
be motivated by the spirit of giv
ing — to help the Mississippi
Negroes through their winter
hardship as one man would like
to help another man who is in
need.
Sincerely,

| Dear Sir:
; Ideally, the following are axio
matic for anyone attending or ad

sity: a) Dormitories exist for tho
I convenience of the student and
j for the advancement of an intel
lectual milieu, not for the conveni
ence of the Dean's Office in regu
lating the social conduct of stu
dents; b) Legal systems are for
the protection of personal a n d
'property rights, not for the impo
sition of arbitrary moralities.
Most of the social regulations
j at Stanford are dictated by stan
i dards of "morality" set by the
Dean's Office. Furthermore, these
standards seem to us to be either
i a) the promulgation of a moral
code peculiar to Dean Allen her
self, or b> the Dean's imaginative
assumption of herself in loco pa
rentis for 1718 undergraduate
women students.
We have at our side a copy of
"Social Regulations and Proce
dures" for this year. Let us quote:
"... in this country most resi
dential universities are expected
to t;iko some responsibility for the
conduct and well-being of their
women students." This is of
| course the Naturalistic Fallacy.
The rest of the pamphlet con
sists of a minute and falicious ap
plication of the Fundamental
Standard to the "social" (read in
"sexual") lives of Stanford Un
dergraduate women, hypocriti
cally based upon this intention,
among others: "to give a woman
as much freedom as practical so
that she can develop her good
judgment and social maturity."
| Some entertaining examples of
the description of "the minimal
! standards of conduct consistent
with the Fundamental Standard"
■ are: "During the second and third
I quarters a (freshman) woman
| has the privilege of distributing
1 her quota over the quarter";
i "There are to be no erasures on

of the overnight leave requires
thoughtful planning on the part
of each woman"; "... Stanford
! students may take advantage of
j cultural activities which are lo
i fated in adjacent areas and cities
(not Sail Francisco) (boldface
I ours)."
In case a woman has violated
• her understanding of "what she
I may not do and what she may do,"
: she is privileged with "possible
disciplinary action" in which the
Dean's Office and its subsidiaries
exchange in loco parentis for in
loco Dei, conveniently extrapolat
ing fifteen late minutes into
| "gross negligence" or possibly "in

linquencies.
After four years, we are finally
! furious, We are not attacking so
; much the Social Regulations pam
phlet as the hypocrisy it under
writes and the attempt at moral
[dictatorship, largely unsucessful,
for which it stands. The Univer

sity's sphere of influence has far
exceeded its academic preroga

en students into "social maturity"
by simply removing occasion for
temptation is naive. We have ex

| Dear Sir:
; Ideally, the following are axio
matic for anyone attending or ad
! ministering a residence-univer
sity: a) Dormitories exist for tho
I convenience of the student and
j for the advancement of an intel
lectual milieu, not for the conveni
ence of the Dean's Office in regu
lating the social conduct of stu
dents; b) Legal systems are for
the protection of personal a n d
'property rights, not for the impo
sition of arbitrary moralities.
Most of the social regulations
j at Stanford are dictated by stan
i dards of "morality" set by the
Dean's Office. Furthermore, these
standards seem to us to be either
i a) the promulgation of a moral
code peculiar to Dean Allen her
self, or b> the Dean's imaginative
assumption of herself in loco pa
rentis for 1718 undergraduate
women students.
We have at our side a copy of
"Social Regulations and Proce
dures" for this year. Let us quote:
"... in this country most resi
dential universities are expected
to t;iko some responsibility for the
conduct and well-being of their
women students." This is of
| course the Naturalistic Fallacy.
The rest of the pamphlet con
sists of a minute and falicious ap
plication of the Fundamental
Standard to the "social" (read in
"sexual") lives of Stanford Un
dergraduate women, hypocriti
cally based upon this intention,
among others: "to give a woman
as much freedom as practical so
that she can develop her good
judgment and social maturity."
| Some entertaining examples of
the description of "the minimal
! standards of conduct consistent
with the Fundamental Standard"
■ are: "During the second and third
I quarters a (freshman) woman
| has the privilege of distributing
1 her quota over the quarter";
i "There are to be no erasures on
| a sign-out card"; "Intelligent use
of the overnight leave requires
thoughtful planning on the part
of each woman"; "... Stanford
! students may take advantage of
j cultural activities which are lo
i fated in adjacent areas and cities
(not Sail Francisco) (boldface
I ours)."
In case a woman has violated
• her understanding of "what she
I may not do and what she may do,"
: she is privileged with "possible
disciplinary action" in which the
Dean's Office and its subsidiaries
exchange in loco parentis for in
loco Dei, conveniently extrapolat
ing fifteen late minutes into
| "gross negligence" or possibly "in
; tent to deceive and other moral de
linquencies.
After four years, we are finally
! furious, We are not attacking so
; much the Social Regulations pam
phlet as the hypocrisy it under
writes and the attempt at moral
[dictatorship, largely unsucessful,
for which it stands. The Univer

sity's sphere of influence has far
exceeded its academic preroga
tives; its attempt to educate wom
en students into "social maturity"
by simply removing occasion for
temptation is naive. We have ex
amined the functions and politices
of Stanford University with re
spect to ourselves and we find the
social directives superfluous and
irrelevant. Therefore we reject
them.

• Spirit of Giving
Dear Sir:
It is unfortunate that sending
food to the Mississippi Negroes
has been confused with the cur
rent Civil Rights effort.
As one who cannot sympathize
with the tactics used by the Stu
dent Non-violent Co-ordinating
Committee and its related organ
izations, as I feel they are both
harmful and wrong, I would like
to see this project organized in
dependently, without being asso
ciated with anything but what it
expressly intends to accomplish.
Rather than being motivated
by the self-satisfying anticipa
tion that giving to this project
will relieve a falsely inspired
sense of guilt, the project should
be motivated by the spirit of giv
ing — to help the Mississippi
Negroes through their winter
hardship as one man would like
to help another man who is in
need.
