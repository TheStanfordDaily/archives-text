# HOWARD WARNS
## 'Moral Revolution Needed' 
### DICK BALLANTINE 
Mr. Peter Howard, Director of
I International Moral Rearmament,
spoke to approximately 350 peo
ple in Dinkelspiel Auditorium yes
terday. Entitled "Tomorrow Is
Too Late," his address covered
various subjects and was well re
ceived by the audience.
Howard stated that the job of
IMR is to "up the level of moral
rearmament in everybody," not
I just the people of the United
States. "Few people in the West

| understand what liberty is and
how it is being destroyed."
THK ONLY WAY to combat
London and Washington. They
i had laughed.
NOW, AFTER the explosion,
Communism, ho said, "Is to out
revolutionize Communism." The
necessary revolution, Howard
made clear, is not through the
I use of bombs, tortures or smear,
; but is the revolution of human
nature based on absolute moral
I standards.

Talking about the Russian-
Chinese split, Howard said that
"This split is a division of color,
not continent." Khrushchev fell
because he was a realist. He no
longer believed that the interests
of Russia coincided with those of
China."
Howard said that he had heard
last year that China was going
to explode a nuclear bomb, and
â€¢ that ho had told men in both
the Western world has relaxed, he
said, because it's assumed that
th e bomb was of an out-dated
type. "This is mediocre states
manship to turn over in slumber,"
he said in describing Western re
' actions.
Switching to Africa, Howard
; said that most Africans think of
I the U.S. as "drinks, dollars,
| dames, and of course, football."
Americans, ho continued, are
also related to "big guns, big
purses, . . . false hearts, and un
known aims." It is this image
that moral realignment, can cor
rect. he said.
Russia is also in need of a
"moral rearmament," Howard
said. He cited the story of two
former Olympic medal winners
who travelled with this year's
Olympic team and who talked
with Russian athletes in Japan.
UK SAID THAT both sides de
scribe the need for new spirit
in their countries. Although this
' meeting has been relatively un-
I publicized, il was one of the most
I successful results of the Olym
' pics, Howard said.
