# SPECIAL SESSION
## LASSU Will Consider Free Speech Proposal New Committee To Examine disenchantment' Over NSA 
### JOE KOSENBLOOM 
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw has called a special session of the
Legislature tonight to consider a resolution regarding the Free
Speech Movement at the University of California.
The move came late in LASSUs regular meeting last night
after a roll call vote failed to establish the presence of a quorum.

The request for a roll call came
from representatives presumably
opposed to the adoption of a pro
posed resolution under considera
tion by the legislature.
THE RESOLUTION would
have notieied Berkeley authorities,
including the Board of Regents,
which meets to consider the ques
tion later this week, that LASSU
supports the principles of Ihe
stand taken Monday by (he sen
ate of the Associated Students of
the University of California.
The Senate's resolution stated
that students should have the
right to hold political activity in
university designated areas and
io hold demonstrations in those
areas.
LASSU Speaker Shaw urged all
representatives to attend the
special session of the Legislature
at 7:30 p.m. tonight because "any
decision will reflect the opinion
of the Stanford student body on
this issue."
IX OTHER business last
night, the legislature approved a
resolution establishing a survey
committee to investigate the it?-
lationship of the Associated Stu
dents to the National Student
Association of which Stanford is
a member.
The committee will attempt to
clarify the function of the NSA,
and will consider past criticism of
the organization. Other schools
associated with NSA have alleged
ly expressed "disenchantment"
with the national association.
Also the Legislature rejected
the Student Affairs Commission
bill which would have given the
vote to LASSU representatives
who are serving as ex-officio
members of various boards and
commissions.
The By-Laws Committee had
recommended the Legislature de
teat the bill. The intention of the
bill had been to increase the rep
resentatives' interest in th e
boards and commissions by means
of the vote.
IT WAS generally felt by the
LASSU members, however, that
the Legislature should not extend

further control over tlie councils.
Certain student groups, partic
ularly the Tresiclder Union Board,
had expressed strong opposition
to the proposed bill.

recommended the Legislature de
teat the bill. The intention of the
bill had been to increase the rep
resentatives' interest in th e
boards and commissions by means
of the vote.
IT WAS generally felt by the
LASSU members, however, that
the Legislature should not extend

further control over tlie councils.
Certain student groups, partic
ularly the Tresiclder Union Board,
had expressed strong opposition
to the proposed bill.
