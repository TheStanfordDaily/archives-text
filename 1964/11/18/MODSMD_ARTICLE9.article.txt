### 
The long-awaited cannon-t'or
cards trade between SURF and
{Cal finally went through last
(night despite an attempted RF
!hy a group of Stanford students.
SURF head Biff De√üivort and
Doug Patterson, Cal Rally Com
Chairman, had agreed on terms
for the exchange in a meeting in
ja coffee shop near the Cow
' Palace.
j Under the agreement SURF
would return the stolen cannon
in exchange for the long-missing
Stanford football banner and all
of the missing stunt cards except
the blue, gold, green, and black
ones.
When the Cal truck loaded with
the cards arrived, however, it was
immediately surrounded by three
carloads of Stanford students,
apparently intent on recovering
all of the cards. The ensuing
struggle ended abruptly when
local police arrived on the scene.
