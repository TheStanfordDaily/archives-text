The True and The False
It was Jesus Christ who said, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life,
no man comes to the Father but by me." (John 14:6). Truth, He said, was
not theology or doctrine. Rather Jesus said that He Himself, a living Person
was the Truth. Contrasting the wisdom of Cod to the wisdom of this world
which passes away or runs in endless, closed circles, Paul said, ' We preach
Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those
who are called, both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the
Wisdom of God" (I Corinthinians 1:3 24). In His letter to the Colossians,
(1:3, 19), Poul goes a step further in saying that all the fullness of God was
pleased to dwell ' in Jesus Christ and that Christ was the Person "in whom
were lud all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
It is readily apparent from God's Word that any religion which denies
Jesus Christ or has a defective belief concerning the Visible Expression of an
invisible God (Hebrews 1:1-3), is a religion devoid of truth. This is why
the religions of the word are such great stagnant eddies or lifeless swamps
cut off from the stream of Life and Truth which flows from Jesus Christ.
Throughout the ages since the beginning of time, God has given men a
knowledge of Himself, the knowledge of the Eternal Son of God, Jesus Christ.
It is man s perversion and corruption of the truth which has led to the other
great" religions, and to man's continual seeking for substitutes that he
might gratify his own desires and further his own selfish ends.
People everywhere today are looking and searching for a truth which
works, for answers which are consistent. Unfortunately even in many Christian
churches in America today, there is little of the Light of the world, the Light
and Truth which is Jesus Christ, Lord of glory.
Should you be among those searching for truth, perhaps questing among
the religions of the word or even looking at Christianity for the first time,
we urge you to test what you hear and read against the Word of God as
recorded in First John, chapter 4 verses 1-6: Beloved, do not believe every
spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God; for many false
prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God:
eveiy spirit which confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of
God and every spirit which docs not confess Jesus is not of God. This is the
spirit of antichrist, of which you have heard that it was coming, and now
it is in the world."
Looking for Truth? Meet Him. His name is Jesus Christ. Invite Him into
vc i life as Lord today and see for yourself.
