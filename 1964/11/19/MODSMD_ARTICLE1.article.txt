# Petition For Free Speech At Cat Stirs Up Campus
## 
### BRUCE BURTON 
Controversy over "free speech" at the
University of California has flared up at
Stanford this week following circulation
of a campus petition supporting "free
speech" at Cal as well as a more contro
versial "immunity" clause.
"Free speech" at Berkeley would give
students the right to solicit funds and
membership for political organizations
on campus. The immunity clause, now
demanded by the Free Speech Movement,
would primarily prevent University ex
pulsion of students arrested and con
would primarily prevent University ex
victed as a result of off-campus demon
strations.
THE PETITION was drafted last week
end by several members of the Young
Democrats, including YD Resolutions
Committee Chairman Jay Kadane. It
was then amended with a paragraph
drawn up by the FSM, advocating the
immunity clause. According to YD Pub
licity Chairman Steve Leopold, the So
cialist Caucus, the Peace Caucus and the
Hillel Foundation have also passed reso
lutions supporting the petition.
The controversy, however, centers

around whether the wording of the docu
ment supports the Free Speech Move
ment, or the movement for free speech
on the Cal campus.
One controversy centers around
whether the wording of the document
supports the Free Speech Movement at
Cal, or merely the more general demands
:jf various Cal groups for fewer restric
tions on their activities.
YD SPOKESMEN say "tin 1 petition
does not mention the FSM as such." Yes
terday Ihe YDs issued a statement say
ing: "We believe that political and re
ligious must be safeguarded for every
member of the community, no matter
what his views. "Our support for these
principals is not dependent upon th e
views, personalities, or tactics of those
who seek to secure them.
"We support the right of the students
to organize political and religious groups
on any campus, to solicit members, and
to speak freely on political, religious,
and social problems."
The second major controversy is the
inclusion in the petition of an "immun
ity clause." It say, "Only courts of law

should have the power to judge whether
the content of speech on campus is an
abuse of constitutional rights of free
speech."
UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT C lark
Kerr said last week that if the University
changes its policy so as to allow the cam
pus to be used for the mounting of off
campus action it will have to discipline
those who violate laws off-campus.
This is necessary, he said, so that the
University should not become "a base
from which illegal action is mounted
against the surrounding community."
Kadane feels the University would
leave itself open to "endless political
pressure" from people who object to par
ticular causes being promoted by stu
dents.
TIIE YOUNG Republicans at Stanford
have not joined in the petition effort.
President John Bonine said, "Immunity
from University discipline for the advo
cacy of off-campus actions which result
in illegal activity has become the main
goal of FSM. This does not have much
to do with the general goal of freedom
of political activity."

TEXT OF PETITION
PRESIDENT CLARK KERR:
WE, the undersigned members of the
Stanford University community, support
the students of the University of Califor
nia in their demands to allow student
political groups the right t4» use desig
nated campus areas to solicit funds and
membership ami to advocate political
demonstrations or other action.
Only courts of law should have the

speech on campus is an abuse of consti
tutional right of free speech. Only courts
of law should have the power to impose
punishment if these rights are abused.
Therefore, we ask the administration to
recognize that it should not usurp these
powers.
WE feel the University in not guaran
teeing these freedoms is violating the
purpose of the university community as
a place of learning and investigation of
ideas and that political freedoms guaran
teed to a student as a citizen off the cam

WE urge that you do all in your power

Controversy over "free speech" at the
University of California has flared up at
Stanford this week following circulation
of a campus petition supporting "free
speech" at Cal as well as a more contro
versial "immunity" clause.
"Free speech" at Berkeley would give
students the right to solicit funds and
membership for political organizations
on campus. The immunity clause, now
demanded by the Free Speech Movement,
would primarily prevent University ex
pulsion of students arrested and con
would primarily prevent University ex
victed as a result of off-campus demon
strations.
THE PETITION was drafted last week
end by several members of the Young
Democrats, including YD Resolutions
Committee Chairman Jay Kadane. It
was then amended with a paragraph
drawn up by the FSM, advocating the
immunity clause. According to YD Pub
licity Chairman Steve Leopold, the So
cialist Caucus, the Peace Caucus and the
Hillel Foundation have also passed reso
lutions supporting the petition.
The controversy, however, centers

around whether the wording of the docu
ment supports the Free Speech Move
ment, or the movement for free speech
on the Cal campus.
One controversy centers around
whether the wording of the document
supports the Free Speech Movement at
Cal, or merely the more general demands
:jf various Cal groups for fewer restric
tions on their activities.
YD SPOKESMEN say "tin 1 petition
does not mention the FSM as such." Yes
terday Ihe YDs issued a statement say
ing: "We believe that political and re
ligious must be safeguarded for every
member of the community, no matter
what his views. "Our support for these
principals is not dependent upon th e
views, personalities, or tactics of those
who seek to secure them.
"We support the right of the students
to organize political and religious groups
on any campus, to solicit members, and
to speak freely on political, religious,
and social problems."
The second major controversy is the
inclusion in the petition of an "immun
ity clause." It say, "Only courts of law

should have the power to judge whether
the content of speech on campus is an
abuse of constitutional rights of free
speech."
UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT C lark
Kerr said last week that if the University
changes its policy so as to allow the cam
pus to be used for the mounting of off
campus action it will have to discipline
those who violate laws off-campus.
This is necessary, he said, so that the
University should not become "a base
from which illegal action is mounted
against the surrounding community."
Kadane feels the University would
leave itself open to "endless political
pressure" from people who object to par
ticular causes being promoted by stu
dents.
TIIE YOUNG Republicans at Stanford
have not joined in the petition effort.
President John Bonine said, "Immunity
from University discipline for the advo
cacy of off-campus actions which result
in illegal activity has become the main
goal of FSM. This does not have much
to do with the general goal of freedom
of political activity."
