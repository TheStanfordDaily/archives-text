# Record Breaking Craig Morton Leads California Aerial Attack
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Big Game this Saturday will
! feature the defense of Stanford
| against the California Bears led
Iby quarterback Craig Morton.
Morton is already billed as the
\ passer who "never has a bad
: day."
MORTON IS a sturdy back,
weighing 215 pounds and stand
ing 6-4, and has good speed, mak
ing him a threat on the rollout
also, However, he specializes in
the "long bomb" and has the rec
ords to prove it.
The Cal standout already holds
1 18 passing records for his own
! school as well as 4 AAWU rec
ords. He goes into Saturday's
! game with a good chance to break
I four more. Most of the former
; conference records were held by
j Don Heinrich of Washington and
I were set in 1952.
FOR HIS CAREER, Morton
â–  has gained over 4,000 yards pass
ing while compiling a 55.4 com
pletion average in three years.
Jack Schraub, Morton's top re
ceiver, also has a few records.
This year Schraub became the
first person in California history
to catch passes for more than
1 000 yards in three years. Mor
ton has thrown as many as 5
touchdown passes in one game
and has accounted for 44 touch

downs in his career by rushing
and passing.
It is interesting to note lhat
Morton has never had a good day
for Big Games. In 1962, already
hailed as one of the league's best
backs, lie threw Hvo touchdown
passes in the !rst half, and Cal
led 13-3 at halflime. However, he
was completely blitzed in the sec
ond half as Stanford roared back.
Morton was held to 67 yards on
7 passes completed out of 20, as
Clark Weaver threw three touch
down passes for the Indians.
Stanford defensive backs also in
tercepted three passes and Stan
ford won 30-13.
IN 1963, MORTON completed
8 of IS passes but was ineffec
tive as Stanford scored a 28-17
victory. He had two passes inter
cepted that year.
Morton's last "bad day" came
last week in Cal's 14-0 loss to
Utah. Before the game started,
Morton had thrown touchdown
passes in 1G straight games, but
he was shut out in that depart
ment. When Utah defenders in
tercepted one of Morton's aerials,

it marked the first time in 97 at
tempts that the tall Bear had had
a pass stolen. Utah intercepted
another pass later in the game.
If past history holds true for
this year, Craig Morton will be
thwarted in his attempt at more
for heralded quarterbacks,
records, and Stanford will score
its fourth consecutive Big Game
victory. As Oregon State's Paul
Brothers found out last week and
Oregon's Bob Berry two weeks
before that, the Stanford defense
is adept at producing "bad days"
