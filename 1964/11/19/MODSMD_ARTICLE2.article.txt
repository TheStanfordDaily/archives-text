# ASUC Senate Proposes Liberal Political Policy
## 
### BETH STEVENS 
The Student Senate at the Uni
versity of California approved
yesterday a proposal to liberalize
restrictions on political activity
at Cal.
It would allow "all legal activ
ity" on campus and declare
"illegal activity off the campus
... is the private business of the
student." However, proof that
"direct cause" of illegal action be
gan on the campus is punishable
by a legal procedure administered
by a faculty committee.
THE NEW PROPOSAL is an
amended version of a Report of
the Faculty Group which was
made last Friday, and which
granted many demands of both
the Free Speech Movement and
other individuals working for in
creased political freedom at Cal.
The amended report seeks to
answer criticisms of the faculty
proposal as "vague" and also sug
gests increased liberalizations as
to areas which maay be used for
booths, the use of the student
office building for meetings of
student groups, and procedural
protections for students advocat
ing off-campus activity which re
sults in illegal conduct.
The "fair hearing" by a faculty
committee is refined by the addi
tion of specific "due process"
provisions, such as the right to
legal counsel, cross-examination,
and appeal to courts of law.
FSM LEADER Mario Savio said
of the ASUC Senate proposal:
We regret that this committee
has failed to endorse a principal
stand in the Free Speech Move
ment. namely that only the courts
be judge when speech is in abuse
of constitutionally guaranteed po
litical rights."
Another key student figure
said, "The ASUC Senate acted too
hastily. The members of the Sen
ate have too little knowledge of

i the legal language necessary to
| guarantee that any liberalization
j will he implemented."
University President Clark Kerr
'has received the proposal, but de-
I dined comment, saying only that
he would present his own recom
mendations to the Regents. These
are expected to contain substan
tial portions of the original fac
: ulty proposal.
