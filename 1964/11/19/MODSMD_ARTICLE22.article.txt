# Editor, The Daily
## More On The Petition 
### 
Dear Sir:
The editorial in yesterday's
Daily was a rather interesting
document, tortured in part, in
accurate in others.
We'll ignore the regrettable em
phasis made by Mr. Naylor on
the implied "guilt by association"
of those students who sign the
free speech petition being circu
lated around the campus.
Let us, instead, clear up some
factual errors. The meeting did
pass this resolution after Mario
Savio spoke here. However, the
resolution they passed — unani
mously had been written three
days previously and was printed
in The Daily the very day Savio
spoke.
Again, considerable efforts were
made by the YD's to get someone
from the faculty or tlie adminis
tration down here from Cal. Five
faculty members. Dean Frank L.
Kiddner, and the Chancellor's
Office were contacted; none could
come, nor could they entice any
one else to.
The petition being circulated
does not mention the tactics of
the Free Speech Movement; it
only endorses their goals. Men
such as Charles Drekmeier, Otis
Pease, Gordon Wright and Gordon
Craig have already signed it.
Perhaps members of the s t u
dent body would not be so leary
of being associated with these
professors. Unlike Mr. Naylor,
we don't urge any student to act
on the merits of "association"
alone. Rather, we only ask them
to read the petition and decide.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The final
form of the petition in question
was drafted after consultation
with Mario Savio and other
FSM loaders Sunday evening at
Savio's apartment in Berkeley.
It was not the same as that
suniitted by Mr. Leopold Sun
day afternoon and printed in
Monday's Daily.
Furthermore, the following
appeared in yesterday's San
Francisco Examiner, p. 13.
"The Free Speech Movement
received support yesterday from
students at Stanford University
who set up tables on the cam
pus to collect signatures for a
petition to Kerr."
As we said in yesterday's
editorial, association of th e
petition with FSM is, regret
table though it may seem, quite
unavoidable.
• Warfare State
Dear Sir:
Last year, former President j
Eisenhower informed an audience

oJ UCLA students that "the uni
versity is America's first, line of
defense." The surprise is the apt
ness of his comment; the tragedy,
our acceptance of this state of
affairs. We agree, by sins of om
mission as well as of commission,
to staff the real DEW Line, the
university training ground for
the warfare-state corporations.
Corporations are notoriously
j conformist. Corporations that
are military as well can hardly
countenance free speech. A Dept.
of Defense poster which recently
appeared on the Stanford campus
read: "The answer must be no
unless he has a need to know.''
And this "need to know" is omi
nously decided by needs of the
job. And the job is more than
ominous.
Academic freedom, in such a
light, spreads very little light. The
academic freedom approved of by
most universities is that of dis
agreement on tactics, not funda
mentals; in short, it tends toward
the disagreement permitted in
Communist states.
The Establishment which sus
tains the university system denies
a real Socratic dialogue because
such demands confrontation and,
hopefully, resolution of opposites.
Opposities implies alternatives;
the Establishment is afraid be
cause students are becoming
aware that real alternatives exist
to the organized insanity of this
society.
The Emperors may have no
clothes but as long as the mass
public continues to imagine that
they do, these Emperors wield
awesome authority. It is this illu
sion which the students at Cal
have seen through. And now it is
this authority which they have
defied.
For such lese majeste they have
been denied even their paper
rights of free speech and assem
bly on a public campus. Those
who have talked back too much
have been suspended.
And now the HUAC, which ex-
President Truman calls "the most
un-American thing about Amer
ica" may soon set up its inquisi
tion in San Francisco. This Com
mittee to defend American democ
racy is headed by Congressman
Willis, a gentleman, Louisiana
style.
For one, I can only be grateful
that a few students at Cal have
had the courage to say "no" to
the assembly line of automatic
education, of an education geared
for annihilation. That they have
merited denial of right, suspen- i
sion, and, now, inquisition testi- j
fies to their conscience and cour
age.

• French Dept. Defended
Dear Sir:
An attack was recently made
against the "new method" em
ployed for the first-year courses
in the French Department. As
children of this new method, we
feel moved to reply in its defense.
For most of us French is a sec
ond or third foreign language;
we speak therefore, with some
knowledge and perspective
The first three quarters of
French instruction has been an
altogether un i q u e experience.
There pervades the classes of be
ginning French an atmosphere of
excitement. Classes are actually
enjoyable, enjoyable because they
I are interesting as well as educat
ing. This came as an apparent
contradiction to us, for whom be
ginning a foreign language has
(always meant hours of tedious
|drill, memorization and transla
j tion.
Unfortunately, the congenial at
mosphere generated by the new
j method has been equated by some
with frivolity. This criticism
seems completely ridiculous to us.
The facility with which we can
! speak, write, and understand
French points to the unmistak
! able effectiveness of the new
method. In our first and second
i quarters we were speaking and
j writing better than in the fourth
and fifth quarters of other lan
i guages. This, we insist, is due to
the excellence of the new meth
j od.
The new method of the French
Department has shown us that
learning a language need not be
an oppressive task, that a sense
of humor and an emphasis on cre
ativity and imagination can speed
the process of learning and at the
same time make it exciting.
Of course the method is not
perfect. But it has been so effec
tive, it has so obviously surpassed
that which went before, that any
attempt to destroy it would be a
great mistake.
