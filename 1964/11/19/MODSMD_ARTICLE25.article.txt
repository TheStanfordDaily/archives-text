# GAIETIES OPENER
## Go See "It's Jane!' ... After Cocktails 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The reader is cautioned to read the review
in its entirety.

There are two ways to approach this year's Gaieties: the first
is to see it after a heavy eocktail hour starting about four, and the
second it not to see it at all.
The former is to be preferred because 1 — well, it is funny, but
it's even funnier through a warm and pleasant alcoholic haze. That

way ono doesn't notice that
annual evening of frivolity J
marches determinedly on for an
incredible three and a half hours, j
and that there are sizeable patches
of dull-colored writing, acting,!
and singing between the tinsel
and glitter of racy dialogue and
snappy production numbers.
With this admonition in m in d
(which doubtless will not un
heeded), onward to the matter at
hand. This year Gaieties has a
plot, probably its chief saving
grace. It seems that Jane .Stan
ford (who, amazingly enough, h;is
managed to get not only herself
but little Leland and The Spiteful
Peanut Vendor into heaven) is
displeased with the permissive
moral atmosphere at The Univer
sity.
And since, as everyone knows, J
she is the real power in the fam- j
ily, she demands that God change !
her from an aged syphilitic to a '
young, sprightly, and beautiful |
treshman. God acquiesces because
He says things will be so much
more heavenly with her gone. He i
unfortunately cannot do anything
about her moral outlook, which
is nasty-Victorian to the bitter
end.
Jane arrives on Red Day, ready
to make Stanford pure for future;
generations, and immediately is
nearly kissed on Quad under a
full moon. She cries rape, and is I
the laughingstock of the whole'
campus.
Meanwhile, Tower Hoover, cam
pus stud and all-around fraternity |
man, is modestly consoling his I
frustrated harem. "Remember,'
I'm Tower Hoover, the biggest
thing on campus; I've got enough
in me for all my girls." He has
.just bet his Greek brothers that
he will be able to make frigid
Jane into his adoring slave.
In spite of her frightening op
position, he succeeds; and Jane
becomes a real bitehin' bod (Ihe
female counterpart of stud) in
time for the pre-Big-Game fra
ternity party, which insane affair:
features Shaggy Dog and His 1
Three Retrievers. Jane then
rushes off to Big Game, where a
lot of fumbling is done, and ar-;
rives back in Heaven in time for!
the finale, an amalgamation of
the Stanford Hymn and the Halle
lujah Chorus, sung by familiar-1
looking angels with big red S's

on their robes.
Ram's Head advertizes this
concoction as a parody, and pa
rody it is: no one escapes un
scathed. The President, the
deans, the psychiatrists, the Row,
the frats. Stern, the trustees, The
Team and The Will survive, and
badly scarred. Unfortunately, the
acid pen of the authors runs out
of ink every so often, notably in
the bit about Stern vs. fraterni
ties, the LASSU meeting, and the
alumni secretary's little song, "It's
the Look That Counts."
In some cases, however, the
cast is as much at fault as the
pen. There are too many numbers
that suffer from a severe case of
the inaudibilities. Probably too
many mumbles and not enough
belt-it-out. Fortunately, this is not
universal. Carol Rountree is mar
velously audible and appropriately
despicable as Jane in Heaven.
Carol Baker, as her counterpart
on earth, sings well and makes
her prudishness as offensive as it
should be.
Belinda and Rotcee, two of
Tower's Dollies, are played to
perfection by Gretchen Dieben
korn and Liz Kuhn. Liz, inciden
tally, very nearly stops the show
every time she slinks on stage.
Stern Hall's representatives,
Alan Mokler and Steve Wall, as
per usual look about fifteen and
act at least three years younger.
(One of them plays with blocks.)
They are pretty funny, though.
The fraternities have Tower
Hoover, all-campus and maybe;
even all-Peninsula stud, who just
can't keep his hands off those j
dollies. He is played ably and
willingly by Sid Weiss. And Roger '
Connor is hilarious as the stupid
Bruno.
Music-wise, the writing and the]
orchestrations are pretty profes-1
sional and at times memorable.!
In performance they are often |
ragged, but then Ram's Head al-!
ways does have dress rehearsal 1
on opening night.
Set-wise, however, things are]
uniformly superior. They're built j
well, they look good, they change!
like greased lightning, and they
contain one incredibly grotesque;
Mem Claw which actually spouts
water. Gaieties may not be sure
lire, but with a set like Mem Claw I
how can they lose?

treshman. God acquiesces because
He says things will be so much

unfortunately cannot do anything
about her moral outlook, which
is nasty-Victorian to the bitter
end.
Jane arrives on Red Day, ready
to make Stanford pure for future;
generations, and immediately is
nearly kissed on Quad under a
full moon. She cries rape, and is I
the laughingstock of the whole'
campus.
Meanwhile, Tower Hoover, cam
pus stud and all-around fraternity |
man, is modestly consoling his I
frustrated harem. "Remember,'
I'm Tower Hoover, the biggest
thing on campus; I've got enough
in me for all my girls." He has
.just bet his Greek brothers that
he will be able to make frigid
Jane into his adoring slave.
In spite of her frightening op
position, he succeeds; and Jane
becomes a real bitehin' bod (Ihe
female counterpart of stud) in
time for the pre-Big-Game fra
ternity party, which insane affair:
features Shaggy Dog and His 1
Three Retrievers. Jane then
rushes off to Big Game, where a
lot of fumbling is done, and ar-;
rives back in Heaven in time for!
the finale, an amalgamation of
the Stanford Hymn and the Halle
lujah Chorus, sung by familiar-1
looking angels with big red S's

on their robes.
Ram's Head advertizes this
concoction as a parody, and pa
rody it is: no one escapes un
scathed. The President, the
deans, the psychiatrists, the Row,
the frats. Stern, the trustees, The
Team and The Will survive, and
badly scarred. Unfortunately, the
acid pen of the authors runs out
of ink every so often, notably in
the bit about Stern vs. fraterni
ties, the LASSU meeting, and the
alumni secretary's little song, "It's
the Look That Counts."
In some cases, however, the
cast is as much at fault as the
pen. There are too many numbers
that suffer from a severe case of
the inaudibilities. Probably too
many mumbles and not enough
belt-it-out. Fortunately, this is not
universal. Carol Rountree is mar
velously audible and appropriately
despicable as Jane in Heaven.
Carol Baker, as her counterpart
on earth, sings well and makes
her prudishness as offensive as it
should be.
Belinda and Rotcee, two of
Tower's Dollies, are played to
perfection by Gretchen Dieben
korn and Liz Kuhn. Liz, inciden
tally, very nearly stops the show
every time she slinks on stage.
Stern Hall's representatives,
Alan Mokler and Steve Wall, as
per usual look about fifteen and
act at least three years younger.
(One of them plays with blocks.)
They are pretty funny, though.
The fraternities have Tower
Hoover, all-campus and maybe;
even all-Peninsula stud, who just
can't keep his hands off those j
dollies. He is played ably and
willingly by Sid Weiss. And Roger '
Connor is hilarious as the stupid
Bruno.
Music-wise, the writing and the]
orchestrations are pretty profes-1
sional and at times memorable.!
In performance they are often |
ragged, but then Ram's Head al-!
ways does have dress rehearsal 1
on opening night.
Set-wise, however, things are]
uniformly superior. They're built j
well, they look good, they change!
like greased lightning, and they
contain one incredibly grotesque;
Mem Claw which actually spouts
water. Gaieties may not be sure
lire, but with a set like Mem Claw I
how can they lose?
EDITOR'S NOTE: The reader is cautioned to read the review
in its entirety.

There are two ways to approach this year's Gaieties: the first
is to see it after a heavy eocktail hour starting about four, and the
second it not to see it at all.
The former is to be preferred because 1 — well, it is funny, but
it's even funnier through a warm and pleasant alcoholic haze. That

way ono doesn't notice that
annual evening of frivolity J
marches determinedly on for an
incredible three and a half hours, j
and that there are sizeable patches
of dull-colored writing, acting,!
and singing between the tinsel
and glitter of racy dialogue and
snappy production numbers.
With this admonition in m in d
(which doubtless will not un
heeded), onward to the matter at
hand. This year Gaieties has a
plot, probably its chief saving
grace. It seems that Jane .Stan
ford (who, amazingly enough, h;is
managed to get not only herself
but little Leland and The Spiteful
Peanut Vendor into heaven) is
displeased with the permissive
moral atmosphere at The Univer
sity.
And since, as everyone knows, J
she is the real power in the fam- j
ily, she demands that God change !
her from an aged syphilitic to a '
young, sprightly, and beautiful |
treshman. God acquiesces because

Ram's Head advertizes this
concoction as a parody, and pa
rody it is: no one escapes un
scathed. The President, the
deans, the psychiatrists, the Row,
the frats. Stern, the trustees, The
Team and The Will survive, and
badly scarred. Unfortunately, the
acid pen of the authors runs out
of ink every so often, notably in
the bit about Stern vs. fraterni
ties, the LASSU meeting, and the
alumni secretary's little song, "It's
the Look That Counts."
In some cases, however, the
cast is as much at fault as the
pen. There are too many numbers
that suffer from a severe case of
the inaudibilities. Probably too
many mumbles and not enough
belt-it-out. Fortunately, this is not
universal. Carol Rountree is mar
velously audible and appropriately
despicable as Jane in Heaven.
Carol Baker, as her counterpart
on earth, sings well and makes
her prudishness as offensive as it
should be.
Belinda and Rotcee, two of
Tower's Dollies, are played to
perfection by Gretchen Dieben
korn and Liz Kuhn. Liz, inciden
tally, very nearly stops the show
every time she slinks on stage.
Stern Hall's representatives,
Alan Mokler and Steve Wall, as

act at least three years younger.
(One of them plays with blocks.)
They are pretty funny, though.
The fraternities have Tower

even all-Peninsula stud, who just
can't keep his hands off those j
dollies. He is played ably and
willingly by Sid Weiss. And Roger '

Music-wise, the writing and the]
orchestrations are pretty profes-1

Mem Claw which actually spouts

how can they lose?
EDITOR'S NOTE: The reader is cautioned to read the review
in its entirety.

There are two ways to approach this year's Gaieties: the first
is to see it after a heavy eocktail hour starting about four, and the
second it not to see it at all.
The former is to be preferred because 1 — well, it is funny, but
it's even funnier through a warm and pleasant alcoholic haze. That

way ono doesn't notice that
annual evening of frivolity J
marches determinedly on for an
incredible three and a half hours, j
and that there are sizeable patches
of dull-colored writing, acting,!
and singing between the tinsel
and glitter of racy dialogue and
snappy production numbers.
With this admonition in m in d
(which doubtless will not un
heeded), onward to the matter at
hand. This year Gaieties has a
plot, probably its chief saving
grace. It seems that Jane .Stan
ford (who, amazingly enough, h;is
managed to get not only herself
but little Leland and The Spiteful
Peanut Vendor into heaven) is
displeased with the permissive
moral atmosphere at The Univer
sity.
And since, as everyone knows, J
she is the real power in the fam- j
ily, she demands that God change !
her from an aged syphilitic to a '
young, sprightly, and beautiful |
treshman. God acquiesces because
He says things will be so much
more heavenly with her gone. He i
unfortunately cannot do anything
about her moral outlook, which
is nasty-Victorian to the bitter
end.
Jane arrives on Red Day, ready
to make Stanford pure for future;
generations, and immediately is
nearly kissed on Quad under a
full moon. She cries rape, and is I
the laughingstock of the whole'
campus.
Meanwhile, Tower Hoover, cam
pus stud and all-around fraternity |
man, is modestly consoling his I
frustrated harem. "Remember,'
I'm Tower Hoover, the biggest
thing on campus; I've got enough
in me for all my girls." He has
.just bet his Greek brothers that
he will be able to make frigid
Jane into his adoring slave.
In spite of her frightening op
position, he succeeds; and Jane
becomes a real bitehin' bod (Ihe
female counterpart of stud) in
time for the pre-Big-Game fra
ternity party, which insane affair:
features Shaggy Dog and His 1
Three Retrievers. Jane then
rushes off to Big Game, where a
lot of fumbling is done, and ar-;
rives back in Heaven in time for!
the finale, an amalgamation of
the Stanford Hymn and the Halle
lujah Chorus, sung by familiar-1
looking angels with big red S's

on their robes.
