# Cal Goes A'Gunning For Its Golden Gun
## 
### JON ROISE Crime Reporter 
With Big Game only ST
hours away late Tuesday
nijrlit, the Cal Rally Com, or
at least one of its members,
came to the conclusion that it
takes a gun to get a gun.
Mike Lee, secretary-treas
urer of the group, was ar
rested and jailed briefly in
•sail Francisco after brand
ishing a loaded revolver in
connection with a SI RF-
Rally Com meeting.
The meeting itself resulted
in the successful trade of
Cat's victory cannon for Stan
ford's stunt cards and foot
hall banner.
The gun incident oecuretl
outside the Castle Bowling
Alley near the Cow Palace
just before negotiations were
to begin between Biff tleßi
vort of SURF and Doug
rattersen, chairman of the
Cal Rally Com.
Lee, driving a yellow Chev
rolet pick-up truck loaded
with Stanford's cards, arrived
at the site of the rendezvous
and pulled over to the curb
to park. Three ears imme
diately pulled up, one in
front, one. in back, and one to
the left of l/ee. boxing the
truck against the curb.
About fifteen burly fresh
men. all over six feet tall,
piled out of the cars and con
gregated about the truck.
One broke the right front fly
window with a ball-peen ham
mer and squirted tear gas
into the cab with a toy water
pistol.
Lee immediately put on a
gas mask he had with him,
and then picked up the loaded
revolver, which was on the
seat.
According to one member
of the Stanford gang, Lee
pointed his gun at the person
who broke the window and
yelled. "Scram! Get out of my
way!"

Lee, however, later denied
pointing the weapon. "I
picked the glin up and put it
in the glove compartment,"
lie said, "so that, when I
pulled out, it would not fall
io the floor and discharge."
In either ease, Lee then
smashed his truck into the
ear in Iron). The driver, tak
ing th e hint, moved his
vehicle, allowing - Lee to drive
ahead.
Alter police had taken Lee
away, negotiations were re
sumed. and at 1:00 a.m. yes
teday the Treaty of Castle
Lanes was signed.
In addition to the imme
diate trades, the Treaty pro
vided for the return of the
remainder of Stanford's stunt
cards in exchange for Cal's
ASUC flag - and a few miscel
laneous L : <' stunt cards be
fore Saturday morning.
The actual exchanging of
cannon - for • cards • and •
banner was done at 1:00 a.m.
under a near-full moon al a
gas station across the street
from the Hall of Justice in
San Francisco, where the Cal
crew had gone to await Lee's
release; from custody.
Lee thought that he had
acted in a responsible man
ner. "I personally acted to
protect myself and the prop
erty we were holding," he
stated after his release.
Dcßivort, however, found
liis actions hasty. "Bringing
a loaded revolver to a college
l»F shows very poor .judg
ment and a degree of imma
turity not fitting a member
of the Cal Rally Com," he
said.
ilill Kuelui, president of
Stanford's Axe Com, sym
pathized with neither side.
"It's unfortunate," he mused,
"that members from both
schools allowed the strength
nl their feelings to carry
them so far."

stated after his release.

said.

hours away late Tuesday
nijrlit, the Cal Rally Com, or
at least one of its members,

Mike Lee, secretary-treas
urer of the group, was ar
rested and jailed briefly in
•sail Francisco after brand
ishing a loaded revolver in

at the site of the rendezvous
and pulled over to the curb
to park. Three ears imme
diately pulled up, one in
front, one. in back, and one to
the left of l/ee. boxing the
truck against the curb.
About fifteen burly fresh
men. all over six feet tall,
piled out of the cars and con
gregated about the truck.
One broke the right front fly
window with a ball-peen ham
mer and squirted tear gas
into the cab with a toy water
pistol.
Lee immediately put on a
gas mask he had with him,
and then picked up the loaded
revolver, which was on the
seat.
According to one member
of the Stanford gang, Lee
pointed his gun at the person
who broke the window and
yelled. "Scram! Get out of my
way!"

Lee, however, later denied
pointing the weapon. "I
picked the glin up and put it
in the glove compartment,"
lie said, "so that, when I
pulled out, it would not fall
io the floor and discharge."
In either ease, Lee then
smashed his truck into the
ear in Iron). The driver, tak
ing th e hint, moved his
vehicle, allowing - Lee to drive
ahead.
