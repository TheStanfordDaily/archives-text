# CAMPUSES APPROVED IN AUSTRIA, ENGLAND
## Could Open In '65 
### 
Two new overseas campuses,
one in Knglantl and one in Aus
tria, are expected to open dur
ing the 19(35-66 school year.
Approval of the two sites,
which was given yesterday l\y the
Stanford Board of Trustees, will
enable University administrators
to execute the necessary eon
tracts.
THIS BRITISH campus is 127-
year-old Harlaxton Manor, in the
heart of Lincolnshire, made fam
ous by Rob in Hood and his
men. It is about 23 miles south
'il Nottingham, near the town of
Grantham.
The Austrian campus will oc
cupy much of a five-story resort
hotel at Semmering, 57 miles
south of Vienna, about 3,500 feet
high in the foothills of the Alps.
"The addition of two more
European campuses to the exist
ing three will allow more than
50 per cent of Stanford under
graduates to study in Europe be
fore receiving their degree,'' em
phasized I>r. Robert A. Walker,
director of Stanford overseas
campuses. "This compares with
about 33 per cent at present."
TIIISKIS WILL be SO men and
women at both the British and
tlie Austrian campuses for the
usual six-month terms.
Stanford faculty will teach at
both campuses. Local language
teachers will he employed in Aus
tria while the British campus will
be oriented more toward visiting
faculty from five nearby major
British universities Cambridge,
Leicester, Nottingham. Birming
ham, and Sheffield.
"BOTH (A M I*l si ;s were chos
en for their exciting possibilities,"
states Dr. Walker. "The Harlax
ton campus is in the Midlands,
where the Industrial Revolution
was born. The Semmering cam
pus is only ;i few hours away
from the two Iron Curtain coun
tries Czechoslovakia and Yugosla
via. both of which' students will
visit."
The turreted Harlaxton Manor
was completed about 1837. It will
be leased from a Jesuit order
that has been using it as a novi
tiate. It has efficient and com
plete central heating equipment,
a new kitchen and dining hall,
and extensive modern plumbing.
Grantham, the nearest town, is
three miles away, located on the
main railways and highway be
tween London, 100 miles south,
and Edinburgh. Nearby Notting
ham boasts four theaters, one of
which is a permanent Shakespear
ian repertory.
IN SISMMISKING, Stanford will
use part of the Panhans Hotel,
a noted European spa and vaca
tion spot. The Stanford section
will be completely separated from
the rest of the hotel, which will
operate as usual.
Stanford pioneered its first
undergraduate Overseas Campus
near Stuttgart, Germany, in 1958.
It followed with similar campuses
at Tours. France and Florence,
Italy, in 1960.


Stanford will lease half of the hotel, famous in
Europe as a spa and vacation spot.
