# The
						Adventures Of An Axe
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Axe which today is well
guarded in a bank vault deep in
the freeway maize of the Penin
sula has not always been a trophy
to be passed from hand to hand.
Conceived in 1599 as a gimmick
to boost Indian spirit for a Stan
ford-Cal athletic contest, the
Axe's worth assumed monolithic
proportions when Bear rooters
snatched the Axe from under In
dian noses at an athletic tussle.
The very first roots of Ihe Axe
tradition begin in 1895, only a few
short years after Stanford opened
its doors.
That year Jake Erwin and
Chris Bradley co-authored the
Axe Yell. The yell was, as it is
now, a central theme in the an
nual surge of "kill Cal" senti
ments.
Axe Originates
Four years later in a burst of
inspiration by an Indian cheer
leader the spirit of the Axe Yell
was materialized. During the
1898-1899 school year Stanford
had lost to Cal in both football
and basketball, and, with spirits
drooping, a baseball encounter
was approaching.
A giant bonfire and rally was
scheduled for cent erf ield of the
baseball diamond 1o urge Indian
athletes on to their best perform
ances. The rally was held April
15, 1899, two days before the base
ball game.
Billy Erb, the head yell leader
at the time, saw that something
extra was needed to boost Stan
ford's resolves to beat their
Berkeley brethren.
Although he didn't realize it at
the time Erb's answer was im
] measurably successful. With the
Axe Yell in mind Erb thought it
would be a great gimmick for
providing the rally with life if
he had a real axe.
First Bear Beheaded
lie had a 15 inch tomahawk
shaped axe made. It was painted

red with a big white "S" on
either side of the head. At the
rally Erb sharpened the Axe and,
screams of "give 'em the Axe!",
chased and caught an effigy of a
bear, beheaded it, and threw it
into the fire.
At the game, held in San Fran
cisco, the yell leaders brought the
Axe along and paraded it around
the field. Stanford lost the game,
9-7.
Disgruntled Indians were quiet
ly dispersing and Erb entrusted
the Axe to Carl Hayden, present
ly president pro-tem of th e
United States Senate.
Hayden was attacked by a gang
of Cal rooters who had been un
happy at having the Axe paraded
in front of their faces for the
whole game.
Paul Castlehun, a Cal football
player, snatched the Axe and,the
Cal mob took off down the streets
of San Francisco. Stanford hurd
ler Frank Strout grabbed the
Axe back, but he was in turn
caught by Cal "wonder quarter
back" Jim Hopper.
Chinatown Chase
The Berkeley boys then headed

for Chinatown. The Axe head was
separated from the handle and
was sumggled aboard the bay
ferry. The next Monday there
was a victory rally at Cal.
Harry Dutton, a Stanford stu
dent, was there on his horse. He
offered 1o hold the Axe up so
everyone could get a better view.
He couldn't make a getaway
though. His horse shied and he
had to give up the prize.
Dutton was a perservering
young gentleman, though, so he
made another attempt. He donned
a false mustache and went to the
Chi Phi house at Cal where the
Axe was being kept. He had this
note on his person:
"Send by this fellow, the Axe
to nie this afternoon, for I want
to number it and fix the handle.
This fellow is a painter. Al Lean."
Just as Dutton had the Axe
and was about to leave, his mus
tache departed from its resting
place under his nose. He barely
escaped with his life.
The next attempt was lead by
Erb. He took a large task force
to the Chi Phi house for the at
tempt. They burst through the
door and searched the house, but
could not find it. Nine Chi Phi's
were then "thoroughly" ques
tioned but no information was
obtained.
New Plot Hatched
Will Erwin organized another
expedition to avenge the Axe on
April 24, seven days after the Axe
had been stolen. His plan was to
confiscate the Cal Senior Fence.
The seizure succeeded and
when the group returned to Stan
ford classes were called off for
the day. A rally was held. But
Cal turned spoil sports and de
flated the egoes of the Indian by
assuming a bored attitude over
the theft. They maintained that
they were planning to get rid of
the fence anyway.
As the Stanford-Cal track meet
approached and feeling was run
ning high, David Starr Jordan
made this statement, "Let no old
axe cut off our sense of dignity
and self-respect." Stanford had
no choice. The Axe was now
safely in a bank vault.
81 Year Exile
The Axe reposed away from
home for the next 31 years. Its
only exposure to the outside
world was once a year at the
rally before the Stanford-Cal
baseball game.
Moroni Jameson, a Stanford
student, actually carried the Axe
into the bank after the 1927 rally,
but he was in the midst of a
throng of Cal students and could
not make an exit.
An attempted steal was thwart
ed in 1929 when the Los Angeles

Police Dept. would not supply
tear gas bombs.
The "Immortal 21" made their
successful attempt the next year,
1930. This fabled group of gentle
men, 21 strong, satisfied 31 years
of greived Stanford feelings ten
times over.
According to a 1958 interview
with of them, Matt Lehman, a
Speech and Drama instructor at
Stanford, the plan to l'egain the
Axe was formally hatched only
two days before the event.
April First Prank
Lehman said he was ap
proached by Gerald Brettman,
"Matt, do you want to steal the
Axe?" An organizational meeting
was held Tuesday, ironically on
April 1.
It was decide to pose as
photographers and to set off a
large charge of flash powder plus
a tear gas bomb and grab the Axe
in the ensuing commotion.
Three cars left for Cal at 4:30
p.m. Thursday afternoon, April 3,
1930. One car went to the bank,
another to the Greek Theatre at
Cal where the rally was to be
held, and the other to .ioin in Ihe
parade to the theater.
Five minutes before the rally
ended one group left for the bank
to warn the "camera crew" to set
up. Art Miller was stationed at
the door of the bank with the
tear gas bomb under his over
coat.
Picture Ruse Succeeds
Within moments the armored
truck with the Axe drove into
view. Hanging onto it and riding
on the roof were six Stanford
men. The freshmen guards fell
easily for the picture ruse and
stood back for the picture. Norm
Horner, the custodian of the Axe
would not come out of the truck
at first. Finally he did and just
as he hit the ground a giant
flash of powder exploded.
Howard Avery pounced on Hor
ner from the top of the truck
and wrenched the Axe away. The
Axe head was removed from the
handle, Robert Loofbourow
tucked it under his sweater, and
calmly walked out of the crowd
just as Miller detonated his tear
gas bomb.
The mob pushed into the bank
to escape the fumes. They
thought Avery had the Axe and
they had him in their grasp.

dents to Give Em the Axe" at a rally in front of the bookstore.
The Axe, traditional symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, was one
of the few such symbols not "borrowed" by the opposing school
in recent weeks.
