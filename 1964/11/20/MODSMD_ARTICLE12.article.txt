GAIETIES will close its four night run with a performance in
Memorial Auditorium tonight at 9:30. KZSU will broadcast it live.
GUYS AND DOLLS, the "musical fable of Broadway," will end
its run at Burlingame's Hyatt House Theatre Sunday. Opening
Tuesday will be SOUTH PACIFIC with Howard Keel and Jane
Johnston in the leading roles.

Theatre in San Carlos, is a topical musical revolving around a well
known rock and roll singer. Nat King Cole's show, SIGHTS AND
SOUNDS, will begin a two-week run Tuesday.
THE WALL, Millard Lampcll's play about the Warsaw Ghetto
during World War 11, will end its run at the Marines' Theater in
San Francisco on Sunday.
FILMS
HERCULES UNCHAINED, one of the more intellectual enter
tainments of the year, will be at the flicks Sunday.
GIRL WITH THE GREEN EYES stars Rita Tushingham—who
became an overnight success with "A Taste Of Honey"—and Peter
Finch in the story of a young girl's first brush with love. THE
GREAT CHASE, a collection of snatches from several silent films,
is with it at the Paris.
.LILI, the film that made Leslie Caron a star, is at the Varsity.
With this tale of carnival life is ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS,
the true story of a girl who grows up alone on a Pacific island.
TOPKAPI stars Molina Mercouri, Maximillian Schell and Peter
Ustinov as members of a gang trying to steal a fabulous jewel-en
crusted dagger from a Turkish museum in this comedy-suspense
movie directed by Jules Dassin.
THAT MAN FROM RIO stars Jean-Paul Belmondo in a French
satire of chase-mystery movies. Billy Wilder's comedy ONE, TWO,
THREE is the co-feature at the Bijou.
THE OUTRAGE stars Paul Newman in a remake of the Jap
anese classic, "Rashomon." Set in the American west during the
late 1800's, it is at the Fine Arts along with DOCTOR IN DISTRESS.
GOODBYE CHARLIE stars Tony Curtis and Debbie Reynolds in
the story of a man whose best friend (male) is reincarnated as a
woman. Completing the bill at the Stanford is EARTH DIES
SCREAMING.
LOS TARANTOS and BLACK ORPHEUS are still at the Guild.
OTHER
HARRY BELAFONTE, along with Greek songstress Nana Mou
skouri and blues singers Sonny Terry and Brownie McGee will give
concerts tonight at the gym at USF and at Berkeley's Harmon Gym
tomorrow night.
JON HENDRICKS will continue sets at San Francisco's Basin
Street West. Hendricks opened a few weeks ago as a trio, but the
female singer, Pat Harris, was underage and booking was too hard
for most clubs. Hendricks is now having a rough time going it alone
and his opening at Tin Pan Alley in Redwood City slated for the
end of the month has been cancelled.
VINCE GUARLDI and Bola Sete opened Monday at El Matador,
where they will remain for a month. Following them will be Cal
Tjader, who is currently on an Eastern tour. The future lineup at
this club reportedly will include Joao Gilberto, Odetta and Charlie
Byrd.
The cancellation of Hendricks at Tin Pan Alley leaves a large
gap in jazz programming at the local club. December will see the
openings of Mel Tonne on the 4th and Count Basic on the 12th. The
backing group for Torme is not set but it looks very probably to
be the backing group for the soon to be disbanded Mary Kaye trio.
808 DYLAN will have three concerts in the Bay Area. He will
appear in San Jose on the 25th, at the Masonic in San Francisco on
the 27th, and will wind up at San Mateo on December Ist.
In other doings, drummer Art Blakey and his group opened this
week at the Jazz Workshop, and Jean Hoffman continues to be
nothing less than great at the Trident in Sausalito. Carlos Montoya
will appear in concert at Nourse Auditorium Big Game night and
Pearl Bailey closes her stay at the Safari Room in San Jose.
At the Tangent in Palo Alto the Driftwood Singers, a blues-folk
trio, and wandering minstrel Buddy Bohn still hold forth.
THE FREEDOM SINGERS, a group of SNCC workers who ap
peared at the Newport Folk Festival, will sing at Dinkelspiel Tues
day afternoon.
MAN: GLORY, JEST AND RIDDLE is the litle of an art show
which surveys the human form through the ages. The three major
San Francisco art museums (the Palace of the Legion of Honor, the
de Young, and the San Francisco Museum of Art) have combined
for the first time in history to present this show.

Finch in the story of a young girl's first brush with love. THE
GREAT CHASE, a collection of snatches from several silent films,

.LILI, the film that made Leslie Caron a star, is at the Varsity.

Ustinov as members of a gang trying to steal a fabulous jewel-en
crusted dagger from a Turkish museum in this comedy-suspense
movie directed by Jules Dassin.

satire of chase-mystery movies. Billy Wilder's comedy ONE, TWO,
THREE is the co-feature at the Bijou.

HARRY BELAFONTE, along with Greek songstress Nana Mou
skouri and blues singers Sonny Terry and Brownie McGee will give
concerts tonight at the gym at USF and at Berkeley's Harmon Gym
tomorrow night.
JON HENDRICKS will continue sets at San Francisco's Basin
Street West. Hendricks opened a few weeks ago as a trio, but the
female singer, Pat Harris, was underage and booking was too hard
for most clubs. Hendricks is now having a rough time going it alone
and his opening at Tin Pan Alley in Redwood City slated for the
end of the month has been cancelled.
VINCE GUARLDI and Bola Sete opened Monday at El Matador,
where they will remain for a month. Following them will be Cal
Tjader, who is currently on an Eastern tour. The future lineup at
this club reportedly will include Joao Gilberto, Odetta and Charlie
Byrd.
The cancellation of Hendricks at Tin Pan Alley leaves a large
gap in jazz programming at the local club. December will see the
openings of Mel Tonne on the 4th and Count Basic on the 12th. The
backing group for Torme is not set but it looks very probably to
be the backing group for the soon to be disbanded Mary Kaye trio.
808 DYLAN will have three concerts in the Bay Area. He will
appear in San Jose on the 25th, at the Masonic in San Francisco on
the 27th, and will wind up at San Mateo on December Ist.
In other doings, drummer Art Blakey and his group opened this
week at the Jazz Workshop, and Jean Hoffman continues to be
nothing less than great at the Trident in Sausalito. Carlos Montoya
will appear in concert at Nourse Auditorium Big Game night and
Pearl Bailey closes her stay at the Safari Room in San Jose.
At the Tangent in Palo Alto the Driftwood Singers, a blues-folk
trio, and wandering minstrel Buddy Bohn still hold forth.
THE FREEDOM SINGERS, a group of SNCC workers who ap
peared at the Newport Folk Festival, will sing at Dinkelspiel Tues
day afternoon.
MAN: GLORY, JEST AND RIDDLE is the litle of an art show
which surveys the human form through the ages. The three major
San Francisco art museums (the Palace of the Legion of Honor, the
de Young, and the San Francisco Museum of Art) have combined
for the first time in history to present this show.

JON HENDRICKS will continue sets at San Francisco's Basin
Street West. Hendricks opened a few weeks ago as a trio, but the
female singer, Pat Harris, was underage and booking was too hard
for most clubs. Hendricks is now having a rough time going it alone
and his opening at Tin Pan Alley in Redwood City slated for the
end of the month has been cancelled.
VINCE GUARLDI and Bola Sete opened Monday at El Matador,
where they will remain for a month. Following them will be Cal
Tjader, who is currently on an Eastern tour. The future lineup at
this club reportedly will include Joao Gilberto, Odetta and Charlie
Byrd.
The cancellation of Hendricks at Tin Pan Alley leaves a large
gap in jazz programming at the local club. December will see the
openings of Mel Tonne on the 4th and Count Basic on the 12th. The
backing group for Torme is not set but it looks very probably to
be the backing group for the soon to be disbanded Mary Kaye trio.
