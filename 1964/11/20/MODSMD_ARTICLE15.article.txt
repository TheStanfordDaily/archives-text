## New Theater-Restaurant A Success 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
The Bold Knight Restaurant in
Sunnyvale launched its new Din
ner Theatre on Wednesday night
with The King Dodo Playhouse's
production of "The Tunnel of
Love." It was an unqualified suc
cess from the first martini to the
last blackout.
It is only fair to mention, how
ever, that dinner is expensive and
that one is expected to make lib
eral use of the bar before, dur
ing, and after the show. This is
intended to fill the coffers of the
Bold Knight (which it does), but
also to make the audience more
fuzzy and less critical. This it
does also, but, as it turns out,
totally unnecessarily.
For the King Dodo is an ex
tremely competent, theatrically
accomplished group; and not
among the least of their achieve
ments is dealing with the prob
lems in the "dinner theatre."

Rectangular Stage
First of all, this is theatre in
the rectagular, and every bit as
exposed as theatre in the round,
perhaps even more so. No one
in the audience is more than ten
feet from the edge of the plat
form. This means that there can
be no slips in characterization, no
muffed lines, and no awkwardness
in continuity, or the audience
will register it and react unfavor
ably almost before it happens.
The actors avoid this potential
disaster with enviable aplomb,
and they bring equal finesse to
bear on the script. And it needs
it. "Tunnel of Love" is one of
those well-worn sex-in-suburbia
comedies with a lot of standard
jokes, a few topical ones (that
is, ones about sex-in-suburbia),
and only a very few really memor
able ones. The plot is absurd, be
ing about how a sociologist se
duces an emaciated cartoonist, be
comes pregnant, and writes her
doctor's thesis on the sex habits

of the suburban male animal.
It just so happens that she is,
at the time, working for the
adoption agency at the bottom
of whose list the cartoonist,
Augie, and his childless wife,
Isolde, have just been placed.
Mysteriously, they suddenly jump
to the top of it, and nine months
later are presented with a boy
who unfortunately looks exactly
like his father. Isolde immediately
becomes suspicious, finally walks
out, comes back, forgives Augie,
and discovers she is pregnant.
Sheer Talent
Somehow the King Dodo Play
ers manage to make the audience
forget that the plot is patently
ridiculous and that they've heard
the jokes before, the first by mak
ing it seem ridiculous enough to
laugh at,, and the second by sheer
talent. Jaleen Holm's Isolde is
probably the livliest of the lot.
Her buoyant enthusiasm is so
infectious that it almost carries

the entire show by itself. (She
also directed the production,
which probably is why she seems
to be in charge so often.)
J. Ivan Holm (what is this, a
monopoly or something?) shuf
fles into and shrugs off ambiva
lent Augie in that rara avis of
comedy, successful underplaying.
Clare Baker is only fair as the
sociologist, a n uncomfortable
thing amidst all that glittering
competence.
Cordon Tufts, who plays the
next door neighbor and general
man - in - and - out • of - motel •
bedrooms - with - other - women
has a marvelous good-natured leer
when he's not being a very funny
ham. Betty Jane Bennett is con
sumately dumb as his unsuspect
ing and perpetually pregnant
wife.
All in all, King Dodo and The
Bold Knight make a remarkable
combination, quite expensive, but
certainly well worth it. They are
highly recommended.

like his father. Isolde immediately
becomes suspicious, finally walks
out, comes back, forgives Augie,
and discovers she is pregnant.
Sheer Talent
Somehow the King Dodo Play
ers manage to make the audience
forget that the plot is patently
ridiculous and that they've heard
the jokes before, the first by mak
ing it seem ridiculous enough to
laugh at,, and the second by sheer
talent. Jaleen Holm's Isolde is
probably the livliest of the lot.
Her buoyant enthusiasm is so
infectious that it almost carries

the entire show by itself. (She
also directed the production,
which probably is why she seems
to be in charge so often.)
J. Ivan Holm (what is this, a
monopoly or something?) shuf
fles into and shrugs off ambiva
lent Augie in that rara avis of
comedy, successful underplaying.
Clare Baker is only fair as the
sociologist, a n uncomfortable
thing amidst all that glittering
competence.
Cordon Tufts, who plays the
next door neighbor and general
man - in - and - out • of - motel •
bedrooms - with - other - women
has a marvelous good-natured leer
when he's not being a very funny
ham. Betty Jane Bennett is con
sumately dumb as his unsuspect
ing and perpetually pregnant
wife.
All in all, King Dodo and The
Bold Knight make a remarkable
combination, quite expensive, but
certainly well worth it. They are
highly recommended.
The Bold Knight Restaurant in
Sunnyvale launched its new Din
ner Theatre on Wednesday night
with The King Dodo Playhouse's
production of "The Tunnel of
Love." It was an unqualified suc
cess from the first martini to the
last blackout.
It is only fair to mention, how
ever, that dinner is expensive and
that one is expected to make lib
eral use of the bar before, dur
ing, and after the show. This is
intended to fill the coffers of the
Bold Knight (which it does), but
also to make the audience more
fuzzy and less critical. This it
does also, but, as it turns out,
totally unnecessarily.
For the King Dodo is an ex
tremely competent, theatrically
accomplished group; and not
among the least of their achieve
ments is dealing with the prob
lems in the "dinner theatre."

Rectangular Stage
First of all, this is theatre in
the rectagular, and every bit as
exposed as theatre in the round,
perhaps even more so. No one
in the audience is more than ten
feet from the edge of the plat
form. This means that there can
be no slips in characterization, no
muffed lines, and no awkwardness
in continuity, or the audience
will register it and react unfavor
ably almost before it happens.
The actors avoid this potential
disaster with enviable aplomb,
and they bring equal finesse to
bear on the script. And it needs
it. "Tunnel of Love" is one of
those well-worn sex-in-suburbia
comedies with a lot of standard
jokes, a few topical ones (that
is, ones about sex-in-suburbia),
and only a very few really memor
able ones. The plot is absurd, be
ing about how a sociologist se
duces an emaciated cartoonist, be
comes pregnant, and writes her
doctor's thesis on the sex habits

of the suburban male animal.
It just so happens that she is,
at the time, working for the
adoption agency at the bottom
of whose list the cartoonist,
Augie, and his childless wife,
Isolde, have just been placed.
Mysteriously, they suddenly jump
to the top of it, and nine months
later are presented with a boy
who unfortunately looks exactly
like his father. Isolde immediately
becomes suspicious, finally walks
out, comes back, forgives Augie,
and discovers she is pregnant.
