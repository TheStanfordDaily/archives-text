# Stanford Seniors Heady To Perform In Their Final Contest
## 
### ROBERT THIERIOT 
This Saturday 16 Stanford sen
iors will play their final collegiate
foot ball game. In three years of i
gridiron action these men have
never seen Stanford lose to the,
foe across the Bay. Success Satur
day will provide Stanford with
its only class in the school's his
tory undefeated in games with,
the Bears.
These sixteen senior ball
players are: Bradon Beck, Jack j
Chappie, Alan Curr, Bob Howard, J
John James, Dick Leeuwenberg, j
J. D. Lodato, Robert Montgom
ery, Joe Neal. Robert Nichols,
Dick Ragsdale (co-captain), Guy'
Rounsaville (co-captain >, C a r 11
Schrader, Richard Shaw, Philip!
Wagner, and John Wilkin.
Last Wednesday at an inter- j
view the players were quiet and
reserved. Most did not want to
express their emotions or predic
tions. Braden Beck put it aptly
when he said, "We'll kick the
hell out of them. (He wanted to
be sure kick was bold-faced.)
J. I). LODATO stated, "While
Cal is faced with the unenviable
task of penetrating a now rock
hard defense studded with such
stars as 'La Chapel,' 'Tweety'
Ritchey, 'Muff' Ragsdale, andi
'Godzilla' Pettigrew, the Stanford
offense must utilize the same!
ball control that enabled them to
stifle the bowl-hungry OSU,
Beavers."
Joe Neal's vocal contribution

was: "They'll be tough, hut the
Indian shall rise to the occasion
and prevail."
John Wilkin was only able and
willing to exhale a deep-toned
typical jock statement, "Ugh."
After much stalling and stutter
ing Phil Wagner blurted out, "The
last half of the season as well
as the victory over Cal this week
end will be an indication of Stan
ford's football future."
DICK LEEUWEN BERG em
phatically said, "Big Game
everything's even. It means a lot
especially to the Seniors."
"We've beaten Cal the last three
years and plan to continue in the
same way this Saturday." This is
the way Carl Schrader felt.
The majority of the graduating
players are on defense. Co-cap
tain Dick Ragsdale was switched
from offense to safety this year.
Jack Chappie is the steady line
backer. Backing up these starters
are Alan Curr and Richard Shaw.
On the Big "D" line are such
stalwarts as Bob Nichols, co-cap
tain Guy Rounsaville, Bob How
ard, and John James. Also on the
defensive line for the goal-line de
fense is Dick Leeuwenberg. His
24pounds are quite an asset
when the dirt becomes valuable.
BRADEN BECK is in a class
of his own. Placekicking is an art
which Stanford has not always
been proficient in. But in last
year's Big Game he kicked field
goals of 48, 36, and 46 yards. If
the end zone becomes difficult to

reach, Beck will be called on to
reach the goal posts.
On the offsensive team, line
men include center Carl Schrader
and Joe Neal. Flip Wagner and
tackle John Wilkin constitute the
reserves. Robert Montgomery
will be playing offensive end. He
only became eligible game before
last.
J. D. Lodato has been switched
to offensive flanker from defen
sive secondary and is now one
of Dave Lewils' primary receivers.
Also on the Big "O's" line will be
Dick Leeuwenberg. Besides stop
ping up holes near the Stanford
goal line, he opens holes for run
ners and protects Cardinal-shirted
passers.
Every devoted Stanford rooter
has heard the name Jack Chappie
over and over again. Constantly
the public address acknowledges
the prowess, speed, and intelli
gence of this great linebacker.
DICK RAGSDALE is one of
Stanford's more versatile ball
players. When the defense was
found to be weak early this
year, Coach Ralston switched
Dick to safetyman. His consistent
heads-up play has steadied the
Red secondary. His interception
last week was the key play of
the Cards 16-7 victory.
Joe Neal has been one of the
very bright spots on the offen
sive line. Opening holes for .Ray
Handley and John Read, he has
given the Indians an excellent line
man who can be depended upon.

Schrader, Richard Shaw, Philip!
Wagner, and John Wilkin.
Last Wednesday at an inter- j
view the players were quiet and
reserved. Most did not want to
express their emotions or predic
tions. Braden Beck put it aptly
when he said, "We'll kick the
hell out of them. (He wanted to
be sure kick was bold-faced.)
J. I). LODATO stated, "While
Cal is faced with the unenviable
task of penetrating a now rock
hard defense studded with such
stars as 'La Chapel,' 'Tweety'
Ritchey, 'Muff' Ragsdale, andi
'Godzilla' Pettigrew, the Stanford
offense must utilize the same!
ball control that enabled them to
stifle the bowl-hungry OSU,
Beavers."
Joe Neal's vocal contribution

was: "They'll be tough, hut the
Indian shall rise to the occasion
and prevail."
John Wilkin was only able and
willing to exhale a deep-toned
typical jock statement, "Ugh."
After much stalling and stutter
ing Phil Wagner blurted out, "The
last half of the season as well
as the victory over Cal this week
end will be an indication of Stan
ford's football future."
DICK LEEUWEN BERG em
phatically said, "Big Game
everything's even. It means a lot
especially to the Seniors."
"We've beaten Cal the last three
years and plan to continue in the
same way this Saturday." This is
the way Carl Schrader felt.
The majority of the graduating
players are on defense. Co-cap
tain Dick Ragsdale was switched
from offense to safety this year.
Jack Chappie is the steady line
backer. Backing up these starters
are Alan Curr and Richard Shaw.
On the Big "D" line are such
stalwarts as Bob Nichols, co-cap
tain Guy Rounsaville, Bob How
ard, and John James. Also on the
defensive line for the goal-line de
fense is Dick Leeuwenberg. His
24pounds are quite an asset
when the dirt becomes valuable.
BRADEN BECK is in a class
of his own. Placekicking is an art
which Stanford has not always
been proficient in. But in last
year's Big Game he kicked field
goals of 48, 36, and 46 yards. If
the end zone becomes difficult to

reach, Beck will be called on to
reach the goal posts.
On the offsensive team, line
men include center Carl Schrader
and Joe Neal. Flip Wagner and
tackle John Wilkin constitute the
reserves. Robert Montgomery
will be playing offensive end. He
only became eligible game before
last.
J. D. Lodato has been switched
to offensive flanker from defen
sive secondary and is now one
of Dave Lewils' primary receivers.
Also on the Big "O's" line will be
Dick Leeuwenberg. Besides stop
ping up holes near the Stanford
goal line, he opens holes for run
ners and protects Cardinal-shirted
passers.
Every devoted Stanford rooter
has heard the name Jack Chappie
over and over again. Constantly
the public address acknowledges
the prowess, speed, and intelli
gence of this great linebacker.
DICK RAGSDALE is one of
Stanford's more versatile ball
players. When the defense was
found to be weak early this
year, Coach Ralston switched
Dick to safetyman. His consistent
heads-up play has steadied the
Red secondary. His interception
last week was the key play of
the Cards 16-7 victory.
Joe Neal has been one of the
very bright spots on the offen
sive line. Opening holes for .Ray
Handley and John Read, he has
given the Indians an excellent line
man who can be depended upon.
This Saturday 16 Stanford sen
iors will play their final collegiate
foot ball game. In three years of i
gridiron action these men have
never seen Stanford lose to the,
foe across the Bay. Success Satur
day will provide Stanford with
its only class in the school's his
tory undefeated in games with,
the Bears.

ball control that enabled them to
stifle the bowl-hungry OSU,
Beavers."
Joe Neal's vocal contribution

was: "They'll be tough, hut the
Indian shall rise to the occasion
and prevail."
John Wilkin was only able and
willing to exhale a deep-toned
typical jock statement, "Ugh."
After much stalling and stutter
ing Phil Wagner blurted out, "The
last half of the season as well
as the victory over Cal this week
end will be an indication of Stan
ford's football future."
DICK LEEUWEN BERG em
phatically said, "Big Game
everything's even. It means a lot
especially to the Seniors."
"We've beaten Cal the last three
years and plan to continue in the
same way this Saturday." This is
the way Carl Schrader felt.
The majority of the graduating
players are on defense. Co-cap
tain Dick Ragsdale was switched
from offense to safety this year.
Jack Chappie is the steady line
backer. Backing up these starters
are Alan Curr and Richard Shaw.
On the Big "D" line are such
stalwarts as Bob Nichols, co-cap
tain Guy Rounsaville, Bob How
ard, and John James. Also on the
defensive line for the goal-line de
fense is Dick Leeuwenberg. His
24pounds are quite an asset
when the dirt becomes valuable.
BRADEN BECK is in a class
of his own. Placekicking is an art
which Stanford has not always
been proficient in. But in last
year's Big Game he kicked field
goals of 48, 36, and 46 yards. If
the end zone becomes difficult to

reach, Beck will be called on to
reach the goal posts.
On the offsensive team, line
men include center Carl Schrader
and Joe Neal. Flip Wagner and
tackle John Wilkin constitute the
reserves. Robert Montgomery
will be playing offensive end. He
only became eligible game before
last.
J. D. Lodato has been switched
to offensive flanker from defen
sive secondary and is now one
of Dave Lewils' primary receivers.
Also on the Big "O's" line will be
Dick Leeuwenberg. Besides stop
ping up holes near the Stanford
goal line, he opens holes for run
ners and protects Cardinal-shirted
passers.
Every devoted Stanford rooter
has heard the name Jack Chappie
over and over again. Constantly
the public address acknowledges
the prowess, speed, and intelli
gence of this great linebacker.
DICK RAGSDALE is one of
Stanford's more versatile ball
players. When the defense was
found to be weak early this
year, Coach Ralston switched
Dick to safetyman. His consistent
heads-up play has steadied the
Red secondary. His interception
last week was the key play of
the Cards 16-7 victory.
Joe Neal has been one of the
very bright spots on the offen
sive line. Opening holes for .Ray
Handley and John Read, he has
given the Indians an excellent line
man who can be depended upon.
