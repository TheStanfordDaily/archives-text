Many things will he riding on
the outcome of tomorrow's Big
Game football clash. Besides de
ciding who has the better foot
ball team, it will determine who i
will retain the edge in the 66 i
game classic now deadlocked at
28 games apiece. Ten games have
ended in deadlocks.
With Stanford winning the last '
three Big Games 20-7, 30-13, and
28-17, the outcome will also de- j
cide if Stanford will set a new
Indian record for the most Big
Games won in a row, four. Stan
ford went seven games, 1924-
1934, without a loss but a tie in
terrupted the string of victories
in 1928 at three. Cal's record is
five straight victories in 1919-
1923.
FINALLY, tomorrow's game
will decide which coach, Ralston
or Willsey, will be able to claim
unblemished Big Game records,
both as coaches and players. Will
sey played in two Cal victories
and Ralston played in a 7-7 tie.
Let us review these 66 contests
where upsets have come to be the
rule rather than the exception.
The first Big Game was initiat
ed in 1892 with eleven Stanford
stalwarts playing the entire game
and defeating the Bears 14-10. It
took six more games before the
Bears could muster up enough
strength to defeat the mighty
Cards, although they tied three.
After two pairs of Cal victories,
interrupted by a Card win in
1900, the Indians went six more
years undefeated, though three
ol these games were rugby con
tests.
THEN CAME three California
victories, three Stanford victories,
and a return to American style
football in 1919. The years that
followed were dark for Stanford
football fans with Cal's Andy
Smith's great Wonder team win
ning four straight.
In 1924, however, Pop Warner's
first Stanford team tied Cal 20-
20 and began a reign of Stanford
football supremacy that lasted 12
years with the Cards absorbing
only one defeat in 1931. 6-0. These

year's saw many donnybrooks
highlighted by Ernie Never's
running and a 41-0 Stanford vic
tory iti 1930 in which the Indians
pounded out 490 yards.
But as the records show a
string of Big Game victories
usually brings a string of losses
and the Cards went under the
next four years.
In 1947 the greatest upset in
the 72-year classic was narrowly
avoided by tho scrappy Bears.
TIIK BKARS were 8-1 that year
and Stanford hadn't won a game
all season. With only three min

utes remaining, however, the
Tribe went ahead 18-14 and had
Iho ball on the Cal 21. Tho Bears
held and Cal's Jackie Jensen
threw a 15 yard pass that went
for the winning touchdown. The
Bears won 21-18.
Dick Norman almost single
larmedly defeated the Bears in
i 1959. Norman passed for 401
'yards and completed 34 out of 39
j passes. Al the end of the half
Stanford was on the Bear six with
I the clock running out. As the gun
j sounded the Indian were on the
I Bear 4 but Cal won 20-17.

Stanford was on the Bear six with

Many things will he riding on
the outcome of tomorrow's Big
Game football clash. Besides de
ciding who has the better foot
ball team, it will determine who i
will retain the edge in the 66 i
game classic now deadlocked at
28 games apiece. Ten games have
ended in deadlocks.
With Stanford winning the last '
three Big Games 20-7, 30-13, and
28-17, the outcome will also de- j
cide if Stanford will set a new
Indian record for the most Big
Games won in a row, four. Stan
ford went seven games, 1924-
1934, without a loss but a tie in
terrupted the string of victories
in 1928 at three. Cal's record is
five straight victories in 1919-
1923.
FINALLY, tomorrow's game
will decide which coach, Ralston
or Willsey, will be able to claim
unblemished Big Game records,
both as coaches and players. Will
sey played in two Cal victories
and Ralston played in a 7-7 tie.
Let us review these 66 contests
where upsets have come to be the
rule rather than the exception.
The first Big Game was initiat
ed in 1892 with eleven Stanford
stalwarts playing the entire game
and defeating the Bears 14-10. It
took six more games before the
Bears could muster up enough
strength to defeat the mighty
Cards, although they tied three.
After two pairs of Cal victories,
interrupted by a Card win in
1900, the Indians went six more
years undefeated, though three
ol these games were rugby con
tests.
THEN CAME three California
victories, three Stanford victories,
and a return to American style
football in 1919. The years that
followed were dark for Stanford
football fans with Cal's Andy
Smith's great Wonder team win
ning four straight.
In 1924, however, Pop Warner's
first Stanford team tied Cal 20-
20 and began a reign of Stanford
football supremacy that lasted 12
years with the Cards absorbing
only one defeat in 1931. 6-0. These

year's saw many donnybrooks
highlighted by Ernie Never's
running and a 41-0 Stanford vic
tory iti 1930 in which the Indians
pounded out 490 yards.
But as the records show a
string of Big Game victories
usually brings a string of losses
and the Cards went under the
next four years.
In 1947 the greatest upset in
the 72-year classic was narrowly
avoided by tho scrappy Bears.
TIIK BKARS were 8-1 that year
and Stanford hadn't won a game
all season. With only three min

utes remaining, however, the
Tribe went ahead 18-14 and had
Iho ball on the Cal 21. Tho Bears
held and Cal's Jackie Jensen
threw a 15 yard pass that went
for the winning touchdown. The
Bears won 21-18.
Dick Norman almost single
larmedly defeated the Bears in
i 1959. Norman passed for 401
'yards and completed 34 out of 39
j passes. Al the end of the half
Stanford was on the Bear six with
I the clock running out. As the gun
