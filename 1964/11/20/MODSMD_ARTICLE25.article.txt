# Kartozian: Yell Leading By Cigar
## 
### SHERRY ROSEN 
Big Game, as everyone knows,
is the prime occasion for Stanford
students to let off steam and
show their spirit. Spirit at the
game itself naturally entails a
cheerleader, and thought of cheer
leaders bring us to the most fa
mous and perhaps the most spirit
ed (in his own way) cheerleader
Stanford has had: the inimitable
Kartozian.
"Kartozian For Everything"
was the admitted objective of one
of the most colorful politicians in

Stanford's history. But although ,
Bill Kartozian managed only to i
become head yell leader, his
unique campaign of 1959 as well !
as his distinctive cheerleading
style will be remembered long
after his fans have all left the I
Farm.
As Kartozian himself explains, ii
all began in the living room of a j
fraternity house when he casually ;
commented that "if the govern-1
ment of the Associated Students
were run like a dictatorship, we j
could really get results." By the J
next morning, his self-appointed
campaign manager Bill Pereira
had entered Kartozian as a write- i
in candidate for every ASSU j
office from President to business i
manager.
RISING to the challenge that j
"Kartozian is More Than a Man:
He fs An Ideal," the new candi
date soon created a suitable pub
lic image via an overcoat, straw
hat, dark glasses, and cigar.
His alleged qualifications fori
the primary elections included!
Con Home Queen, and his "revo- j
3-point fuzzy plan" call-1
ed for: 1 > Natural childbirth as a •
pre-requisite for office, 2) stu-1
dent government to he a dictator-1
ship of the Dreepspeels, and 3) ;
morning showers only.
LIKE ANY good politician, he
also made his share of promises: I
"Kartozian promises to pin every |
girl who votes for him;" "Kar-!

tozian says off-campus living is
great; if elected, Kartozian prom
ises to move Stanford off cam
pus;" "Kartozian promises 21
year-old girls for fraternity house
mot hers."
The night after the primary
elections were held, Kartozian was j
called before a meeting of the
student legislature. Unprecedent
ed developments had taken place
he had been voted into the finals i
for ten offices, including presi
dent, off-campus representative,
Stern Ilall representative, Men's I
Council, and Women's Council.
Unfortunately, he was disquali i
fied for the office of Women's
Recreation Association President. I
The panic-stricken Legislature
decided to allow Kartozian to run i
only for the office of yell leader,
and thus the Kartozian Ideal was!
modified to "Kartozian for Every
one."
HIS CAMPAIGN was based on
jthe theory that ii isn't necessary
! for a yell leader to be a marion
! ette. His philosophy called for a
j departure from"the stereotyped |
picture of yell leaders who can
| twirl their arms in a complete!
i circle and jump 6 feet off the!
ground." Indeed, his own style
consisted of no more effort than |
i merely lifting a finger when a j
I yell was to be led.
I It was a landslide victory, with !
| Kartozian elected as Stanford's i
i 1959 "head pompon boy" by a ;

better than 2-1 margin.
True to his word, Kartozian as
head yell leader stuck to his
philosophy of under-cxertion. A
Daily editorial from the fall of
1959, discussing complaints from
alumni who didn't care for Kar
tozian as compared with the usual
Bermudas-and-white-sweater type
of cheerleader, c o m m en t e d :
"These persons should realize that
it's not the golden age of red-hot
ism at Stanford any more."
KARTOZIAN ended his career
in Berkeley at the Big Game,
where even his 8,01)0 devoted fans
could not cheer Stanford to vic
tory. But the many later com
ments on the "tremendous Big
Game spirit" indicated that the
Kartozian Creed was still very
much alive.
"Kartozian has more ability in
terms of real yell loading ability
and controlling the rooters than
any yell leader we have had in

years."
Graduation and Harvard Law
School were next for the San
Franeiseo-born Kartozian, but his
(Stanford career was not yet over.
In November °112 1960, the Rally
Committee imported Kartozian to
act as emcee at the Bijj; Came bon
fire and rally. Student donations
paid for his round-trip flight from
j Harvard, and the returning hero
was welcomed at the airport by
the Rally Committee and his
many friends.
IF His <;<>ALS have been ac
complished, Bill Kartozian has re
turned West from Harvard and
today is practicing law in San
1 Francisco. Perhaps lie will be in
'the stands at Berkeley this Sat
urday, but as one loyal fan wist
fully noted after his final Big
Game triumph in 1959, '"It was
great ihis year because of Kar
tozian, but there will never be
another Kartozian."

Game triumph in 1959, '"It was
great ihis year because of Kar
tozian, but there will never be
another Kartozian."
Big Game, as everyone knows,
is the prime occasion for Stanford
students to let off steam and
show their spirit. Spirit at the
game itself naturally entails a
cheerleader, and thought of cheer
leaders bring us to the most fa
mous and perhaps the most spirit
ed (in his own way) cheerleader
Stanford has had: the inimitable
Kartozian.
"Kartozian For Everything"
was the admitted objective of one
of the most colorful politicians in

Stanford's history. But although ,
Bill Kartozian managed only to i
become head yell leader, his
unique campaign of 1959 as well !
as his distinctive cheerleading
style will be remembered long
after his fans have all left the I
Farm.
As Kartozian himself explains, ii
all began in the living room of a j
fraternity house when he casually ;
commented that "if the govern-1
ment of the Associated Students
were run like a dictatorship, we j
could really get results." By the J
next morning, his self-appointed
campaign manager Bill Pereira
had entered Kartozian as a write- i
in candidate for every ASSU j
office from President to business i
manager.
RISING to the challenge that j
"Kartozian is More Than a Man:
He fs An Ideal," the new candi
date soon created a suitable pub
lic image via an overcoat, straw
hat, dark glasses, and cigar.
His alleged qualifications fori
the primary elections included!
Con Home Queen, and his "revo- j
3-point fuzzy plan" call-1
ed for: 1 > Natural childbirth as a •
pre-requisite for office, 2) stu-1
dent government to he a dictator-1
ship of the Dreepspeels, and 3) ;
morning showers only.
LIKE ANY good politician, he
also made his share of promises: I
"Kartozian promises to pin every |
girl who votes for him;" "Kar-!

tozian says off-campus living is
great; if elected, Kartozian prom
ises to move Stanford off cam
pus;" "Kartozian promises 21
year-old girls for fraternity house
mot hers."
The night after the primary
elections were held, Kartozian was j
called before a meeting of the
student legislature. Unprecedent
ed developments had taken place
he had been voted into the finals i
for ten offices, including presi
dent, off-campus representative,
Stern Ilall representative, Men's I
Council, and Women's Council.
Unfortunately, he was disquali i
fied for the office of Women's
Recreation Association President. I
The panic-stricken Legislature
decided to allow Kartozian to run i
only for the office of yell leader,
and thus the Kartozian Ideal was!
modified to "Kartozian for Every
one."
HIS CAMPAIGN was based on
jthe theory that ii isn't necessary
! for a yell leader to be a marion
! ette. His philosophy called for a
j departure from"the stereotyped |
picture of yell leaders who can
| twirl their arms in a complete!
i circle and jump 6 feet off the!
ground." Indeed, his own style
consisted of no more effort than |
i merely lifting a finger when a j
I yell was to be led.
I It was a landslide victory, with !
| Kartozian elected as Stanford's i
i 1959 "head pompon boy" by a ;

better than 2-1 margin.
True to his word, Kartozian as
head yell leader stuck to his
philosophy of under-cxertion. A
Daily editorial from the fall of
1959, discussing complaints from
alumni who didn't care for Kar
tozian as compared with the usual
Bermudas-and-white-sweater type
of cheerleader, c o m m en t e d :
"These persons should realize that
it's not the golden age of red-hot
ism at Stanford any more."
KARTOZIAN ended his career
in Berkeley at the Big Game,
where even his 8,01)0 devoted fans
could not cheer Stanford to vic
tory. But the many later com
ments on the "tremendous Big
Game spirit" indicated that the
Kartozian Creed was still very
much alive.
"Kartozian has more ability in
terms of real yell loading ability
and controlling the rooters than
any yell leader we have had in

years."
Graduation and Harvard Law
School were next for the San
Franeiseo-born Kartozian, but his
(Stanford career was not yet over.
In November °112 1960, the Rally
Committee imported Kartozian to
act as emcee at the Bijj; Came bon
fire and rally. Student donations
paid for his round-trip flight from
j Harvard, and the returning hero
was welcomed at the airport by
the Rally Committee and his
many friends.
IF His <;<>ALS have been ac
complished, Bill Kartozian has re
turned West from Harvard and
today is practicing law in San
1 Francisco. Perhaps lie will be in
'the stands at Berkeley this Sat
urday, but as one loyal fan wist

1 Francisco. Perhaps lie will be in
'the stands at Berkeley this Sat
urday, but as one loyal fan wist
fully noted after his final Big
Game triumph in 1959, '"It was
great ihis year because of Kar
tozian, but there will never be
another Kartozian."
Big Game, as everyone knows,
is the prime occasion for Stanford
students to let off steam and
show their spirit. Spirit at the
game itself naturally entails a
cheerleader, and thought of cheer
leaders bring us to the most fa
mous and perhaps the most spirit
ed (in his own way) cheerleader
Stanford has had: the inimitable
Kartozian.
"Kartozian For Everything"
was the admitted objective of one
of the most colorful politicians in

Stanford's history. But although ,
Bill Kartozian managed only to i
become head yell leader, his
unique campaign of 1959 as well !
as his distinctive cheerleading
style will be remembered long
after his fans have all left the I
Farm.
As Kartozian himself explains, ii
all began in the living room of a j
fraternity house when he casually ;
commented that "if the govern-1
ment of the Associated Students
were run like a dictatorship, we j
could really get results." By the J
next morning, his self-appointed
campaign manager Bill Pereira
had entered Kartozian as a write- i
in candidate for every ASSU j
office from President to business i
manager.
RISING to the challenge that j
"Kartozian is More Than a Man:
He fs An Ideal," the new candi
date soon created a suitable pub
lic image via an overcoat, straw
hat, dark glasses, and cigar.
His alleged qualifications fori
the primary elections included!
Con Home Queen, and his "revo- j
3-point fuzzy plan" call-1
ed for: 1 > Natural childbirth as a •
pre-requisite for office, 2) stu-1
dent government to he a dictator-1
ship of the Dreepspeels, and 3) ;
morning showers only.
LIKE ANY good politician, he
also made his share of promises: I
"Kartozian promises to pin every |
girl who votes for him;" "Kar-!

tozian says off-campus living is
great; if elected, Kartozian prom
ises to move Stanford off cam
pus;" "Kartozian promises 21
year-old girls for fraternity house
mot hers."
The night after the primary
elections were held, Kartozian was j
called before a meeting of the
student legislature. Unprecedent
ed developments had taken place
he had been voted into the finals i
for ten offices, including presi
dent, off-campus representative,
Stern Ilall representative, Men's I
Council, and Women's Council.
Unfortunately, he was disquali i
fied for the office of Women's
Recreation Association President. I
The panic-stricken Legislature
decided to allow Kartozian to run i
only for the office of yell leader,
and thus the Kartozian Ideal was!
modified to "Kartozian for Every
one."
HIS CAMPAIGN was based on
jthe theory that ii isn't necessary
! for a yell leader to be a marion
! ette. His philosophy called for a
j departure from"the stereotyped |
picture of yell leaders who can
| twirl their arms in a complete!
i circle and jump 6 feet off the!
ground." Indeed, his own style
consisted of no more effort than |
i merely lifting a finger when a j
I yell was to be led.
I It was a landslide victory, with !
| Kartozian elected as Stanford's i
i 1959 "head pompon boy" by a ;

better than 2-1 margin.
True to his word, Kartozian as
head yell leader stuck to his
philosophy of under-cxertion. A
Daily editorial from the fall of
1959, discussing complaints from
alumni who didn't care for Kar
tozian as compared with the usual
Bermudas-and-white-sweater type
of cheerleader, c o m m en t e d :
"These persons should realize that
it's not the golden age of red-hot
ism at Stanford any more."
KARTOZIAN ended his career
in Berkeley at the Big Game,
where even his 8,01)0 devoted fans
could not cheer Stanford to vic
tory. But the many later com
ments on the "tremendous Big
Game spirit" indicated that the
Kartozian Creed was still very
much alive.
"Kartozian has more ability in
terms of real yell loading ability
and controlling the rooters than
any yell leader we have had in

years."
Graduation and Harvard Law
School were next for the San
Franeiseo-born Kartozian, but his
(Stanford career was not yet over.
In November °112 1960, the Rally
Committee imported Kartozian to
act as emcee at the Bijj; Came bon
fire and rally. Student donations
paid for his round-trip flight from
j Harvard, and the returning hero
was welcomed at the airport by
the Rally Committee and his
many friends.
IF His <;<>ALS have been ac
complished, Bill Kartozian has re
turned West from Harvard and
today is practicing law in San
1 Francisco. Perhaps lie will be in
'the stands at Berkeley this Sat
urday, but as one loyal fan wist
