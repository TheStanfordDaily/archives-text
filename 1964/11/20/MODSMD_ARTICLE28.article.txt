# Thank You, Mr. Storke
## 
### 
The new Storke Student Publications Btiild
iiiti; will be formally dedicated this afternoon,
ending at long last an era of hopelessness border
illon desperation for student publications.
The .S3(HU)(K) building, housing the Quad,
the Chaparral, the Set/uoia, and The Daily, as
well as a newlv-created Publications Hoard
office, is perhaps the finest student publications
plant in the nation, and the first whose operation
and improvement is the responsibility' solely ol
student organizations.
Heplacing a 30-year-old shack for The Daily,
even worse facilities for the (,haul and the
Chaparral, and no facilities whatsoever for the
Sequoia, the Storke Building is already having
its bent lici.il effects in the form of larger and
more active staffs.
The bright, refreshing atmosphere ol the
new structure, present editors hope, will give
new lile to organizations which in the past sev
eral years have been in desperate straits with
regard to finances, staff shortages and morale,
and, as a result, quality.

For the first time in Stanford history the
publications, traditionally divided by an almost
bitter rivalry, are cooperating in projects that
will minimize some of the long-standing limita
tions on the service and entertainment they can
provide on campus.
In short, the Storke Student Publications
Building represents a vast improvement for Stan
ford and holds great promise for bringing about
sorely-needed improvements in the quality and
sophistication ol the publications. I lie student
body at large can only benefit from such a de
velopment.
It is most fitting, therefore, that we, on behalf
of the student publications and the student body,
thank those administrators and student leaders
who have helped bring the dream of a student
publications building to fruition.
Most important, we want to express our sin
cerc appreciation and ch eply-felt gratitude to
Mr. Thomas M. Storke, without whose gener
osity, combined with an appreciation of the need
for an ever-improving American journalism, this
fine building would not have been possible.
