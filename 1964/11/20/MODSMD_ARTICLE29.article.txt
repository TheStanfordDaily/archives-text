## Stanford's Social Regulations Foster Duplicity, Not Morality 
### 
Pear Sir:
Misses Evans and Lowe have
taken a stand on the Social Regu
lations that is as responsible and
coherent as it was bold and ir
regular.
Though neither love nor moral
ity can i>e legislated, there are
certain codes which can encour
age what is right and profitable
for the individual within a state.
But the existing social regulations
foster duplicity in students and
administration. This circumstance
confounds any individual who is
trying to establish that personal
code of ethics which will carry
him beyond the Farm into a cul
ture already handicapped by ram
pant "self-alienation."
The duplicity which generates
and symptomizes local morality
reflects itself in a multitude of
ways. Rig Game overnights are
carefully chaperoned, but fresh
man women are cautioned against
falling off guard. Stanford women
may stay, in groups of two or
more, in a motel room; but the
university requires written pa
rental permission for them to
spend weekends in their own
homes. Considerate Stanford po
lice wait until 2:30 to flash lights
into parked cars. Most despicable
is the tendency to indulge in hy
pocritical disparagement of "pro
miscuity." YV h y encourage a
double standard to exist between
sexes, among dormitory mates, or
in one's own psychic activity?
Though the current curfew has
practical advantages, they seri
ously obscure its ethical disadvan
tages. Conveniently, 2:30 can save
a girl from "touchy" situations.
But what do the well-rehearsed
intellects of Stanford women pre
scribe during summers, quarter
breaks, mornings, and after
noons? Wouldn't it he wiser for
Stanford to assist its proteges to
participate in the real human
world as well as (he academic
one? Active minds need to exer
cise their potential to act with
integrity and dignity in the most
embarassing as well as the most
sophisticated situation.

• Militancy Endorsed
Dear Sir:
The editorial on the free speech
petition is a clear example of the
still prevalent tendency to asso
ciate a cause with those who sup
port it. Since the McCarthy era,
most responsible people have re
jected the idea of guilt by asso
ciation. but, unfortunately, as this
editorial illustrates, the practice
continues. According to the edi
torial, if free speech is supported
by the FSM. Stanford students
should be quite wary about com
mitting themselves in print to
supporting free speech. The ab
surdity of this position is matched
only by the fact that it is contra
dicted in the editorial itself.
I would also like to question
the description of the Free Speech
Movement as rabble rousing and
irresponsible. It seems to mo
that the leaders have been inter
ested from the very beginning
only in removing restrictions on
free speech and political activity.
They agreed to discontinue
demonstrations after the pact of
October 2 which was supposed to
provide channels for negotiation
with the administration. It was
only after the administration
showed repeatedly that it was
not interested in negotiating in
good faith that the students once
again set up tables to solicit mem
bers and funds. The change in
tactics was a result of the fu
tility of the negotiations. This
can be labeled rabble rousing
only by those who do not recog
nize tin l utter helplessness of stu
dents confronting a university
administration. Students have
very few rights and no power. The
tables were set up to pressure
the administration to recognize
the rights of students. This ac
tion was necessary because the
administration, alas, is not going
to change its mind without pres
sure. This is what is known as
"militant tactics" and I contend
that these tactics arc necessary
(and need not be called rabble
rousing) if the student movement
is to survive.

• Miss. Project Praised
Dear Sir:
; It is difficult for me to estab
lish how violently I disagree with
the recent letters expressing op
postion to the Mississippi Proj
ect. It is especially disheartening
to discover that so many students
share a suspicion that " the in
vaders" are doing more harm
than good. The truth seems to
me to be quite different. I believe
j that the Mississippi Project is the
| most important force for peace-
I ful integration now at work in
| the South — including the Jus-
It ice Department.
The critics are quite right, of
course, in saying that social
! change must run deeper than a
| mere expression of law, that it
: must be founded upon a change
in the hearts and minds of white
j Southerners. The hearts and
I minds of my fellow-Southerners
'are not likely to be changed by
j troops and marshals; these, to
j them, are expressions of a politic
jal will, darkly motivated. What
|is likely to bring change is a
| white idealism that challenges
j notions they have never thought
j to question.
As one who grew up in North
Florida (whose spirit derives
more from South Georgia than
! from the Miami-type Florida of
j gaudy stereotype), I have a vivid
memory of the time when, in my
early teens, it occurred 1o me to
question the comfortable assump
tions of white supremacy. I lived
in a university city, where the
social dialogue has always been
much broader than it is elsewhere
in the South. In Darkest Missis
-1 sippi, the dialogue is as narrow
as a knife edge. Mississippians
i need the wider view of the world
that the project brings them.
Some Southerns, of course.
! keep their minds closed by ascrib
ing Communist stimulation to
j the Mississippi Project. A good
i many others, though, are now in
j a pivotal position: In their hearts,
; they no longer know what's
! light.
Sincerely,
