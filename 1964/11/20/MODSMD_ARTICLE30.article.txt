# One Year After: JFK's Legacy
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
| No one likes to recall this Friday last year.
That day our preoccupation with the Big (lame was suddenly
shattered by the unbelieving voices of television commentators, the
; pathetic "Let Us Pray" signs and then the silence. John F. Kennedy
was dead.
As the newsmen hurried off to collect the reassurances of our
beleaguered ex-Presidents, a student walking through the Harvard
I Yard, stopped and hit his fist against a tree, again and again.
Why? Why did this act so aptly demonstrate the rage, the grief,
the frustration of students everywhere that day?
Because John Kennedy was one of us. Because, regardless of
I political ideology, each of us empathized with him.
j He was intelligent, yet he avidly sought more knowledge. He
I had that "certain grace" which we call style. He had courage if
! his back hurl il was none of our damn business. Above all, he had
hope the hallmark of youth.
Because hopeful students tend to be impatient, we seldom for
gave him his patience. The plight of the Negro, the poor and the
aged called for instant action, yet the man in the White House
I realized swift, sure defeat would gain nothing. So he waited for
j the right moment, and we mutiered to ourselves.
Where we were idealistic, he was pragmatic pragmatic enough
Ito understand the value of our idealism. He urged us to join tiie
i Peace Corps, to take a 50-mile hike, to become politicians.
He recruited intellectuals for government posts, yet he insisted
I upon a personal grasp of their work. Waller Heller, Kennedy's eco
i nomie adviser, lells how the President quietly learned the intricacies
of economics. During his three years, the President read 100 to 500
technical memoranda, documents and books on specific issues Hiai
i Heller sent him. "I was working myself out of a job," Heller said
| recently.
It was this dedication to enlightenment, this confidence in knowl
edge that gave Kennedy his appeal to youth. He believed, like
jAlfted North Whitehead, that "the fact that reason too often fails
j does not give fair grounds to the hysterical conclusion thai it never
; works."
Thus, he kepi reasoning with us, and for that he was killed by
la man who abh<ir,el re 1 son. He acknowledged the complevilies of
j the world, and those with simple solutions despised him.
i John F. Kennedy was first and last a politician. He died on a
j political foray. II is because he was both an intellectual and a politi
! cian and thought the combination a good one thai we ivprini Ihe
