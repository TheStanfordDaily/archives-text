# JFK On Intellectuals And Polities

### 
1 Every American is now involved in the world. "The tragic events
!of . . . turmoil through which we have just passed have made us
| citizens of the world." said Woodrow Wilson. For a time we tried
to dodge this new responsibiltiy, but the world depression, World
War 11, and the Cold War have finally conveyed his message: "There
can be no turning back Our own fortunes as a nation are involved
whether we would have it so or not."
In our concern for the future of America, we dare nut neglect the
education of its politicians.
I realize that most Americans are not concerned about the educa
tion of politicians. No education is considered necessary for political
I success, except how to find your way around a smoke-filled room.
I Those of you who are graduating this spring are urged to follow am
i number of other careers. But few, if any. will urge you to become
i politicians.
I Successful politicians, according to Walter Lippmann, are "in
j secure and intimidated men," who "advance politically only as they
! placate, appease, bribe, seduce, bamboozle, or otherwise manage to
I manipulate" the views and votes of the people who elect them. Years
i ago the humorist Artemus Ward declared: "I am not a politician,
I and my other habits are good also."
Politics, i;i short, has become one of our most neglected, our most
j abused, and our most ignored professions. Unfortunately, this dis
dain for the political profession is not only shared but intensified in
our academic institutions. For both teachers and students find it
j difficult to accept the differences between the laboratory and the
j legislature. In the former, the goal is truth, pure and simple, with
! out regard to changing currents of public opinion; in the latter, com
promises and majorities and procedural customs and rights affect
the ultimate decision as to what is right or just or good.
And when they realize the difference, most intellectuals consider
; their chief function to be that of the critic and many politicians are
sensitive to critics (possibly because we have so many of them).
The 'Defensive' Intellectual
i Of course, the intellectual's attitude is partly defensive â€” for he
has been regarded with so much suspicion and hostility by political
figures and their constitutents that a recent survey of American
intellectuals by a national magazine elicited from one of our fore
most literary figures the guarded response. '"I ain't no intellectual."
And so the worlds of practical politics and academic scholarship
have drifted apart.
But this mutual suspicion was not always the case- and I would
ask those of you who look wilh disdain and disfavor upon the pos
sibilities of a political career to remember that our nation's first
great politicians were traditionally our ablest, most respected, most
talented leaders, men who moved from one field to another with
amazing versatility and vitality. A contemporary described Thomas
Jefferson as "a gentleman of 32, who could calculate an eclipse, sur
vey an estate, tie an artery, plan an edifice, try a cause, break a
horse, dance a minuet, and play the violin."
John Quiney Adams, after being summarily dismissed from the
Senate for a notable display of independence, could become Boyls
ton Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory at Harvard and then become
a great Secretary of State. (Those were the happy days when Har
vard professors had no difficulty getting Senate confirmation.)
j Daniel Webster could throw thunderbolts at Haync on the Senate
j floor and then stroll a few steps down the corridor and dominate the
Supreme Court as the foremost lawyer of his time.
The Politician And The Scholar
I
This link between American scholarship and the American politi
cian remained for more than a century. A little more than one hun
dred years ago, in the Presidential campaign of 1856, the Republicans
sent three brilliant orators around the campaign circuit: William
Cullcn Bryant. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and Ralph Waldo
Emerson. (In those times, apparently, the "eggheads" were all Re
publicans.)
It is clear, in any event, that these were men of talent that in
former times, our foremost scholars were interested in becoming our
foremost politicians.
I would urge therefore that each of you, regardless of your chosen
occupation, consider entering the field of politics at some stage in
your career. It is not necessary that you Ik 1 famous, that you effect
radical changes in the government or that you are acclaimed by the
I public for your efforts. It is not even necessary that you be suecess-
I ful.
I ask only that you offer to the political arena, and to the critical
! problems of our society which are decided therein, the benefit of the
j talents which society has helped to develop in you. I ask you to dc
i cide, as Goethe put it, whether you will be an anvil or a hammer.
|The formal phases of the "an\il" stage are now completed for many
of you. though hopefully you will continue to absorb still more in
| the years ahead. The question now is whether you are to be a ham
j mer whether you are to give the world in which you were reared
'and educated the broadest benefits of that education.
Discussion 1* Not Enough
It is not enough to lend your talents to merely discussing the
' issues and deploring their solutions.
The duty of the scholar particularly in a republic such as ours
is to contribute his objective views and his sense of liberty to the
| affairs of his state and nation.
If you are to be among the rulers of our land, from precinct cap
! tain to President, if you are willing to enter the abused and neglected
: profession of politics, then let me tell you that we stand in serious
I need of the fruits of your education. We do not need political scholars
'whose education has been so specialized as to exclude them from
participation in current events. What we need are men who can ride
easily broad fields of knowledge and recognize the mutual depend
ence of the two worlds of politics and scholarship.
We want from you not the sneers of the cynics nor the despair
of the fainthearted. We ask of you enlightenment, vision, illumina
