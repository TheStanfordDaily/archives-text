### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
The multitudes assemble (78,-
0001 tomorrow in Berkeley at
1:30 lo watch the luckless wonders
of Stanford and California play
I lie HTth Big Game. Between Ihe
two teams I his year, they have
lost a total of nine games by a
touchdown margin or less.
Both Gal's Ray Willsey and
Stanford's John Ralston, who
were optimistic at the season's
start, have seen their hopes
smashed by costly and careless
mistakes.
The hue ol Big Game is mag
nified by the closeness of Ihe
series. After 00 years of gridiron
struggle, the ledger 1 is all even,
each team having won 2S games,
with 10 contests ending in ties.
There have been outstanding up
s< is, several moral victories, very
few routs. The Indians put a
three year winning streak on the
line this year.
TIIF BFAKS' record is 3-0 and
ihe Indians' a not much belter
i But even if Ihe Indians or
Ihe Bears had won all their
games, past records and past
statistics must be looked at with
a grain of salt, and the game's
outlook would have to be the
same: a tossup.
Though the records he similar,
the methods of the Indians and
the Bears arc not. It the winner
is decided by the type of offense
rmployed, Stanford it by land.
Gal if by air. Stanford has gained
1 Tf'tj yards on I lie ground this
year and Jis I •• uds through the
airways. On the other extreme,
Gal ha- man: f ;e I n!y 7XI yards
in the ground while amassing
1934 yards passing to place itself
last .md first respectively in the
i (inference standings.
