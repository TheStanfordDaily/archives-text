# Bears Favored To Break Stanford Winning Streak
## Cal Seeks First Win Since '60 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
The multitudes assemble (78,-
0001 tomorrow in Berkeley at
1:30 lo watch the luckless wonders
of Stanford and California play
I lie HTth Big Game. Between Ihe
two teams I his year, they have
lost a total of nine games by a
touchdown margin or less.
Both Gal's Ray Willsey and
Stanford's John Ralston, who
were optimistic at the season's
start, have seen their hopes
smashed by costly and careless
mistakes.
The hue ol Big Game is mag
nified by the closeness of Ihe
series. After 00 years of gridiron
struggle, the ledger 1 is all even,
each team having won 2S games,
with 10 contests ending in ties.
There have been outstanding up
s< is, several moral victories, very
few routs. The Indians put a
three year winning streak on the
line this year.
TIIF BFAKS' record is 3-0 and
ihe Indians' a not much belter
i But even if Ihe Indians or
Ihe Bears had won all their
games, past records and past
statistics must be looked at with
a grain of salt, and the game's
outlook would have to be the
same: a tossup.
Though the records he similar,
the methods of the Indians and
the Bears arc not. It the winner
is decided by the type of offense
rmployed, Stanford it by land.
Gal if by air. Stanford has gained
1 Tf'tj yards on I lie ground this
year and Jis I •• uds through the
airways. On the other extreme,
Gal ha- man: f ;e I n!y 7XI yards
in the ground while amassing
1934 yards passing to place itself
last .md first respectively in the
i (inference standings.
CKAHi MORTON, the record
breaking passer for the Bears,
p;ives the Bear offense its growl.
Much of his success this year de
pends on the line receivers whom
he deploys. So far, he has thrown
13 TD passes this year. His pri
mary targets are flankerbaeks
Jerry Mosher and Jerry Bradley
and end Jack Sehraub, who leads
the squad with 3<S receptions, for
427 yards.
Trying to put Morton & Co.
on salt will he a defensive second
ary which has come of age in the
last few weeks and now ranks
a strong third in the conference.
The addition of Dick Ragsdale,
a well Craig Ritchey, an improved
John Guillory, a strong rush by
such frontliners as Mike Ilibler,
Tom Ross, and Gary Pettigrew,
and capable linebacking are all
factors.
The greatest ally of the of
fense is field position. The de
fense anrl strong punting by the
nation's fourth besi punter, Dave
Lewis, have supplied it in its two
big wins over Oregon schools.
LEWIS WILL start his second
game of the season and poses a
great threat running as he does
passing. In the Oregon State
game, he ran for 67 and passed
for 68.
Stanford will be outweighed by
a substantial margin in the line
as Cal has two players who are
245 and several more who are in
the 230 range. Heading the Bear
bruisers are defensive tackle Stan
Dzura, whom Willsey selected as
his outstanding lineman, and
guard and co-captain Ron Cale
gari.
In the past, the Big Game has
produced stars of players con
sidered only mediocre. They rise
to the excitement and come
through with clutch, game-win
ning performances. Perhaps the
most famous incident is when Cal
reserve halfback Bobby Sherman
ran back a punt for 105 yards in
1900. The sparkling play of Stan
ford's Clark Weaver, a reserve
qb, in the second half of the 19(52
game is another instance. 1904
could likely produce another.

The addition of Dick Ragsdale,

factors.
The greatest ally of the of

LEWIS WILL start his second

Stanford will be outweighed by
