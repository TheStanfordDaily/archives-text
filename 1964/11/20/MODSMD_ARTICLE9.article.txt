"Therefore, since wv arc surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let lis lay
aside every weight, and sin which clink's so closely, and let us run with perseverance
the race that it set before us. looking to Jesus the Pioneer and l'erfecter of our
faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the
shame, and is seated at the right hand of God." (Hebrews 12:1, 2).
Urged on by the examples and testimonies of their fellow-believers, Christians
find themselves on the path way of a great adventure in life, /which the New Testa
ment describes as if it were an exciting foot race. Most of tli ■ world knows nothing
of this race for eternal rewards: "He faithful until death and 1 will give you the
crown of life" (Revelation 2:10). In fact, most of the world in its quest for pleasure
is running in the opposite direction, not towards richer, more abundant life, but
towards the parched dryness and bleakness which ends in eternal separation from
God.
"Blessed are those who wash their robes, that they might have the right to the
tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates. Outside are the dogs and
sorcerers and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves anil
practices falsehood" (Revelation 22:14, 15).
Everywhere on every side men tirr xcarrhiit/i and seeking for lasting peace and
happiness. But all roads except one are dead ends. When a man, however, looks
to Jesus he finds the one and only answer for every human need, and the one Way
to God:
"But wc set Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned
with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, that by the grace of God
He might taste death for every one. Since therefore the children share in flesh and
blood, He Himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death He might
destroy Ilini who has the power of death, that is. the devil, and deliver all those who
through fear of bondage were all their lifetime subject to bondage ... He bad to
be made like His brethren in every reaped, so that He might become a merciful and
faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sin-, of the people.
For because He Himself has suffered and hern tern] ted, He is able ti» help those who
arc tempted" ( Hebrews 2:9-18).
What are you facing? What does life mean to you? Whatever your worries or
your innermost needs, Jesus knows and Jesus cares.
"We have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,
but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are. yet without sinning. Let
us then with confidence draw near to tin throne of grace that w< may receive mercy
and find grace to help in time of need" ( Hebrews 4:15, 16).
Yes, check the- direction you are looking. If you haven't yet done so, look to Jesus
now. He it> real, lie is alive and stands ready to Ik- your Lord.

to Jesus he finds the one and only answer for every human need, and the one Way
to God:
"But wc set Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned
with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, that by the grace of God
He might taste death for every one. Since therefore the children share in flesh and
blood, He Himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death He might
destroy Ilini who has the power of death, that is. the devil, and deliver all those who
through fear of bondage were all their lifetime subject to bondage ... He bad to
be made like His brethren in every reaped, so that He might become a merciful and
faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sin-, of the people.
For because He Himself has suffered and hern tern] ted, He is able ti» help those who
arc tempted" ( Hebrews 2:9-18).
What are you facing? What does life mean to you? Whatever your worries or
your innermost needs, Jesus knows and Jesus cares.
"We have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,
but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are. yet without sinning. Let
us then with confidence draw near to tin throne of grace that w< may receive mercy
and find grace to help in time of need" ( Hebrews 4:15, 16).
Yes, check the- direction you are looking. If you haven't yet done so, look to Jesus
now. He it> real, lie is alive and stands ready to Ik- your Lord.

crown of life" (Revelation 2:10). In fact, most of the world in its quest for pleasure
is running in the opposite direction, not towards richer, more abundant life, but
towards the parched dryness and bleakness which ends in eternal separation from
God.
