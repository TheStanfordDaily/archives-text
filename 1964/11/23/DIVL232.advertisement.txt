Let's discuss tomorrow
In science and technology, the accomplishments
of today are but direction for tomorrow. Why?
Simply because resting on the accomplishments
of today is a luxury we cannot afford.
In Communications Engineering, where
others are content to modify* our mandate
is to CREATE.
In Electronic Data Processing Systems,
where others are content to innovate, our
mandate is to CREATE.
This, then, is the philosophy . . . the crux of
intellectual thought... at the National Security
Agency—where the concepts of tomorrow are the
problems of today.
So lefs discuss the future...
yours and ours
If you are a gifted and interested Engineer or
Mathematician, we have much in common —including
A COMPULSION TO SUCCEED.
Our future is contingent upon a constant input of
new .. . and creative .. . scientific talent. . . the
lifeline of any institution. Our success is embodied
in the technical capabilities of our professional staff.
To assure this, scientific employees are encouraged
to pursue graduate studies at local universities
under Agency sponsorship. Your future with NSA
will entail education . . . early responsibility . . .
and unusually challenging assignments.
Why? Because . . .
• We MUST create completely new kinds of
communications equipments and systems embodying
concepts and techniques THAT HAVE NO
PRECEDENT .. . antennas, transmitters, receivers
and terminal hardware of a most advanced design.
• We MUST assure the complete invulnerability
of message content through the novel . . . but never
static . . . science of cryptology.
• We MUST develop special refinements for
computers and electronic data processing systems
. . . experimenting with the latest semiconductors,
magnetic film and superconductive devices to provide
new logic circuits and memory units for increased
speed and capacity.
Interested? ... If so, then LET'S DISCUSS
TOMORROW. Representatives of the National
Security Agency will be on campus in the near future.

Why? Because . . .
• We MUST create completely new kinds of
communications equipments and systems embodying
concepts and techniques THAT HAVE NO
PRECEDENT .. . antennas, transmitters, receivers
and terminal hardware of a most advanced design.
• We MUST assure the complete invulnerability
of message content through the novel . . . but never
static . . . science of cryptology.
• We MUST develop special refinements for
computers and electronic data processing systems
. . . experimenting with the latest semiconductors,
magnetic film and superconductive devices to provide
new logic circuits and memory units for increased
speed and capacity.

Let's discuss tomorrow
In science and technology, the accomplishments
of today are but direction for tomorrow. Why?
Simply because resting on the accomplishments
of today is a luxury we cannot afford.
In Communications Engineering, where
others are content to modify* our mandate
is to CREATE.
In Electronic Data Processing Systems,
where others are content to innovate, our
mandate is to CREATE.
This, then, is the philosophy . . . the crux of
intellectual thought... at the National Security
Agency—where the concepts of tomorrow are the
problems of today.
So lefs discuss the future...
yours and ours
If you are a gifted and interested Engineer or
Mathematician, we have much in common —including
A COMPULSION TO SUCCEED.
Our future is contingent upon a constant input of
new .. . and creative .. . scientific talent. . . the
lifeline of any institution. Our success is embodied
in the technical capabilities of our professional staff.
To assure this, scientific employees are encouraged
to pursue graduate studies at local universities
under Agency sponsorship. Your future with NSA
will entail education . . . early responsibility . . .
and unusually challenging assignments.
Why? Because . . .
