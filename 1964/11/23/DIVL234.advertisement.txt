God's Definition
of a Christian
From the Bible we readily find that a Christian is a believer in and follower
of Jesus Christ the Messiah. This name is more widely used than any other
by those who believe God unto salvation. Interestingly, however, the name is
employed only three times in the Bible: 'And the disciples were called Christians
first in Antioch" (Acts 11:26); "Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou j
persuadest me to be a Christian' " (Acts 26:2); "If any man suffer as a Chris- |
lion, let him not be ashamed'' (I Peter 4:16).
The term "Christian" is clearly a Gentile designation for believers, since the
word "Christ" upon which the term is constructed, suggests recognition of the
Messiah, which no unbelieving Jew was prepared to do.
Becoming a Christian, according to the New Testament, is a very definite
act with very significant results. According to Lewis Sperry Chafer, no loss than
33 simultaneous and instanteous divine undertakings and transformations, which
collectively constitute the salvation of a soul, take place the moment a person ;
exercises faith in Christ and is saved. Among these is that a believer in Christ |
has the guilt of all his sins removed by God. Secondly, he is taken out of |
his relationship with Adam, the sphere of condemnation, and placed in and
identified with Christ, the sphere of righteousness and justification. Thirdly,
the believer is given a new standing by virtue of his place "in Christ" by the
Holy Spirit's baptizing work (I Corinthinians 12:13, Romans 6:3, A) and made
. . . acceptable" (Ephesians 1:6).
A Christian then, as Chafer says, "Is not one who does certain things for
God but . . . one for whom God has done certain things; he is not so much one
who conforms to a certain manner of life as he is one who has received God s
gift of eternal life through Jesus Christ; he is not one who depends on a hope
lessly imperfect state, but rather, one who has reached a perfect standing be
fore God as beingi n Christ Jesus."
Is God still waiting to make of you this kind of "Christian"? Settle your
life with Him now! Turn your destiny over to Him and personally reccive the
assures of His promises. A Christian is an individual within whom Jesus Christ
dwells. Behold I stand at the door and knock; If any man hear my voice, and
i open the door, I will come in to him, ctnd will sup with him, and he with Me."
(Revelation 3:20).
