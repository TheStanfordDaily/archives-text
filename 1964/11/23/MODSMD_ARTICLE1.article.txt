and the Indians overwhelmed California. 21-3, to finish the season
with a 5-5 record.

LEWIS WAS the offensive

important yardage on second ef

While the offense was putting
i together its largest point output
since the Rice game, the defense
shackled Cal's runners and pass
ing attack enough Jo keep it from
scoring any touchdowns. This
game marked the sixth of the year
that the defense has held the op
position to one touchdown or less.
The line, after a shaky begin
ning, settled down to play its
I usual fine game. Jack Chappie,
j the vanguard of the defensive
squad, turned in a fine effort and
I received lineman of the game
honors. Mike Hibler, Tom Ross,

move reminiscent of the Nazi

Quick Jim Blakeney made the
strategy a success as lie gained 45
yards in nine carries during the
first half, mostly on sweeps. But
like the Nazis, the demise was
shortly to come. Tho second half
saw the Blue and Gold fold.
The Bears let down mentally if
not physically, also. They got only
three yards on the ground in the
; second half and went almost ex
clusively to the air.
Another Tribe of Indians, the
Utah Redskins, held Morton's arm
scoreless last week, and the Cards
took up where it left off. As Mr.
Morton should have realized from
his performances during previous
Big Games, to stay in the air is
an error in the long run. His
three year statistics against the
! Indians show a total of eight in-
I terceptions. John Guillory, who
has a sign in his room vowing he
would intercept a Morton p a s s,
did exactly that—twice.
BOTH THEFTS took place dur

back and served to dissipate the

Guillory caught Blanchfield
from behind on the Stanford five.
The last-ditch tackle proved deci

he passed over the middle where

The Bears lumbered to the Stan

drives, and the Indians luckily

Bears in front. Content with its
accomplishment, Cal never seri

The second half began as Bob
Blunt, who has blossomed in the
latter part of the season, ran back
the kickoff 33 yards. Three run

a first down on its own 44. On sec

down on the four.

The Tribe began another drive

key plays were passes to John Ma

that the defense has held the op

THE 810 A Its in a strategic
move reminiscent of the Nazi
movement around the Maginot
line tried to run around tho Tribe.
Quick Jim Blakeney made the
strategy a success as lie gained 45
yards in nine carries during the
first half, mostly on sweeps. But
like the Nazis, the demise was
shortly to come. Tho second half
saw the Blue and Gold fold.
The Bears let down mentally if
not physically, also. They got only
three yards on the ground in the
; second half and went almost ex
clusively to the air.
Another Tribe of Indians, the
Utah Redskins, held Morton's arm
scoreless last week, and the Cards
took up where it left off. As Mr.
Morton should have realized from
his performances during previous
Big Games, to stay in the air is
an error in the long run. His
three year statistics against the
! Indians show a total of eight in-
I terceptions. John Guillory, who
has a sign in his room vowing he
would intercept a Morton p a s s,
did exactly that—twice.

Guillory caught Blanchfield
from behind on the Stanford five.
The last-ditch tackle proved deci
sive. Morton passed on first down
and, unsettled by a strong rush,
he passed over the middle where
Guillory intercepted.
Guillory's second interception
was on the series of downs just
after Stanford's second TD. A

The Bears lumbered to the Stan
ford 15 and 11 on its first two
drives, and the Indians luckily
escaped with only a three-point
deficit. With 8:38 gone in the first
quarter, Tom Blanehfield kicked
a 29-yard field goal to put the
Bears in front. Content with its
accomplishment, Cal never seri
ously threatened the rest of the
half.
The second half began as Bob
Blunt, who has blossomed in the
latter part of the season, ran back
the kickoff 33 yards. Three run

a first down on its own 44. On sec

bomb rolling left on the double
reverse, and Mike Connelly out
legged Loren Hawley to haul it
down on the four.

The Tribe began another drive
for paydirt on its own 20. Eleven
plays later, Lewis ran it over. The
key plays were passes to John Ma

a rollout by Lewis.

A stymied Stanford offense turned spectacular while its de
fense remained sturdy in the second hull of Big Came Saturday,

with a 5-5 record.
