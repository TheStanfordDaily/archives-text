## Big Game Spectating: On Madness And Mirth 
### Roger Magnuson 
, The golden balloons, the slick programs, and the frosh dolly who
brought along her "Gods And Men," (she was soon to discover which
! were which), all comingled and were somehow conjoined in the
i Berkeleyian ether.
Among Cal's huddled masses one seemed to sense a smug self
-1 satisfaction, bred, perhaps, of scrawling misspelled obscenities and
i big blue "C's" (and is there any difference?) on Stanford sandstone.
The hills surrounding the stadium became crowded as the pre
game brouhaha was initiated.
Stanford rooters were treated to some of Stanford's more
! colorful characters, including Francisco X and featuring Doodles
Weaver, who demonstrated that sympathy can provoke laughter.
"I really hope no one overdoes," said a fashionable matron three
; rows down from the pressbox.
The excitement was rising now and there emerged a rather |
collective tension which swept through the stands. And into the •
pressbox as well.
When Ralston trotted onto the field as Bradcn Beck was teeing i
up the ball for the initial kick-off a rather greasy representative of \
the Daily Cal was heard to shriek, "Twelve men on the field!"
DON'T FORGET THE DOG
"Also a dog," someone said, as a burly mulatto of dog knocked
I the ball of the kicking tee. The dog didn't step onto the field much
more after that. Ralston did.
It. was clear early that Stanford was going to be intimidated by
the raucous but well-disciplined Cal cheering section, especially when
: the Bears had the ball.
Which seemed like about three-quarters of the first hall'.
But if they had the numbers, we had ihe quality. "Go demon
i strate" and "Football game, not sit-in" were more than a match for
Cal's cheers.
Soon it was half-time.
Cal again showed the endless resources of cleverness and the
classical r.f.'s they can pull off when aroused as a wild-eyed product
of their institution lunged onto the field and started kicking at a
Stanford drum.
THE BURLY BAND
At which point the burl of the Stanford marching band was
mobilized into a crushing display of the Farm's virility. The band
broke ranks and began thoroughly pummeLing the baffled r.f.'er, as
S.P.C.A.'ers groaned.
The second half was, of course, the producer of mass delirium.
As the Indians began to surge, the old alums on the sidelines
unclenched their fists and unfurrowed their brows, while their well
dressed wives puffed somewhat more gently on their Benson &
Hedges.
And finally, Stanford had kept the Axe for four straight years.
The alums sang the Hymn reverentially in an all-pervading soggy
nostalgia that drenched the west side of the stadium.
And then they hurried for the martinis and, if possible, more nos
talgia.
The students seemed bent on savoring the victory yet longer.
As the Cal section hurriedly flushed itself out of the stadium, the
| Stanford section remained still in bemused affability.
AND NEW AMUSEMENTS
But soon these too had enough for the present and anxiously
; moved on to new and different amusements.
The ones who remained in a suspended .state of jubilation were
Ralston and his players. Ralston had run off the field almost as
briskly as he had run on and had unwound in the jammed dressing
room by leading a cheer with the players.
Ralston sipped on his coke and said all the things all winning
coaches in all the Big Game rivalries throughout the country are
i supposed to say.
And after the coaching cliches had been uttered, and the players
I showered and dressed, the locker room became as empty as the field,
and only a few grade school souvenir scavengers remained at the
: scene of a Stanford triumph.

The students seemed bent on savoring the victory yet longer.
As the Cal section hurriedly flushed itself out of the stadium, the
| Stanford section remained still in bemused affability.
AND NEW AMUSEMENTS
But soon these too had enough for the present and anxiously
; moved on to new and different amusements.
The ones who remained in a suspended .state of jubilation were
Ralston and his players. Ralston had run off the field almost as
briskly as he had run on and had unwound in the jammed dressing
room by leading a cheer with the players.
Ralston sipped on his coke and said all the things all winning
coaches in all the Big Game rivalries throughout the country are
i supposed to say.
And after the coaching cliches had been uttered, and the players
I showered and dressed, the locker room became as empty as the field,
and only a few grade school souvenir scavengers remained at the
: scene of a Stanford triumph.
, The golden balloons, the slick programs, and the frosh dolly who
brought along her "Gods And Men," (she was soon to discover which
! were which), all comingled and were somehow conjoined in the
i Berkeleyian ether.
Among Cal's huddled masses one seemed to sense a smug self
-1 satisfaction, bred, perhaps, of scrawling misspelled obscenities and
i big blue "C's" (and is there any difference?) on Stanford sandstone.
The hills surrounding the stadium became crowded as the pre
game brouhaha was initiated.
Stanford rooters were treated to some of Stanford's more
! colorful characters, including Francisco X and featuring Doodles
Weaver, who demonstrated that sympathy can provoke laughter.
"I really hope no one overdoes," said a fashionable matron three
; rows down from the pressbox.
The excitement was rising now and there emerged a rather |
collective tension which swept through the stands. And into the •
pressbox as well.
When Ralston trotted onto the field as Bradcn Beck was teeing i
up the ball for the initial kick-off a rather greasy representative of \
the Daily Cal was heard to shriek, "Twelve men on the field!"
DON'T FORGET THE DOG
"Also a dog," someone said, as a burly mulatto of dog knocked
I the ball of the kicking tee. The dog didn't step onto the field much
more after that. Ralston did.
It. was clear early that Stanford was going to be intimidated by
the raucous but well-disciplined Cal cheering section, especially when
: the Bears had the ball.
Which seemed like about three-quarters of the first hall'.
But if they had the numbers, we had ihe quality. "Go demon
i strate" and "Football game, not sit-in" were more than a match for
Cal's cheers.
Soon it was half-time.
Cal again showed the endless resources of cleverness and the
classical r.f.'s they can pull off when aroused as a wild-eyed product
of their institution lunged onto the field and started kicking at a
Stanford drum.
THE BURLY BAND
At which point the burl of the Stanford marching band was
mobilized into a crushing display of the Farm's virility. The band
broke ranks and began thoroughly pummeLing the baffled r.f.'er, as
S.P.C.A.'ers groaned.
The second half was, of course, the producer of mass delirium.
As the Indians began to surge, the old alums on the sidelines
unclenched their fists and unfurrowed their brows, while their well
dressed wives puffed somewhat more gently on their Benson &
Hedges.
And finally, Stanford had kept the Axe for four straight years.
The alums sang the Hymn reverentially in an all-pervading soggy
nostalgia that drenched the west side of the stadium.
And then they hurried for the martinis and, if possible, more nos
talgia.
The students seemed bent on savoring the victory yet longer.
