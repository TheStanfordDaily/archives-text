# The 						New Campuses

rlir approval of two new overseas campuses
lias met with decidedly mixed reaction from the
students, demonstrating a need for clarification
of tlu 1 purposes of the program.
The most widespread reaction was quite fa
vorable. W hat beautiful campuses and what
great locations! Wouldn't it be fun to go to the
English countryside or to the Austrian Alps!
This reaction tends to confirm the long-held
suspicions til many critics of the overseas cam
puses program that Stanford is really running a
six-mouth vacation program that is nearly value
less as far as genuine education is concerned.
Such, we feel, is not the case, and the ad
ministration should take pains to make this clear.
The objective of the overseas program has been
and should continue to be to provide students
with a cultural perspective which is not avail
able through courses here, and to do so through
a stiff academic program which includes heavy
exposure to the people and institutions of the
respective countries. Such a program is not meant
for the student "on vacation."
A less common, but nevertheless quite audible
reaction was that the new campuses will only
perpetuate and indeed magnify two existing
faults of the program: failure of students to mas
ter the language, and isolation from the sur
rounding culture.
The first fault, the critics feel, is exempli
fied in the extreme by the British campus, where
students won't have to learn a foreign language at
all.
Again, clarification is sorely needed. For
Stanford abroad — as the British campus in

fact shows — is not primarily a language pro
gram. It was set up to reduce the emphasis on
language (as it exists in the overseas programs
of most other universities), in order to enable
non-language majors and even students with
minimal language background to partake of the
educational benefits available though living in,
travelling around, and learning about a foreign
country. Make no mistake about it, Stanfords
program is a mass program, not a program for
the language-oriented elite, and now almost halt
the undergraduate student body will be able to
attend.
The second criticism — that the new campuses
are too isolated — is, unfortunately, well-founded.
The British campus is three miles from the near
est town and quite a distance from a major popu
lation center, and the Austrian campus — a wing
of a resort hotel — is 57 miles from Vienna.
What must be avoided, if the new campuses
are to be successful, is the kind of ivory tower
isolation which has occasionally marred the over
seas experience of past groups. Weekend travel,
guest lecturers, student exchanges, and short
group field trips can serve to alleviate the prob
lem.
In sum, the new campuses provide more and
better opportunities for Stanford students to
broaden their education considerably, but they
must not be allowed to become either vacation
lands where academics are ignored, or study cen
ters where the students, occupied with their
books and content in their own group living, fail
to meet and get acquainted with the surround
ing cultures.
