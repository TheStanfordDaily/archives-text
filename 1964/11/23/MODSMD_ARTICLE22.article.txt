## Social Regulations: A Proposal 
### 
Dear Sir:
Many letters have been written
to The Daily concerning the wom
en's social regulations. The con
sensus of dissatisfaction shows a
need for a constructive proposal
for change. We are in accord with
the ideas of responsibility ex
pressed in the Fundamental Stan
dard and we believe the following
system would better promote
these ideals.
1. Freshman women shall have
unlimited 2:3o's and weekend
overnights. Sophs and Junior and
Senior women shall have no pre
scribed hours. They .shall sign
out for the hour and day they
plan to return. A signout proce
dure will be followed for the
woman's protection; if the wom
an does not return a half hour
after the time she has desig
nated. she will be located through
the information on her signout
card.
2. A woman may use her own
discretion in choosing her com
panion and destination as long
as the signout procedure is fol
lowed.
3. Dishonestly and/or irrespon
sibility shall be grounds for dis
ciplinary action.
We realize that there are many
details to be worked out in this
plan but we feel it allows women
the freedom to mature under a
system more compatible with the
spirit of responsibility of the
Fundamental Standard.
Ideally a university should not
impose any rigid system of so
cial regulations upon the women,
for ideally all its students should
be under the same rules, but we
feel that this proposal offers a
workable approach to encourage
individual growth and maturity.

• Social Desert
Dear Sir:
Although I have seen many
topics discussed in The Daily, 1
am surprised there is so little
said about the generally tragic
social situation. Dances intended
to serve as "social mixers" over
flow with dateless men who are
lucky to catch sight of a girl.
The ratio is multiplied many
limes in these ridiculous carica
tures of "social events." On cam
pus. strangers never speak (that
would be obscene); public dis
plays of affection are nonexis
tent, and private ones aic prob
ably no more common.

On dates Stanford women are
universally aloof, dull, and metic
ulously formal in behavior. Al
though the "sour grapes" attitude
that Stanford women are ugly is
thoroughly inaccurate, any warm
attention (e.g. holding hands)
directed towards Stanford women
is unreciprocated and, indeed,
punished. But their general be
havior is even more drastic: I
have seldom seen a Stanford
woman even look at a man when
she could avoid it.
One concludes that Stanford
women do not consider men as
people, but merely as objects of
the environment, like chairs and
garbage cans, which may occa
sionally be useful but which
I arouse no particular interest.
After my graduation in June, I
| will look back and wonder how a
university that purports to turn
out "well-adjusted individuals"
could maintain such a social
desert.

• YD's Reply
Dear Sir:
The Daily is to be commended
for its brilliant Hearstian expose
on the FSM and the late YD peti
lion on Free Speech at Cal in
last Thursday's paper.
Aside from the judicious jux
taposition of a picture of a de
fiant Mario Savio and the afore
mentioned petition the Chron
icle could not have done better—
we also find a rather telling as
sertion by Mr. Naylor on the Edit
page that "the final form of the
petition in question was drafted
after consultation with Ma r i o
Savio and other FSM leaders Sun
day evening at Savio's apartment
in Berkeley."
Granted, this makes good copy
and assuages Mr. Naylor's need to
find a furtive conspiracy behind
every — gulp — "libertarian" pro
posal. However, it is a bit over
stated.
One sentence of the proposed
petition was deleted after this
"consultation." In its place was
substituted the phraseology th e
[ FSM used in their petition at Cal,
which, in effect, said the same
thing more explicity. If anyone
saves Daily's perish the thought
- they can check the resolution
printed in Monday's Daily with
the one in Thursday's Daily. To
us, they look remarkably similar.
What is happening at Cal?
Surely those 4,500 students who
quietly waited outside the Regents
; meeting last Friday weren't there
i to get a tan. We think Clark Kerr
inadvertently summed it up best
i in his news confercncc after the
I meeting.

"The students in the '50's were j
part of the 'apathetic generation'; |
today's students are part of the]
'articulate generation.' "
Although we don't expect too
much 'articulation' from The
Daily, we would like the editor to j
deal less with personalities a n d
i more with issues.

• Ilillel And The FSM
Desir Sir:
We would like to bring to your j
; attention a serious mistake in
your feature article of November 1
19 on the Free Speech Movement.
In this article the Hillcl Founda
tion is said to have passed a reso
lution supporting the petition
which is currently circulating
about the campus. This is com-1
pletely erroneous. The Ilillel :
Foundation, as a religious organi- j
zation, has not taken and will
not take a stand on any political!
question. Though many of our
! members may support this Move-j
I ment, it is not within the scope
; of Hillel activities to support aj
! measure such as this and we
| hope that this letter will clarify
our position on this question.

• Source Of Vandalism
Dear Sir:
It is needless to draw attention i
to the wasteful and destructive
vandalism which recently defaced
our buildings and plaza. It might
be worthwhile to consider the
source of this wanton destruction.
The students of the University of I
California have recently attracted!
public attention in their demands
for free speech; they have criti
cized the community for failure
to support racial justice, economic j
equality, and political reform.
How dare common vandals de- j
mand rights; how dare mutilators
of social property censure others
for social injustice. It would per
haps benefit these students if they
would put their own house in or
der before atempting to join civil
ized society.
