# On The Right
## Lyndon Has Vast Powers; Will He Push For Reform? 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
President Lyndon Johnson of Johnson City, Texas, is all of a
sudden lord of all lie surveys. The changes in the composition of !
Congress are all he could wish for. Correction, all a normally
,
j ambitious President could wish lor—Lyndon Johnson probably
! wishes every single Republican had been beaten.

Still, the Senate is 2-1 Demo
cratic, and the enormous lead the
Democrats held in the House of
Representatives has not only in
creased, precisely the right guys
were beaten, as far as Johnson
is concerned; and he has only
left to worry about a few of the
Democratic old-timers like How
ard Smith and Otto Passman who
stand although resolute, neverthe
j less now easily overwhelmable, as
' minor distractions between him
and the realization of all his
j dreams. What are these dreams?
What Does LB.J Plan To Do?
j Why, the Great Society, suh!
I Yes yes, Mr. President, but the
I campaign is over and the time
j draws near to can the rhetoric
j and be concrete. We know that
, we arc at war with poverty and
I with ill health and that we shall
never surrender; and we suspect
that it is going to be a very long
I war indeed. But what else, other
than step up the anti-poverty pro
gram, and move in the direction of
socializing medicine, does Presi
dent Johnson plan to do?
i It is a bizarre suggestion, but
!l think one ought seriously to
meditate on the thesis that in the
future, the principal reforms may
very well have to come from the
left in American politics. Two ex-
Samples, one in international af
fairs, one in national affairs.
What if Mr. Nixon had gotten up
to propose, one week before Pres
' ident Kennedy instituted it on
: October 22, 1962, an ultimatum
J to the Soviet Union backed up by
:a naval blockade of Cuba? He'd
| probably have been run out of
1 town by wet towels. What if Sen
-1 ator Dirksen, not President Ken
j nedy., had suggested the recent
j tax cut with rates favoring the
j upper and middle income tax
1 brackets? What chance would the
1 measure have had of getting
: through Congress over the pre
sumptive opposition of the Demo
j crats?
GOP: Permanent Minority?
The likelihood is very remote
i that the Republicans will organize
i Congress again at any time in the
(foreseeable future. The tendency
! in American politics during the
j past decades has been to break the
! balance of things. The Executive
i has drawn power out of all pro
portion to what it was intended
, it should have. The same is true
of the Judiciary. Congress is re
j duced to a sea anchor of sorts, a
| kind of American House of Lords
j with the right to a suspensory
j veto, good only for slowing things
I down for a session or two. The

Democratic Party's edge is over
whelming, • and is becoming in
creasingly institutionalized. It is
by no means inevitable that the
Republicans will never again be
the majority party; but it is al
together possible.
Especially possible if the lead
ership of the Democratic Party
exercises its powers in a prag
matic way, pre-empting from the
Republicans the causes of its most
acute complaints. That is how -
r c m ember? — the Democrats
drained the power of the Social
ist Party in the twenties and
thirties. So long as the leadership
of the Democratic Party moves
with duo regard to incipient popu
lar resentments from the Right,
it should succeed in staying in
definitely in power.
Needed Legislation
I have in mind such possibilities
as lie before Lyndon Johnson.
There are, it seems to me, several
pieces of legislation that most
urgently need passing. One would
control the excesses of organized
labor: such wanton disregard of
the rights of the community as is
being shown in Detroit where, as
in New York eighteen months
ago, the newspapers are closed
down by the labor unions even
though a) the public wants and
is willing to pay for newspapers,
and 1) i newspaper owners are will
ing to pay prices which c> printers
and pressmen in various parts of
the country would be willing to
accept. What keeps these three
parties from producing news
papers is the union shop and the
picket line. No Republican is go
ing to be able to remedy that situ
ation. Only the Democrats can.
Another example is of course the
farm problem. What Democrat,
and when, will get up and suggest
that farm subsidies be reduced,
say, to a maximum of $7,000 per
family?
Lyndon Johnson has historical
opportunities, and there is some
thing to be said for the man's am
bition. As a politician he has done
very well, very well indeed, but
nothing spectacular considering
the objective state of affairs when
he came into office. If he wants
other than cursory mention in
the history books, he might con
sider the challenge of affecting
reform where reform is needed,
without reference to left or right.
Reform is not a synonym for left
ward ho!, and the first Democrat
in power who recognizes this will
go down big in the history books.

sudden lord of all lie surveys. The changes in the composition of !
Congress are all he could wish for. Correction, all a normally
,
j ambitious President could wish lor—Lyndon Johnson probably
! wishes every single Republican had been beaten.

Still, the Senate is 2-1 Demo
cratic, and the enormous lead the
Democrats held in the House of
Representatives has not only in
creased, precisely the right guys
were beaten, as far as Johnson
is concerned; and he has only
left to worry about a few of the
Democratic old-timers like How
ard Smith and Otto Passman who
stand although resolute, neverthe
j less now easily overwhelmable, as
' minor distractions between him
and the realization of all his
j dreams. What are these dreams?
What Does LB.J Plan To Do?
j Why, the Great Society, suh!
I Yes yes, Mr. President, but the
I campaign is over and the time
j draws near to can the rhetoric
j and be concrete. We know that
, we arc at war with poverty and
I with ill health and that we shall
never surrender; and we suspect
that it is going to be a very long
I war indeed. But what else, other
than step up the anti-poverty pro
gram, and move in the direction of
socializing medicine, does Presi
dent Johnson plan to do?
i It is a bizarre suggestion, but
!l think one ought seriously to
meditate on the thesis that in the
future, the principal reforms may
very well have to come from the
left in American politics. Two ex-
Samples, one in international af
fairs, one in national affairs.
What if Mr. Nixon had gotten up
to propose, one week before Pres
' ident Kennedy instituted it on
: October 22, 1962, an ultimatum
J to the Soviet Union backed up by
:a naval blockade of Cuba? He'd
| probably have been run out of
1 town by wet towels. What if Sen
-1 ator Dirksen, not President Ken
j nedy., had suggested the recent
j tax cut with rates favoring the
j upper and middle income tax
1 brackets? What chance would the
1 measure have had of getting
: through Congress over the pre
sumptive opposition of the Demo
j crats?
GOP: Permanent Minority?
The likelihood is very remote
i that the Republicans will organize
i Congress again at any time in the
(foreseeable future. The tendency
! in American politics during the
j past decades has been to break the
! balance of things. The Executive
i has drawn power out of all pro
portion to what it was intended
, it should have. The same is true
of the Judiciary. Congress is re
j duced to a sea anchor of sorts, a
| kind of American House of Lords
j with the right to a suspensory
j veto, good only for slowing things
I down for a session or two. The

Democratic Party's edge is over
whelming, • and is becoming in
creasingly institutionalized. It is
by no means inevitable that the
Republicans will never again be
the majority party; but it is al
together possible.
Especially possible if the lead
ership of the Democratic Party
exercises its powers in a prag
matic way, pre-empting from the
Republicans the causes of its most
acute complaints. That is how -
r c m ember? — the Democrats
drained the power of the Social
ist Party in the twenties and
thirties. So long as the leadership
of the Democratic Party moves
with duo regard to incipient popu
lar resentments from the Right,
it should succeed in staying in
definitely in power.
Needed Legislation
I have in mind such possibilities
as lie before Lyndon Johnson.
There are, it seems to me, several
pieces of legislation that most
urgently need passing. One would
control the excesses of organized
labor: such wanton disregard of
the rights of the community as is
being shown in Detroit where, as
in New York eighteen months
ago, the newspapers are closed
down by the labor unions even
though a) the public wants and
is willing to pay for newspapers,
and 1) i newspaper owners are will
ing to pay prices which c> printers
and pressmen in various parts of
the country would be willing to
accept. What keeps these three
parties from producing news
papers is the union shop and the
picket line. No Republican is go
ing to be able to remedy that situ
ation. Only the Democrats can.
Another example is of course the
farm problem. What Democrat,
and when, will get up and suggest
that farm subsidies be reduced,
say, to a maximum of $7,000 per
family?
Lyndon Johnson has historical
opportunities, and there is some
thing to be said for the man's am
bition. As a politician he has done
very well, very well indeed, but
nothing spectacular considering
the objective state of affairs when
he came into office. If he wants
other than cursory mention in
the history books, he might con
sider the challenge of affecting
reform where reform is needed,
without reference to left or right.
Reform is not a synonym for left
ward ho!, and the first Democrat
in power who recognizes this will
go down big in the history books.

Congress are all he could wish for. Correction, all a normally
,
j ambitious President could wish lor—Lyndon Johnson probably
! wishes every single Republican had been beaten.

Still, the Senate is 2-1 Demo
cratic, and the enormous lead the
Democrats held in the House of
Representatives has not only in
creased, precisely the right guys
were beaten, as far as Johnson
is concerned; and he has only
left to worry about a few of the
Democratic old-timers like How
ard Smith and Otto Passman who
stand although resolute, neverthe
j less now easily overwhelmable, as
' minor distractions between him
and the realization of all his
j dreams. What are these dreams?
What Does LB.J Plan To Do?
j Why, the Great Society, suh!
I Yes yes, Mr. President, but the
I campaign is over and the time
j draws near to can the rhetoric
j and be concrete. We know that
, we arc at war with poverty and
I with ill health and that we shall
never surrender; and we suspect
that it is going to be a very long
I war indeed. But what else, other
than step up the anti-poverty pro
gram, and move in the direction of
socializing medicine, does Presi
dent Johnson plan to do?
i It is a bizarre suggestion, but
!l think one ought seriously to
meditate on the thesis that in the
future, the principal reforms may
very well have to come from the
left in American politics. Two ex-
Samples, one in international af
fairs, one in national affairs.
What if Mr. Nixon had gotten up
to propose, one week before Pres
' ident Kennedy instituted it on
: October 22, 1962, an ultimatum
J to the Soviet Union backed up by
:a naval blockade of Cuba? He'd
| probably have been run out of
1 town by wet towels. What if Sen
-1 ator Dirksen, not President Ken
j nedy., had suggested the recent
j tax cut with rates favoring the
j upper and middle income tax
1 brackets? What chance would the
1 measure have had of getting
: through Congress over the pre
sumptive opposition of the Demo
j crats?
GOP: Permanent Minority?
The likelihood is very remote
i that the Republicans will organize
i Congress again at any time in the
(foreseeable future. The tendency
! in American politics during the
j past decades has been to break the
! balance of things. The Executive
i has drawn power out of all pro
portion to what it was intended
, it should have. The same is true
of the Judiciary. Congress is re
j duced to a sea anchor of sorts, a
| kind of American House of Lords
j with the right to a suspensory
j veto, good only for slowing things
I down for a session or two. The

Democratic Party's edge is over
whelming, • and is becoming in
creasingly institutionalized. It is
by no means inevitable that the
Republicans will never again be
the majority party; but it is al
together possible.
Especially possible if the lead
ership of the Democratic Party
exercises its powers in a prag
matic way, pre-empting from the
Republicans the causes of its most
acute complaints. That is how -
r c m ember? — the Democrats
drained the power of the Social
ist Party in the twenties and
thirties. So long as the leadership
of the Democratic Party moves
with duo regard to incipient popu
lar resentments from the Right,
it should succeed in staying in
definitely in power.
Needed Legislation
I have in mind such possibilities
as lie before Lyndon Johnson.
There are, it seems to me, several
pieces of legislation that most
urgently need passing. One would
control the excesses of organized
labor: such wanton disregard of
the rights of the community as is
being shown in Detroit where, as
in New York eighteen months
ago, the newspapers are closed
down by the labor unions even
though a) the public wants and
is willing to pay for newspapers,
and 1) i newspaper owners are will
ing to pay prices which c> printers
and pressmen in various parts of
the country would be willing to
accept. What keeps these three
parties from producing news
papers is the union shop and the
picket line. No Republican is go
ing to be able to remedy that situ
ation. Only the Democrats can.
Another example is of course the
farm problem. What Democrat,
and when, will get up and suggest
that farm subsidies be reduced,
say, to a maximum of $7,000 per
family?
Lyndon Johnson has historical
opportunities, and there is some
thing to be said for the man's am
bition. As a politician he has done
very well, very well indeed, but
nothing spectacular considering
the objective state of affairs when
he came into office. If he wants
other than cursory mention in
the history books, he might con
sider the challenge of affecting
reform where reform is needed,
without reference to left or right.
Reform is not a synonym for left
ward ho!, and the first Democrat
in power who recognizes this will
go down big in the history books.
