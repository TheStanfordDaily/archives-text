Send It on Ahead
"For we brought nothing into this world, end it is certain that we can
carry nothing out" (I Timothy 6:7).
You can t take it with you! This old familiar expression is confirmed by the
Bible which reminds us that we must leave our earthly riches behind when
we die.
But a little study of the Word of God, the Bible, will show that you can
send it on ahead, For God has an investment plan which pays perpetual I
dividends.
During the Sermon on the Mount the Lord Jesus Christ spoke concerning
treasures in the life to come: ' Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon
earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break in and
steal: but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor
rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: For where
your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matthew 6:19-21).
Step One in God's investment plan is to commit one's resources to Jesus
Christ, including one's life. This will bring membership in God's investment
family, it will include you among those who now are at work earning eternal
rewards and prizes.
In His parable of the unjust steward (Luke 16:1-15) and the parable of
the ten talents (Matthew 25:14-29), the Lord Jesus indicated that God entrusts
His servants with resources such os money and intellect and special talents
which are to be invested now in life on earth. Faithfullness, He said in the use
of what God has given will earn His followers eternal dividends.
In a world where most men seek for their own fame and fortune it is
refreshing to discover that God looks as money matters in quite a different
way. But God means "business" when He speaks!
But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly; and
he which soweth bountifully will reap bountifully. Every man according as he
purposeth in his heart, so let him give, not grudgingly, or of necessity; for God
loveth a cheerful giver. And God is able to make all grace abound toward
you; that ye, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good
work'' (2 Corinthinians 9:6-8)
Have you discovered God's investment plan? Are you a part of His program
for eternal rewards? Why not check out His plan and His way? Why lay up
temporal treasures which one day you must leave behind? Lay up treasures for
eternity now! Begin by investing your life in Jesus Christ. He means what He
says, and He is able to "deliver the goods."
