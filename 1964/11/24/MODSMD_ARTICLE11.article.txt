# FSM Chiefs Split On Demonstrations
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Approximately 220 University
of California students sat-in on
the second floor of Sproul Hall
yesterday after the first Free
Speech Movement (FSM) rally
since the Board of Regents met
last Friday.
Mario Savio, leader of the FSM,
urged the more than 1,000
members present to join him in
the sit-in, but his appeal was de
bated by three other members of
the FSM.
THEY URGED the students to
wait until the Academic Senate
(ASUC) had met and Chancellor
Edward W. Strong's office had
issued its promised "position
paper" on how the Regents' policy
is going to be enforced. Both
these actions will take place to
day.
Two other members of the
FSM Steering Committee de
fended Savio. As FSM head
quarters explained last night,
"We just couldn't wait around
for the faculty to act; we had to
do something. . . . People might
get bored."
The Steering Committee voted
7-4 to have the sit-in. The dis
sidents joined the others as they
trooped up the stairs at 2 p.m.
to start the sit-in.
ONCE ON THE second floor,
the demonstrators spra w le d
across the north wing in front of
Hie Dean of Students' office. Since
no one blocked any passageways,
there were no arrests.
The dissident faction won a
second vote on the Steering Com
mittee as that group decided by
a 6-.") vote to quit the sit-in at 5
p.m.
"No attempt was made to oust
them," Public Information spokes
man Allan Cline told The Daily,
"because they weren't doing any
thing illegal."
C'LINE ALSO admitted that no
action had been taken against
those at the rally who had set
up tables to advocate and solicit
funds and membership all ille
gal under University policy. He
said no action would be taken
until the guidelines were laid
down by Chancellor Strong's re
port today.
"Besides, there wasn't, much of
a crowd up there," he added.
"The dissention in the FSM led
to a sort of petering out of stu
dent interest."
Earlier at the rally, the stu
dents had heard Vice Chancellor
Alan W. Searcy read Strong's
statement explaining that "ap
propria Ie action will ho taken
upon consultation with the Stu
dent Affairs Committee and
through that commit too with the
ASUC."
SAVIO CRITICIZED the pro
posal, since the Student Affairs
Committee is a faculty commit
too with members appointed by
the Chancellor.
Ho complained that the Regents
had not oven accepted the ASUC
faculty compromise, which would
have set up an ASUC-designated
faculty committee 10 try contro
versial cases of University dis
ciplinary action for illegal off
campus activity.
"It's not a question of students
wanting to advocate unlawful
acts," Savio said, "But. rather the
University wanting to decide
what constitutes an abuse of free
speech. This is the prerogative of
the courts.
"WE ARE DEALING with an
administration which, in our
eyes, has dealt in bad faith, has

delayed without actually discuss
ing ihings with us. . . . Instead,
they just issue edicts."
So ended what a reporter for
the Daily Cal rather euphemistic
ally called the "first dialogue
between the Administration and
the FSM."

Arthur Goldberg, a member of
iho Steering Committee, was still
under indictment for trespassing,
as he and six others picketed and
obstructed traffic at the Oakland
Tribune building last weekend.
PRESIDENT (LARK KERR
was still unable to satisfy the de
mands of "those who distrust,
normal procedure and seek to by
pass th e process of discussion
and antagonize the forces of law.''
And the FSM was still squab
bling about tactics, though no
one had yet opposed the plan to
distribute a now record of FSM
songs through a private company.

Approximately 220 University
of California students sat-in on
the second floor of Sproul Hall
yesterday after the first Free
Speech Movement (FSM) rally
since the Board of Regents met
last Friday.
Mario Savio, leader of the FSM,
urged the more than 1,000
members present to join him in
the sit-in, but his appeal was de
bated by three other members of
the FSM.
THEY URGED the students to
wait until the Academic Senate
(ASUC) had met and Chancellor
Edward W. Strong's office had
issued its promised "position
paper" on how the Regents' policy
is going to be enforced. Both
these actions will take place to
day.
Two other members of the
FSM Steering Committee de
fended Savio. As FSM head
quarters explained last night,
"We just couldn't wait around
for the faculty to act; we had to
do something. . . . People might
get bored."
The Steering Committee voted
7-4 to have the sit-in. The dis
sidents joined the others as they
trooped up the stairs at 2 p.m.
to start the sit-in.
ONCE ON THE second floor,
the demonstrators spra w le d
across the north wing in front of
Hie Dean of Students' office. Since
no one blocked any passageways,
there were no arrests.
The dissident faction won a
second vote on the Steering Com
mittee as that group decided by
a 6-.") vote to quit the sit-in at 5
p.m.
"No attempt was made to oust
them," Public Information spokes
man Allan Cline told The Daily,
"because they weren't doing any
thing illegal."
C'LINE ALSO admitted that no
action had been taken against
those at the rally who had set
up tables to advocate and solicit
funds and membership all ille
gal under University policy. He
said no action would be taken
until the guidelines were laid
down by Chancellor Strong's re
port today.
"Besides, there wasn't, much of
a crowd up there," he added.
"The dissention in the FSM led
to a sort of petering out of stu
dent interest."
Earlier at the rally, the stu
dents had heard Vice Chancellor
Alan W. Searcy read Strong's
statement explaining that "ap
propria Ie action will ho taken
upon consultation with the Stu
dent Affairs Committee and
through that commit too with the
ASUC."
SAVIO CRITICIZED the pro
posal, since the Student Affairs
Committee is a faculty commit
too with members appointed by
the Chancellor.
Ho complained that the Regents
had not oven accepted the ASUC
faculty compromise, which would
have set up an ASUC-designated
faculty committee 10 try contro
versial cases of University dis
ciplinary action for illegal off
campus activity.
"It's not a question of students
wanting to advocate unlawful
acts," Savio said, "But. rather the
University wanting to decide
what constitutes an abuse of free
speech. This is the prerogative of
the courts.
"WE ARE DEALING with an
administration which, in our
eyes, has dealt in bad faith, has

delayed without actually discuss
ing ihings with us. . . . Instead,
they just issue edicts."
So ended what a reporter for
the Daily Cal rather euphemistic
ally called the "first dialogue
between the Administration and
the FSM."

Arthur Goldberg, a member of
iho Steering Committee, was still
under indictment for trespassing,
as he and six others picketed and
obstructed traffic at the Oakland
Tribune building last weekend.
