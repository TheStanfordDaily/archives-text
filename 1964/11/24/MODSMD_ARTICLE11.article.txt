### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Approximately 220 University
of California students sat-in on
the second floor of Sproul Hall
yesterday after the first Free
Speech Movement (FSM) rally
since the Board of Regents met
last Friday.
Mario Savio, leader of the FSM,
urged the more than 1,000
members present to join him in
the sit-in, but his appeal was de

the FSM.
THEY URGED the students to
wait until the Academic Senate
(ASUC) had met and Chancellor
Edward W. Strong's office had
issued its promised "position

"No attempt was made to oust
them," Public Information spokes
man Allan Cline told The Daily,
"because they weren't doing any
thing illegal."
C'LINE ALSO admitted that no
action had been taken against
those at the rally who had set
up tables to advocate and solicit
funds and membership all ille

said no action would be taken
until the guidelines were laid
down by Chancellor Strong's re
port today.
"Besides, there wasn't, much of
a crowd up there," he added.
"The dissention in the FSM led
to a sort of petering out of stu

Earlier at the rally, the stu

Alan W. Searcy read Strong's
statement explaining that "ap
