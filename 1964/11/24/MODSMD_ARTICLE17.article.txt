welj-balancod Cal freshman team.
Bill Ready topped tho Stanford
varsity scoring list as ho has
so often through the season.
Ready tallied five times. B r i a ti

Bill Chandler shot two and
Tom Chalberg and Art Snyder
one each to give the seniors all
but two of the Stanford goals.
CAL OPENED tho scoring but
! tho Cards quickly jumped back to
I take a 4-2 load after the first per
i iod. Jeff Beck took the only suc

■ cessful shot in Ihe second period.
Stanford moved from the 5-2
1 half) ime advantage to a command
ing 8-3 lead in tho third quarter.
I Cal's tactics backfired, and with
| seven Bears fouled out in tho final
period, tho Tribe swooped down i
j with six goals in tho last period, i
Sophomore goalie Miko Sorem
| played through the entire game.
I thwarting nine Cal scoring at-!
j tempts.
THE FRESHMAN game started
i even and carried to the end a
touch-and-go atmosphere. Stan
ford opened the game with two
quick goals, but Cal fought to a
3-3 tie at the end of tho first
period.

Doug Mac Lean scored throe
goals for Stanford, to highlight
a five-goal second quarter. Th e

The lead see-sawed, back and
forth in the third period until Cal
took a 13-11 advantage going into

short as the Cal frosh posted an
18-15 victory.
STANFORD was hurt when Bill
Meyer, who scored three goals
and Pete Ready, who tallied

The Papooses will have the
chance to avenge the loss in the
Nor-Cal Closed Tournament this
week. Tuesday night the frosh
most likely will meet the Univer
sity of Santa Clara. In the semi
finals, the Papooses will probably
encounter the San Jose State
frosh and the Cal frosh in th e
final match.
