# French Prof Speaks Here On Rousseau
## Begins Memorial Lecture Series 
### JOHN BROOKS 
Initiating the Haas Memorial
Lecture Series yesterday after
noon was guest speaker George
Claude May, professor of French
at Yale College. Speaking on
Jean Jacques Rousseau's percep
tions of man and society, May
maintained that "the professor of
literature must dabble in sociol
ogy."
Pointing out that Rousseau was
a social writer rather than a
"professional tradesman," he
stated that the inspiration for
Rousseau's work was the ideal
of public usefulness. Quoting
from The Dialogues, May also
emphasized that the writer did
not seek glory or honor for com
municating the idea which "lie be
lieved useful to mankind."
"PUBLIC OPINION is evil in
Rousseau's viewpoint because it
deprives man of the freedom to
be himself," stated May. He con
tinued, "because man does not
speak his own sentiments in so
ciety, public opinion is t lie chief
cause of his unhappiness."
The questions of human happi
ness and the nature of man were
central issues in Rousseau's phil
osophy. His "search" awareness
was both a source of his anguish
and patient resignation. For him
there were two ideal types of
man, natural and social.
May stated that Rousseau's
"natural man" found happiness
in a pure state of nature; while
his "social man" was forced to
reconcile individual self-interest
with the collective will of society.
The enlightenment philosopher
was disillusioned at the discovery
of the fact that his ideal social
man could never become a reality.
Because of injustice and corrup
tion. man could never be free in
society.
"Public opinion." indicated May,
"sublimates individualism." This
is why Rousseau felt the social
environment reduces the human
personality and sense of inde
pendence.
According to May, Rousseau
suffered a persecution complex
because ho felt that society pre
vented his moral perfection as an
individual. May said that it was
ironical how destiny worked
against the architect of the Social
('ontract.
POINTING TO Rousseau as a
sociologist and the first alienated
man from modern society, Pro
fessor May asserted that "educa
tion should recreate the ideal
man, but instead it alienated the
individual from society."
