# What Now At Cal?

### 
\ good many students at the University of
California are bitterly disappointed over Friday's
ruling by the Regents with regard to on-eampus
political activity.
While liberalizing present rules on member
ship solicitation and fund raising, the Regents'
statement ignored a number of recommendations
.from student and faculty groups regarding the
disciplining ol students for advocating illegal
political or social action.
We cannot help sharing in the student dis
appointment, for we feel that some ol the recom
mendations, particularly those of the ASUC Sen
ate, were a good basis for a reasonable compro
mise which would have satisfied most parties
concerned.
Hut the decision was made, and now the sev -
eral student groups are asking, in varied degrees
of bewilderment, "Where do we go from here?"
A realistic appraisal of the Friday ruling re
veals, we think, that the situation is not nearly
so hopeless as it may at first have seemed.
It is true that the more militant wings of the
Free Speech Movement, led primarily by Mario
Savio, will not get the University to withdraw
completely from disciplining students for advo
cating illegal action.
As President ('lark Kerr made clear in Fri

day's press conference, "... they are not willing i
to accept any regulation. ... 1 don't expect that
there will be a policy developed by the Roard
of Regents now or later that will meet demands
we consider so extreme."
But beside prohibiting political activity lead- !
ing to "unlawful off-campus action, the Regents j
statement has left a good deal up to Kerr in set
ting down specific rules and regulations.
Campus facilities where the newly-allowed j
political activity can take place have yet to be
selected and rules regarding their use defined, j
And although students advocating off-campus ac
tion may still be subject to discipline, just when
they shall be punished and by what procedures
has yet to be worked out.
There is every indication that Ken - deliber
ately asked the Roard of Regents for only the
most general policy statement, leaving him lee
way to work out an agreement on specifies that
would satisfy most student groups.
Thus students, in deciding "where to go from
here," should adopt a policy which takes the
continued flexibility of the situation into account.
Lines of battle should not hastily be drawn and
opinions quickly hardened, for a satisfactory
compromise may still be possible.
We wish the students at Berkeley every suc
cess.

\ good many students at the University of
California are bitterly disappointed over Friday's
ruling by the Regents with regard to on-eampus
political activity.
While liberalizing present rules on member
ship solicitation and fund raising, the Regents'
statement ignored a number of recommendations
.from student and faculty groups regarding the
disciplining ol students for advocating illegal

It is true that the more militant wings of the
Free Speech Movement, led primarily by Mario

ing to "unlawful off-campus action, the Regents j
statement has left a good deal up to Kerr in set
ting down specific rules and regulations.
Campus facilities where the newly-allowed j
political activity can take place have yet to be
selected and rules regarding their use defined, j
