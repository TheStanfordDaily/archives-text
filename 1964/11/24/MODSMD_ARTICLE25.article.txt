## LASSU Absentees Criticized 
### 
Dear Sir:
At a recent LASSU meeting, a
quarum call was initiated in order
to slop consideration of a pending
question, and succeeded in forcing
the meetings adjournment. We
wish to state our support of the
right of a minority to protect it
self in the circumstances that
majority representation is not
achieved. We should instead lay
blame on two other groups Tor the
curtailing of meetings, and the ar
bitrary halting of considerations
important to the student body.
The first of these two groups
consists of those members of
LASSU who do not attend the
meetings. These people, in seeking
election, must accept the respon

sibility of the representation of
their constituency. All too many
of LASSU representatives attend
only often enough to inhibit their
expulsion from the organization.
To them falls the blame of meet
ings convened on shallow majori
j ties.
The second group consists of
' those representatives who report
1 for roll call, and then leave, allow
! ing a majority to be lost, and the
| quorum call adjournment to suc
ceed. In the first place such people
i allow a false majority to decide
the issues before LASSU, until a
i quorum call is made. In the sec
ond place, they arbitrarily limit
| the consideration of business in
j the following way. They remain at

a meeting until all legislation they ;
consider important is dealt with, ;
and then leave. Those sponsors,
unfortunate enough to be placed
late in the orders of the day. have
to listen to the points of view of ■
these inconsiderate few, and yet I
are not given equal hearing. Such
representation, we can only con
sider hypocritical.

Dear Sir:
There was a sudden clatter of j
cof fee cups yesterday morning j
at. the reading of your letter on:
the Stanford woman, and 1 felt i
compelled to reply.
Perhaps your technique is!
wrong, Mr. Meservey. If you in
sist upon pinching a woman's
hand in a vice or hanging your
arm over her shoulder as if it
were a back rest (and letting your j
hand dangle precariously, I might
add) or pushing her through |
crowds like a grocery cart instead >
of leading the way yourself, then
obviously she's going to be frigid,
because she's playing the part of
a piece of furniture. Perhaps you i
approach her from a different di-1
rection: early on your date you i
grab her hands, surround her
with arms, etc. to oveivvhclm her. j
Perhaps you even cut out the!
handholding preliminaries to save
time. Or maybe you employ the
technique which all women dread,
that of the Creeping Hand.
On the contrary, sir, YOU treat i
US like chairs or garbage cans to i
be rummaged. In short, if you
want Stanford women to be spe
cial, you must treat them as spe
cial. And you might try brush
ing your teeth once in a while,
too.

Dear Sir:
I found myself after the Big
Game with two ailments — one
unexpected. In addition to the
raw throat, I had a disturbed con
science and a strong feeling of
disappointment in the student I
body with which 1 had just spent
the last few hours screaming.
After a display of some of the
best spirit I have ever seen on
the Farm, the rooting section was
led bv Cook and his men in two
"clever" and almost back to back
yells, "Cal—Go Demonstrate!"
and "Cal—Football Or Sit-in?"
The latter was justifiably booed
by the majority of the game's non
student patrons.
To be renowned as the m os t
apathetic campus among the,
scholastic "giants" of the coun
try is one thing, bill to display a
pride in this distinction is appall-j
i ing.

Dear Sir:
At a recent LASSU meeting, a
quarum call was initiated in order
to slop consideration of a pending
question, and succeeded in forcing
the meetings adjournment. We
wish to state our support of the
right of a minority to protect it
self in the circumstances that
majority representation is not
achieved. We should instead lay
blame on two other groups Tor the
curtailing of meetings, and the ar
bitrary halting of considerations
important to the student body.
The first of these two groups
consists of those members of
LASSU who do not attend the
meetings. These people, in seeking
election, must accept the respon

sibility of the representation of
their constituency. All too many
of LASSU representatives attend
only often enough to inhibit their
expulsion from the organization.
To them falls the blame of meet
ings convened on shallow majori
j ties.
The second group consists of
' those representatives who report
1 for roll call, and then leave, allow
! ing a majority to be lost, and the
| quorum call adjournment to suc
ceed. In the first place such people
i allow a false majority to decide
the issues before LASSU, until a
i quorum call is made. In the sec

j the following way. They remain at

a meeting until all legislation they ;
consider important is dealt with, ;
and then leave. Those sponsors,
unfortunate enough to be placed

Dear Sir:
There was a sudden clatter of j
cof fee cups yesterday morning j
at. the reading of your letter on:
the Stanford woman, and 1 felt i
compelled to reply.
Perhaps your technique is!
wrong, Mr. Meservey. If you in
sist upon pinching a woman's
hand in a vice or hanging your
arm over her shoulder as if it
were a back rest (and letting your j
hand dangle precariously, I might
add) or pushing her through |
crowds like a grocery cart instead >
of leading the way yourself, then
obviously she's going to be frigid,
because she's playing the part of
a piece of furniture. Perhaps you i
approach her from a different di-1
rection: early on your date you i
grab her hands, surround her
with arms, etc. to oveivvhclm her. j
Perhaps you even cut out the!
handholding preliminaries to save
time. Or maybe you employ the
technique which all women dread,
that of the Creeping Hand.
On the contrary, sir, YOU treat i
US like chairs or garbage cans to i
be rummaged. In short, if you
want Stanford women to be spe
cial, you must treat them as spe
cial. And you might try brush
