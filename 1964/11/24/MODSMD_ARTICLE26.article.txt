# SPIRIT OF '76:
## Daily Reluctantly Opposes Declaration' Of Congress 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Paging through back issues of
The Daily, we found the follow
ing editorial, a hard-hitting com
mentary by "The Not-Yet-Con
reived State of California's Only
Morning Newspaper" on the re
cent events in the nearby United
States:
JULY 5, 1776:
There is a Declaration being
circulated here today by the so
called "Friends of the Second Con
tinental Congress of the United
States of America." As much as
we agree with many of its asser
tions, we feel constrained to ex
press our cynicism (whoops, mis
print; skepticismi about this
document.
First, let us assure one and all
that we find much that is admir
able in this declaration. The
rights of the citizenry should bo
expanded so as to preclude such
evils as taxation without repre
sentation and the arbitrary cur
tailment of freedom of speech and
petition by the Administration of
King George 111.
IT IS TRUE that the "abuses
and usurpations" that the Decla
ration charges to the king ably
substantiate the conclusion that
his objective is "the establishment
of an absolute tyranny" over
those states.
However, we quite simply can
not urge our readers to support
this Declaration. Such action on
our part could be construed as
tacit approval of those factions
in control of the Congress, fac
tions whose reckless militancy
has already been demonstrated
on the bloody fields of Lexington
and Bunker Hill.
Moreover, the leadership of
tlvse factions has openly sym
pathized with such rabble rousers

as Samuel and John Adams and
Patrick Henry ("Give me liberty
or give me death," indeed!) It was
these agitators who precipitated
the infamous Tea Party disguis
ing their hordes as HUD Indians,
no less as well as that tragic
demonstration commonly called
the Boston Massacre.
Indeed, the whole document re
flects the inflammatory ram
blings of the British atheist
Thomas Paine as expressed in his
blueprint for "creeping Consti
tutionalism." the pamphlet Com
mon Sense.
SUCH LEADERSHIP can only
bring painful turmoil to the
American scene; its excessive
militancy can only provoke vio
lence, not the desired administra
tive reforms.
It is true that Ihe Declaration
says nothing about the rabble
rousers the Minutemen, the
Sons of Liberty and Ethan Allen's
Green Mountain Boys among
them; however, it must be noted
that this resolution was only
adopted after rebel leaders T. Jef
ferson and B. Franklin had ad
dressed the Congress. Signifi
cantly, George 111 did not have a
representative at the convention,
which leads us to conclude that
the instigators of this Declara
tion did not hear both sides of
the argument.
Again, we wish to concur with
the sentiments expressed In the
Declaration. We think lhat ex
tremism in the defense of liberty
in question is our liberty. But
since it's only (heir liberty, we re
luctantly but piously urge our
readers to keep drinking East In
dian tea and ignore these rabble
rousers.

Paging through back issues of
The Daily, we found the follow
ing editorial, a hard-hitting com
mentary by "The Not-Yet-Con
reived State of California's Only
Morning Newspaper" on the re
cent events in the nearby United
States:
JULY 5, 1776:
There is a Declaration being
circulated here today by the so
called "Friends of the Second Con
tinental Congress of the United
States of America." As much as
we agree with many of its asser
tions, we feel constrained to ex
press our cynicism (whoops, mis
print; skepticismi about this
document.
First, let us assure one and all
that we find much that is admir
able in this declaration. The
rights of the citizenry should bo
expanded so as to preclude such
evils as taxation without repre
sentation and the arbitrary cur
tailment of freedom of speech and
petition by the Administration of
King George 111.
IT IS TRUE that the "abuses
and usurpations" that the Decla
ration charges to the king ably
substantiate the conclusion that
his objective is "the establishment
of an absolute tyranny" over
those states.
However, we quite simply can
not urge our readers to support
this Declaration. Such action on
our part could be construed as
tacit approval of those factions
in control of the Congress, fac
tions whose reckless militancy
has already been demonstrated
on the bloody fields of Lexington
and Bunker Hill.
Moreover, the leadership of
tlvse factions has openly sym
pathized with such rabble rousers

as Samuel and John Adams and
Patrick Henry ("Give me liberty
or give me death," indeed!) It was
these agitators who precipitated
the infamous Tea Party disguis
ing their hordes as HUD Indians,
no less as well as that tragic
demonstration commonly called
the Boston Massacre.
Indeed, the whole document re
flects the inflammatory ram
blings of the British atheist
Thomas Paine as expressed in his
blueprint for "creeping Consti
tutionalism." the pamphlet Com
mon Sense.
SUCH LEADERSHIP can only
bring painful turmoil to the
American scene; its excessive
militancy can only provoke vio
lence, not the desired administra
tive reforms.
It is true that Ihe Declaration
says nothing about the rabble
rousers the Minutemen, the
Sons of Liberty and Ethan Allen's
Green Mountain Boys among
them; however, it must be noted
that this resolution was only
adopted after rebel leaders T. Jef
ferson and B. Franklin had ad
dressed the Congress. Signifi
cantly, George 111 did not have a
representative at the convention,
which leads us to conclude that
the instigators of this Declara
tion did not hear both sides of
the argument.
Again, we wish to concur with
the sentiments expressed In the
Declaration. We think lhat ex
tremism in the defense of liberty
in question is our liberty. But
since it's only (heir liberty, we re
luctantly but piously urge our
readers to keep drinking East In
dian tea and ignore these rabble
rousers.
