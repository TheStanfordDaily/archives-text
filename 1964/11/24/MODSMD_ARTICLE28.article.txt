# Today and Tomorrow
## Strength, Accommodation Needed In China Policy 
### Walter Lippmann 
A few days ago the President said that the next task of the
Western Alliance was to build bridges to Eastern Europe. He was
not making a new proposal, lie was in fact giving public approval
to the policies of Germany, France and the rest of Western
Europe.

The iron curtain, which for"
some 20 years has so stringently
separated Eastern from Western
Europe, is being penetrated from
both sides, an d t here are now
strong reasons to hope and be
lieve that a movement is under
way which will lead to the reuni
fication of Germany in the next
10 or 20 years and to the Europ
eanization of the whole continent,
including the Soviet Union.
This development in Europe is
as yet a long way from formal
treaties and agreements. But it is
actually taking place, and this,
incidentally, is one of the reasons
why Europeans regard Gold
waterism with such dread and
dismay. The senator threatened
to disrupt and reverse the prog
ress of non-Communist Europe
in reaching an accommodation
with Eastern Europe and with
the Soviet Union itself.
U.S. Influential
This accommodation was not
initiated by the United States.
But the United States can claim
a considerable part of the credit
for it. It has transformed th e
threat of thermonuclear war into
the promise of peace.
American policy toward Europe,
as worked out in the Marshall
Plan, in the organization of NATO
and in liberal trading arrange
ments, backed up by the Amer
ican success in forging ahead in
the race of nuclear armaments,
has played a decisive part in pre
venting war and in preparing the
accommodation which is now un
der way.
It would never have come about,
we must realize fully and must
never forget, had not the Euro
peans known how to revive and
restore themselves. But for the
Europeans, Europe could have
been another Vietnam.
Alliance Not In Disarray
Nobody who knows Europe to
day can accept the notion that the
Western Alliance has fallen apart
and that the European continent
is in disarray. On the contrary,
Europe as a whole is more secure
than it has been in this century,
and its rising prosperity is so
impression that Marxism, which
reflects Ihe miseries of a hundred
years ago. is withering away,
withering even in the Communist
j states themselves.
Fifteen years ago no one would
have dared to believe that this
would be the condition of Europe
today. I remember well the highly
placed officials in Washington
who used to argue fervently that

the Soviet Union must be demo
lished by a preventive war. If
we did not strike while we had a
monopoly of the atomic bomb,
the Soviets would make an atomic
bomb and would demolish us.
These preventive warriors did
not prevail. President Harry Tru
man and President Dwight Eisen
hower would have nothing to do
with preventive war, and the
United Stales became committed
to the course it has followed ever
since. To remain strong enough
to deter Soviet aggression against
the West. This has been done. To
use the wealth and power of the
United States to make stronger
the weak and threatened coun
tries. In Europe, at any rate, this
has been done. And to wait pa
tiently, vigilantly and cautiously
for an eventual accommodation
with the Soviet Union.
Pasl Policy Successful
This policy has been successful,
and it is now beginning to pay
off handsome dividends.
There are, I believe reasons for
believing that, a similar policy,
tailored to the special circum
stances of the Far East, will work
in Asia. Red China is threatening
all its neighbors. It is threatening
every one of them from the Soviet
Union, through Japan, through
Southeast Asia to India. In this
condition a strong and resourceful
diplomacy can work.
Though there is no such formal
alliance as NATO among the
threatened countries in Asia, their
community of interest in contain
ing China is one of the paramount
facts of the world situation.
If Mao can be contained in the
1960's as Stalin was contained in
the 1950'5, it is a reasonable bet
that the small and weak states
in the Chinese borderland, such as
Vietnam, Cambodia and Loas, will
go Titoist—that is to say, they
will find ways to remain inde
| pendent of Chinese domination in
international affairs. It is also a
reasonable bet that China will
come to want coexistence in order
ito live and to grow richer,
i No one can be sure that this is
how the situation in the Far East
! will develop. But, as China is some
[ SOOO miles from ihe United States,
jit. is not a terrifying risk for us
to try to deal with China as we
have dealt with the Soviet Union.
I The results in Europe today are
| a perfect vindication of the wis
dom of Presidents Truman and
Eisenhower when they rejected
ihe call to wage a preventive war.

we did not strike while we had a
monopoly of the atomic bomb,
the Soviets would make an atomic
bomb and would demolish us.
These preventive warriors did
not prevail. President Harry Tru
man and President Dwight Eisen
hower would have nothing to do
with preventive war, and the
United Stales became committed
to the course it has followed ever
since. To remain strong enough
to deter Soviet aggression against
the West. This has been done. To
use the wealth and power of the
United States to make stronger
the weak and threatened coun
tries. In Europe, at any rate, this
has been done. And to wait pa
tiently, vigilantly and cautiously
for an eventual accommodation
with the Soviet Union.
Pasl Policy Successful
This policy has been successful,
and it is now beginning to pay
off handsome dividends.
There are, I believe reasons for
believing that, a similar policy,
tailored to the special circum
stances of the Far East, will work
in Asia. Red China is threatening
all its neighbors. It is threatening
every one of them from the Soviet
Union, through Japan, through
Southeast Asia to India. In this
condition a strong and resourceful
diplomacy can work.
Though there is no such formal
alliance as NATO among the
threatened countries in Asia, their
community of interest in contain
ing China is one of the paramount
facts of the world situation.
If Mao can be contained in the
1960's as Stalin was contained in
the 1950'5, it is a reasonable bet
that the small and weak states
in the Chinese borderland, such as
Vietnam, Cambodia and Loas, will
go Titoist—that is to say, they
will find ways to remain inde
| pendent of Chinese domination in
international affairs. It is also a
reasonable bet that China will
come to want coexistence in order
ito live and to grow richer,
i No one can be sure that this is
how the situation in the Far East
! will develop. But, as China is some
[ SOOO miles from ihe United States,
jit. is not a terrifying risk for us
to try to deal with China as we
have dealt with the Soviet Union.
I The results in Europe today are
| a perfect vindication of the wis
dom of Presidents Truman and
Eisenhower when they rejected
ihe call to wage a preventive war.
A few days ago the President said that the next task of the
Western Alliance was to build bridges to Eastern Europe. He was
not making a new proposal, lie was in fact giving public approval
to the policies of Germany, France and the rest of Western
Europe.

The iron curtain, which for"
some 20 years has so stringently
separated Eastern from Western
Europe, is being penetrated from
both sides, an d t here are now
strong reasons to hope and be
lieve that a movement is under
way which will lead to the reuni
fication of Germany in the next
10 or 20 years and to the Europ
eanization of the whole continent,
including the Soviet Union.
This development in Europe is
as yet a long way from formal
treaties and agreements. But it is
actually taking place, and this,
incidentally, is one of the reasons
why Europeans regard Gold
waterism with such dread and
dismay. The senator threatened
to disrupt and reverse the prog
ress of non-Communist Europe
in reaching an accommodation
with Eastern Europe and with
the Soviet Union itself.
U.S. Influential
This accommodation was not
initiated by the United States.
But the United States can claim
a considerable part of the credit
for it. It has transformed th e
threat of thermonuclear war into
the promise of peace.
American policy toward Europe,
as worked out in the Marshall
Plan, in the organization of NATO
and in liberal trading arrange
ments, backed up by the Amer
ican success in forging ahead in
the race of nuclear armaments,
has played a decisive part in pre
venting war and in preparing the
accommodation which is now un
der way.
It would never have come about,
we must realize fully and must
never forget, had not the Euro
peans known how to revive and
restore themselves. But for the
Europeans, Europe could have
been another Vietnam.
Alliance Not In Disarray
Nobody who knows Europe to
day can accept the notion that the
Western Alliance has fallen apart
and that the European continent
is in disarray. On the contrary,
Europe as a whole is more secure
than it has been in this century,
and its rising prosperity is so
impression that Marxism, which
reflects Ihe miseries of a hundred
years ago. is withering away,
withering even in the Communist
j states themselves.
Fifteen years ago no one would
have dared to believe that this
would be the condition of Europe
today. I remember well the highly
placed officials in Washington
who used to argue fervently that

the Soviet Union must be demo
lished by a preventive war. If

some 20 years has so stringently
separated Eastern from Western
Europe, is being penetrated from
both sides, an d t here are now
strong reasons to hope and be
lieve that a movement is under
way which will lead to the reuni
fication of Germany in the next
10 or 20 years and to the Europ
eanization of the whole continent,
including the Soviet Union.
This development in Europe is
as yet a long way from formal
treaties and agreements. But it is
actually taking place, and this,
incidentally, is one of the reasons
why Europeans regard Gold
waterism with such dread and
dismay. The senator threatened
to disrupt and reverse the prog
ress of non-Communist Europe
in reaching an accommodation
with Eastern Europe and with
the Soviet Union itself.
U.S. Influential
This accommodation was not
initiated by the United States.
But the United States can claim
a considerable part of the credit
for it. It has transformed th e
threat of thermonuclear war into
the promise of peace.
American policy toward Europe,
as worked out in the Marshall
Plan, in the organization of NATO
and in liberal trading arrange
ments, backed up by the Amer
ican success in forging ahead in
the race of nuclear armaments,
has played a decisive part in pre
venting war and in preparing the
accommodation which is now un
der way.
It would never have come about,
we must realize fully and must
never forget, had not the Euro
peans known how to revive and
restore themselves. But for the
Europeans, Europe could have
been another Vietnam.
Alliance Not In Disarray
Nobody who knows Europe to
day can accept the notion that the
Western Alliance has fallen apart
and that the European continent
is in disarray. On the contrary,
Europe as a whole is more secure
than it has been in this century,
and its rising prosperity is so
impression that Marxism, which
reflects Ihe miseries of a hundred
years ago. is withering away,
withering even in the Communist
j states themselves.
Fifteen years ago no one would
have dared to believe that this
would be the condition of Europe
today. I remember well the highly
placed officials in Washington
who used to argue fervently that

the Soviet Union must be demo
lished by a preventive war. If
we did not strike while we had a
monopoly of the atomic bomb,
the Soviets would make an atomic
bomb and would demolish us.
These preventive warriors did
not prevail. President Harry Tru
man and President Dwight Eisen
hower would have nothing to do
with preventive war, and the
United Stales became committed
to the course it has followed ever
since. To remain strong enough
to deter Soviet aggression against
the West. This has been done. To
use the wealth and power of the
United States to make stronger
the weak and threatened coun
tries. In Europe, at any rate, this
has been done. And to wait pa
tiently, vigilantly and cautiously
for an eventual accommodation
with the Soviet Union.
Pasl Policy Successful
This policy has been successful,
and it is now beginning to pay
off handsome dividends.
There are, I believe reasons for
believing that, a similar policy,
tailored to the special circum
stances of the Far East, will work
in Asia. Red China is threatening
all its neighbors. It is threatening
every one of them from the Soviet
Union, through Japan, through
Southeast Asia to India. In this
condition a strong and resourceful
diplomacy can work.
Though there is no such formal
alliance as NATO among the
threatened countries in Asia, their
community of interest in contain
ing China is one of the paramount
facts of the world situation.
If Mao can be contained in the
1960's as Stalin was contained in
the 1950'5, it is a reasonable bet
that the small and weak states
in the Chinese borderland, such as
Vietnam, Cambodia and Loas, will
go Titoist—that is to say, they
will find ways to remain inde
| pendent of Chinese domination in
international affairs. It is also a
reasonable bet that China will
come to want coexistence in order
ito live and to grow richer,
i No one can be sure that this is
how the situation in the Far East
! will develop. But, as China is some
[ SOOO miles from ihe United States,
jit. is not a terrifying risk for us
to try to deal with China as we
have dealt with the Soviet Union.
I The results in Europe today are
| a perfect vindication of the wis
dom of Presidents Truman and
Eisenhower when they rejected
ihe call to wage a preventive war.
A few days ago the President said that the next task of the
Western Alliance was to build bridges to Eastern Europe. He was
not making a new proposal, lie was in fact giving public approval
to the policies of Germany, France and the rest of Western
Europe.
