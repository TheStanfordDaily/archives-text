# Overseas Campus Set-Up: What Are The Objectives?
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
Stanford's establishment of new
overseas campuses in Austria
and England has raised again
questions involved in any discus
sion of the numerous programs
which send countless American
undergraduates abroad each year.
What are the objectives of such
programs? Could they be set up
to provide more immersion in the
culture of a country?
"Cultural immersion is a topic
which is bandied about by many
people without full realization of
what it implies," said Miss Irene
Blumenthal, Assistant Director of
the Overseas Campus Program in
an interview with the Daily.
IN Tin; SENSE of acquaint
ing the student with the total pic

i ture of a country's life and work,
• it cannot be fully achieved except
at the expense of academics
of the time and energy necessary
to be a student anywhere, she
said.
In a university such as Stan
ford, many graduate students go
! overseas on fellowship programs.
I Stanford's campuses abroad are
designed to meet special needs of
the undergraduate, Miss Blumen
thal said.
"There is also need for a dif
ferent type of program, other
! than those provided for the ex
j eeptional undergraduate with
i sufficient linguistic background
1 and capabilities of self-adjustment
I to benefit from attending a Euro
i pean university," she said.

THE MAIN STRENGTH of
; Stanford's program, Miss Blumen
! thai said, is that it permits non-
I humanities majors to go over
seas. "It is precisely these stu
dents with strict programs, who
are planning to go into the profes
sions, who most, need this liberal
izing experience, since unlike hu
[ inanities and arts majors, they
almost never return to Europe as
' graduate students," she said.
Miss Blumenthal pointed out
the disadvantages of placing stu
| dents with families. "One gets to
; know Europeans better when not
forced to deal with them regard
ing the day-to-day mcnialities of
life," Miss Blumenthal remarked.
Practical difficulties overwhelm
the idealistic notions of "growth
lof international understanding."
Moreover, programs find re
cruiting of families difficult on a
long-term basis, as families who
: will take students often do it out
lof primarily mercenary motiva
, tion.
LIVING IN university dormi
tories. another possibility, means
taking up already crowded space
from European students, Miss
Blumenthal pointed out. In addi
tion, attending ;i new university
is very much a cultural break;
adjustment requires more time
when the individual student is on
his own, and the first six months
■ may be taken up with adjustment.
Curriculum presents further
disadvantages outside the obvious
one of getling academic credit for
courses taken. Enrolling at a
European university may just
mean "a summer program for
foreigners"; that is, studies in
language and culture of the
country, with none of the inde
pendent work which is the real
substance of European study,
Miss Blumenthal said.
"Stanford has a short program
to lit academic requirements."
This means that adjustment to
practical difficulties is taken care
of by the program, to allow the
student time for cultural and in
tellectual adjustment, she said.
"THE I'KOGK.VM doesn't pre
tend to be a Junior Year Abroad,
which usually deals only with stu
dents from humanities and so
, cial sciences." Miss Blumenthal
i said.
"When the student returns
from one of Stanford's overseas
campuses, he may not know the
language vcr> well. But he has
struggled to master it and to
communicate; he realizes that
| people can live differently and
still have a good life; that there
are different standards even if
i he doesn't accept them," Miss
