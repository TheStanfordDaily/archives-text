# 200 Stage Sit-In After Cal Free Speech Rally
## NSA Hits Cal Political Bail 
### 
(CPS) The United States Na
tional Student Association has
joined the growing list of organ
izations opposed to a ban on stu
dent political activity on the cam
pus of the University of California
at Berkeley.
In a telegram sent to University
of California President Clark
Kerr, the Association said it
"strongly disagrees" with any
policies which prohibit "the col
lection of funds, the recruitment
of membership, or the planning of
functions for student political and
social organizations."
NSA SAID it supported those
students at Berkeley "who respon
sibly seek recognition of all of
their freedoms to advocate, per
suade, solicit, recruit, and plan
activities for student political and
social organizations on campus."
The statement, which was
issued prior to the resumption of
demonstrations by the Free
Speech Movement (the associa
tion of campus groups protesting
the bant made no mention of the
recent "civil disobedience" pro
tests of it staged by campus po
litical organizations and Cal
teaching assistants.
"IT WAS unfortunate that the
violators of the Berkeley campus
ban were not originally accorded
due process," it said.
NSA also said it was "with deep
regret and grave concern that wo
note that the administration of
the University of California at
Berkeley rejected the recommen
dation of the faculty committee
that the (eight) students (sus
pended as a result of the demon
strations in early Oct.) be imme
diately reinstated pending further
investigat ions."
The recommendation was one
of the first acts of the Academic
Senate's Ad Hoc Committee,
which had been specially formed
to investigate the suspensions
after it was discovered that no
faculty senate committee on stu
dent conduct existed, and was im
mediately rejected by the admin
istration.
The American Civil Liberties
Union has already expressed op
position to the ban, as has the
Berkeley chapter of the American
Association of University Profes
sors. The local AAUP group also
asked its officers "to commu
nicate . . .this matter to Ihe na
tional officers for possible action
bv the national organization."
