Bad News
The newspapers today pick up shocking news from around the world and
blast it across the nation in bold type. Violence, murder, crime, vandalism,
revolution, war (hot and cold), and scandal—these are the subjects which we
read about daily. This constant barrage of bad news can be most disconcerting
In fact, many people live in real fear of crime, violence, and devastating war.
But it is possible to dwell in the midst of all this chaos and confusion without
becoming disturbed and upset. The greatest source of good news, the Bible
says:
"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under
the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my
fortress: my God; in Him will I trust . . . Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence that walk
eth in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand
shall fall at thy side, and then thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not
come nigh thee. . . . Because thou hast made the Lord which is my refuge, even
the most High, thy habitation." Psalm 91
The Bible also tells us of God's great love for mankind and the Gospel
(Good News) of Jesus Christ. "Moreove. brethren, I declare unto you the gospel
. . . how that Christ died for uor sins according to Scripture; And that He was
buried, and that Hp rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; And
that He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve; After that. He was seen of
above five hundred brethren at once;" I Cor. 15:1, 3-6.
Pick up your newspaper today and pick out all the items containing bad
news. You will find plenty of them. Then pick up the Bible and begin to read
the Good News from God. God's Word is very realistic and recognizes the pres
ence of evil and its source. But most important of all, it assures those who
have entrusted their lives to the Lord Jesus Christ that they need have no fear
of evil or trouble. ' Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of
the Lord forever." Psalm 23:4-6.

the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my
fortress: my God; in Him will I trust . . . Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence that walk
eth in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand
shall fall at thy side, and then thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not
come nigh thee. . . . Because thou hast made the Lord which is my refuge, even
the most High, thy habitation." Psalm 91
The Bible also tells us of God's great love for mankind and the Gospel
(Good News) of Jesus Christ. "Moreove. brethren, I declare unto you the gospel
. . . how that Christ died for uor sins according to Scripture; And that He was
buried, and that Hp rose again the third day according to the Scriptures; And
that He was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve; After that. He was seen of
above five hundred brethren at once;" I Cor. 15:1, 3-6.
Pick up your newspaper today and pick out all the items containing bad
news. You will find plenty of them. Then pick up the Bible and begin to read
the Good News from God. God's Word is very realistic and recognizes the pres
ence of evil and its source. But most important of all, it assures those who
have entrusted their lives to the Lord Jesus Christ that they need have no fear
of evil or trouble. ' Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they
comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:
thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and
mercy shall follow all the days of my life; and I will dwell in the house of
the Lord forever." Psalm 23:4-6.

Bad News
The newspapers today pick up shocking news from around the world and
blast it across the nation in bold type. Violence, murder, crime, vandalism,
revolution, war (hot and cold), and scandal—these are the subjects which we
read about daily. This constant barrage of bad news can be most disconcerting
In fact, many people live in real fear of crime, violence, and devastating war.
But it is possible to dwell in the midst of all this chaos and confusion without
becoming disturbed and upset. The greatest source of good news, the Bible
says:
"He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under
the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my
fortress: my God; in Him will I trust . . . Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror
by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day; Nor for the pestilence that walk
eth in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday. A thousand
shall fall at thy side, and then thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not
