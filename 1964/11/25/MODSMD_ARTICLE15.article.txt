Operation Crossroads Africa;
sends nearly 300 students to;

Africa each summer to work part
time in projects involving manual
labor and also to 1 ravel and meet
the leaders of the country in
which the work-project is located.
Last summer six Stanford stu
dents went to Africa under the
auspices of this organization.
Placed with teams of African stu
dents, they worked in five differ
ent countries, Malawi, Tangan
yika. Mauritania, Ghana, and the
Gambia.
NO TWO Crossroads projects
are the same, and individual ex
periences vary tremendously.
One Stanford sludent met Kwane
Nkrumah.
Other Stanford students worked
on projects ranging from the con
struction of a refugee school
for Mazombiquans to working in
a training college for Malawi
youth.
ALTHOUGH the Crossroads
program was conceived with
American Negroes in mind, about
three white students for every Ne
gro participate in the program.
Although ihe total cost per
individual is over $1,700, Cross
roads subsidizes each student for
at least S7(M). The remainder is
raised by the individual students.
Money has been raised by writ
ing newspaper articles and giving
speeches. Last year the partici
pating students were able to raise
a large per cent of their costs
in conjunction with the lIR.

Africa Desk chairman, at DA 6-
