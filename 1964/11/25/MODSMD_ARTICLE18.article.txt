# JAZZ TRACK
## Excellent Jazz At Local Club 
### RICK BALE 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Rick Bale's
program JAZZ TRACK can be
heard on KZSU Thursday eve
nings at seven.
With the abundance of excel
lent jazz now being offered by
San Francisco and the East Bay,
a local club seems to have been
overlooked by the Stanford com
munity.
Located just three miles north
on El Camino, Tin Pan Alley in
Redwood City has over the past
year and a half featured such
big names in jazz as Duke Elling
ton, Count Basie, Mel Tonne,
Buddy Greco, Woody Herman,
and the Stan Getz-Astrud Gilberto
group.
The club, which is restricted to
those over 21, seats about 300. It
has a warm, intimate atmosphere
without too much elbow pushing
or neck straining, drinks are in
expensive, and the acoustics are
very good.
Tremendous Risk
I recently talked with the own
er, Bernie Kalin, who over th e
period of an hour or so outlined
the club's cautious jazz policy.
Starting a jazz establishment in
a little known suburban area
(imagine an Eastern based jazz
man coming out west to play Red
wood City) is a tremendous risk.
Kahn has alleviated much of
this risk by featuring jazz on a
part time basis whereby big
names will appear for one or two
week X'uns followed by a few
weeks of rock and roll oriented
sounds. Kahn is reluctant; to at
tempt to support the club on an
all jazz program with mid penin
sula patronage, and his security
lies in the sure selling dance
music.
Impressive List
The extremely impressive list
of personages that Tin Pan Alley
has booked in the past is a tribute
to the friendly and persuasive per
sonality as well as the hard work
of Kahn. A saxophonist himself
(he is currently playing at the
Circle Star theater) Kahn has
an understanding of the jazz
world and its people, unlike many
businessman owners.
The club is still recovering
from the fantastic ten-day run
of DLike Ellington, and will re
sume jazz with Mel Torme who
opens on December 4th. Count
Basie will follow with a nine-day
run beginning the 12th. Rock and
roll groups with dancing will fol
low for the next month. The
Odyssys will entertain until Janu
ary 3rd, and The Chessmen will
fill out the remainder of that
month.
Kahn has a dozen plans in the
air for February, all of them ex
citing. The fabulous Maynard
Ferguson band (decibel kings of
jazz) figures as a good probabil
ity. To book this group would be
quite an accomplishment, as it.
would mean that Ferguson would
make his West Coast debut in
Redwood City.
Other Possibilities
Cat Tjader also is possible, but
he could very probably be over
exposed after his month run at
San Francisco's El Matador ends
in the middle of January. The
Harry James band (which has
the veteran great Buddy Rich
on drums currently), Stan Ken
ton, and Vinee Guaraldi, all
could figure in future plans.
If student interest is high
enough, there is an excellent
chance that Kahn might initiate
a student reduced rate plan simi
lar to that at the Village Gate in
New York City.
Yusef Lateef will open tonight

at the Jazz Workshop where Art
Blakey has just finished a week
run. Lateef was known during
the 40's as Bill Evans (not to be
confused with the pianist Bill
Evans) and played saxophone
with the Dizzy Gillespie group
among others.
Name Ciianged
After changing his name in the
early fifties, he settled in Detroit
and began to explore the relation
of jazz to Middle Eastern sounds
and seales, and over the years
has taken "jazz" through a va
riety of odd instruments such as
the argol and earthboard as well
as the more familiar bottle and
balloon. He will probably open

the Workshop engagement on
oboe.
Sonny Rollins will open at
Basin Street West this evening,
following the long run of Jon
Hendricks. The saxophonist has
been erratic in his style develop
ment over the past twenty years,
changing his approach violently
and often. Rollins however is a
major force in jazz and one of its
more exciting performers.
Other doings: Jean Hoffman's
stay at the Trident in Sausalito
has been extended due to the tre
mendous response, and she will
remain throughout December.
Vinee Guaraldi and Bola Sete go
into their second week at the El
Matador.

With the abundance of excel
lent jazz now being offered by
San Francisco and the East Bay,
a local club seems to have been
overlooked by the Stanford com
munity.
Located just three miles north
on El Camino, Tin Pan Alley in
Redwood City has over the past
year and a half featured such
big names in jazz as Duke Elling
ton, Count Basie, Mel Tonne,
Buddy Greco, Woody Herman,
and the Stan Getz-Astrud Gilberto
group.
The club, which is restricted to
those over 21, seats about 300. It
has a warm, intimate atmosphere
without too much elbow pushing
or neck straining, drinks are in
expensive, and the acoustics are
very good.
Tremendous Risk
I recently talked with the own
er, Bernie Kalin, who over th e
period of an hour or so outlined
the club's cautious jazz policy.
Starting a jazz establishment in
a little known suburban area
(imagine an Eastern based jazz
man coming out west to play Red
wood City) is a tremendous risk.
Kahn has alleviated much of
this risk by featuring jazz on a
part time basis whereby big
names will appear for one or two
week X'uns followed by a few
weeks of rock and roll oriented
sounds. Kahn is reluctant; to at
tempt to support the club on an
all jazz program with mid penin
sula patronage, and his security
lies in the sure selling dance
music.
Impressive List
The extremely impressive list
of personages that Tin Pan Alley
has booked in the past is a tribute
to the friendly and persuasive per
sonality as well as the hard work
of Kahn. A saxophonist himself
(he is currently playing at the
Circle Star theater) Kahn has
an understanding of the jazz
world and its people, unlike many
businessman owners.
The club is still recovering
from the fantastic ten-day run
of DLike Ellington, and will re
sume jazz with Mel Torme who
opens on December 4th. Count
Basie will follow with a nine-day
run beginning the 12th. Rock and
roll groups with dancing will fol
low for the next month. The
Odyssys will entertain until Janu
ary 3rd, and The Chessmen will
fill out the remainder of that
month.
Kahn has a dozen plans in the
air for February, all of them ex
citing. The fabulous Maynard
Ferguson band (decibel kings of
jazz) figures as a good probabil
ity. To book this group would be
quite an accomplishment, as it.
would mean that Ferguson would
make his West Coast debut in
Redwood City.
Other Possibilities
Cat Tjader also is possible, but
he could very probably be over
exposed after his month run at
San Francisco's El Matador ends
in the middle of January. The
Harry James band (which has
the veteran great Buddy Rich
on drums currently), Stan Ken
ton, and Vinee Guaraldi, all
could figure in future plans.
If student interest is high
enough, there is an excellent
chance that Kahn might initiate
a student reduced rate plan simi
lar to that at the Village Gate in
New York City.
Yusef Lateef will open tonight

at the Jazz Workshop where Art
Blakey has just finished a week
run. Lateef was known during
the 40's as Bill Evans (not to be
confused with the pianist Bill
Evans) and played saxophone
with the Dizzy Gillespie group
among others.
Name Ciianged
After changing his name in the
early fifties, he settled in Detroit
and began to explore the relation
of jazz to Middle Eastern sounds
and seales, and over the years
has taken "jazz" through a va
riety of odd instruments such as
the argol and earthboard as well
as the more familiar bottle and
balloon. He will probably open

the Workshop engagement on
oboe.
Sonny Rollins will open at
Basin Street West this evening,
following the long run of Jon
Hendricks. The saxophonist has
been erratic in his style develop
ment over the past twenty years,
changing his approach violently
and often. Rollins however is a
major force in jazz and one of its
more exciting performers.
Other doings: Jean Hoffman's
stay at the Trident in Sausalito
has been extended due to the tre
mendous response, and she will
remain throughout December.
Vinee Guaraldi and Bola Sete go

mendous response, and she will
remain throughout December.
Vinee Guaraldi and Bola Sete go
into their second week at the El
Matador.
EDITOR'S NOTE: Rick Bale's
program JAZZ TRACK can be
heard on KZSU Thursday eve
nings at seven.
With the abundance of excel
lent jazz now being offered by
San Francisco and the East Bay,
a local club seems to have been
overlooked by the Stanford com
munity.
Located just three miles north
on El Camino, Tin Pan Alley in
Redwood City has over the past
year and a half featured such
big names in jazz as Duke Elling
ton, Count Basie, Mel Tonne,
Buddy Greco, Woody Herman,
and the Stan Getz-Astrud Gilberto
group.
The club, which is restricted to
those over 21, seats about 300. It
has a warm, intimate atmosphere
without too much elbow pushing
or neck straining, drinks are in
expensive, and the acoustics are
very good.
Tremendous Risk
I recently talked with the own
er, Bernie Kalin, who over th e
period of an hour or so outlined
the club's cautious jazz policy.
Starting a jazz establishment in
a little known suburban area
(imagine an Eastern based jazz
man coming out west to play Red
wood City) is a tremendous risk.
Kahn has alleviated much of
this risk by featuring jazz on a
part time basis whereby big
names will appear for one or two
week X'uns followed by a few
weeks of rock and roll oriented
sounds. Kahn is reluctant; to at
tempt to support the club on an
all jazz program with mid penin
sula patronage, and his security
lies in the sure selling dance
music.
Impressive List
The extremely impressive list
of personages that Tin Pan Alley
has booked in the past is a tribute
to the friendly and persuasive per
sonality as well as the hard work
of Kahn. A saxophonist himself
(he is currently playing at the
Circle Star theater) Kahn has
an understanding of the jazz
world and its people, unlike many
businessman owners.
The club is still recovering
from the fantastic ten-day run
of DLike Ellington, and will re
sume jazz with Mel Torme who
opens on December 4th. Count
Basie will follow with a nine-day
run beginning the 12th. Rock and
roll groups with dancing will fol
low for the next month. The
Odyssys will entertain until Janu
ary 3rd, and The Chessmen will
fill out the remainder of that
month.
Kahn has a dozen plans in the
air for February, all of them ex
citing. The fabulous Maynard
Ferguson band (decibel kings of
jazz) figures as a good probabil
ity. To book this group would be
quite an accomplishment, as it.
would mean that Ferguson would
make his West Coast debut in
Redwood City.
Other Possibilities
Cat Tjader also is possible, but
he could very probably be over
exposed after his month run at
San Francisco's El Matador ends
in the middle of January. The
Harry James band (which has
the veteran great Buddy Rich
on drums currently), Stan Ken
ton, and Vinee Guaraldi, all
could figure in future plans.
If student interest is high
enough, there is an excellent
chance that Kahn might initiate
a student reduced rate plan simi
lar to that at the Village Gate in
New York City.
Yusef Lateef will open tonight

at the Jazz Workshop where Art
Blakey has just finished a week
run. Lateef was known during
the 40's as Bill Evans (not to be
confused with the pianist Bill
Evans) and played saxophone
with the Dizzy Gillespie group
among others.
Name Ciianged
After changing his name in the
early fifties, he settled in Detroit
and began to explore the relation
of jazz to Middle Eastern sounds
and seales, and over the years
has taken "jazz" through a va
riety of odd instruments such as
the argol and earthboard as well
as the more familiar bottle and
balloon. He will probably open

the Workshop engagement on
oboe.
Sonny Rollins will open at
Basin Street West this evening,
following the long run of Jon
Hendricks. The saxophonist has
been erratic in his style develop
ment over the past twenty years,
changing his approach violently
and often. Rollins however is a
major force in jazz and one of its
more exciting performers.
Other doings: Jean Hoffman's
stay at the Trident in Sausalito
has been extended due to the tre
mendous response, and she will
remain throughout December.
Vinee Guaraldi and Bola Sete go
into their second week at the El
Matador.
