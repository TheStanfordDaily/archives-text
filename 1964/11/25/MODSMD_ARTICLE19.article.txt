### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
THEATER
LUTHER is John (Angry Young Man) Osborne's play about the
founder of the Protestant Reformation. Opening at the Geary in San
Francisco next Monday, it is almost as much concerned with Luther's
constipation as with his theology.
SOUTH PACIFIC, the classic Rodgers-Hammerstein-Logan mu
sical, opened last night at Burlingame's Hyatt Houge Theatre. Star
ring Howard Keel and Jane A. Johnston, it tells of the romance
between a middle-aged French planter and a young American nurse
against the background of World War 11.
SIGHTS ANI) SOUNDS is Nat King Cole's revue which opened
at the Circle Star Theatre last night. The Merry Young Souls, a
singing group, and comedian Ronnie Martin are also in the show.
THE COUNTRY WIFE is William Wycherley's bawdy Restora
tion comedy which will open on Friday at the Marines' in San Fran
ciseo. An Actor's Workshop production, its direction is by Robert
Symonds and Elizabeth Huddle has the title role; both are quite
talented Workshop regulars.
THE FANTASTICKS is still running at the Little Fox in San
Francisco. This marvelously whismsical musical is regrettably limit
ed to Adults Only at all shows but the Sunday matinee.
HERE'S LOVE features Santa Claus and Meredith Willson songs
i at San Francisco's Curran.
FILMS

Mercouri and is directed by Jules ("Rififi") Dassin.
THAT MAN FROM RIO and ONE, TWO. THREE are a pair of
