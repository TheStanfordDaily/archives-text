# Cal Vandals Hit New High In Damages
## Big Game Leaves Wake Of Repairs 
### 
Thc bill for this year's Cal
pranks will run from $500 to $600
according to Elbridge Bacon, Jr.,
Director of the Stanford Physical
Plant.
This is roughly twice the usual
cost and represents a five year
high for I lie Berkeley Mafia.
TIIE MONEY to repair any
damage done to the University
from pranks comes out of a Van
dalism Fund, which is part of the
ground maintenance budget at
.Stanford. No limit is set for the
fund.
These pranks included dying
"Mem Claw" gold and the remain
ing two fountains blue, inscrib
ing ''Cal" in blue and gold on the
church bells and robbing the
tower of one bell.
The most costly prank, how
ever, was the defamation of the
Bookstore, the Western Civ Li
brary and the benches of White
Memorial Fountain Friday night.
IT WILL cost approximately
$250 and take two days to erase
the remarks. "We've had nothing
like this before." Bacon said. "A
little vandalism you expect and
live with, but the bells and the
bookstore is going a bit too far."
Three men worked three hours
Monday to restore the bell to its
position 00 feet up. It probably
took the Cal students at least two
hours to remove the bell, Bacon
commented, which shows what a
little enthusiasm can accomplish.
Bacon reported that it will cost
from $30 to $40 to "redye" each
fountain. Since May, $500 has
been spent cleaning dye and
soap suds out of Stanford's three
fountains.
THE PRANKS are investigated
by the police, who file a malicious
mischief report with the County
Sheriff and the Cal Dean of Stu
dents.
