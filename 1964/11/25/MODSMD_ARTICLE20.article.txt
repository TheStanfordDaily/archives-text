## 'Green Eyes' Delicate Film 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
She's not very pretty: her mouth
is too big, her eyes are huge, and
her nose looks like a ski slope.
But she is beautiful.
She is Rita Tushingham, and
she has answered the "What
next?" question that everyone
who saw her stunning cinematic
debut in "A Taste Of Honey" was
asking. "Girl With Green Eyes" is
what's next, and her performance
is in no way an anticlimax!
Again she is a bewildered, ro
mantic and lonely girl (the novel
on which the film is based is "The
Lonely Girl") searching for love
and tenderness. She meets a mid
dle-aged author (Peter Finch) and
develops a crush on him. He in
turn is amused by her; when, in
.their second accidental meeting,
he sees her leading F. Scott Fitz
gerald, he tells her "You'll like
that: it's melancholy."
Relationship Grows
Their next meeting is not acci
dental she invites him to tea.
Needless to say, their relation
ship grows. "Will we always be
friends?" she asks. "Not if
become lovers," he replies. But
they do become lovers.
He takes her to his country
house on weekends. The first time
she sleeps in the guest, bedroom.
The next time she comes into his
bedroom and climbs into his bed;
but she has been educated in a
convent, and can not bring herself
to have sexual intercourse with
him.
Eventually, of course, she lioes
submit and comes to live with
him. Her father takes her home,-
j shocked at her illicit
At home the local priest comes to
speak to her and she runs from
I him back to her lover.
Relationship Dulls
I Her father comes again, but
is driven off by the housekeeper
with a shotgun. But soon her j
"mixture of innocence and guile" !
wears thin for him. She thinks I
that he is neglecting her and feels j
out of place with his friends. |
They fight and make up. They;
fight again. They part and go j
away — he to his wife from
whom he is separated, she (older
! and, yes, wiser) to new friends
and new experiences.
It all sounds terribly trite. And,
in a way, it is. But Edna O'Brien's
I sensitive screenplay (from her
own novel). John Addison's tender]
music, and Manny Wynn's beauti
ful black-and-white photography j
of Dublin and the Irish country
side convince the viewer that he

{the film. Particularly effective is ;
j his use of a montage-like device to !
, indicate the passage of time. And 1

STARS-R itci Tushingham and Peter Finch appear in a
tender scene from "Girl With Green Eyes," the bittersweet
British film now at the Paris. Featured in the movie, which
was produced by Tony Richardson (the director of "Tom
Jones") is Lynn Redgrave.
She's not very pretty: her mouth
is too big, her eyes are huge, and
her nose looks like a ski slope.
But she is beautiful.
She is Rita Tushingham, and
she has answered the "What
next?" question that everyone
who saw her stunning cinematic
debut in "A Taste Of Honey" was
asking. "Girl With Green Eyes" is
what's next, and her performance
is in no way an anticlimax!
Again she is a bewildered, ro
mantic and lonely girl (the novel
on which the film is based is "The
Lonely Girl") searching for love
and tenderness. She meets a mid
dle-aged author (Peter Finch) and
develops a crush on him. He in
turn is amused by her; when, in
.their second accidental meeting,
he sees her leading F. Scott Fitz
gerald, he tells her "You'll like
that: it's melancholy."

they do become lovers.
He takes her to his country

she sleeps in the guest, bedroom.
The next time she comes into his
bedroom and climbs into his bed;

convent, and can not bring herself
to have sexual intercourse with
him.
Eventually, of course, she lioes

him. Her father takes her home,-
