## Jordan Lauds Olympic Athletes 
### PETE EAKLAND 
The Olympic Games are the spectacular of spori. No other single
; athletic competition in the world brings together so many talented
! athletes or has so much meaningful and colorful pageantry.
This year, Stanford's head track and field coach, Payton Jordan,
had the honor to he an assistant coach on ihc U.S. Olympic Track
Team in charge of the runners and weight men. He returned to
Stanford early this month and, although he has experienced many
! sporting thrills both as a competitor and as a participant and expects
' more, he said he has never enjoyed any compeition more.
Jordan considered this year's games the best organized he has
I seen in more than thirty years of watching Olympic action and also
| said tlioy contained the finest competition ever.
JAPAN HOSTS GAMES
Japan, ihc host of the first Olympiad to be held on the Asian
| continent, spent much time, effort, and money to insure the success
of the XVIII Olympiad. Holders of a strong artistic sense, the Jap
anese planned lavish ceremonies, which were always moving, never
| overdone. The opening ceremony which consisted of the releasing
of doves, of the sky-writing of the five Olympic circles, the lighting
of the Olympic torch, and the opening procession was a sight Jordan
says he will not soon forget. As in previous Olympiads, Jordan said,
"The Games had a tremendous impact on the counlry where it was
i held." Although the Japanese did poorly, they were very, very kind
i and sought out the outstanding athletes to congratulate them.
But the Olympics are primarily competition. The ultimate cham
. pions are the ones who become excited and stimulated by the ten
| sion and do not let it eat away at them. One reason the U.S. squad
j pulled the surprises that it did was the excellent attitude and esprit
de corps that permeated it.
GOOD SQUAD ATTITUDE
The athletes Jordan had charge of were always looking for help
and were appreciative of it. The attitude was, "What can I do,
coach?" not. "I'm ready. I think I'll take it easy." Limiting factors
! such as injuries presented themselves, but the athletes did not accept
1 them and rose above them.
Jordan considers Bob Hayes the outstanding participant for Ihc
| track squad. For the 100 meters, he ran fantastic times of 10.0 and
I 9.9 seconds in heats and the finals.
Pressure and intense competition bring out the best in some
people. To Billy Mills and A 1 Oerter who had painful injuries, ihe
| competition was just as much a test of courage as of ability.
! Oerter, who had a turn cartilage in his rib, could hardly walk or
bend over without pain. Asked if he thought it might be better to
scratch, he said, "I came here to compete." Not only did he com
j pete, he set a new Olympic record in the discus. Jordan calls it
"The greatest display of courage under adverse conditions at ihe
Games."
Then there's the story of Billy Mills, who helped wreck the for
! eign monopoly of the long-distance events by winning the 10,000
meter run. He had trouble with his arches and had to wear special
shoes and even then could barely run. The coaches were doubtful
that he would be able to participate, but Mills assured them, "Don't
worry. I'll be able to go."
Quite expectedly, Jordan is a 100 per cent supporter of the
Olympic Games and always has been. Sports are a vital and im-
I port ant part of the interchange of nations. Through them, we gain
! respect for one another. They can help solve problems and indif
! ference. In their way, they contribute much to world understanding."
| The nations benefit by sending representatives to the Olympic
Games, but the individuals probably gain the most. "The (James
are one of ihe most meaningful and wholesome occasions in a man's
life."
i Jordan expects the U.S. team to be equally strong in the nexi
j Olympiad. "We may not be much stronger but we will improve
! numerically. We must sit on complacency."

of the XVIII Olympiad. Holders of a strong artistic sense, the Jap
anese planned lavish ceremonies, which were always moving, never

of doves, of the sky-writing of the five Olympic circles, the lighting
of the Olympic torch, and the opening procession was a sight Jordan
says he will not soon forget. As in previous Olympiads, Jordan said,
"The Games had a tremendous impact on the counlry where it was

i and sought out the outstanding athletes to congratulate them.
But the Olympics are primarily competition. The ultimate cham
. pions are the ones who become excited and stimulated by the ten

j pulled the surprises that it did was the excellent attitude and esprit
de corps that permeated it.
GOOD SQUAD ATTITUDE
The athletes Jordan had charge of were always looking for help
and were appreciative of it. The attitude was, "What can I do,
coach?" not. "I'm ready. I think I'll take it easy." Limiting factors
! such as injuries presented themselves, but the athletes did not accept
1 them and rose above them.
Jordan considers Bob Hayes the outstanding participant for Ihc
| track squad. For the 100 meters, he ran fantastic times of 10.0 and
I 9.9 seconds in heats and the finals.
Pressure and intense competition bring out the best in some
people. To Billy Mills and A 1 Oerter who had painful injuries, ihe
| competition was just as much a test of courage as of ability.
! Oerter, who had a turn cartilage in his rib, could hardly walk or
bend over without pain. Asked if he thought it might be better to
scratch, he said, "I came here to compete." Not only did he com
j pete, he set a new Olympic record in the discus. Jordan calls it
"The greatest display of courage under adverse conditions at ihe
Games."
Then there's the story of Billy Mills, who helped wreck the for
! eign monopoly of the long-distance events by winning the 10,000
meter run. He had trouble with his arches and had to wear special
shoes and even then could barely run. The coaches were doubtful
that he would be able to participate, but Mills assured them, "Don't
worry. I'll be able to go."
Quite expectedly, Jordan is a 100 per cent supporter of the
Olympic Games and always has been. Sports are a vital and im-
I port ant part of the interchange of nations. Through them, we gain
! respect for one another. They can help solve problems and indif
! ference. In their way, they contribute much to world understanding."
| The nations benefit by sending representatives to the Olympic
Games, but the individuals probably gain the most. "The (James
are one of ihe most meaningful and wholesome occasions in a man's
life."
i Jordan expects the U.S. team to be equally strong in the nexi
j Olympiad. "We may not be much stronger but we will improve
! numerically. We must sit on complacency."
The Olympic Games are the spectacular of spori. No other single
; athletic competition in the world brings together so many talented
! athletes or has so much meaningful and colorful pageantry.
This year, Stanford's head track and field coach, Payton Jordan,
had the honor to he an assistant coach on ihc U.S. Olympic Track
Team in charge of the runners and weight men. He returned to
Stanford early this month and, although he has experienced many
! sporting thrills both as a competitor and as a participant and expects
' more, he said he has never enjoyed any compeition more.
Jordan considered this year's games the best organized he has
I seen in more than thirty years of watching Olympic action and also
