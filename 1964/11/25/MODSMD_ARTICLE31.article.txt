# Reg Re-Evaluation Needed
## 
### 
The time has come for a serious re-evaluation
of women's social regulations at Stanford.
The letters appearing in The Daily during
the past week indicate a healthy new student
interest in changing regulations with which
practically no one is satisfied.
For the first time in several years, students
are coming forth with practical, well-considered
plans for reform, plans which, because they are
reasonable and because they replace the usual
unproductive carping and complaining, may have
considerable chance for eventual adoption.
The Daily will serve during the next few
weeks as a forum for the expression of student,
administration and facult\ opinion on this sub
ject.
At present, we are organizing an extensive
series of investigative articles to begin on Regis
tration Day, Winter Quarter. These articles will
deal with two major problem areas: first, the

problem of defining the University's role in regu
lating and, in fact, prescribing the moral be
havior of students (the so-called in loco parent is
issue); and second, the problem of setting down
specific rules and regulations pertaining to stu
dent conduct, particularly to the conduct of Stan
ford women in their private, non-academic lives.
Through such a series we hope to promote an
extensive discussion within the University com
munity about women's hours, open house regu
lations, off-campus living for women, and coed
housing.
Students who have suggestions should take
them to the AWS Social Regulations Commit
tee, LASSU, and the judicial councils, where they
can be aired and a compromise reached.
There is no area of student life in such obvi
ous and drastic need of re-evaluation and reform.
In a spirit of compromise, cooperation and
constructive criticism, rather than antagonism,
let the discussion proceed.
