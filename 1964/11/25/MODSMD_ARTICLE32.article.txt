# NO CASES THIS FALL
## SU Alert To Meningitis Threat

Following the Fort Ord eases, several students
have inquired about meningitis at Stanford.
Despite a modest national and statewide in
crease in meningitis, it is highly unlikely that the
Stanford community will experience more than a
handful of cases during the coming year. Cer
tainly, no si/.eable epidemic is in prospect.
Similar outbreaks have occurred at military
installations quite frequently over the past ."50
years. But there has never been any remotely
comparable epidemic of meningitis at schools, col
leges, or civilian communities.
Contrary to popular impression, meningitis out
breaks do not start at military installations and
spread elsewhere. Instead, these cases represent
an intensification of the prevailing national pattern
of this disease. The relatively high rate of men
ingitis cases at military installations probably re
sults from the low levels of natural immunity
among rural recruits, the constant 24-hour con
tact of individuals in the same small group and
the physical and perhaps emotional stress trainees
experience.
Stanford probably follows the general civilian
community pattern. At any time, the meningococ
cus germ can be found in about one out of five
healthy individuals. Yet in the worst epidemic,
only one person in 20,000 will be become sick wit h
this disease. Unfortunately, it is practically impos
sible to predict which few of the many infected
actually will become ill.
Any individual has a 20 per cent chance of
having a positive throat, culture for this disease,!
whether exposed to a case or not. The person®

who tests positive today is in no substantially
greater risk than his neighbor who may test
negative today, but positive next week.
Regrettably, there is no reliable, safe, or practi
cal method for protecting an entire community nor
ol' preventing all cases of meningitis. Where pre
ventive drugs have been administered to entire
local populations, the results have been It many
drug reactions some serious; 2) a higher pro
portion of drug-re.sistant germs; and 3) a return
to pre-treatment conditions for the whole commu
nity within a few weeks.
However, there is protective value in adminis
tering preventive drugs on a selective basis to
those persons who have been in close contact with
actual cases (if meningitis. Fortunately, there
have been no meningitis cases at Stanford this fall.
Should one occur, close personal companions
of the patient and students in the same small liv
ing unit or dormitory corridor would be advised
to seek prophylactic care through the Health Ser
vice. Other members of the University community
in close contact with an actual case would be ad
vised to contact their personal physician.
Early diagnosis and prompt, vigorous treatment
are the best defenses against meningitis. In the
great majority of cases, this will result in a com
plete cure.
Individuals should be alert and seek prompt
medical care in any case involving fever, head
ache, and stiff neck, with or without rash. This is
particularly true for those responsible for younger
children, under 10 years old.
Through the Medical School, Health Service,
and consultation with nationally recognized ex
perts. Stanford will continue to keep close watch
ULon the meningitis situation, which has not yet
•■touched this campus.
