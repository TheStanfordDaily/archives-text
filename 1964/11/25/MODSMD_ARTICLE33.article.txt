## 'Topkapi' Too Good To Miss 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
For those who arc wondering
why Jules Dassin chose such a
jaw-breaking tide for his latest
venture in suspense, Topkapi is
the name of a palace-turnod-mu
seum in Istanbul where a little
trinket called the Sultan's Dagger
is kept.
Its hill contains four of th e
most perfect emeralds in th e
world, which is why Molina Mor
eouri and company are going to
steal it. And there is no doubt
that they will succeed, in spite
of tho maze of protective devices
the Turkish government has in
stalled to prevent such a theft.
For Molina is working with a
Swiss (Maximilian Schell) to
whom obstacles arc as nothing.
The police are certain to question
the top professionals when the
theft is discovered; so he uses
amateurs. The floor is so deli
cately wired that a pingpong h:< 11
will set off the alarm mechan
ism; so he hires an acrobat to de
scend from above.
The Plot Thickens
The necessary munitions will
attract attention; so he pays a
"schmoe" to drive them across the
border hidden in a rented Conti
nental. Unfortunately, the au
thorities do discover the arms:
and since they think Melina and
Maximilian are guerillas, they
bully Peter Ustinov, the schmoe,
into spying on them.
He quickly changes sides, how
ever. when one of Molina's crew
i< disabled. And though his fear

of height nearly dynamites I h e
project (and provides some comic
relief on the wayt, they succeed
in stealing the dagger.
But they are caught, and there
i in lies the problem. One gets up
: from Topkapi, having laughed a
' reasonable amount, held one's
breath for an amazingly long
time, and admired everyone in
volved, feeling cheated.
It seems so unfair that these
handsome and clever people, with
; such a marvelous plan, should not
1 only be caught, but look so ridieu
! lous in prison. Unless, of course.
Dassin intended the movie 1o be a
j subtle satire. But, in that case.
S why all the sobriety during the
'theft? It remains an uneasy, and
i unresolved, dilemma.
Suave Sophistication
Otherwise, of course, things
are suavely sophisticated as only
Dassin can make them. Except for
the question of point of view, his
direction is both accomplished and
| ingenious. His camera work is
! deftness and precision person!-
S ficd.
And some of the shots seem to
i have been taken in mid-air, as if
the cameraman (and the audi
jenee) were dangling from the
! same rope as the actor, no small
accomplishment in anyone's book.
Cast-wise, Melina Mercouri is
fntrilly irresistible as the nym
phomaniac who starts the whole
affair. Maximilian Schell is con
summately urbane as the Swiss
with the plan; and no one could
possibly "be more schmoey than
Peter Ustinov. CJllles Segfil is pro
bably the most innocent-looking

acrobat who ever stole a dagger;
and .Robert Morley is delightful
as the English inventor who cases
and outwits the entire alarm sys
: tem.
They are all, in fact, too won
derful to be missed; and the idea
sure of watching them far out
weighs what few faults Topkapi
does have.
