i To The Social Regulations
Committee:
We have long been dissatisfied
with Stanford's social regulations
| for women which we feel are in
congruous with the Fundamental
Standard. Wo agree with the
spirit of the letter from Tina Dun
gan, et al; however, practical con
siderations suggest these modifi
cations of their proposals:
1) We are in agreement with
the proposal for unlimited 2:3o's
and week-end over-nights for
freshman women since we feel
that some limitiation is helpful
in adjusting to Ihc freedom of
college life.
2) We disagree w i th th e
proposal for upper-class wom
en to sign out for a particular
hour. We feci this would be im
practicable, as it would keep
R.A.'s and night-assistants up
all night checking sign-out
cards. Therefore, we counter
propose thai a woman bo able
to stay out until 12:00 p.m.
without signing out and after
that have the option of signing
out for a laic leave or an over
night. Sign-out time for a late
leave would be 7:00 a.m. Sign
ing out for an overnight would
be, in effect, signing out until
twelve the next night. The 7:00
a.m. sign-in is not an arbitrary
limit, but is designed for the
woman's protection since there
should be a set time when offi
cials start checking in case
some mishap has occurred. Late
leaves and overnights would bo
unlimited.
3> We agree that companion
and destination should bo left
to the discretion of the woman,
in keeping with the funda
mental standard.
D We agree that dishonesty
should be grounds for discipli
nary action, but we feel that
"irresponsibility" should be de
leted from 1 lie proposal as it is
vague and essentially meaning
less here.

Dear sir:
Although Mr. Meservey depicts
the attitude of Stanford women
wiili vividness, he neither explains
how it has come about nor what
can be done about it.
Since Stanford women do not
represent a cross section of the
population, they certainly share
many traits; thus generalizing
and stereotyping is fair game.
The majority come from upper
middle class homes where they
are carefully sheltered, taught
rigidly to conform, and condi
tioned to compete for grades.
They then arrive at Stanford
where a maternal dormitory sys
tem, association with people like
themselves, isolation from adults
and community, and a hosl of
men who flatter them, acting as
chauffeurs and waiters, all com
bine to reinforce the naivete and
nurture the conceit. As students
they develop. As women they re
main little girls, lacking mature
personality, domestic skills, mem
bership in the feminine sex. Con
versation is frivilous and insin-1
cere: appearance is pure and
"well-scrubbed;" behavior is with- j
in a 19th century ethical code.
At the same time that they de-(
mand to be treated like "little j
ladies," they avoid learning to
cook and sew and take an aca
demic role hitherto occupied by
men only. In short, they are not
made for this world.
Then the problem comes to a
climax; they graduate. This is
a shock, for they discover <1 > the
world is not in desperate need of
non-feminine women who have
good grades, and <2» there is a
dearth of eligible men. Since less

than 30 per cent go to graduate
school and a certain number trap
naive Stanford men, there is still
a large number who must under
go a drastic anil difficult tran
sition in adjusting to modern so
ciety.
Thus the ratio, which provides
considerable advantage to the
women while at college, does them
the most harm when they leave.
Two solutions of the problem
seems feasible: (1) do away alto
gether with the admission of wom
en to Stanford, (2) remove the ad
! mission bias and hence equalize
the ratio. Of the two, the former
is preferable, since it would
change campus social life the
least.

• Uncontrolled Polities
Dear Sir:
There seems to be a great deal
of concern and no small amount
of controversy over the militant
leadership and dubious tactics of
l T C's Free Speech Movement.
However, the issues underlying
the conflict have been obscured j
by the emotional aspects of to
day's universal freedom move
ment.
The purpose of a university, bo
il public or private, should be i
primarily academic.
The purpose of the administra
tion should be to create an atmos-1
phere in the university comrnu- j
nity which will be conducive to
the total educational process.
Therefore it is the responsibility
of the university to assure that
people representing various ide
ologies have the opportunity to
express their positions on cam
pus. However, it is not the place
of the university to provide an
area for the solicitation of funds
and membership for those politi
cal groups. In doing so, the uni
versity is associating itself with
a particular political organization,
rather than fulfilling the purpose
of supplying access to different '
political concepts.
The name. Free Speech Move
ment, is misleading. The students
of the University of California
and Stanford already have* tin
abridged freedom of speech.

Rather, Mario Savio and his col
leagues are using this title to ap
peal to the liberal, freedom eon

i while their goals are very much

Dear Sir:
Any doubts one might have had
about Mr. Naylor's "political phil
osophy" two weeks ago w hen we
saw him promote the election of
Barry Goldwater and recommend
a "no" vote on Proposition 14
should have been resolved when
his editorial "The Fast for Free
dom" appeared in the Dail.v last
Tuesday.
Mr. Naylor's outburst, disclaim
ing his (or "our") responsibility
for what goes on in Mississippi as
"hogwash," and calling the docu
mentation and the literature beim r

used to promote the Fast for Free
dom "cheap emotionalism," be
trays itself as an emotional reac
tion. That he then goes on to urge
student participation in the Fast
is no more logical than his Gold
water-anti-14 stand.
I presume that he endorsed
Goldwater and his "status quo"
policy on race relations because he
felt that someone else was respon
sible for the terrible conditions ex
isting and that someone else could
make the changes necessary. But
his conscience hurt him a little bit
and he quieted it by conceding a
j "no (with reservations)" on 11.
Now that his responsibility is
being pressed upon him by the
| humanitarians here (we weren't
i killed off by the passage of 14)
and elsewhere who are working
: against racism, he cries that any
pangs of of conscience and guilt
feelings he may have "have no
i basis in reality." And lie ends up
by endorsing the Fast!
I suggest that Mr. Naylor try
to be consistent: either deny his
responsibility as his brother's
'keeper entirely and endorse that
distorted rightist "Darwinism"
"the survival of the fittest." or
some over to our side and work
to alleviate the effects of man's
i inhumanity to man.
Mr. Naylor's attitude is the atti
tude which has permitted all of
the incursions against human
! rights and dignities in history.
We who acknowledge our in
! herited responsibility for all such
i wrongs ihe genocide we engaged
: in against the American Indian,
the terrible excesses by our fellow
Anglo-Saxons in Germany during
!the last war, the atrocities com
mitted by our brother Asians the
• Japanese (hiring the same war,
our part in the bombing of Hiro
shima and Nagasaki, and finally
jour responsibility for present con
ditions in Mississippi and else
where in this wonderful country
we are contrite.
We will participate in fasts, sit
| ins, and the like, if we think that
these will help rectify our past
mistakes. Our consciences will not
j cease to bother us because of
J these actions, as Mr. Naylor seems
i to think.
We invite Mr. Naylor to ac
j knowledge his responsibility and
I join us.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The con
j eept of "inherited responsibil
ity" for the actions of our an
cestors or people of other so
j cieties (such as Mississippi) is,
we still feel, absurd. One can
regret that these deeds were
done, one can attempt to make
) right what we consider wrongs,
; but to feel a guilt for social
wrongs is to feel guilty for
j something totally out of one's
i control, to feel as though one
somehow contributed to those
social evils when such respon
sibility is impossible.
What does one do if one just
does not feel guilty and "con
trite" and yet does want to see
existing injustice alleviated?
We suggest, that such individ
uals should continue to make
their contributions, or else Mr.
MeShean's cause will be badly
hurt.
• Penn. U. Honor (.ode
Dear Sir:
Recently, the students of the
University of Pennsylvania were
offered a compromised Hon or
System which proved to be unac
ceptable due to a poorly worded
and ill-conceived third party
clause. The proposal was rejected
overwhelmingly.
Currently, several interested
students are trying to revitalize
the concept of a true Honor Sys
tem and will shortly ask the sup
port of the Student Body and
Faculty through a petition. Be
cause student-faculty relation
ships at Penn are very poor, and
both groups are notoriously apa
thetic about undergraduate af
fairs, there is a feeling a m on g
many students, especially upper
classmen, that an Honor System
would not work at Penn. They
need encouragement from out
side?. from students and faculty
who appreciate the merits of their
own Honor System.
Therefore, 1 would like to ask
interested students and faculty
members of Stanford University
to write letters explaining what
the Honor System means to you
as individuals, and demonstrating
that tho Honor System does work
in reality.
Please address letters to the
Editor, Daily Pennsylvanian. Sar
geant Hall, University of Penn
sylvania. Philadelphia 1. Pa. In
dicate position, and if student,
class.
Thank you very much.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The con
j eept of "inherited responsibil
ity" for the actions of our an
cestors or people of other so
j cieties (such as Mississippi) is,
we still feel, absurd. One can
regret that these deeds were
done, one can attempt to make
) right what we consider wrongs,
; but to feel a guilt for social
wrongs is to feel guilty for
j something totally out of one's
i control, to feel as though one
somehow contributed to those
social evils when such respon
sibility is impossible.
What does one do if one just
does not feel guilty and "con
trite" and yet does want to see
existing injustice alleviated?
We suggest, that such individ
uals should continue to make
their contributions, or else Mr.
MeShean's cause will be badly
hurt.
• Penn. U. Honor (.ode
Dear Sir:
Recently, the students of the
University of Pennsylvania were
offered a compromised Hon or
System which proved to be unac
ceptable due to a poorly worded
and ill-conceived third party
clause. The proposal was rejected
overwhelmingly.
Currently, several interested
students are trying to revitalize
the concept of a true Honor Sys
tem and will shortly ask the sup
port of the Student Body and
Faculty through a petition. Be
cause student-faculty relation
ships at Penn are very poor, and
both groups are notoriously apa
thetic about undergraduate af
fairs, there is a feeling a m on g
many students, especially upper
classmen, that an Honor System
would not work at Penn. They
need encouragement from out
side?. from students and faculty
who appreciate the merits of their
own Honor System.
Therefore, 1 would like to ask
interested students and faculty
members of Stanford University
to write letters explaining what
the Honor System means to you
as individuals, and demonstrating
that tho Honor System does work
in reality.
Please address letters to the
Editor, Daily Pennsylvanian. Sar

2) We disagree w i th th e
proposal for upper-class wom

all night checking sign-out

propose thai a woman bo able

without signing out and after

out for a laic leave or an over

leave would be 7:00 a.m. Sign
ing out for an overnight would
be, in effect, signing out until

a.m. sign-in is not an arbitrary

Dear sir:
Although Mr. Meservey depicts
the attitude of Stanford women
wiili vividness, he neither explains
how it has come about nor what
can be done about it.
Since Stanford women do not
represent a cross section of the
population, they certainly share
many traits; thus generalizing
and stereotyping is fair game.
The majority come from upper
middle class homes where they
are carefully sheltered, taught
rigidly to conform, and condi
tioned to compete for grades.
They then arrive at Stanford
where a maternal dormitory sys
tem, association with people like
themselves, isolation from adults
and community, and a hosl of
men who flatter them, acting as
chauffeurs and waiters, all com
bine to reinforce the naivete and
nurture the conceit. As students
they develop. As women they re
main little girls, lacking mature
personality, domestic skills, mem
bership in the feminine sex. Con
versation is frivilous and insin-1
cere: appearance is pure and
"well-scrubbed;" behavior is with- j
in a 19th century ethical code.
At the same time that they de-(
mand to be treated like "little j
ladies," they avoid learning to
cook and sew and take an aca
demic role hitherto occupied by
men only. In short, they are not
made for this world.
Then the problem comes to a
climax; they graduate. This is
a shock, for they discover <1 > the
world is not in desperate need of
non-feminine women who have
good grades, and <2» there is a
dearth of eligible men. Since less

than 30 per cent go to graduate
school and a certain number trap
naive Stanford men, there is still
a large number who must under
go a drastic anil difficult tran
sition in adjusting to modern so
ciety.
Thus the ratio, which provides
considerable advantage to the
women while at college, does them
the most harm when they leave.
Two solutions of the problem
seems feasible: (1) do away alto
gether with the admission of wom
en to Stanford, (2) remove the ad
! mission bias and hence equalize
the ratio. Of the two, the former
is preferable, since it would
change campus social life the

Dear Sir:

However, the issues underlying

The purpose of the administra

Therefore it is the responsibility

Dear Sir:
Any doubts one might have had
about Mr. Naylor's "political phil
osophy" two weeks ago w hen we
saw him promote the election of
Barry Goldwater and recommend
a "no" vote on Proposition 14
should have been resolved when
his editorial "The Fast for Free
dom" appeared in the Dail.v last
Tuesday.
Mr. Naylor's outburst, disclaim
ing his (or "our") responsibility
for what goes on in Mississippi as
"hogwash," and calling the docu
mentation and the literature beim r

used to promote the Fast for Free
dom "cheap emotionalism," be
trays itself as an emotional reac
tion. That he then goes on to urge
student participation in the Fast
is no more logical than his Gold
water-anti-14 stand.
I presume that he endorsed
Goldwater and his "status quo"
policy on race relations because he
felt that someone else was respon
sible for the terrible conditions ex
isting and that someone else could
make the changes necessary. But
his conscience hurt him a little bit
and he quieted it by conceding a
j "no (with reservations)" on 11.
Now that his responsibility is
being pressed upon him by the
| humanitarians here (we weren't
i killed off by the passage of 14)
and elsewhere who are working
: against racism, he cries that any
pangs of of conscience and guilt
feelings he may have "have no
i basis in reality." And lie ends up
by endorsing the Fast!
I suggest that Mr. Naylor try
to be consistent: either deny his
responsibility as his brother's
'keeper entirely and endorse that
distorted rightist "Darwinism"
"the survival of the fittest." or
some over to our side and work
to alleviate the effects of man's
i inhumanity to man.
Mr. Naylor's attitude is the atti
tude which has permitted all of
the incursions against human
! rights and dignities in history.
We who acknowledge our in
! herited responsibility for all such
i wrongs ihe genocide we engaged
: in against the American Indian,
the terrible excesses by our fellow
Anglo-Saxons in Germany during
!the last war, the atrocities com
mitted by our brother Asians the
• Japanese (hiring the same war,
our part in the bombing of Hiro

ditions in Mississippi and else

Dear Sir:
The Stanford farm ordy looks

• Keel (ionlrile, Or Kltse
Dear Sir:
Any doubts one might have had
about Mr. Naylor's "political phil
osophy" two weeks ago w hen we
saw him promote the election of
Barry Goldwater and recommend
a "no" vote on Proposition 14
should have been resolved when
his editorial "The Fast for Free
dom" appeared in the Dail.v last
Tuesday.
Mr. Naylor's outburst, disclaim
ing his (or "our") responsibility
for what goes on in Mississippi as
"hogwash," and calling the docu
mentation and the literature beim r

used to promote the Fast for Free
dom "cheap emotionalism," be
trays itself as an emotional reac
tion. That he then goes on to urge
student participation in the Fast
is no more logical than his Gold
water-anti-14 stand.
I presume that he endorsed
Goldwater and his "status quo"
policy on race relations because he
felt that someone else was respon
sible for the terrible conditions ex
isting and that someone else could
make the changes necessary. But
his conscience hurt him a little bit
and he quieted it by conceding a
j "no (with reservations)" on 11.
Now that his responsibility is
being pressed upon him by the
| humanitarians here (we weren't
i killed off by the passage of 14)
and elsewhere who are working
: against racism, he cries that any
pangs of of conscience and guilt
feelings he may have "have no
i basis in reality." And lie ends up
by endorsing the Fast!
I suggest that Mr. Naylor try
to be consistent: either deny his
responsibility as his brother's
'keeper entirely and endorse that
distorted rightist "Darwinism"
"the survival of the fittest." or
some over to our side and work
to alleviate the effects of man's
i inhumanity to man.
Mr. Naylor's attitude is the atti
tude which has permitted all of
the incursions against human
! rights and dignities in history.
We who acknowledge our in
! herited responsibility for all such
i wrongs ihe genocide we engaged
: in against the American Indian,
the terrible excesses by our fellow
Anglo-Saxons in Germany during
!the last war, the atrocities com
mitted by our brother Asians the
• Japanese (hiring the same war,
our part in the bombing of Hiro
shima and Nagasaki, and finally
jour responsibility for present con
ditions in Mississippi and else
where in this wonderful country
we are contrite.
We will participate in fasts, sit
| ins, and the like, if we think that
these will help rectify our past
mistakes. Our consciences will not
j cease to bother us because of
J these actions, as Mr. Naylor seems
i to think.
We invite Mr. Naylor to ac
j knowledge his responsibility and
I join us.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The con
j eept of "inherited responsibil
ity" for the actions of our an
cestors or people of other so
j cieties (such as Mississippi) is,
we still feel, absurd. One can
regret that these deeds were
done, one can attempt to make
) right what we consider wrongs,
; but to feel a guilt for social
wrongs is to feel guilty for
j something totally out of one's
i control, to feel as though one
somehow contributed to those
social evils when such respon
sibility is impossible.
What does one do if one just
does not feel guilty and "con
trite" and yet does want to see
existing injustice alleviated?
We suggest, that such individ
uals should continue to make
their contributions, or else Mr.
MeShean's cause will be badly

• Penn. U. Honor (.ode
Dear Sir:
Recently, the students of the
University of Pennsylvania were
offered a compromised Hon or
System which proved to be unac
ceptable due to a poorly worded
and ill-conceived third party
clause. The proposal was rejected
overwhelmingly.
Currently, several interested
students are trying to revitalize
the concept of a true Honor Sys
tem and will shortly ask the sup
port of the Student Body and
Faculty through a petition. Be
cause student-faculty relation
ships at Penn are very poor, and
both groups are notoriously apa
thetic about undergraduate af
fairs, there is a feeling a m on g
many students, especially upper
classmen, that an Honor System
would not work at Penn. They
need encouragement from out
side?. from students and faculty
who appreciate the merits of their
own Honor System.
Therefore, 1 would like to ask
interested students and faculty
members of Stanford University
to write letters explaining what
the Honor System means to you
as individuals, and demonstrating
that tho Honor System does work
in reality.
Please address letters to the

Dear sir:
Although Mr. Meservey depicts
the attitude of Stanford women
wiili vividness, he neither explains
how it has come about nor what
can be done about it.
Since Stanford women do not
represent a cross section of the
population, they certainly share
many traits; thus generalizing
and stereotyping is fair game.
The majority come from upper
middle class homes where they
are carefully sheltered, taught
rigidly to conform, and condi
tioned to compete for grades.
They then arrive at Stanford
where a maternal dormitory sys
tem, association with people like
themselves, isolation from adults
and community, and a hosl of
men who flatter them, acting as
chauffeurs and waiters, all com
bine to reinforce the naivete and
nurture the conceit. As students
they develop. As women they re
main little girls, lacking mature
personality, domestic skills, mem
bership in the feminine sex. Con
versation is frivilous and insin-1
cere: appearance is pure and
"well-scrubbed;" behavior is with- j
in a 19th century ethical code.
At the same time that they de-(
mand to be treated like "little j
ladies," they avoid learning to
cook and sew and take an aca
demic role hitherto occupied by
men only. In short, they are not
made for this world.
Then the problem comes to a
climax; they graduate. This is
a shock, for they discover <1 > the
world is not in desperate need of
non-feminine women who have
good grades, and <2» there is a
dearth of eligible men. Since less

than 30 per cent go to graduate
school and a certain number trap
naive Stanford men, there is still
a large number who must under
go a drastic anil difficult tran
sition in adjusting to modern so
ciety.
Thus the ratio, which provides
considerable advantage to the
women while at college, does them
the most harm when they leave.
Two solutions of the problem
seems feasible: (1) do away alto
gether with the admission of wom

• Uncontrolled Polities
Dear Sir:
There seems to be a great deal
of concern and no small amount
of controversy over the militant

However, the issues underlying
the conflict have been obscured j
by the emotional aspects of to

il public or private, should be i
primarily academic.
The purpose of the administra
tion should be to create an atmos-1

Therefore it is the responsibility
of the university to assure that

pus. However, it is not the place
of the university to provide an
area for the solicitation of funds

rather than fulfilling the purpose

• Poli U Thanked
Dear Sir:
. . . The Political Union has
been criticized for bringing such
i speakers |as Rockwell] to cam
pus. The reason of this letter is
mot so much to defend the Politi
i cal Union from these critics, as to
thank it for t he opportunity it
gives us to hear speakers such as
Rockwell! The editorial on Rock
well's visit in the Daily on
i November 13 seems to have inad
vertently hit on a very tangible
■ benefit of having a speaker such
' as this neo-Nazi to campus. It
stated that Rockwell's visit had
i "promoted active discussion."
For us this was a very impor
tant thing. We went, full of hor
! ror to hear Rockwell speak of
'Nazi atrocities. We left his talk
! with this same sense of horror,
I but also with the conviction that
i Rockwell's perverted demagog
uery could possibly com incc if the
I conditions were right. And we dc
; termined that a passive revulsion
I to Nazism was not enough, b u t
i that to prevent its reappearance,
i we and others would have to be
; constantly aware of its potential
| danger. Hitler did not rise to pow
i or merely because he was allowed
| free speech, as Mr. Steingart
(would have us think. In fact, one
; of the main reasons for his suc
cess was that opposition to him
! was apathetic. Furthermore his
! opposition was apathetic because
: they did not bother to listen to
! Hitler and to realize the full
| implications of what he said. . . .
We resent the effort of anyone
j to limit what we may and may
; not hear. We want to hear every
j side and draw our own conclu
; sions. We have rejected Rock
j well's hate, but in a free America,
we demand the right to make

• Special Treatment
Dear .Miss Bonner:
Your hilarious reply to my pre

i extreme, and rather gross form,
} to express some of those very
I sentiments I criticized. Although
! on dates Stanford men provide
you with more-than-ample prior
notice, free transportation, free
| admission to social cvnts, free re
freshments if you consume any,
free door-opening services, a n d
other favors which apparently you
fail to appreciate, you complain
that you are not treated as "spe
cial." If that isn't special treat
ment, I don't know what is! In
fact, many Stanford women are
so "special" that they are scarcely
members of the human race.

Dear Sir:
. . . The Political Union has
been criticized for bringing such
i speakers |as Rockwell] to cam
pus. The reason of this letter is
mot so much to defend the Politi
i cal Union from these critics, as to
thank it for t he opportunity it
gives us to hear speakers such as
Rockwell! The editorial on Rock
well's visit in the Daily on
i November 13 seems to have inad
vertently hit on a very tangible
■ benefit of having a speaker such
' as this neo-Nazi to campus. It
stated that Rockwell's visit had
i "promoted active discussion."
For us this was a very impor
tant thing. We went, full of hor
! ror to hear Rockwell speak of
'Nazi atrocities. We left his talk
! with this same sense of horror,
I but also with the conviction that
i Rockwell's perverted demagog
uery could possibly com incc if the
I conditions were right. And we dc
; termined that a passive revulsion
I to Nazism was not enough, b u t
i that to prevent its reappearance,
i we and others would have to be
; constantly aware of its potential
| danger. Hitler did not rise to pow
i or merely because he was allowed
| free speech, as Mr. Steingart
(would have us think. In fact, one
; of the main reasons for his suc
cess was that opposition to him
! was apathetic. Furthermore his
! opposition was apathetic because
: they did not bother to listen to
! Hitler and to realize the full
| implications of what he said. . . .
We resent the effort of anyone
j to limit what we may and may
; not hear. We want to hear every
j side and draw our own conclu
; sions. We have rejected Rock
j well's hate, but in a free America,
we demand the right to make
I our own decisions.

• Special Treatment
Dear .Miss Bonner:
Your hilarious reply to my pre
| vious letter seems, in graphic,
i extreme, and rather gross form,
} to express some of those very
I sentiments I criticized. Although
! on dates Stanford men provide
you with more-than-ample prior
notice, free transportation, free
| admission to social cvnts, free re
freshments if you consume any,
free door-opening services, a n d
other favors which apparently you
fail to appreciate, you complain
that you are not treated as "spe
cial." If that isn't special treat
ment, I don't know what is! In
fact, many Stanford women are
so "special" that they are scarcely
members of the human race.

• Special? !No! Normal!
Dear Sir:
Yesterday a letter appeared in
the Daily written by one of our
"special" Stanford women. She
writes. "In short, if you want
Stanford women to be special, you
must treat them as special." Who
the hell wants Stanford women
to lie special? If only they were
normal!
(And thank goodness there are
a few who are content to be just

Dear Sir:
Any doubts one might have had
about Mr. Naylor's "political phil
osophy" two weeks ago w hen we
saw him promote the election of
Barry Goldwater and recommend
a "no" vote on Proposition 14
should have been resolved when
his editorial "The Fast for Free
dom" appeared in the Dail.v last
Tuesday.
Mr. Naylor's outburst, disclaim
ing his (or "our") responsibility
for what goes on in Mississippi as
"hogwash," and calling the docu
mentation and the literature beim r

used to promote the Fast for Free
dom "cheap emotionalism," be
trays itself as an emotional reac
tion. That he then goes on to urge
student participation in the Fast
is no more logical than his Gold
water-anti-14 stand.
I presume that he endorsed
Goldwater and his "status quo"
policy on race relations because he
felt that someone else was respon
sible for the terrible conditions ex
isting and that someone else could
make the changes necessary. But
his conscience hurt him a little bit
and he quieted it by conceding a
j "no (with reservations)" on 11.
Now that his responsibility is
being pressed upon him by the
| humanitarians here (we weren't
i killed off by the passage of 14)
and elsewhere who are working
: against racism, he cries that any
pangs of of conscience and guilt
feelings he may have "have no
i basis in reality." And lie ends up
by endorsing the Fast!
I suggest that Mr. Naylor try
to be consistent: either deny his
responsibility as his brother's
'keeper entirely and endorse that
distorted rightist "Darwinism"
"the survival of the fittest." or
some over to our side and work
to alleviate the effects of man's
i inhumanity to man.
Mr. Naylor's attitude is the atti
tude which has permitted all of
the incursions against human
! rights and dignities in history.
We who acknowledge our in
! herited responsibility for all such
i wrongs ihe genocide we engaged
: in against the American Indian,
the terrible excesses by our fellow
Anglo-Saxons in Germany during
!the last war, the atrocities com
mitted by our brother Asians the
• Japanese (hiring the same war,
our part in the bombing of Hiro
shima and Nagasaki, and finally
jour responsibility for present con
ditions in Mississippi and else
where in this wonderful country
we are contrite.
We will participate in fasts, sit
| ins, and the like, if we think that
these will help rectify our past
mistakes. Our consciences will not
j cease to bother us because of
J these actions, as Mr. Naylor seems
i to think.
We invite Mr. Naylor to ac
j knowledge his responsibility and
I join us.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The con
j eept of "inherited responsibil
ity" for the actions of our an
cestors or people of other so
j cieties (such as Mississippi) is,
we still feel, absurd. One can
regret that these deeds were
done, one can attempt to make
) right what we consider wrongs,
; but to feel a guilt for social
wrongs is to feel guilty for
j something totally out of one's
i control, to feel as though one
somehow contributed to those
social evils when such respon
sibility is impossible.
What does one do if one just
does not feel guilty and "con
trite" and yet does want to see
existing injustice alleviated?
We suggest, that such individ
uals should continue to make
their contributions, or else Mr.

• Penn. U. Honor (.ode
Dear Sir:
Recently, the students of the
University of Pennsylvania were
offered a compromised Hon or
System which proved to be unac
ceptable due to a poorly worded
and ill-conceived third party
clause. The proposal was rejected
overwhelmingly.
Currently, several interested
students are trying to revitalize
the concept of a true Honor Sys
tem and will shortly ask the sup
port of the Student Body and
Faculty through a petition. Be
cause student-faculty relation
ships at Penn are very poor, and
both groups are notoriously apa
thetic about undergraduate af
fairs, there is a feeling a m on g
many students, especially upper
classmen, that an Honor System
would not work at Penn. They
need encouragement from out
side?. from students and faculty
who appreciate the merits of their
own Honor System.
Therefore, 1 would like to ask

Since Stanford women do not

The majority come from upper

They then arrive at Stanford

they develop. As women they re

At the same time that they de-(

• Uncontrolled Polities
Dear Sir:
There seems to be a great deal
of concern and no small amount
of controversy over the militant
leadership and dubious tactics of
l T C's Free Speech Movement.
However, the issues underlying
the conflict have been obscured j
by the emotional aspects of to
day's universal freedom move
ment.
The purpose of a university, bo
il public or private, should be i
primarily academic.
The purpose of the administra
tion should be to create an atmos-1
phere in the university comrnu- j
nity which will be conducive to
the total educational process.
Therefore it is the responsibility
of the university to assure that
people representing various ide
ologies have the opportunity to
express their positions on cam
pus. However, it is not the place
of the university to provide an
area for the solicitation of funds
and membership for those politi
cal groups. In doing so, the uni
versity is associating itself with
a particular political organization,
rather than fulfilling the purpose
of supplying access to different '
political concepts.
The name. Free Speech Move
ment, is misleading. The students
of the University of California
and Stanford already have* tin
abridged freedom of speech.

Rather, Mario Savio and his col
leagues are using this title to ap
peal to the liberal, freedom eon
scious element in today's colleges,
i while their goals are very much
| beyond the basic rights of free
speech. Furthermore, the admin
-1 istration has the right and the
I duty I<> enforce its policies in the
j interests of t ho general univer
sity community. Students should
■ be aware of the dangers of allow
! ing the campus to become a ref
| uge of uncontrolled political ac
tivity rather than an intellectual
; community where ideas may be
explored.

• Uncontrolled Polities
Dear Sir:
There seems to be a great deal
of concern and no small amount
of controversy over the militant
leadership and dubious tactics of
l T C's Free Speech Movement.
However, the issues underlying
the conflict have been obscured j
by the emotional aspects of to
day's universal freedom move
ment.
The purpose of a university, bo
il public or private, should be i
primarily academic.
The purpose of the administra
tion should be to create an atmos-1
phere in the university comrnu- j
nity which will be conducive to
the total educational process.
Therefore it is the responsibility
of the university to assure that
people representing various ide
ologies have the opportunity to
express their positions on cam
pus. However, it is not the place
of the university to provide an
area for the solicitation of funds
and membership for those politi
cal groups. In doing so, the uni
versity is associating itself with
a particular political organization,
rather than fulfilling the purpose
of supplying access to different '
political concepts.
The name. Free Speech Move
ment, is misleading. The students
of the University of California
and Stanford already have* tin
abridged freedom of speech.

Rather, Mario Savio and his col
leagues are using this title to ap
peal to the liberal, freedom eon
scious element in today's colleges,
i while their goals are very much
| beyond the basic rights of free
speech. Furthermore, the admin

Dear Sir:
. . . The Political Union has
been criticized for bringing such
i speakers |as Rockwell] to cam

mot so much to defend the Politi
i cal Union from these critics, as to
thank it for t he opportunity it
gives us to hear speakers such as
Rockwell! The editorial on Rock

■ benefit of having a speaker such
' as this neo-Nazi to campus. It
stated that Rockwell's visit had
i "promoted active discussion."
For us this was a very impor
tant thing. We went, full of hor

'Nazi atrocities. We left his talk
! with this same sense of horror,
I but also with the conviction that
i Rockwell's perverted demagog
uery could possibly com incc if the
I conditions were right. And we dc
; termined that a passive revulsion
I to Nazism was not enough, b u t
i that to prevent its reappearance,
i we and others would have to be

i or merely because he was allowed

: they did not bother to listen to

We resent the effort of anyone

Dear Sir:
Any doubts one might have had
about Mr. Naylor's "political phil
osophy" two weeks ago w hen we
saw him promote the election of
Barry Goldwater and recommend
a "no" vote on Proposition 14
should have been resolved when
his editorial "The Fast for Free
dom" appeared in the Dail.v last
Tuesday.
Mr. Naylor's outburst, disclaim
ing his (or "our") responsibility
for what goes on in Mississippi as
"hogwash," and calling the docu
mentation and the literature beim r

used to promote the Fast for Free
dom "cheap emotionalism," be
trays itself as an emotional reac
tion. That he then goes on to urge
student participation in the Fast
is no more logical than his Gold
water-anti-14 stand.
I presume that he endorsed
Goldwater and his "status quo"
policy on race relations because he
felt that someone else was respon
sible for the terrible conditions ex
isting and that someone else could
make the changes necessary. But
his conscience hurt him a little bit
and he quieted it by conceding a
j "no (with reservations)" on 11.
Now that his responsibility is
being pressed upon him by the
| humanitarians here (we weren't
i killed off by the passage of 14)
and elsewhere who are working
: against racism, he cries that any
pangs of of conscience and guilt
feelings he may have "have no
i basis in reality." And lie ends up
by endorsing the Fast!
I suggest that Mr. Naylor try
to be consistent: either deny his
responsibility as his brother's
'keeper entirely and endorse that
distorted rightist "Darwinism"
"the survival of the fittest." or
some over to our side and work
to alleviate the effects of man's
i inhumanity to man.
Mr. Naylor's attitude is the atti
tude which has permitted all of
the incursions against human
! rights and dignities in history.
We who acknowledge our in
! herited responsibility for all such
i wrongs ihe genocide we engaged
: in against the American Indian,
the terrible excesses by our fellow
Anglo-Saxons in Germany during

mitted by our brother Asians the
• Japanese (hiring the same war,
our part in the bombing of Hiro

jour responsibility for present con
ditions in Mississippi and else

We will participate in fasts, sit

these will help rectify our past

Dear Sir:
Recently, the students of the

cause student-faculty relation

• Dollies* Womanhood
Dear sir:
Although Mr. Meservey depicts
the attitude of Stanford women
wiili vividness, he neither explains
how it has come about nor what
can be done about it.
Since Stanford women do not
represent a cross section of the
population, they certainly share
many traits; thus generalizing
and stereotyping is fair game.
The majority come from upper
middle class homes where they
are carefully sheltered, taught
rigidly to conform, and condi
tioned to compete for grades.
They then arrive at Stanford
where a maternal dormitory sys
tem, association with people like
themselves, isolation from adults
and community, and a hosl of
men who flatter them, acting as
chauffeurs and waiters, all com
bine to reinforce the naivete and
nurture the conceit. As students
they develop. As women they re
main little girls, lacking mature
personality, domestic skills, mem
bership in the feminine sex. Con
versation is frivilous and insin-1
cere: appearance is pure and
"well-scrubbed;" behavior is with- j
in a 19th century ethical code.
At the same time that they de-(
mand to be treated like "little j
ladies," they avoid learning to
cook and sew and take an aca
demic role hitherto occupied by
men only. In short, they are not
made for this world.
Then the problem comes to a
climax; they graduate. This is
a shock, for they discover <1 > the
world is not in desperate need of
non-feminine women who have
good grades, and <2» there is a
dearth of eligible men. Since less

than 30 per cent go to graduate
school and a certain number trap
naive Stanford men, there is still
a large number who must under
go a drastic anil difficult tran
sition in adjusting to modern so
ciety.
Thus the ratio, which provides
considerable advantage to the
women while at college, does them
the most harm when they leave.
Two solutions of the problem
seems feasible: (1) do away alto
gether with the admission of wom
en to Stanford, (2) remove the ad
! mission bias and hence equalize
the ratio. Of the two, the former
is preferable, since it would
change campus social life the
least.

j ion and changes in them reflect

their application to revision of

cation of the philosophy that ihe

like to clear up the misunder
i standings that are apparent in
j the letters.
The procedure for the eommit-
I tec is as follows: when a change
! in the regulations is suggested,
the committee examines the pro
posal and its feasibility. If the
committee finds that the change
is both wanted and workable, the
i committee draws upon a concrete

Dear Sir:
There seems to be a great deal
of concern and no small amount
of controversy over the militant
leadership and dubious tactics of
l T C's Free Speech Movement.
However, the issues underlying
the conflict have been obscured j
by the emotional aspects of to
day's universal freedom move
ment.
The purpose of a university, bo
il public or private, should be i
primarily academic.
The purpose of the administra
tion should be to create an atmos-1
phere in the university comrnu- j
nity which will be conducive to
the total educational process.
Therefore it is the responsibility
of the university to assure that
people representing various ide
ologies have the opportunity to
express their positions on cam
pus. However, it is not the place
of the university to provide an
area for the solicitation of funds
and membership for those politi
cal groups. In doing so, the uni
versity is associating itself with
a particular political organization,
rather than fulfilling the purpose
of supplying access to different '
political concepts.
The name. Free Speech Move
ment, is misleading. The students
of the University of California

Rather, Mario Savio and his col

Dear Sir:
Any doubts one might have had
about Mr. Naylor's "political phil
osophy" two weeks ago w hen we
saw him promote the election of
Barry Goldwater and recommend
a "no" vote on Proposition 14
should have been resolved when
his editorial "The Fast for Free
dom" appeared in the Dail.v last
Tuesday.
Mr. Naylor's outburst, disclaim
ing his (or "our") responsibility
for what goes on in Mississippi as
"hogwash," and calling the docu
mentation and the literature beim r

used to promote the Fast for Free
dom "cheap emotionalism," be
trays itself as an emotional reac
tion. That he then goes on to urge
student participation in the Fast
is no more logical than his Gold
water-anti-14 stand.
I presume that he endorsed
Goldwater and his "status quo"
policy on race relations because he
felt that someone else was respon
sible for the terrible conditions ex
isting and that someone else could
make the changes necessary. But
his conscience hurt him a little bit
and he quieted it by conceding a
j "no (with reservations)" on 11.
Now that his responsibility is
being pressed upon him by the
| humanitarians here (we weren't
i killed off by the passage of 14)
and elsewhere who are working
: against racism, he cries that any
pangs of of conscience and guilt
feelings he may have "have no
i basis in reality." And lie ends up
by endorsing the Fast!
I suggest that Mr. Naylor try
to be consistent: either deny his
responsibility as his brother's
'keeper entirely and endorse that
distorted rightist "Darwinism"
"the survival of the fittest." or
some over to our side and work
to alleviate the effects of man's
i inhumanity to man.
Mr. Naylor's attitude is the atti
tude which has permitted all of
the incursions against human
! rights and dignities in history.
We who acknowledge our in

Currently, several interested

i To The Social Regulations
Committee:
We have long been dissatisfied
with Stanford's social regulations
| for women which we feel are in
congruous with the Fundamental
Standard. Wo agree with the
spirit of the letter from Tina Dun
gan, et al; however, practical con
siderations suggest these modifi
cations of their proposals:
1) We are in agreement with
the proposal for unlimited 2:3o's
and week-end over-nights for
freshman women since we feel
that some limitiation is helpful
in adjusting to Ihc freedom of
college life.
2) We disagree w i th th e
proposal for upper-class wom
en to sign out for a particular
hour. We feci this would be im
practicable, as it would keep
R.A.'s and night-assistants up
all night checking sign-out
cards. Therefore, we counter
propose thai a woman bo able
to stay out until 12:00 p.m.
without signing out and after
that have the option of signing
out for a laic leave or an over
night. Sign-out time for a late
leave would be 7:00 a.m. Sign
ing out for an overnight would
be, in effect, signing out until
twelve the next night. The 7:00
a.m. sign-in is not an arbitrary
limit, but is designed for the
woman's protection since there
should be a set time when offi
cials start checking in case
some mishap has occurred. Late
leaves and overnights would bo
unlimited.
3> We agree that companion
and destination should bo left
to the discretion of the woman,
in keeping with the funda
mental standard.
D We agree that dishonesty
should be grounds for discipli
nary action, but we feel that
"irresponsibility" should be de
leted from 1 lie proposal as it is
vague and essentially meaning
less here.

• Dollies* Womanhood
Dear sir:
Although Mr. Meservey depicts
the attitude of Stanford women
wiili vividness, he neither explains
how it has come about nor what
can be done about it.
Since Stanford women do not
represent a cross section of the
population, they certainly share
many traits; thus generalizing
and stereotyping is fair game.
The majority come from upper
middle class homes where they
are carefully sheltered, taught
rigidly to conform, and condi
tioned to compete for grades.
They then arrive at Stanford
where a maternal dormitory sys
tem, association with people like
themselves, isolation from adults
and community, and a hosl of
men who flatter them, acting as
chauffeurs and waiters, all com
bine to reinforce the naivete and
nurture the conceit. As students
they develop. As women they re
main little girls, lacking mature
personality, domestic skills, mem
bership in the feminine sex. Con
versation is frivilous and insin-1
cere: appearance is pure and
"well-scrubbed;" behavior is with- j
in a 19th century ethical code.
At the same time that they de-(
mand to be treated like "little j
ladies," they avoid learning to
cook and sew and take an aca
demic role hitherto occupied by
men only. In short, they are not
made for this world.
Then the problem comes to a
climax; they graduate. This is
a shock, for they discover <1 > the
world is not in desperate need of
non-feminine women who have
good grades, and <2» there is a
dearth of eligible men. Since less

than 30 per cent go to graduate
school and a certain number trap
naive Stanford men, there is still
a large number who must under
go a drastic anil difficult tran
sition in adjusting to modern so
ciety.
Thus the ratio, which provides
considerable advantage to the
women while at college, does them
the most harm when they leave.
Two solutions of the problem
seems feasible: (1) do away alto
gether with the admission of wom
en to Stanford, (2) remove the ad
! mission bias and hence equalize
the ratio. Of the two, the former
is preferable, since it would

Dear sir:
Although Mr. Meservey depicts
the attitude of Stanford women
wiili vividness, he neither explains
how it has come about nor what
can be done about it.
Since Stanford women do not
represent a cross section of the
population, they certainly share
many traits; thus generalizing
and stereotyping is fair game.
The majority come from upper
middle class homes where they
are carefully sheltered, taught
rigidly to conform, and condi
tioned to compete for grades.
They then arrive at Stanford
where a maternal dormitory sys
tem, association with people like
themselves, isolation from adults
and community, and a hosl of
men who flatter them, acting as
chauffeurs and waiters, all com
bine to reinforce the naivete and
nurture the conceit. As students
they develop. As women they re
main little girls, lacking mature
personality, domestic skills, mem
bership in the feminine sex. Con
versation is frivilous and insin-1
cere: appearance is pure and
"well-scrubbed;" behavior is with- j
in a 19th century ethical code.
At the same time that they de-(
mand to be treated like "little j
ladies," they avoid learning to
cook and sew and take an aca
demic role hitherto occupied by
men only. In short, they are not
made for this world.
Then the problem comes to a
climax; they graduate. This is
a shock, for they discover <1 > the
world is not in desperate need of
non-feminine women who have
good grades, and <2» there is a
dearth of eligible men. Since less

than 30 per cent go to graduate
school and a certain number trap
naive Stanford men, there is still
a large number who must under
go a drastic anil difficult tran
sition in adjusting to modern so
ciety.
Thus the ratio, which provides
considerable advantage to the
women while at college, does them
the most harm when they leave.
Two solutions of the problem
seems feasible: (1) do away alto
gether with the admission of wom
en to Stanford, (2) remove the ad
! mission bias and hence equalize
the ratio. Of the two, the former
is preferable, since it would
change campus social life the

Dear Sir:
There seems to be a great deal

of controversy over the militant

However, the issues underlying
the conflict have been obscured j
by the emotional aspects of to

The purpose of a university, bo
il public or private, should be i
primarily academic.
The purpose of the administra
tion should be to create an atmos-1

Therefore it is the responsibility
of the university to assure that
people representing various ide

express their positions on cam
pus. However, it is not the place
of the university to provide an
area for the solicitation of funds
and membership for those politi
cal groups. In doing so, the uni
versity is associating itself with
a particular political organization,
rather than fulfilling the purpose
of supplying access to different '

The name. Free Speech Move

Dear Sir:
Any doubts one might have had
about Mr. Naylor's "political phil
osophy" two weeks ago w hen we
saw him promote the election of
Barry Goldwater and recommend
a "no" vote on Proposition 14
should have been resolved when
his editorial "The Fast for Free
dom" appeared in the Dail.v last
Tuesday.
Mr. Naylor's outburst, disclaim
ing his (or "our") responsibility
for what goes on in Mississippi as
"hogwash," and calling the docu
mentation and the literature beim r

used to promote the Fast for Free
dom "cheap emotionalism," be
trays itself as an emotional reac
tion. That he then goes on to urge
student participation in the Fast
is no more logical than his Gold
water-anti-14 stand.
I presume that he endorsed
Goldwater and his "status quo"
policy on race relations because he
felt that someone else was respon
sible for the terrible conditions ex
isting and that someone else could
make the changes necessary. But
his conscience hurt him a little bit
and he quieted it by conceding a
j "no (with reservations)" on 11.
Now that his responsibility is
being pressed upon him by the
| humanitarians here (we weren't
i killed off by the passage of 14)
and elsewhere who are working
: against racism, he cries that any
pangs of of conscience and guilt
feelings he may have "have no
i basis in reality." And lie ends up
by endorsing the Fast!
I suggest that Mr. Naylor try
to be consistent: either deny his
responsibility as his brother's
'keeper entirely and endorse that
distorted rightist "Darwinism"
"the survival of the fittest." or
some over to our side and work
to alleviate the effects of man's
i inhumanity to man.
Mr. Naylor's attitude is the atti
tude which has permitted all of
the incursions against human
! rights and dignities in history.
We who acknowledge our in
! herited responsibility for all such
i wrongs ihe genocide we engaged
: in against the American Indian,
the terrible excesses by our fellow
Anglo-Saxons in Germany during
!the last war, the atrocities com
mitted by our brother Asians the
• Japanese (hiring the same war,
our part in the bombing of Hiro

jour responsibility for present con
ditions in Mississippi and else
where in this wonderful country
we are contrite.
We will participate in fasts, sit
| ins, and the like, if we think that
these will help rectify our past
mistakes. Our consciences will not
j cease to bother us because of

EDITOR'S NOTE: The con
j eept of "inherited responsibil
ity" for the actions of our an
cestors or people of other so
j cieties (such as Mississippi) is,
we still feel, absurd. One can
regret that these deeds were
done, one can attempt to make
) right what we consider wrongs,
; but to feel a guilt for social
wrongs is to feel guilty for
j something totally out of one's
i control, to feel as though one
somehow contributed to those
social evils when such respon
sibility is impossible.
What does one do if one just
does not feel guilty and "con
trite" and yet does want to see
existing injustice alleviated?
We suggest, that such individ
uals should continue to make
their contributions, or else Mr.
MeShean's cause will be badly
hurt.
• Penn. U. Honor (.ode
Dear Sir:
Recently, the students of the
University of Pennsylvania were
offered a compromised Hon or
System which proved to be unac
ceptable due to a poorly worded
and ill-conceived third party
clause. The proposal was rejected
overwhelmingly.
Currently, several interested
students are trying to revitalize
the concept of a true Honor Sys
tem and will shortly ask the sup
port of the Student Body and
Faculty through a petition. Be
cause student-faculty relation
ships at Penn are very poor, and
both groups are notoriously apa
thetic about undergraduate af
fairs, there is a feeling a m on g
many students, especially upper
classmen, that an Honor System
would not work at Penn. They
need encouragement from out
side?. from students and faculty
who appreciate the merits of their
own Honor System.
Therefore, 1 would like to ask
interested students and faculty
members of Stanford University
to write letters explaining what
the Honor System means to you
as individuals, and demonstrating
that tho Honor System does work
in reality.
Please address letters to the
Editor, Daily Pennsylvanian. Sar
geant Hall, University of Penn

Thank you very much.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The con
j eept of "inherited responsibil
ity" for the actions of our an
cestors or people of other so
j cieties (such as Mississippi) is,
we still feel, absurd. One can
regret that these deeds were
done, one can attempt to make
) right what we consider wrongs,
; but to feel a guilt for social
wrongs is to feel guilty for
j something totally out of one's
i control, to feel as though one
somehow contributed to those
social evils when such respon
sibility is impossible.
What does one do if one just
does not feel guilty and "con
trite" and yet does want to see
existing injustice alleviated?
We suggest, that such individ
uals should continue to make
their contributions, or else Mr.

• Penn. U. Honor (.ode
Dear Sir:
Recently, the students of the
University of Pennsylvania were
offered a compromised Hon or
System which proved to be unac
ceptable due to a poorly worded
and ill-conceived third party
clause. The proposal was rejected
overwhelmingly.
Currently, several interested
students are trying to revitalize
the concept of a true Honor Sys
tem and will shortly ask the sup
port of the Student Body and
Faculty through a petition. Be
cause student-faculty relation
ships at Penn are very poor, and
both groups are notoriously apa
thetic about undergraduate af
fairs, there is a feeling a m on g
many students, especially upper
classmen, that an Honor System
would not work at Penn. They
need encouragement from out
side?. from students and faculty
who appreciate the merits of their
own Honor System.
Therefore, 1 would like to ask
interested students and faculty
members of Stanford University
to write letters explaining what
the Honor System means to you
as individuals, and demonstrating
that tho Honor System does work
in reality.
Please address letters to the
Editor, Daily Pennsylvanian. Sar

propose thai a woman bo able

Dear sir:
Although Mr. Meservey depicts
the attitude of Stanford women
wiili vividness, he neither explains
how it has come about nor what
can be done about it.
Since Stanford women do not
represent a cross section of the
population, they certainly share
many traits; thus generalizing
and stereotyping is fair game.
The majority come from upper
middle class homes where they
are carefully sheltered, taught
rigidly to conform, and condi
tioned to compete for grades.
They then arrive at Stanford
where a maternal dormitory sys
tem, association with people like
themselves, isolation from adults
and community, and a hosl of
men who flatter them, acting as
chauffeurs and waiters, all com
bine to reinforce the naivete and
nurture the conceit. As students
they develop. As women they re
main little girls, lacking mature
personality, domestic skills, mem
bership in the feminine sex. Con
versation is frivilous and insin-1
cere: appearance is pure and
"well-scrubbed;" behavior is with- j
in a 19th century ethical code.
At the same time that they de-(
mand to be treated like "little j
ladies," they avoid learning to
cook and sew and take an aca
demic role hitherto occupied by
men only. In short, they are not
made for this world.
Then the problem comes to a
climax; they graduate. This is
a shock, for they discover <1 > the
world is not in desperate need of
non-feminine women who have
good grades, and <2» there is a
dearth of eligible men. Since less

than 30 per cent go to graduate
school and a certain number trap
naive Stanford men, there is still
a large number who must under
go a drastic anil difficult tran
sition in adjusting to modern so
ciety.
Thus the ratio, which provides
considerable advantage to the
women while at college, does them
the most harm when they leave.
Two solutions of the problem
seems feasible: (1) do away alto
gether with the admission of wom
en to Stanford, (2) remove the ad
! mission bias and hence equalize
the ratio. Of the two, the former
is preferable, since it would
change campus social life the

Dear Sir:
There seems to be a great deal

However, the issues underlying

The purpose of the administra

Therefore it is the responsibility

Dear Sir:
Any doubts one might have had
about Mr. Naylor's "political phil
osophy" two weeks ago w hen we
saw him promote the election of
Barry Goldwater and recommend
a "no" vote on Proposition 14
should have been resolved when
his editorial "The Fast for Free
dom" appeared in the Dail.v last
Tuesday.
Mr. Naylor's outburst, disclaim
ing his (or "our") responsibility
for what goes on in Mississippi as
"hogwash," and calling the docu
mentation and the literature beim r

used to promote the Fast for Free
dom "cheap emotionalism," be
trays itself as an emotional reac
tion. That he then goes on to urge
student participation in the Fast
is no more logical than his Gold
water-anti-14 stand.
I presume that he endorsed
Goldwater and his "status quo"
policy on race relations because he
felt that someone else was respon
sible for the terrible conditions ex
isting and that someone else could
make the changes necessary. But
his conscience hurt him a little bit
and he quieted it by conceding a
j "no (with reservations)" on 11.
Now that his responsibility is
being pressed upon him by the
| humanitarians here (we weren't
i killed off by the passage of 14)
and elsewhere who are working
: against racism, he cries that any
pangs of of conscience and guilt
feelings he may have "have no
i basis in reality." And lie ends up
by endorsing the Fast!
I suggest that Mr. Naylor try
to be consistent: either deny his
responsibility as his brother's
'keeper entirely and endorse that
distorted rightist "Darwinism"
"the survival of the fittest." or
some over to our side and work
to alleviate the effects of man's
i inhumanity to man.
Mr. Naylor's attitude is the atti
tude which has permitted all of
the incursions against human
! rights and dignities in history.
We who acknowledge our in
! herited responsibility for all such
i wrongs ihe genocide we engaged
: in against the American Indian,
the terrible excesses by our fellow
Anglo-Saxons in Germany during
!the last war, the atrocities com
mitted by our brother Asians the
• Japanese (hiring the same war,
our part in the bombing of Hiro
shima and Nagasaki, and finally
jour responsibility for present con
ditions in Mississippi and else
where in this wonderful country
we are contrite.
We will participate in fasts, sit

• Keel (ionlrile, Or Kltse
Dear Sir:
Any doubts one might have had
about Mr. Naylor's "political phil
osophy" two weeks ago w hen we
saw him promote the election of
Barry Goldwater and recommend
a "no" vote on Proposition 14
should have been resolved when
his editorial "The Fast for Free
dom" appeared in the Dail.v last
Tuesday.
Mr. Naylor's outburst, disclaim
ing his (or "our") responsibility
for what goes on in Mississippi as
"hogwash," and calling the docu
mentation and the literature beim r

used to promote the Fast for Free
dom "cheap emotionalism," be
trays itself as an emotional reac
tion. That he then goes on to urge
student participation in the Fast
is no more logical than his Gold
water-anti-14 stand.
I presume that he endorsed
Goldwater and his "status quo"
policy on race relations because he
felt that someone else was respon
sible for the terrible conditions ex
isting and that someone else could
make the changes necessary. But
his conscience hurt him a little bit
and he quieted it by conceding a
j "no (with reservations)" on 11.
Now that his responsibility is
being pressed upon him by the
| humanitarians here (we weren't
i killed off by the passage of 14)
and elsewhere who are working
: against racism, he cries that any
pangs of of conscience and guilt
feelings he may have "have no
i basis in reality." And lie ends up
by endorsing the Fast!
I suggest that Mr. Naylor try
to be consistent: either deny his
responsibility as his brother's
'keeper entirely and endorse that
distorted rightist "Darwinism"
"the survival of the fittest." or
some over to our side and work
to alleviate the effects of man's
i inhumanity to man.
Mr. Naylor's attitude is the atti
tude which has permitted all of
the incursions against human
! rights and dignities in history.
We who acknowledge our in
! herited responsibility for all such
i wrongs ihe genocide we engaged
: in against the American Indian,
the terrible excesses by our fellow
Anglo-Saxons in Germany during
!the last war, the atrocities com
mitted by our brother Asians the
• Japanese (hiring the same war,
our part in the bombing of Hiro
shima and Nagasaki, and finally
jour responsibility for present con
ditions in Mississippi and else
where in this wonderful country
we are contrite.
We will participate in fasts, sit
| ins, and the like, if we think that
these will help rectify our past
mistakes. Our consciences will not
j cease to bother us because of
J these actions, as Mr. Naylor seems
i to think.
We invite Mr. Naylor to ac
j knowledge his responsibility and
I join us.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The con
j eept of "inherited responsibil
ity" for the actions of our an
cestors or people of other so
j cieties (such as Mississippi) is,
we still feel, absurd. One can
regret that these deeds were
done, one can attempt to make
) right what we consider wrongs,
; but to feel a guilt for social
wrongs is to feel guilty for
j something totally out of one's
i control, to feel as though one
somehow contributed to those
social evils when such respon
sibility is impossible.
What does one do if one just
does not feel guilty and "con
trite" and yet does want to see
existing injustice alleviated?
We suggest, that such individ
uals should continue to make
their contributions, or else Mr.
MeShean's cause will be badly
hurt.
• Penn. U. Honor (.ode
Dear Sir:
Recently, the students of the
University of Pennsylvania were
offered a compromised Hon or
System which proved to be unac
ceptable due to a poorly worded
and ill-conceived third party
clause. The proposal was rejected
overwhelmingly.
Currently, several interested
students are trying to revitalize
the concept of a true Honor Sys
tem and will shortly ask the sup
port of the Student Body and
Faculty through a petition. Be
cause student-faculty relation
ships at Penn are very poor, and
both groups are notoriously apa
thetic about undergraduate af
fairs, there is a feeling a m on g
many students, especially upper
classmen, that an Honor System
would not work at Penn. They
need encouragement from out
side?. from students and faculty
who appreciate the merits of their
own Honor System.
Therefore, 1 would like to ask
interested students and faculty
members of Stanford University
to write letters explaining what
the Honor System means to you
as individuals, and demonstrating
that tho Honor System does work
in reality.
Please address letters to the
Editor, Daily Pennsylvanian. Sar
geant Hall, University of Penn
sylvania. Philadelphia 1. Pa. In
dicate position, and if student,
class.
Thank you very much.
