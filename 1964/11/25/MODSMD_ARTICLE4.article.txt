# Stanford Museum: From Curios To Art

Rumor had it that the Le
land Stanford Junior .Mu
seum by dint of imagination,
courage, hard work, a 11 d
$I(MUMM>, was poking an ar
tistic head through its hole
and into the sunlight, all
other forms of lighting hav
ing failed.
Investigation w a s obvi
ously in order.
The "hole," of course, cen
tered around the museum's
image as a final resting-place
for curios collected by the
Stanford*, notably the fa
mous — and fictitious — Last
Meal of Little Leland.
Since Jane Stanford's day,
the museum has been consid
ered. more-or-less accurately,
as little more than a reflec
tion of the family tastes in
art and souvenirs.
Its chief attraction was
that, as the first steel-rein
forced concrete building in
the U.S.. it survived the IJKMi
earthquake — although many
considered its survival merely
an indication of the archi
tects' lack of foresight.
The rigid Will and lack of
funds made change almost
impossible.
But under Dr. Lorenz Eit
ner the museum is seeking
to end the family image, or
at least push it into the back*
ground.
With tin* present grant, Dr.
Eitner is attempting to re
habilitate the galleries, some
of which are as primitive as
the Egyptian and Cypriot art
they once held. He is also
rearranging the exhibits to
emphasize th c museum's
function as a reflection of his
torical trends in art.
A visitor first sees the
unique exterior, which, with
its two-dimensional architec
ture and adorning mosaics,
dooks like a M't from "Sodom
and Gomorrah."
The stone figures of Men
andro and Fedc, looking sur

prisingly like Owtrfff (Super
man) Reeves and Mirlene
Dietrich, gaze at each intru
der as they liave for 73 years.
Rut inside it's different. It
looks as much like a movie
theater as it docs a museum,
hut the "C losed" signs on the
doors ami the hammering in
side indicate that something
is going on.
After the golden spike, the
family portraits, and Jane's
honorary regency in the
D.A.R., t li<> Stanford family
loses much of its 'harm to
museum visitors. The Stan
ford room is the only one
open downstairs.
But when the hammering
is through, collections of
Western, Oriental, and an
cient Near-Eastern art will lie
displayed in newly-painted,
•lit, and -carpeted downstairs
galleries.
Currently upstairs is a
modern art exhibit that would
have started the staid Stan
ford s.
In a bewildering array of
contemporary Bay Are a
works are such works as.
"Docs an Englishman's Blood
Have Red Corpuscles?," "You
Said You Would But You
Didn't," ami a twisted arch
of tortured steel entitled
"Mississippi River'' that
makes one yearn for the sim
ple, concrete realism of Mem
Claw.
Contemporary art, accord
ing to Dr. Eitner, will play
an important role in the mu
seum's new image. Side-by
side with displays of primi
tive art will be an upstairs
modern (1800-present) gal
lery.
"We're not just cleaning
out the basement," dee-lured
Dr. Eitner. "We're rebuilding
each gallery for a purpose."
And, as he said on television
(Channel 9's "Encounters")
Monday night, "The purpose
is to provide a valuable his
torical showcase of art for
the community."
Still, though, they could
find room for the Last Meal
of Little Leland. No Stanford
Museum would be really com
plete without it.
