# May Speaks On English Literature
## Relates Influence To French Prose 
### BOB DAVIS 
Delivering the second William
Haas Memorial Lecture for the
Tuesday evening series last
night, Georges (Maude May, pro
fessor of French at Vale, exa
mined Ihe influence of the Eng
lish novel on fiction in eighteenth
century Franco.
Attacking those critics who saw
the eighteenth as ihe truly
French century in writing, May
stated that French literature
strikes us as "unintelligible if
we try to isolate ii from other
literature of the time, especially
English."
"Until nearly 1760," Professor-
May pointed out, "novels in
France were held in ill-repute.
Novel writing was on the same
level with atheism and prostitu
tion in public opinion."
The professor remarked that it
is very difficult for us to realize
that tiie French at this time were
much more prudish than the Eng
lish.
BUT EVIDENCE, explained
May. points to an "unprecedented
and tremendous vogue of English
novels in France during the mid
eighteenth century."
French critics admired the
moral effect of English novels and
their realism. But. explained Pro
lessor May, both realism and
moralism appeared in earlier
French fiction. "The great Eng
lish innovation was the develop
ment of an original formula for
combining the two elements."
The English novelists con
nected conventional middle-class
morality with realism devoid of
prudishness. French novels h a d
been either "realistic and im
moral" or moralistic and fanci
ful.
PROFESSOR MAY stated that
in 17-12, with the publication of
Richardson's Pamela, the French
saw that a novelist could have
r "the highest moral intentions"
land yet describe with realism un
| savory characters and behavior.
May concluded that the most
important and valid influence of
'he English novelists on their
I French counterparts was the
"lending of their weight" lo an
unpopular genre. Significantly,
the French discovered that "good
writers could write novels."
