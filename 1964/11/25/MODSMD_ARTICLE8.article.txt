## Faculty Censures Cal Turmoil 
### KIRK HANSON 
Dean 11. Donald Winbigler and several faculty
j and staff members yesterday expressed their sup-
I port for political freedom on the University of
j California, campus. However, most ol Ihose inter
i viewed emphasized that thcy did not svmpathi/e
with the tactics used by the groups involved.
Professor Robert A. Morn of the Political
[Science Department pointed out the complexity
of the situation on th< Cal campus. He noted that
state legislation exists which limits political activ
ity on state land and that university regulations
have been built on these state laws.
A('< ORIHNG TO Winbigler, the problem is
'further complicated by the many off-campus p«>l i
tieal groups which have entered the controversy.
I He mentioned that many of those involved were
| not even registered Cal students.
Many faculty and stall members refused to
] comment on the controversy at Berkeley. Otis
Pease, professor of History and veteran of the
Mississippi Freedom Project, was one of these.
He stated that he had signed the petition circu
lated on the Stanford campus last week and would
stand on this position. The petition supported the
freedom of political activity and rejected the Unl
versity's light to limit free speech.
Opinion differed greatly on the effect of the
Free Speech Movement on the political freedom .
movement. Some such as Professor Pease tcltß
illie FSM had been leading the eont i o\n sj fnim

its beginning. Others saw an alteration of the
political freedom movement by the FSM. One
staff member said he thought the original conten
tions had given way to unreasonable demands for
immunity by the FSM. The FSM is demanding
that the University be denied the right to discipline
students for illegal off-campus political activity.
DEAN WINBIGLER strongly criticized the
use of the term "free speech" by the Free Speech
Movement. He said: "Free Speech is not the main
issue. The main issue is rather one of the time,
circumstances, and location for the solicitation of
funds for political activities."
In regard to free speech on the California cam
pus, he said the University has a very liberal policy
concerning the expression of ideas and that he
could not then understand any meaning of free,
speech in the controversy.
The general consensus is that neither the Uni-
versity of California nor the objectives of political
freedom and free speech have been aided by the
Cal turmoil. The national publicity and misunder
standing are seen as detrimental to all involved.
Dean Winbigler compared the Cal controversy
to situations which have arisen here at Stanford.
He said il was very difficult to compare such inci
dents but that no Stanford controversy had ever
involved so many off-campus groups nor attracted
so much national attention. He felt that even the
.Ross Case in early Stanford history and the De
fense Shelter conflict of two years ago caused
less turmoil than the current controversy at Cal.
