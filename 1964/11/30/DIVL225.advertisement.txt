King David's royal family line; and by rising from the dead He proved Himself
to be the mighty Son of God, with the holy nature of God Himself.
"And now through Christ, all the kindness of God has been poured out upon us
undeserving sinners, and now lie is sending us out around the world to tell all people
everywhere the great tilings God has done for them, so that they too will believe
and obey Him. And you, dear friends in Home, are among those He dearly loves;
you. too, are invited to be llis very own, yes His holy people. May all God's mercies
and peace be yours from God our Father and from Jesus Christ our Lord . . .
"I am not ashamed of the Good News about ( lirist. It is God's powerful method
of bringing all who belicvi it to heaven. Ibis message was preached first to the
Jews alone, but now everjotie is invited to come to God in this same way. This
Good New.- tills us that God makes us ready for heaven -good in His eyes when
we put our faith and trust in Christ to save us. And the more we trust Him the
more clearly we can see that Hi has taken away our sins ; md filled us with His
goodness. As the Old Testament says it, the mail who titids life will find it through
trusting Cod" (Romans 1:1 -7,1«»-17 Living Letters Translation).
