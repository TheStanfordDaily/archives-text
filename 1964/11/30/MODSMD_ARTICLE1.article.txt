• I iet Funeral Results lu Riot
SAIGON, South Viet Nam — Vietnamese
paratroopers swinging rifle butts waded into
a Buddhist funeral procession yesterday after
it turned into a sitdown demonstration against
the government of Premier Van Tran Huong.
There also were anti-U.S. overtones.
The funeral was for a 15-year-old boy whom
the Buddhists claimed was shot to death by
government forces during an antigovernment
demonstration last week. After clashing with
about 2,000 demonstrators, the paratroopers
seized the coffin, shoved the boy's family into
a hearse and took them off to the cemetery.

LEOPOLDVILLE, The Congo Belgian
paratroopers pulled out of the Congo yester

still in rebel territory.

Diplomatic sources in Leopoldville said one
more air drop of the Belgians had been planned
—most likely at Bunia where several hundred
foreigners are believed trapped.
Reports from refugees coming out of rebel
territory tell of maddened rebels, who fled the
Belgians at Stanleyville and Paul is last week,
being intent upon murdering all whites they
could get their hands on.

• Mars Shot Picks IP rong Star
PASADENA Spacecraft Mariner 4 chose
the wrong star yesterday as its heavenly guide
post toward Mars, but scientists expected to
bring their wayward marvel firmly back on
course.

"Il was expected this could happen. It cer
tainly doesn't jeopardize the mission or the
spacecraft," said a spokesman for the Jet Pro
pulsion Laboratory, where Mariner 4 was built.
An Atlas-Agena booster hurled the space
ship from Cape Kennedy, Fla., on Saturday on
a 7-month, 325-million-mile voyage to the vi
cinity of Mars.
If all goes well, the craft will televise up
to 22 pictures of the Martian surface from
about 10,000 miles away during a 30-minute
flyby next July and send them back to earth.
• Mass Said In English
Millions of American Roman Catholics wor
shiped in the English language yesterday —
instead of the time-honored Latin — as a new
liturgy for the Mass took effect.
The reaction of both priest and parishioner,
generally, was enthusiastic.
In addition to replacing Latin with English,
the new liturgy embodies other changes. The
priest now faces the congregation as he cole

brates the Mass, instead of turning his back.
Worshipers take a more active part in pray

The reforms were authorized by the V'ati
