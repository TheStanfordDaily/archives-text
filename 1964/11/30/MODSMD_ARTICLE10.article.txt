# Magazine Outlawed At Union
## TMU Board Votes To Ban 'Realist' 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM 
The Tresidder Union Hoard
has decided to halt sale of the
magazine, "Realist," in the Union
store because it is "offensive, ol
poor quality and not in demand,'
Tom Riles, president of the board,
said yesterday.
"We are not trying to keep the
magazine away from here," Riles
emphasized. "Censorship wasn't
the issue at all. We wanted to
keep the space open for other
magazines."
HOWEVER, Riles indicated the
quality of tho magazine was a fac
tor in the board's decision.
The board found the publication
offensive because it was "porno
graphic" and contains "profane
words" and "objectionable car
toons," Riles said.
"We had to make a value
judgment," he said. "If the maga
zine really had some quality we
could excuse it."
The board, consisting of nine
students who review Tresidder
Union policy, voted five to four to
remove the satire and humor
magazine from the shelves.
ItILES SA11) Ihe "policy deci
sion" was "normal procedure."
Because of the closeness of the
board's vote, the matter was re
ferred to the Tresidder Union
Committe which Tuesday upheld
Ihe board's decision. This commit
tee is a faculty-student advisory
group.
The magazine came to the at
tention of the board as a result of
a letter of complaint to Stanford
President Wallace Sterling. The
letter was eventually referred to
the board.
A VISITOR to the campus from
Illinois registered the complaint.
According to Riles, few copies
of the magazine have been sold
at the store, but lately sales have
increased because th e Union
Board has purchased copies for
members conducting the investi
gation.
The bookstore manager could
not be reached yesterday for com
ment.
Riles also said the manager had
not yet been informed of th e
board's decision and thcrefoiv re
maining copies of the magazine
are still available at the Union.
"Realist" is published monthly
in New York but Riles said issues
appear "inconsistently."
Unofficial sources reported the
magazine has been sold at the
Union store for several months.
A wide variety of magazines are
sold at the store, Riles said.
"We have the address of the
magazine if any students care to
subscribe to it," Riles added.
