# New Mathematics Corner Stimulated By Sloan Gift

The new facilities of the 1 Alfred P. Sloan Mathematics Center
were first opened this September. This center, the new Math Cor
ner, is the result of the complete remodeling of the old Physics Cor
ner at a cost of $2,194,300, including a gift of $1,000,000 from the
i Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.

The original building, part of<
the University complex built in |
1899, has boon reconstructed to 1
add a fifth floor, seminar rooms, j
faculty and student lounges, num-1
erous offices for professors and
teaching assistants, additional
class and lecture rooms, and a li
brary.
BEFORE THE building was re
done, it housed physics, mathe
matics, and statistics classes.
Especially representative of the
planning that went: into the new
Center is the library. Besides the
r 11,200 books and several periodi
cals on subjects pertaining to
mathematics that it offers, the
! library has carpeting which re
j stricts noise extremely well and
gives the room a congenial atmos
: phere in which to study.
In addition, there are two Quiet
, Rooms, having blackboards where
I groups of students may go to
j work out problems, and an out
j side terrace that opens to a view
! of the courtyard below and th e
j foothills beyond the Quad.
At present, plans for the dedica

tion ceremonies are still incom
plete, but December 11. 1965 now
seems to be the probable date.
