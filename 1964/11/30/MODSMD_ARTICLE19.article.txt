# PAC Selects Oregon State Over Trojans
## 
### PETER EAKLAND 
The Rose Bowl, the oldest of
the New Year's Day football clas
sics, in recent years has been a
battle between the Big Ten Cham
pion and the most representative
team from the AAWU. Most rep
resentative is a phrase which re
quires in some cases almost as
much clarification as ihe words
"necessary and proper" in the
elastic clause of the U.S. Const i
! tution.
I The Supreme Court decides cases
j involving the interpretation of the
| extent of Congressional power;
I the justices who decided Saturday
j the case of Southern Cal vs. Ore
gon State were faculty representa
| tives from each of the eight mem
i ber schools of the AAWU.
Last Monday, a procedural vote
; was held by telegraph to deter
mine whether the representatives
were ready to go ahead with the
j formal vote. Unanimous consent
j was necessary but was not given
Iso the voting was put off until
' after the SC-Notre Dame game.
The SC representative undoubt
! edly was eager to put off the deci
; sion, but several others probably
' sided with him. After all, to make
'the best decision, the overall sea
json performance should be taken
i into account, especially since the
; two teams had identical 3-1 con
i ference records.
By delaying the vote, SC parti
sans felt a commendable perform
; ance against the nation's No. 1
team would earn them the vote.
They were wrong.
The closed court convened soon
! after the Trojans had pulled off
the biggest upset of the 1964 foot
ball season. The representatives
who favored a limited interpreta
: tion of "most representative"
would favor Oregon State because
its 8-2 season record was better
; than SC's 7-3 record. The broad
! interpretationists would maintain
that the thrilling comeback vie
! Tory over the Nation's N'o. 1 team
I made it the best representative.
The outcome of games
\ either or both of the aspirants and
the representative's school also
played an important role. Also,
; certain intangibles such as rela
tionships with the two schools
may have entered into representa
tives' decisions.
The breakdown of the vote was
not announced and one can only
conjecture what the final tally
was. The three northwest schools
' besides OSU probably all sided
with the Beavers. Each had lost
j to them, and the only school ol
1 the four to play SC, Washington,
• had won.
One might expect the California
| schools to likewise vote as a gioup
! for SC. Stanford because it was a
I decisive victor over the Beavers
and was edged out by the Trojans,
would likely consider SC Ihe more
representative. But it has strong
ties with the Oregon schools and
might not have wanted to give SC
the recruiting edge a Rose Bowl
appearance gives. Probably an SC
vote.
So there was a strong possibil
ity of a tie vote. A provision ex
ists for such a situation. "In case
| of a tie, the team which last ap
' peared in the Rose Bowl is elimi
nated." Enter Oregon State,
j A dissenting opinion was ut
; tered by Trojan Director of Ath-
I letics Jess Hill: "So far as I'm con
! corned it was one of the rankest
1 injustices ever perpetrated in the
j field of intercollegiate athletics."
Oregon State's coach Tommy Pro
j thro said, "I'm pleased the ath
; letie representatives saw fit to
i vote on the results of the season
instead of being emotionally
I swayed by the results of one
j game."
SC is the stronger team on
paper. Oregon State with a weak
er schedule leads in the won-loss
department. So Oregon State will
face Michigan in the Rose Bowl
' and lose. And if SC wants 1o per
form in a howl, it will have to
arrange an appearance at the
Hollywood Bowl.

I the justices who decided Saturday

Last Monday, a procedural vote
; was held by telegraph to deter

were ready to go ahead with the
j formal vote. Unanimous consent
j was necessary but was not given
Iso the voting was put off until
' after the SC-Notre Dame game.
The SC representative undoubt

' sided with him. After all, to make
'the best decision, the overall sea
json performance should be taken
i into account, especially since the
; two teams had identical 3-1 con
i ference records.
By delaying the vote, SC parti
sans felt a commendable perform
; ance against the nation's No. 1
team would earn them the vote.
They were wrong.
The closed court convened soon
! after the Trojans had pulled off
the biggest upset of the 1964 foot
ball season. The representatives
who favored a limited interpreta
: tion of "most representative"
would favor Oregon State because
its 8-2 season record was better
; than SC's 7-3 record. The broad
! interpretationists would maintain
that the thrilling comeback vie
! Tory over the Nation's N'o. 1 team
I made it the best representative.
The outcome of games
\ either or both of the aspirants and
the representative's school also
played an important role. Also,
; certain intangibles such as rela
tionships with the two schools
may have entered into representa
tives' decisions.
The breakdown of the vote was
not announced and one can only
conjecture what the final tally
was. The three northwest schools
' besides OSU probably all sided
with the Beavers. Each had lost
j to them, and the only school ol
1 the four to play SC, Washington,
• had won.
One might expect the California
| schools to likewise vote as a gioup
! for SC. Stanford because it was a
I decisive victor over the Beavers
and was edged out by the Trojans,
would likely consider SC Ihe more
representative. But it has strong
ties with the Oregon schools and
might not have wanted to give SC
the recruiting edge a Rose Bowl
appearance gives. Probably an SC
vote.
So there was a strong possibil
ity of a tie vote. A provision ex
ists for such a situation. "In case
| of a tie, the team which last ap
' peared in the Rose Bowl is elimi
nated." Enter Oregon State,
j A dissenting opinion was ut
; tered by Trojan Director of Ath-
I letics Jess Hill: "So far as I'm con
! corned it was one of the rankest

j field of intercollegiate athletics."
Oregon State's coach Tommy Pro
j thro said, "I'm pleased the ath
; letie representatives saw fit to
i vote on the results of the season
instead of being emotionally
I swayed by the results of one

SC is the stronger team on
paper. Oregon State with a weak

department. So Oregon State will
face Michigan in the Rose Bowl
' and lose. And if SC wants 1o per
