# â€˜Visitor' Discovered In Hurlburt House
## 
### 
Women's Council will meet
in emergency session tonight
to decide the case of an un
identified guest found up
stairs in Hurlburt House after
closing' hours last Wednesday
night.
The guest was first discov
ered on the second floor,
lying: unconscious in the vicin
ity of the ironing: board. His
heavy breathing" seemed to
point to excessive consumpt
ion of alcohol earlier in the
evening - .
"Now listen, girls," said the
K.A. when informed of the
violation, "you can date all
the fraternity men you want,
but I shall not tolerate such
animals upstairs in the
house."
The seriousness of the of
fense increased whe 11 the
guest was discovered asleep
in one of the girls' rooms.
"But he wouldn't wake up,"
said a member of the house,
"and lie was too heavy to
move downstairs. We didn't
want to shock any of the girls
coming in from late dates, so
we simply dragged him in
here."

Many questions will Im*
raised when the council meets
tonight. Clearly this is a case
of "conduct unbecoming: a
Stanford woman," but should
it he classed as "gross negli
gence," "deliberate dis r e -
gard," or "major violation due
to poor judgment?" And if
this sort of violation occurs
with social regulations us
they are, what could happen
if late leaves for junior and
senior women were increased
to unlimited hours?
Should this sort of case
really be judged by Women's
Council, or can the women of
liurlburt appeal to the Dean
of Women to have their case
granted particular attention
and mercy? Is an investiga
tion .into liquor violations
warranted hy (his unfortu
nate example of decadence?
At any rate the offender, a
large dog - later identified as
pitrt German shepherd and
part St. Bernard, will prob
ably be ordered suspended
from the university for the
rest of t he quarter, following;
immediate return to his own
ers.
