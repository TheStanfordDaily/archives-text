# Censorship!
## 
### 
The Realist, an off-color "humor" magazine,
apparently lias been banned from the magazine
racks of the Tresidder Union store.
Perhaps "banned" is too harsh a word, for
the Union Board merely decided last Tuesday to
take it off the market because it was "objection
able" to some and because it wasn't selling well
anyway.
The action was, to say the least, a grievious
mistake.
We do not quarrel with the board's right to
limit the selection of magazines available in the
store — space limitations require that some group
do it. And student demand for a magazine is
probably as good a criterion as any for judging
which magazines are to be sold.
What bothers us is that the action was ap
parently taken at least partly in response to a
critical letter received by the administration from
some non-student who had been shocked by the
presence of The Realist on the Tresidder maga
zine stand.
Furthermore, in banning the publication, the
Board quite frankly made "a value judgment.

labeling the magazine as "pornographic.' It ap
pears, whether accurately or not, that the Board
really was censoring the magazine and that sales
considerations were only secondary.
This changes the color of the situation en
tirely, for instead of merely making room for an
other magazine that might attract greater student
interest, the Union Board has let moral consider
ations get involved, and nothing could be better
calculated to arouse the ire of the academic com
munity.
' "What right has the Union Board," students
will ask with righteous indignation," to decide
what is 'objectionable' and what is 'acceptable'
for US to read?!" And the question will be well
taken.
Now that the blasphemy of censorship has
been implied, it is predictable that the student
body, instead of continuing to exhibit good judg
ment and refusing to waste its money on a maga
zine of very limited merit, will Hock to the
stands, and the "objectionable material will en
joy a very wide circulation indeed.
All the good intentions not withstanding, the
Union Board ought to have known better.
