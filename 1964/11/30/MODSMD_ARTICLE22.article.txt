## Which Is The Real Stanford? 
### 
Dear Sir:
The current Stanford Gaieties
was my third Gaieties experience,
and I continue to return in the
hope that the level of quality
achieved in the 1%2 performance
may some day be repeated.
If the Gaieties are nothing more
than the theatrical equivalent of
stealing Gal's cannon, putting de
tergent in Mem Claw, or soaping
windows on Halloween, i.e., if
they are nothing more than a
juvenile prank, then perhaps the
comments of this letter are un
warranted. If, however, the Gaie
ties represent a serious attempt
to present a performance meant
to be judged by normal criteria,
the situation is somewhat differ
ent.
With all flue allowance for the
traditional exuberance of under
graduate rebellion against estab
lished symbols of authority, it re
mains a sad commentary on the
contemporary outlook and ingenu
ity that the present Gaieties all
too consistently find little source
for humor in the Stanford situa
tion except in the outhouse cate
gories of blasphemy, sexual
double entendres, and vulgarity in

language. Is there really nothing
of significance worth lampooning
in life at Stanford except those
summarized in these categories?
Or is it more significant to ask
whether it can be possible that the j
Stanford undergraduate is really
so naive-find truly unsophisticated
as religion, meaningful
personal relationships, and cour
teous dignity as the most appro
priate subjects for derision?
It would appear that the Stan
ford campus community as re
flected in the many lecture series
devoted to moral, philosophical,
social, and religious concerns has
no relationship to the Stanford
campus annually depicted on the
boards of Mem And. Which is the
real Stanford?

Dear Sir:
II is amusing to see Miss Bon-!
ner's playful letter on Stanford
dates. Not only does she have the
coffee cups rattling in her dorm
(apparently an Ivory Tea Tower),

but she has Mr. Meservey pinch
ing women's hands in vises, push
ing women through crowds like
grocery carts, using women for
backrests, an d overwhelming
them in arms on the first date.
Although Mr. Meservey only
wanted to hold hands, he is de
picted as a criminally deranged
octopus.
Apparently, like many women
at Stanford, she suffers from a
kind of paranoia that asserts "all
men are out to get. her." Like
many Stanford women, she is too
optimistic. But Miss Bonner has
a particular problem: that of
"Creeping Hands." This is a ma
lady which, I have found, few
girls find troublesome, and most
girls (who marry easily) welcome.
In Miss Bonner's instance I recom
mend a bear trap. This can be
fastened to the chest and will
fend off Creeping Hands wherever
and whenever they are encoun
tered.
Mr. Meservey did not really
state that Stanford women are
frigid. However, since Miss Bon
ner seems to be bent on explaining
why their frigidity is justified,
one concludes that her letter tends
to affirm rather than deny the
existence of this social handicap.
This is unfortunate, for she holds
the position of an "inside source."

grocery carts, using women for
backrests, an d overwhelming
them in arms on the first date.
Although Mr. Meservey only
wanted to hold hands, he is de
picted as a criminally deranged
octopus.
Apparently, like many women
at Stanford, she suffers from a
kind of paranoia that asserts "all
men are out to get. her." Like
many Stanford women, she is too
optimistic. But Miss Bonner has
a particular problem: that of
"Creeping Hands." This is a ma
lady which, I have found, few
girls find troublesome, and most
girls (who marry easily) welcome.
In Miss Bonner's instance I recom
mend a bear trap. This can be
fastened to the chest and will
fend off Creeping Hands wherever
and whenever they are encoun
tered.
Mr. Meservey did not really
state that Stanford women are
frigid. However, since Miss Bon
ner seems to be bent on explaining
why their frigidity is justified,
one concludes that her letter tends
to affirm rather than deny the
existence of this social handicap.
This is unfortunate, for she holds
the position of an "inside source."

Dear Sir:
The current Stanford Gaieties
was my third Gaieties experience,
and I continue to return in the
hope that the level of quality
achieved in the 1%2 performance
may some day be repeated.
If the Gaieties are nothing more
than the theatrical equivalent of
stealing Gal's cannon, putting de
tergent in Mem Claw, or soaping
windows on Halloween, i.e., if
they are nothing more than a
juvenile prank, then perhaps the
comments of this letter are un
warranted. If, however, the Gaie
ties represent a serious attempt
to present a performance meant
to be judged by normal criteria,
the situation is somewhat differ
ent.
With all flue allowance for the
traditional exuberance of under
graduate rebellion against estab
lished symbols of authority, it re
mains a sad commentary on the
contemporary outlook and ingenu
ity that the present Gaieties all
too consistently find little source
for humor in the Stanford situa
tion except in the outhouse cate
gories of blasphemy, sexual
double entendres, and vulgarity in

language. Is there really nothing
of significance worth lampooning
in life at Stanford except those
summarized in these categories?
Or is it more significant to ask
whether it can be possible that the j
Stanford undergraduate is really
so naive-find truly unsophisticated
as religion, meaningful
personal relationships, and cour
teous dignity as the most appro
priate subjects for derision?
It would appear that the Stan
ford campus community as re
flected in the many lecture series
devoted to moral, philosophical,
social, and religious concerns has
no relationship to the Stanford
campus annually depicted on the
boards of Mem And. Which is the
real Stanford?
Sincerely,
