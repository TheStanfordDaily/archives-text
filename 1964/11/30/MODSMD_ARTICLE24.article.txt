## GOP Moderates Attack (!) LBJ's Military Cutbacks 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Where was the Republican Party when Secretary McNamara
closed down those bases? About where many suspected it would
be: opposing the shut-downs, and for reasons transparently politi
cal.
Governor Rockefeller, the leader of the left wing of the GOP,

denounced tno decision, and ail
who contributed to it, as anti-
Brooklyn, and demands recon
sideration; and Governor Scran
ton, leader of the moderate wing
of the GOP, enjoins Pennsylvan
ia's two senators and 27 congress
men to "join with the state ad
ministration in an all-out effort
to reverse this calamitous deci
sion by the Defense Department."
And so the reigning sons of the
free enterprise party choke with
indignation at a decision by a
Democratic Administration to con
sult the free enterprise system
when deciding how to go about
saving $500 million dollars of the
taxpayers' money.
Ironic Situation
The situation is twice ironic.
Ironic thai Republicans should be
cast in the role of objecting to
the federal government's cutting
down expenses, and ironic that a
Democratic Administration should
have taken the cost-cutting initia
tive in the first place. The phil
osophical disarray of the Repub
lican liberals was never put in
better focus.
If it were suggestible, let alone
provable, that the Secretary of
Defense was playing politics with
the national security, Governor
Rockefeller's position might be
understandable. But s u c h is
hardly thinkable — Brooklyn had
already been tentatively doomed
as inefficient, and now goes to
its death even after the second
most important Democrat in the
land, Mr. Robert Kennedy, ran
and was elected on a platform that
struck many voters as reducing
to, " I can do most for the Brook
lyn Navy Yard."
GOP Must Give C redit
No, galling thought it is, true
Republicans must p a y credit

where it is due, to Mr. McN'amara
in this case- for a commendable
insistence on doing the indicated
thing? If only x ships are now
needed -fewer than they ships
that were needed yesterday—then
y minus x worth of shipyards
must close down, Which ones?
The most inefficient one, Q.E.D.
Mr. MeNamara's behavior is all
the more remarkable in the light
of its obvious incongruity with
prevalent Democratic doctrine.
The Democratic Party is inform
ally pledged to subsidizing ineffi
ciency, as the alternative to ac
cepting the discipline of the free
market. We are paying seven or
eight billion dollars to farmers
to shield some of them from the
marketplace. Tens of millions go
to coal miners to guard them from
economic reality. Ditto to protect
some of our businessmen from
foreign competition. Ditto to in
sulate hundreds of thousands
from wages which, in the free
market, would fall below the offi
cial minimum.
GOP Wellarists
So that while we have here, in
i this mixed-up affair, a Democrat
| acting against Democratic prae
| tice, we have Republicans acting
like the hottest welfarists in town.
Neither Mr. Rockefeller nor Mr.
Scran ton has said a word, on the
published record of their effusive
protests, about why it is that their
yards should have become so in
efficient. Because to say what
needs to be said is politically ta
boo.
What happened is that the yards
! in question could not compete be
j cause labor unions had been exact
| ing artificially high wages, a n d
because bureaucratic and politi
cal impositions (remember, these
are government-owned yards) irn
; pose extra burdens. The Republi
! cans had an opportunity to react
j to Mr. MeNamara's action not by
; saying I-told-you-so with any
j sense of satisfaction—(Republi
cans should join with Democrats
!in doing every thing in their
i power to care for (he dispossessed
] workers until they arc settled
j elsewhere) but rather to say I
! told-you-so in the sense of bring
ing home to the electorate the
1 risks of phoney ing up the cost of
doing business in a free society
