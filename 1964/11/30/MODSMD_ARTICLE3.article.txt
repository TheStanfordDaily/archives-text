# Trevor-Roper To Lecture On Hitlerâ€™s Role In History
## 
### 
Dr. Trevor-Roper, Regius Pro
fessor of Modern History at Ox
ford University, will speak Wed
nesday evening in Memorial Audi
torium. Entitled "Hitler's Place in
History." the talk will he followed
by a question and answer period
in which the audience may par
ticipate.
Dr. Ralph A. Lutz, Chairman
emeritus of the Hoover Institu
tion and now senior historian on
the Hoover staff, will preside at
the lecture.
In the addition to l>oing a recog
nized authority on Hitler's Ger
many and the author of such

books as "The Last Days of Hit
ler" and "Hitler's Table Talk,"
Dr. Trevor-Roper has gained fame
as an academician and critic.
His attack on Arnold Toynbee's
Study of History has prevented
more general acceptance of the
Toynbee theses and has made
their author a controversial fig
ure in the scholarly world.
This and other assaults on es
tablished authorities have given
Trevor-Roper a reputation and a
position which is as controversial
as those of his victims. He has
not often been accused of being
dull.
Because of the expected inter
est in Dr. Trevor-Roper's appear
ance, his first before a Stanford
audience, the first four rows in
Memorial Auditorium will be re
served for faculty and staff mem
bers and special guests. Remain
ing seats will be available on a
first-come basis.
