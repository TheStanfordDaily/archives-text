President Wallace Sterling lias
tppointed a new faculty-admin
istration committee on "Educa
tional Opportunities for Disad
vantaged Minorities to study
and make recommendations in
this area of minority group prob
lems.
According to the chairman,
Dean Robert M. Rosenzweig of
the Graduate Division, the com
mittee will "explore ways in
which this university can be use
ful in promoting educational op
portunities for Negroes and other
minority groups, either working
through Stanford or in discover
in" ways to raise the quality of
Negro and minority education in
general."
ROSENZWEIG explained that
the committee's first task will be
to find out exactly what is going
on at Stanford now in the way
of minority-education activities.
"Some small projects have been
started," he added.
The Dean cited the example of
a medical school program through
which high school students have
been brought to the campus to
observe and work in the labora
tories. The program, begun last
summer, is continuing through
the academic year and will be ex
panded next summer.
Dr. Leonard A. Herzenberg of
the medical school explained the
project gives culturally disadvan
taged students the incentive to
improve their high school grades
and encourages those qualified to
attend college. The project has
been ''quite successful" in terms
of student response.
THi; NEW COMMITTEE ex
|peets to canvas the faculty to
j learn how much interest there
{would be in a summer institute,
| or in some other similar project.
Rosenzweig stated that in gen

j dealing with minority educational
problems. The committee would
jlike to "point efforts in the right
i direction."
"It's too early to say if the com
|mittee will be permanent," Ro
senzweig explained.
