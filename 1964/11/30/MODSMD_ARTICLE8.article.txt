# STANFORD POLL STRIKES AGAIN
## Dating Myths Destroyed 
### First in a Series) By SUSAN HEILMANN 
"Nino out of ten college coeds are beauti
ful the tenth one goes to Stanford."
If a freshman learns nothing else about
the Farm during an entire weekend of pre
reg, he comes to know one thing very well:
the Stanford dating situation, at least as il
is described by (he Stanford students, must
surely be the nation's worst.
IT IS HAILED in glaring generalities
you have to call a girl three weeks in ad
vance for a date, all the decent frosh dollies
are snatched up by senior frat men, all the
cute ones are atrocious snobs. It's the one
thing everyone dislikes the most.
And yet, wondering voices are occasion
ally heard to question those revered re
marks. Amazingly enough, a few brave
souls may give it cautious praise.
Always alert and receptive to the cry of
oppressed students, the Daily has lately felt
honor-bound to champion their cause. In
the best traditions of courageous, respon
sible journalism, it has conducted a student
poll of the Stanford dating situation.
ITS RESULTS arc truly impressive.
Eager to share these findings with its read
ers, the Daily now begins a series ol articles
to attack the dating myths.
It* sincerely hopes, that, once all Stanford
students are freed from the subservience
of ignorance and made aware of the hope

that is theirs, militants of both sexes may
find true bliss in peaceful coexistence.
MYTH I: Despite frosh dollies' cries to
ihe contrary, the survey shows that MOST
females have two dates a week, and many
have three and oven four.
MALICS AREN'T quite so lucky. Their
usual quota is one or two. A substantial
number of frosh males, especially, expressed
difficulty in managing more than one. How
ever. the survey results maintain that over
half of the student body DO have one or
two dates per week.
MYTH II: Although fellows claim the
necessity of making dates three weeks in
advance, a whopping majority of both male
and female students report that their dates
are made within two to five days.
However, a discrepancy arises. Over
three-quarters of the women report two to
five days. Barely under half of the men do
likewise. Many men also tell of making
dates a week in advance.
(jI'KSTION: With whom are those week
in-advance dates being made?
MYTH III: Replies are also in order for
Ihe students who wail, "I'd be happy to date
just one or two people. It's the opposite
st'X who insist on making a contest of how
many persons they can string along."
A majority of students do indeed report
thai they date one or two persons. On this
both sexes agree. A majority from both
sexes (mid especially females* also agree

that "one mainly several occasionally" is
the IDEAL dating situation.
BUT ASK TIIEM what the opposite sex
considers ideal, and it's a different story.
Almost twice as many males and three
times as many females ;is would consider
"1 or more" persons an ideal dating situa
tion have insisted that "1 or more" is pre
cisely the choice that Ihe opposite sex would
make.
Despite a few gripes here and there, how
over, most students report being generally
satisfied with their dating life at Stanford.
A majority of all students would describe
their dating situations as "good" 1o "very
good." Females are especially strong on
"good" to "very good." Males congregate
most heavily along "good" to "satisfactory"
lines,
HOWEVER, one-quarter of the students
(males more than femalesi have indicated
the "unsatisfactory" or "unreasonable"
categories.
Perhaps it is especially significant that,
considering both sexes ARE dating, are
making dates when they want to and are
dating the right number of persons, replies
should run a full and remarkably balanced
range all Ihe way from "very good" to "un
reasonable."
It at least suggests one answer for the
chi onic griper:
Maybe, it's not the system afler all. .May
be it's you.
