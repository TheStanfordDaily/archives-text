Yes, they knew about I lira all right, but they wouldn't admit it or worship Hint

. . . So it was that when they gave God up and would not acknowledge Ilim. God
gave them np to doing everything their evil minds could think of. Their lives be
came full of every kind of wickedness and sin. of greed and hate. envy, lighting,
lying, bitterness, and gossip. They were backbiters, haters of Cod, insolent, proud
beggars, always thinking of new ways of sinning and continually disobedient to
parents. They tried to misunderstand, broke their promise-, and wire heartle-s
without pity. They were fully aware of Coil's death penalty for the.se crimes, yet
they went right ahead and did them anyway, and encouraged others to do them, too"
( Romans 1 :I.S-.)J I.iviinj Letters).
Do you find yourself included anywhere in this description of the human race?
If so. you can be restored to a proper relationship to God through a personal com

that the stinging and penetrating language ot Romans, Chaptei I.i- as relevant
to affluent Americans today a it i- applied to those who inhabit the underdeveloped
countries of the world:
"Cod shows Mis anger from heaven against till sinful, evil men who push away
the truth. For the truth about Cod i- known to them by instinct; Cod has put this
knowledge in their hearts. Since earliest times men have seen the earth and sky
and all that Cod has made, and have known of Hi- existence ami great eternal power.
So they have no excuse for saying they don't know whether <>r not there i- a God.
Yes, they knew about I lira all right, but they wouldn't admit it or worship Hint
or even thank Him for His daily care. And after a while they beean to think up
silly ideas of what God was like and what lie wanted them to do. The result was
that their foolish minds became dark and confused. Claiming themselves to be wise
without God, they became utter fools instead . . .
"And so God let them go ahead into every sort of sex sin. and do whatever they
wanted to do; yes vile and sinful things with each others bodies. Instead of believ
ing what they knew was the truth about God, they deliberately chose to believe lies
. . . So it was that when they gave God up and would not acknowledge Ilim. God
gave them np to doing everything their evil minds could think of. Their lives be
came full of every kind of wickedness and sin. of greed and hate. envy, lighting,
lying, bitterness, and gossip. They were backbiters, haters of Cod, insolent, proud
beggars, always thinking of new ways of sinning and continually disobedient to
parents. They tried to misunderstand, broke their promise-, and wire heartle-s
without pity. They were fully aware of Coil's death penalty for the.se crimes, yet
they went right ahead and did them anyway, and encouraged others to do them, too"
( Romans 1 :I.S-.)J I.iviinj Letters).
