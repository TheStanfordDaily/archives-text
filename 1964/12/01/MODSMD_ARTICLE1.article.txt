• Soviet Satellite Racing To Mars
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union launched a heavy earth satellite
yesterday and from it sent a rocket speeding toward Mars in a race
with the U.S. rocket Mariner 4.
Mariner 4 already is heading for a rendezvous with Mars.
Launched Saturday, the U.S. rocket is intended to pass within 7,600
miles of the planet in July, take pictures for 25 minutes and radio
them to the earth.
The official Soviet news agency Tass announced the launching
of the Soviet rocket.
The announcement said, "The last stage of the carrier rocket
placed the heavy artificial earth satellite on an intermediate orbit.
"A cosmic rocket then started on its course from the satellite,
accelerating the automatic station zone-2 for the speed necessary
to place it on the trajectory of movement toward the planet."
• Soviets Reject Thant Proposal
UNITED N ATIONS, N.Y. — The Soviet Union rejected yesterday
a plan by Secretary-General U Thant to head off a showdown on
U.N. financing.
And U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk apparently failed to alter
the Soviet stand at a 2'i-hour luncheon meeting with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.
Both termed the session, their first direct contact of the post-
Khrushchev era, "inconclusive." They will meet again in a few
days.
The prime topic was Russia's refusal to pay its U.N. dues for
peacekeeping operations. For that, the Soviets could lose their Gen
eral Assembly vote in the fall session opening Tuesday.
The Soviets issued a tough statement "categorically" opposing
the idea of putting off important General Assembly matters in order
to avoid a quick showdown on the deep financial-constitutional issue.
Thant proposed to the four big powers last week that they agree
to postpone all important, matters until after the first of the year
so that there would be no occasion to question the voting rights of
the Soviet Union.

with the U.S. rocket Mariner 4.
Mariner 4 already is heading for a rendezvous with Mars.
Launched Saturday, the U.S. rocket is intended to pass within 7,600
miles of the planet in July, take pictures for 25 minutes and radio
them to the earth.
The official Soviet news agency Tass announced the launching
of the Soviet rocket.
The announcement said, "The last stage of the carrier rocket
placed the heavy artificial earth satellite on an intermediate orbit.
"A cosmic rocket then started on its course from the satellite,
accelerating the automatic station zone-2 for the speed necessary
to place it on the trajectory of movement toward the planet."
• Soviets Reject Thant Proposal
UNITED N ATIONS, N.Y. — The Soviet Union rejected yesterday
a plan by Secretary-General U Thant to head off a showdown on
U.N. financing.
And U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk apparently failed to alter
the Soviet stand at a 2'i-hour luncheon meeting with Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.
Both termed the session, their first direct contact of the post-
Khrushchev era, "inconclusive." They will meet again in a few
days.
The prime topic was Russia's refusal to pay its U.N. dues for
peacekeeping operations. For that, the Soviets could lose their Gen
eral Assembly vote in the fall session opening Tuesday.
The Soviets issued a tough statement "categorically" opposing
the idea of putting off important General Assembly matters in order
to avoid a quick showdown on the deep financial-constitutional issue.
Thant proposed to the four big powers last week that they agree
to postpone all important, matters until after the first of the year
so that there would be no occasion to question the voting rights of
the Soviet Union.
