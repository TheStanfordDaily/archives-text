# PEDESTRIAN PRESERVE
## Farm Wheels On Way Out 
### JOHN BROADWIN 
According to Mr. Oscar Nelson,
a spokesman at the Planning
Office, the best way to move
people is on foot, like an army.
This idea is the keystone of a
program to transform Stanford
from a "driving campus" to a
"walking campus." The Master
Planner at Encina Hall stressed
that this University is primarily
an educational institution, and not
a vast parking lot.
The Quad, in time, is going to
become the module of a "pedes
trian preserve" approximately
one mile in diameter. This pre
serve, it is hoped, will be as hand
some and conducive to leisure as
White Plaza is at present.
THE PROCESS, begun in 1919
with the closing of part of Lasuen
Street to motor traffic, has been
progressing ever since at a stead
ily increasing pace. The Planning
Office said that in five years one
will see no more cars parked in
front of or even near, the front
of the Quad. And in ten years
the campus will be virtually de
void of any automobile traffic.

Plans call for the closing, in
the near future, of Lomita Drive
to any through traffic and Ihe
construction of an attractively
landscaped, unobstructed prom
enade.
Drivers, however, need no t
panic inordinately. Parking spaces
are to be built to absorb Stan
ford's mammoth automobile traf
fic. All hough at a somewhat
greater remove from campus
than the present lots, the tenta
tive parking facilities will be pro
vided with well-lighted, land
scaped walking approaches to the
University.
THE ARCHITECTURAL de
signs of the Planning Office call
for a unified campus. Mr. Nelson

Isa firm believer in the "organic
growth" of the University, that
is, in a systematically coordinated
effort to meet needs us they arise.
In contrast to such schools as
Yale and Harvard, which are
studded with daring but unrelated
structures that stand out like
isolated jewels, Stanford will
maintain its clean, simple build
ing style, linked by the familiar
red tile roofs.
Buildings under construction in
clude a now home for the business
school and a new mnt hematics
center. This winter construction
will begin on a biology complex
and an undergraduate library. In
addition, the law school may move
to a new building.

center. This winter construction
will begin on a biology complex
and an undergraduate library. In
addition, the law school may move
to a new building.
According to Mr. Oscar Nelson,
a spokesman at the Planning
Office, the best way to move
people is on foot, like an army.
This idea is the keystone of a
program to transform Stanford
from a "driving campus" to a
"walking campus." The Master
Planner at Encina Hall stressed
that this University is primarily
an educational institution, and not
a vast parking lot.
The Quad, in time, is going to
become the module of a "pedes
trian preserve" approximately
one mile in diameter. This pre
serve, it is hoped, will be as hand
some and conducive to leisure as
White Plaza is at present.
THE PROCESS, begun in 1919
with the closing of part of Lasuen
Street to motor traffic, has been
progressing ever since at a stead
ily increasing pace. The Planning
Office said that in five years one
will see no more cars parked in
front of or even near, the front
of the Quad. And in ten years
the campus will be virtually de
void of any automobile traffic.

Plans call for the closing, in
the near future, of Lomita Drive
to any through traffic and Ihe
construction of an attractively
landscaped, unobstructed prom
enade.
Drivers, however, need no t
panic inordinately. Parking spaces
are to be built to absorb Stan
ford's mammoth automobile traf
fic. All hough at a somewhat
greater remove from campus
than the present lots, the tenta
tive parking facilities will be pro
vided with well-lighted, land
scaped walking approaches to the
University.
THE ARCHITECTURAL de
signs of the Planning Office call
for a unified campus. Mr. Nelson

Isa firm believer in the "organic
growth" of the University, that
is, in a systematically coordinated
effort to meet needs us they arise.
In contrast to such schools as
Yale and Harvard, which are
studded with daring but unrelated
structures that stand out like
isolated jewels, Stanford will
maintain its clean, simple build
ing style, linked by the familiar
red tile roofs.
Buildings under construction in
clude a now home for the business
school and a new mnt hematics
center. This winter construction
will begin on a biology complex
and an undergraduate library. In
addition, the law school may move
to a new building.
