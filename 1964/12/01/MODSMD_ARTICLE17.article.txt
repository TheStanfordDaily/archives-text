## Grid Outlook For '65 Auspicious As Of Now 
### Joe Hernandez 
Staring at the backside of a mediocre 5-5 football season in which
four losses could have been four victories easier than pilfering a
piece of cake from your grandmother, prospects for a successful
year in 19(55 are bright.
From the first elevens on both offense and defense there will
be 16 players returning who played regularly.
The biggest loss to the team is linebacker Jack Chappie. The 6'3"
linebacker did an outstanding job all year and was named Lineman
of the Game on four different occasions. One of the swiftest men
on the squad, Chappie was in on 63 tackles.
The situation is anything but bleak, though. The "other" line
backer spot was held down by Bob Rath and Glenn Meyers,
both of whom will be back.
Other losses by graduation which will hurt are mostly on off
ense. Tackle Dick Leeumenburg, guard Joe Neal, center Carl
Schrader, and flanker J. D. Lodato have all used their three years
| eligibility. The defense besides the loss of Chappie will miss tackle
j Bob Nichols, safety Dick Ragsdale, and ends Bob Howard and Guy
Rounsaville. Stanford's kicker, Braden Beck, will also be gone.
This should not dim hopes too much, though, as there are experi
| enced replacements at almost every position. One spot where re
; placements are the last thing that is needed is quarterback. _
QUARTERBACK SITUATION TOO GOOD?
Leader of the pack is Dave Lewis. Dick Berg, Terry DeSylvia,
! and Don Cook are also available for action. Sophomore Lewis started
the season as a quarterback, switched to flankerbaek, and moved
I back to quarterback at the end of the year. As a flankerbaek Lewis
| caught 11 passes for 153 yards to place him in the number four spot
j among Indian pass catchers. Following his return to quarterback,
j Lewis started the last two contests and was named Back of the Game
in both of them. Perhaps the most heartening facet of Lewis' ability
is the fact that ho threw half as many interceptions as the other
passers. And also under his direction the Cards had fewer fumbles
in their last two games than they did in any other period in the last
j two years.
The only foreseeable problem is that Coach John Ralston will
! not be able to decide which of the four to play. With such an array
of experience, he may have the same problem the Los Angeles
Rams have had for the last six years. Ram coaches have switched
I from one signal caller to another almost weekly and as a result none
i of their quarterbacks have enough confidence to do anything but
the minimum required of them.
HANDLEY LEADS RUNNING PROSPECTS
i The running halfback spot with Ray Handley and Bob Blunt is
j almost as well off as the quarterback spot. Handley was one of the
i nation's top rushers and Blunt, a sophomore, did an excellent job
' of relievirlg Handley. It would be no surprise if both of them are
j starters next season. Speedster Blunt is a possibility for the flanker
j back spot vacated by Lodato and Lewis. Another sophomore, John
Read, took over the fullbacking chores midway through the season.
; The 210 pounder finished as the squad's second leading rusher.
John Mason and Mike Connelly should give Stanford four capable
1 hands. This last season the twosome were one-two in pass receiving.
I Mason caught 22 and Connelly, 17.
The interior line will have John Wilbur and Fergus Flanagan re
| turning at tackle and Larry Volmert and Bruce Kehrli, who shared
1 playing time, returning at guard. Red-shirt Jim Mills, 6'4", 220 lbs.,
| should be a big stride towards replacing Carl Schrader at center,
j Ron Miller and Jack Longinotti, who were also red-shirts, are ex
pected to bolster the tackle spots.
DEFENSE SET FOR ANOTHER GOOD EFFORT
The defensive platoon will have seven starters back. Gary Petti
grew, Tom Ross, Mike Hibler, A 1 Wilburn, Bob Rath, John Guil
lory, and Craig Ritchey form a solid nucleus around which to build.
Three players loom up as replacements for Nichols. Bill Ogle at
230 pounds played behind Nichols this year. Up from the Frosh team,
215 pounder Don Swartz and 253 pounder Blaine Nyo will both be
given a long look in spring practice.

j Ron Miller and Jack Longinotti, who were also red-shirts, are ex
pected to bolster the tackle spots.
DEFENSE SET FOR ANOTHER GOOD EFFORT
The defensive platoon will have seven starters back. Gary Petti
grew, Tom Ross, Mike Hibler, A 1 Wilburn, Bob Rath, John Guil
lory, and Craig Ritchey form a solid nucleus around which to build.
Three players loom up as replacements for Nichols. Bill Ogle at
230 pounds played behind Nichols this year. Up from the Frosh team,
215 pounder Don Swartz and 253 pounder Blaine Nyo will both be
given a long look in spring practice.
Staring at the backside of a mediocre 5-5 football season in which
four losses could have been four victories easier than pilfering a
piece of cake from your grandmother, prospects for a successful
year in 19(55 are bright.
From the first elevens on both offense and defense there will
be 16 players returning who played regularly.
The biggest loss to the team is linebacker Jack Chappie. The 6'3"
linebacker did an outstanding job all year and was named Lineman
of the Game on four different occasions. One of the swiftest men
on the squad, Chappie was in on 63 tackles.
The situation is anything but bleak, though. The "other" line
backer spot was held down by Bob Rath and Glenn Meyers,
both of whom will be back.
Other losses by graduation which will hurt are mostly on off
ense. Tackle Dick Leeumenburg, guard Joe Neal, center Carl
Schrader, and flanker J. D. Lodato have all used their three years
| eligibility. The defense besides the loss of Chappie will miss tackle
j Bob Nichols, safety Dick Ragsdale, and ends Bob Howard and Guy
Rounsaville. Stanford's kicker, Braden Beck, will also be gone.
This should not dim hopes too much, though, as there are experi
| enced replacements at almost every position. One spot where re
; placements are the last thing that is needed is quarterback. _
QUARTERBACK SITUATION TOO GOOD?
Leader of the pack is Dave Lewis. Dick Berg, Terry DeSylvia,
! and Don Cook are also available for action. Sophomore Lewis started
the season as a quarterback, switched to flankerbaek, and moved
I back to quarterback at the end of the year. As a flankerbaek Lewis
| caught 11 passes for 153 yards to place him in the number four spot
j among Indian pass catchers. Following his return to quarterback,
j Lewis started the last two contests and was named Back of the Game
in both of them. Perhaps the most heartening facet of Lewis' ability
is the fact that ho threw half as many interceptions as the other
passers. And also under his direction the Cards had fewer fumbles
in their last two games than they did in any other period in the last
j two years.
The only foreseeable problem is that Coach John Ralston will
! not be able to decide which of the four to play. With such an array
of experience, he may have the same problem the Los Angeles
Rams have had for the last six years. Ram coaches have switched
I from one signal caller to another almost weekly and as a result none
i of their quarterbacks have enough confidence to do anything but
the minimum required of them.
