# McBride Attends Meeting Of Student Governments
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
ASSU President Scott Mcßride returned late Sunday from
the Associated Student Governments initial conference at Nor
man, Oklahoma. Mcßride attended the three day conference of
the new student government organization as an observer for Stan
ford's Associated Students.

• He will report to the Legisla
ture on the conference at the
meeting Th u r s d ay night. The
Legislature had paid Mcßride's
expenses to the conference in
order to consider possible Stan
ford membership.
PRESIDENTIAL Assistant Pat
Forster said that he believed that
Mcßride's report would not be too
favorable to the new organization.
Forster said that he understood
that neither the quality of the
discussions nor the caliber of the
attending schools was equivalent
to the NSA convention held at
Minneapolis this summer.
ASGUSA has been for me d
mainly from schools that have
broken away from NSA, and Mc-
Bride indicated to LASSU before
he left, schools from the southern
part of the United States.
IT IS intended to bo a political
organization, avoiding the politi
cal stands that NSA occasionally
takes in its resolutions, and con
centrating on problems of student
government. This was its first
meeting.
NSA, to which Stanford now
belongs, has recently been criti
cized by some students on the
campus. Its relationship with
Stanford is currently being inves
tigated by a committee of Legisla
ture. Possible Stanford member
ship in the new organization will
probably be considered by that
committee.
