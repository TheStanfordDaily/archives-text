## 'Realist' Should Stay 
### 
Dear Sir:
Several weeks ago in my home
town the chief of police, who once
had removed books by Henry Mil
ler from the newsstands because
they were "objectionable," de
cided that certain words found
printed in the "Realist" magazine
were obscene, so he confiscated
all copies available for sale in the
city. Incredibly, the same sort of
thing has happened at Stanford.
Why? The official answer is
confusing. "Censorship wasn't the
issue at all," we are told. We
should not be able to obtain the
"Realist" because it is "offensive,
of poor quality, and not in de
mand." To whom is the "Realist"
offensive? Why, to "a visitor to
the campus from Illinois" and,
presumably, to President Ster
ling and some members of th e
Union Board. I do not want to
call anyone names, but in fact
the magazine is designed to be
offensive to bigots, conformists,
and hypocrites. Perhaps the maga
zine is of poor quality — after all,
"Adam" is printed on better
paper, has better photographic
reproduction, and doesn't use as
many "profane" words. If demand
was a factor in the Board's deci
sion, why not ban "The Burning
Bush," "The New Left Review,"
and other such unprofitable maga
zines?
It is true that the "Realist" fea
tures profane words and objec
tionable cartoons, but anyone Who
finds it "pornographic" has some
thing wrong with either his head
or his glands. Perhaps because the
"Realist's" cartoons have a little
more message than "Mad's" is
the reason they are objectionable,
especially to the aforementioned
bigots, conformists, and hypo
crites.
There are other, even more con
trived excuses for the magazine's
banishment. The "Realist," we
are told, appears "inconsistently."
What difference should that
make? We are also told that
space is needed for other maga
zines. May I suggest that instead
of removing a serious magazine
of social comment and criticism,
the Board shove over any of the
innumerable bland, "unobjection
able," and generally worthless
periodicals that only cater to the
public's apathy, pompous self
righteousness, and ignorance of
the wrongs and evils in society.

Dear Sir:
On last Wednesday three rather
warped letters appeared in the
Daily. We only wish we had
enough room to give these letters
the answers they deserve.
1. We can only feel sorry for
Mr. Name Withheld. Anybody

with such narrow ideas of the
Stanford Woman must either be a
freshman or a hermit.
2. We must also pity Mr. Me
servey and others like him who
don't seem to realize that Stan
ford Women just want to be
treated like human beings, with
a little respect. It's rather discon
certing to have a blind date
lunging for your hand after get
ting five steps away from the
dorm. If only Stanford men would
stop being so self-centered a n d
try to imagine how the girl feels
would they like to be treated
like a slot machine that is sup
posed to pay off after just so
much "special treatment" has
been put in? Stanford women
will show affection all right, but
only when they really mean it.
(Which is more than can be said
for certain members of tlie oppo
site sex!)
3. There seems to be a basic |
problem here — Stanford men arc j
always griping about the ratio
and yet why are there so many
girls who complain about the dif
ficulty of meeting Stanford men
and getting dates? And funniest |
thing, these girls aren't all dull, I
ugly creatures, half turkey and;
half IBM computer.
If only the men would take;
some initiative — how do you j
know that the girls in your
classes would refuse a date until i
you have asked? Or how about I
those hip: lecture classes where
seats are chosen on a "the oppo
site sex has the plague'' basis?
In short, you Stanford men who
think Stanford women so cold,
aloof, spoiled, cruel, abnormal,
etc. — have you really given us!
all a chance?

Dear Sir:
What started out as a simple,
humorous letter, not to be taken ;
seriously, has been picked up by i
several campus crusaders who j
took it literally. A rereading ofj
that letter would show that by I
no means was it directed at all
Stanford men. I could have re-1
plied directly to the exaggerated ;
charges, but the position in my j
first letter has been so distorted
out of reality that I don't wish to ;
be pushed into an endless argu-,
ment. Furthermore, ethics and!
standards are so varied on a col- j
lege campus that it is extremely j
difficult to generalize with any

• 'CENSORSHIP!' ?
Dear Sir:
Some weeks ago a Daily edi
torial berated the sensationalism
of the San Francisco Examiner in
proclaiming ASSASSINATION!
in a banner headline upon the re
lease of the Warren Commission
Report. But yesterday's attack
on CENSORSHIP! was no more
befitting of a respectable news
paper.
The Union Board's decision to
halt the sale of "The Realist" did
not merit comment in the news
paper at all, much less the great
fanfare and gnashing of teeth
over "censorship." The Board
President's remarks implied no
eagerness to prevent students
from reading "Realist." The deci
sion not to stock the magazine
was quite understandable with
out anyone inferring an inten
tion to censor.
It appears that the Daily has
assembled a paper tiger, and is
now prepared, editorials at the
ready, to move in for the kill.
Yesterday's editorial suggests
that the attempt to censor will
backfire: "It is predictable that
the student body, instead of con
tinuing to exhibit good judgment
and refusing to waste its money
on a magazine of very limited
merit, will flock to the stands,
and the 'objectionable' material
will enjoy a very wide circulation
indeed."
This only means that The Daily
has succeeded, through publicity,
in peddling trash which could
not sell by its own merits. It does
not mean that the "blasphemy
of censorship" has backfired since
the Union Board's intention never
was to keep the magazine out of
the hands of students.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The im
pression we received — from
the comments of the Board that
the comments of Tom Riles,
chairman of the Union Board
that the "Realist" was "objee
tionable," "pornographic," etc.,
and from the fact that its sus
pension was a response to a
letter of complaint — was that
the Tresidder Union Board was
indeed censoring the magazine.
We only wondered in the edi
torial why, it the Board's inten
tion was not to censor, it al
lowed moral considerations to
come into play? If it had not,
the action would not have been
newsworthy, and The Daily
never would have commented.
As for the headline "CEN
SORSHIP!," we must apologize.
It was a regrettably unsuccess
ful attempt to emphasize the ab
surdity of the entire situation.
It amazes ns that anyone can
get excited about the 'Realist'.

cided that certain words found
printed in the "Realist" magazine
were obscene, so he confiscated
all copies available for sale in the
city. Incredibly, the same sort of
thing has happened at Stanford.
Why? The official answer is
confusing. "Censorship wasn't the
issue at all," we are told. We
should not be able to obtain the
"Realist" because it is "offensive,
of poor quality, and not in de
mand." To whom is the "Realist"
offensive? Why, to "a visitor to
the campus from Illinois" and,
presumably, to President Ster
ling and some members of th e
Union Board. I do not want to
call anyone names, but in fact
the magazine is designed to be
offensive to bigots, conformists,
and hypocrites. Perhaps the maga
zine is of poor quality — after all,
"Adam" is printed on better
paper, has better photographic
reproduction, and doesn't use as
many "profane" words. If demand
was a factor in the Board's deci
sion, why not ban "The Burning
Bush," "The New Left Review,"
and other such unprofitable maga
zines?
It is true that the "Realist" fea
tures profane words and objec
tionable cartoons, but anyone Who
finds it "pornographic" has some
thing wrong with either his head
or his glands. Perhaps because the
"Realist's" cartoons have a little
more message than "Mad's" is
the reason they are objectionable,
especially to the aforementioned
bigots, conformists, and hypo
crites.
There are other, even more con
trived excuses for the magazine's
banishment. The "Realist," we
are told, appears "inconsistently."
What difference should that
make? We are also told that
space is needed for other maga
zines. May I suggest that instead
of removing a serious magazine
of social comment and criticism,
the Board shove over any of the
innumerable bland, "unobjection
able," and generally worthless
periodicals that only cater to the
public's apathy, pompous self
righteousness, and ignorance of
the wrongs and evils in society.

Dear Sir:
On last Wednesday three rather
warped letters appeared in the
Daily. We only wish we had
enough room to give these letters
the answers they deserve.
1. We can only feel sorry for
Mr. Name Withheld. Anybody

with such narrow ideas of the
Stanford Woman must either be a
freshman or a hermit.
2. We must also pity Mr. Me
servey and others like him who
don't seem to realize that Stan
ford Women just want to be
treated like human beings, with
a little respect. It's rather discon
certing to have a blind date
lunging for your hand after get
ting five steps away from the
dorm. If only Stanford men would
stop being so self-centered a n d
try to imagine how the girl feels
would they like to be treated
like a slot machine that is sup
posed to pay off after just so
much "special treatment" has
been put in? Stanford women
will show affection all right, but
only when they really mean it.
(Which is more than can be said
for certain members of tlie oppo
site sex!)
3. There seems to be a basic |
problem here — Stanford men arc j
always griping about the ratio
and yet why are there so many
girls who complain about the dif
ficulty of meeting Stanford men
and getting dates? And funniest |
thing, these girls aren't all dull, I
ugly creatures, half turkey and;
half IBM computer.
If only the men would take;
some initiative — how do you j
know that the girls in your
classes would refuse a date until i
you have asked? Or how about I
those hip: lecture classes where
seats are chosen on a "the oppo
site sex has the plague'' basis?
In short, you Stanford men who
think Stanford women so cold,
aloof, spoiled, cruel, abnormal,
etc. — have you really given us!
all a chance?

• 'CENSORSHIP!' ?
Dear Sir:
Some weeks ago a Daily edi
torial berated the sensationalism
of the San Francisco Examiner in
proclaiming ASSASSINATION!
in a banner headline upon the re
lease of the Warren Commission
Report. But yesterday's attack
on CENSORSHIP! was no more
befitting of a respectable news
paper.
The Union Board's decision to
halt the sale of "The Realist" did
not merit comment in the news
paper at all, much less the great
fanfare and gnashing of teeth
over "censorship." The Board
President's remarks implied no
eagerness to prevent students
from reading "Realist." The deci
sion not to stock the magazine
was quite understandable with
out anyone inferring an inten
tion to censor.
It appears that the Daily has
assembled a paper tiger, and is
now prepared, editorials at the
ready, to move in for the kill.
Yesterday's editorial suggests
that the attempt to censor will
backfire: "It is predictable that
the student body, instead of con
tinuing to exhibit good judgment
and refusing to waste its money
on a magazine of very limited
merit, will flock to the stands,
and the 'objectionable' material
will enjoy a very wide circulation
indeed."
This only means that The Daily
has succeeded, through publicity,
in peddling trash which could
not sell by its own merits. It does
not mean that the "blasphemy
of censorship" has backfired since
the Union Board's intention never
was to keep the magazine out of
the hands of students.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The im

the comments of the Board that
the comments of Tom Riles,

that the "Realist" was "objee

and from the fact that its sus
pension was a response to a
letter of complaint — was that
the Tresidder Union Board was
indeed censoring the magazine.
We only wondered in the edi
torial why, it the Board's inten
tion was not to censor, it al
lowed moral considerations to
come into play? If it had not,
the action would not have been
newsworthy, and The Daily
never would have commented.
As for the headline "CEN

It was a regrettably unsuccess

thing has happened at Stanford.
Why? The official answer is
confusing. "Censorship wasn't the
issue at all," we are told. We
should not be able to obtain the
"Realist" because it is "offensive,
of poor quality, and not in de
mand." To whom is the "Realist"
offensive? Why, to "a visitor to
the campus from Illinois" and,
presumably, to President Ster
ling and some members of th e
Union Board. I do not want to
call anyone names, but in fact
the magazine is designed to be
offensive to bigots, conformists,
and hypocrites. Perhaps the maga
zine is of poor quality — after all,
"Adam" is printed on better
paper, has better photographic
reproduction, and doesn't use as
many "profane" words. If demand
was a factor in the Board's deci
sion, why not ban "The Burning
Bush," "The New Left Review,"
and other such unprofitable maga
zines?
It is true that the "Realist" fea
tures profane words and objec
tionable cartoons, but anyone Who
finds it "pornographic" has some
thing wrong with either his head
or his glands. Perhaps because the
"Realist's" cartoons have a little
more message than "Mad's" is
the reason they are objectionable,
especially to the aforementioned
bigots, conformists, and hypo
crites.
There are other, even more con
trived excuses for the magazine's
banishment. The "Realist," we
are told, appears "inconsistently."
What difference should that
make? We are also told that
space is needed for other maga
zines. May I suggest that instead
of removing a serious magazine
of social comment and criticism,
the Board shove over any of the
innumerable bland, "unobjection
able," and generally worthless
periodicals that only cater to the
public's apathy, pompous self
righteousness, and ignorance of
the wrongs and evils in society.

Dear Sir:
On last Wednesday three rather
warped letters appeared in the
Daily. We only wish we had
enough room to give these letters
the answers they deserve.
1. We can only feel sorry for
Mr. Name Withheld. Anybody

with such narrow ideas of the
Stanford Woman must either be a
freshman or a hermit.
2. We must also pity Mr. Me
servey and others like him who
don't seem to realize that Stan
ford Women just want to be
treated like human beings, with
a little respect. It's rather discon
certing to have a blind date
lunging for your hand after get
ting five steps away from the
dorm. If only Stanford men would
stop being so self-centered a n d
try to imagine how the girl feels
would they like to be treated
like a slot machine that is sup
posed to pay off after just so
much "special treatment" has
been put in? Stanford women
will show affection all right, but
only when they really mean it.
(Which is more than can be said
for certain members of tlie oppo
site sex!)
3. There seems to be a basic |
problem here — Stanford men arc j
always griping about the ratio
and yet why are there so many
girls who complain about the dif
ficulty of meeting Stanford men
and getting dates? And funniest |
thing, these girls aren't all dull, I
ugly creatures, half turkey and;
half IBM computer.
If only the men would take;
some initiative — how do you j
know that the girls in your
classes would refuse a date until i
you have asked? Or how about I
those hip: lecture classes where
seats are chosen on a "the oppo
site sex has the plague'' basis?
In short, you Stanford men who
think Stanford women so cold,
aloof, spoiled, cruel, abnormal,
etc. — have you really given us!
all a chance?

• 'CENSORSHIP!' ?
Dear Sir:
Some weeks ago a Daily edi
torial berated the sensationalism
of the San Francisco Examiner in
proclaiming ASSASSINATION!
in a banner headline upon the re
lease of the Warren Commission
Report. But yesterday's attack
on CENSORSHIP! was no more
befitting of a respectable news
paper.
The Union Board's decision to
halt the sale of "The Realist" did
not merit comment in the news
paper at all, much less the great
fanfare and gnashing of teeth
over "censorship." The Board
President's remarks implied no
eagerness to prevent students
from reading "Realist." The deci
sion not to stock the magazine
was quite understandable with
out anyone inferring an inten
tion to censor.
It appears that the Daily has
assembled a paper tiger, and is
now prepared, editorials at the
ready, to move in for the kill.
Yesterday's editorial suggests
that the attempt to censor will
backfire: "It is predictable that
the student body, instead of con
tinuing to exhibit good judgment
and refusing to waste its money
on a magazine of very limited
merit, will flock to the stands,
and the 'objectionable' material
will enjoy a very wide circulation
indeed."
This only means that The Daily
has succeeded, through publicity,
in peddling trash which could
not sell by its own merits. It does
not mean that the "blasphemy
of censorship" has backfired since
the Union Board's intention never
was to keep the magazine out of
the hands of students.
MICHAEL COT ZENS
EDITOR'S NOTE: The im
pression we received — from
the comments of the Board that
the comments of Tom Riles,
chairman of the Union Board
that the "Realist" was "objee
tionable," "pornographic," etc.,
and from the fact that its sus
pension was a response to a
letter of complaint — was that
the Tresidder Union Board was
indeed censoring the magazine.
We only wondered in the edi
torial why, it the Board's inten
tion was not to censor, it al
lowed moral considerations to
come into play? If it had not,
the action would not have been
newsworthy, and The Daily
never would have commented.
As for the headline "CEN
SORSHIP!," we must apologize.
It was a regrettably unsuccess
ful attempt to emphasize the ab
surdity of the entire situation.
It amazes ns that anyone can
get excited about the 'Realist'.

"Realist" because it is "offensive,
of poor quality, and not in de
mand." To whom is the "Realist"
offensive? Why, to "a visitor to
the campus from Illinois" and,
presumably, to President Ster
ling and some members of th e
Union Board. I do not want to
call anyone names, but in fact
the magazine is designed to be
offensive to bigots, conformists,
and hypocrites. Perhaps the maga
zine is of poor quality — after all,
"Adam" is printed on better
paper, has better photographic
reproduction, and doesn't use as
many "profane" words. If demand
was a factor in the Board's deci
sion, why not ban "The Burning
Bush," "The New Left Review,"
and other such unprofitable maga
zines?
It is true that the "Realist" fea
tures profane words and objec
tionable cartoons, but anyone Who
finds it "pornographic" has some
thing wrong with either his head
or his glands. Perhaps because the
"Realist's" cartoons have a little
more message than "Mad's" is
the reason they are objectionable,
especially to the aforementioned
bigots, conformists, and hypo
crites.
There are other, even more con
trived excuses for the magazine's
banishment. The "Realist," we
are told, appears "inconsistently."
What difference should that
make? We are also told that
space is needed for other maga
zines. May I suggest that instead
of removing a serious magazine
of social comment and criticism,
the Board shove over any of the
innumerable bland, "unobjection
able," and generally worthless
periodicals that only cater to the
public's apathy, pompous self
righteousness, and ignorance of
the wrongs and evils in society.

Dear Sir:
On last Wednesday three rather
warped letters appeared in the
Daily. We only wish we had
enough room to give these letters
the answers they deserve.
1. We can only feel sorry for
Mr. Name Withheld. Anybody

with such narrow ideas of the
Stanford Woman must either be a
freshman or a hermit.
2. We must also pity Mr. Me
servey and others like him who
don't seem to realize that Stan
ford Women just want to be
treated like human beings, with
a little respect. It's rather discon
certing to have a blind date
lunging for your hand after get
ting five steps away from the
dorm. If only Stanford men would
stop being so self-centered a n d
try to imagine how the girl feels
would they like to be treated
like a slot machine that is sup
posed to pay off after just so
much "special treatment" has
been put in? Stanford women
will show affection all right, but
only when they really mean it.
(Which is more than can be said
for certain members of tlie oppo
site sex!)
3. There seems to be a basic |
problem here — Stanford men arc j
always griping about the ratio
and yet why are there so many
girls who complain about the dif
ficulty of meeting Stanford men
and getting dates? And funniest |
thing, these girls aren't all dull, I
ugly creatures, half turkey and;
half IBM computer.
If only the men would take;
some initiative — how do you j
know that the girls in your
classes would refuse a date until i
you have asked? Or how about I
those hip: lecture classes where
seats are chosen on a "the oppo
site sex has the plague'' basis?
In short, you Stanford men who
think Stanford women so cold,
aloof, spoiled, cruel, abnormal,
etc. — have you really given us!
all a chance?

Dear Sir:
What started out as a simple,
humorous letter, not to be taken ;
seriously, has been picked up by i
several campus crusaders who j
took it literally. A rereading ofj
that letter would show that by I
no means was it directed at all
Stanford men. I could have re-1
plied directly to the exaggerated ;
charges, but the position in my j
first letter has been so distorted
out of reality that I don't wish to ;

standards are so varied on a col- j
lege campus that it is extremely j
difficult to generalize with any
great accuracy. So I apologize to j

save anyone else the time of writ- j

• 'CENSORSHIP!' ?
Dear Sir:
Some weeks ago a Daily edi
torial berated the sensationalism
of the San Francisco Examiner in
proclaiming ASSASSINATION!
in a banner headline upon the re
lease of the Warren Commission
Report. But yesterday's attack
on CENSORSHIP! was no more
befitting of a respectable news
paper.
The Union Board's decision to
halt the sale of "The Realist" did
not merit comment in the news
paper at all, much less the great
fanfare and gnashing of teeth
over "censorship." The Board
President's remarks implied no
eagerness to prevent students
from reading "Realist." The deci
sion not to stock the magazine
was quite understandable with
out anyone inferring an inten
tion to censor.
It appears that the Daily has
assembled a paper tiger, and is
now prepared, editorials at the
ready, to move in for the kill.
Yesterday's editorial suggests
that the attempt to censor will
backfire: "It is predictable that
the student body, instead of con
tinuing to exhibit good judgment
and refusing to waste its money
on a magazine of very limited
merit, will flock to the stands,
and the 'objectionable' material
will enjoy a very wide circulation
indeed."
This only means that The Daily
has succeeded, through publicity,
in peddling trash which could
not sell by its own merits. It does
not mean that the "blasphemy
of censorship" has backfired since
the Union Board's intention never
was to keep the magazine out of
the hands of students.
MICHAEL COT ZENS
EDITOR'S NOTE: The im
pression we received — from
the comments of the Board that
the comments of Tom Riles,
chairman of the Union Board
that the "Realist" was "objee
tionable," "pornographic," etc.,
and from the fact that its sus
pension was a response to a
letter of complaint — was that
the Tresidder Union Board was
indeed censoring the magazine.
We only wondered in the edi
torial why, it the Board's inten
tion was not to censor, it al
lowed moral considerations to
come into play? If it had not,
the action would not have been
newsworthy, and The Daily
never would have commented.
As for the headline "CEN
SORSHIP!," we must apologize.
It was a regrettably unsuccess
ful attempt to emphasize the ab
surdity of the entire situation.
It amazes ns that anyone can
get excited about the 'Realist'.
Dear Sir:
Several weeks ago in my home
town the chief of police, who once
had removed books by Henry Mil
ler from the newsstands because
they were "objectionable," de
cided that certain words found
printed in the "Realist" magazine
were obscene, so he confiscated
all copies available for sale in the
city. Incredibly, the same sort of
thing has happened at Stanford.
Why? The official answer is
confusing. "Censorship wasn't the
issue at all," we are told. We
should not be able to obtain the
"Realist" because it is "offensive,
of poor quality, and not in de
mand." To whom is the "Realist"
offensive? Why, to "a visitor to
the campus from Illinois" and,
presumably, to President Ster
ling and some members of th e
