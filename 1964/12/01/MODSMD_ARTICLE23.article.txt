## New British Government Faces Two Big Problems 
### Walter Lippmann 
The appearance of the new government in Great Britain raised
questions which required an immediate response in Washington.
They have dealt with two matters of world-wide importance.
The first was the British monetary crisis which has been build
ing up for some months and would have had to be dealt with by

drastic measures, whichever
party won the election. The other
great matter has been what to
Ido about the nuclear problem
' within the NATO alliance. This,
! too, was building up toward a
| dangerous crisis.
In bolh matters tlie administra
; tion has acted promptly and, it
j seems to me, wisely in that it has
! put the need for order and stabil
| ity ahead of its preconceptions
i and its previous commitments.
Monetary Problem
The British have had monetary
troubles since the First World
War destroyed their great interna
tional creditor position. After the
Second World War the crises be
j came chronic. Britain lias not
i been able, except at intervals to
earn enough by her exports to
pay for her imports. The certain
consequence of this deficit in the
! British balance of payments
I would, if strong measures were
! nol taken, lie a flight from the
pound sterling and a drain on the
British gold reserves which would
result in a new round of cur
rency devaluation and world-wide
financial instability.
In previous crises of this sort,
the remedy used was to throttle
down demand at home by tight
ening bank credit and other de
flationary measures. The remedy
chosen by Harold Wilson is to
1 discourage imports by imposing
' a surcharge on imports and to
stimulate exports by tax incen
tives at home.
Only Temporary
i The Wilson remedy runs
! against the ideology of free trade.
; But it is meant to be temporary,
and if it works, the Wilson gov
j eminent will have the time to
I inaugurate the program for the
modernization of British industry,
which is the only lasting cure for
Britain's financial troubles. The
alternative, which would be to de
flate and bring about unemploy
ment and capital idleness, is in
the modern world as unsound eco
nomically as it. is politically
suicidal.
The Treasury and the State De
partment, which have been kept
fully informed from London,
have accepted the British meas
ures gracefully and cordially, as
is fitting in dealing with a tried
and trusted friend.
The other great matter on
which the administration has had
to take a decision arises out of the
complicated confusion about nu
clear weapons within the NATO
alliance. There is the great Amer
ican nuclear deterrent, which is
at least 90 per cent of all the
nuclear forces in the West. There
is General De Gaulle's small nu
clear force. There is Britain's
small nuclear force. And there is
the yearning of the West Ger
mans, so it is assumed in some
of the recesses of the State De
partment, for some contact with
the nuclear weapons which by

treaty they are solemnly forbid
den to possess.
State Dept. Scheme
And so. a number of thinkers
in the State Department dreamed
up a scheme known as MLF,
which stands for "multilateral
force." They sold the scheme
partly, but not wholly, to Presi
dent John Kennedy. When Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson took over,
he inherited the MLF as part of
the Kennedy program.
The only country in NATO
which has been willing to let it
self be seriously interested in ihe
scheme has been West Germany.
France will have none of it. Brit
ain has always been opposed,
though possibly a conservative
government might reluctantly
have been drawn into it. The Ita
lian government hates to say yes
and wishes it dared say no.
This misconceived and misbe
gotten scheme has been evaded
and avoided in Europe since it
was first put forward. But during
the past few months it has be
come disturbing both to relations
between and West and to the
solidarity of the NATO alliance
itself.
Overzealous Hopes
Its overzealous supporters al
the intermediate levels of the ad
ministration decided they could
secure the agreement of a reluc
tant Britain by winning the sup
port of the Germans, the Dutch
and possibly the Italians. Th e
British would then come in be
cause they would not like to be
left out in the cold. Some Ger
mans, most unwisely, were tempt
ed by the mirage of replacing
Britain as the closest ally of the
United Stales.
But when it appeared from
Bonn that within tlie NATO alli
ance there might be formed an
inner alliance between Germany
and the United States, the idea
had to be disavowed by Wash
ington. For a special German-
American alliance in nuclear
weapons would make a shambles
of NATO and chaos of Western
relations with Eastern Europe.
The advent of the Wilson gov
ernment has coincided with the
realization in the upper levels of
the administration that there was
nothing to be gained by pushing
and that pause for reflection
would be refreshing. The new
British foreign secretary, Gordon
Walker, came to Washington this
week, and he seems to have had
no difficulty in persuading the
administration to agree that the
working out of a satisfactory so
lution of the problems of nuclear
power and command is something
that requires time, and that there
is no emergency which requires
a crash solution.
Thus, the channels of commu
nication between London and
Washington are open, which is a
good augury for the days to come.

had to be disavowed by Wash
ington. For a special German-
American alliance in nuclear
weapons would make a shambles
of NATO and chaos of Western
relations with Eastern Europe.
The advent of the Wilson gov
ernment has coincided with the
realization in the upper levels of
the administration that there was
nothing to be gained by pushing
and that pause for reflection
would be refreshing. The new
British foreign secretary, Gordon
Walker, came to Washington this
week, and he seems to have had
no difficulty in persuading the
administration to agree that the
working out of a satisfactory so
lution of the problems of nuclear
power and command is something
that requires time, and that there
is no emergency which requires
a crash solution.
Thus, the channels of commu
nication between London and
Washington are open, which is a
good augury for the days to come.
The appearance of the new government in Great Britain raised
questions which required an immediate response in Washington.
They have dealt with two matters of world-wide importance.
The first was the British monetary crisis which has been build
ing up for some months and would have had to be dealt with by

drastic measures, whichever
party won the election. The other
great matter has been what to
Ido about the nuclear problem
' within the NATO alliance. This,
! too, was building up toward a
| dangerous crisis.
In bolh matters tlie administra
; tion has acted promptly and, it
j seems to me, wisely in that it has
! put the need for order and stabil
| ity ahead of its preconceptions
i and its previous commitments.
Monetary Problem
The British have had monetary
troubles since the First World
War destroyed their great interna
tional creditor position. After the
Second World War the crises be
j came chronic. Britain lias not
i been able, except at intervals to
earn enough by her exports to
pay for her imports. The certain
consequence of this deficit in the
! British balance of payments
I would, if strong measures were
! nol taken, lie a flight from the
pound sterling and a drain on the
British gold reserves which would
result in a new round of cur
rency devaluation and world-wide
financial instability.
In previous crises of this sort,
the remedy used was to throttle
down demand at home by tight
ening bank credit and other de
flationary measures. The remedy
chosen by Harold Wilson is to
1 discourage imports by imposing
' a surcharge on imports and to
stimulate exports by tax incen
tives at home.
Only Temporary
i The Wilson remedy runs
! against the ideology of free trade.
; But it is meant to be temporary,
and if it works, the Wilson gov
j eminent will have the time to
I inaugurate the program for the
modernization of British industry,
which is the only lasting cure for
Britain's financial troubles. The
alternative, which would be to de
flate and bring about unemploy
ment and capital idleness, is in
the modern world as unsound eco
nomically as it. is politically
suicidal.
The Treasury and the State De
partment, which have been kept
fully informed from London,
have accepted the British meas
ures gracefully and cordially, as
is fitting in dealing with a tried
and trusted friend.
The other great matter on
which the administration has had
to take a decision arises out of the
complicated confusion about nu
clear weapons within the NATO
alliance. There is the great Amer
ican nuclear deterrent, which is
at least 90 per cent of all the
nuclear forces in the West. There
is General De Gaulle's small nu
clear force. There is Britain's
small nuclear force. And there is
the yearning of the West Ger
mans, so it is assumed in some
of the recesses of the State De
partment, for some contact with
the nuclear weapons which by

treaty they are solemnly forbid
den to possess.
State Dept. Scheme
And so. a number of thinkers
in the State Department dreamed
up a scheme known as MLF,
which stands for "multilateral
force." They sold the scheme
partly, but not wholly, to Presi
dent John Kennedy. When Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson took over,
he inherited the MLF as part of
the Kennedy program.
The only country in NATO
which has been willing to let it
self be seriously interested in ihe
scheme has been West Germany.
France will have none of it. Brit
ain has always been opposed,
though possibly a conservative
government might reluctantly
have been drawn into it. The Ita
lian government hates to say yes
and wishes it dared say no.
This misconceived and misbe
gotten scheme has been evaded
and avoided in Europe since it
was first put forward. But during
the past few months it has be
come disturbing both to relations
between and West and to the
solidarity of the NATO alliance
itself.
Overzealous Hopes
Its overzealous supporters al
the intermediate levels of the ad
ministration decided they could
secure the agreement of a reluc
tant Britain by winning the sup
port of the Germans, the Dutch
and possibly the Italians. Th e
British would then come in be
cause they would not like to be
left out in the cold. Some Ger
mans, most unwisely, were tempt
ed by the mirage of replacing
Britain as the closest ally of the
United Stales.
But when it appeared from
Bonn that within tlie NATO alli
ance there might be formed an
inner alliance between Germany
and the United States, the idea
had to be disavowed by Wash

and avoided in Europe since it
was first put forward. But during
the past few months it has be
come disturbing both to relations
between and West and to the
solidarity of the NATO alliance
itself.
Overzealous Hopes
Its overzealous supporters al
the intermediate levels of the ad
ministration decided they could
secure the agreement of a reluc
tant Britain by winning the sup
port of the Germans, the Dutch
and possibly the Italians. Th e
British would then come in be
cause they would not like to be
left out in the cold. Some Ger
mans, most unwisely, were tempt
ed by the mirage of replacing
Britain as the closest ally of the
United Stales.
But when it appeared from
Bonn that within tlie NATO alli
ance there might be formed an
inner alliance between Germany
and the United States, the idea
had to be disavowed by Wash
ington. For a special German-
American alliance in nuclear
weapons would make a shambles
of NATO and chaos of Western
relations with Eastern Europe.
The advent of the Wilson gov
ernment has coincided with the
realization in the upper levels of
the administration that there was
nothing to be gained by pushing
and that pause for reflection
would be refreshing. The new
British foreign secretary, Gordon
Walker, came to Washington this
week, and he seems to have had
no difficulty in persuading the
administration to agree that the
working out of a satisfactory so
lution of the problems of nuclear
power and command is something
that requires time, and that there
is no emergency which requires
a crash solution.
Thus, the channels of commu
nication between London and
Washington are open, which is a
good augury for the days to come.
The appearance of the new government in Great Britain raised
questions which required an immediate response in Washington.
They have dealt with two matters of world-wide importance.
The first was the British monetary crisis which has been build
ing up for some months and would have had to be dealt with by

drastic measures, whichever
party won the election. The other
great matter has been what to
Ido about the nuclear problem
' within the NATO alliance. This,
! too, was building up toward a
| dangerous crisis.
In bolh matters tlie administra
; tion has acted promptly and, it
j seems to me, wisely in that it has
! put the need for order and stabil
| ity ahead of its preconceptions
i and its previous commitments.
Monetary Problem
The British have had monetary
troubles since the First World
War destroyed their great interna
tional creditor position. After the
Second World War the crises be
j came chronic. Britain lias not
i been able, except at intervals to
earn enough by her exports to
pay for her imports. The certain
consequence of this deficit in the
! British balance of payments
I would, if strong measures were
! nol taken, lie a flight from the
pound sterling and a drain on the
British gold reserves which would
result in a new round of cur
rency devaluation and world-wide
financial instability.
In previous crises of this sort,
the remedy used was to throttle
down demand at home by tight
ening bank credit and other de
flationary measures. The remedy
chosen by Harold Wilson is to
1 discourage imports by imposing
' a surcharge on imports and to
stimulate exports by tax incen
tives at home.
Only Temporary
i The Wilson remedy runs
! against the ideology of free trade.
; But it is meant to be temporary,
and if it works, the Wilson gov
j eminent will have the time to
I inaugurate the program for the
modernization of British industry,
which is the only lasting cure for
Britain's financial troubles. The
alternative, which would be to de
flate and bring about unemploy
ment and capital idleness, is in
the modern world as unsound eco
nomically as it. is politically
suicidal.
The Treasury and the State De
partment, which have been kept
fully informed from London,
have accepted the British meas
ures gracefully and cordially, as
is fitting in dealing with a tried
and trusted friend.
The other great matter on
which the administration has had
to take a decision arises out of the
complicated confusion about nu
clear weapons within the NATO
alliance. There is the great Amer
ican nuclear deterrent, which is
at least 90 per cent of all the
nuclear forces in the West. There
is General De Gaulle's small nu
clear force. There is Britain's
small nuclear force. And there is
the yearning of the West Ger
mans, so it is assumed in some
of the recesses of the State De
partment, for some contact with
the nuclear weapons which by

treaty they are solemnly forbid
den to possess.
State Dept. Scheme
And so. a number of thinkers
in the State Department dreamed
up a scheme known as MLF,
which stands for "multilateral
force." They sold the scheme
partly, but not wholly, to Presi
dent John Kennedy. When Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson took over,
he inherited the MLF as part of
the Kennedy program.
The only country in NATO
which has been willing to let it
self be seriously interested in ihe
scheme has been West Germany.
France will have none of it. Brit
ain has always been opposed,
though possibly a conservative
government might reluctantly
have been drawn into it. The Ita
lian government hates to say yes
and wishes it dared say no.
