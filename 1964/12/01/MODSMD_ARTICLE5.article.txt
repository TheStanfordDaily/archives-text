# Women Offer Views On Farm Men
## 
### SUSAN HEILMANN (Second in a Series) 
Given a chance to expound their views
on the Stanford dating situation, Stan
ford's females have proved veritable
fonts of response. Replying to a Daily
questionnaire on dating habits, they tell
of their likes and dislikes with gusto and
candor.
Keeping in mind that they have "good"
to "very good" dating situations, the ma
jority report that they usually go out
with persons they prefer to date.
THEY THINK that two is the ideal
number of dates per week (many said
one or three) and want those dates made
two to five days to one week in advance.
If given a choice, they'd be about
evenly divided between party and movie
theater dates.
Why do they date? For prestige, com
panionship. For something to do. To get
away from their studies. And many re
port what the males have known all
along: They're looking for a husband.
"BECAUSE I get lonely and bored,"
says one coed, "Dating's not much good
as a cure, but it does great things for
my ego." A frosh dates "to try new al

coholic drinks." Another less optimistic
frosh reports, "I like boys and I like do
ing things with them. It's about the only
thing to look forward to around here."
But perhaps an upperclass woman has
the final say. "Would you like to sit in
Faisan for three years doing nothing?"
Coeds report that really only studies
or, especially, the lack of offers, limit
their dating situations. However, some
knock the "dormitory phone arrange
ment" and a frosh dollie bemoans her
"lousy picture in the froshbook."
ONE exceptionally honest woman ad
mits she is limited by "a discrepancy be
tween what the opposite sex considers
the ideal date—i.e., good looking, spar
kling, vivacious—and me."
And what is the women's ideal image
of the perfect date? He's somebody to
talk to. intelligent, outgoing. He's a
very masculine fraternity type who's a
good dancer and poised. He's respectful,
considerate and a good conversational
ist. Frosh dollies want high moral stan
dards as well. But especially, he's PER
SONALITY.
Quotes from coeds' descriptions include
"ivy-league, attractive . . . good common
sense some don't have it, you know . . .

no lines. . ." And a frosh requests some
one who's "intense, demanding, intelli
gent and responsible—-CHALLENGING."
WOMEN PROVE receptive to com
plaints from acquaintances of the oppo
site sex, and would describe the dating
situation of the males as somewhere be
tween "satisfactory" and "unsatisfac
tory."
They think that the fellows agree with
them that two to three is the ideal num
ber of dates per week. Almost to the last
questionnaire, they report that men con
sider two to five days the ideal time per
iod in which to arrange a date.
According to the girls, almost three
quarters of the fellows they know like
party dates the best.
IN ANALYZING the kinds of girls
they think the fellows like to date, wom
en opt for small, pretty, fun girls who are
sparkly, intelligent. The ideal coed is a
looker, a dresser, a moderate drinker.
She has personality, too. She's sincere
and unaffected. Replies range all the
way from "At first, someone who will
impress their fraternity brothers, but
later, I think they start looking for more
meaningful relationships," though, "If I
could figure this out I'd never have any

problems," to a junior's "beautiful, sexy
and stupid — the average San Jose State
girl."
As for why the opposite sex dates,
women have a stock, one-word reply.
As one coed put it, "We all know, don't
we." Actually, they also believe that at
least some dating DOES go on for com
panionship and even wife-hunting.
BUT AT LEAST one sophomore is less
than happy about it all. "I have no idea,"
she replies, "DO they date?"
Coeds are also in tune with many fac
tors that may limit the fellows' dating
situation. The fellows, they report, lack
cars, money, contacts, fake I D.'s. They're
shy. They have to study. Some women
knock the ratio as myth, reporting that
males don't date because they "lack ima
gination .. . lack nerve .. . are defeatist
. . . or too fussy."
"Freshmen and sophomores may have
a shortage of dollies but juniors and sen
iors just have a shortage of nerve."
Some women, however, say different.
One coed can see that a number of fel
lows might be affected by the problem
that "six of them asked my roommate
out for Saturday night and then got dis
couraged."

quarters of the fellows they know like
party dates the best.
IN ANALYZING the kinds of girls
they think the fellows like to date, wom
en opt for small, pretty, fun girls who are
sparkly, intelligent. The ideal coed is a
looker, a dresser, a moderate drinker.
She has personality, too. She's sincere
and unaffected. Replies range all the
way from "At first, someone who will
impress their fraternity brothers, but
later, I think they start looking for more
meaningful relationships," though, "If I
could figure this out I'd never have any

problems," to a junior's "beautiful, sexy
and stupid — the average San Jose State
girl."
As for why the opposite sex dates,
women have a stock, one-word reply.
As one coed put it, "We all know, don't
we." Actually, they also believe that at
least some dating DOES go on for com
panionship and even wife-hunting.
BUT AT LEAST one sophomore is less
than happy about it all. "I have no idea,"
she replies, "DO they date?"
Coeds are also in tune with many fac
tors that may limit the fellows' dating
situation. The fellows, they report, lack
cars, money, contacts, fake I D.'s. They're
shy. They have to study. Some women
knock the ratio as myth, reporting that
males don't date because they "lack ima
gination .. . lack nerve .. . are defeatist
. . . or too fussy."
"Freshmen and sophomores may have
a shortage of dollies but juniors and sen
iors just have a shortage of nerve."
Some women, however, say different.
One coed can see that a number of fel
lows might be affected by the problem
that "six of them asked my roommate
out for Saturday night and then got dis
couraged."
Given a chance to expound their views
on the Stanford dating situation, Stan
ford's females have proved veritable
fonts of response. Replying to a Daily
questionnaire on dating habits, they tell
of their likes and dislikes with gusto and
candor.
Keeping in mind that they have "good"
to "very good" dating situations, the ma
jority report that they usually go out
with persons they prefer to date.
THEY THINK that two is the ideal
number of dates per week (many said
one or three) and want those dates made
two to five days to one week in advance.
If given a choice, they'd be about
evenly divided between party and movie
theater dates.
Why do they date? For prestige, com
panionship. For something to do. To get
away from their studies. And many re
port what the males have known all
along: They're looking for a husband.
"BECAUSE I get lonely and bored,"
says one coed, "Dating's not much good
as a cure, but it does great things for
my ego." A frosh dates "to try new al

coholic drinks." Another less optimistic
frosh reports, "I like boys and I like do
ing things with them. It's about the only
thing to look forward to around here."
But perhaps an upperclass woman has
the final say. "Would you like to sit in
Faisan for three years doing nothing?"
Coeds report that really only studies
or, especially, the lack of offers, limit
their dating situations. However, some
knock the "dormitory phone arrange
ment" and a frosh dollie bemoans her
"lousy picture in the froshbook."
ONE exceptionally honest woman ad
mits she is limited by "a discrepancy be
tween what the opposite sex considers
the ideal date—i.e., good looking, spar
kling, vivacious—and me."
And what is the women's ideal image
of the perfect date? He's somebody to
talk to. intelligent, outgoing. He's a
very masculine fraternity type who's a
good dancer and poised. He's respectful,
considerate and a good conversational
ist. Frosh dollies want high moral stan
dards as well. But especially, he's PER
SONALITY.
Quotes from coeds' descriptions include
"ivy-league, attractive . . . good common
sense some don't have it, you know . . .

no lines. . ." And a frosh requests some
one who's "intense, demanding, intelli
gent and responsible—-CHALLENGING."
WOMEN PROVE receptive to com
plaints from acquaintances of the oppo
site sex, and would describe the dating
situation of the males as somewhere be
tween "satisfactory" and "unsatisfac
tory."
They think that the fellows agree with
them that two to three is the ideal num

ing things with them. It's about the only
thing to look forward to around here."
But perhaps an upperclass woman has
the final say. "Would you like to sit in
Faisan for three years doing nothing?"
Coeds report that really only studies
or, especially, the lack of offers, limit
their dating situations. However, some
knock the "dormitory phone arrange
ment" and a frosh dollie bemoans her
"lousy picture in the froshbook."
ONE exceptionally honest woman ad

the ideal date—i.e., good looking, spar

And what is the women's ideal image
of the perfect date? He's somebody to
talk to. intelligent, outgoing. He's a
very masculine fraternity type who's a
good dancer and poised. He's respectful,
considerate and a good conversational
ist. Frosh dollies want high moral stan
dards as well. But especially, he's PER
SONALITY.
Quotes from coeds' descriptions include
"ivy-league, attractive . . . good common
sense some don't have it, you know . . .

no lines. . ." And a frosh requests some
one who's "intense, demanding, intelli

WOMEN PROVE receptive to com
plaints from acquaintances of the oppo
site sex, and would describe the dating
situation of the males as somewhere be
tween "satisfactory" and "unsatisfac
tory."
They think that the fellows agree with
them that two to three is the ideal num
ber of dates per week. Almost to the last
questionnaire, they report that men con
sider two to five days the ideal time per
iod in which to arrange a date.
According to the girls, almost three
quarters of the fellows they know like
party dates the best.
IN ANALYZING the kinds of girls
they think the fellows like to date, wom
en opt for small, pretty, fun girls who are
sparkly, intelligent. The ideal coed is a
looker, a dresser, a moderate drinker.
She has personality, too. She's sincere
and unaffected. Replies range all the
way from "At first, someone who will
impress their fraternity brothers, but
later, I think they start looking for more
meaningful relationships," though, "If I
could figure this out I'd never have any

problems," to a junior's "beautiful, sexy
and stupid — the average San Jose State
girl."
As for why the opposite sex dates,
women have a stock, one-word reply.
As one coed put it, "We all know, don't
we." Actually, they also believe that at
least some dating DOES go on for com
panionship and even wife-hunting.
BUT AT LEAST one sophomore is less
than happy about it all. "I have no idea,"
she replies, "DO they date?"
Coeds are also in tune with many fac
tors that may limit the fellows' dating
situation. The fellows, they report, lack
cars, money, contacts, fake I D.'s. They're
shy. They have to study. Some women
knock the ratio as myth, reporting that
males don't date because they "lack ima
gination .. . lack nerve .. . are defeatist
. . . or too fussy."
"Freshmen and sophomores may have
a shortage of dollies but juniors and sen
iors just have a shortage of nerve."
Some women, however, say different.
One coed can see that a number of fel
lows might be affected by the problem
that "six of them asked my roommate
out for Saturday night and then got dis
couraged."
Given a chance to expound their views
on the Stanford dating situation, Stan
ford's females have proved veritable
fonts of response. Replying to a Daily
questionnaire on dating habits, they tell
of their likes and dislikes with gusto and
candor.
Keeping in mind that they have "good"
to "very good" dating situations, the ma
jority report that they usually go out
with persons they prefer to date.
THEY THINK that two is the ideal
number of dates per week (many said
one or three) and want those dates made
two to five days to one week in advance.
If given a choice, they'd be about
evenly divided between party and movie
theater dates.
Why do they date? For prestige, com
panionship. For something to do. To get
away from their studies. And many re
port what the males have known all
along: They're looking for a husband.
"BECAUSE I get lonely and bored,"
says one coed, "Dating's not much good
as a cure, but it does great things for
my ego." A frosh dates "to try new al

coholic drinks." Another less optimistic
frosh reports, "I like boys and I like do
ing things with them. It's about the only
thing to look forward to around here."
