# Wert Orders Regulations' Investigation
## Student Affairs Committee To Act 
### 
Dean W ert has requested that
! the Committee on Student Af-1
I fairs and Services conduct a I
i study of undergraduate social |
[regulations. The Deans action is
j in response to recent controversy
I that has been raised over worn*
j en's social regulations.
Letters of dissent have been
flooding Tin* llaily's editorial page
recently, expressing general dis
satisfaction among Stanford wom
en over existing restrictions. Dur
ing the past few years, a barrage
of such letters has become a regu
i larly expected feature of the fall
j quarter editorial page.
; THIS YEAR, the letters have
| presented scve ra 1 carefully j
I weighed suggestions for possible
change.
One proposed innovation is a
j call for the establishment of un-j
| limited 2:3o's for freshmen. An- ;
| other suggestion is that off-cam-!
j pus housing for upper class
.'women be permitted.
Other proposals include thcj
abolishment of prescribed hours [
for sophomores, juniors, and I
seniors; coed housing; and a|
general establishment of total!
social equality between Stanford
! men and women.
THE POSSIBILITY of making
[significant changes seems to have
inspired much support among
(Stanford's fairer sex. One letter,
signed by "sixty-seven women of j
! Branner," has expressed agree-!
ment with the proposed un-j
I limited 2:30 plan.
Many upperclass women, more
i experienced in the complexity of j
IS tanl or d soc i a 1 life, have !
i expressed serious d o u b t s over !
| reducing so c i a 1 restrictions in â– 
campus houses.
The upperclass women do seem
,to advocate off-campus living for;
| juniors and seniors.
