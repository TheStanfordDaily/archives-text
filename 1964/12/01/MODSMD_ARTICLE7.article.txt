of a young prince who loved the!
glamorous b a 11 e r in a Leocadia.
But Leocadia, who ate orchids and |
kept, tame serpents, accidentally!
died by strangling herself only
three days after she met the
prince.
The prince's romantic and

I slightly mad aunt, has tried to
ease his melancholy by buying
| every building he went to with
; Leocadia and having them moved
j bodily to her estate. The prince
lias remained unchanged, how
' ever, and his aunt finally resorts
i to bringing a local milliner who
; resembles Leocadia to the estate

j love with her.
