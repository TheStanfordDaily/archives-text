# Savio Spreads UC Fight
## Musters Support At Santa Barbara 
### JON ROISE 
The fight for free speech is
spreading from the University
of : California to other college
campuses throughout the state.
Mario Savio, one of the lead
ers of (ho Free Speech Movemonl
at Berkeley, brought his cause to
the University of California at
Santa Barbara campus yesterday.
IN THE MEANWHILE, signs
of organized support for FSM are
beginning to appear on the cam
puses of U.C.L.A., U.C.S.D., River
side, and the Pomona Colleges.
The Santa Barbara rally, origi
nally scheduled to be held on the
U.C.S.B. campus in defiance of
university rules, was shifted to
approved Student Union grounds
after a faculty-student conference.
The rally was an outgrowth of
the formation at Santa Barbara
of the Students for Free Political
Activity, a group set up in re
sponse to, and along the same
lines as the FSM at Cal.
"WE'VE HAD scattered unoffi
cial support, such as in the form
of petitions, from the U.C.S.B.
campus for some time now," a
representative of FSM told The
Daily last night, "but this is the
first spontaneously organized
support from them, both for Cal
and for the free speech cause at
their own campus, that, we have
learned about."
A group similar to FSM is also
being organized on the U.C.L.A.
campus. One of its first moves
was to adopt a platform even
stronger than tho one being cham
pioned at Berkeley.
GROUPS AT the San Diego
campus, Riverside, Pomona, and
some other small private colleges
have also entertained speakers
from FSM.
In an interview at the Santa
Barbara campus, Savio told news
men that unless the charges
against him and fellow student
Arthur Goldberg are dropped al
together, the Berkeley campus
may face a strike by teacher's
assistants.
He said 1,000 of Berkeley's 1,300
T.A.'s have formed a union to
back up their demands.
