about the car: Oldsmobile's new 4-4-2. Earns its name from a 400-c.u.-in., 345-bhp V-8 . . .
4-barrel carb ... and twin pipes. Red-line tires, heavy-duty suspension, three transmission
availabilities liven up the package—no matter which F-85 V-8 coupe or convertible you
pick for your 4-4-2 action! But the real clincher Is price: prices start lover

I Vonda, by the way, is not included. But that's no problem for a tiger like you!
