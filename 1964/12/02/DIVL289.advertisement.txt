Absolute Justice
We all believe in fair play and hope to mi tlir right man win. but our human
courts and institutions always .-c-i-ni to have flaws and loopholes. Sometimes the
wrong mail is punished and the had guy is set free. I!ut in (iod's system of justice,
perfection is the by-word and corruption unknown. A proper perspective of the ab
solute justice of Clod and llis laws will show that no one can live up to such (law
less standards without the power of Jesus Christ. Thus it i*. vitally important to set
one's life straight with (iod by receiving the pardon and release from condemnation
which Jesus Christ offers and to live thereafter in dependence on llis resurrection
strength.
Rest assured. <iod never fails, truth and justice do prevail in the Imm run accord
ing to a liol) standard which measures all nun by comparing them to Jesus Christ.'
In the Second Chapter of Romans we read:
"Do you think that (iod will judge and condemn others (for sinful deeds) and
overlook you when you do them, too? Don't you realize how patient lie is being with
you? < >r don't you care? Can't you sec that He has been waiting all this time with
out punishing you to give you time to turn from your sin? llis kindness is meant
to lead you to repentance. I tut no. you won't listen; and so you are saving up terrible
punishment for yotu'st Ives becaust of your stubljorn hardness t heart. 1<• r there is
going to conic a day of wrath when (iod will be the honest judge of all. He will
give eternal life to those who patiently do the will of (iod, seeking for glory and
honor and sternal life. Hut lie will terribly punish those who fiuht against the truth
and walk in evil ways, for (iod's auger will be poured "tit upon them, dure will be
sorrow and suffering for Jews and (ientiles alike who keep on sinnin.:. Hut there
I will be glory and honor and peace from God for all who obey Him. whether they
I are Jews or (ientiles. for God treats everyone tin same, lie will punish sin, wherever
jit is found. He will punish the heathen when they sin even though they never had
(iod's written laws, for down in their heart the> knew tlicy were wrong. God's laws
are written within them; their own conscience accuses them, or sometimes excuses
them. And God will punish the Jews for sinning because they liavi llis written laws
but don't obey them. They know what is riuht but don't do it. .\ftcr all, salvation
is not given to those who know what to do unless they do it.
" The.day will surely conic when at God's command Jt *us Christ will judge
the secret lives of everyone, their inmost thoughts and motives; thi- is all part of
God's great plan which I have already told you about ..." (Roman* /.iY/io/
Letters).
How does your life compared to the lift lived by Jesus Christ: Are you prepared
to face a Holy Judgi such as lit ? What will you say to tin spotless l.amb of God
who ottered Himself as a initio tm (iod's altar of justict toi > onMl those who
seek His forgiveness and pardon ol sin rcceivt what they ask for. \\ li\ should you
I lie left out? As His itistiei i- absolute, so also is the forgivene-s and pardon so
I graciously offend to all today. Meet Jesus Christ, "in whom wi li.i\• redemption
