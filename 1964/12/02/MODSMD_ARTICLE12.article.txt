# Critic Discusses Imitation By English Romantic Poets
## 
### BARBARA JAVERY 
"The I'olo of imitation in the
poetry of the English Romantics
was an enormous one," accord
ing to George Watson, distin
guished literary critic and resi
dent lecturer in English ;it Cam
bridge University.
In his address, "The English
Romantic: Parody and Imitation"
delivered last night in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium, Watson con
sidered the extent of the role
played by imitation in the work
of the Romantic poets, and con
cluded that "although the Ro
mantics attempted to deceive
themselves into thinking that they
were vital barbarians bravely
smashing literary conventions,
they were extremely dependent on
the imitation of their predeces
sor's especially the Greeks and
Romans in ilie writing of their
own works."
DISCUSSING THE role of imi
tation in the works of specific
Romantic poets, Watson noted
that most of the poets were self
conscious imilators. "The most
original poet is a borrower, even

today, simply because all poets
| use language. The Romantic,
however, tended 1Â»> be more imi
tative because lie felt that imita
| tion was the only route to take.
1 The problem facing the English
; poet who sought to write well was
! the selection of a good model to
i imitate, and not the self-con
j scious development of a personal
I style."
