# Males Give Their Version Of Social Life

### SUSAN HEILMANN (Third in a Series) 
The males also have proved quite voeal in their
analysis of the Stanford dating situation. They are
somewhat divided about their likes and dislikes,
but can describe the dollies in juicy prose. While
not nearly so generous as the coeds' replies, their's
more than make up in being right to the point.
Whereas the fellows' dating situations may be
only "good" to "satisfactory," they report that a
majority of males ALWAYS date persons they pre
fer to date. (Females have said "usually.")
TWO IS STILL the ideal number of dates per
week—maybe also three. Over half of the men
vote for party dates, and perhaps a quarter go for
movie-theater dates.
They think that almost three quarters of the
women prefer party dates also.
Why do MEN date? The girls were right.
OF COURSE, some are also looking for the
: ideal girl. As they get older, "companionship" is
i what many males seek.

As for what limits the male dating situation,
men blame lack of care, time or money. Mostly
they blame first the ratio and then their studies.
"Sometimes 1 study and I like to drink," was one
fellow's excuse for not dating more. Another re
plied, "No car, no money, no love of brilliant Stan
lord girls."
In any case, many of the fellows offer limita
tions but emphasize that they voluntarily CHOOSE
to do other things instead of dating.
What do fellows look for in the ideal dollie?
Almost every poll says the same thing - LOOKS.
However, a woman has to be more than a looker.
Whereas frosh tend to concentrate almost entirely
on appearance, upperclass men also consider per
sonality. Conversationalist, cheerful, outgoing,
good mixers, are all mentioned frequently.
FEIXOYVS KNOCK sophistication. They want
;j sincere girl with whom they can feel comfort
able. She has to be free thinking, must have a good
reputation, can't be a prude. Oh, and something
else. The right kind of girl knows how to make
herself "dependent."
With tongue in cheek, males describe ideal
dates as "cute, sexy, wild," and "friendly, easy
going, pretty, immoral." And one male pretty well

summed it up with "She should be able to talk
warmly, honestly and intelligently, but also should
know when not to talk."
Males show themselves especially eager to tell
what they think that the females think.
ACCORDING to the men, the women's dating
situation could be described as "good" to "satisfac
tory." However, more fall into the "satisfactory"
than "good" category.
Although they make their dates in two to five
days, the men feel that the women would really
like them to call a week or more than a week in
advance.
Like the women, men think that the opposite
sex likes party dates best.
MEN FEEL they're attuned to the type of male
that attracts the girls. They call him a "glamorous
faker." He's handsome, athletic and rich. He has
sex appeal, he's a dresser. He has manners. He's
suave and intelligent. He's popular. And, most of
all, he's an absolute master of the fine art of snow
job.
Men can also tell just why it is that the females
like to date. First of all the girls are husband
hunting. Secondly, they strive for the prestige

that they feel dating brings. Dating merely to have
a good time runs a poor third.
One males describes the female interest in dat
ing as "old maid panic."
A FROSH reports that "social position among
girls hinges on dating." And an embittered junior
has decided that girls date "to increase their social
prestige, have a good time, and laugh inwardly at
the gutless boobs fawning on them."
Men singularly reject the idea that the female
dating situation could be limited by any significant
factors. They agree that reputation, first impres
sions and selfishness could prove handicaps. They
also mention social regulations — something that
not one female polled considered a limitation.
But the males do not consider studies a limita
tion on female dating. To them, women are limited
by looks or the fact that they're already booked up.
As one fellow flatly declared, the women are
limited by "absolutely nothing. Any girl at Stan
ford can go out all she wants to unless she hides
in her closet all day."
A frosh mentioned "the ability to make a first
impression" and one male chuckled, "They have to
wait for me to ask them out which I never do."
