# Lane Refutes Warren Report
## 
### 
Mr. Mark Lane, a New York
attorney, gave his critique of the
Warren Report at Dinklespiel Au
ditorium yesterday afternoon.
Lane charged that the Warren
Committee dealt "frequently in
speculation and conjecture." He
further stated that their report
was a "fraudulent document from
the front page to the last page."
Lane stated his position that
Lee Harvey Oswald could not
have been President Kennedy's
assassin. He claimed that the FBI
presupposed Oswald's guilt, and
then tried to build their case
around their conclusion.
The speaker stated several in
stances where the Warren Com
mission drew conclusions" totally
unsupported by the evidence." He
claimed that the FBI intention
ally withheld from the public evi
| dence concerning the nature of
I the President's wounds, and wit
j nesses' accounts of the shooting,
i Lane also stated that tape re
! cordings that he sent to the FBI
| have not been acknowledged by
I the agency, and have been de
j liberately kept secret.
