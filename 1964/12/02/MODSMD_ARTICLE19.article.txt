## 
### 
History tells us how Garibaldi's
Raiders tried to take over Italy
in the middle of the nineteenth
century. They failed, and so did
Coaeh Garibaldi's Raiders from
Santa Clara in their attempt to
beat Stanford in basketball, as
they fell to the Indians (!9-t>o lfist
night.
Actually, the game lacked the
spirit and excitement of a revo
lution, and took on the propor
tions of a street fight.
The first half was mostly a
court game, Stanford scoring

only 31 points and Santa Clara
only 25.
THIO BRONCOS jumped off to
the early lead, as center Bruce
Asch sunk a .jumper from the
top of the key with nearly two
minutes gone. But the lead was
short lived; the Indians quickly
took the edge 5-2.
The Indians missed a flurry of
shots and three quick Santa
; Clara goals put the Broncos ahead
! 8-7. And that was it for Santa
Clara. The rest of the half found
i Stanford fending off the pesky

Broncos while maintaining pos
session of the lead.
STANFORI> increased the de
ficit 1o five with a 13-8 score, and
kept the lead for the next seven
minutes. Craig Cordes and Clay
ton Raaka kept control of the
boards for the Tribe with Bedell
and Preisler providing the offen
sive punch.
With six minutes left, Santa
Clara's Mike Dooling picked up a
loose ball under his own basket
and dumped it in to knot the con
test again at 20-20. But the Bron
cos were cold and couldn't muster
the punch to go ahead and t he
Indians coasted to a 31-25 half
time lead.
Till: SECOND HALF was
much the same story score-wise
as the first, but the melee turned
into a basketball game. Both
teams displayed some fine ball
handling and much more accurate
shooting than in the first half. In
dians Raaka and Hinckley both
popped in 14 points /ind Broncos
John Turner and Mike Gervasoni
chalked 13 and 12, respectively.
Santa Clara tallied first with
two quick field goals, cutting
Stanford's lead to two, 31-29. But
the go-ahead scores were no t

forthcoming and a Card press,
and a quick sharp offense, put
Stanford ahead by nine, 42-33.
The game settled down into a
shot for shot contest. But the
dribbling and shooting antics of
Santa Clara guard Gervaso.a
could not counteract the Red of
fensive led by Raaka and Hinck
ley. Stanford maintained its lead
to the end for a 69-60 victory.

spirit and excitement of a revo

The first half was mostly a
court game, Stanford scoring

only 31 points and Santa Clara
only 25.
THIO BRONCOS jumped off to
the early lead, as center Bruce

top of the key with nearly two
minutes gone. But the lead was
short lived; the Indians quickly
took the edge 5-2.
The Indians missed a flurry of
shots and three quick Santa

Clara. The rest of the half found
i Stanford fending off the pesky

Broncos while maintaining pos
session of the lead.

kept the lead for the next seven
minutes. Craig Cordes and Clay

boards for the Tribe with Bedell
and Preisler providing the offen
sive punch.
With six minutes left, Santa
Clara's Mike Dooling picked up a
loose ball under his own basket
and dumped it in to knot the con
test again at 20-20. But the Bron

the punch to go ahead and t he
