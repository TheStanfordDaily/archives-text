# Cross Country Racers Lead Card Fall Sports

### JOHN MERRILL 
CROSS COUNTRY
The Stanford Cross country
team had the most successful
record of all Stanford fall sports
teams this year. The cross coun
try men ended the season unde
feated in both dual and triangu
lar meets.
The season included victories
over all California competition.
USC and UCLA were each defeat
ed twice in triangular meets. The
season was ended wit h an easy
17-42 win over California in the
| "Big Meet," In this meet the In
j dians took all three first places
as Paul Schlicke led with a new
I Berkeley course record of 18:54.
! Weym Kirk land was second and
! Harry MeCalla placed third.
Besides the undefeated season
record, the Indians had one vic
tory of particular note. In a mid
season meet the Cards faced last
year's national champion. San
Jose State. San Jose had another
! fine team this year, but the In
dians nosed out the Spartans
j with a tremendous last second
finish. The meet ended 27-28 with
j Stanford winning what was per
haps the most important duel of
the year.
Two weeks ago, Indian harrier
Harry MeCalla placed twelfth in
the NCAA cross-country run.
! That race was run over a snowy

course at East Lansing, Michigan.
MeCalla led the Stanford squad
all year. However, much ol' the
time Stanford had at least three
men in the top finishers. In the
USC-California triangular meet
Stanford took the first six places
and won 15-43-69.
There was also success at the
Freshman level. The young In
dians were undefeated in Fresh
man competition and one of Ihe
Frosh, Alex Whittle, finished
third in the USC-California meet.
SOCCER
Stanford's varsity soccer team
culminated its season with a very
misleading 9-3-1 record. Behind
the excellent play of such line
men as Klas Bergman, Kammel
Kadi, and Stu Rawlings the Red
hooters were often able to mount
up large scores.
But against stiff opposition,
San Jose, California, the Indians
were not able to muster one vic
tory. The soccer team had an
undefeated, untied slate against
all other foes.
Kammel Kadi, John Cox, and
Klas Bergman were named to the
all-conference First Team. Tito
Bianchi and Stu Rawlings re
ceived Second Team rating.
Yet the Indians did achieve
some success. No non-league
opponent was able to even tie
Stanford. The Indians upset

strong USI 0 twice. And they fin
ished 9-3-1. for second place in
the Northern California Soccer
League. If a couple of those losses
could have been somewhere out
of the league, the Indians may
have gone to the NCAA finals.
WATER POLO
Stanford's varsity water polo
team finished one game short
of a .500 season, compiling a 9-10
record.
The Tribe poloist dunked Cal
three times and split with both
USC and UCLA. Stanford went
1-2 against San Jose Slate and
0-2 against the San Francisco
Olympic Club. Foothill squeezed
three games out of the Indians
and Long Beach State took one
game from the Cards.
Several high points marked
the season. The Olympic runner
up Yugoslav team put on a fast
moving exhibition of truly great
water polo. They swam past the
Indians 13-2.
Bill Ready, team captain, and
Brian Beck led the scoring de
partment. Jim Ellis put in con
sistently fine performances in
front of Ihe Stanford net. Other
standouts on the varsity squad
were Mike Eshelman, Tom Chal
berg, Jeff Beck, and Bill Derrig.
The Papooses marched to a
14-2 record for one of the finest
seasons ever for a Stanford fresh
man team. The only two losses
came at the hands of Cal, a team
ihe Stanford frosh had beaten
early in the season.
Freshman standouts Gary
Sheerer, Pete Ready, Bill Meyer,
Mark Parmely, Terry Edeli, Walt
Poterbin and Doug Mac Lean led
the Papooses through the season.
The year was culminated in sec
ond place finish in the Nor-Cal
Closed Tournament last week.
