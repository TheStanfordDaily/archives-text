### BOB THIERIOT 
Santa Clara's freshmen basket
ball team overwhelmed the Stan
ford frosh 78-54, on a second half
splurge led by guard Bob Spenee.
Employing a devastating fast
break, Santa Clara was also able
to penetrate the Stanford defense
and score numerous short shots.
Bob Spenee, though playing on
the outside broke for the basket
often. He was the scoring leader
with 22 points.
Stanford was held outside, and
the Broncos forced the Red Men
to shoot from far and away. Art
Harris combined great dribbling
and flashy passing to set up the
Jew close shots which the Pa
pooses were able to get.
STANFORD and Santa Clara
traded the lead throughout the
first half. At the half the score
was 38-34, Santa Clara. But from
the beginning of the second half
the Broncos took command.
Santa Clara had not taken ad
vantage of the many Stanford
fouls in the first half. But in the
second half they took advantage
of everything. Stanford gained a
45-45 tie at 14:48. but Santa Clara
rattled off 7 straight points to
go ahead for good. From that spot
on Stanford was otuscored 33-9.
The Papooses did not help their
own cause as they lost the ball

1 on foolish shots and wild passes.
The Bronco last break destroyed
the little Indians. Joe Diffley
constantly sneaked behind th e
Stanford hoopsters and raced in
to score.
AT THK SEVEN minute mark
the Papooses edged closer by
outscoring their opponents 7-2 in
a brief streak. But from the 5:20
mark Stanford did not score
again. Santa Clara dumped in
fifteen points until the buzzer
ended the rout.
Backing Spenee were Chris
Dempsey 15, Ron Lane 15, and
i Bob Heaney 13. Art Harris led
the Cards with 17, mostly on
i tip-ins and short jumpers. Gary
| Petersmeyer popped in 11 on
long bombs from the outside.
| Herb Hargate racked up 10, Pat
! Canfield 9.
! In the J.V. game Skip Hutchi
i son led the Indians to a victory
| in a 65-64 "squeaker." Although
| the Indians led throughout Santa
' Clara crept closer and closer.
Only the final buzzer halted their
comeback hopes. Hutchison's 18
points had given the Indians
j enough insurance to hold off the
j Broncos.
The Frosh will try to improve
I their status Thursday evening at
San Jose. To do well they must
get inside the Spartans defense.
