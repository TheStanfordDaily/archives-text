## Women's Council Asks Sign-In Time Of 9 A.M. 
### 
Dear Sir:
We, the members of Women's
Council, would like to co-operate
with the Social Regulations Com
mittee by proposing a change in
the present system. We have
drawn on our technical knowl
edge in formulating this propos
al; and we hope that students
will suggest modifications in light
of their own experience.
Wo agree with Tina Dungan
that a woman should use her own
discretion in choosing her com
panion and her destination. We
agree that falsification of the
university records should remain
grounds for disciplinary action;
but we suggest that the judicial
councils cease to consider a wom
an's "irresponsibility," because
the word admits of endless in
terpretation. When we emphasize
a woman's honesty under the sys
tem, we permit the Fundamental
Standard to retain a measure of
its force, dissipated now by the
number and the triviality of the
rules. At the same time, we en
courage the sense of responsibil
ity that the Standard implicitly
enjoins. A woman may now ne
glect to make her own decisions,
because the system will make de
cisions for her. We think that
whatever else morality is. it is
a matter of choice. A woman can
not act "morally" until she is
free to act otherwise.
That we may encourage a sense
of responsibility, we propose a
sign-in time of 9:00 a.m. All girls
may let themselves in with keys,
just as girls in Moore and on the
Row do now. The university can
begin to look for a girl if she
does not sign in by 9:00 a.m., and
ii can account for her absence
during fire drills. We think that
any rules, besides these provi
sions for safety, may delay a
woman's maturity by denying
her ihe opportunity for choice.

• Manhood Questioned
I>«■:»r Stanford Men:
Perhaps you, as much as we.
are tiling of these endless at
tempts to generalize on the de
gree of lovable femininity pres
ent in the Stanford woman. If.
however, you find such discussion
an important part fo your "col

lege experience, may we sug
gest approaching this fascinating
debate on sex from a slightly dif
ferent perspective? Surely the
Stanford community could reach
just as many significant conclu
sions, and perhaps get a few more
chuckles, from a little healthy
controversy regarding the ques
tionable masculinity of your lov
able selves. Need we say mor2?

• Union Hoard Clarifies
Position On 'Realist"
Dear Sir:
Because of t He controversy con
cerning The Realist, the Union
Board would like to clarify its
position. The Union Board is a
policy-making body whose func
tion includes making value judg
ments concerning all Union mat
ters, including films, speakers,
art, and the quality of food and
service. Although we do not en
dorse everything sold in the
Union Store, we assume respon
sibility for any periodical brought
to our attention.
There were a number of rea
sons for discontinuing sale of The
Realist. When it was first
brought to our attention, we ex
amined many aspects of Ihe ques
tion. In the first place, there
were only five lo fifteen copies
sold per month. Other magazines
which sell so few copies are car
ried only because they serve an
educational function, as for ex
ample, the foreign magazines.
The publication was, in the
Board's opinion, of consistently
poor quality and the issue of
"pornography" was never raised.
Discontinuing sale does no t
imply "censorship" as stated in
the Daily editorial. We do not
intend to dictate what is objec
tionable and what is acceptable
for the Stanford community to
read. If anyone wishes lo read
The Realist it is available at
many stores in the area, includ
ing Kepler's, or by subscription.
What we do intend is to maintain
some standard of quality in this
matter as in all Union matters.
Upon examining The Realist we
found it to fall below reasonable
standards, and since there was
so little interest in ihe magazine
we decided to discontinue sale.

'Drench Ratio*
Dear Sir:
I would like to add another
term to the quickly expanding list
used to describe Stanford life.
"Drench-ratio" is defined as the
relative percentage of students
who must sit in class, soaked to
the skin because they had to walk
one quarter of a mile along "well
lighted, landscaped walking ap
proaches" to campus, through a
downpour driven by a thirty mile
per hour wind.
Along with the new plans to
double thc> lengths of such ap
proaches, I should expect a sig
nificant increase in the "drench
ratio" and possibly a higher
budget for the Health Service. I
hope that Mr. Nelson will have
the Health Service budget in
creased.

• UFO Report
Dear Sir:
The National Investigations
Committee on Aerial Phenomena
(NICAP), Headquarters, 1536
Connecticut Avenue, N.W.. Wash
ington 36, D.C., has just recently
published its long awaited "The
UFO Evidence" Report. This il
lustrated, fully documented 18-1-
page Report, containing over 200,-
000 words, is the result of
NICAP's seven-year investigation
of Unidentified Flying Objects
(UFO) and proves, beyond any
reasonable doubt, that UFOs are
unknown superior machines un
der intelligent control, emanat
ing from an extraterrestrial
source, and official secrecy on
same.
It is hoped that this Report, a
copy of which has been presented
to every member of Congress, will
instigate open Congressional
hearings on UFOs to end the un
warranted United States Air
Force policy of secrecy and cen
sorship on same.
