# STANFORD HOUSING EXAMINED
## Why Are Dorm Fees High? 
### MICHAEL COHEN JEFF DIEFENDORF 
A university, so one is often
told, should teach its students to
ask questions. One question that
almost every Stanford undergrad
uate learns to ask is "Why does
it cost so much to live on cam
pus?"
It lias become generally accept
ed that men can live off campus
for less money than they must
presently spend to live in on
campus housing.
FOR AN AMOUNT equivalent
to on campus room and board,
one can live in luxury not pos
sible in oncampus facilities.
Many students are now living off
campus, where $1020 yearly will
rent them an apartment complete
with swimming pool, wall to wall
carpeting, built-in kitchens and
airline hostesses for neighbors.
These facts drive many Stanford

students to wonder why less luxu
rious on-campus living costs as
much.
Investigating. The Daily found
that the room and board costs
at Stanford are very high in com
parison with other large schools.
Indeed, there are only a few ma
jor institutions (Harvard aji d
Cornell, for example) which have
rates above Stanford's annual
figure of $1020. Yale, Princeton,
Pomona College, the University
of California at Berkeley, and Cal
Tech are among the vast majority
ot schools which have lower room
and board rates.
When The Daily sought an ex
planation from University ad
ministrators, they replied that
| such comparisons were somewhat
misleading because of the inti
mate relationship between room
and board costs and tuition which
I differs in various institutions.

MANY OTHER major institu
tions, as Robert J. Wert, Dean
of Undergraduate Education, ex
plained have combined room,
board, and tuition costs in one
manner or another. As a result,
while the room and board bills
at other schools are lower, the
corresponding tuition bills are
higher than at Stanford,
i Private institutions of a quality
| comparable to Stanford almost
! universally have a higher tuition.
| All eight Ivy League schools have
I tuitions higher than the present
| Stanford figure of $1410 and also
j higher than next year's increased
I tuition of $1575. Yale and Cor
nell. for example, charge $1800
, per year tuition, MIT $1790,
; Princeton $1770, Harvard $1760,
and Cal Tech $1616.
Put simply, Stanford's room
â€¢ and board costs are higli while
'the tuition--though hardly low
; is lower than that at comparable
| schools.
INVESTIGATING further. The
Daily found that one of the rea
| sons for this unusual situation
was that Stanford's present pol
icy is to pay literally all expenses
resulting from any aspect of the
| housing program with tho funds
I received from room and board.
Tho operating costs alone in
University-owned housing facil
ities include salaries and em
ployee benefits for cooks, maids,
' and janitors, food costs, utilities,
i telephone service, laundry, insur
-1 ance and taxes, building and
j grounds maintenance, supplies

I and university ser vices such as
accounting, purchasing, business
i management, and security oft'ic-
I ers.
| In addition, accumulation of
reserves for equipment replace-
I ment and major building repairs
is accomplished by charging 2\ >
i per cent of equipment replace-
I ment costs and 1 L- per cent of
I building costs as part of operat-
I ing expenses.
FURTHERMORE, room and
I board foes also pay 50 per cent
j or more of the salaries of resi
! donee directors, faculty residents,
j secretaries, food service staff and
j hashers, resident assistants, and
| sponsors.
Despite all these expenses,
j however, costs would be lower if
! it were not for one additional
: factor. In eases where there is
j still indebtedness on a housing
unit, the borrowed money plus
I interest is being repaid with
I funds received in room rental pay
; ments.
If food service costs are ex
cluded, it costs, for example, about
j $347 per year per student to op
' crate Florence Moore Mall. Al
though 50 per cent of the funds
; used to construct Florence Moore
were obtained through gifts, it
I was necessary to borrow the
| other 50 per cent so that to pay
j off the loan about $192 per year
[per student must be provided.
I The total operating cost plus debt
! service amounts to nearly $540
per year, considerably more than
, the $420 now charged for room
rental.
TO MAKE up this difference,
(Stanford pools the rental receipts
remaining after operating costs
from all housing units. While all
resident facilities pay $120 per
year per student, many housing
units have little or no indebted
ness and, therefore, arc able to
contribute a larger amount to the
i pool. This excess contribution
.goes to make up the deficit in
| ( urred in Florence Moore an d
other relatively new housing
I units wit h similar financing
st nurtures.
Other major institutions attrib
i ute some of these many expenses
oi part of the debt service costs
to the tuition fees. Hence, the
j room and board costs of most
other schools are lower than
| Stanford while tuition is higher.
An article In tomorrow's Daily
will explore the question of the
financing of new housing in
j more detail and outline the im
pending crisis faced by tire resi
dence university concept because
of rising construction and operat
ing costs.
