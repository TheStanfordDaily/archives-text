## Major Changes Possible In Women's Social Regs 
### Justin Beck 
While a great debate still rages in the letters column of The
Daily on whether Stanford girls are worth dating, another more
serious question is being raised, on what kind of hours women
who manage a date should have.
Indications are now that student pressure on that issue will lead

to change, possibly as early as
spring quarter, and that that
change could be major, very likely
the abolition of hours for senior
women, if not more.
Considered La*»l Year
Ending social regulations for
seniors has been considered by
students at least as early as last
year, although this is the first
time at least in the last few
years, that the idea has had wide
spread support.
ASSU President Bud Wedin was
approached last year by students
concerned with the regulations.
However Wedin felt that there
was no great interest among the
women on this, and was also com
mitted ot several other projects,
so the idea was shelved until this
fall.
Now the interest lacking last
year appears lo be present. Sev
eral sponsois and Women's Coun
cil have indicated that some
change is needed, and their atti
tude seems typical of women's
feelings.
Women's Council, a group of
wild-eyed radicals only by stan
dards of radicalism not yet dis
covered, has even gone as far as
to suggest a 9 a.m. sign-in time
for seniors.
Dean Wert, always a fast man
with a committee, has responded
to possible student discontent, by
having a committee study the
matter. Now Women's Council
has come up with a proposal for
that committee to study, in what
may he the neatest display of
teamwork since the Cubs lost
Tinker lo Evers to Chance.
AWS Kegs Committee
The committee which has been
handed the whole problem is the
AWS Social Regulations Commit
tee, a group of girls whose duties
in the recent past has been to
edit ihe social regulations hand
book, sort of a combination law
and math book.
Sue Passovoy, the committee
chairman, is hesitant to make any
predictions right now, especially
since her committee has j us t
started to work, but she does
not believe that opposition on
principle exists on ending social
regs for seniors. She feels that if
a good case could be made and
if certain practical and economic
objections could be met, such a
change might be made. The final
decision on such a major change,
she feels, would be made by the
Board of Trustees.
Suprisingly it is the girls who
have come up with objections as
to why they shouldn't be allowed
to stay out past 2:30 a.m. One
of the strangest is a fear that

without hours a date would never j
take a girl home, which could
be serious, especially if she didn't
like the fellow. Now she can tell
him that she has to be in at 1
p.m. and he would never know
the difference.
Why Stay Out i'ast 2:30?
Another reason is that girls I
can't think of any reason to stay i
up past 2:30 with a date, any rea
son that wouldn't mike the;
cherubs on t tie front of Mem Chu |
blush, th.it is. They think if the i
regs are relaxed Women's Coun
cil might have to start fighting
immorality rather than gross j
negligence; there is a difference,
I am told.
But it is a naive girl who
thinks thai immorality begins
when the bars close, or that the i
only entertainment to be found
once the O's pin-ball machines are |
silenced is of a carnal nature. A i
girl needn't blush when she tells |
her parents that she stayed out j
past 2:30. For example, Gil Hile's
all night movies and a couple of j
six packs can make the time pass
quickly.
Of course there is some fear j
that if a girl didn't sign out she ■
might disappear for days and j
days without anyone noticing, un
til finals come around and the,
registrar's office notices the in- j
completes.
Some think, too, that a girl j
might need to be reached. Now.
of course, if a girl isn't sure j
where she is going on a date, she j
might note what clothes she is
wearing. "Oh," says the adminis
st rat ion to an anxious parent
wanting to speak to a daughter,"
we can't tell you where your
daughter is, but she signed out
wearing a red dress."
Unemployed Old Ladies
Then there is the problem of |
unemployed little old ladies who
guard the doors and count the red
tabs, and all the things that
little old ladies do.
Rather than those arguments
the central issue is, how much
responsibility the University has
toward its coeds. Can a Stanford
woman be trusted with the re
sponsibility of maintaining her
own hours, of being her own
judge of her time, of maintaining
without a set of elaborate Uni
versity rules, her own rules of
conduct? Up to now the Univer
sity administration has taken
very seriously its role of parent,
bul perhaps some of the children
are now growing up. Old enough
to drink, old enough to vote, but
not old enough to lead her own ,
life, is the plight of many Stan-!
ford coeds today.
