# Petition Urges Survey Of Social Regulations
## 
### 
A general Petition urging a "thoughtful investigation of social
regulations' is being circulated in women's housing and will he
sent to the Social Herniations Committee.
According to Sue Passovov, chairman of the committee, the
petition will "notify us of the number of girls who are interested

in the study we are doing on
social regulations."
TIIE PETITION states thai
the undersigned "do not promote
one specific plan" but indicate
"support of liberalization."
This liberalization includes the
idea that "the ultimate respon
sibility for a woman's late-leave
program should lie with the in
dividual's good judgment and the
Fundamental Standard and not
with a plan supervised by t li e
University."
"The petition is very general
to get girls to think about changes
they would like to make," Sue
said. "We invite the girls who are
interested and who signed the
petition to come before the com
mittee with specific ideas."
SHE COMMENTED that the
ideas submitted by Women's
Council, which include a sign-in
time of 9 a.m. and a girl's per
sonal key to her housing, were
"interesting proposals well worth
further examination."
Other plans included in the
committee's study are a question
naire and a survey of the social
regulat ions at schools comparable
to Stanford.
