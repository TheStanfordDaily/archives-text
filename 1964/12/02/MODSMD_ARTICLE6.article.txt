# Biological Center Flans Announced
## Work To Begin Early In 1965 
### 
Construction will begin early
next year on a $4.9 million Cen
ter for Biological Studies, Presi
dent Wallace Sterling announced
today.
Work on the first two units of
the center is estimated to take
about I'l months to complete.
TIIIO SITi; of t he Center is on
Serra Street, northwest of Quad,
between Chemistry and Physics,
and conveniently close to the
Stanford Medical Center.
More than $3 million of the
overall cost of the two buildings
will come from the privately
donated Herrin funds, received
by Stanford near the close of the
University's recent PACE cam
paign.
The remainder will come from
i a National Science Foundation
grant of $1,800,250, one of the
largest of its kind ever made to
a university by the federal
I agency, ft will pay about half
| the cost of the research and
I graduate training facilities.
ALL COSTS of the undergradu
-1 ate part of the two-unit project,
| plus the other half of financing
1 graduate and research facilities,
will be met primarily from funds
i received by Stanford from the
, late William F. Herrin and his
daughter, Alice Van Clief Herrin,
i following her death in 1963.
The funds established the Wil
liam F. Herrin Foundation at
| Stanford.
The new buildings will bear
, the Herrin name. William Herrin,
longtime vice-president and chief
; counsel of the Southern Pacific
I Company, was a friend of Sena-
I tor Leland Stanford, the Univer
| sity's founder.
In explaining the pressing need
for new facilities, instrumenta
tion and training, Prof. Clifford
i Grobstcin. executive head of Bio
j logical Sciences, said that biol
ogy today is a "transformed
! science."
"THK TRADITIONAL study of
plants and animals for them
j selves alone is now only a minor
' part of it,"he said.
"It is amplified by a wide va-
I riety of new approaches. Some
biologists working in their labora
tories are hard to distinguish
from mathematicians or physi
i cists, others from chemists or
psychologists.
"The scope of biology ranges
from virus to society. If science
j and the humanities constitute
; two cultures, then biology stands
with its foot in one and its head
j in the other."
They were designed by S a n
! Francisco architect Milton Pflu
ger. Their completion will permit
! biology working areas to be
; moved from t heir pres en t
1 cramped quarters in Jordan Hall
on the Quadrangle, freeing that
building for renovation and other
use.
