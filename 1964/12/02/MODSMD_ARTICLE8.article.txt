# Broke But Unbowed, Sequoia Tries Again
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
Last spring quarter an inir
poverished i> u t determined
band of Stanford literati as
sembled one of the finest
editions of the Sequoia maga
zine in many a year.
Of course, it didn't sell.
But. . . .
Anyhow, this fall, under
the guidance of Editor Char
lotte Low, the Sequoia staff
—still determined, still im
poverished—lias tried again.
The result is one of the finer
collections of Stanford
poetry, prose, and photog
raphy in recent memory.
Of course, it probably won't
sell. But. . . .
At any rate the cover is
catchy. It's a greenish photo
graph of a skeleton, deco
rated with a gold crown and
septre, and nailed to a plank
of wood bearing the legend:
"PRIDE." (It was used as a
stage decoration for the Stan
ford Summer Festival's pro
duction of Volpone.) It's
supposed to represent th e
Deadly Sin of Pride.
"Maybe it could mean that
these are 'proud offerings',"
suggested editor Low timidly.
Maybe.
In any case, as we said,
current Sequoia, resplendant
in it's slimy-sea green cover,
is intelligent, tasteful, an <1
professional. It's also inter
esting. Even entertaining.
Of course, that doesn't
necessarily mean it will sell.
But. . . .
Who wants to be a fat cat,
anyhow.
In sheer volume and, inci
dentally, in quality, the issue
belongs to John E. Matthias,
a TA in the English depart
ment who, during the past
year or so, has become a
regular Sequoia contributor.
His most formidable, and
rewarding, work entitled
"Bucyrus" is ostensibly billed
as a short story, but it more
properly might be termed a
prose poem, or perhaps, a
"prose chant."
In both subject matter and
mood, "Bucyrus" evokes
vague rememberings of T. S.

Eliot's The Wasteland. Ex
cept, of course, that Matthias,
unlike Eliot, has 110 need of
footnotes to make his point.
As a "social critic" he touches
all the bases. Puritanism,
pedantry, middle-class myth
ology and middle-class hypoc
risy — all doctrines w hi eh
celebrate a sterile ordering
of life over life itself — are
revealed as ludicrous, mon
strous, and, quite literally,
grotesque.
"Bucyrus" is a fable and a
nightmare. It is also quite
possibly a cosmic parody.
It is never obscure, but it is,
unfortunately, difficult — un
fortunately, because one sus
pects that only a few hardy
souls will bother to read past
the first page. And that
would be a shame.
After "Bucyrus," Jonathan
Emerson's short story "A
Morning In Maine" seems
rather mundane. One is al
most grateful for it. In fair
ness, however, it is not with
out. a certain quiet power, a
I lower which builds steadily
from an aching sigh to a
tearing scream. One can't
help suspecting that Mr. Em
erson must at some point
have read Ernest Heming
way's Nick Adams stories
with deliberate care, but the
imitation — if it be that in
deed — is inoffensive, even
refreshing.
The volume is rounded out
by a collection of six rather
uniformly acceptable poems
(including one very beautiful
and sensual bit of prosity
from Mattbais, whose talents
are happily various), an ar
ticle on religious liberty ex
cerpted from Professor Rob
ert >1. Brown's book 011 the
second session of the Ecu
menical Council entitled Ob
server In Rome, an acid edi
torial comment on the Ameri
can student abroad, and, last,
but certainly least, twenty
pages of slick campus photo
graphs by Leo Holub who is
unaccountably fond of im
mortalizing various bucolic
scenes of academe.
Maybe the pictures will
sell, anyhow.
