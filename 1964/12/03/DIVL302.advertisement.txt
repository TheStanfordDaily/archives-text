GocS s View of Man
Did you ever stop to think how God views man? In self-defense we like to
think highly of ourselves and by projection edify our fellow men ( idolizing"
leaders and building up in our minds a false picture of reality which is man
centered). Although at times it is a bit hard to face the facts, nevertheless it is
very therapeutic to see how God views man, and then to discover that despite
the seriousness of our need, God has met it fully in sending Jesus Christ, the
Author and Finisher of our faith, to be man's Savior and Deliverer. We urge you
to consider carefully God's view of man and to avail yourself of His one answer
to every human need:
As the Scriptures say, no one is good —no one in all the world. No one has
ever really known God s way, or even truly wanted to. Every one has sinned; j
all are worthless to God. No one anywhere has kepi on doing what is right;
not one! Their talk is foul and filthy like the stench from an open grave. Their
tongues are loaded with lies. Everything they say has in it the sting and poison
of deadly snakes.
Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness. They are quick to kill, hating
anyone who disagrees with them. Wherever they go they leave misery and
trouble behind them. And they have never known what it is to try to be kind
and good. They care nothing about God not what He thinks of them ... in
fact all the world stands hushed and guilty before Almighty God. So you can
see that no one can ever find God's favor by being good enough. For the more
we know of God's laws the clearer it becomes that we don't obey them, for His
laws make us see that we are sinners.
But now God has shown us a different way to heaven —not by being good
enough" and trying to keep His laws, but by a new way (though not new,
really for the Old Testament told about it long ago). God says He will accept
us and make good and bring us to heaven if we trust Jesus Christ to take away
our sins. And we can all be saved in this way, by coming to Christ, no matter
who we are or what we have been like. Yes, all have sinned; all fall short of
God s glorious ideal . . .
God sent Christ to take the punishment for our sin* and end all anger
against us. He used Christ s blood and our faith to satisfy God's wrath. In this
way He was being entirely fair, even though He did not punish those who
sinned in olden times. For He was looking forward to the time when Christ would
come and take away those sins. And now in these days also He can receive
sinners in this same way, because Jesus took away their sins . . .
What can we bocist about doing to earn our salvation? Nothing at all.
Why? Because our salvation is not based on our good deeds; it is based on
what Christ has done and our faith in Him. So it is that we are saved by faith in
Christ and not by the good things we do . . . God treats us all the same,- all,
whether Jews or Gentiles, are approved if they have faith" (Romans 3:10-30
Living Letters).
If you have not yet acknowledged Jesus Christ as Lord, do so today. God's
view of men outside of Christ is grim indeed, but all those "in Christ" have
found an answer which works and a solution which is real.
