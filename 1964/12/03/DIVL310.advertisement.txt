: Tow Jones and Fanny Hill were only two of the many
18th-century fictional characters who had trouble
maintaining their virtue in a world that, it would
seem, couldn't care less. At one time or another, most
of the period's leading writers were preoccupied with
the problem, and none more so than Daniel Defoe.
After getting Robinson Crusoe out of his system, he in
troduced Moll Flanders and, in 1724, a lovely young
Although not as well known today as Fanny or Molly,
Roxana had a far more splendid career and certainly
deserves equal billing. Starting as a penniless 22-year
old widow with five children, she resorted to a course
which, if not praiseworthy, is certainly successful.
Becoming the toast of princes and lords and rich mer
chants, Roxana was a courtesan who was frank enough
to admit the advantages of her situation and woman
enough to live a life of marvelous high adventure.
You will meet her in Roxana: The Fortunate Mis

Turning to a more American pursuit, we commend to
your attention a book entitled, with sensibly descrip

95tf). John Crawford, one of the most successful card
players of our day, doesn't pretend to have written a
book for the rank beginner. But for anyone with
average skill at bridge, gin rummy, poker, pinochle,
blackjack, or hearts, H. T. B. A. C. W. I. T. M. P. C. G.
(as it is known around the office) should prove a very
sound 95c investment.
We introduce our final book for the month with its
opening sentence: "Education is indeed the dullest of
subjects and I intend to say as little about it as I can."
What Jacques Barzun does talk about in Teacher In
America (Anchor, 95< ( ) is teaching itself — the crucial
process of communication in modern life, in and out
if of the classroom. And. since Professor Barzun is one
of our most accomplished prose stylists as well as a
great teacher, his book fully lives up to praise such as
that supplied by the reviewer in The Nation: "The
wittiest and most amusing as well as one of the sound
est and most penetrating of books upon education that
I have ever read." Teacher In America is already
widely-recognized as a classic, and it is avidly read
by a larger audience every year.
