# 'Residence University' Faces Financial Obstacles

### MICHAEL COHEN JEFF DIEFENDORF 
Stanford's acknowledged goal in the field
of housing is someday to become a "residence
university." This ideal is visible in all the work
that has been done in the area of housing
subsequent to the definition of the residence
concept by ihe Board of Trustees.
In its February 1957 statement of a policy
on housing the Board committed the Univer
sity to the residence idea in a resolution which
said in pai t: "The announced long range pol
icy of the University, as the ideal, is ultimate
ly to house all undergraduate students, men
and women, in University facilities on the
campus, except those who because of reasons
of their own are permitted by the University
to live off campus."
IN THE course of our study of housing
costs at Stanford we discovered that the resi
dence university idea appears to be faced with
a severe challenge.
It might be valuable to begin with a look
at some —though by no means all of the Uni
versity's pressing housing problems.
According to the Housing Office occupancy
survey for fall quarter 1964, of a total enroll
ment of 10,773 students, about 4,570 are pres

ently living on the campus. Over 6,000 stu
dents live elsewhere. This number includes
about 38 per cent of the undergraduate men.
A RESIDENCE university will eventually
have to create space for these men who are
presently living off campus.
Under the present system of 100 per cent
on campus residence of undergraduate wom
en, new women's housing is an absolute ne
cessity.
According to a 1957 Planning Office sur
vey of the women's row houses, four may
no longer be habitable by 1967. Five years
later the remaining four may have to be
abandoned. New dormitory space must be
found for the women who will be displaced
as the units are closed.
IN ADDITION, there are programs of im
provements for many of the presently exist
ing housing units designed to bring them up
to a level of quality roughly comparable to
that of the newer construction.
As an example, the program of improve
ments for Stern Hall—if all its sections were
to be completed, which is unlikely — would
cost nearly $800,000.
These then are some of the problems in
the undergraduate housing area: expansion

of housing for the 1600 men who are now
living off campus, new housing for under
graduate women and programs of improve
ments for older housing units,
THE COMPLICATIONS in the area of
housing are clearly long range matters. Care
ful planning, however, is not enough. There
are also massive financial obstacles to be over
come.
In 1955 Wilbur Hall was constructed al
most completely with borrowed funds at a
cost of about $4750 per j student unit. The
money was borrowed at a four per cent inter
est rate for a fifty year.(period.
Wilbur Hall is nearly self-liquidating finan
cially. That is, the income from rentals of
Wilbur rooms comes close to paying for the
combined costs of operating the hall and pay
ing off ihe debt incurred at its construction.
A FEW YEARS later, Florence Moore Hall
was built at a cost per student of about $7500.
About 50 per cent of the construction cost
was financed through gifts, the other 50 per
cent was financed through borrowing for a
40 year period at 5 per cent.
If Florence Moore were to liquidate its
own debt. room rent would be about $540
per year rather than the present $420. Room

rent remains at the $420 level because other
housing on campus has little or no debt re
maining to be liquidated and thus operates
far well under $420 a year.
In essence the excess income from older
housing is being used to pay for newer units
like Florence Moore and Wilbur.
IN A REPORT completed in HKS2, the
Committee on Housing Policy reported to the
Committee on Undergraduate Education that
construction of further housing at Stanford
would require at least $9000 per student unit.
More recent estimates, taking skyrocketing
construction costs into consideration, are even
higher.
New government funds are available at
3\is per cent interest, but even at this low rate
the increase in construction costs means that
any new housing project would have to bo
about 70 per cent financed from sources other
than borrowing. This is necessary to keep
the debt from becoming so large that it can
not be paid without raising rentals to a level
completely uncompetitive with ol'f campus
living.
THERE ARE a variety of possible ap
proaches to the problem of keeping on campus
living competitive with the luxuries of local

apartments with swimming pools.
A partial answer may bo in increasing the
attractiveness of on campus life by increasing
integration of dorm and classroom, or by in
stituting othei programs of special interest.
In the end however, the raw economic
problem must be confronted. The University
cannot escape from economic compel it ion wit h
off campus alternatives for its undergrad
wle men.
IF ALL the costs arising from housing con
tinue to be charged against room and board
bills, and if a way of financing construction
other than borrowing is not found, the Uni
versity will fail to realize a goal to which it
is heavily committed.
The PACE program unfortunately did not
solve the problem of construction financing.
Housing was one of the most seriously un
dersubscribed of the areas in the program.
Housing is now an area of top priority at
Stanford. To realize housing goals, however,
seems to require sacrifice of funds from other
top priority areas. The dilemma must be re
solved soon for the housing issue has reached
pressing proportions in the last: few years and
one way or another a decision 011 what direc
tion to take will have to be made soon.
