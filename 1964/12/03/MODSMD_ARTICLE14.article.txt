# SEX SURVEY SYNOPSIS
## Cerebral Alcoholics v. Well-Bred Univacs 
### SUSAN HEILMANN 
(Last in a Series)
The final part ol' the Stanford dating ques
tionnaire was devoted to giving everyone a
chance to tell in great detail about the good
points and tht bad points of Stanford men and
Stanford women.
It is the women again who give forth their
opinions most freely, writing lavish para
graphs about both themselves and the males.
Males, on the other hand, while eager to co
operate in talking about womtn — especially
what's WRONG with women- prove fairly
reticent in commenting on themselves.
STANFORD women, everyone agrees, are
intelligent, interesting and perceptive. They're
aware of what's going on around them. They're
good conversationalists. They're reasonably
well-bred.
Freshmen women, quite impressed with
Stanford coeds, praise their "maturity." Up
perclass women emphasize their tendency to
he friendly and natural.
As one sophomore coed, aware of the com
petition, reports. "Stanford women have in
telligence matched with good looks and sophis
tication to at least some extent at least you'll
get more of this mixture here than at Paly
High."

MEN ALSO praise the women as person
able. Frosh men notice sophistication. Other
males note that it's also nice thai a good many
Stanford dollies are rich.
Taking honors in the left-handed-compli
ment category is this gem: "One thing good
about Stanford women is that they have the
important characteristic of knowing how to
put you in your place."
Which leads into what's bad about Stanford
women. Men insist, and women ruefully agree,
that Stanford women are too aggressive. Wom
en admit that they compete even among them
selves.
"WOI LI) \ OU want your son to marry a
Univac?" is how one male puts it.
However, a far more serious sin as recog
nized by both sexes is I hat Stanford women
are stuck up. Women describe this as being
a result of conformity, intc lerance, and con
ceit. Women, say women, are TOO social.
"They could think about something besides
guys ONCE in awhile." They're cynical, catty.
A senior bemoans "lack of sisterly love."
They're unfeminine. And besides that, they
don't know how to dress or don't care. A
sophomore insists, "the green book bag and
sandals segment has goi to go. Why don't
Stanford women spend less time on peace cau

cuses and c ivil rights and more time on being
women?"
'iIIIK MEN mention that Stanford women
arc, ia and largo, poor dressers, but males
art 1 i ii more concerned by other matters. The
hi;' Te.'-t problem as they sec ii is that Stanford
women are terribly spoiled. This has resulted
in a race of stuck up snobs who are aloof,
fait hi ss, superficial prudes. Women take ad
\.i tage of the ratio and try to call the shots.
"On the whole, they can be compared to a
dump truck, one sophomore reports.
Males also comment on that lack of sisterly
love. "Mosi of them," insists a male, don't
like women," and adds, "Truthfully, I swear
it."
Ami then, of course, what about the men?
STANFORD MALLS, are praised for in
telligence, well i oundedness, poise and PO
TENTIAL. Once again, women are affected by
manners and charm. Once again, men think
its nice that many males are rich.
Women arc especially pleased that most
Stanford men are good looking and that there
are just lots and lots of them. Men are "well
rounded, active, hard-working," say the wom
en, "They're rich and available." Declares one
sophomore, "Everv one of them is going some
place, has something to offer, is not afraid to

stand up and be counted for what he thinks.
And one coed is willing to praise the fact
that Stanford men "are resourceful enough
not to depend on Stanford women."
WHICH IS, 110 doubt, on the mind of the
male who praises the members of his sex be
cause "they bear up under the situation with
a remarkably low suicide rate."
Men also prove capable of admiring certain
qualities in themselves that the women don't.
Besides being "intelligent, good-looking, well
rounded and having discriminating tastes,"
Stanford men cheerfully report that they are
"hang loose and immoral."
To women, of course, lieing hang loose
means a male lacks goals. This goes along
nicely with their general philosophy about the
bad points of Stanford males. Males are im
mature, negative, conceited and crude. They
are cynical, insecure, sloppy. They use liquor
as a crutch. They have over-stuffed egos and
inferiority complexes. They're inconsiderate,
pretentious prestige seekers. Not to mention
that they're ovcr-sexed.
"THEY'RE slow to call, call to late, and not
often enough."
What makes the males insecure? The wom
en know. "They're afraid they might get at
tached to someone." "They avoid natural rela

tionships and insert tension into th ■ dating
situation." "Thoy are afraid of being intel
lectually overpowered by Stanford women and
they're afraid of l>eing trapped. Therefore,
they tend to encourage the very things they
criticize in dates lack of concern with mean
ingful exchange of ideas and personalities."
"They tend to drink too much and then go
90 MPH on Bayshore at 1 a.m."
WHEN ASKED "What's wrong with Stan
ford men?" the males first response is "Are
you kidding?"
Later, however, thej gave forth with the
following: Stanford men ARE immature,
naive, superficial and insincere. They ARE
crude. They ARE alcoholics. And besides
being too many in number, some males even
admit that Stanford men have tlv wrong at
titude about Stanford women.
They DO have "too little respect for girls."
And, as a a frosh explains, "They set their
standards too high because everyone wants
the best."
But one junior sees hope. "Often Stanford
men tend to be very crass," he admits, "but
erassness varies directly with the number of
units completed. So does discrctness. By the
time we all graduate, we seem pretty refined."
