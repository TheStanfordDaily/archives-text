# Encina Paintings Promote Support For Modern Art
## 
### NORMAN GREENBERG 
When Joseph Jodd, Student Ac
counts Supervisor, decided to in
troduce modern art into Encina
Hall last January, he evoked the
wrath of many workers there.
Many employees preferred not to
work in a museum and said in
no uncertain terms that what
ever else modern art might be,
il was not art.
Since then a curious change
has occurred. Recently, Jodd re
mounted one of the pictures
j which had originally hung in En-
I eina a realistically rendered Al
| pine scene which the Stanford
Museum would rather lend out
I than exhibit.
JEDD SAID that some of those

same people who had previously
criticized the modern art objected
now to the original picture
which certainly says something
about art and the taste for it.
It seems that the abstract works
have succeeded, where the rea
listic ones failed, in provoking
comment and active interest in
the pictures. Jedd observed that
people would find themselves in
trigued and esthetic-ally pleased
by the abstract designs.
Jedd undertook his project in
order to make Encina "an exten
sion of the school program," by
enabling art students to exhibit
their works and observe a public
reception.
TIIE LAST exhibit was a group
of five paintings by Janet Cuth
hertson, a senior art student at
Stanford, who writes of her work,
"In these paintings I was trying
to find something that was un
real ... I had hoped to create
something that could only be
through painting."
The current exhibit, by art stu
dent Brencla Siegel, consists of a
group of studies of the human
figure in pen and chalk.
