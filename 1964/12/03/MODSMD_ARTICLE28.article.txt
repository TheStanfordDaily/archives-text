# Spartans Pose Challenge To Bedell-less Indians
## 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
The Stanford Indians, w ho
showed potential but not bril- j
liance in their winning effort |
against Santa Clara Tuesdayj
night, face the defense-minded j
and offensively strong San Jose j
Spartans at the San Jose Civic j
Auditorium tonight at 8:15.
KCBS will broadcast the game.
Stanford will start the same J
learn it did against the Broncos j
with one important exception. Bob
Bedell, 6't>" junior who is a j
strong rebounder and scorer, j
fractured his jaw when he col
lided with Kent Hinckley in a
race for a loose ball. He was oper
ated on last night and will be out
of action for a minimum of two
weeks.
DICK WEAVER, 6'5U", who is j
a non-letterman but a two-year j
varsity veteran, will start in his j
place. He played a considerable,
amount Tuesday and played well l
underneath on both offense and |
defense.
San Jose St. will pose the first I
serious challenge to the Indians, j
and how they fare on the war-1
path tonight will be a strong indi- 1
cation how the season will pro-1
gress.
The Spartans have quickness, a j
lack of which bothered the In-1
dians noticeably on defense sev
eral times.
TO COUNTER Spartan speed,'
the Indians will have a distinct !
height advantage. Weaver, Clay-!
ton Raaka, and Craig Cordes are !
each one to two inches taller than
their opponent.
Last year, the Spartans led the ;
nation in team defense. Three of
the starters from that team re
turn and with the addition of scv- j
eral JC transfers, they promise |

to be equally stringent and unseat
USF from the WSAC champion
ship.
The high scorers on the Spar
tan squad are forward S. T. Saf- i
ford and Pete Newell, Jr.. both
6'4" juniors. Safford last year
was the leading scorer on the
team and one of the top sophs '
on the coast. 1
THE STARTING guards, Ron
Labeditch and Jackie Gleason, i
are expected to provide offensive j
balance. Labeditch, who stands ;
5'lD" and has quick hands, is a | >
defensive standout and will guard !
Kent Hinckley, who had a hot
hand for the Indians in the sec
ond half in the Broncos game.
If fouls become an important
factor, both coaches Howie Dall
mar and Stu Inman will have to
go to their benches. Spartan re
serves are ti'6" Steve Shlink, de
fensive guard Gary Gresham,
6'9" center Bruce Butler, and
Frank Tarrantts, a regular for
ward last year.
Dallmar, who gave most of his ;
squad game experience against
SC, will again employ reserves to :
some degree, especially Mike j
Priesler and Ray Kosanke.
