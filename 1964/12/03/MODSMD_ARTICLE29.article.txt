Swimming coach Jim Gaugh- :
: ran predicts that USC, defending
; NCAA champion, should grab ihe
i AAWU crown with Stanford,
I UCLA, and Oregon in a pitched

Cards' fastest at the 10U and 200
freestyle. Suvanto returns to
Stanford after competing 112 or
Finland in the Olympic Games.
Bill Schubach, Don Shan-'
ley, Dave Calfee, Tom Stern, Bill
Derrig, Doug Jensen, and J i m
Laney will be names to watch

individual medley, butterfly, and
i freestyle.
j Both USC and UCLA come to
Stanford this winter. The Cards
; meet more conference opponents
than ever before, making trips
to Washington and Oregon.
Though Coach Gaughran has a :
strong set of front line swimmers,
I he is working now to build up a |
'greater degree of depth on the
j team.
Gaughran calls the freshman
team "the best by far for Stan
ford." Mike Wall, who went to
Tokyo with the Olympic team,
looks to a prosperous season. j
Pete Ready, Gary Sheerer, Bill j
Manoogian, Mark Parmely, Bob
Momsen, Doug Miller, C r a i g
Brown, John Kesler, Jon LaMar, j

Jim Props, Mike Greene, and Chip
Walklet are 1 ho mainstays lo the
potent squad.
WRKSTIJNCS
Wrestling coach Bill Leland, in
his second year at Stanford, h a si
fielded the strongest and the
youngest varsity team and the
most powerful freshman team to
campete at Stanford.
Stanford wrestling, on the way
up in the last several years will
be vying for top West Coast
honors this season. The grapplers
have eight home meets, four of
which will be held in the Pavilion.
Tom Allen, varsity captain and
one of the two seniors on the
team, is the returning AAWU
champion in the 177 lb. class.
Steve Schaum, wrestling 167, fin
ished second in the AAWU last
year as a sophomore.
Raj' Burgard (157) and John
Price <167t are cited by Leland
as wrestlers "proven outstanding
and with great potential." Both
are sophomores. Coach Leland
says Bruce Wilhelm, a sopho
more, "has the physical assets,
and could turn into a fine wres
tler." Frank Pratt, also a sopho
more, should show to be an out
standing performer on the squad.
All totaled, the wrestling team
has Id sophomores, 4 juniors, and
2 seniors, every one of which Le
land believes is better than many
of past varsity wrestlers at Stan
ford.
The freshman te;nn demon
strates marked varsity potential.
The two top competitors are John
Suttle in the 137 division and
Bill Vogelpohl at 157.
RUGBY
Pete Kmetovic's varsity rugby
team goes into aclion this Satur
day at 9:30 in the Fouth Annual
Seven-A-Side Tournament to be
held on Stanford fields. Some 30
teams will compete, including
several Farm frats.
An experienced scrum should
provide a solid nucleus for the
varsity ruggers. Randy Vaughn,

Ron Fraboni, Tom Fort man, Bob
Rath, John Brandon, Frank
Patutucei, and Steve Pursel
should be tough for the Cards.
Kmetovic looks to Tim Hansel,
| Dick Ragsdale, Glenn Myers, and
! Henry McQueen to fill in the
backfield after last year's gradu
ation loss. John Faber, a South
African grad student should help
the ruggers.
Several of the top football team
performers have expressed an in
terest in rugby, and Kmetovic
anticipates added strength. About
80 players are expected to turn
out for rugby, so Stanford should
have no trouble in fielding a
team with depth and experience.
One hole yet to fill is that of
the place kicker.
Cal should give the ruggers
their most vigorous competition
as has been the case when the
sport came to Stanford in 1906.
GYMNASTICS
John Gilmore, in his second
year as gymnastics coach, has
two returning lettermen, A 1 Miya
moto and Bill Rusher.
Miyamoto, who averaged 8.4
points out of 10 last season,
placed ninth in the NCAA side
horse competition. A senior, Miya
moto also works the parallel bars.
Bill Rusher, also a senior, works
the parallel bars as well as the
long horse, the rings, and the
horizontal bar.
John Rinderknecht, a sopho
more, and junior Mark Landes
should bolster the squad.
The Tribe gymnasts meet LJSC
and UCLA for the first time down
south. Cal, who has gone unde
feated in the last six years, meels
Stanford twice. The Cards meet
seven different teams.
The Pavilion will be the new
site for gymnastics meets at Stan
ford. The gymnastics leam also
has new equipment.
Gilmore has a good freshman
team and two promising redshirts.
In a league growing steadily

team goes into aclion this Satur
day at 9:30 in the Fouth Annual
Seven-A-Side Tournament to be
held on Stanford fields. Some 30
teams will compete, including
several Farm frats.
An experienced scrum should
provide a solid nucleus for the
varsity ruggers. Randy Vaughn,

Ron Fraboni, Tom Fort man, Bob
Rath, John Brandon, Frank
Patutucei, and Steve Pursel
should be tough for the Cards.
Kmetovic looks to Tim Hansel,
| Dick Ragsdale, Glenn Myers, and
! Henry McQueen to fill in the
backfield after last year's gradu
ation loss. John Faber, a South
African grad student should help
the ruggers.
Several of the top football team
performers have expressed an in
terest in rugby, and Kmetovic
anticipates added strength. About
80 players are expected to turn
out for rugby, so Stanford should
have no trouble in fielding a
team with depth and experience.
One hole yet to fill is that of
the place kicker.
Cal should give the ruggers
their most vigorous competition
as has been the case when the
sport came to Stanford in 1906.

WRKSTIJNCS
Wrestling coach Bill Leland, in
his second year at Stanford, h a si
fielded the strongest and the
youngest varsity team and the
most powerful freshman team to
campete at Stanford.
Stanford wrestling, on the way
up in the last several years will
be vying for top West Coast
honors this season. The grapplers
have eight home meets, four of
which will be held in the Pavilion.
Tom Allen, varsity captain and
one of the two seniors on the
team, is the returning AAWU
champion in the 177 lb. class.
Steve Schaum, wrestling 167, fin
ished second in the AAWU last
year as a sophomore.
Raj' Burgard (157) and John
Price <167t are cited by Leland
as wrestlers "proven outstanding
and with great potential." Both
are sophomores. Coach Leland
says Bruce Wilhelm, a sopho
more, "has the physical assets,
and could turn into a fine wres
tler." Frank Pratt, also a sopho
more, should show to be an out
standing performer on the squad.
All totaled, the wrestling team
has Id sophomores, 4 juniors, and
2 seniors, every one of which Le
land believes is better than many
of past varsity wrestlers at Stan
ford.
The freshman te;nn demon
strates marked varsity potential.
The two top competitors are John
Suttle in the 137 division and
Bill Vogelpohl at 157.
RUGBY
Pete Kmetovic's varsity rugby
team goes into aclion this Satur
day at 9:30 in the Fouth Annual
Seven-A-Side Tournament to be
held on Stanford fields. Some 30
teams will compete, including
several Farm frats.
An experienced scrum should
provide a solid nucleus for the
varsity ruggers. Randy Vaughn,

Ron Fraboni, Tom Fort man, Bob
Rath, John Brandon, Frank
Patutucei, and Steve Pursel
should be tough for the Cards.
Kmetovic looks to Tim Hansel,
| Dick Ragsdale, Glenn Myers, and
! Henry McQueen to fill in the
backfield after last year's gradu
ation loss. John Faber, a South
African grad student should help
the ruggers.
Several of the top football team
performers have expressed an in
terest in rugby, and Kmetovic
anticipates added strength. About
80 players are expected to turn
out for rugby, so Stanford should
have no trouble in fielding a
team with depth and experience.
One hole yet to fill is that of
the place kicker.
Cal should give the ruggers
their most vigorous competition
as has been the case when the
sport came to Stanford in 1906.
GYMNASTICS
John Gilmore, in his second
year as gymnastics coach, has
two returning lettermen, A 1 Miya
moto and Bill Rusher.
Miyamoto, who averaged 8.4
points out of 10 last season,
placed ninth in the NCAA side
horse competition. A senior, Miya
moto also works the parallel bars.
Bill Rusher, also a senior, works
the parallel bars as well as the
long horse, the rings, and the
horizontal bar.
John Rinderknecht, a sopho
more, and junior Mark Landes
should bolster the squad.
The Tribe gymnasts meet LJSC
and UCLA for the first time down
south. Cal, who has gone unde
feated in the last six years, meels
Stanford twice. The Cards meet
seven different teams.
The Pavilion will be the new
site for gymnastics meets at Stan
ford. The gymnastics leam also
has new equipment.
Gilmore has a good freshman
team and two promising redshirts.
In a league growing steadily
stronger, lie hopes Stanford can
show a strong improvement.
Swimming, wrestling, rugby,
land gymnastics .practices are al
ready underway. Competition in
all four winter sports has become
j increasingly keen in the AAWU,
land this year will be no exeep
j tion.
