# The 						Cal Sit-ins
## 
### 
The radical leadership of the Free Speech
Movement at Berkeley has carried to its absurd
extreme the uncompromising fanaticism which
has characterized much of the organization from
the beginning, and which now dominates its
every action.
Tuesdays "ultimatum" to the University and
yesterday's massive sit-in demonstration are
vivid examples of a kind of all-or-nothing ex
tremism which can never provide a reasonable
solution to the problems surrounding political ac
tivity at Cal.
As Mario Savio himself admitted, the Uni
versity was never expected to meet FSM s de
mands. These included insistence on a policy
which the Board of Regents only recently re
jected, that of giving up the University's dis
ciplinary responsibility for students who openly
advocate the breaking of laws. Furthermore, the
ultimatum asked that all charges against Savio
and others be dropped, without even bringing
them before a hearing of the regular committee
concerned with student conduct.
The ultimatum, in short, was never meant to
promote a solution. It was meant instead to
provide a trigger for more violations of Univer
sity regulations.
In presenting that ultimatum and carrying
out the sit-in, the Free Speech Movement has
destroyed its right to be treated as a respon
sible group.
Pushing far beyond its original goal of free
dom for political organizations to operate on
campus, it has evolved into a mob of fanatics

who, stirred by a core of professional agitators,
seem more interested in causing turmoil than
solving the problem.
Fortunately, in discrediting itself so com
pletely, the FSM lias not in the process destroyed
the cause of free political activity at Berkeley.
Besides the responsible leaders of the stu
dent government, there are moderate factions
within the FSM itself who have been working
diligently with University officials to effect a
compromise. While these groups have been heard
less and less within FSM as the organization has
become more and more extreme, they are the
real hope for an equitable solution to the prob
lem. Much progress already has been made.
In light of the irresponsibility of the latest
sit-ins and the possibility of further similar in
cidents, we hope that the moderate groups with
in FSM will repudiate its radical leadership and
dissociate themselves from its actions.
Furthermore, we urge President Clark Kerr
and other administration officials to continue
working in good faith with the responsible ele
ments of (lit 1 student body to hammer out an
acceptable set of rules on political activity.
Finally the administration should take what
ever steps necessary to discipline those respon
sible for the ultimatum and sit-ins, including the
many non-student agitators.
11 is time that the cause of free political ac
tivity at Cal be won—by means of calm negotia
tions among reasonable men. And it is also time
that the Free Speech Movement be repudiated
and punished—by every legal means available.

less and less within FSM as the organization has
become more and more extreme, they are the
real hope for an equitable solution to the prob
lem. Much progress already has been made.
In light of the irresponsibility of the latest
sit-ins and the possibility of further similar in
cidents, we hope that the moderate groups with
in FSM will repudiate its radical leadership and
dissociate themselves from its actions.
Furthermore, we urge President Clark Kerr
and other administration officials to continue
working in good faith with the responsible ele
ments of (lit 1 student body to hammer out an
acceptable set of rules on political activity.
Finally the administration should take what
ever steps necessary to discipline those respon
sible for the ultimatum and sit-ins, including the
many non-student agitators.
11 is time that the cause of free political ac
tivity at Cal be won—by means of calm negotia
tions among reasonable men. And it is also time
that the Free Speech Movement be repudiated
and punished—by every legal means available.
The radical leadership of the Free Speech
Movement at Berkeley has carried to its absurd
extreme the uncompromising fanaticism which
has characterized much of the organization from
the beginning, and which now dominates its
every action.
Tuesdays "ultimatum" to the University and
yesterday's massive sit-in demonstration are
vivid examples of a kind of all-or-nothing ex
tremism which can never provide a reasonable
solution to the problems surrounding political ac
tivity at Cal.
As Mario Savio himself admitted, the Uni
versity was never expected to meet FSM s de
mands. These included insistence on a policy
which the Board of Regents only recently re
jected, that of giving up the University's dis
ciplinary responsibility for students who openly
advocate the breaking of laws. Furthermore, the
ultimatum asked that all charges against Savio
and others be dropped, without even bringing
them before a hearing of the regular committee
concerned with student conduct.
The ultimatum, in short, was never meant to
promote a solution. It was meant instead to
provide a trigger for more violations of Univer
sity regulations.
In presenting that ultimatum and carrying
out the sit-in, the Free Speech Movement has
destroyed its right to be treated as a respon
sible group.
Pushing far beyond its original goal of free
dom for political organizations to operate on
campus, it has evolved into a mob of fanatics

who, stirred by a core of professional agitators,
seem more interested in causing turmoil than
solving the problem.
Fortunately, in discrediting itself so com
pletely, the FSM lias not in the process destroyed
the cause of free political activity at Berkeley.
Besides the responsible leaders of the stu
dent government, there are moderate factions
within the FSM itself who have been working
diligently with University officials to effect a
compromise. While these groups have been heard
less and less within FSM as the organization has
become more and more extreme, they are the
real hope for an equitable solution to the prob
lem. Much progress already has been made.
