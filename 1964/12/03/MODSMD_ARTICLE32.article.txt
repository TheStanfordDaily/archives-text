## Stanford Architecture Shows Sad Lack Of Experimentation 
### 
Dear Sir:
One of the unique features of
a private university is that it is
unemcumbered by the body poli
tic in its support of the unconven
tional and daring. In this position,
it has the opportunity to support
the creative arts as they evolve
and reflect man's changing atti
tudes toward his world and so
ciety. One such art form archi
tecture has been so supported
in various universities, with t he
result that those campuses dis
play the changing tastes of archi
tects and their capacities to deal
with available materials. This
sequence is, of course, continually
added to as the university ages.
Obviously, Stanford has not
seen fit to partake of this experi
ment. This choice of the Board of
Trustees, which is reflected in Mr.
Nelson's comments in a Daily ar
ticle of December 1, points to
what in our mind is a somewhat
unholy alliance with the archi
tecture of the late nineteenth
century. The alternative, of con
tinual architectural experimen
tation, leads to occasional fail
ure's and occasional jewels risk
is involved. But to those who
have experienced the pleasure of
association with great buildings,
the price of failure is not too
high.
Those of us in the academic
buildings of the campus appar
ently cannot question the choice
made by the Trustee-Planning
Office-local • architect-contractor
axis. But we certainly can resent
Mr. Nelson's condescension to
ward those institutions that have
seen fit to eschew conventional
ity and association with the past.
Such an attitude can only be de
scribed as vulgar. It is indeed
ironic that the universities of the
East, whose tradition and roots
run deep, arc in the forefront
of architectural experimentation,
whereas Stanford, in it* search
for uniqueness and character, has
chosen to turn backward instead.
One can only hope that the
"clean, simple" stones of Stan
ford will allow as much light to
pass as do the jewels of the East.

• l iving Saucers?
Dour Sir:
1 was quite surprised by the
letter from John Laval recently
statin;: that the lalesl govern-

I rnent report concerning umden
j tified flying objects "proves be
; yond any reasonable doubt (hat
i UFO's arc unknown superior ma
chines under intelligent control,
| emanating from an extraterrest
rial source." Since Mr. Laval is
apparently not a Stanford stu
dent, I wonder what his motive
for writing this letter was, a n d
I whether this is a "crackpot" let -
j ter or not. I have been quite in
terested in this subject since I
read "The Report on Unidenti
fied Flying Objects," by Edward
J. Ruppclt, who headed the USAF
investigation of UFO's in the
! early 1950'5. Since this time, I
j have no other such reports, al
j though Mr. Ruppelt's well-docu
mented account left me thinking
| that UFO's may indeed lie visitors
j from outer space, and curious
i to read more about them. The
| way the recent reported crash of
! a UFO iti England was silenced
! further heightened my curiosity.
I Would the "Unidentified Mr.
j Laval make himself known so I
! could discuss this subject with
j him.

• Dating Myth Quantized
Dear Sir:
Seldom has a topic been treated
j as subjectively, emotionally, il
; logically, and belligerently as the
dating ratio here at Stanford.
: People who should know better
have come out with fantastically
! inane statements, culminating in
i Susan Heilmann's line, "Maybe
I it's not the system after all. May
i be it's you."
Actually the situation is quite
| easy to analyze. There arc 2,488
: female and 8,283 male students
i at the University, leading to a
number ratio of 3.01 to 1. But
actually the dating ratio is not
j quite as grim, since 20 per cent
| of the men are married, as op

posed to only 4 per cent of the
women. The corrected ratio thus
is somewhat closer to unity,
amounting to 2.74 to 1.
If we now make the assump
tions that students date in equal
proportions outside of the Univer
sity, that all dates are between
members of the opposite sex, and
that married people do not date,
then the ratio implies that girls
have 2.74 times as many dates as
the men. If we now use Susan
Heilmann's claim that the men
have 1 to 2 dates a week, then
the women must have 2.74 to 5.48.
Clearly Susan's statistics cannot
be correct, or Stanford's female
population would flunk wit h
amazing rapidity. Better numbers
would be 1.8 dates per week for
the women, and 0.3 dates per
week for the men.
The ratio of 2.74 applies to ac
tual dates, rather than to at
tempted dates. As far as the sec
ond category is concerned, th e
ratio is considerably higher,
since many men will in general
call the same preciously few
good-looking, warm-blooded girls
first. Needless to say, a consid
erable number of the girls are
such that they are never asked
out. They are the ones who write
vehement letters to The Daily.

• 'Ideal Dolly* Syndrome
Dear Sir:
It is an interesting commen
tary on the Stanford outlook that
the term social life is equated
with the term date. Is there really
a significant difference between
the Stanford male whose "ideal
dolly" must possess "good looks"
and a "good personality" and the
child whose ideal is to be a fire
man? Growth must defy such
narrow conventions.
