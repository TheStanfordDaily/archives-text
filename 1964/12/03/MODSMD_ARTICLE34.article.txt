# On The
## Lesson Of Congo: Avoid World Opinion Paralysis 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
| The foreign minister of Belgium ealled in the Russian am
bassador and said to him: "See, we are not guilty of imperialism.
! We have already withdrawn the paratroopers from the Congo."
It is not reeorded whether the Russian ambassador was paeified.
If M. Spaak thinks lie was, he lias not read enough Communist

! theory, nor sufficiently observed
j Communist practice, to discharge
'effectively his role as foreign
; minister of a Western power.
The mess in the Congo, after
all, is primarily the fault of Bel
gium, whipped into a dogmatic!
i anti-colonialism by its own social
ists (including M. Spaak», and
by world opinion. The bloodshed j
and misery, the utter, hopeless!
j chaos in the Congo since 1960, is
the direct result of the premature!
withdrawal <>112 the Belgians.
And when, last week, the 1 coun
try finally felt the necessity to:
send par iroopeis to save the
lives of while ' i ostages the neu
tralist an Commuiist world, |
cod'.led o vi the years by West-1
ei m anti-colonialists, exploded in |
pique, No less than 700,000 Red
Chinese cheered Mao Tse-tung in
Peking when he denounced Bel

j paratroopers for 72 hours into the
! Congo to rescue a few while eiti-j

j head southwest towards the Con-!

Mao and Tibet
It is not reported whether it
occurred to anyone that in facing
in that particular geographical di
i rection his line of sight, to reach
i the Congo, had to traverse Tibet,
| against which Chairman Mao con
ducted a genocidal. imperialistic
war so few years ago. with utter
impunity.
Meanwhile in Moscow, students

I States Embassy. And in Nairobi,
| representatives of the black na
j tions met to denounce, with the
l honorable exception of Nigeria,
1 not the Communist-hacked rebels,
but the Belgians; and Tshombe,
i for hiring mercenaries.
What's done, as the saying goes, j
cannot be undone, and there is
no way to restore a Belgian gov-j
ernment in the Congo, to stay j
there for say another fifty years, [
until creeping civilization comes
in. But although we cannot there-j
fore reoccupy the Congo, we
should at least learn from the |
mistake of 1960 something about
the dangers of subservience to
public opinion.
The Rescue Operation
M. Spaak did the right and I
courageous thing in sending the |
Belgian army to rescue his and ;
our nationals. But the entire ma
neuver was so hedged with cau

tion, with trepidation, with self
doubt, as to encourage the voices
of protest from a world opinion
grown arrogant, and used to its
i power to suppress the defensive
reflexes of the West.
Hundreds of white men will
' have been killed in North Congo
by the weekend and who knows
how many of them died or will
I die because Spaak felt it neces
i sary to approach Stanleyville
j only after well-publicized stops
in Asencion Island the least

by the minute attentions of a
press which hardly has any busi

the enemy of its whereabouts

Sum Syndrom*'
It is a part of what Mr. James
Burnham, in Suicide of the West,
called the "Suez syndrome," re
ferring to the right instinct of
; the Western powers in 1956 to
| abort Nasser's pan-Arabic, anti
i Western mania before ii became
impossible to cope with, but fail
ing to summon the reserves of
courage and steadfastness to
bring it off. The Suez syndrome
is working against us in South
Vietnam today: we are there com
mitted to the right thing, but
have not drummed up the resolu
tion to carry the assignment for
! ward.
M. Spaak should have left his
soldiers in Stanleyville (after all,
they have to barrack down some
where) until the area is more
generally pacified, and only then
leave. And the President of the
United States should have served
notice that the next time its quar
ters in Moscow are attacked, we
shall withdraw our representa
tives just as General Eisen
hower withdrew them from Ha
vana under similar provocations
until the host government gives
evidence it can give them the
] proper protection.
The moral is we must not tip
toe embarrassedly about th e
world in defense of our nationals
and our legitimate national inter
j ests. That way we do not accom
plish our goals, but rather en
courage our enemies, and the
moral cretins who think we are
their enemies, to believe that we
ourselves, deep down, doubt the
tightness of our cause.
