# LESSON FOR OUR TIME
## Freelovland Attains New Harmony Between Sexes 
### CANDIDE II 
It was my good fortune that while Hoeing I ruin the Grand
Inquisitor, Chance brought me to that happy kingdom of I'ree
lovlaud, nestled high in the Handrian Mountains, the exact loca
tion ol which I promised the inhabitants never to disclose.
Here, all those problems of college dating that exist in other

countries have been solved, and*
it would he useful, t think, to see
how this was accomplished, as
it would give us a good example
to follow.
THE FREELOVLANDEKS had,
! previous to "The Incident," la-!
| bored under the same dating j
i problems we have today. This all!
| changed, however, 1 was told,
when one Rick Messy, a student j
at the local JC, raved all over!
one Bonnie Boner for inadequate ;
attention to his person.
It seems that Miss Boner
wouldn't give Messy a CARE !
package, let alone the time of j
day, despite repeated attempts on j
Messy's part to strike up a con-1
versation with her before and
after history class (Social Diplom
acy 1815).
Moreover, whenever Messy ap
j proached her on campus, Miss
Boner had the blatantly obnox-!
j ions habit of whipping a brown
| bag over her head to avoid hav-
I ing to look at him. Thi* added to
i Messy's consternation, although
some students maintained that j
| such action did wonders for the
campus in general and for Miss
1 Boner in particular.
MESSY'S PATIENCE reached
; the breaking point. One day while
exiting from class, Messy's polite
; gesture of holding the door for
! Miss Boner wenl unthanked, per !
j usual. While Miss Boner was
mumbling something about
"Crest," "deranged octopi," "spe
cial treatment," and "creeping
hands," Messy, in a blind rage,
pushed her down a flight of .'-50 or
j so stairs. Rushing to the bottom j
he grabbed Miss Boner by the
hair and dragged her onto the
library lawn, where lie vented his
frustrations upon her and tossed
| her into the fountain all of |
this, 1 should add, to the amuse
ment of many students and sev- \
eral faculty members.
Despite the consistency of
Messy's act with his general so
cial philosophy (Messy had main
tained that there wasn't enough
display of public affection on the
campust, the school authorities
rewrote tlie social regulations to
prevent further such incidents.
AEE OIRLS, according to the
new regulations, were required to'

go dutch on all dates. This eased
the tension that had been pro
duced by the male's "claim" to
sexual favors for "services ren
dered," and displays of affection
thereafter occurred only between
similarly inclined partners.
Of course, the cost of living
rose markedly for the females,
but this was in fact a worthwhile
price to pay for the elimination
of those sinister, ever-lurking,
predatory beasts: Hand-Pinching
Vice and his fralernal brother,
Creeping Hand.
Furthermore, girls were re
quired to thank males for acts of
I courtesy and to "look at males"
i more often. They were also re
' quired frankly to shoot down (in
big, belching flames) date offers
from males they weren't inter
ested in dating. The males pre
| ferred it this way rather than
having to put up with the disgust
ing amount of desultory dribble
j ("My 110-year-old grandmother
was robbed and beaten last
week, so I'm going home this
j weekend to take care of her.")
thai usually flowed over the
j phono when a girl wished "po
litely" to refuse a date.
FINALLY, women were, urged
to encourage desirable dates to
! call again, should they be unable
to accept the male's first offer,
! as such conduct was considered
neither impolite nor uncouth and
was in fact welcomed by th e
' males.
These innovations ushered in a
new ago of social tranquility at
the JC which eventually spread
Uhroughout Freelovland. The out
rages suffered by the more nu-
I merous males at the hands of
the 1,700 Valkyries and Harpies
were eliminated and the equal
ity of status shared by both sexes
produced nothing but the deepest
respect between the two. Males
no longer felt inferior (real or
imagined) and females lost their
sense of truculent superiority,
The "voluntary" nature estab
lished in dating practices by the
new social regulations eventually
: led to the reign of the "Voluntar
! ily Accepted Creeping Hand" and
all was peace and harmony
throughout the kingdom. It re
' mains so today.

Despite the consistency of
Messy's act with his general so

tained that there wasn't enough
display of public affection on the
campust, the school authorities
rewrote tlie social regulations to
prevent further such incidents.
AEE OIRLS, according to the
new regulations, were required to'

go dutch on all dates. This eased
the tension that had been pro
duced by the male's "claim" to
sexual favors for "services ren

similarly inclined partners.
Of course, the cost of living
rose markedly for the females,

Creeping Hand.
Furthermore, girls were re
quired to thank males for acts of
I courtesy and to "look at males"
i more often. They were also re
' quired frankly to shoot down (in
big, belching flames) date offers
from males they weren't inter
ested in dating. The males pre

It was my good fortune that while Hoeing I ruin the Grand
Inquisitor, Chance brought me to that happy kingdom of I'ree
lovlaud, nestled high in the Handrian Mountains, the exact loca
tion ol which I promised the inhabitants never to disclose.
Here, all those problems of college dating that exist in other

countries have been solved, and*
it would he useful, t think, to see
how this was accomplished, as
it would give us a good example
to follow.
