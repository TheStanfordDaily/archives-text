# TREVOR-ROPER:
## Hitler: The Genius Without Greatness 
### DOUG OHMANS 
"It is the duty of the historian to make a distinction between
moral and political judgments. It is especially difficult to do this
with Hitler. Dr. Hugh H. Trevor-Hoper thus stated the basic
difficulty in trying to determine "Milter's Place in History."
He maintained that Hitler represented both "the meanest spirit

that has ever been accepted voM
untarily by any nation" and
"revolutionary genius." Histor
ians who "have sought to reduce I
Hitler's political stature to his
moral stature" are attempting
the impossible, he said.
"THE MINI) OF Hitler," said
Trevor-Roper, "showed no signs
of human greatness." for Hitler
"accepted no conventions of hu-:
inanity." He gloried in his crimes!
as 6nds in themselves, not as the
"unfortunate necessities" to high
er ends typical of other revolu

; tions.
Hitler was "morally contempt
ible," said Trevor-Roper, but poli
tically he was far from a victim
of circumstance. "Hitler built up
from nothing his irreversible des
potism," He planned the course
of the Third Reich until its de
; feat. And he personally controlled
and attended lo the details of
| the revolution.
Hitler was the "driving force"
who somehow managed not to be
' "devoured by his own revolution."
