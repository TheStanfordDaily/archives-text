# Sproul Hall Crammed As 1000 Stage Sit-In
## Students Support 4 FSM Leaders 
### JIM BRISCOE 
Over 1,(K)() students at the
University of California settled
down in Sproul Hall last night
for a massive sit-in demonstra
tion designed to force the Cal
Administration to halt discipli
nary action against four leaders
of the Free Speech Movement.
The students, lead by FSM head
Mario Sa\ io and folksinger Joan
Baoz, moved into the building
yesterday afternoon following a
rally on the steps of the hall.
DURING the rally ASUC Presi
dent Charles Powell asked th e
students to think "long and hard"
before participating in the demon
st rat ions.
The ASUC Senate had passed
the previous night a resolution
urging "responsible" students to
stay away from the demonstra
tion.
CAMPUS POLICE made no
effort to stop the demonstrators
from entering the building.
The doors to the building were
locked at 7 p.m. last night. Police
manned the doors allowing stu
dents to leave but not to enter
the building.
Leaders of the group pledged
to continue the sit-in until all dis
ciplinary action was dropped.
A few students left t he building
when police asked all under 21
years of age to go home.
A CROWD OF three to four
thousand students congregated
outside the building after th e
doors were locked.
The administration has thus
far issued no orders to remove
the demonstrators. Student lead
ers asked the crowd outside to
jam the doorways if any attempt
is made to remove students from
the hall.
A large group of Teaching As
sistants has threatened to go on
strike today and Monday if any
attempt is made to remove the
students or if any outside police
are called in.
A SPOKESMAN for the FSM
reporter! that some departments
have pledged 100 per cent not to
cross picket lines if strikes are

called.
According to student leaders,
the demonstrators will employ
only non-violent tactics. If arrests
are made, students have instruc
tions not to link arms or resist
in any way.
In event of arrests, however,
an attempt will be made to jam
all exits.
TIIK FS.M announced that con
trary to previous reports, ap
proximately 9."3 per cent of the
demonstrators were Oil students.
A tpiick poll taken by the FSM
showed .197 students among t ho
637 demonstrators questioned.
Last night's sit-in followed an
ultimatum issued Tuesday by the
FSM demanding:
• All charges be withdrawn

against Savio. Arthur Goldberg,
Jacky Goldberg and Brian Turner.
Disciplinary action had previously
been taken against these students
in connection with the October 1
; riots at Berkeley.
• No further disciplinary ac
j tion be taken pending a settle-
J ment with the FSM.
• An end to regulations "which
I needlessly restrict students of
| their organizations in the exer
| eise of their on-eampus political
i rights."


IN OR OUT — A Cal policeman
ultimatum of his own. The door
7 p.m. After that students were

presents demonstrators with an
's to Sproul Hall were locked at
allowed out but not in.
