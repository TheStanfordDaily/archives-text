## Cacophony for Free Speech 
### BRUCE BURTON 
Sproul Mall corridors were a scene ol'
nervous activity yesterday as members of
I lie FSM sat, talked, 1 shouted announce
ments, and sang freedom songs during the
largest "free speech" demonstration since
early October.
Throughout the 1 afternoon, an estimated
1200 members ol the Free Speech Move
ment swarmed through the building, some
carrying guitars and others babies. Some
demonstrators were bearded and dressed
in blue jeans, others wore neat business
suits and dresses.
Birr ALL WEKE there for one purpose:
to show the administration of President
Clark Kerr that FSM would. as one mem
ber of the organization stated, "establish
here once and for all that we are the
governed and should have a voice in the
government."
The demonstiators were friendly and
talkative, and most of all unworried about
tiie possibility ol arrest: "We are willing

"We want to be judged as citizens instead
of being arbitrarily punished by the Uni
versity."
On the fourth floor, however, the dedi
cation of the participants was weaker than
on the floors below. Set up as a study hall,
it held those students who would probably
attend classes today.
"I WILL ATTEND English tomorrow
I like it and I'm afraid to miss it," said
one girl.
"1 have two midterms on Friday, and
regardless of the FSM, I have to go," said
another.
OllTSii)|<; tiie lIALL, curious students
watched pickets carrying "We Shall Over
come" and "In Loco Parentis" banners. A
group of four students, two sophomores
and two juniors, said they felt that the
majority of Cal students were against the
FSM. "1 don'l think they're actually de
monstrating for free speech," one declared.
"The University has every right to do what
it did."
One freshman uirl said that the "Com

munis! influence and the tactics" of the
KSM "are ridiculous they're getting out
of hand." j
The director of the Republicans for Con
servative Action, Fred Ullner, stood on the
steps of Sproul Ilall, and offered (his com
ment: "There are the same faces in these
halls as at the Sheraton Palace and the
Cadillac line. The professional pickets are
back. The majority of the demonstrators
are sincere in their beliefs but are being
blindly led."
NOT AM, OF Till; crowd outside the
building was anti-FSIVI. Money booths set
up near the steps were doing a lucrative
trade in rallying funds to buy food lor
the demonstrators inside. Furthermore,
other members of the crowd showed sup
port for the FSM by sporting blue and
white buttons.
Back inside the building, the only relaxed
persons were the campus police. They re
ported no violence resulting from the dem
onstration and their only problem was find
ing additional parking for the press.
