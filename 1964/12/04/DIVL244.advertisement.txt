lfou don't have to be a philosophy
major to understand the logic of $L
the TRAVEL VALE! BAG \
It's the most sensible and inexpensive approach ' I
to beat the high cost of luggage and the usual ! n -a /
wrinkling of clothing when packed in a conven- \ U "™ — IV/
tional suitcase. Whether traveling by plane, i I jjp£
train, or car, your clothes hang neatly and freely. " /pi
Take your suits or dresses straight from the closet, j |j ' "Jl
leave them on the hangar, and slip right into your i 1 '
TRAVEL VALET BAG. The heavy durable vinyl
will fully protect your garments. The full length
zipper closure completely protects against soiling, j
and moisture. The university seal is attractively JL
printed in school color on the opaque white back
qround, with its richly embossed taffeta surface. Mm
The man's suit bag is 40" long and the woman's
dress bag is 54 " long - both priced at $1.98 each ™
