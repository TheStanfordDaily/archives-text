God, Abraham, and You
The great Jewish Patriarch Abraham lived a good four thousand years ago,
but the Bible has a lot to say about this man who walked with God, which is
relevant for you today. The consequences of Abraham's obedience to God are
so far-reaching that even Christians today are said to be included in his family
by faith in Jesus Christ Galatians 3:29)1
The most important lesson for us to learn from the life of this Patriarch of
the Old Testament is that God has always dealt with men in precisely the same
way He dealt with Abraham—that is, in response to man's personal trust and
commitment to God. Abraham knew the same Lord Jesus Christ you are invited
to meet (Genesis 18), and was called, because of his faithfullness, the friend
of God"! Paul, in his letter to the Romans says:
God treats us all the same,- all, whether Jews or Gentiles, are approved if
they have faith . . . Abraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jew
ish nation. What were his experiences concerning this question of being saved
by faith? Was it because of His good deeds that God accepted Him? If so, then
he would have something to boast about. But from God's point of view Abraham
had no basis at all for pride. For the Scriptures tell us Abraham believed God,
and that is why God canceled his sins and declared him just and righteous. But
didn't he earn his right to heaven by all the good things he did? No, for being
saved is a gift; if a person could earn it by being good, then it wouldn't be free
— but it is! It is given to those who do not work for it. For God declares sinners
to be right in His sight if they have faith in Christ to save them from God's
wrath ...
Was it by faith alone? Or because he also kept the Jewish rules? For the
answer to that question, answer this one. When did God give this blessing to
Abraham? It was before he became a Jew—before he went through the Jewish
initiation ceremony of circumcision . . .! So Abraham is an example of those who
believe and are saved without obeying Jewish laws. Wc see then that those who
do not keep these rules are justified by God through faith ... So it is clear that
God's promises to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was
not because Abraham obeyed God's laws but because he trusted God to keep
His promise . . . the fact of the matter is this: when we try to gain God's bless
ing and salvation by keeping His laws, we always end up under His anger, for
we always fail to keep them. The only way wp can keep from breaking God's
law is not to have any to break!
So God s blessings are given to us by faith, as a free gift; we are certain
to get them whether or not we follow Jewish customs, if we have faith like
Abraham's, for Abraham is the father of us all when it comes to these matters
of faith . ..
Abraham never doubted. He believed God, for his faith and trust were
strong ... he was completely sure that God was able to do anything He
promised. And because of Abraham's faith God forgave His sins and called him
just and good. Now this wonderful promise—that he was accepted and ap
proved through his faith—wasn't just for Abraham's benefit. If was for us, too,
assuring us that God will accept us in the same way He accepted Abraham —
when we believe the promises of the God who brought back Jesus our Lord
from the dead. He died for our sins and rose again to make us right with God,
fillinq us with God s goodness (Romans 3:30, 4:1*25 living Letters).

God, Abraham, and You
The great Jewish Patriarch Abraham lived a good four thousand years ago,
but the Bible has a lot to say about this man who walked with God, which is
relevant for you today. The consequences of Abraham's obedience to God are
so far-reaching that even Christians today are said to be included in his family
by faith in Jesus Christ Galatians 3:29)1
The most important lesson for us to learn from the life of this Patriarch of
the Old Testament is that God has always dealt with men in precisely the same
way He dealt with Abraham—that is, in response to man's personal trust and
commitment to God. Abraham knew the same Lord Jesus Christ you are invited
to meet (Genesis 18), and was called, because of his faithfullness, the friend
of God"! Paul, in his letter to the Romans says:
God treats us all the same,- all, whether Jews or Gentiles, are approved if
they have faith . . . Abraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jew
ish nation. What were his experiences concerning this question of being saved
by faith? Was it because of His good deeds that God accepted Him? If so, then
he would have something to boast about. But from God's point of view Abraham
had no basis at all for pride. For the Scriptures tell us Abraham believed God,
and that is why God canceled his sins and declared him just and righteous. But
didn't he earn his right to heaven by all the good things he did? No, for being
saved is a gift; if a person could earn it by being good, then it wouldn't be free
— but it is! It is given to those who do not work for it. For God declares sinners
to be right in His sight if they have faith in Christ to save them from God's
wrath ...
Was it by faith alone? Or because he also kept the Jewish rules? For the
answer to that question, answer this one. When did God give this blessing to
Abraham? It was before he became a Jew—before he went through the Jewish
initiation ceremony of circumcision . . .! So Abraham is an example of those who
believe and are saved without obeying Jewish laws. Wc see then that those who
do not keep these rules are justified by God through faith ... So it is clear that
God's promises to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was
not because Abraham obeyed God's laws but because he trusted God to keep
His promise . . . the fact of the matter is this: when we try to gain God's bless
ing and salvation by keeping His laws, we always end up under His anger, for
we always fail to keep them. The only way wp can keep from breaking God's
law is not to have any to break!
So God s blessings are given to us by faith, as a free gift; we are certain
to get them whether or not we follow Jewish customs, if we have faith like
Abraham's, for Abraham is the father of us all when it comes to these matters
of faith . ..
Abraham never doubted. He believed God, for his faith and trust were
strong ... he was completely sure that God was able to do anything He
promised. And because of Abraham's faith God forgave His sins and called him
just and good. Now this wonderful promise—that he was accepted and ap
proved through his faith—wasn't just for Abraham's benefit. If was for us, too,
assuring us that God will accept us in the same way He accepted Abraham —
when we believe the promises of the God who brought back Jesus our Lord
from the dead. He died for our sins and rose again to make us right with God,
fillinq us with God s goodness (Romans 3:30, 4:1*25 living Letters).
