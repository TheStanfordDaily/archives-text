# Cal Campus Deeply Divided Over FSM Sit-Ins
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Editor 
The main entrance to tho Berkeley cam
pus, crowded with thousands of students, was
a nightmare of competing voices, myriad
picket signs, and high emotional tension yes
terday.
As dozens of helmeted police dragged over
800 student sit-ins from Sproul Hall to wail
ing buses, a student strike was being organ
ized by the Free Speech Movement on the
building's front steps.
PLACARDS were appearing and long lines
of picketers were urging their fellow students
not to attend class until Tuesday noon, when
the Academic Senate is scheduled to meet.
Others were passing out leaflets or collecting
bail money.
And a rally sponsored by the ASUC Presi
dent Charlie Powell to show that "there is an
alternative" was cancelled and then held any
way on a plaza farther away from the FSM
demonstrators.
It was a strange and puzzling spectacle.
Apparent in all the confusion was a deep divi

sion within the Cal student body; and in the
speeches and placards and individual conver
sation, a kind of dialogue was being carried
on.
THE SPEAKERS of tin* Free Speech
Movement rally exhibited an almost religious
fervor for their cause.
One FSM representative, yelling to some
1,500 listeners through a portable loudspeaker
rig, said with pride: "The student-faculty
strike so far has been extremely successful."
he said. Faculty members are behind us and
are raising bail money. All of you who sup
port our cause, stay away from your classes
and join the picket lines. Remember, it is
your freedom that is being taken away, your
rights that are being violated."
Placards reading "A Quest For Dignity"
and "We Want Our Freedom Now" echoed
this fervor.
ALSO DISPLAYED was a bitterness and
a disrespect toward authority. With their lead
ers and friends locked in jail, the remaining
few were obviously angered and disillusioned.
"The notorious Governor Brown may soon
take command!" one speaker cried. A few
students booed.
"In all seriousness," he continued unper

turbed, "it could not have been worse. There
could not have been an administration or a
governor with less respect for the rights of
the students. Not even Governor Wallace
would have ordered 900 arrests."
Another student described to the audience
the events of the previous evening. "Before
we moved in, the administration removed the
IBM cards," he yelled. "Let us be assured,
those IBM cards received better care than any
student."
A Til Hi D SPEAKER took the microphone
and began criticizing President Clark Kerr for
"a philosophy that sees the purpose of the
multi-versity as service to the great military
industrial complex."
Still another speaker drew loud applause:
"The administration should not be given
power. The university should be run by only
two groups — students and faculty!!"
Some of this disillusionment was not the
result of the arrests but rather, perhaps, par
tially the cause of the demonstrations. "Cal
is one big educational factory," one coed, a
senior psychology major, mused, "and the
Movement represents a rebellion against it.
On a personal level this antagonism toward
the system has no power and usually results

only in low grades. But when these rebels get
together- well, you saw what happened."
At noon a loudspeaker voice was heard
from the Student Union across the plaza. It
was the solemn voice of ASUC President
Charlie Powell, called derisively "the strike
breaker" by the FSM.
"WE HAVE DECIDED to call off the rally,"
he said. "This is an extremely volatile situa
tion, and violence could occur. This is a situa
tion of which none of us can be proud. We
must do all we can to correct it." Cheers from
his audience and boos from the crowd on the
steps of Sproul drowned out the loudspeaker.
A half hour later, Powell and other officers
of the ASUC staged an impromptu rally far
ther away from the Sproul audience. There
he continued his theme, a theme of regret
and conciliation quite different from that of
the FSM rally.
"Last night there occurred a most unfor
tunate event,"he said. "We all must feel a
very deep regret for the adverse effect this
wili have on all members of the university
community. . . . This rally is only trying to
show that there is an alternative to demon
strations. . . . This never had to happen."
ONE OF THE MEMBERS of the ASUC

Senate emphasized how much progress had
been made this year. All the original demands
have been met, he said. "The present contro
versy will have to be decided in a court of
law no one, not even the lawyers, agrees on
the answer. But under no circumstances must
mass action and mass sit-ins determine a ques
tion of law."
A questioner in the audience asked where
the ASUC Senate stood on the FSM movement,
and Powell answered. "The ASUC has refused
twice to support demonstrations when all
available channels had not been tried. We sup
ported FSM's original ends, but we have never
supported their means."
The division at Cal may last a long time,
and the bitterness engendered by the use of
police (one placard expressed it by saying
"Are you with us or the cops?") will not soon
disappear.
However, one small coterie on a wall near
Sproul Hall brandished signs reading "ONLY
22 MORE DAYS TILL CHRISTMAS." "We're
serious," the leader explained. "We support
FSM, but our purpose here nosv is to relieve
all this built-up tension."
It was one of the few unqualified successes
of the day.

the ASUC Senate stood on the FSM movement,
and Powell answered. "The ASUC has refused
twice to support demonstrations when all
available channels had not been tried. We sup
ported FSM's original ends, but we have never
supported their means."
The division at Cal may last a long time,
and the bitterness engendered by the use of
police (one placard expressed it by saying
"Are you with us or the cops?") will not soon
disappear.
However, one small coterie on a wall near
Sproul Hall brandished signs reading "ONLY
22 MORE DAYS TILL CHRISTMAS." "We're
serious," the leader explained. "We support
FSM, but our purpose here nosv is to relieve
all this built-up tension."
It was one of the few unqualified successes
of the day.
The main entrance to tho Berkeley cam
pus, crowded with thousands of students, was
a nightmare of competing voices, myriad
picket signs, and high emotional tension yes
terday.
As dozens of helmeted police dragged over
800 student sit-ins from Sproul Hall to wail
ing buses, a student strike was being organ
ized by the Free Speech Movement on the
building's front steps.
PLACARDS were appearing and long lines
of picketers were urging their fellow students
not to attend class until Tuesday noon, when
the Academic Senate is scheduled to meet.
Others were passing out leaflets or collecting
bail money.
And a rally sponsored by the ASUC Presi
dent Charlie Powell to show that "there is an
alternative" was cancelled and then held any
way on a plaza farther away from the FSM
demonstrators.
It was a strange and puzzling spectacle.
Apparent in all the confusion was a deep divi

sion within the Cal student body; and in the
speeches and placards and individual conver
sation, a kind of dialogue was being carried
on.
THE SPEAKERS of tin* Free Speech
Movement rally exhibited an almost religious
fervor for their cause.
One FSM representative, yelling to some
1,500 listeners through a portable loudspeaker
rig, said with pride: "The student-faculty
strike so far has been extremely successful."
he said. Faculty members are behind us and
are raising bail money. All of you who sup
port our cause, stay away from your classes
and join the picket lines. Remember, it is
your freedom that is being taken away, your
rights that are being violated."
Placards reading "A Quest For Dignity"
and "We Want Our Freedom Now" echoed
this fervor.
ALSO DISPLAYED was a bitterness and
a disrespect toward authority. With their lead
ers and friends locked in jail, the remaining
few were obviously angered and disillusioned.
"The notorious Governor Brown may soon
take command!" one speaker cried. A few
students booed.
"In all seriousness," he continued unper

turbed, "it could not have been worse. There
could not have been an administration or a
governor with less respect for the rights of
the students. Not even Governor Wallace
would have ordered 900 arrests."
Another student described to the audience
the events of the previous evening. "Before
we moved in, the administration removed the
IBM cards," he yelled. "Let us be assured,
those IBM cards received better care than any
student."
A Til Hi D SPEAKER took the microphone
and began criticizing President Clark Kerr for
"a philosophy that sees the purpose of the
multi-versity as service to the great military
industrial complex."
Still another speaker drew loud applause:
"The administration should not be given
power. The university should be run by only
two groups — students and faculty!!"
Some of this disillusionment was not the
result of the arrests but rather, perhaps, par
tially the cause of the demonstrations. "Cal
is one big educational factory," one coed, a
senior psychology major, mused, "and the
Movement represents a rebellion against it.
On a personal level this antagonism toward
the system has no power and usually results

only in low grades. But when these rebels get
together- well, you saw what happened."
At noon a loudspeaker voice was heard
from the Student Union across the plaza. It
was the solemn voice of ASUC President
Charlie Powell, called derisively "the strike
breaker" by the FSM.
"WE HAVE DECIDED to call off the rally,"
he said. "This is an extremely volatile situa
tion, and violence could occur. This is a situa
tion of which none of us can be proud. We
must do all we can to correct it." Cheers from
his audience and boos from the crowd on the
steps of Sproul drowned out the loudspeaker.
A half hour later, Powell and other officers
of the ASUC staged an impromptu rally far
ther away from the Sproul audience. There
he continued his theme, a theme of regret
and conciliation quite different from that of
the FSM rally.
"Last night there occurred a most unfor
tunate event,"he said. "We all must feel a
very deep regret for the adverse effect this
wili have on all members of the university
community. . . . This rally is only trying to
show that there is an alternative to demon
strations. . . . This never had to happen."
ONE OF THE MEMBERS of the ASUC

Senate emphasized how much progress had
been made this year. All the original demands
have been met, he said. "The present contro
versy will have to be decided in a court of
law no one, not even the lawyers, agrees on
the answer. But under no circumstances must
mass action and mass sit-ins determine a ques
tion of law."

"Last night there occurred a most unfor
tunate event,"he said. "We all must feel a
very deep regret for the adverse effect this
wili have on all members of the university
community. . . . This rally is only trying to
show that there is an alternative to demon
strations. . . . This never had to happen."
ONE OF THE MEMBERS of the ASUC

Senate emphasized how much progress had
been made this year. All the original demands
have been met, he said. "The present contro
versy will have to be decided in a court of
law no one, not even the lawyers, agrees on
the answer. But under no circumstances must
mass action and mass sit-ins determine a ques
tion of law."
A questioner in the audience asked where
the ASUC Senate stood on the FSM movement,
and Powell answered. "The ASUC has refused
twice to support demonstrations when all
available channels had not been tried. We sup
ported FSM's original ends, but we have never
supported their means."
The division at Cal may last a long time,
and the bitterness engendered by the use of
police (one placard expressed it by saying
"Are you with us or the cops?") will not soon
disappear.
However, one small coterie on a wall near
Sproul Hall brandished signs reading "ONLY
22 MORE DAYS TILL CHRISTMAS." "We're
serious," the leader explained. "We support
FSM, but our purpose here nosv is to relieve
all this built-up tension."
It was one of the few unqualified successes
of the day.
The main entrance to tho Berkeley cam
pus, crowded with thousands of students, was
a nightmare of competing voices, myriad
picket signs, and high emotional tension yes
terday.
As dozens of helmeted police dragged over
800 student sit-ins from Sproul Hall to wail
ing buses, a student strike was being organ
ized by the Free Speech Movement on the
building's front steps.
PLACARDS were appearing and long lines
of picketers were urging their fellow students
not to attend class until Tuesday noon, when
the Academic Senate is scheduled to meet.
Others were passing out leaflets or collecting
bail money.
And a rally sponsored by the ASUC Presi
dent Charlie Powell to show that "there is an
alternative" was cancelled and then held any
way on a plaza farther away from the FSM
demonstrators.
It was a strange and puzzling spectacle.
Apparent in all the confusion was a deep divi

sion within the Cal student body; and in the
speeches and placards and individual conver
sation, a kind of dialogue was being carried
on.
THE SPEAKERS of tin* Free Speech
Movement rally exhibited an almost religious
fervor for their cause.
One FSM representative, yelling to some
1,500 listeners through a portable loudspeaker
rig, said with pride: "The student-faculty
strike so far has been extremely successful."
he said. Faculty members are behind us and
are raising bail money. All of you who sup
port our cause, stay away from your classes
and join the picket lines. Remember, it is
your freedom that is being taken away, your
rights that are being violated."
Placards reading "A Quest For Dignity"
and "We Want Our Freedom Now" echoed
this fervor.
ALSO DISPLAYED was a bitterness and
a disrespect toward authority. With their lead
ers and friends locked in jail, the remaining
few were obviously angered and disillusioned.
"The notorious Governor Brown may soon
take command!" one speaker cried. A few
students booed.
"In all seriousness," he continued unper

turbed, "it could not have been worse. There
could not have been an administration or a
governor with less respect for the rights of
the students. Not even Governor Wallace
would have ordered 900 arrests."
Another student described to the audience
the events of the previous evening. "Before
we moved in, the administration removed the
IBM cards," he yelled. "Let us be assured,
those IBM cards received better care than any
student."
A Til Hi D SPEAKER took the microphone
and began criticizing President Clark Kerr for
"a philosophy that sees the purpose of the
multi-versity as service to the great military
industrial complex."
Still another speaker drew loud applause:
"The administration should not be given
power. The university should be run by only
two groups — students and faculty!!"
Some of this disillusionment was not the
result of the arrests but rather, perhaps, par
tially the cause of the demonstrations. "Cal
is one big educational factory," one coed, a
senior psychology major, mused, "and the
Movement represents a rebellion against it.
On a personal level this antagonism toward
the system has no power and usually results

only in low grades. But when these rebels get
together- well, you saw what happened."
At noon a loudspeaker voice was heard
from the Student Union across the plaza. It
was the solemn voice of ASUC President
Charlie Powell, called derisively "the strike
breaker" by the FSM.
"WE HAVE DECIDED to call off the rally,"
he said. "This is an extremely volatile situa
tion, and violence could occur. This is a situa
tion of which none of us can be proud. We
must do all we can to correct it." Cheers from
his audience and boos from the crowd on the
steps of Sproul drowned out the loudspeaker.
A half hour later, Powell and other officers
of the ASUC staged an impromptu rally far
ther away from the Sproul audience. There
he continued his theme, a theme of regret
and conciliation quite different from that of
the FSM rally.
"Last night there occurred a most unfor
tunate event,"he said. "We all must feel a

wili have on all members of the university
