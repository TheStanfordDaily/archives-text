## JAZZ TRACK Jean Hoffman Held Over In Sausalito 
### RICK BALE 
Jean Hoffman's stay at the Tri
dent in Sausalito has been ex
tended through December, due to
tremendous public response. It
is a shame, however, that Jean's
fans are primarily local diehards,
and that little recognition has
been given this talented and de
serving pianist.
Jean is a classically trained
pianist who has been playing
jazz for about eight years. This
classical influence has found its
way into her construction of
ehordal bases and runs, but pri
marily it is responsible for her
unique way of building a dynamic
line.
It is this dynamic quality that
makes Jean one of the most ex
citing jazz performers I have
ever heard, and binds her fans to
her with such force. Evident most
of all on her ballads, it provides
almost a hypnotic base to which
her voice plays around t lie writ
ten line in a freer, blueish way.
Style Changing
She is not content to stay with
this approach, however, and her
style is undergoing a violent
change, feeling the influences of
other jazzmen. Bill Evans, to
whom she paid a great deal of
attention during his stay at the
Trident last summer, has obvi
ously influenced h e r ehordal
structures as well as selection of
material, and her recent high-low
work at opposite ends of the key

board is Errol Garnerish. Jean is
becoming a more and more seri
ous pianist, less concerned with
her singing, and I would look for
some forthcoming compositions
of her own.
With the excellent backing of
Tom Albedng on drums and Fred
Marshall on bass, Jean appears
nightly except Monday at the
beautiful Trident, which Ls lo
cated on the water with an ex
ceptional view of the San Fran
cisco skyline. Minors are allowed
and with no cover or minimum,
it remains the most inexpensive
of Bay Area clubs.
Other Doing's
Here is a rundown of jazz per
formers in the area for the com
ing weeks: Vince Guaraldi and
Bola Sete continue at El Matador
until the opening of Cal Tjader
on the 14th, who will remain
about a month. Yusef Latif will
be followed next week at the Jazz
Workshop by pianist Les McCann.
Following Sonny Rollins, the
Jazz Crusaders will open at Basin
Street West on the 9th. Featured
on a twin bill with the Crusaders
will be Anita O'Day for 9 days,
followed by Big Mania Willie Mae
Thornton. Future weeks will see
Dizzy Gillespie, the Clara Wan!
Singers, Jimmy Smith, the Mod
ern Jazz Quartet, and possibly
Stan Kenton. Mel Tonne opens
this evening at Tin Pan Alley in
Redwood City, and will be fol
lowed by Count Basie on the
12th.

board is Errol Garnerish. Jean is
becoming a more and more seri
ous pianist, less concerned with
her singing, and I would look for
some forthcoming compositions
of her own.
With the excellent backing of
Tom Albedng on drums and Fred
Marshall on bass, Jean appears
nightly except Monday at the
beautiful Trident, which Ls lo
cated on the water with an ex
ceptional view of the San Fran
cisco skyline. Minors are allowed
and with no cover or minimum,
it remains the most inexpensive
of Bay Area clubs.
Other Doing's
Here is a rundown of jazz per
formers in the area for the com
ing weeks: Vince Guaraldi and
Bola Sete continue at El Matador
until the opening of Cal Tjader
on the 14th, who will remain
about a month. Yusef Latif will
be followed next week at the Jazz
Workshop by pianist Les McCann.
Following Sonny Rollins, the
Jazz Crusaders will open at Basin
Street West on the 9th. Featured
on a twin bill with the Crusaders
will be Anita O'Day for 9 days,
followed by Big Mania Willie Mae
Thornton. Future weeks will see
Dizzy Gillespie, the Clara Wan!
Singers, Jimmy Smith, the Mod
ern Jazz Quartet, and possibly
Stan Kenton. Mel Tonne opens
this evening at Tin Pan Alley in
Redwood City, and will be fol
lowed by Count Basie on the
12th.
Jean Hoffman's stay at the Tri
dent in Sausalito has been ex
tended through December, due to
tremendous public response. It
is a shame, however, that Jean's
fans are primarily local diehards,
and that little recognition has
been given this talented and de
serving pianist.
Jean is a classically trained
pianist who has been playing
jazz for about eight years. This
classical influence has found its
way into her construction of
ehordal bases and runs, but pri
marily it is responsible for her
unique way of building a dynamic
line.
It is this dynamic quality that
makes Jean one of the most ex
citing jazz performers I have
ever heard, and binds her fans to
her with such force. Evident most
of all on her ballads, it provides
almost a hypnotic base to which
her voice plays around t lie writ
ten line in a freer, blueish way.
Style Changing
She is not content to stay with
this approach, however, and her
style is undergoing a violent
change, feeling the influences of
other jazzmen. Bill Evans, to
whom she paid a great deal of
attention during his stay at the
Trident last summer, has obvi
ously influenced h e r ehordal
structures as well as selection of
material, and her recent high-low
work at opposite ends of the key

board is Errol Garnerish. Jean is
becoming a more and more seri
ous pianist, less concerned with
her singing, and I would look for
some forthcoming compositions
of her own.
