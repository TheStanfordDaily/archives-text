# 'Country Wife' Exhilirating
## 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
When a professional group like
the San Francisco Actor's Work
shop does something, you can be
sure that the fundamental mat
ters of the production will be well
taken care of. Therefore, what
makes the difference between a
solidly competent (the AW's
minimum standard) but utterly
boring evening, and that magical
time when delight transfixes the
audience in its collective chair, is
the little things.
It was a l eal pleasure to watch
them appear in Wycherley's "The
Country Wife" with unerring pre
cision, and to get up from a long
play exhilirated instead of ex
hausted.
Although the program notes
industriously endeavor to make
"Country Wife" the sort of acid
social satire that might be as
fitting a comment on modern
moral promiscuity as on the Res
toration's excesses, the produc
tion itself is incorrigibly an d
properly harmless fun. a jaded
burlesque of society and moral
ity during the reign of Charles 11.
Plot Half The Fun
Its plot is fully half the fun,
being about how a rake-about
town hires a Quack (synonymous
with doctor) to tell everyone that
lie's a eunuch. By this strategem
he hopes to get past suspicious
husbands and into milady's bou
doir with a minimum of unpleas
antness, there to pluck the fruit
at his leisure.
He succeeds only too well, be
ing simultaneously invited into
ten or fifteen bedrooms by
smirking husbands who tell him
to do whatever he likes. Their
wives, of course, soon find out
he's more than he's supposed to
be, or that he hasn't lost what
their husbands think he's lost, or
something.
But then they're all for that
sort of extra-curricular activity:
after all, how else can they stave
off boredom? Anyway, he and his
friends and the women and their
husbands get all tangled up, but
at the crucial moment the maid
confesses all, whereupon all ends
happily.
Excellent Cast
And, happily, the cast does
more than justice to Wycherley's
plot. Monte Markham is pretty
sneaky as the erstwhile eunuch,
although he tends to alternately
race through and strangle on his
lines. Elizabeth Huddle walks
away with the show, probably be
cause as the unaffected country
wife she is the only non-pseudo
of the lot. Her Irish-Scottish-Lan
cashire accent could stand a little
more firming-up, though. .Robert
Haswell is hilariously frantic as
the most suspicious husband in
all of London, and the rest of the
cast is uniformly excellent.
Among the little things are the
costumes, frilled and foppish be
yond belief. Another is the sets,
the ingenious little masterpieces
of William Jones, whose chang
ing not only is intended to be
funny, but actually stops the
show. And all this is under the
capable direction of Robert Sy
monds, who sees that his actors
move surely and smoothly
through a bit of seventeenth cen
tury London that everyone
should see.
