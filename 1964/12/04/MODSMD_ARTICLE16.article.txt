# Anouilh Play Entertaining
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
"Time Remembered" opens to
night in Little Theatre. And,
judging from the rehearsal I saw
Wednesday night, it should be a
pleasant evening's entertainment.
Not anything brilliant or pro
found, mind you, for this is play
wright Jean Anouilth in a play
ful mood. But it's fun and it
makes some interesting observa
tions on such typically French
topics as life and love.
Unfortunately, things get off to
a fairly slow start and the temp
tation to leave at the intermis
sion is strong. But stick around.
Each scene is better than the one
before it and in the second act
this production really hits its
stride.

This Stanford Players presen
tation is blessed with a trio of
superb leading actors. As the
slightly mad duchess "popping in
and out like a jack-in-the-box,"
Priscilla Oliver is delightful. She
is especially good in the first
scene in the park.
Donald Patterson portrays the!
melancholy young prince with an ,
appealing charm. On occasion he
I lowers his voice so much that he j
| is inaudible, but on the whole he |
I is very good and in his one "ex-'
tremely long speech" lie is out- i
I standing.
But it is Susan Leich as the!
! "adorable" young milliner Aman
ida who carries the show; her
| role is perhaps the play's most
j difficult, for she must be not only
I Amanda but Amanda pretending
! and attempting to be the ballerina
! Leocadia.
On Stage Constantly
She is on stage almost con
stantly, and with beauty, grace
and luimor she keeps the play
going through even its dullest
moments.
In the supporting cast Thomas
Bacchetti, as a very proper head
waiter, and Richard Fisch, as a
very improper innkeeper, arc mar
velous.
Judith Burgess' direction is gen-
I erallv quite good, reaching its
high points in a pair of perfectly
performed and utterly mad
scenes: one a re-enactment of
Leocadia's entrance for Amanda,
i the other a fantastically involved
! pantomime preparing a gin and
lemonade for Amanda.
Holmes Easley's scenery is
minimal but is nonetheless styl
ish and elegant. David Hudson's
costumes are quite attractive. His
first outfit for the duchess says
as much about her as a page of
description ever could. And his
gown for Miss Leich, in which
the lave n d e r trim perfectly
matches the coloring of the or
chids that she eats, is stunning.
Charles Williams' lighting is also
good.

appealing charm. On occasion he
I lowers his voice so much that he j
| is inaudible, but on the whole he |
I is very good and in his one "ex-'
tremely long speech" lie is out- i
I standing.
But it is Susan Leich as the!
! "adorable" young milliner Aman
ida who carries the show; her
| role is perhaps the play's most
j difficult, for she must be not only
I Amanda but Amanda pretending
! and attempting to be the ballerina
! Leocadia.
On Stage Constantly
She is on stage almost con
stantly, and with beauty, grace
and luimor she keeps the play
going through even its dullest
moments.
In the supporting cast Thomas
Bacchetti, as a very proper head
waiter, and Richard Fisch, as a
very improper innkeeper, arc mar
velous.
Judith Burgess' direction is gen-
I erallv quite good, reaching its
high points in a pair of perfectly
performed and utterly mad
scenes: one a re-enactment of
Leocadia's entrance for Amanda,
i the other a fantastically involved
! pantomime preparing a gin and
lemonade for Amanda.
Holmes Easley's scenery is
minimal but is nonetheless styl
ish and elegant. David Hudson's
costumes are quite attractive. His
first outfit for the duchess says
as much about her as a page of
description ever could. And his
gown for Miss Leich, in which
the lave n d e r trim perfectly
matches the coloring of the or
chids that she eats, is stunning.
Charles Williams' lighting is also
good.


LEADS—Susan Leich and Donald Patterson have leading roles in
"Time Remembered," the Jean Anouilh play opening tonight in
Little Theatre.
"Time Remembered" opens to
night in Little Theatre. And,
judging from the rehearsal I saw
Wednesday night, it should be a
pleasant evening's entertainment.
Not anything brilliant or pro
found, mind you, for this is play
wright Jean Anouilth in a play
ful mood. But it's fun and it
makes some interesting observa
tions on such typically French
topics as life and love.
Unfortunately, things get off to
a fairly slow start and the temp
tation to leave at the intermis
sion is strong. But stick around.
Each scene is better than the one
before it and in the second act
this production really hits its
stride.
Sii|M»rb Iyeads
This Stanford Players presen
tation is blessed with a trio of
superb leading actors. As the
slightly mad duchess "popping in
and out like a jack-in-the-box,"
Priscilla Oliver is delightful. She
is especially good in the first
scene in the park.
Donald Patterson portrays the!
melancholy young prince with an ,
appealing charm. On occasion he
I lowers his voice so much that he j
| is inaudible, but on the whole he |
I is very good and in his one "ex-'
tremely long speech" lie is out- i
