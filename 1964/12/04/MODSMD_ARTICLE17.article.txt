## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Sigma Chi, behind a tough de
! fense, defeated Fremont, 12-0,
J Thursday, for the Intramural
Football Championship. Sigma
Chi scored both of their touch-
I downs in the first half.
Gary Kern, Don Yore and
James Neal were the mainstays
I of the Sigma Chi defense. Fre-
I mont quarterback Bob Thomp
son never really had a chance to
; get going as time and again both
; Kern and Yore would either
j catch him behind the line or force
; him to pass prematurely.
FREMONT won the toss but
! could gain nothing and had to
; punt. The Chi's attempted a run
-1 ning play on their first down

which gained no yardage. Next I
down quarterback Paul Hazelrig 1
hit Bruce Hagenson slanting over
the middle. Hagenson kept right
on going and finally ended up on
the one-yard line. The play cov
ered 60 yards.
Hazelrig sprinted around left
end for the final yard and the
score. The extra point attempt
failed when Fremont rushers
blocked the pass.
After an exchange of punts,
Fremont had the ball deep in
their own territory. Sigrna Chi
middle-linebacker Neal inter
cepted on the 25-yard line and
returned it to the 15 before Fre
mont had a chance to gel their
offense in gear.
A personal foul on Sigma Chi
put the ball back to the 25. Hazel
rig then threw a pass over the
center which "Chan" Osborn
| latched on to at the five.
FRANK OLRK'H grabbed
I Hazelrig's next pass for si x
points. The extra point try failed
when Neal caught the pass out
of bounds.

Neal intercepted his second
pass in the initial stages of the
second half. He returned the ball
20 yards to the Fremont 30-yard
line.
Two passes fell incomplete, but
a run by Hazelrig made it a fourth
and five situation. A good play by
Fremont defender Gene Krupa
prevented the first down a n d
possibly a score. Krupa stopped
Neal, who had caught a pass, one
inch shy of a first down.
The hard rush of the Chi's pre
vented Fremont from going any
where, though, and Fremont
punted. However, John Theohar
intercepted two plays later to
give Fremont the ball just past
the midfield mark in Sigma Chi
territory.
THOMPSON tossed a long pass
to his end who was open in the
end/one, but he couldn't find the
handle to the ball and dropped
it. Fremont ran out of downs
and Sigma Chi took over.
One of the game's more spec
tacular plays came two downs
later. Hazelrig lobbed an alley
oop pass to Osborn, who was 30
yards downfield. In the midst of
three Fremont defenders Osborn
leaped up and outgrabbed the
j defenders for the ball.
With time getting scarce Fre
' mont got the ball again deep in
their own land. Some good rush
| ing held Fremont to a minus 20
| yards in three plays. On one of
| those plays Thompson lofted a
through the receiver's hands as he
pass through the receiver's hands
as he was racing into the end
zone.
Less than a minute remained
so Fremont tried a fourth down
pass. Ken Jernsted intercepted
it far downfield for Sigma Chi.

On the next play Freemont re
covered a fumble to give them
the ball on the five-yard line. But
in three plays they could not
score and the game ended 12-0 in
favor of Sigma Chi.

J Thursday, for the Intramural

Gary Kern, Don Yore and

; Kern and Yore would either
j catch him behind the line or force

FREMONT won the toss but

which gained no yardage. Next I

Fremont defender Gene Krupa
prevented the first down a n d
possibly a score. Krupa stopped
Neal, who had caught a pass, one
inch shy of a first down.
