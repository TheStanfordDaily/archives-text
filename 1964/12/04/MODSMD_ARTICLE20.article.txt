in ten attempts and two free j
throws for 20 points. Hinckley j
now is hitting a phenomenal 18

a little over two minutes left and
his team at the short end of a
57-51 count. Newell stole two;
passes for two quick buckets, J
making the score 57-55.

seconds to get all the way down
court to score.

together the first half, passing
erratically, double-dribbling, and
traveling. The only brighl spot on
the reservation besides Hinck
ley's shooting was the dribbling
of junior guard Mike Preisler.
Preisler dribbled a r o un d and
through most of the dumfounded
Spartan defense, keeping Stan
ford in the same.
THE SECOND HALF started
similarly, with San Jose jacking
their lead up to 42-34, led by the
ball-stealing antics of forward S.
T. Saffold. But the Indians roared
back with seven straight points,
to cut the Spartan lead to one.
Clay Raaka, who scored four field
goals in four attempts in the half,
put Stanford ahead 46-45, with ten
minutes left on the clock. The In
dians stayed ahead until Newell
tied it up at 59-59.
Stanford displayed balanced and
accurate shooting, with five men
scoring over five points. Center
Craig Cordes, though scoring only
one point, set up many of the In
dian baskets from the high post
and gathered in nine rebounds, to
tie .Raaka for the individual high.

ill(>II SCORERS for the Spar
tans were Safford with 13, Newell
