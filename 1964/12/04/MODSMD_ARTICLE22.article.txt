# The 						Cal Arrests
## 
### 
The jailing of almost 9tK) student demonstra
tors at Berkeley is a tragedy, both for the Uni
versity of California and for the students them
selves, a tragedy from which they are not likely
soon to recover.
If the reports of police brutality are true,
then the incident is all the more regrettable,
and, in retrospect, a show of so much force was
hardly necessary.
But the confrontation was not to be avoided.
The Free Speech Movement insisted on the
demonstrations when it presented the Berkeley
administration with a completely unreasonable
ultimatum, one which it never meant to be taken
seriously.
(riven the blatant challenge to University au
thority (final proof that the FSM was not about
to work responsibly toward reaching a satis
factory solution to the problem of illegal advo
cacy), President Kerr and Governor Brown had
no choice but to remove the students as they did.
Fortunately, the elected leadership of
the student body, as well as political groups who
have abandoned FSM because of its tactics, are

likely to reach a satisfactory agreement with the
administration, in spite of the student strike.
The FSM, let there he no mistake, has con
tributed a great deal toward bringing the issue
to the fore, especially in the first weeks in Octo
ber. Most of its original demands, in fact, have
been met.
But these demands have been met because of
rational discussion between students and ad
ministrators striving for a reasonable compro
mise, not because of intimidation. The FSM, in-
Huenced more and more by fanatics, had neither
the patience nor the desire for such negotiation,
and the organization finally resorted to Wednes
day's massive sit-in.
In the aftermath, we hope that the Berkeley
administration will not be overh harsh with most
of the student demonstrators, many of whom
were influenced by non-student professional
agitators.
Most of the students are not simply "nuts '
with a cause. Their disillusionment and bitter
ness and rebelliousness must be understood he
fore they can be corrected. It is time that the
effort be made to understand.
