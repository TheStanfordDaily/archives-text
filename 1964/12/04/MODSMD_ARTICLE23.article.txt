## San Jose Dollies NOT Ideal; 'Realist' NOT Of Low Quality

Dear Sir:

Not hardly. The average SJS
girl is ten pounds overweight, has
a pimply fare, too much make-up.

personality to match. She shows
up on campus in stretch pants or
cut off levis, and a reversed
sweatshirt (cut-off sleeves) that
appear to have been worn by the ]
losing canine in every dogfight J
since she (the average SJS girl) j
arrived on campus, or any other]
outfit consistent with the latest
fad. Beautiful and sexy? NO. I
Stupid? Probably.
At San Jose there are also not- :
so-average girls. The pleated skirt :
and bouse type, minimum make- j
up and natural hair styles. Beau-1
tiful and sexy? Apparently so. I
Stupid? Generally, yes (like a:
fox) or they wouldn't be dating
Stanford men. They are stupid
enough not to tell a date that he j
misquoted Keates twice in sue-1
cession (though positive he did).!
or to tell the dear boy how sorry
they are that his over-all GPA;
is not better than 3.22 (after in
forming him that hers is 3.97).
To Stanford junior females it
may appear that SJS girls aren't !
too smart, and then again. . . .
Where did I get my informa-1
tion? I attend San Jose State.

Dear Sir:
In a recent letter to The Daily,
the Tresidder Union Board would
have us believe that their recent
removal of The Kealist was based
entirely on the criterion of qual-1
ity, and no other. While it cer-1
tainly is reasuring to know that
the Union Board is so concerned j
in protecting us from such ma-1

, gazines as The Realist, I would
(suggest that perhaps their con
cern is not very profound. While
strolling through the Union news
-1 stand, I came upon such pearls
of quality as: Screenland and TV
Land, Hit Parader (Inside the
World of Stars), Monster World
(Collector's Edition), Web Ter
; ror Stories, Wrestling Confiden
j tial, Hot Rod, California Bride,
and Salesman's Opportunity.
The very fact that these maga
i zines are found in the newsstand
; tends to make one suspicious of
the Board's pious declaration:
j "What we do intend is to main
j tain some standard of quality in
| this matter as in all Union mat
ters." It also leads one to suspect
! that the Board may have had
[other, perhaps less noble, reasons
1 for snatching The Realist from
i the stands. One may very well
have been that it attacked the
| middle-class mythology too vio
, lently for the sensibilities of some
| influential visitor. In conclusion,
i if the magazines mentioned above
I meet the Board's criterion of
; quality, then I propose that the
Board itself be removed from cir
culation, so as not to contaminate
the rest of us with its Victorian
i concept of quality.

• Mr. Lane's Veracity
! Dear Sir:
I am informed that Mr. Mark
I Lane, in attacking my criticism
ol his position on the Warren
Commission Report (The Nation,
November 2), stated that he had
invited me to be present at his
! appearance in order to debate the
I issue with him. If this account
j of what he said is cored, I can
contribute some first-hand in
| formation on Mr. Lane's veracity.
I The fact is that I received no

notice from Mr. Lane or from
anyone acting for him that he
was to appear on this campus,
let alone that he desired to en
gage me in debate. For those in
attendance at the speech, this bit
ol information should provide a
useful commentary on Mr. Lane's
way with facts.

• 'Realist' 1 Should Slay
Dear Sir:
I disagree with the Tresidder
Union Board's judgment that
The Realist falls "below reason
able standards," whatever that
may mean, and want to see it
again on sale at Tresidder.

Dear Sir:
With regard to the masculinity
ol Stanford men certainly the
women of San Jose State. Mills
College, and 1 h e University of
California have not found any
thing to complain about.
One wonders why—if Stanford
men are willing to travel large
distances for the companionship
available on these other campus
es wc do not find a similar
flood of men from U.C. and San
Jose traveling to Stanford to par
take of the very wonderful social
opportunities which some have as
sumed exist here.
In fact, this suggests a gen
eral question: would anyone out
side of Stanford put up with what
Stanford men have been forced
to accept as one of the more dis
mal and frigid aspects of the Uni
versity's environment — the
women?

Dear Sir:
In a recent letter to The Daily,
the Tresidder Union Board would
have us believe that their recent
removal of The Kealist was based
entirely on the criterion of qual-1
ity, and no other. While it cer-1
tainly is reasuring to know that
the Union Board is so concerned j
in protecting us from such ma-1

, gazines as The Realist, I would
(suggest that perhaps their con
cern is not very profound. While
strolling through the Union news
-1 stand, I came upon such pearls
of quality as: Screenland and TV
Land, Hit Parader (Inside the
World of Stars), Monster World
(Collector's Edition), Web Ter
; ror Stories, Wrestling Confiden
j tial, Hot Rod, California Bride,
and Salesman's Opportunity.
The very fact that these maga
i zines are found in the newsstand
; tends to make one suspicious of
the Board's pious declaration:
j "What we do intend is to main
j tain some standard of quality in
| this matter as in all Union mat
ters." It also leads one to suspect
! that the Board may have had
[other, perhaps less noble, reasons
1 for snatching The Realist from
i the stands. One may very well
have been that it attacked the

i if the magazines mentioned above

Dear Sir:
In a recent letter to The Daily,
the Tresidder Union Board would
have us believe that their recent
removal of The Kealist was based
entirely on the criterion of qual-1
ity, and no other. While it cer-1
tainly is reasuring to know that
the Union Board is so concerned j
in protecting us from such ma-1

, gazines as The Realist, I would
(suggest that perhaps their con
cern is not very profound. While
strolling through the Union news
-1 stand, I came upon such pearls
of quality as: Screenland and TV
Land, Hit Parader (Inside the
World of Stars), Monster World
(Collector's Edition), Web Ter
; ror Stories, Wrestling Confiden
j tial, Hot Rod, California Bride,
and Salesman's Opportunity.
The very fact that these maga
i zines are found in the newsstand
; tends to make one suspicious of
the Board's pious declaration:
j "What we do intend is to main
j tain some standard of quality in
| this matter as in all Union mat
ters." It also leads one to suspect
! that the Board may have had
[other, perhaps less noble, reasons
1 for snatching The Realist from
i the stands. One may very well
have been that it attacked the
| middle-class mythology too vio
, lently for the sensibilities of some
| influential visitor. In conclusion,
i if the magazines mentioned above
I meet the Board's criterion of
; quality, then I propose that the
Board itself be removed from cir
culation, so as not to contaminate
the rest of us with its Victorian
i concept of quality.

• Mr. Lane's Veracity
! Dear Sir:
I am informed that Mr. Mark
I Lane, in attacking my criticism
ol his position on the Warren
Commission Report (The Nation,
November 2), stated that he had
invited me to be present at his
! appearance in order to debate the
I issue with him. If this account
j of what he said is cored, I can
contribute some first-hand in
| formation on Mr. Lane's veracity.
I The fact is that I received no

notice from Mr. Lane or from
anyone acting for him that he
was to appear on this campus,
let alone that he desired to en
gage me in debate. For those in
attendance at the speech, this bit
ol information should provide a
useful commentary on Mr. Lane's
way with facts.

• 'Realist' 1 Should Slay
Dear Sir:
I disagree with the Tresidder

The Realist falls "below reason

may mean, and want to see it
again on sale at Tresidder.

Dear Sir:
With regard to the masculinity

women of San Jose State. Mills
College, and 1 h e University of
California have not found any
thing to complain about.
One wonders why—if Stanford
men are willing to travel large
distances for the companionship
available on these other campus
es wc do not find a similar
flood of men from U.C. and San
Jose traveling to Stanford to par
take of the very wonderful social
opportunities which some have as
sumed exist here.
In fact, this suggests a gen
eral question: would anyone out
side of Stanford put up with what
Stanford men have been forced
to accept as one of the more dis
mal and frigid aspects of the Uni
versity's environment — the
women?
