## Cheever's Stories Indict Hollow American Values 
### Al Heineman 
The various worlds created by John Cheever in his short
stories are deceptively familiar. The settings — suburban \ew
York, Cape Cod, Home — are usual enough, and the reader feels
momentarily at home — until he discovers that they are really
populated by the heroes of Greek myth in grey flannel suits, by

witches, or by shells masquerad-"
ing as people.
Cheever's characters are pecu
liarly "his," in the same way that
the creations of Salinger, Roth
and Bellow are I heir part icular
brands of people, with the prin
cipal difference being that Chee
ver's people are rarely New York
Jews, ihe chief stock in trade of
the others mentioned.
C'nfied Theme
Cheever's latest collection of 1(5
stories. The Brigadier and the
Golf Widow, contains seemingly
disparate points of view, differ
ent messages and echoes. Closer
examination, (hough, reveals that
the hi pieces are part of a sur
prisingly unified fabric, a cra/.y
quilt eo.: ation c.ilbeit occa
sionally g • ,o ' of i'je constrict- •
i:i { and < »n castr. ing forces
of rnoieri American society.
Which is not, of course, to inti
mate that Cheever is a sardonic,
embittered writer hurling brick- j
bats willy-nilly at his circum
stances and environment; he sees
hope for the rebel, if he can will
ingly transcend the stifling, steril
izing pressures directed toward
him by a society controlled by a
hollow and materialistic values
system.
Personality Disintegration
These alien forces are personi
fied in a number of ways. In one j
story, a man mistakes his wife!
for her mother, whom they both j
hate, when he sees her sitting i
alone in the dark. She subse
quently lets him see her putter
ing around with poisons while
she is cooking; although she
never tries to poison him, thei
threat drives him slowly mad. He
is driven to seek help from his!
daughter, who rejects him fori
what he terms a "sexual freak" |
with whom she has been living, j
And he has been fired by a firm
he helped to build. Presto. Instant
disintegration of a personality.!
And, in "An Educated Ameri-;
can Woman," Cheever creates j
what must lie, for any masculine
reader, the most effectively chill-!
ing incarnation of what Leslie)
Fiedler calls the "American cas-j
trator-bitch" in recent fiction.
The hero, a nice guy type, is
so neglected by his ultra-efficent, j
superbly frigid wife that he is
forced into a meaningless affair.;
When he confesses his infidelity,!
she laughs and refuses to believe
him. accusing him of unimagina-!
tive fabrication. Robbed thus of
any vestige of virility, and grieved
by the death of their son. caused
partially by his wife's neglect, he J
goes slowly to pieces.
The protagonist of "The Swim
mer" decides one afternoon while j
at a party to return the eight
miles to his home by way of each ,
intervening swimming pool. As
dusk begins to fall, and as the
task becomes harder with every 1
new pool, strange things happen: I
he is snubbed by a couple ter
ribly inferior to him socially,
friends make veiled references
to some personal tragedy in his
life of which he is ignorant, and
to other events which he cannot
recall. He is forced to cross a
main highway, and passers-by in

♦
'speeding cars ridicule his state
of virtual undress, and throw beer
j cans at him.
When he finally reaches hi s
home, he finds it in total decay,
and vacant all the things which
he had heard whispered about
him during his trek upstream
have come t rue. He has breached
a gap in time to discover eata
st rophe.
A Grim Plot, Indeed
The plot resembles a Twilight
Zone episode, but Cheever's vi
sion of a cross-country swim
through the fluoride artificiality
of pools as ihe only kind of ex
ploit a modern would-be hero may
undertake is a grim one indeed.
The book is heavy going. Its
parade of unfulfilled wanderers,
seekers, lost souls, and the au
thor's keen eye for the hollow
status symbols of our culture
are depressing. And, naturally,
when one of his observations hits
I close to homei which thev are
likely to do often, and maybe
especially on this campus), the
easy response is, "The hell you
say. That's not the way it is."
Greek Heroes . . . Today
But his portraits of lustration
are indeed accurate. In the story
which perhaps best capsulites his
vision of America, called "Meta
morphoses," Greek mythological
I heroes, Actaeon, Orpheus and
others, are transposed into mod
ern settings, and divested of
! their grandeur. Actaeon is mis
taken for a delivery man and
torn to pieces by dogs he had
bred; Orpheus sings TV commer
cials; everything Midas touches
j turns to cigarettes . . . you get
i the idea.
He does a fine .job with t he
j cleaver on the common, garden
j variety man, too. A country club's
locker room demagogue rants,
"Bomb Cuba! Bomb Berlin! Let's
• throw a little nuclear hardware
|at them and show them who's
| boss."
A lethargic Lothario finds that
■ the key to seducing a hitherto un
' approachable married woman is
; merely to tell her she is intelli
j gent.
One Obsessive Vision
Space does not permit further
i excerpting from Cheever's mas
terful and detailed canvasses. If
i the book has a limitation, it is
1 that his subject, in spite of the
j apparent variety of the 16 stories,
is limited to this one obsessive vi
sion. One can. certainly, tire of it.
tire of being exposed to displaced
Greeks and paper-machc subur
banites.
But it is leavened with a bright,
if usually ironic, sense of humor,
j The prose is unimpeachable,
j And if you can stoop down
| enough to get through the little
door leading to John Cheever's
private world, you're in for a
worthwhile literary experience.
I If it is not a provoking experience
as well, you didn't get down low
enough. Or get up high enough,
as tlie case may be.
