# Secret Dealings In FSM: Suppression, Feuds, Theft
## 
### 
JOHN K. HO.MM;
Contributing Editor
Suppression of minority reports, pilfering of files, and secret
meetings with Clark kerr are several of the heretofore undis
closed aspects ol the "I'ree Speech Movement which have been
revealed on the heels of this week's sit-in demonstration at the
University of California.

According to students involved
in the turmoil at Cal, no minority
reports were allowed 10 he issued
from FSM Steering Committee
meetings and the meetings were
secret. The decisions which came
out were always presented as the
voice of the entire Steering Com
mittee. Neither were there ever
any reports of the dissenting
opinions expressed in the meet
ings.
File Seizure
The pilfering of FSM files came
in early November when it was
felt negotiations with tho Uni
versity were not going fast
enough.
At that time, the Steering Com
mittee decided to set up their
illegal tables again, although
some members of the Steering
Committee disagreed and wanted
to call a meeting of the full Exec
utive Committee to debate the
proposed action. (The 12-member
Steering Committee is theoretic
ally responsible to the Executive
Committee, which consists of
representatives of all the groups
in FSM.)
However, some of the students
lepresenting the majority view
seized the files containing the
mimes and addresses of the Exec
utive Committee members, mak
ing it impossible for the "mod
erates" to call a meeting. Shortly
thereafter, on November 9 the
public demonstrations were re
sumed. despite the October 2
pledge that no such tactics would
lie employed. In response, Uni
versity President Clark Kerr dis
solved the Student-Faculty Com
mittee which was conducting the
negotiations.
Art Goldberg, one of the four
students suspended from Cal as
a result of the October 1 demon
stration. resigned from the FSM
Steering Committee in protest of
the file seizure. SLATE, a liberal
political action group at Cal, of
which Goldberg was immediate
past chairman, almost pulled out
of FSM as a result of the situa
tion.
By the end of the week, how
ever, things had been pacified and
Goldberg was back on the Steer
ing Committee along with two
new members.
"The facade remained un
marred, but feelings were run
ning very high inside and FSM
was close to splitting up," a stu
dent reported.

Meanwhile, secret meetings with
Clark Kerr were held by dissident
FSM groups.
Since October, these organiza
tions had been unhappy with
what they called the "dictorial
leadership and the tactics."
They initiated negotiations
vately with Kerr and A 1 Bolten,
vice president of the UC Board of
Regents. Rumors of such meet
lings circulated within FSM, but
I they have been a well-kept secret
j until now. One of the student par
ticipants revealed the private no
jgotiations to the Editor of the
Daily and myself several weeks
ago, but did not authorize publica
tion until yesterday.
The secret meetings with Kerr
prompted the formulation and
public release of the "Faculty
Report" in early November, now
endorsed by Chancellor Edward
Strong, and approved by most
student groups.
Conservatives, Socialists
The students meeting with Kerr
included officers of liberal con
servative, and socialist groups.
Warren Coates, president of the
, University Young Republicans,
said yesterday,"The earlier ne
gotiations showed that the ave
nues of communication were open
with the administration and the
: private meetings were neces
sitated by FSM's lack of desire
i to use such avenues."
Other oddities and ancedot.es
just come to iighl include:
• A graduate student group
which tried to form its own pro
test movement outside of FSM
, had its meeting broken up by
I FSM functionaries who would
not let Ihe speakers be heard. Sub
sequently. FSM set up its own
' graduate group.
• A group of liberal Republi
cans at Cal, calling themselves
the California College Republi
cans. became tired of the endless
! meetings within FSM and as
signed their delegateship to a self
proclaimed Trotskyite as th e
representative of their organiza
tion.
• The initial election of the
steering committee produced re
sults "so far left wing that even
the Young Democrats and Young
Peoples' Socialist League were
upset." Moderates and conserva
tives were not not ified of th e
election meeting .although they
were listed as FSM members in
'public statements.

secret. The decisions which came
out were always presented as the
voice of the entire Steering Com
mittee. Neither were there ever
any reports of the dissenting
opinions expressed in the meet
ings.
File Seizure
The pilfering of FSM files came
in early November when it was
felt negotiations with tho Uni
versity were not going fast
enough.
At that time, the Steering Com
mittee decided to set up their
illegal tables again, although
some members of the Steering
Committee disagreed and wanted
to call a meeting of the full Exec
utive Committee to debate the
proposed action. (The 12-member
Steering Committee is theoretic
ally responsible to the Executive
Committee, which consists of
representatives of all the groups
in FSM.)
However, some of the students
lepresenting the majority view
seized the files containing the
mimes and addresses of the Exec
utive Committee members, mak
ing it impossible for the "mod
erates" to call a meeting. Shortly
thereafter, on November 9 the
public demonstrations were re
sumed. despite the October 2
pledge that no such tactics would
lie employed. In response, Uni
versity President Clark Kerr dis
solved the Student-Faculty Com
mittee which was conducting the
negotiations.
Art Goldberg, one of the four
students suspended from Cal as
a result of the October 1 demon
stration. resigned from the FSM
Steering Committee in protest of
the file seizure. SLATE, a liberal
political action group at Cal, of
which Goldberg was immediate
past chairman, almost pulled out
of FSM as a result of the situa
tion.
By the end of the week, how
ever, things had been pacified and
Goldberg was back on the Steer
ing Committee along with two
new members.
"The facade remained un
marred, but feelings were run
ning very high inside and FSM
was close to splitting up," a stu
dent reported.

Meanwhile, secret meetings with
Clark Kerr were held by dissident
FSM groups.
Since October, these organiza
tions had been unhappy with
what they called the "dictorial
leadership and the tactics."
They initiated negotiations
vately with Kerr and A 1 Bolten,
vice president of the UC Board of
Regents. Rumors of such meet
lings circulated within FSM, but
I they have been a well-kept secret
j until now. One of the student par
ticipants revealed the private no
jgotiations to the Editor of the
Daily and myself several weeks
ago, but did not authorize publica
tion until yesterday.
The secret meetings with Kerr
prompted the formulation and
public release of the "Faculty
Report" in early November, now
endorsed by Chancellor Edward
Strong, and approved by most
student groups.
Conservatives, Socialists
The students meeting with Kerr
included officers of liberal con
servative, and socialist groups.
Warren Coates, president of the
, University Young Republicans,
said yesterday,"The earlier ne
gotiations showed that the ave
nues of communication were open
with the administration and the
: private meetings were neces
sitated by FSM's lack of desire
i to use such avenues."
Other oddities and ancedot.es
just come to iighl include:
• A graduate student group
which tried to form its own pro
test movement outside of FSM
, had its meeting broken up by
I FSM functionaries who would
not let Ihe speakers be heard. Sub
sequently. FSM set up its own
' graduate group.
• A group of liberal Republi
cans at Cal, calling themselves
the California College Republi
cans. became tired of the endless
! meetings within FSM and as
signed their delegateship to a self
proclaimed Trotskyite as th e
representative of their organiza

• The initial election of the
steering committee produced re

to call a meeting of the full Exec
utive Committee to debate the
proposed action. (The 12-member
Steering Committee is theoretic
ally responsible to the Executive
Committee, which consists of
representatives of all the groups
in FSM.)
However, some of the students
lepresenting the majority view
seized the files containing the
mimes and addresses of the Exec
utive Committee members, mak
ing it impossible for the "mod
erates" to call a meeting. Shortly
thereafter, on November 9 the
public demonstrations were re
sumed. despite the October 2
pledge that no such tactics would
lie employed. In response, Uni
versity President Clark Kerr dis
solved the Student-Faculty Com
mittee which was conducting the
negotiations.
Art Goldberg, one of the four
students suspended from Cal as
a result of the October 1 demon
stration. resigned from the FSM
Steering Committee in protest of
the file seizure. SLATE, a liberal
political action group at Cal, of
which Goldberg was immediate
past chairman, almost pulled out
of FSM as a result of the situa
tion.
By the end of the week, how
ever, things had been pacified and
Goldberg was back on the Steer
ing Committee along with two
new members.
"The facade remained un
marred, but feelings were run
ning very high inside and FSM
was close to splitting up," a stu
dent reported.

Meanwhile, secret meetings with
Clark Kerr were held by dissident
FSM groups.
Since October, these organiza
tions had been unhappy with
what they called the "dictorial
leadership and the tactics."
They initiated negotiations
vately with Kerr and A 1 Bolten,
vice president of the UC Board of
Regents. Rumors of such meet
lings circulated within FSM, but
I they have been a well-kept secret
j until now. One of the student par
ticipants revealed the private no
jgotiations to the Editor of the
Daily and myself several weeks
ago, but did not authorize publica
tion until yesterday.
The secret meetings with Kerr
prompted the formulation and
public release of the "Faculty
Report" in early November, now
endorsed by Chancellor Edward
Strong, and approved by most
student groups.
Conservatives, Socialists
The students meeting with Kerr
included officers of liberal con
servative, and socialist groups.
Warren Coates, president of the
, University Young Republicans,
said yesterday,"The earlier ne
gotiations showed that the ave
nues of communication were open
with the administration and the
: private meetings were neces
sitated by FSM's lack of desire
i to use such avenues."
Other oddities and ancedot.es
just come to iighl include:
• A graduate student group
which tried to form its own pro
test movement outside of FSM
, had its meeting broken up by
I FSM functionaries who would
not let Ihe speakers be heard. Sub
sequently. FSM set up its own
' graduate group.
• A group of liberal Republi
cans at Cal, calling themselves
the California College Republi
cans. became tired of the endless
! meetings within FSM and as
signed their delegateship to a self
proclaimed Trotskyite as th e
representative of their organiza
tion.
• The initial election of the
steering committee produced re
sults "so far left wing that even
the Young Democrats and Young
Peoples' Socialist League were
upset." Moderates and conserva
tives were not not ified of th e
election meeting .although they
were listed as FSM members in
'public statements.
