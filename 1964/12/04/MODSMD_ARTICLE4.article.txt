# 'CHAPPIE' REVIEW
## Back To Normal—To Bad 
### BOB BJORING 
The second edition of Chaparral
for fall quarter this year proves
that too much Chappie, like too
; much conversation after mid-
I night, starts out rather humor
i ously, turns suddenly to beauti
j ful girls, and then ends inevitably
! in filth.
IF VOL' HEAI) carefully you
• can find some good things like
; you can even in an Elvis movie—
; but you have to work at it.
; For example, the article called
j "Our Beautiful Campus" is clev
er. Obvious, yes, but also clever,
i Steve Dobbs' column supplying
j some rather unique solutions to
world problems is not only amus
ing, but shows that the Chappie
, thinks foreign affairs are not
limited strictly to Brigitte Bardot
movies.
There is a lecherous Santa
j Clans a must for any Christmas
I humor magazine. There is also a
j Negro Santa Claus. And there
i are also funny references to
Hoover Tower and Mem Claw, It's
| too bad that Ram's Head, the
I student body, and most of what's
' left over scooped these ... a
while ago, anyhow.
A BRIEF CARTOON section is
included in which the true mean
ing of "Hair Pie" is finally re
pealed to a breathless Stanford
i community. Of ten cartoons, only

three feature a bearded mathe
matical symbol, and only two a
baker by the name of Harold.
The other five are sort of funny.
The strange black lines arc
awarded the intellectuals for yet
a second time; presumably on the
assumption that people may "get
'em" if they see "more of 'em."
Fortunately, the Old Boy has
come up with another cute queen.
She is followed by the Hair Pie
spread and by a startling expose
on a girl and boy who suck their
thumbs, and each other's thumbs
and since the editor leaves them
in the Quad islands while doing
it we can't lie sure what else.
IF YOU CAN make it past
these gastronomic-ally inhibiting

pages, the rest is clear sailing.
The little jokes are good, the big
jokes are better, and the mock
advertisement on the last page
is best.
There is even a Christmas
Catalogue, and this is the best
thing in the magazine, because of
9 items, only one has managed
to be gross. And that is a pretty
good average for this Chappie.
A letter to the editor would
have us believe that the Chappie
is elbowing in on art (which be
longs to Sequoia, of course), but
on careful reading, one is relieved
to find that it is really only dirty.
But it takes a strong stomach
and a weak mind to enjoy this
issue.
