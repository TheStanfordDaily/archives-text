The Fall Sequoia sold cop
ies in two clays for the first soil
out for the magazine in about four
years.
Business Manager Douglas
Aaron s said, "Hooray." Editor
Charlotte Low said the staff t'olt
"ecstatic." The Editor believed
some of the reasons for the suc
cess included advertizing, faculty
support, Nancy Stcffen's "closer
and challenging" Daily review,
and a "unique, eye-catching"
cover.
Miss Low added that the staff
now felt that they "belonged to
the upper middle class, not the
poor, downtrodden intellectuals."
