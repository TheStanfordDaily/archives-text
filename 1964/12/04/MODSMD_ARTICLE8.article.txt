# Police Arrest 750 Student Protesters At Berkeley Sit-In
## Gov. Brown Asks Jailing 
### JON ROISE 
Between 750 and SOO defiant
demonstrators were forcibly re
moved from Sprout Hall and
arrested at the University of
California yesterday after stag
ing an all-night sit-in in defiance
of the Berkeley administration.
The arrests began after Gov.
Edmund G. Brown acted to break
the two-month-old student rebel
lion by ordering that the hall be
cleared of all demonstrators, most
of whom were members of the
Free Speech Movement. "As long
as I am governor there will Ik* no
anarchy, and that is what has de
veloped at the University of Cali
fornia," declared Brown in Sacra
mento.
MORK THAN <W0 policemen
from the surrounding area car
ried and dragged the students
from the hall.
Among those arrested were
Mario Savio and Arthur Goldberg,
leaders of the FSM. Late last
night Savio refused release on
bail and is being held in solitary
confinement.
After the mass arrest, believed
to lie the largest in the history of
the state, a noon-hour rally was
held in the plaza in front of
Sproul Hall. A crowd estimated at
5,000 listened to FSM leaders call
for a general sympathy strike by
students and teachers. The plea,
however, was met with only
limited response.
Tin: POSSIBILITY of violence
increased when Charlie Powell,
president of the Associated Stu
dents of the University of Cali
fornia. attempted to hold an anti-
FSM rally across the plaza from
the FSM-supported gathering.
When Powell attempted to
speak, he was unable to make
himself heard over the jeers of
the crowd. He finally directed that
♦he ASUC rally be moved to a
more distant location.
Speaking on the "free speech"
eontrovery. Powell said, "What is
at issue here is the means by
which the desired ends will be
achieved. We agree on ends. The
controversy will be decided by
the means. It will not be decided
in front of Sproul Hall.
"WHAT TIIK Asrc is trying
to advocate is an alternative to
the force and violence we've seen
here today."
An FSM leader stated that the
group's methods had been used to
counter student apathy.
The arrested demonstrators are
being held on three charges:
• Failure to disperse or unlaw
lul assembly (Bail $751.
• Failure to leave a public
building upon closing (Bail $75>.
• Resisting arrest (Bail $100*.
AS OF I-ATIO last night, the
FSM reported that it had raised
close to $15,000 toward paying
bail for the arrested students.
When the mass siege of Sproul
Hall ended last night, President
Kerr declared: "Their demands
for anarchy weir rejected be
cause freedom can exist only
within a rule of law.
