## 
### JOHN E. BONINE Contributing Editor 
Warren Coatcs, president of the 1
University of California Young :
Republicans, announced Wednes
day ho was pulling out of the
Free Speech Movement because
"the sit-in demonstrated clearly
that FSM is more interested in
disrupting the college atmosphere
than in acquiring a legitimate so
lution 1o the political activities
controversy."
This evidently spelled deteriora
tion of any claim to wide-based
support among Cal's widely-diver
gent political groups. The liberal
California College Republicans
also withdrew, leaving the Young
Democrats virtualy the most con
servative group within FSM.
KAKLY IN October, 1 h e Cal
YR's officially pulled out of FSM.
although some others including
Coatcs rejoined the group due
to pleas from Young Democrats
that Republicans and moderates
should come back in to temper
the more extreme elements of
the FSM.
Paul Cahill, a member of the
YR's at Cal and state legal coun
sel for the California YR College
Federation, signed the October 2
pact with the University, as did
FSM leaders:
"It became quiekh apparent
I hi 'i ( flll'l 11/>r !!«..» ill' 11 If » CTI 1 1 ' 1< ' 1 i. -

was being considered. We lold the
executive committee that we
could not continue to participate
under those conditions. When
they refused to disavow such tae
i lies we pulled out." This was
I early in October.
