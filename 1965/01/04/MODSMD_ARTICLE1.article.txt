# Faculty Taken Lead in Solving Berkeley Dilemma
## 
### JON ROISE International Editor 
Tlic Free Speech Movement at the Univer
sity of California, having apparently en me to
the conclusion over I lie Christmas holidays
that negotiations are less effective than demon
strations, will return to its old tactics with a
rally in front «>1 Sproul Hall at noon today.
The demonstration follows a Board of Re
gents decision Saturday to relieve Edward \Y.
Strong of his duties as chancellor of the Uni
versity of California's Berkeley campus. The
Regents announced that Strong would he given
a leave of absence at his own request "to re
cuperate from a recent illness." Strong has a
gall-bladder ailment.
lIM WAS replaced immediately by Martin
Meyerson, 12, who was named acting chan
cellor. Meyerson for the past year has been
dean of the College of Environmental Design
at Berkeley.
The rally today is being held, an FSM mem
ber told The Daily Saturday, "In order to
effectively communicate with our very sub
stantial and increasing constituency on cam
pus."
In contrast to its content, the tone and em
phasis of his statement were symptomatic of

the major problem that is now confront in.l;
the FSM's drive for "free speech" on the Ber
keley campus: student desire to end the "free
speech" debate and return the institution t<,
its educational purpose.
SIX 1<; TIIK IHCC'K.MIIEK « meeting of tin
Academic Senate, at which the t '.C. faculty in
effect embraced the FSM platform, student*
lending their sympathy and support to tlx
cause have begun to look toward the mon
reputable faculty for leadership, with there
suit that the FSM's grip on student opinion
is loosening.
Before the Sproul Hall sit-in and mass ar
rest of 78") demonstrators December 3, tlit
position of the Berkeley faculty in relation t<
the students was that of a silent and, when
necessary, tolerant sympathizer. As teacher*
at President Clark Kerr's multiversity, manj
felt, as do the students, that Berkeley is sim
ply too big a "knowledge factory" (to list
Kerr's phrase* to provide a humanistic col
lege education.
W ITH I,K( TUld'i classes of more than SOU
students, with graduate-student teaching as
sistants carrying a large part of the under
graduate instruction load, and with a deleteri
ous emphasis on academic and scientific re
search ("They hire you to teach, and then
won't let you," one professor complained», the

faculty, like the students, are easily alienated
by the University's impersonality.
The mass arrests of December 3 finally gave
the faculty a clear-cut issue on which to make
a stand. The 821-115 vote of the Academic
Senate a few days later not unexpectedly
went far beyond all administration proposals
for campus peace. At this point the FSM and
the faculty had approached near-perfect bar
mony, at least on the level of principle.
TIIK FACULTY'S PLAN, however, could
not become official policy without the ap
proval of the University's Board of Regents.
Meeting in Los Angeles December 17 and 18,
the Board rejected the proposal that a com
mittee of professors be created to pass judg
ment in student disciplinary cases. Thus, the
Board refused to consent to a switch in dis
ciplinary control from the administration to
the faculty.
According to "the FSM, such a move has
historical precedent, as disciplinary control
rested with the faculty until the 1930'5, when
it was voluntarily yielded to the administra
tion after all religious and political activity on
the U.C. campus had been temporarily banned
by then President Robert Gordon Sproul.
ON TIIK ISSI'K of political protests, the
Board named a seven-man committee to ox
amine University policy and report next spring

with "the intent ol providing maximum free
dom," including free speech and the right to
due process ;ts guaranteed in the Constitu
tion.
The instructions given to the committee in
vestigating the Berkeley regulations indicate
that the Board intends, in due time, to grant
to the students the essence of their demands.
AN KMKI{(iMN( V executive committee of
the Academic Senate issued a report December
30 saying that the regents had granted much
of what the Academic Senate asked for, prin
cipally, no restrictions on the content of
speech on campus.
The report said that some issues still re
mained in dispute, but that the conflict gen
erally seemed near settlement.
The executive committee also submitted a
live-point program to effect a permanent truce
among the students, the administration, and
the regents.
BRIEFLY. THE committee requested:
• That ;m open discussion area with sound
amplification be constructed for the use of
student s.
e That the 72-hour advance notice for off
campus speakers be reduced to 18 hours.
• That student organizations be permitted
to have tables for signing up recruits for poli
tical causes at certain locations.

• Dial future disciplinary measures in the
area of political activity be determined fo> a
committee appointed by and responsible t"
the Academic Senate.
• I hat the four points lx> adopted "to re
turn the university to its normal function."
The emergency committee submitted the
proposals Wednesday to the seven-man in
vestigative group appointed In the Board of
Regents. A joint statement issued by the two
groups said that the regents would have i<»
study the matter further, but that "we are
confident that as of January 1, workable pro
cedures will he in effect. . . ."
REOKNTS \\T!RK further quoted as sa\
ing, "There are broad areas of substantial
agreement" with the faculty proposals, addin."
that final authority "will remain with the re
gents."
At the same time, the faculty's Committee
on Academic Freedom submitted a plan for
provisional regulations to govern ihc school
when students return from the holidays.
The committee, headed by Prof. Joseph Oar
barino of the Department of Business Admin
istration, will ask tho Academic Senate's ap
proval of its six-point program when tho latter
