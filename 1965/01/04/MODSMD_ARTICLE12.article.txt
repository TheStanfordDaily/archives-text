## 
### JOHN E. BONINE Contributing: Editor 
YREKA—Numerous carloads of Stanford students were among
the 2,5(X) travelers stranded Saturday night and Sunday morn
ing in this Northern California town by a blizzard which closed
U.S. 99 for J2 hours down to Red Bluff.
Emergency centers were set up to lodge the refugees at such

places as the Veteran's Hall and*
Siskoyou Art Gallery, but at least
one group of Stanford men and
Mills College women drove up
into the residential section of
town and asked private home
owners to put them up for the
night.
THE MEN found lodging with
j a San Jose State coed and her
j family.
Six inches or more of snow
blanketed the area during the
night in a storm which made
havoc of disaster relief operations
still being carried on in the wake
of last week's floods.
Although chains were required
1 and listed as "mandatory" on both
Siskoyou Summit and newly-re
opened U.S. 99, some motorists
including the Stanford men —
made it through without them.
It is estimated that up to 60
members of the Stanford commu
nity may have been caught in
the blizzard returning from
Christmas vacation in Washing
ton and Oregon. 638 Stanford stu-!
rlents live in the two states.
