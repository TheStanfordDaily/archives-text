# Death Of A Gleep
## 
### 
Joe Gleeps is dead.
Killed by a budget, so the Stanford Bank informs us.
It wasn't that he was unpopular, understand, for the bank
itself allows he was swamped with mail.
Just that his fans were freer with their letters than their
accounts, and poor Joe simply couldn't make enough to pay
his own way.
All he left behind was a little pile of notes.
We've printed them here as a final memorial.
