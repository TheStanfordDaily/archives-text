# STANFORD FIRST CHOICE
## 
### 
In a national survey of more
than 10.0LH) semi-finalists in the
National Merit Scholarship quali
fying test. Stanford ranked first
among women and third among
ment as a college choice.
SPECIFICALLY, the commit
tee recommended:
• That student organizations
limit membership to students, fac
ulty, and employees.
• That a 48-hour notification
period be established for the pre
sentation of off-campus speakers.
The sponsoring organization may
be required to arrange for a mem
ber of the Berkeley faculty to
chair the meeting.

• That open discussion areas |
consistent with the orderly flow
of traffic be designated.
• That six separate campus 10-1
cations be established for the dis
tribution of all forms of non-com- :
mercial literature by properly!
identified student organizations. I
• That tables lie established at
designated locations on a first
come, first-serve basis with the;
permission of the Associated Stu
dents.
• That the Student Affairs i
Committee in consultation with
the Academic Senate be given re
sponsibility for interpreting the
rules.
Many campus observers s a w
the committee's report as an ef
fort to forestall new student
demonstrations when classes re
sume today.
ON THURSDAY Chancellor!
Strong provisionally accepted all
the recommendations proposed by
the Committee on Academic Free
dom, including temporary use of
the Sproul Hall steps for student
meetings until such time as a
"free speech" area is constructed.
After Strong voiced his agree
ment with the provisional regu
lations, Tom Irwin, press secre
tary for the FSM, announced that
his organization was "not pleased"
with the recommendations of the j
Committee on Academic Freedom. 1
"The agreements themselves)
are not everything we would!
like," he said. "They are unclear j
in many areas and still contain
many repressive aspects."
IRWIN LISTED a few of the
FSM's objections to the proposals, j
"We will not pay for police pro- ;
tection at our meetings," he said,
in reference to one proposal that
would require police to be present
at any meeting where money is
collected.
"We will not have our functions
contingent upon finding faculty
advisors.
"And we will not be stiffled by
being required to give several j
days prior notice for political ae
tion.
"THE UPSHOT OF it is we will |
not ask the university for permis- j
sion to hear anyone speak," he I
concluded. "It is not their peroga- |
tive to grant free siieech."
As classes resume tomorrow, 1
FSM, by refusing to accept any- j
thing less than the proposals of]
December 8, has in effect aban- j
doned much of the support it once |
had from the faculty. Students, j
with finals week approaching, ap- j
pear more ready to consider t ho j
suggestions of a liberal faculty
than to accept the demands of a ,
student organization that is be
coming more and more radical as ,
it refuses to consider any form j
of compromise. j

Strong provisionally accepted all
the recommendations proposed by
the Committee on Academic Free
dom, including temporary use of
the Sproul Hall steps for student
meetings until such time as a
"free speech" area is constructed.
After Strong voiced his agree
ment with the provisional regu
lations, Tom Irwin, press secre
tary for the FSM, announced that
his organization was "not pleased"
with the recommendations of the j
Committee on Academic Freedom. 1
"The agreements themselves)
are not everything we would!
like," he said. "They are unclear j
in many areas and still contain
many repressive aspects."
IRWIN LISTED a few of the
FSM's objections to the proposals, j
"We will not pay for police pro- ;
tection at our meetings," he said,
in reference to one proposal that
would require police to be present
at any meeting where money is
collected.
"We will not have our functions
contingent upon finding faculty
advisors.
"And we will not be stiffled by
being required to give several j
days prior notice for political ae
tion.
"THE UPSHOT OF it is we will |
not ask the university for permis- j
sion to hear anyone speak," he I
concluded. "It is not their peroga- |
tive to grant free siieech."

pear more ready to consider t ho j
suggestions of a liberal faculty

student organization that is be
coming more and more radical as ,
it refuses to consider any form j
of compromise. j
