# Prof Calls Undergrad Teaching 'Gratifying'
## 
### 
"Teaching undergraduates is
gratifying and by no moans
easy," says Stanford Nobel lame
ale Felix Bloch, the physicist.
"II means putting complex ideas
into their very simplest form
Sometimes this forces one to clar
ify his own ideas — not. a bad
thing."
I)lf. BLOCH, co-winner of the
{ Nobel Prize in Physics for his
work in nuclear magnetism,
! speaks from 14 years experience
! of teaching at least one introduc
tory course for students majoring
in physics at Stanford.
A vigorous advocate of revers
ing the general academic practice
which excuses top-ranking schol
ars and scientists from teaching
1 beginners, Prof. Bloch explained

his reasons in a campus inter
view.
Introductory courses taught by
ranking scientists are becoming a
tradition in the Stanford Physics
Department, according to Bloch.
The practice goes back at least
as far as David Locke Webster
in the '20's and Paul Harmon
Kirkpatrick a decade later.
"YOU MIGHT almost say that
in this department one has to
make the grade before lie is al
lowed to teach undergraduate
courses," lie said with a smile.
Dr. Bloch remembers grate
fully his own student days in his
native Switzerland, when, after
first thinking of becoming an
engineer, he look introductory
physics under the great Dutch
physicist Peter Debye.
"IT WAS THE one course that
really made a difference," he said.
"It helped me find my way.
"One can do that for students
sometimes — help them feel the
vitality and beauty of a field. The
good student can sense what is
going on in the soul of a man . . .
For the really gifted, routine
teaching will not do much good.
They are not always easy to
teach; often they are even unsure
of themselves."

! Prof. Bloch thinks these few
really gifted students who may be
getting their initiation into a sub
ject are of primary importance.
Their foundation in the field is
whal matters most; later on they
can read on their own and learn
much even if the teaching m a y
not be outstanding.
"LET NOBODY say it is a waste
to put so much effort into a few,"
he said. "It is the few who count."
Dr. Bloch currently takes about
10 hours a week away from his
own work to teach a course in
thermodynamics to a class of 80
students half of them under-
I graduate physics majors. He ad
mits there are times when he
feels little like facing that class.
Questions can be stupid and "it's
wearing."
"But one should not underesti
mate these young people," he said.
"They catch on. They sense that
science is life."
"Their whole approach is dif
ferent," he said. "Their originality
soon shows; it is not just compre
hension. It is easy to spot them, if
not to teach them. It' we do for
these the best we can, we are do
ing well."

"LET NOBODY say it is a waste
to put so much effort into a few,"
he said. "It is the few who count."
Dr. Bloch currently takes about
10 hours a week away from his
own work to teach a course in
thermodynamics to a class of 80
students half of them under-
I graduate physics majors. He ad
mits there are times when he
feels little like facing that class.
Questions can be stupid and "it's

"But one should not underesti
mate these young people," he said.
"They catch on. They sense that
science is life."
"Their whole approach is dif
ferent," he said. "Their originality
soon shows; it is not just compre
hension. It is easy to spot them, if
not to teach them. It' we do for
these the best we can, we are do
ing well."
"Teaching undergraduates is
gratifying and by no moans
easy," says Stanford Nobel lame
ale Felix Bloch, the physicist.
"II means putting complex ideas
into their very simplest form
Sometimes this forces one to clar

thing."
I)lf. BLOCH, co-winner of the
{ Nobel Prize in Physics for his
work in nuclear magnetism,
! speaks from 14 years experience
! of teaching at least one introduc
tory course for students majoring
in physics at Stanford.
A vigorous advocate of revers
ing the general academic practice
which excuses top-ranking schol
ars and scientists from teaching
1 beginners, Prof. Bloch explained

his reasons in a campus inter
view.
Introductory courses taught by
ranking scientists are becoming a
tradition in the Stanford Physics
Department, according to Bloch.
The practice goes back at least
as far as David Locke Webster
in the '20's and Paul Harmon
Kirkpatrick a decade later.
"YOU MIGHT almost say that
in this department one has to
make the grade before lie is al
lowed to teach undergraduate
courses," lie said with a smile.
Dr. Bloch remembers grate
fully his own student days in his
native Switzerland, when, after
first thinking of becoming an
engineer, he look introductory
physics under the great Dutch
physicist Peter Debye.
"IT WAS THE one course that
really made a difference," he said.
"It helped me find my way.
"One can do that for students
sometimes — help them feel the
vitality and beauty of a field. The
good student can sense what is
going on in the soul of a man . . .
For the really gifted, routine
teaching will not do much good.
They are not always easy to
teach; often they are even unsure
of themselves."

! Prof. Bloch thinks these few
really gifted students who may be
getting their initiation into a sub
ject are of primary importance.
Their foundation in the field is
whal matters most; later on they
can read on their own and learn
much even if the teaching m a y
not be outstanding.
