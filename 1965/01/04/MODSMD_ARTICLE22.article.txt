# FSM Represents Vital Critique Of University
## 
### T. WALTER HERBERT, JR 
EDITOR'S NOTE: In Hie last
editorial of lust quarter on the
arrests made at Berkeley after
the massive sit-in, we said that
"it is time that the effort be
made to understand" the actions
and attitudes of the student
demonstrators. To aid that
effort, we reprint the following',
which is part of an open letter
on the Berkeley situation writ
ten by T. Walter Herbert, Jr.
of the Wesley Foundation, Ber
keley.

The present controversy regard
ing 'Free Speech' on the campus
lias been a source of concern and
perplexity. It has been difficult
to gain much definite understand
ing of the Free Speech Movement,
perhaps largely because the move
ment has been groping for some
understanding of itself; certainly
also because events have broken
rapidly.
Some of the sense of concus
sion which we have all felt regard
ing it arises from the fact that our
ordinary expectations have been
violated. Thus a special effort is
required to understand the move
ment, and as a contribution to
that effort I should like to offer
the following commentary.
It is important to recognize
what lies beneath the explicit
battle regarding constitutional
rights. My contention is that on
the level of basic motivation the
FSM and those who have rallied
to their banner are animated by
a sense of isolation, alienation and
despair. They feel that the gen
eral atmosphere of the academic
culture here in Berkeley is one
which inhibits personal expres
siveness, discourages genuine con
versation on issues of basic value,
and impedes the development of
any authentic intellectual or per
sonal community.
Since coming to Berkeley a
year ago I have been more and
more deeply impressed with the
fact that few people seem to get
much chance to talk about the
things they care about. There
seems to be very little sense of
belonging, here, to something that
really matters, very little oppor
tunity for personal sharing and a
sense of mutual participation in
act ivities really worthy of a man's
loyalty.
The general sentiment is that
everyone is caught up in a vast
impersonal system, th a t 'the
system' isolates those who would
join with their fellows in a really
meaningful human community, it
lodges with some of the most
promising a sense of deep aliena
tion from their fellows and from
the corporate life as a whole, and
il invokes despair on the question
whether one is going to have his
being as a human being.
So that at the level of motiva
tion, 1 submit, this is a battle
about dehumanization; it is driv
en largely by a sense of abhor
rence for the annihilation of per
sonhood. As I say, I have been
concerned about these matters
for months, but the first people
I met since coming here who
broached this issue before I did
in conversation, and grasped it
in some depth are members of

the Free Speech Movement. . . .
What we have seen, I think, is
a city of the intellect developing
characteristically urban problems.
At the center we have a vast im
personal process characterized by
a high degree of functional and
impersonal interdependence, and
from this center with the terrify
ing threat it rears against per
sonal identity persons flee into
'macro-cliques.' These are sizeable
groups of people who more or less
talk alike, look alike, think alike:
the fraternity crowd, the arty
crowd, the religious crowd, the
political crowd. These correspond,
to carry the metaphor on, to the
suburban areas surrounding the
center city, where personal exis
tence is nurtured. . . .
The 'free speech movement' is
trying to force a personal, prin
cipled stand from those who rep
resent the impersonal system.
They are claiming that students
are not raw material to be pro
cessed into a saleable product, but
human beings with human rights.
They have their feet in the center
of things, and this is the reason
why the movement has released
such colossal personal energies.
It has the ring of something
fundamentally true about it. The
appeal goes straight to the per
sonal nerve. On October Ist I
heard a voice from a window in
Sproul Hall shouting "the admin
istration wants you to walk on
by like machines, we beg you to
turn around, like men, and come
in and help us.' I didn't go in my
self, but I was deeply troubled
by that cry, and I continue to be.
Now let us agree that the free
speech movement is not entirely
blameless; let us agree that they
have added stinging insult to un
justifiable injury. Once having
recognized that, let us also recog
nize that they represent a critique
of the current situation which is
very profound. These arc not
communist-led rowdies. Those 1
have spoken with are persons
deeply sensitive to what is hap
pening to the University, whose
concern is authentic and whose
desire for a humane outcome is
genuine. But they are also liable
to despair and despair is a dread
ful corrosive to the wisdom both
sides so desperately need.
One of the most important ways
in which the free speech move
ment has surprised ordinary ex
pectations lies in the remarkably
wide range of political affiliations
it has coalesced. With so pro
nounced and cohesive an insur
gent spirit one tends to expect an
embracing ideology, a shared
'world view' with shared political
implications. Such, however, is not
the case here. The movement is
not held together by any broad
political philosophy either of the
far right or the far left, and to
hold that the central fervor has
such a character is, I submit, a
mistake.
If shared political or philo
sophical convictions do not hold
the movement together, then what
does hold it together? I suggest
that there are a number of things.
First there is a common suspicion
of wealth and of the signs of
wealth. Many persons in the move
ment look poor, by dress and

grooming, who are not poor at
all, and that moneyed interests
have a sinister power is a theme
touched very frequently both pri
vately and in public. There is also
an emphasis on personal realness
which opposes itself to the masks
of social convention, despises
pho ny, slick, commercialized
"friendliness,' and yearns for per
sonal relations which are candid,
open and direct.
However astonishing it may
sound, I must confess to having
been impressed by a remarkable
gentleness and sweetness of spirit
which comes out here and there
as the life of this movement goes
on. Further, there is a vigilance
on behalf of individual integrity
which tends to be uncompromis
ing and is very sensitive to the
threat against individual integrity
which is thought to bo posed by
'big organizations.' And who can
say that this threat is entirely
fictitious? This vigilance under
current stresses has tended to be
come a "Don't Tread On Me" atti
tude with blasts of fury aimed
at the sometimes guiltless offen
der.
Another common feature which
generally characterizes the move
ment in the absence of a common
ideology is a capacity for empha
tic moral reaction to a specific
situation. The sense of specific
moral outrage: "This is bad. This
must stop." has been evoked on
a number of public issues and it
is decisively present in the cur
rent circumstance. Finally there
is a concern for the concrete rele
vance of truth to the human sit
uation, with the understanding
that our situation is human in
sofar as we are consciously in
volved with questions of value,
meaning and purpose. That
trained intelligence has an impor
tant relevance to such matters,
that intellectual activitiy is as im
portant for the nourishment of
wisdom as it is for the produc
tion of knowledge, that through
the discipline of the mind we can
learn better not only how to do
things but what things it would
be well to do; these contentions
are part of the unifying spirit of
the movement.
Perhaps I should make it clear
that I do not believe the move
ment to be a communion of saints,
or a band of prophets who have
all the answers for all the major
problems which afflict the con
temporary university. There cer
tainly is a large measure of moral
turmoil and uncertainty in the
movement, and I do not wish to
deny that its mood has at times
been ugly, its speaking venomous
and its actions rash.
But I really do believe that
there is an area of common con
cern between the administration
and the FSM, and that this pres
ent crisis is filled with opportun
ity as well as danger. It is also
filled with ironies, and one of the
more terrible of these ironies is
that the University may cut itself
off from a vitality which could
bring a profound refreshment to
the spirit of the Institution, a
humanizing of the intellectual at
mosphere, a new freedom from
stereotypes, and a sense of caring
about what happens here.

wide range of political affiliations
it has coalesced. With so pro
nounced and cohesive an insur
gent spirit one tends to expect an
embracing ideology, a shared
'world view' with shared political
implications. Such, however, is not
the case here. The movement is
not held together by any broad
political philosophy either of the
far right or the far left, and to
hold that the central fervor has
such a character is, I submit, a
mistake.
If shared political or philo
sophical convictions do not hold
the movement together, then what
does hold it together? I suggest
that there are a number of things.
First there is a common suspicion
of wealth and of the signs of
wealth. Many persons in the move
ment look poor, by dress and

grooming, who are not poor at
all, and that moneyed interests
have a sinister power is a theme
touched very frequently both pri
vately and in public. There is also
an emphasis on personal realness
which opposes itself to the masks
of social convention, despises
pho ny, slick, commercialized
"friendliness,' and yearns for per
sonal relations which are candid,
open and direct.
However astonishing it may
sound, I must confess to having
been impressed by a remarkable
gentleness and sweetness of spirit
which comes out here and there
as the life of this movement goes
on. Further, there is a vigilance
on behalf of individual integrity
which tends to be uncompromis
ing and is very sensitive to the
threat against individual integrity
which is thought to bo posed by
'big organizations.' And who can
say that this threat is entirely
fictitious? This vigilance under
current stresses has tended to be
come a "Don't Tread On Me" atti
tude with blasts of fury aimed
at the sometimes guiltless offen
der.
Another common feature which
generally characterizes the move
ment in the absence of a common
ideology is a capacity for empha
tic moral reaction to a specific
situation. The sense of specific
moral outrage: "This is bad. This
must stop." has been evoked on
a number of public issues and it
is decisively present in the cur
rent circumstance. Finally there
is a concern for the concrete rele
vance of truth to the human sit
uation, with the understanding
that our situation is human in
sofar as we are consciously in
volved with questions of value,
meaning and purpose. That
trained intelligence has an impor
tant relevance to such matters,
that intellectual activitiy is as im
portant for the nourishment of
wisdom as it is for the produc
tion of knowledge, that through
the discipline of the mind we can
learn better not only how to do
things but what things it would
be well to do; these contentions
are part of the unifying spirit of
the movement.
Perhaps I should make it clear
that I do not believe the move
ment to be a communion of saints,
or a band of prophets who have
all the answers for all the major
problems which afflict the con
temporary university. There cer
tainly is a large measure of moral
turmoil and uncertainty in the
movement, and I do not wish to
deny that its mood has at times
been ugly, its speaking venomous
and its actions rash.
But I really do believe that
there is an area of common con
cern between the administration
and the FSM, and that this pres
ent crisis is filled with opportun
ity as well as danger. It is also
filled with ironies, and one of the
more terrible of these ironies is
that the University may cut itself
off from a vitality which could
bring a profound refreshment to
the spirit of the Institution, a
humanizing of the intellectual at
mosphere, a new freedom from
stereotypes, and a sense of caring
about what happens here.
EDITOR'S NOTE: In Hie last
editorial of lust quarter on the
arrests made at Berkeley after
the massive sit-in, we said that
"it is time that the effort be
made to understand" the actions
and attitudes of the student
demonstrators. To aid that
effort, we reprint the following',
which is part of an open letter
on the Berkeley situation writ
ten by T. Walter Herbert, Jr.
of the Wesley Foundation, Ber
keley.

The present controversy regard
ing 'Free Speech' on the campus
lias been a source of concern and
perplexity. It has been difficult
to gain much definite understand
ing of the Free Speech Movement,
perhaps largely because the move
ment has been groping for some
understanding of itself; certainly
also because events have broken
rapidly.
Some of the sense of concus
sion which we have all felt regard
ing it arises from the fact that our
ordinary expectations have been
violated. Thus a special effort is
required to understand the move
ment, and as a contribution to
that effort I should like to offer
the following commentary.
It is important to recognize
what lies beneath the explicit
battle regarding constitutional
rights. My contention is that on
the level of basic motivation the
FSM and those who have rallied
to their banner are animated by
a sense of isolation, alienation and
despair. They feel that the gen
eral atmosphere of the academic
culture here in Berkeley is one
which inhibits personal expres
siveness, discourages genuine con
versation on issues of basic value,
and impedes the development of
any authentic intellectual or per
sonal community.
Since coming to Berkeley a
year ago I have been more and
more deeply impressed with the
fact that few people seem to get
much chance to talk about the
things they care about. There
seems to be very little sense of
belonging, here, to something that
really matters, very little oppor
tunity for personal sharing and a
sense of mutual participation in
act ivities really worthy of a man's
loyalty.
The general sentiment is that
everyone is caught up in a vast
impersonal system, th a t 'the
system' isolates those who would
join with their fellows in a really
meaningful human community, it
lodges with some of the most
promising a sense of deep aliena
tion from their fellows and from
the corporate life as a whole, and
il invokes despair on the question
whether one is going to have his
being as a human being.
So that at the level of motiva
tion, 1 submit, this is a battle
about dehumanization; it is driv
en largely by a sense of abhor
rence for the annihilation of per
sonhood. As I say, I have been
concerned about these matters
for months, but the first people
I met since coming here who
broached this issue before I did
in conversation, and grasped it
in some depth are members of

the Free Speech Movement. . . .
What we have seen, I think, is
a city of the intellect developing
characteristically urban problems.
At the center we have a vast im
personal process characterized by
a high degree of functional and
impersonal interdependence, and
from this center with the terrify
ing threat it rears against per
sonal identity persons flee into
'macro-cliques.' These are sizeable
groups of people who more or less
talk alike, look alike, think alike:
the fraternity crowd, the arty
crowd, the religious crowd, the
political crowd. These correspond,
to carry the metaphor on, to the
suburban areas surrounding the
center city, where personal exis
tence is nurtured. . . .
The 'free speech movement' is
trying to force a personal, prin
cipled stand from those who rep
resent the impersonal system.
They are claiming that students
are not raw material to be pro
cessed into a saleable product, but
human beings with human rights.
They have their feet in the center
of things, and this is the reason
why the movement has released
such colossal personal energies.
It has the ring of something
fundamentally true about it. The
appeal goes straight to the per
sonal nerve. On October Ist I
heard a voice from a window in
Sproul Hall shouting "the admin
istration wants you to walk on
by like machines, we beg you to
turn around, like men, and come
in and help us.' I didn't go in my
self, but I was deeply troubled
by that cry, and I continue to be.
Now let us agree that the free
speech movement is not entirely
blameless; let us agree that they
have added stinging insult to un
justifiable injury. Once having
recognized that, let us also recog
nize that they represent a critique
of the current situation which is
very profound. These arc not
communist-led rowdies. Those 1
have spoken with are persons
deeply sensitive to what is hap
pening to the University, whose
concern is authentic and whose
desire for a humane outcome is
genuine. But they are also liable
to despair and despair is a dread
ful corrosive to the wisdom both
sides so desperately need.
One of the most important ways
in which the free speech move
ment has surprised ordinary ex
pectations lies in the remarkably
wide range of political affiliations
it has coalesced. With so pro
nounced and cohesive an insur
gent spirit one tends to expect an
embracing ideology, a shared
'world view' with shared political
implications. Such, however, is not
the case here. The movement is
not held together by any broad

siveness, discourages genuine con
versation on issues of basic value,
and impedes the development of
any authentic intellectual or per
sonal community.
Since coming to Berkeley a
year ago I have been more and
more deeply impressed with the
fact that few people seem to get
much chance to talk about the
things they care about. There
seems to be very little sense of
belonging, here, to something that
really matters, very little oppor
tunity for personal sharing and a
sense of mutual participation in
act ivities really worthy of a man's
loyalty.
The general sentiment is that
everyone is caught up in a vast
impersonal system, th a t 'the
system' isolates those who would
join with their fellows in a really
meaningful human community, it
lodges with some of the most
promising a sense of deep aliena
tion from their fellows and from
the corporate life as a whole, and
il invokes despair on the question
whether one is going to have his
being as a human being.
So that at the level of motiva
tion, 1 submit, this is a battle
about dehumanization; it is driv
en largely by a sense of abhor
rence for the annihilation of per
sonhood. As I say, I have been
concerned about these matters
for months, but the first people
I met since coming here who
broached this issue before I did
in conversation, and grasped it
in some depth are members of

the Free Speech Movement. . . .
What we have seen, I think, is
a city of the intellect developing
characteristically urban problems.
At the center we have a vast im
personal process characterized by
a high degree of functional and
impersonal interdependence, and
from this center with the terrify
ing threat it rears against per
sonal identity persons flee into
'macro-cliques.' These are sizeable
groups of people who more or less
talk alike, look alike, think alike:
the fraternity crowd, the arty
crowd, the religious crowd, the
political crowd. These correspond,
to carry the metaphor on, to the
suburban areas surrounding the
center city, where personal exis
tence is nurtured. . . .
The 'free speech movement' is
trying to force a personal, prin
cipled stand from those who rep
resent the impersonal system.
They are claiming that students
are not raw material to be pro
cessed into a saleable product, but
human beings with human rights.
They have their feet in the center
of things, and this is the reason
why the movement has released
such colossal personal energies.
It has the ring of something
fundamentally true about it. The
appeal goes straight to the per
sonal nerve. On October Ist I
heard a voice from a window in
Sproul Hall shouting "the admin
istration wants you to walk on
by like machines, we beg you to
turn around, like men, and come
in and help us.' I didn't go in my
self, but I was deeply troubled
by that cry, and I continue to be.
Now let us agree that the free
speech movement is not entirely
blameless; let us agree that they
have added stinging insult to un
justifiable injury. Once having
recognized that, let us also recog
nize that they represent a critique
of the current situation which is
very profound. These arc not
communist-led rowdies. Those 1
have spoken with are persons
deeply sensitive to what is hap
pening to the University, whose
concern is authentic and whose
desire for a humane outcome is
genuine. But they are also liable
to despair and despair is a dread
ful corrosive to the wisdom both
sides so desperately need.
One of the most important ways
in which the free speech move
ment has surprised ordinary ex
pectations lies in the remarkably
wide range of political affiliations
it has coalesced. With so pro
nounced and cohesive an insur
gent spirit one tends to expect an
embracing ideology, a shared
'world view' with shared political
implications. Such, however, is not
the case here. The movement is
not held together by any broad
political philosophy either of the
far right or the far left, and to
hold that the central fervor has
such a character is, I submit, a
mistake.
If shared political or philo
sophical convictions do not hold
the movement together, then what
does hold it together? I suggest
that there are a number of things.
First there is a common suspicion
of wealth and of the signs of
wealth. Many persons in the move
ment look poor, by dress and

grooming, who are not poor at
all, and that moneyed interests
have a sinister power is a theme
touched very frequently both pri
vately and in public. There is also
an emphasis on personal realness
which opposes itself to the masks
of social convention, despises
pho ny, slick, commercialized
"friendliness,' and yearns for per
sonal relations which are candid,
open and direct.
However astonishing it may
sound, I must confess to having
been impressed by a remarkable
gentleness and sweetness of spirit
which comes out here and there
as the life of this movement goes
on. Further, there is a vigilance
on behalf of individual integrity
which tends to be uncompromis
ing and is very sensitive to the
threat against individual integrity
which is thought to bo posed by
'big organizations.' And who can
say that this threat is entirely
fictitious? This vigilance under
current stresses has tended to be
come a "Don't Tread On Me" atti
tude with blasts of fury aimed
at the sometimes guiltless offen
der.
Another common feature which
generally characterizes the move
ment in the absence of a common
ideology is a capacity for empha
tic moral reaction to a specific
situation. The sense of specific
moral outrage: "This is bad. This
must stop." has been evoked on
a number of public issues and it
is decisively present in the cur
rent circumstance. Finally there
is a concern for the concrete rele
vance of truth to the human sit
uation, with the understanding
that our situation is human in
sofar as we are consciously in
volved with questions of value,
meaning and purpose. That
trained intelligence has an impor
tant relevance to such matters,
that intellectual activitiy is as im
portant for the nourishment of
wisdom as it is for the produc
tion of knowledge, that through
the discipline of the mind we can
learn better not only how to do
things but what things it would
be well to do; these contentions
are part of the unifying spirit of
the movement.
Perhaps I should make it clear
that I do not believe the move
ment to be a communion of saints,
or a band of prophets who have
all the answers for all the major
problems which afflict the con
temporary university. There cer
tainly is a large measure of moral
turmoil and uncertainty in the
movement, and I do not wish to
deny that its mood has at times
been ugly, its speaking venomous
and its actions rash.
But I really do believe that
there is an area of common con
cern between the administration
and the FSM, and that this pres
ent crisis is filled with opportun
ity as well as danger. It is also
filled with ironies, and one of the
more terrible of these ironies is
that the University may cut itself
off from a vitality which could
bring a profound refreshment to
the spirit of the Institution, a
humanizing of the intellectual at
mosphere, a new freedom from
stereotypes, and a sense of caring
about what happens here.
EDITOR'S NOTE: In Hie last
editorial of lust quarter on the
arrests made at Berkeley after
the massive sit-in, we said that
"it is time that the effort be
made to understand" the actions
and attitudes of the student
demonstrators. To aid that
effort, we reprint the following',
which is part of an open letter
on the Berkeley situation writ
ten by T. Walter Herbert, Jr.
of the Wesley Foundation, Ber
keley.

The present controversy regard
ing 'Free Speech' on the campus
lias been a source of concern and
perplexity. It has been difficult
to gain much definite understand
ing of the Free Speech Movement,
perhaps largely because the move
ment has been groping for some
understanding of itself; certainly
also because events have broken
rapidly.
Some of the sense of concus
sion which we have all felt regard
ing it arises from the fact that our
ordinary expectations have been
violated. Thus a special effort is
required to understand the move
ment, and as a contribution to
that effort I should like to offer
the following commentary.
It is important to recognize
what lies beneath the explicit
battle regarding constitutional
rights. My contention is that on
the level of basic motivation the
FSM and those who have rallied
to their banner are animated by
a sense of isolation, alienation and
despair. They feel that the gen
eral atmosphere of the academic
culture here in Berkeley is one
which inhibits personal expres
siveness, discourages genuine con
versation on issues of basic value,
and impedes the development of
any authentic intellectual or per
sonal community.

threat against individual integrity
which is thought to bo posed by
'big organizations.' And who can
say that this threat is entirely
fictitious? This vigilance under
current stresses has tended to be
come a "Don't Tread On Me" atti
tude with blasts of fury aimed
at the sometimes guiltless offen
der.
Another common feature which
generally characterizes the move
ment in the absence of a common
ideology is a capacity for empha
tic moral reaction to a specific
situation. The sense of specific
moral outrage: "This is bad. This
must stop." has been evoked on
a number of public issues and it
is decisively present in the cur
rent circumstance. Finally there
is a concern for the concrete rele
vance of truth to the human sit
uation, with the understanding
that our situation is human in
sofar as we are consciously in
volved with questions of value,
meaning and purpose. That
trained intelligence has an impor
tant relevance to such matters,
that intellectual activitiy is as im
portant for the nourishment of
wisdom as it is for the produc
tion of knowledge, that through
the discipline of the mind we can
learn better not only how to do
things but what things it would
be well to do; these contentions
are part of the unifying spirit of
the movement.
Perhaps I should make it clear
that I do not believe the move
ment to be a communion of saints,
or a band of prophets who have
all the answers for all the major
problems which afflict the con
temporary university. There cer
tainly is a large measure of moral
turmoil and uncertainty in the
movement, and I do not wish to
deny that its mood has at times
been ugly, its speaking venomous
and its actions rash.
But I really do believe that
there is an area of common con
cern between the administration
and the FSM, and that this pres
ent crisis is filled with opportun
ity as well as danger. It is also
filled with ironies, and one of the
more terrible of these ironies is
that the University may cut itself
off from a vitality which could
bring a profound refreshment to
the spirit of the Institution, a
humanizing of the intellectual at
mosphere, a new freedom from
stereotypes, and a sense of caring
about what happens here.
EDITOR'S NOTE: In Hie last
editorial of lust quarter on the
arrests made at Berkeley after
the massive sit-in, we said that
"it is time that the effort be
made to understand" the actions
and attitudes of the student
demonstrators. To aid that
effort, we reprint the following',
which is part of an open letter
on the Berkeley situation writ
ten by T. Walter Herbert, Jr.
of the Wesley Foundation, Ber
keley.

The present controversy regard
ing 'Free Speech' on the campus
lias been a source of concern and
perplexity. It has been difficult
to gain much definite understand
ing of the Free Speech Movement,
perhaps largely because the move
ment has been groping for some
understanding of itself; certainly
also because events have broken
rapidly.
Some of the sense of concus
sion which we have all felt regard
ing it arises from the fact that our
ordinary expectations have been
violated. Thus a special effort is
required to understand the move
ment, and as a contribution to
that effort I should like to offer
the following commentary.
It is important to recognize
what lies beneath the explicit
battle regarding constitutional
rights. My contention is that on
the level of basic motivation the
FSM and those who have rallied
to their banner are animated by
a sense of isolation, alienation and
despair. They feel that the gen
eral atmosphere of the academic
culture here in Berkeley is one
which inhibits personal expres
siveness, discourages genuine con
versation on issues of basic value,
and impedes the development of
any authentic intellectual or per
sonal community.
Since coming to Berkeley a
year ago I have been more and
more deeply impressed with the
fact that few people seem to get
much chance to talk about the
things they care about. There
seems to be very little sense of
belonging, here, to something that
really matters, very little oppor
tunity for personal sharing and a
sense of mutual participation in
act ivities really worthy of a man's
loyalty.
The general sentiment is that
everyone is caught up in a vast
impersonal system, th a t 'the
system' isolates those who would
join with their fellows in a really
meaningful human community, it
lodges with some of the most
promising a sense of deep aliena
tion from their fellows and from
the corporate life as a whole, and
il invokes despair on the question
whether one is going to have his
being as a human being.
So that at the level of motiva
tion, 1 submit, this is a battle
about dehumanization; it is driv
en largely by a sense of abhor
rence for the annihilation of per
sonhood. As I say, I have been
concerned about these matters
for months, but the first people
I met since coming here who
broached this issue before I did
in conversation, and grasped it
in some depth are members of

the Free Speech Movement. . . .
What we have seen, I think, is
a city of the intellect developing
characteristically urban problems.
At the center we have a vast im
personal process characterized by
a high degree of functional and
impersonal interdependence, and
from this center with the terrify
ing threat it rears against per
sonal identity persons flee into
'macro-cliques.' These are sizeable
groups of people who more or less
talk alike, look alike, think alike:
the fraternity crowd, the arty
crowd, the religious crowd, the
political crowd. These correspond,
to carry the metaphor on, to the
suburban areas surrounding the
center city, where personal exis
tence is nurtured. . . .
The 'free speech movement' is
trying to force a personal, prin
cipled stand from those who rep
resent the impersonal system.
They are claiming that students
are not raw material to be pro
cessed into a saleable product, but
human beings with human rights.
They have their feet in the center
of things, and this is the reason
why the movement has released
such colossal personal energies.
It has the ring of something
fundamentally true about it. The
appeal goes straight to the per
sonal nerve. On October Ist I
heard a voice from a window in
Sproul Hall shouting "the admin
istration wants you to walk on
by like machines, we beg you to
turn around, like men, and come
in and help us.' I didn't go in my
self, but I was deeply troubled
by that cry, and I continue to be.
Now let us agree that the free
speech movement is not entirely
blameless; let us agree that they
have added stinging insult to un
justifiable injury. Once having
recognized that, let us also recog
nize that they represent a critique
of the current situation which is
very profound. These arc not
communist-led rowdies. Those 1
have spoken with are persons
deeply sensitive to what is hap
pening to the University, whose
concern is authentic and whose
desire for a humane outcome is
genuine. But they are also liable
to despair and despair is a dread
ful corrosive to the wisdom both
sides so desperately need.
One of the most important ways
in which the free speech move
ment has surprised ordinary ex
pectations lies in the remarkably
wide range of political affiliations
it has coalesced. With so pro
nounced and cohesive an insur
gent spirit one tends to expect an
embracing ideology, a shared
'world view' with shared political
implications. Such, however, is not
the case here. The movement is
not held together by any broad
political philosophy either of the
far right or the far left, and to
hold that the central fervor has
such a character is, I submit, a
mistake.
If shared political or philo
sophical convictions do not hold
the movement together, then what
does hold it together? I suggest
that there are a number of things.
First there is a common suspicion
of wealth and of the signs of
wealth. Many persons in the move
ment look poor, by dress and

grooming, who are not poor at
all, and that moneyed interests
have a sinister power is a theme
touched very frequently both pri
vately and in public. There is also
an emphasis on personal realness
which opposes itself to the masks
of social convention, despises
pho ny, slick, commercialized
"friendliness,' and yearns for per
sonal relations which are candid,
open and direct.
However astonishing it may
sound, I must confess to having
been impressed by a remarkable
gentleness and sweetness of spirit
which comes out here and there
as the life of this movement goes
on. Further, there is a vigilance
on behalf of individual integrity
which tends to be uncompromis
ing and is very sensitive to the
threat against individual integrity
which is thought to bo posed by
'big organizations.' And who can
say that this threat is entirely
fictitious? This vigilance under
current stresses has tended to be
come a "Don't Tread On Me" atti
tude with blasts of fury aimed
at the sometimes guiltless offen

What we have seen, I think, is
a city of the intellect developing
characteristically urban problems.
At the center we have a vast im
personal process characterized by
a high degree of functional and
impersonal interdependence, and
from this center with the terrify
ing threat it rears against per
sonal identity persons flee into
'macro-cliques.' These are sizeable
groups of people who more or less
talk alike, look alike, think alike:
the fraternity crowd, the arty
crowd, the religious crowd, the
political crowd. These correspond,
to carry the metaphor on, to the
suburban areas surrounding the
center city, where personal exis
tence is nurtured. . . .
The 'free speech movement' is
trying to force a personal, prin
cipled stand from those who rep
resent the impersonal system.
They are claiming that students
are not raw material to be pro
cessed into a saleable product, but
human beings with human rights.
They have their feet in the center
of things, and this is the reason
why the movement has released
such colossal personal energies.
It has the ring of something
fundamentally true about it. The
appeal goes straight to the per
sonal nerve. On October Ist I
heard a voice from a window in
Sproul Hall shouting "the admin
istration wants you to walk on
by like machines, we beg you to
turn around, like men, and come
in and help us.' I didn't go in my
self, but I was deeply troubled
by that cry, and I continue to be.
Now let us agree that the free
speech movement is not entirely
blameless; let us agree that they
have added stinging insult to un
justifiable injury. Once having
recognized that, let us also recog
nize that they represent a critique
of the current situation which is
very profound. These arc not
communist-led rowdies. Those 1
have spoken with are persons
deeply sensitive to what is hap
pening to the University, whose
concern is authentic and whose
desire for a humane outcome is
genuine. But they are also liable
to despair and despair is a dread
ful corrosive to the wisdom both
sides so desperately need.
One of the most important ways
in which the free speech move
ment has surprised ordinary ex
pectations lies in the remarkably
wide range of political affiliations
it has coalesced. With so pro
nounced and cohesive an insur
gent spirit one tends to expect an
embracing ideology, a shared
'world view' with shared political
implications. Such, however, is not
the case here. The movement is
not held together by any broad
political philosophy either of the
far right or the far left, and to
hold that the central fervor has
such a character is, I submit, a
mistake.
If shared political or philo
sophical convictions do not hold
the movement together, then what
does hold it together? I suggest
that there are a number of things.
First there is a common suspicion
of wealth and of the signs of
wealth. Many persons in the move
ment look poor, by dress and

grooming, who are not poor at
all, and that moneyed interests
have a sinister power is a theme
touched very frequently both pri
vately and in public. There is also
an emphasis on personal realness
which opposes itself to the masks
of social convention, despises
pho ny, slick, commercialized
"friendliness,' and yearns for per
sonal relations which are candid,
open and direct.
However astonishing it may
sound, I must confess to having
been impressed by a remarkable
gentleness and sweetness of spirit
which comes out here and there
as the life of this movement goes
on. Further, there is a vigilance
on behalf of individual integrity
which tends to be uncompromis
ing and is very sensitive to the
threat against individual integrity
which is thought to bo posed by
'big organizations.' And who can
say that this threat is entirely
fictitious? This vigilance under
current stresses has tended to be
come a "Don't Tread On Me" atti
tude with blasts of fury aimed
at the sometimes guiltless offen
der.
Another common feature which
generally characterizes the move
ment in the absence of a common
ideology is a capacity for empha
tic moral reaction to a specific
situation. The sense of specific
moral outrage: "This is bad. This
must stop." has been evoked on
a number of public issues and it
is decisively present in the cur
rent circumstance. Finally there
is a concern for the concrete rele
vance of truth to the human sit
uation, with the understanding
that our situation is human in
sofar as we are consciously in
volved with questions of value,
meaning and purpose. That
trained intelligence has an impor
tant relevance to such matters,
that intellectual activitiy is as im
portant for the nourishment of
wisdom as it is for the produc
tion of knowledge, that through
the discipline of the mind we can
learn better not only how to do
things but what things it would
be well to do; these contentions
are part of the unifying spirit of
the movement.
Perhaps I should make it clear
that I do not believe the move
ment to be a communion of saints,
or a band of prophets who have
all the answers for all the major
problems which afflict the con
temporary university. There cer
tainly is a large measure of moral
turmoil and uncertainty in the
movement, and I do not wish to
deny that its mood has at times
been ugly, its speaking venomous
and its actions rash.
But I really do believe that
there is an area of common con
cern between the administration
and the FSM, and that this pres
ent crisis is filled with opportun
ity as well as danger. It is also
filled with ironies, and one of the
more terrible of these ironies is
that the University may cut itself
off from a vitality which could
bring a profound refreshment to
the spirit of the Institution, a
humanizing of the intellectual at
mosphere, a new freedom from
stereotypes, and a sense of caring
about what happens here.
