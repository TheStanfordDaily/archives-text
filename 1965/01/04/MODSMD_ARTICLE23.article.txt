## Benefits Of Off-Campus Living Should Be Opened To Women 
### 
Dear Sir:
In the current debates over I
vvomens' social regulations, one
point, which I feel is the most I
meritorious of change, lends to
be buried under the arguments
about hours. That is, the unjusti
fiable refusal of the administra
tion to allow women to live off
campus. At least senior women,
and more realistically, both sen
ior and junior women, should bo
allowed to live off campus if they j
so desire. If the administration is -
worried about the expense of!
maintaining empty dormitories, j
11 ii'iv Mr i ill 11 ions olhei 11 i.in im

posing social restrictions on wom
en to solve a financial problem.
There are, presently, plans for
tiie construction of more mens'
dormitories. Why not turn some
of the womens' housing into
mens' housing, thereby "killing
two birds with one stone": men
looking for on-campus accommo
dations will have them, and wom
en wishing to live off campus will
have that opportunity. This would
create no additional load on the
apartment houses in surrounding
areas since the total number of
persons living off campus would
remain the same. If the outflow
of women were too great, the
si!ualion < i>llltt lie controlled lis

the present drawing system, with
"off campus" listed as one choice
for womens' housing (although
I would question even this restric
tion unless it were applied equally
to men).
I will close with two comments:
1) It has been proven possible to
live off campus more cheaply than
on campus, so why are women
j denied this opportunity? 2> This
i is the only major university to
j impose this ridiculous restriction
! on women. 1 think this is a rather
humiliating commentary for a
j "high class" institution to make
jon the quality and character of
its women.
