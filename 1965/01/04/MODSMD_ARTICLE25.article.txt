## Excessive U.S. Globalism Causes Anti-Americanism 
### Walter Lippmann 
Recently things have boon going badly for tis in the Far East
I anil in Africa. Not that they were going well before. The prospect
! in South Vietnam has never been good except in the official com
-1 mimiques. And the Congo has been going from bad to worse ever
; since the United Nations was compelled for lack of money to with-

draw its peacekeeping forces. <
These two unhappy entangle
ments are the centers of the in
fection from which spring the
fever of anti-Americanism in the
non-white world. U.S. informa
tion libraries have been gutted
and burned in Egypt and Indo
nesia. Gen. Nguyen Khanh, our
most recent special favorite and
protege in Vietnam, has deemed
it his personal advantage to take
an anti-American line.
UN Anti-American?
In the United Nations we have
been talked at with a language of
violence hitherto unheard of in
time of peace. As this article is
being written, it is touch and go
whether <>r not there is now an
anti-American majority in th e
General Assembly of the United
Nations.
While we have been making
some limited advances in Europe
and in Latin America, the situa
tion has been going from bad to
worse in Africa and in that part
of Asia which lies within the orbit
of the influence, actual or poten
tial, of Red China.
We shall do well to ponder the
situation, beginning, I believe, by
realizing that less than 2i5 years
ago, when the second world war
began, it had never occurred to
any American strategist or dip
lomat to think that we would be
intervening in a Congolese civil
war or that we would have armies
in Korea and Southeast Asia. Our
farthest commitment in the Pa
cific was in the Philippines, and
virtually all Americans were hop
ing that the granting of indepen
dence to the Philippines would
have the happy result of reduc
ing our military commitments.
The 'Sod' Regions
The serious trouble we arc in
today lies in the soft regions
where we have accepted respon
sibility since the end of the second
world war. These are the soft
regions of Asia and Africa where
the old colonial systems have
collapsed -- the Belgian, the
French, the British (almost but
not quite),' the Japanese, the
Netherlands. Th c Portuguese
African empire is in great jeop
ardy.
We have let ourselves be sucked
into this vacuum of power on two
continents.
We have done so with the high
est motives, by allowing the ideo
logy of the cold war to take prece
dence in our minds over our own
national interests. We have

staked our prestige, a great deal
of money and many American
lives on the effort to provide gov
ernments which would resist and
repel the revolution which is J
sweeping the undeveloped world, i
IT.S.l T .S. Is Overextended
As a result, we have become
grossly overextended in regions
where we have no primary vital
interest. We have scattered our
assistance to such a degree that
we help everybody a little and
nobody enough. Moreover, we
have not had sufficient time,
money or energy left to care for
our our true vital interests nearer
home. In this globalism and scat
toration we have created enough
disappointment and frustration
to generate a wave of anti-Ameri
j canism.
The trouble is that we have not
attended to our primary vital in
terests. A primary vital interest
is one in which the security and
i well-being of a nation are in
! volvod. Our security and we 11-
| being are not involved in South
: east Asia or in Korea and never
have been. A primary vital inter
est is one which can be promoted
| and defended by calculated, not
I suicidal, means.
By this criterion we have been
j eommitteed far beyond our pri-
I mary vital interests and far be
j yond our military and political
I reach since the end of the second
'world war. We cannot put Africa
1 and Asia in order according to
j our ideals of order. We are in
trouble in these regions because
we have overeached ourselves and
are facing issues for which we do
I not have enough trained and ex
perienced personnel. There is no
true national support for these
ventures, and our people are un
willing, quite rightly, to stake
their destiny on them.
Isolationism and National
Interests
If is is said that this is isola
tionism, I would say yes. It is
isolationism if the study of our
own vital interests and a realiza
tion of Ihe limitations of our
power is isolationism. It is iso
lationism as compared with the
globalism which became fashion
able after the second world war.
! What of it? We are clear about
I our vital interests in Europe and
in the Americas. In the outer
zones of our post-war entangle
ments it is time to tell ourselves
j that there is much at stake and
I that we must be guided not by the
| hot ideologies, but by a cool ex
amination and calculation of the
national interest.
