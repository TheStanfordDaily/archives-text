# MOVIE REVIEW
## With Pussy Galore, How Can 'Goldfinger' Miss? 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
The latest installment in the fabulous adventures of James
Bond, that worldly-wise and debonair British Secret Service man,
is intriguingly titled Goldfinger. Even more intriguing, it features
as one of its main characters somebody named Pussy Galore.
It seems that she works for Auric Goldfinger, a modern-day

alchemist, who in turn is work-H
ing for the lied Chinese. They and
he have come up with an idea
which will both eliminate th e
U.S. gold supply and increase the
value of Goldfinger's hoard.
While unraveling (and thwart
ing) this nefarious scheme, James
naturally runs across some extra
curricular distractions (which he
of course takes full advantage
of). In addition, he is kidnapped
by Goldfinger and company, gets
pretty badly mauled by a grim
looking oriental (Goldfinger's
mute valet), but triumphs in a
blaze of glory (actually under
neath the blaze of a bright orange
parachute), the manner of which
it would be totally unfair to di
vulge.
Novel 'Adopted'
However, in specific details,
fans of the literary James Bond
will find this particular Gold
finger lan Fleming updated and
freely arranged. The pace is not
its former leisurely self, but fran
tic; the locales are altered; and
the plot is diluted.
There is also perhaps a little
too much tongue-in-cheek, but
otherwise the adapters have done
a topnotch job of turning a flashy
novel into an even flashier mo
tion picture.

And Sean Connery is clearly the
only person who could have
played James Bond, because he
outwardly fits the sketchy details
in the books, but also because he
saw the possibilities inherent in
making the rest of James Bond
over into Sean Connery and not
vise versa. The result is a sort of
creative characterization, and just
what was needed.
—The Cast of Characters
Gert Frobo plays Goldfinger as
a fat Mephistopheles with reel
hair and a sun tan, and makes up
for his lack of depth with more
than enough obnoxiousness.
Harold Sakata as Odd-job, th e
oriental valet, will probably win
an Oscar in a new category, that
of the best non-speaking support
ing actor. He is truly repulsive.
But as far as Bond and 1 h e
audience are concerned, the best
of the lot is Honor Blackman as
Pussy Galore. She starts out a
judo expert and pretty much of
a cold fish, but ends up warm,
willing, and emphatically on her
back in the most predictable
about-face of all time.
After all, how could another
■ inimitable James Bond movie end
if not with hero and companion
making Tower Hoover and hi s
dollies look like rank amateurs?

for his lack of depth with more
than enough obnoxiousness.
Harold Sakata as Odd-job, th e
oriental valet, will probably win
an Oscar in a new category, that
of the best non-speaking support
ing actor. He is truly repulsive.
But as far as Bond and 1 h e
audience are concerned, the best
of the lot is Honor Blackman as
Pussy Galore. She starts out a
judo expert and pretty much of
a cold fish, but ends up warm,
willing, and emphatically on her
back in the most predictable
about-face of all time.
After all, how could another
■ inimitable James Bond movie end
if not with hero and companion
making Tower Hoover and hi s
dollies look like rank amateurs?
The latest installment in the fabulous adventures of James
Bond, that worldly-wise and debonair British Secret Service man,
is intriguingly titled Goldfinger. Even more intriguing, it features
as one of its main characters somebody named Pussy Galore.
It seems that she works for Auric Goldfinger, a modern-day

alchemist, who in turn is work-H
ing for the lied Chinese. They and
he have come up with an idea
which will both eliminate th e
U.S. gold supply and increase the
value of Goldfinger's hoard.
While unraveling (and thwart
ing) this nefarious scheme, James
naturally runs across some extra
curricular distractions (which he
of course takes full advantage
of). In addition, he is kidnapped
by Goldfinger and company, gets
pretty badly mauled by a grim
looking oriental (Goldfinger's
mute valet), but triumphs in a
blaze of glory (actually under
neath the blaze of a bright orange
parachute), the manner of which
it would be totally unfair to di
vulge.
Novel 'Adopted'
However, in specific details,
fans of the literary James Bond
will find this particular Gold
finger lan Fleming updated and
freely arranged. The pace is not
its former leisurely self, but fran
tic; the locales are altered; and
the plot is diluted.
There is also perhaps a little
too much tongue-in-cheek, but
otherwise the adapters have done
a topnotch job of turning a flashy
novel into an even flashier mo
tion picture.

And Sean Connery is clearly the
only person who could have
played James Bond, because he
outwardly fits the sketchy details
in the books, but also because he
saw the possibilities inherent in
making the rest of James Bond
over into Sean Connery and not
vise versa. The result is a sort of
creative characterization, and just
what was needed.

Gert Frobo plays Goldfinger as
a fat Mephistopheles with reel
hair and a sun tan, and makes up
for his lack of depth with more
than enough obnoxiousness.
