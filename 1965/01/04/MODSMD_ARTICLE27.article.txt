# ATLANTIC UNION
## Movement's History: Moderation, Growth 
### DOUGLASS MORRIS (Last of a series begun last quarter) 
The history of the movement for Atlantic Union began in
1933, when The New York Times' correspondent at the League ol
Nations, Clarence Streit, became very concerned over the ineffec
tiveness of the League and of the international conferences seeking

to end the Depression.
He realized that only a feelera-"
lion of free nations, applying
! among them the principles first
applied in 1789 among the thir
teen American States, could per-
I manently prevent war and de
i pression and check dictatorship.
He expressed this idea and the
i reasons for it in the book Union
Now. Unable to get a publisher
until 1939, he used the time to
' improve the book and to test his
, ideas against events.
Soon after publication, many
j U.S. readers of the book formed
, local groups 10 further its ends.
! These groups joined to foi-m a
national organization, incorporat
ed as a non-profit membership
I association named at first Inter-
Democracy Federal Unionists and
later Federal Union, Inc. Streit
J was elected president of the or
| ganization. Similar groups ap
peared in Britain and France.
Character of Movement
This spontaneous grass-roots
beginning is highly unusual for
such an organization, and illus
trates the strong appeal of the
Atlantic Union idea. The move
kept this democratic nature.
' Federal Union has shown good
character in other ways as well.
In seeking to further its contro
versial ideas it has always
1 worked in a dignified and con
structive manner, and has not
sought publicity through sensa
i tionalism.
It has neve r aided in witch
; hunts or called names. It has al
; ways kept free of all Communist
infiltration, even when Soviet
j Russia was very popular in the
U.S.
It has never been obstructive,
; hut has supported steps to par
| tially unify the Atlantic commu
nity and the free world, and wid
er international organizations
such as the U.N.. while warning
that the greatest need is for fed
! eration of free nations.

International Movement
In 1958 Federal Union and the
; Atlantic Union organizations in
I several other countries formed a
I co ordinating body, called the In
■ ternational Movement for Atlan
tic Union, of which each national
I organization became an affiliate.
The International Movement
; also has an Advisory Council
! composed of several hundred
i prominent persons in all walks of
life and from all parts of the At
lantic community, and an Hon
i orary Council with such members
I as former French Premier Rob
ert Schuman, the Earl of Avon
(former British Prime Minister
• Sir Anthony Eden), Canada's
Prime Minister Lester Pearson
Belgium's Foreign Minister Paul-
Henri Spaak, and former Secre
tary of State Christian Herter.
i These councils are unlike most
big-name organizations in that
' membership involves a strong
| commitment to the organization's
; aim of Atlantic federation and,
I for the Advisory Council, annual
dues.
Other Organizations
Recently student, chapters of
Federal Union have been organ
; ized on various college campuses
under the name Young Fcderal
-1 ists for Atlantic Union.
Because Federal Union is a tax
exempt educational organization
it does not participate in political
activities such as Congressional
lobbying. Other organizations
have been formed for such pur
poses from to time.
The most important one is the
| Atlantic Union Committee, which
was incorporated in 1949 to work
for the action finally taken by
Congress in 1960 when it author
ized a convention of delegates
from NATO nations to explore
I how to unite them more strongly.
