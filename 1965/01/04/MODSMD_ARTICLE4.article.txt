BIG GUNS AT SLAC 20 naval guns, surplus 16
inchers like those of the heaviest battleship gun
batteries, have been chopped down to bite-size
and delivered to the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center to serve as radiation shielding for the two-

mile atom-smashing peacetime "cannon." Weigh
ing over 100 tons apiece, the big guns arrived
in 100 slices of about 20,000 pounds each from
the U.S. Naval Weapons Laboratory at Dahlgren,
Va.
