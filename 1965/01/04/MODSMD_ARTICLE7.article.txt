dation tyrant ill help Stanford
establish a professional ropertorv
theater on the campus.
in addition to the grant â€”
to be allocated at $100,000 a year
beginning in September Stan
ford will provide $120,000 a year.
STANFORD'S FI NDS will be
used to develop the academic
program, provide scholarships for
graduate students and pay ap
prentice actors and the technical
and management staffs for the
company. Admission prices will
help defray a portion of those
costs.
The Rockefeller grant will pay
the salaries for the company's di
rector and ten senior actors, and
will provide funds to assist in
establishing new professional
graduate courses in the Speech
and Drama Department leading
to the degree of master of fine
arts iMFA).
Professor Robert Loper, execu
tive head of the department, said
that plans call for the company
to present six productions during
the academic year. Three of these
will use, in addition to members
of the repertory company, MFA
candidates in their final year of
pre pa rat ion.
FOI'FR ADD ID that there will
lie several productions each year
which will use primarily under
graduates in their casts, and thai
an effort will be made to recruit
high school seniors interested in
drama and encourage them to at
tend Stanford.
He said that requirements for
undergraduate drama majors will
be revised, allowing more choice
on the pari of the student so that
he may take advantage of the in
tensive training offered ;is part
of the MFA program.
Loper envisioned the construc
tion of a new 1,000-seat theater
equipped for either classic or
experimental productions on
the campus, probably in the va
cant lot directly e;ist of Memorial
Auditorium.
IN ADDITION, an arrangement
wilh the San Francisco Actor's
Workshop is now in the works,
whereby Stanford's company and
the Workshop would exchange
shows, each doing its own produc
tions in the other's theater. Il is
also quite possible that some of
each group's staff would work
for the oilier on specific produc
i ions.
"This is a very exciting pros
pect for Stanford." he stated. "It
will make the University one of
the very few in Ihe count ly which
boasts a professional theatrical
company in residence, in which
the professionals also can lake an
active part in teaching.
"The universities themselves
must take the lead in assuring the
creativity ol the live theater,
where talent of all kinds can be
given a chance to flower.
'The increasing si ratification of
New York and Hollywood leave
the campus as the only place
where live drama, new and old.
can flourish without fear of a
commercial failure. The campus
theater i< our only hope il we
really believe that the art of the
theater really mailers."
