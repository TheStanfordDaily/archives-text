Perfect Peace with God
Arc you concerned about today's problems or anxious about the future? Is death
something' you'd rather not think about and life something just barely worth living?
Even if you're fairly happy and contended with yourself, is there purpose and mean
ing to your life? Are you at peace with God'
The God of the Tlible is no abstract, remote and impersonal power above the
clouds, but a kindly and loving Father to all who know llini. He makes His presence
known to His children and "spreads His wings to overshadow them" (Psalm 91).
In order to experience and know peace, with God it i-. only necessary that you be
lieve. trust in, and rely upon .lestis Christ as l.ord of your life. This is the Good
News of Romans chapter 5
"So. now. since we have been made right in God's sight by faith in Ilis promises,
we can have real peace with Ilim because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done
for us. For because of our faith. He has brought tis into this place of highest privilege
where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to actually becom
ing all that God has had in mind for lis to be. We can rejoice, too, when we run
into problems and trials for we know that they are good for us they help us learn
to be patient. And patience developes strength of character in us and helps us trust
God more each time until finally our hope and faith are strong and steady. Then,
when that happens, we will be able to hold our heads high no matter what happens
and know that all is well, for we will know how dearly God loves us. and we will
feel this warm love everywhere within us because God has given us the Holy Spirit
to fill our hearts with His love.
' When we were utterly helpless with no way of i scape. Christ came at just the
right time and died for us sinners who had no use for llini. Kvcn if we were good
we really wouldn't expect anyone to die for us, though of course that might be barely
possible. Hut God showed His great love for us by sending Christ to di< for u
while we were still sinners. And since by His blood lie did all this for us as sinners,
how much more will He do for its now that He had declared us just and good?
Now He will save u~ from all God's wrath to come. And since, when we were His
enemies we wen brought hack to God by the death of Ilis Son, what blessings lie
must have for tis now that we are His friends, and He is living within lis! Now
we have the wonderful joy of the Lord in our lives because of what our l.ord Jesus
Christ has done in dying for our and making lis Ilis friends," (Romans 5 1-11
I.iliufl Letters).
Faith in Jesus Christ brings real and positive results as millions for centuries
have discovered. Why hang on to fear and anxiety, and why remain outside of His
family with God's anger abiding on you (John The Way of Peace has !>ecn
opened for you by the Prince of Peace. He is the one and only Way provided for
men anywhere to know God and have eternal life with Ilim. Acknowledge Him is
Lord of your life today and be at peace with God.
