# Research Shows No Campus Sex Boom
## 
### 
Contrary to popular opinion, sexual per
missiveness has not swept the American col
lege campus, a Stanford researcher contends.
Mervin B. Freedman, assistant dean of
undergraduate education and a research asso
ciate at the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, bases this conclusion on a detailed
study of ati Eastern women's college in which
•1!) students were interviewed for four years
and several thousands ol' students were tested,
and on an historical survey of research on
the sexual behavior of women undergraduates.
His findings, in brief:
• Three-fourths or more of America's un
married college women are virgins;
• Premarital intercourse among college
women is usually restricted to their future
husbands; and
• Promiscuity is probably confined to a
very small percentage of college women
probably a lower proportion than high school
girls.
WHIEE ATTITUDES toward sex are often
liberalized in college, "the Puritan heritage
has by no means passed from the American
scene," Freedman writes in the current issue
of the Merrill-Palmer Quarterly.
"It is probable that the incidence of non
virginity among college women has increased
. . . little since the 1930'5," he adds. "The great
change in sexual behavior and mores since
1900 lias been in freedom of attitude and in
petting. . . .
"Starting from a base of quite low inci
dence, nonvirginity among college women
probably doubled or trebled in the years fol

lowing World War I. It is likely that this in
crease was stabilized by 1930 or thereabouts.
It may be, however, that the incidence of pre
marital intercourse has risen slowly since
1930, particularly among engaged couples....
"IT .MAY WKI-L BE that American college
students have evolved patterns of sexual be
havior that will remain stable for some time
to come. The behavior consists of petting, in
tercourse among some engaged couples, and
early marriage."
A trained clinical psychologist and author
of a number of papers on personality develop
ment in college students, Freedman indicated
that belief in a fixed set of ethics, based on
religious dogma, has waned since World War
I.
"So it is that few college students can
propound with any conviction ethical argu
ments for sexual abstinence or continence,"
he notes. "Accordingly, they are loathe to con
demn the behavior of others.
"This does not mean, however, that the
feelings that underlay these fixed convictions
have disappeared. Puritan sentiments, inhibi
tion of appetites and instincts, are a strong
feature of American middle class life. They
have been and are still being passed from
generation to generation.
"( ONSEQI ENTLY, most college women
behave conventionally, even though they may
not adhere to any specific moral code."
Among the 49 women students studied in
depth, five limited their experience to kissing,
33 engaged in petting, and 11 experienced
intercourse. Only three of the latter group

were "uninhibited" in their sexual behavior,
engaging in intercourse when they were not
deeply involved emotionally with men.
When asked how they felt about their sex
life, SO per cent of the 49 students studied said
they were content with the status quo.
While there was some tendency for those
who had restricted their activity to kissing or
light petting to be dissatisfied, they were
unanimous in asserting they could not or
would not seek out sexual encounters as such,
Freedman said. "Sexual gratification . . . could
emerge only in the context of a relationship
of some seriousness with a man.
"AMONG THE students who had engaged
in intercourse, the predominant attitude was
one of enjoyment and satisfaction," he added.
"This was particularly true of those young
women whose sexual partners were men with
whom they shared a close emotional relation
ship.
Twenty of the students studied had been
involved in extensive petting, but not inter
course. The great majority (if this group said
they were satisfied with an enjoyed these ac
tivities. Half were engaged or very deeply
involved emotionally with their partners.
All those studied were interviewed several
times annually between their freshman and
senior years, with information on sexual alti
tudes and behavior comprising only a small
part of a comprehensive analysis of their per
sonal development.
ANSWERS TO specific questions which
were asked of large samples of students
showed a substantial change in attitudes over

sexual code of seniors may in essence he
viewed as rather conservative. Being in love
or being involved seriously with a man per
mits varying degrees of physical intimacy
but usually not intercourse.
"The standards by which other students
are judged are somewhat more liberal."
Some illustrative remarks by seniors:

"My ideas have changed, not my behavior.
I still hold to my old beliefs, but I question
them more." "I've changed a lot. I'm a little
more experienced. I don't condemn others
who have sex relations, but it's not for me. I
don't care what others do. I don't think I'd
care much for someone who had no moral
values sexually, but I detest professional vir
gins, too." "I used to think it was horrible not
to be a virgin. I'm more realistic now. But 1
still think it would be nice for me to be a
virgin." "I'm a little more broad-minded about
others, not myself." "If you're very much in
love, I think now it's all right to go ahead. I
didn't use to. But I don't think I would."
AS AN ABSTRACT VIRTUK, virginity has
little meaning to these women students, Freed
man continued. But the great majority of stu
dents draw the line at premarital intercourse
for personal or interpersonal reasons. These
include fear of pregnancy, feelings of "guilt,"
emotional upset" or "loss of self-respect," and
lack of certainty about the permanence of re
lationships.
"Underlying many of the explanations
seems to lie an unexpressed sense of caution
or inhibition," he noted. "The explanations
often seemed to be but vague surface mani
festations of deep-lying and complex senti
ments that were dimly comprehended.
"As one senior put it: 'When I was a fresh
man, I thought sex was sacred to marriage.
Now I think more of the risk. After so many
years, naturally we do more than hold hands.
But behind this is that old feeling. 1 couldn't
have intercourse before marriage.'"

Some illustrative remarks by seniors:

"My ideas have changed, not my behavior.
I still hold to my old beliefs, but I question
them more." "I've changed a lot. I'm a little
more experienced. I don't condemn others
who have sex relations, but it's not for me. I
don't care what others do. I don't think I'd
care much for someone who had no moral
values sexually, but I detest professional vir
gins, too." "I used to think it was horrible not
to be a virgin. I'm more realistic now. But 1
still think it would be nice for me to be a
virgin." "I'm a little more broad-minded about
others, not myself." "If you're very much in
love, I think now it's all right to go ahead. I
didn't use to. But I don't think I would."
AS AN ABSTRACT VIRTUK, virginity has
little meaning to these women students, Freed
man continued. But the great majority of stu
dents draw the line at premarital intercourse
for personal or interpersonal reasons. These
include fear of pregnancy, feelings of "guilt,"
emotional upset" or "loss of self-respect," and
lack of certainty about the permanence of re
lationships.
"Underlying many of the explanations
seems to lie an unexpressed sense of caution
or inhibition," he noted. "The explanations
often seemed to be but vague surface mani
festations of deep-lying and complex senti
ments that were dimly comprehended.
"As one senior put it: 'When I was a fresh
man, I thought sex was sacred to marriage.
Now I think more of the risk. After so many
years, naturally we do more than hold hands.
But behind this is that old feeling. 1 couldn't
have intercourse before marriage.'"
Contrary to popular opinion, sexual per
missiveness has not swept the American col
lege campus, a Stanford researcher contends.
Mervin B. Freedman, assistant dean of
undergraduate education and a research asso
ciate at the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, bases this conclusion on a detailed
study of ati Eastern women's college in which
•1!) students were interviewed for four years
and several thousands ol' students were tested,
and on an historical survey of research on
the sexual behavior of women undergraduates.
His findings, in brief:
• Three-fourths or more of America's un
married college women are virgins;
• Premarital intercourse among college
women is usually restricted to their future
husbands; and
• Promiscuity is probably confined to a
very small percentage of college women
probably a lower proportion than high school
girls.
WHIEE ATTITUDES toward sex are often
liberalized in college, "the Puritan heritage
has by no means passed from the American
scene," Freedman writes in the current issue
of the Merrill-Palmer Quarterly.
"It is probable that the incidence of non
virginity among college women has increased
. . . little since the 1930'5," he adds. "The great
change in sexual behavior and mores since
1900 lias been in freedom of attitude and in
petting. . . .
"Starting from a base of quite low inci
dence, nonvirginity among college women
probably doubled or trebled in the years fol

lowing World War I. It is likely that this in
crease was stabilized by 1930 or thereabouts.
It may be, however, that the incidence of pre
marital intercourse has risen slowly since
1930, particularly among engaged couples....
"IT .MAY WKI-L BE that American college
students have evolved patterns of sexual be
havior that will remain stable for some time
to come. The behavior consists of petting, in
tercourse among some engaged couples, and
early marriage."
A trained clinical psychologist and author
of a number of papers on personality develop
ment in college students, Freedman indicated
that belief in a fixed set of ethics, based on
religious dogma, has waned since World War
I.
"So it is that few college students can
propound with any conviction ethical argu
ments for sexual abstinence or continence,"
he notes. "Accordingly, they are loathe to con
demn the behavior of others.
"This does not mean, however, that the
feelings that underlay these fixed convictions
have disappeared. Puritan sentiments, inhibi
tion of appetites and instincts, are a strong
feature of American middle class life. They
have been and are still being passed from
generation to generation.
"( ONSEQI ENTLY, most college women
behave conventionally, even though they may
not adhere to any specific moral code."
Among the 49 women students studied in

33 engaged in petting, and 11 experienced
intercourse. Only three of the latter group

were "uninhibited" in their sexual behavior,

to be a virgin. I'm more realistic now. But 1

AS AN ABSTRACT VIRTUK, virginity has
little meaning to these women students, Freed
man continued. But the great majority of stu
dents draw the line at premarital intercourse
for personal or interpersonal reasons. These
include fear of pregnancy, feelings of "guilt,"
emotional upset" or "loss of self-respect," and
lack of certainty about the permanence of re
lationships.
"Underlying many of the explanations
seems to lie an unexpressed sense of caution
or inhibition," he noted. "The explanations
often seemed to be but vague surface mani
festations of deep-lying and complex senti
ments that were dimly comprehended.
"As one senior put it: 'When I was a fresh
man, I thought sex was sacred to marriage.
Now I think more of the risk. After so many
years, naturally we do more than hold hands.
But behind this is that old feeling. 1 couldn't
have intercourse before marriage.'"
Contrary to popular opinion, sexual per
missiveness has not swept the American col
lege campus, a Stanford researcher contends.
Mervin B. Freedman, assistant dean of
undergraduate education and a research asso
ciate at the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, bases this conclusion on a detailed
study of ati Eastern women's college in which
•1!) students were interviewed for four years
and several thousands ol' students were tested,
and on an historical survey of research on
the sexual behavior of women undergraduates.
His findings, in brief:
• Three-fourths or more of America's un
married college women are virgins;
• Premarital intercourse among college
women is usually restricted to their future
husbands; and
• Promiscuity is probably confined to a
very small percentage of college women
probably a lower proportion than high school
girls.
WHIEE ATTITUDES toward sex are often
liberalized in college, "the Puritan heritage
has by no means passed from the American
scene," Freedman writes in the current issue
of the Merrill-Palmer Quarterly.
"It is probable that the incidence of non
virginity among college women has increased
. . . little since the 1930'5," he adds. "The great
change in sexual behavior and mores since
1900 lias been in freedom of attitude and in
petting. . . .
"Starting from a base of quite low inci
dence, nonvirginity among college women
probably doubled or trebled in the years fol

lowing World War I. It is likely that this in
crease was stabilized by 1930 or thereabouts.
It may be, however, that the incidence of pre
marital intercourse has risen slowly since
1930, particularly among engaged couples....
"IT .MAY WKI-L BE that American college
students have evolved patterns of sexual be
havior that will remain stable for some time
to come. The behavior consists of petting, in
tercourse among some engaged couples, and
early marriage."
A trained clinical psychologist and author
of a number of papers on personality develop
ment in college students, Freedman indicated
that belief in a fixed set of ethics, based on
religious dogma, has waned since World War
I.
"So it is that few college students can
propound with any conviction ethical argu
ments for sexual abstinence or continence,"
he notes. "Accordingly, they are loathe to con
demn the behavior of others.
"This does not mean, however, that the
feelings that underlay these fixed convictions
have disappeared. Puritan sentiments, inhibi
tion of appetites and instincts, are a strong
feature of American middle class life. They
have been and are still being passed from
generation to generation.
"( ONSEQI ENTLY, most college women
behave conventionally, even though they may
not adhere to any specific moral code."
Among the 49 women students studied in
depth, five limited their experience to kissing,
33 engaged in petting, and 11 experienced
intercourse. Only three of the latter group

were "uninhibited" in their sexual behavior,
engaging in intercourse when they were not
deeply involved emotionally with men.
When asked how they felt about their sex
life, SO per cent of the 49 students studied said
they were content with the status quo.
While there was some tendency for those
who had restricted their activity to kissing or
light petting to be dissatisfied, they were
unanimous in asserting they could not or
would not seek out sexual encounters as such,
Freedman said. "Sexual gratification . . . could
emerge only in the context of a relationship
of some seriousness with a man.
"AMONG THE students who had engaged
in intercourse, the predominant attitude was
one of enjoyment and satisfaction," he added.
"This was particularly true of those young
women whose sexual partners were men with
whom they shared a close emotional relation
ship.
Twenty of the students studied had been
involved in extensive petting, but not inter
course. The great majority (if this group said
they were satisfied with an enjoyed these ac
tivities. Half were engaged or very deeply
involved emotionally with their partners.
All those studied were interviewed several
times annually between their freshman and

students have evolved patterns of sexual be
havior that will remain stable for some time
to come. The behavior consists of petting, in
tercourse among some engaged couples, and
early marriage."
A trained clinical psychologist and author
of a number of papers on personality develop
ment in college students, Freedman indicated
that belief in a fixed set of ethics, based on
religious dogma, has waned since World War
I.
"So it is that few college students can
propound with any conviction ethical argu
ments for sexual abstinence or continence,"
he notes. "Accordingly, they are loathe to con
demn the behavior of others.
"This does not mean, however, that the
feelings that underlay these fixed convictions
have disappeared. Puritan sentiments, inhibi
tion of appetites and instincts, are a strong
feature of American middle class life. They
have been and are still being passed from
generation to generation.
"( ONSEQI ENTLY, most college women
behave conventionally, even though they may
not adhere to any specific moral code."
Among the 49 women students studied in
depth, five limited their experience to kissing,
33 engaged in petting, and 11 experienced
intercourse. Only three of the latter group

were "uninhibited" in their sexual behavior,
engaging in intercourse when they were not
deeply involved emotionally with men.
When asked how they felt about their sex
life, SO per cent of the 49 students studied said
they were content with the status quo.
While there was some tendency for those
who had restricted their activity to kissing or
light petting to be dissatisfied, they were
unanimous in asserting they could not or
would not seek out sexual encounters as such,
Freedman said. "Sexual gratification . . . could
emerge only in the context of a relationship
of some seriousness with a man.
"AMONG THE students who had engaged
in intercourse, the predominant attitude was
one of enjoyment and satisfaction," he added.
"This was particularly true of those young
women whose sexual partners were men with
whom they shared a close emotional relation
ship.
Twenty of the students studied had been
involved in extensive petting, but not inter
course. The great majority (if this group said
they were satisfied with an enjoyed these ac
tivities. Half were engaged or very deeply
involved emotionally with their partners.
All those studied were interviewed several
times annually between their freshman and
senior years, with information on sexual alti
tudes and behavior comprising only a small
part of a comprehensive analysis of their per
sonal development.

EVKN SO, Freedman notes, "the personal
sexual code of seniors may in essence he
viewed as rather conservative. Being in love
or being involved seriously with a man per
mits varying degrees of physical intimacy
but usually not intercourse.
"The standards by which other students
are judged are somewhat more liberal."
Some illustrative remarks by seniors:

"My ideas have changed, not my behavior.
I still hold to my old beliefs, but I question
them more." "I've changed a lot. I'm a little
more experienced. I don't condemn others
who have sex relations, but it's not for me. I
don't care what others do. I don't think I'd
care much for someone who had no moral
values sexually, but I detest professional vir
gins, too." "I used to think it was horrible not
to be a virgin. I'm more realistic now. But 1
still think it would be nice for me to be a
virgin." "I'm a little more broad-minded about
others, not myself." "If you're very much in
love, I think now it's all right to go ahead. I
didn't use to. But I don't think I would."
AS AN ABSTRACT VIRTUK, virginity has
little meaning to these women students, Freed
man continued. But the great majority of stu
dents draw the line at premarital intercourse
for personal or interpersonal reasons. These
include fear of pregnancy, feelings of "guilt,"
emotional upset" or "loss of self-respect," and
lack of certainty about the permanence of re
lationships.
"Underlying many of the explanations
seems to lie an unexpressed sense of caution
or inhibition," he noted. "The explanations
often seemed to be but vague surface mani
festations of deep-lying and complex senti
ments that were dimly comprehended.
"As one senior put it: 'When I was a fresh
man, I thought sex was sacred to marriage.
Now I think more of the risk. After so many
years, naturally we do more than hold hands.
But behind this is that old feeling. 1 couldn't
have intercourse before marriage.'"
Contrary to popular opinion, sexual per
missiveness has not swept the American col
lege campus, a Stanford researcher contends.
Mervin B. Freedman, assistant dean of
undergraduate education and a research asso
ciate at the Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, bases this conclusion on a detailed
study of ati Eastern women's college in which
•1!) students were interviewed for four years
and several thousands ol' students were tested,
and on an historical survey of research on
the sexual behavior of women undergraduates.
His findings, in brief:
• Three-fourths or more of America's un
married college women are virgins;
• Premarital intercourse among college
women is usually restricted to their future
husbands; and
• Promiscuity is probably confined to a
very small percentage of college women
probably a lower proportion than high school
girls.
WHIEE ATTITUDES toward sex are often
liberalized in college, "the Puritan heritage
has by no means passed from the American
scene," Freedman writes in the current issue
of the Merrill-Palmer Quarterly.
"It is probable that the incidence of non
virginity among college women has increased
. . . little since the 1930'5," he adds. "The great
change in sexual behavior and mores since
1900 lias been in freedom of attitude and in
petting. . . .
"Starting from a base of quite low inci
dence, nonvirginity among college women
probably doubled or trebled in the years fol

lowing World War I. It is likely that this in
crease was stabilized by 1930 or thereabouts.
It may be, however, that the incidence of pre
marital intercourse has risen slowly since
1930, particularly among engaged couples....
