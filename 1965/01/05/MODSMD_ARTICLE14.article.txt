# STANFORD NOW 5-2
## Hinckley Paces Holiday Attack 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's basketball team
shunned the ordinary holiday
tournament trail and came out
ihe better for the experience.
Coach Howie Dallmar's crew
took three decisive victories and
suffered a narrow one point loss
in four vacation-time contests.
THE FIRST GAME, Dec. 19,
was a 61-60 loss to Oregon State
at Portland. After that, Stanford
took three consecutive wins. Dec.
22 the Indians stomped the Uni
versity of Oregon, 74-56.
Whatever Christmas cheer the
team absorbed over the holiday
it gave them a boost on the court
as they squashed Tulane, 93-65,
and beat Wyoming, 88-75, going
away.
Guard Kent Hinckley was the
big gun in three of the games.
Versus Oregon State, in a non
league tussle, Hinckley scored 21
points, 15 of them in the second

hall". His effort wasn't enough,
though, as Oregon State made
their two point halftime lead do
the trick, winning by one slim
point.
Bob Bedell, recovering from a
broken cheekbone, pumped
through 15 tallies. Jim Jarvis led
the Beavers with 18 points. The
Beaver captain hit two clutch
free throws in the closing seconds
to give his team the win.
JACK GILBERT and Clayton
Raaka sparked the Indians to vic
lory three nights later against
the Oregon Ducks. Raaka popped
in 13 points to compliment his
usual fine job of rebounding. Gil
bert sank 12 of 12 free throws
to give him half of his 24 points.
Stanford was in control of the
game all the way as their 12
point halftime lead stretched into
a final 18 point lead.
Jim Barnett, a California prod
uct, scored 22 for the Ducks.

Against Tulane, Coach Da 1 1-
mar's only problem was which
reserves to put in first. Tulane's
headaches were a new coach and
a young team.
Hinckley led Stanford's scor
ing with nine buckets and on e
free throw. Ray Kosanke hit the
cords for 13, Craig Cordes sank
11, and Bedell bombed the basket
for 10.
ONE OF THE three sopho
mores starting for Tulane, A 1 An
drew, worked the nets over for
26 points.
Once more, with Wyoming as
opponent, Stanford stretched out
a close halftime lead for a solid
victory. The Indians were ahead
by five at ihe intermission and
won by 13, 88-75.
Bedell, Kosanke, Hinckley, and
Cordes outscored the entire Wy
oming offense by themselves.
They collected 76 tallies.
Bedell hit 23, Kosanke 21, Hin
ckley 16, and Cordes 16.
