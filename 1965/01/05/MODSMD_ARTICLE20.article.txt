## A 						Backward Glance Before Going Ahead 
### PETE EAKLAND 
The perfect way for a calendar year to end for a Stanford sports j
1 fan is to look upon the achievements of the past season with pride
and to look forward with optimism to the remaining two. For the|
most part, pride and optimism are valid points of view of the Stan-j
ford sporting scene.
PEGS IN TIIE RIGHT HOLES
The football team, picked by many to be the darkhorse of the
conference, galloped north, south, and east in search of victims,
although barely eluded several times, it found enough prey to finish j
the season with a 5-5 record, respectable but disappointing when it
is observed that an 8-2 or even 9-1 record (.the Notre Dame game was i
obviously out of reach» was possible.
Next year, Coach John Ralston will have many starters return-
I ing, including most of the defensive team, the starting running backs,
and several key performers in the offensive line. Significantly, they
will all probably remain at the positions they played this year. The
pegs all seem to be in the right holes.
During the past season, the start ing lineup did not round into j
shape until the end of the season. Dave Lewis before emerging as
the number one signal-caller had a brief tour of duty at the flanker
position. Jake Lodato was a defensive specialist until getting a shot
at flankerback. Tom Ross and Glenn Myers were switched to de
fense, Gary Fettigrew moved into the starling defensive line, and
Dick Ragsdale became a defensive safety after starting the season
| as a flanker.
j Speedy Bob Blunt developed quickly as a runner, so much in
| fact, Ralston plans to revamp his offensive formation so that Ray
1 Handley and Blunt will botli be on the field at the same time and
j available to run the ball.
Next year will be the first year all Ihe players will have been
coached only by .Ralston. The Ralston regime which prides itself on
defense but still realizes the offense primarily does the scoring thai
i wins the games, will have completely supplanted the Jack Curtice
; era. Also, by winning three of its last four games, the Indians have
> started a winning tradition. Nothing inspires more than the smell
! of success, or I might add. the smell of roses.
BOWL PARTICIPANTS
j Three seniors on the 1964 squad were selected to play for the
West in the recent Shrine game: Jack Chappie, Bob Nichols, and
I Dick Ragsdale. Chappie and Nichols played on the defense? unit and
squished through the Kezar ooze to get in on a large percentage of
the tackles.
Chappie, who was selected several months ago, and Nichols, who 1
only several days ago was invited to participate, are currently in
Hawaii practicing for the Hula Bowl to be played this Saturday.
The water polo squad, although not able to duplicate its record
; of the previous year, tied for Ihe conference championship with USC
1 and UCLA. Recently selected for the all-conference team were Bill
I Ready, a unanimous choice, and Mike Eshleman. Brian Beck was
i on the second team.
The cross-country squad after losing to San Jose State in an
invitational meet early in the season went undefeated during the
remainder of the campaign. The highpoint was the revenge victory
over the Spartans. In fact, the meet pitting the Indians against the
defending NCAA champs was one of big sporting thrills of the fall
! quarter. The Spartans were strong favorites, but determined per- '
formances by the last three Stanford runner's gave the Indians the
victory.
Ineligibility problems, which plagued ihe soccer team in 1963, !
ruined any chance the Indians might have of placing high in the !
i NCAA finals. Several of the seniors on the squad had participated j
on the varsity as freshmen and were not eligible for NCAA laurels, j
i Henry McCalla did r un in ihe meet to finish off a fine running career
i at Stanford.

BOWL PARTICIPANTS
j Three seniors on the 1964 squad were selected to play for the
West in the recent Shrine game: Jack Chappie, Bob Nichols, and
I Dick Ragsdale. Chappie and Nichols played on the defense? unit and
squished through the Kezar ooze to get in on a large percentage of
the tackles.
Chappie, who was selected several months ago, and Nichols, who 1
only several days ago was invited to participate, are currently in
Hawaii practicing for the Hula Bowl to be played this Saturday.
The water polo squad, although not able to duplicate its record
; of the previous year, tied for Ihe conference championship with USC
1 and UCLA. Recently selected for the all-conference team were Bill
I Ready, a unanimous choice, and Mike Eshleman. Brian Beck was
i on the second team.
The cross-country squad after losing to San Jose State in an
invitational meet early in the season went undefeated during the
remainder of the campaign. The highpoint was the revenge victory
over the Spartans. In fact, the meet pitting the Indians against the
defending NCAA champs was one of big sporting thrills of the fall
! quarter. The Spartans were strong favorites, but determined per- '
formances by the last three Stanford runner's gave the Indians the
victory.
Ineligibility problems, which plagued ihe soccer team in 1963, !
ruined any chance the Indians might have of placing high in the !
i NCAA finals. Several of the seniors on the squad had participated j
on the varsity as freshmen and were not eligible for NCAA laurels, j
i Henry McCalla did r un in ihe meet to finish off a fine running career
i at Stanford.
The perfect way for a calendar year to end for a Stanford sports j
1 fan is to look upon the achievements of the past season with pride
and to look forward with optimism to the remaining two. For the|
most part, pride and optimism are valid points of view of the Stan-j
ford sporting scene.
PEGS IN TIIE RIGHT HOLES
The football team, picked by many to be the darkhorse of the
conference, galloped north, south, and east in search of victims,
although barely eluded several times, it found enough prey to finish j
the season with a 5-5 record, respectable but disappointing when it
is observed that an 8-2 or even 9-1 record (.the Notre Dame game was i
obviously out of reach» was possible.
Next year, Coach John Ralston will have many starters return-
I ing, including most of the defensive team, the starting running backs,
and several key performers in the offensive line. Significantly, they
will all probably remain at the positions they played this year. The
pegs all seem to be in the right holes.
During the past season, the start ing lineup did not round into j
shape until the end of the season. Dave Lewis before emerging as
the number one signal-caller had a brief tour of duty at the flanker
position. Jake Lodato was a defensive specialist until getting a shot
at flankerback. Tom Ross and Glenn Myers were switched to de
fense, Gary Fettigrew moved into the starling defensive line, and
Dick Ragsdale became a defensive safety after starting the season
| as a flanker.
j Speedy Bob Blunt developed quickly as a runner, so much in
| fact, Ralston plans to revamp his offensive formation so that Ray
1 Handley and Blunt will botli be on the field at the same time and
j available to run the ball.
Next year will be the first year all Ihe players will have been
coached only by .Ralston. The Ralston regime which prides itself on
defense but still realizes the offense primarily does the scoring thai
i wins the games, will have completely supplanted the Jack Curtice
; era. Also, by winning three of its last four games, the Indians have
> started a winning tradition. Nothing inspires more than the smell
! of success, or I might add. the smell of roses.
