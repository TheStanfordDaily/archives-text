# The 						AWS Survey
## 
### 
'file AWS Social Regulations Committee has
announced that it will conduct a survey of
Stanford women and their parents to collect
opinions about the nature and purposes of wom
en's social regulations.
The survey is the first encouraging sign that
the AWS committee is approaching its task of
making specific recommendations for liberaliza
tion of the rules with an appreciation of the deli
cate politics involved.
It is certain that no proposal will be consid
ered seriously by the Dean's Office or its super
iors if the proposal does not have the support of
Stanford women; the survey will at least deter
mine whether the clamor for liberalization is as
numerically strong as it has been vocally loud.
If it is not—and many administrators suspect it
is not—then the show is over.
Furthermore, the survey will spotlight why
the women think there is need lor a change and
what direction that change should take. Stan
ford women are al a tactical disadvantage when
someone asks why—all of a sudden—they wish
to stay out after 2:30 a.m.
There are, we think, valid and compelling
answers, which the survey should bring out.
It is not so much that everyone wants to
stay out later, as that the)' don't want to be told
they shouldn't. The University should recognize
the inconsistency between the Fundamental
Standard, which assumes a high level of matur

ity and integrity, and the present women's social
regulations, which assume exactly the opposite.
But at the same time students should recog
nize that the University has to deal with the
public —with potential donors and potential
alumni or parents of alumni—whose opinions can
he swayed by the faintest suggestion of over
liberality or possible promiscuity, especially as
amplified by the distinguished journals of the
Bay Area. The AWS recommendations must take
public opinion into account.
A survey of the parents of Stanford women
—who are highly representative of the people
with whom the University must deal—can be
most helpful in providing information for a
proposal that has a chance of gaining administra
tion approval.
It may be that a proposal such as that of the
Women's Judicial Council, which advocated a
flat 9 a.m. sign-in, will just not be swallowed
without compromise—perhaps that of making it
applicable only to women over 21, who are
legally independent, and to those with parents'
permission.
In any case, the survey is a step in the right
direction. If the AWS can determine the prevail
ing attitudes of women and parents and shape
its recommendations with an eye toward the
political realities with which the University is
faced, then there is a good chance that the new
year will see a beneficial liberalization of wom
en's regulations.
