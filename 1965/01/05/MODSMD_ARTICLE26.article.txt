## Coed Housing Gets Positive Response On Other Campuses 
### 
Dear Sir:
Recently I reviewed the liter
ature on coeducational housing
and now wonder whether some
observations on the subject might
be of interest. Though many va
riations of coeducational hous
ing exist, for present, purposes
the definition will be "adjacent
buildings with restricted access
to single sex living units, but
with maximum coeducational use
of all public areas such as dining
rooms, recreation rooms, and
lounges."
The literature revealed that
some form of coeducational hous
ing is in operation on many col
lege and university campuses
across the country including In
diana University, the University
of Illinois, and the University of
the Pacific at Stockton. The gen
eral consensus of administrators
at these and other institutions
was that their programs were a
success. Unfortunately the liter
ature is both scanty and unscien
tific; probably the most realistic
summary of it would be to say
that the worst fears of those con
sidering coeducational housing,
such as lower morals and schol
astic performance, seem unfound
ed in the light of experience else
where. This alone, however, is in
adequate evidence on which to
promote a coeducational housing
program.
A growing body of research has
been and is being performed in
areas peripheral to coeducation
al housing. Many studies demon
strate the importance students at
tribute to their residence hall as
sociations. Other studies have
examined th e workings of stu
dent peer groups and the bases
for the formation of student
friendships. Yet another area of
research is in attempting to evalu
ate the effects of college on
student personality development.
Once again, the present state of
research in these areas, taken by
itself, is insufficient to persuade
a competent administration to

adopt coeducational housing.
Those interested in the pros
pects of coeducational housing
should not, however, despair at
this point. Assuming a favorable
institutional philosophy, it might
well bo argued that the positive
response to the programs else
where and the research findings
on the nature and outcomes of
the undergraduate years give am
ple reason for initiating an ex
periment using coeducational
housing as the independent vari
, able. Control groups of both
males and females would have
to be set up. and it might bo
wise to establish a second expe
rimental group with a further in
dependent variable such as ready
availability of counseling help.
1 The dependent variables would
1 consist of criteria measuring the
educational objectives of the in
| stitution and might include per
i sonality as well as academic and
intellectual development.
The above may seem a c o o 1
treatment of a potentially hot
subject, but then, perhaps, this is
j the way it should be approached
, at an institution of higher learn
ing.
Sincerely,

• Turkey Feathers
Dear Disgruntled
Stanford Woman:
We can understand your cha
grin at being singled out, the
tenth most attractive girl out of
any ten. However, your biting
remarks (perhaps a little on the
defensive?) concerning the prow
ess of the Stanford male, do little
to alleviate your obvious prob
lem. Let's look at this thing hon
estly. Stanford accepts a limited
number of female students each
year. The high academic stan
dards and the demanding require
ments as to college board scores,
successfully screen out a major
ity of these feminine applicants.
Who is left?
1. The girl who was so atroci
ously unattractive in high school
that she was forced to study as
a compensation factor; or; 2. the
bright attractive girl who made
it. on charm and a superior mind.
Realistically, Stanford's feminine
student body consists primarily
of the former.
This is not to say that good
Stanford women cannot be found.
For intelligence, beauty and
breeding, the good woman at
Stanford is unexcelled anywhere
in the country. We just thought
it was high time we cleared the
aii- of some of the turkey feathers
that have been filling the pages
of The Daily concerning th e
"Stanford Dating Myth."
In all sincerity,
