## Organized Labor Plans Assault On States' Rights 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
For several years we have been hearing that states rights must
j be put aside because they are used as an instrument for the oppres
sion of Negroes in the South. Otherwise, one is led to assume,
they are perfectly all right: good, commendable instruments tor
the preservation of the federal system.
Advocates of states rights who deplore some of the uses to

which they are put have neverthe
less maintained that it is impos
sible to preserve states rights in
one area and not in another:
either the states are left free to
run their own affairs, subject to
the Constitution, or they aren't.
Undermine the concept and you
undermine ihe sovereignty.
Labor's Plan
Last month the heads of th e
American Federation of Labor
and tiie Congress of Industrial
Organizations met to map their
strategy to abolish the right of
the states to outlaw the union
shop. ''We have enough votes to
do it," a spokesman for the AFL/-
CIO crowe I "22! congressmen
beholden to organized labor." The
idea is to repeal section 148 of
the Taft-Hartley Act which spe
cifically acknowledges the right of
the individual states to decide for
themselves whether membership
in a union can be a legal prerequi
site to employment.
Turn about is fair play. During
tlie years in question, the liberals
have been saying to the conserva
tives: "You don't really believe
in or care about states rights. You
just want authority to retain seg
regation." Let the conservatives
now say to the liberals, "You have
maintained that you respect the
idea of states rights, which you
ask to put aside only when they
stand in the way of human rights.
Will you now oppose this move by
the labor unions against the full
exercise by the states of their
right to defend the man who
doesn't want to join a labor
union?"
Liberals Will Consent
The regrettable answer is that
with few exceptions, Ihe liberals
will not oppose this assault by a
vested interest (organized labor)
on states rights. The dutiful con
gressman, unless overwhelmed by
an unambiguous expression of
public opinion, will vote as Messrs.
Meany and Reuther tell them to.
The practical effect of the pas
sage of such a bill would be the
invalidation of laws on the sta
tute books of twenty states, laws
that give a worker the right to
work without the prior require
ment that he join a union. (Inci
dentally, the figures show that
in most cases the passage of

j right-to-work laws was not fol
! lowed by a mass exodus of work
-1 ers from labor unions, and in no
case by any diminution in wages.)
The clamor by the labor union
hierarchy is a brazen decision to
use the coercive power of llie
government for one's own pur
poses. And the use of coercive
power against others for one's
own purposes is by definition anti
social. II is as though a business
monopoly proposed a federal law
denying to the states the right
to outlaw contracts that gave
work only to laborers who could
prove they drank only Campbell
soups.
No Choice Lett To States
It is perfectly consistent, it
should however be pointed out,
I for an individual to oppose a
i right-to-work law in his own state,
i and nevertheless oppose the blitz
-1 krieg the labor unions are pre
paring to launch on Washington.
One of the best features of o u r
j system, the Federalist papers
| pointed out, is that other states
i can profit from experiments un-
I dertaken in given states; and re
; vise, or maintain, their laws ac
; eordingly. As it stands now. the
30 states may, on the basis of the
experience of the 20, choose to
| adopt right-to-work laws or not,
I according as they prove socially
I useful or desirable. Under the
' proposed system, all the states
i would be left without any choice.
It is an interesting coincidence
that the strength of labor unions
has ceased, during the past ten
I years, to grow with the popula
tion. It is for precisely this rea
| son that the unions hunger more
! and more for artificial power, the
| kind of power only governments
l can confer. They want power to
protect themselves against com-
I petition, and against the dawning
i realization by the preponderant
non-union working class, that
; many of the labor unions have
! become associations for the ex
traction of relative advantages
for a privileged class of workers
at the expense of the consumers,
most of whom are unprivileged
workers.
