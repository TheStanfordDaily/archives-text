In Adam or in Christ?
Regardless of your theory or views concerning the origin of man, there is no
escaping our universal brotherhood one with another. If you'll give thought and
prayer to the subject of the family tree of man you'll soon discover that the Biblical
view is diametrically opposed to the hypothesis of an ascending evolution of man
which skirts around the all-important issue of sin and death. The Bible says we sin
because we are "in Adam," descended from our fallen first parents. Death is in the
world because of -in, that is, because man has been cut oil from his relationship
with the Author of life, Jesus Christ. The New Testament extends freely to all of
lis today Cod's offer of reconciliation and restoration to Him. In a single sentence
the problem and the solution can be summed up: "The wages of sin is death, but
the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
As Adam is the federal head of a fallen race, so Jesus Christ, by virtue of Hi;
death and resurrection, has become the federal head of a New Creation. Becoming
a Christian removes an individual from his relationship "in Adam" and transfers him
into a new relationship "in Christ." Study the following passage from Romans chapter
5, and then, if you have not yet done so let Got! place you "in Christ" today.
"When Adam sinned the entire human race was declared guilty. His sin brought
death into the world, and so everything began to grow old and die. (We know that
it was Adam's sin that caused this and not each person dying because of his own
sins because although of course people were sinning from the time of Adam until
Moses. God ilid not in those days judge them guilty of death for breaking His laws
because He bad not yet given His laws to them, nor told theni what lh 1 wanted
them to do. So when they died it was not for these sins of their own; and since they
tlumselvi - hid never disobeyed God's special law against eating the forbidden fruit,
as Adatn bad, there dying was not because of that. It was because, when Adam
sinned, all of us were declared guilty with him and began to die because of his sin).
What a contrast between Adam and Christ Who was yet to come. And what a dif
ference between man's sin and God's forgiveness. For this one man, Adam, brought
death to man through his sin. But this one man Jesus Christ, brought forgiveness
to many through God's mercy. Adam's one sin brought the penalty of death to many,
while Christ freely takes away many sins and gives glorious life instead.
"The sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to be king over all, but all who
will take God's gift of forgiveness and approval are kings of life because of this
one man. Jesus Christ. Yes, Adam's sin brought punishment to all, but Christ's act
of goodness makes tuen right with God, so that they can live. Adam caused many
to be sinners liecause In disobeyed God, and Christ caused many to lie made accept
able to God because he obeyed. The Ten Commandments were given so that .ill could
see the extent if tin ir failure to obey God's laws. But the more we see our sinfulness,
the more we see God's abounding grace forgiving u«. And so sin ruled ovrr men,
all men and brought them to death, but now God's kindness rules instead, giving us
right standing with God ind resulting iu eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord."

a Christian removes an individual from his relationship "in Adam" and transfers him
into a new relationship "in Christ." Study the following passage from Romans chapter
5, and then, if you have not yet done so let Got! place you "in Christ" today.
"When Adam sinned the entire human race was declared guilty. His sin brought
death into the world, and so everything began to grow old and die. (We know that
it was Adam's sin that caused this and not each person dying because of his own
sins because although of course people were sinning from the time of Adam until
Moses. God ilid not in those days judge them guilty of death for breaking His laws
because He bad not yet given His laws to them, nor told theni what lh 1 wanted
them to do. So when they died it was not for these sins of their own; and since they
tlumselvi - hid never disobeyed God's special law against eating the forbidden fruit,
as Adatn bad, there dying was not because of that. It was because, when Adam
sinned, all of us were declared guilty with him and began to die because of his sin).
What a contrast between Adam and Christ Who was yet to come. And what a dif
ference between man's sin and God's forgiveness. For this one man, Adam, brought
death to man through his sin. But this one man Jesus Christ, brought forgiveness
to many through God's mercy. Adam's one sin brought the penalty of death to many,
while Christ freely takes away many sins and gives glorious life instead.
"The sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to be king over all, but all who
will take God's gift of forgiveness and approval are kings of life because of this
one man. Jesus Christ. Yes, Adam's sin brought punishment to all, but Christ's act
of goodness makes tuen right with God, so that they can live. Adam caused many
to be sinners liecause In disobeyed God, and Christ caused many to lie made accept
able to God because he obeyed. The Ten Commandments were given so that .ill could
see the extent if tin ir failure to obey God's laws. But the more we see our sinfulness,
the more we see God's abounding grace forgiving u«. And so sin ruled ovrr men,
all men and brought them to death, but now God's kindness rules instead, giving us
right standing with God ind resulting iu eternal life through Jesus Christ, our Lord."

In Adam or in Christ?
Regardless of your theory or views concerning the origin of man, there is no
escaping our universal brotherhood one with another. If you'll give thought and
prayer to the subject of the family tree of man you'll soon discover that the Biblical
view is diametrically opposed to the hypothesis of an ascending evolution of man
which skirts around the all-important issue of sin and death. The Bible says we sin
because we are "in Adam," descended from our fallen first parents. Death is in the
world because of -in, that is, because man has been cut oil from his relationship
with the Author of life, Jesus Christ. The New Testament extends freely to all of
lis today Cod's offer of reconciliation and restoration to Him. In a single sentence
the problem and the solution can be summed up: "The wages of sin is death, but
the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23).
As Adam is the federal head of a fallen race, so Jesus Christ, by virtue of Hi;
death and resurrection, has become the federal head of a New Creation. Becoming
a Christian removes an individual from his relationship "in Adam" and transfers him
into a new relationship "in Christ." Study the following passage from Romans chapter
5, and then, if you have not yet done so let Got! place you "in Christ" today.
