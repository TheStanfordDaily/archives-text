• Medicare First Issue For Congress
WASHINGTON A revival and possible early decision of
the titanic struggle over hospital care for the aged under Social
Security took top hilling yesterday in the new 89th Congress.
Backers of the so-called "medicare" bill figured their chances of
putting it across this year were excellent in view of the Lyndon B.
Johnson landslide.
In rapid-fire order, Johnson will send to the Capitol next Tuesday
his aid-to-education program: two days later his plan for a new im
migration law "based on the work a man can do and not where he
was born or how he spells his name;" and then, before the inaugura
tion Jan. 20, messages on space and foreign aid.
• Officials Await Russ Answer
WASHINGTON U.S. officials are looking for a favorable So
viet response to President Johnson's invitation to Kremlin leaders
to visit America. Johnson might go to the Soviet Union, but seems
likely to travel first to Western Europe and Latin America.
Johnson raised the top-level visit prospect in a surprise passage
in his State of the Union message Monday night. The President
voiced hope that: 1. "the new Soviet leaders can visit America so
they can learn about this country at first hand," and 2. Johnson will
visit "some of our friends" in Europe and Latin America during 1963.
• Demos Strengthen Committee Posts
WASHINGTON — Democrats increased their strength on House
committees yesterday as leaders of both parties revamped the com
position of the committees, recognizing the heavy Democratic ma
jority voted in last November's elections.
The party ratio in two of the most important committees—Ways
and Means and Appropriations—was changed for the first time in
many years.
The change in Ways and Means is especially significant since it
was in this committee that heahh care was stuck last year. Under
the new ratio, enough Democrats favorable to the proposal could be
appointed virtually to insure action.
