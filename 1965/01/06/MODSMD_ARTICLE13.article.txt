# The 						Student 'Interns'
## ... And A Plan For Vallejo 
### 
A group of Stanford students
have proven that academia and
city planning can go together.
Prof. Thomas Williamson's 13
students in architecture have just
concluded a 10-week study of Val
lejo at the request of the Vallejo
Rotary Club and the city's Com
munity Development Council.
The crux of their findings:
Vallejo must fight to re-route
three proposed freeways which
threaten her future potential, a
group of Stanford student plan
ners have warned city officials.
They stressed that the freeways
must be diverted before they cut
off the city from its own water
front or bisect the proposed Lake
Chabot residential area.
Their -study, similar to one
made last year for the city of
Benicia, was laid before some 70
Vallejo civic leaders.

The presentation, via slides
and diagrams, emphasized that
Vallejo must halt its present "ur
ban sprawl" and tie itself together
as an entity through a revitalized
"Old Downtown" and a green
belted border.
The students pointed out that
Vallejo's historical importance
and its natural geographical
charm and beauty—"facing the
water and backed by rolling hills"
—were too valuable to be whittled
away for lack of a master plan.
Vallejo must make use of its

status as a transportation center
for the North Bay counties and
turn this to its advantage, the
students stressed.
Highways US 80. US 680 and
the proposed Napa Freeway, as
well as the huge projected growth
of the city, make ii imperative
that Vallejo join the Bay Area
Rapid Transit District.
The city should establish a
transportation center near the
waterfront where hydrofoil com
muters can dock, where helicop
ters can land, and where bus and
possibly rail connections can be
made for San Francisco and the
East Bay as well as growing areas
to the north and west.
Vallejo must continue to revive
its dying downtown area by estab
lishing it as "the place to go" for
all civic and community activities.
Historic buildings must be
turned into landmarks, while
I others too far gone must be re
moved. Some sort of shuttle-bus
"elephant train" arrangement
must be made between the pro
posed transport and civic centers,
serving perimeter parking areas
and minimizing downtown traffic.
Hillslopes must be shrewdly
planned for both single-family
residential and high-rise apart
ments, taking care that the hill
tops are left free with natural
growth and established as infor
mal par k and hiking areas.
If Vallejo can re-focus herself
as a civic entity and draw on this
potential, "it will be clear that
the city is destined for a produc
' tive and vital future"- possible
becoming "the best place to live
| in Northern California," the stu
dent report said.
