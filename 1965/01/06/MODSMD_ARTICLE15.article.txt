The $10,000 Research Corpora* j
| tion Award for 1964, one of the j
nation's highest scientific honors,
will be presented here Jan. 28 to !
Stanford Prof. William M. Fair
bank at a dinner in his honor.
Selection of the Stanford physi
cist was announced by J. William
Hinkley, president of the nonpro
fit Research Corporation, a foun
, dation which supports basic re
search in the natural sciences.
It will be the second successive
year a Stanford faculty member
has won the prize. Prof. Paul J.
Cohen, a mathematician, shared
the 1963 award.
Prof. Fairbank was cited by the j
award jury "for his elegant and j
precise performance of several !
crucial experiments of funda-'
mental importance in the field of I
low temperature physics, and
especially for his discovery of
flux quantization" in supercon
ductors.
Long recognized as a leading
expert in "cryogenics" or low-tem
perature physics, he is noted for
his studies of superfluidity a n d
superconductivity, strange phe
nomena which occur in certain
materials at temperatures near
absolute zero (-4159° F.).
One of Prof. Fairbank's cur
rent research projects involves de
velopment of a frictionless, super
conducting gyroscope to be or
bited in a satellite. It would en
able scientists to perform a deci
sive test of Einstein's Relativity ;
Theory of gravity which is not j
possible with present technology.'
