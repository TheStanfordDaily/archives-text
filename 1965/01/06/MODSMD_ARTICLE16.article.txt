# Quiet Rebellion At SFS
## 
### 
The college student's quest for
the good life stems more from a
quiet rebellion against society's
values than it does from satis
faction with the status quo, a
study of more than 100 freshmen
at San Francisco State College
suggests.
Findings of the study are sum
marized in a Psychological Re
ports monograph by Robert E.
Mogar of Stanford University's
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems. The U.S. Office of Edu
cation financed hi s research,
which was part of the student de
velopment study program at the
Institute.
"THAT REBELLION should
take th e form of passive disen
gagement (from society) rather
than positive protest indicates
that traditional values are not
oppressive so much as irrelevant
to many students," he declares.
Now with the Division of Psy
chology at Sari Francisco State,
Mogar believes students may turn
to what others have called "an
ideology of privacy" to replace
the "lapsed ideologies of public
action."
In common with many re
searchers at other colleges, Mo
gar found the San Francisco State

freshmen tend to "play ii cool"
and avoid personal entanglement
with broad social concerns. Given
a choice of 12 items, nearly two
thirds of tlie men <(52 per cent)
rated economic security, careers
and family life as their three most
important concerns after college.
ALMOST ALL TIIK students
who felt this way were majoring
in engineering, the physical sci
ences and business administra
tion. Almost without exception,
they placed family above career
and career above the welfare of
other people. Few discussed their
career in terms of intrinsic inter
est, social usefulness, or sell-ful
fillment.
