A recent inquiry into the choices
made by students shows tennis,
golf, weight training, and bowl
ing to be the sports having the
highest enrollment. Following
them are physical conditioning,
volleyball, soccer, swimming,
basketball, wrestling folk danc
ing, boxing, gymnastics, crew, div
ing, archery, and equitation in
that order.
Because of enrollment limita
tions imposed by lack of equip
ment and facilities, the number

of participants is not an accurate
indication of interest in that
sport. In some areas, more would
participate if given the opportun
ity. Attempts are made to provide
as much as possible physical edu
cation classes that are aligned
with student interest.
The university requires each
student to take a minimum of
I two physical education activities,
but only 11 per cent stop at this
i number. On the overage, a stu
dent takes physical education for
six quarters and participates in
three different physical education
activities. Thirty-three per cent
take more than six units.
Beginning this quarter, scuba
diving and judo are being offered.
Classes are limited in both of
these sports because of facility
limitations. The classes filled up
early on registration day, indicat
ing that the two areas of instruc
tion have a definite future at
Stanford.
The Department of Physical
Education and Athletics also plans
to experiment with a course offer
ing entitled Tournament Tennis
for those who wish to participate
in tennis on a regular basis, but
j who do not care to have instruc
! tion. It is not being offered for
J unit credit at the present time.
