# Managers Vital In Athletics Program
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The intercollegiate sport manager is an often unnoticed but
highly essential support in Stanford's vast athletic framework.
The Physical Education 190 series, Techniques of Athletic Manage-j
ment, is one equally fulfilling to the student as beneficial to the
Department of Athletics.
A manager's duties vary with his particular sport. A few of the J
things a manager does on a regular basis are: keep statistics, main- !
tain records, announce at meets, keep a scoreboard, handle a clock,
take split times, set up and watch over equipment, arrange visiting i
team facilities, and satisfy officials. He also handles travel arrange
ments for meals, transportation, and lodging for the entire team.
Looking at this list of duties, it is not hard to understand Head
Football Coach John Ralston's comment "Without our football man
agers, 1 am sure we would have to hire at least two full-time coaches
to handle their load."
The position of senior manager is one of prime responsibility on !
any team. His major duty is one of organization and coordination, j
He must develop a staff of managers that work together effectively !
and quickly. Skip Franich, senior football manager, had to, in Ral
ston's words, "make everything run smoothly." A coach is always
on the lookout for someone who shows promise of filling that rather
large bill.
COACHES RELY ON MANAGERS
When asked how much he depends on his managers, Ralston j
replied, "As much as we can." Wrestling coach Bill Leland noted that
there are a great many factors in running a meet, any one of which
could throw off the whole operation if not dealt with properly. Good
managers must organize carefully. Coaches depend on this organiza
tion and are able to devote a greater proportion of time to the team
itself.
Basketball mentor Howie Dallmar pointed out that "Players
have enough on their minds with competition. They ought to be able
to rely on their managers. Team morale may suffer otherwise."
Whether a manager earns the respect of the team he works with
depends on how well he does his job. Although a manager does not
participate in every facet of the sport that the athlete might, he
nonetheless represents a vital and appreciated member of the team.
Pete Kmetovic, rugby coach, expects a good manager to have an J
outgoing personality and be able to get along with the players. Al
though such a manager can boost team morale, Coach Leland ex
pressed his doubts as to whether a manager could actually inspire
a team. "A sincere, supporting interest is the esssential thing."
BENEFITS OF SPORT MANAGING
The benefits of intercollegiate sport managing come in many J
forms. team makes several trips, ranging from jaunts to San |
Jose and Berkeley, to flights to Los Angeles and Seattle. A first year
manager rarely gets the chance to accompany the team on one of
the longer trips, but travel opportunity increases with seniority.
Coach Dallmar stated that the important thing for a manger is
not recognition, but what he gets out of it personally. Yet a manager
receives recognition in terms of awards. A freshman manager is
presented with a plaque. A letterman's jacket, an "S" ring, and a
blanket are awarded for subsequent years of managing.
Managing provides the opportunity to accept responsibility, ob
tain a degree of prestige, and establish fulfilling personal relation
ships with players and coaches. Ron Freed, basketball senior man
ager. has stayed three years with the team primarily to maintain
contact with the sport. A 1 Faulconer, who started in 1963 as a water
polo assistant and now swimming senior manager, enjoys water polo
and swimming. He also points to trips, new acquaintances, and
credit.
Enrollment in PE 192, 193, or 194, Techniques of Athletic man
agement, satisfies a physical education activity requirement or can
be taken for one unit academic credit.
OPENINGS AVAILABLE
Good managers are at a premium, and at the moment there are
a good number of posts available for interested students. Swimming,
rugby, boxing, gymnastics, and basketball all could use more man
agers. Spring football practice will open more positions for managers.
Interested students should see Bob Butler, coordinator of the
sports management system, as soon as possible in the BAC business
office.

A manager's duties vary with his particular sport. A few of the J
things a manager does on a regular basis are: keep statistics, main- !
tain records, announce at meets, keep a scoreboard, handle a clock,
take split times, set up and watch over equipment, arrange visiting i
team facilities, and satisfy officials. He also handles travel arrange
ments for meals, transportation, and lodging for the entire team.
Looking at this list of duties, it is not hard to understand Head
Football Coach John Ralston's comment "Without our football man
agers, 1 am sure we would have to hire at least two full-time coaches
to handle their load."
The position of senior manager is one of prime responsibility on !
any team. His major duty is one of organization and coordination, j
He must develop a staff of managers that work together effectively !
and quickly. Skip Franich, senior football manager, had to, in Ral
ston's words, "make everything run smoothly." A coach is always
on the lookout for someone who shows promise of filling that rather
large bill.
COACHES RELY ON MANAGERS
When asked how much he depends on his managers, Ralston j
replied, "As much as we can." Wrestling coach Bill Leland noted that
there are a great many factors in running a meet, any one of which
could throw off the whole operation if not dealt with properly. Good
managers must organize carefully. Coaches depend on this organiza
tion and are able to devote a greater proportion of time to the team
itself.
Basketball mentor Howie Dallmar pointed out that "Players
have enough on their minds with competition. They ought to be able
to rely on their managers. Team morale may suffer otherwise."
Whether a manager earns the respect of the team he works with
depends on how well he does his job. Although a manager does not
participate in every facet of the sport that the athlete might, he
nonetheless represents a vital and appreciated member of the team.
Pete Kmetovic, rugby coach, expects a good manager to have an J
outgoing personality and be able to get along with the players. Al
though such a manager can boost team morale, Coach Leland ex
pressed his doubts as to whether a manager could actually inspire
a team. "A sincere, supporting interest is the esssential thing."
BENEFITS OF SPORT MANAGING
The benefits of intercollegiate sport managing come in many J
forms. team makes several trips, ranging from jaunts to San |
Jose and Berkeley, to flights to Los Angeles and Seattle. A first year
manager rarely gets the chance to accompany the team on one of
the longer trips, but travel opportunity increases with seniority.
Coach Dallmar stated that the important thing for a manger is
not recognition, but what he gets out of it personally. Yet a manager
receives recognition in terms of awards. A freshman manager is
presented with a plaque. A letterman's jacket, an "S" ring, and a
blanket are awarded for subsequent years of managing.
Managing provides the opportunity to accept responsibility, ob
tain a degree of prestige, and establish fulfilling personal relation
ships with players and coaches. Ron Freed, basketball senior man
ager. has stayed three years with the team primarily to maintain
contact with the sport. A 1 Faulconer, who started in 1963 as a water
polo assistant and now swimming senior manager, enjoys water polo
and swimming. He also points to trips, new acquaintances, and
credit.
