## The
						University vs. The Public: Don't Wait For The Revolution 
### 
Art Fisher

The conflict at the University of California has
pushed the local citizenry well past its normal
guise of politeness and euphemism, revealing the
ugly roots of suspicion and ignorance. Truly Ber
keley is under seige, but students will not long
he the only assailants. Soon enough the pious
guardians of public mythology will move with far
bigger guns on one of the world's greatest uni
versities.
The peculiar and precarious armistice between
an arrogant, confident university community and
th e apprehensive, comparatively uneducated
population that surrounds and supports it must
soon collapse. The demonstrations at Cal have
shown these groups to be co-existing on a basis
of overt misunderstanding and covert hostility.
The key issue is not free speech. More profound
and less easily resolved questions hopelessly com
plicate the simpler superficial issue. Who is best
suited to set policy for a university? What is the
place of the individual in a society dominated ba
ilie efficiency of mass economics? What should
be the province and function of education? What
does America demand of her youth? Will we toler
ate diversity? A semblance of agreement on these
questions would reduce the combatants in this
struggle to amicable negotiators. On these ques
tions the emotional battle is founded.
OFF TO HEEL
Americans generally would refuse to discuss
such issues and would offer nothing more than a
"here's my opinion and you can take it or go to
hell." Perhaps this is a fault of our parliamentary
concepts in which discussion is directed to specific
action (legislation) and seldom to general premises
or toward abstract understanding.
The public sees itself as a customer of the uni
versity. The public pays for a service and expects
to specify that service. A large number of the
population look on the educator as a highly-sophis
ticated hireling.
Almost all Americans profess to favor educa
tion as an undefined, abstract ideal, but the cri
terion applied to specific situations is usefulness.
An engineering education is a good education be
cause it leads to tangible rewards, hard money and
the production of physical objects.
The tragedy is that one's concept of what is
useful and what is not depends heavily on per
sonal experience, and the vast majority of the
populace is undereducated. An education gap
underlies this entire problem.
To the man who by limitation of training or
intellect reads novels only to discern the facts and
events, teachers of literature must seem to be
irrelevant fops. To those ignorant of the purposes
of modern art, all the greats since Ingres are
sloppy craftsmen or roaring fakers. All books
selected for the Classics Illustrated Comics series
should be read as part of the trial of adolescence,
an initiation into the tribe, a preparation for the
pretense of erudition at cocktail parties. Profes
sors should distribute these books at the beginning
of the term and collect them at the end, periodi
cally giving examinations to insure that the little
nippers do their work. The completion of his
torically-defined, mildly unpleasant tasks is inex
tricably involved in the popular concept of educu
tion.
ARTICULATION GAl*
Important also is the in loco parentis problem,
the problem beaten to death so frequently on
these pages. A pathetically inarticulate society of
parents desperately hopes that the university will
make men and women of human beings that they
themselves have only made into older children.
In America parents train their children to seek
reasons and then generally fail to provide reasons
that an intelligent person can accept, giving in
stead reasons far from those on which the parents
themselves base their actions and opinions. These
parents look to the university to articulate and in
still those conventional mores which the children
have only tolerated and memorized at home. When

the university does not play the music as it is re
quested, when it as often makes that music look
slightly cute or ridiculous, the society feels be
t rayed.
The university claims to be the social and moral
critic of society, a leader by word and deed, the
uplifting impulse toward improvement. The people
regard tliis as gallingly presumptuous, as if a
valued domestic servant were to claim to set the
tone in his master's manor.
No public agency should interfere in private
business or break up an obvious medical monopoly,
as all of us will lose if these matters are not left
in the hands of those who know them best. How
ever, education, economics, politics, and the ways
of man may supposedly be understood by anyone
with a little horsesense and experience, and too
much study will often as not make of one a con
fused egghead, fuzzing the clear, practical mind
that is the inheritance of every American. This is
not a consequence of proprietorship but a convic
tion of superiority.
Few students truly follow the leadership of any
thing but their glands; the handful who do seek
guidance and a new, unique, personal meaning
from their studies often encounter resentment
from those who are biologically or socially consti
tuted as the primary influences in the lives of
young people. Such resentment, combined with the
education gap discussed above, leads students to
conclude that their college years have made them
irreconcilably different from the majority of the
society they have left behind. Some hide this dif
ference; many with pride and the enthusiasm of
self-confidence make it plain.
DIFFERENCE AS CRITICISM
Difference of condition means difference of
choice in a society having high mobility. Differ
ence of choice is tantamount to criticism in a so
ciety in which diversity for its own sake is no
virtue. Criticism breeds alientation and ultimately
hostility. In short, we say. "Why don't you open
your eyes?" and the public mutters, "Who do
these self-styled intellectuals think they are?"
This column is a multi-lateral polemic. While
the public has been petulant, the university com
munities have been slyly negligent. Professors edu
cate their students and vainly hope that the emerg
ing stiujents will educate the populace and forestall
the someday revolution that will turn all colleges
into trade schools. Administrators doubtlessly
realize that the taxpayers will not lend lavish sup
port to an institution of altruism.
While public speeches are properly seasoned
with phrases like "progress of knowledge" and
"learning as a part of teaching," the common man
seems not to have grasped the idea that a uni
versity is more than a school, and professional
educators are in no hurry to enlighten him. The
ordinary fellow would understand the facts long
before the philosophy, and a full realization of
the salaries paid for nine hours of teaching would
bring the Plumbers' and Realtors' Revolution im
mediately.
Arrogance is a professional affliction among
the bright and well-informed. Many of us agree
with Michael Cohen that "The ever-accelerating
mechanism of social change has now reached a
place near the upper limits of our comprehension
and within our lifetime we may be required to
attempt a complete revision of our way of looking
at the world." Few of us have the patience of a
priest in applying this to the particular dogmas
we as individuals feel destined to supplant.
If the American university system is to sur
vive in freedom it must educate the public about
what goes on here. We are not a bunch of Sun
day schools, not a reservation of playful young
pranksters, and hopefully not a multiversity. If
children are to lead fuller lives than their parents,
more electric toothbrushes will not do the job
alone. Liberal education is hard to sell to those
who have never tasted it, but our choice is to
begin or lo wait for the revolution.
