## Sell But Don't Display 'Realist' 
### 
Dear Sir:
The Realist is still missing from
I ho Tresidder magazine shelves.
Perhaps a compromise can be
made: I suggest that the Trosid
der store stock but not display
The Realist, and sell issues upon
request. This would bo safe and
comfortable for everyone for
Iho students who do not want to
risk catching the attention of the
Attorney General by subscribing,
«■ nd for the university, which does
not want to risk violating the
complacency of its prospective
donors.
I urge that this matter be con
sidered seriously.

• Stanionl's Due Process
Dear Sir:
During the fall quarter the
problem of social regulations at

Stanford quickly grew into an i
issue of considerable controversy, i
The regulations themselves, as
well as cases of infractions of |
them and ihe resulting penalties, j
were cited in The Daily for the ;
information of students. The ac- i
tual procedures of the judiciary
boards have remained clothed in ;
secrecy, however, and the posi |
tions on these boards have been
appointive, rather than elective,
thereby tending to preserve an
orthodox judgment on university !
regulations.
One might even justifiably fear I
an obligation by Stanford stu- J
dents to prove in essence their !
own innocence rather than to on- !
joy the civil guarantee of inno
cence until proven guilty. It
might be well for the members of
ihe judicial boards to heed the;
following statements made by the
Chief Justice of Brandeis Univer
sity, hiiusell elected to that posi i

lion by the student body at large:
"Nothing less than the basic pro
tections available to citizens in
the outside community has been
acceptable at Brandeis. . . . The
Board has extended due process
of law to students charged with
violating university regulations.
Every defendant has had the
right to a trial by jury where
he could hear all testimony pre
sented, question witnesses against
him, speak in his own defense or
icmain silent, and call his own
witnesses."
Surely Stanford University,
which takes such pride in the
Fundamental Standard, cannot
rightfully deny to its students the
standard fundamental to our so
ciety, the protection of civil lib
erties under due process of law.
Perhaps some answers will be
forthcoming.
