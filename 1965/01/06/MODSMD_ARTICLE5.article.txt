# FIRST IN THE NATION
## Eastern Civ Program Makes Debut 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
Sophomores who feel that there is more
' to history than Western Civ can test their
' theory this quarter.
The history department is now offer
ing Eastern Civ, a two quarter suvey of
East Asian history.
The course, taught by Professor James
T. C. Liu, is based on the method used in
Western Civ, one lecture a week on a
specific subject and three discussion
periods a week.
THE FOUR UNIT general studies
course is being offered on Tuesday at
2:15, with discussion periods offered at
9, 11, and 2:15. The course is geared pri
marily for sophomores Dr. Liu indicated.
In winter quarter Japanese and Chi
nese history to about 1600 will be covered,

: followed in spring quarter by a course
covering the modern period.
ALTHOUGH STANFORD has previ-
I ously offered a course in East Asian his
tory, this is the first time anywhere in the
country that the subject has been taught
as a non-lecture course, Dr. Liu stated.
Previously it has been felt that lec
tures are necessary when such unfamilar
subject material is being introduced to
the student, but Dr. Liu believes that stu
dents will be able to prepare themselves
for class discussion through outside read
ing, as is done in Western Civ.
Another benefit of the course, Dr. Liu
believes, is that students will be able to
hear a number of different authorities on
some phase of Asian history speak at the
single weekly lecture. Ten lectures, sched
! uled, on such subjects as "Nature Gods

and Ancient Heroes" and"The Nomad in
Asia."
THE DISCUSSION sections are
scheduled this quarter with a limit of 25
students per section. All three are nearly
filled.
Professor Liu feels that the discussion
sections will provide a greater opportunity
for students to ask questions, than now
exists in large lectures, and that discus
sion may stimulate interest in future
study.
The readings, like Western Civ are
based on a textbook, a source book and
other selected readings.
THE COURSE, long-planned by the
University, was made possible by a gift
of $250,000 from the Garrett Corporation,
a Los Angeles aerospace firm.
The firm's founder J. C. Garrett, indi

j eated an interest in EJast Asian civiliza
tion in 19G3, although Garrett's subse
quent illness prevented detailed plans for
the use of the gift. Following his death
the corporation became a subsidiary of
Signal Oil, and the re-organized manage
ment is honoring the commitment to Stan
ford, specifying that the J. C. Garrett
Memorial Fund be used for broadening
programs in the field of Chinese culture.
The initial funds from the grant have
been allocated to faculty salaries and li
brary additions necessary to start the
new course.
It is intended to be a followup of West
ern Civ covering most of the area left un
surveyed by the freshman history course,
including history, philosophy, religion,
government, economics, literature, the
arts, and family values.

sections will provide a greater opportunity
for students to ask questions, than now
exists in large lectures, and that discus
sion may stimulate interest in future
study.
The readings, like Western Civ are
based on a textbook, a source book and
other selected readings.
THE COURSE, long-planned by the
University, was made possible by a gift
of $250,000 from the Garrett Corporation,
a Los Angeles aerospace firm.
The firm's founder J. C. Garrett, indi

j eated an interest in EJast Asian civiliza
tion in 19G3, although Garrett's subse
quent illness prevented detailed plans for
the use of the gift. Following his death
the corporation became a subsidiary of
Signal Oil, and the re-organized manage
ment is honoring the commitment to Stan
ford, specifying that the J. C. Garrett
Memorial Fund be used for broadening
programs in the field of Chinese culture.
The initial funds from the grant have
been allocated to faculty salaries and li
brary additions necessary to start the
new course.
It is intended to be a followup of West
ern Civ covering most of the area left un
surveyed by the freshman history course,
including history, philosophy, religion,
government, economics, literature, the
arts, and family values.
Sophomores who feel that there is more
' to history than Western Civ can test their
' theory this quarter.
The history department is now offer
ing Eastern Civ, a two quarter suvey of
East Asian history.
The course, taught by Professor James
T. C. Liu, is based on the method used in
Western Civ, one lecture a week on a
specific subject and three discussion
periods a week.
THE FOUR UNIT general studies
course is being offered on Tuesday at
2:15, with discussion periods offered at
9, 11, and 2:15. The course is geared pri
marily for sophomores Dr. Liu indicated.
In winter quarter Japanese and Chi
nese history to about 1600 will be covered,

: followed in spring quarter by a course
covering the modern period.
ALTHOUGH STANFORD has previ-
I ously offered a course in East Asian his
tory, this is the first time anywhere in the
country that the subject has been taught
as a non-lecture course, Dr. Liu stated.
Previously it has been felt that lec
tures are necessary when such unfamilar
subject material is being introduced to
the student, but Dr. Liu believes that stu
dents will be able to prepare themselves
for class discussion through outside read
ing, as is done in Western Civ.
Another benefit of the course, Dr. Liu
believes, is that students will be able to
hear a number of different authorities on
some phase of Asian history speak at the
single weekly lecture. Ten lectures, sched
! uled, on such subjects as "Nature Gods

and Ancient Heroes" and"The Nomad in
Asia."
THE DISCUSSION sections are
scheduled this quarter with a limit of 25
students per section. All three are nearly
filled.
Professor Liu feels that the discussion
sections will provide a greater opportunity
for students to ask questions, than now
exists in large lectures, and that discus
sion may stimulate interest in future
