# COMMUNITY BETTERMENT
## YWCA Expands Projects 
### 
YVVCA, which con
tributed a corps of volunteers to
the launching of Iho East Palo
Alto-Ravenswood tutoring project
two years ago, has now under
la ken community betterment
projects lar beyond the campus
environs.
Some 60 Stanford students, boys
and girls, are spending Saturdays
in general community betterment
work in the North Tracy area, and
a smaller group is similarly en
gaged at the East Oakland Parish
Community Center.
IN NORTH TRACY, a settle
ment of low-income, interracial
migrant workers at Larch and
Clover Roads in the county area
near the San Joaquin Valley city,
the Stanford students conduct
children's recreation programs at
the community center.
The boys plan assistance with
home repair projects during
spring vacation.
One of the biggest problems.
irnnicallN, is prejudice between

Negro an d Mexican-American
residents in the community, re
ports Patricia "Trish" Marsh, a
senior from 12227 Broken Bough,
Houston, who is chairman of the
Y's public affairs committee.
"VVK liwi; TROUBLE with
housing accommodations," she
' said, "because Mexicans won't
rent to Negroes." Meetings to help
: combat prejudice have been sched
uled, she added.
Participating students pay $1 a
I week into the community fund
and supply their own food and
transportation, Miss Marsh ex
plained.
At East Oakland, the emphasis
lis on encouraging high school
drop-outs, largely Negro, to stay
: in school.
THE STUDENTS HOLD tutor
ing classes in remedial English
and mathematics at St. Eliza*
beth's Parish Mall on Seminary
Road, in a program co-sponsored
by both Catholic and Protestant
pastors in the area. Family plan
ning classes for adults are also
' held.

At least one firm has expressed
an interest in supplying part-time
jobs to East Oakland high school
students who will make an effort
:to stay iii school, the Stanford
volunteers report.
Plans are under way, Miss
Marsh reported, to send volun
teers to assist with rehabilitation
programs at San Francisco's Half
way House, sponsored by the
American Friends Service Com
mittee.
Halfway House helps newly re
leased prisoners to find a job and
resume their places in society.
The Stanford Tutoring Pro
gram, now directed by Mrs.
Louise Pierce, a graduate student
in the School of Education, has
now expanded its program to
the Booker T. Washington Center
! in San Francisco, at the request
' of the Board of Education.
In addition to Ravenswood High
School in Fast Palo Alto, the pro
gram now supplies tutors for
Menlo-Athei ton. Cubberley, a nd
