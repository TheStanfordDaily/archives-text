Ilavc you ever wished you could control your temper, or overcome a tendency
to tell lies, or stop worrying, or get rid of lust or insatiable desires? Have you
perhaps tried and tried without success to gain victory over a difficult and unde
sirable problem or character defect? Have you ever wished you could conquer a
disturbing habit?
Romans, Chapter 6, in the New Testament, is the first of three great chapters
which give God's formula for a victorious life of freedom and peace. Few have
discovered the first key truth, the basic fact that nil men serve either God's adver
sary (known as Satan or the devil), or they serve (lie Lord Jesus Christ ( Kpliesinns
6:10-12, Matthew 12:.50). Man's basic nature is that of a servant, deny this however
we will! The victory is found through trust in Jesus Christ:
"Your old evil desires were nailed to the cross with Jesus Christ; that part of you
that loves to sin was crushed and fatally wounded, so that your sin-loving body is
no longer under sin's control, no longer needs to be a slave to sin; For when you
are deadened to sin you are freed from its allure and its power over you. And since
your old sin-loving nature died with Christ, we believe that you are now sharing
His new life. Christ rose from the dead and will never die again. Death no longer
has any power over Him. He died once for all to end sin's power, but now He lives
forever in unbroken fellowship with God.
"So look upon your old sin nature as dead and unresponsive to sin and be alive
instead to God, alert to Him through Jesus Christ our Lord. Do not let sin control
you any longer, do not obey it: do not submit to it by riving in to its desin s. Do not
let any part of your bodies become tools of wickedness, to be used fur sinninbut
give yourself completely to God - every part ot' you -for you are back from death
and you want to l>e tools in the hands of (tod, to be used for His good purposes.
Sin need never again be your master, for now you are no longer tied to the law
where sin enslaves you, but you are free tinder God's favor and niercv. So now
shall we sin and not worry about it? (For our .salvation does not depend on keeping
the law, but on receiving God's grace!) Of course not! Don't you reali/< that you
can chose your own master? You can choose sjn (with death) or els. obedience (with
goodness). The one to whom you offer yourself, he will take you and be your master
and you will be his slave. . . .
"I speak this way. Using the illustration about slaves, because it male sit <asy
to understand; just as you used to be slav< s to all kinds of sin, so now you must
let yourselves be slaves to all that is right and holy. In those days when you were
slaves of sin you didn't bother much with goodness. And what was the result?
Evidently not good, since, you are ashamed now even to think about those things you
used to do. for they ruined you. Hut now you are free from the power of sin md are j
slaves of God, and His benefits to you include holiness and everlasting life. For the I
wages of sjn is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through lee Christ I
our Lord." (Romans 6:6-16,19-23, Living Letters)

"So look upon your old sin nature as dead and unresponsive to sin and be alive
instead to God, alert to Him through Jesus Christ our Lord. Do not let sin control
you any longer, do not obey it: do not submit to it by riving in to its desin s. Do not
let any part of your bodies become tools of wickedness, to be used fur sinninbut
give yourself completely to God - every part ot' you -for you are back from death
and you want to l>e tools in the hands of (tod, to be used for His good purposes.
Sin need never again be your master, for now you are no longer tied to the law
where sin enslaves you, but you are free tinder God's favor and niercv. So now
shall we sin and not worry about it? (For our .salvation does not depend on keeping
the law, but on receiving God's grace!) Of course not! Don't you reali/< that you
can chose your own master? You can choose sjn (with death) or els. obedience (with
goodness). The one to whom you offer yourself, he will take you and be your master
and you will be his slave. . . .
"I speak this way. Using the illustration about slaves, because it male sit <asy
to understand; just as you used to be slav< s to all kinds of sin, so now you must
let yourselves be slaves to all that is right and holy. In those days when you were
slaves of sin you didn't bother much with goodness. And what was the result?
Evidently not good, since, you are ashamed now even to think about those things you
used to do. for they ruined you. Hut now you are free from the power of sin md are j
slaves of God, and His benefits to you include holiness and everlasting life. For the I
wages of sjn is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through lee Christ I
our Lord." (Romans 6:6-16,19-23, Living Letters)

Ilavc you ever wished you could control your temper, or overcome a tendency
to tell lies, or stop worrying, or get rid of lust or insatiable desires? Have you
perhaps tried and tried without success to gain victory over a difficult and unde
sirable problem or character defect? Have you ever wished you could conquer a
disturbing habit?
Romans, Chapter 6, in the New Testament, is the first of three great chapters
which give God's formula for a victorious life of freedom and peace. Few have
discovered the first key truth, the basic fact that nil men serve either God's adver
sary (known as Satan or the devil), or they serve (lie Lord Jesus Christ ( Kpliesinns
6:10-12, Matthew 12:.50). Man's basic nature is that of a servant, deny this however
we will! The victory is found through trust in Jesus Christ:
"Your old evil desires were nailed to the cross with Jesus Christ; that part of you
that loves to sin was crushed and fatally wounded, so that your sin-loving body is
no longer under sin's control, no longer needs to be a slave to sin; For when you
are deadened to sin you are freed from its allure and its power over you. And since
your old sin-loving nature died with Christ, we believe that you are now sharing
His new life. Christ rose from the dead and will never die again. Death no longer
has any power over Him. He died once for all to end sin's power, but now He lives
forever in unbroken fellowship with God.
"So look upon your old sin nature as dead and unresponsive to sin and be alive
instead to God, alert to Him through Jesus Christ our Lord. Do not let sin control
