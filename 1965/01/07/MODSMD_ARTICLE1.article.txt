WASHINGTON — President Johnson's
health message to Congress today reportedly
will propose an unprecedented $l-billion to
$l.!>-biUion program to improve health ser
vices to children. It would be spread over 3
years.
Informed sources said the message would
also renew Johnson's call for a hospital insur
ance program for the aged Jinked to Social
Security. The children'h health proposal could
cost about $150 million in the initial year, th<>
sources said.
This would be a turn toward emphasis on
health services for children, particularly those
in need, patterned somewhat after expanding
federal programs of recent years to provide
health services for the aged.
But the message also will propose creation
of a system of regional medical centers and
local treatment stations for heart disease,
cancer, and stroke, which are primarily dis
eases of adults. Estimated cost of this pro

gram over five years is about $1.2 billion, in
formed sources said.
