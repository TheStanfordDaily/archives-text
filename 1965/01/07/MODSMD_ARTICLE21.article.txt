# Indians Hope For Improvement In Conference Winter Rankings
## 
### 
As the winter sports schedule
shifts into high gear in the next
few weeks and Stanford begins j
to face conference opponents, the
Indians hope to protect two sec- j
ond place finishes in last year's j
AAWU races and to try 1o im
prove two second-to-last place fin
ishes. Stanford was championship
contender in basketball and swim
ming last winter, while the wres
tling and gymnastics squads had ;
to battle to keep out of the cellar.
UCLA dominated the AAWU
basketball scene last year with
a 10-O record en route to a na
tional championship and an as
tounding thirty-one game winning
streak. Stanford was UCLA's clos
est competitor, led by All-Ameri
ca n Tom Dose at center. The
Tribe compiled a 9-6 conference
record.
In the water, another excellent
Stanford squad was faced with a
national champion and had to set
tle for second place to USC. The
Cards were not faced with too
stiff competition from other con
ference schools, but most of these
teams were building for this year
and will provide a tougher con
ference race.

COULD be considered the
coming-of-age of AAWU wres
tling with the stiff est competition
ever. Five first places by UCLA'
! helped them edge Washington 64-
03. Stanford was fourth with 50
points. No AAWU team has ever
won an NCAA wrestling title.
The AAWU fielded several
strong competely overwhelming
the teams last year in gymnastics,
small Stanford contingent. Wash
ington won both the Conference
and Western Collegiate titles and
| USC, Washington, and California!

finished second, fourth, and tenth
in the NCAA meet. USC's Hon
Barak won three national titles,
the Ail-Around, horizontal bar,
and parallel bars events.
