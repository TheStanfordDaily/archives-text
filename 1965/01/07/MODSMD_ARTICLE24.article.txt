## 
### ROBERT THIERIOT 
I For those who were near tho
end of tho lino for basketball
tickets that fateful morning last
quarter, somo consolation can bo
found. Four of those homo games
which you couldn't buy tickets
for will bo televised by KTVU,
channel 2. In addition ono away
game will bo televised.
For those unfortunates and any
others finding nothing to do with
j Saturday afternoons, there will
be an AAYVTJ hall game broadcast
every Saturday afternoon at three
o'clock, from January 9 to March
6. This is the first time since 19.~6
! that t he conference has sponsored
: a weekly televised game.
THREE OF these afternoons
j the feature game will find Stan
-1 ford players on the court: Jan. 9
j Washington at Stanford, Feb. 20
I Stanford at WSU, Mar. 6 Califor
j nia at Stanford.
Besides these Saturday after
| noon games KTVU will also
1 broadcast two additional Stanford
J encounters. On February 13 at 8
p.m. channel 2 will televise the
encounter between the University
of Oregon and Stanford; when the
Indians host USC on February 27
at 8 p.m., the game will also be
broadcast locally. These last two
games are not in conjunction with
ihc AAWU'S Game of the Week
on Saturday afternoons.
Since Stanford is a member of
a conference, even the money
which is obtained by independent
broadcasts is divided among the
conference members. The oppo
nent receives one-half.
THE CONFERENCE then di

| vides tho revenue among its mom-!
bors, while taking a small percent- !
ago itself. Tho school which par- 1
ticipatcd in the game broadcast |
receives a slightly larger percent-;
age than tho other conference i
members.
For those who were unable to ;
obtain tickets, there are still the 1
opportunities to sop many games j
on TV. For those who have their
lickets, they will have few prob- 1
lems seeing enough basketball
games this quarter.
