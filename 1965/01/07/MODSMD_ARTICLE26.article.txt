# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## OSU Bubble Pops; Schedule Is Culprit 
### PETE EAKLAND 
As has happened since 1947 on New Year's Day, a representative
from the West Coast met a representative from the Big Ten con
ference, and to nobody's surprise Michigan gave the Big Ten its
second consecutive Rose Bowl victory over Coast competition by
trouncing Oregon State 34-7.
CHRISTIANS VS. LIONS
The game was as evenly matched as the lion-Christian combats
the Romans presented in the Coliseum and called sport. The only
difference was Oregon State didn't have God on its side. If either
of the two teams did, it was probably the Wolverines, whose quarter
back was Bob "good clean violence" Timberlake, who plans to go
into the ministry.
It was a black day lor the Beavers of Oregon State, and they came
suitably attired, wearing black pants, black .jerseys and orange arid
black helmets.
Tommy Prothro is in the habit of doing his coaching from the
pressbox, where he has a better-than-average view of the scoreboard
and clock. And it seems he does his coaching with one eye on them.
Whenever he isn't behind, he thinks nothing of giving up the hall.
It's nice to have confidence in your defense, but this is going too
far, especially against a team which has averaged 23 points per game
against stiff competition. The Beavers even went so far as 1o punt
on second down once and on third down several times.
Prothro didn't face reality. He's probably got a receipt for the
Brooklyn Bridge hanging on his wall, and a book about Neville
Chamberlain in his bookshelf.
One thing, though, his strategy worked well during the regular
season to win eight out of ten games while averaging only 1-1 points
a game.
SHORT SCHEDULES
How did the Beavers ever get into the Rose Bowl? The subject
of the voting by the faculty representatives has been much dis
cussed, but the real culprit was the schedule which made the mess
inevitable in case of a tie.
Oregon and Oregon State had not bet>n in the conference since
19f59 when UCLA, IJSC, Cal, and Washington dropped out of the old
Pacific Coast Conference because of differences of opinion involving
financing of athletes. Stanford and Washington State soon after
joined up.
By letting Oregon and Oregon State become members, the AAWU
created a situation such that only two schools played every member
of the conference. Five schools played only four conference games,
and one played only three.
While Oregon State won the AAWU title by playing only four
games, the Michigan Wolverines won their titie by playing seven
conference games, including the primary contenders. Seems like a
straight-forward, error-free arrangement.
More sensible if would have been to let Oregon and Oregon State
into the conference but make them ineligible for the conference
crown until they had five or possibly six league games scheduled.
They won the title by winning one game decisively, losing one
just as decisively, and winning two more games by the margin of
an extra point and a field goal. With luck that would make Gladstone
Gander envious, the Beavers had built a bubble reputation that SC
tried to pop with its victory over the then-first-ranked Irish,
of Notre Dame. The bubble survived until a rose thorn pricked it.
Fortunately, neither Oregon State nor Oregon can duplicate their
good fortune during the basketball season because they each have
two games with both UCLA, USC, Stanford, and Cal.
