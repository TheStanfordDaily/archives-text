## What's The Philosophy Of Stanford Education? 
### 
Dear Sir:
Throughout the past quarter,
Stanford lias had an advantage
afforded few other universities
that of being close enough to the
Berkeley campus to be able to ob
serve the recent events there in
greater depth and with greater
understanding than those who
have had to rely entirely upon
national press coverage. This ad
vantage enabled many here to
perceive rapidly that the demon
strations at Cal could not be ex
plained as just normal student
restlessness or a traditional stu
dent challenge of authority. Much
to the disappointment of some
segments of society, neither could
they be attributed to some sin
ister leftist plot. It has become
more and more clear that the
roots of the present controversy
lie in areas of much greater sig
nificance, generating questions
such as what exactly is a univer
sity, what is the relationship be
tween the state and education,
are the faculty more than just
paid employees of some sort of
bureaucratic structure, and does
the word individual have any
meaning in Clark Kerr's multi
versity toward which many in
stitutions seem to be progress
ing?
What remains for us in th e
light of our observations of the
events at Cal and the thoughts
they have produced, is to ask
what insights can we gain into
our environment. It would seem
most logical at this point to first
direct our attention to the phil
osophical basis of education at
Stanford, for surely virtually all
decision making on lower levels
ultimately relates to this and
finds justification through it.
President Sterling has stated that
his philosophy of education is to
have no philosophy of education.
Last year, when pressed further
on the matter, he stated this
meant to combine the best pos
sible students with the best fac
ulty in as good a physical plant
as could be built. On January 13th,
President Sterling will deliver his
annual "state of the university"
address. 1 hope that he would ad
dress himself, in the light of
events at Cal, once again to his
philosophy of having no philoso
phy of education, to explain in
more detail, with respect to this
philosophy, upon what basis poli
cies are formulated and decisions
made. I hope that he would see
this as an opportune time to state
what precepts he believes lo be
basic to this university, precepts
that must be ident if ie d if
a thoughtful investigation of their
continuing validity and the valid
ity of the structures deriving
from them is to be undertaken.
I also hope that before the 13th,
students and faculty who share
this viewpoint will make it known
to the president. At this time, not
to demand more information
about this philosophy of no phil
osophy. not to demand to know
more about what standards arc
used to judge what iire the "best"
students, faculty members, and
facilities, not to demand that
more than chance determine the
outcome of the interaction of
those students, faculty, and facili
ties, and not to demand to know
what there is here that was lack
ing at Berkeley is to deny the
relevance of what happened at
CaL This would be a mistake.

Social Responsibility
Dear Sir:
Ideally, women's social regula
tions foster social responsibility.
Bringing existing regulations into
consonance with this ideal will
almost certainly require liberal
ization of these regulations. How
ever, the purpose of liberalization
is thus not liberalization for its
own sake, but rather the develop
ment of social responsibility.
Sincerely,

• Minor Sports Coverage
Your policy of continuing to ig
nore the minor sports at Stanford
: is doing much to alienate an im
portant and numerous part of the
Stanford student body. Wo realize
that you think football, basket
i ball, track and soccer are the only
| sports which exist at Stanford,
I but there are others, and no mat
| ter how difficult it may be it is
I your duty to find out about them,
j Only in this way can The Daily
become anything more than the
' m e d i o e r e advertising handbill
> which it is now.
It is really sad when the sports
I which you choose to ignore at
(Stanford directly contribute to
j Olympic gold medals and other
i national honors. You dismiss all
'the news here at Stanford with
as much expanded advertising as
possible. For instance, the 1964
Olympics were important news lo
everyone and yet you chose to
virtually ignore the Games and
continue your head-in-the-ground
j policy.
Other teams at Stanford win a
j lot more consistently and contrib
| ute a lot more to Stanford's total
I athletic standing in the West
! Coast Conference than does the
football team. These other more
i successful teams will remain un
known to the student body in
spite of their greater contribu
tions to Stanford unless you make
i some effort to publicize their ac
tivities and do it well; not in your
j present haphazard manner. We
! suggest you look around a little
| and we are sure that you will
j find more than "8 athletes on the
j Dean's List." These others should
.be given credit, too. With this
continuous "half the news, half
the time" attitude in all aspect?
of campus life we an? convinced
you will continue providing lin
ings for garbage cans, and that
is all!

SPORTS EDITORS NOTE: The
newspaper tries to give as much
coverage as possible to all sports
at Stanford. As an instance intra
murals are getting more cover
age than in the last, few years.
But space (which is dependent on
our financial status) severely
limits the amount of coverage
possible. Major intercollegiate
sports have top priority, natur
ally, and when space warrants,
we do plug other athletic endea
vors.
Besides the problem of space,
which is one of great magnitude,
there is the problem of securing
information, which you seem to
appreciate. Seeking out copy is
part of my job, but the athletic
department is my main source of
information.
The Daily sports department is
extremely receptive, and always
has been, to information regard
ing minor sports which we would
not normally see.
If more people would bring in
formal ion to the Daily instead of
criticizing our lack of coverage,
the problem you point out would
be partially solved. I doubt if il
can ever be solved to everyone's
satisfaction.
• Moderation JNo Virtue
Dear Sir:
j Sometimes what superficially
appears to be mature, reason
able attitude turns out upon in-
I spec!ion to be myopic and at
j worst cowardly. This remark is
i addressed to a very common posi
j lion expressed in an otherwise
j sensible editorial on the AWS sur
vey of attitudes concerning social
, regulations that appeared in the
| Jan. 5 issue of the Daily. The
i paragraph under scrutiny reads:
| "But at the same time students
j should recognize that the Univer
sity has to (leal with the public
j with potential donors and poten
: tial alumni or parents of alumni -
| whose opinions can be swayed by
the faintest suggestion of over
; liberality or possible promiscuity,
I especially as amplified by the
j distinguished journals of the Bay
: Area. The AWS recommendations
must take public opinion into ac
count." (emphasis added.) In
other words, administrative dcri

sions are strongly influenced by
external, conservative pressures,
and, therefore, progressive groups
within the university that seek
change must avoid actions that
tend to heighten these pressures.
This conventional "don't make
waves" approach to change has
broad appeal, but it is. nonethe
less, unrealistic.
One justification commonly
heard for this approach is a kind
of naive humanism- pity the
poor administrator buffeted by
all those conflicting pressures.
This is like pitying the musician
for practicing so much or the
scholar for thinking so hard. An
other argument proffered in de
fense of mincing moderation is
that any suspician of campus radi
calism will bring down such a
storm of mural and economic
sanctions on the university that
administrative intransigence will
set in like rigor mortis. This argu
ment is morally demeaning and
pragmatically spurious. It is de
meaning because it justifies com
promising principles rather lhan
times and places. The impractical
ity of this what-will-the-British
think-if-wc-dump-the - tea - over
board mentality has been most
recently demonstrated by the UC
Free Speech controversy. After
failing to establish a dialogue via
the conventional channels, a
"bunch of beatnik, commy, delin
quent, out-of-state, minority-type,
rebellious kids" overcame a bad
and sometimes yellow press, Big
Daddy Unruh, Max Rafferty, Ed
ward Strong, and most impor
tantly. that bugaboo, public opin
ion. How? Why? Simply because
they were right.
The conclusion is that unneces
sary and premature compromise
is self-defeating, tactically un
.vise, and morally deteriorating.
Any proposed change in the estab
lished order will engender re
sistance. But the force of resis
tance is not so much a function
of how radical the change as it
is inversely related to the light
ness of the change.
It is indeed true that a dean's
lot is not an easy one. One of their
persistent nightmares is that of
the indignant parent demanding
an explanation for the delicate
condition of a daughter. Fear of
these and similar encounters is
undoubtedly a factor in the pro
liferation of rules and regulations
controlling social and political ac
tivity. But our understanding and
sympathy for our PR men should
not cloud our vision of a truly
free university.
It is time to end the experiment
on suspended maturation that has
been conducted by the high school
universities it has worked. If
getting away from home has any
thing to do with growing up, it
doesn't make much sense to per
petuate the function of a univer
sity as a big, cozy, surrogate fam
ily with local (or loco) parentis.
At I lie age of 18, parentis in ab
sentia should suffice. If not, then
no amount of coddling is going to
accelerate development.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Relevant
facts which Mr. Soule may find
Useful: The FSM refused to
establish a dialogue and did
noi overcome public opinion or
win its final demands —in fact,
il caused irreparable harm to
the University in terms of na
tional reputation and probable
legislative repu missions.
We would agree, that the
AWS should press for broad re
forms, but the demands should
not be belligerent or, given the
attitudes of parents and stu
dents, impossible for the Ad
ministration lo accept.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Relevant
facts which Mr. Soule may find
Useful: The FSM refused to
establish a dialogue and did
noi overcome public opinion or
win its final demands —in fact,
il caused irreparable harm to
the University in terms of na
tional reputation and probable
legislative repu missions.
We would agree, that the
AWS should press for broad re
forms, but the demands should
not be belligerent or, given the
attitudes of parents and stu
dents, impossible for the Ad
ministration lo accept.
Dear Sir:
Throughout the past quarter,
Stanford lias had an advantage
afforded few other universities
that of being close enough to the
Berkeley campus to be able to ob
serve the recent events there in
greater depth and with greater
understanding than those who
have had to rely entirely upon
national press coverage. This ad
vantage enabled many here to
perceive rapidly that the demon
strations at Cal could not be ex
plained as just normal student
restlessness or a traditional stu
dent challenge of authority. Much
to the disappointment of some
segments of society, neither could
they be attributed to some sin
ister leftist plot. It has become
more and more clear that the
roots of the present controversy
lie in areas of much greater sig
nificance, generating questions
such as what exactly is a univer
sity, what is the relationship be
tween the state and education,
are the faculty more than just
paid employees of some sort of
bureaucratic structure, and does
the word individual have any
meaning in Clark Kerr's multi
versity toward which many in
stitutions seem to be progress
ing?
What remains for us in th e
light of our observations of the
events at Cal and the thoughts
they have produced, is to ask
what insights can we gain into
our environment. It would seem
most logical at this point to first
direct our attention to the phil
osophical basis of education at
Stanford, for surely virtually all
decision making on lower levels
ultimately relates to this and
finds justification through it.
President Sterling has stated that
his philosophy of education is to
have no philosophy of education.
Last year, when pressed further
on the matter, he stated this
meant to combine the best pos
sible students with the best fac
ulty in as good a physical plant
as could be built. On January 13th,
President Sterling will deliver his
annual "state of the university"
address. 1 hope that he would ad
dress himself, in the light of
events at Cal, once again to his
philosophy of having no philoso
phy of education, to explain in
more detail, with respect to this
philosophy, upon what basis poli
cies are formulated and decisions
made. I hope that he would see
this as an opportune time to state
what precepts he believes lo be
basic to this university, precepts
that must be ident if ie d if
a thoughtful investigation of their
continuing validity and the valid
ity of the structures deriving
from them is to be undertaken.
I also hope that before the 13th,
students and faculty who share
this viewpoint will make it known
to the president. At this time, not
to demand more information
about this philosophy of no phil
osophy. not to demand to know
more about what standards arc
used to judge what iire the "best"
students, faculty members, and
facilities, not to demand that
more than chance determine the
outcome of the interaction of
those students, faculty, and facili
ties, and not to demand to know
what there is here that was lack
ing at Berkeley is to deny the
relevance of what happened at
CaL This would be a mistake.

Social Responsibility
Dear Sir:
Ideally, women's social regula
tions foster social responsibility.
Bringing existing regulations into
consonance with this ideal will
almost certainly require liberal
ization of these regulations. How
ever, the purpose of liberalization
is thus not liberalization for its
own sake, but rather the develop
ment of social responsibility.

• Minor Sports Coverage
Your policy of continuing to ig
nore the minor sports at Stanford
: is doing much to alienate an im
portant and numerous part of the
Stanford student body. Wo realize
that you think football, basket
i ball, track and soccer are the only
| sports which exist at Stanford,
I but there are others, and no mat
| ter how difficult it may be it is
I your duty to find out about them,
j Only in this way can The Daily
become anything more than the
' m e d i o e r e advertising handbill

It is really sad when the sports
I which you choose to ignore at
(Stanford directly contribute to
j Olympic gold medals and other
i national honors. You dismiss all
'the news here at Stanford with
as much expanded advertising as
possible. For instance, the 1964
Olympics were important news lo
everyone and yet you chose to
virtually ignore the Games and
continue your head-in-the-ground
j policy.
Other teams at Stanford win a
j lot more consistently and contrib
| ute a lot more to Stanford's total
I athletic standing in the West
! Coast Conference than does the
football team. These other more
i successful teams will remain un
known to the student body in
spite of their greater contribu
tions to Stanford unless you make
i some effort to publicize their ac
tivities and do it well; not in your

you will continue providing lin

SPORTS EDITORS NOTE: The
newspaper tries to give as much
coverage as possible to all sports
at Stanford. As an instance intra
murals are getting more cover
age than in the last, few years.
But space (which is dependent on
our financial status) severely
limits the amount of coverage
possible. Major intercollegiate
sports have top priority, natur
ally, and when space warrants,
we do plug other athletic endea
vors.
Besides the problem of space,
which is one of great magnitude,
there is the problem of securing
information, which you seem to
appreciate. Seeking out copy is
part of my job, but the athletic
department is my main source of
information.
The Daily sports department is
extremely receptive, and always
has been, to information regard
ing minor sports which we would
not normally see.
If more people would bring in
formal ion to the Daily instead of
criticizing our lack of coverage,
the problem you point out would
be partially solved. I doubt if il
can ever be solved to everyone's
satisfaction.
• Moderation JNo Virtue
Dear Sir:
j Sometimes what superficially
appears to be mature, reason
able attitude turns out upon in-
I spec!ion to be myopic and at
j worst cowardly. This remark is
i addressed to a very common posi
j lion expressed in an otherwise
j sensible editorial on the AWS sur
vey of attitudes concerning social
, regulations that appeared in the
| Jan. 5 issue of the Daily. The
i paragraph under scrutiny reads:
| "But at the same time students
j should recognize that the Univer
sity has to (leal with the public
j with potential donors and poten
: tial alumni or parents of alumni -
| whose opinions can be swayed by
the faintest suggestion of over
; liberality or possible promiscuity,
I especially as amplified by the
j distinguished journals of the Bay
: Area. The AWS recommendations
must take public opinion into ac
count." (emphasis added.) In
other words, administrative dcri

sions are strongly influenced by
external, conservative pressures,
and, therefore, progressive groups
within the university that seek
change must avoid actions that
tend to heighten these pressures.
This conventional "don't make
waves" approach to change has
broad appeal, but it is. nonethe
less, unrealistic.
One justification commonly
heard for this approach is a kind
of naive humanism- pity the
poor administrator buffeted by
all those conflicting pressures.
This is like pitying the musician
for practicing so much or the
scholar for thinking so hard. An
other argument proffered in de
fense of mincing moderation is
that any suspician of campus radi
calism will bring down such a
storm of mural and economic
sanctions on the university that
administrative intransigence will
set in like rigor mortis. This argu
ment is morally demeaning and
pragmatically spurious. It is de
meaning because it justifies com
promising principles rather lhan
times and places. The impractical
ity of this what-will-the-British
think-if-wc-dump-the - tea - over
board mentality has been most
recently demonstrated by the UC
Free Speech controversy. After
failing to establish a dialogue via
the conventional channels, a
"bunch of beatnik, commy, delin
quent, out-of-state, minority-type,
rebellious kids" overcame a bad
and sometimes yellow press, Big
Daddy Unruh, Max Rafferty, Ed
ward Strong, and most impor
tantly. that bugaboo, public opin
ion. How? Why? Simply because
they were right.
The conclusion is that unneces
sary and premature compromise
is self-defeating, tactically un
.vise, and morally deteriorating.
Any proposed change in the estab
lished order will engender re
sistance. But the force of resis
tance is not so much a function
of how radical the change as it
is inversely related to the light
ness of the change.
It is indeed true that a dean's
lot is not an easy one. One of their
persistent nightmares is that of
the indignant parent demanding
an explanation for the delicate
condition of a daughter. Fear of
these and similar encounters is
undoubtedly a factor in the pro
liferation of rules and regulations
controlling social and political ac
tivity. But our understanding and
sympathy for our PR men should
not cloud our vision of a truly
free university.
It is time to end the experiment
on suspended maturation that has
been conducted by the high school
universities it has worked. If
getting away from home has any
thing to do with growing up, it
doesn't make much sense to per
petuate the function of a univer
sity as a big, cozy, surrogate fam
ily with local (or loco) parentis.
At I lie age of 18, parentis in ab

EDITOR'S NOTE: Relevant
facts which Mr. Soule may find
Useful: The FSM refused to
establish a dialogue and did
noi overcome public opinion or
win its final demands —in fact,
il caused irreparable harm to
the University in terms of na
tional reputation and probable
legislative repu missions.
We would agree, that the
AWS should press for broad re
forms, but the demands should
not be belligerent or, given the
attitudes of parents and stu
dents, impossible for the Ad
ministration lo accept.
Dear Sir:
Throughout the past quarter,
Stanford lias had an advantage
afforded few other universities
that of being close enough to the
Berkeley campus to be able to ob
serve the recent events there in
greater depth and with greater
understanding than those who
have had to rely entirely upon
national press coverage. This ad
vantage enabled many here to
perceive rapidly that the demon
strations at Cal could not be ex
plained as just normal student
restlessness or a traditional stu
dent challenge of authority. Much
to the disappointment of some
segments of society, neither could
they be attributed to some sin
ister leftist plot. It has become
more and more clear that the
roots of the present controversy
lie in areas of much greater sig
nificance, generating questions
such as what exactly is a univer
sity, what is the relationship be
tween the state and education,
are the faculty more than just
paid employees of some sort of
bureaucratic structure, and does
the word individual have any
meaning in Clark Kerr's multi
versity toward which many in
stitutions seem to be progress
ing?
What remains for us in th e
light of our observations of the
events at Cal and the thoughts
they have produced, is to ask
what insights can we gain into
our environment. It would seem
most logical at this point to first
direct our attention to the phil
osophical basis of education at
Stanford, for surely virtually all
decision making on lower levels
ultimately relates to this and
finds justification through it.
President Sterling has stated that
his philosophy of education is to
have no philosophy of education.
Last year, when pressed further
on the matter, he stated this
meant to combine the best pos
sible students with the best fac
ulty in as good a physical plant
as could be built. On January 13th,
President Sterling will deliver his
annual "state of the university"
address. 1 hope that he would ad
dress himself, in the light of
events at Cal, once again to his
philosophy of having no philoso
phy of education, to explain in
more detail, with respect to this
philosophy, upon what basis poli
cies are formulated and decisions
made. I hope that he would see
this as an opportune time to state
what precepts he believes lo be
basic to this university, precepts
that must be ident if ie d if
a thoughtful investigation of their
continuing validity and the valid
ity of the structures deriving
from them is to be undertaken.
I also hope that before the 13th,
students and faculty who share
this viewpoint will make it known
to the president. At this time, not
to demand more information
about this philosophy of no phil
osophy. not to demand to know
more about what standards arc
used to judge what iire the "best"
students, faculty members, and
facilities, not to demand that
more than chance determine the
outcome of the interaction of
those students, faculty, and facili
ties, and not to demand to know
what there is here that was lack
ing at Berkeley is to deny the
relevance of what happened at
CaL This would be a mistake.

Social Responsibility
Dear Sir:
Ideally, women's social regula
tions foster social responsibility.
Bringing existing regulations into
consonance with this ideal will
almost certainly require liberal
ization of these regulations. How
ever, the purpose of liberalization
is thus not liberalization for its
own sake, but rather the develop
ment of social responsibility.

• Minor Sports Coverage
Your policy of continuing to ig

: is doing much to alienate an im

Stanford student body. Wo realize
that you think football, basket

| sports which exist at Stanford,
I but there are others, and no mat

I your duty to find out about them,
j Only in this way can The Daily

It is really sad when the sports

'the news here at Stanford with
as much expanded advertising as
possible. For instance, the 1964
Olympics were important news lo
everyone and yet you chose to
virtually ignore the Games and
continue your head-in-the-ground
j policy.
Other teams at Stanford win a

football team. These other more

SPORTS EDITORS NOTE: The
newspaper tries to give as much
coverage as possible to all sports
at Stanford. As an instance intra
murals are getting more cover
age than in the last, few years.
But space (which is dependent on
our financial status) severely
limits the amount of coverage
possible. Major intercollegiate
sports have top priority, natur
ally, and when space warrants,
we do plug other athletic endea
vors.
Besides the problem of space,
which is one of great magnitude,
there is the problem of securing
information, which you seem to
appreciate. Seeking out copy is
part of my job, but the athletic
department is my main source of
information.
The Daily sports department is
extremely receptive, and always
has been, to information regard
ing minor sports which we would
not normally see.
If more people would bring in
formal ion to the Daily instead of
criticizing our lack of coverage,
the problem you point out would
be partially solved. I doubt if il
can ever be solved to everyone's
satisfaction.
• Moderation JNo Virtue
Dear Sir:
j Sometimes what superficially
appears to be mature, reason
able attitude turns out upon in-
I spec!ion to be myopic and at
j worst cowardly. This remark is
i addressed to a very common posi
j lion expressed in an otherwise
j sensible editorial on the AWS sur
vey of attitudes concerning social
, regulations that appeared in the
| Jan. 5 issue of the Daily. The
i paragraph under scrutiny reads:
| "But at the same time students
j should recognize that the Univer
sity has to (leal with the public
j with potential donors and poten
: tial alumni or parents of alumni -
| whose opinions can be swayed by
the faintest suggestion of over
; liberality or possible promiscuity,
I especially as amplified by the
j distinguished journals of the Bay
: Area. The AWS recommendations
must take public opinion into ac
count." (emphasis added.) In
other words, administrative dcri

sions are strongly influenced by
external, conservative pressures,
and, therefore, progressive groups
within the university that seek
change must avoid actions that
tend to heighten these pressures.
This conventional "don't make
waves" approach to change has
broad appeal, but it is. nonethe
less, unrealistic.
One justification commonly
heard for this approach is a kind
of naive humanism- pity the
poor administrator buffeted by
all those conflicting pressures.
This is like pitying the musician
for practicing so much or the
scholar for thinking so hard. An
other argument proffered in de
fense of mincing moderation is
that any suspician of campus radi
calism will bring down such a
storm of mural and economic
sanctions on the university that
administrative intransigence will
set in like rigor mortis. This argu
ment is morally demeaning and
pragmatically spurious. It is de
meaning because it justifies com
promising principles rather lhan
times and places. The impractical
ity of this what-will-the-British
think-if-wc-dump-the - tea - over
board mentality has been most
recently demonstrated by the UC
Free Speech controversy. After
failing to establish a dialogue via
the conventional channels, a
"bunch of beatnik, commy, delin
quent, out-of-state, minority-type,
rebellious kids" overcame a bad
and sometimes yellow press, Big
Daddy Unruh, Max Rafferty, Ed
ward Strong, and most impor
tantly. that bugaboo, public opin
ion. How? Why? Simply because
they were right.
The conclusion is that unneces
sary and premature compromise
is self-defeating, tactically un
.vise, and morally deteriorating.
Any proposed change in the estab
lished order will engender re
sistance. But the force of resis
tance is not so much a function

pragmatically spurious. It is de
meaning because it justifies com
promising principles rather lhan
times and places. The impractical
ity of this what-will-the-British

board mentality has been most
recently demonstrated by the UC
Free Speech controversy. After
failing to establish a dialogue via
the conventional channels, a
"bunch of beatnik, commy, delin

The conclusion is that unneces

is self-defeating, tactically un

Any proposed change in the estab

of how radical the change as it
is inversely related to the light
ness of the change.
It is indeed true that a dean's
lot is not an easy one. One of their
persistent nightmares is that of
the indignant parent demanding
an explanation for the delicate
condition of a daughter. Fear of
these and similar encounters is
undoubtedly a factor in the pro
liferation of rules and regulations
controlling social and political ac
tivity. But our understanding and
sympathy for our PR men should
not cloud our vision of a truly

It is time to end the experiment

EDITOR'S NOTE: Relevant
facts which Mr. Soule may find
Useful: The FSM refused to
establish a dialogue and did
noi overcome public opinion or
win its final demands —in fact,
il caused irreparable harm to
the University in terms of na
tional reputation and probable
legislative repu missions.
We would agree, that the
AWS should press for broad re
forms, but the demands should
not be belligerent or, given the
attitudes of parents and stu
dents, impossible for the Ad
ministration lo accept.
Dear Sir:
Throughout the past quarter,
Stanford lias had an advantage
afforded few other universities
that of being close enough to the
Berkeley campus to be able to ob
serve the recent events there in
greater depth and with greater
understanding than those who
have had to rely entirely upon
national press coverage. This ad
vantage enabled many here to
perceive rapidly that the demon
strations at Cal could not be ex
plained as just normal student
restlessness or a traditional stu
dent challenge of authority. Much
to the disappointment of some
segments of society, neither could
they be attributed to some sin
ister leftist plot. It has become
more and more clear that the
roots of the present controversy
lie in areas of much greater sig
nificance, generating questions
such as what exactly is a univer
sity, what is the relationship be
tween the state and education,
are the faculty more than just
paid employees of some sort of
bureaucratic structure, and does
the word individual have any
meaning in Clark Kerr's multi
versity toward which many in
stitutions seem to be progress
ing?
What remains for us in th e
light of our observations of the
events at Cal and the thoughts
they have produced, is to ask
what insights can we gain into
our environment. It would seem
most logical at this point to first
direct our attention to the phil
osophical basis of education at
Stanford, for surely virtually all
decision making on lower levels
ultimately relates to this and
finds justification through it.
President Sterling has stated that
his philosophy of education is to
have no philosophy of education.
Last year, when pressed further
on the matter, he stated this
meant to combine the best pos
sible students with the best fac
ulty in as good a physical plant
as could be built. On January 13th,
President Sterling will deliver his
annual "state of the university"
address. 1 hope that he would ad
dress himself, in the light of
events at Cal, once again to his
philosophy of having no philoso
phy of education, to explain in
more detail, with respect to this
philosophy, upon what basis poli
cies are formulated and decisions
made. I hope that he would see
this as an opportune time to state
what precepts he believes lo be
basic to this university, precepts
that must be ident if ie d if
a thoughtful investigation of their
continuing validity and the valid
ity of the structures deriving
from them is to be undertaken.
I also hope that before the 13th,
students and faculty who share
this viewpoint will make it known
to the president. At this time, not
to demand more information
about this philosophy of no phil
osophy. not to demand to know
more about what standards arc
used to judge what iire the "best"
students, faculty members, and
facilities, not to demand that
more than chance determine the
outcome of the interaction of
those students, faculty, and facili
ties, and not to demand to know
what there is here that was lack
ing at Berkeley is to deny the
relevance of what happened at
CaL This would be a mistake.

Social Responsibility
Dear Sir:
Ideally, women's social regula
tions foster social responsibility.
Bringing existing regulations into
consonance with this ideal will
almost certainly require liberal
ization of these regulations. How
ever, the purpose of liberalization
is thus not liberalization for its
own sake, but rather the develop
ment of social responsibility.

• Minor Sports Coverage
Your policy of continuing to ig

: is doing much to alienate an im

Stanford student body. Wo realize
that you think football, basket
i ball, track and soccer are the only
| sports which exist at Stanford,
I but there are others, and no mat
| ter how difficult it may be it is
I your duty to find out about them,
j Only in this way can The Daily

' m e d i o e r e advertising handbill

It is really sad when the sports
I which you choose to ignore at
(Stanford directly contribute to
j Olympic gold medals and other
i national honors. You dismiss all
'the news here at Stanford with
as much expanded advertising as
possible. For instance, the 1964
Olympics were important news lo
everyone and yet you chose to
virtually ignore the Games and
continue your head-in-the-ground
j policy.
Other teams at Stanford win a
j lot more consistently and contrib

I athletic standing in the West

football team. These other more
i successful teams will remain un
known to the student body in
spite of their greater contribu

i some effort to publicize their ac

SPORTS EDITORS NOTE: The
newspaper tries to give as much
coverage as possible to all sports
at Stanford. As an instance intra
murals are getting more cover
age than in the last, few years.
But space (which is dependent on
our financial status) severely
limits the amount of coverage
possible. Major intercollegiate
sports have top priority, natur
ally, and when space warrants,
we do plug other athletic endea
vors.
Besides the problem of space,
which is one of great magnitude,
there is the problem of securing
information, which you seem to
appreciate. Seeking out copy is
part of my job, but the athletic
department is my main source of
information.
The Daily sports department is
extremely receptive, and always
has been, to information regard
ing minor sports which we would
not normally see.
If more people would bring in
formal ion to the Daily instead of
criticizing our lack of coverage,
the problem you point out would
be partially solved. I doubt if il
can ever be solved to everyone's
satisfaction.
• Moderation JNo Virtue
Dear Sir:
j Sometimes what superficially
appears to be mature, reason
able attitude turns out upon in-
I spec!ion to be myopic and at
j worst cowardly. This remark is
i addressed to a very common posi
j lion expressed in an otherwise
j sensible editorial on the AWS sur
vey of attitudes concerning social
, regulations that appeared in the
| Jan. 5 issue of the Daily. The
i paragraph under scrutiny reads:
| "But at the same time students
j should recognize that the Univer
sity has to (leal with the public
j with potential donors and poten
: tial alumni or parents of alumni -
| whose opinions can be swayed by
the faintest suggestion of over
; liberality or possible promiscuity,
I especially as amplified by the
j distinguished journals of the Bay
: Area. The AWS recommendations
must take public opinion into ac
count." (emphasis added.) In
other words, administrative dcri

sions are strongly influenced by
external, conservative pressures,
and, therefore, progressive groups
within the university that seek
change must avoid actions that
tend to heighten these pressures.
This conventional "don't make
waves" approach to change has
broad appeal, but it is. nonethe
less, unrealistic.
One justification commonly
heard for this approach is a kind
of naive humanism- pity the
poor administrator buffeted by
all those conflicting pressures.
This is like pitying the musician
for practicing so much or the
scholar for thinking so hard. An
other argument proffered in de
fense of mincing moderation is
that any suspician of campus radi
calism will bring down such a
storm of mural and economic
sanctions on the university that
administrative intransigence will
set in like rigor mortis. This argu
ment is morally demeaning and
pragmatically spurious. It is de

other words, administrative dcri

sions are strongly influenced by
external, conservative pressures,
and, therefore, progressive groups
within the university that seek
change must avoid actions that
tend to heighten these pressures.
This conventional "don't make
waves" approach to change has
broad appeal, but it is. nonethe
less, unrealistic.
One justification commonly
heard for this approach is a kind
of naive humanism- pity the
poor administrator buffeted by
all those conflicting pressures.
This is like pitying the musician
for practicing so much or the
scholar for thinking so hard. An
other argument proffered in de
fense of mincing moderation is
that any suspician of campus radi
calism will bring down such a
storm of mural and economic
sanctions on the university that
administrative intransigence will
set in like rigor mortis. This argu
ment is morally demeaning and
pragmatically spurious. It is de
meaning because it justifies com
promising principles rather lhan
times and places. The impractical
ity of this what-will-the-British
think-if-wc-dump-the - tea - over
board mentality has been most
recently demonstrated by the UC
Free Speech controversy. After
failing to establish a dialogue via
the conventional channels, a
"bunch of beatnik, commy, delin
quent, out-of-state, minority-type,
rebellious kids" overcame a bad
and sometimes yellow press, Big
Daddy Unruh, Max Rafferty, Ed
ward Strong, and most impor
tantly. that bugaboo, public opin
ion. How? Why? Simply because
they were right.
The conclusion is that unneces
sary and premature compromise
is self-defeating, tactically un
.vise, and morally deteriorating.
Any proposed change in the estab
lished order will engender re
sistance. But the force of resis
tance is not so much a function
of how radical the change as it
is inversely related to the light
ness of the change.
It is indeed true that a dean's
lot is not an easy one. One of their
persistent nightmares is that of
the indignant parent demanding
an explanation for the delicate
condition of a daughter. Fear of
these and similar encounters is
undoubtedly a factor in the pro
liferation of rules and regulations
controlling social and political ac
tivity. But our understanding and
sympathy for our PR men should
not cloud our vision of a truly
free university.
It is time to end the experiment
on suspended maturation that has
been conducted by the high school
universities it has worked. If
getting away from home has any
thing to do with growing up, it
doesn't make much sense to per
petuate the function of a univer
sity as a big, cozy, surrogate fam
ily with local (or loco) parentis.
At I lie age of 18, parentis in ab
sentia should suffice. If not, then
no amount of coddling is going to

EDITOR'S NOTE: Relevant
facts which Mr. Soule may find
Useful: The FSM refused to
establish a dialogue and did
noi overcome public opinion or
win its final demands —in fact,
il caused irreparable harm to
the University in terms of na
tional reputation and probable
legislative repu missions.
We would agree, that the
AWS should press for broad re
forms, but the demands should
not be belligerent or, given the
attitudes of parents and stu
dents, impossible for the Ad
ministration lo accept.
Dear Sir:
Throughout the past quarter,
Stanford lias had an advantage
afforded few other universities
that of being close enough to the
Berkeley campus to be able to ob
serve the recent events there in
greater depth and with greater
understanding than those who
have had to rely entirely upon
national press coverage. This ad
vantage enabled many here to
perceive rapidly that the demon
strations at Cal could not be ex
plained as just normal student
restlessness or a traditional stu
dent challenge of authority. Much
to the disappointment of some
segments of society, neither could
they be attributed to some sin
ister leftist plot. It has become
more and more clear that the
roots of the present controversy
lie in areas of much greater sig
nificance, generating questions
such as what exactly is a univer
sity, what is the relationship be
tween the state and education,
are the faculty more than just
paid employees of some sort of
bureaucratic structure, and does
the word individual have any
meaning in Clark Kerr's multi
versity toward which many in
stitutions seem to be progress
ing?
What remains for us in th e
light of our observations of the
events at Cal and the thoughts
they have produced, is to ask
what insights can we gain into
our environment. It would seem
most logical at this point to first
direct our attention to the phil
osophical basis of education at
Stanford, for surely virtually all
decision making on lower levels
ultimately relates to this and
finds justification through it.
President Sterling has stated that
his philosophy of education is to
have no philosophy of education.
Last year, when pressed further
on the matter, he stated this
meant to combine the best pos
sible students with the best fac
ulty in as good a physical plant
as could be built. On January 13th,
President Sterling will deliver his
annual "state of the university"
address. 1 hope that he would ad
dress himself, in the light of
events at Cal, once again to his
philosophy of having no philoso
phy of education, to explain in
more detail, with respect to this
philosophy, upon what basis poli
cies are formulated and decisions
made. I hope that he would see
this as an opportune time to state
what precepts he believes lo be
basic to this university, precepts
that must be ident if ie d if
a thoughtful investigation of their
continuing validity and the valid
ity of the structures deriving
from them is to be undertaken.
I also hope that before the 13th,
students and faculty who share
this viewpoint will make it known
to the president. At this time, not
to demand more information
about this philosophy of no phil
osophy. not to demand to know
more about what standards arc
used to judge what iire the "best"
students, faculty members, and
facilities, not to demand that
more than chance determine the
outcome of the interaction of
those students, faculty, and facili
ties, and not to demand to know
what there is here that was lack
ing at Berkeley is to deny the
relevance of what happened at
CaL This would be a mistake.

Social Responsibility
Dear Sir:

Bringing existing regulations into
consonance with this ideal will
almost certainly require liberal

is thus not liberalization for its
own sake, but rather the develop

• Minor Sports Coverage
Your policy of continuing to ig

SPORTS EDITORS NOTE: The
newspaper tries to give as much
coverage as possible to all sports
at Stanford. As an instance intra
murals are getting more cover
age than in the last, few years.
But space (which is dependent on
our financial status) severely
limits the amount of coverage
possible. Major intercollegiate
sports have top priority, natur
ally, and when space warrants,
we do plug other athletic endea
vors.
Besides the problem of space,
which is one of great magnitude,
there is the problem of securing
information, which you seem to
appreciate. Seeking out copy is
part of my job, but the athletic
department is my main source of
information.
The Daily sports department is
extremely receptive, and always
has been, to information regard
ing minor sports which we would
not normally see.
If more people would bring in
formal ion to the Daily instead of
criticizing our lack of coverage,
the problem you point out would
be partially solved. I doubt if il
can ever be solved to everyone's
satisfaction.

j Sometimes what superficially
appears to be mature, reason
able attitude turns out upon in-
I spec!ion to be myopic and at
j worst cowardly. This remark is
i addressed to a very common posi
j lion expressed in an otherwise
j sensible editorial on the AWS sur
vey of attitudes concerning social
, regulations that appeared in the
| Jan. 5 issue of the Daily. The
i paragraph under scrutiny reads:
| "But at the same time students
j should recognize that the Univer
sity has to (leal with the public
j with potential donors and poten
: tial alumni or parents of alumni -
| whose opinions can be swayed by
the faintest suggestion of over
; liberality or possible promiscuity,
I especially as amplified by the
j distinguished journals of the Bay
: Area. The AWS recommendations
must take public opinion into ac
count." (emphasis added.) In
other words, administrative dcri

sions are strongly influenced by
external, conservative pressures,
and, therefore, progressive groups
within the university that seek
change must avoid actions that
tend to heighten these pressures.
This conventional "don't make
waves" approach to change has
broad appeal, but it is. nonethe
less, unrealistic.
One justification commonly
heard for this approach is a kind
of naive humanism- pity the
poor administrator buffeted by
all those conflicting pressures.
This is like pitying the musician
for practicing so much or the
scholar for thinking so hard. An
other argument proffered in de
fense of mincing moderation is
that any suspician of campus radi
calism will bring down such a
storm of mural and economic
sanctions on the university that
administrative intransigence will
set in like rigor mortis. This argu
ment is morally demeaning and
pragmatically spurious. It is de
meaning because it justifies com
promising principles rather lhan
times and places. The impractical
ity of this what-will-the-British
think-if-wc-dump-the - tea - over
board mentality has been most
recently demonstrated by the UC
Free Speech controversy. After
failing to establish a dialogue via
the conventional channels, a
"bunch of beatnik, commy, delin
quent, out-of-state, minority-type,
rebellious kids" overcame a bad
and sometimes yellow press, Big
Daddy Unruh, Max Rafferty, Ed
ward Strong, and most impor
tantly. that bugaboo, public opin
ion. How? Why? Simply because
they were right.
The conclusion is that unneces
sary and premature compromise
is self-defeating, tactically un
.vise, and morally deteriorating.
Any proposed change in the estab
lished order will engender re
sistance. But the force of resis
tance is not so much a function
of how radical the change as it
is inversely related to the light
ness of the change.
It is indeed true that a dean's
lot is not an easy one. One of their
persistent nightmares is that of
the indignant parent demanding
an explanation for the delicate
condition of a daughter. Fear of
these and similar encounters is
undoubtedly a factor in the pro
liferation of rules and regulations
controlling social and political ac
tivity. But our understanding and
sympathy for our PR men should
not cloud our vision of a truly
free university.
It is time to end the experiment
on suspended maturation that has
been conducted by the high school
universities it has worked. If
getting away from home has any
thing to do with growing up, it
doesn't make much sense to per
petuate the function of a univer
sity as a big, cozy, surrogate fam
ily with local (or loco) parentis.
At I lie age of 18, parentis in ab
sentia should suffice. If not, then
no amount of coddling is going to
accelerate development.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Relevant
facts which Mr. Soule may find
Useful: The FSM refused to
establish a dialogue and did
noi overcome public opinion or
win its final demands —in fact,
il caused irreparable harm to
the University in terms of na
tional reputation and probable
legislative repu missions.
We would agree, that the
AWS should press for broad re
forms, but the demands should
not be belligerent or, given the
attitudes of parents and stu
dents, impossible for the Ad
ministration lo accept.
