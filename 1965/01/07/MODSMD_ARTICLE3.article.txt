# Student Union Unifies Campus, Provides Center For Culture

shortly omt two years ago on

rial Union has rapidly become
the cultural and recreational
focus ol' the Stanford campus.
The reason for this success is
hard to isolate. It involves
thoughtful planning, efficient or
ganization and maaintenance, and
careful preparation and anticipa
tion of the future. More than any
thing. however, it is a new con

cept and philosophy of union op
eration that has established and
increased its appeal.
Scattered over a sprawling cam
pus thai is one of the largest in
the United States, over 9,000 stu
dents have little opportunity to
j meel each other outside of the
classroom. They live in small liv
; ing groups, in apartments, row
| houses, fraternity houses and dor
mitories. Often there is little or
I no interchange between these liv
i ing groups.
THUS. THE necessity of a com
' munity center has been recog
nized since very early in Stan
lord's history. As early as 1915
club houses were opened for both
men and women, largely on the
initiative of one of Stanford's
I most famous alumni. Herbert
Hoover.
In 1922, when these clubs were
found to be inadequate, the first
union was opened. The Stanford
Review said of it J "At last Stan
ford has ... a place where Row
I and Hall may feel equally at
home. Because of this fact it
should have a unifying effect on
the student body."
NEVERTHELESS, this new
union, too. was unsuccessful.
Perhaps the reason for this was
that it allowed only men co-eds
in those days shifted for them
selves. But perhaps the reason
was as Chester A. Berry, now
director of Tresidder Union be
lieves: the union never grew out
ol the social club stage.
Berry, in the May 1902 Stan
ford Review, discusses the chang
ing attitude of the Stanford stu
dent and how this attitude must
affect the conception of the com
! nmnilN conlor. Stanford students,

Berry believes, "are not satisfied
with the old patterns of collegiate
living. . . . Unless I miss my guess
today's college student is looking
to campus resources for stimula
tion and recreation. He wants to
know more about his fellow stu
dents and his faculty. He is re
ceptive to new ideas. . . . He is
quite willing to devote his free
time in an effort to make some
sort of synthesis of life."
Under Berry's leadership and
direction the new Tresidder Me
morial Union was conceived with
Ibis new and different attitude
in mind and it is still going
strong.
TRESIDDER Union was de
signed to bo more than a "service
station" type of union, although
it houses a barber shop, a res
taorant and a small store; more
than a "rumpus room" type of
union, although ii offers bowl
ing, billiards, ping pong and
chess. It was designed to pro
vide a social, cultural recreational
and intellectual program for the
whole campus, to serve as an
educational instrument, and to
offer something of value to any
one interested enough to take ad
vantage of its facilities.
Unlike Stanford's first unions,
Tresidder has grown out of the
"social club" stage. Music listen
ing rooms on the second floor
and an extensive record library
provide an opportunity for mem
bers of the Stanford community
to expose themselves to almost
every type of music from Li/st
to the Limclighters. A browsing
room contains hundreds of well
known books as well as a large
collodion of current newsnaners
and magazines from around the 1
world. A music practice room is
available for interested persons,
and Tresidder's prinl rental ser
vice allows students to hang in
their own rooms prints of the
world's greatest art masterpieces
for a very small sum.
ALL OF THESE facilities were
designed to contribute to the in
tellectual stimulation of the stu
dent as well as to provide recrea
tion and entertainment and keep
Tresidder from being merely a
social club. Tresidder's success in
this endeavor can in part be
measured by the large number of
persons who use and enjoy its
facilities every day.
These facilities, however, are
only one part of the cultural, so
cial and intellectual program
Tresidder offers to the Stanford
community. By far the largest
part is played by the student com
mittees which plan and direct the
various aspects of the total pro
gram.

The reason for this success is

Scattered over a sprawling cam

THUS. THE necessity of a com
' munity center has been recog
nized since very early in Stan
lord's history. As early as 1915
club houses were opened for both
men and women, largely on the
initiative of one of Stanford's
I most famous alumni. Herbert
Hoover.
In 1922, when these clubs were
found to be inadequate, the first
union was opened. The Stanford
Review said of it J "At last Stan
ford has ... a place where Row
I and Hall may feel equally at
home. Because of this fact it
should have a unifying effect on
the student body."
NEVERTHELESS, this new
union, too. was unsuccessful.
Perhaps the reason for this was
that it allowed only men co-eds
in those days shifted for them
selves. But perhaps the reason
was as Chester A. Berry, now
director of Tresidder Union be
lieves: the union never grew out
ol the social club stage.
Berry, in the May 1902 Stan
ford Review, discusses the chang
ing attitude of the Stanford stu
dent and how this attitude must
affect the conception of the com
! nmnilN conlor. Stanford students,

Berry believes, "are not satisfied
with the old patterns of collegiate
living. . . . Unless I miss my guess
today's college student is looking
to campus resources for stimula
tion and recreation. He wants to
know more about his fellow stu
dents and his faculty. He is re
ceptive to new ideas. . . . He is
quite willing to devote his free
time in an effort to make some
sort of synthesis of life."
Under Berry's leadership and
direction the new Tresidder Me
morial Union was conceived with
Ibis new and different attitude
in mind and it is still going
strong.
TRESIDDER Union was de
signed to bo more than a "service
station" type of union, although
it houses a barber shop, a res
taorant and a small store; more
than a "rumpus room" type of
union, although ii offers bowl
ing, billiards, ping pong and
chess. It was designed to pro
vide a social, cultural recreational
and intellectual program for the
whole campus, to serve as an
educational instrument, and to
offer something of value to any
one interested enough to take ad
vantage of its facilities.
Unlike Stanford's first unions,
Tresidder has grown out of the
"social club" stage. Music listen
ing rooms on the second floor
and an extensive record library
provide an opportunity for mem
bers of the Stanford community
to expose themselves to almost
every type of music from Li/st
to the Limclighters. A browsing
room contains hundreds of well
known books as well as a large
collodion of current newsnaners
and magazines from around the 1
world. A music practice room is
available for interested persons,
and Tresidder's prinl rental ser
vice allows students to hang in
their own rooms prints of the
world's greatest art masterpieces
for a very small sum.

to the Limclighters. A browsing
room contains hundreds of well
known books as well as a large

vice allows students to hang in
their own rooms prints of the
world's greatest art masterpieces
for a very small sum.
ALL OF THESE facilities were
designed to contribute to the in
tellectual stimulation of the stu

Tresidder from being merely a
social club. Tresidder's success in
this endeavor can in part be
measured by the large number of
persons who use and enjoy its
facilities every day.
These facilities, however, are
only one part of the cultural, so

Tresidder offers to the Stanford
community. By far the largest
part is played by the student com

Completed and dedicated
shortly omt two years ago on
Sept. 29, 1962, Tresidder Memo
rial Union has rapidly become
the cultural and recreational
focus ol' the Stanford campus.
The reason for this success is
hard to isolate. It involves
thoughtful planning, efficient or
ganization and maaintenance, and
careful preparation and anticipa
tion of the future. More than any
thing. however, it is a new con

cept and philosophy of union op
eration that has established and
increased its appeal.
Scattered over a sprawling cam
pus thai is one of the largest in
the United States, over 9,000 stu
dents have little opportunity to
j meel each other outside of the
classroom. They live in small liv
; ing groups, in apartments, row
| houses, fraternity houses and dor
mitories. Often there is little or
I no interchange between these liv
i ing groups.
THUS. THE necessity of a com
' munity center has been recog
nized since very early in Stan
lord's history. As early as 1915
club houses were opened for both
men and women, largely on the
initiative of one of Stanford's
I most famous alumni. Herbert
Hoover.
In 1922, when these clubs were
found to be inadequate, the first
union was opened. The Stanford
Review said of it J "At last Stan
ford has ... a place where Row
I and Hall may feel equally at
home. Because of this fact it
should have a unifying effect on
the student body."
NEVERTHELESS, this new
union, too. was unsuccessful.
Perhaps the reason for this was
that it allowed only men co-eds
in those days shifted for them
selves. But perhaps the reason
was as Chester A. Berry, now
director of Tresidder Union be
lieves: the union never grew out
ol the social club stage.
Berry, in the May 1902 Stan
ford Review, discusses the chang
ing attitude of the Stanford stu
dent and how this attitude must
affect the conception of the com
! nmnilN conlor. Stanford students,

Berry believes, "are not satisfied
with the old patterns of collegiate
living. . . . Unless I miss my guess
today's college student is looking
to campus resources for stimula
tion and recreation. He wants to
know more about his fellow stu
dents and his faculty. He is re
ceptive to new ideas. . . . He is
quite willing to devote his free
time in an effort to make some
sort of synthesis of life."
Under Berry's leadership and
direction the new Tresidder Me
morial Union was conceived with
Ibis new and different attitude
in mind and it is still going
strong.
TRESIDDER Union was de
signed to bo more than a "service
station" type of union, although
it houses a barber shop, a res
taorant and a small store; more
than a "rumpus room" type of
union, although ii offers bowl
ing, billiards, ping pong and
chess. It was designed to pro
vide a social, cultural recreational
and intellectual program for the
whole campus, to serve as an
educational instrument, and to
offer something of value to any
one interested enough to take ad
vantage of its facilities.
Unlike Stanford's first unions,
Tresidder has grown out of the
"social club" stage. Music listen
ing rooms on the second floor
and an extensive record library
provide an opportunity for mem
bers of the Stanford community
to expose themselves to almost
every type of music from Li/st
to the Limclighters. A browsing
room contains hundreds of well
known books as well as a large
collodion of current newsnaners
and magazines from around the 1
world. A music practice room is
available for interested persons,
and Tresidder's prinl rental ser
vice allows students to hang in
their own rooms prints of the
world's greatest art masterpieces
for a very small sum.
ALL OF THESE facilities were
designed to contribute to the in
tellectual stimulation of the stu
dent as well as to provide recrea
tion and entertainment and keep
Tresidder from being merely a
social club. Tresidder's success in
this endeavor can in part be
measured by the large number of
persons who use and enjoy its
facilities every day.
These facilities, however, are
only one part of the cultural, so
cial and intellectual program
Tresidder offers to the Stanford
community. By far the largest

mittees which plan and direct the
