## Did Cal Tremors Shake Stanford Administrators? 
### Justin Beck 
Anarch)', after a brief reign at Cal, is once again unemployed.
The professional agitators, who apparently sprang full) bearded
from the basement of Sproul flail, have finally receded from
print and prose.
But tremors from the East Bay anarchy, as Pat Brown, the

j state's anti-anarchy governor,'
i termed it, have shaken the heart
of school administrators every
where. Even here, one suspects,
visions of Mario are dancing, like
sugarplums, in President Ster
j ling's head.
Sterling's AiMiual Address
Shortly President Sterling will
| deliver his annual stale of the uni
versity address, and it will be in
teresting to sec if the stimulus
of potential revolution has
breathed any life into his norm
ally dull report on the glories of
n liberal education, particularly
the Stanford variety.
However, a long tradition of un
inspired speeches is hard to break,
especially since the President's
brand ol inspiration is generally
in fiscal matters. While President
Sterling tries hard to keep in con
tact with student opinion, thus
learning himself a gold star for
effort, one doubts that he has any
tie with current student feeling.
After alt. when was the last time
ho had a beer at the "O?"
Mcßride Über Alles
This is where student govern
ment enters the picture, for it is
the opinion of ASSU President
Scott Mcßride that is most likely
to be heard by administration
figures.
At Cal, the student body Presi
dent, one Charlie Powell, proved
conclusively that failure is un
pleasant. Powell, and the rest of
the student government, by the
Christmas break, had been re
duced from non-entity to absurd
ity.
The only thing that saved
Powell from removal from office
was the fact that he was gener
ally forgotten, if lie had ever been
known.
The Cal Senate Failure
The Cal Senate, too. failed in its
job. Its members know parliamen
tary procedure to be sure, but
, that was the limit of their capa
| bilities. Great debates were held,
j and sterling rhetoric flowed, but
! nobody had any ideas or concept
of student opinion.
Here though. Scott Mcßride
gives the optimistic some grounds
for joy. And LASSU has stumbled
from abject failure to mediocrity,
a heady height for the Legisla
ture considering some past per
formances.
Mcßride, while he is not th c
] liberal nor the leader that some
: of his predecessors have been, is

probably a good indicator of stu
dent opinion. And he is competent,
clean-cut. and well-liked by the
l administration.
However, the last quarter was
i quiet, as few of the problems
J facing the student body were
tackled by student government.
And if Mcßride doesn't ask any
questions, it is highly unlikely
that the administration will give
any answers, evasive, as is usually
the case, or otherwise.
What Should Sterling Say?
One proposal that has some
merit is that Mcßride should call
ja meeting of student leaders at
which time areas of pressing con
cern to the student body should
be outlined. Mcßride could then
submit the list to President Ster
ling, giving the President some
! idea of what the student body
would like to hear about. Ster
ling, who, it is likely, seldom
bothers to determine student con
cerns, might welcome some sug
gestions.
Perhaps, however, he would
not. One recalls the student ad
| visory committee, composed of
; student leaders wlrr> supposedly
j advise the President. Last year,
I however, the committee was not
asked for advise, receiving in
stead instruction in such matters
as University finance. This year
it has not yet met.
Student Discontent Prevented
Some of the problems that
caused the riots at Cal are pres
ent here, basically the lack of com
munication between student, and
administration. So far, liberal
University regulations in most
fields, student apathy, and at
tempts by student leaders 1o ne
giotate with the administration
have prevented any discontent.
However, one doubts lhat this
atmosphere can long be main
tained. if the administration con
tinues its rigid and too often silent
approach to matters of student
concern. President Sterling's state
of the University speech may
[give an indication of any change
in attitude. If not, at least the
seats in Mem And are comfort
able, so the occasion won't be
totally wasted.
In the meantime would-be riot
ers at Stanford, bearded agitators,
seeking to lose amateur status,
and other such malcontents
should best head up to Cal. That's
where all the fun it.

Student Discontent Prevented
Some of the problems that
caused the riots at Cal are pres
ent here, basically the lack of com
munication between student, and
administration. So far, liberal
University regulations in most
fields, student apathy, and at
tempts by student leaders 1o ne
giotate with the administration
have prevented any discontent.
However, one doubts lhat this
atmosphere can long be main
tained. if the administration con
tinues its rigid and too often silent
approach to matters of student
concern. President Sterling's state
of the University speech may
[give an indication of any change
in attitude. If not, at least the
seats in Mem And are comfort
able, so the occasion won't be
totally wasted.
In the meantime would-be riot
ers at Stanford, bearded agitators,
seeking to lose amateur status,
and other such malcontents
should best head up to Cal. That's
where all the fun it.
Anarch)', after a brief reign at Cal, is once again unemployed.
The professional agitators, who apparently sprang full) bearded
from the basement of Sproul flail, have finally receded from
print and prose.
But tremors from the East Bay anarchy, as Pat Brown, the

j state's anti-anarchy governor,'
i termed it, have shaken the heart
of school administrators every
where. Even here, one suspects,
visions of Mario are dancing, like
sugarplums, in President Ster
j ling's head.
Sterling's AiMiual Address
Shortly President Sterling will
| deliver his annual stale of the uni
versity address, and it will be in
teresting to sec if the stimulus
of potential revolution has
breathed any life into his norm
ally dull report on the glories of
n liberal education, particularly
the Stanford variety.
However, a long tradition of un
inspired speeches is hard to break,
especially since the President's
brand ol inspiration is generally
in fiscal matters. While President
Sterling tries hard to keep in con
tact with student opinion, thus
learning himself a gold star for
effort, one doubts that he has any
tie with current student feeling.

Mcßride Über Alles
This is where student govern
ment enters the picture, for it is
the opinion of ASSU President
Scott Mcßride that is most likely
to be heard by administration
figures.
At Cal, the student body Presi
dent, one Charlie Powell, proved
conclusively that failure is un
pleasant. Powell, and the rest of
the student government, by the
Christmas break, had been re
duced from non-entity to absurd
ity.
The only thing that saved
Powell from removal from office
was the fact that he was gener
ally forgotten, if lie had ever been
known.
The Cal Senate Failure
The Cal Senate, too. failed in its
job. Its members know parliamen
tary procedure to be sure, but
, that was the limit of their capa
| bilities. Great debates were held,
j and sterling rhetoric flowed, but
! nobody had any ideas or concept
of student opinion.
Here though. Scott Mcßride
gives the optimistic some grounds
for joy. And LASSU has stumbled
from abject failure to mediocrity,
a heady height for the Legisla
ture considering some past per
formances.
Mcßride, while he is not th c
] liberal nor the leader that some
: of his predecessors have been, is

probably a good indicator of stu
dent opinion. And he is competent,
clean-cut. and well-liked by the
l administration.
However, the last quarter was
i quiet, as few of the problems
J facing the student body were
tackled by student government.
And if Mcßride doesn't ask any
questions, it is highly unlikely
that the administration will give
any answers, evasive, as is usually
the case, or otherwise.
What Should Sterling Say?
One proposal that has some
merit is that Mcßride should call
ja meeting of student leaders at
which time areas of pressing con
cern to the student body should
be outlined. Mcßride could then
submit the list to President Ster
ling, giving the President some
! idea of what the student body
would like to hear about. Ster
ling, who, it is likely, seldom
bothers to determine student con
cerns, might welcome some sug
gestions.
Perhaps, however, he would
not. One recalls the student ad

formances.
Mcßride, while he is not th c
] liberal nor the leader that some
: of his predecessors have been, is

probably a good indicator of stu
dent opinion. And he is competent,
clean-cut. and well-liked by the
l administration.
However, the last quarter was
i quiet, as few of the problems
J facing the student body were
tackled by student government.
And if Mcßride doesn't ask any
questions, it is highly unlikely
that the administration will give
any answers, evasive, as is usually
the case, or otherwise.
What Should Sterling Say?
One proposal that has some
merit is that Mcßride should call
ja meeting of student leaders at
which time areas of pressing con
cern to the student body should
be outlined. Mcßride could then
submit the list to President Ster
ling, giving the President some
! idea of what the student body
would like to hear about. Ster
ling, who, it is likely, seldom
bothers to determine student con
cerns, might welcome some sug
gestions.
Perhaps, however, he would
not. One recalls the student ad
| visory committee, composed of
; student leaders wlrr> supposedly
j advise the President. Last year,
I however, the committee was not
asked for advise, receiving in
stead instruction in such matters
as University finance. This year
it has not yet met.
Student Discontent Prevented
Some of the problems that
caused the riots at Cal are pres
ent here, basically the lack of com
munication between student, and
administration. So far, liberal
University regulations in most
fields, student apathy, and at
tempts by student leaders 1o ne
giotate with the administration
have prevented any discontent.
However, one doubts lhat this
atmosphere can long be main
tained. if the administration con
tinues its rigid and too often silent
approach to matters of student
concern. President Sterling's state
of the University speech may
[give an indication of any change
in attitude. If not, at least the
seats in Mem And are comfort
able, so the occasion won't be
totally wasted.
In the meantime would-be riot
ers at Stanford, bearded agitators,
seeking to lose amateur status,
and other such malcontents
should best head up to Cal. That's
where all the fun it.
Anarch)', after a brief reign at Cal, is once again unemployed.
The professional agitators, who apparently sprang full) bearded
from the basement of Sproul flail, have finally receded from
print and prose.
But tremors from the East Bay anarchy, as Pat Brown, the

j state's anti-anarchy governor,'
i termed it, have shaken the heart
of school administrators every
where. Even here, one suspects,
visions of Mario are dancing, like
sugarplums, in President Ster
j ling's head.
Sterling's AiMiual Address
Shortly President Sterling will
| deliver his annual stale of the uni
versity address, and it will be in
teresting to sec if the stimulus
of potential revolution has
breathed any life into his norm
ally dull report on the glories of
n liberal education, particularly
the Stanford variety.
However, a long tradition of un
inspired speeches is hard to break,
especially since the President's
brand ol inspiration is generally
in fiscal matters. While President
Sterling tries hard to keep in con
tact with student opinion, thus
learning himself a gold star for
effort, one doubts that he has any
tie with current student feeling.
After alt. when was the last time
ho had a beer at the "O?"
Mcßride Über Alles
This is where student govern
ment enters the picture, for it is
the opinion of ASSU President
Scott Mcßride that is most likely
to be heard by administration
figures.
At Cal, the student body Presi
dent, one Charlie Powell, proved
conclusively that failure is un
pleasant. Powell, and the rest of
the student government, by the
Christmas break, had been re
duced from non-entity to absurd
ity.
The only thing that saved
Powell from removal from office
was the fact that he was gener
ally forgotten, if lie had ever been
known.
The Cal Senate Failure
The Cal Senate, too. failed in its
job. Its members know parliamen
tary procedure to be sure, but
, that was the limit of their capa
| bilities. Great debates were held,
j and sterling rhetoric flowed, but
! nobody had any ideas or concept
of student opinion.
Here though. Scott Mcßride
gives the optimistic some grounds
for joy. And LASSU has stumbled
from abject failure to mediocrity,
a heady height for the Legisla
ture considering some past per
formances.
Mcßride, while he is not th c
