## Cranston Urges Sound Politics 
### MEL KNOX 
California is an important
state in an important democracy.
What Calilornians tlo in local
matters will have a strong im
pact 011 America and the out
side world, according to Califor
nia State Controller Alan Cran
ston.
Cranston presented this theme
to a surprisingly large audience
last night in <he first of a series
oi talks sponsored by the Law
forum on "Great Political
Issues."
Cranston, whose assigned topic
was "California at. Mid-Passage
in the Mid-Sixties," tied national
and international< problems with
local conditions in California.
Cranston began by citing three
major world problems; nuclear
arms, race problems, and over
population.
The great question. Cranston
said, is "whether man will use
his great wisdom to end war or
will he use it for selfish purposes
and allow mankind to wither
away."
He then went on to demonstrate
California's importance in the
world and why he feels Califor
nians must act responsibly.
California is already first in
terms of foreign exports, agricul
ture, defense and electronic in
dustries and education and re
search, he said.
"We (Californians* are uniquely
positioned in these times."
He went into detail regarding
the educational facilities in Cali
fornia. Forty-two per cent of all
state funds, he said, already go
into educational purposes.
Every week, he pointed out,
two high schools and three ele
mentary schools are built in Cali
fornia.
Though there are many prob
lem fields in which Californians
cannot act directly, conservation
is the one area in which Califor
nians and Californians alone can
act.
"We may blame Mao-Tse-Tung
and his successors for polluting
the world's air with nuclear
weapons, but whom can we blame
when we pollute the San Fran
cisco Bay and fill it with sand?"
Cranston queried.
Every week in Los Angeles
County alone, 100 acres of open
field arc bulldozed for roads,
housing developments, or indus
trial sites, he stated.
"Sooner or later." he warned,
"the only available space will go
up and down."
"Things which are under our
control," he concluded, "are out
of control because of a lack of
planning."
