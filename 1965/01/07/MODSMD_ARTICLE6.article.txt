convincing the voters that two

Things don't look calm on the
Democratic side either. Cran

again simply to keep Party peace;

! or the Attorney Generalship, then
there will be a free for all, "if
there isn't one anyway."
Cranston, though a candidate
for the Senate himself in the last
election, denied that he had any
aspirations for the Governor's

Controller again," he declared.
