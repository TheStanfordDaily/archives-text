The Stanford GCC was formed
on December 15, 1961 by gradu
ate students from several depart
ments. It's most important objec
tive is the protection of academic
freedom and students' civil rights.
During dead week and final
exam week of autumn quarter,
; the GCC distributed fact sheets
and collected signatures of 1,200
| students for a petition sent to
■■ the Board of Regents of the Uni
versity of California. The petition
expressed support of the Ber
keley faculty's resolution uphold
ing the demands of the FSM.
| Rather than becoming an ad
| hoc group concerned only with
the FSM problem, however, the
; GCC desires to become a perman
ent organization on the Stanford
campus to represent the opinions
and interests of graduate stu
dents.
Two of the more controversial
issues presently under GCC dis
i cussion include elimination of the
university's function in loco pa
rentis and unionizing teaching
assistants and employed graduate
students.
