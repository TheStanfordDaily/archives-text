fied the Security Council yesterday it will
seek U.N. aid immediately in the event Indo

Indonesian withdrawal from the United Na
tions.
Radhakrishna Ramani, Malaysia's perman

sia has staged a heavy military buildup along

donesia.
In a letter to Chinese Nationalist Ambas

the southwest coast of the Malay Peninsula.
Ramani expressed confidence that Malay

condemnation of Indonesia, or to ask for a
U.N. peacekeeping force, or ask for observers
or whatever is appropriate."

NATIONAL
• Medicare Virtually Assured
WASHINGTON—WhiIe opposition melted,
President Johnson sent to Congress yesterday
a huge package of health proposals, keyed to
insure hospital care for the elderly and a na
tionwide attack on killer diseases.
Early approval of at least the program
for health care for the elderly under the So
cial Security system seemed virtually assured
when Rep. Wilbur D. Mills, D.-Ark., all but
lined up behind the administration plan.
As chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, Mills has done more than any
other single member of Congress to block a
Social Security health care program. But he
told newsmen yesterday changes in the pro
posed method of financing meet his basic re
quirements. He forecast a House vote by
March.

• Proposal To Sfilit California
SACRAMENTO — The Senate will receive
legislation early next week proposing to split
California into two states.
Chief sponsor of the measures, Sen. Rich
ard J. Dolwig, R. San Mateo, said he believes
the proposals offer a good, practical solution
to the reapportionment problem.
Stan Wiseman, Dolwig's administrative
assistant, said yesterday in an interview the
legislation would be presented in the follow
ing form:
Natural boundary lines would be used,
such as the Tehachapi Mountains. "However,"
said Wiseman, "Santa Barbara would be in
cluded in the northern section."
The amendment would have to be approved
by two-thirds of the legislature and then sub
mitted to a vote of the people.
