## Joseph Jacobs, Entertainment Editor 'Auntie Mame’ A Comic Feast 
### 
"Life is a banquet," says Maine
Dennis, "and most poor sons of
bitches are starving to death."
Anyone who goes to San Car
los' Circle Star Theatre is in little
danger of such starvation, how
ever, for with "Auntie Mame" di
rector Ernest Sarracino ha s
served up a delightfully comic
feast.
The plot—as adapted by Jerome
Lawrence and Robert E. Lee from
Patrick Dennis' novel—deals with
Patrick's highly unorthodox and
unfailingly hilarious upbringing
by his Auntie Mame.
Covers 18 Years
It starts in 1928 at the height
of the Roaring Twenties (and
with Mame they do roar!), roams
from New York to Connecticut,
Georgia, Egypt, Switzerland and
India, finally returning to New
York in 1946 with Mame, as al
ways a Pied Piper, still opening
j doors that people never dreamed
existed.
As Mame, Gisele MacKonzie
gives a winning performance. Al
though every move and gesture
she makes is extravagant, she
loses none of Maine's essential
warmth and charm.
The supporting cast is also ex
cellent. Ann B. Davis' perform
ance as Agnes Gooch is hysteri
cally funny; just by walking
around a table she can bring down
the house.
First Rate Cast
Grant Sullivan, as Maine's
southern-accented, camera happy
husband; Shirley Chambers, as a
perpetually drunk actress; an d
Ida Mae McKenzie and Yuki Shi
moda as Mame's servants are all
first rate. Especially outstanding
are Mary Niendorf as Patrick's
fiance and Pauline Drake an d
Robert Nash as her appallingly
proper parents; Miss Niendorf's
ping pong tournament speech is
the high point of the play's best
scene.
Art Alisi, Hem-y Hunter, Mi
chael Brooks, Brian Johnson, Roy
Johnson and Dot tie Beebe all con
tribute effective portrayals. So,
in fact, does everyone else in the
1 cast excepl Perry Roberts who—
j as the grown-up Patrick —is sim
i ply inadequate.
Hal Shafer's scenery, although
unable to fully suggest the plush
ness of Auntie Mame's world, is
generally quite good as is A 1 Mill
man's lighting.

"Life is a banquet," says Maine
Dennis, "and most poor sons of
bitches are starving to death."
Anyone who goes to San Car
los' Circle Star Theatre is in little
danger of such starvation, how
ever, for with "Auntie Mame" di
rector Ernest Sarracino ha s
served up a delightfully comic
feast.
The plot—as adapted by Jerome
Lawrence and Robert E. Lee from
Patrick Dennis' novel—deals with
Patrick's highly unorthodox and
unfailingly hilarious upbringing
by his Auntie Mame.
Covers 18 Years
It starts in 1928 at the height
of the Roaring Twenties (and
with Mame they do roar!), roams
from New York to Connecticut,
Georgia, Egypt, Switzerland and
India, finally returning to New
York in 1946 with Mame, as al
ways a Pied Piper, still opening
j doors that people never dreamed
existed.
As Mame, Gisele MacKonzie
gives a winning performance. Al
though every move and gesture
she makes is extravagant, she
loses none of Maine's essential
warmth and charm.
The supporting cast is also ex
cellent. Ann B. Davis' perform
ance as Agnes Gooch is hysteri
cally funny; just by walking
around a table she can bring down
the house.
First Rate Cast
Grant Sullivan, as Maine's
southern-accented, camera happy
husband; Shirley Chambers, as a
perpetually drunk actress; an d
Ida Mae McKenzie and Yuki Shi
moda as Mame's servants are all
first rate. Especially outstanding
are Mary Niendorf as Patrick's
fiance and Pauline Drake an d
Robert Nash as her appallingly
proper parents; Miss Niendorf's
ping pong tournament speech is
the high point of the play's best
scene.
Art Alisi, Hem-y Hunter, Mi
chael Brooks, Brian Johnson, Roy
Johnson and Dot tie Beebe all con
tribute effective portrayals. So,
in fact, does everyone else in the
1 cast excepl Perry Roberts who—
j as the grown-up Patrick —is sim
i ply inadequate.
Hal Shafer's scenery, although
