# Stanford Cagers Open League Vs. Mediocre Cougers, Huskies
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's basketball team be
! gins its quest for iho 1965 Pacific
j Athletic Conference title this
weekend against two mediocre
i squads from Washington. The In-
I dians, with a 5-2 record, meet
! Washington State 12-8) tonight at
I 8 p.m. in the Pavilion and Wash
ington (2-6) tomorrow afternoon
j at 3 p.m. in a televised clash.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar,
i who worriedly bit his nails dur
ing November practice sessions,
was "real pleased with the team's
progress in December." The ma
jor pleasant surprises have been
forward Jack Gilbert, guard Mike
Preisler, and center Ray Kosanke.
GILBERT HIT for 24 points,
I the team's individual high, against
| Oregon, and has improved greatly
i over last year. Preisler has added
needed speed and quickness to the
Indian backcourt, and Kosanke,
long hampered by poor health,
has boosted his scoring tremen
dously, with 21 points against
tough Wyoming. He has hit 18 of
19 free throws.
Of the two visiting teams the
I better is Washington, although
' the Huskies are as puzzling this
! year as they have been in past
| years. The team has lost three
i games by one point, yet has
' shocked last season's number
three team, Kansas State.
In the past, the Huskies have
given Tribe rooters more laughs
than the Sunday flicks. They
scrambled up and down the court,
throwing the ball away, fouling
flagrantly, and blowing easy lay
ups as Stanford breezed to five
straight Pavilion wins.
THIS SEASON coach Mac
i Duckworth has added something

new—a fast break—and appar
ently Washington has Ihe ball
handling ability to make it work.
Forward Lynn Nance leads Husky
scorers with a 14.5 average, and
is also their best rebounder. Guard
Steve Olson averages 12 points
and is the key to the fast break.
He is excellent on drives under
the basket and has a deadly out
side shot. Massive forward Bruce
Brickner (6-7, 204 lbs. i adds 11
points a game. The Husky front
line averages 6-7 V-j and should
give the Tribe's vaunted board
strength quiet a test.
However, while the Husky at
taek is more sobering this year,
their defense ought to provide
several chuckles. They play man
to-man, with an occasional zone,
and are vulnerable to screens and
quick passes. Their opponents
have been shooting at a 43 per
cent clip, helped out by numer
ous lay-up opportunities.
IF WASHINGTON is unpre
dictably good and bad, Washing
ton State is predictably bad. The
team's leading scorer, Randy
Stoll, was declared scholastically
ineligible this week. That will
leave the scoring burden on 6-8
center Ted Werner, who averages
10 points a game. Dallmar tabs
him "big, strong, experienced, and
a hard worker," but he will be
hard pressed to carry the load
along with Dennis Kloke, a sharp
shooting guard. The Cougars
have lost six games by five points
or less, however, and could sur
prise the Cards.
Should the games be close,
Stanford will have an edge at the

free throw line. The Cougars j
average 24 fouls a game and
Washington 22, while the Indians j
commit only 16. What's more,
Stanford has a hoi 72 per cenl |
free throw average, while WSU '
and Washington hit only <34 and ;
."58 per cent, respectively.
The games will mark the lasl
conference home action until Feb.
12, with only a Jan. 28 Santa
Barbara home game in between.
