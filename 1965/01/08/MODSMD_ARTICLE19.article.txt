# ‘Dialogue’ At Berkeley Produced No Winners
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
"Frankly, 1 don't give a damn about tree
speech."
"That's unfortunate, because frankly I'm tired
of being sliat upon."
Though both callous and vulgar, this exchange,
which took place between an irate member of
the University of California Administration and
one of the dissidents on the FSM Steering Com
mittee at the height of the? demonstrations last
quarter, is revealing on several counts.
It shows that although the FSM was correct
in claiming that no real "dialogue" existed be
tween them and Chancellor Strong's office, they
were doing little Jo facilitate matters. And it makes
one wonder whether a peaceful accommodation
might not have been reached earlier if the FSM
while presenting their case vigorously—had not
gone out of its way to alienate anyone who dis
agreed with it.
Tactics Unnecessarily Antagonistic
As Alan Cranston put it recently, the FSM did
have a "legitimate grievance which was being
handled ineptly." But most people, even a very
liberal politician such as Cranston, felt that their
tactics were "unnecessarily antagonistic."
Both sides emerged or, rather, have begun to
emerge from the episode with tarnished reputa
tions. The reasons are not hard to find.
Both sides violated what are commonly called
the "rules of the game" in the American political
process. Most people, it is true, "don't give a damn
about free speech," at least not as long as such
activity is academic and not activist.
However, nearly every American believes in
the nebulous democratic credo of free thought,
free association and free speech. Thus, when the
students moved for increased freedom of political
advocacy and action, the Administration had to
find a rationalization if it wished to continue
denying these freedoms.
Historically, two concepts have been used to
justify such abrogation. The powers that be can
claim to perceive a "higher good" which compels
them to assert their moral authority in the name
of God or History. Yet even if we ignore the fact
that this sanction has rarely been invoked in this
country, not too many would claim that either
God or History are anything but neutral in this
cosmic contest.
Suppression In The Name Of Order
Therefore, the Administration, with the Re
gents of the State of California behind it, had to
use the other concept—the rule of law. Suppres
sion, since it could not come in the name of God,
had to come in the name of order. The Governor
cited "anarchy" on the campus, the police moved
in and the mass media sadly concluded that some
students had no respect for law and order.
Unfortunately, most of the mass media have
succumbed to a crude and sometimes paranoid
analysis of the problem. Those who want to change

rules regulating political activity at the University
of California find themselves branded as anarch- j
ists duped and paid by "foreign money."
At the same time, most of the press finds it i
necessary to somehow prove that the FSM is an i
atypical aberration which really doesn't reflect stu- J
dent thinking. The prime movers in the FSM, we
are told, are non-students; the leaders Mario
Savio and Arthur Goldberg are depicted as
"drop-outs" or photographed as sibling idiots.
This violence can be explained in part by an
increased need for justification in the light of the
FSM's non-violent civil disobedience. The average
American would find them easier to understand
if they were violent like the Muslims or obviously
sick like the Klansmen and the Nazis.
Criticism Partly FSM-Provoked
However, a certain amount of this depreciation
is purposely provoked by the FSM. Though not all
its members are consicentiously gross and unkept.
many seem to take a masochistic pleasure in
affronting any and all of the conventional mores.
One must wince along with the delighted civil
authoritarians when Mario Savio announces to
a mixed audience of several hundred that the
FSM has updated the old revolutionary slogan of
"Don't Tread On Me" to read "Don't ' ; ?! * On Me."
It seems that some members of the FSM have
a psychological need to achieve social and/or I
political martyrdom. If the Administration or so
ciety as a whole admitted the validity of their
claims without undue resistance, some would un- 1
doubtedly feel a need to move on to another any
other—cause that would illuminate the distinction
between them and the masses.
Savio Is No Socrates
The problem of institutionalizing dissent, then, |
is not really a clear-cut issue. One balks at com- j
paring Mario Savio to Socrates, although both
raise some fundamental questions about the theory j
and practice of democracy. And even if the two j
could be compared the conservative arguments of
Burke and Buckley have some validity. The state, j
as well as the individual, has rights. Thus, those
who wish to break the "continuity" of the state
perhaps, one should say the status quo must ex
pect an initial negative reaction and compensate
for it.
Recently, both the media and the Regents have
made concrete attempts at conciliation. And al
though newspapers such as the St. Louis Globe-
Democrat may still feel compelled to decry the
presence of "leftist folksinger Joan Baez" at an
FSM rally, Life magazine has begun to cover the
issues as well as the student apparel.
The cycle, thus, is neanng completion. The
student rebellion approaches victory, yet the rebels
themselves face condemnation, not praise. Perhaps
they deserve both, yet those who would cry "an
archy" should first contemplate the number of
routes open in this society for dissent. Right now
it boils down to illegal demonstrations and ap
pearances on the Les Crane Show.
