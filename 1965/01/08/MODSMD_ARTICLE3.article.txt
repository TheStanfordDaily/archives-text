### BRUCE BURTON 
A group of Stanford graduate
students, first formed in Decem
ber to discuss and support objec
tives of the Free Speech Move
ment at the University of Cali
fornia, has now declared itself a
permanent fixture on this cam
pus.
The Graduate Coordinating
Committee, chartered December
lfj by the University, has set it
self up as a "permanent organiza
tion on the Stanford campus to
represent the opinions and inter
ests of graduate students before
the University as a whole and the

public," according lo a statement
issued yesterday.
ILMAK WALDNER. a member
of the philosophy department
and chairman of the executive
committee of the 100-member
group, said yesterday the GCC
was "primarily interested in this
thing at Berkeley," but would ex
plore certain issue on iho Stan
ford campus.
Some of these issues were, ac
cording to the statement, "the
elimination of the university's in
loco parentis, and the unionisa
tion of teaching assistants and
employed graduate students.
Waldner pointed out, however,
lhat these wore merely issues in
which the GCC was interested.
No definite action or general dis
cussion by members has yel been
made, he said.
SPEAKING OF GCC support of
the Berkeley movement, Waldner
said that his group "supports in
general the major objectives of
the FSM." but was "not in a po
sition to judge the tactics" of that
organization.
When asked if he thought the
GCC could become another Free
Speech Movement, Waldner stated
that "if there's an issue, it could
be but as yet we can see no
flagrant violation" of student
rights on the Stanford campus.
The graduate student organiza
tion has already started to be
come an active campus group.
Last night the GCC sponsored a
panel discussion at the Tresidder
Memorial Union on issues raised
by the FSM.
Waldner said lhat the 11-man
executive committee ot the GCC
would meet Sunday at S p.m. in
a closed meeting 1o decide future
actions. A general meeting will
be held Wednesday.
