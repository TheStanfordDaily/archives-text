# Panel Backs Student Activism, Disagrees On FSM's Methods
## 
### JOE ROSEN BLOOM 
Four speakers expressed varied
ideas about the Berkeley Free
Speech Movement here last night,
but they did agree university stu
dents should have "free speech"
on campus.
The ideas came at a forum
meeting in Tresidder last night,

: sponsored by the Stanford Gradu
ate Coordinating Committee.
THE SPEAKERS, including
Myra Jehlen of the FSM Execu
tive Committee, Professor Adrian
Kragen of the Berkeley Law
School and a former vice-chancel
: lor of the university, Professor
I John Searle of the Cal philosophy
i department and William Stanton,
| a San Jose State Assemblyman
| all agreed the university had a re
strictive policy on free speech
that was in need of reform, al
though Professor Kragen said
the "regulations were more re
i strictive in words than in reality."
i
"There is no conflict between
i the Administration and the stu
dents on overall issues," the
j former vice chancellor said.
Kragen, however, attacked the
i tactics of the FSM which, he
| charged, resorted to "mob action"
i ignoring the "orderly processes"
! which were available. "From the
j inception, for the leaders of the
FSM, I lie normal processes were
I to be defied," he stated.

MISS JEIILKN disagreed with
; this allegation maintaining that
! the FSM exhausted all possibili
ties before turning to civil dis
obedience 10 gain its ends. Searle
(agreed that the "students pointed
! out to the Administration that
the regulations were restrictive.
He added, "The issue of civil
disobedience was not the main
issue on campus but whether the
citizenry on campus should have
i tho same constitutional rights as
i those off the campus."
Unlike Professor Kragen. Miss
Johlen did not think the Admin
istration or at least University of
i California President Clark Kerr
-and the students saw eye to eye
, on the "underlying issues."
1 SHE SAII) Kerr had a concep
tion of the university as a "truck
'garden" designed to function as
ia "service center for the rest of
| society."
Blaming the Regents for much
of the Berkeley trouble, Stanton
I said the controversy has been a
I "learning experience" thai has
I improved the situation at the
' university.
