# Menlo Park May Delay End Of Stanford Village
## University Wants Extension To â€™68 
### JIM HORNE Managing Editor 
The City of Menlo Park will
soon begin consideration of a
request by University Business
Manager Dwight Adams to de
lay the closing of Stanford Vil
lage until September, 1968.
Under the amended provisions
of World War Two housing legis
lation (The Lanham Act), the
University is supposed to vacate
the 80 acre site by June 30. But
there are not enough facilities on
campus or in Eseondido Village
to house the 293 married students
and about 1.50 single men who
make their home in Stanford Vil-
I lage.
"IF STANFORD were required
to vacate all the buildings," ex
plained Adams, ''approximately
450 students would be unable to
reside in University owned and
; operated living units.
"Many of these students," said
Adams, "have resided at the Vil
lage for a number of years, some
j for virtually their entire academic
careers. The absence of Univer
sity housing would Impose a
severe financial hardship on most
of these students because of the
: relatively high level of apart
j ment rentals within the mid-Pen
: insula area and the high cost of
! obtaining an education."
A one-bedroom Village apart
j ment rents for $52 a month.
ADAMS DAS proposed a grad
ual "phasing-out" of the Village
apartments and dormitories. His
! plans call for vacating eight build
| ings by next September, including
; 70 apartments, 100 single student
j rooms and the Village Nursery
; School.
Before September 1, 1907, the
j University would move out of 140
j more units, with half this number
i to be vacated before September
| i, 1960.
i AN remaining buildings would
Ibe abandoned by September 1,
j 1968.
ACCORDING TO Menlo Park
| City Manager Mike Bedwell,
i Adams' plan will be formally sub
mitted in the form of a letter at
a regular council meeting next
Tuesday night.
"It is likely," said Bedwell,
"that a council study group will
be formed to consider the pro
posal." Adams is now in Europe
j and has asked that any such con-
siderations be postponed until his
j return in February.
STANFORD VILLAGE was ac
quired in August, 1946, lo meet
the University's critical need for
post-war housing.
Situated three miles from
Quad, the Village was to be occu
pied by Stanford "for two years
after the end of the war emer
gency." The agreement, however,
provided for an extension of the
period of occupation "if the need
for emergency housing still
exists."
The original agreement was ex
tended and reextended until Sep
tember, 1957, when the Menlo
Park City Council adopted a reso
lution requiring that "all struc
tures be remodelled or otherwise
altered to conform to local code
requirements on or before June
30, 1965."
Adams has told the council that
the buildings will be completely
maintained and all possible health
hazards corrected during the addi
tional three and one-half years
of occupancy.
According to Adams, Escondido
Village will ultimately provide
approximately 1,250 living units
for married students, single
graduate students, and foreign
visiting scholars. Along with pro
posed campus residences for
sfngle men, this will accommo
date the 450 Stanford Village stu
dents.

STANFORD VILLAGE was ac
quired in August, 1946, lo meet
the University's critical need for
post-war housing.
Situated three miles from
Quad, the Village was to be occu
pied by Stanford "for two years
after the end of the war emer
gency." The agreement, however,
provided for an extension of the
period of occupation "if the need
for emergency housing still
exists."
The original agreement was ex
tended and reextended until Sep
tember, 1957, when the Menlo
Park City Council adopted a reso
lution requiring that "all struc
tures be remodelled or otherwise
altered to conform to local code
requirements on or before June
30, 1965."
Adams has told the council that
the buildings will be completely
maintained and all possible health
hazards corrected during the addi
tional three and one-half years
of occupancy.
According to Adams, Escondido
Village will ultimately provide
approximately 1,250 living units
for married students, single
graduate students, and foreign
visiting scholars. Along with pro
posed campus residences for
sfngle men, this will accommo
date the 450 Stanford Village stu
dents.

"IF STANFORD were required

Adams, "have resided at the Vil
