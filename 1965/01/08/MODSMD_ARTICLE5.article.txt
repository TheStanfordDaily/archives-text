# Menlo Park May Delay End Of Stanford Village
## University Wants Extension To ’68 
### JIM HORNE Managing Editor 
The City of Menlo Park will
soon begin consideration of a
request by University Business
Manager Dwight Adams to de
lay the closing of Stanford Vil
lage until September, 1968.
Under the amended provisions
of World War Two housing legis
lation (The Lanham Act), the
University is supposed to vacate
the 80 acre site by June 30. But
there are not enough facilities on
campus or in Eseondido Village
to house the 293 married students
and about 1.50 single men who
make their home in Stanford Vil-
I lage.
"IF STANFORD were required
to vacate all the buildings," ex
plained Adams, ''approximately
450 students would be unable to
reside in University owned and
; operated living units.
"Many of these students," said
Adams, "have resided at the Vil
lage for a number of years, some
j for virtually their entire academic
careers. The absence of Univer
sity housing would Impose a
severe financial hardship on most
of these students because of the
: relatively high level of apart
j ment rentals within the mid-Pen
: insula area and the high cost of
! obtaining an education."
A one-bedroom Village apart
j ment rents for $52 a month.
ADAMS DAS proposed a grad
ual "phasing-out" of the Village
apartments and dormitories. His
! plans call for vacating eight build
| ings by next September, including
; 70 apartments, 100 single student
j rooms and the Village Nursery
; School.
Before September 1, 1907, the
j University would move out of 140
j more units, with half this number
i to be vacated before September
| i, 1960.
i AN remaining buildings would
Ibe abandoned by September 1,
j 1968.
ACCORDING TO Menlo Park
| City Manager Mike Bedwell,
i Adams' plan will be formally sub
mitted in the form of a letter at
a regular council meeting next
Tuesday night.
"It is likely," said Bedwell,
"that a council study group will
be formed to consider the pro
posal." Adams is now in Europe
j and has asked that any such con-
