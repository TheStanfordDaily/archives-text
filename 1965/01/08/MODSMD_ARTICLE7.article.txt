### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
Dissatisfaction with the re
cent record of the San Jose
State football team has re
sulted this week in a student
administration battle over
Spartan football coach Boh
Titchenal's job at the state
college.
Wednesday the student
council of the Associated Stu
dent Body recommended 10-
4 that San Jose President
Robert I). Clark fire Titcb
enal, who lias compiled a 33-
lij-l record at the school.
The students gave as rea
sons reported lack of dis
cipline among team mem
bers and the school's poor
record which resulted in de
clining gate receipts and
alumni interest.
President Clark responded
yesterday by announcing that
he would stand by an earlier
decision to retain Titcbenal
for at least one more year,
when the President promised
to "review the matter again."
Titcbenal told The Spartan
Daily yesterday that lie
would resign only if re
quested by the President, and
would not respond to pres
sure from other groups.
The Spartan Daily re
ported Wednesday that the

student council might con
sider re-allocating' its entire
$30,000 anticipated football
budget if Titehenal is re
tained. Last year t li<* ASB
budgeted $27,000 in support
of the football program, but
student leaders indicated no
desire to support a losing
program.
Student body President Bob
Pisano an d vice-president
John Hendricks have me t
with Clark several times in
the past two weeks in at
tempts to persuade Clark to
fire the coach before the end
of the semester so that a
new coach might be broken
in. They indicated that they
believe the student body as
a whole does not support the
coach.
Titcbenal was hanged in
effigy Tuesday.
Other criticisms of the
coaching staff include poor
recruiting of football players
and lack of concern with
public relations.
Clark, in a statement Tues
day, said that he had found
"some basis for criticism,"
which "ought not to be mini
mized or condoned." llf ex
pects the coaching' staff to
"take steps to improve the
program at points where criti
cism has developed."
