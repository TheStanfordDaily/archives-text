• I iets Meet U.S. Demands
SAIGON, Viet Nam — South Viet Nam's
young military chiefs met another U.S. de
mand yesterday by releasing a score of politi
cal leaders arrested in the Dec. 20 military
purge of the civilian government.
Five prisoners were members of the High
National Council that was dissolved in the
purge. The United States had demanded that
the council be restored as one of the condi
tions for a resumption of normal relations
with the government.
But the military leaders, while saying they
are now cooperating with Premier Tran Van
Huong and chief of state Phan Khac Suu,
gave no indication they will restore the council.
• Malaysia Hunts Raiders
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Security
forces searched the swamps and jungles of

the southern Malaysian mainland yesterday

raiders.
On Malaysian Borneo a British-aided mili

nants of a party of 24 which landed Friday.
Thirteen of them, including a major in charge,
were promptly captured.

• Longshoremen IS ear Strike
NEW YORK — Events on the New York
waterfront yesterday moved steadily toward
a midnight dock strike—created, in the gov
ernment's opinion, by "confusion and mis
understanding."
The government, shippers and union offi
cials themselves appeared powerless to pre
vent a walkout here and in other ports from

Texas to Maine by more than 60,000 long
shoremen.
Assistant Labor Secretary James J. Rey
nolds blamed the stalemate on union mem
bership's failure to understand the terms of
a contract they rejected. He viewed a strike
as foredoomed to failure.
Past history of contract negotiations in
volving longshoremen, the potentially disas
trous impact of a dock strike on the national
economy, and the nature of the stalemate
seemed to promise consideration in Congress.
The dock workers' last previous contract dis
pute almost wound up there.

power in the case. The government accused
19 of the men of conspiring to violate the trio's
civil rights. The other two were accused of
accessory after the fact.

• Longshoremen IS ear Strike
NEW YORK — Events on the New York

a midnight dock strike—created, in the gov

understanding."
The government, shippers and union offi
cials themselves appeared powerless to pre
vent a walkout here and in other ports from

Texas to Maine by more than 60,000 long
shoremen.
Assistant Labor Secretary James J. Rey
nolds blamed the stalemate on union mem
bership's failure to understand the terms of
a contract they rejected. He viewed a strike
as foredoomed to failure.
Past history of contract negotiations in
volving longshoremen, the potentially disas
trous impact of a dock strike on the national

seemed to promise consideration in Congress.
The dock workers' last previous contract dis
