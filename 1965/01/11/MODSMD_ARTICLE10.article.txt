# Sigma Chi May Leave National
## Alumni Reveal Members' Plan To Bar Racial Discrimination 
### JON ROISE International Editor 
1 liree prominent iormer members of the Stanford chapter ol
Sigma Chi have circulated a letter informing 600 fellow alnmni
that the fraternity many end its affiliation with its national organi
zation, it was learned Saturday. The local chapter wishes to fret
itself from the national's alleged bias against Negroes, the alnmni
said. ♦

The possibility of disaffiliation
was revealed in a letter signed
by Lawrence E. Ho.vt, a Southern
Pacific executive; San Francisco
Supervisor John A. Ertola; a n d
Edwin A. Wells, a San Francisco
financial consultant.
ACCORDING TO the letter,
members of the Stanford chapter
consider themselves to be at a
disadvantage in rushing new
members because the national
fraternity will not only "not
pledge qualified Negroes, but
many Caucasian students will no
longer consider a fraternity that
is known to be restrictive."
Frank Olrich, president of the
local chapter, told The Daily Sat
urday that the fraternity had been
( working for about two years in
I an effort to find "the best possible
solution to the problem."
"There is no 'white clause' per
se in our Sigma Chi constitution,"
j he explained. The problem, he
said, is that the national frater
nity "retained the power to veto
members of individual chapters
after eliminating a previous dis
criminatory clause from its con
stitution."
"THERE IS strong evidence
that bias exists in practice," he

continued. He said the veto power
"seems to he aimed at preventing
Negro membership."
"Quiting the national is .just
one of the alternatives, but we
hope to stay within them if pos
sible. We would like to stay with
in the national and get a waiver
granting local autonomy. This
would be ideal."
Olrich added that to his knowl
edge, the national had never
granted such a waiver before.
"I'M SURE the whole house
ideally would back the idea of a
Negro member," he continued,
"but we are split about the pos
sibility of going local."
The house, he said, had never
had any Negro members, although
he knew of no instances of dis
crimination.
According to Olrich, the local
chapter had been meeting for
several months with the three
alumni who wrote the letter. The
letter, he added, "was not seen
or approved by us, all hough it
would have been if we'd seen it."
ALUMNUS WELLS explained
the purpose of the letter to The
Daily. "All we were trying to do
as alumni was to bring our fel
low alumni up to date on what
the chapter is doing," he said. He
stated that the alumni are act
ing only in an advisory capacity,
as they "have no right, to inter
fere in the actions of the house."
"The real news is that the house
is working within the framework
of the national organization to
bring about a long-range change
in its structure," he added.
Ertola told The Daily that the
alumni began meeting with the

Stanford chapter at the request
of the local fraternity.
THE ALUMNI, h e saic l- will
take part in no decisions. "It is
my feeling that more good can
be done within this organization
by the members themselves de
ciding" on a solution, he said.
In 19.17 the Stanford Board of
Trustees went on record as being
opposed to living-group discrimi
nation in any form, and declared
j itself willing to "work actively"
i with any student group seeking
j to eliminate racial and religious
clauses and practices.
j In 1962 the Stanford chapter of
Sigma Nu became the Beta Chi
j fraternity when its members
voted unanimously to go local.
The decision was made after fu
tile efforts to influence the na
tional organization to alter
clauses in its constitution and by
laws prohibiting Negro and Orien
tal membership.
IN MARCH, 1960, the Stanford
chapter of Alpha Tau Omega had
its national charter revoked when
the fraternity pledged four Jewish
students. At that time President

Wallace Sterling stated lhat the
University would "give Ihe chap
ter every possible encouragement '
in its plans to remain active as a
local."

said, is that the national frater

criminatory clause from its con
