# Sigma Chi May Leave National
## Alumni Reveal Members' Plan To Bar Racial Discrimination 
### JON ROISE International Editor 
1 liree prominent iormer members of the Stanford chapter ol
Sigma Chi have circulated a letter informing 600 fellow alnmni
that the fraternity many end its affiliation with its national organi
zation, it was learned Saturday. The local chapter wishes to fret
itself from the national's alleged bias against Negroes, the alnmni
said. ♦

The possibility of disaffiliation
was revealed in a letter signed
by Lawrence E. Ho.vt, a Southern
Pacific executive; San Francisco
Supervisor John A. Ertola; a n d
Edwin A. Wells, a San Francisco
financial consultant.
ACCORDING TO the letter,
members of the Stanford chapter
consider themselves to be at a
disadvantage in rushing new
members because the national
fraternity will not only "not
pledge qualified Negroes, but
many Caucasian students will no
longer consider a fraternity that
is known to be restrictive."
Frank Olrich, president of the
local chapter, told The Daily Sat
urday that the fraternity had been
( working for about two years in
I an effort to find "the best possible
solution to the problem."
"There is no 'white clause' per
se in our Sigma Chi constitution,"
j he explained. The problem, he
said, is that the national frater
nity "retained the power to veto
members of individual chapters
after eliminating a previous dis
criminatory clause from its con
stitution."
"THERE IS strong evidence
that bias exists in practice," he

continued. He said the veto power
"seems to he aimed at preventing
Negro membership."
"Quiting the national is .just
one of the alternatives, but we
hope to stay within them if pos
sible. We would like to stay with
in the national and get a waiver
granting local autonomy. This
would be ideal."
Olrich added that to his knowl
edge, the national had never
granted such a waiver before.
