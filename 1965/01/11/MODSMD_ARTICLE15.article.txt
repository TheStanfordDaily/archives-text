## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's potent freshman
swimming team dominated last
Saturday's meet between Arden
Hills Swim Club, the frosh, and
the Stanford varsity. The Pa
pooses dunked Arden Hills 55-39
while the varsity fell to the same
team 35-59.
Bob Momsen of the frosh
churned to a new pool and fresh

man record of 2:20.7 for the 200
breaststroke. Momsen teamed up
with John Hosier, Bill Monoogian,
and Mark Parmely to break a 1958
freshman 400 medley relay stan
dard.
The meet was conducted in a
unique fashion. Two competitors
from each of the throe teams
swam in each event. The results
were tallied to give dual meel
scores between Arden Hills and
the Stanford frosh and Arden
Hills and the varsity.
THE FROSH led from the out
set on the strength of the record
setting medley relay. In the sec
ond event, the 200 freestyle, Mike
Green stroked to a second place
finish, followed by Mike Doscher
of the varsity.
Bill Derrig of the varsity took
a tight second in the 50 freestyle.
Close on his heels were Bill
Meyer and Craig Brown of the Pa
pooses. Ilkka Suvanto of the var
sity led a 1-2-3 sweep of the 200
individual medley. F reshme n
Gary Sheerer and Jim Props fol
lowed Suvanto to the finish.
Stanford had no competition in
the diving, Vandervelde winning
decisively for the varsity. Ji m
Laney posted a second place in
the 200 butterfly.
MIKE DOSCHER came on
strong to finish the 100 freestyle
ahead of Mike Wall and Craig
Brown of the frosh. John Kesler
of the frosh and the varsity's Bill
Shanley scooped up second and
third places in the 200 backstroke.
Both Stanford teams underwent
heavy workouts in the days lead
ing up to the Arden Hills meet.
Although times may have suf
fered against Arden Hills, the con
ditioning should prove valuable
in the Stanford Relays to be held
here next Saturday.
