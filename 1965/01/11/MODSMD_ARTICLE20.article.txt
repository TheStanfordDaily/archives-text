# Stanford Student Given Greater Responsibility

### BILL BERKOWITZ 
|;DI IOK'S NOTK: This is the first article
of a live-part series on the role of the student
at Stanford, particularly in relation to cam
pus political activity and the rules which limit
it. .Mr. Kcrkowitz is a graduate student in
psychology.

Several years ago, there was a strike at the
University of San Marcos in Peru. The issue was
one of "co-gobierno," or the equality of students
and faculty, and in this case alumni, in determin
ing ;dl university policy. When this arrangemenl
was jeopardized with respect to a proposed medi
cal school, the students protested, and then struck.
The faculty joined them. Led by the 73-year-old
mother of a prominent local bullfighter, students
and professors together embarked on a 17-hour
march to Lima. There were mass protest meet
ings of 75,000. The Ministers of Justice and Edu
cation resigned. Public school teachers declared
holidays in support of the strikers. Signs scrawled
on walls read "one-third representation or death."
The strike lasted two months, and in Ihe short
run the students lost; in the long run, they eventu
ally won.
Traditional Student Influence
Historically, student influence on and control
over policy dates from the Middle Ages. And the
above example is an exaggerated, though not an
isolated, inslanee of the current power of students
in countries outside our own. It is entrenched
throughout Latin America. Elsewhere, in 1960
alone, student rioting helped overthrow the gov
ernment of Rhee in South Korea and Mendcres in
Turkey, and forced the cancellation of President
Eisenhower's intended visit to Japan.
American universities developed differently,
into a system in which ultimate authority is vested
in boards of trustees or regents, accountable to
society, and often to state legislatures, but to no
intra-university forces. The student's voice, if he
has any, is considered a privilege, and is highly
circumscribed. The same is frequently true of the
student's rights.
The free speech controversy at. Berkeley well
illustrates some of the defects in a trusteeship
system. More than that, it raises again the ques
tions of what should be the rights of students in
today's university, and what should constitute the
proper roles of students, faculty, and administra
tion. I became interested in how these questions
were being answered on the Stanford campus,
and these articles are a result of my inquiry.
Now Free Is Stanford?
How free is the expression of student opinion
at Stanford? And what is student influence in
shaping university decisions? Before dealing with
the specific answers, a brief review of the power
structure of the university, and the direction in
which it is moving, seems appropriate.
Leland and Jane Stanford's Founding Grant
of 1.585 expressly gives a board of trustees the
power and duty "to manage and control the insti
tution hereby founded." The trustees are respon
sible for appointing the university president, who
is not a trustee, and they mtiy remove him at
their discretion.
The Founding Grant has legal as well as moral
force; so that, for example, the Board's wish to
increase its own number by eight in 19.1-1 had to
await favorable court action before it could take

effect. While the trustees must report finances and
proceedings to the (Governor, only under the most
extraordinary circumstances would the state in
terfere wilh trustee action. And to legally change
iho text of the grant itself would bo at best ex
ceedingly difficult.
By the Grant, and traditionally, the office of
President is also strong. He is "to control the
educational part of the University to such an ex
tent that he may justly be held responsible for
the course of study therein and for the good con
duct and capacity of the professors and teachers."
He also approves professors, a power originally
reserved for the trustees themselves.
The Stanford Syslem
All lower authority is delegated and/or advi
sory, and most resides in deans and committees.
The most important of the latter are: (1) the
Presidential Advisors Committees, which include
the Committees on Student Affairs and Services
and Public Exercises*. They are composed mostly
of faculty, with some administrators, and some
times students. <2) The Academic Council, to
which belong all faculty of assistant professor
rank or higher. The Academic Council has an Ad
visory Board, which recommends faculty appoint
ments to the President, and an Executive Com
mittee, which may take positions on matters of
university policy. The Executive Committee also
appoints six sub-commit tees, with membership
restricted to faculty (by Its own choosing), to
advise on issues such as libraries, admissions, and
grading, and it serves together with high admin
istration officials on (3) the Committee on Univer
sity Policy, which may review the actions of the
advisory committees and the Academic Council.
The most important decisions affecting the univer
sity pass through here. Any serious differences
between the President and any of these commit
tees is reported to the trustees, although serious
differences are rare.
Finally, there is the Associated Students.
ASSU authority, says the introduction to its con
stitution, derives from the Board of Trustees.
While student self-government at Stanford dates
from its beginning, the administration has always
retained an implicit veto power over its actions.
'I'lic Growth Of Student Freedom
For the past several years, the dispensers of
power have been more inclined to listen to stu
dent (and faculty) opinion, and in sufficient num
bers of cases to mark a trend, to delegate more
freedom and more responsibility to them. Among
other places, this can be seen in the first appoint
ment of students to the advisory committees two
years ago, in the initial appearance of the stu
dent body president before the trustees last spring,
in the creation of an undergraduate-based Commit
tee of Thirteen by Dean of Men Robert Gordon
this f;ill to study general matters of student con
cern, and in the ongoing studies of judicial and
social regulations on campus, both of which are
expected to result in liberalization.
Some liberalization is apparent in political
regulations, too; and because the guidelines here
are more settled, because they are analogous to
the regulations at Berkeley, because the intensity
of national student activism is now high, and. most
important, because they exemplify the student
administration relationship, it is the political sit
nation at Stanford which I propose to examine
at length, and then to return to the question of
student control.
