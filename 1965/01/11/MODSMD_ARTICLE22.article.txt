## GCC Doesn't Represent 'Interests Of Graduates' 
### 
Dear Sir:
This is the first time I have
contributed anything to your
pages; I trust it will also he the
last. I was happy to read in your
Friday issue that our Graduate
Coordinating Committee, busily
playing the moon to FSM's sun,
has noted with suspicious ap
proval that "as yet we can see
no flagrant violation" of student
rights at Stanford. Nevertheless,
perhaps saddened by the lack
even of straw men to bowl over,
this group has determined, with
benevolent selflessness, to "rep
resent the opinions and interests
of graduate students before th e
University as a whole," and so
on, and so on.
That, so to speak, was the last
straw. I wish only to state that
for myself (and I believe for nu
merous other graduate students
who indicate their opinion of this
group's importance by their si

lence I, (ICC does not represent
what I conceive to be my inter
ests, and not by the wildest feat
of mental gymnastics can 1 im
agine it representing my opinions
Statements that the predelictiom
of such a self-constituted coterk
give form to the opinions and in
terests of a group of highly dis
erect individuals are compounder
in equal parts of presumption ant
ridiculousness.
1 have read somewhere thai
there is a cycle to activities ol
this sort, like sunspots, or more
appropriately, the seven-year itch
Perhaps this is so, bul I feel it
time that some graduate assistant
states I luil he feels meditation
on proposals for his unionization
rank in usefulness and desirabif
ity with the vermiform appendix
and that he is repelled by campus
groups again and again taking up
the cudgels for assorted "causes'
(in this case largely self-invented
ones i. with all 1 lie unedifying
repetitiousness of a flog return
ing to its vomit.
