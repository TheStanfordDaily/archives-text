# How We Ate Wilbur Food And Lived

### 

RUMORS HAVF IT thot these figures,
standing between the art museum and
the library, are the remains of three fresh
men after a French toast attack at Wilbur
Hall. Whether ihey ever really "lived"—


if they were freshman men, the chances
are against it—is open to conjecture.
Other rumors, probably closer to the truth,
say that these skeletal formations are the
products of a few frustrated Stanford art


students whose works, refused admission
to the museum due to their obviously
strong criticism of something or other,
were abandoned to be withered away
by the elements.
