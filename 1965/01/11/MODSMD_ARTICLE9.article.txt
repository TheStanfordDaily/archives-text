# FIVE IN A ROW
## Cards Post Double Win 
### PETE KING 
Alternately playing some of
their worst and best basketball,

Washington State, 70-43, and
Washington, 80-68, in the Pavilion
last weekend to run their win
ning streak to five games.
Stanford now shares the Pa
cific Athletic Conference lead
with UCLA, with a 2-0 record.
However, next Saturday the In
dians must battle the number
one-ranked Bruins in Los Angeles,

teams.
808 Bi;i)lXL and Ray Ko
sanke were the Tribe heroes in
bo th weekend games. Bedell
scored 16 points and grabbed 20
rebounds, while Kosanke had 28
points in a fine all-around effort.
Stanford had 11 days of rest
before facing Washington State,
and the lay-off showed badly.
The Indians were able to hold
only a slight lead through the
first half due to repeated ball
control errors and defensive
lapses. Fortunately, the inept,
o Men uncoordinated Cougars
made as many mistakes.
In the second half Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar told I h e
team to settle down, and got sur
prising results. Two jump shots
by guard Kent Hinckley and two
more buckets by the 6-9 Kosanke
boosted the Cards Into a 1228
lead. In the third quarter. Stan
ford's strongest period so far this
season, the Indians outscored
WSU. 20-5.
