# FIVE IN A ROW
## Cards Post Double Win 
### PETE KING 
Alternately playing some of
their worst and best basketball,
Stanford's cagers decisively beat
Washington State, 70-43, and
Washington, 80-68, in the Pavilion
last weekend to run their win
ning streak to five games.
Stanford now shares the Pa
cific Athletic Conference lead
with UCLA, with a 2-0 record.
However, next Saturday the In
dians must battle the number
one-ranked Bruins in Los Angeles,
traditional slaughterhouse for
high-flying Stanford basketball
teams.
808 Bi;i)lXL and Ray Ko
sanke were the Tribe heroes in
bo th weekend games. Bedell
scored 16 points and grabbed 20
rebounds, while Kosanke had 28
points in a fine all-around effort.
Stanford had 11 days of rest
before facing Washington State,
and the lay-off showed badly.
The Indians were able to hold
only a slight lead through the
first half due to repeated ball
control errors and defensive
lapses. Fortunately, the inept,
o Men uncoordinated Cougars
made as many mistakes.
In the second half Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar told I h e
team to settle down, and got sur
prising results. Two jump shots
by guard Kent Hinckley and two
more buckets by the 6-9 Kosanke
boosted the Cards Into a 1228
lead. In the third quarter. Stan
ford's strongest period so far this
season, the Indians outscored
WSU. 20-5.

to a more free throw in the second
half.
After polishing off WSU, the
Indians faced iheir only real
weekend competition, Washing
ton. The Huskies had shocked Cal
the previous night, but the In
dians made short work of Husky
illusions by zipping to a 16-7 lead
on three jumpers by Hinckley

and tip-ins by Kosanke. The Cards
padded their lead to 34-16, then
nearly pulled their biggest el
foldo of the year, as Washington
closed the gap to 35-30.
Luck was-with Stanford how
ever, as halftime stifled the
Husky comeback. The afternoon
sun lit up the Pavilion just
enough for the TV cameras to
record 1 the ensuing rout.
BEDELL put in seven straight
points in the opening two min
utes of the second half. There-
I after the junior forward hi) from
| everywhere long jump shots,
tip-ins, drives along the baseline,
free throws, and follow shots.
His 21-point second half outburst
j gave him 30 for the game, high
est output by a Stanford forward
in several years.
Equally outstanding was Ko
; sanke, who played one of his best

defensive games ever. Washing
ton's bread and butter play is tho
quick drive toward in
a lay-up, usually executed by
guard Sieve Olson, uu.,; i
spread his lanky frame across
the key, effectively clogging any
traffic in that area, anri cutting
off the high-scoring Olsen with
just nine points. In addition, he
exhibited new-found aggressive
ness as he blocked shots, stole
passes, and pus he d Huskies
around underneath the basket as
he hauled down 13 rebounds and
stuffed in 15 points.
With Bedell, Kosanke, and Clay
ton Raaka sweeping the boards
like vacuum cleaners, Stanford
outrebounded the Huskies, 66-34.
While the Tribe frequently had
three or four tries at the basket,
the Huskies, allowed only one
shot, had to play more deliber

ately, and their scrambling attack
couldn't make the adjustment.
WASHINGTON'S only flash of
brillance was forward Lynn
Nance, who sank 10 of 16 shots
for 22 points, nearly single-hand
edly keeping the Huskies from
total oblivion during Bedell's
streak.
The Cards had three men in
double figures against WSU and
four against Washington. Th e
team shot 40 per cent from the
floor, led by Kosanke's 58 per cent.
Against the Huskies, Stanford
took an amazing 81 shots.
In a Friday preliminary game,
the Stanford freshmen crushed
the JV's, 72-47.

Alternately playing some of
their worst and best basketball,
Stanford's cagers decisively beat
Washington State, 70-43, and
Washington, 80-68, in the Pavilion
last weekend to run their win
ning streak to five games.
Stanford now shares the Pa
cific Athletic Conference lead
with UCLA, with a 2-0 record.
However, next Saturday the In
dians must battle the number
one-ranked Bruins in Los Angeles,
traditional slaughterhouse for
high-flying Stanford basketball
teams.
808 Bi;i)lXL and Ray Ko
sanke were the Tribe heroes in
bo th weekend games. Bedell
scored 16 points and grabbed 20
rebounds, while Kosanke had 28
points in a fine all-around effort.
Stanford had 11 days of rest
before facing Washington State,
and the lay-off showed badly.
The Indians were able to hold
only a slight lead through the
first half due to repeated ball
control errors and defensive
lapses. Fortunately, the inept,
o Men uncoordinated Cougars
made as many mistakes.
In the second half Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar told I h e
team to settle down, and got sur
prising results. Two jump shots
by guard Kent Hinckley and two
more buckets by the 6-9 Kosanke
boosted the Cards Into a 1228
lead. In the third quarter. Stan

After polishing off WSU, the

the previous night, but the In

illusions by zipping to a 16-7 lead
on three jumpers by Hinckley

and tip-ins by Kosanke. The Cards
padded their lead to 34-16, then
nearly pulled their biggest el
foldo of the year, as Washington
closed the gap to 35-30.
Luck was-with Stanford how
ever, as halftime stifled the
Husky comeback. The afternoon

BEDELL put in seven straight
points in the opening two min

Equally outstanding was Ko

defensive games ever. Washing

quick drive toward in
a lay-up, usually executed by
guard Sieve Olson, uu.,; i
spread his lanky frame across
the key, effectively clogging any

just nine points. In addition, he
exhibited new-found aggressive
ness as he blocked shots, stole
passes, and pus he d Huskies
around underneath the basket as
he hauled down 13 rebounds and
stuffed in 15 points.
With Bedell, Kosanke, and Clay
ton Raaka sweeping the boards
like vacuum cleaners, Stanford
outrebounded the Huskies, 66-34.
While the Tribe frequently had
three or four tries at the basket,
the Huskies, allowed only one
shot, had to play more deliber

ately, and their scrambling attack
couldn't make the adjustment.
WASHINGTON'S only flash of
brillance was forward Lynn
Nance, who sank 10 of 16 shots
for 22 points, nearly single-hand

The Cards had three men in

Equally outstanding was Ko

With Bedell, Kosanke, and Clay

outrebounded the Huskies, 66-34.
While the Tribe frequently had
