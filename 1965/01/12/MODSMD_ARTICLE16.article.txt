# CHIEF DAVIS WARNS:
## Bikes A Threat To Safety 
### SUE DALEY 
The scene: A quiet shady cor
ner of the colonnades on Inner
Quad. Warren G. Wonka, typical
carefree Stanford student, exils
dreamily from his last class of
the quarter.
The action: Suddenly, before
you can say "Captain Midnight,"
a shapeless whirlwind with lian-'
dlebars zooms around the corner I
and levels the hapless Wonka to j
the dust, shrilly crying "Thus
ever to pedestrians!"
The frequency of such frightful j

disasters as the above will be sub
stantially reduced if the current
two-week bicycle safety program,
conducted by the Stanford Police
Department ,has the desired ef
fect.
"A serious condition now exits
on the campus," according to
Police Chief Gordon Davis. "Too
many cyclists ride just anywhere,"
I he said, "crashing stop signs, go
ing without headlights after dark,
i and failing to observe common
; traffic laws which apply to bi
i cycles as well as to cars."
j "For their own safety, not to

mention that of the pedestrians,
we wish to have the co-operation
of cyclists in this program and
give them a better understand
ing of their responsibilities," Da
vis said.
Complaints of hazards created
by bike riders fall into four main
categories, he said:
• Failure to stop at stop signs;
• Bike traffic on the wrong
side (left side) of the road;
• Bikes riding without head
lights and red rear reflectors
afier dark;
• Bikes riding in the archades.
To improve conditions for bi
cycles, more bike pathways along
thoroughfares and more bike
racks for parking will be pro
vided. Davis said.
"We want to keep this from
being a police matter; no rules
or penalties have been set up so
far," he said. "We don't want to
have to cite violators, but we will
after January' 15 when necessary.


A FUNNY THING happened to Warren G.
Wonka on his way to the Western Civ Libe the
other day. Warren wasn't hurt seriously by the
late-model Chevrolet that hit him broadside,

but he was warned by Captain Midnight that
if he rode standing on the seat of his bicycle
again, he would be cited by the Stanford Police
Department.

Quad. Warren G. Wonka, typical
carefree Stanford student, exils
dreamily from his last class of
the quarter.
The action: Suddenly, before
you can say "Captain Midnight,"
a shapeless whirlwind with lian-'
dlebars zooms around the corner I
and levels the hapless Wonka to j
the dust, shrilly crying "Thus
ever to pedestrians!"
The frequency of such frightful j

disasters as the above will be sub
stantially reduced if the current
two-week bicycle safety program,
conducted by the Stanford Police
Department ,has the desired ef
fect.
"A serious condition now exits
on the campus," according to
Police Chief Gordon Davis. "Too
many cyclists ride just anywhere,"
I he said, "crashing stop signs, go
ing without headlights after dark,
i and failing to observe common
; traffic laws which apply to bi
i cycles as well as to cars."
j "For their own safety, not to

mention that of the pedestrians,
we wish to have the co-operation
of cyclists in this program and
give them a better understand
ing of their responsibilities," Da
vis said.
Complaints of hazards created
by bike riders fall into four main
categories, he said:
• Failure to stop at stop signs;
• Bike traffic on the wrong
side (left side) of the road;
• Bikes riding without head
lights and red rear reflectors
afier dark;
• Bikes riding in the archades.
To improve conditions for bi
cycles, more bike pathways along
thoroughfares and more bike
racks for parking will be pro
vided. Davis said.
"We want to keep this from
being a police matter; no rules
or penalties have been set up so
far," he said. "We don't want to
have to cite violators, but we will
after January' 15 when necessary.


A FUNNY THING happened to Warren G.
Wonka on his way to the Western Civ Libe the
other day. Warren wasn't hurt seriously by the
late-model Chevrolet that hit him broadside,

but he was warned by Captain Midnight that
if he rode standing on the seat of his bicycle
again, he would be cited by the Stanford Police
Department.
