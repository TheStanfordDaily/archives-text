# Lack Of Space Delays Start Of Intramural Hoop Action
## 
### HERNANDEZ 
Due to the biggest turnout
ever for intramural basketball,
there are more games to be played
than there are available courts.
Under the present plan of eight
games four nights a week a n d
three games on Saturday, there
is only spare for 24S contests.
In order to complete a full
schedule, 45 more hours oi play

ing time are needed.
PRESENTLY, Joe Higgins, Di
rector of Intramural Athletics, is
considering a number of alterna
tives: play during the half time of
intercollegiate games, play early
Friday evening, play one more
game on Saturday. The latter two
possibilities combined would pro
vide four more games per week,
about two-thirds of what is

i needed.
An interesting facet of the Fri
day evening games is that they
would probably draw a sizable
pre-date crowd.
One other possibility is the
playing of the intramural con
tests in the afternoon. This could
, add as many as 50 contests a week
to the slate if both Encina gym
and the Pavilion were utilized
(during the afternoon and if En
cina gym were also used Satur
day afternoon.
The obvious fallacy is, of
course, the varsity, the Frosh
team and the J.V.'s. The varsity
uses the Pavilion 4-0 and the
J.V.'s use Encina at the same
time. But since the varsity and
Frosh have contests on Fridays
the Pavilion and Encina gym
would be free that afternoon.
IF HE IS UNABLE to secure
[the extra needed court lime Hig-
I gins is contemplating elimination
of some of the "B" teams. The
first to go would be those which
I were from a living group that al
' ready had an "A" league entry.
Another alternative under con
sideration is that of a double
elimination tournament for the
"B" teams. Then the top five or
six teams would enter the play
offs along with the number one
and two teams of the "A" league
as is currently done.
Higgins said he would finish
studying the possibilities and an
, nounce "B" league realignments
or one of the other alternatives
later this week.
; In the interim a one week
schedule for "A" teams and a
few "B" teams has been drawn
up. League play started last night
with eight games.
