## Ruggers Open Season 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Fifty years ago if a loyal Stan
ford fan went to Big Game ho
would see not a football game
but a rugby game. For nine years
in the early part of the century
Stanford battled California each
year in the European parent of
our modern football. By the time
the Big Clame returned to foot
ball, the Stanford rugby teams
had compiled a 5-3-1 record.
For many years after its Big
Game fame diminished Stanford
rugby squads had the lot of a
minor sport. However in recent
years there has been a revival of
interest chiefly because of the
fine caliber of Stanford teams.
Rugby has not had a losing sea
son in the last ton years. Led by
Coach Pete Kmetovic the ruggers
have a four year record of 51-4-1

against intercollegiate and ama
teur rugby club competition.
EACH YEAR Stanford plays
USC, UCLA, and Cal rugby teams
as well as outstanding rugby
teams up and down the coast.
The season is climaxed each
with the Monterey Rugby Tour
nament which draws rugby
squads from many parts of the
country. The Stanford ruggers
are the defending tournament
champions. Two games are
played against the California
Bears each year and to ihe win
ner of this series goes the "Rig
Game Scrum Axe." The two teams
split tho series last year but the
axe went to Cal on the basis of
total points scored. The second
game against Cal was the only
loss of the season.
From time to time Ihe novice
fan might see what looks like a
football huddle except that there
are both teams together. This is
not a huddle but a "scrum." The
players grasp arms and legs and
wait for ihe referee to throw the
ball in the middle as if this were
a hockey face-off. Only one player
in the "scrum," the hooker, can
kick at the ball. Once the ball is
out of the scrum area, any one
of the 1 ."5 players can kick, run
or pass the ball. All passes must
be laterals. A "knock-on" is a
forward fumble.
THE OPPOSING team must
tackle the man with the ball, with
out the help of football equip
ment, before he gets to the goal
line and scores a "try" worlh 3
points. The game is played in
two 30 minute, running time
halfs. No time outs are allowed.
Team prospects for this season
are good according to Coach Pete
Kmetovic. Many experienced

players are returning from last
year's fine team. The toughest
competition this year should come
in tho Big Game against Cal and
again in the Monterey tourney.
The games are played on Satur
days at 1:30 p.m. and there is usu
ally a JV game preceding the
I varsity contest.
The opening game of this sea-
I son will bo played this Saturday
i against tho Peninsula Ramblers.
This should be an exciting game
as the Ramblers are consistently
j one of Northern California's top
teams.

wait for ihe referee to throw the
ball in the middle as if this were
a hockey face-off. Only one player
in the "scrum," the hooker, can
kick at the ball. Once the ball is
out of the scrum area, any one
of the 1 ."5 players can kick, run
or pass the ball. All passes must
be laterals. A "knock-on" is a
forward fumble.
THE OPPOSING team must
tackle the man with the ball, with
out the help of football equip
ment, before he gets to the goal
line and scores a "try" worlh 3
points. The game is played in
two 30 minute, running time
halfs. No time outs are allowed.
Team prospects for this season
are good according to Coach Pete
Kmetovic. Many experienced

players are returning from last
year's fine team. The toughest
competition this year should come
in tho Big Game against Cal and
again in the Monterey tourney.
The games are played on Satur
days at 1:30 p.m. and there is usu
ally a JV game preceding the
I varsity contest.
The opening game of this sea-
I son will bo played this Saturday
i against tho Peninsula Ramblers.
This should be an exciting game
as the Ramblers are consistently
j one of Northern California's top
teams.
Fifty years ago if a loyal Stan
ford fan went to Big Game ho
would see not a football game
but a rugby game. For nine years
in the early part of the century
Stanford battled California each
year in the European parent of
our modern football. By the time
the Big Clame returned to foot
ball, the Stanford rugby teams
had compiled a 5-3-1 record.
For many years after its Big
Game fame diminished Stanford
rugby squads had the lot of a
minor sport. However in recent
years there has been a revival of
interest chiefly because of the
fine caliber of Stanford teams.
Rugby has not had a losing sea
son in the last ton years. Led by
Coach Pete Kmetovic the ruggers
have a four year record of 51-4-1

against intercollegiate and ama
teur rugby club competition.
EACH YEAR Stanford plays
USC, UCLA, and Cal rugby teams
as well as outstanding rugby
teams up and down the coast.
The season is climaxed each
with the Monterey Rugby Tour
nament which draws rugby
squads from many parts of the
country. The Stanford ruggers
are the defending tournament
champions. Two games are
played against the California
Bears each year and to ihe win
ner of this series goes the "Rig
Game Scrum Axe." The two teams
split tho series last year but the
axe went to Cal on the basis of
total points scored. The second
game against Cal was the only
loss of the season.
From time to time Ihe novice
fan might see what looks like a
football huddle except that there
are both teams together. This is
not a huddle but a "scrum." The
players grasp arms and legs and
wait for ihe referee to throw the
ball in the middle as if this were
a hockey face-off. Only one player
in the "scrum," the hooker, can
kick at the ball. Once the ball is
out of the scrum area, any one
of the 1 ."5 players can kick, run
or pass the ball. All passes must
be laterals. A "knock-on" is a
