# Frosh Hoopsters Vanquish Braves With 72-47 Rout
## 
### ROBERT THIERIOT 
The Stanford Frosh basketball
squad completely humiliated the
Stanford Braves Friday evening
behind the electrifying play of
Art Harris and the total ineptness
of both the Braves' offense and
defense. The game, played as a
prelude to the contest between
the Stanford Varsity and WSU,
was sloppy, but did present an
occasional exciting moment.
It was obvious from the begin
ning that the victor of the game
woidd be the team which made
the fewest mistakes. The J.V.'s
destroyed any chances they had
of winning by throwing the ball
in all directions.
When they threw it up at the
basket it was usually inadver
tently short or wide of the entire
rim. Often the Braves did not get
an opportunity to miss a shot.
STILL, THE FROSH also had
problems finding their shooting
eyes and were not able to take
advantage of the numerous times
that they found themselves with
the ball. The Frosh grabbed the
lead early and hung on for a 28-20
halftime lead.
The first half presented few
thrills and poor basketball. But
Frosh star Art Harris came out
in the second half and showed
the sparse crowd, his opponents,
and teammates how exciting and
good a basketball player he is.
HARRIS' FINE play seemed
to generate a feeling that maybe
everybody on the court ought to
be playing that way. The passing
improved. The shots began
in with more regularity. Lance
Luno and John Murray started
to hit for the J.V.'s, but the Frosh
caught fire too.
They employed a fast break
and a stingy defense which forced
the J.V.'s to take many shots
from the perimeter. With Harris
and Gary Petermeyer handling
the ball effectively and passing
to their open teammates, the
Frosh attack really clicked. The
Frosh played well enough in the
second half to run away with the
game, 72-17.
The Frosh of course dominated
the statistics. They shot at a 47
per cent clip while the Braves
were only successful on 31 per
cent. The freshmen managed to
lose tlie ball only 11 times. The
J.V.'s threw it away 14.
Art Harris finished with the
game high in points and rebounds
with 17 and 14, respectively. John
Murray was high point man for
the Braves with 14.

halftime lead.
The first half presented few
thrills and poor basketball. But
Frosh star Art Harris came out
in the second half and showed
the sparse crowd, his opponents,
and teammates how exciting and
good a basketball player he is.
HARRIS' FINE play seemed
to generate a feeling that maybe
everybody on the court ought to
be playing that way. The passing
improved. The shots began
in with more regularity. Lance
Luno and John Murray started
to hit for the J.V.'s, but the Frosh
caught fire too.
They employed a fast break
and a stingy defense which forced
the J.V.'s to take many shots
from the perimeter. With Harris
and Gary Petermeyer handling
the ball effectively and passing
to their open teammates, the
Frosh attack really clicked. The
Frosh played well enough in the
second half to run away with the
game, 72-17.
The Frosh of course dominated
the statistics. They shot at a 47
per cent clip while the Braves
were only successful on 31 per
cent. The freshmen managed to
lose tlie ball only 11 times. The
J.V.'s threw it away 14.
Art Harris finished with the
game high in points and rebounds
with 17 and 14, respectively. John
Murray was high point man for
the Braves with 14.
The Stanford Frosh basketball
squad completely humiliated the
Stanford Braves Friday evening
behind the electrifying play of
Art Harris and the total ineptness
of both the Braves' offense and
defense. The game, played as a
prelude to the contest between
the Stanford Varsity and WSU,
was sloppy, but did present an
occasional exciting moment.
It was obvious from the begin
ning that the victor of the game
woidd be the team which made
the fewest mistakes. The J.V.'s
destroyed any chances they had
of winning by throwing the ball
in all directions.
When they threw it up at the
basket it was usually inadver
tently short or wide of the entire
rim. Often the Braves did not get
an opportunity to miss a shot.
STILL, THE FROSH also had
problems finding their shooting
eyes and were not able to take
advantage of the numerous times
that they found themselves with
the ball. The Frosh grabbed the
lead early and hung on for a 28-20
halftime lead.
