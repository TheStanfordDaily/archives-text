# The 						Fearful Spectator
## Stanford's Frantic Expansion: Keep One Eye On Your Car Art Fisher 
### 
This column will take issue with some of the
more notable lights in the student community.
The aspect of student life most in need of discus
sion is not the conceivable changes in the social
regulations. At least as important is the recent
supernatural growth of the university and its im
plications and effects for the existence of the
undergraduate.
Since the summer of 1962 we have seen the
opening or announcement of new facilities for
physics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics,
married-student housing, a faculty club, biology,
business, student publications, two foreign cam
puses, a student union, a linear accelerator, an
undergraduate library, and many lesser projects.
In that time tuition has jumped up 25 per cent.
A splendidly organized team of alumni have won
mightily at the subtleties of solicitation. Stanford
now has the softest seats in the West, with more
of the same apparently on the way.
The student reaction has been mixed. Many
students are shaky and fearful. Some students are
osten t at iously import urbable.
The following takes little account of what the
facts of university planning actually are. Un
doubtedly the individuals in charge are competent
and cautious.
Equal in importance to the policies themselves
is the manner in which the students perceive these
changes. The student community has long cher
ished the hope that such perceptions would some
how weigh in future planning decisions. The ac
tion and the reaction contribute equally to the
eventual essence of the university.
Undergraduates are not ordinary consumers;
they do not buy their education by the quarter.
Generally an undergraduate has laboriously con
sidered and chosen his college. He can look up the
requirements; he can ascertain the reputation of
school and professors. But to a large extent when
he makes his choice he can only bet blindly on the
planners.
The new facilities have brought a tempered
ecstacy. Students are delighted with the improved
classroom and laboratory conditions. Howvver,
there is a general feeling that the primary bene
ficiaries are the graduate students and research
workers. There is little expectation that the wave
of renovation and construction will affect teach
ing.
A Lobby?
Sensitive students have been upset by the spa
cious lobby in the new Math Corner, the only aca
demic building with such a lobby. It is suspected
thai this is not intended for the use of flocks of
students waiting to see their palatially closeted
T.A.'s, but rather that it. is intended for purchas
ing agents with research contracts.
There is some sentiment that the new build
ings do not inspire, that they give little feeling of
proximity to the anguish and dedication of re
search. Like attending class in the local branch
of the telephone company.
The reaction to the new foreign campuses was
one of frank admission that; they would be fun

too. Stanford does not take the overseas program
partieularly seriously.
The tuition increase was met with wisdom.
Clearly, so tho students say, the effect will be
highly democratic in the best American tradition.
The higher tuition is raised above the basic costs
of the school, the greater the number of deserving
students who can be put on scholarships. Soon
with a tuition of $10,000 per year, the handful of
very rich kids will be supporting us all. Soon the
middle class will be squeezed out entirely. Only
those who can pay and those who can justify not
paying will survive. An intriguing myth.
Student Afraid
Most importantly, many members of the com
munity of more dedicated students are suddenly
worried, doubting and wondering what type of per
son Stanford plans to encourage. Who is wanted
here? What type of alumni does Stanford hope
to have? Ironically, much talk is heard about
the "residence university," and yet the highest
men's averages are often made by those off-cam
pus.
This inner community of more serious stu
dents regards the planned undergraduate library
as a tragedy, as an open concession by ihe ad
ministration to ihe effect that the present unfor
tunate segregation of living areas and academic
areas will be retained and intensified. The dorms
and fraternities have been abandoned 1o the rau
cous, to the artists of the phonograph. "The life
of the mind" has been granted a shelter outside
the living areas.
A well-known group of students, whom we may
call "the Participators," experienced considerable
if familiar anguish upon realizing that they had
not been consulted in the formulation of these
various plans.
The many arc only interested; the few are
profoundly concerned. Among this few there is
much talk of leaving.
The rumor runs wild that enrollment will soon
be expanded to 14,000 in several steps. Such an
increase might well gradually diminish the con
siderable loyalty now maintained by even the
sharpest of Stanford's critics.
Students are insecure, unprepared, unaware of
the impending changes. There is little peace in
the inner city of the university when one is con
stantly wary of where this administration-trig
gered revolution will next strike. Students are
afraid to leave their cars for fear the parking lot
will be excavated while they're at the Post Office.
A thorough disclosure of broad plans, published
in booklet form by the university and distributed
to those who are committed to a Stanford educa
tion, would be a welcome tranquilizer.
In short, what is the philosophy behind the
growth? Students want to know; having cast
their lot with Stanford, they deserve to know. A
reiteration of educational platitudes will not suf
fice. To what are we aspiring? That aspiration pro
foundly affects the life of every student 011 this
campus.

in booklet form by the university and distributed
to those who are committed to a Stanford educa
tion, would be a welcome tranquilizer.
In short, what is the philosophy behind the
growth? Students want to know; having cast
their lot with Stanford, they deserve to know. A
reiteration of educational platitudes will not suf
fice. To what are we aspiring? That aspiration pro
foundly affects the life of every student 011 this
campus.
This column will take issue with some of the
more notable lights in the student community.
The aspect of student life most in need of discus
sion is not the conceivable changes in the social
regulations. At least as important is the recent
supernatural growth of the university and its im
plications and effects for the existence of the
undergraduate.
Since the summer of 1962 we have seen the
opening or announcement of new facilities for
physics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics,
married-student housing, a faculty club, biology,
business, student publications, two foreign cam
puses, a student union, a linear accelerator, an
undergraduate library, and many lesser projects.
In that time tuition has jumped up 25 per cent.
A splendidly organized team of alumni have won
mightily at the subtleties of solicitation. Stanford
now has the softest seats in the West, with more
of the same apparently on the way.
The student reaction has been mixed. Many
students are shaky and fearful. Some students are
osten t at iously import urbable.
The following takes little account of what the
facts of university planning actually are. Un
doubtedly the individuals in charge are competent
and cautious.
Equal in importance to the policies themselves
is the manner in which the students perceive these
changes. The student community has long cher
ished the hope that such perceptions would some
how weigh in future planning decisions. The ac
tion and the reaction contribute equally to the
eventual essence of the university.
Undergraduates are not ordinary consumers;
they do not buy their education by the quarter.
Generally an undergraduate has laboriously con
sidered and chosen his college. He can look up the
requirements; he can ascertain the reputation of
school and professors. But to a large extent when
he makes his choice he can only bet blindly on the
planners.
The new facilities have brought a tempered
ecstacy. Students are delighted with the improved
classroom and laboratory conditions. Howvver,
there is a general feeling that the primary bene
ficiaries are the graduate students and research
workers. There is little expectation that the wave
of renovation and construction will affect teach
ing.
A Lobby?
Sensitive students have been upset by the spa
cious lobby in the new Math Corner, the only aca
demic building with such a lobby. It is suspected
thai this is not intended for the use of flocks of
students waiting to see their palatially closeted
T.A.'s, but rather that it. is intended for purchas
ing agents with research contracts.
There is some sentiment that the new build
ings do not inspire, that they give little feeling of
proximity to the anguish and dedication of re
search. Like attending class in the local branch
of the telephone company.
The reaction to the new foreign campuses was
one of frank admission that; they would be fun

too. Stanford does not take the overseas program
partieularly seriously.
The tuition increase was met with wisdom.
Clearly, so tho students say, the effect will be
highly democratic in the best American tradition.
The higher tuition is raised above the basic costs
of the school, the greater the number of deserving
students who can be put on scholarships. Soon
with a tuition of $10,000 per year, the handful of
very rich kids will be supporting us all. Soon the
middle class will be squeezed out entirely. Only
those who can pay and those who can justify not
paying will survive. An intriguing myth.
Student Afraid
Most importantly, many members of the com
munity of more dedicated students are suddenly
worried, doubting and wondering what type of per
son Stanford plans to encourage. Who is wanted
here? What type of alumni does Stanford hope
to have? Ironically, much talk is heard about
the "residence university," and yet the highest
men's averages are often made by those off-cam
pus.
This inner community of more serious stu
dents regards the planned undergraduate library
as a tragedy, as an open concession by ihe ad
ministration to ihe effect that the present unfor
tunate segregation of living areas and academic
areas will be retained and intensified. The dorms
and fraternities have been abandoned 1o the rau
cous, to the artists of the phonograph. "The life
of the mind" has been granted a shelter outside
the living areas.
A well-known group of students, whom we may
call "the Participators," experienced considerable
if familiar anguish upon realizing that they had
not been consulted in the formulation of these
various plans.
The many arc only interested; the few are
profoundly concerned. Among this few there is
much talk of leaving.
The rumor runs wild that enrollment will soon
be expanded to 14,000 in several steps. Such an
increase might well gradually diminish the con
siderable loyalty now maintained by even the
sharpest of Stanford's critics.
Students are insecure, unprepared, unaware of
the impending changes. There is little peace in
the inner city of the university when one is con
stantly wary of where this administration-trig
gered revolution will next strike. Students are
afraid to leave their cars for fear the parking lot
will be excavated while they're at the Post Office.

siderable loyalty now maintained by even the
sharpest of Stanford's critics.
Students are insecure, unprepared, unaware of
the impending changes. There is little peace in
the inner city of the university when one is con
stantly wary of where this administration-trig
gered revolution will next strike. Students are
afraid to leave their cars for fear the parking lot
will be excavated while they're at the Post Office.
A thorough disclosure of broad plans, published
in booklet form by the university and distributed
to those who are committed to a Stanford educa
tion, would be a welcome tranquilizer.
In short, what is the philosophy behind the
growth? Students want to know; having cast
their lot with Stanford, they deserve to know. A
reiteration of educational platitudes will not suf
fice. To what are we aspiring? That aspiration pro
foundly affects the life of every student 011 this
campus.
This column will take issue with some of the
more notable lights in the student community.
The aspect of student life most in need of discus
sion is not the conceivable changes in the social
regulations. At least as important is the recent
supernatural growth of the university and its im
plications and effects for the existence of the
undergraduate.
Since the summer of 1962 we have seen the
opening or announcement of new facilities for
physics, chemistry, engineering, mathematics,
married-student housing, a faculty club, biology,
business, student publications, two foreign cam
puses, a student union, a linear accelerator, an
undergraduate library, and many lesser projects.
In that time tuition has jumped up 25 per cent.
A splendidly organized team of alumni have won
mightily at the subtleties of solicitation. Stanford
now has the softest seats in the West, with more
of the same apparently on the way.
The student reaction has been mixed. Many
students are shaky and fearful. Some students are
osten t at iously import urbable.
The following takes little account of what the
facts of university planning actually are. Un
doubtedly the individuals in charge are competent
and cautious.
Equal in importance to the policies themselves
is the manner in which the students perceive these
changes. The student community has long cher
ished the hope that such perceptions would some
how weigh in future planning decisions. The ac
tion and the reaction contribute equally to the
eventual essence of the university.
Undergraduates are not ordinary consumers;
they do not buy their education by the quarter.
Generally an undergraduate has laboriously con
sidered and chosen his college. He can look up the
requirements; he can ascertain the reputation of
school and professors. But to a large extent when
he makes his choice he can only bet blindly on the
planners.
The new facilities have brought a tempered
ecstacy. Students are delighted with the improved
classroom and laboratory conditions. Howvver,
there is a general feeling that the primary bene
ficiaries are the graduate students and research
workers. There is little expectation that the wave
of renovation and construction will affect teach
ing.
A Lobby?
Sensitive students have been upset by the spa
cious lobby in the new Math Corner, the only aca
demic building with such a lobby. It is suspected
thai this is not intended for the use of flocks of
students waiting to see their palatially closeted
T.A.'s, but rather that it. is intended for purchas
ing agents with research contracts.
There is some sentiment that the new build
ings do not inspire, that they give little feeling of
proximity to the anguish and dedication of re
search. Like attending class in the local branch
of the telephone company.
The reaction to the new foreign campuses was
one of frank admission that; they would be fun

too. Stanford does not take the overseas program
partieularly seriously.
The tuition increase was met with wisdom.
Clearly, so tho students say, the effect will be
highly democratic in the best American tradition.
The higher tuition is raised above the basic costs
of the school, the greater the number of deserving
students who can be put on scholarships. Soon
with a tuition of $10,000 per year, the handful of
very rich kids will be supporting us all. Soon the
middle class will be squeezed out entirely. Only
those who can pay and those who can justify not
paying will survive. An intriguing myth.
Student Afraid
Most importantly, many members of the com
munity of more dedicated students are suddenly
worried, doubting and wondering what type of per
son Stanford plans to encourage. Who is wanted
here? What type of alumni does Stanford hope
to have? Ironically, much talk is heard about
the "residence university," and yet the highest
men's averages are often made by those off-cam
pus.
This inner community of more serious stu
dents regards the planned undergraduate library
as a tragedy, as an open concession by ihe ad
ministration to ihe effect that the present unfor
tunate segregation of living areas and academic
areas will be retained and intensified. The dorms
and fraternities have been abandoned 1o the rau
cous, to the artists of the phonograph. "The life
of the mind" has been granted a shelter outside
the living areas.
A well-known group of students, whom we may
call "the Participators," experienced considerable
if familiar anguish upon realizing that they had
not been consulted in the formulation of these
various plans.
The many arc only interested; the few are
profoundly concerned. Among this few there is
much talk of leaving.
The rumor runs wild that enrollment will soon
be expanded to 14,000 in several steps. Such an
increase might well gradually diminish the con
siderable loyalty now maintained by even the
sharpest of Stanford's critics.
