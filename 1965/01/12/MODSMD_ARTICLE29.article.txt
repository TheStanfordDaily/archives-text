# Editor, The Daily
## GCC Only Represents Those Who Want To Be Represented 
### 
Dear Sir:
I feel compelled to reply to
Dick Willis' letter attacking the
Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee. but 1 am not sure that a de
fense of the G.C.C. is very much
to tho point, for it is difficult to
imagine that the violence of his
rhetoric has any more than a pe
ripheral relation to the organiza
tion. Mr. Willis is an intelligent
man, and when people of intelli
gence sound like cranks, ti is usu
ally because of a failure to define
the sources of their irritation.
The G.C.C. was begun, in part,
when a group of graduate stu
dents came to realize that there
was no place to meet one another,
discuss, and act upon their politi
es 1 convictions and work out their
political angers. Surely, one of
the personal threats to intelligent
men in a world governed by in
stitutions is that impotent anger,
privately conceived and nour
ished, will fail to find its proper
object and dissolve into neurotic
and ineffectual crank letters.
The G.C.C. cannot, of course,
and does not pretend to represent
the interests of students who do
not wish to be represented. The
fact is obvious, and only slightly
less obvious is the fact that un
represented students may. in the
long run, find their interests pro
tected, whether they like it or not.
If social injustices and politi
cal horrors had to be invented,
campus groups would, I suppose,
he le-.\ like dogs returning t«•

their vomit. The metaphor is accu
rate enough, however, and if
there were any alternative to
public political action which could
put an end to that circle of politi
cal disgust, most of the mem
bers of the G.C.C., who are
scholars and intellectuals, not
public men, would take it. But
there is no real alternative, al
though there are other outlets
misanthropy, solipsism, crank
letters—and so the G.C.C., from
a frustration not unlike Mr. Wil
lis', has come into existence,
I hope that graduate students
of good will do not construe these
remarks merely as the reply to
a letter-to-theeditor. but as an
invitation which extends to Mr.
Willis- to attend the G.C.C. meet
ing on Wednesday night and
bring their interests, angers, opin
ions to the difficult and rather
messy task of public political dia
logue.

• Poor Sports Coverage
Dear Sir:
Your sports editor's note on
the letter sent by Frank Hubbard
and Gordon Fast concerning cov
erage of minor sports is inaccu
rate and fails to take account of
the duties of conscientious sports
report ing. The Daily's duty is not
to "plug" minor sports, but to
give them adequate coverage
within the limits of space.
Tlit' spoil': ediloi st.tli". that

the Daily sports department has
always been "extremely recep
tive" to information that they do
not normally see about minor
sports. Personal experience with
last year's Daily sports depart
ment makes this statement ridicu
lous. The Daily reporter assigned
to a certain minor sport never
bothered to attend a home con
test. He had to bo looked up and
given complete information about
the past meet or a future one.
With luck, the Daily sports editor
would then allow a greatly dis
stilled and sometimes inaccurate
version of the information given
to the reporter to appear from
two to five days later. The San
Francisco newspapers, the New
York Times, various peninsula
newspapers, and the wire services
always gave this sport more accu
rate, complete, and prompt cover
age.
The Daily is the only source
of sports information for many
Stanford students, but this should
not be a license for complacency
on the Daily's part. Reporters
should go out. find the news, and
then report it. They should not
be begged to accept it.
The Daily's coverage* of Stan
ford's participation in the Olym
pics seems to show that this past
attitude is continuing. If the
Daily sports department is ever
to achieve a degree of excellence,
it will have to change this atti
tude.
