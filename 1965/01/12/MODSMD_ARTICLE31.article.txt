# POLITICAL RULES
## Story Of Slow Liberalization 
### BILL BERKOWITZ (Second of a Series) 
Jane Stanford said in 1902, "The University must he forever
maintained upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian basis.
It must never become an instrument in the hands of any political
part)' or am religious sect or organization." And further, "I desire
that the University shall forever be kept out of politics."

1 These statements constitute
legal amendments to the Found
ling Grant. But placing the quota
tions in their context, Mrs. Stan-
I ford's concern in the first quote
is more with religion than with
politics, and in the second, more
I with faculty proselytizing than
I with student participation.
History Of Restriction
All the same, the university
! placed a strict interpretation on
| Mrs. Stanford's wishes. On-cam
j pus student political activity was
effectively nil until the 1950'5.
I Not until then could national
political figures speak on cam
pus (there was a "non partisan"
rally for Herbert Hoover in 1928).
!In 1953, (tie university estab
lished Political Union to provide
a forum for such speakers. B u t
nationally-affiliated student politi
cal organizations such as the
YR's or YD's still could not
1 meet on campus. Only ten years
i later, after a strong student push
and long trustee deliberation, was
that right granted.
Four major written sources of
j current policies toward student
! politics at Stanford are the trus
tee statement of March. 1963. the
ASSU constitution (approved at
the same timet and its by-laws,
the 19(54 policy manual of the
Committee on Public Exercises,
and a formal administration state
ment on demonstrations last
spring. These, plus discussions
with concerned parties, helped me
define the existing situation as
j follows:
Registration Ot Groups
1. Organization. Any group
wishing to use university facili
ties and hold open meetings must
register with the Committee on
Student Affairs and Services and
submit a constitution. According
to its chairman, Dr. Eric Hutchin
son, Student Affairs and Services
acts more as a clearinghouse for
organizations than as a regula
tory body. An organization oper
i ating within the law is not re
fused registration on grounds of
content. The membership require
ment of five is purposely low, so
' that ad hoc groups may form,
! sponsor a single event or action,
and then disband. Registration of
organizations was until 1963 a
LASSU function. Either because
LASSU felt it was wasting its
time on these matters, or because
only then could organizations
take stands on external issues, or
both, the task was shifted to a
higher level.
If an organization is "political,"
it also falls under the aegis of
Political Union. Eight do so now
i — YR's, YD's, Peace Caucus, So
cialist Caucus, Stanford Commit
tee for KPFA, India Association,
Mississippi Free d o m Project-
Stanford, and the Graduate Co
j ordinating Committee.
Po|i Union's Function
The relationship of Political
i Union to the voluntary organiza
tions as seen by Dennis Wilson,
jits current president, is mainly
one of facilitating and scheduling
I their programs although it is
true that Political Union by-laws
make it "responsible for the regis
tration, coordination, administra
tion, and regulation of all public
! on-campus political programs of
j the students at Stanford Univer
| sity." and t hat some past olfir
I cers have taken this broader
I view.
2. Recruitment. Setting up
; tables to recruit new members is
| common practice, and goes with
| out St I iil^s.

3. Distribution of literature.
This is also done at tables. With
| the express intention of encour
! aging such distribution. ASSU
President Scott Mcßride this
fall announced that ASSU would
cover the costs of mimeograph
ing up to .">()<> copies of any print
able statement from any regis
tered student organization. This
service has found almost no tak
ers.
Publications Board
On the other hand, general con
> trol over all student publications
is -zested in Publications Board
like Political Union a student
group. Specifically, they are em
powered to restrict distribution
of any student publication issued
I free to more than one quarter of
the student body, and of any stu
i dent publication which is sold,
j Moreover, the president of one
group within Political Union has
reported his need to obtain ap
proval to sell pamphlets to his
i own members at closed meetings.
These powers have been exer
i eised in the past. Present policy
allows on-campus sale of one stu
dent magazine of each type e.g.,
humor, political, literary — with
one quarter of all profits going
to Publications Board.
4. Advocacy. The 1963 trustee
statement for the first time al
lowed Stanford voluntary organi
zations, if properly identifying
themselves, to take stands on pub
! lie issues. So, for example, the
Peace Caucus might distribute
! a flyer urging withdrawal of the
i U.S. from Vietnam.
ASSU Stands Prohibited
The same trustee statement
i specified that ASSU was not to
take stands on matters outside
the Stanford campus. In light of
this, it is interesting to note
LASSU's November resolution
supporting Berkeley's student
government in the latter's appeal
for liberalized political rules on
that campus, and the lack of local
administrative comment.
."5. "Immunity." A key FSM de
mand, essentially supported by
Cal's Academic Senate, is that
only the courts should be able to
discipline a student for illegal
off-campus political action. This
is a sticky issue. At Stanford, one
can safely say that the university
does not now, accept this position,
nor will it in the foreseeable fu
ture. At the same time, the uni
versity has not disciplined stu
dents arrested in local and out
of-state civil rights activity, or
in the 1960 HUAC demonstrations.
And on occasion, the university
has served students by taking
over violations committed in Palo
Alto and imposing lighter sanc
tions than might have the civil
. authorities.
According to Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler, "University
disciplinary regulations are not
geared to state law, because we
are not in a position to determine
! when a law violation occurs.
Legal conviction might possibly
influence a decision, but it is usu
ally not germane to the univer
sity. The concern of the univer
, sity over illegal action off campus
i has mainly to do with the viola
tion of university regulations."
The best known of these regula
tions is seventy years old:
"Students are expected to show
both within and without the IJni
j versify such respect for order,
morality, personal honor, and the
rights of others as is demanded
I of good citizens. Failure to do this
will be sufficient cause for re
im a .il from Ihe I 'nisei - its."
