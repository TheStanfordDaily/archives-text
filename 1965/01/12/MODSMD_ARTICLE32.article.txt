## DeGaulle Plans For Era Of East-West Stalemate 
### Walter Lippmann 
Alter several visits to Europe during the past year it lias be
; come fairly plain to me that President Lyndon Johnson was right
when lie said recently at Georgetown University that "the Atlantic
alliance is not in the midst of crisis . . . but it is in the midst of
change!"
Our prime need is to come to an understanding of that change

so that our attitude and our po--
lic-y may deal with the real world
as it is today.
The Cuban confrontation of
H)62 brought a successful testing
and stabilization of the balance
of nuclear power between the So
viet Union and the United States.
The changes within the Atlantic
alliance have been in the making
since the late 19505. But since the
Kennedy-Khrushchev confronta
tion in 19(52 the almost universal
European conviction has been
I that the world is not in the near
! future faced with a nuclear war.
! This has released the forces of
I change throughout the whole
continent and indeed in the Soviet
I Union as well.
If we keep this in mind, it soon
becomes evident that tlie ques
tion of whether the Western de
fense shall be "European" or "At
lantic" is a false issue. All Euro
pean policies, French, German,
British, Italian, Hungarian, Po
lish, Yugoslav, start from and de
pend wholly on the maintenance
of the balance of power which
was reached in 1962 and has been
accepted both by the Soviet
Union and the United States.
Differences With DeGaulle
Where then do the differences
wilh General De Gaulle begin?
Not on the fact that the peace of
Europe depends on the big Amer
ican nuclear force rather ilian on
the small French force. Not on
the fact that Western Europe
wishes to keep the six American
; divisions on the Continent. On
the contrary, despite all that is
said about the independence of
Europe, the French government
is counting upon and hoping for
the continuing presence of Amer
ican troops for at least 10 years
more.
There are no important differ
ences on the basic view of East
! West relations — that the two
halves of Europe are drawing to
gether through increasing econo
mic and cultural intercourse, or
, that the reunification of Germany
j will eventually come as part of
; this process, or that the Sino-So
i viet conflict is irreconcilable for
some years to come and that Rus
! sia will thus draw closer to Eu
j rope.
If the conflicts within the alli-
I ance do not arise from vital
issues, what are they about? They
! are about what to expect and
j what to prepare for in the next
i 10 or 15 years. General De Gaulle,
I knowing that the present Soviet-
American balance of power will
; not last forever, assumes that the
i immediate business of Western
[ Europe, as distinct from the
United States, is to begin the pre
pare now for the emergencies
J which may arise some 15 years
I from now. His mind is fixed on
j the years immediately ahead of
; us when there is still time for
| Europe to prepare for the future.
De( Jail lie's Assumptions
About that future he makes
certain basic assumptions. One is
that in the course of a generation
Ihe United States may not: be
willing to bear the burdens of pro

tecting Europe which it has
assumed since the second world
war; the United States has vast
and complicated interests in Asia,
Latin America and Africa which
will demand increasing attention.
Moreover, he assumes that the
European nations will not forever
be willing to depend for their de
fense on the United States. The
task of the West Europeans in
this post-Cuba era is to begin to
unite politically and to prepare
! for their own defense.
j The field of Franco-American
j discussion is this coming 15-year
; period when Western Europe, se
: cured within the balance of power
I achieved by the United States,
imust seek to find its political
I unity and an effective defense of
I its own. I made a special effort
to understand concretely th e
i French view of what the Amer
i iean role during this period would
! be.
Pliins For I nity
! There are a number of plans
! for European unity in circulation,
; a French, a German, a Belgian
and an Italian. All of them, I
think, begin with ihe proposal for
; regular meetings, say quarterly,
ot the heads of the European gov
ernments. Each has it own trim
mings dealing with such matters
| as a European secretariat and a
European parliament. Tin 1 essen
tial and common idea in all the
plans is that there must be reg
ular consultation at the highest
j level by the French, the Germans,
! the Italians and eventually the
: Brit ish.
If we think of these European
I meetings we shall not go far
j wrong in understanding General
De Gaulle's purpose when he lays
down the essential French con
dition: It is that no European
country shall take its problems
to Washington until there has
been a European consultation.
The French say that Europe will
never be united if London and
Bonn and Rome are each trying
to make special arrangements
with Washington.
Why Britain Is Opposed
They must first deal with one
another and not compete for the
favor of the United States. This
is the basic reason why France
opposes the entry of Britain into
"Europe" at this time—because
the British count upon a special
relationship with the United
States which has priority over the
interests of Europe. This is why
the French are so strongly op
posed to the American plan for
the MLF — because it is in their
minds a special German-Americ
an military alliance outside of
NATO.
Whether or not the French con
ception of European unity will
work is a question that cannot
be answered unless and until it
has been tried. It is not hard for
the American traveler in Europe
I today to see strong reasons why
a unification of Western Europe
lis exceedingly difficult in view
i of the divergent national interests
! and preoccupations of Britain,
i partitioned Germany and Italy.
