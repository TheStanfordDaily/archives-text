# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Cartouche': Masterpiece Of Escapist Entertainment 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
It is extremely difficult to hit
upon the exact balance of serious
and comic, mental and physical,
and intellectual and emotional in
a movie intended to be entertain
ing.
Cartouche, which hopefully will
not collapse under the weight of
all this cerebration, does that very
thing; and does it with such self
assured nonchalance that one
wonders whether there may not
be some infallible recipe which
when followed will produce a
prize-winner every time. Of course
there isn't, which is what makes
Cartouche's accomplishment even
greater.
As the name (French for cart
ridge) suggests, the film is about
banditry, specifically banditry in
18th century France. It is com
pletely plotless, except for a small
romantic interest that provides
the denouement, the character de
velopment is both confused and
nil, and the adventure is less
swashbuckling than an exercise
in finger agility and the mass at
tack, all of which is intentional
and necessary to I he fun that is
going on.
The fun is making fools of the
nobility and the army in a series
of swordfights, foodfights, rob
beries, and hilarious chases so hot
<â€¢11 I he heels of each other ili.it

the principals barely have time
to catch their collective breath
from the last before tho next be
gins.
Amidst all these good times,
there is fortunately a good deal
j of unblinking realism, thanks to
' the good sense of director Philippe
|de Broca and the color photog
raphy of Christian Matras. The
picture begins with a public geld
ing (using an iron rod) attended
by t ho local dignitaries, and ends
with a pathetic funeral; and in be
tween an idyllic countryside and
a squalid city are reproduced
vvith sobering faithfulness. In
fact, most of the bite in this other
wise innocuous adventure comes
from the absolute candor of the
camera's eye.
The rest of it comes from Jean
Paul Belmondo. whose Cartouche
is equal parts of Robin Hood and
Tom Jones mixed with that ini
mitable Gallic bittersweetness
that makes him a cynic one min
ute and a dreamer the next. His
acting is as skillful as anyone's
around, often even better. And he
is ably assisted by Claudia Cardi
nale, who needs no explanation
("except that she is definitely not
the Maid Marion type), and by
a host of others too numerous
to mention. In fact, a better es
cape from oil!' contemporary con
crete nightmare has not been seen
for a long I ime.
