# Publications Board To Vote On Full-Year Editorship For Daily
## 
### STAN DALEY 
A proposal to extend the term
of Daily editor from one and one
half quarters to a full year will
be considered tonight by the
ASSU Publications Board, accord
ing to Ed Shaw, acting chairman
of the Board. The meeting will
be open to interested students.
The proposal, approved by a ma
jority of the editorial board of
The Daily, is part of a broad pro
posed reform of the section of the
ASSU By-Laws which deals with
the operation of the campus news
paper. If eventually approved by
the Legislature, the changes will
take effect next Autumn.
THE REASON for eliminating
the traditional midyear election,
according to present editor Bob
Naylor, is to stabilize the staff
and to increase the effectiveness
of editors.
"Most past editors of The
Daily," said Naylor, "complain
that just as they were settling
into their positions and getting
to know key administrators as
well as student leader's who are
themselves elected for a whole
year their term expired."
Opposition 1o the extended
term within the editorial board
was based primarily on the belief
that most persons could not

handle the job for a full year.
Naylor said. "It was felt that the
academic sacrifices would bo too
great, although the majority felt
that most aspirants for the job
would lie willing to take on the
burden."
ANOTHER CONCERN was
that an incompetent or irrespon
sible editor would have to be tol
erated twice as long. To meet that
objection, Naylor continued, pro
vision was made giving a major
ity of the staff the power to call
a new election if dissatisfaction
with the editor is high.
Other changes proposed in the
present By-Laws included:
• Reform of the voting system,

j giving added weight to the edi
| torial board.
• More careful definition of
' voting qualifications and proce
i (lures.
• The addition of the news
i editor to the editorial board.
If the Board (which is com
i posed of the editors and business
j managers of the four major stu
j dent publications as well as fac-
I ulty advisors and members of
LASSU) should approve the pro
posal, it will be put on the agenda
|of Thursday night's meeting of
I the Legislature for the first read
[ ing. A two-thirds vote at the Jan.
28 meeting of LASSU would be
j necessary for final approval.

the traditional midyear election,
according to present editor Bob
Naylor, is to stabilize the staff
and to increase the effectiveness
of editors.
"Most past editors of The
Daily," said Naylor, "complain
that just as they were settling
into their positions and getting
to know key administrators as
well as student leader's who are
themselves elected for a whole
year their term expired."
Opposition 1o the extended
term within the editorial board
was based primarily on the belief
that most persons could not

handle the job for a full year.
Naylor said. "It was felt that the
academic sacrifices would bo too
great, although the majority felt
that most aspirants for the job
would lie willing to take on the
burden."
ANOTHER CONCERN was
that an incompetent or irrespon
sible editor would have to be tol
erated twice as long. To meet that
objection, Naylor continued, pro
vision was made giving a major
ity of the staff the power to call
a new election if dissatisfaction
with the editor is high.
Other changes proposed in the
present By-Laws included:
• Reform of the voting system,

j giving added weight to the edi
| torial board.
• More careful definition of
' voting qualifications and proce
i (lures.
• The addition of the news
i editor to the editorial board.
If the Board (which is com
i posed of the editors and business
j managers of the four major stu
j dent publications as well as fac-
I ulty advisors and members of
LASSU) should approve the pro
posal, it will be put on the agenda
|of Thursday night's meeting of
I the Legislature for the first read
[ ing. A two-thirds vote at the Jan.
28 meeting of LASSU would be
j necessary for final approval.
A proposal to extend the term
of Daily editor from one and one
half quarters to a full year will
be considered tonight by the
ASSU Publications Board, accord
ing to Ed Shaw, acting chairman
of the Board. The meeting will
be open to interested students.
The proposal, approved by a ma
jority of the editorial board of
The Daily, is part of a broad pro
posed reform of the section of the
ASSU By-Laws which deals with
the operation of the campus news
paper. If eventually approved by
the Legislature, the changes will
take effect next Autumn.
THE REASON for eliminating
the traditional midyear election,
according to present editor Bob
Naylor, is to stabilize the staff
and to increase the effectiveness
of editors.
