# Johnston Defines Economic Problem In Tropical Africa
## 
### LIZ FREEMAN 
Professor 13nice Johnston of tlie Food Research Institute,
speaking to a large Tresidder crowd last evening told of the diver
sity of economics in Tropical Africa, that area south of the Sahara
and north of the Union of South Africa.
The "European enclave," for example the C Jon go and the
♦Rhodesias. has attracted many

European companies, capital and
workers by the good mineral re
sources. "Peasant-export econ
omies," as Ghana, Nigeria, and
Uganda, derive a sizazle income
from their export products such
as cocoa, cotton and coffee. Pro
duction generally is in the hands
of peasant farmers.
"Resource - poor economies"
such as the interior lands of for
mer French West Africa, provide
in contrast some of the worst de
velopment problems, he con
tinued. These lands are low in
mineral resources, and agricul
tural potential is poor with the
scant rainfall and great distance
from the coast.
Obstacles to economic develop
ment include the "vicious circle
problem" the self-perpetuating
low productivity, income, savings
and investment and the acute
shortage of trained professional
and technical manpower, he said.
Agricultural research on belter
farming methods in tropical econ
omies is a vital, but highly ne
glected area, lie noted. The Afri
can countries are basically agri
cultural, with 90 per cent of the
people earning the i r living
through farming, often at a semi
subsistence level. Any increase
of investment in an industrial sec
tor must be largely based on sav
ings from agriculture, he said.
