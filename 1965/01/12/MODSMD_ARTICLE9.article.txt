# Dr. Rhine On ESP

### DOUG OHMANS 
Ii may actually pay off to think
seven when you roll the dice. Or
so Dr. Joseph Rhine and other
j parapsychologists might contend.
Rhine is one of Ihe growing body
of those who believe in "subject
j object interaction on a non-sen
i sory basis."
"Parapsychology deals with ex
trasensory perception and tli e
! psycho-kinetic effect. ESP is get-
I ting information about the exter
| nal world without the use of the
! senses; psychokinesis is exerting
j an effect upon the external world
without the use of the motor sys
tem. the muscles and the glands.
Rhine told of the many cases
which indicate to him that tele
pathy. precognition, and clair
voyance are at least worth much
further study. Perhaps such study
will prove that man is mistaken
about himself, that there is an
! energy dimension of the mind not
limited to space, time and con
vent ia I physics.
"ESP is disturbing precisely be
cause it challenges basic meta
physics," he said. "But to say
something is'supernatural' is, his
torically, man's first approach to
natural phenomena."
"The study of parapsychology."
said Rhine, "is not a new field,
i but merely a continuation of
man's process of scientific dis
covery." Parapsychology tries to
find a naturalistic explanation t<»r
1 "supernatural" phenomena.
