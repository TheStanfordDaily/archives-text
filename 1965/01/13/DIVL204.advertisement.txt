Love that
Never Lets Go
When a person commits his life to Jesus Christ he soon discovers the super
natural workings of God's power within him. Not only does this power trans
form and enrich, it also delivers and protects the child of God. Indeed, despite
his human shortcomings and failures, the Christian finds himself sustained by
divine love which never lets go. From within and without God protects and
directs the lives of His own so that they can grow in freedom and love. No
force or power is ever able to dislodge the Christian from the eternal surround
ing love of his holy Father. This is the great message brought to us in Chapter
8 of the Epistle to the Romans:
We know that in everything God works for good with those who love Him,
and who are called according to His purpose. For those whom He foreknew
He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, in order that
He might be the first-born among many brethren. And those who He pre
destined He also called; and those whom He called He also justified; and
those whom He justified He also glorified.
What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who is against us? He
| who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up for us all, will He not also
give us all things with Him? Who shall bring any charge against God s elect?
I It is God who justies; who is to condemn? Is it Christ Jesus, who died, yes,
who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed
intercedes for us? Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribula
tion, or distress, or persecution or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
As it is written, For thy sake we are being killed all the day long; we are
regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.' No, in all these we are more than con
querors through Him who loved us. For I am sure that neither death, nor life,
nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all crcotion, will be able to separate
i us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 8:28-39 CSV).
