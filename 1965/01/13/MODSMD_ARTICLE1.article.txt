• Burch (Juits Party Lead
PHOENIX, Ariz. — Dean Bureh will re
sign as Republican national chairman April 1
and Ohio GOP Chairman Ray C. Bliss has
agreed to lake over the job with the blessing
of Barry Goldwater.
In an effort to avoid a party-splitting fight,
this was announced here yesterday at a con
ference attended by Goldwater, the party's
1964 presidential nominee; Burch, Bliss and
William E. Miller, Goldwater's running mate.
Some Republican leaders promptly hailed
the proposed switch as a party unifying mea
sure.
Gov. George Romney of Michigan, men
tioned as a potential GOP presidential candi
date in 1968 and one of those who wanted to
sec Burch ousted, said everyone concerned
about a vigorous two-party system and a

strengthened Republican party should be
greatly encouraged.
• Jury Hears Dam Builder
JACKSON, Miss. — A bulldozer operator
and a small town policeman underwent ques
tioning yesterday by a federal grand jury
probing last summer's slaying of three Mis
sissippi civil rights workers.
This marked the Justice Department's sec
ond attempt to get the 23-member grand jury
to return indictments in the case. Last Octo
ber, the jury refused - but by a narrow mar
gin. Since then, government attorneys say,
they have uncovered additional evidence, in
cluding statements by persons who witnessed
the crime.
One witness, W. H. Pettis, was the bull
dozer operator who built the red clay dam
where the bodies were found.

• Strike Slows Shipping
NEW YORK — Two big luxury liners
were marooned yesterday as seamen lent sup
port to a strike of 60,000 East and Gulf Coast
longshoremen. Leaders of organized labor,
however, sought to halt the walkout by means
of a once-rejected peace pact.
The federal government hinted, mean
while, that a long and costly tieup could bring
compulsory arbitration to the shipping in
dustry.
The United States line canceled a scheduled
Thursday sailing to Europe of its flagship,
the United States, stranding 800 passengers
in New York. The move was prompted, the an

nouncement said, by indications that union
crewmen aboard the vessel would refuse to
cross picket lines of the striking AFL-CIO
International Longshoremen's Association.
• Thurmond To Lose Power
WASHINGTON — Indications grew yes
terday that Sen. Strom Thurmond of South
Carolina will not bo given exactly the commit
tee assignments or seniority he is seeking as
a new Republican.
No final decision was taken by the Commit
tee on Committees, but several sources said
it appears likely that:
1. Thurmond will be left on only one of
the two choice committees on which he served
as a Democrat—Armed Services and Com
merce. He had asked to stay on both.
2. The South Carolinian will not be given
the seniority he sought. He had asked that he

be given credit 011 the Republican side for his
years of service 011 the committees as a Demo
crat.

• Burch (Juits Party Lead
PHOENIX, Ariz. — Dean Bureh will re
sign as Republican national chairman April 1
and Ohio GOP Chairman Ray C. Bliss has
agreed to lake over the job with the blessing
of Barry Goldwater.
In an effort to avoid a party-splitting fight,
this was announced here yesterday at a con
ference attended by Goldwater, the party's
1964 presidential nominee; Burch, Bliss and
William E. Miller, Goldwater's running mate.
Some Republican leaders promptly hailed
the proposed switch as a party unifying mea

Gov. George Romney of Michigan, men

sec Burch ousted, said everyone concerned
about a vigorous two-party system and a

strengthened Republican party should be

• Jury Hears Dam Builder
JACKSON, Miss. — A bulldozer operator
and a small town policeman underwent ques
tioning yesterday by a federal grand jury
probing last summer's slaying of three Mis
sissippi civil rights workers.
This marked the Justice Department's sec
ond attempt to get the 23-member grand jury
to return indictments in the case. Last Octo
ber, the jury refused - but by a narrow mar
gin. Since then, government attorneys say,
they have uncovered additional evidence, in
cluding statements by persons who witnessed
the crime.
One witness, W. H. Pettis, was the bull
dozer operator who built the red clay dam
where the bodies were found.

• Strike Slows Shipping
NEW YORK — Two big luxury liners
were marooned yesterday as seamen lent sup
port to a strike of 60,000 East and Gulf Coast
longshoremen. Leaders of organized labor,
however, sought to halt the walkout by means
of a once-rejected peace pact.
The federal government hinted, mean
while, that a long and costly tieup could bring
compulsory arbitration to the shipping in
dustry.
The United States line canceled a scheduled
Thursday sailing to Europe of its flagship,
the United States, stranding 800 passengers
in New York. The move was prompted, the an

nouncement said, by indications that union
crewmen aboard the vessel would refuse to
cross picket lines of the striking AFL-CIO
International Longshoremen's Association.
• Thurmond To Lose Power
WASHINGTON — Indications grew yes

Carolina will not bo given exactly the commit

a new Republican.
No final decision was taken by the Commit

it appears likely that:
1. Thurmond will be left on only one of
the two choice committees on which he served
as a Democrat—Armed Services and Com
merce. He had asked to stay on both.
2. The South Carolinian will not be given
the seniority he sought. He had asked that he

be given credit 011 the Republican side for his
