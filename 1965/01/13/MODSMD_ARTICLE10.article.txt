## 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
Clare Booth Luce yesterday wrote oft the Republican Party's
chances of victory for as long as the Democrats "maintain peace
and prosperity."
Mrs. Luce, ANN'S guest-in-rcsidence, made this forecast in a
speech on "The Future of the Two Party System in the U.S."

yesterday afternoon in Dinkel-"
spiel Auditorium.
TRACING the history of the
two party system in the United
States, Mrs. Luce, a former Re
publican congress woman and am
bassador to Italy under Eisen
hower, drew the conclusion that
t he "only hope for the Republican
Party as matters stand today is j

the failure of the Democratic
Party."
She stated that under pro
longed one party rule the party
in power tends to grow bigger
| and to appropriate the best ideas
, of the opposition.
President Johnson lias already
I done that she feels, "adopting
I many" of Goldwater's ideas from
1 the last election, such as economy
in government and tax reduction.
MRS. LUCE also stated that
each party has a core vote of
people who have always voted
I for one party and will continue
I to do so unless there is a pro
longed crises such as war or do
l pression.
The hard core of both parties
is conservative she stated, "and
the man most aware of this fact
iis President Johnson," hinting
| that the President's "Great So
; ciety" may not be so liberal as
to risk the loss of core voters in
: the South and Midwest.
However, the Republican Party
cannot find any issues, she be
lieves, on which to win an elec
! tion. "If the conservatives will
! not accept liberal rule, and if the
liberals will not accept conserva
tive rule," she said that then "the
Republicans can only return to a
'me too' position." She added that
such a position has lost the party
: five of the last seven elections.
RAKIiING WAR or depression
I the only way that a party out of
i power can gain office is through
a "charismatic leader," she said,
; but that it usually takes a World
| War to produce such a person.
While her forecast for the Re
i publican Party's future is gloomy,
! Mrs. Luce stressed that she does
not mean that Republican workers
must give up. "There must al
'ways be an opposition," said
