# Board OK's One-Year Editorship
## LASSU Examines Issue Thursday 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
With only one dissenting ab
sentee vote, the 18-man Publi
cations Board decided last night
to recommend to the Legislature
that the editorship of The Daily
become a one-year job.
The proposal will be presented
to LASSU Thursday for a first
reading and then sent to the
Legislature's By-Laws commit
tee. No vote will be taken until
the next LASSU meeting two
! weeks later.
i
Other By-Law changes w c r e
also recommended, including a
proposal to slightly increase the
voting power of the Editorial
i Board and senior staff members.
808 NAYI/OR, editor of The
Daily, spoke in favor of the one
: year editorship. He urged that.
| the present system of two editors
j a year be scotched for the follow -
| ing reasons:
• Efficiency would be enhanced
| if The Daily did not have to face
a major administrative reshuffl
ing twice each year. Under tho
j present system, elections are held
! at the end of January and near
' the end of May.
• Such a change would lead to
a relative increase in the editor's
j "power and influence" vis-a-vis
other student leaders.
• Sense of "continuity" would
replace the present problem that
many editors have cited; namely,
that of having their term expire
i "just as they were getting
started."
Opposition arguments centered
! around the fact that assumption
of such a post would force the edi
tor to take a limited number of
1 units each quarter, thus requiring
| him to either take an extra quar
j ter of school or concentrate extra
units into his regular quarter
j schedule.
ASSU President Scott Mcßride
; thought that such a necessity
might limit the number of candi
dates and tiic diversity of opinion
offered at any given Daily elee-
I tion.
Another objection was that a
one-year editorship would lead to
i too much professionalism on The
Daily.
BOTH OF these objections were
(overcome before the final vote.
| As a safeguard against an in
competent editor, a By-Law was
| added to provide for a recall peti
! tion.
