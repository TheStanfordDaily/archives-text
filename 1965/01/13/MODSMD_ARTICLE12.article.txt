# A 						Phi O Will Seek Relief Funds To Aid Northwest Flood Victims
## 
### 
A Phi O, national service fra
ternity at Stanford, will seek
funds this week to help 17,000
families made homeless by the
recent floods. Funds will be given
to the American National Red
Cross, official relief agency for
the disaster area.
A Phi O Flood Relief Fund,
which has set a $750 goal, will
collect donations from 9 until 3

Wednesday and Thursday in
Whito Memorial Plaza. Door-to
door solicitation will take place
in the dormitories about 7 p.m.
Thursday night. Cannisters for
donations will be placed in the
dining halls Wednesday and
Thursday.
ALTHOUGH families have
been displaced by foods in Cali
fornia and Oregon alone, only 38

shelters have been built.
Floods in the total disaster
area- -California, Idaho, Oregon,
and Washington -have destroyed
or damaged over twelve thou
sand homes. Almost 2000 farm
buildings, 713 trailers, and 570
small business establishments
have also been affected.
Hard hit communities may have
! to be relocated, and temporary
housing is necessary in most
; areas. The Red Cross Disaster
; Bulletin forecasts a $5 million ex
penditure for flood relief.
A PHI O REMINDS the Stan
ford community that it "can do
more than just offer a passing
comment on the tragedy that has
occured. Within the disaster
areas a rehabilitation program is
commencing ... In the coming
i days Alpha Phi Omega will be
soliciting for the Flood Relief

Fund . . . Wo sincerely hope thai
the Stanford community will
take this opportunity to help the
victims of the floods rebuild their
homes."
All hough some government aid
is available, a great need Jar
funds still exists for the exreitSivf*
rebuilding campaign. Red Cross
relief workers visualize a diffi
cult task in helping thousands of
affected families back on the road
to recovery.
