# LACK OF DEPTH HURTS
## Gymnasts Host SJS Tonight 
### HUGH WEST 
Depth will be the problem this
year for the Stanford Gymnastics
squad, according lo head gymnas
tics coach John Gilmore. Last
year as interim coach, Gilmore
guided ihe gymnasts io their first
winning season since 1949.
But Gilmore will be hard
pressed to equal last year's 6-2
season for what he calls "lack ol'
bodies." Gone are four lettermen
from the 1964 team, and only two
are returning. Gilmore will not
even be able to fill out some
events with the standard three
competitors.
THE RETURNEES, however,
are strong performers. A 1 Miya
moto was undefeated last year
in duel side-horse competition
with a season average of 8.54 and
placed ninth in the NCAA tourna
ment. Bill Rusher turned in ade
quate performances in the hori
zontal bar, long horse, parallel
bars, and rings.
Gilmore is also quick to point
out that the team faces a much
tougher schedule this year than
last. Cal Poly and Chico State, In
dian victims last year, have been
replaced by USC, UCLA, a n d

Santa Barbara. Oregon has also
been added to the schedule.
Looking to the first meet to
night against San Jose State <7:3(1
Pavilioni, Gilmore feels that the
squad with the most men will
win. San Jose has had a depth
problem similar to Stanford's this I
year, but how severe it is is not 1
certain.
THE SPARTAN cause will be j
aided by season all-around per- '
former Rich Chew, who already j
has a 46.65 score in the six events
this season, and by Jeff Milman
on the trampoline.

A special feature of tonight's
meet which should interest all
gymnastics enthusiasts is that the j
newly-formed Stanford Gymnas- ,
tics Club will also compete. The j
team consists of four Stanford
graduate students, a Stanford
graduate, a Stanford freshman,
<i transfer student ineligible for j
competition this year, and a "red-1
shirt" Stanford student.
The Club includes former na
tional side-horse champion Russ
Mills, side-horse runner-up Bill
Lawler, and AAU Trampoline
Champion Tom Osterland.
