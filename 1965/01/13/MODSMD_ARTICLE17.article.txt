### BOB THIERIOT 
The Stanford Sailing Club has
been quietly operating for one
year on campus unknown to many
of the students. Only this quar
ter lias it become well enough
organized to begin instruction
and races.
Last year a dozen men got to
gether and decided that Stanford
needed a sailing club to offer the
students an opportunity to learn
to sail. They put a boat on dis
play and showed a movie on the
America's Cup.
THE RESPONSE they received
was beyond all their hopes. About
150 people demonstrated an in
terest. The Alumni helped with
almost $8,000 in gifts.
The club was able 1o buy eight
"Flying Juniors." These are fibre
glas boats with a main and jib
which are fairly easy to sail.
Because of the large amount
of interest shown, the Sailing Club
set up a registration this quar
ter. One hundred twenty-five as
pirants appeared. Next Saturday,
January 16, they will do their
first sailing (in Lake Lagunita.
The club will sail on the lake
until early May when the up
shooting weeds and reeds will
force them out of the water. They
will then revert to either the Red
wood City Harbor or Foster City.
The boats will remain at Lagu
nita through the spring.
THE ( LI B will have its first
general meeting of the quarter
tomorrow. It will be held in Room
274, Tresidder at 7 p.m. Anyone
who desires to join the club is
invited to attend the meeting.
The club hopes to get some
hired instructors in to teach be

ginners. They will sail each week
end day from 10-4. Later on, when
the demand becomes greater, they
will expand to sailing on week
days also.
Those interested in the Sailing
Club unable to attend Thursday's
meeting may phono the club presi

see him at the Sailing Club desk
in the ASSU Office. Those solely
interested in racing may contact
