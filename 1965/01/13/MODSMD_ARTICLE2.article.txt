I Ik* Reserve Book Room in
the Main Library will be trans
ferred to the Western Civiliza
tion Library, according to Ruth
erford D. Rogers, Director of
of University Libraries.
The two hour reserves will lie
moved on Friday and Saturday,
Jan. 15 and 16. The open shelf
reserves will be moved in approxi
mately three weeks when renova
tions to the Western Civilization
are completed.
A SHARP DECLINE in the
use of these two facilities plus
an emergency need for additional
staff work space in the Main Li
brary are the principal reasons
for the move Rogers said.
°
The use of the Western Civiliza
tion Library dropped to a new
low during the fall quarter of
3964. This follows a pattern of
declining use over the last four '
years. During the fall quarter of
1960, 46,119 books were issued
compared with 7,952 during last
quarter. It is believed that the
increased availability of paper
back books has been a prime fac
tor in this decline.
Use of the Reserve Book Room
has also fallen off during tiie last
few years, although not as
sharply as Western Civilization.
C OMBINATION of the two fa
cilities will offer the users of the
Reserve Book Room six additional
hours of service per week, from
5 to 11 p.m. on Saturday. The
Western Civilization Library will
be open 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. Mon
day through Saturday and from
