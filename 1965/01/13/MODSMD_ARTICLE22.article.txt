# Can The Cal Turmoil Spread To Stanford?
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR Editor 
Almost a month and a half after the mass sit-in
at Sproul Hall on the Berkeley campus, students,
journalists, and administrators are still asking
why the so-called Free Speech Movement ever got
so far and whether such a movement could occur,
say, at Stanford.
Last week, a reporter from the Los Angeles
Times met with Stanford administrators and stu
dents to discuss just the latter question. He re
ceived thoughtful responses, for it was tho num
ber one topic of conversation within several high
councils of the administration. It was clear that
someone was worried.
Can It Happen Here?
The reasons for that worry are not obvious,
since any meaningful examination of the situa
tion reveals a number of important differences
between Berkeley and Stanford.
Perhaps the most important difference is in
the size of the institutions. Emphasized over and
over again in explanations of why the FSM ob
tained such strong student support is the frustra
tion which so many students face when con
fronted with such a massive, complex and imper
sonal university bureaucracy. The tendency for
the student to feel lost in a vast, computerized
"education machine" is much more widespread at
Cal than at Stanford. While the ideal "community
of scholars" is practically non-existent at both
schools (a fact which should cause serious doubts
of our claim to 'greatness' as a university), the
situation is certainly less critical here.
Another important difference between Ber
keley and Stanford is in the nature of the student
bodies. On the average, Cal students are drawn
from families with fewer economic resources and
less education than the families of Stanford stu
dents, which may be one explanation for the pro
nounced radicalism of many Berkeley students.
Pacifists and socialist groups at Cal are numerous
and large, and civil rights workers more militant
than the Stanford variety. Consequently, the at
mosphere at Cal is almost electric with constant,
intense controversy generated by many hundreds
of involved students.
The Non-Sfcndents
This atmosphere is reinforced by the presence
of large numbers of non-student hangers-on who
have an opportunity to wield influence in student
organizations, due largely to the fact that the
university is nestled in the middle of a city, rather
than isolated by at least a mile of open land, as is
Stanford. Over one fourth of those arrested in
Sproul Hall were not students at Berkeley. Buses
would have to bo chartered to get that many non
student demonstrators to Stanford's Quad.
These differences alone seem to make it highly
unlikely that the Sproul Hall situation could ever
occur at Stanford. One wonders wether Cal isn't
almost unique among American universities, and
whether in fact such turmoil is quite impossible*
anywhere else.
This is especially true when one considers the
circumstances which lay behind the December
crisis. The Berkeley administration was incred
ibly inept in its initial announcement that long
ignored rules on political activity would suddenly
l>e enforced. There was no warning or prior con
sultation with students or faculty.
This action caused the founding of the FSM and
gave it the support (in the beginning) of almost
every political group on campus, from the Young
Republicans and the Goldwaterites to the Dußois
Clubs and the pacifists. Without that initial mo
mentum, it is unlikely that Mario Savio and other
militants ever would have gained so much influ
ence.
A Series Oi Blunders
The ineptness continued (1) during the Greek
Treat re rally at which President Clark Kerr de
stroyed much student support with a singularly
unimpressive presentation and by the use of
strong-arm guards to haul Savio from the stage,
thereby creating sympathy for the FSM leader,
(2) in the handling of the sit-in threat and use of
"over-kill" or excessive numbers of police in re

moving tho demonstrators. All these events only!
increased tho power of the Free Speech Movement. I
The fact that university administrators around!
tho country have watched the developments at
Cal and learned the obvious lessons certainly re
duces the likelihood of similar tactical errors else-,
where. But despite these differences in environ-;
ment and circumstance, there is still worry that ;
something like the Cal mess could conceivably}
happen here.
One weakness which exists at Stanford and at |
most universities lies in the student government.!
In general the mass of students have very littlej
interest in student government, largely becausej
its concerns are of small importance and generally
irrelevant to daily student activities or needs. I
The lack of interest tends to reduce the respon
sibilities given to student government, which in j
turn provides even less reason for student interest. ■!
At Cal the ASUC (Associated Students of the j
University of California) has developed into a sort
of administrative organization concerned primar-j
ily with student sei*vices. The ASUC Senate is;
highly unrepresentative, and only about 1,700 of;
the vast student body participated in last year's!
student body elections.
Student government has atrophied to the point
that when an issue of great importance arose, stu-'
dents did not feel they could have their opinions'
effectively heard cxceptthrough a special organi-;
gation, the FSM.
Student Government At Stanford
At Stanford the situation is much better, with
LASSU representing, at least in theory, every liv
ing group. Here the student government is in-!
volved in much more than student services: it regu
lates campus political activity and social regula-;
tions, at least partially, and is involved indirectly
in a number of faculty-staff committees which
help develop university policy.
But the apathy and disinterest in student gov
ernment is still a major problem: LASSU would
never get quorums if it did not eliminate dozens j
of absentee representatives from tho quorum re- -
quirement.
While less pronounced than the initial outcry
at Cal. there is a good deal of dissatisfaction at
Stanford with the rules pertaining to political ac
tivity among leaders of political groups, a dissatis
faction which has been increasing with the al
ledged mismanagement of Political Union this
year.
Fortunately, there are signs that this dissatis
faction, rather than taking the path of the
Berkeley movement, will be handled through'
LASSU, where a committee is in the fire to investi-!
gate the entire set of rules and regulations, in- 1
eluding the Student Organizations Fund and the!
role of the Student Financial Manager. Whether j
the newly-formed and nebulously-defined Graduate
Coordinating Committee will be satisfied with a
mere LASSU investigation and partial reform, or
whether other less patient student groups will
rise to push the cause more vigorously, has yet
to be seen.
riunning Behind The Chaos
It is ihe latter situation for which the adminis-i
t ration is most wary, for it is in that form that a
peculiarly disturbing aspect of the Berkeley prob-1
lem can assert itself here. It is no secret that sub- :
versive elements, including students, were active
at Berkeley during the turmoil, but there is in-!
creasing suspicion that the role of professional (
agitators was carefully planned and that exten-1
sive organizational support was ready to exploit
discontent long before Strong's September dictum
on student political activity.
II is further suspected that similar plans are
ready to go into effect at other universities, once
an issue is raised and banners unfurled. One of
those universities, it is feared, could be Stanford.!
Those who talk of such potential conspiracy i
are careful to emphasize that there is presently
only fragmentary substantiation for their suspi-!
cions, but that the substantiation is mounting and .
that the possibility must be kept in mind.
At the same time, they realize full well that!
in the last analysis, there will be no uprising here
of the type that occurred at Berkeley unless there!
is also the kind of burning issue and pent-up dis-]
satisfaction among students that Ihe FSM ex- j
ploited so masterfully. The University intends to'
do everything it can to make sure that such an!
issue and such massive discontent never occur.
