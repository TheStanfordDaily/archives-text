# POLITICAL FREEDOM
## Apathy Never Breaks Rules 
### BILL BERKOWITZ (Third of a Series) 
Continuing our inventory of political rules from yesterday
6. Demonstration. The policy release of last May allows or
derly demonstrations in public outdoor areas of the campus, as
long as they do not interfere with educational activities. This
policy, reflecting past university action, has meant that placards
protesting NATO or ROTC could not be carried into Frost

Amphitheater or the Sunken Dia
mond, and that opponents of fall
out shelters could not hold signs
outside President Sterling's home.
Free picketing of inner quad lias
occurred more than once, though
never by more than a few persons.
Short, semi-spontaneous, and
sparsely attended rallies over nu
clear testing and Cuba have been
held in the past few years. They
are subject to the above regula
tions, and technically to those
described below. But these direct
forms of protest are not estab
lished forms of campus life.
Speaker Approval
7. Outside speakers. A regis
tered voluntary organization may
bring an oulside speaker to cam
pus if:
A. The president of tho organi
zation ow his delegated representa
tive approves.
B. The Vice-President of ASSU
grants "social approval."
C. The Student Financial Man
ager ascertains that condition <B)
has been fulfilled, and that the
organization has enough money
to pay for the costs of the speech,
such as speaker fee, student
police, and public address systems.
D. A representative of Political
Union approves the program, if
the organization is political.
All approvals (A) through (D)
must be obtained and filed at least
ten days prior to the event.
E. The university Committee
on Public Exercises passes favor
ably on the program.
According to Agnes Nohrnberg
of the committee, it has not in
her five-year tenure barred a pro
posed speaker on the basis of his
political views. And in recent
memory, it has never turned down
a program approved by Political
Union. Criteria for student ap
provals are not supposed to be on
grounds of content; in usual prac
tice, these approvals aie formali
ties. Yet the lack of a student
signature for any reason is not
easily appealed, and can at tin
least delay final approval.
Funds But Not Buttons
8. Finances and solicitations.
All voluntary student organiza
tions must deposit all of their
money (except for possible dis
pensations of up to $2.1) with the
Student Organizations Fund, run
by a Student Financial Manager.
The fund presumably consolidates
paperwork and gives Stanford or
ganizations a uniformly high
credit rating. The Student Finan
cial Manager must validate all re
quests for funds by a member
group.
An organization wishing to
solicit money on campus must
first secure the approval of a
committee made up of the Student
Financial Manager and the stu
dent body President and Vice-
President. Approval is at present
granted on an individual case
basis.
Solicitations are differentiated
from drives and benefits. A drive
is a one-per-quarter, heavily-pub
licized, campus-wide affair, usu
ally supported by Cardinals
Board. LASSU chooses the or
ganization to conduct the drive
in a given quarter. Fall quarter
has recently been pre-empted by
World University Service, an d
the spring traditionally belongs
to Con Home. A benefit usually
involves entertainment for which
tickets arc sold, the profits going
to the cause sponsored by t he
organization. Informal policy al
lows one benefit per year per
organization. Any solicitation at
a benefit or other public meeting
must have both ASSU and Pub
lic Exercises approval

John Anderholt, Student Finan
cial Manager, notes that new poli
cies, placing general limits on the
length and number of solicitations
will probably soon lie offered, sub
ject to LASSU approval.
After all t his. what may we
conclude? My own feeling is I hat
it is difficult to say how much
political freedom exists at Stan
ford. because this freedom is in
frequently exercised.
If the tone of the past analysis
has been critical, it should not
obscure that fact that given what
organizations here have wanted
to do, they have almost always
been able to do it. Violations have
sometimes been winked at. Still
in all, what: freedom exists on
this private property is bestowed,
not legally protected by the state
and federal constitutions. Con
tinued bestowal depends upon
the continued presence of men of
good will in positions of power.
Men otherwise disposed could eas
ily work within the existing body
of regulations to bring political ac
tivity on this campus to a stand
still.
I cannot now doubt thai Stan
ford administrators are men of
good will. Nor do I think of them
as poised to spring on the first
group that goes beyond the pale.
The administration's thoughts
are usually on more elevated and
less distasteful matters.
Apathy At Stanford
Wisely so. because the great
majority of Stanford students
are not political activists. The
stock explanations, academic
pressure and high socio-economic
status, are probably valid. What
ever the reasons, these points are
clear: McÃŸride's "Project Opin
ion"" failed, last year's proposed
"Hyde Park" area in back of
Tresidder failed. The graduate
students, more than half of the
male students, have notoriously
failed to speak out on anything,
or even to fill their assigned seats
in a legislature they could domi
nate. Twenty per cent or fewer
of those qualified vote in ASSU
elections. And recent history is
littered with political groups that
died in infancy.
In contrast, active in Berkeley
this fall were the Young Repub
licans, University Society of In
dividualists, Cal Students for
Goldwater, California College Re
publicans, Young Democrats, Stu
dent Civil Liberties Union, CORE,
SNCC, SLATE, Students for a
Democratic Society, W.E.B. Du-
Bois Club, Young Socialist Alli
ance, Young People's Socialist
League, Independent Socialist
Club. Women for Peace, Commit
tee for Independent Political Ac
tion, May 2nd Committee (Viet
nam), Students for Fair Hous
ing. Democratic Socialist Club,
and the University Society of Lib
ertarians. Even though all these
groups are "off-campus" organi
zations. how the administration
here would react to a daily gaunt
let of twenty-odd tables in White
Plaza can only be conjectured.
