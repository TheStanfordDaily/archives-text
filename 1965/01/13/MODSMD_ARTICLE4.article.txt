# Watt Discusses Conrad's Vision
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
"There is a constant disparity
| in Joseph Conrad between the
j nearer and the farther vision—
between the seer.and the sea
man, between philosophy and
experience, between intellectual
! truth and human loyally."
It was in terms of this duality
of perspective in terms of the
tension between "alienation" and
"commitment" — that Stanford
English professor lan Watt char
acterized the work of Joseph Con
rad in Watt's Tuesday Evening
Series lecture yesterday.
Conrad's sense of man's aliena
tion from both the obscure pur
poses of a chaotic universe and
from other men formed the basis
of his "farther" vision, Watt ex
plained.
In Conrad's terms, conscious
ness is a "curse," increasing hu
man sorrow, because it reveals
to those who would see it the
elemental disparity between actu
ality and aspiration.
! HOWEVER, alienation was not
the whole of Conrad's vision: "His
attitude toward his audience, and
toward humanity in general was
a fragile balance between co n
tempt and wide-eyed affection."
This affection — Conrad's sense
that a solidarity with and a com
mitment lo the rest of humanity
was not only possible but in some
vague way essential informed
the foreground of his work what
Watt termed his "nearer vision."
Thus, for Conrad, humanity
was at once laughable and tragic:
"The public will swallow any
; thing," he once wrote, "it is an
ostrich ... a bottomless sack . . .

it apparently has neither eyes nor
entrails, like a slug. . . . And j
yet it can weep and suffer."
