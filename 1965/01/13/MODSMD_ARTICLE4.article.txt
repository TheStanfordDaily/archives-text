# Watt Discusses Conrad's Vision
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN 
"There is a constant disparity
| in Joseph Conrad between the
j nearer and the farther vision—
between the seer.and the sea
man, between philosophy and
experience, between intellectual
! truth and human loyally."
It was in terms of this duality
of perspective in terms of the
tension between "alienation" and
"commitment" — that Stanford
English professor lan Watt char
acterized the work of Joseph Con
rad in Watt's Tuesday Evening
Series lecture yesterday.
Conrad's sense of man's aliena
tion from both the obscure pur
poses of a chaotic universe and
from other men formed the basis
of his "farther" vision, Watt ex
plained.
In Conrad's terms, conscious
ness is a "curse," increasing hu
man sorrow, because it reveals
to those who would see it the
elemental disparity between actu
ality and aspiration.
