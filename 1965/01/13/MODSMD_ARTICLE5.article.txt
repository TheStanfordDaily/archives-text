## 
### 
Tlic Graduate Coordinating
Committee will hold an organi
zational meeting tonight at 8:00
at Tresidder, Room 275. The
meeting is open to all members
of the University community.
Formed in response to the
Berkeley free speech controversy,
the GCC has. until now. limited
its activity to presenting informa
tion and gathering support for
the objectives of the Free Speech
Movement. Tonight, other activ
ities, dealing with University
problems as well as off-campus
issues, will be discussed and or
ganized.
EXPLANATION of what the

GCC is was furnished last quarter
in a statement by Steven Marx,
a committee spokesman: "The
GCC will sponsor political discus
sion and activity dealing with
bolh on and off-campus issues
and will attempt to provide bases
and channels of communication
among graduate students of dif
ferent depart ments. be t w eon
graduate students and undergrad
uates, and between the student
body and the faculty."
The committee's first action
was to circulate a petition ex
pressing approval of the Berke
ley Academic Senate's motion of
December S. "Despite the fact
that this petition was circulated
during finals weeks, we imme
diately had forty volunteers will
ing to be active," said Tom Sher
man, another spokesman.
On the basis of this and the
large response to the petition
which was signed by over 1200
students and 200 faculty members
• it was decided to continue the
GCC on ;i permanent basis. "But
the GCC is not a legislature of
graduate students," Sherman
said.
Current memberships numbers
about 100, he said. Projects in
clude:
• Forums planned to deal with
controversial subjects r a n g in g
from the U.S. policy in Vietnam
to the legalization of marijuana.
• A program of interdepart
mental seminars in the social sci
ences arranged to consider spe
cific solutions to social problems.
• A commit lee established to
provide for full representation of
graduate students in student gov
ernment at Stanford.
• Another committee investi
gating the advisability of union
izing teaching assistants and em
ployed graduate students.
