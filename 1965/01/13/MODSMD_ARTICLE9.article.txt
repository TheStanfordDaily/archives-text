### SUSAN HEILMAN 
Meeting Stanford women informally in small
group discussion sessions. Mrs. Clare Booth Luce
yesterday questioned current-day concern over
the femininity of the American woman.
"Women are getting married younger and
younger and raising larger and larger families,"
she pointed out, "Obviously the men consider tluit
they are adequately female."
TlllO ITEM of crucial concern, in Mrs. Luce's
estimation, however, is whether or not the Ameri
can woman is becoming a person. "The most im
portant ideal for every woman is that she become
a unique person. Biological feminity is secondary.
Men always know the difference between a girl
who is a person and a girl who is just a girl."
To develop this individuality, Mrs. Luce urged
that every woman of college age prepare for a
part-time career in a field she truly enjoys. Mrs.
Luce, who herself has achieved recognition as an
ambassadress, eongresswoman and playwright,
was careful to distinguish between the terms
"career" and "job."
"A jol) is something a woman takes to earn
money or perhaps as an outside interest. A career
is a calling which comes from inside, to which a
woman is totally dedicated."
EVKHY WOMAN should have a specialty she
stated, something of interest after her family is
grown. "In the 3.'5 years beyond 10 which a woman
can now expert I«• live, she will have in f.ice herseli

as a person. The saddest tiling imaginable is when
women become 'just old ladies.' "
Mrs. Luce cited civic and political activities as
one of the most worthwhile and needy - areas
of interest. Every woman, she stated, can and
should do something to help her community. Every
woman can combine a career and marriage. Grass
roots politics or civic betterment are a start.
"FOH INSTANCE," she said, "in the field of
foreign affairs I would take the views of Senator
Margaret Chase Smith faster than those of any
man diplomat or politician."
Moving on to another topic close to the hearts
of Stanford women, Mrs. Luce expressed strong
views about social regulations and university au
thority in general.
She described as "romantic responsibility" the
desire of some students to be able become in
dividually answerable for their actions. People
may think they know what's right for themselves,
she said, but there is just as much a need for
social regulations as there is for traffic laws.
Furthermore, Mrs. Luce maintained that the uni
versity itself has every right to take such respon
sibility.
INITIALLY, SUM feels that authority rests
with the parents. "Until you can pay your own
way through school, you are still your parents'
child and are not entitled to authority." However,
where parental supervision leaves off, then uni
versity supervision must begin.
