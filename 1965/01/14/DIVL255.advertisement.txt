God s Message to Jews Today
We sometimes forget that the Apostle Paul was a Jew as was Jesus Christ.
Raised and educated in the finest Jewish tradition Paul was an outstanding
scholar and theologian of his day. But for many years he was dead wrong about
Jesus Christ, as his own testimony bears record (Philippians 3:5—14). It was
on the road to Damascus (Acts 9) that a meeting with the resurrected Lord Jesus
changed his entire life. As a result he became a great apostle of Jesus Christ,
entrusted with God's message to the non-Jewish world. In his letter to the
Romans Paul expresses his own concern for his fellow Jews, praying that they
might turn and recognize their Messiah who had been among them:
"Oh, Israel, my people! Oh, my Jewish brothers! How I long for you to
come to Christ. My heart is heavy within me and I grieve bitterly day and
night because of you. Christ knows and the Holy Spirit knows that it is no more
pretense when I say that I would be willing to be forever damned if that would
save you. God has given you so much, but still you will not listen to Him. He
took you as His own special, chosen people and led you along with a bright
cloud of glory and told you how very much He wanted to bless you. He gave
you His rules for daily life so you would know what He wanted you to do.
He let you work for Him in the temple. He gave you mighty promises. Great
men of God were your fathers, and Christ Himself was One of you, a Jew as
far as His human nature is concerned, He Who now rules over all things and is
blessed of God forever. Well then, did God's promises to His Jewish people
become worthless when they refused to come to be saved? Of course not. For
His promises are only to those who come. Only they are truly His People. They
alone are truly Jews. So you sec, not everyone born into a Jewish family is
truly a Jew . ..
"Isaiah the prophet cried out concerning the Juws that though there would
be millions of them, only a small number would ever be saved. For the Lord
will execute His sentence upon the earth, quickly ending His dealings, justly
cutting them short. And Isaiah says in another place thct except for God s
mercy all the Jews would be destroyed —all of them —just as everyone in the
cities of Sodom and Gomorrali perished. Well then, what shall we say about
these things? Just this, that God has given the Gentiles the opportunity to be
saved by faith; even though they really were not seeking God. But the Jews
who tried so hard to be right with God by keeping His laws, did find salva
tion. Why not? Because they were trying to be saved by keeping the law and
being good instead of by depending on faith. They have :>tumbled over the
great stumbling stone. God warned them of this in the Scriptures when He
said, I have put a kock in tl e path of the Jews, and many will stumble over
Him (Jesus). But those who believe in Him will never be disappointed." (Ro
mans 9:1 6, 27-33 Living Letters).

will execute His sentence upon the earth, quickly ending His dealings, justly
cutting them short. And Isaiah says in another place thct except for God s
mercy all the Jews would be destroyed —all of them —just as everyone in the
cities of Sodom and Gomorrali perished. Well then, what shall we say about
these things? Just this, that God has given the Gentiles the opportunity to be
saved by faith; even though they really were not seeking God. But the Jews
who tried so hard to be right with God by keeping His laws, did find salva
tion. Why not? Because they were trying to be saved by keeping the law and
being good instead of by depending on faith. They have :>tumbled over the
great stumbling stone. God warned them of this in the Scriptures when He
said, I have put a kock in tl e path of the Jews, and many will stumble over
Him (Jesus). But those who believe in Him will never be disappointed." (Ro
mans 9:1 6, 27-33 Living Letters).

God s Message to Jews Today
We sometimes forget that the Apostle Paul was a Jew as was Jesus Christ.
Raised and educated in the finest Jewish tradition Paul was an outstanding
scholar and theologian of his day. But for many years he was dead wrong about
Jesus Christ, as his own testimony bears record (Philippians 3:5—14). It was
on the road to Damascus (Acts 9) that a meeting with the resurrected Lord Jesus
changed his entire life. As a result he became a great apostle of Jesus Christ,
entrusted with God's message to the non-Jewish world. In his letter to the
Romans Paul expresses his own concern for his fellow Jews, praying that they
might turn and recognize their Messiah who had been among them:
"Oh, Israel, my people! Oh, my Jewish brothers! How I long for you to
come to Christ. My heart is heavy within me and I grieve bitterly day and
night because of you. Christ knows and the Holy Spirit knows that it is no more
pretense when I say that I would be willing to be forever damned if that would
save you. God has given you so much, but still you will not listen to Him. He
took you as His own special, chosen people and led you along with a bright
cloud of glory and told you how very much He wanted to bless you. He gave
you His rules for daily life so you would know what He wanted you to do.
He let you work for Him in the temple. He gave you mighty promises. Great
men of God were your fathers, and Christ Himself was One of you, a Jew as
far as His human nature is concerned, He Who now rules over all things and is
blessed of God forever. Well then, did God's promises to His Jewish people
become worthless when they refused to come to be saved? Of course not. For
His promises are only to those who come. Only they are truly His People. They
alone are truly Jews. So you sec, not everyone born into a Jewish family is
truly a Jew . ..
"Isaiah the prophet cried out concerning the Juws that though there would
be millions of them, only a small number would ever be saved. For the Lord
will execute His sentence upon the earth, quickly ending His dealings, justly
cutting them short. And Isaiah says in another place thct except for God s
mercy all the Jews would be destroyed —all of them —just as everyone in the
cities of Sodom and Gomorrali perished. Well then, what shall we say about

Him (Jesus). But those who believe in Him will never be disappointed." (Ro
