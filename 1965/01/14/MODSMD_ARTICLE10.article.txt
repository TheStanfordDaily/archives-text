# Impersonality Causes Cal Turmoil—Sterling
## Deplores Role Of Outside Agitators 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
"We have at our disposal me-
I chanisms and customs which
have in the past enabled us as
a University community to iden
tify issues, to lace thorn and to
resolve them, and to rio so with
j improvement, not impairment of
I our common strength and pur
pose. I suggest that we should
continue to use them and to these
: same ends."
Thus concluded University Pres
ident J. E. Wallace Sterling in his
: "State of the University Address"
yesterday before a near capacity
crowd in Memorial Auditorium.
IN THE SPEECH, sponsored by
the Stanford Today and Tomor
row committee, Sterling dealt
{mainly with the problem of "de
• personalization" facing college
'communities today, a problem
that is partially reflected in re
i cent events at Berkeley, and one
I that has "a strong potential for
j persistency into the future."
Sterling noted that the phenom
enon of 'depersonalization' was
, one of the circumstances affect -
I ing the situation at Berkeley, but
I lie also cited the "regrettable in
| trusion" of 200 or more persons
who were not members of the
: university.
I"I see in the events at Berkeley
ian element that is not concerned
| merely with free speech or with
judicial process or with person
alizing a university; this element
is one of disruption and is, in
its essence, as undemocratic as
can be."
TURNING TO Stanford, Ster
ling claimed that the issue of
j double jeopardy raised at Berke-
I ley has not been a problem here.
Although, "in legal terms," Ster
ling said he did not believe in
double jeopardy, "as President of
a university, I should wish to
consider quite seriously whether
or not to admit to a university
or to continue at a university a
person who committed a felony."
He affirmed again his own per
sonal responsibility for student
discipline, "as delegated by the
! Trustees." But he announced that
|a study of the judicial process,
begun last Spring, would soon bo
offered to the Trustees. He made
no comment as to the content of
that study.
He defended Administration po
licy in not taking action against
members of the Stanford commu
j nity who have undertaken poli
tical action "in accord with their
constitutional rights under the
First and Fourteenth Amend
; ments."
AND IN a final comparison
[with the situation at Berkeley
'prior to tlie? recent demonstra-
I lions, he noted that at Stanford
'avenues of communication, main
ly through committees, are avail
i able.
"It would be a matter of great
' regret to me. and I daresay of
] embarrassment to all of us, if on
an issue of critical importance to
I this University, several of its seg

merits found themselves neglect
ing opportunities for consultation
and in consequence taking differ
ent positions from which retreat
might be difficult."
Sterling noted many reasons
for the depersonalizing trend:
• The increasing size of insti
tutions of higher learning in re
sponse to the expected 17 per cent
increase in college enrollment by
1980.
"INCREASED size has brought
in its wake necessarily larger ad
ministrative staffs, with the re
sult that, in the eyes of faculty
and student alike, our large insti
tutions have developed a bureau
cracy which seems remote, unre
sponsive and therefore deperson
alized."

• The increase in the volume
and variety of research and sup
porting funds -"a 15-fold increase
since the Korean War alone.''
• The "Flight from Teaching"
I provoked by a loss of faculty
| members to corporation and gov
j ernment posts.
As for the depersonalization
factor here, Sterling declared that
I it is "mainly in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, with i<s
larger courses and more extensive
use of teaching assistants that un
dergraduates are prone to feel 'de
! personalized.' "
Sterling defended the TA sys
tem, noting that 225 of the 268
TA's now employed by the Uni
versity work in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.

I lie also cited the "regrettable in

who were not members of the
: university.
I"I see in the events at Berkeley
ian element that is not concerned
| merely with free speech or with
judicial process or with person
alizing a university; this element
is one of disruption and is, in
its essence, as undemocratic as
can be."
TURNING TO Stanford, Ster
ling claimed that the issue of
j double jeopardy raised at Berke-
I ley has not been a problem here.
Although, "in legal terms," Ster
ling said he did not believe in
double jeopardy, "as President of
a university, I should wish to
consider quite seriously whether
or not to admit to a university
or to continue at a university a
person who committed a felony."
He affirmed again his own per
sonal responsibility for student
discipline, "as delegated by the
! Trustees." But he announced that
|a study of the judicial process,
begun last Spring, would soon bo
offered to the Trustees. He made
no comment as to the content of
that study.
He defended Administration po
licy in not taking action against
members of the Stanford commu
j nity who have undertaken poli
tical action "in accord with their
constitutional rights under the
First and Fourteenth Amend
; ments."
AND IN a final comparison
[with the situation at Berkeley
'prior to tlie? recent demonstra-
I lions, he noted that at Stanford
'avenues of communication, main
ly through committees, are avail
i able.
"It would be a matter of great
' regret to me. and I daresay of
] embarrassment to all of us, if on
an issue of critical importance to
I this University, several of its seg

merits found themselves neglect
ing opportunities for consultation
and in consequence taking differ
ent positions from which retreat
might be difficult."
Sterling noted many reasons
for the depersonalizing trend:
• The increasing size of insti
tutions of higher learning in re
sponse to the expected 17 per cent
increase in college enrollment by
1980.
"INCREASED size has brought
in its wake necessarily larger ad
ministrative staffs, with the re
sult that, in the eyes of faculty
and student alike, our large insti
tutions have developed a bureau
cracy which seems remote, unre
sponsive and therefore deperson
alized."

• The increase in the volume
and variety of research and sup
porting funds -"a 15-fold increase
since the Korean War alone.''
• The "Flight from Teaching"
I provoked by a loss of faculty
| members to corporation and gov
j ernment posts.
As for the depersonalization
factor here, Sterling declared that
I it is "mainly in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, with i<s
larger courses and more extensive
use of teaching assistants that un
dergraduates are prone to feel 'de
! personalized.' "
Sterling defended the TA sys
tem, noting that 225 of the 268
TA's now employed by the Uni
versity work in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.


STERLING ADDRESS—Stanford President J. E. Wallace Sterling
is shown delivering his "State of the University Address" yester
day. He dealt with the events at Berkeley and with what he
called a "depersonalization" inherent in large universities.
"We have at our disposal me-
I chanisms and customs which
have in the past enabled us as
a University community to iden
tify issues, to lace thorn and to
resolve them, and to rio so with
j improvement, not impairment of
I our common strength and pur
pose. I suggest that we should
continue to use them and to these
: same ends."

the Stanford Today and Tomor

'communities today, a problem
that is partially reflected in re

I that has "a strong potential for

no comment as to the content of
that study.
He defended Administration po
licy in not taking action against
members of the Stanford commu
j nity who have undertaken poli
tical action "in accord with their
constitutional rights under the
First and Fourteenth Amend
; ments."
AND IN a final comparison
[with the situation at Berkeley
'prior to tlie? recent demonstra-
I lions, he noted that at Stanford
'avenues of communication, main
ly through committees, are avail
i able.
"It would be a matter of great
' regret to me. and I daresay of
] embarrassment to all of us, if on
an issue of critical importance to
I this University, several of its seg

merits found themselves neglect
ing opportunities for consultation
and in consequence taking differ
ent positions from which retreat
might be difficult."
Sterling noted many reasons
for the depersonalizing trend:
• The increasing size of insti
tutions of higher learning in re
sponse to the expected 17 per cent
increase in college enrollment by
1980.
"INCREASED size has brought
in its wake necessarily larger ad
ministrative staffs, with the re
sult that, in the eyes of faculty
and student alike, our large insti
tutions have developed a bureau
cracy which seems remote, unre
sponsive and therefore deperson
alized."

• The increase in the volume
and variety of research and sup
porting funds -"a 15-fold increase
since the Korean War alone.''
• The "Flight from Teaching"
I provoked by a loss of faculty
| members to corporation and gov
j ernment posts.
As for the depersonalization
factor here, Sterling declared that
I it is "mainly in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, with i<s
larger courses and more extensive
use of teaching assistants that un
dergraduates are prone to feel 'de
! personalized.' "
Sterling defended the TA sys
tem, noting that 225 of the 268
TA's now employed by the Uni
versity work in the School of Hu
manities and Sciences.
