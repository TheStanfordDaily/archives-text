# Report Finds Risk In European Jobs
## 
### 
Students should be warv of some offers to work in Europe, a
State Department report lias warned.
The department said in the report it has "received numerous
complaints about" private organizations arranging summer jobs
for American students.
As an example, the department cited the American Student

Information Service of Luxem
bourg, a private organization
founded in that country in 1961
after operating previously in Den
mark and Germany.
THE ASIS advertised its "Sum
mer Jobs In Europe" program in
The Daily on January 11.
According to the State Depart
ment, the ASIS charges its en
rollees $13.1 for a mandatory
"European Safari," a five day,
five-country tour on the continent.
The report stated the ASIS has
claimed in recent advertisements
that students participating in its
programs "can earn $300 a month
working in Europe."
ALTHOUGH many students
placed by the ASIS have been
satisfied, the department said it
"cannot recommend that Ameri
can students participate in the
ASIS program" due to the large
number of complaints.
The report emphasized that the
job-finding organization was a
private service "with no U.S.
government connections."

It also said that "any student
who intends to participate in
either" the ASIS program or that
of the International Student Tra
vel Center, another private group,
"should recognize that although
he will obtain employment, ho
will receive a very limited amount
of assistance and service for the
fee paid."
