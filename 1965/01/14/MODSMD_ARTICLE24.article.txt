# Boxers To Beat Bears Tonight
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Tonight at 8:00 in Encina Gym
the Stanford boxing team will
compete in the first varsity match
of the season against the Califor
nia Bears in what may be one of
the toughest matches of their five
game schedule. The Bears defeat
ed Stanford twice last year.
IN THE novice boxing tourna
ment last Friday which was open
to all college boxers with little or
no prior fighting experience, the
Bears lost only one match. Cal
will also bring several veteran
performers to do battle with the
Indians, including Paul Bell, Tom
Gioseffi, and Paul Rein.
Possibly the top contest of the
night will be between Stanford's
132 pound Rudy Oberzan, a two
year letterman, and Cal's Paul
8011. Last year they fought to a
highly disputed draw and both
should bo eagVr to prove their
supremacy tonight.
VETERAN Indian coach Ray
Lunny has high regard for the
fighting abilities of Bob Miller at
139. A 1 Lipman 156, and Phil
Zongker 178. who also fought to
a draw last year against his Cali
fornia opposition.
This year the Indians will only
fight at home twice with their
only other home contest against
Nevada January 30. Other com
petition this year will be Chico
State scheduled for March 6. Stan
ford will meet the Bears for the
second time on February 19.
EAST YEAR, interest in boxing
at Stanford fell to a minimum.
Not enough performers turned
out to field a full varsity team.
Consequently Stanford's boxing
activities were limited to only two
contests, both with nearby Cali
fornia.
