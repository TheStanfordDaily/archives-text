# STERLING ADDRESS
## Depersonalization At Stanford 
### 
FDITOK'S NOTE: The fol
lowing are excerpts from the
speech delivered yesterday by
President Wallace Sterling to
the Stanford Today and Tomor
row Convocation.
. . . From year to year 1 have
invited student suggestions as to
matters I might discuss at this
ST&T Convocation. . . . This year
the suggestions I have received
derive from recent events at Ber
keley and invito a discussion of
what is termed the "depersonal
ization" of the University, as well
as comment on Stanford's policies
in "areas which have created dif
ficulty at Berkeley." . . .
. . . The American student has
a wide range of choice as to where
he will seek higher education and
the level of competition he is will
ing to meet in pursuit of it. . . .
But, once the student has made
his selection, his concern is, quite
understandably, with the college
or university which he has chosen.
He is concerned with how it re
sponds to what he considers to be
his needs. If he feels strain from
the competition for grades, he
may never pause to think that he
might have selected a place of
lesser competition. If he feels that
his institution is too depersonal
ized by virtue of its size, organ
ization and disposition, he may
ignore the choice he once had to
select a smaller, more intimate
place. But these possible consid
erations of what-might-have-been
do not eliminate his concern for
how his college or university is
responding to this estimate of his
own needs and desires.
So let me turn now to this mat
ter of the "depersonalization" of
the University. . . .
(irovvth Of Enrollment
I begin with the feature of size.
Size results in large measure from
the number of students seeking
higher education. Today our na
tional college and university en
rollment is about 5,200,000, a fig
ure which is TO per cent more
than it was 15 years ago and to
day represents 43 per cent of the
college-age population (i.e., age
ltt-21). It is estimated that 15
years hence BO i>er cent of the
college-age population will he en
rolled and that the enrollment
will then be 10,200,000 —or al
most double what it is today. It is
figures like these which prompt
me to suggest that size, as a fea
ture of depersonalization, has a
strong potential for persistency
into the future. . . .
. . . Larger enrollments mean
larger faculties, more buildings,
more extensive library facilities,
parking places, dining rooms,
etc... . Increased size has brought
in its wake necessarily larger ad
ministrative staffs, with the result
that, in the eyes of faculty and
student alike, our large institu
tions have developed a bureauc
racy which seems remote, unre
sponsive and therefore deperson
alized. . . .
The Flight From Teaching
I mentioned increase in the
volume and variety of research
and the funds to support it. Let
me illustrate by a reference to
federal funds for university re
search. In 1940, the dollar figure
was 74,000,000. In 1950 —- the year
in which the Korean War began
the sum had increased almost
15-fold to 1,083,000.000. And in
1964, more than 200-fold to almost
15 billion.
That the availability of these
sums has had an impact on the
faculties of our leading univer
sities there can be no doubt. These
research funds have brought to
distinguished university profes
sors a number of things: oppor
tunity to pursue an important in
tellectual interest; status that is
associated with research grants;
brilliant graduate students who
arc attracted to the professor both
by his distinction and by the re
search grant at his disposal; con
sulting opportunities which, ac
cording to one observation, may
"add variety to his life and dol
lars to his income." (Carnegie:
••The Flight From Teaching," p.
5. » The able researcher wins a na
tional reputation and with it the
rewards which come from pro
motions and more attractive posi
tions. As compared with the able
researcher's national reputation,
the gifted teacher may not be
known very far beyond his own
college or university. . . .
Professors In Demand
Consulting opportunities are

not confined to professors with
federal research grants. They
arise in connection with industry
and with local, state and national
agencies of government, and they
sometimes produce financial re
turns which exceed tho consul
tant's professorial salary. . . .
These and other influences
have contributed to what has
been callcd "The Flight from
Teaching." And some universities
have themselves contributed to
this flight by offering distin
guished professorships which in
volve no teaching at all, or only
a little and that at the graduate
level. . . .
Increasing Teacher Shortage
The prime source of teachers
for higher education is our gradu
ate schools,and the desired de
gree crediential for such teachers
is the doctorate. In the past 10
years, during which national en
rollment has almost doubled, the
production of doctorates has in
creased by scarcely 50 per cent.
And only half of this production
of Ph.D.'s is going into teaching.
Enrollment has doubled in a
decade and the input of teachers
with doctorates has increased by
only 25 per cent. Estimates for
the next decade do not appreci
ably change these respective in
creases. . . .
The most distinguished of our
American universities thus find
themselves on the horns of an un
comfortable dilemma. They num
ber only 50 or 60 out of the 2,000
institutions. They do most of the
research and produce most of the
Ph.D.'s and in so doing make a
major contribution to our na
tional society. They are prestigi
ous and some of them have large
enrollments. They bear within
themselves, actually or poten
tially. those characteristics which
make them vulnerable at least
from the undergraduate's point
of view to the charge of being
"depersonalized." . . .
Now let us have a look at Stan
ford University. . . .
T.Vs And Depersonalization
... A comparison with Har
vard just in case you are inter
ested. The Harvard faculty in Arts
and Sciences (which at Harvard
includes Engineering) is approxi
mately 170. The comparable num
ber for Stanford is about 450. The
number of students both under
graduate and graduate taught by
these faculty members is approxi
mately 8,400 at Harvard and 8,700
at Stanford. The comparable num
ber of Teaching Assistants is: at
Harvard approximately 770; at
Stanford 260. In short, in these
fields of arts and sciences and
engineering, Stanford's student
enrollment is somewhat larger
than Harvard's and the profes
sorial faculty somewhat smaller.
In terms of student-to-faculty ra
tio the figure would be 18 at Har
vard and 19 at Stanford in these
fields. Harvard also has almost
three times as many T.A.'s as has
Stanford in these fields. From
these figures you may draw your
own conclusions. One possible con
clusion is that if ratio of students
to regular faculty in these fields
bears on "depersonalization" —
there is not much difference be
tween the two institutions. An
other is that if T.A.'s contribute
to "depersonalization," the contri
bution is greater at Harvard than
at Stanford.
The Stanford 10!"fort
We have been and arc con
cerned to have a faculty capable
of and actively engaged in re
search. We arc equally concerned
not to have a so-called "flight
from teaching" at Stanford Uni
versity. To make both teaching
and research manpower available
to students we have since 1950 re
duced the ratio of students to
faculty. We have paid more at
tention to the recruitment, pro
motion and reward of effective
teachers, and to the selection,
training, and supervision of those
teaching assistants and instruc
tors we have. We have invited de
partments to review and possibly
to revise their course offerings
for the benefit of instruction. We
have introduced new undergradu
ate programs and have more in
mind. Budgetary support for ad
ditional faculty appointments has
been withheld from some depart
ments in which existing faculty
was thought not to be applying
itself effectively to teaching and
research. We have done these and
other things and are keenly aware

that there is more yet to do -at
Stanford as at other institutions
all across the country.
It is not difficult to recognize
and to appreciate the impatience
of undergraduates, who are in col
lege for only four years, to have
improvement procee d more
rapidly, so that they can be its
beneficiaries. But if they think
they have a monopoly on such im
patience they are quite wrong.
Others, including myself, are also
impatient, and have been so for
much longer than four years. Nor
do 1 expect this kind of impa
tience, yours or mine, ever to end.
If it should, all of us would be the
losers. . . .
Opportunities Not Used
. . . We might or might not
agree that students do not take
adequate advantage of opportuni
ties that are available to them.
I have seen more than one faculty
member disappointed by the very
small number of students who
will spend time in conversation
with him during a luncheon period
or an evening in a living group.
And I have seen more than one
faculty wife, having invited and
prepared to entertain a score or
more students, disappointed when
only four or five showed up. . . .
But I have the strong impres
sion that the student sense of "de
personalization" goes beyond the
academic program of a university
and reaches into areas which are
extracurricular. So let me talk
for a few moments about these
other reaches of student inter
ests. . . .
Today's generation of students
} is said to be different regardless
' of label. More of today's students
j are said to have interest in causes
I beyond themselves and their in
| dividual careers. I suggest that
j there is evidence to support this
I appraisal. . . .
A decade or so ago, student ex
• tracurricular interest in public af
! fairs tended to find its main ex
pression in discussion of political
| issues, both national and interna-
I tional, and in organizations hav
ing to do with national party poli
tics and international affairs. . . .
Students have also had an inter
| est in the operations and policy
making procedures of the univer
sity. . . .
Concern For Underprivileged
But new dimensions have been
j added to these and other student
interests. In recent years we have
heard much about the "revolution
of rising expectations." This
phrase gained currency out of
i hope that the underprivileged of
! this world could have their condi
-1 tions improved. The United Na
; tions acquired new members
! which were frequently described
ias underdeveloped or emerging
nations. And in this country, Su-
I preme Court decisions and na
tional legislation focused new at
tention on civil rights. Students
i responded to the plight of the un
derprivileged; they responded by
action, not merely by discussion,
j Their response has taken them to
Mississippi, into the Peace Corps
and into volunteer social service
and educational work in their
own communities. . . .
Students have still other con
cerns. Some of these, such as a
university's social regulations, or
! its regulations concerning liquor,
' or its regulations concerning stu
i dent conduct — some of these
other concerns arc also being ar
ticulated, and the articulation
1 brings under review the role and
jurisdiction of the University act
ing in loco parentis. And in this
i connection a certain paradox sug
| gests itself. On the one hand stu-
I dents will argue that the univer
sity should stop acting in loco
parentis, that it should not con
! ccrn itself with their personal
1 lives and conduct; on the other
; hand, the same students will de
; plore the "depersonalization" of
| the university.
No Mere Fad At Berkeley
Colleges and universities have
long been acquainted with stu
dent fads and exuberances which
i have found expression in mara
j tlion dances, goldfish-swallowing,
I panty raids, and in seeing how
! many humans could get into a
i telephone booth. And universities
| have seen these fads bounce from
campus to campus like an epi
demic. But what has happened at
Berkeley is not a mere fad. nor
has it been altogether spontane
ous. nor is its cause to be found
completely within the university.

If occurrences such as those at I
Berkeley spread to other cam- ]
puses, the spread will not neces
sarily be haphazard like the
spread of panty raids. I see in the
events at Berkeley an element
that is not concerned merely with
free speech or with judicial proc
ess or with personalizing a uni
versity; this element is one of dis
ruption and is, in its essence, as
undemocratic as can be. I have no
way of measuring it, but I am
persuaded that it exists.
Students might ask themselves
if they have contributed in any
way to the "depersonalization" of
a university. Have their desires
and efforts to be part of the world
outside the university reduced
their desires and efforts to be part
of it? In general terms, I should
imagine thai a student who is
strongly motivated academically
would find a readier and deeper
rapport with a faculty member
than would a student who is less
strongly motivated academically,
and that in finding such rapport
would feel the university to be
more personalized. Good faculty
student relationships do, after all,
require mutuality of interests,
and students as well as faculty
must make a positive contribu
tion to this relationship. There
is also the possibility that stu
dents who have gone to Missis
sippi, or taken part in off-campus
demonstrations and sit-ins find
less applause on campus th a n
they had anticipated or felt en
titled to.
Formal Education
Each of us should remind him
self that students who use some
of their time to demonstrate, sit
in or otherwise engage in direct
action, are doing so as citizens.
There is nothing academic about
such exercises and by no stretch
of the imagination can the en
cumbering of the wall-to-wall car
pets in the Sheraton Palace Hotel
be called a part of the formal
educational process.
I have spoken at some length
about circumstances which may
affect in varying degree, at one
institution or another, this phen
omenon of "depersonalization.'.. .
Now let me turn to other cir
cumstances. The sit-ins and dem
onstrations at Berkeley involved
200 or more persons who were
ikil members of the university.
Their participation I regard as a
regrettable intrusion. Universities
strive to protect and strengthen
iheir freedom to teach, to deliber
ate. and to investigate. Any threat
of a legislative intervention in
university affairs that would en
danger or reduce that freedom
evokes an outcry of opposition
from the university community.
Any suggestion that 1 his freedom
is being endangered by acquies
cence to the wishes of donors
particularly large donors, evokes
a similar outcry. Even the threat
or rumor of such interventions as
these are regarded as improper
intrusions into the work and spirit
of a university community. Where
was such an outcry when this
other real and live intrusion
occurred at Berkeley? Perhaps
you heard it ring out loudly and
clearly. I didn't. This intrusion
was, as I see it, a contributing fac
tor quite different from any of
the circumstances which may
have contributed to "depersonal
ization." . . .
Rights At Stanford
Members of the Stanford Com
munity enjoy constitutional rights
of free speech. They enjoy also
the right of assembly. These
rights can and should be exercised
without disruption of the Univer
sity's educational program and
purpose.
The University asks only that
the organization exercising these
rights identify itself, and that it
avoid speaking officially in the
name of the University — an
j avoidance, incidentally, with
which the American Civil Liber
i ties Union concurs.
Related 1o activity in social
and political issues is the matter
of solicitation for support and the
distribution of literature. In this
j matter also members of this uni
versity community enjoy consti
i tutional rights.
But members of the University
j community also have to consider
i other types of solicitation. His
i torically, arrangements have been
made whereby si udents could earn
money by soliciting patronage for
a given laundry service, or maga
zine. These arrangements are re
garded as a useful service per
' formed by and for members of
! the community. As a rule, the uni
versity community has sought by
agreement with its members to
j protect them from harassment on
campus by other purveyors of as
i sorted wares; and a whole host of
solicitors for causes ranging from
worthy to dubious. . . .
Double Jeopardy
In recent events at Berkeley re
pealed mention has been made
of double jeopardy: thai is to say,
as I understand it. should a uni
versity punish a student for a
civil offense for which lie has
been apprehended and/or pun
ished by a court action? This is a
nice question and covers a broad
field. It has been Stanford's con
cern to keep students' names oft
police blot lei , and to achieve thi

end by understandings with neigh-1
boring police authorities whereby i
university disciplinary action
would stand in lieu of court ac
tion. We have thought that such
achievement would be preferable
for the student and would avoid
the raising of at least some ques
tions by prospective future em
ployers and associates.
In legal terms, I do not believe
in double jeopardy. And I am in
terested in the rehabilitation of
felons. But if I were the director
of a government agency, or the
chief executive officer of a cor
poration, or in charge of person
nel for a large department store,
I suspect that I should think twice
before employing an ex-felon. By
the same token, as President of
a university I should wish to con
sider quite seriously whether or
| not to admit to a university or to
j continue at a university a person
who had committed a felony.
Suppose an officer of a bank or
: of a labor union embezzled funds
l and was apprehended, convicted
i and punished for such embezzle
ment! Is it a case involving double
jeopardy if the bank or labor
union declines to re-employ th e
t convicted and punished embez
j zler? I doubt it.
Political Action
But perhaps the broad field cov
ered by the phrase "double jeop
; ardy" can be narrowed. A univer
| sity may have just cause for ex
j eluding from its membership a
; vandal, a liar, a cheat, an embez
zler, a rapist. Does it have just
I cause for excluding from its mem
bership one who has been c o n
victed in court for offenses grow
i ing out of political action? Ii is,
I suspect, in ibis narrower and
more particular context lhat the
matter of double jeopardy has
been at issue at Berkeley. At Stan
! ford disciplinary action lias not
! been laken against members of
; this community who have under
j taken political action in accord
i with their constitutional rights
under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, even though the ex
ercise of these rights may have
involved them in the possibility
or the realily of action by 1 he
i courts. . . .
At Stanford the responsibility
i for student discipline is delegated
; by Ihe Trustees to the President
I of the University. There is, I be-
I lievc, a parallel delegation of re
sponsibility at the University of
California. At Stanford this re
sponsibility is further delegated
to the Dean of Students and in
deed to the student judicial eoun-
I cils, but this further delegation
! has not relieved the President of
I his ultimate responsibility for stu
j dent discipline or of his account
! ability to the Trustees for the ex
| ercise of that responsibility. . . .
Discipline System Re-Studied
Last spring, before the recent
events at Berkeley, it was decided
here to re-study our procedures
for handling cases of student dis
cipline. This re-study was begun
in Autumn Quarter and in it par
j ticular attention has been paid to
j judicial process. The re-study is
; nearing completion, and in due
; course its results will be reported
i to the Trustees for their eonsid
j erat ion.
Now to conclude. By some com-
J bination of circumstances, not
completely clear to me, it would
appear that faulty communica
tions contributed to the troubles
i at Berkeley. Communications here
have frequently been the object
of criticism, sometimes by mem
bers of our University community
who failed 1o take advantage of
avenues of communication avail
! able to them. Here as elsewhere,
much of the day to day work of
the University is done through
committees. There are student
committees within the framework
! of student government. There are
| faculty committees, appointed
I by Ihe Executive Committee of
the faculty, on which committees
j only members of the regular fac
ulty serve. There are two faculty
committees which are elected by
' the Faculty: these are the Faculty
j Executive Committee and the Ad
visory Board with both of which
; I work closely and for whose
j counsel I have respect and grati
tude. There are committees ap
pointed by the President of the
I University, after consultation
j with the Executive Committee of
| the Faculty and in some cases
! with the president of the student
body and on several of these com
! mittees membership includes stu
dents and staff as well as faculty.
It would be a matter of great
; regret to me, and I daresay of
embarrassment to all of us, if on
j an issue of critical importance to
this University, several of its seg
ments found themselves neglect
i ing opportunities for consultation
| and in consequence taking differ
ent positions from which retreat
j might be difficult.
We have at our disposal me
' ehanisms and customs which
have in the past enabled us as
i a University community to iden*
i tify issues, to face them and to re
solve them, and to do so with
improvement, not impairment of
our common strength and pur
pose. I suggest that we should
I continue lo use them and to these
1 line ends.
