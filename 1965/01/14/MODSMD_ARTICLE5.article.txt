## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
The Graduate Ooordiating Com-!
mittee, an organization formed in j
December, initially in support of
the Berkeley Free Speech move-j
ment, last night inaugurated an i
ambitious program of campus and
social action projects.
These ranged from the estab- j

lishment of a committee to eval
uate President Wallace Sterling's
Stanford Today and Tomorrow
speech to the organization of poli
| tical forum on the Viet. Nam prob
; lem.
THE SUGGESTED schedule
| of 11 separate committees and
projects, presented to the general
| meeting last night by temporary
j chairman Ilmar Waldner, was
the outgrowth of an executive
committee discussion held last
j Sunday.
One immediate GCC concern is
the issuance of an opinion paper
on President Sterling's address to
the university given yesterday.
GCC member Tom Sherman
suggested that, the statement
| would treat in depth Sterling's
suggestion that there is a con
tradiction in student demands for
both a cessation of an in loco
parentis attitude by the admin
istration and demands for a les

sening of "depersonalization."
OTHER PROPOSED GCC proj
ects include a drive to interest
graduate students in LASSU, Ihe
encouragement of the formation
of "extra-curricular" seminars
on inter-disciplinary academic
questions, the exploration of the
possibility of unionizing teaching
assistants, and the establishment
of a Stanford chapter of Students
For a Democratic Society (SDS).
Members of the GCC expressed
interest in the possibility of pub
lishing a weekly news letter, a
quarterly journal of political
opinion and a Graduate Course
Review.
The GCC also began organiza
tion of a permanent sub-commit
tee on Academic Affairs.
