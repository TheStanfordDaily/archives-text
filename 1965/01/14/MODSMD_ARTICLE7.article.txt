# Wanted: Resident For New Building
## 
### TOM GALBRAITH 
Stanford announced .Mon
day the acquisition of a new
three - story, semi - circular
building.
However, because students
have become so accustomed
to construction noises and
sprouting buildings during
this Challenging lOra ol' Uni
versity development, few fully
realize the significance of t his
new step in university plan
ning.
Stanford ha*, surpassed it
self. In the past, a building
was designed to fulfill a spe
cific need, money was raised,
and the edifice erected. Clone
are those primitive days.
But more advanced methods
bring new problems: as we
reported Monday, "Stanford
officials are studying alterna
tive uses for the property."
No use for the building has
yet been found!
As a service to the Univer
sity, then, The Daily is mak
ing a public appeal for sug
gestions. We feel that such an
appeal has two distinct ad
vantages over traditional
channels:
1) The Daily is avidly read
l»y ten thousand students;
surely this "brain pool" can
come up with a wider range
of interesting ideas than a

handful of administrators.
2) It should permanently
silence cantankerous students
who complain the student
body' is never consulted on
the formation of University
building' plans.
A word about th c prop
erty: It's lovely, really —
this modern, three-story, C
s hap e d, 07,000 square-foot
building 1 situated in 77 acres
of beautiful rolling green
foothills. It's worth mil
lion, but Stanford got it for
only $500,000. Go out and see
it sometime.
Contest rules:
1. AH entries are to be sub
mitted in writing to THE
STANFORD DAILY.
2. Zon in g requirements
may b<* ignored, for usually
they can be changed. Sug
gest whatever you want.
3. Entries will be judged
on the basis of creativity of
thomrht. Unoriginal ideas,
such as a scientific research
center, will not be given seri
ous consideration. We have
lots of those already.
I. Winners will have their
ideas printed in The Daily,
and, if the administration
doesn't find a use for th e
structure, the grand winner
will be given it so that the
spare can be used.

appeal has two distinct ad
vantages over traditional
channels:
1) The Daily is avidly read
l»y ten thousand students;
surely this "brain pool" can
come up with a wider range
of interesting ideas than a

handful of administrators.
2) It should permanently
silence cantankerous students
who complain the student
body' is never consulted on
the formation of University
building' plans.
A word about th c prop
erty: It's lovely, really —
this modern, three-story, C
s hap e d, 07,000 square-foot
building 1 situated in 77 acres
of beautiful rolling green
foothills. It's worth mil
lion, but Stanford got it for
only $500,000. Go out and see
it sometime.
Contest rules:
1. AH entries are to be sub

STANFORD DAILY.
2. Zon in g requirements

3. Entries will be judged
on the basis of creativity of

such as a scientific research

lots of those already.
I. Winners will have their

Stanford announced .Mon
day the acquisition of a new
three - story, semi - circular
building.
However, because students
have become so accustomed
to construction noises and
sprouting buildings during
this Challenging lOra ol' Uni
versity development, few fully
realize the significance of t his
new step in university plan
ning.
Stanford ha*, surpassed it
self. In the past, a building
was designed to fulfill a spe
cific need, money was raised,
and the edifice erected. Clone
are those primitive days.
But more advanced methods
bring new problems: as we
reported Monday, "Stanford
officials are studying alterna
tive uses for the property."
No use for the building has
yet been found!
As a service to the Univer
sity, then, The Daily is mak
ing a public appeal for sug
gestions. We feel that such an
appeal has two distinct ad
vantages over traditional
channels:
1) The Daily is avidly read
l»y ten thousand students;
surely this "brain pool" can
come up with a wider range
of interesting ideas than a

handful of administrators.
2) It should permanently
