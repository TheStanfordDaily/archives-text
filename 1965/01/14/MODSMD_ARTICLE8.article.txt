I"The best contribution you can make to your nation's economy
| is to have four or five children."
Robert Housman, a Menlo Park stock broker, made the state
j ment yesterday afternoon at Trcsiddcr where he gave the first of
S four lectures on the stock market.
i Besides encouraging a population increase, lie urged the an-

"diencc to buy as much as possible.
His TALK was centered around
the history of the stock market
and its present state.
"People are in the market he
cause of inflation. Their money
grows with the economy," he said.
After giving the background of
the New York Stock Exchange
land explaining its procedures and
levels of authority, Housman de
i fined investment banking, in
I
which "people provide the ideas;
we (the brokers) provide the
money."
HOUSMAN outlined the advan
tages and disadvantages of invest
ing in the market. He showed
how money could triple in income
and double in value in some stable
stocks, while in others "it could
drop from $S2 a share to $3."
He added, "stock brokers do not
like Washington and SEC control,
but we deserved their regula
tions."
In time, lie thinks, the market
may regain its own policing
power.
