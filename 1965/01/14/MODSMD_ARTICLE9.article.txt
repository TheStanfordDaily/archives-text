### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
To tin? people who bought, last year's .Mendi
cants record: I ho new Mendicants record is out,
and it's even better.
To the profile who didn't huy last year's Men
dicants record: buy this year's.
The new record, which will go on sale Monday,
amply demonstrates why this group has, in two
years, become so popular both on and off campus.
The nineteen selections range from the Stan
ford Hymn (the only song on both albums> to
the haunting "You Are Beautiful" and the barber*
shopish "Coney Island Baby."
Tills with improvements in technical
quality over last year, features three entirely
mit'inal soiisjn: • • w> |o\v|\ J'eaiv Siiaeht IV'iinis

Pales "The Rains of April." Craig Williamson's
"Lovin' Blues" and Williamson's wild rock and
roll parody "Dump On You."
To single oul any one number as the best
would be a difficult task, for, from the opening
"1 Hear Music" to I lie linal Stanford Hymn, they
are all excellent.
But Jorge Bacardi's solo with percussive
backing on "The Girl From Ipanema." Dave
Quattrone's solo "Hlite Shadows." and "When The
World Was Young" with Larry Arend's solo aiff
particularly outstanding.
But more important than any one song, or any
one soloist, is the fact that the Mendicants, with
their 1(5 carefully blended male voices, have
achieved a uniformly high slandard and an over
all unity of sound that makes for a truly pleasant
listening experience.
