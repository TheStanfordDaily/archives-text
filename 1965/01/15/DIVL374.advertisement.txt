Good News
For all Jews, Too
These people, the Jews, are a must unusual and unique family among nations,
for they have survived thousands of years of dispersal and persecution. And yet
they have maintained an identity, culture, and religion through thick and thin. A
great measure of the success of our country can lie attributed to the Jewish people
among us who have become prominent scientists, physicians, businessmen, and
leaders. Thus, the promise God made to Abraham concerning his descendants, tin-
Jews, (nearly 4000 years ago!) has proven literally accurate and sound, even in
the present generation: "... And 1 will make of thee a great nation, and I will
bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing; and I will bless
them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee; and in thee shall all the families
of the earth be blessed" (Genesis 12:2, 3).
The flod of Israel today continues to call Jews to Himself, urging this historic
people to meet Him in a personal way through faith in the Messiah. Jesus Christ.
"Dear brothers, the longing of my heart and my prayer is that the Jewish
people might be saved. 1 know what enthusiasm you have for the honor of God,
but it is misdirected zeal. For you don't understand that Christ has died to make
you right with (rod. Instead you are trying to make yourselves good enough to gain
God's favor by keeping the Jewish laws and customs. Hut that is not God's way of
salvation. You don't understand that Christ gives to those who trust in Him every
thing you are trying to get by keeping I lis laws. For as Moses said, if a person
could be perfectly good and hold out against temptation all his life and never sin
once, only then could he be saved. But the salvation that comes through faith says,
'you don't need to search the heavens to find Christ and bring Mini down to help
you.' and 'you don't need to go among the dead to bring Christ back to life again,'
for salvation that comes from trusting Christ- which is what we preach is alreadj
within easy reach of each of us; in fact, it is as near as our own hearts and mouths.
For if you tell others with your own mouth that Jesus Christ is your Lord, and
believe in your own heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be
saved. For it is by believing in llis heart that a man becomes right with God; and
with his mouth he tells others of his faith, confirming his salvation. For the Scrip
tures tell us that no one who believes in Christ will ever be disappointed. Jew and
Gentile are the same in this respect: they all have the same Lord who generously
gives His riches to all those who ask Him for them. Anyone who calls the name of
the Lord will be saved" (Romans 10:1-13, Living Letters).
The Good News to the Jews is the same Good News to all who receive eternal
life through acknowledgment of Jesus Christ as Lord.

bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing; and I will bless
them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee; and in thee shall all the families
of the earth be blessed" (Genesis 12:2, 3).
The flod of Israel today continues to call Jews to Himself, urging this historic
people to meet Him in a personal way through faith in the Messiah. Jesus Christ.
"Dear brothers, the longing of my heart and my prayer is that the Jewish
people might be saved. 1 know what enthusiasm you have for the honor of God,
but it is misdirected zeal. For you don't understand that Christ has died to make
you right with (rod. Instead you are trying to make yourselves good enough to gain
God's favor by keeping the Jewish laws and customs. Hut that is not God's way of
salvation. You don't understand that Christ gives to those who trust in Him every
thing you are trying to get by keeping I lis laws. For as Moses said, if a person
could be perfectly good and hold out against temptation all his life and never sin
once, only then could he be saved. But the salvation that comes through faith says,
'you don't need to search the heavens to find Christ and bring Mini down to help
you.' and 'you don't need to go among the dead to bring Christ back to life again,'
for salvation that comes from trusting Christ- which is what we preach is alreadj
within easy reach of each of us; in fact, it is as near as our own hearts and mouths.
For if you tell others with your own mouth that Jesus Christ is your Lord, and
believe in your own heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be
saved. For it is by believing in llis heart that a man becomes right with God; and
with his mouth he tells others of his faith, confirming his salvation. For the Scrip
tures tell us that no one who believes in Christ will ever be disappointed. Jew and
Gentile are the same in this respect: they all have the same Lord who generously
gives His riches to all those who ask Him for them. Anyone who calls the name of
the Lord will be saved" (Romans 10:1-13, Living Letters).
The Good News to the Jews is the same Good News to all who receive eternal
life through acknowledgment of Jesus Christ as Lord.

Good News
For all Jews, Too
These people, the Jews, are a must unusual and unique family among nations,
for they have survived thousands of years of dispersal and persecution. And yet
they have maintained an identity, culture, and religion through thick and thin. A
great measure of the success of our country can lie attributed to the Jewish people
among us who have become prominent scientists, physicians, businessmen, and
leaders. Thus, the promise God made to Abraham concerning his descendants, tin-
Jews, (nearly 4000 years ago!) has proven literally accurate and sound, even in
the present generation: "... And 1 will make of thee a great nation, and I will
bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing; and I will bless
them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee; and in thee shall all the families
of the earth be blessed" (Genesis 12:2, 3).
