WASHINGTON House Republicans gave
their new leader a jolt yesterday by refusing
to elect the man he wanted as his second in

command.
Rep. Gerald R. Ford ol Michigan had laid
his fledgling leadership prestige and author
ity on the line by endorsing Rep. Peter H. B.
Frelinghuysen of New Jersey for the job of
House whip.
Instead, the GOP House members by se
cret ballot re-elected Rep. Leslie C. Arends of
Illinois, who has been party whip for 21 years.
The vote was not even very close, 70 to
59, with 11 of the 140 elected Republicans ab
sent. It was Ford's first real test as leader,
a post he won by a scant six-vote margin of
73 to G7 over Charles A. Halleck of Indiana
last week.
Ford conceded that the result "has some
implications" of undermining and weakening
his authority.
• l li.l Asks l..'i Million hi Aid
WASHINGTON President Johnson asked
Congress to authorize $3.3 billion to finance
the U.S. foreign aid program; he says more

than $500 million may be needed in Viet Nam
alone; future aid to Indonesia and Egypt left
uncertain.
The United States has been taking part in
secret combat operations carried out against
Communist supply lines running through Laos
into South Viet Nam for several months.
President Sukafno makes another concilia
tory statement on Malaysia. Indonesian leader
promises to abide by a check—even by the
United Nations on whether Sarawak and
Sabah want to remain part of Malaysia.
STATE AND LOCAL
• State Reapportionment Hill
SACRAMENTO — The first specific Sen

ate reapportionment plans were proposed yes
terday—one to enlarge the upper house and
the other to solve the problem by chopping
California into two states.
At the same time, in a 70-minute closed cau
cus, the 39 senators agreed to push California's
congressional delegation for action at the fed
eral level to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court
decision forcing reapportionment of the Cali
fornia Senate. There is one Senate vacancy.
Twenty-five state senators joined as co
authors ol' the split-the-state measures and
the main author, at least, insisted the upper
house might buy the idea. But most observers
retarded chances for legislative approval as
almost nonexistent.
Dolwig would tab the Tehaehapi Moun*
tains below Bakersfield as the frontier be
tween the as yet unnamed states. Seven coun
ties would compose the southern state, if Santa
Barbara were left out— Ventura, San Bernar
dino, Riverside, Imperial, San Diego, Orange

HOUSTON - - The Players Association of
the American Football League, in effect, gave
unanimous endorsement yesterday to a deci

the league's All-Star game in New Orleans.
Saturday's game between East and West
squads from the league was transferred to
Houston after the 21 Negroes loft New Or

some taxicab drivers and night club operators.
In a formal statement, the players associa

the league be investigated for discriminatory

"A report on the degree of such practices

WASHINGTON House Republicans gave
their new leader a jolt yesterday by refusing
to elect the man he wanted as his second in

command.
Rep. Gerald R. Ford ol Michigan had laid
his fledgling leadership prestige and author
ity on the line by endorsing Rep. Peter H. B.
Frelinghuysen of New Jersey for the job of
House whip.
Instead, the GOP House members by se
cret ballot re-elected Rep. Leslie C. Arends of
Illinois, who has been party whip for 21 years.
The vote was not even very close, 70 to
59, with 11 of the 140 elected Republicans ab
sent. It was Ford's first real test as leader,
a post he won by a scant six-vote margin of
73 to G7 over Charles A. Halleck of Indiana
last week.
Ford conceded that the result "has some
implications" of undermining and weakening
his authority.
