# Stanford Annual Fund Receives Record Gifts
## 
### 
A record total ol $510,(XX) in advance gifts to the Stanford
Annual Fund during the first quarter of the University fiscal year
was announced Tuesday by Stanford's new \nnual Fund director,
Robert E. Freelen.
\V. Noel Eldred of Portola Valley, vice-president of llewlett-

Packard Company and national
chairman of the current cam
paign, said the response to per
sonal solicitations shows "grow
ing awareness of the need for in
creased annual support of inde
pendent higher education."
THE TOTAL is the largest of
any comparable period for this
phase of regular solicitations
among Stanford alumni and par
ents. It compares with $385,000
for the period from Sept. 1
through Dec. 31, 1960.
During 1962 and 1963, the per
son-to-person solicitation of yearly
advance gifts for the Annual Fund
was discontinued, since alumni
and friends were being asked for
capital gifts to Stanford's PACE
campaign. The campaign exceeded
its $100 million goal in December
1963.
THE STANFORD Annual Fund
was initiated during the Depres
sion decade of the 1930's to gener
ate urgently needed financial
help for Stanford. Several thou
sand now contribute regularly,
through solicitations organized
by class years, in professional
schools, among parents and other
Stanford-connected groups.

Freelcn, 30, Stanford student
body prosident in 1956-57, returned
to his alma mater in April 1961
as the three-year PACE campaign
opened. Ho worked as a staff
member in the Office of Develop
ment throughout ihe campaign
and has now been named to di
rect the Annual Fund as all regu
lar support programs are resumed
and expanded.
