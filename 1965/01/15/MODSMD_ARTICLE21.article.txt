# 'Pumpkin Eater' Disappointing Film
## 
### JOHN THAYER 
"The Pumpkin Eater" is one of
! those serious art films which, in
an attempt to bo economical, be-
I come bankrupt. Or, to mix meta-
I phors, in this case the pumpkin
bursts from overripeness, having
been needlessly overstuffed with
satires, private jokes, aimless dia
logues, and annoying innuendoes.
The pot goes something like
this: Anne Bancroft, a poor but
happy veteran of two husbands
with half a dozen or so children,
marries Peter Finch, a poor but
talented film writer. Immediately
they are at odds with each other:
she thinks there's nothing better
than being continually pregnant,
and he thinks there's nothing
worse than being saddled with
a horde of children. And his sud
den financial success does nothing
to resolve the difficulty.
The audience settles back to
watch a serious investigation of
j family bondage vs. parent free
dom. Unfortunately, however, at
this point Harold Pinter (who
wrote the script) introduces the
facts of Peter's infidelities, Anne's
instability, and the peculiar banal
ity of English society.
Then Anne visits a" psychiatrist,
her father dies, she has an abor
tion-sterilization operation, she
runs off to bed with a former
husband after Peter admits hav
ing had affairs, Peter's father
dies, and she and lie are reunited,
tentatively. She has a husband
once more, but the problem still
isn't solved, in spite of the fact
that she's sterile; she still wants
[children, which makes the rest of
l what's gone on singularly point
less.
And it's really too bad, because
Anne Bancroft's performance is
excellent. In her own quiet way,
she portrays the subltest nuances
of character and emotion as if
there were nothing easier. Peter
Finch and James Mason (as a
dirty old man) do as much as
they can with such limiting roles,
but their effort is largely wasted,
for "The Pumpkin Eater" as a
whole is merely disappointing.
