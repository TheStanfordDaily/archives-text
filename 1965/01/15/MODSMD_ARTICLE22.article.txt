## Wilson, Shearing To Open Tuesday 
### RICK BALE 
If your New Year's resolution
was to get to more live jazz in

list of Bay Area jazz spots. Both
are excellent and are open to
those under 21.
Louis Armstrong led off the
jazz bookings at the Ilyatt Music
Theatre in Burlingame during

cessful 10-day run. Opening Tues
day will be Nancy Wilson and
George Shearing. They will work
both individually and together,
with the Kenny Dennis Trio fill

Shearing group is on break. The
jazz "package" will play through
the 24th, and Ella Fitzgerald
comes in the 26th with the Nelson
Riddle Orchestra, the Oscar
Peterson Trio, and the Roy El
ridge Quartet in another great
"package."
The Hotel Clarcmont in Ber
keley lias also decided to give
full time jazz a try after a few'
flirtations last year. Vince Gua
raldi and Boia Kete headline at
the L,' Horizon Room over the
weekend, to be followed by Stan
Getz, opening on February 6. The

North Beach this weekend. The
group includes Herbie Hancock
on piano, Wayne Shorter on alto
sax, Roil Carter on bass and Tony
