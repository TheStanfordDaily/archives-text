# Moopsters Hope To Topple Number One Ranked UCLA
## 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
Stanford carries an unblemished
conference record into the Los
Angeles Sports Arena this week
end and will square off against
USC and UCLA on successive
nights. The two games promise
to be the most crucial so far- for
the resurgent Indians, currently
on a five game winning streak
perhaps the most crucial of the
season.
Radio station KCBS will broad
cast the live action back to the
San Francisco area beginning at
9:00 p.m. both tonight and Satur
day.
The Bruins are currently the
number one team in the country,
a ranking they earned by winning
their iast eleven in a row after
dropping the opening to Illinois,
110-83.
STREAKS THE Indians will be
trying to break are five conse
cutive losses to the Bruins, and a
string of 21 consecutive UCLA
wins in AAWU competition, and
19 straight victories in the 1 Sports
Arena.
For the last three years, the
Indians have been runner-up in
the AAWU, and all three times
the team that has kept the In
dians from grabbing the crown
has been the Bruins. If Stanford
is to reverse the trend, its re
bounding prowess and defense
must overcome the speed and of
fensive might of the Bruins.
THE JOB is a tough one. UCLA
has five players currently averag
ing in double figures. Only two
were starters on last year's NCAA
championship team, Gail Good
rich and Keith Erickson. Both
are currently over last year's
averages. Goodrich is hitting at a
23.6 clip and Olympic volleyball
star Erickson is at 12.3.
Rounding out the five are a
1964 reserve, a soph, and a red
shirt last year. The reserve is
Kenny Washington, who stands
only 6-3, but has spring to make
up for lack of size as a forward.
Fred Goss, who started a year
ago but sat out last year, is back
and is as good as ever, averaging
14.0 points.
The sophomore is Edgar Lacey.

To break into the UCLA starting
lineup is akin to quitting of school
and becoming vice-president of a
bank. But he has the credentials.
He leads the team in rebounds
and is scoring 11.8 points per
game. As a frosh, he averaged
22.9 points while leading the team
in both scoring and rebounding.
Other stars are center Doug
Mcintosh, a top reserve last year,
especially in the latter part of tr.e
season, who is third in rebounds
and averaging 7.6 pt.s., and sopho
more Mike Lynn, his substitute.
THE INDIANS are third in the
conference in offense and second
in defense and are tops in re
bounding. In individual depart
ments, Bob Bedell is fourth in
scoring with a 20.5 average, Ray
Kosanke is sixth in field goal per
centage with .86, and both Bedell
and Kosanke rank among the top
ten rebounders in the conference.
Bedell and Kosanke, the only
two juniors on the starling five,
have come of age in recent games.
Completely recovered trom a
broken cheekbone that sidelined
him for two weeks, Bedell scored
46 points and grabbed off 20 re
bounds in the recent series
against the Washington schools.
Kosanke, who was sidelined the
better part of last season with a
lung infection, has performed
brilliantly in the last few games
on both offense and defense and
has sidelined the early season
starting center Craig Cordes.
KENT HINCKLEY carried the
scoring burden during the early
part of the season. Willi the scor
ing more distributed, his average
has fallen slightly, but he still
leads the Indian hoopsiers overall
with a 14.8 figure.
In the last few encounters with

the Bruins the Indians have kept
pace with them for mosi of the
game, only to fall behind when
the vaunted Uelan press makes
use of speed and quick paws and
the Bruins quickly jumped ahead
or when Walt Ha/zatd goi a hot
hand. Hazzard is gone but the
other hazard remains.
Despite the fact USC is 0-2 in
conference play, and 3-7 overall,
the Indians can not afford to look
beyond tonight's game. The two
conference losses were by slim
margins of two and seven points
to tough Oregon St.and < )regon
respectively.
LEADING THE Trojan attack
are Allen Young and John Block.
Young currently ranks number 10
among ail-time SC scorers and
is scoring at a 15.4 rate, but his
strongest department is rebound
ing where he has led his team
the last two years. Block and
Young are currently 1-2 in the
conference in rebounding.

scoring with a 20.5 average, Ray
Kosanke is sixth in field goal per
centage with .86, and both Bedell
and Kosanke rank among the top
ten rebounders in the conference.
Bedell and Kosanke, the only
two juniors on the starling five,
have come of age in recent games.
Completely recovered trom a
broken cheekbone that sidelined
him for two weeks, Bedell scored
46 points and grabbed off 20 re
bounds in the recent series
against the Washington schools.
Kosanke, who was sidelined the
better part of last season with a
lung infection, has performed
brilliantly in the last few games
on both offense and defense and
has sidelined the early season
starting center Craig Cordes.
KENT HINCKLEY carried the
scoring burden during the early
part of the season. Willi the scor
ing more distributed, his average
has fallen slightly, but he still
leads the Indian hoopsiers overall
with a 14.8 figure.
In the last few encounters with

the Bruins the Indians have kept
pace with them for mosi of the
game, only to fall behind when
the vaunted Uelan press makes
use of speed and quick paws and
the Bruins quickly jumped ahead
or when Walt Ha/zatd goi a hot
hand. Hazzard is gone but the
other hazard remains.
Despite the fact USC is 0-2 in
conference play, and 3-7 overall,
the Indians can not afford to look
beyond tonight's game. The two
conference losses were by slim
margins of two and seven points
to tough Oregon St.and < )regon
respectively.
LEADING THE Trojan attack
are Allen Young and John Block.
Young currently ranks number 10
among ail-time SC scorers and
is scoring at a 15.4 rate, but his
strongest department is rebound
ing where he has led his team
the last two years. Block and
Young are currently 1-2 in the
conference in rebounding.


UCLA'S FRED GOSS
Stanford carries an unblemished
conference record into the Los
Angeles Sports Arena this week
end and will square off against
USC and UCLA on successive
nights. The two games promise
to be the most crucial so far- for
the resurgent Indians, currently
on a five game winning streak
perhaps the most crucial of the
season.
Radio station KCBS will broad
cast the live action back to the
San Francisco area beginning at
9:00 p.m. both tonight and Satur
day.
The Bruins are currently the
number one team in the country,
a ranking they earned by winning
their iast eleven in a row after
dropping the opening to Illinois,
110-83.
STREAKS THE Indians will be
trying to break are five conse
cutive losses to the Bruins, and a
string of 21 consecutive UCLA
wins in AAWU competition, and
19 straight victories in the 1 Sports
Arena.
For the last three years, the
Indians have been runner-up in
the AAWU, and all three times
the team that has kept the In
dians from grabbing the crown
has been the Bruins. If Stanford
is to reverse the trend, its re
bounding prowess and defense
must overcome the speed and of
fensive might of the Bruins.
THE JOB is a tough one. UCLA
has five players currently averag
ing in double figures. Only two
were starters on last year's NCAA
championship team, Gail Good
rich and Keith Erickson. Both
are currently over last year's
averages. Goodrich is hitting at a
23.6 clip and Olympic volleyball
star Erickson is at 12.3.
Rounding out the five are a
1964 reserve, a soph, and a red
shirt last year. The reserve is
Kenny Washington, who stands
only 6-3, but has spring to make
up for lack of size as a forward.
Fred Goss, who started a year
ago but sat out last year, is back
and is as good as ever, averaging
14.0 points.
The sophomore is Edgar Lacey.

To break into the UCLA starting
lineup is akin to quitting of school
and becoming vice-president of a
bank. But he has the credentials.
He leads the team in rebounds
and is scoring 11.8 points per
game. As a frosh, he averaged
22.9 points while leading the team
in both scoring and rebounding.
Other stars are center Doug
Mcintosh, a top reserve last year,
especially in the latter part of tr.e
season, who is third in rebounds
and averaging 7.6 pt.s., and sopho
more Mike Lynn, his substitute.
THE INDIANS are third in the
conference in offense and second

19 straight victories in the 1 Sports
Arena.
For the last three years, the
Indians have been runner-up in
the AAWU, and all three times
the team that has kept the In
dians from grabbing the crown
has been the Bruins. If Stanford
is to reverse the trend, its re
bounding prowess and defense
must overcome the speed and of
fensive might of the Bruins.
THE JOB is a tough one. UCLA
has five players currently averag
ing in double figures. Only two
were starters on last year's NCAA
championship team, Gail Good
rich and Keith Erickson. Both
are currently over last year's
averages. Goodrich is hitting at a
23.6 clip and Olympic volleyball
star Erickson is at 12.3.
Rounding out the five are a
1964 reserve, a soph, and a red
shirt last year. The reserve is
Kenny Washington, who stands
only 6-3, but has spring to make
up for lack of size as a forward.
Fred Goss, who started a year
ago but sat out last year, is back
and is as good as ever, averaging
14.0 points.
The sophomore is Edgar Lacey.

To break into the UCLA starting
lineup is akin to quitting of school
and becoming vice-president of a
bank. But he has the credentials.
He leads the team in rebounds
and is scoring 11.8 points per
game. As a frosh, he averaged
22.9 points while leading the team
in both scoring and rebounding.
Other stars are center Doug
Mcintosh, a top reserve last year,
especially in the latter part of tr.e
season, who is third in rebounds
and averaging 7.6 pt.s., and sopho
more Mike Lynn, his substitute.
THE INDIANS are third in the
conference in offense and second
in defense and are tops in re
bounding. In individual depart
ments, Bob Bedell is fourth in
scoring with a 20.5 average, Ray
Kosanke is sixth in field goal per
centage with .86, and both Bedell
and Kosanke rank among the top
ten rebounders in the conference.
Bedell and Kosanke, the only
two juniors on the starling five,
have come of age in recent games.
Completely recovered trom a
broken cheekbone that sidelined
him for two weeks, Bedell scored
46 points and grabbed off 20 re
bounds in the recent series
against the Washington schools.
Kosanke, who was sidelined the
better part of last season with a
lung infection, has performed
brilliantly in the last few games
on both offense and defense and
has sidelined the early season
starting center Craig Cordes.
KENT HINCKLEY carried the
scoring burden during the early
part of the season. Willi the scor
ing more distributed, his average
has fallen slightly, but he still
leads the Indian hoopsiers overall
with a 14.8 figure.
In the last few encounters with

the Bruins the Indians have kept
pace with them for mosi of the
game, only to fall behind when
the vaunted Uelan press makes
use of speed and quick paws and
the Bruins quickly jumped ahead
or when Walt Ha/zatd goi a hot
hand. Hazzard is gone but the
other hazard remains.
Despite the fact USC is 0-2 in
conference play, and 3-7 overall,
the Indians can not afford to look
beyond tonight's game. The two
conference losses were by slim
margins of two and seven points
to tough Oregon St.and < )regon
respectively.
LEADING THE Trojan attack
are Allen Young and John Block.
Young currently ranks number 10
among ail-time SC scorers and
is scoring at a 15.4 rate, but his
strongest department is rebound
ing where he has led his team
the last two years. Block and
Young are currently 1-2 in the
conference in rebounding.

Stanford carries an unblemished
conference record into the Los
Angeles Sports Arena this week
end and will square off against
USC and UCLA on successive
nights. The two games promise
to be the most crucial so far- for
the resurgent Indians, currently
on a five game winning streak
perhaps the most crucial of the
season.
Radio station KCBS will broad
cast the live action back to the
San Francisco area beginning at
9:00 p.m. both tonight and Satur
day.
The Bruins are currently the
number one team in the country,
a ranking they earned by winning
their iast eleven in a row after
dropping the opening to Illinois,
110-83.
STREAKS THE Indians will be
trying to break are five conse
cutive losses to the Bruins, and a
string of 21 consecutive UCLA
wins in AAWU competition, and
19 straight victories in the 1 Sports
Arena.
