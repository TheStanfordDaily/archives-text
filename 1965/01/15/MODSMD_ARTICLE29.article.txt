## 
### JACK GASKILL 
Stanford's varsity wrestlers will
host San Jose State and Oregon
College in a triangular meet Sat
urday at 1:30 p.m. in Encina Gym.
Two mats will be used simultane
ously during the meet and each
competitor will wrestle two
matches.
SAN JOSE STATE has a strong
team and should provide the stiff
est competition for the Indians.
In the San Jose Tournament held
in December, the hosts won three
individual championships an d
two runner-up spots in capturing
the tournament with 57 points.
Stanford finished seventh in
that tournament with 32 points
and had one champion, Heavy
weight Bruce Wilhelm.
STANFORD should give the
Spartans a good battle, however,
if they continue the momentum
gained by Tuesday night's 19-10
victory over San Francisco State.
San Francisco had placed fourth
in the San Jose Tournament with
40 points.
