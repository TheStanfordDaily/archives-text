# SJS Stuntmen Trip Indians
## 
### 
The personnel-poor Stanford
varsity fell before the San Jose
State Spartans Wednesday night,
68-53. The Indians spotted San
Jose an eighteen-point lead after
the first three events and could
not gain them back. Stanford
could fill only three of the seven
events with the allowed three con
testants.
ALL-AROUND competitor Rich
Chow sparkled for the Spartans,
compiling a 46.80 total in the six
events. Bright spots for the Tribe
were Bill Rusher on the long
horse (8.43> and Jon Harrison on
the rings with an 8.6 score. This
is Harrison's first year of gym
nastics competition.
Champion ship perf or ma n ces
were turned in by several mem
bers of the Stanford Gymnastics
Club, which also competed in the
meet. The Clubmen took first and
second in the sidehorse, as former
NCAA champion Russ Mills and
former NCAA runner-up Bill
Lawler scored 9.60 and 9.10, re
spectively. Former AAU trampo
line champion Tom Osterland
won the trampoline with a score
of 8.83.
