# The 						Sterling Address
## 
### 
President Sterling's S.T.&T. Convocation ad
dress was, by all standards, an informative, can
did and well-delivered survey of a wide range
of problems facing the modern university.
Perhaps more so than many past convocation
addresses, this year's was directly and crucially
relevant to several of the major concerns of many
students today: problems of freedom of political
activity, double jeopardy, growth of the univer
sity, quality of teaching, and student activism in
relation to both off-campus issues and campus
reform.
We can find little fault with the President's
views on these topics, and we think the large
majority of students were well satisfied, many
pleasantly surprised.
()i course, some students on campus, especi
al!) the more activist element, are highly critical
of the address, and not entirely without reason.
A letter in The Daily printed last week de
manded that President Sterling explain further
his "philosophy of education of having no phil
osophy of education," that he elaborate on ex
actly what the principles are that guide the pol
cies of this university. This he did not do.
Others are unhappy, and rightly so. with his
speculation that some "depersonalization arises
when "students who have gone to Mississippi
. . . find less applause on campus than they had
anticipated or felt entitled to." This is certainly
an unfortunate inference- about the motives of
student activists.
Particularly disturbing, we think, was the
President's presentation of this paradox: "On
the one hand students will argue that the univer
sity should stop acting in loco parentis, that it
should not concern itself with their personal
lives and conduct; on the other hand, the same
student will deplore the 'depersonalization' of
the university.

This paradox is a good debater's point, per
haps, but it exhibits ail alarming failure to un
derstand the substance of the "in loco parentis
controversy. In no sense do rules regulating stu
dents' lives and conduct contribute to a "per
sonalization" of the university; if anything, such
restrictions only contribute to a feeling of de
personalization, especially when they appear to
be unreasonable, without appeal, and, by the
nature of the committee system and university
bureaucracy, difficult to change.
When students object to these rules, they are
not threatening further "depersonalization'' of
the university, but less useless and insulting regu
lation. And when they object to "depersonaliza
tion,' they are not advocating more rules, but
more direct personal contact with faculty and
administrators.
But in general the address revealed a sur
prising understanding of "today's generation'
and the aims of student activists, an understand
ing which should be a source of hope to student
leaders about the future of student government
and student rights.
The Presidents emphasis on the available
means for student reformers to make their de
sires known and to have tangible effect oil uni
versity policy, and Ims abhorrence of the kind of
outside interference as well as lack ol communi
cation that existed at Berkeley, indicate a real
concern that the student segment of the univer
sity community not be alienated.
His discussion of the steps the university is
taking and will continue to take to meet the
threat of the "flight from teaching" and rapid
grow th indicates that "depersonalization" at Stan
ford is a recognized problem and that efforts
are being made to alleviate it.
President Sterling's address was a welcome
reassurance about the state of the University.
