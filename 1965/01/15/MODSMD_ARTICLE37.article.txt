# STUDENT FREEDOM
## Political Rules Need Change: Who Has The Real Power? 
### BILL BERKOWITZ 
(Fourth of a Series)
"Students should be free to engage in any ac
tivity on campus that does not violate law, in
fringe upon the rights of others, invoke the name
of the university, or interfere with its educational
function. They should enjoy tho same rights with
in the university as they do as citizens outside of
it."
Guarded as this statement is, it does not apply
in full to Stanford students. Besides the admin
istration's theoretical power of unappealable inter
vention. there are the real restrictions described
in precious articles. Ironically, on the face of it,
some of those regulations were created and are
administered by students.
The Cost Of Regulations
Regulations may prevent one person or group
from exploiting another, but every regulation has
a cost. The cost of regulations against expression
and peaceful action are a blocking of individual
fulfillment and a weakening of the foundations
of a democratic society. Stanford should be a com
munity of intelligent, open, and morally sensitive
people, who have less need to protect themselves
from each other. The university should conse
quently be able to afford fewer regulations than
those of its surroundings.
With this in mind, I can suggest several cor
rective steps that should be taken to ensure eon
tinued and unrestricted freedom within the law
on this campus:
1. The Committee on Student Affairs and Ser
vices should have written policy that registration
of voluntary organizations whose purposes are
within (lie law may not be denied on grounds of
consent.
Free Political Activity
2. In specified areas of the campus to.g., White
Plaza i, student organizations should at all times
be free, without prior permissions or other con
ditions, to:
A. Distribute free or sell any type of literature
or organizationally-related material of any legal
quality in any quantity.
B. Solicit funds for any legal cause.
3. All student approvals for outside speakers
should be eliminated. The Committee on Public
Exercises should function as the single schedul
ing body, li should possess an advisory function,
hill not the power to regulate the appearance of
speakers beyond legality of content.
I. The time limit for notifying the committee
of a planned program should be minimal and flex
ible. with possible waiver in cases of issues of
immediate and dramatic import.
.i. Expenses for student police and public ad
dress systems should not be charged to the spon
soring organization.
6. Deposit of money with the Student Organi
zations Fund should bo made optional. Participat
ing organizations should have immediate and un
impeded :ieeeÂ«s to their funds. Non-participatinr

organizations should be responsible for any deficits
they incur.
7. Adjudication of violations should be con
ducted by a panel of students and professors in
equal numbers (something like this may emerge
from Dean Wert's committee reviewing the pres
ent judicial structure).
8. These and other conditions governing politi
cal activity on campus should be published in a
single pamphlet to be made generally available.
Proposals Not Radical
These proposals are not radical. They are con
sistent with President Sterling's remark Wednes
day. They hardly go beyond Chancellor Meyerson's
interim regulations on political action on the Ber
keley campus. They have been in part advocated
by LASSU, in its support of the UC student gov
ernment;' by the Young Democrats, Socialist, and
Peace Caucuses; with respect to solicitations by
Dean Wert and other high administrators; and
implicitly by the editor of this paper.
Nor are there apparent reasons why these
changes could not be made, and soon. LASSU
could pass these proposals; a sub-committee is
now forming to study them. Alternatively, stu
dents might resort to a neglected but extremely
potent section of (he ASSU constitution the
in it iative.
Article V, Section 2 states: "The student body
shall have power to initiate any act within the
power of the Student Legislature, provided that
five per cent of the qualified voters shall sign a
petition calling for an election on a bill which they
shall submit in writing with the petition to the
President of the Association."
Now, what acts are within the power of the
student legislature? Article 111, Section .3, Para
graph K reads: "To make all laws necessary and
proper to promote the general welfare of the stu
dent body."
And Paragraph O: "To interpret the Funda
mental Standard, this Constitution, and its By-
Laws."
Who Has Real Power?
It is therefore undeniable that student govern
ment, or in its stead the students themselves, has
the eonstitulonal power to decide in full how stu
dents will live, act, and study at (lie university.
To the extent that these powers are abrogated,
the constitution is a sham, and should be recog
nized as such. But it is also undeniable that the
trustees, the President, and the deans have the
very same power. Who, then, has the real power?
Think before answering.
And now a larger issue surfaces. One who
seeks change may accept the present system, pres
sure LASSU to do what he wants done, and hope
that (lie administration thinks the change trivial
enough not to intervene. Or one can cut to the
heart, challenging the right of the administration
to intervene in the first place. He who would take
this bold step would have a somewhat different
conception of Ihe ideal universih
