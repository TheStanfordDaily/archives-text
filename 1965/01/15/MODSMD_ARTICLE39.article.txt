## New Rationale Appearing For Old Inaction, Retreat 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
When the clock struck twelve on New Year's Eve, we were all
of us (and here is the last non-controversial statement i shall make
this year) one year older; and one year worldlier, ii indeed we
grow with experience. W'orldliness sinvests the necessity to live
and let live, and 1964 mav well he the year w hen the United States

I began more or less officially to
refashion her foreign policy back
in the direction of a worldly lais
sez-faire.
In his celebrated speech last
spring, Senator William Fulbright
reminded Americans that "insofar
as a nation is content to practice
its doctrines within its own fron
, tiers, that nation, however repug
-1 nant its ideology, is one with
I which we have no proper quar
rel."
Fulbright Isolationism
Senator Fulbright's statement
is four-square against the exuber
ant Wilsonian idealism embodied
; in the exhortation that we go out
into the world and make it safe
for democracy. Fulbright's nar-
I rower point, however, was to urge
; us to leave Cuba alone, for the
! reasons he has so often repeated,
namely, that Cuba doesn't repre
| sent a threat to this nation and
that therefore we have no proper
i business interfering with it.
And then towards the end of
the year, Mr. Walter Lippmann
was unambiguously urging a
jwithdrawal by t he United States
I from Southeast Asia on grounds
I that sound nostaligc echoes in
| the heart of the old American
j who cherished his emancipation
from the factions and vendettas
| of the old country, and of all
those foreign places his family
: for centuries had been conscripted
I to fight in: on the grounds that
j we don't have any business way
| out there in Asia, that our con
cern is with our own hemisphere
land with Europe. "If it is said
that this is isolationism," says
Mr. Lippmann defiantly, "I would
i say yes."
Vietnam And The Congo
Senator Frank Church mean
while did Walter Lippmann one
better by insisting that we should
! never have got into Southeast
i Asia in ihc first place. And we
hear voices telling us the same
i thing concerning the Congo the
. solution to the mess in the Congo,
J says the New York Times, must
be a Congolese solution, not a
Western solution. . . .
If IDHS will usher in a new
worldliness whose effect is to di
minish America's appetite for re
modeling all countries according
to the latest paradigm of the
Americans for Democratic Action,
such worldliness is welcome. But
those who are skeptical of t he
evenhandedness w i th w hi c h
. Messrs. Fulbright, Lippmann,
I Church, and the editorial writers
j of the New York Times apply
their policies, will wonder whether
or not we are simply engaged,
once again, in justifying our
j quailing will in the glare of the
j hard face of the enemy.
Rationale For Inaction
If we are going to continue to
j permit the enslavement of Cuba
! by a foreign power highly or
ganized to make war against the
United States, then we had bet
ter come up with some justifica
tion of our inactivity, some justi
, fication for the repeal of the Mon
i roe Doctrine and here is Sena
! tor Fulbright, a Rhodes scholar no
less, to supply us with the ra
tionale for doing nothing.
Twelve thousand miles away, in
i South Vietnam, we have reached
a stalemate of the kind that fa
vors the enemy, because it can
only bo a matter of time before
that stalemate so infects the body
j politic as to make civil order im
possible. We need a justification
for the approaching withdrawal;
and Walter Lippmann and Frank
Church, knowing that offense is
the best defense, tell us not only
llh.il we should get out but that

we should never have been there
in the first place; that our true
concerns are much nearer to
home. How near? Ninety miles
away from home? Ask not what
Walter Lippmann will do for
Cuba lie will do nothing at all.
New York Times' About Face
Interesting, that the New York
Times should come out so
strongly for an all-Congolese solu
tion to the problem of the Congo
-at a time when the rebel gov
ernment of the Congo is receiv
ing massive shipments of arms
and ammunition from the neutral
ist, West-hating African neo
states (whose delivery into state
hood we drunkenly mid-wifed),
arms and ammunition that origi
nate in factories behind the Iron
Curtain. Why were we not for an
"All Congolese solution" a couple
of years, ago when, instead, we
dispatched a United Nations army
to interfere with said all-Congo
lese solution?
I fear that the worldliness that
is upon us is less a reconciliation
of national policy and reality, a
healthy skepticism about univer
salis! crusades of tho kind Wood
row Wilson botched the world up
with, than a high-sounding, con
servative-appealing line of justifi
cation for our relentless retreat,
everywhere in the world, from
the enemy. The tombstone of the
West will be more talkative even
than the verbose pyramids of the
Pharaohs.

When the clock struck twelve on New Year's Eve, we were all
of us (and here is the last non-controversial statement i shall make
this year) one year older; and one year worldlier, ii indeed we
grow with experience. W'orldliness sinvests the necessity to live
and let live, and 1964 mav well he the year w hen the United States

I began more or less officially to
refashion her foreign policy back
in the direction of a worldly lais
sez-faire.
In his celebrated speech last
spring, Senator William Fulbright
reminded Americans that "insofar
as a nation is content to practice
its doctrines within its own fron
, tiers, that nation, however repug
-1 nant its ideology, is one with
I which we have no proper quar
rel."
Fulbright Isolationism
Senator Fulbright's statement
is four-square against the exuber
ant Wilsonian idealism embodied
; in the exhortation that we go out
into the world and make it safe
for democracy. Fulbright's nar-
I rower point, however, was to urge
; us to leave Cuba alone, for the
! reasons he has so often repeated,
namely, that Cuba doesn't repre
| sent a threat to this nation and
that therefore we have no proper
i business interfering with it.
And then towards the end of
the year, Mr. Walter Lippmann
was unambiguously urging a
jwithdrawal by t he United States
I from Southeast Asia on grounds
I that sound nostaligc echoes in
| the heart of the old American
j who cherished his emancipation
from the factions and vendettas
| of the old country, and of all
those foreign places his family
: for centuries had been conscripted
I to fight in: on the grounds that
j we don't have any business way
| out there in Asia, that our con
cern is with our own hemisphere
land with Europe. "If it is said
that this is isolationism," says
Mr. Lippmann defiantly, "I would
i say yes."
Vietnam And The Congo
Senator Frank Church mean
while did Walter Lippmann one
better by insisting that we should
! never have got into Southeast
i Asia in ihc first place. And we
hear voices telling us the same
i thing concerning the Congo the
. solution to the mess in the Congo,
J says the New York Times, must
be a Congolese solution, not a
Western solution. . . .
If IDHS will usher in a new
worldliness whose effect is to di
minish America's appetite for re
modeling all countries according
to the latest paradigm of the
Americans for Democratic Action,
such worldliness is welcome. But
those who are skeptical of t he
evenhandedness w i th w hi c h
. Messrs. Fulbright, Lippmann,
I Church, and the editorial writers
j of the New York Times apply
their policies, will wonder whether
or not we are simply engaged,
once again, in justifying our
j quailing will in the glare of the
j hard face of the enemy.
Rationale For Inaction
If we are going to continue to
j permit the enslavement of Cuba
! by a foreign power highly or
ganized to make war against the
United States, then we had bet
ter come up with some justifica
tion of our inactivity, some justi
, fication for the repeal of the Mon
i roe Doctrine and here is Sena
! tor Fulbright, a Rhodes scholar no
less, to supply us with the ra
tionale for doing nothing.
Twelve thousand miles away, in
i South Vietnam, we have reached
a stalemate of the kind that fa
vors the enemy, because it can
only bo a matter of time before
that stalemate so infects the body
j politic as to make civil order im
possible. We need a justification
for the approaching withdrawal;
and Walter Lippmann and Frank
Church, knowing that offense is
the best defense, tell us not only
llh.il we should get out but that

we should never have been there
in the first place; that our true
concerns are much nearer to
home. How near? Ninety miles
away from home? Ask not what
Walter Lippmann will do for
Cuba lie will do nothing at all.
New York Times' About Face
Interesting, that the New York
Times should come out so
strongly for an all-Congolese solu
tion to the problem of the Congo
-at a time when the rebel gov
ernment of the Congo is receiv
ing massive shipments of arms
and ammunition from the neutral
ist, West-hating African neo
states (whose delivery into state
hood we drunkenly mid-wifed),
arms and ammunition that origi
nate in factories behind the Iron
Curtain. Why were we not for an
"All Congolese solution" a couple
of years, ago when, instead, we
dispatched a United Nations army
to interfere with said all-Congo
lese solution?
I fear that the worldliness that
is upon us is less a reconciliation
of national policy and reality, a
healthy skepticism about univer
salis! crusades of tho kind Wood
row Wilson botched the world up
with, than a high-sounding, con
servative-appealing line of justifi
cation for our relentless retreat,
everywhere in the world, from
the enemy. The tombstone of the
West will be more talkative even
than the verbose pyramids of the
Pharaohs.

When the clock struck twelve on New Year's Eve, we were all
of us (and here is the last non-controversial statement i shall make
this year) one year older; and one year worldlier, ii indeed we
grow with experience. W'orldliness sinvests the necessity to live
and let live, and 1964 mav well he the year w hen the United States

I began more or less officially to
refashion her foreign policy back
in the direction of a worldly lais
sez-faire.
In his celebrated speech last
spring, Senator William Fulbright
reminded Americans that "insofar
as a nation is content to practice
its doctrines within its own fron
, tiers, that nation, however repug
-1 nant its ideology, is one with
I which we have no proper quar
rel."
Fulbright Isolationism
Senator Fulbright's statement
is four-square against the exuber
ant Wilsonian idealism embodied
; in the exhortation that we go out
into the world and make it safe
for democracy. Fulbright's nar-
I rower point, however, was to urge
; us to leave Cuba alone, for the
! reasons he has so often repeated,
namely, that Cuba doesn't repre
| sent a threat to this nation and
that therefore we have no proper
i business interfering with it.
And then towards the end of
the year, Mr. Walter Lippmann
was unambiguously urging a
jwithdrawal by t he United States
I from Southeast Asia on grounds
I that sound nostaligc echoes in
| the heart of the old American
j who cherished his emancipation
from the factions and vendettas
| of the old country, and of all
those foreign places his family
: for centuries had been conscripted
I to fight in: on the grounds that
j we don't have any business way
| out there in Asia, that our con
cern is with our own hemisphere
land with Europe. "If it is said
that this is isolationism," says
Mr. Lippmann defiantly, "I would
i say yes."
Vietnam And The Congo
Senator Frank Church mean
while did Walter Lippmann one
better by insisting that we should
! never have got into Southeast
i Asia in ihc first place. And we
hear voices telling us the same
i thing concerning the Congo the
. solution to the mess in the Congo,
J says the New York Times, must
be a Congolese solution, not a
Western solution. . . .
If IDHS will usher in a new
worldliness whose effect is to di
minish America's appetite for re
modeling all countries according
to the latest paradigm of the
Americans for Democratic Action,
such worldliness is welcome. But
those who are skeptical of t he
evenhandedness w i th w hi c h
. Messrs. Fulbright, Lippmann,
I Church, and the editorial writers
j of the New York Times apply
their policies, will wonder whether
or not we are simply engaged,
once again, in justifying our
j quailing will in the glare of the
j hard face of the enemy.
Rationale For Inaction
If we are going to continue to
j permit the enslavement of Cuba
! by a foreign power highly or
ganized to make war against the
United States, then we had bet
ter come up with some justifica
tion of our inactivity, some justi
, fication for the repeal of the Mon
i roe Doctrine and here is Sena
! tor Fulbright, a Rhodes scholar no
less, to supply us with the ra
tionale for doing nothing.
Twelve thousand miles away, in
i South Vietnam, we have reached
a stalemate of the kind that fa
vors the enemy, because it can
only bo a matter of time before
that stalemate so infects the body
j politic as to make civil order im
possible. We need a justification
for the approaching withdrawal;
and Walter Lippmann and Frank
Church, knowing that offense is
the best defense, tell us not only
llh.il we should get out but that

we should never have been there
in the first place; that our true
concerns are much nearer to
home. How near? Ninety miles
away from home? Ask not what
Walter Lippmann will do for
Cuba lie will do nothing at all.
New York Times' About Face
Interesting, that the New York
Times should come out so
strongly for an all-Congolese solu
tion to the problem of the Congo
-at a time when the rebel gov
ernment of the Congo is receiv
ing massive shipments of arms
and ammunition from the neutral
ist, West-hating African neo
states (whose delivery into state
hood we drunkenly mid-wifed),
arms and ammunition that origi
nate in factories behind the Iron
Curtain. Why were we not for an
"All Congolese solution" a couple
of years, ago when, instead, we
dispatched a United Nations army
to interfere with said all-Congo
lese solution?
I fear that the worldliness that
is upon us is less a reconciliation
of national policy and reality, a
healthy skepticism about univer
salis! crusades of tho kind Wood
row Wilson botched the world up
with, than a high-sounding, con
servative-appealing line of justifi
cation for our relentless retreat,
everywhere in the world, from
the enemy. The tombstone of the
West will be more talkative even
than the verbose pyramids of the
Pharaohs.
