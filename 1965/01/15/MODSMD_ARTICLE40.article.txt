## '66 Gubernatorial Race: GOP Control In Balance 
### John E. Bonine 
Such is the intense competition in our party system that results
of the last round of elections had scarcely been tallied w hen all
eyes w ere turned to 1966.
Already, the jockeying for position lias begun for the California
gubernatorial race, and some interesting new faces are among the

! hopefuls - — a former mayor, an-*
other movie actor, an upstart
i Congressman, a political boss.
The Democrats may well have
no decision about which to worry
themselves if Pat Brown decides
I to run again. President Johnson
I evidently has decided against off
ering him a cabinet post, which
I leaves him with nowhere to go but
back to Sacramento.
Possible Brown Opponents
"Big Daddy" Unruh would like J
to see Brown step aside and give
him a shot at the governorship
(it is said that Unruh even has
i Presidential ambitions! ), but so
would Jimmy Roosevelt, who has
' declared his candidacy for mayor :
of Los Angeles against incumbent
Democrat maverick Sam Yorty.
The Republicans are far from
disspirited after the November
fracas. In the 1964 contests the
GOP held onto its strength in the j
state senate (which enables the
party to block Democrat bills re
j quiring a two-thirds vote, includ-j
' ing the budget>, picked up three
seats in the state assembly, and
preserved its proportion of th e
state's Congressional delegation,
not to mention electing George
. Murphy to the U.S. Senate.
Republican stale chairman Dr.
. Gaylord Parkinson is pursuing a
plan whereby he hopes to win
control of the state assembly by
no later than 1969. In addition,
the decision of the Supreme Court
in Reynolds v. Sims will give
extra state senate seats to popu- j
lous Los Angeles and Orange i
counties. Even Gov. Brown con- !
cedes these will be Republican
seats.
Democrats Worried
Add to all this the tremendously j
increased volunteer force created !
J by the Goldwater campaign and!
you can .see why the Democrats;
are worried about holding the <
! statehouse in 1966.
Ronald Reagan, co-chairman of
California Citizens for Goldwater-
Miller, is being touted by many
I conservative Republicans for the
j gubernatorial race. He is consid
j ering the proposal and is known
' to be quite interested in the con
! servative cause.
George Christopher, former
mayor of San Francisco, has said
he will announce by June his in
tentions. Ho has had a paid staff'
working on the campaign for
I several months..
Senator Thomas Kuchel ha s
assumed a major role in the fight
for liberal control of the party
and the important question now
seems to be whether he will him
self run for the nomination in
1966 or whether he will lot Chris
topher carry the liberal colors
1 into the fray.

K lie he I And 'Extremism'
In any case, it is certain that
"extremism" will again be made
an issue. This has been a pro
requisite to any Kuchel endorse
ment lor the past few campaigns.
Nixon paid the price in 19(52;
Rockefeller paid it in 1964, as each
blasted "rightists" in the primar
ies. George Murphy refused to
do so this year, and was rewarded
with a deafening silence from his
i follow Republican.
On the conservative side, both
Joseph Shell (who ran in 1962
against Nixon) and Max Raflerty
(state superintendent of educa
tion) must bo considered as at
least seconds in case Reagan
should not run. Conservatives are
; backing both of them.
Reagan would provide a new
image. He is a dynamic speaker
and his nationwide telecast dur
ing the recent campaign has been
widely hailed as the most effec
tive political program in twelve
years. He enjoys the advantage of
! wide exposure through his acting
and television career (which in
cluded narrating the Rose Bowl
Parade again this year).
Close (i Ol* Knee
i
The Republican contest would
probably ho close. Goldwater's
| victory over Rockefeller was nar-
I row, but it did prove that teams
of volunteer workers could whip
•the pros.
The conservatives now have
both their considerable strength
at the grassroots of California
l Republicanism (including all ma
! jor GOP volunteer groups, such
; as the Young Republicans, United
Republicans, and Republican As
sembly), and a U.S. Senator to
match Kuchel.
The 1966 primary could be the
| last hope for the liberals in their
fight to win control of the party
jin California. Conservatives do
not yet have a constant majority
in the state central committee,
j but a victory in June, 1966, would
consolidate their gains and be
an important demonstration of
their ability to keep growing de
spite November 1964. Conversely,
ia liberal win could mark the be
ginning of a comeback for their
forces in the largest state in the
nation.
A final thought:
Should the Republican candi
date win the election and unseat
i Brown (or whoever carries the
j Democratic flag), ho would bo
come a major national figure,
particularly in view of the large
Democrat margin in voter regis
tration in California.
Indeed, the governor of Cali
fornia would be as logical a can
didate for the 1968 Presidential
nomination as was the governor
jof Pennsylvania in 1961 each
' having served only two years.

The 1966 primary could be the

Should the Republican candi

Such is the intense competition in our party system that results
of the last round of elections had scarcely been tallied w hen all
eyes w ere turned to 1966.
Already, the jockeying for position lias begun for the California
gubernatorial race, and some interesting new faces are among the

Possible Brown Opponents
"Big Daddy" Unruh would like J
to see Brown step aside and give

The Republicans are far from
disspirited after the November
fracas. In the 1964 contests the
GOP held onto its strength in the j
state senate (which enables the
party to block Democrat bills re
j quiring a two-thirds vote, includ-j
' ing the budget>, picked up three
seats in the state assembly, and
preserved its proportion of th e
state's Congressional delegation,
not to mention electing George
. Murphy to the U.S. Senate.
Republican stale chairman Dr.
. Gaylord Parkinson is pursuing a
plan whereby he hopes to win
control of the state assembly by
no later than 1969. In addition,
the decision of the Supreme Court
in Reynolds v. Sims will give
extra state senate seats to popu- j
lous Los Angeles and Orange i
counties. Even Gov. Brown con- !
cedes these will be Republican
seats.
Democrats Worried

Ronald Reagan, co-chairman of

and the important question now
seems to be whether he will him
self run for the nomination in
1966 or whether he will lot Chris
topher carry the liberal colors

K lie he I And 'Extremism'
In any case, it is certain that
"extremism" will again be made
an issue. This has been a pro

ment lor the past few campaigns.
Nixon paid the price in 19(52;
Rockefeller paid it in 1964, as each
blasted "rightists" in the primar

do so this year, and was rewarded
with a deafening silence from his
i follow Republican.
On the conservative side, both
Joseph Shell (who ran in 1962
against Nixon) and Max Raflerty
(state superintendent of educa
tion) must bo considered as at
least seconds in case Reagan
should not run. Conservatives are

Reagan would provide a new

Nixon paid the price in 19(52;

On the conservative side, both
Joseph Shell (who ran in 1962
against Nixon) and Max Raflerty
(state superintendent of educa

should not run. Conservatives are

Reagan would provide a new
image. He is a dynamic speaker
and his nationwide telecast dur
ing the recent campaign has been
widely hailed as the most effec
tive political program in twelve
years. He enjoys the advantage of

and television career (which in
cluded narrating the Rose Bowl
Parade again this year).

The Republican contest would
probably ho close. Goldwater's

I row, but it did prove that teams
of volunteer workers could whip
•the pros.
The conservatives now have
both their considerable strength
at the grassroots of California
l Republicanism (including all ma
! jor GOP volunteer groups, such
; as the Young Republicans, United
Republicans, and Republican As
sembly), and a U.S. Senator to
match Kuchel.
The 1966 primary could be the
| last hope for the liberals in their
fight to win control of the party
jin California. Conservatives do
not yet have a constant majority
in the state central committee,
j but a victory in June, 1966, would
consolidate their gains and be
an important demonstration of
their ability to keep growing de
spite November 1964. Conversely,
ia liberal win could mark the be
ginning of a comeback for their
forces in the largest state in the
nation.
A final thought:
Should the Republican candi
date win the election and unseat
i Brown (or whoever carries the
j Democratic flag), ho would bo
come a major national figure,
particularly in view of the large
Democrat margin in voter regis
tration in California.
Indeed, the governor of Cali
fornia would be as logical a can
didate for the 1968 Presidential
nomination as was the governor
jof Pennsylvania in 1961 each
' having served only two years.
Such is the intense competition in our party system that results
of the last round of elections had scarcely been tallied w hen all
eyes w ere turned to 1966.
Already, the jockeying for position lias begun for the California
gubernatorial race, and some interesting new faces are among the

! hopefuls - — a former mayor, an-*
other movie actor, an upstart
i Congressman, a political boss.
The Democrats may well have
no decision about which to worry
themselves if Pat Brown decides
I to run again. President Johnson
I evidently has decided against off
ering him a cabinet post, which
I leaves him with nowhere to go but
back to Sacramento.
Possible Brown Opponents
"Big Daddy" Unruh would like J
to see Brown step aside and give
him a shot at the governorship
(it is said that Unruh even has
i Presidential ambitions! ), but so
would Jimmy Roosevelt, who has
' declared his candidacy for mayor :
of Los Angeles against incumbent
Democrat maverick Sam Yorty.
The Republicans are far from
disspirited after the November
fracas. In the 1964 contests the
GOP held onto its strength in the j
state senate (which enables the
party to block Democrat bills re
j quiring a two-thirds vote, includ-j
' ing the budget>, picked up three
seats in the state assembly, and
preserved its proportion of th e
state's Congressional delegation,
not to mention electing George
. Murphy to the U.S. Senate.
Republican stale chairman Dr.
. Gaylord Parkinson is pursuing a
plan whereby he hopes to win
control of the state assembly by
no later than 1969. In addition,
the decision of the Supreme Court
in Reynolds v. Sims will give
extra state senate seats to popu- j
lous Los Angeles and Orange i
counties. Even Gov. Brown con- !
cedes these will be Republican
seats.
Democrats Worried
Add to all this the tremendously j
increased volunteer force created !
J by the Goldwater campaign and!
you can .see why the Democrats;
are worried about holding the <
! statehouse in 1966.
Ronald Reagan, co-chairman of
California Citizens for Goldwater-
Miller, is being touted by many
I conservative Republicans for the
j gubernatorial race. He is consid
j ering the proposal and is known
' to be quite interested in the con
! servative cause.
George Christopher, former
mayor of San Francisco, has said
he will announce by June his in
tentions. Ho has had a paid staff'
working on the campaign for
I several months..
Senator Thomas Kuchel ha s
assumed a major role in the fight
for liberal control of the party
and the important question now
seems to be whether he will him
self run for the nomination in
1966 or whether he will lot Chris
topher carry the liberal colors
