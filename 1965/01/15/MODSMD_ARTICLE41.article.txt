## Is Stanford Like Old Bologna? 
### 
Dear Sir:
The recent discussions on (lie
role, rights and influences of stu
dents at Stanford suggests a com
parison with overseas universities.
Why should not Stanford students
for example he similar to the sin
dents at the University of Bologna
in the twelfth century? These
students, to use the words of
H.A.L. Fisher, "hired ihe teach
ers, often failing to pay them
their wages, and reduced them to
a most humiliating degree of ser
vitude. The professor was fined it
he was a minute late for lectures,
if he went beyond the lime for
closing, if he skipped a difficult
passage, or failed to get through
in a given time the portions of
(he law-texts provided by the Uni
versity. A committee of students
the denunciators doctorum
watched over his conduct and kept
the rectors informed of his ir
regularities. If the doctor' wanted
to be married a single day of ab
sence was graciously allowed him.

Dear Sir:
It is unfortunate that most
Stanford undergraduates are un
aware of the opportunity for a
year's study in Uganda, East
Africa, provided by the Overseas
Exchange Scholarship Commis
sion under the auspices of the
ASSU.
1 participated in this program
two years ago and can honestly
say thcit Uganda offers an excel
lent setting for any one interested
in any aspect of African affairs
social, political or anthropo
logical.
Uganda i-. a peaceful country

and has never been plagued with
violent or revolutionary politics.
However, the intricacy of her in
ternal politics is fascinating and
its study can be both enjoyable
and rewarding. Uganda is a small
country with a good system of
roads and transportation that fa
cilitates easy travel throughout
ihe country and her seven mil
lion people come from diverse cul
tural backgrounds (there are 2S
distinct languages in addition to
English t.
Makerere College's 900 students
(with a ratio worse than Stan

ford) are mainly from East Africa
but a few come from as far as
South Africa and Nigeria. Ex
change students live in the dorms
and easily participate in student
life.
The college is in Ihe capital
city just a few miles from Lake
Victoria. The countryside is green
and beautiful and the climate is
warm and pleasant.
I am enthusiastic about the ex
change and would be most happy
to talk to anyone interested in
the program.
