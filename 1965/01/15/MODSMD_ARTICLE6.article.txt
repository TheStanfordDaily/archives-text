# LASSU Calls Election Of Graduate Students To Fill Vacant Seats
## Acts In Response To GCC Request 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM 
LASSU approved last night a
proposal to call a special elec
tion to lill vacant Legislature
scats open to the graduate
schools.
The proposal resulted from tho
efforts of ten graduate students,
presumably at the urgings of the
Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee, to fill the vacancies.
IN CONSIDERING the propo
sal. LASSU voted down an amend
ment that would have given ASSU
President Scott MeBride the
power to appoint I lie aspiring rep
resentatives.
Instead a "final" election, to he
held January 26, for all vacant
graduate seats was voted.
In this election no write-in votes
will be allowed and a plurality
will determine the winners.
THE ATTEMPTS of the gradu
ate students were interpreted as
t lie reflection of a renewed inter
est of this group in campus af
fairs.
The G r a d u a t e Coordinating
Committee, an organization com
posed solely of graduate students,
is said to be responsible for much
of this activity.
Last fall tho graduate LASSU
positions were not included on
the elections ballot because no
interest was shown, according to
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw.
THE LEGISLATURE, conven
ing for its first regular meeting
since November 17, conducted a
full slate of business.
It referred a resolution to ex
tend the Daily editor's term of
office to a full academic year to
the By-Laws Committee for con
siderat ion.
The proposal which came to
the Legislature with the approval
of the Publications Board, would
make other minor changes in
Daily operations but would not
go into effect until after elections
this month.
ALSO set up a com
mittee to investigate problems
involved in the recent Berkeley
situation and to determine their
relevancy 1o the Stanford cam
pus.
The committee will also study
the activities and attitudes of
Stanford voluntary organizations
in an attempt to improve their
operations.
In other action, the representa
tives passed resolutions author
izing two fund drives—a Missis
sippi Freedom Project Drive to
be held this quarter and a Conva
lescent Home Drive—scheduled
for spring quarter.
ALTHOUGH the drives were
approved, there was lengthy dis
cussion whether such money soli
citation required legislative ap
proval.
Under the LASSTJ By-Laws, ex
tensive all-campus programs of
this kind require authorization,
but there are other provisions for

I "temporary solicitation" (subject
jto approval of a three-member
committee), according to ASSU
President Mcßride.

for spring quarter.
ALTHOUGH the drives were
approved, there was lengthy dis
cussion whether such money soli
citation required legislative ap
proval.
Under the LASSTJ By-Laws, ex
tensive all-campus programs of

change ol university regulations
concerning solicitations is now
! under consideration.
LASSU approved last night a
proposal to call a special elec
tion to lill vacant Legislature
scats open to the graduate
schools.
The proposal resulted from tho
efforts of ten graduate students,
presumably at the urgings of the
Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee, to fill the vacancies.
IN CONSIDERING the propo
sal. LASSU voted down an amend
ment that would have given ASSU
President Scott MeBride the
power to appoint I lie aspiring rep
resentatives.
Instead a "final" election, to he
held January 26, for all vacant
graduate seats was voted.
In this election no write-in votes
will be allowed and a plurality
will determine the winners.
THE ATTEMPTS of the gradu
ate students were interpreted as
t lie reflection of a renewed inter
est of this group in campus af
fairs.
The G r a d u a t e Coordinating
Committee, an organization com
posed solely of graduate students,
is said to be responsible for much
of this activity.
Last fall tho graduate LASSU
positions were not included on
the elections ballot because no
interest was shown, according to
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw.
THE LEGISLATURE, conven
ing for its first regular meeting
since November 17, conducted a
full slate of business.
It referred a resolution to ex
tend the Daily editor's term of
office to a full academic year to
the By-Laws Committee for con
siderat ion.
The proposal which came to
the Legislature with the approval
of the Publications Board, would
make other minor changes in
Daily operations but would not
go into effect until after elections
this month.
ALSO set up a com
mittee to investigate problems
involved in the recent Berkeley
situation and to determine their
relevancy 1o the Stanford cam
pus.
The committee will also study
the activities and attitudes of
Stanford voluntary organizations
in an attempt to improve their
operations.
In other action, the representa
tives passed resolutions author
izing two fund drives—a Missis
sippi Freedom Project Drive to
be held this quarter and a Conva
lescent Home Drive—scheduled
for spring quarter.
ALTHOUGH the drives were
approved, there was lengthy dis
