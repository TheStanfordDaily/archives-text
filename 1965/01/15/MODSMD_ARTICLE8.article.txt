### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
A Committee of 18 has bwn
set up to "explore the needs
of men students and consider
varied means of handling
them," announced Robert
Gordon, Dean of Men.
The committee, which con
sists of ten students, two ad
ministrators and one faculty
member, serves as an advisor
to the Dean. According* to sen
ior chairman Ed Kaiser, the
committee is "a place where
interested students or groups
can air their ideas Iwfore
other students and memlvers
of the Faculty aud Adminis
tration. If we think there is
something to do, we suggest
to the Dean's office that a
committee be set up to study
the problem."
Sometimes the recommend
ed committee turns out to Im>
the Committee of I.S itself.
Late last quarter tlx* Com
mittee helped to revamp the
system of dispersing intro
ductory information to in
coming freshmen. Next year,
illst e a d of innumerable

pamphlets, the new frosh will
Im> given two l>ooks. The ma
terial to be presented was
changed also â€” dollies will
uo longer be advised that they
are fair game for senior men
while under a full inoon
somewhere near Memorial
Church.
Another proposal brought
to the committee last quarter
concerned the possibility of
setting up a new resturant
on campus to alleviate the
pressure on Tresidder during
eating hours. After doing
some research on the prob
lem, the committee discovered
that Women's Council was
studying the same proposal.
The Committee of 13 then
handed its findings over to
AVVS.
"Sometines we find our
selves acting as liaison agents
for other committees," Kaiser
explained, "but what we're
set up to do is discuss new
problems."
Some of the "new prob
lems" Gordon thought would
come before the committee
are the liquor policy, and per
haps, rush.
