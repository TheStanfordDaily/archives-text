F Where is the God I
of the Jews?
One might well inquire of tin- Jewish people today, "where is your God These
great people in time past wen: in a close and covenant relationship with liod. Even
fore.ign powers and strangers were forced to admit l>y the evidence at hand that
God's supernatural presence was with His people. Today, the Jewish religion is
ceremony and law. ritual and regulation, hut no divine blessing of the _ spiritual
power and life of our Creator dwells among them. The question we ask, "where is
the God of the Jews?" is answered hy Paul in Chapter II of Romans ill the New
Testament:
"I ask then, has (jod rejected and deserted His people, the Jews' Oh, no not
at all. Remember that I myself aiu a Jew. a descendant of Abraham and a member
; of Benjamin's family: no. • lod has not discarded His own people whom lie chose
1 from the very beginning. Do you remember what the Scriptures say about this J
Klijab tile prophet was complaining to God about the Jews, telling God how they
had killed tile prophets and torn down God's altars; Klijab claimed that he was the
only one left in all the land who still loved (lod, and now they were trying to kill
him too. And you remember how God replied? God said. 'No, you are not the only
one left. 1 have seven thousand others besides you who still love me and have not
lniwed down to idols!" It is the same today. Not all the Jews have turned away
from God. There are a few being saved as a result of (iod's kindness in choosing
them. And if it i~ by (iod's kindness, then it is not b\ their being good enough. For
in that ease the free gift would not longer be free it isn't free when it is earned.
"So this is the situation: most of the Jews have not found the favor of Gihl
they ace lu.ikmg for. A few ha\e. the outs God has picked out, but the eyes of the
others have b« > n blinded. This is what our Scriptures refer to win n they say that
God hus put tlieiit to -hep. shutting their eyes and ears so that they do not under
stand what wi are talking about when we tell them of Christ. And so it is to this
very day. . .
"Did God ui ilm Tlis Jewish people stumble like this for the purpose nf bringing
disaster tti them? Oh no. I lis purpose was to make His salvation available to the j
Gentiles, and then the Jews would lie jealous and liegin to want God's salvation
for themselves. Nov if the Whole world became rich as a result of God's offer of
salvation, when the Jews stumbled over it and turned it down, think how much
greater a blessing the world will share in later on when the Jews too conic to
Christ. . . And how wonderful it is when they become Christians. When God
turned away from them it meant that lie turned to the rest of the world to offer
111- ialvatiiin. and now it is even mon wonderful when some of the Jews cotne to
Christ. It is like dead people coming back to life again, . .
"Oh what a wonderful God we have! How great are His wisdom and Know
ledge and riches. How imp<> silile it is for us to understand His decisions and
Ilis methods. I'or who among us can know the mind of the Fxird' Who knows
ciioukli to be Ilis counselor and "iiide"-> And who has ever given anything to the !
I.ord fir<t as payment for -<iiiietliing in return? For everything conies from God I
alone. Everything liv< > l»y Hi ponei . and everything is for His glory. To Hint I I
he glory for everyone." (Romans 11:1-8, 11, IJ, I.S, ii-j0) Living Letters).
The God of the Jews js the God of all mankind, our Creator, who meets men
| and women everywhere 'in the bans of their trust aud commitment to Je-u- ( hrist
as Lord.
