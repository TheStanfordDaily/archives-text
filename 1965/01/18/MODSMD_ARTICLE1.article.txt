• UN To Face l)aes Issue
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. — The U.N.
General Assembly reopens today with some
countries anxious for settlement of the Sovict-
U.S. dispute over peacekeeping costs, even at
the risk of a showdown that might rock the
world organization.
Last month the 115-nation assembly evaded
the issue of whether the Soviet Union should

lu.se its vote for nonpayment of peacekeeping
assessments. During the first part of its 19th
annual session. the assembly took up only
matters that could be decided by general con
sent, without a vote.
But some delegations, especially African,
are reported anxious to begin work on the
assembly's 92-item agenda, which would re
quire voting. They are opposed to any fur
ther delay calculated to keep the big powers
from clashing on the assembly floor.
The Soviet Union has warned that if the
no-vote penalty is applied it will walk out of
the assembly. The United States has threat
ened to reconsider its financial support of the
U.N. if the Russians are allowed to escape
payment.

Last month the 115-nation assembly evaded
