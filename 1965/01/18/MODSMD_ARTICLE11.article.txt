# Designs Help Sailors Steer
## Engineers Devise New Controls 
### 
Sunday sailors may got a break
if small l)oal manufacturers adopt
the ideas of a Stanford class of
design engineers.
After a study of the average
yacht man's needs, desires and
capabilities, which included a
cruise on a new 10-foot boat, they
produced a dozen model control
consoles for a motor cruiser. It
was a course project for the De
sign Division of Stanford's Me
chanical Engineering Department.
Most of the student designs
incorporated drastic changes in
the conventional cruiser controls.
Gearshift, throttle, and other con
trol levers were placed within
easy reach. Ignition switches were
installed so as lo prevent start
ing the engine until Die bilge was
definitely free of gasoline fumes,
thus eliminating one cause of
boaling tragedies.
Human, as well as mechanical
and safety factors, were consid
ered one student designed an
adjustable steering wheel column
tu fit bulging waistlines.
The students were praised both
by their instructor, John M. Les
lie. and by William E. Williams, a
specialist in human factors engi
neering, who said the students
"came up with some sharp ideas."
