# Sinclair To Visit Stanford
## Author-Reformer To Speak Twice 
### 
One of the most extraordinary
characters of the twentieth cen
tury returns to the Stanford cam
pus today after an absence of 53
years.
Upton Sinclair, who will speak
in the Large Lounge of Tresidder
Union at 4:15 and in Cubberley
Auditorium at 8:00 tonight, was
last at Stanford in 1909. Then 31
years old, lie was already famous
and controversial.
The Jungle, the best-known of
his many novels, had appeared
in 1906, and shocked the public
by exposing the incredible condi
tions that prevailed in the meat
packing industry.
Sinclair had hoped the book
would advance the cause of So
cialism; but its main result was
an improvement in t'no industry's
standards of cleanliness.
"I aimed for the nation's heart,"
Sinclair said ruefully, "and hit
its stomach." But he still takes
credit for "reforming" the Ar
mour family; they are one of the
"Three Families 1 Reformed," the
topic of his speech this evening.
The other two families who
were made to change their ways
by the crusading zeal of Upton
Sinclair are Ih e Rockefellers,
whose labor policy excited Sin
clair's wrath, and the Fords, the
subject of The Flivver-Fish, an
other sample of Sinclair's fiction.
In his afternoon talk, the oc
tagenarian reformer will discuss
the political side of his careerâ€”
specifically, his race for governor
of California on the EPIC (End
Poverty in California.) ticket.
Sinclair had twice previously
been the Socialist candidate for
governor, but in 1931 he had a
real chance to win. He was bit
terly opposed by big business, and
by conservatives of both parties;
but he was enthusiastically sup
ported by the countless varieties
of liberals and radicals spawned
by the Depression and the New
Deal, and by many dissident
Democrats. Some thought Presi
dent Roosevelt's sympathies were
also with the EPIC party.
The Autobiography of Upton
Sinclair, published in 1962. con
cludes with ;i look at the future:
Sinclair intended then, and still
intends, to "say what he thinks
and hope to be heard . . . |to|
go on fighting for social justice
and the democratic ideal, hope
that man does not destroy him
self. by design or by accident, and
trust that eventually the peoples
of the world will force their rulers
to follow the ways of peace, of
freedom, and of social justice."
