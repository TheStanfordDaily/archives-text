Grants totaling $6 million have
boon awarded to 109 institutions
by NSF in a new program to
enable graduate schools to selcct
1220 students for full-time grad

Berkeley received $240,982 112 or
49 traineeships while Stanford
got $236,064 for 48. These grants
were exceeded only by those to
MIT. the University of Michigan,
and Purdue.
