# New Exhibits At Library
## 
### 
The trudge up the Main Libe
stairs has been brightened this
year by many attractive exhibits
along the main stairway.
They are presented by Tresid
der Union's Cultural Arts Divi
sion, and include a number of
various techniques and styles,
many of them new or experi
mental forms.
Library displays were planned
by the library staff until the
spring of 1963, when it became
necessary to discontinue the dis
plays. The Cultural Arts Division
then undertook responsibility for
the exhibition area, in which it
intended to display material of
high quality which could not be
shown at Tresidder.
The display area has provided
an opportunity to experiment
with new exhibit techniques and
to present art forms which are
infrequently shown, such as the
display of Sunii art last fall and
the coming show of mosaics by
Tom Hunt.
This year activities in the li
brary have been expanded to in
clude a continuous exhibition
schedule featuring the works of
several promient artists. These
include an exhibit of non-objective
oil paintings by Linda Benison,
a noted Peninsula artist, and stu
dent work from the Otis Art In
stitute, a graduate school of art
in Los Angeles.
