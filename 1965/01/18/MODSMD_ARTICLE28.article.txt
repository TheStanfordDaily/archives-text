## WSU And Mediocrity: A Cage Case History 
### Roger Magnuson 
One ol those tangled mysteries which appears unfathomable to
this sports theorist is, to be quite anthromorphic, that of sports
competition always seeking its lowest level. \o matter how great
the mismatch in any particular contest, it happens quite often
that the fabric of the game can be no more elegant than that of

the losing team.
In Stanford's last pair of homo
games, against Washington and
Washington State the weekend bo
fore last, this particular enormity
of sports was quite apparent.
As soon as Washington State
took th e floor one could sense
that his last best hope for a mod
erately enjoyable evening lay
with the band and pom-pon girls.
As their squad sHtmbled oui of
the dressing room in uniforms
approaching in color some of the
older of Stanford's tile roofs, you
could discern a distinct feeling of
empathy among the spectators.
First there was a 6'6" forward
named Darrell Peeples who had a
brother who was a star once and
thus cannot be blamed for fool
step following; he actually had
an essentially capitalist look to
him. His 170 pounds simply would
defy redistribution.
He dribbled a basketball as eas
ily as most people handle a medi
cine ball; he took shots the way
mosl people shot put.
When he ran, he ran wilh his
arms extended outward for bal
ance. He took two steps back
ward when hit by a blast from
a Stanford rooter's air horn.
ONE OF THE BEST
And he seemed to be one of
their best. You could see after a
few minutes of this particular
game that the Stanford team,
through a combination of sym
pathy and apathy, wasn't going to
appear much better.
Whatever afflicts mediocre
teams seems definitely to be
catching.
Missed passes, ball control er
rors, bad shots, and general bum
bling were the order of the day.
The hot dog venders were giving
the wrong change. Only the band
remained firm.
Not only in these parts of the
game did its elegance suffer. The
disturbing high school habits of
yore, such peccadilloes as mutter
ing a pained "gee whiz" after a
"hard-luck" shot, a vigorous shak
ing of the head after having a
ball stolen, a pained shrug to the
coach and near tears after double
dribbling, were witnessed in
abundance from the Washington
Staters and, sad to relate, even a
little from the Stanford players.
Of course, Stanford dominated
the game and won with little dif
ficulty and hence the game had
some merit for Stanford rooters
at least. But still, it had little
class.
A LITTLE 31 ORE (LASS
The next afternoon the Wash
ington Huskies came to town
with a slightly more respectable
squad, slightly more respectable
uniforms, and no Darrell Peeples.

Perhaps it was only because
the television cameras which were
focused on the action, bui this
second contest was a substan
tively better basketball game.
There were mistakes, but not
an inordinate amount of them,
and all in all, while the score of
the games and the outcomes of
t hem differed scarcely al all, there
was an intangible, somewhat
ethereal "class" to the game.
The pom-pon girls kicked
higher. The hot dog venders yelled
more throatily, the yell-leaders
led more decisively, and the play
ers themselves showed some
grace, poise, and a maturity which
transcended the shrugs and tears
of the night before.
All around there was more class.
Bob Bedell had his best offensive
night as a Stanford player, show
ing some fine moves around the
baseline and some fine shots from
outside, while Clayton Raaka was
leaping high off the ground to
grab important rebounds. Even
the crowd looked be.tter.
Hence the rule of competition
seeking its lowest level was evi
dent in the play of last weekend.
And it seems to be an affliction
which only pertains to good,
solid teams.
The super teams, like UCLA,
run a poor, mediocre, and some
times even a solid team into the
ground and, while not perhaps as
inspired as in a tight game, never
theless usually . look like their
press build-up.
But the solid teams who, while
not championship caliber are
not slouches either, are eon
strained by the Invisible Hand of
the Fates to play well only
against near-equals or betters.
The reason for this is unclear;
but clearly it should be worth a
Ford grant.

the losing team.
In Stanford's last pair of homo
games, against Washington and
Washington State the weekend bo
fore last, this particular enormity
of sports was quite apparent.
As soon as Washington State
took th e floor one could sense
that his last best hope for a mod
erately enjoyable evening lay
with the band and pom-pon girls.
As their squad sHtmbled oui of
the dressing room in uniforms
approaching in color some of the
older of Stanford's tile roofs, you
could discern a distinct feeling of
empathy among the spectators.
First there was a 6'6" forward
named Darrell Peeples who had a
brother who was a star once and
thus cannot be blamed for fool
step following; he actually had
an essentially capitalist look to
him. His 170 pounds simply would
defy redistribution.
He dribbled a basketball as eas
ily as most people handle a medi
cine ball; he took shots the way
mosl people shot put.
When he ran, he ran wilh his
arms extended outward for bal
ance. He took two steps back
ward when hit by a blast from
a Stanford rooter's air horn.
ONE OF THE BEST
And he seemed to be one of
their best. You could see after a
few minutes of this particular
game that the Stanford team,
through a combination of sym
pathy and apathy, wasn't going to
appear much better.
Whatever afflicts mediocre
teams seems definitely to be
catching.
Missed passes, ball control er
rors, bad shots, and general bum
bling were the order of the day.
The hot dog venders were giving
the wrong change. Only the band
remained firm.
Not only in these parts of the
game did its elegance suffer. The
disturbing high school habits of
yore, such peccadilloes as mutter
ing a pained "gee whiz" after a
"hard-luck" shot, a vigorous shak
ing of the head after having a
ball stolen, a pained shrug to the
coach and near tears after double
dribbling, were witnessed in
abundance from the Washington
Staters and, sad to relate, even a
little from the Stanford players.
Of course, Stanford dominated
the game and won with little dif
ficulty and hence the game had
some merit for Stanford rooters
at least. But still, it had little
class.
A LITTLE 31 ORE (LASS
The next afternoon the Wash
ington Huskies came to town
with a slightly more respectable
squad, slightly more respectable
uniforms, and no Darrell Peeples.

Perhaps it was only because
the television cameras which were
focused on the action, bui this
second contest was a substan
tively better basketball game.
There were mistakes, but not
an inordinate amount of them,
and all in all, while the score of
the games and the outcomes of
t hem differed scarcely al all, there
was an intangible, somewhat
ethereal "class" to the game.
The pom-pon girls kicked
higher. The hot dog venders yelled
more throatily, the yell-leaders
led more decisively, and the play
ers themselves showed some
grace, poise, and a maturity which
transcended the shrugs and tears
of the night before.
All around there was more class.
Bob Bedell had his best offensive
night as a Stanford player, show
ing some fine moves around the
baseline and some fine shots from
outside, while Clayton Raaka was
leaping high off the ground to
grab important rebounds. Even
the crowd looked be.tter.
Hence the rule of competition
seeking its lowest level was evi
dent in the play of last weekend.
And it seems to be an affliction
which only pertains to good,
solid teams.
The super teams, like UCLA,
run a poor, mediocre, and some
times even a solid team into the
ground and, while not perhaps as
inspired as in a tight game, never
theless usually . look like their
press build-up.
But the solid teams who, while
not championship caliber are
not slouches either, are eon
strained by the Invisible Hand of
the Fates to play well only
against near-equals or betters.
The reason for this is unclear;
but clearly it should be worth a
Ford grant.
One ol those tangled mysteries which appears unfathomable to
this sports theorist is, to be quite anthromorphic, that of sports
competition always seeking its lowest level. \o matter how great
the mismatch in any particular contest, it happens quite often
that the fabric of the game can be no more elegant than that of

erately enjoyable evening lay
with the band and pom-pon girls.
As their squad sHtmbled oui of
the dressing room in uniforms
approaching in color some of the
older of Stanford's tile roofs, you
could discern a distinct feeling of
empathy among the spectators.
First there was a 6'6" forward
named Darrell Peeples who had a
brother who was a star once and
thus cannot be blamed for fool
step following; he actually had
an essentially capitalist look to
him. His 170 pounds simply would
defy redistribution.
He dribbled a basketball as eas
ily as most people handle a medi
cine ball; he took shots the way
mosl people shot put.
When he ran, he ran wilh his
arms extended outward for bal
ance. He took two steps back
ward when hit by a blast from
a Stanford rooter's air horn.
ONE OF THE BEST
And he seemed to be one of
their best. You could see after a
few minutes of this particular
game that the Stanford team,
through a combination of sym
pathy and apathy, wasn't going to
appear much better.
Whatever afflicts mediocre
teams seems definitely to be
catching.
Missed passes, ball control er
rors, bad shots, and general bum
bling were the order of the day.
The hot dog venders were giving
the wrong change. Only the band
remained firm.
Not only in these parts of the
game did its elegance suffer. The
disturbing high school habits of
yore, such peccadilloes as mutter
ing a pained "gee whiz" after a
"hard-luck" shot, a vigorous shak
ing of the head after having a
ball stolen, a pained shrug to the
coach and near tears after double
dribbling, were witnessed in
abundance from the Washington
Staters and, sad to relate, even a
little from the Stanford players.
Of course, Stanford dominated
the game and won with little dif
ficulty and hence the game had
some merit for Stanford rooters
at least. But still, it had little
class.
A LITTLE 31 ORE (LASS
The next afternoon the Wash
ington Huskies came to town
with a slightly more respectable
squad, slightly more respectable
uniforms, and no Darrell Peeples.

Perhaps it was only because
the television cameras which were
focused on the action, bui this
second contest was a substan
tively better basketball game.
There were mistakes, but not
an inordinate amount of them,
and all in all, while the score of
the games and the outcomes of
t hem differed scarcely al all, there
was an intangible, somewhat
ethereal "class" to the game.
The pom-pon girls kicked
higher. The hot dog venders yelled
more throatily, the yell-leaders
led more decisively, and the play
ers themselves showed some
grace, poise, and a maturity which
transcended the shrugs and tears
of the night before.
All around there was more class.
Bob Bedell had his best offensive
night as a Stanford player, show
ing some fine moves around the
baseline and some fine shots from
outside, while Clayton Raaka was
leaping high off the ground to
grab important rebounds. Even
the crowd looked be.tter.
Hence the rule of competition
seeking its lowest level was evi
dent in the play of last weekend.
And it seems to be an affliction
which only pertains to good,
solid teams.
The super teams, like UCLA,
run a poor, mediocre, and some
times even a solid team into the
ground and, while not perhaps as
inspired as in a tight game, never
theless usually . look like their
press build-up.
But the solid teams who, while
not championship caliber are
not slouches either, are eon
strained by the Invisible Hand of
the Fates to play well only
against near-equals or betters.
The reason for this is unclear;
but clearly it should be worth a
Ford grant.
