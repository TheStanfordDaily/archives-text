# ADMINISTRATION'S ROLE
## There Can Be An Alternative To The Bad Man's University 
### BILL BERKOWITZ (Last of a Series) 
lii the bacl man's university, intellect is "an
instrument of national purpose, a component part
of the 'military-industrial complex.'" Instead of
producing corn flakes, the university produces
knowledge. Knowledge is packaged in containers
called students by line workers called professors,
certified with seals of approval, and shipped off
to serve the free worldâ€”all to the greater glory
of the executives called deans who run the show.
If the student is more than a receptacle, if the
professor is more than a vending machine, if the
university really is defined by a community of
students and faculty mutually engaged in scholar
ship, we have an alternative position. What then
of the administration? The administration serves
this community by helping it function the most,
effectively. Not too surprisingly, this is the view
of many men who are administrators. We may
disagree on how the administration can best serve.
More Thau Street Sweepers
We will agree that the administration must do
more than sweep the streets. Beyond their aca
demic needs, students and faculty in a residential
university have the same human needs as those
living in any small city of 10,000. They must have
food, shelter, transportation. Since the commu
nity of scholars does not want to be burdened
with planning menus or routing traffic, it dele
gates this responsibility to administrators, who
may retain it as long as the scholars are satisfied
with their performance.
There are intermediate areas the libraries and
residences, finances and development come to mind
- which are more directly relevant, to academics,
yet still reduce the time available for scholarship.
Responsibility is delegated here too, but more cau
tiously.
Finally, there are areas which cannot be dele
gated away. The form and content of instruction,
the direction of research, on the one hand; and
personal conduct and association, the stance to
ward society at large, and tho handling of viola
tions of the standards adopted by the community,
on the other. Abdication of responsibility for these
matters is also abdication of the scholar's oppor
tunity to function as a full human being. If, in
addition, the authority for these matters stems
from those who are supposed to bo serving the
community, the validity of the scholarly life is
itself undercut.
The return to reality is painful. We have at
Stanford, as at most universities, a situation where
the administration directs the community, instead
of advising it; and where a few members of the
community advise the administration, instead of
all of them directing it. The danger of administra
tive direction going awry is compounded by the
lack of channels between its leaders and the com
munity.
To assert the administration has done more
good than harm for Stanford is patronizing. They
built this university where horses grazed 80 years
ago. They set and held to tho original standards
of quality, and collected the dollars to perpetuate
it. But one must press further.

The trustees, at (he top of the hierachy, are
mostly wealthy businessmen and lawyers, as are
the University of California's regents. They be
come trustees by election of the other trustees,
and serve for five to ten years. At their monthly
meetings in San Francisco, they hear reports from
the President and other administrators, occasion
ally from faculty.
The President engages in one-way communica
tion with the full student body once a year in
January, and addresses the entering students once
a year in September. He also meets with his presi
dential advisory committees, some of whose seats
students have not bothered to fill, and some of
which do not include students. One which does
is the Student Advisory Committee, composed of
students the President selects, and which has thus
far met once this academic year.
What can easily happen with this type of
arrangement is an evolution toward the bad man's
university. With poor communications, the ad
ministration simply cannot be responsive to the
needs of the community it should serve. It sees
the knowledge container, not the student. With
poor communications, there is misunderstanding,
then suspicion, then hostility. What else would lead
a Clark Kerr to say, not many years ago: "The
employers will love this generation, they are not
going to press many grievances . . . They are going
to be easy to handle. There aren't going to be any
riots."
Were I to feel de-personalized, it would not
be from the faculty, as Dr. Sterling suggests; Kerr
made the same mistake. It would be from the ad
ministration.
To open the avenues of communication, there
should be a standing committee of the trustees
on student affairs, to meet regularly with a rep
resentative group of students. Student participa
tion on the presidential advisory committees
should be encouraged and broadened. There should
be graduate representation on tlie Student Advis
ory Committee, or better, a separate group of
graduate students, selected by their own depart
ments, both groups to meet with the President or
his representatives as often as the need arises.
In general, the amount of communication be
tween the community and the administration
should be determined by the former.
The Decisions Are Not Easy
Similarly, the community should determine the
amount of responsibility it wishes to delegate.
These decisions are not easy; the community may
choose to do 100 much by itself, and thus by ad
ministrating defeat its own purpose. And the
same student who clamors for admission into the
conference room may have second thoughts when
he faces writing a report.
The assumption of community responsibility
will not come about unless the community asks
for it. Many will prefer the status quo. But what
the community really wants to do for itself, it
must inevitably be able to do. For in the commu
nity is where the real power lies; with an admin
istration but no scholars, there is no university;
while with scholars and no administration, there
can still be one.
