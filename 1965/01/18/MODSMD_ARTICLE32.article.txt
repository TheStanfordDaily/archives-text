## LASSU: Theatre Of Absurd 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
"If you don't take it seriously, we might as
well fold up out tents," said LASSU Speaker Ed
Shaw, addressing the LASSU members at last
Thursday's meeting.
Shaw's suggestion to "fold up our tents" may
well have been the best statement made all night.
For LASSU is a badly under-rehearsed, consider
ably improvised example of the Theatre of the
Absurd, in which the LASSU members arc both
audience and supporting cast.
Shaw, as star-director of this farce, usually
rewrote the script as he went along, aided by ASSU
President Scott Mcßride and a tall, blonde young
man who was trying to bring some order out of
the chaos-—with a notable lack of success.
The LASSU members—roughly divided into
the categories of those who didn't say anything
and those who said something about everything
without really saying anything—were of little
help. Many members didn't bother to show up at
all, and of those who did a good number left dur

ing the course of the meeting whether through
disgust or in order to get to a coffee date, one
couldn't be sure so that when, near the end of
the meeting, Shaw had some important commit
tee appointments to make, there was no one there
either willing or able to accept them.
Perhaps I lie best evidence of the ludicrousness
of the whole meeting comes comes from the dia
logue, from which the following are selected ex
amples:
Mcßride, in assuring the possibility of getting
some information from Registrar Harvey Hall,
"We're highly endeared of Harvey Hall" to which
Shaw added, "Yes, Harvey's one of our friends."
Shaw, after starting to express an idea in the
midst of a particularly sticky discussion of par
liamentary procedure, "Oh, no, I'll get in trouble."
And, turning to Mcßride, plaintively, "Scott."
Mcßride, in trying to clear up a point, "There
is a difference between a drive and a solicitation
and I'll try to make it clear. Perhaps it isn't clear."
And finally, Shaw, caught up by the political
doubletalk of the petty, picayune parliamentarians
present, "Just a minute, we got lost."

tee appointments to make, there was no one there
either willing or able to accept them.
Perhaps I lie best evidence of the ludicrousness
of the whole meeting comes comes from the dia
logue, from which the following are selected ex
amples:
Mcßride, in assuring the possibility of getting
some information from Registrar Harvey Hall,
"We're highly endeared of Harvey Hall" to which
Shaw added, "Yes, Harvey's one of our friends."
Shaw, after starting to express an idea in the
midst of a particularly sticky discussion of par
liamentary procedure, "Oh, no, I'll get in trouble."
And, turning to Mcßride, plaintively, "Scott."
Mcßride, in trying to clear up a point, "There
is a difference between a drive and a solicitation
and I'll try to make it clear. Perhaps it isn't clear."
And finally, Shaw, caught up by the political
doubletalk of the petty, picayune parliamentarians
present, "Just a minute, we got lost."
