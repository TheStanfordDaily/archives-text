## GCC Urges Grads: Run For LASSU 
### 
Dear Sir:
II is always regrettable when
; means of communication between
students and administrators arc
I unavailable. It is equally regret
table when available means a re
' neglected.
Unlike the student legislature
at Berkeley, LASSU provides for
{graduate student representation.
' Yet graduate students, who com
j prise approximately 48 per cent
of the Stanford student body,
have failed almost entirely to par
ticipate in student government.
: Apathy toward campus issues and
| preoccupation with academic spe
cialization have kept graduate stu
dents from utilizing this impor
tant means of expressing and im
plementing their views. Having
voluntarily disfranchised them
selves, graduate students have
forced upon the undergraduates
responsibilities which they should
share.
The concerns of scholars at all
academic levels are overlapping
and interdependent. For example,
social and political regulations af
fect hot h undergraduate and
graduate students. And it is es
pecially clear thai there are many
areas of interest shared by T.A.'s,
R.A.'s, and undergraduates.
Lccause of these mutual prob
lems and because of our hope to
stimulate thought and action con
cerning academic issues and in
stitutions, the Graduate Coordi
nating Committee encourages
graduate students from all de
partments and schools to seek
seats in LASSU. Nominating pe
titions are available in the ASSU
Office and must be returned with
15 signatures by 5:00 p.m. on
Wednesday, January 20.
Sincerely,
GRADUATE COORDINATING
COMMITTEE
• Donors Thanked
Dear Sir:
Alpha Phi Omega would like to
sincerely thank all those who par
ticipated in and contributed to the
Flood Relief Fund. Over $300 was
collected and given to the Ameri
can National Red Cross for use
in their rehabilitation program.
Though this amount fell short of
the original goal, the generous
responses of numerous individ
uals with their time and m on cy
were greatly appreciated.

• Messiah A Hoax
Dear Sir:
God's Message to the Christians
Today.
Isn't it time you realized I hat
the self-proclaimed Messiah was
a hoax? That he led you away
from the path of the patriarchs
and the prophets and into near
idolatry? For there is only one
God, the one to whom we pray
for justice and mercy, between
whom and man there need be no
intercessor.
And further, if a man follows
His law and does good, God will
know Ids heart. We offer both a

I true l'aith and a true life to those
who would follow God's com
mandments.
Christians, forsake your idol
and join with us. We beseech you
in the spirit of brotherly affection
: to turn from your mistaken be
| liefs.

• Artists" Opportunity
Dear Sir:
When will Stanford's budding
' artists begin taking advantage of
the thousands of square feet of
plywood "canvas" around the
: Undergraduate Library site?

• Fascism And Business
Dear Sir:
The most dangerous force of
the century seems clearly enough
to be Fascism, which may be de
fined as a separation of intellect
and emotion, as screaming Heil
automatically in response to Sieg.
The victims of this mental rot |
may be clever and resourceful j
1 i»i certain areas, but in the han-!
filing of their own emotions and i
capacities for belief, they are
helpless automatons.
The greatest bulwark against
the spread of thoughtless re-1
sponse, and thus the best protec-1
lion of political sanity in the coun-1
try is the tradition of the human-;
istic university.
Stanford should abolish its;
School of Business, for such a
school, while deluding its stu- i
dents that they are partaking of
the essential benefits of a uni
versity, is in fact inimical in many
ways to humanistic ideals of in
telligent consideration of psychic
forces.
Consider the tobacco executives,
good men, as nice as the Dad of
everyone at Stanford. Intelligent
and well-meaning, they arc never- j
theless prey to their occupational |
habit of believing irrationally in
the company, the corporate team,
the product. Belief is in one com
partment. wit and intelligence in
a distinct one. Small wonder,
then, that these men—no worse I
than any businessmen — enthusi- !
astically encourage their friends j
and families to smoke, smoke
themselves, and sincerely doubt
all evidence that the habit is al ;
least to some degree harmful, i
That there have been virtually no j
resignations in this industry in
dicates, not that the American |
businessman is a hypocrite, but
that his intelligence is the ser
vant, not the guide, of his desires.
It is a small jump from this state
of mind to that which allowed
perfectly good men in Germany
to collaborate in unspeakable i
crimes.
Let the corporations establish
their trade schools elsewhere; if
they require their men of author
ity to have humanistic educations j
as well, the nation and business
will both be more sane.
Sincerely.
ROBERT PINSKY
