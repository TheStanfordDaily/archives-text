# Quit That Smoking In Five Speedy (?) Days
## 
### 
Smoking more now and «'ii
joying it less?
If so, a special five-day pro
gram to slop smoking starts
today from 7:30 to J) p.m. in
Koniu on Geology Corner.
The plan, sponsored by lite
Student; Health Service and
the Health Education Depart
ment, is designed to perman
ently break the smoking
habit through will power,
diets, abstinence from liquor,
and fear.
It's not an easy program.
First, the potential non
smoker must tell himself, "I
have chosen not to smoke
anymore." Then he must stick
to that decision.
To reinforce the will power
behind the decision, the pro
gram provides the eurollee
with a partner whom he can
telephone for a few encour
aging words.
But the hard part is yet to
come.
During the five days, the
program calls for strict ad
herence to a diet of fruit
juices, eggs and unspiced
foods. Forbidden are catsup,
pickles, spiced meats, sharp
cheese and all heavy, rich
desserts.
The idea behind consump

tion of fruit juices, or in their
place, warm water, is to flush
out those stubborn nicotine
residues.
Also denied to serious fol
lowers of the plan are all
forms of alcohol, and even
coffee. Such stimulants ap
parently trigger a desire for
tobacco, so count on spending
a dry, sleepy week if you're
considering ending the smok
ing habit this way.
Substituting physical activ
ity for smoking, the plan eails
for frequent after-dinner
walks, vigorous showers and
deep, rhythmic breathing to
dissipate tobacco-less ten
sions.
Finally, to add to the star
vation, temperance and self
denial of the rest of the pro
gram, the enrollee is given
doses of fear during I h e
group therapy sessions.
These consist of lectures
by doctors, films, group dis
cussions and a special film
on the removal of a cancer
ous lung.
For the five days of ten
sion, longing and self-re
straint, the program offers
in return better health — if
the program is successful —
and savings, of course, on
liquor and cigarette bills.
