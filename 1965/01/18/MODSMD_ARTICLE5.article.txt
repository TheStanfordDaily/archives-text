# Depersonalization Seen In Rise Of Reg Ratio?
## 
### DOUG OHMANS 
A recent Daily investigation of registration statistics indicates
that sexual depersonalization at Stanford is on the rise.
Our researchers discovered that last year's male-female under
graduate ratio is even worse in 1965. In 1964 there were 3,864 men
and 1.723 women undergraduates at Stanford (a ratio of 2.24 to I).

Richard J. Boeckl, Stanford's
official statistician, disclosed that
male enrollment has increased by
29. Female enrollment has re
mained unchanged. Thus the new
ratio is 2.2368 to 1. Were the girls
distributed evenly, every Stanford
male undergraduate would be elig
ible for almost 9/20 of the co-ed
of his choice.
Stanford's g r a d u a to schools
have reached the Edge of Coedu
cation. with a ratio of about s'-
to 1.
Academic depersonalization, on
the other hand, is a myth. Any
potentially personable student
should consider the facts.
There is on I y one Social
Thought major at Stanford. Only
one undergraduate and four
graduate students are majoring

in Health Education.
All the students allegedly lost
in the shuffle of General Studies
should not lose hope. At Stanford
there are only two seniors who
are somehow still "00."
