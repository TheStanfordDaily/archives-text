## Illness Believed Caused Of Leap 
### 
A philosophy-graduate student
leaped to his deatli Friday morn
ing from atop 285-foot Hoover
Tower.
Stanley Theodore Horwitz of
Brooklyn, N.Y. was the first per
son ever to jump from the tower.
He had completed three quarters
of graduate work at Stanford
with a straight A record.
Dr. Maurice Osborne of th e
Health Service reports that Hor
witz had suffered from a chronic
intestinal condition.
According to Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler. n note or
other concrete evidence of Hor
witz motives has been found.
However, many officials have
cited the health problem as one
possible reason for the suicide.
Horwitz was taken to the ob
servation tower by a student
guide, Barbara Biasotti, a senior
in Hispanic American Studies.
"He came into the elevator
just as I was getting ready to
leave," she told police, "and asked
to go up."
"I pointed out several places of
interest. He asked me if I were
a student and when I said yes, he
told me that he was a student
too.
"Then he asked if I had to
stay with him. I told him I did,
but he said that lie didn't want to
detain me. I said that it was my
job.
"Ho started to walk from the
east side of the tower toward the
elevator. I looked away briefly.
When I looked back, he was over
the railing on the west side of
the tower. As I looked he let go."
Miss Biasotti was placed under
sedation in the care of a physi
cian.
Horwitz' father is reportedly
unable to come West for the fu
neral. The family will be repre
sented by a cousin. Morris Hor
witz, who resides in San Fran
cisco.
