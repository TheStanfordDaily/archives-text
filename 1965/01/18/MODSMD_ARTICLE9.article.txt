# USC, UCLA WIN
## Indians Lose Twice 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
Starting the weekend atop the
AAWU heap, the Stanford In
dians fell back into the throng
as they lost on successive nights
to SC and UCLA. The Tommy-gun
Trojans riddled the nets at a fan
tastic clip to run away from the
Cards 7.1-59 on Friday night, and
the Bruins did likewise Saturday,
80-66, although the issue was not
decided as early.
Going into the contest confi
dent of controlling the boards,
Stanford found the Trojans and
Bruins had ideas of their own on
the subject. Troy's Allen Young
and John Block won the battle

of the boards in the first encoun

or three shots at the basket.
KJKiAK LACKY and Keith
Erickson combined to dominate
the rebound category the next
night as Erickson pulled down 19
rebounds and Lacey 10. Stan

shots.
Coach Howie Dallmar noted

the Indians' chances and also that
the opening surge of the Trojans
shook them up.
With the score 8-6. the Trojans
ran off 10 straight, points. T hey
scored nine of the first ten times
they came down the court.
AT HALFTIMK, the Trojans
were out in front 45-25, primar
ily on the 17 point first-half per
formance of center John Block,
who is considered erratic but
had a hot hand against the In
dians. Their shooting percentage
at his point was a phenomenal
59 per cent.
An important factor in I he
game was SC's strong defense.
Doug Balcom had the task of
guarding high-scoring Kent
Hinckley and Bill Westphal
hounded Bob Bedell. Bedell man
aged but six points and Hinck
ley 11 which are totals consider
ably below their season averages.
Stanford battled back in the
second half, and in one stretch
even out scored SC 13-1, but the
margin was never less than 14.
TIIE NKXT night, the Indians
faced the Uclans, who the night
before had demolished the Cali
fornia Bears. According to Dall
mar, "all Stanford players played
well," but he quickly pointed out,
