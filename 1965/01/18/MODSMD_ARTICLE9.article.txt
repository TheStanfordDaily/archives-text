# USC, UCLA WIN
## Indians Lose Twice 
### PETER EAKLAND Sports Editor 
Starting the weekend atop the
AAWU heap, the Stanford In
dians fell back into the throng
as they lost on successive nights
to SC and UCLA. The Tommy-gun
Trojans riddled the nets at a fan
tastic clip to run away from the
Cards 7.1-59 on Friday night, and
the Bruins did likewise Saturday,
80-66, although the issue was not
decided as early.
Going into the contest confi
dent of controlling the boards,
Stanford found the Trojans and
Bruins had ideas of their own on
the subject. Troy's Allen Young
and John Block won the battle

of the boards in the first encoun
ter and enabled SC to take two
or three shots at the basket.
KJKiAK LACKY and Keith
Erickson combined to dominate
the rebound category the next
night as Erickson pulled down 19
rebounds and Lacey 10. Stan
ford's Ray Kosanke did a com
mendable .job against the springy
Bruins by grabbing 11 missed
shots.
Coach Howie Dallmar noted
that the loss of the boards killed
the Indians' chances and also that
the opening surge of the Trojans
shook them up.
With the score 8-6. the Trojans
ran off 10 straight, points. T hey
scored nine of the first ten times
they came down the court.
AT HALFTIMK, the Trojans
were out in front 45-25, primar
ily on the 17 point first-half per
formance of center John Block,
who is considered erratic but
had a hot hand against the In
dians. Their shooting percentage
at his point was a phenomenal
59 per cent.
An important factor in I he
game was SC's strong defense.
Doug Balcom had the task of
guarding high-scoring Kent
Hinckley and Bill Westphal
hounded Bob Bedell. Bedell man
aged but six points and Hinck
ley 11 which are totals consider
ably below their season averages.
Stanford battled back in the
second half, and in one stretch
even out scored SC 13-1, but the
margin was never less than 14.
TIIE NKXT night, the Indians
faced the Uclans, who the night
before had demolished the Cali
fornia Bears. According to Dall
mar, "all Stanford players played
well," but he quickly pointed out,
| "UCLA is better than last year."
The chief reason for the im
provement of the Bruins is the
emergence of Erickson as a super
star definitely of All-American
caliber. He was lop scorer for
UCLA with 21 points. Clayton
Raaka defensed Erickson, but
had four fouls at halftime and
fouled out midway through the
second half.
Besides Erickson, the Bruins
had Edgar Larey, Doug Mcintosh,
Gail Goodrich, and Freddie Goss.
And when Coach Wooden wanted
to go to his bench, he had the en
viable choice of Kenny Washing
ton, whom Dallmar considers
"Ihe greatest sixth man in colle
giate baskelball," and soph Mike
Lynn, who is offensively better
I than Mcintosh but lacks his ex
perience.
THE LOSS of Walt Hazzard
has not hurt the Bruins' ability
to set up plays. Dallmar says all
the starting Bruins are a threat
passing offensively.
The Bruins jumped off to a 10-1
lead in the opening minutes, and
: it seemed as if Ihe game would
Ibe nolo contendere. But the In
j dians battled back, and at half
! time were behind 42-33.

Guards Gary Loveridge and]
Kent Hinckley had little trouble !
overcoming the speed and quick
paws of the Bruin press. Love- ;
ridge scored 16 points, a career j
high, and Hinckley added 11.
Bob Bedell, bouncing back|
from a poor effort the night be-|
fore, garnered 22 points to lead
both teams.
The Stanford basketball team is
now idle for a week before resum
ing AAWU competition.
It was the thirteenth victory
for ihe Bruins since they lost their
season opener to Illinois. The
game, played before 12,469 fans i
iit the plush Los Angeles Sports
Arena, also marked the twenty
third consecutive win for UCLA
in conference AAWU play. They
now possess a 1-0 record in the
conference.

that the loss of the boards killed
the Indians' chances and also that
the opening surge of the Trojans
shook them up.
With the score 8-6. the Trojans
ran off 10 straight, points. T hey
scored nine of the first ten times
they came down the court.
AT HALFTIMK, the Trojans
were out in front 45-25, primar
ily on the 17 point first-half per
formance of center John Block,
who is considered erratic but
had a hot hand against the In
dians. Their shooting percentage
at his point was a phenomenal
59 per cent.
An important factor in I he
game was SC's strong defense.
Doug Balcom had the task of
guarding high-scoring Kent
Hinckley and Bill Westphal
hounded Bob Bedell. Bedell man
aged but six points and Hinck
ley 11 which are totals consider
ably below their season averages.
Stanford battled back in the
second half, and in one stretch
even out scored SC 13-1, but the
margin was never less than 14.
TIIE NKXT night, the Indians
faced the Uclans, who the night
before had demolished the Cali
fornia Bears. According to Dall
mar, "all Stanford players played
well," but he quickly pointed out,
| "UCLA is better than last year."
The chief reason for the im
provement of the Bruins is the
emergence of Erickson as a super
star definitely of All-American
caliber. He was lop scorer for
UCLA with 21 points. Clayton
Raaka defensed Erickson, but
had four fouls at halftime and
fouled out midway through the
second half.
Besides Erickson, the Bruins
had Edgar Larey, Doug Mcintosh,
Gail Goodrich, and Freddie Goss.
And when Coach Wooden wanted
to go to his bench, he had the en
viable choice of Kenny Washing
ton, whom Dallmar considers
"Ihe greatest sixth man in colle
giate baskelball," and soph Mike
Lynn, who is offensively better
I than Mcintosh but lacks his ex
perience.
THE LOSS of Walt Hazzard
has not hurt the Bruins' ability
to set up plays. Dallmar says all
the starting Bruins are a threat
passing offensively.
The Bruins jumped off to a 10-1
lead in the opening minutes, and
: it seemed as if Ihe game would
Ibe nolo contendere. But the In
j dians battled back, and at half
! time were behind 42-33.

Guards Gary Loveridge and]
Kent Hinckley had little trouble !
overcoming the speed and quick
paws of the Bruin press. Love- ;
ridge scored 16 points, a career j
high, and Hinckley added 11.
Bob Bedell, bouncing back|
from a poor effort the night be-|
fore, garnered 22 points to lead
both teams.
The Stanford basketball team is
now idle for a week before resum
ing AAWU competition.
It was the thirteenth victory
for ihe Bruins since they lost their
season opener to Illinois. The
game, played before 12,469 fans i
iit the plush Los Angeles Sports
Arena, also marked the twenty
third consecutive win for UCLA
in conference AAWU play. They
now possess a 1-0 record in the
conference.
Starting the weekend atop the
AAWU heap, the Stanford In
dians fell back into the throng
as they lost on successive nights
to SC and UCLA. The Tommy-gun
Trojans riddled the nets at a fan
tastic clip to run away from the
Cards 7.1-59 on Friday night, and
the Bruins did likewise Saturday,
80-66, although the issue was not
decided as early.
Going into the contest confi
dent of controlling the boards,
Stanford found the Trojans and
Bruins had ideas of their own on
the subject. Troy's Allen Young
and John Block won the battle

of the boards in the first encoun
ter and enabled SC to take two
or three shots at the basket.
KJKiAK LACKY and Keith
Erickson combined to dominate
the rebound category the next
night as Erickson pulled down 19
rebounds and Lacey 10. Stan

TIIE NKXT night, the Indians
faced the Uclans, who the night
before had demolished the Cali
fornia Bears. According to Dall
mar, "all Stanford players played
well," but he quickly pointed out,
| "UCLA is better than last year."
The chief reason for the im
provement of the Bruins is the
emergence of Erickson as a super
star definitely of All-American
caliber. He was lop scorer for
UCLA with 21 points. Clayton
Raaka defensed Erickson, but
had four fouls at halftime and
fouled out midway through the
second half.
Besides Erickson, the Bruins
had Edgar Larey, Doug Mcintosh,
Gail Goodrich, and Freddie Goss.
And when Coach Wooden wanted
to go to his bench, he had the en
viable choice of Kenny Washing
ton, whom Dallmar considers
"Ihe greatest sixth man in colle
giate baskelball," and soph Mike
Lynn, who is offensively better
I than Mcintosh but lacks his ex
perience.
THE LOSS of Walt Hazzard
has not hurt the Bruins' ability
to set up plays. Dallmar says all
the starting Bruins are a threat
passing offensively.
The Bruins jumped off to a 10-1
lead in the opening minutes, and
: it seemed as if Ihe game would
Ibe nolo contendere. But the In
j dians battled back, and at half
! time were behind 42-33.

Guards Gary Loveridge and]
Kent Hinckley had little trouble !
overcoming the speed and quick
paws of the Bruin press. Love- ;
ridge scored 16 points, a career j
high, and Hinckley added 11.
Bob Bedell, bouncing back|
from a poor effort the night be-|
fore, garnered 22 points to lead
both teams.
The Stanford basketball team is
now idle for a week before resum
ing AAWU competition.
It was the thirteenth victory
for ihe Bruins since they lost their
season opener to Illinois. The
game, played before 12,469 fans i
iit the plush Los Angeles Sports
Arena, also marked the twenty
third consecutive win for UCLA
in conference AAWU play. They
now possess a 1-0 record in the
conference.
