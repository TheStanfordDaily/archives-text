The Way
To Christian Unity
Perhaps you' vi' frit that Christians were now divided In differences and separ
ated by divergent beliefs. The Hible speaks of Christians as numbers of the universal
"body of Christ", a living, growing organism headed by the Lord Jesus Christ.
To experience the oneness of the body of Christ, Christians need only heed the
lessons of Romans. Chapter IJ. which urges them to give themselves completely to
their Lord, the One who has purchased their bodies as dwelling places for His Holy
Spirit. When this is done Christians discover readily the. love and close abiding
presence of their risen t.ord and the harmony of the smoothly operating, properly
functioning organism which is His church.
"And so, dear brothers, 1 plead with you to give your bodies to Cud. bet them
be a living sacrifice, holy tin kind 111 can accept. When you think of what He
I has done for you is this too much to ask 5 Don't copy the fashions and customs of
I this world, but be a new and different person with a fresh newness in all you do
j and think. Then you will sic from your own experience how His ways will really
satisfy you. As God's messenger 1 give each of you (iod's warning: be honest in
your estimates of yourselves, measuring your value by how much .faith God has
given vnii. For just as tlivrc are many parts to our bodies, so it is with Christ's
body. We are all parts of it.and it takes every one of us to make it complete, for
we each have different work to do. So we belong to each other, and each needs all
tin- other-. God has given each of us the ability to do certain things well. So if
God has given you the ability to prophesy whenever you can as often as your
faith is strong enough to produce a message from God.lf your gift is. that of serving
others, serve them well. Teachers should do a good job of teaching. The preacher
should sei to it that his sermons are strong and helpful. If God has given you money,
be generous in helping others with it. It Cod has given you administrative ability
ami put you in charge oi the work of others, take the responsibility seriously. And
if vottrs is the gift of kindness to others, do it cheerfully. Don't just pretend that
von love others, reallv love them. Hate what is wrong. Stand on the side of the good.
Love, each other w itli brotherly affection and delight to honor each other. Never be
' lazy ill your work but serve the I.ordcnthusiastically, He glad for all God is plan
ning for"you, He patient in trouble, and prayerful always. . . If you love voui neigh
bor a- much as yon luvi >our.-elf you will not want to harm or cheat him. or kill him
or «teal from liiin. And >< u won't sin with his wife, or want what is his. or do any
thing else tin- Ten Commandments mm are wrung. All ten are wrapped up In thi.s
one to love >our neighbor as yourself. Love does no wrong to anyone. That's why
it fully satisfies all of God's requirements. It i- the only la\s you need" ( Romans
IJ:I IJ, 1: V. 10 Living Letters).
Don't be cotu(t iled about organizations and external dilfercncc- Outward ap
peartaiici can be most deceiving. Fin life of Icsus Christ which is freely given to,
ami shared by. all believer- transcends all differences of race.background, and reli
gions beliefs Won't yon give yourself to llim completely and cxpcrienci the ful
fillment of God's love }
