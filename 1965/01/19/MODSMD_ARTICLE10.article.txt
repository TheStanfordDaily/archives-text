## Rushing Activities Will Begin Soon 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
\\ c think that this system w ill
provide a successful rush for
both the freshmen and the fra
ternities, said IFC President
Bill MeGee, commenting on the
IFC rush plan.
IFC rush rules I his year, like
in previous years, will permit
i limited contact during winter
quarter, with actual rush taking
place early in the spring quarter.
Rush will begin with two open
houses during the sixth week of
winter quarter, followed by lawn
parties on the Sunday of the
seventh week. Five freshmen may
eat. meals at each fraternity after
the first open house.
SPRING QUARTER will begin
i with three open houses, Tuesday
through Thursday of the first
week, and three parties, Thurs
day through Saturday. No off
campus contact will be permitted
again until the following Satur
j day when another party is al
lowed.
Bids may be given from 9:30
p.m. Thursday of the first week,
while pledge cards may Ix? signed
on Monday night of the third
week. One optional open house
may be held after the formal
pledging.
McGee said that the rush policy
adopted was essentially the one
proposed by the IFC last spring.
Ai that time there was some con
! troversy over which group should
write rush policy.
AN ATTEMPT to create a com-
Imittee within student govern
j rnent to handle the problem was
1 defeated in the Legislature.
At that time it was decided each
i group would write their own pol
j icy, subject to the approval of
! the Dean of Students.
A rush plan prepared last year
by a committee of the IFC, ICC.
and lIIC Presidents and the head
'sponsor was unacceptable to the
â€¢ IFC. and instead the present sys
tem was approved.
This is the fourth rush plan
I the IFC has adopted in four years.
ONE CONTROVERSIAL part
of ihe proposal that was dropped
by the IFC was a planned "feed
back mechanism" in which th e
I IFC would publish a list, by fra
ternity. of the freshmen that each
fraternity would like to see again.
That would have been in addi
j t.ion to the normal party invita-
I tions sent out by each fraternity
j at the beginning of Spring Quar
j ter.
