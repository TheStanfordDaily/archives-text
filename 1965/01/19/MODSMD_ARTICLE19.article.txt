## NCAA Feud With AAU Hopefully Nearing End 
### Joe Hernandez 
The AAU (Amateur Athletic Union> and the NCAA (National
Collegiate Athletic Association) are engaged in a life or death
struggle for control of amateur athletics in ihe United Stales. The
tempo cf tlie battle is increasing and it seems likely that the troops,
the athletes, will be released by 1967, the year prior to the next
Olympics.
If the breech between the two organizations is not closed by 1967,
our Olympic prospects might be very dim indeed. What could happen
to us is shown by what did happen to Indonesia and North Korea
in the recent Olympic games in Tokyo. Both countries had their best
athletes in swimming and track and field barred from the Olympic
competition because they participated in an unsanctioned interna
tional competition.
SUKARNO'S "GAMES" FAILED
Sukarno staged the "Games for the New Emerging Forces" one
year prior to the Tokyo Olympics. He failed to get the sanction of
the international organization involved, yet he defiantly held ihe
"Games" anyway. Of course, the countries involved did not figure
1o be a power in the Olympics even with their best athletes there.
How far down the ladder would we tumble, though, if we could only
send a token force of third and fourth rate athletes to Mexico City
in 1968.
However, before commending or condemming anyone, a brief
background of the struggle is in order. As it is now, people have
trouble recalling which side they started oui on and exactly why
they are on the side they are on now.
The feud began in 1958 when disgruntled NCAA officials thought
they were being shunted aside when it came to international athletic
affairs. The track coaches of the NCAA were also dismayed at the
way the AAU was handling international competition. Tom Hanson,
assistant to Tom Hamilton who is AAWU commissioner, put it this
way. "The AAU was sending 20 athletes and 50 officials to interna
tional contests."
NCAA REBUFFED BY AAU
The NCAA made overtures to the AAU but nothing came of them.
Then Sports Illustrated magazine ran an article exposing the com
plaints of 50 of our athletes about the AAU. The quoted athletes com
plained about second rate accommodations and travel arrangements
while the army of officials with them availed themselves only of the
best.
This spurred the NCAA to found organizations which directly
competed with AAU groups. One of the first to be founded was in
basketball. According to the New York Times of Sept. 1, 1960, "The
National Association of Basketball Coaches initiated the move to
unseat Ihe AAU. This action came after the AAU had refused to
sanction the tour of a Swedish basketball team in the U.S."
After the 1960 Olympics, the NCAA started the United States
Track and Field Federation. Presently the NCAA is fighting for con
trol of three amateur sports: basketball, track and field, and gym
nastics. The AAU has sports committees for 14 sports.
AAU PART OF A HIERARCHY
The AAU says that it is "a consolidation or coalition of all sports
organizations, local and national. The A All's self-image is then of
a progression of authority. First there are the individual groups such
as the colleges, the- armed forces, etc., then there is ihe organization
of all these groups on the national level, next the national group
represents us in international athletic dealings. The efficacy of this
type of set-up is obvious as it would be unwieldy to say the least if
each country had two or three organizations representing it.
The NCAA, on the other hand, sees itself as an organization on
the same level as the AAU, the only difference being that the AAU
is the recognized international representative.
Th essence of the NCAA argument is that the AAU is doing an
inefficient and sometimes unfair job of administrating athletics and
that the NCAA has a majority of the athletes and almost all of the
coaches—so why should it be subject to the AAU?
INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR 77 YEARS
The crux of the AAU position is that it has been the United States
representative to the International Olympic Committee for over 50
years and there is no need to change.
lOC rule 24 says, "A National Olympic Committee must not recog
nize more than one National Federation in each sport and that Fed
eration must be affiliated to the International Federation recognized
by the International Olympic Committee." Rule 34 of the lOC says,
"As a condition precedent to participation in the Olympic Games, a
competitor must be an amateur as defined in Rule 26, and a member
of the organization in his own country affiliated to Ihe International
Federation recognized by the International Olympic Committee as
governing that sport."
Since the U.S. Olympic Committee is controlled by the same
people that control the AAU it is unlikely in the extreme that any
other organization will through force be recognized as our inter
national representative. But force is exactly how the NCAA is at
tempting to effect the demise of the AAU.

that the NCAA has a majority of the athletes and almost all of the
coaches—so why should it be subject to the AAU?
INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR 77 YEARS
The crux of the AAU position is that it has been the United States
representative to the International Olympic Committee for over 50
years and there is no need to change.
lOC rule 24 says, "A National Olympic Committee must not recog
nize more than one National Federation in each sport and that Fed
eration must be affiliated to the International Federation recognized
by the International Olympic Committee." Rule 34 of the lOC says,
"As a condition precedent to participation in the Olympic Games, a
competitor must be an amateur as defined in Rule 26, and a member
of the organization in his own country affiliated to Ihe International
Federation recognized by the International Olympic Committee as
governing that sport."
Since the U.S. Olympic Committee is controlled by the same
people that control the AAU it is unlikely in the extreme that any
other organization will through force be recognized as our inter
national representative. But force is exactly how the NCAA is at
tempting to effect the demise of the AAU.

(Continual tomorrow)
The AAU (Amateur Athletic Union> and the NCAA (National
Collegiate Athletic Association) are engaged in a life or death
struggle for control of amateur athletics in ihe United Stales. The
tempo cf tlie battle is increasing and it seems likely that the troops,
the athletes, will be released by 1967, the year prior to the next
Olympics.
If the breech between the two organizations is not closed by 1967,
our Olympic prospects might be very dim indeed. What could happen
to us is shown by what did happen to Indonesia and North Korea
in the recent Olympic games in Tokyo. Both countries had their best
athletes in swimming and track and field barred from the Olympic
competition because they participated in an unsanctioned interna
tional competition.
SUKARNO'S "GAMES" FAILED
Sukarno staged the "Games for the New Emerging Forces" one
year prior to the Tokyo Olympics. He failed to get the sanction of
the international organization involved, yet he defiantly held ihe
"Games" anyway. Of course, the countries involved did not figure
1o be a power in the Olympics even with their best athletes there.
How far down the ladder would we tumble, though, if we could only
send a token force of third and fourth rate athletes to Mexico City
in 1968.
However, before commending or condemming anyone, a brief
background of the struggle is in order. As it is now, people have
trouble recalling which side they started oui on and exactly why
they are on the side they are on now.
The feud began in 1958 when disgruntled NCAA officials thought
they were being shunted aside when it came to international athletic
affairs. The track coaches of the NCAA were also dismayed at the
way the AAU was handling international competition. Tom Hanson,
assistant to Tom Hamilton who is AAWU commissioner, put it this
way. "The AAU was sending 20 athletes and 50 officials to interna
tional contests."
NCAA REBUFFED BY AAU
The NCAA made overtures to the AAU but nothing came of them.
Then Sports Illustrated magazine ran an article exposing the com
plaints of 50 of our athletes about the AAU. The quoted athletes com
plained about second rate accommodations and travel arrangements
while the army of officials with them availed themselves only of the
best.
This spurred the NCAA to found organizations which directly
competed with AAU groups. One of the first to be founded was in
basketball. According to the New York Times of Sept. 1, 1960, "The
National Association of Basketball Coaches initiated the move to
unseat Ihe AAU. This action came after the AAU had refused to
sanction the tour of a Swedish basketball team in the U.S."
After the 1960 Olympics, the NCAA started the United States
Track and Field Federation. Presently the NCAA is fighting for con
trol of three amateur sports: basketball, track and field, and gym
nastics. The AAU has sports committees for 14 sports.
AAU PART OF A HIERARCHY
The AAU says that it is "a consolidation or coalition of all sports
organizations, local and national. The A All's self-image is then of
a progression of authority. First there are the individual groups such
as the colleges, the- armed forces, etc., then there is ihe organization
of all these groups on the national level, next the national group
represents us in international athletic dealings. The efficacy of this
type of set-up is obvious as it would be unwieldy to say the least if
each country had two or three organizations representing it.
The NCAA, on the other hand, sees itself as an organization on
the same level as the AAU, the only difference being that the AAU
is the recognized international representative.

sanction the tour of a Swedish basketball team in the U.S."
After the 1960 Olympics, the NCAA started the United States
Track and Field Federation. Presently the NCAA is fighting for con
trol of three amateur sports: basketball, track and field, and gym
nastics. The AAU has sports committees for 14 sports.
AAU PART OF A HIERARCHY
The AAU says that it is "a consolidation or coalition of all sports
organizations, local and national. The A All's self-image is then of
a progression of authority. First there are the individual groups such
as the colleges, the- armed forces, etc., then there is ihe organization
of all these groups on the national level, next the national group
represents us in international athletic dealings. The efficacy of this
type of set-up is obvious as it would be unwieldy to say the least if
each country had two or three organizations representing it.
The NCAA, on the other hand, sees itself as an organization on
the same level as the AAU, the only difference being that the AAU
is the recognized international representative.
Th essence of the NCAA argument is that the AAU is doing an
inefficient and sometimes unfair job of administrating athletics and
that the NCAA has a majority of the athletes and almost all of the
coaches—so why should it be subject to the AAU?
INTERNATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FOR 77 YEARS
The crux of the AAU position is that it has been the United States
representative to the International Olympic Committee for over 50
years and there is no need to change.
lOC rule 24 says, "A National Olympic Committee must not recog
nize more than one National Federation in each sport and that Fed
eration must be affiliated to the International Federation recognized
by the International Olympic Committee." Rule 34 of the lOC says,
"As a condition precedent to participation in the Olympic Games, a
competitor must be an amateur as defined in Rule 26, and a member
of the organization in his own country affiliated to Ihe International
Federation recognized by the International Olympic Committee as
governing that sport."
Since the U.S. Olympic Committee is controlled by the same
people that control the AAU it is unlikely in the extreme that any
other organization will through force be recognized as our inter
national representative. But force is exactly how the NCAA is at
tempting to effect the demise of the AAU.

The AAU (Amateur Athletic Union> and the NCAA (National
Collegiate Athletic Association) are engaged in a life or death
struggle for control of amateur athletics in ihe United Stales. The
tempo cf tlie battle is increasing and it seems likely that the troops,
the athletes, will be released by 1967, the year prior to the next
Olympics.
If the breech between the two organizations is not closed by 1967,
our Olympic prospects might be very dim indeed. What could happen
to us is shown by what did happen to Indonesia and North Korea
in the recent Olympic games in Tokyo. Both countries had their best
athletes in swimming and track and field barred from the Olympic
competition because they participated in an unsanctioned interna
tional competition.
SUKARNO'S "GAMES" FAILED
Sukarno staged the "Games for the New Emerging Forces" one
year prior to the Tokyo Olympics. He failed to get the sanction of
the international organization involved, yet he defiantly held ihe
"Games" anyway. Of course, the countries involved did not figure
1o be a power in the Olympics even with their best athletes there.
How far down the ladder would we tumble, though, if we could only
send a token force of third and fourth rate athletes to Mexico City
in 1968.
However, before commending or condemming anyone, a brief
background of the struggle is in order. As it is now, people have
trouble recalling which side they started oui on and exactly why
they are on the side they are on now.
The feud began in 1958 when disgruntled NCAA officials thought
they were being shunted aside when it came to international athletic
affairs. The track coaches of the NCAA were also dismayed at the
way the AAU was handling international competition. Tom Hanson,
assistant to Tom Hamilton who is AAWU commissioner, put it this
way. "The AAU was sending 20 athletes and 50 officials to interna
tional contests."
NCAA REBUFFED BY AAU
The NCAA made overtures to the AAU but nothing came of them.
Then Sports Illustrated magazine ran an article exposing the com
plaints of 50 of our athletes about the AAU. The quoted athletes com
plained about second rate accommodations and travel arrangements
while the army of officials with them availed themselves only of the
best.
This spurred the NCAA to found organizations which directly
competed with AAU groups. One of the first to be founded was in
basketball. According to the New York Times of Sept. 1, 1960, "The
National Association of Basketball Coaches initiated the move to
unseat Ihe AAU. This action came after the AAU had refused to
sanction the tour of a Swedish basketball team in the U.S."
After the 1960 Olympics, the NCAA started the United States
Track and Field Federation. Presently the NCAA is fighting for con
