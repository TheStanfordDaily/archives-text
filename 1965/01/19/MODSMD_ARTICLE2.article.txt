# Can The Cure Be Worse Than The Darn Disease?
## 
### STAN SMOKER (First in a Series) 
The lights dimmed, on came the music and
the movie, and within minutes, about forty
registrees of the Seventh Day Adventist Five-
Day Plan to stop smoking, including myself,
were watching removal of a blackened, pulsat
ing cancerous lung from the chest of Bill John
son, editor of the small-town "Gutenberg Press."
This flick, designed to scare us into shaking
the tobacco habit, inaugurated the program last
night. The group therapy sessions will run
through Thursday, with a final session Mon
day, from 7:30 to 9 p.m. in Room 320, Geology
Corner.
After the movie, flames \V. Cooper, leader of
the sessions, told us that "in the coming year,
there could he 135,000 deaths directly linked to
smoking," and another 305,000 "possibly con
nectÂ«Ml" to the habit.
Cooper then asked us how many present had
tried before to stop smoking. All of us rather
shamefacedly raised our hands.
Then Cooper and Dr. George Burton of the
Stanford Medical Center outlined techniques
the program would use to break us of the to
bacco habit. They painted a rather gruesome
picture.

"You're in tile grip of an addiction worse
than heroin and other narcotics," Burton stated.
"For the next day or so you many expect
to feel chest pain, nausea, diarrhea, ley cramps,"
and other equally pleasant inflictions. "These
are withdrawal symptoms," he said.
Burton then said that tomorrow we would
Ik- allowed to eat nothing at all. All we can
have is plenty of water.
The doctor also advised us to breathe deeply
when we felt the craving for a cigarette, to
take plenty of warm showers, and take long
walks. In addition, we are to telephone our
partners, assigned last night, for a few encour
aging words when necessary.
Cooper warned us not to promise ourselves
that we wouldn't smoke anymore. "Rather," he
said, "make the decision that, 'I chose not to
smoke.'"
To emphasize this decision, lie even passed
out small cards inscribed with those famous
last words.
Burton then predicted shaking the habit
could give us au extra eight years of life as
well as $150 a year on cigarettes.
But, as 3 sit and stare at that little card, I
wonder if the cure can possibly be better than
the disease.
