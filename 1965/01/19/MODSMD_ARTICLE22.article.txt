# The 						New GOP
## 
### 
The announcement last week that Ray Bliss,
Ohio GOP chairman, will replace Dean Burch in
April as Republican National Chairman, and the
reaction to that announcement, should evoke a
sigh of genuine relief from most Republicans, as
well as from Democrats who favor a strong two
party system.
By forming what appears to be a center-right
coalition, the conservatives have avoided a show
down which could have crippled the party for
years, whether Burch had remained in "control'
or been ousted.
With the support of Goldwater and the mod
erates as well as the GOP liberals (who were
never in position to regain control), Bliss should
be able to unify the party and build a strong
organization to back Republican candidates in
1966.
The conservatives were faced with a dilemma
which some still refuse to admit. Either they
could have won a narrow victory to keep Burch
in power, in which case they would have pre
sided for the next four years over a party torn
by internecine struggle between factions which
threatened to form their own extra-party organi

zations. Or they could do what tliey did: com
promise with the moderates to give the party a
new leadership which will pay attention to con
servative opinions and desires in formulating
policy.
If a compromise had not been made and Bliss
selected with Goldwater's blessings, the conser
vatives might eventually have faced a center-left
coalition, leaving them in the same position they
were before they nominated Gold water last July.
There are those who regret that the conser
vatives were not ousted completely. This position
fails to take into account the real conservative
power and the likely loss to the Republican Part)'
of a vast volunteer force and much financial
backing, if that power is ever ignored. A moder
ate-liberal , "mc-too" coalition would have crip
pled the party just as much as continued all
conservative control.
The compromise reached suggests that the
Grand Old Party cannot be counted out yet.
Under the leadership of Ray Bliss and a politi
cally realistic conservative majority, it may yet
provide an effective and healthy opposition and
assert a beneficial restraint on the Great Society.
