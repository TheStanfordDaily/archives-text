## The
						Contemporary Christians Cause Campus Controversy 
### 
Our Message to the Christians
Today:
We wish to make clear that our
letter in yesterday's Daily was
intended only as a demonstration
of the kind of insult to which
your fellow Christians have sub
jected us. We felt that we could
in no other way communicate so
forcefully the rude intolerance
and disrespect which were clearly
implied in the advertisements re
cently placed by the Contempo
rary Christians on Campus.
\Ve had no desire to compete
for converts. Our only design was
to reproduce in you by a reverse
imitation the same anger and
distress which we felt when we
read the advertisements directed
toward us. We hope that those of
you whom we have offended will
direct your justifiable anger
against those who, rather than
offering to everyone the moral
and spiritual alternative to which
they are committed, would dis
parage our beliefs and provoke
discord between two peacefully
coexistant faiths.
INDIGNANT JEWS
OX CAMPUS
EDITOR'S NOTK: Lest there
foe any doubt, the "Indignant
.Jews on Campus" do not in any
way represent campus Jewish
opinion, only the opinions of
the writers. Their signatures
have ben withheld at their re
quest, with the feeling that
their comments on the Contem
porary Christians advertise
ment were of interest to much
of our readership.
• Similar Ethical Goals
Dear Sir:
The letter which appeared in
yesterday's Daily (Jan. IS),
signed, 'Indigant Jews on Cam

pus,' is unfortunate because it
'expresses attitudes which run
| counter to the feelings of the
j great majority of Jews. Judaism
is not a proselytizing religion and
has no active missionary service.
Furthermore, one of the foremost
I aspects of Judaism is respect and
i tolerance for other ways of life,
I in this case Christianity, especi
' ally since the ethical goals of both
are substantially the same.
Yours very truly,
MIKE BUSH

• Saviour's Bandwagon
Dear Sir:
We wish to thank the Contem
porary Christians on Campus for
! their good tidings (to the Jews)
jof 15 January. It is especially
heartwarming that such news ar
rives so shortly after the season
of goodwill.
How blessed can a people be!
We are a "most unusual and
unique family among nations . . .
|having| survived thousands of
; years of dispersal and persecu
tion." Still, we "have maintained
an identity, culture, and religion
through thick and thin." This ap
pears to be a remarkable accom
plishment.
But wait, there is more! The
! CCC has made a request and con
j fidently expects us to respond in
our customary "this-too-we-can
bear" manner. We are urged to
make the ultimate contribution to
the God of Israel; ecstatically we
must jump on the Saviour's glori
ous bandwagon.
Is the ability to forsake one's
religion while maintaining one's
religious identity peculiar to Iho
Jew? If so, we are honored, and
we are also grateful for the con
certed efforts of our missionary
acquaintances to align our mis
guided zeal. If we are slow to
respond, be patient —note that
j some of our best friends are
Christians.
Yours truly,
CHARLES TUBMAN

• Be Careful, Bicyclists!
Dear Sir:
We wish to remind all bicyclists I
thai especially at this time of
year when we have inclement
weather and early darkness, a spe
cial effort should be made to
observe all traffic regulations.
Several bicycle paths have been
provided in the past few years
so that bicyclists would not have
to ride in the streets where there
is heavy traffic. These paths are
for your safety and convenience
and should be used.
Persons who wear dark cloth
ing and ride without lights and
reflectors on their bicycles at
night are increasing their chances
of becoming a mere statistic. Ac
cording to the National Safety
Council, last year 60,200 bicyclists
were injured in traffic accidents.
We encourage every bicyclist
to follow these simple but sen
sible safety rules:
1. Observe all traffic regula- j
tions. Ride at a safe speed; stop
and look both ways before cross
ing intersections.
2. Bicycles should have white
light on front and reflector or red
light on rear for night riding.
Bicyclists should wear white or
light-colored clothing at night.
3. Give pedestrians the right of
way. Don't ride in the arcades.
4. Ride in a straight line. Do
not weave in or out of traffic or
swerve from side to side.
Your assistance will be appre- (
dated.
