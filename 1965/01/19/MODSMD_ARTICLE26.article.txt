# STERLING'S INNUENDOS
## What Stanford Destructive Elements Are Really Like 
### TOM GALBRAITH 
I Fred Frosh: Golly geo, I just didn't understand all those innuendos I
in President Sterling's speech. 1 must have missed half of it, at
least.
, Upperclassnian: That's because you're new here. You lack the pene
trating understanding of campus life that our chief administra
tor has, but that can be rectified. Come with me tonight, and
I'll show you exactly what he was talking about. . . .
(Midnight that night. Scene: An old, abandoned
brothel in the foothills)
Upperclassnian: Well, this is it, the secret headquarters of S.A.D.E.:
j Fred: What's that?
j Upperclassnian: Stanford Association of Destructive Elements, what
else? Let's go inside. Excuse me if I refer to people by letters !
instead of names; it's part of our depersonalization scheme.
(Inside)
, Member X: Actually, Fred, the abolition of names is only one of our
depersonalizing ideas. In general we try to stage as many off!
campus demonstrations as possible in order to detract students' i
attention from the campus and break down their feeling of!
identity with the school. Naturally it doesn't matter what the i
demonstration is about; in fact, we usually try to get people
demonstrating on both sides of a question. You get more people
into the act that way.
Member W: Our newest plan is to insideously convince the admin
istration that they ought to hire 500 more T.A.'s, so that Stan
ford can become as impersonal as Harvard.
I Member Y: Of course, we have many other functions, but it's hard
to define them, because we don't have any positive program. I
We just get together to be destructive in any way possible.
; Professor '/«: That's right, but we really have 1o watch it. Recently j
we had to expell one member who actually went down to Mis-!
sissippi, worked without pay, and risked his life for idealistic
reasons, instead of to gain applause on campus as most of us did.
! Member X: It was heart-breaking that we didn't get more.
Fred: Don't your different aims conflict sometimes. It would seem
that since a number of the faculty are engaged in some of the
same concerns, you would probably get some contact with them,
and thus personalize some of your life at Stanford?
Member Y: That is a danger, but we try to avoid it by talking only
about nonacadcmic things like the Berkeley riots, Civil Rights,
and politics. Of course, it doesn't always work.
! Fred: Are all of you here from Stanford?
| Member \V: Well, most of us are, but there are a couple hundred
professional rioters too, and, of course, the usual jovial crew
of felons and rapists.
i Fred: Do you have any plans for expansion?
j Member X: Not really. We had thought of joining SPECTRA for
a while, but we're afraid of James Bond.

a while, but we're afraid of James Bond.
I Fred Frosh: Golly geo, I just didn't understand all those innuendos I
in President Sterling's speech. 1 must have missed half of it, at
least.
, Upperclassnian: That's because you're new here. You lack the pene
trating understanding of campus life that our chief administra
tor has, but that can be rectified. Come with me tonight, and
I'll show you exactly what he was talking about. . . .
(Midnight that night. Scene: An old, abandoned
brothel in the foothills)
Upperclassnian: Well, this is it, the secret headquarters of S.A.D.E.:
j Fred: What's that?
j Upperclassnian: Stanford Association of Destructive Elements, what
else? Let's go inside. Excuse me if I refer to people by letters !
instead of names; it's part of our depersonalization scheme.
(Inside)
, Member X: Actually, Fred, the abolition of names is only one of our
depersonalizing ideas. In general we try to stage as many off!
campus demonstrations as possible in order to detract students' i
attention from the campus and break down their feeling of!
identity with the school. Naturally it doesn't matter what the i
demonstration is about; in fact, we usually try to get people
demonstrating on both sides of a question. You get more people
into the act that way.
Member W: Our newest plan is to insideously convince the admin
istration that they ought to hire 500 more T.A.'s, so that Stan
ford can become as impersonal as Harvard.
I Member Y: Of course, we have many other functions, but it's hard
to define them, because we don't have any positive program. I
We just get together to be destructive in any way possible.
; Professor '/«: That's right, but we really have 1o watch it. Recently j
we had to expell one member who actually went down to Mis-!
sissippi, worked without pay, and risked his life for idealistic
reasons, instead of to gain applause on campus as most of us did.
! Member X: It was heart-breaking that we didn't get more.
Fred: Don't your different aims conflict sometimes. It would seem
that since a number of the faculty are engaged in some of the
same concerns, you would probably get some contact with them,
and thus personalize some of your life at Stanford?
Member Y: That is a danger, but we try to avoid it by talking only
about nonacadcmic things like the Berkeley riots, Civil Rights,
and politics. Of course, it doesn't always work.
! Fred: Are all of you here from Stanford?
| Member \V: Well, most of us are, but there are a couple hundred
professional rioters too, and, of course, the usual jovial crew
of felons and rapists.
i Fred: Do you have any plans for expansion?
j Member X: Not really. We had thought of joining SPECTRA for
a while, but we're afraid of James Bond.
