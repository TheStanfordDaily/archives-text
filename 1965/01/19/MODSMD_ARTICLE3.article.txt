## Panel Urges War Tax Refusal 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
"Refusal to pay 60 per cent of
your income tax is not the final
answer to today's problems; it
is only a personal response. What
we need is a viable alternative to
war."
So spoke Roy Kepler, a local
bookstore owner, as part of a
three-man panel featuring Joan
Baez last night before a large
crowd in Memorial Auditorium.
Miss Baez agreed that her tax
refusal was not conspicuously
successful, at least financially.
But she defended her action, "I
decided to stop contributing to
the war effort . . . Love and peace
and freedom have become just
words . . . Perhaps you can argue
that good men can kill bad men,
but no one can justify killing
children, be they Chinese, Rus
sian or English."
IKA SANDPEKL, the third
member of the panel, urged Hie
audience to reject the premise
that good men can kill bad men
and instead substitute the dictum
that "Thou shalt not kill."
"Peace is a process, and to get
it we can't prepare for war; we
have to refuse to acquiesce and
be passive. Don't allow your
money, your body or your brains
to be used by a nation state . . .
This tax refusal will be a national
effort this year. Taxes are always
a tool of revolution and that's
what we are out for a revolution
to end murder."
EARLIER, Keplc ?r li a d con
mented on the "ambivalence" of
our society as demonstrated by
the irony surrounding President
Kennedy's assassination. "A man
of peace had been killed and was
buried by the military with mili
tary paraphernalia all around
him.
Me accused the U.S. of violating
its own legal and moral premises
as utilized at Nuremburg; namely
that those who start wars can be
tried for crimes against human
ity.
"Now we imitate the immoral
ity of our enemy in order to con
test him . . . We are now ready
to kill hundreds of millions just
to forward our own little idea."
Later, Kepler was asked to ex
plain how he could rail the U.S.
defense effort immoral while
keeping "an abundance of porno
graphy" in his book store. Kep
ler rejoined that "whereas I'm
opposed to war and violence, I'm I
hi la\or o| se\."


JOAN BAEZ managed to sooth a somewhat riled audience at the
end of a tumultuous questioning period during last night's "War
Tax Refusal ' program in Memorial Auditorium with her rendi
tions of "God Is On Our Side,' "The Times They Are A-Changing,"
and "Blowin In The Wind.
