Upton Sinclair, famed lor his
muckraking technique for in
stituting social reform, turned
storyteller before a capacity
crowd at Cul)berle\ Auditorium
last nitflit.
The speech was sponsored by
.the lIR, the Political Union and
the Young Democrats.
THE EVENING'S theme urged
that "You don't have to be satis
lied with America, you can
change it." And with that he dis
cussed his own reform of the Ar
mour's and ttie Fords.
Sinclair' related how. as a young
man, he had heard of the brutal
ity in which the strike of the Chi
cago stock yard workers was
beaten down. He garbed himself
in the role of a worker* and for
six weeks witnessed tlie horrors
of the yard.
Until the night on which ho
was to leave, ho did not have any
characters to put into his novel.
He found those character's in the
roar of a saloon, celebrating a
wedding. The novel that was born
from this pit of attrocitios was
The Jungle.
UPTON SINCLAIR'S outcry
for reform was not well received
at tirst by the publishers, but
after verifying his claims the
story of brutality was told to the
public. The major outcome of The
Jungle was to bolster Teddy
Roosevelt's drive to push Ihrough
Congress a series of reform bills.
Sinclair continued with the
story of how he reformed his old
friend, Henry Ford. The workers
strike in Detroit had run up
against an immoveable and brutal
stand by Ford. Sinclair penned a
pamphlet which crumbled the
monolith of Ford's conviction, but
he attributed the final thrust of
reform to Ford's wife, who swore
she would leave him if he did not
negotiate with the union.
DURING THE question per iod,
Sinclair discussed (he era of "hard
times." He said it was the result
of the big manufacturers hoard- j
ing their profits in vaults instead
of re-investing them in further
production. Sinclair called for a
fixed living wage in which the
profits of production would be
divided among labor.
