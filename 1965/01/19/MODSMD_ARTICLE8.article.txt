L'pton Sinclair entertained a capacity crowd in Tresiddei
last night, with stories about his arrests and reforms which lit
helped to bring about.
lie also told of his experiences while running for Governor
of California in 1934 on tho EPIC (End Poverty In California)

[â€¢Ticket.
His first arrest was one of the
i most comical, ho claimed. He was
| a college student when he was
| charged with breaking the law in
j Delaware for playing tennis on
| Sunday.
BECAUSE SINCLAIR refused
; to pay the $1.00 fine, he was jailed
i for 21 hours in the State Prison
! since there were no other .jails
available.
While picketing the office of
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., in mourn
ing black crepe in protest against
conditions in a Ludlow, Colo., min
ing camp owned by the Rockefel
lers, which had resulted in the
death by fire of several people,
the then, 86-year-old reformer,
was arrested for the second time.
After refusing to pay the $3.00
fine, he was sentenced to three
days in The Tombs, a New York
City jail, and after serving two
days, paid a $1.00 fine so he would
be released and be able to appeal
1 he case.
WINDING IT his talk, the ex
candidate for Governor told what
his EPIC party accomplished. By
starting small, self-help groups
which grew into collective factor
ies, support was gained and atten
tion was gained for the need of
a national relief program.
Sinclair claimed that EPIC
"scared the wits out of the ruling
classes of America and they
haven't alio wo d a depression
since."


UPTON SINCLAIR, noted author and reformer, spoke to large
groups on campus at two lectures yesterday. The writer of The
Jungle took time to shake hands with Tim Ingram, president of
the Young Democrats, which sponsored Sinclair's visit.
