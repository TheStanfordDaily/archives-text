"Ill Stand on My Record"
Are you proud of your past accomplishments? God has something to say to
all classes of men, including those who want to stand on their own record of
performance and achievements. Unfortunately God's standards are very high,
and His performance requirements and specifications have been fulfilled by
only one man. This one man, Jesus Christ said, ' You therefore must be perfect
as your heavenly Father is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). Writing under direction
of the Spirit of God the Apostle James says, "For whoever keeps the whole
law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it" (James 2.10).
As much as men like to believe that they are basically good underneath,
the New Testament shatters this illusion in no uncertain terms: "There is none
righteous, no, not one; no one understands, no one seeks for God. All have
turned aside, together they have gone wrong; no one does good, not even
one . . . Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are
under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped and the whole world may
be held accountable to God" (Romans 3:10-19). Thus, standing on one s own
record before a holy and just God is shaky business indeed.
Those who wish to stand on their own record, however, get precisely that
opportunity, when, following their physical death, they are brought into the
presence of the Holy Judge, Jesus Christ:
"Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat upon it, from His pres
ence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them. And I saw the
; dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened.
; And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, by what they
had done. And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and
Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were judged by what
they had done. Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire, and
if any one's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown
into the lake of fire" (Revelation 20:11-15).
The lake of fire, which pictures the torment of the lost eternally cut off
I from a God of love, need not be the place where you spend endless ages after
your short soiourn on earth.
Fortunately, no one needs to stand on his own record bfeore God. He does
not desire that any should perish, but is anxious and able to rescue any in
dividual. It is only necessary to acknowledge and receive Jesus Christ, Whose
saving life and delivering power is made available freely to all believers as
it has been through all ages. Don't stay lost, invite Jesus Christ in today, and
stand on His rccord.
"And this is the record, that God has given to us eternal life, and this
life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life, and he who has not the Son has
not life" (I John 5:11, 12).
