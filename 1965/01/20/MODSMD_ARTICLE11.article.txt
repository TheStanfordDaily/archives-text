## Magazine Feature Of New Program 
### SHERRY ROSEN 
"English 4" is the proposed
course title for the experimental
section of Freshman English
scheduled to begin next fall, ac
cording to Dean Robert J.
Wert.
Approved by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education,
the new freshman program will
aim at more creative activities
and hopefully offer "something
more than an extension of high
school English."
Under the direction of profes
sors Albert J. Guerard and Al
fred Appel. Jr., the new plan calls
tor small creative sections to re
place English 2 or 3 for a few
students who have demonstrated
both ability and ambition.
These ten sections of about 12
students each will be drawn from
regular sections us well as Spe
cial English. They will be con
corned with such topics as fiction
and poetry writing, playwriting,
literary criticism, scientific writ
ing. and social criticism.
KXTKNDIN(J the influence of
the Freshman English course out
side the classroom, cultural ac
tivities for the dormitories have
also been suggested. These activi
ties, supervised by members of
th e Freshman English staff,
would nevertheless not offer
Freshman English credit. How
ever, 'group activity" credit may
be involved.
Under this plan, co-educational
groups would be formed to meet
and arrange such activities as a
student art show, fiction and
poetry readings, and writing con
tests. Also proposed are student
panels, film series of art or avant
garde films, an d discussions
in such areas as movie criticism,
civil rights, and educational aims.
Adapting the formula used by
the American Academy for many
issues of their literary magazine.

versity of interests and talents
would hold several meetings to
discuss the possible topic for an
isue of a high quality magazine.
Temporarily chaired by a member
of the Freshman English staff.

Approved by the Commit
tee on Undergraduate Education,
the new freshman program will
aim at more creative activities
and hopefully offer "something
more than an extension of high
school English."
Under the direction of profes
sors Albert J. Guerard and Al
fred Appel. Jr., the new plan calls
tor small creative sections to re
place English 2 or 3 for a few
students who have demonstrated
both ability and ambition.
These ten sections of about 12
students each will be drawn from
regular sections us well as Spe
cial English. They will be con
corned with such topics as fiction
and poetry writing, playwriting,
literary criticism, scientific writ
ing. and social criticism.
KXTKNDIN(J the influence of
the Freshman English course out
side the classroom, cultural ac
tivities for the dormitories have
also been suggested. These activi
ties, supervised by members of
th e Freshman English staff,
would nevertheless not offer
Freshman English credit. How
ever, 'group activity" credit may
be involved.
Under this plan, co-educational
groups would be formed to meet
and arrange such activities as a
student art show, fiction and
poetry readings, and writing con
tests. Also proposed are student
panels, film series of art or avant
garde films, an d discussions
in such areas as movie criticism,
civil rights, and educational aims.
Adapting the formula used by
the American Academy for many
issues of their literary magazine.

freshman literary magazine or
paperback. A preliminary plan

hand-picked freshmen with a di
versity of interests and talents
would hold several meetings to
discuss the possible topic for an
isue of a high quality magazine.
Temporarily chaired by a member
of the Freshman English staff.

the Autumn Quarter.
AFTKK CHOOSING a topic,
this committee would select a
larger group of about 33-40 fresh
