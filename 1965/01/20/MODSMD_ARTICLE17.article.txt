# SPORTS SHOTS
## AAU, NCAA Utilizing Athletes As Battlefield 
### Joe Hernandez 
(Second of a Two-Part Series)
The AAWU of which Stanford is a member adopted the NCAA |
I boycott of the AAU in Jnne, 19(32. This boycott, forbids Stanford
I athletes or coaches from participating in AAU events and also pre- j
vents the AAU from using any of our facilities.
This fight can best be understood in terms of track and field, j
but it applies to all sports.
The heart of the matter is thai ihe AAU insists that it must j
maintain its position as the sole sanctioning body for open meets!
while the NCAA says that it should be able to sanction the collegiate j
portion ol" open meets. Closed competition is defined as competition |
among members of any one organization. Open competition involves i
more than one organization.
If the NCAA means that it should be able to sanction open meets j
in which collegians compete along with non-collegians in view ol' j
[existing international rules the U.S. could be in trouble. Dual sanc
tions of international events is strictly forbidden by rule 24 of the
International Olympic Committee.
A MOKE WORKABLE PLAN?
The NCAA also wants to control the college athletes during thej
time they are out of school through tho sanction power. Perhaps a'
more feasible idea would be for the athletes to be allowed to com- j
pete freely with the individual colleges as the only one to say when !
their athletes should not compete.
What the NCAA could do is to sanction the individual athletes
by saying whether or not they (NCAA) thought the athletes should
compete or not. The NCAA cannot under the existing lOC rules, and j
as long as the AAU is an entity, sponsor an open track meet.
At the recent NCAA meeting in Chicago, Walter Byers, Execu- I
tive Director of the NCAA, proposed that schools failing to support !
the boycott of the AAU be punished with the same severity as
schools convicted of illegal recruiting or of payoffs. That is, if Stan
ford entered an AAU meet we could be barred for one year from
participating in any post season events, for instance the Rose Bowl.
Fortunately, the motion never got anywhere. What the NCAA
did, in fact, was to make another attempt to get along with the AAU.
They voted to discuss dual sanctions with the AAU. It is a Russian
compromise. The NCAA has invaded AAU territory and is now
offering to bend back a little. What a compromise.
COACHES RETICENT TO TALK
Who originally was on which side and who is on which side now,
is not an easy question to answer. For one thing, the NCAA has taken
the official stance that it most assuredly frowns upon coaches who
criticize the NCAA position.
Chuck Taylor, Stanford's Director of Athletics, says,"the track
and field coaches have their own association and four or five years
ago they voted to start their own federation (USTFF)." The methods
: of the USTFF have apparently softened the once firm resolve of
| the people involved. In 1964 sixty-four IC4A schools, eight Ivy
League universities, and 380 small colleges voted not to boycott the
AAU.
In our own conference it seems that there is a divergence of opin
ion between the track coaches and the upper hierarchies who decide
| athletic policy. Curley Grieve among other sources said of a recent
: AAWU meeting, "The track coaches of the AAWU voted unani
mously not to boycott the AAU but the motion was tabled from
I higher up."
ATHLETES MISS OUT OX MEETS
Payton Jordan, Stanford's track coach, says,"It is unfortunate
| that the kids lose opportunities to participate freely in competition
during their collegiate careers because of a fight that is not their
j doing." And this is precisely what is happening. At the AAU spon
!] sored track meet at the Cow Palace during December, Stanford ath
letes were prevented from competing.
Perhaps more of the trouble than people realize has as its foun- 1
j tainhead the manner in which the leadership of the two groups is |
! designed. The AAU is run by a president, who is elected by the I
district chairmen who are boosted into their positions by the ath- •
I letes and coaches themselves. Col. Don Hull, longtime Executive Di-
I rector of the AAU. is responsible to the president of the organization.
At the top of the NCAA there is also an Executive Director. And j
1 there is an elected president too. But whal a difference. The execu-)
tive Director of the NCAA, Waller Byers, is the one who gives the i
orders and who has the power and the only thing that could get I
him out of office would be for the athletic powers that be, in each
i university, to do the impossible agree. Agree that Byers' indefinite;
term of office should be terminated.
Newly elected AAU president Clifford Buck has expressed a ;
; hope that a solution is possible. He steadfastly maintains, though, j
| thai he cannot abrogate his opposition to dual sanction.
AAU HAS MADE MISTAKES
Basically the question can be formulated thus: is it worth making j
j today's athletes suffer in order to overthrow an established organi
zation. which, although it has made mistakes (so has the NCAA, for
{example the college basketball scandal in the early 50's) is trying
i to improve itself?
If the NCAA is sincerely interested in the athletes, they will stop
| using the athletes as pieces in their athletic game of chess, and they
; will search for ways to stay out of the familiar "Liltle League" syn
drome in which the parents take the g;ime away from the kids.

I athletes or coaches from participating in AAU events and also pre- j
vents the AAU from using any of our facilities.
This fight can best be understood in terms of track and field, j
but it applies to all sports.
The heart of the matter is thai ihe AAU insists that it must j
maintain its position as the sole sanctioning body for open meets!
while the NCAA says that it should be able to sanction the collegiate j
portion ol" open meets. Closed competition is defined as competition |
among members of any one organization. Open competition involves i
more than one organization.
If the NCAA means that it should be able to sanction open meets j
in which collegians compete along with non-collegians in view ol' j
[existing international rules the U.S. could be in trouble. Dual sanc
tions of international events is strictly forbidden by rule 24 of the
International Olympic Committee.
A MOKE WORKABLE PLAN?
The NCAA also wants to control the college athletes during thej
time they are out of school through tho sanction power. Perhaps a'
more feasible idea would be for the athletes to be allowed to com- j
pete freely with the individual colleges as the only one to say when !
their athletes should not compete.
What the NCAA could do is to sanction the individual athletes
by saying whether or not they (NCAA) thought the athletes should
compete or not. The NCAA cannot under the existing lOC rules, and j
as long as the AAU is an entity, sponsor an open track meet.
At the recent NCAA meeting in Chicago, Walter Byers, Execu- I
tive Director of the NCAA, proposed that schools failing to support !
the boycott of the AAU be punished with the same severity as
schools convicted of illegal recruiting or of payoffs. That is, if Stan
ford entered an AAU meet we could be barred for one year from
participating in any post season events, for instance the Rose Bowl.
Fortunately, the motion never got anywhere. What the NCAA
did, in fact, was to make another attempt to get along with the AAU.
They voted to discuss dual sanctions with the AAU. It is a Russian
compromise. The NCAA has invaded AAU territory and is now
offering to bend back a little. What a compromise.
COACHES RETICENT TO TALK
Who originally was on which side and who is on which side now,
is not an easy question to answer. For one thing, the NCAA has taken
the official stance that it most assuredly frowns upon coaches who
criticize the NCAA position.
Chuck Taylor, Stanford's Director of Athletics, says,"the track
and field coaches have their own association and four or five years
ago they voted to start their own federation (USTFF)." The methods
: of the USTFF have apparently softened the once firm resolve of
| the people involved. In 1964 sixty-four IC4A schools, eight Ivy
League universities, and 380 small colleges voted not to boycott the
AAU.
In our own conference it seems that there is a divergence of opin
ion between the track coaches and the upper hierarchies who decide
| athletic policy. Curley Grieve among other sources said of a recent
: AAWU meeting, "The track coaches of the AAWU voted unani
mously not to boycott the AAU but the motion was tabled from
I higher up."
ATHLETES MISS OUT OX MEETS
Payton Jordan, Stanford's track coach, says,"It is unfortunate
| that the kids lose opportunities to participate freely in competition
during their collegiate careers because of a fight that is not their
j doing." And this is precisely what is happening. At the AAU spon
!] sored track meet at the Cow Palace during December, Stanford ath
letes were prevented from competing.
Perhaps more of the trouble than people realize has as its foun- 1
j tainhead the manner in which the leadership of the two groups is |
! designed. The AAU is run by a president, who is elected by the I
district chairmen who are boosted into their positions by the ath- •
I letes and coaches themselves. Col. Don Hull, longtime Executive Di-
I rector of the AAU. is responsible to the president of the organization.
At the top of the NCAA there is also an Executive Director. And j
1 there is an elected president too. But whal a difference. The execu-)
tive Director of the NCAA, Waller Byers, is the one who gives the i
orders and who has the power and the only thing that could get I
him out of office would be for the athletic powers that be, in each
i university, to do the impossible agree. Agree that Byers' indefinite;
term of office should be terminated.
Newly elected AAU president Clifford Buck has expressed a ;
; hope that a solution is possible. He steadfastly maintains, though, j
| thai he cannot abrogate his opposition to dual sanction.
AAU HAS MADE MISTAKES
Basically the question can be formulated thus: is it worth making j
j today's athletes suffer in order to overthrow an established organi
zation. which, although it has made mistakes (so has the NCAA, for
{example the college basketball scandal in the early 50's) is trying
i to improve itself?
If the NCAA is sincerely interested in the athletes, they will stop
| using the athletes as pieces in their athletic game of chess, and they
; will search for ways to stay out of the familiar "Liltle League" syn
drome in which the parents take the g;ime away from the kids.

but it applies to all sports.
The heart of the matter is thai ihe AAU insists that it must j
maintain its position as the sole sanctioning body for open meets!
while the NCAA says that it should be able to sanction the collegiate j
portion ol" open meets. Closed competition is defined as competition |
among members of any one organization. Open competition involves i
more than one organization.
If the NCAA means that it should be able to sanction open meets j
in which collegians compete along with non-collegians in view ol' j
[existing international rules the U.S. could be in trouble. Dual sanc
tions of international events is strictly forbidden by rule 24 of the
International Olympic Committee.
A MOKE WORKABLE PLAN?
The NCAA also wants to control the college athletes during thej
time they are out of school through tho sanction power. Perhaps a'
more feasible idea would be for the athletes to be allowed to com- j
pete freely with the individual colleges as the only one to say when !
their athletes should not compete.
What the NCAA could do is to sanction the individual athletes
by saying whether or not they (NCAA) thought the athletes should
compete or not. The NCAA cannot under the existing lOC rules, and j
as long as the AAU is an entity, sponsor an open track meet.
At the recent NCAA meeting in Chicago, Walter Byers, Execu- I
tive Director of the NCAA, proposed that schools failing to support !
the boycott of the AAU be punished with the same severity as
schools convicted of illegal recruiting or of payoffs. That is, if Stan
ford entered an AAU meet we could be barred for one year from
participating in any post season events, for instance the Rose Bowl.
Fortunately, the motion never got anywhere. What the NCAA
did, in fact, was to make another attempt to get along with the AAU.
They voted to discuss dual sanctions with the AAU. It is a Russian
compromise. The NCAA has invaded AAU territory and is now
offering to bend back a little. What a compromise.
COACHES RETICENT TO TALK
Who originally was on which side and who is on which side now,
is not an easy question to answer. For one thing, the NCAA has taken
the official stance that it most assuredly frowns upon coaches who
criticize the NCAA position.
Chuck Taylor, Stanford's Director of Athletics, says,"the track
and field coaches have their own association and four or five years
ago they voted to start their own federation (USTFF)." The methods
: of the USTFF have apparently softened the once firm resolve of
| the people involved. In 1964 sixty-four IC4A schools, eight Ivy
League universities, and 380 small colleges voted not to boycott the
AAU.
In our own conference it seems that there is a divergence of opin
ion between the track coaches and the upper hierarchies who decide
| athletic policy. Curley Grieve among other sources said of a recent
: AAWU meeting, "The track coaches of the AAWU voted unani
mously not to boycott the AAU but the motion was tabled from
I higher up."
ATHLETES MISS OUT OX MEETS
Payton Jordan, Stanford's track coach, says,"It is unfortunate
| that the kids lose opportunities to participate freely in competition
during their collegiate careers because of a fight that is not their
j doing." And this is precisely what is happening. At the AAU spon
!] sored track meet at the Cow Palace during December, Stanford ath
letes were prevented from competing.
Perhaps more of the trouble than people realize has as its foun- 1
j tainhead the manner in which the leadership of the two groups is |
! designed. The AAU is run by a president, who is elected by the I
district chairmen who are boosted into their positions by the ath- •
I letes and coaches themselves. Col. Don Hull, longtime Executive Di-
I rector of the AAU. is responsible to the president of the organization.
At the top of the NCAA there is also an Executive Director. And j
1 there is an elected president too. But whal a difference. The execu-)
tive Director of the NCAA, Waller Byers, is the one who gives the i
orders and who has the power and the only thing that could get I
him out of office would be for the athletic powers that be, in each
i university, to do the impossible agree. Agree that Byers' indefinite;
term of office should be terminated.
Newly elected AAU president Clifford Buck has expressed a ;
; hope that a solution is possible. He steadfastly maintains, though, j
| thai he cannot abrogate his opposition to dual sanction.
AAU HAS MADE MISTAKES
Basically the question can be formulated thus: is it worth making j
j today's athletes suffer in order to overthrow an established organi
zation. which, although it has made mistakes (so has the NCAA, for
{example the college basketball scandal in the early 50's) is trying
i to improve itself?
If the NCAA is sincerely interested in the athletes, they will stop
| using the athletes as pieces in their athletic game of chess, and they
; will search for ways to stay out of the familiar "Liltle League" syn
drome in which the parents take the g;ime away from the kids.
