# SECOND DAY
## Starvation And Showers Used In Smoking Battle 
### ODIN SMOKER (Second in a Series) 
When you're trying to stop
smoking they tell you to take
it one day at a time. Well, I
made it through the first day,
and at 7:30 p.m. I sloshed
into the second session of the
Five-Day-Smoking Clink'.
I say sloshed because for
24 hours I'd had nothing but
glass after glass of water for
my meals. I had followed the
first day's instruction and
had forsaken food.
This, I was told, would
clean out my lungs and re
move the nicotine from my
body. My consumption of
water is removing something
but it's hard to tell if the nico
tine is following.
We began the evening with
a film produced by the Amer
ican Temperance League. A
little white mouse and poor
old man were felled by smok
ing before it was over.
Mr. Cooper, the director
gave another lecture on our
will power, "The sovereign
agency within the mind."
Then a doctor named Johns,
a chest surgeon, told us about
the physiological coll se
quences of smoking. He de
scribed a patient; of his. This
guy claimed to l>e only a light
smoker, but at the age of 57
he had the three major dis

east's you get from smoking'.
At (lie moment I couldn't
have cared less about I)r.
John's 57-year-old patient. I
was 2J, and I was hungry. I
didn't care about cigarettes
any more. I didn't even care
about women or the FS.M. All
I wanted to do was stuff my
self with as much food as
I could. I could sec through
their plan. They'd make you
so hungry you'd forget about
anything else hut food.
Toniorow, they said, we'd
he able to eat. They knew
we'd be too weak to walk in
here if we didn't. The mis
ery's not over yet, though. No
coffee with our meals. In
stead, We take a "Cold Mitten
Fric t i o u Shower." This
shower, we were told, con
sisted of warming the body
with hot water and then rub
bing our skin briskly until it
turned pink. This is supposed
to increase blood circulation
and serve as a morning stim
ulant, which it did.
If during the day the crav
ing strikes hard, I si m p I y
breat-h rhythmically and have
another glass of water.
My chances of success are
slipping. To satisfy my
hunger I must smoke. To
win friends, I must smoke.
But to get attention, I mustn't
smoke.

Toniorow, they said, we'd

we'd be too weak to walk in
here if we didn't. The mis
ery's not over yet, though. No
coffee with our meals. In
stead, We take a "Cold Mitten
Fric t i o u Shower." This
shower, we were told, con
sisted of warming the body
with hot water and then rub
bing our skin briskly until it
turned pink. This is supposed
to increase blood circulation
and serve as a morning stim
ulant, which it did.
If during the day the crav

When you're trying to stop
smoking they tell you to take
it one day at a time. Well, I
made it through the first day,
and at 7:30 p.m. I sloshed
into the second session of the
Five-Day-Smoking Clink'.
I say sloshed because for
24 hours I'd had nothing but
glass after glass of water for
my meals. I had followed the
first day's instruction and
had forsaken food.
This, I was told, would
clean out my lungs and re
move the nicotine from my
body. My consumption of
water is removing something
but it's hard to tell if the nico
tine is following.
We began the evening with
a film produced by the Amer
ican Temperance League. A
little white mouse and poor
old man were felled by smok
ing before it was over.
Mr. Cooper, the director
gave another lecture on our
will power, "The sovereign
agency within the mind."
Then a doctor named Johns,
a chest surgeon, told us about
the physiological coll se
quences of smoking. He de
scribed a patient; of his. This
guy claimed to l>e only a light
smoker, but at the age of 57
he had the three major dis
