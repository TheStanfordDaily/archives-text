## Two Undergrad Communities: The Serious Ride Piggy-Back Art Fisher 
### 
To all but the dozing it must seem clear that
there exist two distinct communities within the
Stanford undergraduate population.
One community is composed generally of the
better students, the more serious, more dedicated,
and perhaps the more mature. These are students
who make great demands of themselves, who are
immensely dissatisfied with their condition. These
see struggle as a desirable alternative to crabbing.
They see each new phenomenon not as a wave to
be survived but as a challenge to understanding
and a stimulus to growth.
Obviously not all such students are academic
achievers, nor are all those on the Dean's List part
of this first community. The distinction is by alti
tude, aspiration, and endeavor, not by rewards
and recognition.
Within the second community are found those
who are either satisfied with themselves or, it un
satisfied. have not yet given themselves to action.
Their primary interests are social. Wholly favor
ing education and at least not hostile toward ac
culturation, this group nonetheless submits to
study as a nine-to-five occupation, regarding vora
cious intellectuality as an aberration of personal
ity. Stanford students generally are the most
talented of the typical; this group is their most
valid representative.
Members of this second community may be
easily identified. As Freshmen, their dinner con
versation in March will still center on the detailed
horrors of dormitory food. Later, their speech
will be dominated by expressions found only in
side living groups and automobiles. Lack of space
forbids discussion of their equally distinctive uni
forms.
Make no mistake. Many of America's leading
citizens will emerge from their ranks. They must;
there aren't enough of the others.
Drones
Appended to the bottom of the second com
munity is a group of drones. For them, college
is a waiting-room, and they are here whiling away
the hours, waiting for it all to pass away. Society
has imposed upon them a four-year detention, a
requisite for acceptability; one may as well spend
the time amidst pleasant surroundings. The drones
tend toward periodic spasms of fear and dedica
tion which lift them briefly into the main body
of the second community.
Such are the two cities. (Ortega y Gasset would
not have been surprised.) The differing tastes and
standards of these two groups and their directly
conflicting goals and interests cause them to co
exist in uneasy and fragile peace.
The conflicts are elemental. Members of the
first community desire a more exigent, more
erudite, more intellectual university; the second
community regards such a prospect as a needless
imposition. The more serious community regards
the other as an obstruction, as sand in the gears,
which is suspected and resented by the second
community.
The first community is generally driven by
some ethical conviction in its work, and having
conformed to that conviction, members of this
community feel themselves deserving of respect;
instead they are looked on as peculiar. The social
nature of the second group intrudes upon the mix
ture of peace and conflict sought by the first.
Most significantly each group suspects that

given the chance the other would turn it out of
the university altogether, devoting Stanford ex
clusively to one of the two extremes. The grave
concern of students with admissions policy is a
symptom of this condition of alienation.
Probably most active alumni feel a kinship to
the second group and hence arc mildly suspicious
of the first.
Probably most professors are ambivalent. The
emotional rewards of teaching come from working
wilh the first group, who if they were second
graders might be classified as "eager learners."
The financial rewards come preponderantly from
instructing members of the second community,
and professors know that. Too, there are matters
of ethics involved, of the mission of the educator.
At times teaching the second group is more satis
fying, turning on the light in the student's eye, a
light which like any other glows more impres
sively after a period of darkness.
Naturally tho.se professors who as students
were always members of the second, larger com
munity will be atypical. Similarly, those who felt
themselves most strongly a part of Ihe first com
munity will have a feeling of kinship to augment
any bias they may have acquired professionally.
The administration, save academic deans, is
separate from the teaching faculty. The adminis
st rat ion is not only ambivalent but also hamstrung.
The oft-mentioned dual goals of a university, the
education of the general populace and the encour
agement of the scholar, are clearly in conflict.
Many administrators have impressive back
grounds in scholarly pursuits. Others discovered
their executive talents early and so have devoted
most of their careers to policy formulation and
execution. Thus as men their prejudices may differ.
But as officers of the university, administra
tors have little choice. These men are executors in
trust, responsible to those whose dollars they
spend, if not directly responsible then implicitly
so.
It is unlikely that contributions would pour in
at their present volume if Stanford were to be
made over by the more serious student commu
nity. Present alumni would feel a decreasing iden
tification and would lose interest. Students of the
first community might not achieve the financial
success in later life that has been traditionally
achieved by members of the larger second commu
nity. Students in the first group are less inclined
to feel a dollar loyalty to their undergraduate
alma mater; in contrast, I have read in The Daily
that animals never forget.
A Boutique For Kultnr
Neither are we liable to be reconverted into a
pleasure palace in which Midwestern manufac
turers can purchase injections of kultur for their
kids at $470 a shot. The quality of the faculty cur
rently at Stanford is such that the better students
could be wrenched from them only after consid
erable struggle and bribery. Too, the oft-over
looked wisdom of the administration can bo de
pended on to protect a small community of poten
tial scholars. Not unlike the buffalo.
In short, while the community of more dedi
cated students may well be able to pay its own
freight, it is unable to support an entire university.
Its members are of necessity riding on an enor
mous hippopotamus, slyly, perhaps wisely con
tent to just piggy-back along.
Don't rock the hippopotamus.
