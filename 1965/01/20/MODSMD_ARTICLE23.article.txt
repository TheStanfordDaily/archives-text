## Graduate Election Could Give LASSU Big Boost 
### ED SHAW Speaker Of The Legislature 
The action of the Legislature last Thursday night iu ordering
special elections to fill vacancies at all graduate levels may well
be the catalyst that has been needed for some time. The potential
occupancy of well over forty scats representing all the graduates
will give student government a substantial push toward its tlico-

retical role.
The University co m m unity
might be divided into three see
tors: faculty, administration and
students. For these sectors to live
together within this constricted
society necessitates broad avenues
of communication. When these
avenues are broken or used by
factions which are not indicative
of the true feelings of their sec
tor- then situations occur similar
to those at the University of Cali
fornia.
Each sector has a structural
form which allows it to fully con
sider each problem. Within the
student area this has traditionally
been some form of student gov
ernment. If student government
is to function properly it must be
sensitive to the opinions of the
student body. Should it become
too business-oriented or con
trolled by too few individuals
then it cannot fulfill its function
of representing students. Thus,
the Berkeley student government
was caught unawares of the un
rest within the student body it
was theoretically representing.
This must not happen at Stanford.
Danger Of Informality
A more subtle problem, especi
ally in the "good'' years, is the
sole use of the informal method
of communication where small
numbers of students make the de
cisions without, prior consultation
of the student body. Depending as
it does on the relationship be
tween individuals this method
tends to falter in those periods
where it is most needed. Surely a
basic tenet must be that within
each sector and between sectors
the communication lines shall not
be controlled by particular fac

tions or small numbers of people.
Unlike many student govern
ments, the Associated Students at
Stanford makes no distinction be
tween undergraduates and gradu
ates. For this reason it is grati
fying to see a substantial number
ol graduates interested in the po
tential of the Associated Students.
Highly KeprestMitative
The student association at Stan
ford is somewhat unique among
student governments in the
United States. The Legislature
with a representation of one for
every seventy-five students and
a potential membership of close
to one hundred and fifty can more
accurately represent the true
opinion of the individual student
than any other form of student
government. Those representa
tives elected next week by the
graduates, each one representing
only seventy-five individuals, will
leave no doubt what group speaks
for the interests of all graduates
at Stanford.
It is hoped that each graduate
will take an active interest in the
candidates for from all indications
there is little doubt that all va
cancies will be filled. Undergradu
ates might well take heed, for
there is an almost even division
on the Legislature between un
dergraduates and graduates con
sidering the attrition rate of the
former.
