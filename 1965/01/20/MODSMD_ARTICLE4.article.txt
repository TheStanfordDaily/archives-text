### 
Twenty-four students from the
National University, Bogota, Col
ombia will arrive Thursday for
a week-long inresidence visit at
Stanford, according to Chuck Me-
Brian, campus N.S.A. coordinator.
The Colombian group, in the
United States on a tour jointly
sponsored by the State Depart
ment and the National Student
Association, is at Stanford to
its members an opportunity to
study the structure and day-to
day activity of an American uni
versity.
"The students are particularly
interested in the attitudes of
American students," Mc√ürian
said. Those interested in talking
with the Colombians are urged
to call Helen Benjamin, project
head, at DA 6-2520.
IN ADDITION to the planned
informal meetings, the students
will be present at a Sunday night
reception which will begin at the
I-Center at 8:00 p.m.
