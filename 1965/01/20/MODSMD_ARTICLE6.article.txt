# Scientist Reports On Antarctica
## Cooperation Of Nations Praised 
### 
According to Professor Laur
ence M. Gould, of the Univer
sity of Arizona, speaking before
a n enthusiastic audience in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
night, the strangest thing about
Antarctica i.s that it took us so
long to learn about its existence."
Since Captain James Cook acci
dentally sighted Antarctica in
1770, while hunting seals, and the
American Wilkes demonstrated
in 1838 the continental nature of
the vast land mass, Antarctica
has become a significant frontier
of science and a rallying point
for international cooperation.
PROFESSOR GOU L I) em
phasized the incalcuable scientific
import of "our newest continent,"
describing it as a geophysical
laboratory of unparalleled pro
portions and an exciting area for
research in marine biology.
Contrary to popular belief, he
said, the oceans surrounding the
south polar continent contain the
richest abundance of sea life in
the world. "It will probably be
10 or 12 years until we realize the
impact of Antarctica in the solu
tion of the major problems in geo
physics."
Although tentative explorations
oi Antarctica were begun in 1928,
real investigation of the interior
only started during the Interna
tional Geophysical Year 1957-58.
This splendid effort on the part
of twelve nations is closest to' Pr
ofessor Gould's heart.
He called IGY "one of the great
est cooperative efforts in the his
tory of mankind." The free ex
change of scientific information
and the harmony that prevailed
among the explorers should, he
stated, serve as a symbol for men
today.
Professor Gould went on to tell
of his part in the conclusion of
the Antarctic Treaty, which is to
perpetuate and preserve the spirit
ol cooperation that existed dur
ing the International Geophysical
Year.
THE LECTURE was supple
mented by movies taken by the
professor in 1928 and 1957, show
ing the transition of Antarctica J
from a land of adventure, domi
nated by the dog sledge, to a scene
of modern scientific investigation
in the shadow of-the nuclear re
actor.
