# Mad 'Artists' Strike!
## 
### JON ROISE 
Tile long detour around the undergraduate
library sit<- between the Branner-Stern-Wilbur
complex and the Quad isn't becoming 1 any
shorter these days, but it has become more in
teresting.
Early yesterday a group of erstwhile artists
assaulted those sections of the long, construc
tion-encompassing plywood fence adjacent to
the Western Civ Li be and the Bookstore, leav
ing behind their sentiments, a lot of black paint,
and a few unprintable comments.
In the meanwhile, advanced design students
under Prof. Matt Kalin of the Art and Architec
ture Department are making plans to attack
the whole perimeter with a slightly more formal
abstraet expressionism.
One of his classes is now at work 011 an over
all plan for the undertaking.
The major problem involved, he told The
Daily last night, is to coordinate the project in

such a way as to allow his art students as much
individual expression as possible while still
maintaining a unified theme. "They look upon
tins structure as a way to assert themselves,"
he said.
According to Kahn, the budding artists, who
will number about eight, will receive academic
credit for their work.
The actual painting of the massive harrier
will begin within two weeks, Kahn added, "pro
vided we arrive at a solidified idea."
He said that the project was being financed
by a grant from the President's Discretionary
Fund, with the approval of the President's
Office.
When The Daily inquired as to his reactions
to yesterday's neo-Berkeleyian endeavors, Kahn
replied, "It makes our job that much easier."
"After the vandals have gotten through with
their various pranks, anything we do will seem
conservative."
