A Vote "No" for God
Jesus Christ said, "He who is not with me, is against me,
and he who does not gather with me, scatters (Matthew 1 2:30).
That is, a neutral or uncommitted attitude towards Jesus Christ
is a "no" vote for God.
Jesus Christ said, "No man can serve two masters; for
either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will
hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God
and mammon" (Matthew 6:24). Serving God and living for
self is not just unfeasible, but totally impossible, Jesus said.
Jesus Christ said, "I am the vine, you are the branches. He
who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit,
for apart from me you can do nothing" (John 15:5). All activ
ity which does not spring from trust and dependence in Him
is worthless and of no value in God's sight, Jesus said. Failure
to make a positive "yes, I will" response to Jesus Christ is an
automatic "no" vote for God.
These claims of Jesus Christ have been verified by count
less millions through the ages who have discovered new life
with meaning and purpose as a result of their response to the
Lord Jesus. Released from their futile ways and frustrated
search for peace in a dying world, those who know and obey
Jesus Christ find full, fruitful lifeâ€”life as God intended it to be.
But cut off from God, the man of the world by his conduct and
actions is voting "no" for God, storing up for himself the pain
and anguish of eternity in total separation from Him who is
Life and Truth and Love.
You alone can decide whether to accept or reject Jesus
Christ, but He has not left us the choice of remaining neutral.
Your "yes" in response to His offer will bring you forever
into His family. Jesus said, "Come unto me all ye that labor
and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke
upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart:
and ye shall find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and
my burden is light (Matthew 11:28-30).
