• Churchill Clings To Lift'
LONDON Sir Winston Churchill, his
condition at low ebb, clung to a fingertip hold
on life today. No single ray of hope for the
90-year-old statesman penetrated London's
wintry gloom.
Churchill's circulation grew weaker yester
day, his doctor reported.
The reference to Sir Winston's circulation
was the first since the initial bulletin last Fri
day. That one said that after a cold Sir Win
ston had developed a circulatory weakness and
there had been a cerebral thrombosis.
• i\ew Vietnamese Crisis
SAIGON, South Viet Nam A new Budd
hist crisis confronted Premier Tran Van
Huong's U.S.-backed administration yesterday
even as a potential Cabinet crisis unexpectedly
eased. Street fighting revived.

Five militant Buddhist loaders, accusing
Huong of trying to destroy their faith,
launched a hunger strike to force him out of
office. They declared they will fast until death
if necessary. Some of their followers clashed
with troops in a three-hour riot.
Four young generals and a civilian were
sworn in as Cabinet officers after a 24-hour
hitch caused by the reluctance of one, Brig.
Gen. Nguyen Cao Ky, to assume a new job as
minister of youth and sports.
NATIONAL
• Johnson Takes Oath
WASHINGTON — Lydon B. Johnson took
the inauguration oath yesterday, solemnly
pledged to "lead as best I can," and then
headed a grand parade down "The Thorough
fare of Presidents."
The parade, at Johnson's suggestion, lacked
the display of military might, so prominent
in past inaugural parades. No missiles, no

atomic cannon, no jet warplanes roaring over
head.
The security was terrific for this inaugura
tion, the tightest in history, but it could not
contain the ebullient, handshaking President.
• Romney Backs COP Conference
WASHINGTON — Gov. George Romney
of Michigan yesterday got squarely behind a
proposal for a Republican national conference
this spring to reach a consensus on party goals
and principles.
"What the party leaders need more than
anything else is the time and opportunity to
sit down and talk things through," Romney
said in an interview. "Only when you talk
things through can you reach a consensus."

Such a convention was advocated Tuesday
by former Rep. Robert Taft Jr. of Ohio and
by Gov. Robert E. Smylie of Idaho. Romney
said it was first suggested by Edward Brooke,
attorney general of Massachusetts.
STATE AND LOCAL
• Capital Punishment Hill
SACRAMENTO — Legislation abolishing
the death penalty was introduced yesterday
in the Senate.
Sen. John W. Holmdahl, D.-Oakland, spon
sor of the measure, said the constitutional
amendment would substitute the penalty of
life imprisonment without the possibility of
parole.
Holmdahl said he wanted the electorate to
decide whether California should retain capital
punishment.
He added, however, that he supports tho
death penalty "as a protection for our law
abiding citizens, but this important question

should bo settled once and lor all by those ulti
mately concerned —the people themselves."
Two-thirds approval by the legislature
would be neded for the amendment before it
can be submitted to a vote of the people.
