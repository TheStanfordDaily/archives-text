# Woodward: Second Era For South
## Current Attitude Ignores Issues 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
The period of Heeonstriietion
is "an undigested lump of his
torical experience in the nation's
mind," C. Vann Woodward, Vale
professor of history at Vale, told
a professor-packed audience in
Tresidder last night.
Woodward, a native of Arkan
sas who has written several books
about: problems of southern his
| tory, will speak again tomorrow
i at 4:15 in Tresidder on "The Dis
i turbed Mind of the South."
ACCORDING TO Woodward,
Americans who entered the period
of crisis which he called "the sec
ond reconstruction" were heirs to
the old historical synthesis which
accepts the motives of the Civil
! War while the methods of Recon-
J struction.
The economic interpretation of
Reconstruction which discredits
its motives as being based on class
lor sectionalism is largely con
fined to scholars, Woodward said.
The renewal of debate about the
i 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments
and the redebating of integration
acts passed a century ago "con
fuse Americans who thought the
issues were largely settled."
NORTHERN as well as Sout.li
| ern senators rose to their feet in
J reaction in 1957, showing "the
j national unanimity on a legend,"
Woodward said. He quoted a
southern senator as saying, "I
know the Civil War is over. I only
regret that I can't say the same
of Reconstruction;" and a north
erner, "I don't like to remember
; those days either."
Actually, the North and South
! have a common heritage of guilt
about t Ik - - first reconstruction.
Woodward said.
The North has a "guilt and
shame" complex from pretending
to be nobler than in reality it was;
j the South took refuge from its
wounded pride and damaged self
estem in a "dirty deal complex."
WHAT ARK the ways out
now?" Traditionally, the attitude
toward Reconstruction has been
either to say let's deplore it a n d
forget about it or to make th e
whole thing a glorious if abortive
! experiment in democracy," Wood
ward said.
"It would be better to take a
cue from the therapist who in
sists in restoring an experience to
full consciousness and facing the
insights 1 his might provide," he
! suggested.
