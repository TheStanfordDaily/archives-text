Stanford boxing team fell lo the
California Bears 5-4, on January
14 before a packed house of ex
uberant fans. All hough the con
test ended with both squads win
ning three matches, a Stanford
forfeit in the 125 lb. match gave

in the lighter weight divisions.
The Indians won three of the first
four bouts and the 139-lb. match
ended in a draw. The 168 lb.
match also ended in a draw.
Although Stanford's lighter
boxers were quicker and stronger,
a definite Stanford weakness,
possibly attributed to a lack of
experience and conditioning, was
evident in the heavier weight divi
sions. The Bears pounded out
their three wins in the 156, 365.
and heavyweight divisions. Two
of the wins were by knockouts.
As was expected the evening's
bip match was between Stanford's
Rudy Oberzan and Cal's Paul
Bell, eventually won by Oberzan.
Both boxers showed fine speed
and agility, but Oberzan proved
to be a more consistent puncher,
especially in the second round
when Bell nearly went to the mat
from a barrage of Oberzan

I punches.
Jim Conti and George Bellows
also won their matches. Bellows
was extremely effective defen
sively as his opponent was barely
able to land a good blow in the
; bout.
