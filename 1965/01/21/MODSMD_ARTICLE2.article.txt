# SMOKING CLINIC
## Dying Mice, Coughs Animate 3rd Session 
### ODIN SMOKER 
Having attended the first
two days of the five-day "Stop
Smoking Clinic.," I fell that
I Was well on the way to
breaking the smoking habit.
Then, five minutes before
the third session, I had an at
tack. I needed a smoke, bad.
They had told us to breathe
deeply and have a glass of
water, which I did, but no
luck.
The las} resort, we had been
told, was to avoid the smoke
for :>0 seconds. I read "War
and Peace" from cover to
cover. It worked.
The third meeting began as
the others, with a movie, "Be
yond A Reasonable Doubt."
Another smoker was awak
ened to the hazards of smok
ing. The movie, as the ses
sions, was informative. But
the facts scare.
During every movie, a
white mouse must die. Al
ways, the kind doctor makes
the mouse smoke. When he
lights the cigarette for the
mouse, then I know I'm not
cured, I envy the mouse.
Dr. George Burton of the
medical center continued the
theme of the movie, listing
the pros and cons of smoking.
He said the main pro was
that cigarettes taste good. We
all shuffled in our seats. I
missed by gum and bit my
tongue.
The cons were evident from
the smoking coughs, the half
breaths of the older members
of the audience.

.Mr. Cooper, director of the
clinic, (old us that from the
time we stopped smoking our
taste and smell would return
—also, our breaths would be
sweeter.
This I need. That's why I
started smoking*—had Urealh.
The third day, we were told,
is the crucial day. We begin
with the "cold mitten fric
tion" shower and follow it
with the usual fluid intake
and diet of fruits.
I got a rash, however. I'm
allergic to fruits. The rash
came out on the arm to which
I gave the "cold mitten"
shower.
1 think 1 have :i cavity. The
gum and lemon drops are
rotting my teeth.
I)r. Burton explained th e
effect of smoking on the
heart. Apparently, nicotine
causes the blood vessels to
constrict. If the flow is cut
of 112, suddenly a coronary
heart attack results.
We were told the heart will
begin to hurt before the fatal
blow, but not so with the
lungs. The lungs may l>e 50
per cent damaged before any
evidence may l>e noticed.
We were told also that it is
easier to stop smoking if we
will attempt to encourage
someone else.
Tomorrow we must contact
our partners. My partner
went skiing.
We were told that smok
ing during pregnancy can
damage the unborn child. I
noted it as a useful fact.

Having attended the first
two days of the five-day "Stop
Smoking Clinic.," I fell that
I Was well on the way to
breaking the smoking habit.
Then, five minutes before
the third session, I had an at
tack. I needed a smoke, bad.
They had told us to breathe
deeply and have a glass of
water, which I did, but no
luck.
The las} resort, we had been
told, was to avoid the smoke
for :>0 seconds. I read "War
and Peace" from cover to
cover. It worked.
The third meeting began as
the others, with a movie, "Be
yond A Reasonable Doubt."
Another smoker was awak
ened to the hazards of smok
ing. The movie, as the ses
sions, was informative. But
the facts scare.
During every movie, a
white mouse must die. Al
ways, the kind doctor makes
the mouse smoke. When he
lights the cigarette for the
mouse, then I know I'm not
cured, I envy the mouse.
Dr. George Burton of the
medical center continued the
theme of the movie, listing
the pros and cons of smoking.
He said the main pro was
that cigarettes taste good. We
all shuffled in our seats. I
missed by gum and bit my
tongue.
The cons were evident from
the smoking coughs, the half
breaths of the older members
of the audience.

.Mr. Cooper, director of the
clinic, (old us that from the
time we stopped smoking our
taste and smell would return
—also, our breaths would be
sweeter.
This I need. That's why I
started smoking*—had Urealh.
The third day, we were told,
is the crucial day. We begin
with the "cold mitten fric
tion" shower and follow it
with the usual fluid intake
and diet of fruits.
I got a rash, however. I'm
allergic to fruits. The rash
came out on the arm to which
I gave the "cold mitten"
shower.
1 think 1 have :i cavity. The
gum and lemon drops are
rotting my teeth.
I)r. Burton explained th e
effect of smoking on the
heart. Apparently, nicotine
causes the blood vessels to
constrict. If the flow is cut
of 112, suddenly a coronary
heart attack results.
We were told the heart will
begin to hurt before the fatal
blow, but not so with the
lungs. The lungs may l>e 50
per cent damaged before any
evidence may l>e noticed.
We were told also that it is
easier to stop smoking if we
will attempt to encourage
someone else.
Tomorrow we must contact
our partners. My partner
went skiing.
We were told that smok
ing during pregnancy can
damage the unborn child. I
noted it as a useful fact.
