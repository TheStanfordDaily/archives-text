## 'Find A Use For The Building' Contest Provokes Suggestions

• Use 11 lor PACE
Dear Sir:
1 am tempted to advocate the
use of the building by the Food
Research Institute, in hopes that
the ensuing findings of the Insti
tute might benefit all those stu
dents residing in University hous
ing. However, succumbing to
Stanford (Monetary) Spirit, I;
move that the crescent-shaped j
beauty be sold to another large
corporation desiring to sustain!
losses for tax purposes. The build- j
ing would lie resold to the Univer
sity. thereby actually netting that i
$3,000,000 discrepancy. This proce- j
dure would hopefully be repeated
indefinitely, insuring the ultimate
success of PACE and preserving
the memory of Leland Stanford.

• Mock Sprou I Hall
Dear Sir:
Ycgads! After the Big Game the
Administration complained about
the cost (a paltry four-figure
sum) of erasing a plethora of
blue "C's" painted on anything
to which paint will stick. Now the
same Administration pays half a
megabuck for the biggest "C"
ever to affront the Stanford cam
pus. There can be only one pos
sible use: as a training ground
for the FSM. Suspended FSMers
can alternately use the building
as a dormitory and as a mock
Sproul Hall. In order for the FSM
to practice non-violence, Stanford
men will play the role of sadistic
Bay Area police. The men of each
undergraduate class will compete
for a trophy, awarded for the
most realistic imitation of police
brutality. Contest judges? Who
else but the GCC?

Dear Sir:
1) Evacuate Eneina Hall, which
could be converted to office space
for the ever-growing ASSU Bu
reaucracy, and move the admin

istration into the new building.
Effects:
a) Student Government would
ho inspired to new heights of
efficiency and responsibility by
their presence in such an august
structure, and in addition would
obtain the proper perspective on
University affairs.
b> By being removed from the
hurly-burly and pressure of rou
tine University business as a re
sult of their inaccessibility, the
administration could utilize its
splendid isolation to develop new
ways to combat the problem of
growing Depersonalization.
2) Convert the new building
into a multilevel parking garage,
thus providing sufficient "on-cam
pus" parking space so that more
streets and parking areas could
be closed off, thus protecting
Higher Education from hydrocar
bons.

Dear Sir:
1 am tempted to advocate the
use of the building by the Food
Research Institute, in hopes that
the ensuing findings of the Insti
tute might benefit all those stu
dents residing in University hous
ing. However, succumbing to
Stanford (Monetary) Spirit, I;
move that the crescent-shaped j
beauty be sold to another large
corporation desiring to sustain!
losses for tax purposes. The build- j
ing would lie resold to the Univer

$3,000,000 discrepancy. This proce- j

indefinitely, insuring the ultimate
success of PACE and preserving

• Mock Sprou I Hall
Dear Sir:
Ycgads! After the Big Game the
Administration complained about
the cost (a paltry four-figure
sum) of erasing a plethora of
blue "C's" painted on anything
to which paint will stick. Now the
same Administration pays half a
megabuck for the biggest "C"
ever to affront the Stanford cam
pus. There can be only one pos
sible use: as a training ground
for the FSM. Suspended FSMers
can alternately use the building
as a dormitory and as a mock
Sproul Hall. In order for the FSM
to practice non-violence, Stanford
men will play the role of sadistic
Bay Area police. The men of each
undergraduate class will compete
for a trophy, awarded for the
most realistic imitation of police
brutality. Contest judges? Who
else but the GCC?
