## Another Bad Rush Policy Threatens Wilbur System 
### Justin Beck 
Dean of Men Hob Gordon recently became; the proud lather
J of a new committee formed to investigate rush policies. But while
Dean Gordon's new rush committee lias definite parentage, this
year's rush policy is beginning to look suspiciously illegitimate.
1 Gordon, this fall, was sure that students could cooperate in

j writing spring's rush policy. "D
: won't accept a rush policy until
they come up with one that is
acceptable to everyone," he re
portedly said in the optimistic
days of autumn.
('alendar-Pr«vok«'d
In January his determination
melted, and he accepted a rush
policy as Greek as the Acropolis,
mainly, it is rumored, because the
University calendar was being
prepared and the dates of the
open houses had to be set. "What
could I do?" said Dean Gordon.
So once again, this time under
the auspices of the University
'calendar, the yearly cattle drive
from Wilbur Hall to the markets
on fraternity row is beginning,
I shattering in the process the Uni
versity-sponsored Wilbur House
system. This year's policy has not
I even satisfied the entire IFC, but
j fraternity malcontents would
1 rather keep silent, adjusting as
best they can, than face the wrath
of Professor James T. Watkins
and fraternity row's big five.
Bleak as things look for the
; frosh, they can always hope for
another chance. The IFC pro
positi includes among other things
an additional open house to give
the frosh their "second chance,"
| probably to ensure t hat there were
! no latent Greeks left, in the refuse
j heap after the first rush, and to
i give the second rate houses the
: pick of the best of the rejects.
Basic Inconsistencies
Unfortunately the future isn't
j much brighter, for Dean Gordon
| and all of his prize committees
j will continue to drift from one
| bad policy to another as long and
they and others in authority con
■ tinue to dodge the real issues.
| One student dissatisfied with
jlhree years of much talk and
little action said, "How long are
we going to have to put up with
administrators who refuse to face
the basic inconsistencies in the
men's residence system;"
Nor is LASSU any help, for in
the past the powerful IFC block
has prevented any rational dis-
I cussion of rush policy.
That leaves the problem solely
up to the Dean's office, but Uni
j vcrsity bureaucracy, p e r h a ps
taking its cue from President
j Sterling's philosophy of educa

►
cation, has refused to face the
issue.
Perhaps Hie only way to main
tain the Wilbur House system is
;to end rush altogether, and if
| necessary end the fraternity sys
tem, for the University-sponsored
; Wilbur system is in direct con
flict with tlie University condoned
fraternity system.
Costly Pledge Classes
Each year." if a recent study is
correct, the fraternities spend up
to $50,000 tearing down Wilbur
j system during spring rush. The
: money the fraternities spend ped
dling beer and brotherhood to the
■ freshmen herd could finance nine
guest-in-residence programs, eight
; four-year full tuition scholarships,
; or several thousand books for the
■ new undergraduate library. In
| stead the frats purchase w i th
• their money 23 pledge classes.
The result of all this is that
the Wilbur House system begins
; to totter in Winter Quarter, and
| the advent of spring rush totally
: collapses.
Traditionally, sponsors have
i been among the strongest oppon
ents of rush, particularly of a
| short rush period. On the other
! hand, fraternities have fought
for as brief a rush as they can
; get, mainly, they say, because of
, the cost of a quarter long rush.
Excessive Costs
During last year's long rush,
pledge classes had a tendency to
bounce from one house to another
depending on the quantity of beer
and the quality of parties. Most
fraternities felt that the cost of
keeping up the good cheer was
i excessive.
But the sponsors object 1o the
I herd instinct promoted by Ihc
I fraternities, claiming that rush
subjects the freshman to intense
i psychological pressures, virtually
j eliminating any freedom of
' choice.
While rush is intended to be a
process of mutual selection by
freshman and fraternities, it isn't,
particularly during a short rush
when the fraternities can afford
to give the frosh all the beer and
parties they could possibly
handle. In the end, sponsors feel,
the house chooses its pledges, and
the freshmen are left with little
' choice.
