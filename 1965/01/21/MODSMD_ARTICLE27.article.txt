## Johnson's Great Society: Affluence And Consensus 
### Walter Lippmann 
Tlio Great Society, as President Lyndon Johnson is using tin*
words, is much more than a mere collection of necessary or desir
able programs making life more livable in this country. It is an
attempt to open a new chapter in the annals of popular govern
ment.
Compressed into one sentence, the basic idea is that an affluent

society like the American can be"*
governed by consensus. Let us see
what this means. An affluent so
| ciety is not simply a rich society:
; it is one which has mastered the
new art of controlling and stimu
lating its own economic growth.
To be sure, we are as yet only
students and apprentices in the
art. We have not yet fully mas
tered it. But we have a suffici
ently promising start to justify
our thinking that we have seen
a breakthrough — that we are es
caping from the immemorial hu
man predicament of Ihe haves
and the have-nots. This prediea-!
ment has been based on the as- ;
[sumption that the si/.e of the pie
| to be divided is fixed and that,
therefore, if some have more,
j others must take less.
The Same Old ( anls
The assumption that this pre
dicament exists has been the cen
: iral idea of socialism and com
| munism. However, it has also
I been the tacit assumption of re
cent. reformist and welfare pro
grams. We can see this in slogans
like "the New Deal" and"the Fail-
Deal." Both imply lhat there is
j always the same pack to be dealt.
I The scientific breakthrough in
| modern economic theory was pre
! pared in the years between th e
| two world wars. But only recently,
| not until President John Ken
| nedy's proposal of a tax cut as
part of a planned deficit, have ihc
j modern economists in the govern
ment service and in the great fi
nancial institutions been taken
quite seriously.
I will not say that they have
moved into the driver's seat. But
1 certainly thev are in the seat next
to the driver's, reading the signs
and following the maps for him.
The result of this change is a
benign revolution which makes
possible that the costs of improv
ing schools and colleges, of re
ducing poverty, of rebuilding
1 slums can be covered by calcu
lated increases in the national
I output of wealth.
Dangerous Moonshine?
I realize that there are some
who will dismiss all this as dan
gerous moonshine. I can remem
j ber a time when we stood on the
I sidewalk and jeered at passing
i automobiles, telling the driver to
i get a horse. But now the practical
I evidence of what can be done is

coming in, and it is accepted in
creasingly by the business com
munity and by organized labor.
This is the concrete foundation
of the special and unusual John
son political style. If a modern so
ciety like ours need no longer
think of itself as irreconcilably
divided over the distribution of
wealth, it has become humanly
possible to govern by obtaining
wide agreement among the vot
ers. It is a fortunate coincidence
that Lyndon Johnson happens to
be a man who has long practiced
the art of healing conflicts. But
he would not be able to make this
skill the governing philosophy of
I an administration if the evolution
: of a modern economic society did
not give him the opportunity.
When President Johnson talks
about seeking a consensus, he is
not saying that he expects every
one to vote for him and to agree
with him. But he is saying that
the great internal problems can
-1 not be solved succes fully and sat
i isfactorily until and unless they
: have the support of a very big
! majority.
< 'oneensus
In the American political tra
dition, a very big majority is tak
oji to lie between 60 and 75 per
j cent.
Lyndon Johnson was elected b\
such a consensus, and his in ten
■ tion is to conserve the consensus
if he can. It is not only that; as
'everyone else he likes to be liked.
It is because he has realized from
his large practical experience that
our really difficult and important
internal problems cannot be
solved in any other way.
The American race problem is
the outstanding example. Unless
there is a wide and growing will
ingness to observe civil rights
laws, enforcement alone will be a
, long and bloody battle. The same
principle applies to relations be
tween capital and labor.
The Johnson conception of the
Great Society rests on the two
pillars of controlled affluence and
of political consensus. If the con
ception were to fail, it would not
be because the conception is false.
It would be because of some ex
ternal cause—possibly because we
had become diverted by some en
tanglement in another continent.
