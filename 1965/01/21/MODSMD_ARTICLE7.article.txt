# Buss Urges U.S. To Withdraw Its Troops From Viet Nam
## 
### 
The United States should get
j out of Viet Nam, Claude Buss,
| professor of history and former
I Foreign Service officer, told a
meeting of the Business School
! Association yesterday.
Buss, author of "Arc of Crisis"
i and other books on Southeast
: Asia, said that escalating the war
to include North Vicl Nam
wouldn't do any good and doesn't
solve the problem of Viet Nam
as a whole.
HE FORECAST that terrorism
would increase as long as the
United States stays, and predicted
a settlement brought about by a
14-nation Geneva conference simi
lar to that which settled Laos.
"And there'll be no settlement un
less Red China sits at the table,"
he added.
"We're kidding ourselves if we
think we'll eventually achieve a
, military victory there," he said
"What we should be doing is

teaching public health and supply
ing food in support of a stable
government."
He indicated that the U.S. may
eventually have to go along with
Ho Chi Minh, Communist leader
of North Vict Nam. "lie's a Com
munist, make no doubt about
that," Prof. Buss said, "but lie's
got the only viable program."
IN ANSWER to a question

whether a U.S. withdrawal would
leave a vacuum for Red China to
fill. Prof. Buss replied:
"China might dominate Vi e t
Nam psychologically but not mili
tarily." The Vietnamese are 1 oo
nationalistic for this to happen,
he explained.
"The shrimp raise hell in the
belly of Ihe whale," he said, quot
ing: an old Korean proverb.
