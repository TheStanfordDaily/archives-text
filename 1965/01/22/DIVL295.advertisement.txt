Gospel
Our English word ' gospel" means "good news" or "glad tidings" and is
the equivalent of the Greek New Testament word "euangelion," from which
we get our word "evangelical." We all know of dynamic evangelists like Billy
Graham, but who among us can quickly define the gospel which is proclaimed?
(Jesus said, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature" —
Marl. 16:15; "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness to all the nations, and then shall ihe end come"—Matthew
24:14). Just what is this "good news" which the servants of Jesus Christ are
asked to proclaim around the world?
The gospel of Jesus Christ, presented lo men as fact not fiction, as reality
not mythology, as something to be believed not debated, is briefly this:
"I make known to you brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which
also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you are saved, if
you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
I For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ
died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that
I He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He ap
i peared to Peter, then to Ihe twelve. After that He appeared to more than
five hundred brethren at one time . . . and He appeared to James, then to all
the apostles, and last of all, as it were to one untimely born. He appeared to
| me (I Corinthinians 15:1-8).
The glad tidings to us from God is that He cares for us and was willing
to pay the price of death on our behalf that all our sins and shortcomings and
failures might be freely forgiven us. The good news is that Jesus Christ, re
! surrected from the dead two thousand years ago, now lives in the hearts of
millions who have entrusted their lives to Him.
The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the "power of God unto salvation for every
| one who believes, to the Jews first and also to the Greek" (Romans 1:16). I
Don t turn down this Good News, accept it, act upon and receive the life
j changing power of God which is yours simply for the as! ing. The death of
Jesus Christ on the cross reconciled God and man. The flood gates to His heart
of love ore open to all who will place their trust in the risen Lord Jesus.

Our English word ' gospel" means "good news" or "glad tidings" and is
the equivalent of the Greek New Testament word "euangelion," from which
we get our word "evangelical." We all know of dynamic evangelists like Billy
Graham, but who among us can quickly define the gospel which is proclaimed?
(Jesus said, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature" —
Marl. 16:15; "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the
world for a witness to all the nations, and then shall ihe end come"—Matthew
24:14). Just what is this "good news" which the servants of Jesus Christ are
asked to proclaim around the world?
The gospel of Jesus Christ, presented lo men as fact not fiction, as reality
not mythology, as something to be believed not debated, is briefly this:
"I make known to you brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which
also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you are saved, if
you hold fast the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain.
I For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ
died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that
I He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He ap
i peared to Peter, then to Ihe twelve. After that He appeared to more than
five hundred brethren at one time . . . and He appeared to James, then to all
the apostles, and last of all, as it were to one untimely born. He appeared to
| me (I Corinthinians 15:1-8).
The glad tidings to us from God is that He cares for us and was willing
to pay the price of death on our behalf that all our sins and shortcomings and
failures might be freely forgiven us. The good news is that Jesus Christ, re
! surrected from the dead two thousand years ago, now lives in the hearts of
millions who have entrusted their lives to Him.
The Gospel of Jesus Christ is the "power of God unto salvation for every
| one who believes, to the Jews first and also to the Greek" (Romans 1:16). I
Don t turn down this Good News, accept it, act upon and receive the life
j changing power of God which is yours simply for the as! ing. The death of
Jesus Christ on the cross reconciled God and man. The flood gates to His heart
of love ore open to all who will place their trust in the risen Lord Jesus.
