# Pravda Editor Impressed With Hoover Collection
## 
### MICHAEL COUZENS (First in a Series) 
Soviet culture claims a galaxy of innova
tions ranging from Sputnik to baseball. But
for all their inventive acumen the Soviets are
far behind in learning how to save their daily
newspapers.
When Pravda's editor visited the Hoover
Institution in 1957 he was given a tour of its
stacks. The editor was amazed when copies of
earliest Pravda issues were produced for his
inspection. The paper's own copies, tie said,
had long since deteriorated from age.
IN PLACE OF THE missing issues the
newspaper's staff uses microfilms which
bear "the Hoover Institution imprint. Witold
Sworakowski. Assistant Director, explains that
the microfilms were sent to a dealer in the
early 1950'5. The Institution had no idea of
their ultimate destination.
Newspapers, some 5,600 titles in 30 lan
guages, comprise only a part of the millions
of printed items in the Hoover Institution on
War, Revolution, and Peace. The scope of these
documents is the panorama of world history
and the compass of Herbert Hoover's prodigi
ous career.

Principal collections are organized by area:
h'urope (divided into Western and Eastern),
East Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. An
area specialist, or curator, presides over each.
ARCHIVES OF THE Russian Czarist secret
police, the Okhrana, comprise a most useful
collection in Eastern European studies. Basil
Maklakov, last imperial .Russian ambassador
to Paris, shipped 7,000 pounds of this archival
material to Stanford in 1926.
. lie then signed a statement that all the
documents had been destroyed. To keep his
secret and prevent putting his life in jeopardy,
the collection remained untouched and unpub
licized until his death, at 86, in 19f>7.
Okhrana files include the names of leading
figures in the Russian Revolution, both Men
shovik and Bolshevik. In addition to the infor
mation that Josef Stalin had a double toe,
which accounted for his rejection from mili
tary service, the files provide important in
formation on the extent of early Communist
activity, Russian agents in the United States,
and insight into Czarist intelligence tech
niques.
KAROL MAICHEL, Eastern European
Curator, reports that in its fields the collec

tion is unsurpassed outside the Soviet Union.
The many books are buttressed by original
manuscript sources, materials and archives, in
many cases unique.
The Communist International and its front
organizations illustrate this considerable
strength. A study by Dr. Sworakowski found
2,300 books on the subject in major libraries.
Of these, the Hoover Institution has the larg
est U.S. holdings, about 55 per cent. Second
was the New York Public Library, 26 per
cent. In Europe, an Amsterdam library has
26 per cent.
The upheaval of war often brings to the
surface original documents which in less hec
tic times would quietly molder in official files
and private caches.
DIARIES OF NAZI propagandist Josef
Goebbels, now in the Western European Col
lection, are an example. They were found scat
tered in the Berlin Propaganda Ministry court
yard. according to Mrs. Agnes Peterson, area
curator.
Badly damaged by water and fire, the
diaries are intensely personal and "interesting
psychologically."
In counterpoint to this find, the Institution

holds Heinrich Himmler's meticulous journals
written in his youth. With fussy attention to
detail the future Gestapo leader recorded "his
visits to church and his dates with young
Munich ladies." Comments Mrs. Peterson,
"They're enormously dull."
DURING THE 1958 crisis in Berlin, Hoover
representatives in the city were busy micro
filming the main achives of the Nazi party.
Some 150 reels of material are now available
for research in the Institution.
German holdings form the largest and old
est collection among Western European coun
tries. Starting in 1870 it follows the sweep of
events through Empire and World Wars into
postwar recovery and economic coalitions.
Exceptional collections outside Germany
document the French underground, the rise
of Fascism in Italy and the Spanish Civil War.
Interest in Belgium, dating from Mr. Hoover's
war relief efforts there, has resulted in another
outstanding collection.
BEFORE WORLD WAR II the Institution
was a depository for League of Nations docu
ments. It now receives all publications of the
Common Market, Coal and Steel Community,
and atomic energy organization in Europe.

Says Mrs. Peterson, "I hope they will have
a better and more useful fate than the League
of Nations."
Herbert Hoover was a youthful engineer in
1899 when he went to China to coordinate a
large mining operation. His interest in the
area continued, and became the touchstone of
the Institution's outstanding East Asia collec
tion.
CURATOR EUGENE \VU believes that the
holding for twentieth century China and Japan
"are among the leading ones in the western
world."
Archival material and original documents,
once again, attract scholars from all over the
world. Strongest areas include western impact
upon China, communist ascendancy, and the
modernization of Japan.
General Huang Ch'ing, who led the famous
defense of Shanghai against the Japanese in
1932, sold his library to the Institution.
REFUSING HIGHER offers for the collec
tion, he said, "These books should go to the
Hoover Library. I will consider the difference
between the library's offer and the current
market price as my donation to its work."
