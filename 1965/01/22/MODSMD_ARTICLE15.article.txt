# Murals Basketball B-League Defunct
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Tiie number of competing teams
in intramural basketball has in
creased over the previous quarter
once again, thus creating a facili
ties problem. Joe Higgins, Intra
mural Director, decided to allevi-1
ate the problem by abolishing the
"B" leagues.
TO TAKE their place, he has
instituted a "B" team double
elimination tournament. The top
eight teams in the "B" tourna
ment v.'il qualify for the cham
pionship tournament which will
include also the number one and
two teams of the "A" leagues.
A selective rundown of "A"
league action shows that the
Theta Delts in league 3 and the
ATO's in league 4 may already be
past their biggest hurdles. Most
of the other leagues are still up
for grabs.
"Chan" Osborne scored 17 points
for the Sigma Chi's as they
squeezed past the Alpha Sigs, 35-
31. The Phi Psi's are another win
ner in League 1. They beat the
Alpha Dclt team, 44-40.
In league 3 the Theta Delts
have two victories and no losses.
They took a forfeit in the first
game and trounced the Villagers
49-27, in their second contest. Bob
Strohecker, who scored 17 points,
and a good fast break undid the
Villagers.

squad in the first game for both
teams. The score was 39-27. A 1
