"Judo is more than a sport;
it is a way of life," says Handy
Olsen, currently part of a con
tingent from the Palo Alto Judo
Club teaching a beginning judo
course as part of the Stanford
Physical Education Program.
The course, known as Physical
Education 113, meets every Tues
day and Thursday at 11:00 a.m.
About forty-five students are now
enrolled in the course.
Olsen is quick to point out that
there is nothing religious about

the devotion to Judo, but that it
does become a way that one
"thinks, breathes, and studies."
Before and after each class the
participants bow in respect for the
instructor and the sport and bow
before each match to their oppo
nent.
During I he quarter, t hew ho 1 e
class sb o u I (I be able to move
through ill the falling techniques
and get a basic introduction to
throwing. Olsen stresses that fall
ing must be mastered first as a
safety measure before anyone
gels thrown.
There appeals to be intense in
terest in the course by those tak
ing it, and great respect and atten
tion is paid to head instructor
Tamo Kitaura. Many of the stu
dents stay after class for extra
aid and practice.
There will be a judo course off
ered next quarter, but there is
still a question as to whether it
wil be an intermediate course for
those now taking judo, or whether
it will be another beginner's
course. Ideally, there will be two
courses to accommodate both
groups.
