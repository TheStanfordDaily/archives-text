Two of the great showmen of
jazz opened this week in tho Bay
Area. Dizzy Gillespie, who along
with George Shearing, Stan Ken
ton, and Gerry Mulligan possesses
that unique flair for showman
ship, opened at Basin Street West
Wednesday for a three week stay.
Gillespie's career with tho 1 rum
pet goes back to ihe heart of ihe
swing era, but il was he with
saxophonist Charlie Parker who
gave much of the impetus to the
evolution of modern jazz, Parker
as Ihe theorist and Gilliespie as
the organizer and arranger to
Parker's ideas.
Sets start at 9 p.m. at Basin
Street West and are continuous
through 2 a.m. On Friday and Sat
urday nights, they also feature a
breakfast show from 2:30 on,
which is attended by many of the
city's entertainers after their
night's work. Show your student
body card at this club, as although
the policy hasn't yet been worked
out, you'll probably gel a sizable
discount.
Nancy Wilson's Opening
The opening of Nancy Wilson
at the Hyalt Music Theatre in
Burlingarne showed the soon-to

%/
be queen of the jazz vocalists
in beautiful form. The backing,
alternately given by a large or
chestra, the George Shearing com
bo, and Ihe Kenny Dennis Trio
i her husband's) was responsive
and excellent, and tho new revolv
ing stage made it much easier for
the audience, seated around the
stage, to view tho action.

Shearing was entertaining as he
often hammed it up between num
bers, and with the precision typi
cal of the Hyatt Theatre's jazz
offerings, the package is a first
class show. They will continue
over the weekend and the reign
ing queen, Ella Fitzgerald, will
come in with Nelson Riddle, Oscar
Peterson, and Roy Eld ridge n e x t
week.
Guitarist-singer Jose Feliciano,
a 19-year-old blind Puerto Rico ar
tist, is making his West Coast de
but with a two week appearance
at El Matador. Two years ago,
Duke Ellington offered him a job
in his orchestra, but his parents
wouldn't allow him to go on the
road. His repertoire of over 500
numbers includes classical, jazz,
popular ballads and flamenco.
Nightly except Sundays.... In the
coming weeks El Matador will
bring in Brazil's «"», .100 Bushkin,
Joao Gilberto, Charlie Byrd, and
Vince Guaraldi & Bola Sete.
Other Doings
Harry James' opening next
week at Tin Pan Alley in Rod
wood City has been cancelled and
rescheduled for April. Cal T.jader
will open on February A, for a
week of jazz with dancing. No
cover or minimum to Stanford
students...
The Vince Guaraldi & Bola Sete
concerts were wonderful at th e
Hotel Claremont in Berkeley the
last weekends, but it's a shame so
few students are taking advan
tage of the jazz performances at
this magnificently beautiful hotel.
The prices are not high, and it is
open to those under 21. Stan Getz
opens Fob. 6.
The Trident in Sausalito will
feature tho Jean Hoffman Trio
through Fob. 8. Definitely booked
are Jon Hendricks with a "Jazz
Ensemble" Fob. 9, tho Denny Zeit
lin Trio March 22. Bill Evans for
a month beginning April 25, and
Pete Jolly on May 2i5. Open to
minors, this is the most inexpen
sive of all tho clubs, and tho fin
est time to hit it is Sunday after
noons, when you can lunch, drink,
catch tho sailboat races, and hear
some excellent jazz all at once.
