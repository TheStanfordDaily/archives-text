# 'Mr. Roberts' Fully Realized Production
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
Although "Mister Roberts" is
- obviously a delightful comedy,
it is essentially much more. II
is a tribute to the American men
during World War II who sailed
"from Tedium to Apathy and
back again—with an occasional
side trip to Monotony."
Under David Tihmai's imagina
tive and resourceful direction, the
current production of this Thomas
! Heggen-Joshua Logan play at the
Circle Star Theatre fully realizes
1 both the surface comedy and the
; frustration of a crew whose high
-1 est honor has been a palm tree
| for "delivering more toothpaste
| and toilet paper than any o t h e r
Navy cargo ship in the safe area
of the Pacific."
Superb Sets
Tihmar is helped considerably
by Hal Shafer's superb sets and
A 1 Millman's lighting. Shafer
manages to suggest the confine
ment felt by Mr. Roberts and the
of the crew in their re
spective cabins but, in the same
space, makes the Captain's office
seem comfortable.
Tihmar is also aided by a cast
| that is—without exception—excel
lent. In the title role Hugh
O'Brian presents a carefully
| modulated portrayal of a man
' afraid that the war is passing him
I by. He is at his best in his final
I scene when, without resorting to

I cheap melodramatics, he is genu
j inely touching.
Pat O'Brien is winning as Doc,
a sort of father-figure to Mr. Rob
erts and the entire crew. Especi
ally good in the wild scene where
he and Mr. Roberts "distill"
Scotch, lie also contributes im
mensely to the delicate mood sus
tained through much of the play's
last two scenes.
Kerr Outstanding
John Kerr's performance as En
sign Pulver is also outstanding.
While rightly emphasizing the
comic aspects of the hapless, lazy,
sex-oriented Pulver, Kerr man

tyrannical ''absolute monarch" un
derstandable and even sympathe
-1 tic. Gardenia prevents the Captain
i from seeming the one-dimensional
Captain Bligh that he might be

When, late in the play, Mr. Rob
jerls says,"I love these bastards,
I Doc. I think they're the greatest
guys on this earth," the audience
readily believes him. Each sup
porting player is just right for
his part, and to single out any one

Superb Sets
Tihmar is helped considerably
by Hal Shafer's superb sets and
A 1 Millman's lighting. Shafer
manages to suggest the confine
ment felt by Mr. Roberts and the
of the crew in their re
spective cabins but, in the same
space, makes the Captain's office
seem comfortable.
Tihmar is also aided by a cast

O'Brian presents a carefully
| modulated portrayal of a man
' afraid that the war is passing him
I by. He is at his best in his final
I scene when, without resorting to

I cheap melodramatics, he is genu

Pat O'Brien is winning as Doc,
a sort of father-figure to Mr. Rob
erts and the entire crew. Especi
ally good in the wild scene where
he and Mr. Roberts "distill"
Scotch, lie also contributes im
mensely to the delicate mood sus
tained through much of the play's
last two scenes.
Kerr Outstanding
John Kerr's performance as En
sign Pulver is also outstanding.
While rightly emphasizing the
comic aspects of the hapless, lazy,
sex-oriented Pulver, Kerr man
