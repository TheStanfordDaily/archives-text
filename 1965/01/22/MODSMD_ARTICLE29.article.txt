# FILM REVIEW
## My Lady' Disappointing 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
"My Fair Lady," as a movie,
has all the songs and virtually all
the dialogue that made it the
world's most famous musical. It
has brilliant color, gorgeous eos
tumes and huge sets.
And therein lies its problem. In
its transferral to the screen, "My
Fair Lady" has been turned from
an essentially intimate musical
into a truly spectacular movie.
"My Fair Lady" has gone Holly
wood—in the worst meaning of
the phrase.
The movie's faults are especially
evident in the first moments of
the opening scene, filled with
gimmicky camera angles and un
necessary intercutting from the
inside of the opera house to the
outside and back again. (Why
they even show the opera house
interior is not clear. >
Enter Eliza
A flower girl comes on th e
screen. She gets knocked over
and, when she sits up so that she
is facing the camera, everyone in
the audience turns to his neigh
bor and says, "That's Audrey Hep
burn!"
Indeed it is, and in spite of a
commendable Cockney accent, she
is totally out of place as Eliza
Doolittle: she not only doesn't act
like a flower girl, she doesn't
LOOK like a flower girl. Th e
clothes are dirty, but the face is
as pure and pale as a china doll,
with every hair neatly in place.
Miss Hepburn is, in fact, one of
the film's greatest liabilities. Al
though she is charming and lovely
as a lady, she is so unconvincing
as a flower girl that the transfor
mation from the "squashed cab
bage leaf" of Covent Garden to
the "royal princess" of the Em
bassy Ball is ineffective. And th"
transformation is, after all, what
"My Fair Lady" is all about. In

(addition, the difference between
1 Miss Hepburn's speaking voice
i and Marni Nixon's singing voice
on Eliza's songs is jarringly ap
parent all too often.
Subtleties Lost
The film's other great liability
is that it has been over-produced.
| The orchestration, especially on
J "Why Can't The English?" is too
lush, losing many of the subtle
ties it had on the stage. And the
sets sem designed to make the
audience "ooh" and "ah," but they
I are so huge that the actors seem
i lost in front of them.
There are other things, too:
• Why, at Ascot, is Miss Hep
burn's gown black and white
like every other woman in l h e
i scene? When Cecil Beaton de
i signed the costumes for the show,
i he deliberately put Eliza in an
other color to make her stand out
I and to show how out of place she
is. But. for some inexplicable rea
son, when he designed the film's
costumes he dressed her like
j everyone else.
• Why does Higgins a pho
j netics teacher say "as if she
I was" and "as though I was?" And
why does his housekeeper, Mrs.
Pearce, ask Eliza, "Can 1 help
you?" This is sheer carelessness.
• Why is the last part of "Just
I You Wait" turned into a dream
I sequence, with the king singing
"Done!" and Eliza finishing tne
line by singing "says the king
with a stroke." It just doesn't
' work.
Not A Bad Film
11" all this makes "My Fair
j Lady" seem like a bad film, that
really isn't so. The screenplay has
been transferred almost intact
from the stage and many of the
I changes and additions like *he
bath scene ARE for the better,
lit some scenes, especially "I
Could Have Danced All Night,"
I director George Cukor has taken
1 full advantage of the camera's mo

bilily without sacrificing cither
the play's intent or intimacy.
The acting with the afore
mentioned exception of Miss Hep
burn is generally excellent , and
Hex Harrison's superb portrayal
of Higgins will no doubt earn him
a richly deserved Oscar in April.
And it IS beautiful. The sets
decorated almost to ihe saturation
point with flowers and cos
tumes are stunning.
But, finally, "My Fair Lady" is
a disappointment. They have tak
en a great show, spent more than
$17,000,000 and only come up with
a good movie.
