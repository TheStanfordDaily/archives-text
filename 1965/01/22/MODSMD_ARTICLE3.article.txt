# Arthur Koestler Calls Creativity A 'Bisociation' Of Idea Codes
## 
### HILDA KOSSOFF 
Creative thinking is basically a process of "putting two and two
together to make five," novelist-scientist Arthur Koestler told a
large audience gathered in Memorial Auditorium last night.
Scientists and artists make their most novel discoveries by
drawing analogies between seemingly unrelated concepts — a kind

of "bisociativo" thinking which-*
integrates two frames of refer
ence, he said.
"THK MOKl'l familiar the paths
combined, the more striking the
synthesis," Koestler said, pointing .
to Gutenberg's printing press
part block-printer, part winepress.
Koestler distinguished between

►
creative, bisociativo thinking and
the more common method of solv
ing problems "associative think
ing" or the logical application of
previous experience and habit pat
' terns, which he termed "codes."
Associative thinking supplies
necessary order and stability. It
is quite sufficient for questions
with parallels in the past, but
cannot meet new situations, he
said.
ASSOCIATIVE th i 11 k i 11 g is
likely to follow a conscious and
disciplined verbal pattern. The
bisoeiative variety, on the other
hand, is often visual, intuitive,
dreamlike. It operates on a sub
conscious level.
However, Koestler warned
with typical dry humor "you
must not imagine the subcon
scious as the basement of the
mind, where the little Socratic
demon does your homework for
you; it is rather a way of using
looser and more primitive "codes"
and escaping the built-in preju
dices and strictures of logic.
Creativity in art and science is
basically similar, according to
Koestler, and the boundary be
tween the two is ill-defined. Art

scientists refer to the "beauty"
of their equations. "Inside the
