# After The Inauguration
## 
### 
The inauguration oi Lyndon Haines Johnson
to his first full term as President of the United
States is past, and the nation, notabh unarousecl
by the President's not ineloquent call for justice,
liberty and unity, is settling down for lour and
probably eight years of a new style of national
leadership.
While members of the conservative opposi
tion can find little joy in such a prospect, the last
election proved, if nothing else, that Americans
are simply not yet ready to listen to the disturb
ing voices of those who warn that the trends in
domestic and international affairs are leading to
disaster.
And so, with the largest Congressional ma
jorities in almost thirty years, President Johnson
should have little problem getting legislation
passed to take to the Great Society.
But before Johnson's first 100 days begin
turning out the expected volume of administra
tion bills, a few words of caution are in order.
Certainly the vision of the Groat Societv is,
by itself, a goal on which most Americans agree:
it is a kind of heaven on earth, without suffering,
insecurity or strife. While questions can be raised
as to whether lift 1 in such a society would be in
tcresting enough to bother with, or whether the
attainment of the goals may require means w Inch
negate the very individual we are trving to en
hance, political rhetoric in democracies is likely
to retain the vision Johnson has outlined.
Hut in the haziness of idealism and "consen
sus," in the calls for unit) and in the talk of "the
president of all the people," let us not lorget that
there remain deep, fundamental disagreements

within the American body politic and that the
minority should not be automatically ignored.
To condemn the dissenters from the Johnson
programs as being merely divisive is a kind of
intolerant egoistic orthodoxy which can only
choke a source of restraint and skepticism which
is vital in any sound democratic political process.
With sure majorities in both houses of Con
gress, it is more crucial than ever in recent years
that what is left of the opposition party be most
active and vocal in its criticism of the proposals
Johnson puts forth. Legislation that can be
passed just because it was issued by the White
House can be careless legislation, expedient mea
sures taken without careful attention to the wider
consqucnces they will have on the economy, on
the Federal system, and on the moral fiber of the
people.
With Johnson's emphasis on practical poli
ties and making everybody happy, rather than
on hammering out, with the advice of the top
experts in the field, the very best in legislation,
regardless of political consequences, the danger
in the next few years of colossal legislative blun
ders is all the greater.
In short, in the post-election apathy and, for
some, despair, let the people not forget to be
vigilant, to the end that their leaders do not grow
flabln and corrupt with assured victories and un
conditional mandates. The loyal opposition can,
even in its reduced status, keep before the public
eye a worthy alternative to the prevailing poli
cies. il the alternative is positive and the case
well-stated, such opposition can only be con
structive.
