"Stop The World I Want To Get Off" is billed
as a new-style musical. It is less that than an
eclectic musical, gathering ideas from the tradi
tional musical, pantomime, British music halls
and numerous other entertainment media.
This is not to say that "Stop The World" is
either a bad or disjointed show. Co-authors Leslie
Bricusse and Anthony Newley have written a
unique show that is amusing, often thought-pro
voking and, in Leslie Abbot's inventive produc
tion at the Comedia Repertory Theatre, well worth
seeing.
simple Plot
I'he plot is simple it follows one man from
birth to marriage, business, politics and, finally,
death. Included along the way are such well-known
songs as "Gonna Build A Mountain," "Once In A

Lifetime" and "What Kind Of Fool Am I?"
As Littlechap the man -Charles Graziani is
onstage throughout most of the show. Although
his singing tends to go flat, he more than com
pensates with his marvelous acting and miming.
Lila Lloyd is outstanding in the quadruple role
of Evie- Littlechap's wife- and the three women
with whom he has affairs tor would-be affairs).
It's too bad she doesn't get more chances to use
her lovely singing voice.
Commendable Chorus
Candace Kuehlenz and Emily Newbury are both
quite good as the two daughters and are also a
part of the commendable nine-girl chorus that
lakes part in and comments on the action.
Robert MacKinnon's precise musical direction
and Gra/iani's costumes add greatly to the success
of "Stop The World"â€”an auspicious start for
Comedia in their new theater.
