## What Intent Behind Discussion Of Rush? 
### 
Dear Sir:
Perhaps Mr. Beck's essay in j
Thursday's Daily was intended 1
only to stimulate discussion of
the issue of rush, the perennial J
problem to which Mr. Beck de-j
votes his talent and insight each i
year. If that was the purpose, |
then one may overlook the innu-1
endos, half-truths, and intima
tions of evil associated with <
"Greeks." But if his purpose was I
to present an intelligent, reason
able critique of fraternities; if;
his purpose was to criticize a
system of living to which many j
students and administrators are!
devoted; if his purpose was to i
plant seeds of doubt and suspi-j
eion in the minds of freshmen;
if these were the motives of the!
article, the result may be con-1
sidered only as reckless and irrtf- j
sponsible defaming of 30 per cent
of the men of Stanford Univer-!
sity.
His article raised many ques-j
tions but offered no answers. It |
condemned many things without
reason for condemnation. It ap-1
proved many things without rea-;
son for approval.
Mr. Beck feels that rush is or
ganized solely upon the caprice,
of the fraternities: "The IFC
proposal includes, among other
things, an additional open house'
to give the frosh their 'second
chance,' probably to insure that
there were no latent Greeks left
in the refuse heap after the first
rush . . ." Has he considered that
the second open house was j
planned specifically to allow each j
freshman to visit more houses? !
Has he considered that the rush !
book encourages them to see as ;
many houses as is possible?
Mr. Beck states that, "Dean i
Gordon and all of his prize com- ;
mittees will continue to drift,
from one load policy to another
as long as they and others in j
authority continue to dodge the j
real issues." What, Mr. Beck, are ,
these roal issues?
He suggests that "... the |
only way to maintain the Wilbur
House system is to end rush al
together and if necessary end the
fraternity system, for the Univer
sity-sponsored Wilbur System is
in direct conflict with the Univer
sity-condoned fraternity system."
In the first place, it would seem
to me that any administration !
which sinks as much time, effort j
and money into maintaining the i
fraternity system at Stanford ;
(the clusters) is far past the i
stage of mere condoning. Second
ly, he has not proved conclusively
or even attempted to prove ration- i
ally what is "bad" about the frat
ernity system and what is "good" !
about the Wilbur system. It is !

responsible, (hen, to suggest an
nihilation of one system for the
other? Has he even considered
that part of the value of the Wil
bur system rests in its very tran
sitory status? It was obviously
never intended to be permanent,
but to be a means of moving
smoothly from high school into
upper-class university living.
Mr. Beck states that, "The re
sult of all this is that the Wilbur
House system begins to totter in
Winter Quarter, and with the ad
vent of spring rush totally col
lapses." Once again, he has failed
to define precisely what he is
talking about. What, specifically,
begins to "totter"? Doesn't he re
alize that no matter where a
freshman is to live as a sopho
more he must begin looking past
Wilbur during Spring Quarter
and make some decisions on his
own. This factor is part of the
maturing elements of the univer
sity. Whether a freshman chooses
a fraternity or not is immaterial.
He IS going to be leaving Wilbur.
In general. Mr. Beck's article s
is extremely disappointing in its
unproved assertions and insinua- >
tions, especially in a community J
such as Stanford University)
where reason supposedly wins
out over bellicosity.
If The Daily is attempting to
keep the discussion of rush on an
unemotional plane, such incon- j
clusively supported articles'
should not be featured as a part
of a responsible publication.

â€¢ Smoking Series
Dear Sir:
It strikes me that the Herb
Caen style of journalism with
which your reporter is follow
ing the Smoking Clinic is, as ap
plied to this case, in doubtful
taste. Speaking both as an ex
smoker and as a psychologist in
terested in techniques for elimi
nating smoking I can find very
little that is amusing about i
smoking, or about people who
are unable to take it seriously.
The style of the reporting is
characterized by a glibness which
is all too contagious. The con
firmed smoker who reads th e
series is helped once again to
laugh off his maladaptive behav
ior.
I suggest that your reporter, j
a smoker who apparently wishes
to overcome the habit, finish the
series by writing sincerely about
his experiences, his difficulties,
and his criticisms of the pro
gram.
Sincerely,
KAKI, P. KOKNKJ
