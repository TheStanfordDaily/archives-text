# Woodward Views America In "Second Reconstruction"
## 
### NANCY STEFFEN Associate Editor 
During the past decade the
South has been "reliving an old
trauma"—"a second reconstruc
tion" in the form of iho civil
rights movement, Yale professor
of history C. Vann Woodward
told a large Tresidder audience
yesterday.
The final extent of this "second
leconstruction" cannot yet be de
termined, but its initial impact
has assured that, for both North
and South," things can never be
quite the same again."
WOODWARD described th e

first, post-civil war reconstruction
as an "abortive revolution" result
ing in little substantial change in
the Negro's position. "If it had
been up to the white man," he
continued, "the second recon
struction would have gone the
way of the first, with white men
solving their regional differences
at the expense of the black man
. . . But this time it hasn't been
up to the white man alone; the
Negro has been an active parti
cipant.
"The first "crack in the na
tional consensus" on race came
at the 1948 Democratic National
Convention. The Democr a ti c

Party platform that year clearly
symbolized a "return to principle
. . . a shift from paternalism to
equality . . . The South split and
remains split to this day."
IN THE FACE of an apparent
ly alien and hostile world, South
erners have felt the necessity to
"close ranks—-to erect an intel
lectual blockage." In Mississippi
and elsewhere this has resulted
in what Professor James Silver
termed "the closed society."
Without active Negro participa
tion, and concentrated Negro
voting power, this second recon
struction might have ended in a
quiet "compromise of tokenism."
Woodward noted. Such has not
been the case, however: ''Th e
Northern chickens have begun to
come home to roost; ... it: has
begun to dawn on Northern ur
ban centers that radical recon
struction this time is going to
apply to them."
THE REALIZATION has fo
mented vocal reaction; but there
has been progress too: "The sec
ond reconstruction has turned the
corner- emerged from the woods
where traditional compromises
and sellouts are made ... It has
already secured more achieve
ments than the entire first recon
struction. for all its blood and
thunder."
Nevertheless, Woodward con
cluded with an admonition: "The
South is slowly moving towards
an approximation of conditions in
other parts of the country; how
ever, perhaps it would be well to
look closely at those conditions
before jumping to naive optim
ism."
