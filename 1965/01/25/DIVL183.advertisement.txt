As Time Runs Out
'I'hi.' general Epistle of Jude in the New Testament (written by Judc, the
brother of James ami of the Lord Jesus Christ) was written as a warning against
certain nominal Christians who threaten to undermine believers by their immoral
character and conduct. Those who follow in their paths can be certain of God's
judgment. Jude urges believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. <( hristians) to fidelity
of faith and constructive spiritual love:
"To Christians everywhere, for God tin' Father has chosen you and kept you
for Jesus Christ. May you lie given niort and more of God's kindness, peace, and
love ... I write to you urging you to stoutly defend the truth which God gave,
once for ill ... I say this because some godless teachers have wormed their way
in among you saying after we become Christians we can do just as we like without
fear of God's punishment. The fate of such people was written long ago, for they
have turned against our only Lord and Master, Jesus ( Inist ... I remind you
of those angels who once were pure and holy, but willingly turned to a life of sin.
Now God lias them chained up in prisons of darkness, waiting for the judgment
day. And don't forget the citie- >>112 Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring
towns, all full of Inst of every kind including lust of men for other men. Those
cities were destroyed by fire and continue to be a warning to us that there is a
hell in which sinners are punished. Yet these false teachers go on living their
immoral lives, degrading tluir own bodies and laughing at those in authority over
them . . . These men mock and curse at everything they do not understand, and,
like animals, they do whatever they feel like, thereby ruining tlu ir souls . . . they
are like clouds blowing over dry land without giving rain, promising much, but
giving nothing. They are like fruit trees without any fruit at picking time. They
are not only dead, but doubly dead, for thc> have been pulled out. roots and all,
for burning. All they leave behind them is shame and disgrace like the dirty foam
along the beach left by the wild waves. They wander around looking as bright as
stars, but ahead of them is everlasting gbtoin and darkness that God has ready
for them.
"Dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus < hrist told you. that
in the last times there would collie these scoffers whose whole purpose ill life is
to enjoy themselves in every evil way imagineable. They stir up arguments; they
love the evil things of the world; they do not have the Holy Spirit living in them
. . . build u|> your lives ever more strongly upon the foundation of our Holy faith,
learning to pray in the power and strength of the Holy Spirit. Stay always within
th< boundaries where God's love can reach and bless you. Wait patiently for the
eternal life that our Lord Jesus Christ is going to give us. Try to help those who
argue against you. lie merciful to those in doubt. Save some by snatching them as
from tlu very flames of hell itself. And as for others, help them to find the Lord
by being kind to them, but fear the possibility of being pulled along with their sins,
liate every trace of their sin while being merciful to them as sinners.
"And now, glory to Him Who alone is God, Who saves us through Jesus Christ
our Lord; yes, splendor, and majesty, all power and authority are His from the
beginning: 11 is they are and His they evermore will be. And He is able to keep
you from slipping and falling away, and to bring you, sinless and perfect, into His
glorious presence with mighty shouts of everlasting joy. Amen" (The Epistle of
Jude. Living Letters Translation).

As Time Runs Out
'I'hi.' general Epistle of Jude in the New Testament (written by Judc, the
brother of James ami of the Lord Jesus Christ) was written as a warning against
certain nominal Christians who threaten to undermine believers by their immoral
character and conduct. Those who follow in their paths can be certain of God's
judgment. Jude urges believers in the Lord Jesus Christ. <( hristians) to fidelity
of faith and constructive spiritual love:
"To Christians everywhere, for God tin' Father has chosen you and kept you
for Jesus Christ. May you lie given niort and more of God's kindness, peace, and
love ... I write to you urging you to stoutly defend the truth which God gave,
once for ill ... I say this because some godless teachers have wormed their way
in among you saying after we become Christians we can do just as we like without
fear of God's punishment. The fate of such people was written long ago, for they
have turned against our only Lord and Master, Jesus ( Inist ... I remind you
of those angels who once were pure and holy, but willingly turned to a life of sin.
Now God lias them chained up in prisons of darkness, waiting for the judgment
day. And don't forget the citie- >>112 Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring
towns, all full of Inst of every kind including lust of men for other men. Those
cities were destroyed by fire and continue to be a warning to us that there is a
hell in which sinners are punished. Yet these false teachers go on living their
immoral lives, degrading tluir own bodies and laughing at those in authority over
them . . . These men mock and curse at everything they do not understand, and,
like animals, they do whatever they feel like, thereby ruining tlu ir souls . . . they
are like clouds blowing over dry land without giving rain, promising much, but
giving nothing. They are like fruit trees without any fruit at picking time. They
