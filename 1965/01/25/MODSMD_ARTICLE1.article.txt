cided at an urgent meeting yesterday to keep supporting the civilian
government of Premier Tran Van Huong.
Informed sources said it was a near tiling to a military coup.
Armed forces commander Lt. Gen. Nguyen Khanh and other top offi
cers decide to keep their weight behind Huong for the time being,
despite Buddhist-led antigovernment disorders, these informants said.
But there is a feling, as disorders continue, that pressure is sure
to mount within the army's high command for a military takeover
of the government.
The campaign against U.S. Ambassador Maxwell D. Taylor and
the United States seemed to be mounting. The Buddhists blame Tay
lor for U.S. support of Huong.
The central Vietnamese cities of Hue and Da Nang were placed
off limits to U.S. servicemen in the wake of the sacking of the U.S.
Information Service building in Hue on Saturday.

funeral of Sir Winston Churchill.
Johnson, holding his second bedside news conference in his room
at the naval hospital in Bethesda said, "A lot depends on how I feel

view of the heavy cold and sore throat that put him in the hospital
early Saturday. He said: "Its all over with."
Doctors did not quite agree with that statement. The ailment still
is not entirely cleared up. However, he did not cough during an eight
minute, question-and-answer session with five reporters. And his
voice no longer seemed hoarse through he spoke very softly.
If doctors give their okay, Johnson is expected to attend the
Churchill rites Saturday.
