# WIN 6-0 IN RAIN
## Ruggers Beat Olympic Club 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford Rugby team won
its second straight game Satur
day, defeating the San Francisco
Olympic Club, 6-0, on the rain
swept Stanford Rugby field.
The tempo of the game was
slowed considerably by gusts of
wind and rain which fell during
the entire contest.
THE FIRST minutes of the
game were largely controlled by
the Olympic Club which domi
nated the scrums and lineouts.
However excellent kicks by T i m
Hansel, Brian Whipp and Dick
Ragsdale kept the Olympic Club
out of scoring range.
The only serious Olympic scor
ing threat was stopped when
Steve Purcell, playing center 'â€¢%,
intercepted one of the visiting
team's passes.
Stanford began to take offen
sive control of the game at the
end of the first half. The Indians
nearly scored when Dick Rags
dale, after taking an Olympic kick
on his own 40-yard line, passed to
Brian Whipp who passed the ball
to Steve Purcell. Purcell kicked
deep into Olympic territory a n d
almost succeeded in recovering
his own kick in the Olympic Club
goal area before the opposing full
back punted the ball out of scor
ing position. However, the half
ended with the score deadlocked
at 0-0.

THE SECOND half saw a con
tinuous defensive battle as both
teams had trouble controlling tho
slippery ball effectively. Stanfoid
was taking the game to tho Olym
pic- team for a large part of the
second half of play but the In
dians were unable to score unt.il
the Olympic Club was called for
an offside penalty.
Jon Brandin kicked the 35-yard
penalty kick straight through
the uprights and Stanford had
a 3-0 lead. Two minutes later.
, Brandin scored on another penalty
kick also from 35-yards out.
Olympic came back with a
1 strong offensive effort but, their
scoring attempts were turned
back by the defensive kicks of
Stanford fullback, Jim Lynden.
The game ended with Stanford
j victorious, 6-0.
AFTER THE game Coach Pete
j Kmetovie said that he was "some
what disappointed with the play
' of the backs on defense. However
I felt that the scrum got stronger
! as the game progressed."
Kmetovie praised the offensive
line-out play of Tim Hansel a n d
j Randy Vahan, and the defensive
work of John Faber and Jim Lyn
ley.
N'ext week the Card ruggers
play the Peacock Gap Rugby Club
in an away game. Peacock Gap
is a new team but has the nucleus
of last years fine University Club
rugby team. The Indians will be
seeking to run their undefeated
j string to three games.
Following the varsity game the

Stanford first JV team lost to the|
Olympic Club second team 11-3.1
The second Indian JV's were de
feated by the University Club of
Berkeley, 9-3. Both JV teams lost
largely as a result of the superior
scrum play of their more experi
enced opponents.
