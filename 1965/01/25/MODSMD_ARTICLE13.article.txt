### JACK GASKILL 
The Stanford varsity wrestlers
won their second dual meet vic
tory in as many attempts this sea
son with a 31-5 drubbing of the
University of Santa Clara before
200 enthusiastic spectators Friday
night in the Pavilion.
Losing only the 130 pound
match, and that by forfeit, the
Indians picked up three falls and
two lopsided decisions in sweeping
the match from the Broncs.
AT 123 POUNDS, A 1 Gonzales
got the evening off to a good start
with a third period fall over Brian
Barr.
The highest scoring match came
when Mike Davision downed Bob
Ernst of the Broncos by an 11-4
count, with two takedowns, two
reversals, and a 3-point nearfall.
The feature match of the eve
ning, pitting Stanford's unde
feated heavyweight Bruce Wul
helm against former U.S. Olym
pian Pat Lovell had to be stopped
in the first period when Lovell
reaggravated a shoulder injury he
sustained in Tokyo last fall.
WILHELM was loading 20
when the injury occured.
In addition to the regular
matches, several exhibition
matches were held. Dick Ander
son, a regular at 137 pounds, de
feated Larry Palla 10-0 after the
latter failed to make weight in
his own class.
