# In Loco Parentis
## 
### 
Three weeks ago the AWS conducted a com
prehensive survey of women's and parents' atti
tudes toward social regulations. The results of
that survey are still being compiled, but mean
while, as if there were 110 burning issues left at
all, the discussion of proposed changes and of
the philosophy justifying social legs has halted.
The Daily, in an effort to promote the ex
change of opinion on this matter, has attempted
to interview a number of administrators, mostly
deans, about the reasons behind social regula
tions. Either the interviews have been refused
or pertinent questions evaded. The excuse: "We
don't want to say anything now for fear of up
setting the current deliberations."
Especially in need of review is the philoso
phy behind what is called the University's policy
in loco parentis, or the "parent-away-from-home
syndrome."
To be sure, discussion 011 this topic is often
unproductive, because of the rather uncompro
mising, absolute arguments of both students and
administrators. The former will usually argue
that "the University has no business concerning
itself about my private affairs." The latter, espe
cially particular personalities within the adminis
tration, will take the attitude that "Well, 1
wouldn't want my daughter out after 2:30, and
that's how Stanford is going to operate as long
as I'm around."
The students* argument fails to take into ac
count the expectations of parents and alumni,
with which the administration must deal.
Furthermore, men and women who arrive at
Stanford their freshman year have just emerged
from the homes of those same, perhaps over
concerned parents. We doubt (and only in retro
spect) that all freshmen men and women are

emotionally capable of handling sudden and
complete freedom of action within areas their
parents regulated very closely. Rules can prevent
many a sad case of frosh overzealousness. In
short, the University can and should operate in
loco parentis, at least in a limited sense.
But there are policies, not so numerous and
intolerable at Stanford as at other universities,
which go beyond the reasonable limits. Fatherly
(or motherly) deans or dormitory superinten
dents, and parents themselves, sometimes fail
to realize that their "children" must one day be
free, and that responsibility will be developed
only if students are treated as adults.
Which raises the question of when students
should be so treated. We think that after the
cushioning influence of freshman regulations,
students lives should be relatively unregulated,
especially so for students who are seniors or over
21.
This means that hours for upper class women
be eliminated, as they are for men; that women
be allowed to live off campus; that open house
hours be limited only by dictation of convenience
for the dormitory residents; and that the Univer
sity cease to concern itself with the private lives
of the indiivdual in the social realm.
We realize, and have stated so, that the AWS
must allow for practical considerations of the
attitude of women and parents and the degree
of cooperation within the administration. The
University is not likely to accept such a revolu
tionary change, at least not all at once. And most
students have shown no marked dissatisfaction
with many of the rules as they exist.
At the same time the principle of greater stu
dent freedom and responsibility should not be
completely lost in a fit of wrangling about the
proper sign-in time.

dents, and parents themselves, sometimes fail
to realize that their "children" must one day be
free, and that responsibility will be developed
only if students are treated as adults.
Which raises the question of when students
should be so treated. We think that after the
cushioning influence of freshman regulations,
students lives should be relatively unregulated,
especially so for students who are seniors or over
21.
This means that hours for upper class women
be eliminated, as they are for men; that women
be allowed to live off campus; that open house
hours be limited only by dictation of convenience
for the dormitory residents; and that the Univer
sity cease to concern itself with the private lives
of the indiivdual in the social realm.
We realize, and have stated so, that the AWS
must allow for practical considerations of the
attitude of women and parents and the degree
of cooperation within the administration. The
University is not likely to accept such a revolu
tionary change, at least not all at once. And most
students have shown no marked dissatisfaction
with many of the rules as they exist.
At the same time the principle of greater stu
dent freedom and responsibility should not be
completely lost in a fit of wrangling about the
proper sign-in time.
Three weeks ago the AWS conducted a com
prehensive survey of women's and parents' atti
tudes toward social regulations. The results of
that survey are still being compiled, but mean
while, as if there were 110 burning issues left at
all, the discussion of proposed changes and of
the philosophy justifying social legs has halted.
The Daily, in an effort to promote the ex
change of opinion on this matter, has attempted
to interview a number of administrators, mostly
deans, about the reasons behind social regula
tions. Either the interviews have been refused
or pertinent questions evaded. The excuse: "We
don't want to say anything now for fear of up
setting the current deliberations."
Especially in need of review is the philoso
phy behind what is called the University's policy
in loco parentis, or the "parent-away-from-home
syndrome."
To be sure, discussion 011 this topic is often
unproductive, because of the rather uncompro
mising, absolute arguments of both students and
administrators. The former will usually argue
that "the University has no business concerning
itself about my private affairs." The latter, espe
cially particular personalities within the adminis
tration, will take the attitude that "Well, 1
wouldn't want my daughter out after 2:30, and
that's how Stanford is going to operate as long
as I'm around."
The students* argument fails to take into ac
count the expectations of parents and alumni,
with which the administration must deal.
Furthermore, men and women who arrive at
Stanford their freshman year have just emerged
from the homes of those same, perhaps over
concerned parents. We doubt (and only in retro
spect) that all freshmen men and women are

emotionally capable of handling sudden and
complete freedom of action within areas their
parents regulated very closely. Rules can prevent
many a sad case of frosh overzealousness. In
short, the University can and should operate in
loco parentis, at least in a limited sense.
But there are policies, not so numerous and
intolerable at Stanford as at other universities,
which go beyond the reasonable limits. Fatherly
(or motherly) deans or dormitory superinten
dents, and parents themselves, sometimes fail
to realize that their "children" must one day be
free, and that responsibility will be developed
only if students are treated as adults.
