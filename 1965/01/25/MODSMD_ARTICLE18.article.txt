# Editor, The Daily
## Some Frosh Like The Fraternities! 
### 
i Dear Sir:
In reply to Mr. Beck's column
in The Daily knocking the Admin
istration, the IFC rush policy, and
fraternities in general, I would
like to ask him a question. Has it
ever occurred to you that there
I are many freshmen who enjoy
the social and fraternal life of
fered by Stanford's fraternities?
T cannot help but feel Mr. Beck's
sharp criticisms may be the result
of personal rejection by frater
nities or of a single-minded re
fusal to believe that all Stanford
men do not love and cherish the
cold sterility and mass herding
techniques of Wilbur Hall. I'm
! sure many ex-freshmen will agree
with me that the only singular
! benefit to be derived from Wilbur
is the personal contact and friend
ships created in reaction to the
forced environment of freshman
year.
As far as the fraternties "shat
tering the University sponsored
Wilbur House system," I will
say that no one has yet been able
to explain or define to me ex
actly what is to be shattered,
since nothing I have experienced
or observed in Wilbur is strong
enough or lasting enough to
break, except the foot thick walls.
A "system" is only as good as
its inhabitants, and as long as
you have divergent attitude
groups imprisoned in Wilbur, you
have a disunified ineffective sys
tem. Therefore, Mr. Beck, why
jwon't you be satisfied that those
freshmen desiring to become fra
ternity men (yes, there are those
| who desire this goal) are able to
extract themselves from Wilbur
into three years of life as they
wish to live it, and you may tod
dle off to Stern Hall, taking with
you those who do not desire fra
ternities, but would rather love,
i honor, cherish, and obey the Wil
l bur System for their remaining
| years at Stanford.

• Religious Dialogue
Dear Sir:
As a Christian T feel moved to
! comment upon the advertisements
! which appear in Tin* Daily under
i the auspices of Contemporary
1 Christians on Campus and also
upon recent responses to certain
I of those advertisements by Jew
ish students, indignant or other
i wise.
The endeavor to advertise God
! in a newspaper alongside adver
i tisements for Wholesale Jeweler,
Discount Records, and Old Time
Prices al the Alley is of question
able taste and dubious effect. In
addition to the inappropriate ex
ternal context of the ads, there
; have been times when either the
: tone or content of the Contempo
rary Christian's ads have embar
rassed me very much. But then,
on the other hand, my understand
ing of the Christian faith has been
increased at times by an insight
from one of the ads. Therefore,

I find myself with a mixed over
all response . . . composed of both
embarrassment and appreciation.
If Christians are ever going to
proved a meaningful witness to
the world, they will have to do it
in a spirit of true sharing a n d
humility. If any meaningful and
creative dialogue between Chris
tians and Jews is to occur, there
can Ik? no place for self-righteous,
if - you - want - to - know - where*
your - God - is - we've - got - him
attitude on the part of Christians.
(Jews too, of course, must enter
such a dialogue in a spirit of hu
mility.) However, some of the mu
tual suspicions, misunderstand
ings, and misconstructions which
have appeared in The Daily in re
cent days testify to the lack of any
such Jewish-Christian student dia
logue on the Stanford campus.
Recognizing the potential for
significant person-to-person dia
logue among students of different
religious traditions, Stanford
Christian Fellowship w is h es to
initiate Jewish-Christian dialogue
at Stanford. We extend an open
invitation to all Jewish students,
particularly those who have con
tributed to this column in the past
few days, to attend our next regu
lar meeting on Wednesday eve
ning, January 27, at 7:15 in Tre
sidder Memorial Union. At that
time we shall be honored to hear
Dr. David Noel Freedman, editor
of the Journal of Biblical Litera
ture and Professor of Old Testa
ment at San Francisco Theologi
cal Seminary, who will speak on
the topic "Covenant and Messiah
in the Old Testament." This in- j
vitation is not extended in the j
hope that everyone who comes
will swallow a sugar-coated pill 1
and go away feeling warm inside. j
all differences hav in g been j
glossed over. Rather it is extended i
in the hope of open encounter |
and significant interchange. Since |
Dr. Freedman is both an Old
Testament scholar of interna
tional esteem and a convert to
Christianity from Judaism, we
feel ho should be a catalyst to
such an interchange.

• Sublime Ridiculous
Dear Sir:
Re your article, "Mad Artists
Strike!": 1 think I'll save it and
use it as a rag to shine my shoes
with.
I agree that there are many
times when one should be serious, j
but Prof. Kahn is making the sub- i
lime ridiculous. Abstract expres
sionism on a construction fence—
Ha! Let the 'mad artists' con
tinue; their work is spontaneous
and unorganized and therefore
more interesting and healthy.
Besides, how does one vanda
lize an ugly construction fence? I
Even the construction workers
sometimes do a little art work of
their own. JOIIN BABY
