# Out Of The Smoke— And Into The Fire?
## 
### ODIN SMOKER 
I have a confession to make.
After 72 hours, 1 coveted a
cigarette. I finally bummed
one in the Union from some
one who didn't know me. I
lit the filter and got sick.
Afterwards, I attended the
fourth session of the Five
Days Stop Smoking Clinic.
They passed through the au
dience a cancerous human
lung and a dog's lung. I got
sick again.
As in the past sessions, we
saw a movie, a satire on
cigarette advertising. Th e
film was about the Old Vir
gina Tobacco Company a n d
their campaign to have every
man, woman, and c hi I <1
("especially the soldiers in
the hospitals") smoke llum
hars, I lie "menthol-carbon
ated" cigarettes.
During the movie, another
white mouse died. .Non-smok
ing white mice live longer.
After the movie, Dr. Burton
of the medical center lectured
on the five words, "II can't
happen to me." He quoted the
American Cancer Society fig
ures <ni lung cancer among
smokers a n d non-smokers.
Apparently, the chances for a
smoker to get lung cancer are
one in ten while for a non
smoker, they are one in 270.
The doctor contends that the
addicted smoker believes that
he will not be the one.
I believe Dr. Burton. That's
why I'm still drinking water.

In fact, the water has become
a habit. I dry up without it.
After classes, I always lit up
a smoke; now I go to the
bathroom.
I don't think I've flushed
the nicotine out. My finger
tips still glow at night.
Dr. Burton doesn't like me.
Lots of doctors and psychol
ogists don't like me. Even my
friends don't like me.
All my friends smoke and
I make them nervous. When
I go to the Union and sit with
my friends, they hide their
cigarettes behind their backs.
I really don't notice th e
smokes until they hide them.
Everyone sits around me
with their hands behind their
backs and asks me not to pop
my gum.
Tonight, Dr. Burton is giv
ing a talk on "A Sure Fire
Way to Lose Weight." He in
vites anyone who's fat to
come. I weigh 98 pounds. I
look like the white mouse
mouse that got the white
bread. I may not go.
When I smoked I ate a lot,
but now I've lost my Appetite
— that's my girl's name.
That's anot h e r reason I
started smoking — my girl's
name.
The gum and lemon droits
don't satisfy me any more,
.lust like when I smoked, I
had to change from Kents to
Camels. Now I eat candy bars.
I eat a box and a half of
candy bars a day. My com
plexion looks like an SOS pad.
I have a confession to make.

I don't think I've flushed
the nicotine out. My finger
tips still glow at night.
Dr. Burton doesn't like me.
Lots of doctors and psychol
ogists don't like me. Even my
friends don't like me.
All my friends smoke and
I make them nervous. When
I go to the Union and sit with
my friends, they hide their
cigarettes behind their backs.
I really don't notice th e
smokes until they hide them.
Everyone sits around me
with their hands behind their
backs and asks me not to pop
my gum.
Tonight, Dr. Burton is giv
ing a talk on "A Sure Fire
Way to Lose Weight." He in
vites anyone who's fat to
come. I weigh 98 pounds. I
look like the white mouse
mouse that got the white
bread. I may not go.
When I smoked I ate a lot,
but now I've lost my Appetite
— that's my girl's name.
That's anot h e r reason I
started smoking — my girl's
name.
The gum and lemon droits
don't satisfy me any more,
.lust like when I smoked, I
had to change from Kents to
Camels. Now I eat candy bars.
I eat a box and a half of
candy bars a day. My com
plexion looks like an SOS pad.
I have a confession to make.
After 72 hours, 1 coveted a
cigarette. I finally bummed
one in the Union from some
one who didn't know me. I
lit the filter and got sick.
Afterwards, I attended the
fourth session of the Five
Days Stop Smoking Clinic.
They passed through the au
dience a cancerous human
lung and a dog's lung. I got
sick again.
As in the past sessions, we
saw a movie, a satire on
cigarette advertising. Th e
film was about the Old Vir
gina Tobacco Company a n d
their campaign to have every
man, woman, and c hi I <1
("especially the soldiers in
the hospitals") smoke llum
hars, I lie "menthol-carbon
ated" cigarettes.
During the movie, another
white mouse died. .Non-smok
ing white mice live longer.
After the movie, Dr. Burton
of the medical center lectured
on the five words, "II can't
happen to me." He quoted the
American Cancer Society fig
ures <ni lung cancer among
smokers a n d non-smokers.
Apparently, the chances for a
smoker to get lung cancer are
one in ten while for a non
smoker, they are one in 270.
The doctor contends that the
addicted smoker believes that
he will not be the one.
I believe Dr. Burton. That's
why I'm still drinking water.

In fact, the water has become
a habit. I dry up without it.
After classes, I always lit up
a smoke; now I go to the
bathroom.
