# World Mourns Sir Winston's Death
## 
### BRUCE BURTON 
For nine days the world watched as
the man who led Britain through "h e r
finest hour" slowly and peacefully ap
proached death in London.
Early yesterday, Sir Winston Churchill
died, and since then thousands of persons
—from government heads to the man in
the street —have praised, criticized, or ex
pressed a feeling of loss at the death of
the former prime minister.
IN WASHINGTON, D.C., President
Lyndon B. Johnson sent messages of
sympathy to Lady Churchill, Queen Eliz
abeth II and British Prime Minister Har
old Wilson. He also ordered American
flags on government buildings and ships
to be flown at half-mast through Satur
day, the day of Churchill's funeral.
The President, bedridden at the Be
thesda, Md., Naval Hospital with a slight
fever, said he would like "very, very
much" to attend the statesman's funeral,
but was not sure if he could go.
"A lot depends on how I feel in the
next day or two," he said.
Churchill's countrymen were wearing
black mourning ties and quick to eulo
gize the statesman:
"HIS DEATH is the end of a great
chapter in British history," said a Lon
don fashion model.

"He was the man we all admired, ir
respective of politics. I cannot think
there will ever be a greater Briton," one
London antique dealer added.
On Churchill's death, another Lon
doner summed up the feeling of his coun
try and much of the world: "When I
heard he was dead, I got a cold feeling,
all sad, in my stomach."
BIT IT WAS Queen Elizabeth, the last
of six monarchs whom Churchill served,
who officially represented the nation in
mourning his death:
"The whole world is the poorer by the
loss of his many-sided genius while the
survival of this country and the sister
nations of the Commonwealth, in the
face of the greatest danger that has ever
threatened them, will be a perpetual me
morial to his leadership, his vision, and
his indominitable courage."
Although the Russian news agency
Tass, originally denounced Churchill as
"the mastermind behind the cold war,"
Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin
praised Churchill's war effort and said
"the grief of the British people in con
nection with this bereavement is shared
here."
CRITICISM OF Churchill was made,
however. Former Spanish Foreign Min
ister Alberto Martin Artaio stated, "Win

ston Churchill had a tremendous human
personality, but 1 estimate he commited
a very grave mistake with his policy of
an entente cordiale with the Soviet
Union."
British colu m n is t James Marlow
charged Churchill with an opportunism
and "desire to run" everything that led
the statesman-politician to political dis
aster several times before World War 11.
Marlow said it was hard to explain why
Churchill "was a failure by 6f> and in the
next five years became one of the shin
ing figures in history."
French President Charles do Gaulle
stated that "France feels profoundly the
grief which has stricken Britain." In
Rome, Pope Paul VI sent a message to
Lady Churchill offering "our profound
sympathy."
AT STANFORD, Associate Dean Rich
ard W. Lyman of the School of Humani
ties and Sciences spoke on Churchill's
career as a politician, statesman and his
torical figure.
"This is not an occasion for 1 mourning
but rather an occasion for remembering
what we owe him," Lyman said.
"The Western world owes him an im
mense debt of gratitude for what ho did
in 1940, '41, and '42—for standing up to
Nazi Germany and making clear in broad
dramatic terms what the struggle was all

about at a time when many people wen;
still in doubt.
"IF HE I1AI) DIED in 1932, before Hit
ler came to power, his career would be
like" his father's, Lord Randolph Church
ill, "and people would probably be de
scribing him as a brilliant failure."
Lyman said that Churchill alienated
himself from his Conservative party by
fighting what he considered "a too sym
pathetic" stand on Indian independence.
"But," Lyman continued, "during the
war, the qualities which before kept get
ting him in trouble stood him in good
stead.
"HIS FLAMBOYANCE, his tendency
toward rhetorical exaggeration wore
needed to bring out the desperation of
the situation and the fierceness of the
British determination to resist.
"Churchill was always a fighter,
whether in partisan political battles or
in international struggles. He was a pug
nacious man. When the British had al
most nothing else to feel good about, his
ability to dramatize, to personify the na
tional will to win was exceedingly im
portant."
Lyman concluded by saying, "Church
ill was a living legend in England today
—part of the national scene, like Wind
sor Castle or the monarchy. The legend
is unlikely to die with the man."
