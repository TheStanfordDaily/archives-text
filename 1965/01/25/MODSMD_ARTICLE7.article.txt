## Raw Materials Of History 
### MICHAEL COUZENS (Second in a Series) 
South African law provides a three
month prison sentence for anyone caught
with "subversive" documents. But a Hoover
Institution scavenger in South Africa daily
seeks out the literature of opposition, par
ticularly communist.
"We are trying," says Africa Curator
Peter Duignan, "to catch fleeting, ephem
eral material." The new nations of Africa
often cannot afford the luxury of archive
buildings. Unless some effort is made to
collect perishable records, they may disap
pear forever.
BY WHITING TO public figures and
politicians, the Hoover Institution has al
ready acquired significant chronicles of
African history. Requests arc made for any
information individuals care to send, even
if it is only press releases.
Private papers of Dr. Xuma, President
of the African National Congress, supply
valuable insight into South Africa. Herbert
Weiss, who worked with Lumumba and
Ga/cnga, gave his own collection, 12 reels of
material on decolonization. They may be
unique.
Exchanges are now being made for ma
terial in Angola and Mozambique. Dr. Duig
nan explains, "We send them money, books,
and so forth: anything within reason. We
don't send them guns."
C OLLECTION is NOT limited to cut
rent material. Though no Africa euratoi
was appointed until 19.%, materials date
from IS7<).
The German Provisional and Belgian
governments gave Herbert Hoover official
documents on iheir colonies at the I'aii

Peace Conference.
The League of Nations gives an account
of the African mandates. And microfilmed
Confidential I'rints of Ihe British Foreign
Office and Colonial Office reveal Ihe admin
istrative superstructure of British colonies
from IS7O to 1912.
CONFLICTING BRITISH promises dur
ing World War 1 have been exposed by ma
terials in the Middle East collection. The
Balfour Declaration of 1917 assured the
Jews ot a national home in Palestine.
But an official British document in the
collection reveals similar guarantees made
to the Arabs.
The document became public recently
with the death of William Linn Westcr
matin, in whose personal papers it was dis
covered. Wood row Wilson took Wester
mann, then a professor at Columbia, to the
Paris Peace Conference. He gathered con
siderable material at the Conference which
was eventually given to the Hoover Institu
tion.
MIDDLE EAST is the smallest of the
five area collections. Materials are divided
into Arabic, Turkish and Persian, according
to Curator George Kent/.
American foreign aid has greatly facili
tated the acquisition of books and serials.
The United States 'sells" wheal aiid other
goods abroad and receives payment ill the
local currency.
This currency is usually inconvertible
and often worth very little when it can he
exchanged. So the U.S. Government
amasses large balances to spend for prod
ucts in various count l ies.
I*l lIMC l,A\\ ISO permits Ihe use of
this money foi published materials. Eigh

teen libraries now benefit from the Govern
ment's largesse. About 1,700 of these vol
umes were acquired by the Middle East col
lection last year.
To General Joseph Stilwell, Chiang Kai
Shek was "the peanut." His seething day-to
day comments on t he war are a special col
lection in the Hoover Institution.
"Vinegar Joe," as ho was nicknamed,
commanded the China-Burma theatre in
World War II. His anger flares in 16 small
notebooks and three larger copybooks.
Items:
Feb. 9, 1912 "Tell Chiang that it's bunk
that Hitler is one enemy. All are equal
enemies. . . . Only way is fight. Harry Hop
kins is a queer gnome."
Feb. 2f> "This British general is a mono
cled ass. At lunch, ho said, 'One does enjoy
a cawktail ... it's so seldom one gets a
chawnce.' "
June 15- "C.K.S.'s ignorance and fatu
ous complacency are appalling, the little
dummy."
Louis Raomaekers, Dutch cartoonist,
gave many cf his original drawings to the
Hoover Institution.
Till'; EMOTION'AL caricatures so in
furiated Kaiser Wilhelm that he put a price
on Maemaekers' head. They quadrupled the
circulation of !>«• T'Megraat' of Amsterdam,
in which they appeared.
The Kaiser's ire was understandable.
One cartoon pictured Christ in a lifeboat
labeled "humanity." Nearby, two officers
colifei' on a U-Boat deck: "Seems t<» be a
neutral. Sink him."
Europe, with her dress torn and spat
tered with blood, is shown in another ear-
toon. She is chained to the wheel
of a "war machine." The caption:
"Am I not yet sufficiently civil
ized?"
ONLY ONE cartoon in the col
lection shows German compas
sion. A German soldier reaches
down to touch the face of a fallen
Belgian youth. In delirium, the
boy says, "Is it you, mother?"
Raemaekers was always anti-
German. In 1940, Time Magazine
quoted him as saying, "It has been
my one aim since the breaking
out of the war to accentuate the
brutish character of the Germans.
The brute is in them and I have
tried to bring it out, but try as
hard as I can, I cannot depict it
strong enough."
Over 300 special collections like
the Stilwell diaries and Raemaek
ers cartoons are housed in the
Hoover Institution. The private
papers of David Starr Jordan and
archives of the pre-World War I
America First Committee are
other examples.
SIXTEEN MILLION documents
from the U.S. Food Administra
tion are in the archives. The Com
mission for Relief in Belgium and
Amei'ican Relief Administration
records are also popular a mong
scholars.
Correspondence with Woodrow
Wilson, and Hoover's Papers as
Secretary of Commerce (1921-
1928) and as head of the Hoover
Commissions are other holdings.
No one knows how much ma
terial is in the Hoover Institution.
Primary holdings are not books,
but archives, papers, broadsheets,
leaflets, newspapers, posters and
serials.
, Book holdings in the Institution
can be measured — one estimate
is over 700,000 volumes — but the
"ephemera" is too varied to
assess, unless someone has the
enterprise to count pages.
Even that would give only a par
tial answer.

ONLY ONE cartoon in the col
lection shows German compas
sion. A German soldier reaches
down to touch the face of a fallen
Belgian youth. In delirium, the
boy says, "Is it you, mother?"
Raemaekers was always anti-
German. In 1940, Time Magazine
quoted him as saying, "It has been
my one aim since the breaking
out of the war to accentuate the
brutish character of the Germans.
The brute is in them and I have
tried to bring it out, but try as
hard as I can, I cannot depict it
strong enough."
Over 300 special collections like
the Stilwell diaries and Raemaek
ers cartoons are housed in the
Hoover Institution. The private
papers of David Starr Jordan and
archives of the pre-World War I
America First Committee are
other examples.
SIXTEEN MILLION documents
from the U.S. Food Administra
tion are in the archives. The Com
mission for Relief in Belgium and
Amei'ican Relief Administration
records are also popular a mong
scholars.
Correspondence with Woodrow
Wilson, and Hoover's Papers as
Secretary of Commerce (1921-
1928) and as head of the Hoover
Commissions are other holdings.
No one knows how much ma
terial is in the Hoover Institution.
Primary holdings are not books,
but archives, papers, broadsheets,
leaflets, newspapers, posters and
serials.
, Book holdings in the Institution
can be measured — one estimate
is over 700,000 volumes — but the
"ephemera" is too varied to
assess, unless someone has the
enterprise to count pages.
Even that would give only a par
tial answer.
