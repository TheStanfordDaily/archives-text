# Judicial Reforms Possible
## Trustees Hear Favorable Report 
### JUSTIN BECK 
Prospects for a reform of the
student judicial system were en
hanced last week with a report
of the Board of Trustees Com
mittee on Academic Affairs fa
voring the concept of an appeals
system.
According to Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert J.
Wert, "The committee looks fa
vorably upon tho principle of ap
pellate review."
WKKT SAID that the commit
tee had informally considered the
proposal Thursday.
However, no decision will be
made until Wert's committee on
judicial reform completes its re
port on the judicial process, which
Wert indicated would not bo until
tho end of the quarter, at the
earliest.
Mis eight-member committee is
considering all aspects of the judi
cial system, including, in addition
to an appeals system, the proce
dures of the student judicial coun
cils, procedures at overseas cam
puses, and inconsistencies in th e
system.
IT WAS FORMED this fall, in
response to a great amount of stu
dent interest in judicial reform,
stemming from a case last spring
when a student received a suspen
sion for what many students be
lieved was a minor infraction at
Stanford-in-Italy.
Both Scott Mcßridc, the ASS If
President, and John Bryson, his
opponent in last spring's ASSU
final election, advocated some
form of judicial "Appellate
Board." Dick Berg, Chairman of
Men's Council, also proposed such
a change last fall, on a trial basis.
Several other changes have al
ready been instituted by the legis
lature and by Men's Council, deal
ing mainly with procedural
changes. LASSU currently has a
Committee on Judicial Reform,
studying most of the issues before
Wert's commit tee.
