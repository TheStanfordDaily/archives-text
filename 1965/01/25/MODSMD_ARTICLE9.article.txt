# Prof Found In Hospital
## 
### 
William H. Vatcher Jr. is in
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital with
less than a 25 per cent chance to
live.
Vatcher, professor of political
science at San Jose State and re
search associate at the Hoover
Institution, had been missing
from his Palo Alto home for two
weeks.
The bachelor had been in
San Francisco General Hospital
since Jan. 9, the Palo Alto Times
reports. Vatcher was in a coma
after a savage street beating,
police said, and his identity was
not established until late Friday.
HIS FAMILY had him trans
ferred to Palo Alto-Stanford Hos
pital at 11:00 a.m. Saturday after
Vatcher's brother, Alfred Vatcher
of Fresno, had confirmed the
identification
Palo Alto doctors said Saturday
afternoon that they had not had
time to examine Vatcher com
pletely, but he is in a coma and
his condition remains "serious"
and "unchanged." They would not
guess his chances of survival, but
San Francisco doctors had given
a 3-to-l estimate.
VATCHER was found loaning
against a doorway on Sansome
Street in San Francisco at 10:02
p.m. on Jan. 9. He was bleeding
profusely from the left ear.
A 14-inch piece of reinforced
steel, the apparent weapon, was
found at the probable scene of the
assault on Battery Street.

William H. Vatcher Jr. is in
Palo Alto-Stanford Hospital with
less than a 25 per cent chance to
live.
Vatcher, professor of political
science at San Jose State and re
search associate at the Hoover
Institution, had been missing
from his Palo Alto home for two
weeks.
The bachelor had been in
San Francisco General Hospital
since Jan. 9, the Palo Alto Times
reports. Vatcher was in a coma
after a savage street beating,
police said, and his identity was
not established until late Friday.
HIS FAMILY had him trans
ferred to Palo Alto-Stanford Hos
pital at 11:00 a.m. Saturday after
Vatcher's brother, Alfred Vatcher
of Fresno, had confirmed the
identification
Palo Alto doctors said Saturday
afternoon that they had not had
time to examine Vatcher com
pletely, but he is in a coma and
his condition remains "serious"
and "unchanged." They would not
guess his chances of survival, but
San Francisco doctors had given
a 3-to-l estimate.
VATCHER was found loaning
against a doorway on Sansome
Street in San Francisco at 10:02
p.m. on Jan. 9. He was bleeding
profusely from the left ear.
A 14-inch piece of reinforced
steel, the apparent weapon, was
found at the probable scene of the
assault on Battery Street.
