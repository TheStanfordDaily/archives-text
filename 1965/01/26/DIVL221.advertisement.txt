"I am Who I am"
The Old Testament God of the Jews revealed Himself to Moses as the self-existent
One, the tinderived and all-powerful Being who alone can truly say, "I am who
I am." It was at a burning bush that Moses encountered the unchangeable God.
"Moses said to God, "If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, "the
God of your fathers has sent me to you." and tiny ask me "what is His name ,
what shall 1 say to them?' (Soil said to Moses, 'I AM \\ ll(> l« AM> •J 1 . 11 ', ■ S,UI '-
'S;iv to the people of Israel.' "I AM has sent you . . . tile Lord Cod of your
fathers, the Cod of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the Cod of Jacob, Has sent
you: iliis is my name for ever and thus I am to be remembered throughout all gene
rations' " (Exodus 3:13-16).
Our English word "Jehovah" is the well-established rendering of the Hebrew
"YHWIf" which is derived from the verb "to be." This name of God was so sacred
to the Jews that it was not to be uttered aloud. The word 'Adonai" (Lord, Master)
was substituted when speaking of "Y lIWII or "Jehovah.
The name "Jehovah" appears at least 7000 tinier in the Old Testament. This
name of God is always used when God is spoken of as the 'Provider, Redeemer,
"Shepherd," "Healer," "Righteousness," and the "Peace of His people Israel—
the great "I AM," sufficient for every human need.
It was an an pel who told Mary and Joseph that their child was to be called
"Jesus" (Luke 1:31, Matthew 1:18-25). The name "Jesus" is the Greek rendering
of the Hebrew word "Joshua" or "Je-hoshua" which means "Jehovah Savior."
What disturbed the religious leaders <lf llis day was not the name 'Jesus." but
that claims which Jesus Christ made to be God. The Jewish priests were shocked
and outraged when Jesus said that He was the very same unutterable '1 AM
who met with Moses and th< burning bush and who had called Abraham to lead His
people:
"Your father Abraham rejoiced." said Jesus, "that he was to sec my day; ho
saw it and was glad" . . • The Jews said to Him, "you arc not yet lifty years old,
and have seen Abraham?" Jesus said to them, "truly, truly, I say to you. before
Abraham was. I AM." So they took up stones to throw at Him (John 8:56-59).
fesiis Christ mad' other startling claims for Himself which linked Him directly
with the Jehovah God of the Old Testament. He said. "! am the bread of life. This
is tin bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may cat of it and not <li< "

and the life; no man comes to the Father but by me" (John 14:6); "/aw the vine,
yon are the branches . . . apart from me you can do nothing" (John 15:5),
What Jestis Christ claimed and asserted, that He was in fart God, is either
literally and accurately true or He committed blasphemy. Why not discover the
truth for yourself. Find out by .inking God dircctly Who He is. Permit Him to show
Himself to you as Jehovah, the great I AM, the I ord Ji sus Christ, "the same
yesterday, today, and forever" (Hebrews 13:8).
