# Hoover Melting Pot Holds Variety Of Nationalities
## 
### MICHAEL COUZENS (Third in a Series) 
Hoover Tower might be called a melting
pot in miniature. The staff is a curious admix
ture of nationalities. They speak the linguistic
fauna of every continent.
In the basement, the East Asian Heading
Room accommodates Chinese, Japanese and
Koreans. On the tenth floor are an affable
Eastern European and a former economic ad
viser to the President of Bolivia.
MEANWHILE, on the second floor, a cura
tor is busily learning Swahili.
Curators are not simply librarians, though
library skills are essential. They must be lin
guists, have broad knowledge of a large super
national area, and plan ahead to future acqui
sitions.
VVITOLI) SWORAKOWSKI, Assistant Direc
tor of the Hoover Institution, typifies the di
versity over which he presides. Fluent in six
languages (and able to read several others)
he admits with a wry smile that English is
his weakest.
Dr. Sworakowski was Polish consul in Chi
cago until the Yalta Conference rearranged
Eastern Europe. He came to Stanford as a re
search fellow in Slavic languages, then became
successively curator of the Western and East
ern European collections.
Each curator is particularly suited to his
position by virtue of area knowledge and li
brary training.

GEORGE RENTZ, Middle East Curator,
studied Arabic at the University of California
when it was perhaps the least popular major
in the country.
"I was fortunate," he says, "to have had a
very line professor of Arabic at that time. For

five and a half years, I was his only student."
LISTING PAMPHLETS was the dreary
first job Mrs. Agnes Peterson held at the
Hoover Institution. Two years later, she was
made the curator for Western Europe.
"I was always interested in libraries," she
explains. "I had been working for the Califor
nia Historical Society. The work was fascinat
ing, but I was not able to use my languages."
She speaks German and French; can read
Italian, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian.
Karol Maichel, Eastern European curator,
thrives on booklists. They are his leisure read
ing as well as being a part of his job.
WHAT INDUCES a person to become a
professional bibliographer? Mr. Maichel sug
gests, "I think you must be born with it. That
is the only way I could explain it."
Dr. Stefan T. Possony is the Institution's
expert on strategy. His long official title is In
ternational Political Studies Program Director.
A CONTROVERSIAL figure with definite
views, Dr. Possony objects to the classification
of Institution staff members as generally con
servative.
"People in this country ought to be taken
as individuals," he argues. Dr. Possony sup
ported Sen. Barry Goldwater in the 4 last Presi
dential election.
"I think the American governmental struc
ture is a little top-heavy. And I do not buy the
optimistic interpretation of the way the inter
national situation is developing."

But Dr. Possony emphasizes that he dif
ferentiates "very clearly between factual data
and the personal conclusions which are drawn
from them."
CONTROVERSY, he states, is inevitable be
cause "The scholar who deals with what in a

broad sense are the social sciences must in
volve himself with fact and judgment."
There appears to lx» no bias in favor of a
single political "line" among the staff. They
tenaciously hold to the privilege of arguing
with one another.
A recent book on African Socialism pub
lished by the Institution contains an essay by
an African socialist and another by a commu
nist.
IN KEEPING WITH Herbert Hoover's
wish, the contents of the Institution library
are open to anyone intent on serious research.
Says Director W. Glenn Campbell, "I think
we have healthy diversity."
Dr. Campbell himself arrived amid mild
controversy. But his vigorous leadership would
seem to vindicate the university's judgment
in appointing him.
BEGINNING A SIXTH YEAIt as Director,
the soft-spoken Harvard economist has made
major contributions.
When Campbell arrived the Hoover Institu
tion was in debt by over $80,000. He managed
to cover the deficit and more. He has built the
finances to the extent that next year's budget
will be near $1 million.
Under his leadership the publishing pro
gram of the Institution has nearly equaled in
five years the entire volume of publishing up
to his arrival.

Hoover Tower might be called a melting

Eastern European and a former economic ad

MEANWHILE, on the second floor, a cura

Curators are not simply librarians, though
library skills are essential. They must be lin

Dr. Sworakowski was Polish consul in Chi

dential election.
"I think the American governmental struc
ture is a little top-heavy. And I do not buy the
optimistic interpretation of the way the inter
national situation is developing."

But Dr. Possony emphasizes that he dif
ferentiates "very clearly between factual data
and the personal conclusions which are drawn
from them."

IN KEEPING WITH Herbert Hoover's

Says Director W. Glenn Campbell, "I think
we have healthy diversity."
Dr. Campbell himself arrived amid mild
controversy. But his vigorous leadership would
seem to vindicate the university's judgment
in appointing him.
BEGINNING A SIXTH YEAIt as Director,
the soft-spoken Harvard economist has made
major contributions.
When Campbell arrived the Hoover Institu
tion was in debt by over $80,000. He managed
to cover the deficit and more. He has built the
finances to the extent that next year's budget
will be near $1 million.
Under his leadership the publishing pro
gram of the Institution has nearly equaled in
five years the entire volume of publishing up
to his arrival.
