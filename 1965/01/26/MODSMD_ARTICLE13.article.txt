| Final tabulations on intramural
I point totals for fall quarter have
finally boon released. The cumula
i t ive scores have not been released
! earlier because there was a snafu
in the sometimes intricate scoring
i system.
First and foremost among au
tumn quarter sports was football.
Fifty-eight teams competed in one
of iho four fall sports and almost
all of them took part in touch
fool ball. Tho other sports were
cross-country, two-man volleyball,
and basketball free-throws.
Sigma Chi. who leads the pa
rade, garnered the amazing total
of 97 points in football. They ac
complished this by winning both

their "A" and "B" league and by
winning the football tournament.
A MORE even gathering of
points by Theta Delt si ill left
Ihem two shy of the Sigma Chi's.
With 63 points in football, 16 in
cross-country, ft in volleyball, and
22 in basketball free-throws, t he
Theta Dells have a total of 111
points.
Fremont won second place in
football and also was the number
one in basketball free-throws.
They received 29 points for their
efforts at the charity line.
Phi Kappa Sigma is in fourth
place. They have 51.5 points from
football. 20 from volleyball, and 12
from free-throwing.
In fifth position is Alpha Biz.
As with most teams in the upper
brackets of autumn quarter point
totals, Alpha Biz got a more than
major portion of their points in
football. They had 52 points in
football and 28 in the other sports
combined.
The sixth place team is a rare
group. The DU's did poorly in
football and yet are in tht top ten.
There is only one other team in
the top fourteen which did not
score at least thirty points in foot
ball. DU gave its self a big boost
by winning two-man volleyball. 11
was worth 31 points. They also
got 14 points for free-throws.
The only freshmen group in the
first fourteen is Soto. El Capitan
is tied for seventh spot with t lie
frosh.

the Phi Sigs and ihe Theta Chi's.
