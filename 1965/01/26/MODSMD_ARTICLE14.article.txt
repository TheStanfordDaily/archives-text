# Papooses Sweep Two
## 
### Bob Thieriot 
Frosh basketball enjoyed a
weekend of travel and victories as
they swept a game each from
California State Frosh 64-43 and
Monterey J.C. 85-62. As usual, it
was Art Harris who led the team
to its conquests, yet ho received
some able help for a change.
Friday the freshmen traveled
to Hayward where they easily
disposed of tho Cal State team.
Stanford was a bit shaky at tho
start. The Papooses could not
manage to break away until the
second half.
After leading 25-20 at half, the
Five little Indians dominated
the game completely and out
scored tho opponents 39-23. The
scoring for Stanford was very
balanced. Harris lod the team
with 11, followed by Gary Peters
meyer at 9. Bob Treshnak from
Cai. State lod the scorers with 15.
SATURDAY NIGHT saw the
Frosh at their very best. They
started off with a quick lead
almost instantaneously and by
half time led by 43-24. Harris and
Herb Hargate both racked up 14.
In tho second half many of tho
Stanford subs saw action, yet
Monterey was held in check.
Gary Petersmeyer scored all of
his points in this half. Ait Harris
wound up with scoring honors
with 26. He also pulled down 14
rebounds.
The Papooses lost Ihe ball 17
times during the game. They
were able to offset this with a
stubborn defense and some great
outside shooting.
The Frosh team now seems to
have molded into a solid unit.
Their greatest asset is an explo
sive offense which can destroy an
opponent within a few minutes.
The Frosh go against Santa
Clara Thursday night before the
varsity game against Santa
Barbara.
