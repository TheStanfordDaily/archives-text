## Great Freshman Cattle Drive? 
### 
Dear Sir:
We'd just finished sharpening
our spears for the annual Fresh
man cattle slaughter when the
usual wildebeest appeared, led
by the head wildebeest, Justin
Beck. Yes, dear hearts, it's time
again to "suffer the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune."
Justin doesn't like rush. II "shat

ters the Wilbur House System."
Fortunately for the world, Mr.
Beck's latest communication from
God included a solution to this
weighty problem. I quote, "The
only way to maintain the Wilbur
House system is to end rush alto
gether, and if necessary end the
fraternity system. ..."
Justin Beck is an observant

man. He notes that "the Wilbur
House system begins to totter in
Winter Quarter, and with the ad
vent of spring rush totally eol
lapses."This isn't terribly surpris
ing since every freshman is re
quired by University decree to
move out at the end of Spring
quarter. Is it then the administra
tion and not the insidious fra
ternities which put an end to the
Utopian Wilbur system? Oh, Jus
tin, no!
If the University thought as
much of the Wilbur system as do
Mr. Beck and the sponsors, they
would allow freshmen to remain
in Wilbur, or expand the Stern
Hall facilities. Instead they "con
done" two other fairly popular
; systems. Let's not hear any more
i rubbish about fraternities shatter
; ing Wilbur. They simply provide
lone solution to a burdensome
I housing problem.
And Justin, the Farm problem
j is not only one of "cattle" market
! ing, there is also a considerable
I poultry surplus. After all, they
! can't all be associate editors, now
can they?
At least one fraternity comes to
mind which only took six pledges
I last spring. (Thoj' probably
; weren't as brutal as other houses
jin rush tactics.) So freshmen,
1 there's room for you. Come on the
cattle drive. You won't be bought,
bludgeoned, or bribed; and, if you
don't like it, there are certainly
other solutions to your housing
J problems.
Now, about that poor academic
atmosphere. I guess nobody told
| Tom Cotton about it. He won a
j Rhodes scholarship while running
: lIR and acting as president of his
j fraternity. Tn addition, fraternity
I men provide the life blood of
ASSU, Union Board, Program Di
| vision, Cultural Arts Division,
j lIR, Stanford Today and Tomor
rom, Judicial Council, Stu-Fac, and
others.
Short of abolishing everything
1 but Wilbur, there is going to be a
, problem when freshmen men
move out, so lets face it and make
i the best of it. Just one year we'd
all like to conduct rush with out
j the help of a lot of unemployed
wildebeest. So Justin, go beat
;yo u r tambourine somewhere
i else, huh?
Disrespectfully,
PETER M. BROWN
