## Modest Proposal: Replace Rush With A Draft System 
### Roger Magnuson 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Although Mr. Magnuson is a sports writer
and sports editor elect, we felt the following 1 column would l»e
better placed on the editorial page, inasmuch as the topic is of
interest to more than Stanford's devoted sports fans.

Next to depilatories, the professional football * college draft
lias to rank as one of the more promising inventions of the past
few years.
The draft is clearly an excellent method of ladling out talent
and ability. The pro's get the type of players they want, usually,

and the players generally get to
play with the team which wants
them most.
With the genial brouhaha of
Greek Week nearly upon us one
might take the opportunity to
question whether the present
means of Wilbur talent distribu
tion into the fratefnity system is
as efficient and worthy.
Toward The Abyss
The gallons of punch and moun
tain of revolting hors d'oeuvres,
outbreaks of dysentery, monoto
nous hours of flesh-pressing, aim
less Odysseusion progress from
House to House and general awk
wardness do not bespeak a uni
versity leetering on any edge,
satfe one leading to a deep un
i fathomable abyss.
No, the present maze of silly
regulations and dog-cat-dog com
petition among fraternities will
not do.
What we obviously need is a
fraternity free-agent draft.
Oh, how the fraternity system
could flourish without regulation,
in a true laissez-faire atmosphere
of enlightenment, with free trad
ing of draft choices, with the
| drafting of "futures," to say
nothing of red-shirting good pros
pects from prep schools.
First of all, it would do much
for the poor ingenuous freshman
who now is confronted by an ir
rational cosmos of extended
hands, blurred smiles, and spilled
punch; his valued freedom of
choice, to confront with a prolep
sis the first argument that might
be raised against such a sane idea,
is now limited to one between
despair and a licensed California
home for the bewildered. His time
is consumed, his tensions in
creased.
The Right Material
All that would be expected of
him under "The Draft" would be
to behave normally, meet upper
classmen of all affiliations, and
wait for the big conclave in, say,
March in which the representa
tives of all fraternities or the
legates of all the eating clubs
could meet solemnly in convention
assembled and draft the type of
material they want — whether
jock, jock-social, or academic.
The lad's future would then be
determined; he'd know, without
any tensions or possibility of fu
i turc neuroses, exactly where he
j stood and what his real realm of
| choice was.
The upperelassmen would be
benefitted as well; they, after
all, have to provide all that silly
punch, and finesse those impor
! tant classes.
The various fraternities could
be content with competing only
j with different living groups and
! not with themselves, much as the
| AFL/NFL now compete. While
| also keeping to themselves a
i fairly even distribution of talent.
The Greatest Good
But most of all the student
body, the collective happiness of
; the greatest number, would be
I substantively helped. After the
body politic got used to the idea
the draft, certainly a public af
i fair, would probably move into
Memorial Hall, and The Daily
could keep the university eommu
; nity posted on how the sign-ups
! were progressing, profiles on prep
school "futures," draft swaps, and
what was left for Slcrn, unless
it, too, was caught in the spirit of
i the thing and developed its own.
Say if the Betas, whose a 11-
I Greek social chairman is retiring
at the end of the year, need a
replacement, while the legions of
j the Sigma Chi have one basketball
player too many, while the Pokes

4
I are crying for a little balance on
j their intramural team but are
| well-stocked in social chairmen,
j obviously a three-way deal could
i be hatched: The Betas getting a
social chairman, and giving a
utility barfly; the Dekes getting a
eager, and sacrificing a social
chairman; and the Chis getting a
j barfly and two cases and perhaps
j some blue chip stamps in return
for a basetball player.
Vive laissez-faire.
The ramifications of such a plan
boggle the mind.
Getting To Know Tliem
It might be argued by en
trench e d estabiishmentarian
forces that the fraternities would
not, in the few months before the
actual drafting was held, be able
tn fully acquaint themselves with
the freshman prospects; these
bureaucrats would show little
imagination.
First of all, the frats could send
out scouts, in the guise of Wilbur
sponsors, who would furtively
peruse the more adroit of Wilbur
men—at work and at play.
These could easily prepare all
encompassing scouting reports
like; "drinks well with either
hand, likos to break things when
drunk, but allegedly sports a
green book bag, solid gradepoint
| history major, solid smile."
Candid Cameras
But this wouldn't have to be the
j extent of scouting. The use of
"game movies," so to speak, could
acquaint the brothers with th e
moves of the lad in question while
partying, prowling, and, with a
discreetly hidden camera, pec
cadilloing with a young lady dur
ing open house.
Even the hooking of the student
would not need be outside th e
j camera's perview.
Then, after all the reams of in
formation had been collected and
jthe drafts of the respective
"leagues" held, the competition
between the Frats and the Eating
Clubs, (with the latter, admitted
ly. in the position of the AFL in
the competition» could begin.
The draftee could be "flown" in
an XKE to confer contract terms
in one of the new clusters, and be
carted down to the Clubs to be
wined and dined and given an
offer.
Ho might, for instance, be given
a three-year, no-cut contract with
the Fijis with a promise of little
j dirty work, a blue jacket, a car
i on the weekends, and some of the
j footage shot of him during open
house.
The Club's Offer
| Whereas, the eating club might
; offer him, in countering the Fijis,
; the same three-year no-cut clause,
: but with the addition of immunity
i during food fights, a room with a
view of Branner in Toy on, and the
j names, addresses and pictures of
j 10 to 15 Paly High girls.
With two offers like this, the
ingenuous draftee would quickly
become aware of his exact status,
; without excess worries or con
cern.
The Daily would keep the stu
dent body aware of the copious
j offers and counter-offers and the
; status of the sign-ups with an en
i closed position by position analy
sis of the fraternities and eating
: club' abilities, gleaned from their
(own scouting reports.
Yes, a fraternity draft allows
j for endless opportunities to re-
I lieve both the confusion of the
| freshman, and the dog-eat-dog
competition a m on g fraternities
I and among eating clubs.
And, we might add, to relieve
' the noatliv of Ihe burls politic.
