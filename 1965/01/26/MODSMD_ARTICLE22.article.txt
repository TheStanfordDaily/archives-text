ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH
Today I begin my eleventh year of writing this column in your
campus newspaper.
I wasn't sure I'd he coming back this year. After a decade of
doing this column, 1 had retreated to my country seat, tired but
happy, to enjoy a nice long rest. But last night as I sat on my
verandah, peaceful and serene, humming the largo from A Long
Day's Night and worming my dog, a stranger suddenly appeared
before inc.
He was a tall, clean-limbed man, crinkly-eyed and crooked
grinned, stalwart and virile. "How do you do," he said. "My
name is Stalwart Virile and 1 am with the Personna Stainless
Steel Razor Blade people."
"Enchanted," I said. "Take off your liomburg and sit down."
1 clapped my hands sharply. "Norman!" 1 called. "Another chair
for Mr. Virile!"

(Ibediently my dog trotted away and returned directly with a
fallback chair of Malayan rattan. He i.s the smartest dog in our
block.
"I suppose you're wondering why I am here," said Mr. Virile,
seating himself.
"Well, sir," I replied, my old eyes twinkling roguishly, "I'll
wager you didn't come to read my meter."
You can imagine how we howled at that one!
"That's a doozy!" cried Mr. Virile, finally cateliing his breath,
f'l must remember to tell it to Alice when I get home."
"Your wife?" I said.
"My father," lie said
"Oh," I said.
"But enough of wit and humor," he paid. "Let us gel down to
business. How would you like to write a campus column for
Personna Stainless Si eel Razor Blades?"
" For money?" I said.
"Yes," he said.
"My hand, sir," I said and clasped his. Warmly he returned
the pressure, and soft smiles played upon our lips, and our eyes
were moist with t he hint of tears, and we were silent, not trust
ing ourselves to speak.
"What will you write about in your campus column?" asked
Mr. Virile when he was able to talk again.
"I will take up the burning issues that vex the American un
dergraduate!" I cried, bounding to my feet. "I will explore, with
out fear or favor, such explosive questions as 'Are roommates
sanitary?' and 'Should proctors be given a saliva test?' and
'Should capital punishment for pledges be abolished?' and '('an
a st udent of 19 find happiness with an economies professor of SO?"'
"And will you also say a pleasant word from time to time about
Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades?"' asked Mr. \ irile.
"Sir," I said simply, "what other kind of word except pleasant
could 1 possibly say about Personna Blades, which give me more
luxury shaves than Beep-1 Jeep or any other blade I might name?''
"Another of my products is Burma Shave," said Mr. Virile.
"Can you liud it in vour heart to mention Burma Shave occa
sionally?"
"But of course!" I declared. "For is not Burma Shave the
whisker-wilt ingest lather in the land?''
"Yes," he admitted.
And then he shook my hand again and smiled bravely and
was gone -a tall silhouette moving erectly into the setting sun.
"Farewell, good tnnsorialM!" I cried after him. "Aloha!"
And turned with a will to my typewriter.

"Yes," he said.
"My hand, sir," I said and clasped his. Warmly he returned
the pressure, and soft smiles played upon our lips, and our eyes
were moist with t he hint of tears, and we were silent, not trust
ing ourselves to speak.
"What will you write about in your campus column?" asked
Mr. Virile when he was able to talk again.
"I will take up the burning issues that vex the American un
dergraduate!" I cried, bounding to my feet. "I will explore, with
out fear or favor, such explosive questions as 'Are roommates
sanitary?' and 'Should proctors be given a saliva test?' and
'Should capital punishment for pledges be abolished?' and '('an
a st udent of 19 find happiness with an economies professor of SO?"'
"And will you also say a pleasant word from time to time about
Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades?"' asked Mr. \ irile.
"Sir," I said simply, "what other kind of word except pleasant
could 1 possibly say about Personna Blades, which give me more
luxury shaves than Beep-1 Jeep or any other blade I might name?''
"Another of my products is Burma Shave," said Mr. Virile.
"Can you liud it in vour heart to mention Burma Shave occa
sionally?"
"But of course!" I declared. "For is not Burma Shave the
whisker-wilt ingest lather in the land?''
"Yes," he admitted.
And then he shook my hand again and smiled bravely and
was gone -a tall silhouette moving erectly into the setting sun.
"Farewell, good tnnsorialM!" I cried after him. "Aloha!"
And turned with a will to my typewriter.

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH
Today I begin my eleventh year of writing this column in your
campus newspaper.
I wasn't sure I'd he coming back this year. After a decade of
doing this column, 1 had retreated to my country seat, tired but
happy, to enjoy a nice long rest. But last night as I sat on my
verandah, peaceful and serene, humming the largo from A Long
Day's Night and worming my dog, a stranger suddenly appeared
before inc.
He was a tall, clean-limbed man, crinkly-eyed and crooked
grinned, stalwart and virile. "How do you do," he said. "My
name is Stalwart Virile and 1 am with the Personna Stainless
Steel Razor Blade people."
"Enchanted," I said. "Take off your liomburg and sit down."
1 clapped my hands sharply. "Norman!" 1 called. "Another chair
for Mr. Virile!"

(Ibediently my dog trotted away and returned directly with a
fallback chair of Malayan rattan. He i.s the smartest dog in our
block.
"I suppose you're wondering why I am here," said Mr. Virile,
seating himself.
"Well, sir," I replied, my old eyes twinkling roguishly, "I'll
wager you didn't come to read my meter."
You can imagine how we howled at that one!
"That's a doozy!" cried Mr. Virile, finally cateliing his breath,
f'l must remember to tell it to Alice when I get home."
"Your wife?" I said.
"My father," lie said
"Oh," I said.
"But enough of wit and humor," he paid. "Let us gel down to
business. How would you like to write a campus column for
Personna Stainless Si eel Razor Blades?"
" For money?" I said.
"Yes," he said.
"My hand, sir," I said and clasped his. Warmly he returned
