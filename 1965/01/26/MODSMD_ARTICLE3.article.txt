# Alabama Lawyer Durr Crusades For Equality
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Associate Editor 
Clifford Durr, by his own admission, is "no fighter—no crusade
man.' Yet somehow, for over three decades—first as a stubborn
New Dealer w ho couldn't countenance the red-baiting w itch hunts
oi the McCarthy era and, later, as a stubborn Alabama law yer w ho
couldn't countenance racial injustice in any era—Clifford Burr

seems to have "just kept gettin'
in fights."
Durr first left Montgomery,
Alabama, where he was "born and
bred," in 1920 to go to Oxford,
England, as a Rhodes scholar. In
early 1933 during the "banking
crisis" he and his wife Virginia
pulled up stakes again for Wash
ington, D.C., where Durr served
as Assistant General Counsel for
the Reconstruction Finance Cor
poration. Later President Roose
velt. appointed him to the Federal
Communicat ion Comm is si on
where he served until 19-18.

WHILE IX Washington Du rr
developed an impressive list of
friends including President a n d
Mrs. Roosevelt and a young con
gressman named Lyndon John
son. He also developed a formid
able list of enemies, not the least
of which were J. Edgar Hoover
of the FBI and Mississippi's Sena
tor James Eastland.
During the McCarthy era of the
1950'5, Durr was one of the intre
pid few who stood his ground and
stated his case against govern
mental inquisition. In 1960 Ik 1
wrote. "1 was . . . imbued quite
early with the idea that the groat
and unique quality of our Ameri
can government was that it was
not absolutely sovereign that
the First Amendment to our Con
stitution says to the government
in no uncertain term:-!, 'Here is an
area into which you shall not
enter, the area of the human mind
and spirit.'
"McC'ARTIIYIS.M," he con
tinued, "unhappily did not dies
with McCarthy. Its relative abate
ment is. I fear, more of a tribute
to its accomplishment in silencing
effective dissent than to a rededi
cation to the principles of om Bill
of Rights. The voice of protest is
still disturbingly weak."
In 19:11, Dun retired from gov
ernment service to practice law in
Montgomery a retirement that
was transformed into a subtle
species of exile when he began to
defend Negroes accused in civil
rights cases. "I just wanted to
keep the channels of communica
tion open to let the Negroes
know there was some white men
they could talk to." he explained.
