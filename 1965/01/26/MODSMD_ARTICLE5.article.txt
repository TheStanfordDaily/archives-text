# Tillich Presents His Philosophy, Background, Hopes For Future
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
"World history is a cemetery of fallen hopes.
Real hope is a driving force -a vision of lasting
communion."
These words of Dr. Paul Tillich exemplify iiis
concern for a philosophy of history which gives
value to the finite through its relation to the Eter
nal. According to Tillich, genuine hope is needed
which can "answer the deep questions of the slave
and the prisoner, the sick and the dying, of any
who feel the lack of depth in their existence."
HIS THEOLOGY gives him a strong interest in
social movements and conditions. When Hitler
came to power in 1933, he was professor of philoso
phy at the University of Frankfurt-am-Main. Due
to a book he had published that year attacking the
Nazis' "bad form of political romanticism," he was
on the first list of professors to be dismissed.
In an interview with The Daily, Tillich described
an insurrection of Nazi students at Frankfurt half
a year before Hitler's putsch. Frankfurt, he said,
was a stronghold of liberalism in the tradition of
Goethe. "There was much blood streaming in the
halls of the university." Tillich defended the leftist
students at the 16-hour faculty senate meeting
which was held.
Resistencc to Hitler from professors who
weren't dismissed or didn't emigrate at the begin
ning was "miserable," Tillich said. "They were

silent when their socialist or Jewish colleagues
were dismissed; had they all resisted and threat
ened to quit, Hitler's hands would have been tied."
TILLICH CAME to Union Theological Seminary
in 1934 at the invitation of Reinhold Niebuhr, who
had read what Tillich considers his most popular
book, "The Religious Situation," written in the
1920\5.
From 1955 to 1962 he taught at the Harvard
Divinity School and now is a member of the divin
ity faculty at Chicago. lie participates in one
weekly seminar with thirty members.
Every other week he leads a two-hour discus
sion group including more than 100 students, which
is not graded but is "very valuable," Tillich said,
lie prefers discussions to lecture courses.
TILLICH sees no decline in the "resurgence of
religion" which began in the years after World
War 11. "The important thing is that young people
in our universities are asking ultimate questions,"
he said.
"How does one know about God?" This, said
Tillich, is the first religious question in the minds
of most college students. Ethical problems, especi
ally the relation of the Church to civil rights and
to war, are also important, as is the conflict of
religion with science.
"The concern of students to find a personal
relationship to God is great," despite the often
skeptical atmosphere of universities, Tillich said.

War 11. "The important thing is that young people
in our universities are asking ultimate questions,"
he said.
"How does one know about God?" This, said
Tillich, is the first religious question in the minds
of most college students. Ethical problems, especi
ally the relation of the Church to civil rights and
to war, are also important, as is the conflict of
religion with science.
"The concern of students to find a personal
relationship to God is great," despite the often
skeptical atmosphere of universities, Tillich said.

"World history is a cemetery of fallen hopes.
Real hope is a driving force -a vision of lasting
communion."
These words of Dr. Paul Tillich exemplify iiis
concern for a philosophy of history which gives
value to the finite through its relation to the Eter
nal. According to Tillich, genuine hope is needed
which can "answer the deep questions of the slave
and the prisoner, the sick and the dying, of any
who feel the lack of depth in their existence."
HIS THEOLOGY gives him a strong interest in
social movements and conditions. When Hitler
came to power in 1933, he was professor of philoso
phy at the University of Frankfurt-am-Main. Due
to a book he had published that year attacking the
Nazis' "bad form of political romanticism," he was
on the first list of professors to be dismissed.
In an interview with The Daily, Tillich described
an insurrection of Nazi students at Frankfurt half
a year before Hitler's putsch. Frankfurt, he said,
was a stronghold of liberalism in the tradition of
Goethe. "There was much blood streaming in the
halls of the university." Tillich defended the leftist
students at the 16-hour faculty senate meeting
which was held.
Resistencc to Hitler from professors who
weren't dismissed or didn't emigrate at the begin
ning was "miserable," Tillich said. "They were

silent when their socialist or Jewish colleagues
were dismissed; had they all resisted and threat
ened to quit, Hitler's hands would have been tied."
TILLICH CAME to Union Theological Seminary
in 1934 at the invitation of Reinhold Niebuhr, who
had read what Tillich considers his most popular
book, "The Religious Situation," written in the
1920\5.
From 1955 to 1962 he taught at the Harvard
Divinity School and now is a member of the divin
ity faculty at Chicago. lie participates in one
weekly seminar with thirty members.
Every other week he leads a two-hour discus
sion group including more than 100 students, which
is not graded but is "very valuable," Tillich said,
lie prefers discussions to lecture courses.
TILLICH sees no decline in the "resurgence of
religion" which began in the years after World
War 11. "The important thing is that young people
in our universities are asking ultimate questions,"
he said.
"How does one know about God?" This, said
