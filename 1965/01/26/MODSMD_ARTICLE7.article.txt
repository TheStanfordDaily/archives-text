# Silver Cites Miss. 'Hysteria'
## Sees Businessmen As State's Hope 
### ED BOARD 
"Tilt' hysteria is such now in
Mississippi — like it was in the
ISoO's — that people will do
things against their own eco
nomic interest," Professor James
Silver, author of Mississippi; The
Closed Society, told a capacity
crowd in Cubberley Auditorium
last night.
Silver, currently a guest-in-resi
dence of the Eating Clubs, dis
cussed the economic, moral and
political future of Mississippi with
Professors David Potter and Otis
Pease of the History Department.
PEASE SUGGESTED that
"time might be on the Negro's
side'' in the form of industrialism,
but Silver dissented. The '010 Miss
professor currently on leave at
the University of Notre Dame
noted that recently the Mississippi
Legislature forbid any city to ac
cept federal urban renewal grants
and that industry was not flock
ing to the state in great numbers.
"Indeed, businessmen in Miss,
are happy with the caste system
because although the workers
there are ihe lowest paid in the
nation they won't complain since
they have someone lower to take
it out on — the Negro."
However, Silver acknowledged
under questioning from Potter
that "business leaders arc the best
hope for change in the state." He
disagreed with Potter on the prob
ability of action by national cor
porations due to national pres
sures; "Frankly. I don't think the
national corporations give a
damn. . . . They are there to make
money."
POTTER AND SILVER, both
of whom taught at 'Ole Miss at
one time, again disagreed on the
political future of the state. Pot
ter warned of polarization into
white and black parties, and fore
saw the possibility of continued
Republican strength in the state.
Silver thought the Republican vic
tory in Mississippi this year was a
freak.
