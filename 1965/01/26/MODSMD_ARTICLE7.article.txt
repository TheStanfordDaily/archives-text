# Silver Cites Miss. 'Hysteria'
## Sees Businessmen As State's Hope 
### ED BOARD 
"Tilt' hysteria is such now in
Mississippi — like it was in the
ISoO's — that people will do
things against their own eco
nomic interest," Professor James
Silver, author of Mississippi; The
Closed Society, told a capacity
crowd in Cubberley Auditorium
last night.
Silver, currently a guest-in-resi
dence of the Eating Clubs, dis
cussed the economic, moral and
political future of Mississippi with
Professors David Potter and Otis
Pease of the History Department.
PEASE SUGGESTED that
"time might be on the Negro's
side'' in the form of industrialism,
but Silver dissented. The '010 Miss
professor currently on leave at
the University of Notre Dame
noted that recently the Mississippi
Legislature forbid any city to ac
cept federal urban renewal grants
and that industry was not flock
ing to the state in great numbers.
"Indeed, businessmen in Miss,
are happy with the caste system
because although the workers
there are ihe lowest paid in the
nation they won't complain since
they have someone lower to take
it out on — the Negro."
However, Silver acknowledged
under questioning from Potter
that "business leaders arc the best
hope for change in the state." He
disagreed with Potter on the prob
ability of action by national cor
porations due to national pres
sures; "Frankly. I don't think the
national corporations give a
damn. . . . They are there to make
money."
POTTER AND SILVER, both
of whom taught at 'Ole Miss at
one time, again disagreed on the
political future of the state. Pot
ter warned of polarization into
white and black parties, and fore
saw the possibility of continued
Republican strength in the state.
Silver thought the Republican vic
tory in Mississippi this year was a
freak.
Silver then turned on several
outside critics of the "closed so
ciety."
Earlier in the day, at a press
conference in Toyon lounge he
had scored the audience for allow
ing the Citizens' Councils to sur
vive "on California money." Last
night he declared that "the Negro
nas been more badly treated in
Indiana than in Mississippi.
Northern morality is johnny
come-lately. What is the morality
of Proposition 14?"
Finally, hec riticized some of
the Negro leaders themselves.
While professing admiration for
Aaron Henry, he denounced the
tendency to condone violence and

left-wing support voiced by Rob
ert Moses.
He also criticized novelist James
Baldwin "He doesn't have any
solutions to the problem in 1 h e
South. Negroes historically been

pacifist by necessity. Martin Lu
ther King may cite Gandhi, but
he knows damn well thai if Ne
groes get too violent then they
might get mowed down."
In a morning seminar in Tresid
der Union Silver discussed several
topics, including the emergence of
the Negro in the South. "What
the Negroes want in Mississippi,"
he said, "is the right to vote and
an end to police brutality. A n d
once they get the right to vote,
police brutality will end because
they will have a say in the elec
tions of local sheriffs."
Silver expressed fear that the
failure of Southern courts to pun
ish civil l ights violators could lead
to a breakdown of federal-state co
opera4ion in law enforcement, and
lead to a "federal gestapo."
Federal intervention, such as
that demanded by college students
working in Mississippi, "might
work, but could turn into some
thing that the civil rights workers
would regret later.
"YOU SEND IN federal offi
cials, you might, for some people,
make them so mad that they'll
fight till they're killed."
He commented on the long-range
effects of James Meredith's tu
multuous admission to the Univer
sity of Mississippi in 1962: "My
school has been destroyed for the
rest of my lifetime."
"The present dilemma in Mis
sissippi "will all be over in ten
years," he optimistically con
cluded. "There will be bitterness
among the older generation, but
it will not last forever."

he said, "is the right to vote and

once they get the right to vote,
police brutality will end because
they will have a say in the elec

Silver expressed fear that the

to a breakdown of federal-state co
opera4ion in law enforcement, and
lead to a "federal gestapo."
Federal intervention, such as
that demanded by college students
working in Mississippi, "might
work, but could turn into some

"YOU SEND IN federal offi

He commented on the long-range
effects of James Meredith's tu

"The present dilemma in Mis

"Tilt' hysteria is such now in
Mississippi — like it was in the
ISoO's — that people will do
things against their own eco
nomic interest," Professor James
Silver, author of Mississippi; The
Closed Society, told a capacity
crowd in Cubberley Auditorium
last night.
Silver, currently a guest-in-resi
dence of the Eating Clubs, dis
cussed the economic, moral and
political future of Mississippi with
Professors David Potter and Otis
Pease of the History Department.
PEASE SUGGESTED that
"time might be on the Negro's
side'' in the form of industrialism,
but Silver dissented. The '010 Miss
professor currently on leave at
the University of Notre Dame
noted that recently the Mississippi
Legislature forbid any city to ac
cept federal urban renewal grants
and that industry was not flock
ing to the state in great numbers.
"Indeed, businessmen in Miss,
are happy with the caste system
because although the workers
there are ihe lowest paid in the
nation they won't complain since
they have someone lower to take
it out on — the Negro."
However, Silver acknowledged
under questioning from Potter
that "business leaders arc the best
hope for change in the state." He
disagreed with Potter on the prob
ability of action by national cor
porations due to national pres
sures; "Frankly. I don't think the
national corporations give a
damn. . . . They are there to make
money."
POTTER AND SILVER, both
of whom taught at 'Ole Miss at
one time, again disagreed on the
political future of the state. Pot
ter warned of polarization into
white and black parties, and fore
saw the possibility of continued
Republican strength in the state.
Silver thought the Republican vic
tory in Mississippi this year was a
freak.

Silver then turned on several
outside critics of the "closed so
ciety."
Earlier in the day, at a press
conference in Toyon lounge he
had scored the audience for allow
ing the Citizens' Councils to sur
vive "on California money." Last
night he declared that "the Negro
nas been more badly treated in
Indiana than in Mississippi.
Northern morality is johnny
come-lately. What is the morality
of Proposition 14?"
Finally, hec riticized some of
the Negro leaders themselves.
While professing admiration for
Aaron Henry, he denounced the
tendency to condone violence and

left-wing support voiced by Rob
ert Moses.
He also criticized novelist James
Baldwin "He doesn't have any
solutions to the problem in 1 h e
South. Negroes historically been

pacifist by necessity. Martin Lu
ther King may cite Gandhi, but
he knows damn well thai if Ne
groes get too violent then they
might get mowed down."
In a morning seminar in Tresid
der Union Silver discussed several
topics, including the emergence of
the Negro in the South. "What
the Negroes want in Mississippi,"
he said, "is the right to vote and
an end to police brutality. A n d
once they get the right to vote,
police brutality will end because
