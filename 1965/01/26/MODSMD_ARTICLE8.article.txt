# Stop Smoking Clinic A Healthy Success
## 
### ODIN SMOKER 
The Five Day Slop Smok
ing Clinic has ended and with
it my addiction to cigarettes.
During the five days, l)r.
Burton of the Medical Center
and Mr. Cooper, the director,
devoted their time to help
fifty students stop smoking.
It is only fair that I evaluate
the program truthfully.
On the whole, the plan is
successful. The diet of fruits
and water eased the first
pains of quitting. The deep
breathing and the "cold mit
ten" showers are of benefit.
Even though. Dr. Burton
claims the course is not based
011 fear, the facts scare. It
was easy to convince us of
the detrimental effects of
smoking to our bodies. I
probably would not have quit
if smoking was not so de
structive to my present and
future health.
Many of my friends did not
take the plan due to its spon
sorship by a religions group.
Apparently, faith may move
mountains hut it cannot kick
the habit. The 1 e c t u r e r s
sensed the agitation of the
audience to religion and gen
erally avoided the topic. Re

ference, however, is mu<l<> to
the commandment, "Thou
shall not kill," when analyz
ing- motives to quit smoking.
Also they suggest an appeal
to Divine aid if the urge to
smoke becomes great.
At the final session. Dr.
Burton listed four things for
the group to remember: 1)
Non-smokers live eight years
longer. Insurance companies
will begin giving lower rates
to non-smokers. 2) A smoker
spends approximately 150 dol
lars a year on cigarettes. 3)
The self image that comes
from being able to control a
habit. 4) What, it feels like
to have emphysema. This
disease allows the victim only
to take half breaths. A
woman inthe audience is in
flicted with the disease. Sim
ple breathing exhausts her.
Mr. Cooper concluded the
session with a talk on the key
to the Stop Smoking Plan.
Since the mind will continue
to retain the urge to smoke,
the smoking liabit must be
overcome with another habit
—that of not smoking. To
aid us in acquiring (his habit,
the program develops the
idea of choosing instead of
promising not to smoke.

Burton listed four things for
the group to remember: 1)
Non-smokers live eight years
longer. Insurance companies
will begin giving lower rates
to non-smokers. 2) A smoker
spends approximately 150 dol
lars a year on cigarettes. 3)
The self image that comes
from being able to control a
habit. 4) What, it feels like
to have emphysema. This
disease allows the victim only
to take half breaths. A
woman inthe audience is in
flicted with the disease. Sim
ple breathing exhausts her.
Mr. Cooper concluded the
session with a talk on the key
to the Stop Smoking Plan.
Since the mind will continue
to retain the urge to smoke,
the smoking liabit must be
overcome with another habit
—that of not smoking. To
aid us in acquiring (his habit,
the program develops the
idea of choosing instead of
promising not to smoke.
The Five Day Slop Smok
ing Clinic has ended and with
it my addiction to cigarettes.
During the five days, l)r.
Burton of the Medical Center
and Mr. Cooper, the director,
devoted their time to help
fifty students stop smoking.
It is only fair that I evaluate
the program truthfully.
On the whole, the plan is
successful. The diet of fruits
and water eased the first
pains of quitting. The deep
breathing and the "cold mit
ten" showers are of benefit.
Even though. Dr. Burton
claims the course is not based
011 fear, the facts scare. It
was easy to convince us of
the detrimental effects of
smoking to our bodies. I
probably would not have quit
if smoking was not so de
structive to my present and
future health.
Many of my friends did not
take the plan due to its spon
sorship by a religions group.
Apparently, faith may move
mountains hut it cannot kick
the habit. The 1 e c t u r e r s
sensed the agitation of the
audience to religion and gen
erally avoided the topic. Re

ference, however, is mu<l<> to
the commandment, "Thou
shall not kill," when analyz
ing- motives to quit smoking.
Also they suggest an appeal
to Divine aid if the urge to
smoke becomes great.
