The Reality of Hell
"Hell" is a common swear word, but a subject not often seriously discussed
today. The modern philosopher often sees heaven and hell only as extremes
of life on earth. But as terrible as human suffering is at times, no experience
on earth compares to the agony of the lost in hell, eternally separated from
God.
Have you read the story Jesus Christ related concerning one individual
who forgot about God until it was too late? This incident is neither myth nor
fable, but according to the Word of God, is Gospel Truth:
"Now there was a certain rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple
and fine linen, gaily living in splendor every day. And a certain poor man
named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores, and longing to be
fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man's table; besides even
the dogs were coming and licking his sores.
"Now it came about that the poor man died and he was carried away
by the angels to Abraham's bosom, and the rich man also died, and was bur
ied. And in Hades he lefts up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham
far away, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried out and said, 'Father Abra
ham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his
finger in water and cool off my tongue,- for I am in agony in this flame.'
But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your life you received
your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being com
forted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you
there is a great chasm fixed, in order that those who would wish to come
over from here to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from
there to us.'
And he said, Then I beg you, Father, that you send him to my father's
house—for I have five brothers—that he may warm them, lest they also come
to this place of torment.'
But Abraham says, They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear
them.'
' But he said, No, Father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the
dead, they will repent!'
"But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets,
neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead' (Luke 16:19-31).
God is desirous that all men might be saved and come to the knowledge
of the truth (I Timothy 2:4), but a person's own will must be voluntarily
yielded and surrendered to Jesus Christ before God can rescue him from the
fate of hell. Your decision to trust Jesus Christ is all God asks.

and fine linen, gaily living in splendor every day. And a certain poor man
named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores, and longing to be
fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man's table; besides even
the dogs were coming and licking his sores.
"Now it came about that the poor man died and he was carried away
by the angels to Abraham's bosom, and the rich man also died, and was bur
ied. And in Hades he lefts up his eyes, being in torments, and sees Abraham
far away, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried out and said, 'Father Abra
ham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his
finger in water and cool off my tongue,- for I am in agony in this flame.'
But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that during your life you received
your good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things; but now he is being com
forted here and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us and you
there is a great chasm fixed, in order that those who would wish to come
over from here to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from
there to us.'
And he said, Then I beg you, Father, that you send him to my father's
house—for I have five brothers—that he may warm them, lest they also come
to this place of torment.'
But Abraham says, They have Moses and the Prophets, let them hear
them.'
' But he said, No, Father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the
dead, they will repent!'
"But he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets,
neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead' (Luke 16:19-31).
God is desirous that all men might be saved and come to the knowledge
of the truth (I Timothy 2:4), but a person's own will must be voluntarily
yielded and surrendered to Jesus Christ before God can rescue him from the
fate of hell. Your decision to trust Jesus Christ is all God asks.

The Reality of Hell
"Hell" is a common swear word, but a subject not often seriously discussed
today. The modern philosopher often sees heaven and hell only as extremes
of life on earth. But as terrible as human suffering is at times, no experience
on earth compares to the agony of the lost in hell, eternally separated from
God.
Have you read the story Jesus Christ related concerning one individual
who forgot about God until it was too late? This incident is neither myth nor
fable, but according to the Word of God, is Gospel Truth:
"Now there was a certain rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple
and fine linen, gaily living in splendor every day. And a certain poor man
named Lazarus was laid at his gate, covered with sores, and longing to be
fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man's table; besides even
the dogs were coming and licking his sores.
