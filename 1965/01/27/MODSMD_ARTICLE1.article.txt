Arithmetic is tlie same everywhere.
Or is it?
Here is an answer, straight from a
communist schoolroom:
"ON AUGUST (». 1945, a North
American military airplane dropped
an atomic bomb on the Japanese city
of Hiroshima. The effects of this bomb
were so awful that the population of
343,962 inhabitants was reduced to
137,197.
"How many inhabitants of Hiro
shima did the atomic bomb dropped
by the North Americans kill? How
many years have passed since this bar
barous act occurred?"
This problem is quoted from a
group of translations by Prof. Richard
R. Fagen of the Stanford Political
Science Department. Also included are
"Let's Alphabetize," the manual for

literacy workers, a n d "Eternally
Young, A Teacher Forever," an in
flammatory anti-American poem.
I>K. FAGEN'S book, Cuba: Th «•
Political C©ntt\iit of Adult Education
(paper, $1.50), was recently published
by the Hoover Institution as a part of
its Studies Series.
Hoover Institution publications
have greatly expanded in the past five
years. Director Glenn Campbell ex
plains, "Imaginative and persistent
collecting is only one measure of the
Institution's value.
"It must also be tested by the work
it does with these materials to foster
understanding and intelligent action."
OVER 150 RESEARCH projects are
in progress. In many instances the In
stitution intends to publish the results.
Territorial disputes between China
and the Soviet Union have received lit
tle attention in this country and have
been ignored by the American press.
A strong attack upon "erroneous"

territorial claims by the Chinese was
made in Pravda a few years ago. It
referred to a map in Chinese textbooks
showing 600,000 square km. of Soviet
lands as Chinese territory.
CHOU EN LAI made a forceful
statement in 1957 defending his coun
try's position. But even The New York
Times failed to mention the speech.
A Hoover study, The Slno-Soviet
Dispute by Dennis Doolin and Witold
Sworakowski is intended to focus pub
lic attention on the problem.
A massive project is being under
writ ten by the U.S. Disarmament and
Arms Control Agency on the economic
impact of disarmament. Originally in
tended to include only Southeast Asia,
the $140,000 study was expanded to
China as well.
Y. L. \Vu of San Francisco State, a
Hoover Institution Research Associ
ate, is director of the project. He has
a staff of more than 15.
A large share of the Hoover Insti

tution publications are bibliography.
These will never be sold at airports
and drugstores, but they are invalu
able to scholars.
Many libraries have standing orders
for any bibliography published by the
Institution. The reference books cover
all materials in a particular area, are
carefully annotated and organized.
ONE HOOVER bibliographer dis
covered that the path he was pursu
ing had already been traveled. After
working for a year to compile a bibli
ography, he was "scooped" by the pub
lication elsewhere of substantially the
same thing.
Other books are not exempt from
such misfortune. Dr. Stefan Possony,
Hoover Institution strategist, beat two
other biographers by only a month
with his book on Lenin. The three
books had major interpretative differ
ences.
Outside researchers are always free
to use the Hoover Institution for re

search. There is no restriction upon
users, and undergraduates are wel
come.
TWO PROFESSIONALS who used
the library not long ago were William
Shirer, for The Rise and Fall of The
Third Reich, and Barbara Tuchman,
researching The Guns of August.
A new source will be open to re
searchers with the organization of the
Nicolaievsky Collection, now an amor
phous body of materials.
Boris S. Nicolaievsky was a member
of the expatriate Menshevik Party
after 1919. His many contacts among
Menshevik and Bolshevik leaders en
abled him to acquire valuable books
and documents. He is now 81.
The collection was brought from the
East in three large truckloads. Mr. Ni
colaievsky is now attempting to or
ganize it. Five thousand books as well
as personal letters from Engels,
Lenin, Trotsky and others are among
the holdings.

Hoover Institution publications
have greatly expanded in the past five
years. Director Glenn Campbell ex
plains, "Imaginative and persistent
collecting is only one measure of the
Institution's value.
"It must also be tested by the work
it does with these materials to foster
understanding and intelligent action."
OVER 150 RESEARCH projects are
in progress. In many instances the In
stitution intends to publish the results.
Territorial disputes between China
and the Soviet Union have received lit
tle attention in this country and have
been ignored by the American press.
A strong attack upon "erroneous"

territorial claims by the Chinese was
made in Pravda a few years ago. It
referred to a map in Chinese textbooks
showing 600,000 square km. of Soviet
lands as Chinese territory.
CHOU EN LAI made a forceful
statement in 1957 defending his coun
try's position. But even The New York
Times failed to mention the speech.
A Hoover study, The Slno-Soviet
Dispute by Dennis Doolin and Witold
Sworakowski is intended to focus pub
lic attention on the problem.
A massive project is being under
writ ten by the U.S. Disarmament and
Arms Control Agency on the economic
impact of disarmament. Originally in
tended to include only Southeast Asia,
the $140,000 study was expanded to
China as well.
Y. L. \Vu of San Francisco State, a
Hoover Institution Research Associ
ate, is director of the project. He has
a staff of more than 15.
A large share of the Hoover Insti

tution publications are bibliography.
These will never be sold at airports
and drugstores, but they are invalu
able to scholars.
Many libraries have standing orders
for any bibliography published by the
Institution. The reference books cover
all materials in a particular area, are
carefully annotated and organized.
ONE HOOVER bibliographer dis
covered that the path he was pursu
ing had already been traveled. After
working for a year to compile a bibli
ography, he was "scooped" by the pub
lication elsewhere of substantially the
same thing.
Other books are not exempt from
such misfortune. Dr. Stefan Possony,
Hoover Institution strategist, beat two
other biographers by only a month
with his book on Lenin. The three
books had major interpretative differ
ences.
Outside researchers are always free
to use the Hoover Institution for re

search. There is no restriction upon
users, and undergraduates are wel
come.
TWO PROFESSIONALS who used
the library not long ago were William
Shirer, for The Rise and Fall of The
Third Reich, and Barbara Tuchman,
researching The Guns of August.
A new source will be open to re
searchers with the organization of the
Nicolaievsky Collection, now an amor

Boris S. Nicolaievsky was a member
of the expatriate Menshevik Party
after 1919. His many contacts among
Menshevik and Bolshevik leaders en
abled him to acquire valuable books
and documents. He is now 81.
The collection was brought from the
East in three large truckloads. Mr. Ni
colaievsky is now attempting to or
ganize it. Five thousand books as well
as personal letters from Engels,
Lenin, Trotsky and others are among
the holdings.

"ON AUGUST (». 1945, a North

OVER 150 RESEARCH projects are
in progress. In many instances the In
stitution intends to publish the results.
Territorial disputes between China
and the Soviet Union have received lit
tle attention in this country and have
been ignored by the American press.
A strong attack upon "erroneous"

territorial claims by the Chinese was
made in Pravda a few years ago. It
referred to a map in Chinese textbooks
showing 600,000 square km. of Soviet
lands as Chinese territory.
CHOU EN LAI made a forceful
statement in 1957 defending his coun
try's position. But even The New York
Times failed to mention the speech.
A Hoover study, The Slno-Soviet
Dispute by Dennis Doolin and Witold
Sworakowski is intended to focus pub
lic attention on the problem.
A massive project is being under
writ ten by the U.S. Disarmament and
Arms Control Agency on the economic
impact of disarmament. Originally in
tended to include only Southeast Asia,
the $140,000 study was expanded to
China as well.
Y. L. \Vu of San Francisco State, a
Hoover Institution Research Associ
ate, is director of the project. He has
a staff of more than 15.
A large share of the Hoover Insti

tution publications are bibliography.
These will never be sold at airports
and drugstores, but they are invalu
able to scholars.
Many libraries have standing orders
for any bibliography published by the
Institution. The reference books cover
all materials in a particular area, are
carefully annotated and organized.
ONE HOOVER bibliographer dis
covered that the path he was pursu
ing had already been traveled. After
working for a year to compile a bibli
ography, he was "scooped" by the pub
lication elsewhere of substantially the
same thing.
Other books are not exempt from
such misfortune. Dr. Stefan Possony,
Hoover Institution strategist, beat two
other biographers by only a month
with his book on Lenin. The three
books had major interpretative differ
ences.
Outside researchers are always free
to use the Hoover Institution for re

search. There is no restriction upon
users, and undergraduates are wel
come.
TWO PROFESSIONALS who used
the library not long ago were William
Shirer, for The Rise and Fall of The
Third Reich, and Barbara Tuchman,
researching The Guns of August.
A new source will be open to re
searchers with the organization of the
Nicolaievsky Collection, now an amor
phous body of materials.
Boris S. Nicolaievsky was a member
of the expatriate Menshevik Party
after 1919. His many contacts among
Menshevik and Bolshevik leaders en
abled him to acquire valuable books
and documents. He is now 81.
The collection was brought from the
East in three large truckloads. Mr. Ni
colaievsky is now attempting to or
ganize it. Five thousand books as well
as personal letters from Engels,
Lenin, Trotsky and others are among
the holdings.
