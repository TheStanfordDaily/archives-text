## For Coaches It's Win Or Wither Away 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Events in the past few weeks have impressed on people the fact
that the job of football coach is, at best, a precarious one. Three of
Stanford's football opponents last year, San Jose State., UCLA, and
Oregon State, will have new coaches this fall. None Dame and Wash
ington State, had coaches who were in their first year of coaching.
After completing only two years of coaching in the AAYVU, Stan
ford's John Ralston has quickly moved up the seniority ladder and
is currently fourth among eight coaches.
Only Oregon's Len Casanova, who has survived I<l years as head
coach of the Ducks; Washington's Jim Owens, who has been at the
helm of ihe Huskies for six years; and SC's John McKay, who is a
five-year veteran, outrank him.
< OACII IS STRATEGIST
A football coach is a strategist and a leader, but perhaps even
more important he is a salesman. He must sell himself to the alumni
who back his program with funds and he must sell his team to the
student body and to the prospective fans so that they will all end
the games and strongly support the efforts of his team.
In the end, a football coach can point to only one fact Ihat has
great significance when he is presenting his case. And that is a win
ning record. As a salesman is often judged by his wares, so a football
coach is judged by his team's record despite what seeming assets he
might have as a producer of mentally and technically competent foot
ball squads.
LOSING IS FATAL
So a coach who continues to compile mediocre records will eventu
ally jobless. If he wants to continue coaching, he must settle for a

position considerably below the
one lie was evicted from. Bill
Barnes, ex-Bruin mentor, has in
dicated he will join an investment
consulting firm, and it is reason
able to assume not even the 20-
mule Borax team could drag him
back into coaching. Bob Titchenal,
recently ousted from his coaching
post at San Jose State, will con
tinue to teach physical education
at that institution.
The one cause for their dismis
sal or forced resignation was
sporadic winning, which ulti
mately led to pressure.
In some cases, the man is at
fault. In others, the losing is in
herent in the present policies and
structure of the institution. If the
latter is the case, coaches will
flow in and out at approximately
five-year intervals.
FEW COACHES
Stanford, traditionally, has had
coaches who had sizable terms of
service. Since "Pop" Warner took
over in 1924, only seven coaches,
including Ralston, have headed
the football program. Either Stan
ford is more sensible in its policies
or luckier in ils choice of coaches.
Perhaps both.
Under Ralston, things appear to
be on the upswing. For next, year,
the keynote is optimism. For the
last few years, winning has n o t
been a tradition, and, conse
quently. it was not really ex
pected, only hoped for. Winning is
still not a tradition, but. it's not
loo far away.
