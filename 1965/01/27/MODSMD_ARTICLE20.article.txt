## Revolution In 'The Daily': Is The Establishment Dead? 
### 
John ft. Boiiiiie

A revolution has swept the pages of The Daily
during the past year one which will reverberate
for some time to come."The Peninsula's only morn
ing newspaper" has thus taken a long step away
from its former status as a diatribie vehicle for
the furthering of the personal predilections of its
editor and toward its avowed status as a news
paper.
The manifold changes, from the new policy
respecting national and student columnists to the
radically altered content of the news pages, would
be but flashes in the pan had they come before
January of last year. But they are in fact a part
of a thoroughgoing revolution which shattered the
old "Establishment" which controlled The Daily
and the ASSU.
For several years this self-perpetuating clique
smoothly passed the editorship around from one
"insider" on the editorial board to the next.
Revolution From Below
In January 1964, the staff editor Bill Moore,
broke the complacent rut into which the newspaper
had fallen by announcing his candidacy for editor
and challenging the candidate of the powers-that
were. This was the first contested election in mem
ory. Moore's popularity with the lower staff over
came the voting bloc of the editorial board (whose
members have several votes apiece) and he was
swept in on a two-thirds majority.
But the persons on the staff with experience
and talent were still primarily the old Establish
ment, and they had to lie called upon to fill the
posts on the upper staff. Again in Spring, 1964.
they put up their candidate and Moore himself
toyed with the idea of running for a second term.
But Moore's staff editor, then-sophomore Rob'
ert Naylor, also announced his candidacy (having
been on the staff a scant year-and-a-half). Moore
eventually pulled out and Naylor also scored a
"revolution from below" victory with overwhelm
ing support from the lower staff and the Editor
and Managing Editor, but with the opposition of
most of the editorial board.
Old Establishment Returns
Now, one year after the original insurgency,
the editorship passes on to a former member of
the old Establishment • the vestiges of which
are becoming difficult to see. Once again, the elec
tion was uncontested, for the covey of freshmen
and sophomores which came in with Moore and
Naylor are not yet ripe.
But the imprint of Volumes 145 and 146 is deep
and will doubtlessly remain. The new editor has
announced her satisfaction with practically all of
the changes. Here are some of the policies which
Moore and Naylor instituted in their brief year:
• Most important, Moore's very first issues in
dicated a new policy of even-handedne.ss and fair
ness toward divergent points of view. Moore, a
Democrat, recruited two conservative student col
umnists and two liberals. He began a series of
"Forums" between students, faculty members, and
public figures exploring opposite sides of public
issues. I lis "Mailbox" was thrown open to all print
able letters, without discrimination or effort to

censor their contents on the basis of disagreement
with them.
Naylor kept one each of the student columnists
and brought William F. Buckley, Jr., and Walter
Lippmann to the editorial page on a weekly basis.
(Russell Kirk was run for a very short time in the
fall of 1963 and Lippmann had been with The Daily
on a semi-regular basis for over a decade.)
Other Policy Changes
Naylor also brought in Pulitzer-Prize winning
cartoonist Paul Conrad, the "8.C." cartoon strip,
and student columnist Art Fisher, and started the
Stanford Poll. He continued the "wide-open" policy
with respect to the Letters section and encouraged
more guest columns by non-Daily writers.
• In sharp contrast to the practice of Daily
editors of the past several years, Moore decreed
that the news pages would no longer be used to
push pet causes, but would be devoted to the news
as it occurred. Reporting was to be objective and
concise; its style was to bo enlivened (although a
high quota of irritating errors crept in anyway).
(The nadir of objectivity might have been
reached four years earlier when a Daily reporter
referred to the San Francisco police as "black
shirts" in his front page "news" account of the
HUAC riots.)
The effort was successful, and The Daily re
ceived a rating of "First Class" from the Asso
ciated Collegiate Press last year.
"Revolution Of Fairness"
Where will The Daily go from here? Will the
old Establishment —which lost The Daily, th e
ASSIJ Presidency, and LASSU last year—reassert
itself? More important, will the newspaper slip
back into its former status as a partisan tool?
Most staffers hope not. There is reason to be
lieve their hopes are justified. The new breed of
journalists running The Daily are more concerned
with putting out a serious newspaper than with
using it as a tool. The new editor has already taken
several actions which indicate that this will be her
goal too.
Readers can expect jolting changes in the edi
torials. but the "revolution of fairness" which has
touched The Daily will likely continue and perhaps
new ways to implement it can be found.
Of course, several changes in this newspaper
do not bear upon the policy revolution, but mark
its increasing professionalization and relevance to
the campus. The regular space reserved for
"News in Brief" from the AP wire, the weekly
entertainment page (greatly upgraded this past
quarter by Joe Jacobs), and even the automation
of its staff (which is now on IBM cards) have all
helped. Much of the credit for the revisions on the
news pages must go to the Managing Editor of
both volumes, Jim Home.
But most important for the future of Stanford's
newspaper has been the revolution in which Edi
tors Moore and Naylor have succeeded in making
it no longer the plaything of a group of campus
politicos. It no longer gives only token space to its
dissenters and detractors. Us news pages are no
longer used to pursue personal crusades or ven
dettas.
