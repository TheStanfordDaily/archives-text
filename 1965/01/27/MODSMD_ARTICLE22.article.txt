# Editor, The Daily
## From The Hippopotamus: Group I, Get Off My Back 
### 
Dear Sir:
(In reference to Art Fisher's
column "Two Undergrad Commu
nities: The Serious Rifle Pitfgy-
Rack"), greetings from the Hip
popotami.
Please, Group I, get off o u r
backs and up again on your ped
estal. May I remind you that when
you discover those life-giving
medicines, there has to be some
one to shoot them in the millions |
of fannies; when you show us how
to harness energy to fly above the
earth and speed along the high
ways, there has to be someone to i
make, sell, buy, and ride in the
darn contraptions. . . . when!
you write your hooks and plays!
and compose your beautiful mu- j
sic, must you be angry that we
are only consumers? (Think how
angry you are when we don't like
them.) . . .
While we squirm and struggle
in the middle of the bell-shaped
curve and you move in the un
crowded spaces of the upper per
centiles remember that many
of your group have given us the
precious insight of tolerance.

So â€” since you of Group I care
not for tilings but for the higher
reaches of the spirit, please let
me go off happily (in my Lincoln
Continental) to a party where we
are apt to talk about, sports and
how to win in the market. After
all, old homo consumus got you
your Ford Foundation Grant and
made possible th e magificent
farm where you sow the seeds of
genius.
Love and Kisses,
A CONSTANT READER
EDITOR'S NOTE: Precisely
Mr. Fisher's point.
