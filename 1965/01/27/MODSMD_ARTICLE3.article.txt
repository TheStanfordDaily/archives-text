In the South today, "self-respect has been sacrificed on the
altar of respectability," Alabama lawyer Cliiford Durr charged in
a Tresidder speech yesterday sponsored by the Legacy of the Civil
War Project.
The current Southern dogma on civil rights is perhaps less a

►matter of "simple prejudice," he
I suggested, "than the result of a
fearful desire to conform, abetted
i by the kind of default in respon
! sible political leadership reminis
cent of the McCarthy era."
I)URK DRIiW a sharp parallel
between the local "Closed so
cieties" of the deep South and the
"National closed society" which,
ho maintains, existed during the
i 19.")0's—and which still exists.
"Up North during the ."50's," he
i said, "You'd shout red and people
[would stop thinking; they'd even
turn on their neighbors and
friends in an effort to prove them
selves 'pure.'
"In the South it's the same
thing; you shout 'nigger lover'
land people fall over each other
trying to defend their 'southern
; ness.'"
Durr stressed that lie is "11 o t
concerned with the rights of Ne
groes as Negroes, but with their
rights as people; because," lie
added, "I happen to be a 'people'
myself and I know that where
the rights and liberties of one in
dividual or group are denied., all
are in danger."
