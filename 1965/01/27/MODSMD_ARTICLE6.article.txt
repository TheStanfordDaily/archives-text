# Silver Recounts Friendship And Racial Views Of Faulkner
## 
### 
"The moment the hearse crossed
the square on its way to the ceme
tery -this is when Oxford and
: Mississippi felt in love with Wil
! liam Faulkner."
i These words help explain the
j great author's relationship to the
| people in whose country he lived,
according to Dr. James W. Silver,
j who spoke on Faulkner to a large
[ group in Arroyo last night.
"THEY DESPISED him. T hey
j didn't understand hi m. They
i thought him an eccentric."
Silver, a professor of history
at the University of Mississippi
and guest of Stanford's eating
clubs, reminisced about his friend
ship with William Faulker, which
: lasted until the writer's death in
1962.
"Bill was a very shy man, a
very timid man. He was always
polite."
THERE HAS been much confu-
I sion concerning Faulkner's views
j on the Negro problem, Silver ex
plained. "But I talked with him
for ten years about the race ques
tion and there is no doubt in my
; mind about how he felt."
Silver insisted that the author
j was convinced the South's mores
■ must change.
"But lie was not an activist; he
J was not a reformer." Silver re
marked that if the Nobel Prize

winner had been alive during the!
racial crisis at the University of j
Mississippi, he would probably
have been at home smoking a
cigar.
. YET AT TIMES he did act, Sil
ver explained. He associated him
j self with a group that, hoped to
| counter the White Citizens Coun-!
j eil in Laffayette County. He was
i concerned that Frank Smith, Mis
j sissippi's only liberal Congress-
I man, would be defeated.
According to Silver, Faulkner
| remained silent on the race ques
j tion for the last few years of his j
; life.
I This fact, in addition to a book |
written by the author's brother 1

and some statements Faulkner
himself made, all contributed to
the misunderstanding of his views
on the colored people and th e
South.
"IN ABSALOM, ABSALOM,"
Silver commented. Faulkner was
writing about the sin committed
by white people who came in and
raped the land, raped tho Indians,
and most of all, the Negroes and
who then themselves decayed."
And indeed Faulkner was eccen
tric, according to Sliver. In 1962,
the author, who didn't have a tele
vision set, came to Silver's house
for seven weeks in a row to watch
the one show he was enarmoured
of — "Car 54, Where Are You."

Mississippi: The Closed Society and current
guest-in-residence of the Eating Club explains

his interpretations of the Mississippi situation
at an informal seminar. Carl Simpson and Jon
Roise take notes.
"The moment the hearse crossed
the square on its way to the ceme
tery -this is when Oxford and
: Mississippi felt in love with Wil
! liam Faulkner."
i These words help explain the
j great author's relationship to the
| people in whose country he lived,
according to Dr. James W. Silver,
j who spoke on Faulkner to a large
[ group in Arroyo last night.
"THEY DESPISED him. T hey
j didn't understand hi m. They
i thought him an eccentric."
Silver, a professor of history
at the University of Mississippi
and guest of Stanford's eating
clubs, reminisced about his friend
ship with William Faulker, which
: lasted until the writer's death in
1962.
"Bill was a very shy man, a
very timid man. He was always
polite."
THERE HAS been much confu-
I sion concerning Faulkner's views
j on the Negro problem, Silver ex
plained. "But I talked with him
for ten years about the race ques
tion and there is no doubt in my
; mind about how he felt."
Silver insisted that the author
j was convinced the South's mores
■ must change.
"But lie was not an activist; he
J was not a reformer." Silver re
marked that if the Nobel Prize

winner had been alive during the!
racial crisis at the University of j
Mississippi, he would probably
have been at home smoking a
cigar.
. YET AT TIMES he did act, Sil
ver explained. He associated him
j self with a group that, hoped to
| counter the White Citizens Coun-!
j eil in Laffayette County. He was
i concerned that Frank Smith, Mis
j sissippi's only liberal Congress-
I man, would be defeated.
According to Silver, Faulkner
| remained silent on the race ques
j tion for the last few years of his j
; life.
I This fact, in addition to a book |
written by the author's brother 1

and some statements Faulkner
himself made, all contributed to
the misunderstanding of his views
on the colored people and th e
South.
"IN ABSALOM, ABSALOM,"
Silver commented. Faulkner was
writing about the sin committed
by white people who came in and
raped the land, raped tho Indians,
and most of all, the Negroes and
who then themselves decayed."
And indeed Faulkner was eccen
tric, according to Sliver. In 1962,
the author, who didn't have a tele
vision set, came to Silver's house
for seven weeks in a row to watch
the one show he was enarmoured
of — "Car 54, Where Are You."
