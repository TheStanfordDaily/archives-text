# PSYCHOLOGY EXPERIMENT
## Study Of Test Anxiety 
### 
Dr. Karl Koenig and Dr. John Wallace of the
Psychology Department are looking for under
graduates who characterize themselves as "abnor
mally test-anxious."
They will be conducting experiments this quar
ter to compare the effectiveness of different
methods of reducing unreasonable test anxiety.
SI'IMKCTS would be expected to spend an houi
or two once or twice a week on the experiments.
Hopefully the study time lost would bo more than
j regained by the subject in the form of greater
j calmness and efficiency in taking exams.
Koenig emphasizes the point that In 1 is looking
j for abnormally test-anxious students. He is care
: ful to exclude students who depend upon some
i amount of anxiety to improve their test perform
ance.
Koenig and Wallace also worked on the smok
, ing experiment last quarter, thereby creating a
group of anxious students for this quarter's pro
gram Students who participated in this program.
01 in i he I'ivo Day Smoking Clinic, m;i\ find t he

help they need to get through the quarter in the
anxiety-rcduetion experiments.
IN FORTUNATELY, the anxiety-reduction sub
jects should emerge with a lessened need lor
cigarettes, so that there will he a reduced number
of eligible subjects for smoking clinics next quar
ter.
If ilie current trend is to be continued, Koenig
and Wallace will have to generate some new side
effect in their subjects. Perhaps the? high-anxiety
subjects will emerge from the experiments with
a fear of snakes.
In that case, we could expect a Five-Day-Stop
.Smoking • While - Reducing • Your • Test - Anxiety-
And • Conquering - Your - Fear • of - Snakes Clinic
next autumn quarter.
In any case, any highly test-anxious undergrad
uate. whether he is a smoker, or a non-smoker,
in an ex smoker, who would like to participate in
the study, and as a consequence possibly raise his
grades, can contact Dr. Koenig between 1* and 1
