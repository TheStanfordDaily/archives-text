AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER
Born, Not Made
Christians are born, not made, and Christian life is expe
rience with God, not philosophy or religious speculation. When
asked by a scholar and leader of His day how a man might
enter the Kingdom of God, Jesus told Nicodemus, "You must
be born again" (John 3:1-3). To be "born again," (literally
in the Greek, "to be born from above"), is to be regenerated
by God—made alive spiritually. Nicodemus at first confused
spiritual birth with the well-known experience of physical birth
(John 3:4-12), but Jesus emphasized that the new birth was
different—one which every man must experience if he would
know the reality of God in his life.
Spiritual birth is the direct result of personally receiving
Jesus Christ, the Word of God: "You have been born anew,
not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living
and abiding word of God; for all flesh is like grass, and all
its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers and the
flower falls, but the word of the Lord abides forever. That word
is the good news (Gospel) which was preached to you" (I
Peter 1:23-25).
The "new birth" has immediate and long-term conse
quences in the life of any individual. What God does for a
person the moment he is spiritually born is to create a new
life altogether, for God does not reform or refine sinners. From
God's viewpoint, "If any man be in Christ he is a new creation,
old things are passed away, behold all things are become
new (2 Corinthinians 5:17).
It is one thing to talk about the new birth, to discuss being
born again, and quite another thing to actually experience this
miraculous transformation. Spiritual birth is emphatically real,
and definitely possible for any and all; the only requirement
is willingness to let Jesus Christ enter one's life. The result of
your decision will be a real and deeply personal meeting with
God resulting in peace and joy which is not available through
any other means.
Have you been born from above? Why not receive Jesus
Christ by faith now. In a moment of time your life can be
I changed!

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER
Born, Not Made
Christians are born, not made, and Christian life is expe
rience with God, not philosophy or religious speculation. When
asked by a scholar and leader of His day how a man might
enter the Kingdom of God, Jesus told Nicodemus, "You must
be born again" (John 3:1-3). To be "born again," (literally
in the Greek, "to be born from above"), is to be regenerated
by God—made alive spiritually. Nicodemus at first confused
spiritual birth with the well-known experience of physical birth
(John 3:4-12), but Jesus emphasized that the new birth was
different—one which every man must experience if he would
know the reality of God in his life.
Spiritual birth is the direct result of personally receiving
Jesus Christ, the Word of God: "You have been born anew,
not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living
and abiding word of God; for all flesh is like grass, and all
its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers and the
flower falls, but the word of the Lord abides forever. That word
is the good news (Gospel) which was preached to you" (I
Peter 1:23-25).
The "new birth" has immediate and long-term conse
quences in the life of any individual. What God does for a
person the moment he is spiritually born is to create a new
life altogether, for God does not reform or refine sinners. From
God's viewpoint, "If any man be in Christ he is a new creation,
old things are passed away, behold all things are become
new (2 Corinthinians 5:17).
It is one thing to talk about the new birth, to discuss being
born again, and quite another thing to actually experience this
miraculous transformation. Spiritual birth is emphatically real,
and definitely possible for any and all; the only requirement
is willingness to let Jesus Christ enter one's life. The result of
your decision will be a real and deeply personal meeting with
God resulting in peace and joy which is not available through
any other means.
Have you been born from above? Why not receive Jesus
Christ by faith now. In a moment of time your life can be
I changed!
