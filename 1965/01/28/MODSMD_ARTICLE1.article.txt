# Companion Building For Hoover Tower
## 
### MICHAEL COUZENS (Fifth in a Series) 
The Hoover Institution is determined to
persuade us that il has the Stanford spirit. It
plans to erect a new building.
Two stories high with two tiers of base
ment, the new,building will be located between
Hoover Tower and Encina Hall.
A PODIUM will raise the building above
ground to the level of Hoover Tower's first
floor. The tower will be joined to it by an
underground passage.
University planning anticipates a cement
plaza behind the new building eventually. Fur
ther to the South will be the Undergraduate
Library, while diagonally across from the In
stitution complex the Graduate School of Busi
ness is under construction.
Accelerated publishing volume all over the
world has helped make the new building neces
sary. When Hoover Tower was built in 1911
if was hoped the building would not fill for
'10 years.
BUT THE Hoover Institution has already
run out of space. Two floors of stacks above

the observation platform in the dome are full.
Some newspaper and poster collections are
now being stored in the basement of Stein
Hall.
Distinguished researchers such as Theodore
Draper have been asked to work at home be
cause of the lack of office space.
Witold Sworakowski, Assistant Director,
explains, "In the mid-1930's copyrighted books
in the U.S. were somewhere around 11,000 a
year. The volume now is 25,000.
"THE U.S.S.R. published about 15,000 a
year then. Today the figure is closer to 80,000.
And the planners never imagined the many
new nations from whom we get materials."
A $750,000 matching grant from Mrs. Alan
M. Scaife and her family of Pittsburgh made
the new building possible. The gift was in
tended as a tribute to Herbert Hoover, whose
keen interest in the building continued through
the last weeks of his life.
For all the attention its crisp new building
will receive, the Hoover Institution will still
Ik> thought of in terms of the landmark il now
occupies, 285-foot Hoover Tower.

DEDICATED IN 1941, Stanford's fiftieth
year, the tower is perhaps as famous as the
unique collections it contains.
On the observation deck is a 35-bell caril
lon used by Belgium at the 1939 World's Fair.

It was presented to Mr. Hoover by the Belgian
American Educational Foundation in honor of
his relief work during World War I.
The carillon is played automatically by a
drum on the thirteenth floor which operates
like a music box. Its repertoire consists of
"The Stanford Hymn" and "Hail Alma Mater."
A "KEYBOARD" of wooden pegs may be
used for concerts. Prof. James Angell of the
Electrical Engineering Department is Univer
sity Carrilloner. He plays by grasping or strik
ing the pegs firmly and by use of foot pedals
for more complicated pieces.
On the ground floor of Hoover Tower is the
Lou Henry Hoover Room. It contains some of
the memorabilia and honors once held by Mrs.
Hoover.
The opposite alcove, containing memories
o'f Herbert Hoover, will soon be open to the
public. Included are embroidered flower sacks
which Belgian children sewed in his honor,
the desk he used as Secretary of Commerce
and i lie President's chair used at cabinet meet
in,gs.
MAIN OFFICES, with the only large win

dow, are on the eleventh floor. The lour wood
paneled corner offices are occupied by The
Director, his Executive Assistant, Director
Emeritus Ralph H. Lutz and the Assistant Di
rector.
Mr. Hoover used tho office now occupied
by the Executive Assistant on his summer
visits to Stanford.
Fourteen floors of stacks are found be
tween floors three and nine. They are labeled
3, 3M, 4, 4M, etc., the "JVI" presumably denot
ing mezzanine.
STACKS ARE accessible only by the staff
elevator. The main elevator clues not stop be
tween floors one and ten.
Staff are not the only occupants of the
building. The four appendages just below the
dome are homes for owls and other birds. The
turrets are called "elephant towers" by the
staff because of their similarity to buildings
in Asia.
A cluster of four outdoor lights is always
lit in the cupola atop the dome, at the request
of nearby Moffett Field. The lights are pro
tected from birds by a wire mesh.
