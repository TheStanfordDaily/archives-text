Heal racial tolerance lias conic about because the intelleetua
climate Ikis clumped since llie 1850s, and only tliis change ha;
made a civil rights law possible,' noted Dr. James Silver W'ednes
day in his last appearance at Stanford.
Silver, historx professor at llie University of Mississippi, dis

cussed "Civil Rights Legislation
in the South, 187:3-1964 " in a
speech last night ;it Tresidder.
He criticized the many people
who believe that the "law pre
ceded racial toleration, and social
adaplat ion followed."
SILVER observed th.it the 1961
Civil Rights Law is almost iden
tical to the Civil Rights Act of
187:3. The 19th century law did
not succeed because there was no
philosophical base for it, he said.
Social Darwinism. Ih e while
man's burden and laissez faire
were some of the beliefs contri
buting to racial prejudice.

"All the way through the 19th
â€¢ century there has been a uni
I versa 1 Negro phobia in this coun
try," he stated. "ITnlil Darwinism
the best scientific thinking as
i sumed Negro inferiority.'
Silver attributed a change ir
feeling to scholars and professors
! "whose increase in knowledge
caused these views to disinte
grate."
But according to the professor,
"the battle has just begun. The
fulure requires from everyone a
constant, intelligent, unrelenting
, campaign to eradicate the roots
I of ignorance and prejudice."
