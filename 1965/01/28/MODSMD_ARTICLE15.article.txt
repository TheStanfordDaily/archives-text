# LA 						TIMES VIEWS STANFORD
## Is Apathy Endangered? 
### BARBARA SAVERY 
William Trombley, education
writer for the Los Angeles Times,
warned ot a possible uprising at
Stanford in a recent series of
articles.
Students traditionally concerned
with "girls, golf, and good jobs,"
have, he threatens ominously, "be
come acutely aware of the world's
problems and willing to take ac
tion to correct them. Although the
per capita ownership of Maseru!is
still runs high, some agitated
hearts beat beneath the at fluent
surface."
NOTING THAT Stanford ad

ministrators, leery of a student
rebellion similar to the Cal FSM
movement, have hastened to resur
rect the undergraduate study pro
gram and to personalize academic
intercourse, Trombloy writes that
growing student dissatisfaction
made such reforms imperative.
"Eighly-five Stanford students
entered the Peace Corps in 19G4;
a number were involved in the
Mississippi Freedom project; and
the University's student body even
endorsed, on paper, the FSM
movement."
He cited the 1-19 ratio of teach
er to students as a further source
of dissatisfaction. Harvard, he
noted, has a ratio of 1-18.
"THE FUROR over late-leaves
for coeds may well blow up into
an equivalent of the FSM furor,"
lie proposed.
Unfortunately for the possible
drama it might lend to the Stan
ford scene, Trombley's analysis
of the Farm is one that is little
endorsed by the students them
selves.
According to Scott Mcßride,
ASSU President, "Few students
would be willing to risk their
academic careers for some FSM
type cause," and Rhodes Scholar
elect, Tom Cotton, adds, "We're
not less frustrated than Cal stu
dents, we're more sublimated."
THE ADJUSTMENT of Stan
ford students is not, however, due
to apathy, but more to a lack of

real grievances. The real attitude
of the studenl-body is perhaps
summed up by senior Skip Mar
tin's remark that, "It's pretty hard
for people to make a very strong
case about poor quality of teach
ing. We see a lot of the best men
in our departmtnts and don't have
too many teaching assistants."
It seems that Trombley is bark
ing up the wrong tree if he's look- i
ing for a student insurrection al j

endorsed by the students them
selves.
According to Scott Mcßride,
ASSU President, "Few students
would be willing to risk their
academic careers for some FSM
type cause," and Rhodes Scholar
elect, Tom Cotton, adds, "We're
not less frustrated than Cal stu
dents, we're more sublimated."
THE ADJUSTMENT of Stan
ford students is not, however, due
to apathy, but more to a lack of

real grievances. The real attitude
of the studenl-body is perhaps
summed up by senior Skip Mar
tin's remark that, "It's pretty hard
for people to make a very strong
case about poor quality of teach
ing. We see a lot of the best men
in our departmtnts and don't have
too many teaching assistants."
It seems that Trombley is bark
ing up the wrong tree if he's look- i
ing for a student insurrection al j
Stanford.
William Trombley, education
writer for the Los Angeles Times,
warned ot a possible uprising at
Stanford in a recent series of
articles.
Students traditionally concerned
with "girls, golf, and good jobs,"
have, he threatens ominously, "be
come acutely aware of the world's
problems and willing to take ac
tion to correct them. Although the
per capita ownership of Maseru!is
still runs high, some agitated
hearts beat beneath the at fluent
surface."
NOTING THAT Stanford ad

ministrators, leery of a student
rebellion similar to the Cal FSM
movement, have hastened to resur
rect the undergraduate study pro
gram and to personalize academic
intercourse, Trombloy writes that
growing student dissatisfaction
made such reforms imperative.
"Eighly-five Stanford students
entered the Peace Corps in 19G4;
a number were involved in the
Mississippi Freedom project; and
the University's student body even
endorsed, on paper, the FSM
movement."
He cited the 1-19 ratio of teach
er to students as a further source
of dissatisfaction. Harvard, he
noted, has a ratio of 1-18.
"THE FUROR over late-leaves
for coeds may well blow up into
an equivalent of the FSM furor,"
lie proposed.
Unfortunately for the possible
drama it might lend to the Stan
ford scene, Trombley's analysis
of the Farm is one that is little
endorsed by the students them
selves.
