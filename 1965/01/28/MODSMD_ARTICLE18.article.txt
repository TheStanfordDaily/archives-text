## 
### ROBERT THIERIOT 
Not l'ully recovered from two
losses down sonlh, Howie Dall
mar's warriors will hopefully set
out on another warpath tonight
at the Pavilion, when they m ee t
the University of California at
Santa Barbara in the first game
of a home-and-home series. A
limited number of tickets are
available at the Department of
Athletics.
Santa Barbara has not been
overpowering (his year. They

I show four wins of twelve games |
for their efforts. This will be the J
j first meeting of the two schools
J in basketball.
Stanford had a five-game win
ning streak going until the IJSC |
| game, but now shows a losing
skein of two. The Indians figure
j to halt it tonight, if they can con
j trol Tom Lee and Russ Banko. I
[These two represent almost the l
entire UCSB offense. The 6-3 Lee
has been threading the net for a
17.2 average. Banko is not far off i
at 15.5.
STANFORD BOASTS three men
in double figures, and therefore is |
not lacking in offensive strength.
J Forward Bob Bedell has been i
I pleasing Pavilion crowds with a i

14.(> average. Pie plunked in 30
against Washington.
Kent Hinckley has managed to
score 14 points a game while set
ting up the offense and confusing
the opponent's defense with "off
heat" passes. He gets his shot off
quickly and accurately.
Hay Kosanke has provided re
bounding strength to go along
with Clayton Raaka. On defense
he is a terror blocking shots with
a devastating fervor. lie boasts
a 10.6 average.
These three should be able to
contain the Gauchos, and this
weekend should produce two non
league wins in preparation for
nexi weekend, when the Indians
return to AAWU competition.
