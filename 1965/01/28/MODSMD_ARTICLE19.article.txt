## Hall Of Fame Gains Stature, Members 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Stanford has a healthy athletic tradition, and as a means of honor
ing the illustrious athletes who made it possible, the Stanford Hall of
Fame was inaugurated in 1954, under the sponsorship of the Palo
Alto Times and Ihe co-operation of the athletic department. At pres
ent, there are 115 Hall of Famers embracing nine sports.
GAMAGE INITIATES HALL OF FAME
Walt Carnage, the sports editor of the Palo Alto Times, is the
person primarily responsible for the establishment of the Hall oi
Fame. "Stanford is rich in tradition, and it should be shown to
promising high school players." He had noticed that San Jose had
one on a small scale, and decided that the system could be effectively
set up at Stanford. He examined the Halls of Fame in existence and
synthesized a structure that combined what he considered the ele
ments best suited for the purpose he had in mind.
The two things he most strove for in setting up the original char
ter were a fair selection process and an absence of commercialism.
Gamage was fortunate to procure the services of Lloyd McGovern,
who handles all the balloting chores. McGovern, described by Gamage
as a "thorough, walking computer when it comes to Stanford ath
letics" and as "the unofficial sports historian of Stanford," has had
a longtime interest in Stanford sports and has a near-complete col
lection of programs to document it.
DEPARTMENT BEHIND VENTURE
Since its inception, Stanford's athletic department has stood
solidly behind the Times' venture. Chuck Taylor had this to say in
1951: "The Times should be congratulated for undertaking this proj
ect."
"The Hall of Fame should have a great impact in pointing up the
best in Stanford athletic traditions. I am hopeful that this will be the
start in setting aside a room at the university where the pictures and
trophies of Stanford's great athletes can be displayed."
His attitude toward the Hall of Fame has not changed in that time.
At present, outside the coaches' offices in the athletic department
office, there are pictures of many of the Hall of Famers. Taylor said
that certain sections of the new Pavilion will be devoted to Hall of
Fame displays.
He is especially looking forward to the building of a new office
where there will be a separate room for Hall of Fame exhibitions.
"The exhibition area has to be a prominent place where the most
people pass by during the year. We want it to be something unique
and attractive."
THIRTY-FOUR C HARTER MEMBERS
At the start, 31 athletes were honored as charter members of the
Hall of Fame. As with each annual selection, they were chosen by
ballot of the selection committee, which currently has 50 members.
All committee members have been close to the Stanford athletic
scene for the last 20 years or more and are knowledgeable of the ath
letes who have played during this time.
Every year since 1954, two players have been added to the foot
ball Hall of Fame and one in track, baseball, basketball, swimming,
tennis, and golf. Besides the seven sports which have annual addi
tions, outstanding performers in other sports are periodically added
on recommendation. Crew currently has two Hall of Famers and fenc
ing one. Each recipient of the honor receives a certificate from the
athletic department.
Carnage indicated that the balloting may take place biannually
when enough time has been allowed to absorb athletes of early years
into the Hall of Fame. The only eligibility requirement is that an
athlete has been out of school for at least one year.
PRESSURE A COMPLIMENT
Gamage considers the project he initiated to be an unqualified
success. Players admitted to the Hall of Fame have written him that
such an honor, received after competition is over, means more than
the awards received during playing days.
He has received pressure to put certain players on the ballot
from overenthusiastie alumni and relatives and teammates of former
athletes. But, he say, "Pressure is a compliment. It shows that the
Hall of Fame has achieved stature."
The Hall of Fame has been set aside for athletes who participated
after the First World War. It was felt lhat there were not enough
qualified people to choose athletes who played previously to 1919.
However, such an interesl was shown in setting up an "old timers"
category that in 1962 a large group of Stanford athletes who played
from 1892 to 1919 joined the Hall of Fame. A committee did extensive
research for several years to select bona fide staus.

All committee members have been close to the Stanford athletic
scene for the last 20 years or more and are knowledgeable of the ath
letes who have played during this time.
Every year since 1954, two players have been added to the foot
ball Hall of Fame and one in track, baseball, basketball, swimming,
tennis, and golf. Besides the seven sports which have annual addi
tions, outstanding performers in other sports are periodically added
on recommendation. Crew currently has two Hall of Famers and fenc
ing one. Each recipient of the honor receives a certificate from the
athletic department.
Carnage indicated that the balloting may take place biannually
when enough time has been allowed to absorb athletes of early years
into the Hall of Fame. The only eligibility requirement is that an
athlete has been out of school for at least one year.
PRESSURE A COMPLIMENT
Gamage considers the project he initiated to be an unqualified
success. Players admitted to the Hall of Fame have written him that
such an honor, received after competition is over, means more than
the awards received during playing days.
He has received pressure to put certain players on the ballot
from overenthusiastie alumni and relatives and teammates of former
athletes. But, he say, "Pressure is a compliment. It shows that the
Hall of Fame has achieved stature."
The Hall of Fame has been set aside for athletes who participated
after the First World War. It was felt lhat there were not enough
qualified people to choose athletes who played previously to 1919.
However, such an interesl was shown in setting up an "old timers"
category that in 1962 a large group of Stanford athletes who played
from 1892 to 1919 joined the Hall of Fame. A committee did extensive
research for several years to select bona fide staus.
Stanford has a healthy athletic tradition, and as a means of honor
ing the illustrious athletes who made it possible, the Stanford Hall of
Fame was inaugurated in 1954, under the sponsorship of the Palo
Alto Times and Ihe co-operation of the athletic department. At pres
ent, there are 115 Hall of Famers embracing nine sports.
GAMAGE INITIATES HALL OF FAME
Walt Carnage, the sports editor of the Palo Alto Times, is the
person primarily responsible for the establishment of the Hall oi
Fame. "Stanford is rich in tradition, and it should be shown to
promising high school players." He had noticed that San Jose had
one on a small scale, and decided that the system could be effectively
set up at Stanford. He examined the Halls of Fame in existence and
synthesized a structure that combined what he considered the ele
ments best suited for the purpose he had in mind.
The two things he most strove for in setting up the original char
ter were a fair selection process and an absence of commercialism.
Gamage was fortunate to procure the services of Lloyd McGovern,
who handles all the balloting chores. McGovern, described by Gamage
as a "thorough, walking computer when it comes to Stanford ath
letics" and as "the unofficial sports historian of Stanford," has had
a longtime interest in Stanford sports and has a near-complete col
lection of programs to document it.
DEPARTMENT BEHIND VENTURE
Since its inception, Stanford's athletic department has stood
solidly behind the Times' venture. Chuck Taylor had this to say in
1951: "The Times should be congratulated for undertaking this proj
ect."
"The Hall of Fame should have a great impact in pointing up the
best in Stanford athletic traditions. I am hopeful that this will be the
start in setting aside a room at the university where the pictures and
trophies of Stanford's great athletes can be displayed."
His attitude toward the Hall of Fame has not changed in that time.
At present, outside the coaches' offices in the athletic department
office, there are pictures of many of the Hall of Famers. Taylor said
that certain sections of the new Pavilion will be devoted to Hall of
Fame displays.
He is especially looking forward to the building of a new office
where there will be a separate room for Hall of Fame exhibitions.
"The exhibition area has to be a prominent place where the most
people pass by during the year. We want it to be something unique
and attractive."
THIRTY-FOUR C HARTER MEMBERS
At the start, 31 athletes were honored as charter members of the
Hall of Fame. As with each annual selection, they were chosen by
ballot of the selection committee, which currently has 50 members.
