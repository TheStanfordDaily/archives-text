# The 						Housing Dilemma
## 
### 
The results of the Stanford Poll published on
page one may be surprising to some, but its most
startling aspect is the degree to which it confirms
suspicions (and fears) of many student leaders
and administrators. In general the results provide
little reason for either group to rest on its
laurels.
For example, by far the majority of Stanford
students do not think the University acts to too
great an extent in loco parentis. On the other
hand, over half of the women, to whom the
most rigorous social regulations apply, think it
does. There is obviously need for reform, but
anti-regulations activists may have difficult)' get
ting extreme changes with only minimal student
support.
On the question of "depersonalization," nearly
two-thirds of the students do not feel ovcrh
"alienated from the university, a fact which may
disappoint the Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee. But the problt in does exist for a large minor
itv, and the University administration should
keep that in mind.
The most amazing statistic in the poll and the
one that should give the administration greatest
pause is the one which shows that over half of
Stanford women would move off campus il tlie\
were allowed to and that a fourth of the on
campus men would do so if they had the means
(transportation, etc.).
It has been clear for some time that Univer
sity housing, with its lack of privacy, bad food,
and cold hallways, is not able to compete satis
factorily with comparably-priced Palo Mto apart
ments with their heated pools, carpeting, and
freedom from restrictions.
With the immense dissatisfaction with dormi
tory living, the University has already been
forced to run efficiency surveys in order to pre
vent a rise in the room and board rates for last
fall. Furthermore, the knowledge of this latent
revolt against on-campus housing may have been
part of the motivation for the recent improve
ments of lounges and recreation rooms.
Still, there is a long wav to <40 in bringing on

campus facilities to a competitive level with ofT
eampus facilities, or even, for that matter, with
the comparatively luxurious clusters. Women's
housing, in particular, will take millions of dol
lars to renovate adequately.
This housing problem raises the question of
when Stanford will achieve the status its trustees
desire, that of a "residence university," at least
for more than just its freshmen, who probably
benefit greatly from the on-campus living experi
ence. Apart from the question of whether the
forced residence university is deirable, a more
complex matter which must be examined else
where, it is obvious that such a system is not
feasible for many years to come.
Meanwhile Stanford w omen arc being lorced
to stay on campus (while the men are not), even
w hen they arc over 21 or can get parents per
mission to move oil campus.
This situation is, we think, regrettable. In the
first place, there is no rationale other than the
absurd arguments for an extreme in loco parentis
policy for keeping the women on campus. Sec
ondly, if those who wished to were allowed to
move oil, more women could be admitted to the
University, thereby reducing the infamous men
women ratio.
It is time that the current University housing
policy come to grips with the fact that it is im
possible to provide competitive or realh ade
quate housing for many years and that as long
as a large percentage of the student body must
live off campus, women should be treated as
adults along with the men. Few other policy
changes could gain more w hole-hearted student
approval.
