# Editor, The Daily
## No 'Revolution Of Fairness' At Daily 
### 
Dear Sir:
As a former editor of The Daily
I am compelled to comment on
Mr. Bonine's column of Jan. 27 in
vvhieh ho claims that The Daily
recently has undergone a "revolu
tion." Let us begin by correcting
some of Mr. Bonine's more blatant
distortions which — to give him
the benefit of a doubt probably
are due to ignorance rather than
a conscious intent to deceive.
First, there was no "Establish
ment"—a self-perpetuating clique
—which controlled The Daily and
the ASSU, nor was the editorship
passed smoothly from one "in
sider" on the editorial board to
the next. For example, when I ran
for the office I was not even a
member of the editorial board. My
opponent, on the other hand, had
been on the board for quite a
while and certainly would qualify
as a member of Mr. Bonine's
"Establishment" — had there been
one.
Similarly, the person who suc
ceeded me as editor was a member
of the board but did not receive
its support. He won the election !
by appealing to tlie "lower staff," !
thus creating a precedent fori
Messrs. Moore's and Bonine's
"revolution" three years later.
But let us turn to more serious;
matters. Mr. Bonine asserts that
the most important aspect of his
"revolution" is a "new policy of
evenhandedness and fairness to
ward divergent points of view." j
For example, editor Moore a
Democrat recruited two conser
vative colunmists as well as two
liberal ones.
Had Mr. Bonine cared to go back
to examine my volume and those !
immediately preceding and suc
ceeding it he would have dis
covered that there is nothing revo
lutionary about this policy. Our
pages always were open to all
view points *a fact which the
"campus conservatives" often ac
knowledged!, we ran all "print-'
able letters"and never censored
their contents because we dis
agreed with them. One wonders
fjrom what source an objective and
serious journalist such as Mr. Bo
nine got his "information."
In short, it would appear that
Mi\ Bonine's column hardly is an
example of the "revolution of
fairness" about which he writes.
To repeat, I do not believe Mr. Bo
nine intentionally has distorted
the truth. He simply has not done
his homework - certainly some
thing any conscientious journalist
never fails to do.
Having tried to set things
straight, permit me to note that
in recent years there have been
some noticeable changes in The
Daily, but rather than involving
a "revolution of fairness" they in
volve a "revolution of style." The
Daily is more attractive, readable, !
and "professional" than in the
"old days." Particularly com- j
mendable is the improvement in |
news and feature writing. One of J
the leaders of this revolution is
editor-elect Nancy Stcffen and, j
thus, I look forward eagerly to
her volume which undoubtedly i
not only will perpetuate the "style ,
revolution 1 ' but also Mr. Bonine's j
"revolution of fairness" which be-,
gan long before he even knew The
Stanford Daily existed.
Sincerely.

• INo Establishment
Dear Sir:
As flattering as John Bonine's j
article was — and as much as I
relish the Ben Bella role — I must
confess: I was unaware that I
overthrew an Establishment last i
January. Frankly. I don't think I
such a monster exists on The j
Daily. The campaign, rather, to-1
cused on two different concepts !
of journalism.
I must also lake issue with j
John's assertion that past editors j
had been running one-sided news j
and editorial pages. I cannot think j
of any instances when a Daily edi- j
tor exercised the red pencil for i
purely partisan reasons. On the

contrary, The Daily has a long
and outstanding reputation for
presenting all sides.
And, I will readily agree w i th
John, I am certain the tradition
will continue under Nancy Stef
fen's volume.

• Destructive Criticism
Dear Sir:
The article in Wednesday's
Daily by Mr. Bonine shows an un
fortunately bitter and violent at
tempt to vindicate those aspects
of The Daily of which he ap
proves. However, vindication is
received not by diatribe, but by
history.
Each editor of The Daily must
define to himself what that pub
lication is and how it. is related to
the campus, and must then do
everything in his power to apply
The Daily to that definition. There
are — and should be honest dis
agreements about such definitions
and applications, and a continuing
dialogue about them has definite
worth as a developing process for
The Daily, and as a learning proc
ess for the people involved.
But such a discussion must be
both honest, and concerned with
the best interests of The Daily
itself, to ho of some value. Criti
cism which does not serve to im
prove or teach has no place here.
It is simply incorrect to claim,
as Mr. Bonine does, that improve
ments on The Daily have been
made only during the last two
volumes. Improvements are often
built on old improvements, and
each volume can < laim a set of
unique characteristics; some later
rejected, some retained. While the
changes of the last two volumes
should in no way be belittled,
they should also not be lifted out
of proportion. It should also be
remembered that opinions differ
over the merit of these "improve
ments" and they must stand the
test of time before their worth
can be rightfully proclaimed.
More importantly, Mr. Bonine's
criticisms only undercut Miss
Steffen's position as incoming edi
tor, rather than attempt to make
some constructive contribution to
The Daily's improvement in th e
future. It is simply not tenable to
claim that Miss Steffen's only
strength, ability or philosophy, is
based on the fact that a "covey of
freshmen and sophomores . . . are
not yet ripe."
Miss Steffen must be given the
opportunity to work with The
Daily, as she best defines it and
its place, within the extent of her
ability. Only then would it be
fair to criticize her. It is hoped
that she will take this criticism
openly, and without bitterness.

Past Editor of The Daily
(Vol. 148)
EDITOR'S NOTE: Mr. Bonine
didn't intend to "undercut" Miss
Steffen and had one of her Asso
ciate Editors read his column
before publication to help de
tray such an impression, hut he
apologizes for any such errone
ous impression. He will deal
with the points raised in these
letters tomorrow.
• Crying (Chamber
Dear Sir:
I attended the "flicks" at Me
morial Auditorium on Sunday
night and was surprised by the
entrance charge, a minimal 20
cents. Perhaps the rate could be
increased and the extra funds gen
erated could be used for an ur
ge nt 1 y required improvement,
namely ;i soundproof glass barrier
to isolate the balcony seats. We
know that this scheme is entirely
practical because many . movie
houses have glassed-in crying
chambers, where mothers can
bring their infants and small chil
dren to see the show.
This would be an ideal solution,
allowing those students who sit in
the balcony to scream and shout
to their heart's content wilhoul
disturbing the other moviegoers.
