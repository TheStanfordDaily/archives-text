# LASSU To Meet Tonight
## Campus Morality Proposal Offered 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
LASSU meets tonight at 7:30 in
Room 320 to consi (ie r what
Speaker Ed Shaw terms, "the
most important resolution yet
considered this year."
The resolution, proposed by Jay
Kadane, states that "in the area
of morality, nothing legal by Cali
fornia and Federal law shall be
judged a violation of the Funda
mental Standard. . .
It is based on a seldom-used
constitutional power of ihe Legis
lature, lhat it can "interpret the
Fundamental Standard.. .
If the resolution passes judicial
councils it will be instructed only
lo enforce cases within the limits
set by the Legislature.
In 1902 a similar action was
taken by the student body, which
by a 271.0 to 741 margin, approved
a referendum permitting students
over 21 to drink on campus. Since
then judicial councils have not
been able to enforce University
reg u 1 a t ions prohibiting on -
campus possession of liquor by
students over 21.
Shaw also pointed out recently
that increased graduate student
interest is already having effect.
About half the legislative pro
posals in the past two weeks have
been made by grad students, he
said.
