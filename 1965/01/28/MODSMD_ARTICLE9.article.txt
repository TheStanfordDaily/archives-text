# STANFORD POLL
## 'Lovelies' Prefer Off-Campus Life 
### AL HAMMOND 
Stanford women, if they
had their way, would flee
campus residences, a recent
Daily poll shows.
The poll, covering such
questions :is the depersonal
ization of the University, the
extent of University interfer
ence in students' private lives
iind on-campus versus off
campus housing, revealed
hoth satisfaction and dissatis
faction with the present state
of the university except in
the area of restrictions on
university housing.
. .A majority of women polled
expressed a desire to live off
campus, although present uni
versity regulations do not per
mit this (for unmarried, un
dergraduate women, among
whom this poll was con
ducted). .Most men polled, on
the other hand, preferred to
live on campus, even though
they are not required to by
the university (again, the poll
was limited to undergraduate
men).
In answer to the question
"Would you like to live off
campus (if it was allowed)?",
the returns showed:
Don't
Yes No Know
3len 33% -40% 20%
Women 54% 31% 15%
Total 11% 38% 20%
A breakdown by living
groups on the same question
showed decided differences of
opinion among the various
residences, with fraternities
and Florence Moore dollies
holding the extreme views.
Very few Greeks we r e
tempted by the prospects of
off-campus living, preferring
the cozy warmth of their
clusters. Stern men, too, al
though to a lesser extent, pre
ferred a communal, on-cam
pus life to a more isolated off
campus existence.
Flo Mo dollies, on the other
hand, are more anxious than
anyone else to flee their con
crete and glass palace, a n d
not far behind them are the
girls from Lag. Fating Club
men are strongly convinced
of the advantages of off-cam
pus life, (iirls on the row,
while not as convinced, still
felt more inclined to go than
to stay, if only the university
Would give permission.
In the freshmen houses of
Wilbur and Brainier opinion
was about evenly divided on
the advisihility of on-campus
versus off-campus liv ing, with
a large group as yet unde
cided. Kobie unfortunately
could not be reached to ascer
tain the views of the lovelies
who live there, due to a pro
tective forest of deans a n <1
sponsors.

The breakdown by resi
dences to the question
"Would you like to live off
campus?" is as follows:
Don't
Yes No Know
Frat 22% 60% 18%
Stern 26% 45% 29%
Clubs 50% 29% 21%
Wilbur 36% 38 % 26%
Kow 46% 41% 13%
Fag 5 2"/o 33% 15%
Flo-Mo 68% 23% 9%
Brainier 36% 32% 32%
In answer to the question
"What is the most attractive
feature to you of off-campus
living?", better living condi
tions and freedom from re
strictions were most often
mentioned.
About thirty per cent of the
men answering the poll
picked better living conditions
as the major attraction,
twenty per cent picked free
dom from restrictions, and
eighteen per cent picked
greater privacy. For over
thirty per cent of the, women
[>olled, the main attraction is
the freedom from restric
tions, with better living condi
tions a secondary considera
tion (twenty per cent).
When asked "What is the
main reason for remaining on
campus?", thirty-five per
cent felt that closeness to
campus is the major reason.
Other major reasons were the
enjoyment of group living
and the lack of transporta
tion. Few people felt that a
better social life or better
study conditions were major
attractions of on-campus liv
ing.
Men do not feel that the
university en c ro a <â€¢ h s too
much on their private lives,
hut a majority of the women
do feel that there is too much
interference in personal af
fairs. In answer to the ques
tion "Do you feel that Stan
ford interferes too much with
tlx' private lives of students,
that it acts to too great an
extent 'in loco parentis'?",
th e following percentages
were obtained:
No
Yes No Opin.
Men 33% 58% 9%
Women 53% 44% 7%
Total 40% 53% 8%
A smaller percentage (thir
ty percent) felt that Stanford
had become 100 depersonal
ized. Almost sixty percent ex
pressed the opposite view,
that Stanford was not too de
personalized.
The poll, which was e oil
dueled among undergraduate
and (with the exception of
some eating club member)
resident students, was admin
istered to 432 students repre
senting equal percentages of
all classes.
