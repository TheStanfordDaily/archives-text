| The Wisdom
Of This World
Man's age-old search for truth and quest for understanding has built our
great present-day universities, where the learning of the centuries is compiled,
distilled, gleaned, and sifted. Countless lives and brilliant minds have been
invested in this advancement of knowledge, for most of the world believes that
human wisdom and knowledge are the keys to future peace and happiness.
In a single sweeping statement the Bible proclaims, "The wisdom of this world
is foolishness to God" (I Corinthinians 3:19). Centuries of study and years of
research have not brought the answer to human mortality, to the problem of
evil, and an end to war. Instead, our pressure cooker world is more turbulent
and precariously situated than ever before. While God permits man to study
and explore His universe, and it is He who supplies the insights and break
throughs of progress so that His plans might be worked out, the natural man,
no matter how gifted or brilliant can not understand the wisdom of God unless
he is spiritually born. Spiritual birth is the most important experience a man
can have, for what shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose
his own soul? ' (Mark 8:36).
No portion of Holy Scripture is more relevant to the intellectual and well
educated man today than Paul's words on the wisdom of htis world:
. . . the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but
to us who are being saved, it is the'power of God. For it is written, I will j
destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the cleverness of the clever I will thwart.' 1
Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age?
Has not God made foolish the wisdom of ttys world? For since, in the wisdom !
of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through j
the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs i
and the Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block
to Jews and folly to the Gentiles, but to those who are called, both Jews and j
Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. For the foolishness
of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men ... !
Yet among the mature (i.e., Christians) we do impart wisdom, although it j
is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed j
to pass away. But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God
decreed before the ages for our glorification. None of the rulers of this age
understood this, for if they had they would not have crucified the Lord of i
glory'' (I Corinthinians 1:18-25, 2:6-8).
Don't exclude yourself and be left in the dark. Your acceptance of Jesus
Christ will bring you God s wisdom and enlightenment.
