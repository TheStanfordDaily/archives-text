"Soviet college students will never know
Nikita Khrushchev was premier if they tie
pencl on a Soviet history textbook authorized
six weeks after his ouster. It mentions only
his lesser .jobs."
—The Wall Street Journal
Filtered history for Soviet children did not
begin with Nikita Khrushchev. Herbert Hoover
Iras undergone a slow change from the sa\ior of
millons to a murderer of smlar proportons.
A RESOLUTION of the Council of People's
Commissars ( pictured) paid tribute to Hoover on
July 10, 1923. It reads in part:
". . . owiirg to the boundless and entirely un
selfish eorts of the American Relief Administra
tion, millions of people of all ages were saved
from death, and entire localities, including many
towns, escaped a threatening fearful calamity."
The Council expressed for the people of Russia
•'before the whole world to this organization, to its
leader - Mr. Herbert Hoover . . . the most deeply
felt sentiments of gratitude . . ."
YEARS LATER, the "Soviet Great Encyclope
dia" had this to say about the A.R.A.:
"Founded in the USA in 1919, with the purpose
of fighting against the revolutionary movement
and to secure the economic and -political position
of American imperialism in the countries which
suffered in the 1914-1918 World War, under pro
tension of relieving the food situation . . ."
When Herbert Hoover was not feeding the
hungry, he was collecting historical records.
Crossing the Nor th Sea in 1914, he was impressed
by an account of difficulties involved in the study
of the French Revolution.

Learning that the contemporary documents of
that upheaval had largely disappeared, he resolved
that such records should not be lost in the great
conflict then bursting out in Europe.
HIS OWN EFFORTS to collect material while
Director of the Commission for 1 Relief in Belgium
spread to Stanford in 1917. Mr. Hoover offered
President Ray Lyman Wilbur $50,000 "for an his
torical collect ion of the Great War."
Professor E. D. Adams of the History Depart
ment organized a group in Europe to begin amass
ing materials. The timing was perfect irr 1917, the
opportunities unique.
Dr. Adams was later to record, "I believe I was
the only unattached American professor of his
tory, then in Paris, not engaged in making history
as an agent of the Peace Conference.
"IT WAS POSSIBLE to go anywhere, ask any
question I wished and, not being restricted by any
sense of official responsibility, it was possible to
make some unusual contacts and to receive some
unusual confidences."
Under Adams were several capable historians,
among them Frank Golder, whose travels ro East
ern Europe produced extremely useful documents,
and Ralph H. Lutz.
Dr. Lutz became Director of tire Hoover Insti
tution in 1925, remained through the construction
of Hoover Tower and until 1944. Now Director
Emeritus, he is 76.
THE AMERICAN ARMED FORCES released
Lutz, then in Europe, to search for documents for
the "Hoover War Library."
"I was still in uniform," he recalls. "I wouldn't
have gotten anywhere if I had rrot been in uni
form." His search took him to Germany, Poland,
Czecho-Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Bui
garia. Italy and Switzerland.

It a librarian's life could ever be considered
dull, it would never be true of his suppliers. Dr.
Lutz cites one instance: "1 went down the Danube
with the British admiral's permission on the royal
yacht of the Prince Regent of Yugoslavia." The
cruise resulted in some very valuable collections
obtained in Belgrade.
Ills COLLECTION took Lutz to many new
countries, such as Bulgaria. "The young king was
inlcrested in America, and would like to have
come over here . . . which 1 thought was a good
idea considering the precariousness of his posi
tion."
Greatest contributions to the strength of the
library, according to Lutz, were Adams and Hoo
ver. "To no one except the founder does the Insti
tution owe so much as to Dr. E. D. Adams, the
first Director."
Hoover's contribution, above the idea and fi
nancing, was considerable. "The most valuable
asset we had was The Chief's name."
The "Hoover War Library" soon outgrew both
its $30,000 founding grant and temporary quarters
in the main library. It began to occupy two floors
of stacks, and the present Engineering library was
its reading room.
AFTER SEVERAL name changes and a land
mark building, The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution, and Peace is again outgrowing its ac
commodations.
Mr. Hoover, speaking at the dedication of Hoo
ver Tower, set forth his ideas of how its great re
sources should be used:
"The purpose of this Institution is to promote
peace. Its records stand as a challenge to those
who promote war. They should attract those who
search for peace."


TWO FACES OF HOOVER—Soviet proclamation lauds the relief
work of Herbert Hoover's American Relief Administration. So
viet history, as it was later rewritten, found Hoover to be the pawn
of imperialism and spying.
