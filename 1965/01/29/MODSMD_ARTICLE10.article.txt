ean speeches were the opening
speech by Richard 111, Claudius's
soliloquy in "Hamlet" in which
the king realizes his guilt, and the
lines in "Macbeth" following Ban

Both latter passages mention
bloody hands. "Did Lincoln haw
bI oo d y hands?" Fehrenbacher
asked.

caused, a great national tragedy,"
lie said. Mis love of Shakespear
ean tragedy may be indirect evi
dence of a personal feeling of
