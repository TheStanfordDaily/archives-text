# Bike Citations Put Into Effect
## 
### 
Due to continued recklessness
on the part of cyclists on the
Stanford campus, Chief Davis of
the Stanford Police Department
has decided to put into effect the
issuance of citations to negligent
bicycle riders.
In this new policy the following
rules will be strictly enforced:
(1) No bicycle riding under the
archives of the Quad.
(2) All bicycle riders must stop
at stop signs.
(3) No riding at night without
both front headlight and a rear
red reflector.
(41 No riding on Palm Drive
or on Galvez Street except on the
bicycle paths provided on either
side of both roads.
"We don't want to do this,"
said Chief Davis, "but we are
afraid we might lose a student if
we don't." He explained careless
ness of cyclists had resulted in
many minor accidents during the
past few weeks and he hoped the
citations would reawaken cyclists
and reduce mishaps.
Chief Davis also wanted to ex
tend his appreciation to those
cyclists who have shown marked
improvement in their road man
ners since the appearance of the
last article concerning haphazard
bicycle riders in The Daily.
