# 'Mary Poppins' Best Seen With Wide-Eyed Innocence
## 
### JOHN THAYER Drama Critic 
To enjoy "Mary Poppins" prop
j erly one ought to approach it
I with a sort of wide-eyed, childlike
i innocence, all critical faculties
suspended. Unfortunately, S I a n
ford, in its peculiar position as a
university on the brink of great
ness, painstakingly producing
| well-oiled, viselike intellects year
! after year, has tended to de-em
phasize this particular approach
to reality.
In a word, Stanford is "hooked"
on intellect. However, like cigar
ettes and alcohol, intellect, too,
can be given up; all it takes is a
little will-power. And the kid in
j you ( there must be one some
| where) will love it.
For "Poppins" is a re-working of
j the immortal ingredients of "Pe
j ter Pan" grumpy father, talking
| dog, and all. In this case, Peter
j and Tinkerbell are wrapped up in
one loving and lovable package,
j namely, Julie Andrews. She sings
i beautifully, acts equally well, and
i will probuby win an Oscar for it,

thus (and rightly) decisively
squelching the producers of a cer
tain other film which will forever
remain nameless.
In her magical highjinks she is
assisted by Dick Van Dyke, who
is extremely athletic and deter
minedly cheerful throughout, as
if his calisthenics could save the
picture from the veritable bog it
finds itself in more than once.
They can't, and neither can he;
but neither can Julie, for that
matter, which only demonstrates
that an inferior scenario over
comes all. To Walt Disney's cred
it, however, the film's partial ani
mation, apparently quite a techni
cal feat, is an equally great visual
success, especially the penguins.
Actually, the best description of
the movie is a word Julie An
drews says should be used when
one can't think of anything else to
say — the word being supercali
something-or-other. It's probably
impossible to spell, and certainly
impossible to pronounce (for all
except a talented few), but it fits.
"Mary Poppins" is definitely su
per, etc., etc., etc.

j and Tinkerbell are wrapped up in
one loving and lovable package,
j namely, Julie Andrews. She sings
i beautifully, acts equally well, and
i will probuby win an Oscar for it,

thus (and rightly) decisively
squelching the producers of a cer
tain other film which will forever
remain nameless.
In her magical highjinks she is
assisted by Dick Van Dyke, who
is extremely athletic and deter
minedly cheerful throughout, as
if his calisthenics could save the
picture from the veritable bog it
finds itself in more than once.
They can't, and neither can he;
but neither can Julie, for that
matter, which only demonstrates
that an inferior scenario over
comes all. To Walt Disney's cred
it, however, the film's partial ani
mation, apparently quite a techni
cal feat, is an equally great visual
success, especially the penguins.
Actually, the best description of
the movie is a word Julie An
drews says should be used when
one can't think of anything else to
say — the word being supercali
something-or-other. It's probably
impossible to spell, and certainly
impossible to pronounce (for all
except a talented few), but it fits.
"Mary Poppins" is definitely su
per, etc., etc., etc.
