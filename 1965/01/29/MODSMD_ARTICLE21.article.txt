## Ella 'Better Than Ever' At Hyatt Music Theatre 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Entertainment Editor 
Recently many people? have
been picking any one ol' the many
excellent young singers as the
successor to Ella Fitzgerald. All
these people, however, are ignor
ing one basic point: Ella is still
very much around.
Not only is she still around,
but—as she proved at her Hyatt
Music Theatre opening Tuesday
—she is better than ever.
Dancing a few impromptu steps
while the band plays between
verses, clapping her hands to the
music, toying with a pink scarf
or the microphone cord: whatever
she does, Ella does with style.
In singing it is her style
simply to respect the music of
each song without sacrificing the
meaning of the lyrics to bravura
musical tricks that makes her
so great.
Joined By Others
However, Ella is not alone on
the stage; she is joined by other
artists. Although she is the star
she doesn't even appear until after
the intermission.
Leading off the show is th e
i Oscar Peterson Trio, a group that
i is superb on numbers ranging
j from"The Days of Wine And
I Roses" to "Satin Doll." Especially
j outstanding is the piano-bass duet
j by Peterson and Ray Brown on
j "Someone To Watch Over Me."
Nelson Riddle and his band are
; next. They have a very smooth—
j but almost totally uninteresting
—sound, and only rarely do they
seem to come alive. Peterson ana
•' his group join them at the end
I of the first act for a pair of num
bers: a lovely song called "Night
j ingale" — composed by Peterson
—and a novel Peterson arrange
ment of "Someday My Prince
Will Come."
Ella Incomparable
After the intermission Ella
comes on, and, from the opening
of her first song until she winds
up almost an hour later, she
proves that she is incomparable.
She sings with Riddle's band
I and she sings with the Roy Eld

ridge Quartet; she sings fast and
she sings slow.
She sings "You Do Something
To Me" and the audience wo u 1 d
gladly stay all night letting her do
that voodoo that she does so well.
She sings "Them There Eyes" and
goes through the fantastic "oobe
doo" scat cadenzas that are her
own special domain. She sings
"People" and proves that there
is no song she can not make uni
quely her own.
She sings and she is an artist
and entertainer. She sings and she
is great.
