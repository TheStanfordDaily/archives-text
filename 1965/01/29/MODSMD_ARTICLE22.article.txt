## 
###

vade the nort bland today in quest
of a strong push-off in conference
competition. The Indians meet Or
egon and Oregon State today in a
double - dual meet and tomorrow
swim still further north to take on

The Indians will need all they
can get to bag the elusive Oregon
Ducks. Led by NCAA finalist Dick

Tim Roark and Audie Meinhart.
Stanford's varsity, already
strained for lack of depth, faces a
great challenge to bring winning
performances out of a limited 12-

vanto, Mike Doscher, Dave Calfee,
and Jim Laney hope to provide the
extra push necessary to pull the
Indians into the winning column.
Stanford, primarily by making
its first trip north, meets more con

ference opponents this season than
any other team in the AAWU. The
results of this weekend's competi
tion should provide a good indica
tion of the conference strength.
THE PAPOOSIOS rest this week
end for the meet next Saturday
with the Santa Clara Swim Club.
The frosh have torn apart the En
cina pool record boards already
this season, and they have ample
time to go.
