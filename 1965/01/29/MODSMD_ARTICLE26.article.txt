# Matmen Face Cal Poly, Fresno
## 
### JACK GASKILL 
Two strong opponents loom on
the weekend horizon for the Stan
ford wrestling squad as ihey host
Cal Poly tonight at 7 p.m. in the
Pavilion, and then journey 1o
Fresno on Saturday to tangle
with State in an afternoon match.
Corky Vance and A 1 Gonzales
take on the toughest assignments
as they will both square off
against defending coast cham
pions. Vance will meet Cal Poly's
"Terrible" Teem, the 130-lb.
champ, in the 147-lb. match, and
Gonzales faces Fresno State's
Hurricane Hansen, the 115-lb.

.champ, in a 123-lb. duel.
COACH BILL LELANIJ feels
: his team can offer strong chal
| lenges in both matches. He did,
! however, point out that Cal Poly
j and Fresno State finished third
I and fourth respectively in last
year's Pacific Coast Intercolle-
I giate Tournament, behind Oregon
! State and Oregon.
The team was dealt another
blow when 137-pounder Dick An
derson dropped wrestling. This
leaves Stanford without competi
tors in either the 130- or the 137-
lb. weight classes, and both
matches must be forfeited.

The team will consist of A 1 Gon
zales (123), Corky Vance <147),
Bob Garcia (157), rank Pratt or
Steve Sehaum (167), Mike Davi
son (177), and undefeated Bruce
Willielm (unlimited).
GONZALKS, Garcia, and Pratt
all came up with falls in last
week's 31-5 rout of Santa Clara,
and Coach Leland is counting
heavily on them in this week's
encounters.
The frosh wrestlers, led by 157-
11). Bill Vogelpohl, host san Fer
nando Valley State College Satur
day at 10 a.m. in the Pavilion.
Vogelpohl pinned his opponent
in Ihe first period in an exhibition
match last week against Santa
Clara.
