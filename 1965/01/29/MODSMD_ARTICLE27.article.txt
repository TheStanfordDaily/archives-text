Union and dictated a message of
mock alarm and sarcasm: "Dear
My-Son-the-Letter-Writer. Note
salutation. Have alerted Ameri
can Red Cross. Please advise."
I told the operator to send it at
night-letter rates and have it de
livered in the morning. After a
brief pause the operator said,

Evening Post

salutation. Have alerted Ameri
can Red Cross. Please advise."
I told the operator to send it at
night-letter rates and have it de
