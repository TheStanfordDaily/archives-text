# STANFORD, A BOXING OUTPOST
## College Boxing Viewed 
### Tom Edison 
• S t a n 112 or d ' s veteran boxing
coach, Flay Lunny, who has seen
college and professional boxing
pass through many trends in
| thirty years of connection with
i the sport, is currently holding one
! of the reins guiding the future of
| college boxing. This philosophy
is that students should be given
the opportunity to learn how to
I box if they desire it.
Stanford's interest in boxing
j may be all that is saving college
| boxing from passing into com
i plete oblivion.
MANY GONE, FOUR LEFT
Presently, only Stanford, Cali-
I fornia, Nevada, and Chico State
1 participate in intercollegiate box
ing. Should one of these schools
choose to drop out of Ihe so
called California Collegiate Box
ing Conference, there would be
I slim hope of the other schools
J continuing to compete.
Ten years ago, competition in
boxing was on the national level.
Competing universities had expe
rienced coaches, vast recruiting
programs, and excellent facilities.
The interest placed in boxing
created problems, especially in
the area of recruiting. Schools
were recruiting boys whose only
purpose in college was to box in
order to eventually get a crack at
"the big time," as happens now
occasionally in football.
With this type of program, the
caliber of college boxing was ex
cellent. Competition was intense,
and interest was high.
A boxing fatality in 1960 in an
Eastern collegiate tournament
changed the mood enormously.

I Colleges throughout the nation re-
I examined their boxing programs
, and steadily dropped boxing. The
situation became so bad that
I within a year only the four pres
ent schools were participating in
any type of competitive boxing
i conference.
BOXING UPKURGIC
Despite the obvious dim outlook
for college boxing, interest at
Stanford has significantly risen in
the last year. Coach Lunny indi
cated that his elementary boxing
classes have had greater enroll
ments. These classes are the only
opportunity for him 10 discover
prospective varsity performers.
Thus, the caliber of his varsity
teams has also been improving. A
few years ago, Stanford could
barely put together a complete
team as interest and participation
were at a minimum.
A greater part of the student
body now shows an interest in
boxing. A packed house witnessed
the last match against California.
Lunny said three more bleachers
will be installed for the final
home match of the season tomor
row against the University of Ne
vada.
Athletic Director Chuck Taylor
recalls that during the 1940's box
ing at Stanford possibly held as
much interest for fans as did foot
ball. During those years, the In
dians had such fine boxers as Vic
Lindskog, who was also a center
on the 1940 Rose Bowl team, and
Bill Ward. Interest was so high
that many exhibition matches
were held, one of which included
Max Baer.
STRONG BOXING TRADITION
Under such great coaches as
Harry Maloney, who was boxing
coach for twenty-two years and
served Stanford athletics for forty
years, Myron Schall, Clayton
Frye, and now Ray Lunny, who
has been boxing coach since 1918,
I Stanford boxers compiled excel
j lent records. They have gained
i many sectional and regional indi
vidual and team honors in the
past. Boxers Bob Lyte and Eric
Pedley have both been admitted
to the Stanford Hall of Fame.
Lunny ironically recalls the
fateful year 19H0 as being his
most successful season. That
year, Ed Rothman, a 174-pounder
less than 6 ft., fighting in the
heavyweight division, lost in the
NCAA finals and Bruce Bellows,
brother of one of Stanford's cur

rent boxers, reached the semi-fi
nals.
Western boxing was widely re
spected. The giants of college
i boxing at this time included Wis
I consin, San Jose State, Idaho
: State, and Washington State. San
Jose gained the national cham
pionship several years.
Stanford boxing was in a pre
carious position when other uni
versities dropped the sport at the
intercollegiate level. Taylor re
calls thai beginning in the fifties
the problem of whether to con
tinue or drop boxing intercolle
: giately has come up from time to
time.
Many think that boxing is not
the type of sport that colleges
l should handle because of the ever
! present possibility of accidents.
However, the administration feels
| that under proper supervision it
I is as safe as or perhaps safer
j than other contact sports. The
| real problem is the need for more
I competition.
FOR PROTECTION
The philosophy adopted by Tay
| lor and other college boxing sup
| porters is that boxing gives an
| alhlete the opportunity not only
! to receive maximum physical con
! ditioning but also lo learn to pro
; tcct himself.
In possibly no other sport ex
cept wrestling is an athlete given
such an opportunity to perform
by himself and to feel the sense
of pride that comes with demon
•strating one's athletic prowess
and withstanding onslaughts of
the opponent. He learns how to
; adjust to situations in which his
j physical well - being is being
threatened.
With many sound philosophies
| guiding it presently and with an
; illustrious past, Stanford boxing
| should have many more years of
existence as a sport that will de
velop fine athletes and produce
1 able-bodied men.
