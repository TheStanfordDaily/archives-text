						University On The Move
## 
### 
As Volume 146 of The Daily ends with this
issue, the academic' year approaches the halfway
mark. With the perspective gained in the past
quarter and a half, now is an appropriate time,
we think, to pause and take stock of the state of
the I nivcrsity.
In our contact with the operations of the Uni
versit\ and talks with those in the upper echelons
ol the administration, we have been very favor
ably impressed, hoth with the quality of many
administrators and particularly with their eager
ness to find solutions to student problems and to
get the advice of students before making impor
tant policy decisions,
Stanford, it is clear, is a University on the
move, a I'niversih with forward-looking leader
ship working at a fever pitch to improve on all
fronts the education Stanford offers.
The rapid growth in facilities and the Hurry of
construction on campus are merch a small part
of the progressive reforms being pushed. In
creases in the size and quality of faculty, efforts
to have graduate school professors teach more
courses in the undergraduate division, restructur
ing of the freshman English and Western Civili
zation programs, improvements in the cultural
activities ottered to students (with the increasing
role ol Tresidder Union )— all are indications of
this on-going concern of the administration with
re-evaluation and reform. The appointment last
year ol a Dean of I ndergraduate Education was
a milestone in this respect.
A number of student and facultv'-student com

mittees are now studying or formulating recom
mendations for changes in the student judicial
system, women's social regulations, religion, and
housing. Their activities and the encouraging
attitude of many administrators promise far
reaching changes in areas which have long been
sources of student discontent.
These studies are being made and attentively
heard because there exists a real responsiveness
on the part of the administration to students who,
acting in good faith and in a spirit of coopera
tion, advance constructive criticism of University
policies.
It would be most unfortunate if students with
reform proposals (and, lest we forget, there is
still much that needs reforming at Stanford)
failed to use existing channels to make their dis
content known. The avenues of communication
are open, and the administrators are, on the
whole, reasonable men willing to listen to and
act on student complaints. If these avenues are
not used, the chances for constructive reform—be
it in political rules or the Fundamental Standard
or in less controversial areas—could be seriously
jeopardized.
It is our sincere hope that the atmosphere of
cooperation which has prevailed within the Uni
versity thus far during the academic year will
continue, and that the calm dialogue between
groups who have essentially the same interests
will be further promoted.
Such, we feel, is the surest road toward an
ever-improving university.
