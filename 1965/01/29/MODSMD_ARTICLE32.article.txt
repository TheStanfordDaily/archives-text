# Editor, The Daily
## Antidisestablishmentarianism Versus 'The Daily Revolution' 
### 
Dear Sir:
The "notes and observations" of
John Bonine in Wednesday's Daily
are guilty of so many glaring j
weaknesses one hardly knows
which to attack first. His article'
is an example of the very "per
sonal crusades or vendettas" it
purports to attack. It suggests;
that the continuation of long
standing trends somehow consti
tutes a "revolution." And it at- i
tempts to intimidate an incoming i
editor who has yet to edit an
issue. However. I especially wish
to discuss another aspect of the
article, that which I believe to he
of the greatest importance for the
Stanford student community. Just
what "revolution" is Mr. Bonine
really talking about?
Mr. Naylor and the rest of our
present campus leadership came
on the scene just when we needed j
them most. They came after a
year in which those to whom Mr.
Bonine refers as the "establish-j
ment" had sparked student gov- i
eminent and Daily activity into
new areas. This new leadership j
came after a year in which we
students appeared to ho waking
u I) to the hypocrisy of our elders,
and the injustices they have per
petrated in the name of Christian
ity and democracy. They came
after a year in which Stanford j
students began to implement, I
sometimes at the risk of their
lives, what they had learned in the
classroom. And, above all. t hey
came after a year in which it was
harder than ever before for us to
continue living our narrow, self-,
centered and unconcerned lives.
After such a year, we looked ton
new leadership, one that we knew
would allow us to turn, once I
again, without hesitation or guilt,
to the task of pursuing our ma
terial success.
Mr. Bonine scolds the "establish
ment" because it tried to promote
its "partisan" views through The,
Daily. The implication is that the
present regime ;ilso has strongly-'
held views, but that, somehow, ii
submerged them in favor of ob
jectivity. What he fails to ac
knowledge is that the present
leadership has indeed promoted
its view point in the paper.
Sumo maj ask: if the viewpoint
<»112 The Dally leadership is being
promoted in its pages, why is this
not blatantly apparent? The an
swer is that the view is one of
apathy apathy toward the social

commitment the "establishment"
was so concerned to ignite. A n d.
unlike commitment, apathy is
anything but blatantly obvious.
The call to action has been re
placed by the call to discussion.
The view of such student activi
ties as those at Berkeley as mani
festations of a true dissatisfaction
with the injustices of the status
quo has been replaced by the view
from afar, which sees such activi
ties as social phenomena result
ing from sheer depersonalization
and economic backgrounds. The
philosophy of The Daily as partly
a means for getting students to
take critical looks at themselves
in light of their expressed beliefs
has been replaced by the philoso
phy of The Daily as a mere pre
senter of material. Technical im
provements have certainly been
made, but perhaps the paper has
lost a touch of its "humanity" in
the process.
If this has been a "revolution,"
it has been the kind this nation
underwent when it elected War
ren (I. Harding; not really a revo
lution, but a "return to normalcy."
The revolution is, hopefully, still
to come.

Dear Sir:
I had no expectation of arousing
the ire of former Daily editors, as
seems to have been the case with
my column praising the policies
of the last two editors.
Certainly it is an erroneous im
pression to feel that I was ex
pressing displeasure with the new
editor. I said, in fact:
"The new editor has announced
her satisfaction with practically
all of the changes.... [She] has
already taken several actions indi
cating that |putting out a serious
newspaper rather than using it as
a tool| will lie her goal t00.... The
revolution of fairness will likely
continue...." Evidently only Bill
Moore in yesterday's Daily saw
these bouquets.
Moore, editor last spring, ex*
pressed mild surprise at learning
lie had overthrown an Establish
ment, although the fact that his
candidacy was opposed by virtu
ally the entire editorial board
should have raised some questions
in hi*-' mind

"The campaign, rather, focused
on two different concepts of jour-|
jnalism," he suggests. Precisely j
my point.
The volume immediately pre
ceding Moore's used the news
pages for the promotion of the,
views and causes of the editor and
i even went so far as to print col-'
umns of pure, undisguised opin
, ion as "news" stories. < K.g., see
October 28, 1963.)
Barry Green berg, however, does
not agree with me on the past lack
!of fairness and objectivity. He
asserts that his editorial pages
"were always open to all view- :
! points." Here is what a careful
[examination of Mr. Greenberg's
i volume and each succeeding one
I reveals:
• Mr. Greenberg himself ran
| Walter Lippmann twice a week,
: his own editorials, and three reg
ular student liberal columnists.
i No regular conservative column
ists whatsoever —-national or stu
j dent — graced his pages, although
: he did print dissenting letters and
i occasional guest columns. This is
! anything but fairness and balance.
• In volumes since 1960 (eight
jin all), although student liberal]
, columnists were regular features'
on the editorial pages, no editor
iran regular student conservative I
j columnists until Bill Moore's]
[ revolutionary volume last year, i
iln two of the volumes — Dan j
Schwartz and Nils Wessell — no |
I regular student columnists at all
were run, but Walter Lippmann
, was.)
• Although Walter Lippmann
has been a Daily institution dur
ing all these years and volumes)
(and was usually printed twice ai
week, but as often as five times a i
J week under Wessell), not. until
! Robert Naylor's revolutionary vol
nmc this year was there any
regular national conservative col-1
umnist (Buckley) to balance the i
I page.
Surely the commendable policy
: of Editors Moore and Naylor in
presenting opinion in balanced
fashion and confining opinion to
the editorial page is no mere "rev
olution in style," as Mr. Green
berg claims. It is a "revolution of
fairness" something which my
antidisestablishmentarian friends
should applaud as loudly as I. It
is a proud foundation on which
| to build.

Dear Sir:
The "notes and observations" of
John Bonine in Wednesday's Daily
are guilty of so many glaring j
weaknesses one hardly knows
which to attack first. His article'
is an example of the very "per
sonal crusades or vendettas" it
purports to attack. It suggests;
that the continuation of long
standing trends somehow consti
tutes a "revolution." And it at- i
tempts to intimidate an incoming i
editor who has yet to edit an
issue. However. I especially wish
to discuss another aspect of the
article, that which I believe to he
of the greatest importance for the
Stanford student community. Just
what "revolution" is Mr. Bonine
really talking about?
Mr. Naylor and the rest of our
present campus leadership came
on the scene just when we needed j
them most. They came after a
year in which those to whom Mr.
Bonine refers as the "establish-j
ment" had sparked student gov- i
eminent and Daily activity into
new areas. This new leadership j
came after a year in which we
students appeared to ho waking
u I) to the hypocrisy of our elders,
and the injustices they have per
petrated in the name of Christian
ity and democracy. They came
after a year in which Stanford j
students began to implement, I
sometimes at the risk of their
lives, what they had learned in the
classroom. And, above all. t hey
came after a year in which it was
harder than ever before for us to
continue living our narrow, self-,
centered and unconcerned lives.
After such a year, we looked ton
new leadership, one that we knew
would allow us to turn, once I
again, without hesitation or guilt,
to the task of pursuing our ma
terial success.
Mr. Bonine scolds the "establish
ment" because it tried to promote
its "partisan" views through The,
Daily. The implication is that the
present regime ;ilso has strongly-'
held views, but that, somehow, ii
submerged them in favor of ob
jectivity. What he fails to ac
knowledge is that the present
leadership has indeed promoted
its view point in the paper.
Sumo maj ask: if the viewpoint
<»112 The Dally leadership is being
promoted in its pages, why is this
not blatantly apparent? The an
swer is that the view is one of
apathy apathy toward the social

commitment the "establishment"
was so concerned to ignite. A n d.
unlike commitment, apathy is
anything but blatantly obvious.
The call to action has been re
placed by the call to discussion.
The view of such student activi
ties as those at Berkeley as mani
festations of a true dissatisfaction
with the injustices of the status
quo has been replaced by the view
from afar, which sees such activi
ties as social phenomena result
ing from sheer depersonalization
and economic backgrounds. The
philosophy of The Daily as partly
a means for getting students to
take critical looks at themselves
in light of their expressed beliefs
has been replaced by the philoso
phy of The Daily as a mere pre
senter of material. Technical im
provements have certainly been
made, but perhaps the paper has
lost a touch of its "humanity" in
the process.
If this has been a "revolution,"
it has been the kind this nation
underwent when it elected War
ren (I. Harding; not really a revo
lution, but a "return to normalcy."
The revolution is, hopefully, still
to come.

its "partisan" views through The,

its view point in the paper.

promoted in its pages, why is this
not blatantly apparent? The an
swer is that the view is one of
apathy apathy toward the social

commitment the "establishment"
was so concerned to ignite. A n d.
unlike commitment, apathy is
anything but blatantly obvious.
The call to action has been re
placed by the call to discussion.
The view of such student activi
ties as those at Berkeley as mani
festations of a true dissatisfaction
with the injustices of the status

from afar, which sees such activi
ties as social phenomena result
ing from sheer depersonalization
and economic backgrounds. The
philosophy of The Daily as partly
a means for getting students to
take critical looks at themselves
in light of their expressed beliefs
has been replaced by the philoso
phy of The Daily as a mere pre
senter of material. Technical im
provements have certainly been
made, but perhaps the paper has
lost a touch of its "humanity" in
the process.
If this has been a "revolution,"
it has been the kind this nation

lution, but a "return to normalcy."

Dear Sir:
I had no expectation of arousing
the ire of former Daily editors, as
seems to have been the case with
my column praising the policies
of the last two editors.
Certainly it is an erroneous im
pression to feel that I was ex
pressing displeasure with the new
editor. I said, in fact:
"The new editor has announced
her satisfaction with practically
all of the changes.... [She] has
already taken several actions indi
cating that |putting out a serious
newspaper rather than using it as
a tool| will lie her goal t00.... The
revolution of fairness will likely
continue...." Evidently only Bill
Moore in yesterday's Daily saw
these bouquets.
Moore, editor last spring, ex*
pressed mild surprise at learning
lie had overthrown an Establish
ment, although the fact that his
candidacy was opposed by virtu
ally the entire editorial board
should have raised some questions
in hi*-' mind

"The campaign, rather, focused
on two different concepts of jour-|
jnalism," he suggests. Precisely j
my point.
The volume immediately pre
ceding Moore's used the news
pages for the promotion of the,
views and causes of the editor and
i even went so far as to print col-'
umns of pure, undisguised opin
, ion as "news" stories. < K.g., see
October 28, 1963.)
Barry Green berg, however, does
not agree with me on the past lack
!of fairness and objectivity. He
asserts that his editorial pages
"were always open to all view- :
! points." Here is what a careful
[examination of Mr. Greenberg's
i volume and each succeeding one
I reveals:
• Mr. Greenberg himself ran
| Walter Lippmann twice a week,
: his own editorials, and three reg
ular student liberal columnists.
i No regular conservative column
ists whatsoever —-national or stu
j dent — graced his pages, although
: he did print dissenting letters and
i occasional guest columns. This is
! anything but fairness and balance.
• In volumes since 1960 (eight
jin all), although student liberal]
, columnists were regular features'
on the editorial pages, no editor
iran regular student conservative I
j columnists until Bill Moore's]
[ revolutionary volume last year, i
iln two of the volumes — Dan j

I regular student columnists at all
were run, but Walter Lippmann

(and was usually printed twice ai

J week under Wessell), not. until
! Robert Naylor's revolutionary vol

Dear Sir:
The "notes and observations" of
John Bonine in Wednesday's Daily
are guilty of so many glaring j
weaknesses one hardly knows
which to attack first. His article'
is an example of the very "per
sonal crusades or vendettas" it
purports to attack. It suggests;
that the continuation of long
standing trends somehow consti
tutes a "revolution." And it at- i
tempts to intimidate an incoming i
editor who has yet to edit an
issue. However. I especially wish
to discuss another aspect of the
article, that which I believe to he
of the greatest importance for the
Stanford student community. Just
what "revolution" is Mr. Bonine
really talking about?
Mr. Naylor and the rest of our
present campus leadership came
on the scene just when we needed j
them most. They came after a
year in which those to whom Mr.
Bonine refers as the "establish-j
ment" had sparked student gov- i
eminent and Daily activity into
new areas. This new leadership j
came after a year in which we
students appeared to ho waking
u I) to the hypocrisy of our elders,
and the injustices they have per
petrated in the name of Christian
ity and democracy. They came
after a year in which Stanford j
students began to implement, I
sometimes at the risk of their
lives, what they had learned in the
classroom. And, above all. t hey
came after a year in which it was
harder than ever before for us to
continue living our narrow, self-,
centered and unconcerned lives.

Dear Sir:
The "notes and observations" of
John Bonine in Wednesday's Daily
are guilty of so many glaring j
weaknesses one hardly knows
which to attack first. His article'
is an example of the very "per
sonal crusades or vendettas" it
purports to attack. It suggests;
that the continuation of long
standing trends somehow consti
tutes a "revolution." And it at- i
tempts to intimidate an incoming i
editor who has yet to edit an
issue. However. I especially wish
to discuss another aspect of the
article, that which I believe to he
of the greatest importance for the
Stanford student community. Just
what "revolution" is Mr. Bonine
really talking about?
Mr. Naylor and the rest of our
present campus leadership came
on the scene just when we needed j
them most. They came after a
year in which those to whom Mr.
Bonine refers as the "establish-j
ment" had sparked student gov- i
eminent and Daily activity into
new areas. This new leadership j
came after a year in which we
students appeared to ho waking
u I) to the hypocrisy of our elders,
and the injustices they have per
petrated in the name of Christian
ity and democracy. They came
after a year in which Stanford j
students began to implement, I
sometimes at the risk of their
lives, what they had learned in the
classroom. And, above all. t hey
came after a year in which it was
harder than ever before for us to
continue living our narrow, self-,
centered and unconcerned lives.
After such a year, we looked ton
new leadership, one that we knew
would allow us to turn, once I
again, without hesitation or guilt,
to the task of pursuing our ma
terial success.
Mr. Bonine scolds the "establish
ment" because it tried to promote
its "partisan" views through The,
Daily. The implication is that the
present regime ;ilso has strongly-'
held views, but that, somehow, ii
submerged them in favor of ob
jectivity. What he fails to ac
knowledge is that the present
leadership has indeed promoted
its view point in the paper.
Sumo maj ask: if the viewpoint
<»112 The Dally leadership is being
promoted in its pages, why is this
not blatantly apparent? The an
swer is that the view is one of
apathy apathy toward the social

commitment the "establishment"
was so concerned to ignite. A n d.
unlike commitment, apathy is
anything but blatantly obvious.
The call to action has been re
placed by the call to discussion.
The view of such student activi
ties as those at Berkeley as mani
festations of a true dissatisfaction
with the injustices of the status
quo has been replaced by the view
from afar, which sees such activi
ties as social phenomena result
ing from sheer depersonalization
and economic backgrounds. The
philosophy of The Daily as partly
a means for getting students to
take critical looks at themselves
in light of their expressed beliefs
has been replaced by the philoso
phy of The Daily as a mere pre
senter of material. Technical im
provements have certainly been
made, but perhaps the paper has
lost a touch of its "humanity" in
the process.
If this has been a "revolution,"
it has been the kind this nation
underwent when it elected War
ren (I. Harding; not really a revo
lution, but a "return to normalcy."
The revolution is, hopefully, still
to come.
Sincerely,

Dear Sir:
I had no expectation of arousing
the ire of former Daily editors, as
seems to have been the case with
my column praising the policies
of the last two editors.
Certainly it is an erroneous im
pression to feel that I was ex
pressing displeasure with the new
editor. I said, in fact:
"The new editor has announced
her satisfaction with practically
all of the changes.... [She] has
already taken several actions indi
cating that |putting out a serious
newspaper rather than using it as
a tool| will lie her goal t00.... The
revolution of fairness will likely
continue...." Evidently only Bill
Moore in yesterday's Daily saw
these bouquets.
Moore, editor last spring, ex*
pressed mild surprise at learning
lie had overthrown an Establish
ment, although the fact that his
candidacy was opposed by virtu
ally the entire editorial board
should have raised some questions
in hi*-' mind

"The campaign, rather, focused
on two different concepts of jour-|
jnalism," he suggests. Precisely j
my point.
The volume immediately pre
ceding Moore's used the news
pages for the promotion of the,
views and causes of the editor and
i even went so far as to print col-'
umns of pure, undisguised opin
, ion as "news" stories. < K.g., see
October 28, 1963.)
Barry Green berg, however, does
not agree with me on the past lack
!of fairness and objectivity. He
asserts that his editorial pages
"were always open to all view- :
! points." Here is what a careful
[examination of Mr. Greenberg's
i volume and each succeeding one
I reveals:
• Mr. Greenberg himself ran
| Walter Lippmann twice a week,
: his own editorials, and three reg
ular student liberal columnists.
i No regular conservative column
ists whatsoever —-national or stu
j dent — graced his pages, although
: he did print dissenting letters and
i occasional guest columns. This is
! anything but fairness and balance.
• In volumes since 1960 (eight
jin all), although student liberal]
, columnists were regular features'
on the editorial pages, no editor
iran regular student conservative I
j columnists until Bill Moore's]
[ revolutionary volume last year, i
iln two of the volumes — Dan j
Schwartz and Nils Wessell — no |
I regular student columnists at all
were run, but Walter Lippmann
, was.)
• Although Walter Lippmann
has been a Daily institution dur
ing all these years and volumes)
(and was usually printed twice ai
week, but as often as five times a i
J week under Wessell), not. until
! Robert Naylor's revolutionary vol
nmc this year was there any
regular national conservative col-1
umnist (Buckley) to balance the i
I page.
Surely the commendable policy
: of Editors Moore and Naylor in
presenting opinion in balanced
fashion and confining opinion to
the editorial page is no mere "rev
olution in style," as Mr. Green
berg claims. It is a "revolution of
fairness" something which my
antidisestablishmentarian friends
should applaud as loudly as I. It
is a proud foundation on which
| to build.
