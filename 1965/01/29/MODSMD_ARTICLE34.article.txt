## Free Trade Is A Worthy Goal Of Kennedy Round 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
GENEVA — Delegates from all over the world are convening
here for what is called in the trade The Kennedy Hound.
A couple of years ago, the Common Market nations raised the
tariff against American chickens. In retaliation President Kennedy,
as authorized, and in effect exhorted bv the law to do, raised Amer-

ican tariffs against assorted Euro
pean products in an amount calcu
lated to more or less equal the
„ projected loss in exported Amer-
I iean chickens.
All rather friendly, as far as
appearances went, but in fact few
things cause the passions to
seethe quite like the business of
tariffs, and the approaching Ken
nedy Round, which has to do with
I an attempt to implement the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and
i corresponding measures in other
countries, will almost certainly
) cause, before it is done, consider
; able fireworks.
That is the reason for the super
i tight security in Geneva. The oh
; jective is to promote free world
) trade. The means being discussed
at Geneva is the reduction of up
j to 50 per cent of existing tariffs.
A Different Approach
The Kennedy Hound is dis
tinguished by a sharplj different
approach to the problem of tariff
cutting, one which, by changing
! the presumptions, has the effect
j of changing, in subtle ways, the
I prevailing psychological attitude.
It is customary, when nations
| have mot to discuss tariff-cutting,
| for negotiations to proceed to
build up. with item-by-item wran
gling, a list of the products the
i participants are willing to cut the
; tariff on.
The current meeting accepts
| the guiding principle that all tar-
I iffs should be cut except on
| those special products whose pro-
I tection is "justified by over-ruling
! international interests."
The purpose of the current con
' ference is to turn loose qualified
i teams of experts from each coun
try to argue that there are un
: necessary items on the excluded
lists of other countries.
How Much Progress
After the howls of protests, the
impassioned argument s. the
reams of dissenting statistics,
there will emerge, hopefully,
multilateral agreements which
will make huge headway towards
the goal of international free
trade.
The whole business of free
trade is monstrously complicated.
The ideal, which we shall always
fall short of, is the abolition of
all barriers. Those who believe

I that conservatives are the natural
protectionists and liberals the
j natural free traders should re
i fleet on the fact that it was Adam
; Smith, th(> father of the theory
! of free enterprise, who was ihe
most ardent free trader of them
all; and that it was the head of
; a socialist government in Great
: Britain who most recently raised
jail import duties by a whopping
15 per cent.
The Trade Expansion Act of
1962 has the virtue of tending to
I encourage the reduction of tar
iffs, but the weakness of doing
Iso by giving extraordinary d i s
i cretionary powers to the Presi
dent of the United States. The
Chief Executive may, under the
law and according to his sole
t discretion, reduce any tariff by
| 50 per cent, and the political and
economic pressures on him for
favoritism will be enormous.
Pressures Cause Secrecy
The same Mr. Kennedy who en
couraged the passage of that bill
had a way of buckling easily un
der pressure. While eampaiging
for the Presidency in 1960, he
promised protection to the shoe
manufacturers in New England,
j Subsequently, he raised the tariff
on bicycles, to protect our bicycle
industry. It is in recognition of
the fact of these pressures that
the lists at Geneva are preserved
with such secrecy.
There will be howling enough
i when Ihe results of the Geneva
! Conference are allowed. Apart
1 from politics, the principal danger
in the current situation is that
! insufficient attention will be paid
to the elimination of exchange
controls (it hardly helps to re-
I duee tariff barriers on a multi
| lateral basis if money is not then
| left to flow freelyK
Meanwhile, a massive educa
tional campaign should be initi
ated to demonstrate the mutual
values of free trade. (And I mean
the value to everyone concerned.
Twenty-three billion dollars, ap
proximately, were earned by
j American citizens last year from
j sales to foreign nations.) A pro
fitable enterprise for a Republi
can Party looking for something
constructive to do.
