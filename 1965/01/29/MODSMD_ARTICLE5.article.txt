Television stations should be required by law to give free time
to political candidates during the last month of a campaign, former
Federal Communications Commission chairman Newton Minow
told a Law Forum audience of around 200 last night.
"If every station had to give one hour per week to each major

party during the last month. anrM
proportionately less time lo minor
parlies, the rest of Section 315;
(the "equal time" law) could be
repealed," declared Minow.
The 38-year-old Minow, a Ken
nedy appointee who shocked I h c
television industry in 1961 with
his "vast wasteland" bias! and
strict enforcement, gave a b r ie I
speech and then appeared in a
panel with Professor Donald Tur
ner, visiting professor of law
from Harvard, and Richard K. j
Block, vice-president and general
manager of Kaiser Broadcasting
Corporation.
Minow stressed the importance
of regulation: "With the current
cost of network time, we often sec
candidates raising more funds
than issues.
"The station owners, who have
been given a public resource to :

â™¦
I the exclusion of others, have an
I obligation to the public interest,"
Iho continued. "It is the people
who have given the time to the
networks; they should have some
access to their own resource with
out paving tribute."
