# LASSU Tables Bill On Fundamental Standard
## Action Postponed To Cheek Possible Legal Complications 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
A resolution attempting to clarify violations ol the Funda
mental Standard came into LASSU like a lion last night; but how
it will come out is still in doubt, for the Legislature tabled it
pending a report of the President.
The resolution states "in the area of morality, nothing legal by
California and Federal law .shallf

bo considered a violation of the
Fundamental Standard."
IT WAS INTRODUCED by
graduate student Jay Kadane in
order "to put down in black and
white what we mean by moral
ity." He added that ho regarded
the resolution as a "clarification"
of ASSU regulations.
Object ions wore raised in th e
Legislature on the grounds that
Kadane's definition of "moral
ity" was not clear and that t he
Legislature had insufficient in
formation on possible effects and
legal questions created by the
resolution.
It was tabled with the assur
ance that ASSU President Scott
Mcßride would report to the body
in two weeks on the "legal back
ground and implications of the
resolution." Mcßride also indi
cated that lie would report on the
opinions of administrators w li o
are concerned with the student
judicial system.
KADANE SAID he felt th a t
the possibility existed that in the
present situation a student could
be expelled under the Funda
mental Standard for an action
legal under state law but which
others considered immoral.
If the resolution were to pass,
for the rest of the session of the
Legislature student judicial coun
cils could not recommend to the
Dean of Students any punishment
of students for immoral behavior
unless the student had violated a
state or federal law.
In other action by the Legisla

ture a resolution clarifying exist
ing campus regulations of solici
tations and fund drives was
passed, and the recently formed
Committee on Voluntary Organi
zations was instructed to consider
necessary changes in the by-laws
land constitution in the area of
fund raising.
THE RESOLUTION limits fund
raising drives to one per quarter
but permits collection of money
at "rallies," and "unlimited solici
tations by voluntary groups . . .
I except where such activity dis
turbs normal classroom activi
ties. . . ."
Six hundred dollars was ap
propriated from c on t in g c n c y
funds to the Political Union Board
I for the Wilbur Guest-in-Residence
program to bring Terry San ford,
j ex-Governor of North Carolina, to
i Stanford later in the year.

IT WAS INTRODUCED by
graduate student Jay Kadane in
order "to put down in black and
white what we mean by moral
ity." He added that ho regarded
the resolution as a "clarification"
of ASSU regulations.
Object ions wore raised in th e
Legislature on the grounds that
Kadane's definition of "moral
ity" was not clear and that t he
Legislature had insufficient in
formation on possible effects and
legal questions created by the
resolution.
It was tabled with the assur
ance that ASSU President Scott
Mcßride would report to the body
in two weeks on the "legal back
ground and implications of the
resolution." Mcßride also indi
cated that lie would report on the
opinions of administrators w li o
are concerned with the student
judicial system.
KADANE SAID he felt th a t
the possibility existed that in the
present situation a student could
be expelled under the Funda
mental Standard for an action
legal under state law but which
others considered immoral.
If the resolution were to pass,
for the rest of the session of the
Legislature student judicial coun
cils could not recommend to the
Dean of Students any punishment
of students for immoral behavior
unless the student had violated a
state or federal law.
In other action by the Legisla

ture a resolution clarifying exist
ing campus regulations of solici
tations and fund drives was
passed, and the recently formed
Committee on Voluntary Organi
zations was instructed to consider
necessary changes in the by-laws
land constitution in the area of
fund raising.
THE RESOLUTION limits fund
raising drives to one per quarter
but permits collection of money
at "rallies," and "unlimited solici
tations by voluntary groups . . .
I except where such activity dis
turbs normal classroom activi
ties. . . ."
Six hundred dollars was ap
propriated from c on t in g c n c y
funds to the Political Union Board
I for the Wilbur Guest-in-Residence
program to bring Terry San ford,
j ex-Governor of North Carolina, to
i Stanford later in the year.
A resolution attempting to clarify violations ol the Funda
mental Standard came into LASSU like a lion last night; but how
it will come out is still in doubt, for the Legislature tabled it
pending a report of the President.
The resolution states "in the area of morality, nothing legal by
California and Federal law .shallf

bo considered a violation of the
Fundamental Standard."
