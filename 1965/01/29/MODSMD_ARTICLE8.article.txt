The Indians started very quick- j
ly, building up a 31-9 lead at the I

productive f;is| break, and set up ,
scores with devastating passes.

the first hall can also be attrib
uted to fine defensive play. Lov

Gauchos so much that they could
not keep control ol the ball. The

the corner and Kosanke from the
key, Stanford racked up a 16-2(
lead at halftime. Gary Loveridgc
contributed all of his ten points t<
this first half splurge.
The Gauehos came out in the
second half quite chagrined, am
began to give the Indians rea
problems. UCSB outscored Stan

gained their momentum.
