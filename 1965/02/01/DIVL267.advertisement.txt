Why the Cross
of Jesus Christ?
What importance does Holy Scripture place upon the Cross of Jesus
Christ? Let us see what the New Testament reveals (Hebrews 10:1-23) in
regard to that new and living bridge which Jesus Christ opened between
God and man by virtue of His Crucifixion-.
"For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead i
of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices (i.e.
the sacrifices: of the Old Testament Jewish religion) which are continually
offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near. Otherwise would
they not have ceased to be offered? If the worshippers had once been cleansed,
they would no longer have any consciousness of sin. But in these sacrifices !
there is a reminder of sin year after year. For it is impossible that the blood
of bulls and goats should take away sin. Consequently, when Christ came
into the world He said, Sacrifices and offerings Thou hast not desired, but
a body Thou hast prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings thou
hast taken no pleasure. Then I said, Lo, I have come to do thy will, O God",
as it is written of me in the roll of the Book'. When He said above, 'Thou
hast neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt
offerings and sin offerings' (these are offered according to the law), then hp
added, 'Lo, I have come to do Thy will'. He abolishes the first in order to
establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the
j offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
And every high priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly
the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had
i offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins. He sat down at the right hand
i of God, then to wait until His enemies should be made a stool for His feet.
For by a single c'ering He has perfected for all time those who are
sanctified. And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying 'This
is the convenant that I will make with them after those days says the Lord: I
will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on thier minds', then He
adds, I will remember their sins and hteir misdeeds no more', Where there is
forgiveness o fthese there is no longer any offering for sin.
' 'Therefore, bretheren, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary i
| by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way He opened for us through the
curtain, that is, through His flesh, and since we have a Great Priest over the j
house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil concience, and our bodies washed
with pure water. Let us hold fast our confession of hope, for He who promised
is faithful."

hast taken no pleasure. Then I said, Lo, I have come to do thy will, O God",
as it is written of me in the roll of the Book'. When He said above, 'Thou
hast neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt
offerings and sin offerings' (these are offered according to the law), then hp
added, 'Lo, I have come to do Thy will'. He abolishes the first in order to
establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the
j offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
And every high priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly
the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins. But when Christ had
i offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins. He sat down at the right hand
i of God, then to wait until His enemies should be made a stool for His feet.
For by a single c'ering He has perfected for all time those who are
sanctified. And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying 'This
is the convenant that I will make with them after those days says the Lord: I
will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on thier minds', then He
adds, I will remember their sins and hteir misdeeds no more', Where there is
forgiveness o fthese there is no longer any offering for sin.
' 'Therefore, bretheren, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary i
| by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way He opened for us through the
curtain, that is, through His flesh, and since we have a Great Priest over the j
house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil concience, and our bodies washed
with pure water. Let us hold fast our confession of hope, for He who promised
is faithful."

Why the Cross
of Jesus Christ?
What importance does Holy Scripture place upon the Cross of Jesus
Christ? Let us see what the New Testament reveals (Hebrews 10:1-23) in
regard to that new and living bridge which Jesus Christ opened between
God and man by virtue of His Crucifixion-.
"For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead i
of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices (i.e.
the sacrifices: of the Old Testament Jewish religion) which are continually
offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near. Otherwise would
they not have ceased to be offered? If the worshippers had once been cleansed,
they would no longer have any consciousness of sin. But in these sacrifices !
there is a reminder of sin year after year. For it is impossible that the blood
of bulls and goats should take away sin. Consequently, when Christ came
into the world He said, Sacrifices and offerings Thou hast not desired, but
a body Thou hast prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings thou
hast taken no pleasure. Then I said, Lo, I have come to do thy will, O God",
as it is written of me in the roll of the Book'. When He said above, 'Thou
hast neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt
offerings and sin offerings' (these are offered according to the law), then hp
added, 'Lo, I have come to do Thy will'. He abolishes the first in order to
establish the second. And by that will we have been sanctified through the
