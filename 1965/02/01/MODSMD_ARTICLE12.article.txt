# Indians Surprised By Gauchos, 85-84
## 
### ROBERT THIERIOT 
Santa Barbara stunned the Stanford Indians Sat
urday night by squeaking out a 85-81 upset over the
Indians who had crushed the Gauchos by thirty
points only 48 hours before.
Using the home-court advantage to its fullest ex
tepi, tho Gauchos never allowed the Indians to build
up a commanding lead. On Thursday night here Russ
Banko and Tom Lee were hold to only four first half
points and 21 total for the game. But Saturday they
evenly divided 41 counters.
FROM THE BEGINNING the Indians were not
sharp. Bob Bedell and Clayton Raaka found them
selves in foul trouble very early in the half. Howie
Dallmar took them out to save them.
This left only Ray Kosanke as a dependable re
bounder, and Santa Barbara was able to take advan
tage of the Tribe's rebounding insufficiencies.
During the first half the lead changed constantly.
The Indians tried a full court press near the end of
the halt, when they found that the Gauchos were not
going to fold up and die. They didn't.
The second half produced almost a similar story.
Stanford led at half 36-33, but Santa Barbara grabbed
the lead a couple of times until the Indians finally
made their move. Although Bedell had already fouled
out, Ken Hinckley and Ray Kosanke led the Indians
to a nine point load.
I'lli;N WITH RAAKA out Stanford increased
the margin to an eleven point lead with only 5:20
left in the game. But the Gauchos came roaring
back. Able to control the rebounding, they enabled
themselves to take several shots. This also limited
Stanford's shooting generally to only <>ne shot.
A desperation 30-foot shot by sub-guard Dan Cobb
with :01 left in regulation time tied the game at
78-78. Lacking Raaka its best rebounder and Bedell
iis highest scorer, Stanford faced a five minute over
time.

going to fold up and die. They didn't.
The second half produced almost a similar story.
Stanford led at half 36-33, but Santa Barbara grabbed
the lead a couple of times until the Indians finally
made their move. Although Bedell had already fouled
out, Ken Hinckley and Ray Kosanke led the Indians
to a nine point load.
I'lli;N WITH RAAKA out Stanford increased
the margin to an eleven point lead with only 5:20
left in the game. But the Gauchos came roaring
back. Able to control the rebounding, they enabled
themselves to take several shots. This also limited
Stanford's shooting generally to only <>ne shot.
A desperation 30-foot shot by sub-guard Dan Cobb
with :01 left in regulation time tied the game at
78-78. Lacking Raaka its best rebounder and Bedell
iis highest scorer, Stanford faced a five minute over
time.
