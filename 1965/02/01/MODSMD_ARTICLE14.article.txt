of which SNCC developed. Th e j
program is being sponsored by;
the Mississippi Freedom Project-
Stanford.
The speech is expected to cover

LEWIS, A NATIVE of Ala !
bama and a Fisk University)
graduate in philosophy, is, at the
ago of twenty-five .already a vet

| eran of sit-in movements, and the
! Freedom Rides. He participated in
the original "Freedom .Ride" from
Washington to New Orleans in
j 1961.
Lewis' civil rights work has
! taken him through Mississippi,
1 Alabama, and Southwest Georgia.
His activities in pleading the case
of the Negro have landed him in:
jail 37 times.
Lewis' appearance will start a
week-long campus fund raising
drive for the Mississippi Freedom
Project. Some of the money raised
will go towards the purchase of
Negro history texts, art: and
sports equipment, and other sup
plies which will he sent to th c
' Mississippi Freedom Schools.
THE FREEDOM Schools were
! designed to offset the cirriculum
j of the regular Mississippi Negro
schools, which ignores political j

education almost entirely and
concentrates on the concept of
Southern History and "Southern"
mores.
In these schools the Negro child j
is taught that he is inferior; any!
mention of civil rights is punish-!
able by expulsion.
Other funds raised will be used I
to purchase necessary supplies for j
the Mississippi Community Cen
ters organized by The Council of.
Federated Organizations (COFO) j
â€”an amalgamation of all civil j
rights groups working in the
state.
Still other contributions will go !
toward financing of voter regis- j
t rat ion.
Till: MISSISSIPPI Parents j
Committee is also trying to raise
$50,000 in order to furnish neces
sary transportation for SNCC
workers. Contributors can donate i
to one of the specific items listed '
above if they desire. Contribution j
booths will be located at the Post |
Office, Tresidder, and Engineer- i
ing Corner.

aspects of the Civil Rights Move
ment will be on display at Bran
