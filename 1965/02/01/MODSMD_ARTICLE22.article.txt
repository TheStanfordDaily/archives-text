## Stanford Ruggers Beat Peacock Gap 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Stanford Rugby squad, led
by the offensive effoils of Bob
Blunt, rolled to their third
straight victory Saturday, defeat
ing the Peacock Cap Rugby Club
at their home field, 19-.").
Stanford opened the scoring
when Dick Ragsdale kicked a 30-
yard penalty kick. However Mur
do Nicholson of Peacock Cap fell
on a loose ball in the Stanford
end zone for three points.
TOM TRUTNER, like Nichol
son, an ex-California player,
kicked the conversion and the
home team had a 5-3 lead.
Soon afterward, Randy Vahan,
taking the ball in a close scrum,
scored a try. The conversion at
tempt was no good, but Stanford
had regained the lead. Stanford
took a kick deep in their own terri
tory and the ball was passed from

back to back out to the wing posi
tion.
Bob Blunt, the wing raced 50
yards into the Peacock Cap end
of the field. Cornered on the side
line, Blunt kicked a short punt
just over the head of the Peacock
Gap fullback, the last defensive
man.
BLUNT THEN outraced th e
fullback and picked up his own
kick to score a 90-yard try. In
dividual rugby runs seldom cover
more than 50 yeads as the 15 de
fensive men make open field run
ning difficult.
Dick Ragsdale scored the con
version kick after Blunt's try
and the half time score stood at
11-5 in Stanford's favor. The sec
ond half saw the Stanford scrum
play get stronger and stronger.
The Indians dominated much
of the second half lineouts and

scrums. Scoring plays in the sec
ond half both developed off of
"loose-ruck" passes. Bo b New
berry scored one try on a pass
from Randy Vahan and Bob Blunt
scored his second try of the day
on a short run making the final
score 19-5.
AFTER THE game, Coach Pete
Kmetavic said, "This was our fin
est game to date." The Indians
had previously won the Seven-a-
Side rugby tournament and swept
past the Peninsula Ramblers and
the San Francisco Oylmpic Club.
Coach Kmetovic lauded the
offensive play of all the Card
backs, especially Dan Terpack, a
former Princeton football player.
Steve Purcell, Jim Lynden, Henry
McQueen, and John Faber were
outstanding on defense.
Next week the Indians play
al home against San Diego State.

Tho San Diego team is one of the
j top Southern California teams and
features a basically younger team
I than those which the Indians have
i played this year.
THE REST of the season will
bo played against traditional Card
foes: USC, UCLA, and California.
The series of games with Cal will
decide this year's ownership of
the "Big Game Scrum Ax?." Cal
won the trophy last year.
The season will be climaxed
by i lit 1 Monterey Rugby Tourna
ment. to be played on March 20-21
at Carmel.
