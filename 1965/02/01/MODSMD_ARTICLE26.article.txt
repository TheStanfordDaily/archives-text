# Editor, The Daily
## Schwartz-Harding Volume Did Feature Balanced Columnists 
### 
Dear Sir:
No doubt John Bonine's latest
remarks will call fort h another
round of letters attacking his
various points; this one is no ex
ception, hut I would hope tho dis
cussion could evolve from this
point into a more general exami
nation of The Daily's function and
purpose.
Each of the past volumes might
merit similar attention, hut I'm
particularly concerned with
John's comments on Volume 143,
co-edited hy Dan Schwartz a n d
Margaret Harding.
The Schwartz-Harding volume,
as a point: of fact, did carry regu
lar student columnists, and ex
hibited as many guest columns
on all sides of a number of issues
as any volume 1 can remember,
including the most recent. One of
the regulars was Dick Weinig, a
contributing editor of that vol
ume, who for years has been one
of the most persistent exponents
of campus conservatism. Another
was K. W. Smith, whose "Poison
Ivy Primer," if not really conser
vative or liberal, was certainly in
cendiary.
The guest columnists in Volume
143 were chosen on the basis of
the depth of their acquaintance
with various issues, and both sides
were consistently, fairly repre
sented. Volume 143 contained no
instances of lopsidedness that
could match one this fall, when I
stared over the breakfast coffee

at a two-column endorsement of
Senator Goldwater, a picture of
the man so honored, a column by
Weinig and another by Buckley,
all packed together on one page
in warmth and harmony.
Schwartz and Harding also gave
their letters to the editor double
column treatment, each with a
separate headline. Staff opinion
columns were regularly given
prominent display in the normal
editorial space. One of these, span-
I ning two columns and running
; nearly three-quarters the length
, of the page, was by John Bonine.
Up to a certain point, perhaps,
a college newspaper should be
partisan in order to provoke a
measure of controversy necessary
on the campus, particularly one
with a rather apathetic past. Be
' yong that point it should leave
J its editorial pages open for a 11
; comers.
i All volumes for the past five
years have done this, nearly to
the same extent. In any event, a
four-year student generation
seems a fairly short time for an
establishment to take root a n d
then be mowed down by a revolu
tion from below. The campus
establishment that was sup
posedly overthrown last year, in
fact, was proclaiming at the time
that it had just overthrown the
one from the years before.
What is all the fuss about, any
way ?

• Daily Poll Misleading
Dear Sir:
We were glad to see The Daily
poll of student opinion concern
ing ofl'-campus living and the in
loco parentis policy. We would
like to point out, however, that
the poll is somewhat misleading.
The survey shows that only 33
per cent of the men prefer to live
off-campus, but this figure re
flects merely the opinion of on
| campus men. Since men have the
; prerogative of living either on or
I off campus, those polled probably
; live on campus because they pre
fer to.
It seems to us that the opposite
reactions of the men and women
to in loco parentis reflect th e
p resent administrative policy.
! Having fewer restrictions, the
men have fewer objections to the
present system.

Dear Sir:
No doubt John Bonine's latest
remarks will call fort h another
round of letters attacking his
various points; this one is no ex
ception, hut I would hope tho dis
cussion could evolve from this
point into a more general exami
nation of The Daily's function and
purpose.
Each of the past volumes might
merit similar attention, hut I'm
particularly concerned with
John's comments on Volume 143,
co-edited hy Dan Schwartz a n d
Margaret Harding.
The Schwartz-Harding volume,
as a point: of fact, did carry regu
lar student columnists, and ex
hibited as many guest columns
on all sides of a number of issues
as any volume 1 can remember,
including the most recent. One of
the regulars was Dick Weinig, a
contributing editor of that vol
ume, who for years has been one
of the most persistent exponents
of campus conservatism. Another
was K. W. Smith, whose "Poison
Ivy Primer," if not really conser
vative or liberal, was certainly in
cendiary.
The guest columnists in Volume
143 were chosen on the basis of
the depth of their acquaintance
with various issues, and both sides
were consistently, fairly repre
sented. Volume 143 contained no
instances of lopsidedness that
could match one this fall, when I
stared over the breakfast coffee

at a two-column endorsement of
Senator Goldwater, a picture of
the man so honored, a column by
Weinig and another by Buckley,
all packed together on one page
in warmth and harmony.
Schwartz and Harding also gave
their letters to the editor double
column treatment, each with a
separate headline. Staff opinion
columns were regularly given
prominent display in the normal
editorial space. One of these, span-
I ning two columns and running
; nearly three-quarters the length
, of the page, was by John Bonine.
Up to a certain point, perhaps,
a college newspaper should be
partisan in order to provoke a
measure of controversy necessary
on the campus, particularly one
with a rather apathetic past. Be
' yong that point it should leave
J its editorial pages open for a 11
; comers.
i All volumes for the past five
years have done this, nearly to
the same extent. In any event, a
four-year student generation
seems a fairly short time for an
establishment to take root a n d
then be mowed down by a revolu
tion from below. The campus
establishment that was sup
posedly overthrown last year, in
fact, was proclaiming at the time
that it had just overthrown the
one from the years before.
What is all the fuss about, any
way ?
