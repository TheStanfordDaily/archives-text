## Graduate Students Boost Potential Of Legislature 
### Justin Beck 
LASSU took a big stop toward becoming a legislature last week
with the seating of 52 new graduate members. This action gives
it a record 139 members, double last year's membership.
That is a record not likely to be matched again this year for
the rule expelling a member who is absent without a substitute for

three consecutive meetings tends - "
to remove members faster than
new ones can be appointed.
But the record would hardly be
worth mentioning, if the new
members, particularly the grad
students, were in the tradition of
past representatives. However, on
the basis of the last meeting they
are not.
<*rud Student Leaders
Graduate students have, when
the spirit has moved them, been
leaders in student government.
Armin Roseneranz, ASSU Presi
dent in 1962-63, was the first
graduate student ever to hold the
position, and he is accepted by I
most people as being one of the
best. Much of the current concern
with student rights and an ex
panded student government dates!
from his term of office.
Last year the Speaker of t he
Legislature for most of the year
was a graduate student, Brad Ef
ron, and this year the chairmen of
the two most important standing
committees are graduate students, j
Don Campbell of Finance and
Carl Hillenbrand of By-Laws.
But while graduate students
could add expertise to key posi
tions, there were simply too few
of them to really achieve any
thing.
LASSU Apathy
In addition, the Legislature!
has been caught in a circle of in
competence and apathy. Students,
generally are apathetic about stu
dent government, and, for the
most part, don't really care who
represents them, or on what
issues they are represented.
LAS.SU members in return tend
not to care, simply because no one
else does, and, with that attitude,
seldom do anything worth caring
about.
The principal force in student
government, since the creation of
the large legislature, has been the
president of the Association, both
because ASSU Presidents have
been mainly excellent leaders, and
because LASSU representatives
have been generally incompetent.
Speaker Ed Shaw sel out in the
beginning of ihe year to strenghen
the Legislature but his successes
have not been proportional to hi s
efforts.
It is fortunate that the Legis
lature has not been overwhelmed
by the President, as has happened
in the past. This year LASSU is
making its own decisions; the de
feat of the Student Affairs bill
proves that not even Shaw can 1
make the Legislature accept un
popular legislation.
What remains for the Legisla
ture to do, is to develop some in
telligent dialogue on which, hope

fully it. can make some decisions.
Graduate students promise to pro
vide this dialogue.
Spirit of FSM
One fear expressed about th e
new members is that they are in
fused with the spirit of the FSM
and are more interested in rebel
lion than in responsibility. This
fear was put aside Thursday with
the graduate students displaying
a caution that hardly promises fu
ture rash action.
They have yet to show the forti-1
tude in the face of boredom that j
is the true test of an effective'
Legislature, but the indication is;
that most are willing to face the 1
minor issues that confront
LASSU in the hope that a majoi j
issue will come up.
Last Thursday, in fact, the (
graduate students showed far
more promise of being capable
members of student government
than have most of the undergradu
ates who have taken up space in
LASSU for the past couple of
years. They made most of the
really incisive comments, permit
ting the undergrads to quibble, as
only undergraduates can.
Not A True Forum
In the past the Legislature has j
been too often a farce. Increased :
awareness of its potential has
led to some improvement in its
personnel, but until the recent in
flux of graduate students, there
seemed to be little hope that it
could ever really be a true forum
for discussion—at least this year.
But last week's meeting gave
an indication that perhaps the
"revolution" of the past several
years in the concept of the respon
sibilities of student government
is at last seeping down to the
great mass of students. Cal and
the Graduate Coordinating Com
mittee have further created a
| great interest among graduate
students in student relations with
the University, and the GCC's in
terest in functioning student gov
j eminent has channeled graduate
interest into the Legislature.
Judging from the relative per-!
forma nee of the graduates and;
undergraduates last week, it may
bo, however, that in the past stu
dent leaders have tried the wrong ,
approach.
Perhaps undergraduate inter-j
I est in student government should
: not be promoted. Rather the;
i graduate students should be left j
to manage the major student i
issues, for they seem to under
stand them better. Perhaps the!
real success of student govern
ment depends upon undergraduate
apathy.

LASSU Apathy
In addition, the Legislature!
has been caught in a circle of in
competence and apathy. Students,
generally are apathetic about stu
dent government, and, for the
most part, don't really care who
represents them, or on what
issues they are represented.
LAS.SU members in return tend
not to care, simply because no one
else does, and, with that attitude,
seldom do anything worth caring
about.
The principal force in student
government, since the creation of
the large legislature, has been the
president of the Association, both
because ASSU Presidents have
been mainly excellent leaders, and
because LASSU representatives
have been generally incompetent.
Speaker Ed Shaw sel out in the
beginning of ihe year to strenghen
the Legislature but his successes
have not been proportional to hi s
efforts.
It is fortunate that the Legis
lature has not been overwhelmed
by the President, as has happened
in the past. This year LASSU is
making its own decisions; the de
feat of the Student Affairs bill
proves that not even Shaw can 1
make the Legislature accept un
popular legislation.
What remains for the Legisla
ture to do, is to develop some in
telligent dialogue on which, hope

fully it. can make some decisions.
Graduate students promise to pro
vide this dialogue.
Spirit of FSM
One fear expressed about th e
new members is that they are in
fused with the spirit of the FSM
and are more interested in rebel
lion than in responsibility. This
fear was put aside Thursday with
the graduate students displaying
a caution that hardly promises fu
ture rash action.
They have yet to show the forti-1
tude in the face of boredom that j
is the true test of an effective'
Legislature, but the indication is;
that most are willing to face the 1
minor issues that confront
LASSU in the hope that a majoi j
issue will come up.
Last Thursday, in fact, the (
graduate students showed far
more promise of being capable
members of student government
than have most of the undergradu
ates who have taken up space in
LASSU for the past couple of
years. They made most of the
really incisive comments, permit
ting the undergrads to quibble, as
only undergraduates can.
Not A True Forum
In the past the Legislature has j
been too often a farce. Increased :
awareness of its potential has
led to some improvement in its
personnel, but until the recent in
flux of graduate students, there
seemed to be little hope that it
could ever really be a true forum
for discussion—at least this year.
But last week's meeting gave
an indication that perhaps the
"revolution" of the past several
years in the concept of the respon
sibilities of student government
is at last seeping down to the
great mass of students. Cal and
the Graduate Coordinating Com
mittee have further created a
| great interest among graduate
students in student relations with
the University, and the GCC's in
terest in functioning student gov
j eminent has channeled graduate
interest into the Legislature.
Judging from the relative per-!
forma nee of the graduates and;
undergraduates last week, it may
bo, however, that in the past stu
dent leaders have tried the wrong ,
approach.
Perhaps undergraduate inter-j
I est in student government should
: not be promoted. Rather the;
i graduate students should be left j
to manage the major student i
issues, for they seem to under
stand them better. Perhaps the!
real success of student govern
ment depends upon undergraduate
apathy.
LASSU took a big stop toward becoming a legislature last week
with the seating of 52 new graduate members. This action gives
it a record 139 members, double last year's membership.
That is a record not likely to be matched again this year for
the rule expelling a member who is absent without a substitute for

three consecutive meetings tends - "
to remove members faster than
new ones can be appointed.
But the record would hardly be
worth mentioning, if the new
members, particularly the grad
students, were in the tradition of
past representatives. However, on
the basis of the last meeting they
are not.
<*rud Student Leaders
Graduate students have, when
the spirit has moved them, been
leaders in student government.
Armin Roseneranz, ASSU Presi
dent in 1962-63, was the first
graduate student ever to hold the
position, and he is accepted by I
most people as being one of the
best. Much of the current concern
with student rights and an ex
panded student government dates!
from his term of office.
Last year the Speaker of t he
Legislature for most of the year
was a graduate student, Brad Ef
ron, and this year the chairmen of
the two most important standing
committees are graduate students, j
Don Campbell of Finance and
Carl Hillenbrand of By-Laws.
But while graduate students
could add expertise to key posi

of them to really achieve any
thing.

fear was put aside Thursday with
the graduate students displaying
a caution that hardly promises fu
ture rash action.
They have yet to show the forti-1
tude in the face of boredom that j
is the true test of an effective'
Legislature, but the indication is;
that most are willing to face the 1
minor issues that confront
LASSU in the hope that a majoi j
issue will come up.
Last Thursday, in fact, the (
graduate students showed far
more promise of being capable
members of student government
than have most of the undergradu
ates who have taken up space in
LASSU for the past couple of
years. They made most of the
really incisive comments, permit
ting the undergrads to quibble, as
only undergraduates can.
Not A True Forum
In the past the Legislature has j
been too often a farce. Increased :
awareness of its potential has
led to some improvement in its
personnel, but until the recent in
flux of graduate students, there
seemed to be little hope that it
could ever really be a true forum
for discussion—at least this year.
But last week's meeting gave
an indication that perhaps the
"revolution" of the past several
years in the concept of the respon
sibilities of student government
is at last seeping down to the
great mass of students. Cal and
the Graduate Coordinating Com
mittee have further created a
| great interest among graduate
students in student relations with
the University, and the GCC's in
terest in functioning student gov
j eminent has channeled graduate
interest into the Legislature.
Judging from the relative per-!
forma nee of the graduates and;
undergraduates last week, it may
bo, however, that in the past stu
dent leaders have tried the wrong ,
approach.
Perhaps undergraduate inter-j
I est in student government should
: not be promoted. Rather the;
i graduate students should be left j
to manage the major student i
issues, for they seem to under
stand them better. Perhaps the!
real success of student govern
ment depends upon undergraduate
apathy.
LASSU took a big stop toward becoming a legislature last week
with the seating of 52 new graduate members. This action gives
it a record 139 members, double last year's membership.
That is a record not likely to be matched again this year for
the rule expelling a member who is absent without a substitute for

three consecutive meetings tends - "
to remove members faster than
new ones can be appointed.
But the record would hardly be
worth mentioning, if the new
members, particularly the grad
students, were in the tradition of
past representatives. However, on
the basis of the last meeting they
are not.
<*rud Student Leaders
Graduate students have, when
the spirit has moved them, been
leaders in student government.
Armin Roseneranz, ASSU Presi
dent in 1962-63, was the first
graduate student ever to hold the
position, and he is accepted by I
most people as being one of the
best. Much of the current concern
with student rights and an ex
panded student government dates!
from his term of office.
Last year the Speaker of t he
Legislature for most of the year
was a graduate student, Brad Ef
ron, and this year the chairmen of
the two most important standing
committees are graduate students, j
Don Campbell of Finance and
Carl Hillenbrand of By-Laws.
But while graduate students
could add expertise to key posi
tions, there were simply too few
of them to really achieve any
thing.
LASSU Apathy
In addition, the Legislature!
has been caught in a circle of in
competence and apathy. Students,
generally are apathetic about stu
dent government, and, for the
most part, don't really care who
represents them, or on what
issues they are represented.
LAS.SU members in return tend
not to care, simply because no one
else does, and, with that attitude,
seldom do anything worth caring
about.
The principal force in student
government, since the creation of
the large legislature, has been the
president of the Association, both
because ASSU Presidents have
been mainly excellent leaders, and
because LASSU representatives
have been generally incompetent.
Speaker Ed Shaw sel out in the
beginning of ihe year to strenghen
the Legislature but his successes
have not been proportional to hi s
efforts.
It is fortunate that the Legis
lature has not been overwhelmed
by the President, as has happened
in the past. This year LASSU is
making its own decisions; the de
feat of the Student Affairs bill
proves that not even Shaw can 1
make the Legislature accept un
popular legislation.
What remains for the Legisla
ture to do, is to develop some in
telligent dialogue on which, hope

fully it. can make some decisions.
Graduate students promise to pro
vide this dialogue.
Spirit of FSM
One fear expressed about th e
new members is that they are in
fused with the spirit of the FSM
and are more interested in rebel
lion than in responsibility. This
fear was put aside Thursday with
the graduate students displaying
a caution that hardly promises fu
ture rash action.
