## Selma Vote Drive To Spread 
### 
SELMA, Ala. â€” Civil rights leaders say a
campaign to register Negroes as voters will
spread from Selma, Ala., into neighboring
Perry County today, while massive street
demonstrations may be used to emphasize the
Selma drive.
Negroes will be encouraged to march on
the Perry courthouse in Marion, 30 miles west
of Selma, said the Rev. James Bevel, an inte
gration leader.
Bevel also said the drive in Selma will enter
its third week and may be dramatized by street
demonstrations.

Meanwhile, a three-judge federal panel has
been appointed to hear a Justice Department
suit asking that the literacy test used to regis
ter voters in Alabama be thrown out. The suit
contends the voter registration test is dis
criminatory. The state is asking that the suit
be thrown out, claiming the federal courts do
not have jurisdiction.
Although a federal voter referee has been
appointed in Perry County, Negroes say the
registration pace there still is too slow.
More than 200 persons have been arrested
in Selma since the drive began.
