AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. â€” A special
five-man panel named to investigate the cheat
ing scandal at the Air Force Academy will visit
the school within two weeks to make a thor
ough study of several ma jor cadet and admin
istrative functions.

in the meantime, Air Force investigators
will continue to question those members of the
2,567 cadet wing suspected of vlolatting the
academy honor code. Ninety-three cadets have
resigned since the exams-for-sale probe was
first disclosed Jan. 19. *
A call for "patience and faith" in dealing
with the problem was made in Tokyo yesterday
by a former director of athletics at the aca
demy, Air Force Col. M. L. Martin. He warned
against anticipating the cause and dictating a
cure "that probably does not fit the diagnosis."
