# An Intimate New Cellar
## 
### JOHN E. BONINE Contributing Editor 
No bright lights, anti
septic atmosphere, and cafe
teria character. Instead, red
and-white checkered table
cloths in a candle-lit room
with a follcsinging group in
one turner, a spirited argu
ment on Vietnam in another,
and rippling playing cards in
between.
The New Cellar which
opened Friday night in the
basement of the Women's
Clubhouse drew a crowd of
perhaps 200 before the even
ing was over.
"Where else can you get
two bags of popcorn and two
cups of cider for 20 cents?"
commented one visitor. Prices
are low (coffee: 5 cents and
any profits will be plowed
back into the operation).
Many praised the intimate
fire, couches, and limited
capacity. "At least there is
somewhere to go after the
Friday evening flicks or
speeches," said one patron.
The Cellar, which operates
with volunteer student help,
will be open every other Fri
day evening. On alternate
Friday's a faculty group uses
the facilities for a meting.
