The Glory of God
Expressions like "the glory of God" are unfamiliar and old-fashioned to
some modern minds, yet well worth a little study and interpretation. We
commonly use the word "glory" to refer to prestige and honor sought after
by a person who is motivated by pride. But our English Bible word "glory",
used to translate the Hebrew "kabod" and the Greek "doxa", means the
"outshining splendor", the majestic brilliance" and the "revealed character
and Person" of Almighty God, "who alone has immortality and dwells in
unapproachable light" (I Timothy 6:1 6).
The "glory of God", the Divine Fire of His Presence was visibly manifested
to the people of Israel in a unique way in ancient times. By night a pillar of
fire accompanied the Israelites during their wanderings, and by day a pillar
of cloud. In the inner most sanctuary, the Holy of Holies of their tabernacle,
between the outstretched arms of golden cherubim above the ark of the
covenant, God's Presence was manifested as the Shekinah the glory light of
God the Holy Spirit:
Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord
filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting
because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle
. . . throughout all their journeys the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle
by day, and the fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel"
(Exodus 40:34-38)
Ignorant of God s Character and Ways, some modern theologians dismiss
the Old Testament "glory of God" as mere mythology. Christians believe
otherwise, for what God illustrated by external, visible signs, by Divine Fire
in the tabernacle, He now more intimately demonstrates within the bodies of
those born again by faith in Jesus Christ. 1 Do you not know that your body
is the temple of the Holy Spirit"? Paul asks Christians |l Cor. 6:19), reminding
them that it is God who now dwells within them in a special way which unites
them into the one Body of Christ.
Those who have personally met and accepted Jesus Christ are assured
of God's "enlightenment" and understanding, for His glory is real and
beautiful within every believer: "when a man turns to the Lord the veil is
removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
liberty . . . and we all with unvieled face beholding the glory of the Lord ore
being changed into His likeness from one degree of glory to another,- for this
comes from the Lord who is the Spirit" (2 Cor. 3:16-18).
Jesus Christ, the Light of the world, the visible expression of the invisible
God reflects and reveals the glory of God. Your invitation asking Him into
your heart will bring you a deep personal knowledge of God and God's
revelation to you of His glory. "For God commanded the light ot shine out of
darkness has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Cor. 4:6)

. . . throughout all their journeys the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle
by day, and the fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel"
(Exodus 40:34-38)
Ignorant of God s Character and Ways, some modern theologians dismiss
the Old Testament "glory of God" as mere mythology. Christians believe
otherwise, for what God illustrated by external, visible signs, by Divine Fire
in the tabernacle, He now more intimately demonstrates within the bodies of
those born again by faith in Jesus Christ. 1 Do you not know that your body
is the temple of the Holy Spirit"? Paul asks Christians |l Cor. 6:19), reminding
them that it is God who now dwells within them in a special way which unites
them into the one Body of Christ.
Those who have personally met and accepted Jesus Christ are assured
of God's "enlightenment" and understanding, for His glory is real and
beautiful within every believer: "when a man turns to the Lord the veil is
removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is
liberty . . . and we all with unvieled face beholding the glory of the Lord ore
being changed into His likeness from one degree of glory to another,- for this
comes from the Lord who is the Spirit" (2 Cor. 3:16-18).
Jesus Christ, the Light of the world, the visible expression of the invisible
God reflects and reveals the glory of God. Your invitation asking Him into
your heart will bring you a deep personal knowledge of God and God's
revelation to you of His glory. "For God commanded the light ot shine out of
darkness has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the
glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Cor. 4:6)

The Glory of God
Expressions like "the glory of God" are unfamiliar and old-fashioned to
some modern minds, yet well worth a little study and interpretation. We
commonly use the word "glory" to refer to prestige and honor sought after
by a person who is motivated by pride. But our English Bible word "glory",
used to translate the Hebrew "kabod" and the Greek "doxa", means the
"outshining splendor", the majestic brilliance" and the "revealed character
and Person" of Almighty God, "who alone has immortality and dwells in
unapproachable light" (I Timothy 6:1 6).
The "glory of God", the Divine Fire of His Presence was visibly manifested
to the people of Israel in a unique way in ancient times. By night a pillar of
fire accompanied the Israelites during their wanderings, and by day a pillar
of cloud. In the inner most sanctuary, the Holy of Holies of their tabernacle,
between the outstretched arms of golden cherubim above the ark of the
covenant, God's Presence was manifested as the Shekinah the glory light of
God the Holy Spirit:
Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord
filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting
because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle
. . . throughout all their journeys the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle
by day, and the fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel"
