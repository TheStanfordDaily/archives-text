# Teachers' Values Are Part Of Class Learning
##

"What place should value commitments —
the professor's own and those he opposes
take in the classroom?" is the question an
swered by seven prominent Stanford profes
sors in the winter edition of Stanford Today.
Professor John L. Mothershead, Jr., of the
School of Philosophy, who polled the other six
professors on request of the journal, com
ments, "On three important principles, the
members of the present symposium are in
firm agreement: (1) Fruitful teaching, in
whatever subject, cannot go on in a value va
cuum. <2) Proper teaching is not indoctrina
tion. (3) The expression and discussion of
valuations in the classroom should be relevant
to the course."
ELABORATING ON the subject, Dr. Jo
seph P. Kriss, Professor of Medicine and Radi
ology, states that when teaching is at; the
borders of any discipline, it is necessary to
present controversial or conjectural material
only after identifying its as such. However,

Dr. Kriss adds, "I cannot conceive the proper
use of the classroom to include the presenta
tion of personal viewpoints totally unrelated
to the teacher's field or his teaching assign
ment."
These sentiments are echoed by Dr. Ralph
J. Smith, Professor of Electrical Engineering.
"On topics relevant to the student teacher rela
tion and on issues where I have something to
contribute, I believe that I have an obligation
to indicate my attitudes by word and ex
ample."
Commenting on the effect of a professor's
opinions in a technical field such as engineer
ing, Dr. Smith remarked that engineering stu
dents at a university such as Stanford are con
cerned with subjects other than purely tech
nical matters. "Furthermore the engineering
professor is in the optimum position to en
courage the development of a set of ideals," he
added.
OR. ROBERT R. SEARS, Professor of
Psychology and Dean, School of Humanities
and Sciences, cautions: "The risk of introduc

ing values is that it may be done blindly.
There Is a shadowy realm between knowledge
and belief in every field."
However, Dr. Sears elaborates his position
by siatinf. "I believe he (the professor) can
do no damage and it 1 «ure to do vast good if he
openly declares in advance ihre'jph what eval
uative telescope he sees the world—and hi*
own subject matter in relation to it." Re-en
forcing this argument, Dr. Sears declares that
the function of the university is to enable its
students to learn objective thinking in a broad
variety of subjects.
To allow his own prejudices to become evi
dent would tend to bring about a natural senti
ment of student opposition to a professor's
point of view, is the opinion of Dr. Graham H.
Stuart, Professor of Political Science, Emeri
tus. However, Dr. Stuart allows, "It is also per
mitted the professor in answering questions
to give his own views on the subject candidly
and as persuasively as possible."
OR. STUART SUPPORTS his belief in this
method of teaching by quoting the famous au

thor Alan Drury, once one of his students, who
described it as a "class in which the student
pets a chance to give as well as receive."
"Since knowledge is always less than com
plete, there is room for the expression of feel
ing and opinion," is the contention of Dr. Eric
Hutchinson, Professor of Chemistry.
He further explains his viewpoint by argu
ing To provide the student with only the ex
perimental and conceptual methodology of
science is mischievously irresponsible." "To
train may be an adequate function for an insti
tute of technology; nothing less than education
is a worthy function of a university. . . . We
may, indeed, do them (the students) a real dis
service if we do not not expose them to value
judgments that they may adopt or reject as
they see fit," he concludes.
OR. GOROON WRIGHT, Professor of His
tory and Executive Head, Department of His
tory ,says, "Any attempt to impose one's own
value judgments in the classroom is . . . an
abuse of confidence." Continuing his argu
ment, he declares that the purpose of a liberal

education "is not to provide students with ;i
code of ready-made orthodox beliefs; rather, it
ought to help students grope their individual
ways toward an understanding of issues and
an informed choice of values."
Summing up his position, Dr. Wright con
cludes, "The heart of the process must always
be found in those classrooms where all of the
alternatives are wide open to examination and
where the teacher's concern is to make sun'
that each alternative gets a fair hearing."
Dr. Mothershead, commenting on his own
beliefs on matters of intellectual freedom,
states that it is necessary "That the teacher
possess reasoned value commitments and that
he be prepared to affirm and support, but not
impose them."
Cumulatively the group varies as widely as
do their particular fields of endeavor, but on
one thing they are in agreement. It is neces
sary for any teacher to possess a set of beliefs
which are well enough reasoned that he can
present them to his students in a non-dogmatic
manner.

and belief in every field."
However, Dr. Sears elaborates his position
by siatinf. "I believe he (the professor) can
do no damage and it 1 «ure to do vast good if he
openly declares in advance ihre'jph what eval
uative telescope he sees the world—and hi*
own subject matter in relation to it." Re-en
forcing this argument, Dr. Sears declares that
the function of the university is to enable its
students to learn objective thinking in a broad
variety of subjects.
To allow his own prejudices to become evi
dent would tend to bring about a natural senti
ment of student opposition to a professor's
point of view, is the opinion of Dr. Graham H.
Stuart, Professor of Political Science, Emeri
tus. However, Dr. Stuart allows, "It is also per
mitted the professor in answering questions
to give his own views on the subject candidly
and as persuasively as possible."
OR. STUART SUPPORTS his belief in this
method of teaching by quoting the famous au

thor Alan Drury, once one of his students, who
described it as a "class in which the student
pets a chance to give as well as receive."
"Since knowledge is always less than com
plete, there is room for the expression of feel
ing and opinion," is the contention of Dr. Eric
Hutchinson, Professor of Chemistry.
He further explains his viewpoint by argu
ing To provide the student with only the ex
perimental and conceptual methodology of
science is mischievously irresponsible." "To
train may be an adequate function for an insti
tute of technology; nothing less than education
is a worthy function of a university. . . . We
may, indeed, do them (the students) a real dis
service if we do not not expose them to value
judgments that they may adopt or reject as
they see fit," he concludes.
OR. GOROON WRIGHT, Professor of His
tory and Executive Head, Department of His
tory ,says, "Any attempt to impose one's own
value judgments in the classroom is . . . an
abuse of confidence." Continuing his argu
ment, he declares that the purpose of a liberal

education "is not to provide students with ;i
code of ready-made orthodox beliefs; rather, it
ought to help students grope their individual
ways toward an understanding of issues and
an informed choice of values."
Summing up his position, Dr. Wright con
cludes, "The heart of the process must always
be found in those classrooms where all of the
alternatives are wide open to examination and
where the teacher's concern is to make sun'
that each alternative gets a fair hearing."
Dr. Mothershead, commenting on his own
beliefs on matters of intellectual freedom,
states that it is necessary "That the teacher
possess reasoned value commitments and that
he be prepared to affirm and support, but not
impose them."
Cumulatively the group varies as widely as
do their particular fields of endeavor, but on
one thing they are in agreement. It is neces
sary for any teacher to possess a set of beliefs
which are well enough reasoned that he can
present them to his students in a non-dogmatic
manner.
"What place should value commitments —
the professor's own and those he opposes
take in the classroom?" is the question an
swered by seven prominent Stanford profes
sors in the winter edition of Stanford Today.
Professor John L. Mothershead, Jr., of the
School of Philosophy, who polled the other six
professors on request of the journal, com
ments, "On three important principles, the
members of the present symposium are in
firm agreement: (1) Fruitful teaching, in
whatever subject, cannot go on in a value va
cuum. <2) Proper teaching is not indoctrina
tion. (3) The expression and discussion of
valuations in the classroom should be relevant
to the course."
ELABORATING ON the subject, Dr. Jo
seph P. Kriss, Professor of Medicine and Radi
ology, states that when teaching is at; the
borders of any discipline, it is necessary to
present controversial or conjectural material
only after identifying its as such. However,

Dr. Kriss adds, "I cannot conceive the proper
use of the classroom to include the presenta
tion of personal viewpoints totally unrelated
to the teacher's field or his teaching assign
ment."
These sentiments are echoed by Dr. Ralph
J. Smith, Professor of Electrical Engineering.
"On topics relevant to the student teacher rela
tion and on issues where I have something to
contribute, I believe that I have an obligation
to indicate my attitudes by word and ex
ample."
Commenting on the effect of a professor's
opinions in a technical field such as engineer
ing, Dr. Smith remarked that engineering stu
dents at a university such as Stanford are con
cerned with subjects other than purely tech
nical matters. "Furthermore the engineering
professor is in the optimum position to en
courage the development of a set of ideals," he
added.

abuse of confidence." Continuing his argu
ment, he declares that the purpose of a liberal

education "is not to provide students with ;i
code of ready-made orthodox beliefs; rather, it
ought to help students grope their individual
ways toward an understanding of issues and
an informed choice of values."
Summing up his position, Dr. Wright con
cludes, "The heart of the process must always
be found in those classrooms where all of the
alternatives are wide open to examination and
where the teacher's concern is to make sun'
that each alternative gets a fair hearing."
Dr. Mothershead, commenting on his own
beliefs on matters of intellectual freedom,
states that it is necessary "That the teacher
possess reasoned value commitments and that
he be prepared to affirm and support, but not
impose them."
Cumulatively the group varies as widely as
do their particular fields of endeavor, but on
one thing they are in agreement. It is neces
sary for any teacher to possess a set of beliefs
which are well enough reasoned that he can
present them to his students in a non-dogmatic
manner.
"What place should value commitments —
the professor's own and those he opposes
take in the classroom?" is the question an
swered by seven prominent Stanford profes
sors in the winter edition of Stanford Today.
Professor John L. Mothershead, Jr., of the
School of Philosophy, who polled the other six
professors on request of the journal, com
ments, "On three important principles, the
members of the present symposium are in
firm agreement: (1) Fruitful teaching, in
whatever subject, cannot go on in a value va
cuum. <2) Proper teaching is not indoctrina
tion. (3) The expression and discussion of
valuations in the classroom should be relevant
to the course."
ELABORATING ON the subject, Dr. Jo
seph P. Kriss, Professor of Medicine and Radi
ology, states that when teaching is at; the
borders of any discipline, it is necessary to
present controversial or conjectural material
only after identifying its as such. However,

Dr. Kriss adds, "I cannot conceive the proper
use of the classroom to include the presenta
tion of personal viewpoints totally unrelated
to the teacher's field or his teaching assign
ment."
These sentiments are echoed by Dr. Ralph
J. Smith, Professor of Electrical Engineering.
"On topics relevant to the student teacher rela
tion and on issues where I have something to
contribute, I believe that I have an obligation
to indicate my attitudes by word and ex
ample."
Commenting on the effect of a professor's
opinions in a technical field such as engineer
ing, Dr. Smith remarked that engineering stu
dents at a university such as Stanford are con
cerned with subjects other than purely tech
nical matters. "Furthermore the engineering
professor is in the optimum position to en
courage the development of a set of ideals," he
added.
OR. ROBERT R. SEARS, Professor of
Psychology and Dean, School of Humanities
and Sciences, cautions: "The risk of introduc

ing values is that it may be done blindly.
There Is a shadowy realm between knowledge
and belief in every field."
However, Dr. Sears elaborates his position
by siatinf. "I believe he (the professor) can
do no damage and it 1 «ure to do vast good if he
openly declares in advance ihre'jph what eval
uative telescope he sees the world—and hi*
own subject matter in relation to it." Re-en
forcing this argument, Dr. Sears declares that
the function of the university is to enable its
students to learn objective thinking in a broad
variety of subjects.
To allow his own prejudices to become evi
dent would tend to bring about a natural senti
ment of student opposition to a professor's
point of view, is the opinion of Dr. Graham H.
Stuart, Professor of Political Science, Emeri
tus. However, Dr. Stuart allows, "It is also per
mitted the professor in answering questions
to give his own views on the subject candidly
and as persuasively as possible."
OR. STUART SUPPORTS his belief in this
method of teaching by quoting the famous au

thor Alan Drury, once one of his students, who
described it as a "class in which the student
pets a chance to give as well as receive."
"Since knowledge is always less than com
plete, there is room for the expression of feel
ing and opinion," is the contention of Dr. Eric
Hutchinson, Professor of Chemistry.
He further explains his viewpoint by argu
ing To provide the student with only the ex
perimental and conceptual methodology of
science is mischievously irresponsible." "To
train may be an adequate function for an insti
tute of technology; nothing less than education
is a worthy function of a university. . . . We
may, indeed, do them (the students) a real dis
service if we do not not expose them to value
judgments that they may adopt or reject as
they see fit," he concludes.

tory and Executive Head, Department of His
tory ,says, "Any attempt to impose one's own
