### PAUL DE BLANK 
"The old national boundaries of Europe just
don't make sense in the technically-minded Twen

Prof. Bowie will speak at 7:45 p.m. in Dinkel

American and European students, he said, "Ameri

They have very heavy time schedules, with a
stronger emphasis on attending lectures than in
Europe."
