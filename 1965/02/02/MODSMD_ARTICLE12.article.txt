# Freedom Chairman Speaks
## Lewis' Talk Urges Funds For SNCC 
### BOB PICKUS 
John Lewis, national chairman
of the Student Non-Violent Co
ordinating Committee (SNCC),
spoke on this eampus yesterday,
urging the Stanford community
to join him in "the freedom strug
gle."
Sponsored by the Mississippi
Freedom Project-Stanford, the
speech was the kick-off of a weok
long fund-raising drive in behalf
of the southern effort. The speak
er was in the Bay Area to help
mark the fifth anniversary of the
Greensboro, North Carolina, sit
ins, out of which SNCC emerged.
Lewis presented a brief sketch
of what is currently happening in
the "struggle that is rocking the
South, and shaking this nation."
When the winner of a degree in
philosophical theology from Bos
ton University cannot pass a voter
literacy test, Lewis projected,
"something is wrong."
He stated that, before Negroes
got the vote in the deep South,
there will have to be federal in
tervention.
In the area surrounding Selrna,
Alabama, scene of present Negro
registration efforts, Lewis re
ported, there is a Negro voting
age population of more than 50,-
000 of whom only 300 are regis
tered to vote. The system of seg
regation is so evil, lie said, "that
we must destroy it and destroy it
now."
The speaker expressed great
enthusiasm for last summer's
Mississippi Summer Project. "We
saw, for the first time," he re
flected, "citizens outside of Mis
sissippi who cared." The project,
he continued, "gave the Negro
people of Mississippi a sense of
hope, a sense of pride, a sense of
dignity" that nothing had given
them before.
In fact, he noted, the only true
integration in America may be
that "in the movement." These
young people, he offered, "know
what ar integrated society really
means. They're making life worth
living . . . because they're involved
in a struggle that is much greater
than their own lives."
The SNCC chairman concluded
his remarks with the hope that
his listeners would "do as much
as possible to make justice a liv
ing reality for all Americans."
