A student government report

I cause "Over the years, parents of
I lowa State students have looked

to the University to maintain a
distinctive educational environ
ment, which we have attempted to
do. We do not necessarily feel we
are "out of step' because some uni
versities have key and/or senior
privileges."
A student committee created
last October 27 had determined on
the basis of a questionnaire that
83 per cent of the women favored
a liberalization of hours and 69
per cent wanted a no-hours policy.
The committee reported that it
felt "the University's present pol
icy of unnecessarily restricting
and sheltering its women stu
dents is not only bothersome but
also severely limits the develop
ment ol these women into ma
ture, confident adults."
Its report was accepted by the
student government on December
15, and was forwarded to the ad
ministration for consideration and
eventual rejection.
One lettei to the ISU Daily com
mented "Does the administration
want ISU to remain in a backward
situation with the rest of the
stereotyped lowa schools, or does
it want 'our' school to come up to
a realistic level with the rest of
the world?"
