## 
### TOM EDISON 
Professional referee Vein Bybee
i noted that tho Stanford boxing
squad "showed more spirit" than
any group of fighters he has
seen, but it nevertheless fell to
the University of Nevada Satur
day, 7-2.
Although the score indicates a
shellacking, the Indians' per
formed valiantly in all but three
bouts. Stanford conceded defeat
i by forfeit in the 125 and 165 lb.
j divisions.
THE HIGHLIGHT for Stan
ford came in the Conti-Parsons
' match which Conti won in less
I than a minuate with one devastat
i ing punch lhat brought the
| packed house of fans to their feet.
Parsons was able to get to his
! feet after an eight count but the
referee stopped the bout.
Three matches were extremely
iclose. One of these, the 147 lb.
I bout, ended in a draw between
! Stanford's George Bellows and
Bill Gurgson. Both boxers were
barely able to hold their gloves up
j towards the end of t he final

round, which saw a determined
Bellows' effort fall just short of
victory. The 178 lb. bout and 139
lb. match between Miller and Diul
los of Nevada were questionable
decisions but nonetheless were
awarded to Nevada.
Stanford's Rudy Oberzan, fight
ing in the 132 lb. division, once
again pleased the crowd with his
speed, agility, and victory. In the
final round Rudy displayed fine
punching and aggressiveness and
ultimately won the match.
THE WILDEST match was the
second 132 lb. bout. Both fighters
began the match throwing wild
punches which served to tire the
boxers but did little harm. To
wards the end of the first round,
Nevada's Lar r y Williamson
landed a couple of solid blows
that sent Craig Ihara to the mat.
The referee stopped the bout
awarding the victory to William
son. Nevada also won the 156 and
178 lb. matches by technical
knockouts.
Referee Vern Bybee who does
most of the refereeing for the
professional bouts in the area
and referees for the regional
Golden Gloves explained the rea
son for stopping the four bouts.
He stops a college bout at the

moment the boxer becomes un
aware of what is going on around
him.
Bybee added, "If these were
professional boxers I would have
let everyone of the bouts continue
but in college bouts I have to look
out more for the safety of the
participants."

shellacking, the Indians' per
formed valiantly in all but three
bouts. Stanford conceded defeat
i by forfeit in the 125 and 165 lb.

! feet after an eight count but the
referee stopped the bout.

iclose. One of these, the 147 lb.
I bout, ended in a draw between
! Stanford's George Bellows and

j towards the end of t he final

second 132 lb. bout. Both fighters
began the match throwing wild
punches which served to tire the
boxers but did little harm. To

Nevada's Lar r y Williamson
landed a couple of solid blows
that sent Craig Ihara to the mat.

Referee Vern Bybee who does
most of the refereeing for the

He stops a college bout at the

moment the boxer becomes un
aware of what is going on around
him.
Bybee added, "If these were
professional boxers I would have
let everyone of the bouts continue
but in college bouts I have to look
out more for the safety of the
participants."
