### 
The Stanford varsity wrestling
team mot two defeats this week
end at the hands of Cal Poly and
Fresno State. Neither meet was
very close and the Indian grap
plers were almost shut out in
their meet with Fresno.
Friday night Cal Poly easily
defeated Stanford 26-10. Stanford
won only two matches. Steve
Schaum (167Â» won by a default
and Cal Poly forfeited the other.
Saturday night Bruce Wilhelm
won his seventh straight match to
keep Stanford from being shut
out. Stanford had to forfeit the
first three matches.
The Frosh wrestlers provided
one bright spot when they soundly
defeated San Fernando Valley
State 29-9. They lost only one fall.
