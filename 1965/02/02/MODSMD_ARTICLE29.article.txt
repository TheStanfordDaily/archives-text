# Some Random Thoughts

The "dissident elements" oil this campus —
and, fortunately, there are a few — have always
operated on the Jeffersonian dictum that the
university, like the larger democracy, should be
rocked to its sandstone foundations every once
in a while if only to shake off the dust.
In this tradition, two and a half years ago, a
small group of students with a few sound ideas
and considerable lung power began the nasty
task of removing a few barnacles from the uni
versity's hull, bit by bit scraping off scabrous
layers of platitudes, apathy, ignorance, and, most
of all, timidity, until at last it seemed that the
university community might begin to be able to
have an unobscured look at its real problems.
At this propitious juncture, however, fate de
creed that there should rise from our midst a
champion of "effectiveness."
Scott Mcßride won the ASS (J presidency by
pledging to operate in "those areas in which stu
dent government could be really effective." He
also pledged to "offer criticism, solutions, and
experimentation . . . dynamic and creative stu
dent government."
With admirable ingenuity, Mr. Mcßride has
managed to make these two pledges mutually
exclusive.
He lias, of course, been effective.
lie hasn't said anything very nasty or done
anything very outrageous. He has a lot of
friends. The incidence of ulcers around limner
Quad is at its lowest point in years.
With admirable humility he has pointed out
that he, in the first weeks of his term, achieved
what Bud Wedin failed to do in an entire year;
and now six members of the student leadership
have unrestricted meal passes to any dorm on
campus.
When nobody rocks the boat, the seas them
selves are calm. It's been a calm half a year.
In his own way, Mcßride is kind of a latter
day Eisenhower figure whose very inactivity may
serve the useful purpose of allowing the liberal
reforms of a previous era the precious time to
become consolidated.
It might also be well to add that Mcßride
is only one of countless numbers of people of
countless generations who have used the argu

ment of "effectiveness" as a rationalization for
timidity.
Alabama lawyer Clifford Diut, a recent guest
at Stanford, had an interesting reply to this ethi
cal trend. Speaking of those Southerners who re
main silent in the face of racial injustice lest they,
too, lose their effectiveness, he said:
We've got the damnedest stockpile of 'effec
tiveness' down there. I mean if all that effec
tiveness ever gets loose it's goin' to be more
devastating than Chiang Kai-shek.
His observation has more than a little rele
vance for Stanford, as docs his definition of a
democracy:
Democracy is based on a gamble—a gamble
that people will find a good way of life; for
themselves if you just allow them to think
an 1 believe and exchange ideas freely.
The university is, or should be, democracy in I
its most intense and freest form. Silence, timid
ity, even order itself are, or should be, anathama
to it, "Rocking the boat is, or should be, its chief
occupation.
Of course, democracy, in the university and
in the nation at large, is imperfect. In the United
States, freedom of thought and expression are;
still qualified by fear, and there is reason to sus-1
pect, in the words of Clifford Durr, that the
"relative abatement" of McCarthyism
is . . . more of a tribute to its accomplish
ment in silencing effective dissent than to a
rededieation to the principles of our Bill of
Rights.
Silence can only be broken, by a shout. The
slender but precious achievements of the past
few years at Stanford have always been initiated
by an explosion which, in one mighty blast,
cleared away the dead wood. Without the Frank
Morse case one suspects that Dean Wert's com
mittee on judicial reform would have been a long !
time coming.
In short, more often than not effectiveness
demands courage. It demands "sticking your I
neck out. And, as professor Robert Sears pointed i
out in a recent Stanford Today article, "It's O.K. ;
to stick your neck out; it's good exercise for the!
head."
