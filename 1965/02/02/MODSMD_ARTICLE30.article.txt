## Sterling Uses Wishful Thinking 
### 
Dear Sir:
The serious inaccuracies in fac
tual detail in President Sterling's
recent speech have, I think, been
dealt with effectively in the reply
issued by the Graduate Student
Coordinating Committee. I should
like to take up another feature of
this talk which disturbs me deeply
and on which, I hope, Mr. Sterling
will find cause to reflect. As I
understood the excerpts published
in The Daily (Jan. 14), one of his
main assertions was:
"I see in the events at Berkeley
an element that is not. concerned
merely with free speech or with
judicial process or with personal
izing a university: this element
is one of disruption and is, in its
essence, as undemocratic as can
be. I have no way of measuring
it. but I am persuaded that it ex
ists."
It seems to me Mr. Sterling is
reasoning by wishful thinking. In
the absence of evidence that there
has been,"disruption" on the Ber
keley campus, it is difficult to
support the view that the actions
of the ESM were undemocratic or
not concerned with legitimate stu
dent interests. The wish that the
students have been misled by "dis
ruptive elements" is therefouc
converted by a facile rationaliza
tion into seeming reality.
Mr. Sterling is of course en
titled to his private view, and he
may form it in any way he
pleases, however, as president of
a distinguished University, he
has, I think, an obligation to base
conclusions expressed in official
speeches on objective evidence
which in some reasonable sense
can be measured.
In the present case may I ex
press the hope that Mr. Sterling's
declarations are not intended as a
basis for University policy in deal
ing with dissident students. The
ha/nrrls implicit in such a course

may bo illustrated by some pos
sible consequences of the method
when applied to more familiar
situations. Example: Students X
and Y have written papers which
on some points are very similar. X
is a sulky and unpleasant fellow
who strikes me as the sort of
person who would cheat. I have
no way of proving this, but I am
persuaded that he did. I'd better
give him a D.
Or on a larger scale: Jews and
Negroes are inferior species who
are threatening by interbreeding
the purity and nobility of our citi
zens. I have no way of measuring
this, but I am persuaded it is the
case. Such people must be re
moved to protect the racial integ
rity of our nation.
These examples, although not
without historical precedent, are
out of context with our lime, and
obviously Mr. Sterling would not
wish for the sort of things .just
described. Apparently, however,
the substitution of wishes for
reality is still being practiced as
a method of reasoning.
I hope its present day conse
quences will appear to future gen
erations less absurd and unjust
than the above examples now do
to most of us.

in which both men and women
students will reside. . . . After
most careful enquiries regarding j
the experience of other Univer
sities . . . with respect to mixed I
halls of residence, the Board came :
unanimously to the view that this '
type of college better serves the
needs of a modern university I
than the monastic-ally segregated
institutions which arc more tra- j
ditionally found upon a university ;
campus. Though there are still
those who predict that mixed col
leges will lead to moral laxity, il
is hard to see how they provide
any greater opportunity in the
modern world than is provided ;
by the motor car and other fea--!
lures of our present civilization. .
Experience has shown that in fact
behaviour in the mixed colleges i
is better than that in the scgre- :
gated colleges and that men and
women student alike benefit from
this association together during j
their student years. ..."
