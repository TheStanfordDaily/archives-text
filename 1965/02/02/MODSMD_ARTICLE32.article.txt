men helping smokers break their
habit. The Clinic is a free public
service deserving the support of
every conscientious persoa on
campus, but The Daily has per
sisted in adopting an attitude of !
childish ridicule and satire. The j
articles have been filled with mis y
quotes, half truths, and generally |
inefficient reporting.
Was it worth it for the laughs? j
