# Rand Student Discusses The Objectivist Morality
## 
### BETH STEVENS 
The motive and purpose of the
writing of Ayn Rand is, in h e r
words, "the projection of ideal
man," according to Conrad Sank
till, who presented u short speech |
on the topic "Literary Signifi-1
cance of the Writings of Ayn
Rand" at a meeting of the Ayn !
Rand Cultural Society in Tresid- i
der last night.
Sanktill, a student of Miss

Rand's objectivist philosophy, de
scribed her as a romantic realist:
a romantic in that her writing
deals with metaphysical values,
and realistic in that these values
pertain to man and his physical
environment.
FOLLOWING Sanktill's sketch
of the literary importance of Miss
Rand's work .the meeting was
thrown open for discussion of
objectivism, the revolutionary
philosophy of which Miss Rand
is the architect and major spokes
woman.
In Atlas Sliniffgt'd, her latest
major novel, she presents the
question: What makes human sur
vival possible? and states as the
answer a morality of rational self
interest, a morality whose basic
value is the propagation of the
life of man qua man. In other
words, taking as a premise t li e
assumption that man's only tool
of survival is his reason and that
his choice of consciousness or un
consciousness, of whether or not
to use that tool, is a choice be
tween life and death, it follows
that in order to survive man must
determine rationally the nature of
his individual self-interest and act
to further it.
In such works ;is Anthem and
Wc The Living Miss Rand has
demonstrated the irrationality of
the collectivist society. Her better
known novels, The Fountainmul
and Atlas Shruuucd, explore the
problem of individual fulfillment,
