# ASS Group To Compile Judicial Book
## Past Violations To Aid Decisions 
### 
Stanford's student judicial sys
tem, whatever form it may take
after Ihe current drive for reor
ganization has run its course,
should eventually have its own
case book on stud en t judicial
cases and precedents.
The ASSU Fundamental Stan
dard and Honor Code Commis
sion, in close cooperation with the
Judicial Council, has embarked
on a research project which
should make such a tractable col
lection of past cases' on Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code
violations available to the student
judiciary, making feasible more
reasoned and more authoritative
decisions.
According to the Commission's
chairman, Berndt Lohr-Schmidt,
this project is a first in the realm
of student judicial action on the
Stanford campus. Preparation of
the first such collection is ex
pected to take the remainder of
the school year.
Fundamental Standard Com
mission underwent an extensive
organizational change in last
quarter's legislature session, and
the present commission consists
of thirteen members, six of which
are selected through interview.
The Commission will hold in
terviews next Monday in order to
fill the few remaining vacancies.
Students with interests in analyti
cal writing and student judicial
procedure are encouraged to sign
up in the ASSU Office.
