## 
### JIM HAUSER 
John Lewis, national chairman ot the Student Non-violent Co
ordinating Committee, speaks with a slow and quiet force, but
moves with nervous quickness.
lie arrived here yesterday afternoon dressed in a dark blue
sport coat and dark trousers, a black tie with subdued stripes and

a SNCC "One Man, One Vote"*
button on his left lapel.
He had been released from an
Alabama jail Saturday, flown to a
San Francisco SNCC meeting
Sunday night and delivered a
speech here yesterday afternoon.
Today he continues north to Sac
ramento, Seattle, and Portland,
and then back to tho Alabama
demonstrations for voter registra
tion.
"We haven't slept in three days,"
Danny Benson, chairman of the
San Francisco regional SNCC
Office, said.
Lewis, 25, is making the speak
ing tour to aid local SNCC groups
in fund-raising drives and volun
teer recruitment. SNCC has al
ready expanded its voter registra
tion drive in Alabama, Lewis said,
and may help organize a second
and broader Summer Project, sim
ilar to last summer's Mississippi

Project. The new operation would '
cover several southern states, pre-!
sumably Georgia and Alabama.
Lewis, an at hletic, handsome |
man, said that civil rights work-1
ers in Selma, Alabama, are ex
panding voter registration drives i
from Dallas county to four other j
surrounding counties.
The SNCC chairman said th a t j
civil rights leaders would meet!
February 12, 13, and 14 to decide 1
on plans for northern civil rights
workers to register voters and
operate freedom schools in Geor- 1
gia, Alabama, and Mississippi this j
summer.
"I think the Summer Project in
Mississippi was a tremendous!
success," Lewis said. "The fact!
that whit e people came down
from the North gave the Misssis
sippi Negroes a feeling of hope."
"If one group (the Negroes)
can stand up to that authority, the
dissatisfied whites, 'the silent ele- j
ment,' may begin to protest the!
actions of the more extreme I
groups," Lewis said.
What work in Mississippi may
also work in other states. "We
want to emphasize voter registra
tion and the need for more volun
teer workers," the young chair-1
man said.
In Mississippi, Lewis noted,
many white businessmen have
converted their businesses into
private clubs to escape the juris
diction of the Civil Rights Law.
Lewis believes that these moves
will hurt the whites more than 1
the Negroes.
"The idea of private clubs is
not popular in Mississippi. There j
are very few country clubs. Th e .
inconvenience may help push the,
white "silent element" into a|
vocal and more moderate posi
tion," Lewis said.
Lewis said the expansion in :
civil rights activity will be ac i
companied by a change in term in- j
ology. "Instead of the Mississippi j
Project, we are going to be talk
ing about something we call the
'Black Belt'," he explained.
The Black Belt, he said, consists i
of Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama. I
and South Carolina. Voting rights, j
Lewis believes, are the key t<>
breaking the Black Belt, afi d j
breaking the Black Belt is the key ;
to changing the white man's atti-j
tudc toward the Negro.

"The idea of private clubs is
not popular in Mississippi. There j
are very few country clubs. Th e .
inconvenience may help push the,

vocal and more moderate posi

Lewis said the expansion in :
civil rights activity will be ac i
companied by a change in term in- j
ology. "Instead of the Mississippi j
Project, we are going to be talk

of Mississippi, Georgia, Alabama. I

John Lewis, national chairman ot the Student Non-violent Co
ordinating Committee, speaks with a slow and quiet force, but
moves with nervous quickness.
lie arrived here yesterday afternoon dressed in a dark blue
sport coat and dark trousers, a black tie with subdued stripes and

a SNCC "One Man, One Vote"*
button on his left lapel.
He had been released from an
Alabama jail Saturday, flown to a
San Francisco SNCC meeting
Sunday night and delivered a
speech here yesterday afternoon.
Today he continues north to Sac
ramento, Seattle, and Portland,
and then back to tho Alabama
demonstrations for voter registra
tion.
"We haven't slept in three days,"
Danny Benson, chairman of the
San Francisco regional SNCC
Office, said.
Lewis, 25, is making the speak
ing tour to aid local SNCC groups
in fund-raising drives and volun
teer recruitment. SNCC has al
ready expanded its voter registra
tion drive in Alabama, Lewis said,
and may help organize a second
and broader Summer Project, sim
ilar to last summer's Mississippi

Project. The new operation would '
cover several southern states, pre-!
sumably Georgia and Alabama.
Lewis, an at hletic, handsome |
man, said that civil rights work-1
ers in Selma, Alabama, are ex
panding voter registration drives i
from Dallas county to four other j
surrounding counties.
The SNCC chairman said th a t j
civil rights leaders would meet!
February 12, 13, and 14 to decide 1
on plans for northern civil rights
workers to register voters and
operate freedom schools in Geor- 1
gia, Alabama, and Mississippi this j
summer.
"I think the Summer Project in
Mississippi was a tremendous!
success," Lewis said. "The fact!
that whit e people came down
from the North gave the Misssis
sippi Negroes a feeling of hope."
"If one group (the Negroes)
can stand up to that authority, the
dissatisfied whites, 'the silent ele- j
ment,' may begin to protest the!
actions of the more extreme I
groups," Lewis said.
What work in Mississippi may
also work in other states. "We
want to emphasize voter registra
tion and the need for more volun
teer workers," the young chair-1
man said.
In Mississippi, Lewis noted,
many white businessmen have
converted their businesses into
private clubs to escape the juris
diction of the Civil Rights Law.
Lewis believes that these moves
will hurt the whites more than 1
the Negroes.
