# Sterling Challenges Fraternities
## Urges Members To Meet Goals 
### BILL WERTZ MIKE ROSTER 
President Wallace Sterling said
yesterday Stanford fraternities
have a challenge to meet.
In a speech at the I liter-Fra
ternity Council banquet Sterling
urged fraternities to continue to
meet their responsibilities. "Any
element of any institution m us t
justify its existence. If it cannot,"
he said, "it should not exist."
Sterling then listed three cri
teria by which fraternities could
make this justification:
• Maintain high standards of
academic performance;
• Keep high standards of per
sonal conduct;
• Show respect and care for
private property.
He asked each fraternity to ap
ply these criteria to its situation
to see if it was meeting the chal
lenge.
STANFORD'S highly competi
tive entrance requirements make
it possible for the student body to
contain the finest men and wom
en in the nation, Sterling said.
Fraternity rush, he noted, al
lows "double or successive selec
tion," giving fraternities an op
portunity to select "the cream
of the crop."
This, he said, gives fraternities
an unexampled and unparalleled
opportunity for responsible lead
ership.
"I HAVK been greatly heart
ened by the way in which Stan
ford fraternities have been meet
ing this responsibility," Sterling
said.
However, ho said, this responsi
bility must be continued. "Each
individual has to set for himself
his own standards and learn how
to get those standards into ac
tion."
Sterling said he had certain
preferences as to how fraternities
could meet the challenge.
STANFORD'S body of custom
must be respected, he emphasized.
Although rules should be
brought up for revision an d
change .they must be followed
while they are in effect.
Criticism should be made with
good humor and without arro
ga nee.
He said fraternities must also
realize their limitations. Not to
ask for guidance and help when it
is needed is "unpardonable con
ceit and folly."
