# Signs of the Times

### 
Prophets who announce the end of the world are popularly depicted in
cartoons as bearded eccentrics standing on street corners. For two thousand
years Christians have looked forward expecantly to the promised return of
the Lord Jesus Christ. While it is true that no one knows the year or the hour
of His second coming (Matthew 24:36), the return of the Jews to Palestine
(Ezekial 34:11-13), and the world wide spread of the Gospel (Matthew
24:14) are significant signs of the times: the end of the age could be near!
Note also these words of Jesus Christ: But as the days of Noah were,
so shall the coming of the Son of man be. For as in the days that were before
the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage,
until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood
came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
Then two shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. Two
women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken and the other
left. Watch therefore: For you know not what hour your Lord will come"
(Matthew 23:37-44).
In rich and vivid symbolism the last book of the Bible describes that
great event in the future when the heavens will open and in splendor and
majesty the Lord Jesus Christ will return:
"And I saw heaven opened; and behold, a white horse, and He who
sat upon it is called Faithful and True; and in righteousness He judges and
wages war. And His eyes are a flame of fire and upon His head are many
diaderns; and He has a name written upon Him which no man knows except
Himself. And He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood; and His name is
called the Word of God. And the armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine
linen, white and clean, were following Him on white horses. And from His
mouth there comes a sharp sword, so that He may smite the nations; and He
will rule them with a rod of iron,- and He treads the winepress of the wrath
of God, the Almighty. And on His robes and on His thigh He has a name
written, KINK OF KINGS, and LORD OF LORDS" (Revelation 19:11-16).
As all of human history moves inescapably/ towards that event called
the "unveiling" or revelation" of Jesus Christ, so does the life of every
individual move towards his face-to-face meeting with his Creator. Those
who know Jesus Christ will meet Him as Savior and Friend; all others will
meet Him as Holy Judge (2 Thessalonians 1:5-12)â€” Therefore you owe it to
yourself to meet Jesus Christ, King of Kings and Lord of Lords now. The signs
of the times indicate you should not postpone nor neglect this most important of
all decisions you will ever make. Be with Him, not against Him, when He
returns to rule.
