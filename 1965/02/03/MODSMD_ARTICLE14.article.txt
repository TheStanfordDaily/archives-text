# Wrestling On Upswing Here

### JACK GASKILL 
(First of Two Parts)
A little over a year ago, I at
tended my first wrestling match
at Stanford and I vividly recall
the size of the crowd that was
"packed" into the Pavilion to
watch. A liberal estimate would
place the number of spectators
between 30 and 10. At oilier
matches last year, the same story
was repealed time and time again.
So far this year, there appears to
he considerable more spectator
interest in wrestling, but if is
still not nearly what it should be.
Why this lack of interest? Is it
because wrestling has little spec
tator appeal? 1 think not, as a few
examples may indicate. Several
years ago, when I participated in
1 his sport at Colorado State Uni
versity, we often drew crowds of
a few hundred for our li o m e
matches. For one of our dual
matches with lowa State Univer
sity, approximately 1,000 fans
filled the Armory on the Ames

campus to watch. Each year when
Oklahoma State and the Univer
sity of Oklahoma meet at Still
water, approximately 8,000 spec
tators jam into OSU's Gallagher
Hall to observe.
Admittedly, these last three
teams have been the top three
; teams in the country for the past
jseven or eight years, but the
above examples show that wres
tling does have spectator appeal.
It is a very popular sport
i throughout the nation's high
; schools and most of the nation's
colleges, but with the exception of
perhaps the Oregon and Washing
; ton schools, il has failed to catch
, on at the major universities along
1 1he coast.
One contributing factor in the
| slow development at Stanford is
I lack of facilities. For example,
; there is only one mat for the en
tire team to use in practice, both
frosh and varsity. My old hi g h
I school has twice this much mat
| space.

Another factor which has no
doubt contributed to a lack of in
| terest at Stanford is a misunder
standing of what wrestling is all
about. Collegiate wrestling should
j not be confused with professional
WTestling, which can hardly be
classified as a sport.
Professional wrestling, with its
j golden-locked, silken-robed good
! guys and its hairy, villianous bad
j guys, is a complete farce and is
| similar to collegiate wrestling
only in name. On the other hand,
collegiate wrestling, which is es
sentially the same as high school
wrestling, is a fine sport which
requires skill, brains, and most of
all, superb physical conditioning.
Many peoplo automatically
think of a Charles Atlas type
when they hear the word wres
i tier. While muscles certainly don't
j hinder, they are by no means the
! entire requirement. Speed, maneu-

verability, and conditioning are
just as important.
Wrestling also takes guts. It is
an individual sport, and each par
ticipant is out on the mat without
the rest of his teammates and
without that comforting feeling
that goes vvilh numbers. Many
times it would be so easy to give
up, to not put out that last little
bit ol effort to keep from getting
taken down, reversed, or pinned.
Bui the true wrestler never gives
up. even when hopelessly behind.
GOAL IS riN
The ultimate goal in wrestling
is to force your opponent's shoul
ders to the mat for u period of one
second, thus scoring a fall or pin.
If neither wrestler scores a fall,
the winner is decided by a point
scoring system which is explained
below. A normal match is nine
minutes in length, being made up
of three, three-minute periods.
The first period is started w i th
both wrestlers on their feet, while
the second and third periods
start with the contestants down
on the mat in "referee's position."
Points may be scored for take
downs. reversals, escapes, predica
ments, near falls, and riding time.
A take down is scored when a
contestant brings his opponent to
the mat from a standing or neu
tral position and gains control. A
reversal occurs when the defen
sive (bottom i wrestler comes
from underneath and gains con
trol, while for an escape the de
fensive wrestler comes from un
derneath and gains a neutral posi
tion.
Near falls and predicaments
are scored when a contestant
forces his opponent's shoulders
into a position very close to the
mat for a specified time (one or
two seconds) while in control.

ti:am scokinc;
Team scoring is handled as fol
lows: A team receives five points
for each fall, forfeit or default,
three points for a win by a deci
sion, and no points for a loss. In
Ihe case of a draw, each team re
ceives two points.
Team scores can be very decep
tive. For example, if a team lost
all eight weight divisions by indi
vidual scores of ten to nine, the
team score would be twenty-four
to zero. This would not be an ac
curate description of the action
that actually took place.
Also, a team's dual meet perfor
mance does not really indicate
how good that team might do in
a tournament. If a team had three
outstanding wrestlers and five
very poor wrestlers, they might
never win a dual meet. On th e
other hand, those three outstand
ing fellows might be good enough
so that the team could win almost
any tournament that came along.

contestant brings his opponent to
the mat from a standing or neu
tral position and gains control. A
reversal occurs when the defen
sive (bottom i wrestler comes
from underneath and gains con
trol, while for an escape the de
fensive wrestler comes from un
derneath and gains a neutral posi
tion.
Near falls and predicaments
are scored when a contestant
forces his opponent's shoulders
into a position very close to the
mat for a specified time (one or
two seconds) while in control.

Team scoring is handled as fol
lows: A team receives five points
for each fall, forfeit or default,
three points for a win by a deci
sion, and no points for a loss. In
Ihe case of a draw, each team re
ceives two points.
Team scores can be very decep
tive. For example, if a team lost
all eight weight divisions by indi
vidual scores of ten to nine, the
team score would be twenty-four
to zero. This would not be an ac
curate description of the action
that actually took place.
Also, a team's dual meet perfor
mance does not really indicate
how good that team might do in
a tournament. If a team had three
outstanding wrestlers and five
very poor wrestlers, they might
never win a dual meet. On th e
other hand, those three outstand
ing fellows might be good enough
so that the team could win almost
any tournament that came along.

A little over a year ago, I at
tended my first wrestling match
at Stanford and I vividly recall
the size of the crowd that was
"packed" into the Pavilion to
watch. A liberal estimate would
place the number of spectators
between 30 and 10. At oilier
matches last year, the same story
was repealed time and time again.
So far this year, there appears to
he considerable more spectator
interest in wrestling, but if is
still not nearly what it should be.
Why this lack of interest? Is it
because wrestling has little spec
tator appeal? 1 think not, as a few
examples may indicate. Several
years ago, when I participated in
1 his sport at Colorado State Uni
versity, we often drew crowds of
a few hundred for our li o m e
matches. For one of our dual
matches with lowa State Univer
sity, approximately 1,000 fans
filled the Armory on the Ames

campus to watch. Each year when
Oklahoma State and the Univer
sity of Oklahoma meet at Still
water, approximately 8,000 spec
tators jam into OSU's Gallagher
Hall to observe.
Admittedly, these last three
teams have been the top three
; teams in the country for the past
jseven or eight years, but the
above examples show that wres
tling does have spectator appeal.
It is a very popular sport
i throughout the nation's high
; schools and most of the nation's
colleges, but with the exception of
perhaps the Oregon and Washing
; ton schools, il has failed to catch
, on at the major universities along
1 1he coast.
One contributing factor in the
| slow development at Stanford is
I lack of facilities. For example,
; there is only one mat for the en
tire team to use in practice, both
frosh and varsity. My old hi g h
I school has twice this much mat

Another factor which has no
doubt contributed to a lack of in
| terest at Stanford is a misunder
standing of what wrestling is all
about. Collegiate wrestling should
j not be confused with professional
WTestling, which can hardly be
classified as a sport.
Professional wrestling, with its
j golden-locked, silken-robed good
! guys and its hairy, villianous bad
j guys, is a complete farce and is
| similar to collegiate wrestling
only in name. On the other hand,
collegiate wrestling, which is es
sentially the same as high school
wrestling, is a fine sport which
requires skill, brains, and most of
all, superb physical conditioning.
Many peoplo automatically
think of a Charles Atlas type
when they hear the word wres
i tier. While muscles certainly don't
j hinder, they are by no means the
! entire requirement. Speed, maneu-

verability, and conditioning are
just as important.
Wrestling also takes guts. It is
an individual sport, and each par
ticipant is out on the mat without
the rest of his teammates and
without that comforting feeling
that goes vvilh numbers. Many
times it would be so easy to give
up, to not put out that last little
bit ol effort to keep from getting
taken down, reversed, or pinned.
Bui the true wrestler never gives
up. even when hopelessly behind.
GOAL IS riN
The ultimate goal in wrestling
is to force your opponent's shoul
ders to the mat for u period of one
second, thus scoring a fall or pin.
If neither wrestler scores a fall,
the winner is decided by a point
scoring system which is explained
below. A normal match is nine
minutes in length, being made up
of three, three-minute periods.
The first period is started w i th
both wrestlers on their feet, while
the second and third periods
start with the contestants down
on the mat in "referee's position."
Points may be scored for take

all, superb physical conditioning.
Many peoplo automatically
think of a Charles Atlas type
when they hear the word wres
i tier. While muscles certainly don't
j hinder, they are by no means the
! entire requirement. Speed, maneu-

verability, and conditioning are
just as important.
Wrestling also takes guts. It is
an individual sport, and each par
ticipant is out on the mat without
the rest of his teammates and
without that comforting feeling
that goes vvilh numbers. Many
times it would be so easy to give
up, to not put out that last little
bit ol effort to keep from getting
taken down, reversed, or pinned.
Bui the true wrestler never gives
up. even when hopelessly behind.
GOAL IS riN
The ultimate goal in wrestling
is to force your opponent's shoul
ders to the mat for u period of one
second, thus scoring a fall or pin.
If neither wrestler scores a fall,
the winner is decided by a point
scoring system which is explained
below. A normal match is nine
minutes in length, being made up
of three, three-minute periods.
The first period is started w i th
both wrestlers on their feet, while
the second and third periods
start with the contestants down
on the mat in "referee's position."
Points may be scored for take
downs. reversals, escapes, predica
ments, near falls, and riding time.
A take down is scored when a
contestant brings his opponent to
the mat from a standing or neu
tral position and gains control. A
reversal occurs when the defen
sive (bottom i wrestler comes
from underneath and gains con
trol, while for an escape the de
fensive wrestler comes from un
derneath and gains a neutral posi
tion.
Near falls and predicaments
are scored when a contestant
forces his opponent's shoulders
into a position very close to the
mat for a specified time (one or
two seconds) while in control.

ti:am scokinc;
Team scoring is handled as fol
lows: A team receives five points
for each fall, forfeit or default,
three points for a win by a deci
sion, and no points for a loss. In
Ihe case of a draw, each team re
ceives two points.
Team scores can be very decep
tive. For example, if a team lost
all eight weight divisions by indi
vidual scores of ten to nine, the
team score would be twenty-four
to zero. This would not be an ac
curate description of the action
that actually took place.
Also, a team's dual meet perfor
mance does not really indicate
how good that team might do in
a tournament. If a team had three
outstanding wrestlers and five
very poor wrestlers, they might
never win a dual meet. On th e
other hand, those three outstand
ing fellows might be good enough
so that the team could win almost
any tournament that came along.

A little over a year ago, I at
tended my first wrestling match
at Stanford and I vividly recall
the size of the crowd that was
"packed" into the Pavilion to
watch. A liberal estimate would
place the number of spectators
between 30 and 10. At oilier
matches last year, the same story
was repealed time and time again.
So far this year, there appears to
he considerable more spectator
interest in wrestling, but if is
still not nearly what it should be.
Why this lack of interest? Is it
because wrestling has little spec
tator appeal? 1 think not, as a few
examples may indicate. Several
years ago, when I participated in
1 his sport at Colorado State Uni
versity, we often drew crowds of
a few hundred for our li o m e
matches. For one of our dual
matches with lowa State Univer
sity, approximately 1,000 fans
filled the Armory on the Ames

campus to watch. Each year when
Oklahoma State and the Univer
sity of Oklahoma meet at Still
water, approximately 8,000 spec
tators jam into OSU's Gallagher
Hall to observe.
Admittedly, these last three
teams have been the top three
; teams in the country for the past
jseven or eight years, but the
above examples show that wres
tling does have spectator appeal.
It is a very popular sport
i throughout the nation's high
; schools and most of the nation's
colleges, but with the exception of
perhaps the Oregon and Washing
; ton schools, il has failed to catch
, on at the major universities along
1 1he coast.
One contributing factor in the
| slow development at Stanford is
I lack of facilities. For example,
; there is only one mat for the en
tire team to use in practice, both
frosh and varsity. My old hi g h
I school has twice this much mat
| space.

Another factor which has no
doubt contributed to a lack of in
| terest at Stanford is a misunder
standing of what wrestling is all
about. Collegiate wrestling should
j not be confused with professional
WTestling, which can hardly be
classified as a sport.
Professional wrestling, with its
j golden-locked, silken-robed good
! guys and its hairy, villianous bad
j guys, is a complete farce and is
| similar to collegiate wrestling
only in name. On the other hand,
collegiate wrestling, which is es
sentially the same as high school
wrestling, is a fine sport which
requires skill, brains, and most of
