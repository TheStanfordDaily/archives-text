## University ROTC Courses Should Be Open For Audit 
### 
Dear S:: 1 :
Stanford should make some
changes in its Military and Naval
Science Departments. As aca
demic departments, these organi
zations use university buildings,
grounds, and especially communi
cations; and grant academic and
activity credits. Yet these depart

ments offer virtually nothing to
that large proportion of the stu
dent body unwilling to sign away
five years of what promise to be
the best years of their lives. The
only way a student can qualify
for ROTC courses and activities
is by becoming an ROTC candi
date. Auditing of ROTC courses

is forbidden in all cases on th e
grounds that this would deprive
ROTC candidates of needed atten
tion. The rest of the university
leaves the acceptance of auditors
to the discretion of the individual
instructor, thus each case can be
judged on its own merits. Yet (he
military organizations feel com
pelled to issue an inflexible rule,
based on a generalization which
seems neither accurate nor fair.
Although many ROTC courses
are considered "Mickey Mouse,"
some are reputed to be very
worthwhile. An example of this
is a course in Military Law which
many students have expressed a
desire to enroll in. In any case,
removing the restrictions to en
rolling in ROTC would give more
students a chance to gain an in
side understanding of an institu
tion which, for better or worse,
is a very important part of our
world, yet too often hidden from
view by security regulations, an
institution in which a large pro
portion of u.s will be compelled
by lav/ to spend several years.
The purpose of Liberal Educa
tion is to give an understanding
of Human Society. Since the mili
tary establishment is an impor
tant part of Human Society a lib
eral university must help its stu
dents to understand it. As a first
step towards meeting this respon
sibility Stanford should open
ROTC courses to all students
without attaching a military obli
gation.
