## Bud Wedin's Philosophy Is Now Being Forgotten 
### Justin Beck 
During his term of office ASSU President Bud Wedin was
called humorously "The Philosopher King" because of his continu
ous interest in finding a philosophical base for action.
Last spring, in his final address as student body president,
Wedin gave his impressions of the University, suggesting that the

University Community at Stan-"
ford "is not a community at all,
but a system of relationships
within a rather segmented so
ciety, a system in which students
often are not really seen as a
part of the University but merely
as 'guests-in-residence.' "
Unfortunately his successor,
Scott Mcßride, has contented him
self with occupying the presi
dent's office and has let Wedin
keep his philosophy with the re
sult that the questions raised by
Wedin have not been pursued,
much less answered.
Comments Still Valid
Although Wedin last spoke to
the campus six months ago, his
comments on the relationship of
the student within the University
Community are still all too valid.
Wedin was concerned with the
effects of the growth of the Uni
versity on the students. "In fact,"
he said, "judging from many offi
cial documents of the University,
students are set apart from that
object which, for lack of a more
definite term, is called the 'Uni
versity.'
"According to a policy of the
Trustees, any student may be re
moved 'who fails to abide by Uni
versity regulations, or whose so
cial conduct, personal habits or
moral character are deemed detri
mental by the University.' Univer
sity regulations apply to social
rules, to off-campus conduct, to
women's hours, to the formation
of voluntary student groups, to
individual house speaker pro
grams, to open houses, to the stu
dent Legislature 'speaking out' on
off-campus issues, to student
demonstrations, and to group
worship services—to name only a
few.
Kules Necessary
"Certainly any community must
be governed by rules which assure
its stability and continued exist
ence. Generally, however, they are
the products of the entire commu
nity. The Board of Trustees can
not mean that these student regu
lations were drawn up by stu

dents, for this is not the case.
Neither can they mean that the
faculty was their source. Rather,
i this role in the University Com
i munity seems to have been rele
| gated to an administrative func-
I tiop.
"... To live within a frame
work of values and standards set
| by others is to arbitrarily limit
i the building material for our own
framework. And education is not
built upon the careful limitation
of values and principles; rather,
it is built upon quite the opposite.
All too often the framework has
: been drawn all too narrowly."
Lost Vision
; After pointing out that the
; Stanford community is no longer
I a community, Wedin said, "We
! have taken a great deal of toler
ance and understanding from this
community and replaced it with
skill and efficiency. Too often we
have regarded the individual as
an object and have seen him only
; in relation to rules or regulations,
j In short, we seem to have lost the
i vision of a 'democratic university
in which all share certain rights
of participation in matters of
common concern, and of freedom
of inquiry association, and devel
opment. and where paternalism is
replaced by fellowship in the com
pany of scholars.' "
Wedin said what he was ask
ing for was a "reworking of the
concept of the University Commu
nity at Stanford."
"Perhaps it is time to review
some of the institutions of our
society at Stanford," he con
cluded, "to see if we are really
doing our utmost to produce stu
dents with the intellectual matur
ity, the self-assurance, and the
sense of dignity and independence
so needed in today's society. This
requires a new viewpoint toward
the s tude nt in the University
Community; it requires that he
be given a new respect and dig
nity. If this can be secured, we
may yet gain the 'Far Side of
Utopia.' "
