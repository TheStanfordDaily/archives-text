# Cagey Assistant Dean Takes 'Hoop' Contest
## 
### JOCK LEOPOLD 
Kill Friedrichs, Assistant
Dean of Men, won a free
round-trip ticket to Los An
geles in the latest Stanford
Daily-Pacific Southwest Air
lines Kaskethall Contest.
Although it was Friedrichs'
first effort at such a contest,
it wasn't his first contact
with the name. The
old administrator played some
form of organized basketball
until last year when lie moved
to Stanford.
And he would like to take
it up again. "Kaskethall is a
hard game to keep in shape
for," the bespectacled father
of two admitted, "but there
really ought to be a faculty
team —or teams —here.
"We've got enough young
faculty members to form a
good team, at least a team
good enough to take on the
TA's, if not some of the in
tramural squads."
Art (Suerra, assistant direc
tor of the Intramural Depart
ment, said any such faculty
squads would be welcomed
additions to th e present
league.
If enough professors could
be separated from their Me
treeal, they would have an ex
perieneed leader in Friedrichs.
At 6'3" he was a center 011
Lowell II ig h School's All
Northern California cham
pion quintet.
When he came to Stanford

for undergraduate and gradu
ate study, Friedrichs played
frosh ball and intramurals
while winning four letters in
track. Later, in San Fran
cisco industrial leagues, he
discovered that "good, hard
fought basketball" was not
just an undergraduate mo
nopoly.
"We went through pre-sea
son practices to get in shape
and then played once a week
for several months," he re
called.
Last A 11 g 11 st, Friedrichs
started as Assistant Dean and
since then he hasn't played
any more basketball. Nor, un
til last week, had he entered
any Daily football or basket
ball contests.
"I just happened to look at
it. Since I knew all the teams
involved, and since it didn't
look too tough, I thought I'd
try it."
Seven other students wish
he hadn't. Patsy Haghom,
Christine Hoover, Susan Tip
pett, Brenda Muir, Tom Tour
ville, Harry Kellogg, and M.
E. Kahn ail picked the eight
games correctly, but Fried
richs was closest in guessing
the score of Saturday night's

"I just happened to look at
it. Since I knew all the teams
involved, and since it didn't
look too tough, I thought I'd
try it."

Kill Friedrichs, Assistant
Dean of Men, won a free
round-trip ticket to Los An
geles in the latest Stanford
Daily-Pacific Southwest Air
lines Kaskethall Contest.
Although it was Friedrichs'
first effort at such a contest,
it wasn't his first contact
with the name. The
old administrator played some
form of organized basketball
until last year when lie moved
to Stanford.
And he would like to take
it up again. "Kaskethall is a
hard game to keep in shape
for," the bespectacled father
of two admitted, "but there
really ought to be a faculty
team —or teams —here.
"We've got enough young
faculty members to form a
good team, at least a team
good enough to take on the
TA's, if not some of the in
tramural squads."
Art (Suerra, assistant direc
tor of the Intramural Depart
ment, said any such faculty
squads would be welcomed
additions to th e present
league.
If enough professors could
be separated from their Me
treeal, they would have an ex
perieneed leader in Friedrichs.
At 6'3" he was a center 011
Lowell II ig h School's All
Northern California cham
pion quintet.
When he came to Stanford

for undergraduate and gradu
ate study, Friedrichs played
frosh ball and intramurals
while winning four letters in
track. Later, in San Fran
cisco industrial leagues, he
discovered that "good, hard
fought basketball" was not
just an undergraduate mo
nopoly.
"We went through pre-sea
son practices to get in shape
and then played once a week
for several months," he re
called.
Last A 11 g 11 st, Friedrichs
started as Assistant Dean and
since then he hasn't played
any more basketball. Nor, un
til last week, had he entered
any Daily football or basket
ball contests.
