## McNamara's Efficiency No Excuse For Insensitivity 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Mr. Robert McNamara could not nowadays he elected platoon
leader in any unit lie bosses as Secretary of Defense. The reasons
why arc both to his credit and to his discredit. He does have an
eye for efficiency and economy, for which all taxpayers can be
grateful. It was he primarily who made the decision to close the

obsolete bases, and did so more
over knowing very well the tu
multuous storms that would rage
about his head. Even so, he stuck
by his decision, and, who knows,
the day may come when
I I he Brooklyn Navy Yard will ac-
I tually close down.
But the Secretary of Defense
i operates in a mode which is more
| than simply alien to the ways of
! the practical politician (for which
j he should receive a Congressional
I Medal of Honor). He operates
| with a ruthless disdain for other
; people's feelings, and for o th e r
j people's expertise, to use a word
j he sometimes seems to believe
was coined in honor of himself.
Our Outfit Right or Wrong
Almost three hundred thousand
; men will be affected by Mr. Mc
i Namara's decision to abolish the
i Reserve. It is cynical to suppose
that every one of them is exclu
sively concerned with esprit, de
corps, that every one of them re
acts against the Secretary even as
; the workers at the Brooklyn Navy
Yard reacted—our outfit right or
| wrong. Some people believe he is
committing a grave military blun
der that jeopardizes the highest
i standards of American security.
But Secretary McNamara an
nouneed his decision, as is his
habit, as a fait accompli, in utter
disregard even of the formality
that it is the business of Congress
to decide whether or not to abol
ish a military conception ordained
by Congress in 1920—one which
has rendered yeoman-like service
to American policy during two
crucial periods, the Second World
War, and the Korean War.
Ex-General Barry Goldwater
A strange man, Mr. McNamara.
His ideas seem sound, because he
seems always to be bent on mod
ern izing our defense forces, even
at the expense of the conventional
objections to ehange. For his deci
sion on the Reserves, for instance,
he won a commendation from
none other than Major General

Barry Goldwater of the Reserves,
who himself stands to made obso
lete by the new ruling.
But diplomacy is not an unim
portant consideration: people de
serve to be told why they are go
ing to be discarded, why what
they had given a part of their
lives to is no longer important.
Apart from his deficiencies in dip
lomacy, Mr. McNamara has a lot
of responsible people on edge be
cause of his apparent belief that
the technological revaluation is
pretty well over, that the chal
| lenge at hand is merely to refine
our existing weapons system.
Dazzling Modernizations
I The danger is that all of Wash
| ington will be so swept up by Mr.
MeN'amara's dazzling moderniza
! tions, that responsible people will
stop asking: is it, after all—with
! all those pennies saved, men
turned out of the Reserves, yards
closed, weapons systems consoli
dated—that we are left relatively
• better off than we would other
wise have been? Better off vis-a-
I vis a ruthless enemy who gives no
indication of believing that
I science is about ready to take a
! long nap after its great exertions
j of the past 50 years, leaving the
world safely tucked in, in the
1 hands of a super-efficient gradu
i ate of the Harvard Business
j School?
The Reserve Officers deserve
their day in court. A congres
| sional commit tee should listen
very carefully to what those stut
tering colonels and generals have
to say after Mr. McNamara has
puiled out his great big charts
and demonstrated to the conclu
sive satisfaction of his teachers
! at Harvard that he learned well
about the marginal inefficiency of
the incremental production unit.
Rather a lot is at, stake, and the
aggrieved feelings of the United
States Reserves may be the best
lever we have at the moment for
catalyzing a solid debate on the
glories, and the weaknesses, of
our Secretary of Defense.
