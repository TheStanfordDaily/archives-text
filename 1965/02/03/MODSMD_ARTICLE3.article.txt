According to Goff, definitions
and classifications of what a
sponsor is, run the risk of limit
ing the spontaneity, diversity and
creativity which are the basis of
the Wilbur sponsor system.

j But in addition to having the
i desire and ability to work with a
variety of students, and a com
mitment: and dedication to expos
ing those students to the many
aspects of Stanford, he said, "the
sponsor should be able to draw
j on a meaningful depth of exped
ience and inspire the freshmen to
| become educated persons.
"A SPONSOR should be an
emotionally mature person, cap
able of independent and intellec
tual thought, active and mature
leadership and should have a
I sense of responsibility, both to
j himself and to others."
As an informal counselor, the
I sponsor should be approachable,
questioning, considerate of the
needs of others ,and above all,
willing to devote much of hi s
time to listening to the expressed
j concerns of the freshmen. Goff
j said.
It is hoped that the sponsor
I would also have a fairly well
! developed ethic of his own to
offer in an indirect way, not as
tile model but as a model for the
j freshmen to consider.
FOR THOSE who have been
sponsors, Goff believes sponsor
ing was a demanding, challenging
'and rewarding experience.
In addition to working with the
freshmen in his house, the spon
sor works with the faculty resi
'dent, faculty associates, student
associates, the director of the
Wilbur Houses and the twenty
four other sponsors.
Through the Wilbur House Sys
tem the sponsor participates with
these people in the building of a
community life largely of the stil
dents' own making.
