# Initial GCC Newsletter Defines Goals Of Graduate Movement
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Anybody wondering what t he
Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee (GCC) is, what it is doing, and
what it hopes to do will find some
illuminating answers in a news
letter now available at the GCC
office upstairs in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Viewing itself as participant in
j the "general and radical student!
revolt" exemplified by the Free;
Speech Movement controversy at j
Berkeley, the GCC cites two aims i
of the organization:
• THE CREATION of a "cul
! ture within the university that
will make possible a new intellec
| tual community."
• Participation in "coordinated
political ventures with existing
i radical organizations and interest
i groups."
The "new intellectual commu-;
i ity" envisioned by the GCC will
I be occupied with trying to solve
those "social problems" posed by
the conditions in East Palo Alto,
Palo Alto and Stanford.
East Palo Alto, though it re
\ fleets "the inadequacy of our con
cepts and programs of social wel-
I faro," nevertheless is an "old
! problem;" and since it is so large
and so much in the public eye, the
newsletter concentrated on other
i evils.
ONE SUCH is the "more com
: plicated, more insidious, more re
> cent problems of Palo Alto itself."
| Citing the twin revolutions of cy-j
bernetics and sophisticated weap
onry, the GCC warns that "Palo j
! Alto poses tho gargantuan and
! undiscussed problem of present i
social development; what does
one do with affluence?"
Lastly, the GCC turns to the

; problems of Stanford — "the ill
; ness of the multiversity." Scoring
the tendency of professors to re
search instead of teach, it holds
the University responsible for re
flecting "the acquisitive values of
the moneyed society."
"... the professor is novv
neither an independent thinker
nor a critic of society but a silent
participant in the world of the
salesman and the arms engineer."
i Stanford "graduates not edu
! eated people but people with an
education; it regards culture as
one of many appendages to t lie
I well-rounded personality, equiva
lent to taste in clothes or a good
game of tennis, and without rela
tion to the inner person."
OTHER SECONDARY prob
lems the GCC hopes to deal with
are the migratory labor problem,
Viet Nam and academic freedom.
Since so many projects are
under one roof, the newsletter
| readily admits that the GCC is not
| exactly unanimous on the urgency
of all these evils.
"It is only honest to say that
this vague analysis of the sources
of our discontents, and this vague
outline of our plans of action, is
not shared by all the members
of the GCC. ... On many issues,
we are at violent disagreement
among ourselves. . . ."
However, the GCC plans to per
severe in discussing the relation
of "the University to the Society;
the role of the Student in the So
ciety; and the nature of the So
ciety itself."
SOCIAL ACTION of a "radical"
\ nature is not the only concern of
i the GCC—or at least its newslet
| ter. The editors hope to offer in
; future issues not only a com
■ pendium of GCC news and com
j ment on certain issues but also
i "long essays on books, movies,
lectures, concerts and forums,"

and "intelligent essays disagree
ing with GCC positions."
Among the latter were a lengthy
analyzation of the history of mon
tage in Soviet films, a review of
David Riesman's book Constraint
and Variety in American Educa
tion, and a poem by Robert Pin
sky.
The GCC hopes its newsletter
will evolve into a bi-weekly or tri
weekly effort.

Anybody wondering what t he
Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee (GCC) is, what it is doing, and
what it hopes to do will find some
illuminating answers in a news
letter now available at the GCC
office upstairs in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Viewing itself as participant in
j the "general and radical student!
revolt" exemplified by the Free;
Speech Movement controversy at j
Berkeley, the GCC cites two aims i
of the organization:
• THE CREATION of a "cul
! ture within the university that
will make possible a new intellec
| tual community."
• Participation in "coordinated
political ventures with existing
i radical organizations and interest
i groups."
The "new intellectual commu-;
i ity" envisioned by the GCC will
I be occupied with trying to solve
those "social problems" posed by
the conditions in East Palo Alto,
Palo Alto and Stanford.
East Palo Alto, though it re
\ fleets "the inadequacy of our con
cepts and programs of social wel-
I faro," nevertheless is an "old
! problem;" and since it is so large
and so much in the public eye, the
newsletter concentrated on other
i evils.
ONE SUCH is the "more com
: plicated, more insidious, more re
> cent problems of Palo Alto itself."
| Citing the twin revolutions of cy-j
bernetics and sophisticated weap
onry, the GCC warns that "Palo j
! Alto poses tho gargantuan and
! undiscussed problem of present i
social development; what does
one do with affluence?"
Lastly, the GCC turns to the

; problems of Stanford — "the ill
; ness of the multiversity." Scoring
the tendency of professors to re
search instead of teach, it holds
the University responsible for re
flecting "the acquisitive values of
the moneyed society."
"... the professor is novv
neither an independent thinker
nor a critic of society but a silent
participant in the world of the
salesman and the arms engineer."
