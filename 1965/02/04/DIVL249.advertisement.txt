Seeking?
According to a recent poll, TIME magazine reported that eighty percent
of all college students are seeking an answei to the quesi on what is God?
Do you fall into this group? Why (invent mor brilliant and .veil-trained
college minds found a faith wl ch satisfies and works in da y '..ould it
] be that for one reason or another many are bypassing in th< r sf irh for truth
i the one source of all information which coulc! enlighten hen
Many students have studied Zen, Existentialism, psychology Yoai, and
' so forth". But they neglect Christianity and t ho B'ble becausi tssurne thai j
! rhey already know the facts about this religion . I niaps tin- ive acquired j
j from their homes the impression that the Bible holds no mc:e fot them than
the practices of some so-called Christian People. Or peri ' / I ''«e attended
| churches which do not teach the essential elemensi of Christianity — the Person '
] of Jesus Christ and His claims. Add a dash of classroom agnostK ism, fraternity
I ridicule, and Elmer Gantry propaganda, and it is i< '"lily understandable how |
j a person can become conditioned to overlooking and disregarding Chiistianity j
j as, the source of life and power
If you are one of those students who is seeking the truth, but ignoring the j
Bible and Jesus Christ, then set aside for a time your prejudice r ., doubts cinci :
resentments. Read the Gospel of John to find out what it really says. Jesus
Christ makes some astounding claims about Himself in tiis Cospel He claims
that He is God and that through Him alone man can he forgiven for all his sins
and enjoy eternal life with God.
These things are witten, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
i the Son of God- and that believing you might have life through His name
! (John 20:31)
For He whom God has sent utters the words of God, for it is not by
I measure that He gives the Spirit. The Father loves the Sen and has given all !
i tilings into His hand. He who believes in the Son has eternal life,- he who '
does not believe in the Son shall not see life but tine wrath of God rests upon
him (John 3'34-36).
Give the Bible a chance in your life today and join the ranks of those
who have found peace, joy and abundant life through Jesus Christ.
