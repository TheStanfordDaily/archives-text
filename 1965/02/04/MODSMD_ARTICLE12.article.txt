## Report On Student Judiciary-Administration Relations 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de

Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our

Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing is a copy of the report
on Student Judiciary-Adminis
tration Relations as submitted
to LASSU by Darrell Halver
son and Nora Crow, former
members of the student Judi
cial Council. The Speaker of
I.ASSU, Ed Shaw, requested
that the report be presented to
LASSU, and has called a special
meeting of the body to consider
the report.
I had said, that some of our
crew left their country 011 ac
count of being ruined by law;
that I had already explained
the meaning of the word; but
he was at a loss how it should
come to pass, that the law
which was intended for every
man's preservation, should be
any man's ruin. Therefore he
desired to be farther satisfied
what I meant by law, and the
disposers thereof according to
the present practice in my own
country. ... — Bk. IV.
Gulliver's Travels
In the recent past the ASSU
Judicial Council has failed notori
ously in its attempts to establish
a working relationship with the
Deans' Office. We should like to
offer an explanation for that fail
ure in hope that the new council
may benefit from our observa
tions and come to recognize, in
company with the Deans, a "law"
more protective than persecutive.
We do not challenge the judicial
system itself so much as we ques
tion the Deans' consistency in ob
serving judicial procedures. We
do not challenge the Deans them
selves; we question their handling
of a few unusual cases. Dean of
Students H. Donald Winbigler, for
example, has demonstrated again
and again his good judgment in
Honor Code cases. He seems to
understand the problems involved
in preserving academic integrity
on campus without ignoring the
peculiarities of an individual
case. He works well with faculty
members in defining and investi
gating academic violations. He has
even come before the council him
self to explain his point of view
and to request from the council a
similar explanation. In some
cases, however, his desire for ex
pediting a decision may take pre
cedence over his careful rega rd
for procedure, especially when
the disciplinary case is unusual
and the procedure is badly de
fined. John D. Black of the Coun
selling and Testing Center has
said in a paper on college judicial
systems:
A good administrator is
trained and skilled in making
decisions. Indeed, he is taught
that it is better to make a poor
decision than no decision at all.
But where justice is concerned,
these attitudes are improper;
no punishment is preferable to
unjust punishment. Further
more, judi c i a 1 proceedings
should not be conducted in an
atmosphere of haste; yet an ad
ministrator works under heavy
pressure and his work load is
increased by delays and post
ponements.
We speculate that the Frank
Morse Case involved administra
tive "haste" and "heavy pres
sure." How can we explain it
otherwise? A student at the Flor
ence campus breaks a door panel
in a moment of horseplay. The
panel is not worth much — per
haps sixty-five cents; but Dr.
Frulla, an administrator at the
campus, becomes upset because
the incident has occurred before
and writes a letter to administra
tors at the home campus. The
student arrives at Stanford to find
himself suspended while his com
panion in the escapade, who has
broken a panel deliberately, re
ceives a penalty of ten hours'
work in the Stanford Convales
cent Home.
Procedural Irregularities
The procedural irregularities in
Ihe case have become public
knowledge. The student council in
Italy, which first tried the case,
neglected to inform the men of
their judicial rights and to keep
minutes of the proceedings. The
faculty member or members, in
residence at the Florence campus,
who thought the penalty for
Morse inadequate, referred th e
case not to the ASSU Judicial
Council, but to the Stanford ad
ministration. The members of the
Stanford council received infor
mation about the case only by
chance: the Dean's Office chose
not to inform them before it de
cided upon suspension. Morse
never received a written state
ment explaining why and for how
long he was suspended, though
he requested such a statement re
peatedly.
Students have little knowledge
however, of other irregularities in
the case. Dean Winbigler in
formed Morse that all the faculty
members at the Florence campus
agreed upon his suspension; but
Darrell Halverson, chairman of
Men's Council at the time of the
Morse Case, testified in an open
hearing:
Professor Zelditeh himself
communicated to me Hint there
was, in fact, no formal meeting
of the directors and faculty
members overseas mid so it lie
comes obvious th:it there could

be no unanimity of opinion re
garding suspension or a ny
other projected penalty. Dr.
Zelditeh himself communicated
to me that he and at least one
other faculty member were very
explieit in saying that they did
not believe suspension was war
ranted even though they h a d
other reasons for believing tliat
aetion should be. of course, tak
en against Frank.
Dean Winbigler's own reasons
for taking action seemed to vary
fi'om time to time. On the one
hand, he maintained that the act
itself warranted suspension. On
the other hand, according to
Morse, he maintained that "it
would be a good tiling for me to
take off a quarter for the simple
reason that on psychological
grounds I could use the time to
Ihink things over, and maybe re
solve some of the heartaches and
come back a better person for it."
When Morse understood that his
readmission to Stanford depended
upon certification of his mental
health, he made an appointment
with Dr. James A. Paulsen, staff
psychiatrist for the Stanford
Health Service. Dr. Paulsen
wrote: "On the basis of his cur
rent and past history, I conclude,
at this time, that no psychiatric
illness or significant emotional
problems exist." Halverson had
this statement in his possession
when he and Marion Lcib, chair
man of Women's Council, met
with Dean Winbigler on April 12,
1964. The Dean informed the two
students that Morse was sus
pended, at least in part, because
he was "schizophrenic." They
questioned his competency to
make such a diagnosis. Though
they realized that his wide experi
ence with students gave him some
facility in making psychological
judgments .still they thought that
his experience did not qualify him
to make medical decisions. Hal
verson wondered aloud how th e
Stanford community would react
to the Dean's diagnosis. "If you
make that public, so help me, I'll
shoot you!" said Dean Winbigler
Halverson concluded, and rightly
we must think, that the Dean was
merely overwrought; and plans
for the open hearing proceeded.
Right To Public Trial
A student has the right to pub
lic trial under the ASSU Consti
tution; and even if the council had
disapproved of Morse's request, it
must have acceded to his wishes.
But the council considered the
public trial its last recourse.
Hours before the trial, Dean of
Women Lucile Allen tried to ar
range a last-chance meeting of j
deans and student council mem- j
bers. She indicated that Dean!
Winbigler might disclose to the!
council, on its promise of secrecy, j
the letter from Dr. Frulla that;
might justify Morse's suspension.
The council had repeatedly re
quested the information. Repeat
edly its members had promised
not to divulge the contents of the
letter. Repeatedly they had ap
pealed to past cases in which tfie
Deans' Office had confided in the
student council. Dean Winbigler
said that even now he was un
willing to give out. the informa
tion, however; and the council
members saw no point to further
negotiation.
Before the trial took place, the
defendant and the council mem
bers withstood administrative
pressure. Morse hinted at the
pressure put on him:
If I've had a "positive atti
tude" towards my suspension
the Dean's Office will be one j
hundred per cent behind me in
getting the scholarship. If I
have a negative attitude, well, it
could possibly have negative re
sults in my getting back by
scholarship. As far as the way
it would affect me for graduate
school, which was a primary
concern of mine, a positive atti
tude towards suspension could
result in almost being better off
off than if you hadn't l>een sus
pended. A negative attitude can
liave again negative results....
One of the things that tied in
with my psychological attitude
was the fact that I failed to ac
cept as reality the fact that I
was suspended from Stanford
University. This indicates a
negative attitude.
The Dean's Office applied pres
sure to the council members some
what more subtly: most, of the
members of Women's Council, for
example, received "advice" a n d
argument from the directors of
the living areas over which they
had jurisdiction.
Dr. Black offers an explanation
for such irregularities:
In a system with few built-in
safeguards for an accused per
son, the administrator is asked
to balance his responsibilities
to the student body and the in- j
stitution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,
lie is the object of all manner
of pressure from parents, in
terested students or faculty,
other administrators. It is not ;

an enviable task, nor is it in
keeping with whatever wisdom
is represented by the judicial
procedures that our society has
evolved over the centuries.
We speculate, then, that the
Frank Morse Case involved pres
sure upon the Deans' Office. How
can we explain it otherwise?
If we accept this definition
of the administrative dilemma, we
propose as a solution the partial
disburdening of the Stanford ad
ministrator, so that he is no lon
ger disciplinarian, but only coun
selor. As counselor, he might
meet and advise students —en-
gaged, for example, in sexual
misconduct—who presently avoid
the Deans' Office for fear of
punishment. While student offi
cers and faculty members dispose
of disciplinary problems, he
might invite the confidence of
troubled students who need guid
ance more than judgment. Dean
Allen, after the proposed change,
might retain the respect of the
whole Stanford community,
though she frees herself from the
complexities of university dis
cipline. She responds with sincere
sympathy for many girls, to
whom she is generous with her
time and her cnegies. (She has
recently told a council member
how she helped an improverished
student buy herself a ball gown.)
Emotional Response
We suggest, however, that she
may respond emotionally as well,
to some cases that require de
tachment. She may consider the
implications as well as the facts
in a case and advise Women's
Council accordingly. Last Spring
Quarter a girl fell asleep on her
date's bed in his dormitary room.
The council charged her with neg
ligence for missing the 2:30 lock
out time and with deliberate dis
regard for ignoring the open
house hours. It agreed unani
mously upon a penalty of sus
pended suspension. Dean Allen
called Nora Crow, chairman of
ihe council, and said she thought
the penalty inadequate. The girl,
she said, had got herself into an
"immoral situation." The Disci
plinary Sub-Committee of the
Committee on Student Affairs and
Services would probably increase
the penalty upon reviewing the
case. Because she disliked the
notion of changing a student de
cision, she preferred that the
council itself reconsider the case
and decide upon a penalty of sus
pension.
The council agreed unani
mously to retain its original pen
alty; and the chairman sent an
explanation to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee along with a rec
ord of the only precedent case
the members could recall a case
almost the same, in which the
council had also assigned a pen
alty of suspended suspension.
Shortly thereafter, Vice-Chair
man Caroline Ward discussed the
case with Dean Allen. The Dean
said, according to Miss Ward,
that she had not seen the
minutes of the precedent ease at
the time the council recommen
ded its penalty; that she never
would have approved the prece
dent penalty if she had. The coun
cil awaited, rather pessimistically,
the outcome of the Sub-Commit
tee's review. When Miss Ward
inquired about the final decision,
Dean Allen said that the student
had not received suspension; that
the Sub-Committee had got the
case too late to change the pen
alty.
The Misconduct Article
The council members assumed,
of course, that the Deans' Offices
would normally have assigned a
penalty of suspension. When the
council published in the Fall
Quarter Daily a version of the
case, however, Dean Allen ob
jected to the implication that she
and the Sub-Committee might
take implications into account.
She objected so strongly, in fact,
that Dean Winbigler informed the
chairman of Women's Council
that he considered the article
libellous. He would turn the whole
matter over to the Disciplinary
Sub-Committee—"and they won't
like it very much"—unless, he
implied, the chairman showed
good faith by withdrawing the
last article in the Daily series.
The last article in the series
treated Misconduct, or sex. The
council could hardly withdraw the
article when it had tried for so
long to clarify the university poli
cy on sex. Council members had
explained to Dean Allen that they
could not in conscience try sex
cases when few students knew
that sexual intercourse consti
tuted a violation of university
policy. Many council members
did not approve of university
action in this area; they thought
the policy might be changed only
when the students became aware
that it existed.
University Policy On Sex
Council members Caroline
Ward and Nora Crow worker!
from Winter Quarter to Summer

Quarter, 1961, upon a formula
tion of the university policy on
sex. During Spring Quarter, 1964,
they presented a tentative state
ment for Dean Allen's approval.
The statement explained that the
university would take action in
proved cases of sexual inter
courses between unmarried stu
dents; that accused students
might present their case before
the ASSU Judicial Council; that
accused students might permit
the Deans' Office to handle their
case if they did not wish disciplin
ary action noted in their records.
Dean Allen informed the two
council members that she could
not accept the statement in its
entirety, but she would see a
version of it published if she had
to take the matter to President
Sterling. Miss Ward met with
Deans Allen and Winbigler on the
last day of Spring Quarter to re
solve their questions about the
statement. She considered its pub
lication almost certain until she
met with Dean Allen in August.
Dean Allen said, according to
Miss Ward, that Dean Winbigler
was evolving alternatives to the
statement; that the council's
plan for publication was not really
feasible; that the council mem
bers must begin again to con
sider ways of informing the stu
dent body that sexual intercourse
violated university regulation.
Miss Ward and Miss Crow gave
up their plans for clarifying the
policy in an official statement
and resolved to make the informa
tion public when their terms of
office had expired. They found
in the council files, however, a
statement of policy similar to
their own. The chairman of a
past council had signed it, sub
scribing that Dean Allen had ap
proved it on April 19, 1963. Last
Fall Quarter, Women's Council
drew upon this signed statement
in writing of its article on Mis
conduct; and it could scarcely
understand Dean Allen's charge
that the council chairman had
fabricated a university policy on
sex. Not only did she disavow
before the AWS Board, the ex
istence of any policy at all, but
she accused the entire council
of disloyalty because it had ne
glected to take her into its con
fidence before the publication of
precedent.
Charge of Disloyalty
The charge of disloyalty she
again levelled at the council chair
man in the case of two girls
whose offense was minor and
whose penalty was mild. The
Dean informed the chairman that
the girls had been overheard ridi
culing the lightness of their pen
alty. The chairman asked the
sourse of the information. Dean
Allen declined to reveal her
sourse but said she thought it
reliable. She loft to the council,
she said, what action it might
take. The council decided that it
should not handle the incident
formally; that the council mem
ber who lived nearest the girls
might question them about the
rumor. The girls denied that the
rumor had any substance and
made an appointment to justify
themselves to Dean Allen. The
Dean objected strongly to the
disclosure of her name. Either the
council should do nothing with
the information, she said, or it
should call the girls before it and,
without telling them the source
of its knowledge, increase or
threaten to increase their penalty.
We think that Dean Allen can
not rightly understand the pur
pose of a student council when
she expects to use its members
as her administrative agents. As
council members, they cannot
withhold information from the
student body simply because it
might arouse controversy. As
council members they cannot
operate efficiently without dis
closing to an accused student
more information than an admin
istrator might think appropriate.
Charges of disloyalty to an admin
istrator are hardly appropriate
when council members must
maintain, first of all, their loyalty
to Ihe ideals their position re
quires.
Student Council Chairmanship
Student council members are
responsible to the student body
for maintaining the integrity of
the council's structure and com
position. Dean Allen has demon
strated her misunderstanding of
the student judiciary in her at
tempts to control its "politics."
At the end of Spring Quarter,
1964, the Dean took Council Chair
man Marion Leib aside and told
her she wished Miss Ward to suc
ceed to the chairmanship. She
could not work with Nora Crow,
she said. Just before the council
elected Miss Crow as its chair
man, it held try-outs for new
members. Because she lias access
to the confidential files, Dean
Allen has in the past informed
the selection committee whether
she knew of any candidates under
psychiatric care. The committee
might take serious mental prob
lems into account in approving

and disapproving its candidates,
in the case of a candidate during
Spring Quarter, however Dean
Allen revealed to Miss Ward and
Miss Crow information supplied
by the girl's freshman sponsor
and by her RA's—information not
about her mental health, but
about her personality. Dean Allen
read that the girl was opinion
ated; but Miss Ward and Miss
Crow decided to trust their own
knowledge of her personality and
rejected the Dean's information
as immaterial to their purpose.
The Dean proceeded to point out
that the girl's college-board math
scores were damningly low.
"But, Dean Allen," said Caroline
Ward, "mine were even lower."
Dean Allen reconsidered the rele
vance of math scores. The sel
ection committee approved the
candidate without really under
standing why the Dean disap
proved her, though some sup
posed that Dean Allen had dis
liked her letter to the Daily for
its commendation of the Frank
Morse hearing.
Dean Allen's misconception of
student government extends fur
ther than Women's Council: in
the spring of 1964, for example,
she asked the members of the
council to work against the sel
ection of a particular candidate
as chairman of the Social Regu
lations Committee. While ack
nowledging the misconception,
Dr. Black has explained the mo
tive for such administrative man
euvers: "Student personnel ad
ministrators, caught between
sometimes conflicting needs to
retain the good will and uphold
the morals of the students while
enforcing edicts of the college ad
ministration. are often tempted
to resort to manipulative devices."
We speculate, then, that Dean
Allen's machinations involved
"conflicting needs." How can we
explain it otherwise?
Freshman English
Perhaps Dean Allen demonstra
ted most obviously her miscon
ception of the council as her own
instrument during a luncheon
discussion in May, 1964. The Dean
introducedthe subject of the Eng
lish Department. We shall recon
struct, as nearly as possible, her
comments on this occasion. She
attributed some of the problems
which occur among freshmen to
the salacious materials they study
in Freshman English and to the
erotic approach adopted by many
of the younger professors. These
professors, she said, sexually ar
ouse the freshman men both with
in the classroom and without it.
She cited as a case in point a
story she had told to the council
several times before — a story
about a professor who stood upon
the steps of Wilbur and urged the
freshmen to "make" a girl within
the week. (We quote from Dean
Allen and not, presumably, from
the professor.)
The young professors arouse
the freshman girls sexually, as
well. They concentrate deliber
ately on the erotic aspects of lit
erature, in part because those
who are unmarried use literature
as their sexual outlet, and in part
because they wish to seduce the
girls in their classes. The Dean
said she knew of several recent
cases where professors had suc
ceeded in seducing students. One
of the girls involved, she said, is
now "110 better than a street
walker.'' The professors exercise
control over the girls by virtue
of their grading power; and they
can intimidate a girl who will
not comply with their wishes.
Marion Leib here interjected that,
in her opinion, a girl would not
tolerate such a threat. Dean Al
len assured her that she had ac
cess to information a student
could never know, and she alone
could testify to the validity of hei
st at ement.
Sexual Implications
Nora Crow said she thought
1 hat professors might concen
trate on the sexual implications
of literature because they really
Ijelieved the literature contained
them. The Dean asked her
whether she herself thought that
English literature contained
nothing but sexual implications.
Vicky Ganz and Caroline Ward
pointed out that any student who
took more than one English
course could balance one approach
against another. Dean Allen did
not reply but proposed, instead,
that the members of Women's
Council takes notes on anything
objectionable they heard in their
English courses. She requested
that they write down the name
of the course, the name of the
teacher, and the substance of his
remarks. They might enclose cop
ies of assignments they disap
proved. The two council members
who had jurisdiction over the
freshman dormitories might ob
tain names and notes from Ihe
freshman girls, Vicky Ganz re
calls. Dean Allen would send this
material to the President of the
University, who would either
handle the matter himself or
transmit the information to re

sponsible members of the depart
ment.
Miss Crow said that she would
prefer to object to her professors
in person if she disapproved of
their teaching methods. Dean Al
len insisted that the professors
would take revenge by lowering
her grades. Miss Crow answered
that she thought her position se
cure. Dean Allen said that she had
access to information a student
could never know. "They'll fail
you," she said. The Dean prom
ised the council members that she
would keep their names confi
dential, so that their professors
would never discover the source
of the information used against
them. Dean Allen said. Caroline
Ward recalls, that the faculty
members would merely ridicule
a girl who criticized their methods
openly. The council members
would themselves keep the proj
ect a secret.
Use Of Information
Nora Crow asked how the in
formation would be used. Dean
Allen promised that the older pro- j
fessors would simply reprimand '
their colleagues; that they might ;
arrange a departmental meeting I
to discuss improvements in the j
Freshman English program. Miss !
Crow wondered whether the older '
professors might allow the col- j
leeted information to influence,
their decisions on promotions, j
Dean Allen replied that the pro- |
fessors in question did not de- j
serve promotion.
Miss Crow said that if shej
were a professor, she would pre- j
fer to choose her own course ma
terial and her own approach to it.
Dean Avery, the Assistant Dean
of Women, said that ihe members i
of the faculty abused the privi- j
leges of academic freedom, and'
Dean Allen agreed. Nora Crow
left the luncheon table with the ;
Dean, who told her that she would I
not like to act over her objec- j
tions. She had received a promise !
of help from two of the council
members, and she asked M is s !
Crow to reconsider her objections j
and discuss the project with her
and the other members the next j
week.
Three of the four English ma- !
jors on the council met later in I
the day and agreed not to partici- j
pate in the gathering of informa- j
tion. In the afternoon Dean Allen
telephoned Caroline Ward and
said she had tried at length to get
in touch with Nora Crow. She j
asked Miss Ward whether she;
knew where Miss Crow was; but !
she did not. Dean Allen requested j
that Miss Ward make sure, mean-1
while, that Nora Crow did not j
inform any of her professors j
about the discussion. They would '

ull take a later opportunity, she
said, to discuss the matter fur
ther; but she never mentioned it
to the council again. Incidentally,
we have drawn for our recon
struction of the incident and its
aftermath fxom a statement
signed and presented to a member
|of the English Department by
! three witnesses to the discussion.
Judicial Council's Itole
Interpreted in light of others
like it, the discussion demon
strates that the Dean does not
recognize Women's Council as an
independent organization; that
[she thinks of tin 1 council as part
of her administrative staff; that
she feels genuinely hurt w h en
council members make adminis
strative blunders while pursuing
what thoy see as their personal
or judicial duty. We encourage
the new Judicial Council to pre
clude the possibility of further
hurt feelings by defining more
clearly the role of a student coun
cil member. At the same time it
might work with the Deans'
Office in defining and promulgat
ing all unwritten university poli
cies, especially in regard to the
controversial problems of liquor,
promiscuity, and homosexuality.
The Administrator may desire to
handle such problems secretly,
but surely the Educator will
recognize the worth of Dr. Black's
j proposal
that student personnel officers
assume active responsibility for
the moral and ethical education
of college students. Our present
programs and services should
be examined to ascertain the ex
tent to which they contribute
to this goal or can he made to
serve it, and new programs
and techniques must be devel
oped. Many of us will need to
educate ourselves in a more
sophisticated understanding of
various ethical and moral posi
tions and develop less dogmatic
and judgmental responses to
the arguments presented by
students.
But because the Stanford ad
; ministrator may find himself too
'much encumbered by Ihe de
mands upon him to take careful
! notice of judicial procedure, the
! new council might choose as its
' first objective — even before it
| considers the evaluation of un
! written policy -- the creation of
j a permanent faculty appeals
(board with power of ultimate de
cision. We suppose that a perman
• ent appeals board may proceed
from Dean Wert's forthright in
vestigation into judicial pro
cedure. We refer the new council
to his Judicial Review Board for
the solution of any judicial prob*
lems it may have. Just as the new
I council members have not partiei*
; pated in the writing of this report,
jwe hope that they can work with
Dean Wert, so successfully thrj.t
they will not participate in our
disappointment.
