# Special Statement By Speaker Of Legislature
## 
### ED SHAW Speaker of LASSU 
A report has been presented to me by former officers and pres
ent members of the Associated Students involving serious prob
lems in the relationship between the student judicial system, the
faculty and the administration. The individuals involved have
brought the attention of this report to the proper authorities in

the prescribed manner and those*
authorities, both faculty and ad
ministration, have acted in good
faith and moved rapidly and with
effectiveness in determining the
proper actions to take. Student
government can only express its
gratitude to all authorities invol
ved for their concern and fair
treatment of all students affected
by this matter.
I cannot help but compare our
situation here at Stanford with the
recent developments at the United
States Air Force Academy. That
grave matters are involved at
both institutions is obvious. The
difference is that we intend to go
about our housecleaning in as
open and beneficial a manner as
is possible. Gossip and rumor eas
ily obscure any situation such as
this in which so many have such
a great stake in the outcome.
Even at Stanford we are not im
mune to distortions of problems
and especially those presented in
the report. Unfortunately it has
become apparent t hat part s
of this report are circulating
among the student body against
the direct wishes of all student
officers. Distribution of this re
port in that irresponsibile manner
may distort the main issues and
create an emotional reaction in
a situation where clear thinking
is required.
After consultation with the
Rules Committee of the Legis
lature it Is my feeling that it
would be to the general welfare
of tlie student body to allow a
full and accurate discussion of

the issues involved, and to pre
vent any action that might bring
j discredit upon the student body
lor Ihe University as a whole.
For those reasons I have released
: a copy of the official report to The
Daily in order that all the facts
of the report may be known. Fur
ther I am calling a special session
of the Legislature at 7:30 p.m.
! tonight in Room 214 of History
j Corner.
At that time I expect that the
j representatives of the student
'body after due deliberation will
| reach any conclusions that might
be necessary and report them 1o
| the President of the University
and the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council as the of
ficial position of the Associated
Students. I further expect that
j all members of the Legislature
i will consult freely with their con
st indents and report to the Legis
lature those opinions. I trust that
the student body will express its
views openly and without hesita
tion at the same time realizing the
seriousness of all parts of the re
port and the fact that the prema
ture publication of this report
[was forced upon the Association
i before a full inquiry could be com
' pleted. At this time the students
might well look at their role
j within the University and decide
| whether they have fulfilled their
! obligations to themselves and the
i community.
In addition I request that a I 1
members of Legislature bring
with them this copy of The Daily
'as there will not be time to pre
pare any copies of the report.

A report has been presented to me by former officers and pres
ent members of the Associated Students involving serious prob
lems in the relationship between the student judicial system, the
faculty and the administration. The individuals involved have
brought the attention of this report to the proper authorities in

the prescribed manner and those*
authorities, both faculty and ad
ministration, have acted in good
faith and moved rapidly and with
effectiveness in determining the
proper actions to take. Student
government can only express its
gratitude to all authorities invol
ved for their concern and fair
treatment of all students affected
by this matter.
I cannot help but compare our
situation here at Stanford with the
recent developments at the United
States Air Force Academy. That
grave matters are involved at
both institutions is obvious. The
difference is that we intend to go
about our housecleaning in as
open and beneficial a manner as
is possible. Gossip and rumor eas
ily obscure any situation such as
this in which so many have such
a great stake in the outcome.
Even at Stanford we are not im
mune to distortions of problems
and especially those presented in
the report. Unfortunately it has
become apparent t hat part s
of this report are circulating
among the student body against
the direct wishes of all student
officers. Distribution of this re
port in that irresponsibile manner
may distort the main issues and
create an emotional reaction in
a situation where clear thinking
is required.
After consultation with the
Rules Committee of the Legis
lature it Is my feeling that it
would be to the general welfare
of tlie student body to allow a
full and accurate discussion of

the issues involved, and to pre
vent any action that might bring
j discredit upon the student body
lor Ihe University as a whole.
For those reasons I have released
: a copy of the official report to The
Daily in order that all the facts
of the report may be known. Fur
ther I am calling a special session
of the Legislature at 7:30 p.m.
! tonight in Room 214 of History
j Corner.
At that time I expect that the
j representatives of the student
'body after due deliberation will
| reach any conclusions that might
be necessary and report them 1o
| the President of the University
and the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council as the of
ficial position of the Associated
Students. I further expect that
j all members of the Legislature
i will consult freely with their con
st indents and report to the Legis
lature those opinions. I trust that
the student body will express its
views openly and without hesita
tion at the same time realizing the
seriousness of all parts of the re
port and the fact that the prema
ture publication of this report
[was forced upon the Association
i before a full inquiry could be com
' pleted. At this time the students
might well look at their role
j within the University and decide
| whether they have fulfilled their
! obligations to themselves and the
i community.
In addition I request that a I 1
