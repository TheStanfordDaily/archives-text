# Do-It-Yourself Sailing Association Formed

Two would-be seafaring co-eds
staggered home one day several
weeks ago covered from stem to
stern with creosote (a wood pre
servative!.
An ambitious craftsman named
Jake van I-leeckerman labored
over reams of cloth with a bor
rowed sailmaker's loft for ten con
secutive days in the band shack,
much to the consternation of the
band.
About 20 novice dockworkers
(non-affiliated) converted 60 feet
ol Lake Lag waterfront into dock.
The result was the Stanford
Sailing Association, a do-it-your
self clan of 220 which owns and
operates what its president calls
"the best fleet of college boats on
the Coast."

Students seeking instruction,
social outlets (the club's ratio is
a comfortable 3-2), or a chance to
(small-scale Flying Dutchman)
on the intercollegiate level have
responded in numbers that presi
dent Carter Ford called "far be
yond what we'd ever hoped for."
A complete novice can learn
enough from the six instructors
in two to four hours to qualify
for a provisional license, enabl
ing him to take out one of the
eight boats in moderate weather,
according to Ford.
Advanced instruction deals with
capsize techniques and more dif
ficult weather conditions, leading
to a helmsman's license.
Capsize techniques might be
useful. During one of the club's
weekends of sailing, the wind was
brisk enough to send the occu
pants of 16 boats into the chilly
waters of Lake Lag. Among the
pre-season swimmers was a
tor, who shall remain nameless.
A styrofoam egg tops the mast
of each Stanford craft (see be
low), supposedly to keep it from
a total capsize. "Most groups use
spheres," Ford remarked.
Also unique, according to Ford,
is the mass participation in the
"dirty work" of construction.
"We actually made our own sails
that's almost unheard of these
days," said the president, him
self a former chief executive of
the national Inter-Collegiate Yacht
Racing Association while at: Har
vard.
The embryo Stanford racing
team is currently practicing two
days a week in preparation for
the forthcoming Coast ICYRA
lournament. Boats are available
for instruction or pleasure sail
ing Thursday and Friday from
two, and weekends from ten.
"And,"says Ford, "They can
always join the crowd that lines
Lagunita each day lo watch the
capsizes."



SAILING ON LAG Stanford students can en
joy sailing and instruction on Lake Lcigunitci
on Thursday and Fridays as well as over
the weekend. Response has been so great,

according to the Stanford Sailng Club, that
they have not been able to accomodate all
those interested on the weekends.
