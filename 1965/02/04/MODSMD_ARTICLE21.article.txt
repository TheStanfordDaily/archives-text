# Card Tankers Race Santa Clara SC, Cal
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity and fresh
man swimming teams have a pair
of meets on tap for this weekend.
The Indians face the always
formidable Santa Clara Swim
Club tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. in
the Encina Pool. Saturday both
teams travel to Cal for a meet at
2:00.
Stanford will compete against
Santa Clara in a "double dual"
meet. Both Stanford teams swim
against Santa Clara at the same
time, scores being tabulated be
tween SC and the varsity and SC
and the frosh.
The list of past Santa Clara
swimmers reads like an Olympic
record sheet. Dick Roth, a high
school senior and Olympic cham
pion, and Greg Buckingham pro-

I vide an awesome Santa Clara
1 threat this year.
STANFORD has its share of
i Olympians also. Ilkka Suvanto,
i who competed for Finland, won
two events last weekend against
i powerful Oregon.
Mike Wall, a 1964 Olympian.
; was the anchor man on a fresh
man 800 freestyle relay which
posted an American AAU record
three weeks ago. Gary Sheerer,
Mike Greene, and Pete Ready
j gave him the start. The frosh,
: making waste paper of Stanford's
freshman record sheets, are look
| ing to give the Santa Clarans a
sprint for their money.
Cal has given the Tribe little
j trouble in the past. Bear hair
I seems to bog down in the water.
