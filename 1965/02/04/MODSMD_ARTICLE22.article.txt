# PINNED BY INJURIES
## Matmen Face Tough Schedule 
### JACK GASKILL (Second of Two Parts 
In the firsl article of this two
part secies, the past lack of spec
tator interest in wrestling at
Stanford and some of the possible
reasons for it were discussed.
Now let lis look at the brighter
side of things and talk about the
coach, the team, and the outlook
for the future.
The Indians are coached by Bill
Leland, who did his collegiate
wrestling at Amherst College in
Massachusetts. He look over a
year ago and brought the team up
from a 14th place in the Pacific
Coast tournament in 1963, to a
4th place finish in the AAWU
tournament in 1961.
THE TRIBE had two individ
ual champions last year in 177 lb.

Tom Allen and 191 lb. Don Bueh
ler. The Indians racked up 50
points to finish not far below first
place UCLA with 64 points.
At the start of the season,
Coach Leland was very optimistic
about the outcome this year, but
injuries and the loss of two star
ters have seriously weakened the
team. Sophomore Bob Nickel at
130 lbs. and veteran 137 lb. Dick
Anderson have dropped wrestling
to concentrate on studies.
Al. GONZALES at 123 lbs. has
been slowed down with knee and
groin injuries, while 167 lb. John
Price was forced to join the team
two months late due to an opera
tion. Also, 167 lb. regular Steve
Schaum has been hampered by a
rib injury.
As a result of losing Nickel
arid Anderson, (he Cards must
forfeit the 130 lb. and 137 lb.
matches each time they wrestle.
This puts the team in the hole by
10 points before the matches even
start.
The weakness in the lower
weights is offset somewhat by the
strength and depth in the upper
weights. At 167 lbs., Schaum,
Price and Frank Pratt are all top
notch wrestlers. At 177 lbs.,
George Kampe continues to press
Mike Davison for the starting as
signment week after week.

Bruce Wilhelm, in the unlimited
division ,has wan seven straight
matches this season.
COIIKY VANCK and Bob Gar
cia, at 147 and 157, have hot h
; shown considerable promise. So
far this season, even with all
the injuries and vacancies, the
Indians have managed to come up
with a 2-2 dual meet record.
The freshman team, with good
overall depth, is the strongest in
years. Outstanding freshmen are
123 lb. John Hazelton, 137 lb. John
Suttle, 117 lb. Tom Rajala and
'Tim Luria, 157 lb. Bill Vogelpohl.
| and 177 lb. Bud Hollingbery. Sut-
I tie has been out with a knee in-
I jury for the past month, but
! should return to action shortly.
; Coach Leland is quite pleased
| with the ability and desire shown
I by his freshmen, and is very opti
! mistic about their future.
The varsity faces lough sled
ding for the rest of the season,
meeting four top teams in a row,
j Oregon State, Oregon, Cal Poly
! of Pomona, and UCSB. The Tribe
: faces their toughest foe of i h e
| year in the match with Oregon
State this Friday at 7:30 p.m. in
the Pavilion.
THIS KKAVKRK, winners of the
: 1964 PCI tournament, are led by
Ken Kauffman who was the 177
i II), PCI champ last year t"ok
third place in the national tourna
; ment, and was an alternate on the
, U.S. Olympic team last fall.
Judging by the increased num
ber of spectators this year, it ap
j pears that the interest in wres
' tling at Stanford is finally begin
j ning to gain momentum along
I with the quality of the team.

In the firsl article of this two
part secies, the past lack of spec
tator interest in wrestling at
Stanford and some of the possible
reasons for it were discussed.
Now let lis look at the brighter
side of things and talk about the
coach, the team, and the outlook
for the future.
The Indians are coached by Bill
Leland, who did his collegiate
wrestling at Amherst College in
Massachusetts. He look over a
year ago and brought the team up
from a 14th place in the Pacific
Coast tournament in 1963, to a
4th place finish in the AAWU
tournament in 1961.
THE TRIBE had two individ
ual champions last year in 177 lb.

Tom Allen and 191 lb. Don Bueh
ler. The Indians racked up 50
points to finish not far below first
place UCLA with 64 points.
At the start of the season,
Coach Leland was very optimistic
about the outcome this year, but
injuries and the loss of two star
ters have seriously weakened the
team. Sophomore Bob Nickel at
130 lbs. and veteran 137 lb. Dick
Anderson have dropped wrestling
to concentrate on studies.
Al. GONZALES at 123 lbs. has
been slowed down with knee and
groin injuries, while 167 lb. John
Price was forced to join the team
two months late due to an opera
tion. Also, 167 lb. regular Steve
Schaum has been hampered by a
rib injury.
As a result of losing Nickel
arid Anderson, (he Cards must
forfeit the 130 lb. and 137 lb.
matches each time they wrestle.
This puts the team in the hole by
10 points before the matches even
start.
The weakness in the lower
weights is offset somewhat by the
strength and depth in the upper
weights. At 167 lbs., Schaum,
Price and Frank Pratt are all top
notch wrestlers. At 177 lbs.,
George Kampe continues to press
Mike Davison for the starting as
signment week after week.

Bruce Wilhelm, in the unlimited
division ,has wan seven straight
matches this season.
COIIKY VANCK and Bob Gar
cia, at 147 and 157, have hot h
; shown considerable promise. So
far this season, even with all
the injuries and vacancies, the
Indians have managed to come up
with a 2-2 dual meet record.
The freshman team, with good
overall depth, is the strongest in
years. Outstanding freshmen are
123 lb. John Hazelton, 137 lb. John
Suttle, 117 lb. Tom Rajala and
'Tim Luria, 157 lb. Bill Vogelpohl.
| and 177 lb. Bud Hollingbery. Sut-
