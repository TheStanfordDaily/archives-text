# A
						Question Of Values

"Tlie function of administration," wrote Paul
Goodman I in a recent article for the New York
Review of Books,) "is to expedite the essential
academic business of teaching and learning, e.g.,
as secretary and janitor; and protectively to rep
sent the academic community in its external re
lations, e.g., in court or as fund-raiser. When
administration becomes the dominant force in
the community, however, it is a sign that extra
mural powers are in control . . . and the adminis
tration is their agent."
The allegations contained in a report released
yesterday by Darrell Halverson, Chairman of
Men's Council last spring during the Frank
Morse case, and Nora Crow, Chairman of Wom
en's Council this Fall Quarter, suggest that the
unfortunate iubalance of powers of which Good
man speaks docs, indeed, exist at Stanford and
that at least one member of the administration
is willing to extend influence into the classroom
itself.
One part of the Crow-1 lalverson report records
a conversation last spring between the Dean of
Women, Lucile Allen, and the members of
W omen's Council. The subject under discussion
was the Department of English.
Many of Dean Allen's initial comments would
seem to be inflammatory. However, the real
issue lies elsewhere—it lies in a blatant attempt
to encroach upon the academic process.
After her introductory comments, the Dean
suggested that the assembled W omen's Council
take notes on lectures of professors in the Eng
lish Department who, she alleged, use erotic
materials in their courses. She suggested that
the girls then pass the notes and names of the
professors on to her office.
The right to absolute academic freedom, for
both teachers and students is the most basic law
of any university community.
In suggesting the instigation of an almost
"Kafkaesque" system of informing, the Dean of
Women has clearly over-stepped her preroga
tives and, in some measure, has simply abro
gated her right to a position of authority.
In a more profound sense, however, the
Dean's action in this instance is merely symto
matic of a larger lapse—a reversal of values by
which the essential, even sacred business of this
university, its academic business, becomes sec
ondary to, even subject to, the considerations of
the administration's and the community's per
sonal moral code.
The Dean's action suggests disrespect for the
intelligence and dignity of both students and
faculty.
It also calls into question an administration

which would, by ignorance or apathy, permit a
climate within which such a breach of academic
freedom could occur.
Hut, in another sense, a share of the "blame"
(if indeed it is blame) for this situation goes to
the students and faculty. As Goodman, in his
New York Review article notes:
"Generally speaking, student efforts to get
an education befitting free men rather than
slaves can succeed only with strong faculty
backing, for the students are transient, they
do not definitely know what they want, they
do not know the score behind the scenes and
thus they can be abashed by administration
double talk. On the other hand, given the
supine history of American faculties in our sec
tarian and trustee-ridden colleges, and given
the present extra-mural careerism of the im
portant professors, the students must lead if
there is to be any change."
In the past, a few students have attempted
to lead, but it has always been a few, the ones
on the inside, the ones who are in a position, by
virtue of their contact with the administration, to
"know the score." The larger body of students re
main ignorant of the real issues and generally
manage to live out their four-year careers with
little thought toward improving the climate of
learning for their successors.
Communication — that is, an open and free
discussion of the real problems facing this com
munity — simply does not exist. From time to
time in the past, students have taken positions
and proliferated their ideas through The Daily
or on the floor of LASSU. Upon exceedingly rare
occasions, individual faculty members have
made their feelings on the state of the university
known through The Daily or through the Aca
demic Council. The administration, which holds
the largest share of practical power in this com
munity. has rarely, if ever, participated in a
open, public discussion of university problems.
More often, the administration "communi
cates" its opinions and plans to a few selective
students on a personal, one-to-one basis in con
fidence. The administration's public "communi
cation" is usually in the form of abstract policy
statements.
The result, in short, has been not a dialogue
at all. but a monologue.
It is to be sincerely hoped that in dealing
with this document which presents, for the first
time, a series of real, concrete, and unembel
lished problems, the administration, students and
faculty will set a precedent for open, free, and
public discussion as is befitting a great univer
