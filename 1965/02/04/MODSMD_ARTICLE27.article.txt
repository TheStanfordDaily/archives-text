# Statement By Former Chairman Of Men's And Women's Councils
## 
### NORA CROW AND DARRELL HALVERSON 
EDITOR'S NOTK: Mr. Hal
verson served as chairman of
Men's Council and of .Indicia!
Council for Spring- Quarter,
1964; Miss Crow, as chairman
of Women's Council for Fall
Qua rter,l964.
Wo wish to clarify our origi
nal objectives in formulating this
statement and our matured mo
lives in assenting to its publica
tion. We had wished to initiate a
university-wide discussion of
problems that we encountered as
student officers. We had hoped
to open to the attention of the
whole Stanford community to a

situation that demanded fresh inl
and sunshine.
We submitted our comments
to faculty members and admini
strators. and we have observed
with great satisfaction how
promptly and responsibly they
have acted. We hoped that the
Executive Committee of the
Academic Council, in particular
might arrive at solutions to the
problems we posed.
We understand that faculty
and administrative mechanisms
are now operating to meet the
specific problems we noted, and
we think that this response indi
cates a strengthening of the
long-ineffectual lines of communi
cation. We understand too, how
ever. that rumor-mongers on

j campus have worked with a few!
i fragments of information to
i raise distorted issues and unreal j
j problems.
j We fear that they may do seri- •
i ous damage to the process of dis
j cussion. We have chosen to make ,•
known the contents of our report |
so that we may redirect student !
attention and prevent: irresponsi
ble reactions. We hope that intol- j
ligent faculty members, adminis-1
trators, and students will respond
in a way most beneficial for the
University.
We think the situation difficult
and painful—but one lhat a great
university can confront and over
come.
