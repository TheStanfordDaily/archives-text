## Statement Alleges Infringements On Academic Freedom 
### JON ROISE NANCY L. STEFFEN 
The former chairmen of Men's and Women's Councils have
released an official report highly critical of past actions and atti
tudes of several Stanford deans.
Speaker of LASSU Ed Shaw has called a special session of the
Legislature tonight at 7:30 in Room 214 to discuss the report
The 16-page statement, written by Darrell Halverson, chairman
of Men's Council and Judicial Council last spring, and Nora Crow,
head of Women's Council Autumn Quarter, charges that Dean
Allen "h as demonstrated her misunderstanding of the student judi-

ciary in her attempts to control"
its 'politics.'"
SHE "DOES NOT recognize
Women's Council as an indepen
dent organization .. . land J thinks
of the council as part of hor ad
j ministrative staff ..." the report
j continues.
! According to the report, th c
Dean of Women "attributed some
of t he problems which occur
among freshmen to the salacious
materials they study in Freshman
English and to the erotic approach
adopted by many of the younger
professors."
Dean Allen, the report alleges,
asked the; members of Women's
Council to take notes in th e i r
; English classes on anything objec
i tionable they heard.
"She requested that they write
I down the name of the teacher,
j and the substance of his re
marks. . . . The two council mem
bers who had jurisdiction over
the freshmen dormitories might
obtain names and notes from the
freshman girls. ..."
Dean Alien told the council that
the information would be given to
the senior members of the depart
ment, who could then reprimand
thoir colleagues.
WHEN JIISS CROW asked
whether such information would
influence promotional decisions,
ihe Dean replied that the pro
fessors in question did not deserve
promotion.
The report, also discusses
the role of Dean of Students Don
ald H. Winbigler in last year's
Frank Morse ease. It accuses Win
bigler of inconsistency in his de
cisions, and of attempting to ap
ply pressure on the judicial coun
-1 eils involved.
The report states that the Dean
informed Halverson and then
chairman of Women's Council
Marion Leib that Morse's suspen
sion was due, at least in part, to
his "schizophrenia."
! WHEN HALVERSON ques
i tioned Winbigler's competency to
| make such a diagnosis and won-i
dered aloud as to how the Stan-j
I ford community would react to ;
; it, the Dean allegedly replied. "It j
; you make that public, so help me, I
j I'll shoot you!"
"We do not challenge the .judi
cial system itself so much as we
question the Deans' consistency
in observing judicial procedures," l
Halverson and Miss Crow state j
in the report. "We do not chal- j
j lenge the Deans themselves; we
'question their handling of some j
| unusual cases."
| The statement quotes Dr. John ]
ID. Black of the Counselling and
j Testing Service on the problems!
I of the administrator who "is

asked to balance has responsibili
ties to the student body and the
institution as a whole against the
rights of an individual student,"
and suggests that such an admin
istrator should be "no longer dis
ciplinarian, but only counselor."
In conclusion, the report urges
that any future Judicial Council
"preclude the possibility of fur
ther hurt feelings by defining
more clearly the role of a stu
dent council member.
"At the same time it might
work with the Dean's Office in de
fining and promulgating all un
written university policies, especi
ally in regard to the controversial
problems of liquor, promiscuity,
and homosexuality."
Late last night Shaw issued a
statement praising Halverson and
Miss Crow for bring the report
"to the proper authorities in the
prescribed manner" and thank
ing "those authorities, both fac
ulty and administration, |who)
have acted in good faith and
moved rapidly and effectively in
determining the proper actions to
take."
At 12:20 this morning, The
Daily endeavored to contact Dean
Allen for a statement but was un
able to reach her.
