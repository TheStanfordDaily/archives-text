# TMU Board Considers Censorship
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM News Editor 
The Tresidder Union Board is
debating what criteria to follow
in the selection of magazines
for the Tresidder Uni on
Store.
The key issue is whether the
board, a nine-member student ad
visory group, should have the
right to decide which periodicals
are sold at the store on the basis
of content.
MEANWHILE, the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a cam
pus political organization, has en
tered the arena with a statement
of recommendations of its own
and some sharp criticism of the
TMU board.
Tuesday night the board will
meet "in an effort to clarify the
criteria for the selection of all
publications and periodicals sold
in the store" in the words of Tom
Riles, president of the Board.
The board met on Monday and
drafted an "incomplete policy,"
but Riles said no formal state
ment regarding its contents would
be released until the board ap
proves a final policy.
HE DID SAY there was some
difference of opinion among the
members of the board, particu
larly concerning the "content" j
question.
He also said the proposed pol-,
icy. as it stands, is "not intended '
as a form of censorship."
The Tresidder Union Commit-;
tee, a student-faculty group, con-!
sidcred the tentative proposal)
Tuesday and agreed to leave the
matter in the hands of the Union
Board, Riles said.
THE PRESENT controversy j
over Union Board "censorship" is ;
a revival of a dispute that de- j
veloped over the board's decision
last quarter to remove the "Rea
list," a satire and humor maga
zine, from the shelves of the TMU
store.
The magazine was removed
then because of lack of demand
and because it was found "objec
tionable." The action came in re
sponse to an outside complaint
about the magazine.
Riles said (lie board considered j
the inclusion of provisions in its |
policy statement to deal with,
such complaints at its meeting!
Monday.
The board also considered the
statement of recommendations
submitted by t lie Academic Free
dom Committee of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee which
declared "it is rarely ever excus-j
able to consider content wh en
establishing guidelines for re-1
moval of periodicals from cam
pus distribution."
IN ADDITION, the statement
urged more space be made avail
able for publications at the store '
In the meaptime ,a spokesman J
tor the GCC charged that the
Union Board has become "autono- j
mous" and has not submitted its,
decisions to the Legislature for
approval as LASSU By-Laws re
quire.
TIIE LASSU Constitution states
board decisions shall "become ef
fective when approved by a ma
jority vote of the Legislature."
Ed Shaw, LASSU speaker, last
night substantiated the charge.!
When asked about the matter.
Riles had no comment.
Also the GCC has raised doubts
that the board members, who an
naually appoint their own sue-!
cessors, have ever received
LASSU approval ;is is required. 1
HII.ES SAID he was under the
impression that approval was
given last spring, but Shaw iri
he had no recollection of the
event.
Official sources have reported
that four members of the board
are in Rile's fraternity. Delta
