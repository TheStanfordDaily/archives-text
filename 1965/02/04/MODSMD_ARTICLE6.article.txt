# Bircher Expounds Group Philosophy

j "Young people, did you know that 7,000 human beings per
hour have gone under Communist domination since 1945?"
So speaking, the man in the sober business suit held up a pie
, ture of a good-looking young man in uniform.
i The man in uniform was Captain John Birch.

The man speaking was Charles*
I Ripley, engineer, member of the
J San Jose chapter of the John
jßirch society (also of the Atomic
Gun Club of San Jose and th o
National Rifle Association).
{ Along with Hugh Fine, local
i field co-ordinator, he spoke last
j night in Cubberley to an increas-
I ingly thin audience on the aims,
! organization, finance, history,
communication, principles, agen
' da. and work of the John Birch
j Society.
"WE'RE AT WAR," said Fine.
! "The sooner every red-blooded
American realizes this, the safer
we'll be."
The problem of arousing con
cern among Americans so th a t
"they'll be out of their chairs on
j their two hind legs, ready to go
into action," is mainly one of edu
cation, according to Fine and Rip
| ley.
Ignorance as well as apathy is
one of the main blocks to a full
realization of the extent and na
ture of the Communist threat,
which is designed to undermine
i and destroy our way of life, Fine
I said.
TO ILLUSTRATE this ignor
j ance, he asked the audience how
1 many had ever heard of Major
Jordan. One person raised his
hand.
"My, what's happened in his
tory classes today?" Fine re
! marked. Major Jordan, lie ex
: plained, was a man who found cer
' lain suspicious documents being
1 shipped overseas while expediting
11ho Lend-Lease Act during the
war.
Having hied to tell his story
J to various people in Washington.
• Jordan eventually talked to a
] Man at (he Top Hairy Hopkins,)
I confidante of Roosevelt who;
j told him. "For Cod's sake, keep!
your mouth shut about this."
AM) .lOKi)AN IH1) but he
| kept a diary, Fine said, selections
from which are included in one
of twelve "suppressed" books,
called the twelve "candles," put
(Mil I>\ I 111 1 S< M'icl \ .

"For the past 20-30 years, mass
media have refused to report
news objectively," Fine said.
Reports of any connection of
the Birch Society to the Minute
men are "baseless smears."
But. "anyone who'll take tho
timo to sit down with certain
public documents can find the
facts." For example:
• Russia's firing power is
steadily increasing, while our
military force is cut down. "One
study shows that the Marines are
becoming a social-action group
rather than fighting men."
• Earl Warren had no judicial
experience at the time of his ap
pointment; "his decisions showj
abysmal ignorance and contempt i
for the most fundamental prin-1
ciples of law."
• In 1930, a history teacher in i
Russia told his class. "War to the J
! hilt is inevitable between commu-1
| nists and capitalists. We won't be j
i strong enough to attack for 20
to 30 years. Then we will need
■ an element of surprise — so we'll
wage a campaign of peace, and
the stupid and decadent capitalists
| will leap to co-operate in their
! own destruction."
Reading from a table of organi
zation placed on an easel and be
ginning with the motto, "Strategy
-Education. Weapon -Truth;"
Ripley elucidated Ihe aims of the
(society with a pithiness that
: would do credit to Benjamin,
Franklin.
"WE WANT to get the U.N. out !
of the U.S. and the U.S. out of j
the U.N. Talk about democracy." j
(Pregnant pause.) "The situation'
is absurd."
"Support your local police," he
advised. Reports in the mass me
dia are designed 1o depict all
. police as brutal, he said. A man
! in the audience slowly nodded his
I head.
The main goal of the society,
however, is the recruiting of one
million members. "When all of us
! drop our grains of sand together,
we have an effect. . . . we rise
above the herd."
Ripley concluded by quoting an
old proverb: "All that is required
for evil to triumph is that good I
men do nothing."

Reports of any connection of

j "Young people, did you know that 7,000 human beings per
hour have gone under Communist domination since 1945?"
So speaking, the man in the sober business suit held up a pie
, ture of a good-looking young man in uniform.
i The man in uniform was Captain John Birch.

The man speaking was Charles*
I Ripley, engineer, member of the
J San Jose chapter of the John
jßirch society (also of the Atomic
Gun Club of San Jose and th o
National Rifle Association).
{ Along with Hugh Fine, local
i field co-ordinator, he spoke last
j night in Cubberley to an increas-
I ingly thin audience on the aims,
! organization, finance, history,
communication, principles, agen
' da. and work of the John Birch
j Society.
"WE'RE AT WAR," said Fine.
! "The sooner every red-blooded
American realizes this, the safer
we'll be."
The problem of arousing con
cern among Americans so th a t
"they'll be out of their chairs on
j their two hind legs, ready to go
into action," is mainly one of edu
cation, according to Fine and Rip
| ley.
Ignorance as well as apathy is
one of the main blocks to a full
realization of the extent and na
ture of the Communist threat,
which is designed to undermine
i and destroy our way of life, Fine
I said.
TO ILLUSTRATE this ignor
j ance, he asked the audience how
1 many had ever heard of Major
Jordan. One person raised his
hand.
"My, what's happened in his
tory classes today?" Fine re
! marked. Major Jordan, lie ex
: plained, was a man who found cer
' lain suspicious documents being
1 shipped overseas while expediting
11ho Lend-Lease Act during the
war.

J to various people in Washington.

your mouth shut about this."

from which are included in one

"For the past 20-30 years, mass
media have refused to report
news objectively," Fine said.
Reports of any connection of
the Birch Society to the Minute
men are "baseless smears."
But. "anyone who'll take tho
timo to sit down with certain
public documents can find the
facts." For example:
• Russia's firing power is
steadily increasing, while our
military force is cut down. "One
study shows that the Marines are
becoming a social-action group
rather than fighting men."
• Earl Warren had no judicial
experience at the time of his ap
pointment; "his decisions showj
