## JAZZ TRACK Tjader At Tin Pan Alley 
### HICK BALK 
During the summer of 1960 at
the now defunct Outside at the
Inside on High Street in Palo
Alto, Cal Tjader brought in a
quintet which spent most of the
warm nights drawing in capacity
crowds to the club-without-a-roof.
Anyone within three blocks
could hear the frenzied latin solos
of percussionist Mongo Santa
maria, and people were already
beginning to get interested in the
short follow with the handlebar
mustache, an unknown pianist
named Vince Guaraldi.
Returning for his first extended
I tftay in the Peninsula for quite a
I while, Tjader opened last night
at Bernie Kahn's Tin Pan Alley
in Redwood City. The mustached
pianist has long since gone on
to fame with Brazilian guitarist
Bola Sete, and Santamaria's place
as percussionist has been assumed
by the equally dynamic Armando
Perazza, formerly of the George
Shearing group.
Tjader's week engagement at
Tin Pan Alley will be somewhat
unique, as there will be both
listening and dancing on a no
minimum or cover policy. Those
of you over 21, whether you are
an accomplished latin dancer or
just dig Afro-Cuban jazz sounds,
should have a great time.
Hotel Claremoiit
The Horizon Room of the Hotel
Claremont which recently hosted
the very successful two week run
of Guaraldi and Sete, will open
the Stan Getz quartet Saturday
night for a two week engagement.
Astrud Gilberto has very recently
left the group of her own volition,
to everyone's musical good except
hers. Without the sensitive back
ing of Getz, she will undoubtedly
fall apart, while the Getz quartet,
treed of the inhibiting factor, will
play twice as good jazz and make
half as much money. Courtesy,
the ever culture sensitive Ameri
can audience.. .
The current quartet, which
made its San Francisco debut
with two concerts last November,
is an interesting conglomeration.
Joe Hunt, recently involved in the
"October Revolution" of the Av
ant Garde jazz movement in New '

York, is often brilliant, often in
comprehensible on drums.
Gene Cherico, a Harvard gradu
ate in biology, is on bass, and the
group's most up-and-coming tal
ent, 21 year old Gary Burton, is
featured on vibes. With Burton's
delicate but dramatic treatment,
especially of his own works, and
the front running of the veteran
Getz, the group is approaching the
sensitivity and cohesiveness of
the Modern Jazz Quartet. L'
Horizon is inexpensive and open
to those under 21.
