## A 						Summary of Top Bay Area Entertainment 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
If you like Dixieland music, there's a group playing every Friday
night at the Vieni Qui on El Camino in Palo Alto (not far south
of Stanford). The group is called Emperor Norton's Jass Band —
a spelling that antedates "jazz"—and is composed entirely of non
professionals who do it "as a way to have fun, just for kicks." They
start about 9 and go until 2, although banjoist Turn Rudy says they
don't really begin to swing until their clarinetist arrives about 11.

BAREFOOT IN THE PARK is at the Geary in San Francisco (see

FILMS
A 3IAN ESCAPED is a tension filled French film about a prison
break. Directed by Robert Bresson, it is at Tresidder today.
THE MAN IN THE WHITE SCIT stars Alec Guinness in a classic
movie about a man who invents an extraordinarily longlasting fabric
and causes havoc in the textile industry.
STATION SIX SAHARA stars Carroll Baker as the only woman
at a lonely outpost in the Sahara desert. Needless to say, it's at the
flicks Sunday.
LAWRENCE OF ARABIA at the Park, is the visually magnifi
cent film based on the life of T. E. Lawrence. Peter O'Toole gives a
dazzlingly brilliant performance in the title role, aided by a huge—
and excellent—all male cast and by Robert Bolt's literate script and
David Lean's sensitive direction. A featurette on Japan completes the
bill.
3IARY POPPINS is the delightful Walt Disney musical about a
"practically perfect" English nanny and the adventures on which
she leads her charges. In the title role of this movie at the Varsity,
Julie Andrews is indeed perfect.
TOPKAPI, at the Fine Arts, stars Melina Mcrcouri as a woman
equally in love with emeralds and men—usually using the latter
to get the former. Maximillian Schell, Peter Ustinov, and a fabu
lously jeweled dagger are on view as some of the objects of her
affection. THAT 31 AN FRO3I RIO. a mad chase-comedy starring
Jean-Paul Belmondo, is the second feature.
Till"; PUMPKIN EATER is the controversial British film starring
Anne Bancroft—in an award winning performance—as a mentally
disturbed woman. Peter Finch and James Mason also have leading
roles. Ingmar Bergman's stunning THE VIRGIN SPRING, starring
Max Von Sydow, is also on the bill at the Guild.
QUICK BEFORE IT MELTS is a new comedy about men in the
Antarctic, with Robert Morse and George Maharis as two of the
men. At the Paris, it is coupled with THE VIP'S, the Elizabeth Tay
lor-Richard Burton film about a group of passengers stranded at
the London airport. Outstanding in the large, star-studded east is
Margaret Rutherford in an Oscar winning performance.
PSYCHO is the Alfred Hitchcock movie with Anthony Perkins
and Janet Leigh who gets stabbed in the shower in perhaps the
film's most famous scene. BLOOD AND ROSi;s, starring Mel Ferrer,
rounds out the gory bill at. the Stanford.
GOLDFINGER stars Sean Connery as James Bond in this, the
third of lan Fleming's books to be filmed, and it looks like it may
stay at the Bijou forever.
OTH ER
THE SAN FRANCISCO BALLET will be performing in Memorial
Auditorium Monday night. Included on the program will be a new
"Pop Art" ballet with a libretto by Herb Caen.
THE TANGENT in Palo Alto is still presenting Saturday's Chil
dren—a folksinging group—and Buddy Bohn.
