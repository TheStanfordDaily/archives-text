# ‘Barefoot In The Park’ Lives Up To Publicity
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
In "Barefoot In The Park" one
finds that theatrical rarity -— a
show that lives up to its press
releases. Described in its publi
city as the funniest play ever
written, "Barefoot" breezed into
the Geary Monday night for a
four week stand.
As .staged by Mike Nichols, this
Neil Simon comedy is, if not the
funniest ever written, at least the
funniest this reviewer has seen. I
Merrily rolling from one punch
line to the next —with barely
enough time in between to
breathe —"Barefoot" is, really, no
more than a flyweight situation
comedy with a plot that is totally
predictable disguised under lines
that: are hilariously original.
Although Simon's ability as a
dramatist is just adequate, his
ability as a quippcr is so great
that the play is never allowed to
bog down in the banality of its '
plot. Example: at the end of a j
serious mother - to-newlywed- j
daughter talk, the mother con- j
eludes "Make him feel important. \
If you do that, you'll have a happy j
and wonderful marriage, like two !
cut of every ten couples."
Flawless Cast
Simon is not solely responsible j
for the play's success. He is aided
in this production—as apparently
he also was in New York—by an
almost flawless cast.
As Corie, the bride of less than a
week, Joan Van Ark is a blonde
bumblebee —darting all ov>r the
stage with seemingly inexhaust
ible energy. She delightfully sug
gests all the tomboyish qualities
ol a girl who wants to go walking
barefoot in the park in February
without ever seeming unfeminine.
Richard Benjamin, as Corie's
lawyer husband Paul, is a truly
gifted comedian. Whether placing
his tie in the unabridged diction
ary to be pressed or staggering
in after having carried his
mother-in-law up six flights of
steps, he shows a brilliant flair
for comic timing and provides an
admirable foil for Miss Van Ark.
Myrna Marvelous
Myrna Loy is marvelous as
Corie's mother, a pill-swallowing
New Jersey housewife who sleeps
on a board and sends her daughter
wedding presents twice a day. She
can shuffle around the stage in
a man's bathrobe an d slippers
—and try to explain the situation
to Corie—or drunkenly com
miserate with an equally soused I
Paul with the ease of a practiced ;
comedienne.
As Corie and Paul's epicurean !
upstairs neighbor, Sandor Szabo
provides several amusing mom
ents. Although at times a bit over- i
done, his portrayal is generally i
quite good. Lou Tiano and Paul |
Haney, in smaller roles, are both j
excellent.
Director Nichols' unfailingly j
comic touch, responsible for keep- [

ing "Barefoot" moving at the
necessarily frantic pace, also de
serves major credit for the show's
success. Oliver Smith's step-filled
set and Jean Rosenthal's cos
tumes help considerably in es
tablishing the mood of the play.
They are especially valuable in
giving the audience an insight
into the character of Corie, effec
tively exemplifying her somewhat
naive romanticism.

can shuffle around the stage in
a man's bathrobe an d slippers
—and try to explain the situation
to Corie—or drunkenly com
miserate with an equally soused I
Paul with the ease of a practiced ;
comedienne.
As Corie and Paul's epicurean !
upstairs neighbor, Sandor Szabo
provides several amusing mom
ents. Although at times a bit over- i
done, his portrayal is generally i
quite good. Lou Tiano and Paul |
Haney, in smaller roles, are both j
excellent.
Director Nichols' unfailingly j
comic touch, responsible for keep- [

ing "Barefoot" moving at the
necessarily frantic pace, also de
serves major credit for the show's
success. Oliver Smith's step-filled
set and Jean Rosenthal's cos
tumes help considerably in es
tablishing the mood of the play.
They are especially valuable in
giving the audience an insight
into the character of Corie, effec
tively exemplifying her somewhat
naive romanticism.
In "Barefoot In The Park" one
finds that theatrical rarity -— a
show that lives up to its press
releases. Described in its publi
city as the funniest play ever
written, "Barefoot" breezed into
the Geary Monday night for a
four week stand.
As .staged by Mike Nichols, this
Neil Simon comedy is, if not the
funniest ever written, at least the
funniest this reviewer has seen. I
Merrily rolling from one punch
line to the next —with barely
enough time in between to
breathe —"Barefoot" is, really, no
more than a flyweight situation
comedy with a plot that is totally
predictable disguised under lines
that: are hilariously original.
Although Simon's ability as a
dramatist is just adequate, his
ability as a quippcr is so great
that the play is never allowed to
bog down in the banality of its '
plot. Example: at the end of a j
serious mother - to-newlywed- j
daughter talk, the mother con- j
eludes "Make him feel important. \
If you do that, you'll have a happy j
and wonderful marriage, like two !
cut of every ten couples."
Flawless Cast
Simon is not solely responsible j
for the play's success. He is aided
in this production—as apparently
he also was in New York—by an
almost flawless cast.
As Corie, the bride of less than a
week, Joan Van Ark is a blonde
bumblebee —darting all ov>r the
stage with seemingly inexhaust
ible energy. She delightfully sug
gests all the tomboyish qualities
ol a girl who wants to go walking
barefoot in the park in February
without ever seeming unfeminine.
Richard Benjamin, as Corie's
lawyer husband Paul, is a truly
gifted comedian. Whether placing
his tie in the unabridged diction
ary to be pressed or staggering
in after having carried his
mother-in-law up six flights of
steps, he shows a brilliant flair
for comic timing and provides an
admirable foil for Miss Van Ark.
Myrna Marvelous
Myrna Loy is marvelous as
Corie's mother, a pill-swallowing
New Jersey housewife who sleeps
on a board and sends her daughter
wedding presents twice a day. She
can shuffle around the stage in
a man's bathrobe an d slippers
—and try to explain the situation
to Corie—or drunkenly com
miserate with an equally soused I
Paul with the ease of a practiced ;
comedienne.
