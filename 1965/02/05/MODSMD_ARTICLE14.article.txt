# Williams Proves Dickens Not Dull
## 
### JOHN THAYER 
One approaches a public read
ing of any novelist's works with
a certain amount of apprehension,
a result of having heard count- !
less well-meaning but deathly j
boring renditions of Lassie and ;
Anne of Green Gables during
those elementary school rest
periods.
And one approaches a reading
of Dickens doubly apprehensive,
with memories of having been
dragged, kicking and screaming, i
through the seemingly impenetra- |
ble ponderosity of David Copper- i
field sometime before graduating
from high school.
Tt is to Emlyn Williams' ever
lasting credit that he succeds not
only in dispelling the apprehen
cion but also in actually making
his audience eager to take down
those musty old volumes and see
what they've been missing all
these years. For without doubt,
Williams as "Charles Dickens,
Giving a Solo Performance of
Scenes from the Novels." is that
rare occurrence, an actor of
genius reading a novelist of
genius.
And il is no more reading,
either: with his only props the
books and a desk, he mixes in
comparable inflections and ac
cents with a few priceless facial
expressions, and creates a veri
table forest of characters, one
right after the other.
They range from the school
mistress, "ogress and child quel
lor." who produced "mental green
peas at Christmas and intellec
tual asparagus all the year
round," to Mrs. Myrtle, who had
"a capital bosom to hang jewels
upon, and Mr. Myrtle had bought
it for just that purpose." (One
realizes with a shock that Dickens
is actually funny, a rather unset
tling discovery.)
His serious selections on the
whole are less successful than the
comic ones, tending to become i
forced and cheaply melodra
matic, especially in "The Black
Veil," which is not good at all.
Everywhere else, however, he is |
his own inimitable self, and
ought to be required listening for j
all those who think Dickens dull. 1
He isn't, and Emlyn Williams can j
prove it.
