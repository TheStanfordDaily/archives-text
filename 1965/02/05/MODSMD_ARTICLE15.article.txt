# Conference Standing At Stake
## Hoopsters Carry Hopes North 
### PETE KING 
After a three-week lay-off from
conference action, Stanford's
basketball team ventures north
this weekend for a pair of games
with Oregon and Oregon State.
The Indians face Oregon tonight
at 8 p.m. and Oregon State tomor
row night at the same time.
Currently in a five-way tie for
second place in the Pacific Ath
letic Conference with a 2-2 record,
Stanford must at least gain a
split in the two-game set to re
main in contention. That won't
be easy, since the Tribe has a 2-5
road record so far. Oregon is also
2-2 in the conference and 8-8 over
all, while OSU stands 1-3 and
8-5.
IN EARLIER nonconference
contests, Stanford was edged by
OSU, 61-60, then came back to
overwhelm Oregon, 74-56, both
games played up north. However,
while Oregon State is about the
same team that beat the Indians,
the Oregon Ducks have improved
rapidly.
Jim Barnett, a 6-4 Duck guard,
has scored at least 12 points in
his last eight games, averaging
19.6 points. He can break a game
open, having scored over 30
points three times. Backing him
up is forward Nick Jones, who
has recently emerged as a dan
gerous fast break threat, with a
10-point average.
Elsewhere the Ducks feature
6-10 center Gone Brockmeyer,
good for about 10 points and as
many rebounds, and forward Bill
Jennings, averaging 14 points.
THE DUCKS are rebounding
from a dismal start, and have won
three of their last four. What
they lack in shooting accuracy
they make up for in agressiveness

and hustle. In Stanford's earlier
74-56 victory, the Tribe outshot
Oregon from the foul line, 24-8.
However, recent TV games indi
cate the Ducks have added finesse
to their muscle.
Oregon State is a wholly differ
ent team. Guard Jim Jarvis is the
conference's leading scorer, with
a 25.0 overage. However, after
him there isn't much. Forward
Charlie White and 6-6 center Ed
Fredenberg have looked good on
occasions.

But generally the Beavers de
pend on a methodical offense, al
ways looking for the 15-foot
screen shot. They were able to
beat the Tribe before by shooting
50 per cent from the outside to
overcome Stanford's ability to
work the ball inside for numer
ous short shots which wouldn't
drop.
Stanford has enjoyed balanced
scoring in the last few games
from Ray Kosanke, Kent Hinck
ley, Bob Bedell, and Clayton
Raaka. Hinckley ctiul aie
battling for the team scoring
lead, with 14.5 and 14.3 averages,
respectively. Kosanke sank 38
points in the two Santa Bar
bara games, and raised his aver
age to 12.0. he also has passed
Raaka in rebounding, 107-105.
KOSANKK may prove the key
in the two weekend games. He
moved practically at will under
neath the basket against OSU
earlier, but couldn't sink the close
shots. His accuracy has vastly
improved lately. Oregon's Brock
meyer will give Kosanke a battle
on the Oregon's offensive boards,
but he can be faked out consist
ently on defense, as Washington
State's Ted Werner has proven.
Stanford's next four games are
with the Oregon teams, with two
contests here next week. The In
dians need at least three victories
to hope for a second place finish
benind UCLA.
