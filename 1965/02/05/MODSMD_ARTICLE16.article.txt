# Indian Wrestlers Host High Ranking Beavers
## 
### 
Intent upon improving t he i r
performance from their last two
meets in which they were soundly
defeated 26-10 and 27-fi, the Stan
ford wrestling squad will defin
itely have their hands full tonight
when they oppose Oregon State.
Oregon State was ranked 10th
nationally in a pre-season pre
view and from the caliber of then
past performances and returning
personel they should live up to
this rating. Last season Oregon
State swept the Pacific Coast Con
ference. Two Coast champions are
on this year's squad.
RETURNING are Art Makin
ster, heavyweighl contender, and
177-pounder Len Kauffman, both
1964 PCC champions. Makinster
continued his fine wrestling last
year and garnered third place in
the AAU in the Greco-Roman divi
sion.
Not to be outdone Kauffman
placed third in the NCAA tourna
ment at 167 lbs. and won an award
for the most falls (four) in cham
pionship competition. He barely
lost to the eventual champion 9-6.
Last year he was an alternate on
the Olympic wrestling team.
With Stanford having to forfeit
the first three contests because of
lack ol' participants, the only pos
sible highlight of the evening may
come in the heavyweight class. To
date Bruce Wilhelm is undefeated
showing an outstanding combina
tion of his size and strength with
speed and agility.

HOWEVER, if there is a match
for Wilhelm it is Makinster. A
nod will have to bo given to Mak
inster. His experience will play an
important part in this match.
This is Wilhelm's first year out
for collego wrestling.
A frosh match against Chabot
Jr. College will l)e held before
the varsity match at 6:00. Chabot
has a 14-1 record this year while
Stanford's freshmen have also
showed plenty of talent. They de
feated San Fernando Valley
State's varsity team 29-9. The var
sitv match should commencp at.
8:00 in the Pavilion.
