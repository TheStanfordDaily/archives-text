# New League Adds Incentive To Freshman Baseball Programs
## 
### ROBERT THIERIOT 
Freshman baseball takes on a
new perspective this spring with
the innovation of a six team Bay
Area league consisting of teams
from Stanford, California, Santa
Clara, USF, S.F. State, and San
Jose. The Bay Area Freshman
Baseball League will be the first
frosh league in Stanford history.
What this league means to base
ball fans is more exciting competi
tion and a tangible goal for frosh
baseball. Rather than playing al
most half its games against high
school teams, Stanford will now
play exclusively college squads.
THERE WILL BE a 22 game
schedule with only two non-league
games against Menlo College.
Frosh coach Ray Young, who is
the league representative this

year, was one of the leaders in
setting up the league. He is very
enthusiastic, as he feels the
league will promote a higher
grade of play at the frosh level.
Vying for the league champion
ship will be three schools who
sported fantastic records last
year. Santa Clara (20-2), Cal (24-
3), and Stanford (23-2) should
stage a great three-way battle
for top spot. Because there is a
complete turn over in personel
each year at the frosh level, the
other three members could insert
a "dark horse" into the league
standings.
The Bay Area * reshman Base
ball League has one very inter
esting rule change—the use of
"speed-up rules." These are de
signed to prevent the games from
dragging. For example, a cour

tesy runner may replace the pitch
er on the basepaths at any time.
The pitcher does not have to leave
the game. Intentional walks will
be given to a batter without the
throwing of any pitches, thus
eliminating the necessity of de
livering four "pitches." These
speed-up rules will be used as an
experiment in half of every team's
games.
STANFORD opens its season
February 20 here with Santa
Clara. The new league will make
each game vital. In a short sched
ule no team can afford to fall too
far behind.
Other additions to this year's
baseball scene will be a new
electric scoreboard for the var
sity diamond and a new playing
field for the freshman, which has
a grass infield.

baseball scene will be a new
electric scoreboard for the var
sity diamond and a new playing
field for the freshman, which has
a grass infield.
Freshman baseball takes on a
new perspective this spring with
the innovation of a six team Bay
Area league consisting of teams
from Stanford, California, Santa
Clara, USF, S.F. State, and San
Jose. The Bay Area Freshman
Baseball League will be the first
frosh league in Stanford history.
What this league means to base
ball fans is more exciting competi
tion and a tangible goal for frosh
baseball. Rather than playing al
most half its games against high
school teams, Stanford will now
play exclusively college squads.
THERE WILL BE a 22 game
schedule with only two non-league
games against Menlo College.
Frosh coach Ray Young, who is
the league representative this

year, was one of the leaders in
setting up the league. He is very
enthusiastic, as he feels the
league will promote a higher
grade of play at the frosh level.
Vying for the league champion
ship will be three schools who
sported fantastic records last
year. Santa Clara (20-2), Cal (24-
3), and Stanford (23-2) should
stage a great three-way battle
for top spot. Because there is a
complete turn over in personel
each year at the frosh level, the
other three members could insert
a "dark horse" into the league
standings.
The Bay Area * reshman Base
ball League has one very inter
esting rule change—the use of
"speed-up rules." These are de
signed to prevent the games from
dragging. For example, a cour

tesy runner may replace the pitch
er on the basepaths at any time.
The pitcher does not have to leave
the game. Intentional walks will
be given to a batter without the
throwing of any pitches, thus
eliminating the necessity of de
livering four "pitches." These
speed-up rules will be used as an
experiment in half of every team's
games.
STANFORD opens its season
February 20 here with Santa
Clara. The new league will make
each game vital. In a short sched
ule no team can afford to fall too
far behind.
Other additions to this year's
baseball scene will be a new
electric scoreboard for the var
sity diamond and a new playing
field for the freshman, which has
a grass infield.
