# Greek Week Chariots Feature Pigs, Cherries, And Coldfinger
## 
### BILL WERTZ 
Greek Week roared into high
gear yesterday with an exciting,
colorful chariot race that seemed
1o include everything: pretty
girls and pigs, motorcycles and
wheelbarrows, Hoover Tower and
the Ku Klux Klan in two colors. I
Held on Lasuen between the
post office and Campus Drive, the
race attracted a restless, noisy'
crowd that watched from balcon- :
ies and trees along the row, lined '
the entire course of the race and .
found time between races to over- '
turn an old car in front of the ;
FIJI house.
ATO's golden chariot was the
first to pull up to the starting 1
line with its queen a pig, j
strangely quiet and skinny, re
membering last year's heavy- j
weight entry which tore apart the |
trunk of the car in which it was !
caged.
PERHAPS because of their slen-:
derized queen, the ATO's had 110 !
trouble defeating Chi Psi in the;
first race.
The Betas' queen, in a crash
helmet and racing driver's flame- .
proof suit, seemed to be expecting i
a little too much speed, as she
lost by a substantial margain to j
the Alpha Sigs.
The Alpha Sigs met the K.A.'s !
as well as the ATO's in the finals j
of the speed contest, and only the I

pig lost as K.A. and Alpha Sig
raced to a tio.
WINNERS OF the humor cata
gory were the Phi Kappa, whose
chariot was pulled by six men,
trying futilely to reach a cherry
held over their heads by a com

plex Rube Goldberg-like arrange
ment of levers and wires.
The DKE chariot was supposed
to feature not Goldfinger, but a
silver one called Coldfinger. Ice
cubes were thrown to the crowd
for emphasis.


FASTER THAN A GREEKED PIG-ln the first
event of Greek Week—the notorious chariot
races of Lasuen Street—Alpha Sig and the KA's
raced through a throng of contestants to tie
in a final heat against the ATO's, who tra
ditionally carry a pig as their queen. Many

vehicles of speed and humor appeared to
entertain the masses, but one highlight of the
day occured when a jubilant Theta Chi
"wheelied" his motorcycle into a crowd of
spectators.
