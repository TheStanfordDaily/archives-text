# The 						Inside Pitch
## Indians Undefeated In Pavilion But Away... 
### Pete King 
One of basketball's most fascinating aspects, and one which Stan
ford coach Howie Dallmar probably did some hard thinking about I
over the weekend, is the phenomenon known as the home court ad
vantage.
Last Thursday the Indians hosted the Santa Barbara Gauchos, a
lower division team from a lower division league, the Western Ath
letic Conference. The crowd was in a festive mood, and was soon
rewarded with the humorous attempts of the Gauchos to play basket
ball. a game apparently recently introduced to them. After about 15
uaucno""Bail"comTui ~~ei tu is and - -Ifidfer.-•
Stanford took its biggest halftime lead in several years, 46-20.
The Tribe went on to win easily, 87-57, and had a two-day rest in j
the southland sunshine before facing Santa Barabara again on the
Gaucho court.
As the Saturday game got underway, Stanford radio listeners
must have wondered whether the Indians were playing the same
team. True, Don I\!ein was describing the action in his usual cliche
a-seeond style, expounding on Kent Hinckley's complete basketball
record from sixth grade on, while the Indians were sinking several
foul shots.
Nonetheless, something was definitely wrong. Stanford led by j
only one point at halftime, not 26. Fouls eliminated three forwards
Clayton Raaka, Bob Bedell, and Jack Gilbert. Santa Barbara began
sinking baskets and Stanford began losing. 85-84, as a matter of fact, j
How on earth can a team win by 30, then lose to the same oppo-1
nent two nights later? It is generally conceded that the home court i
advantage is worth 10 points to a team. But that's not the whole
story, since with Stanford teams in particular, the 10-point differen
tial seems to snowball.
SUCCESS WITHIN THE WOMB
It has long been a tendency of Stanford basketball teams to be j
phenomenally successful within the womb-like walls of Stanford
Pavilion, which has the smallest seating capacity of a major college j
gym on the Coast, and probably the worst soundproofing. It is also
an axiom that the Indians fall ill to myopia of the shooting eye when
on a road trip.
In the past four seasons, including the present one, Stanford has
compiled an amazing 37-6 won-loss record at home. At the same
time, the Cards have a sickly 22-24 away-from-hoine record, with
four of those victories over military dribbling wizards like the
Pearl Harbor Marines, which Stanford beat, 90-33.
Three years ago, Stanford won 17 straight at home before the
Oregon State traveling troupe, featuring Mel Counts and the four
little Beavers, ended the streak. The team currently has won eight
straight at home.
The only enemy gym where Stanford does relatively well is Cal's.
The Tribe has won four straight there, although they usually enjoy
loud support from a few local boosters.
That fact points to one home court advantage, the rooters. When
ever a sparkling play by a visiting team produces dead silence, while
every move of the local lads looses deafening cheers, there is bound
to be an effect on the players. Basketball players will tell you that
they don't hear the crowd when concentrating on a game. Thai may
be true for the visitors, but the home team definitely receives a lift
in spirits.
Moreover, the home team plays on a familiar court. The back
ground behind the baskets may confuse the visitors' shooting eyes. |
Also, the very floor surface can cause trouble. The University of
Washington pavilion is sinking into covered-over mud flats, which 1
means the groaning floor boards resemble the Pacific Ocean during ;
a monsoon. Frustrated guards may have a ball bounce nine differ
ent directions on a trip downcourt. By the time they complete that
ordeal, they probably have forgotten which play to call.
"HOMER" KEFS ALSO A FACTOR
A third factor is the referees. Although the Pacific Athletic Con- j
ference does better than most in obtaining competent officials, there
are inevitably some "homers" who always fail to see how the local!
team could lose- and call the game accordingly.
Impartiality is difficult even for the Ix'st ret's. For instance, either
Ernie Filiberti or Kill Bussenius are officials at most Stanford borne j
games. They are both fine referees, but they naturally bccome ac- i
customed to the moves of Stanford players. What a Northwest offi
cial may think is roughness when Kay Kosarike drives for a lay-up
or Clay Raaka fights for a rebound, another man who has seen these
moves time and again may take for granted.
This year Stanford has fouled about as many times as its oppo
nents. Yet in five of the seven away games, the referees have whistled j
more fouls on the Indians than on the opponents.
Finally, there are the psychological factors. A road trip can be
exhausting as well as depressing, if the players are stuck in a dull
town away from their girl friends, especially if they had to get up
early after a hard game, board a plane, find a hotel, practice, eat, and
play another game that afternoon. Oregon State ta good team),;
had to do that last month in order to play Washington State ta lousy
toam); so will Stanford. OSU lost.
All these factors added together still don't account for last week's }
31-point reversal of form. But they help explain that nice 37-6 record
in the Pavilion. With a winning gym like that, who needs a new one? i

As the Saturday game got underway, Stanford radio listeners
must have wondered whether the Indians were playing the same
team. True, Don I\!ein was describing the action in his usual cliche

record from sixth grade on, while the Indians were sinking several
foul shots.

How on earth can a team win by 30, then lose to the same oppo-1

advantage is worth 10 points to a team. But that's not the whole
story, since with Stanford teams in particular, the 10-point differen
tial seems to snowball.
SUCCESS WITHIN THE WOMB
It has long been a tendency of Stanford basketball teams to be j
phenomenally successful within the womb-like walls of Stanford
Pavilion, which has the smallest seating capacity of a major college j
gym on the Coast, and probably the worst soundproofing. It is also
an axiom that the Indians fall ill to myopia of the shooting eye when
on a road trip.
In the past four seasons, including the present one, Stanford has
compiled an amazing 37-6 won-loss record at home. At the same
time, the Cards have a sickly 22-24 away-from-hoine record, with
four of those victories over military dribbling wizards like the
Pearl Harbor Marines, which Stanford beat, 90-33.
Three years ago, Stanford won 17 straight at home before the
Oregon State traveling troupe, featuring Mel Counts and the four
little Beavers, ended the streak. The team currently has won eight
straight at home.
The only enemy gym where Stanford does relatively well is Cal's.
The Tribe has won four straight there, although they usually enjoy
loud support from a few local boosters.
That fact points to one home court advantage, the rooters. When
ever a sparkling play by a visiting team produces dead silence, while
every move of the local lads looses deafening cheers, there is bound
to be an effect on the players. Basketball players will tell you that
they don't hear the crowd when concentrating on a game. Thai may
be true for the visitors, but the home team definitely receives a lift
in spirits.
Moreover, the home team plays on a familiar court. The back
ground behind the baskets may confuse the visitors' shooting eyes. |
Also, the very floor surface can cause trouble. The University of
Washington pavilion is sinking into covered-over mud flats, which 1
means the groaning floor boards resemble the Pacific Ocean during ;
a monsoon. Frustrated guards may have a ball bounce nine differ
ent directions on a trip downcourt. By the time they complete that
ordeal, they probably have forgotten which play to call.
"HOMER" KEFS ALSO A FACTOR
A third factor is the referees. Although the Pacific Athletic Con- j
ference does better than most in obtaining competent officials, there
are inevitably some "homers" who always fail to see how the local!
team could lose- and call the game accordingly.
Impartiality is difficult even for the Ix'st ret's. For instance, either
Ernie Filiberti or Kill Bussenius are officials at most Stanford borne j
games. They are both fine referees, but they naturally bccome ac- i
customed to the moves of Stanford players. What a Northwest offi
cial may think is roughness when Kay Kosarike drives for a lay-up
or Clay Raaka fights for a rebound, another man who has seen these
moves time and again may take for granted.
This year Stanford has fouled about as many times as its oppo
nents. Yet in five of the seven away games, the referees have whistled j
more fouls on the Indians than on the opponents.
Finally, there are the psychological factors. A road trip can be
exhausting as well as depressing, if the players are stuck in a dull
town away from their girl friends, especially if they had to get up
early after a hard game, board a plane, find a hotel, practice, eat, and
play another game that afternoon. Oregon State ta good team),;
had to do that last month in order to play Washington State ta lousy
toam); so will Stanford. OSU lost.
All these factors added together still don't account for last week's }
31-point reversal of form. But they help explain that nice 37-6 record
in the Pavilion. With a winning gym like that, who needs a new one? i
One of basketball's most fascinating aspects, and one which Stan
ford coach Howie Dallmar probably did some hard thinking about I
over the weekend, is the phenomenon known as the home court ad
vantage.

The Tribe went on to win easily, 87-57, and had a two-day rest in j
the southland sunshine before facing Santa Barabara again on the
Gaucho court.
As the Saturday game got underway, Stanford radio listeners
must have wondered whether the Indians were playing the same
team. True, Don I\!ein was describing the action in his usual cliche
a-seeond style, expounding on Kent Hinckley's complete basketball
record from sixth grade on, while the Indians were sinking several
foul shots.
Nonetheless, something was definitely wrong. Stanford led by j
only one point at halftime, not 26. Fouls eliminated three forwards
Clayton Raaka, Bob Bedell, and Jack Gilbert. Santa Barbara began
sinking baskets and Stanford began losing. 85-84, as a matter of fact, j
How on earth can a team win by 30, then lose to the same oppo-1
nent two nights later? It is generally conceded that the home court i
advantage is worth 10 points to a team. But that's not the whole
story, since with Stanford teams in particular, the 10-point differen
tial seems to snowball.
SUCCESS WITHIN THE WOMB
It has long been a tendency of Stanford basketball teams to be j
phenomenally successful within the womb-like walls of Stanford
Pavilion, which has the smallest seating capacity of a major college j
gym on the Coast, and probably the worst soundproofing. It is also
an axiom that the Indians fall ill to myopia of the shooting eye when
on a road trip.
In the past four seasons, including the present one, Stanford has
compiled an amazing 37-6 won-loss record at home. At the same
time, the Cards have a sickly 22-24 away-from-hoine record, with
four of those victories over military dribbling wizards like the
Pearl Harbor Marines, which Stanford beat, 90-33.
Three years ago, Stanford won 17 straight at home before the
Oregon State traveling troupe, featuring Mel Counts and the four
little Beavers, ended the streak. The team currently has won eight
straight at home.
The only enemy gym where Stanford does relatively well is Cal's.
The Tribe has won four straight there, although they usually enjoy
loud support from a few local boosters.
That fact points to one home court advantage, the rooters. When
ever a sparkling play by a visiting team produces dead silence, while
every move of the local lads looses deafening cheers, there is bound
to be an effect on the players. Basketball players will tell you that
they don't hear the crowd when concentrating on a game. Thai may
be true for the visitors, but the home team definitely receives a lift
in spirits.
Moreover, the home team plays on a familiar court. The back
ground behind the baskets may confuse the visitors' shooting eyes. |
Also, the very floor surface can cause trouble. The University of
Washington pavilion is sinking into covered-over mud flats, which 1
means the groaning floor boards resemble the Pacific Ocean during ;
a monsoon. Frustrated guards may have a ball bounce nine differ
ent directions on a trip downcourt. By the time they complete that
ordeal, they probably have forgotten which play to call.
"HOMER" KEFS ALSO A FACTOR
A third factor is the referees. Although the Pacific Athletic Con- j
ference does better than most in obtaining competent officials, there
are inevitably some "homers" who always fail to see how the local!
team could lose- and call the game accordingly.
Impartiality is difficult even for the Ix'st ret's. For instance, either
Ernie Filiberti or Kill Bussenius are officials at most Stanford borne j
games. They are both fine referees, but they naturally bccome ac- i
customed to the moves of Stanford players. What a Northwest offi
cial may think is roughness when Kay Kosarike drives for a lay-up
or Clay Raaka fights for a rebound, another man who has seen these
moves time and again may take for granted.
This year Stanford has fouled about as many times as its oppo
nents. Yet in five of the seven away games, the referees have whistled j
more fouls on the Indians than on the opponents.
Finally, there are the psychological factors. A road trip can be
exhausting as well as depressing, if the players are stuck in a dull
town away from their girl friends, especially if they had to get up
early after a hard game, board a plane, find a hotel, practice, eat, and
play another game that afternoon. Oregon State ta good team),;
had to do that last month in order to play Washington State ta lousy
toam); so will Stanford. OSU lost.
All these factors added together still don't account for last week's }
31-point reversal of form. But they help explain that nice 37-6 record
in the Pavilion. With a winning gym like that, who needs a new one? i
One of basketball's most fascinating aspects, and one which Stan
ford coach Howie Dallmar probably did some hard thinking about I
over the weekend, is the phenomenon known as the home court ad
vantage.
Last Thursday the Indians hosted the Santa Barbara Gauchos, a
lower division team from a lower division league, the Western Ath
letic Conference. The crowd was in a festive mood, and was soon
rewarded with the humorous attempts of the Gauchos to play basket
ball. a game apparently recently introduced to them. After about 15
