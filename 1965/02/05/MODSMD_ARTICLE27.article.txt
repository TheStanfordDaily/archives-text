# A 						Matter Of Education

### 
Dean of Women Lucilo Allen lias issued a
statement denying that the Crow-1 lalverson re
port to LASSU accurately recounts her conversa
tion with Women's Council last spring.
The only other student witnesses to that con
versation still residing on the campus have issued
statements supporting the veracity of the Crow-
I lalverson account.
To put it mildly, someone is hedging.
A special committee of the academic Council
has taken on the job of evaluating the contradic
tory accounts and will report its recommenda
tions to President Sterling, one assumes, with
both care and expedition.
The questioning of motives and the cries of
"character assassination," however, add little to
the impartiality of the investigation.
Particularly offensive in this regard is Dean
of Students 11. Donald Winbigler's comment that
"The personal attack upon Dean Allen is both
regrettable and unwarranted."
It seems Dean Winbigler has missed the
point. The "charges," (that is, the reconstruction
of the conversation), are "unwarranted"' only if
the investigatory committee finds them to be un
true.
In any case, the allegations contained in the
report can in no way be construed as a "personal
attack.' The Crow-Halverson report merely re
counts the statements and suggestions of the

Dean while acting in her capacity as a university
administrator.
It is an old custom of democracy that public
officials be held publicaliy accountable lor their
actions.
Finally, if the Grow-Halverson account is
demonstrated to be accurate, it would be sad to
think that the Dean of Students could find this
disclosure of malfeasance "regretable."
Honesty should never be regretted.
A great deal of the burden for determining
what happens in this matter must rest with the
academic communityâ€”where it belonged in the
first place.
If, indeed, members of the administration
understand their prerogatives to extend into the
classroom, then part of the blame for this mis
understanding must go to the students and fac
ulty' for allow ing such a situation to exist.
Power always moves to fill a vacuum.
At Stanford, the vacuum has been created by
students and 1 acuity, and the administration has
apparently moved to fill it up.
Perhaps the most appalling revelation in this
affair is that two of the students present agreed
to go along with the Dean's proposal to infringe
upon academic freedom.
Somewhere, somehow, there has been a lapse
in education.
And that it unfortunate, because education is
what Stanford is supposed to be all about.
