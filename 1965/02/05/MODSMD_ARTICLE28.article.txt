# The 						Circumlocution Office
## 
### 
"The Circumlocution Office was (as every
body knows without being told) the most im
portant Department under Government. . . .
"II was . . . impossible to do the plainest
right and to undo the plainest wrong, without
the express authority of the Circumlocution
Office
"Whatever was required to be done, the Cir
cumlocution Office was beforehand with all pub
lie departments in the art of perceiving—llOW'
NOT TO DO IT.
"Through this delicate perception, through
the tact with which it invariably seized it, and
through the genius with which it always acted
upon it, the Circumlocution Office had risen to
over top all the public departments; and the
public condition had risen to be—what it was.
"Numbers of people were lost in the Circum

locution Office. Unfortunates with wrongs, or
with projects for the general welfare . . . who,
in the slow lapse of time and agony had passed
safely through other public departments; who
according to rule, had been bullied in this, over
reached by that, and evaded by the other; got
referred at last to the Circumlocution Office, and |
never reappeared in the light of day.
"Boards sat upon them, secretaries minuted
upon them, commissioners gabbled about them,j
clerks registered, entered, checked, and ticked
them off, and they melted away.
"In short, all the business of the country went
through the Circumlocution Office, except the
business that never came out of it; and Us name
was Legion."
