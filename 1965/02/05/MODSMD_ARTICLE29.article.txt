If t ho "Winds of Freedom
i Blow" at Stanford, where do
i they? When the dean of women
I takes it upon herself to decide!
what curriculum the Stanford
English Department should estab
lish, when she goes so far as to
have students report on "objec
tionable" material, where is aca
! demic freedom at Stanford Uni
! versity?
The Stanford Administration,
I especially the President, has an
I obligation to protect the integrity
and autonomy of its academic i
departments. At no time should!
I any Dean be able to interfere in
I any way with the academic com-1
j munity, even under the guise of!
a moral crusade .and remain un
i disciplined. The University of Cali- j
j fornia students protested the de-1
I nial of their political rights by !
| the university administration. The!
! students of this university are!
■ being denied a right much morel
j precious to them at this time: j
'the right of a liberal education,
the right of academic freedom.!
j When the Dean of Women can
act as a literary critic and pass i
I judgment on the curriculum of
the English department, Stanford
i University is not a "major univer- i
: sity." It's time that some action
was taken to protect our, the stu
dents', rights at such an instilu-
I Hon In the meantime it might lie

advisable to remove the propa- j
ganda slogans from PACE litera-!
ture and from the applications!
sent to prospective freshmen. The;
"Winds of Freedom" do not blow 1
here.

Wc write with regard to David
Mason's letter concerning the un
willingness of the Military, Air,
and Naval Science Departments' j
to admit civilian students to their i
courses. As Naval Science s t u-!
dents, we know first-hand that j
Mr. Mason is misinformed. The'
Naval Science Department allows j
interested Stanford students to!
audit or take for credit its courses |
-upon approval by the Com
manding Officer—with no obliga
tion. This privilege has been exer
cised by many Stanford students
in the past and is being exercised 1
by several now. (There are, at the ,
present time, two civilian stu-l
dents in our own class.)
If Mr. Mason is sincere in his;
interest, we are looking forward
to seeing him enrolled in one of
our classes.
