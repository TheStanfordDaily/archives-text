# Unmerited and Undeserved

"For it is his grace you are saved, through trusting him,- it is not youi
own doing. It is God s gift, not a reward work done. There is nothing for
anyone to boast." Eph. 2:8, 9.
One of the most important truths of the Bible, and the one that proud and
self-righteous men try constantly to deny, is that salvation is entirely the work
of God, unmerited and undeserved. Man can do nothing to earn favor with
God, nor live a life pleasing to God without being born-again and empowered
by the Holy Spirit. Man is saved by faith in Jesus Christ alone, and even
this saving faith is God-given.
' For we ourselves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving
diverse lusts and plasueres, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one
another. But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man
appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according
to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of
the Holy Ghost; which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
Saviour that being justified by grace, we should be made heirs according to
the hope of eternal life." Titus 3:3-7.
Keeping the commandments or doing good deeds apart from Jesus Christ
cannot and does not bring a person into a saving relationship with God.
"For all alike have sinned, and are deprived of the divine splendor, and all
are justified by God s free grace alone, through his act of liberation in the
person of Christ Jesus. For God designed him to be the means of expiating
sin by his sacrificial death, effective through faith. God meant by this to
demonstrate his justice, because in his forbearance he had overlooked the
sins of the past — to demonstrate his justice now in the present, showing
that he is both himself just and justifies any man who puts his faith in
Jesus." (Rom. 3: 23-28).
A free gift can not be earned, but must be accepted to be effective. God's
free gift of eternal life to all who trust in Christ is undeserved by sinful
man who is totally depraved in the sight of God.
"There is no just man, no one, no one who understands, no one who seeks
God. All have swerved aside, all alike have become debased there is no one
to show kindness; no not one. Their throat is an open grave, they use their
tongues for treachery, adder s venom is on their lips, cind their mouths is
full of bitter curses. Their feet hasten to shed blood, ruin misery lie
along their paths, they are strangers to the high-road of pease, and reverence
for God does not enter their thoughts. Now all the words of the law are
addressed, as we know, to those who are within the pale of the law, so
that no one may have anything 10 say in self-defense, but the whole world
may be exposed to the judgment of God. Rom. 3,1 1-19.
Each and every one of us has sinned, we are all gone astray, — "The
wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
our Lord." Rom. 6,23. If you have been trying to please God by good works,
or to live a moral life without is help on your own strength, won't you
turn your life over to esus today and be born-again? "Verily, verily, I say
unto thee, except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God."
John 3.3.
