### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
j Charge and countercharge ri
cocheted across the Stanford
I campus yesterday as the wheels
| of a major University began to
move to meet a major crisis.
Dean of Women Lucile Allen
yesterday issued a statement
| denying the veracity of allegations
I made against her in a report to
I LASSU by Nora (/row and Dar
j rell Halverson. former chairmen
i of Men's and Women's Councils.
The report alleged that Dean
Allen regarded the student judi
ciary merely as her administrative
tool and, further, had last spring
suggested that members of Wom
en's Council band together to re
port the content of English De
partment lectures to her office.
(This conversation was initially
reconstructed in an affidavit
signed in early Autumn by three
of those in attendance when Dean
Allen's alleged accusations were
made. A copy was presented to a
member of the English deparl
i ment).
HOWEVER, four student wit
nesses to the conversation in
j which Dean Allen allegedly sug
gested the violation of academic
t freedom issued statements e on
' firming the accuracy of the Crow
; Halverson account.
It was also learned yesterday
that the Executive Committee of
I the Academic Council, Stanford's
top faculty group, named a three
jm a n investigatory committee
j Tuesday to examine student
; charges of undue administrative
1 influence in the judicial proeess
j ing of disciplinary cases.
The committee, consisting of
| Profs. Kenneth Arrow, Sanford
Dornbusch, and Gerald Gunther,
was appointed by Prof. Benjamin
i Page, chairman of the Executive
j Committee, the day after the
Committee and President Wal
: lace Sterling received a written
report from Halverson and Miss
, Crow.
IN HER statement yesterday.
