## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
j Charge and countercharge ri
cocheted across the Stanford
I campus yesterday as the wheels
| of a major University began to
move to meet a major crisis.
Dean of Women Lucile Allen
yesterday issued a statement
| denying the veracity of allegations
I made against her in a report to
I LASSU by Nora (/row and Dar
j rell Halverson. former chairmen
i of Men's and Women's Councils.
The report alleged that Dean
Allen regarded the student judi
ciary merely as her administrative
tool and, further, had last spring
suggested that members of Wom
en's Council band together to re
port the content of English De
partment lectures to her office.
(This conversation was initially
reconstructed in an affidavit
signed in early Autumn by three
of those in attendance when Dean
Allen's alleged accusations were
made. A copy was presented to a
member of the English deparl
i ment).
HOWEVER, four student wit
nesses to the conversation in
j which Dean Allen allegedly sug
gested the violation of academic
t freedom issued statements e on
' firming the accuracy of the Crow
; Halverson account.
It was also learned yesterday
that the Executive Committee of
I the Academic Council, Stanford's
top faculty group, named a three
jm a n investigatory committee
j Tuesday to examine student
; charges of undue administrative
1 influence in the judicial proeess
j ing of disciplinary cases.
The committee, consisting of
| Profs. Kenneth Arrow, Sanford
Dornbusch, and Gerald Gunther,
was appointed by Prof. Benjamin
i Page, chairman of the Executive
j Committee, the day after the
Committee and President Wal
: lace Sterling received a written
report from Halverson and Miss
, Crow.
IN HER statement yesterday.
j Dean Allen said, "I strongly dis-
I agree with most of the allegations,
i especially those supposedly rep
resenting statements made by me
about the English Department.
"I believe the students have
tried to be honest in their attempt j
to reconstruct discussions which !
occurred more than nine months
ago, but I also believe their inter- j
pretations are inaccurate."
KATE BRANSTEN, present
Women's Council chairman, yes
terday verified the facts of the
Crow-Halverson report. "1 was a
witness to the discussion on the!
I English Department. . . . Every I
j word in the statement is an accu- ■
j rate reconstruction of the conver- j
: sat ion last spring. . .
Caroline Ward, former Council i
i member, agreed with Miss Bran-
I sten. "We believe the facts in Ihe
' article are true and verifiable,"
she said. "We would not have |
risked a libel suit if we did not be- j
lieve them so."
Vicki Ganz, a third participant
! in the purported discussion, said,
"I think that the report was le
grettably phrased; it emerges pri
marily as a personal attack on
Dean Allen. The matter in the re
port is, as far as I know, entirely
correct. I would be willing to
/testify to that."
TERRY MORAN, a fourth par
ticipant, said, "My recollection of
the incident is not as clear as
Nora Crow's, but nothing in it
conflicts vvith what I remember."
Thomas Moser, executive head
of the English Department, denied
the truth ol' Dean Allen's alleged
charges. "To my knowledge," he
said, "the allegations concerning
the freshman English course and
its staff . . . are totally without
foundation. I am of course not
passing judgment one way or
1 another on the report itself."
Dean of Students H. Donald
! Winbigler said, "The personal at
i tack upon Dean Allen is bolh re
! grettable and unwarranted. The
j published report includes infer
ences which are without i'oun
; dation and are unfair to the fac

ulty of tho English Department,
to individual students, 1o this of
fice, and particularity to Dean
Alien.
"AS TO the issue of judicial
procedures for handling student
disciplinary cases, this is a matter
tor fair comment and has been
under study by a presidential com
mittee of students and faculty
since early this fall."
Asst. Prof. Robert Pol hem us
of the English Department was
wholly at a loss to explain the al
legations. "As a 'young English
professor', I find Dean Allen's
charges not only slanderous, but
comical," he told The Daily. "The
charges are so fantastic that I
assume that no one at Stanford
would give them credence."
W. B. Carnochan, another mem
ber of the English faculty, and
Polhemus both thought that "the
truth of the statements contained
in the report is matter for investi
gation."
"BUT TO describe the report as
a 'personal attack'—-as has been
said—is to prejudice the case"
Carnochan continued. "The tone
of the report is judicious; the is
sues involved are far more than
personal."

TERRY MORAN, a fourth par
ticipant, said, "My recollection of
the incident is not as clear as
Nora Crow's, but nothing in it
conflicts vvith what I remember."
Thomas Moser, executive head
of the English Department, denied
the truth ol' Dean Allen's alleged
charges. "To my knowledge," he
said, "the allegations concerning
the freshman English course and
its staff . . . are totally without
foundation. I am of course not
passing judgment one way or
1 another on the report itself."
Dean of Students H. Donald
! Winbigler said, "The personal at
i tack upon Dean Allen is bolh re
! grettable and unwarranted. The
j published report includes infer
ences which are without i'oun
; dation and are unfair to the fac

ulty of tho English Department,
to individual students, 1o this of
fice, and particularity to Dean
Alien.
"AS TO the issue of judicial
procedures for handling student
disciplinary cases, this is a matter
tor fair comment and has been
under study by a presidential com
mittee of students and faculty
since early this fall."
Asst. Prof. Robert Pol hem us
of the English Department was
wholly at a loss to explain the al
legations. "As a 'young English
professor', I find Dean Allen's
charges not only slanderous, but
comical," he told The Daily. "The
charges are so fantastic that I
assume that no one at Stanford
would give them credence."
W. B. Carnochan, another mem
ber of the English faculty, and
Polhemus both thought that "the
truth of the statements contained
in the report is matter for investi
gation."
"BUT TO describe the report as
a 'personal attack'—-as has been
said—is to prejudice the case"
Carnochan continued. "The tone
of the report is judicious; the is
sues involved are far more than
personal."
j Charge and countercharge ri
cocheted across the Stanford
I campus yesterday as the wheels
| of a major University began to
move to meet a major crisis.
Dean of Women Lucile Allen
yesterday issued a statement
| denying the veracity of allegations
I made against her in a report to
I LASSU by Nora (/row and Dar
j rell Halverson. former chairmen
i of Men's and Women's Councils.
The report alleged that Dean
Allen regarded the student judi
ciary merely as her administrative
tool and, further, had last spring
suggested that members of Wom
en's Council band together to re
port the content of English De
partment lectures to her office.
(This conversation was initially
reconstructed in an affidavit
signed in early Autumn by three
of those in attendance when Dean
Allen's alleged accusations were
made. A copy was presented to a
member of the English deparl
i ment).
HOWEVER, four student wit
nesses to the conversation in
j which Dean Allen allegedly sug
gested the violation of academic
t freedom issued statements e on
' firming the accuracy of the Crow
; Halverson account.
It was also learned yesterday
that the Executive Committee of
I the Academic Council, Stanford's
top faculty group, named a three
jm a n investigatory committee
j Tuesday to examine student
; charges of undue administrative
1 influence in the judicial proeess
j ing of disciplinary cases.
The committee, consisting of
| Profs. Kenneth Arrow, Sanford
Dornbusch, and Gerald Gunther,
was appointed by Prof. Benjamin
i Page, chairman of the Executive
j Committee, the day after the
Committee and President Wal
: lace Sterling received a written
report from Halverson and Miss
, Crow.
IN HER statement yesterday.
j Dean Allen said, "I strongly dis-
I agree with most of the allegations,
i especially those supposedly rep
resenting statements made by me
about the English Department.
"I believe the students have
tried to be honest in their attempt j
to reconstruct discussions which !
occurred more than nine months
ago, but I also believe their inter- j
pretations are inaccurate."
KATE BRANSTEN, present
Women's Council chairman, yes
terday verified the facts of the
Crow-Halverson report. "1 was a
witness to the discussion on the!
I English Department. . . . Every I
j word in the statement is an accu- ■
j rate reconstruction of the conver- j
: sat ion last spring. . .
Caroline Ward, former Council i
i member, agreed with Miss Bran-
I sten. "We believe the facts in Ihe
' article are true and verifiable,"
she said. "We would not have |
risked a libel suit if we did not be- j
lieve them so."
Vicki Ganz, a third participant
! in the purported discussion, said,
"I think that the report was le
grettably phrased; it emerges pri
marily as a personal attack on
Dean Allen. The matter in the re
port is, as far as I know, entirely
correct. I would be willing to
