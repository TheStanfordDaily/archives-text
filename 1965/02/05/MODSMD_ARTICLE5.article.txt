Peter Gaffney, West ("oast
representative for America ris
for Community Cooperation
in Other Nations (ACCION),
will be on the Stanford cam

day to interview applicants
for the program.
ACCION is an organization
formed to help fight disease,
crime, and hopelessness in the
Latin American "barrios,"
city slum areas, inhabited
chiefly by unemployed rural
workers.
The volunteer group was
started four years ago to in
ject hope into the barrios sit
uation, when a group of thir
ty ACCION recruits, includ
ing Stanford students Stan
>lorris, Marilyn Moyle, and
Talton Ray, were sent to La
tin America.
Initiated by Joseph 11.
Blatchford, a law graduate of
the University of California
at Berkeley, ACCION now
operates in 25 slum areas in
Venezuela.
Although limited so far
only to Venezuela, new proj
ects are being planned in Ar
gentina and Brazil.

A( ( lON projects work
through cooperation between
the volunteers and tin- barrios
residents. Volunteers first at
tempt to win confidence of
the slum dwellers by organ
izing' games, then building
recreation areas, and finally
organizing groups to clean up
the barrio.
Through these projects the
volunteers hope to get th e
whole community working to
pave streets, dig sewers, build
schools and plan other self
help programs.
Both men and women at
least 20 years old can volun
teer and should he able to
speak Spanish. After four
months of intensive training
in the host country, they start
to work in the barrios.
ACTION provides all travel
expenses and room and board.
Unlike the Peace Corps, vol
unteers are not bound for a
specific number of years.
After a barrio has become
relatively self-sufficient, AC
(JON withdraws, of 112 e r i 11 g
only advisory services. It has
evolved from a KM! per cent
American group in 1960 to a
force of 120 volunteers, 65 per
cent from Latin America.
