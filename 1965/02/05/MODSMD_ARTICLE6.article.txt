posed the creation of an "inde-4
pendent and neutral Eastern Eu
ropean Bloc" to resolve the prob
lems separating the two nations.!
"If the problems between the'
Soviet Union and the U.S. remain
unsolved," he stated, "the danger
ous elements of international
politics will grow." The major j

Dr. Ferene Nagy, former Prime Minister of Hungary, empha
sized the pressing need to eliminate issues dividing the Soviet
Union and the United States due to the threat of lied China dur
ing a speech yesterday.
Nagy, a guest of the Institute of International Relations, pro-

threat, according to Nagy, wasj
the occurrence of "the greatest, i
most terrible war between colored ;
and white peoples," which Red;
China is attempting lo incite.
HK BELIEVES thai Red China
is increasing its military strength
and introducing racial issues into
the Sino-Soviet Conflict in order
to back up its demand for m ore
land.
Nagy pointed out that if an in-1
dependent and neutral bloc was
made of Eastern Europe, this
would promote cooperation be
tween Russia and the U.S. and
halt the advancing danger ol
China.
"POLITICALLY it would also
be advantageous," Nagy said, "be- J
cause Eastern Europe would de
velop new attitudes toward the
Soviet Union and regard them as
friends rather than oppressors."
Be side s political advantages,
this change would have economic
advantages for both Eastern Eu
rope and the Soviet Union. It
would h c 1 p overcome economic I
backwardness by throwing the!
countries into "the mainstream of
world trade."
Because Russia is in a procari-1
ous position fighting a war on j
two fronts. China and Eastern
Europe, it is in no position to
make any significant policy
changcs, he believes.
"Until .Russia changes its pol-!
icy toward Eastern Europe and a
neutral bloc can be worked out." ;
Nagy stated, "the United States
should continue its present policy
of strengthening the people and
luiildine up their aspirations,"
