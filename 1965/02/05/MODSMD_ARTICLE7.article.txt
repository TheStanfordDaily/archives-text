# Students Voice Differing Opinions On Controversial judicial Statement
## 
### DOUG OHMANS 
At least two major questions have been
raised by the LASSU Student Judiciary-
Administration Relations report. The first,
concerning the bread area of aeademie free
dom, is: Who should control and who should
influence what is taught in individual
classes? Or more specifically, was Dean
Allen within her bounds in attempting to
influence the content of Freshman English
courses?
The second question is a more familiar
one at Stanford .Should the University at
tempt to act "in loco parentis?" If so, who
constitutes the "University?" Who should
be the final authority in questions involving
social regulation?
IN" A SAMPLING of student opinion in
Tresidder yesterday, there was a remark
able diversity of beliefs.
Those who had strong opinions on the
issue of academic freedom were generally
of two groups. Several thought that faculty
members should be absolutely free of all
outside control. Craig Williamson, a senior
in English, said '*11»«* Administ rai ion should

have no power whatsoever over the curri
culum or how it is taught."
Some said thai faculty should be con
trolled within autonomous or semi-autono
mous department. Paul Miles ,a senior in
Biology, argued: "The Department should
have the major may in regulating academic
freedom. . . . The Administration should set
broad but specific limits on the Depart
ments. according to the University's basic
educational goals."
A second group thought the Administra
tion does and should run the University and
control its curriculum. Hill Chandler, a
senior in International Relations, argued
that "the Administration must have the
final authority to remove a professor."
"That's just the reality of the situation."
said .John Erickson, a junior in Electrical
Engineering.
MANY OF THE students who had read
the text of the LASSU statement expressed
incredulity that the examples of "in loco
parentis" could be true. Some s;iid that the\
would reserve judgment until the alleged
lads Wore sllbslatilialed, ami a rebuttal

made.
According to Miss Clark, "Stanford social
regulations are bad in that they do not help
one to develop ethical and moral norms....
For this reason, Stanford administrators
have been mad 'parents.' "
One freshman from Wilbur, who pre
ferred that his name remain anonymous,
said that his English teacher did empha
size sex "pretty strongly" in his classes, but
complained that it hadn't helped his social
position any.
Another expressed a desire to switch to
a "sexier" section next quarter, and won
dered if perhaps the "S" in English 2-S
stood for something other than "Special."
The question of who holds ultimate au
thority in cases which are disputed is cru
cial. "Students should be allowed to make
appeals to a faculty committee that is inde
pendent of the Administration," said Wil
liamson.
Amid disagreement, there was unanimity
on at least one point. As Williamson put it.
"If lite charges arc true, something ought
In lie d< me aln ml I held!"
