# LASSU Demands Control Over Judicial Process
## Amendment Rejected By 60-62 Vote 
### STEVE LEOPOLD AMD MARY KAY BECKER 
LASSU, sitting in a packed em
ergency session last night to con
sider the recently issued judicial
report, passed a resolution as
serting "that the ASSU shall have
sole jurisdiction over student af
fairs and conduct."
Prior to passing the resolution,
sponsored by Jay Kadane, the?
legislature narrowly defeated by
a roll-call vote ol 60-62 an amend
ment proposing to strike the
above-quoted sect ion.
The roll-call process look over
20 minutes to complete, with
several members challenging the
voting rights of substitutes. The
chair ruled that any substitute
with a letter from the regular
member could vote.
A spirited debate, punctuated
by repeated applause from both
factions, proceeded this vote.
Those in favor of striking the
controversial sentence argued
that it was too big a problem to
be buried in another resolution
and should be considered sep
arately.
The opponents felt, in the words
of English T.A. Bob Hass, that
"this should be no apology to the
University for questioning abu
ses of rights they have given us.
Rather, we must assert our rights
here, in this resolution."
Still later the Legislature voted
down an amendment that would
have struck the word "sole" in
the phrase asserting the ASSU's
right to "sole jurisdiction over
student affairs and conduct."
The final resolution also pro
vided for an emergency commit
tee of nine members, to be appoin
ted by the Speaker, "to hear all
the evidence, determine all the
facts, discuss 1 lie implications of
the report on Student-Adminisl ra
tion relations, and recommend any
necessary action."
The Legislature also commen
ded ihe University Executive
Committee of the Academic Coun
cil and the President of the Uni
versity "for their swift action
during the past week."
