Christianity's God:
A Mythological Construction?
It is almost possible to seize on certain elements of common speech and
carry them to absurd extremes. Unconsciously many people do this when they
think or speak about God.
The God of Christianity is pictured as an oriental Monarch, seated on the '
throne of His Kingdom in a land beyond the skies, ruling the world from afar
on the basis of an inexorable and inscrutable code of laws. To save the world
from sin, the Son of this Monarch made a space journey from the Kingdom
beyond the skies down to this little planet, where he traveled incognito,
masquerading as a man. After his death, his revived corpse returned via
another space journey to its celestial home.
If this is what a man has in mind when he calls himself an atheist—if
this is the "God" in whom he does not believe—he may be closer to the
truth than Christians commonly give him credit for. Certainly this is not the God
of the Bible, not the Father of Jesus Christ.
Now it is virtually impossible to speak about God for long without speaking
anthropomorphically, i.e., without sepaking as if God were a man. It is
important that the practical necessity of such language be remembered if the
concept of God is to be conveyed in human language and common categories,
but it is particularly important not to confuse anthropomorphism for the
reality of God Himself.
What does it really mean to be an atheist? If there is anything in a man's
life to which commits himself unconditionally, for which he has ultimate concern,
and with which he will contenance no trifling, then this is his "God." If a
man believes that there is purpose and meaning in life, then he believes in
"god."
The only man who can really claim to deserve the title of atheist is one
who denies that there is any meaning to life, who denies that life has purpose,
who does not commit himself to anything in an ultimate act of concern. Such a
man is truly to be pitied. But to many who claim the title of atheist, the
object of their atheism is the caricatured "god of Christianity.
Because a man has a god, of course, does not mean that he accepts
the God of Christianity. But it should at least dispose him to consider the
relationship between the source of his concern and the Lord God and Father of j
Jesus Christ, as described in the Bible. St. Paul told the Athenians in Acts j
17:23 that the "Unknown God" they worshipped was none other than the \
Father of the Lord Jseus Christ. (Christ said "I and the Father are one" Matt.
10:30). Purpose, meaning and depth in life are realities only because God is.
An invitation awaits each man to come to know Him through and in the
person of Jesus Christ. Think about it.

What does it really mean to be an atheist? If there is anything in a man's
life to which commits himself unconditionally, for which he has ultimate concern,
and with which he will contenance no trifling, then this is his "God." If a
man believes that there is purpose and meaning in life, then he believes in
"god."
The only man who can really claim to deserve the title of atheist is one
who denies that there is any meaning to life, who denies that life has purpose,
who does not commit himself to anything in an ultimate act of concern. Such a
man is truly to be pitied. But to many who claim the title of atheist, the
object of their atheism is the caricatured "god of Christianity.
Because a man has a god, of course, does not mean that he accepts
the God of Christianity. But it should at least dispose him to consider the
relationship between the source of his concern and the Lord God and Father of j
Jesus Christ, as described in the Bible. St. Paul told the Athenians in Acts j
17:23 that the "Unknown God" they worshipped was none other than the \
Father of the Lord Jseus Christ. (Christ said "I and the Father are one" Matt.
10:30). Purpose, meaning and depth in life are realities only because God is.
An invitation awaits each man to come to know Him through and in the
person of Jesus Christ. Think about it.

Christianity's God:
A Mythological Construction?
It is almost possible to seize on certain elements of common speech and
carry them to absurd extremes. Unconsciously many people do this when they
think or speak about God.
The God of Christianity is pictured as an oriental Monarch, seated on the '
throne of His Kingdom in a land beyond the skies, ruling the world from afar
on the basis of an inexorable and inscrutable code of laws. To save the world
from sin, the Son of this Monarch made a space journey from the Kingdom
beyond the skies down to this little planet, where he traveled incognito,
masquerading as a man. After his death, his revived corpse returned via
another space journey to its celestial home.
If this is what a man has in mind when he calls himself an atheist—if
this is the "God" in whom he does not believe—he may be closer to the
truth than Christians commonly give him credit for. Certainly this is not the God
of the Bible, not the Father of Jesus Christ.
Now it is virtually impossible to speak about God for long without speaking
anthropomorphically, i.e., without sepaking as if God were a man. It is
important that the practical necessity of such language be remembered if the
concept of God is to be conveyed in human language and common categories,
but it is particularly important not to confuse anthropomorphism for the
reality of God Himself.
