It has become difficult lately to read a magazine or
watch Sunday afternoon television without hearing
about something called "the leisure problem." For
those of you who were working on a paper until dawn
and require a definition of this phrase, it is used most
often by those who are concerned because, 1), people
have too much free time these days and, 2), they use
it very badly.
ft is this modern myth that Sebastian do Grazia de
molishes in Of Time. Work, and Leisure (Anchor,
$1.05). Professor de Grazia takes as his thesis the
distinction between "work time." "free time," and
"leisure," the last of which he defines as "the state
of being in which activity is pursued for its own sake
I or its own end." The New Yorker writes: "His book
is actually a plea for withdrawal, untidiness. Cock
aigne, the leisurely life in the good society, and a
warning against such entrenched foes as advertising,
time-mindedness, the Protestant work ethic, and
tyranny."
If you look hard enough, you might find these same
four adversaries under attack in Don Marquis's classic,
archy and mehitabel (Dolphin. 05c). Don Marquis
first introduced archy, the poetic cockroach, and
mehitabel, the worldly-wise alley cat, in his newspaper
column in 101G, and if you haven't yet met them, you
are in for a treat. The songs and meditations of archy,
composed late at night on the boss's typewriter, are as
pointed and to-the-point today as they were back in
the 19205, when quoting Don Marquis was a national
pastime. Why the lower case title? archy, philosoph
ically inclined as he is, isn't strong enough to make
capital letters:
the main question is
whether the stuff is
literature or not.
It is. Get an extra copy to give away this week. What
better valentine than a lovable cockroach?
As far as we know, Robert Warshow never wrote
about archy or mehitabel. Before his death at the age
I of 37 in 1055, however, he had established an enduring
reputation as a superb critic and commentator on
many other aspects of popular culture. Many rank
him with the late James Agee as a film critic; once
you've read his famous study of the Western movie in
The Immediate Experience (Anchor, $1,251, you'll
never again see John Wayne in quite the same light.
Above all, Warshow was a brilliant prose stylist.
Lionel Trilling places him "in the line of ITazlitt. a
tradition in which I would place only one other writer
of our time, George Orwell, with whose feeling for
language Warshow had much in common." I»uy or

is actually a plea for withdrawal, untidiness. Cock
aigne, the leisurely life in the good society, and a
warning against such entrenched foes as advertising,
time-mindedness, the Protestant work ethic, and
tyranny."
If you look hard enough, you might find these same
four adversaries under attack in Don Marquis's classic,
archy and mehitabel (Dolphin. 05c). Don Marquis
first introduced archy, the poetic cockroach, and
mehitabel, the worldly-wise alley cat, in his newspaper
column in 101G, and if you haven't yet met them, you
are in for a treat. The songs and meditations of archy,
composed late at night on the boss's typewriter, are as
pointed and to-the-point today as they were back in
the 19205, when quoting Don Marquis was a national
pastime. Why the lower case title? archy, philosoph
ically inclined as he is, isn't strong enough to make
capital letters:
the main question is
whether the stuff is
literature or not.

better valentine than a lovable cockroach?
As far as we know, Robert Warshow never wrote
about archy or mehitabel. Before his death at the age
I of 37 in 1055, however, he had established an enduring
reputation as a superb critic and commentator on
many other aspects of popular culture. Many rank
him with the late James Agee as a film critic; once
you've read his famous study of the Western movie in
The Immediate Experience (Anchor, $1,251, you'll
never again see John Wayne in quite the same light.
Above all, Warshow was a brilliant prose stylist.

It has become difficult lately to read a magazine or
watch Sunday afternoon television without hearing
about something called "the leisure problem." For
those of you who were working on a paper until dawn
and require a definition of this phrase, it is used most
often by those who are concerned because, 1), people
have too much free time these days and, 2), they use
it very badly.
ft is this modern myth that Sebastian do Grazia de
molishes in Of Time. Work, and Leisure (Anchor,
$1.05). Professor de Grazia takes as his thesis the
distinction between "work time." "free time," and
"leisure," the last of which he defines as "the state
of being in which activity is pursued for its own sake
I or its own end." The New Yorker writes: "His book
