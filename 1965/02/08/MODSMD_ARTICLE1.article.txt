that has been mine since yestrday, would make death itself seem
sweet."

complied with an integration order issued last summer. After that
ruling Maddox announced that he would integrate the Lester Mad

There was no effort made by Negroes on Saturday to obtain
service at the restaurant. But yesterday a lone Negro appeared and
sought service. Maddox met him at the door and told him the restau
rant was closed.
