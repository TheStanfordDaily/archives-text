Now that the dust has settled and the San
Francisco Chronicle has assured the world that
"Stanford's Not So Wild," perhaps the university
community can return to the serious, if not
solemn, business of examining an exceedingly
complex family problem.
The most encouraging response to the issues
raised in the Crow-J lalverson report has come
from the faculty.
A three-man fact-finding committee of the
Academic Council has spent most of the week
end hearing testimony from those who partici
pated in the discussion with the Dean last spring.
If the committee investigation proceeds at its
present rate, it would not seem unreasonable to
expect some disclosure of findings before the
week is out.
Perhaps even more encouraging has been the
informal response from individual faculty mem
bers. The concern they have expressed, particu
larly on the issue of academic freedom, leads one
to hope that, at the very least, the investigatory
committee's findings will be presented to the en
tire Academic Council and be subject to an open
and free discussion in that body.
In the past, the faculty has been quick to take
a stand when injustice to persons or principles
has been forcibly brought to its attention.
The dilemma, however, is that the assertion
of faculty concern, and of faculty power, has al
ways been sporatic and crisis-oriented. The fac
ulty rarely acts to prevent injustice before it
occurs because, quite simply, this would necessi
tate a concerted drive for comprehensive reform.
Time is peculiarly precious to a university
faculty member.

And the task of reforming a massive and com
plex bureaucratic system is time-consuming in
deed.
So, more often than not, the faculty is con
tent to "settle" for a situation that is something
less than ideal, to accept the growth of adminis
rative power and prerogative as perhaps unfor
tunate, but certainly inevitable, and to turn with
full energy to seemingly more immediate aca
demic business.
In an ideal system, the administration exists
solely to serve the students and faculty. But it is
only through the continued assertion of faculty
concern that this ideal can be transformed into
reality.
The faculty has the power to make the imi
versity what it will.
That power must be used, for ultimately the
greatness of a university is commensurate with
the greatness of its faculty.

to hope that, at the very least, the investigatory
committee's findings will be presented to the en
tire Academic Council and be subject to an open
and free discussion in that body.
In the past, the faculty has been quick to take
a stand when injustice to persons or principles
has been forcibly brought to its attention.
The dilemma, however, is that the assertion
of faculty concern, and of faculty power, has al
ways been sporatic and crisis-oriented. The fac
ulty rarely acts to prevent injustice before it
occurs because, quite simply, this would necessi
tate a concerted drive for comprehensive reform.
Time is peculiarly precious to a university
faculty member.

And the task of reforming a massive and com
plex bureaucratic system is time-consuming in
deed.
So, more often than not, the faculty is con
tent to "settle" for a situation that is something
less than ideal, to accept the growth of adminis
rative power and prerogative as perhaps unfor
tunate, but certainly inevitable, and to turn with
full energy to seemingly more immediate aca
demic business.
In an ideal system, the administration exists
solely to serve the students and faculty. But it is
only through the continued assertion of faculty
concern that this ideal can be transformed into
reality.
The faculty has the power to make the imi
versity what it will.
That power must be used, for ultimately the
greatness of a university is commensurate with
the greatness of its faculty.
