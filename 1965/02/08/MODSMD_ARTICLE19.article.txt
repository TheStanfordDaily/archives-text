"To make our institution all that I want it to
be, it must turn out students who shall be able
to influence and direct thought in the way of
elevating the masses. It seems to me that the
great question for statesmen and humanity is
how shall the great body of the people be" lifted
up, made intelligent, able to avail itself of all the
advantages of its labor."
