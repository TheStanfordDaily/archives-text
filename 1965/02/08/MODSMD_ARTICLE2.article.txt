# Kosanke Engineers Two Weekend Wins
## 
### PETE KING 
Sparked by Ray Kosanke's finest performance of the season,
Stanford eked out two basketball thrillers up north last weekend,
edging Oregon in the final three seconds, 77-75, then surviving
Oregon State's slow-down tactics to win 51-4 S.
The two victories gave Stanford undisputed second place in the*

Pacific Athletic Conference with
a 4-2 record. UCLA leads at 6-0.
A 10-foot shot by guard Gary
Loveridge in the last three sec
onds beat Oregon. Seconds earlier,
Oregon's Jerry Anderson had tied
the game at 75-all with a free
(throw, then missed a second
free toss.
But the story of the game was
Kosanke's phenomenal second
half performance. During one
nine-minute stretch, he sank eight
shots in a row, mostly 10-footers
over the guard of 6'10" Gene
Brockmeyer. During this time, no
other Indians were hitting their
shots, while Oregon's Bill Jen
nings and Nick Jones were me
thodically popping in 15- and 20-
foot ers.
KOSANKE GOT 23 points in
the second half, and 29 for the
game, his personal high. He sank
14 of 19 from the floor. Bob Be
dell added 19 points and Kent
Hinckley scored 12.
The Ducks zipped off to an
early lead, and their 62 per cent
shooting would have blown Stan
ford of the court but tor some
hot shooting by Clayton Raaka
and Hinckley. The two combined
for 13 points to cut a nine-point
Oregon lead to two at half time.
Bedell scored five quick points
to open the second half, and it
was nip-and tuck the rest of the
way. Kosanke scored on a pass

under the basket to make it 75-72
with 1:20 left to play, and the
Tribe hung on until Loveridge's
winning shot.
The next night the lead switched
back and forth with neither Ore
gon State or Stanford able to post
more than a three-point advan
tage. Hinckley's long shots kept
the Cards in the game until mid
way in the second half, when two
close shots by Kosanke and a lay
up and dunk by Bedell moved
Stanford out fo a 44-35 lead with
seven minutes to play.
JUST TIIKEE minutes later it
was 44-43, as OSU's Jim Jarvis
began hitting his patented 30-foot
ers, But then a free throw by
Hinckley, two by Kosange, and a
Bedell lay-up gave Stanford an
unreachable 49-43 lead.
Hinckley scored 17 points, while
Kosanke and Bedell added 12 each.
Jarvis had 21, but he was the only
OSU man in double figures, as
Stanford's switching man-to-man
defense forced the Beavers to
take many outside shots.
