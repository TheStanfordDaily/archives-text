# From The Establishment
## Weight Of GCC Bloc Proves Crucial In Amendment's Defeat 
### Steve Leopold 
What has happened to LASSU?
To put it precisely, the Gradu
ate Coordinating Committee.
Last Thursday, in the first
meeting of the Legislature since
a special election filled 52 vacant
graduate seats, the GCC won its
first test of power—albeit quite
narrowly—as LASSU voted to
"assert that the ASSU shall have
sole judisdiction over student af
fairs and conduct."
The GCC victory was the result
of several factors, the most im
portant of which was their own
monolithic unity on the key vote
to strike the above-quoted section
from an otherwise innocuous reso
lution. The amendment to strike
was defeated 60-62.
In that vote, the most obvious
bloc was the representatives of
the Graduate School of Humani
ties and Sciences. With 19 of their
21 representatives present and
voting, the vote to strike went
down 0-19. This contributed to a
20-29 repudiation of the striking
motion by the graduates, a major
ity that the undergraduates
with a 40-38 tally could not quite
undo.
The only other discernable
trend was a male-female split
among the undergraduates.
Stern was unanimous for strik
ing; Wilbur nearly so. The eating
clubs and the frats were 2-1 for.
Only the all-male off-campus vote
went with the GCC, 3-7.
On the distaff side, Uoble,
Branner, Flo Mo and the Row
were split, but all of Lagunita's
representatives were opposed.
Graduates Lead Parade
However, the GCC provided
nearly all the offense. From this
group came the sponsor of the
resolution — Jay Kadane. From
this group also came the principle
defenders of the controversial
section — Bob Hass and Gary
Feldman. And it was this group,
with their supporters in the
visitor's section, that initiated
something new in Legislature's
procedings — partisan applause
after nearly every speech by Mr.
Kadane and his friends.
Another way in which th e
GCC helped itself was in its
method of presenting the issue.
The "sole jurisdiction" section
was literally buried in the fourth
and last "resolved" clause of an
otherwise conciliatory resolution.

This strategy, coupled with the
very audacity of such a sugges
tion, caught some of the LASSU
leaders by surprise. Speaker Ed
Shaw, when questioned about the
Trustees' reaction to such a
declaration, was at a loss for
words. He maintained a strict neu
trality throughout the proceed
ings.
Meßride Aide Unprepared
Caught even more off guard
was Pat Forster, Scott Mcßride's
administrative assistant. Since
Meßride was in Washington pray-1
ing, Forster rose to speak in fa
vor of the resolution before he
left town also.
He obviously had not read past
the opening apologetic para
graphs, for in his supporting
speech he praised:
• The "wait and see attitude"
evidenced by the resolution. "The
bureaucracy has moved ex
tremely fast, which is better than
the 'trial by newspaper' which is
going on now."
• This refusal to take any fur
ther action which would both
"hinder the progress made by
Dean Winbigler's judicial com
mittee" and "would only prove
a certain degree of irresponsibil
ity among the students."
• The recognition that "we can
not go so far as to determine the
hiring and firing of administra
tors."
At that point, one of the repre
sentatives brought his attention
to tho "sole jurisdiction" section.
Forster said that the "ASSU has
had tremendous increase in au
thority over the last few years,
and this tendency will increase."
When further questioned about
how he could philosophically
justify such a declaration, he told
the questioner he would talk to
him later, since he now had to go
to the airport.
The Move To Strike
Overwhelmed by the enormity j
of the proposition and the con
fusing alliance of Forster and!
the GCC, those who opposed the i
resolution or who just had not i
considered it thoroughly moved
to strike it for later considera- ,
lion as a separate resolution, com- |
plete with explanatory whereases.
Immediately, the graduates
went on the offensive:
"Is this how to itiii a Univer i

, sity," computer science grad
i Feldman asked, "with thought
police, spy systems, girls taking
; notes on their TA's and then run
| ning giggling to the Dean? We
j must - stand up now and speak
! Ollt."
J Bob Hass, aTA in the English
Department, began by assuring
all the girls present that he'd
meet them "out in the hall after
the vote." Yet later, in a soft
spoken contrast to Feldman's
style, he declared "this resolution
is no apology for questioning
abuses of rights given us by the
Trustees."
The debate moved on for an
other half hour, then the vote
was taken.
GC'C Challenges Substitutes
A hand vote showed the strik
ing amendment going down 58-59,
so a roll call vote was requested.
One of the more suspicious types
on the GCC moved that substi
tutes be challenged to produce
I their notes before voting. Shaw
ruled him out of order, said he
didn't want to waste so much
time by checking every sub's
note.
The motion to strike went down
60-62.
The opponents then moved to
strike the word "sole" from "sole
i jurisdiction." This was voted
down by a slightly more substan
tial margin in the face of one of
the more trenchant puns heard in
the Legislature — "What if a stu
dent murders someone? Do we
still have sole jurisdiction?"
After another half-hour of what
Shaw called "quibbling," some
one finally called for a final
vote on the whole resolution. An
over w rough t representative
jumped to his feet and literally
screamed for adjournment so he
could consult his constituency.
He was overruled under protest.
Finally, after two and a half
hours of debate, the resolution
j was passed by hand vote.
"Some of these guys could give
I lessons to the Southern filibust
ered," a reporter from the
Examiner declared in disgust
after missing his deadline.
Undoubtedly, they will do so
again this week, as LASStT again
turns to debating important and
complex issues in a manner often
reminiscent of the balcony crowd
l at (he Sunday night Hicks.

i jurisdiction." This was voted
down by a slightly more substan
tial margin in the face of one of
the more trenchant puns heard in
the Legislature — "What if a stu
dent murders someone? Do we
still have sole jurisdiction?"
After another half-hour of what
Shaw called "quibbling," some
one finally called for a final
vote on the whole resolution. An
over w rough t representative
jumped to his feet and literally
screamed for adjournment so he
could consult his constituency.
He was overruled under protest.
Finally, after two and a half
hours of debate, the resolution
j was passed by hand vote.
"Some of these guys could give
I lessons to the Southern filibust
ered," a reporter from the
Examiner declared in disgust
after missing his deadline.
Undoubtedly, they will do so
again this week, as LASStT again
turns to debating important and
complex issues in a manner often
reminiscent of the balcony crowd

What has happened to LASSU?
To put it precisely, the Gradu
ate Coordinating Committee.
Last Thursday, in the first
meeting of the Legislature since
a special election filled 52 vacant
graduate seats, the GCC won its
first test of power—albeit quite
narrowly—as LASSU voted to
"assert that the ASSU shall have
sole judisdiction over student af
fairs and conduct."
The GCC victory was the result
of several factors, the most im
portant of which was their own
monolithic unity on the key vote
to strike the above-quoted section
from an otherwise innocuous reso
lution. The amendment to strike
was defeated 60-62.
In that vote, the most obvious
bloc was the representatives of
the Graduate School of Humani
ties and Sciences. With 19 of their
21 representatives present and
voting, the vote to strike went
down 0-19. This contributed to a
20-29 repudiation of the striking
motion by the graduates, a major
ity that the undergraduates
with a 40-38 tally could not quite
undo.
The only other discernable
trend was a male-female split
among the undergraduates.
Stern was unanimous for strik
ing; Wilbur nearly so. The eating
clubs and the frats were 2-1 for.
Only the all-male off-campus vote
went with the GCC, 3-7.
On the distaff side, Uoble,
Branner, Flo Mo and the Row
were split, but all of Lagunita's
representatives were opposed.
Graduates Lead Parade
However, the GCC provided
nearly all the offense. From this
group came the sponsor of the
resolution — Jay Kadane. From
this group also came the principle
defenders of the controversial
section — Bob Hass and Gary
Feldman. And it was this group,
with their supporters in the
visitor's section, that initiated
something new in Legislature's
procedings — partisan applause
after nearly every speech by Mr.
Kadane and his friends.
Another way in which th e
GCC helped itself was in its
method of presenting the issue.
The "sole jurisdiction" section
was literally buried in the fourth
and last "resolved" clause of an
otherwise conciliatory resolution.

This strategy, coupled with the
very audacity of such a sugges
tion, caught some of the LASSU
leaders by surprise. Speaker Ed
Shaw, when questioned about the
Trustees' reaction to such a
declaration, was at a loss for
words. He maintained a strict neu
trality throughout the proceed
ings.
Meßride Aide Unprepared
Caught even more off guard
was Pat Forster, Scott Mcßride's
administrative assistant. Since
Meßride was in Washington pray-1
ing, Forster rose to speak in fa
vor of the resolution before he
left town also.
He obviously had not read past
the opening apologetic para
graphs, for in his supporting
speech he praised:
• The "wait and see attitude"
evidenced by the resolution. "The
bureaucracy has moved ex
tremely fast, which is better than
the 'trial by newspaper' which is
going on now."
• This refusal to take any fur
ther action which would both
"hinder the progress made by
Dean Winbigler's judicial com
mittee" and "would only prove
a certain degree of irresponsibil
ity among the students."
• The recognition that "we can
not go so far as to determine the
hiring and firing of administra
tors."
At that point, one of the repre
sentatives brought his attention
to tho "sole jurisdiction" section.
Forster said that the "ASSU has
had tremendous increase in au
thority over the last few years,
and this tendency will increase."
When further questioned about
how he could philosophically
justify such a declaration, he told
the questioner he would talk to
him later, since he now had to go
to the airport.
The Move To Strike
Overwhelmed by the enormity j
of the proposition and the con
fusing alliance of Forster and!
the GCC, those who opposed the i
resolution or who just had not i
considered it thoroughly moved
to strike it for later considera- ,
lion as a separate resolution, com- |
plete with explanatory whereases.
Immediately, the graduates
went on the offensive:
"Is this how to itiii a Univer i

, sity," computer science grad
i Feldman asked, "with thought
police, spy systems, girls taking
; notes on their TA's and then run
| ning giggling to the Dean? We
j must - stand up now and speak
! Ollt."
J Bob Hass, aTA in the English
Department, began by assuring
all the girls present that he'd
meet them "out in the hall after
the vote." Yet later, in a soft
spoken contrast to Feldman's
style, he declared "this resolution
is no apology for questioning
abuses of rights given us by the
Trustees."
The debate moved on for an
other half hour, then the vote
was taken.
GC'C Challenges Substitutes
A hand vote showed the strik
ing amendment going down 58-59,
so a roll call vote was requested.
One of the more suspicious types
on the GCC moved that substi
tutes be challenged to produce
I their notes before voting. Shaw
ruled him out of order, said he
didn't want to waste so much
time by checking every sub's
note.
The motion to strike went down
60-62.
The opponents then moved to
strike the word "sole" from "sole
i jurisdiction." This was voted

Department, began by assuring
all the girls present that he'd
meet them "out in the hall after
the vote." Yet later, in a soft
spoken contrast to Feldman's
style, he declared "this resolution
is no apology for questioning
abuses of rights given us by the
Trustees."
The debate moved on for an
other half hour, then the vote
was taken.
GC'C Challenges Substitutes
A hand vote showed the strik
ing amendment going down 58-59,
so a roll call vote was requested.
One of the more suspicious types
on the GCC moved that substi
tutes be challenged to produce
I their notes before voting. Shaw
ruled him out of order, said he
didn't want to waste so much
time by checking every sub's
note.
The motion to strike went down
60-62.
The opponents then moved to
strike the word "sole" from "sole
i jurisdiction." This was voted
down by a slightly more substan
tial margin in the face of one of
the more trenchant puns heard in
the Legislature — "What if a stu
dent murders someone? Do we
still have sole jurisdiction?"
After another half-hour of what
Shaw called "quibbling," some
one finally called for a final
vote on the whole resolution. An
over w rough t representative
jumped to his feet and literally
screamed for adjournment so he
could consult his constituency.
He was overruled under protest.
Finally, after two and a half
hours of debate, the resolution
j was passed by hand vote.
"Some of these guys could give
I lessons to the Southern filibust
ered," a reporter from the
Examiner declared in disgust
after missing his deadline.
Undoubtedly, they will do so
again this week, as LASStT again
turns to debating important and
complex issues in a manner often
reminiscent of the balcony crowd
l at (he Sunday night Hicks.
What has happened to LASSU?
To put it precisely, the Gradu
ate Coordinating Committee.
Last Thursday, in the first
meeting of the Legislature since
a special election filled 52 vacant
graduate seats, the GCC won its
first test of power—albeit quite
narrowly—as LASSU voted to
"assert that the ASSU shall have
sole judisdiction over student af
fairs and conduct."
The GCC victory was the result
of several factors, the most im
portant of which was their own
monolithic unity on the key vote
to strike the above-quoted section
from an otherwise innocuous reso
lution. The amendment to strike
was defeated 60-62.
In that vote, the most obvious
bloc was the representatives of
the Graduate School of Humani
ties and Sciences. With 19 of their
21 representatives present and
voting, the vote to strike went
down 0-19. This contributed to a
20-29 repudiation of the striking
motion by the graduates, a major
ity that the undergraduates
with a 40-38 tally could not quite
undo.
The only other discernable
trend was a male-female split
among the undergraduates.
Stern was unanimous for strik
ing; Wilbur nearly so. The eating
clubs and the frats were 2-1 for.
Only the all-male off-campus vote
went with the GCC, 3-7.
On the distaff side, Uoble,
Branner, Flo Mo and the Row
were split, but all of Lagunita's
representatives were opposed.
Graduates Lead Parade
However, the GCC provided
nearly all the offense. From this
group came the sponsor of the
resolution — Jay Kadane. From
this group also came the principle
defenders of the controversial
section — Bob Hass and Gary
Feldman. And it was this group,
with their supporters in the
visitor's section, that initiated
something new in Legislature's
procedings — partisan applause
after nearly every speech by Mr.
Kadane and his friends.
Another way in which th e
GCC helped itself was in its
method of presenting the issue.
The "sole jurisdiction" section
was literally buried in the fourth
and last "resolved" clause of an
otherwise conciliatory resolution.

This strategy, coupled with the
very audacity of such a sugges
tion, caught some of the LASSU
leaders by surprise. Speaker Ed
Shaw, when questioned about the
Trustees' reaction to such a
declaration, was at a loss for
words. He maintained a strict neu
trality throughout the proceed
ings.
Meßride Aide Unprepared
Caught even more off guard
was Pat Forster, Scott Mcßride's
administrative assistant. Since
Meßride was in Washington pray-1
ing, Forster rose to speak in fa
vor of the resolution before he
left town also.
He obviously had not read past
the opening apologetic para
graphs, for in his supporting
speech he praised:
• The "wait and see attitude"
evidenced by the resolution. "The
bureaucracy has moved ex
tremely fast, which is better than
the 'trial by newspaper' which is
going on now."
• This refusal to take any fur
ther action which would both
"hinder the progress made by
Dean Winbigler's judicial com
mittee" and "would only prove
a certain degree of irresponsibil
ity among the students."
• The recognition that "we can
not go so far as to determine the
hiring and firing of administra
tors."
At that point, one of the repre
sentatives brought his attention
to tho "sole jurisdiction" section.
Forster said that the "ASSU has
had tremendous increase in au
thority over the last few years,
and this tendency will increase."
When further questioned about
how he could philosophically
justify such a declaration, he told
the questioner he would talk to
him later, since he now had to go
to the airport.
The Move To Strike
Overwhelmed by the enormity j
of the proposition and the con
fusing alliance of Forster and!
the GCC, those who opposed the i
resolution or who just had not i
considered it thoroughly moved
to strike it for later considera- ,
lion as a separate resolution, com- |
plete with explanatory whereases.
Immediately, the graduates
went on the offensive:
"Is this how to itiii a Univer i

, sity," computer science grad
i Feldman asked, "with thought
police, spy systems, girls taking
; notes on their TA's and then run
| ning giggling to the Dean? We
j must - stand up now and speak
! Ollt."
J Bob Hass, aTA in the English
Department, began by assuring

and this tendency will increase."
When further questioned about
how he could philosophically
justify such a declaration, he told
the questioner he would talk to
him later, since he now had to go
to the airport.
The Move To Strike
Overwhelmed by the enormity j
of the proposition and the con
fusing alliance of Forster and!
the GCC, those who opposed the i
resolution or who just had not i
considered it thoroughly moved
to strike it for later considera- ,
lion as a separate resolution, com- |
plete with explanatory whereases.
Immediately, the graduates
went on the offensive:
"Is this how to itiii a Univer i

, sity," computer science grad
i Feldman asked, "with thought
police, spy systems, girls taking
; notes on their TA's and then run
| ning giggling to the Dean? We
j must - stand up now and speak
! Ollt."
J Bob Hass, aTA in the English
Department, began by assuring
all the girls present that he'd
meet them "out in the hall after
the vote." Yet later, in a soft
spoken contrast to Feldman's
style, he declared "this resolution
is no apology for questioning
abuses of rights given us by the
Trustees."
The debate moved on for an
other half hour, then the vote
was taken.
GC'C Challenges Substitutes
A hand vote showed the strik
ing amendment going down 58-59,
so a roll call vote was requested.
One of the more suspicious types
on the GCC moved that substi
tutes be challenged to produce
I their notes before voting. Shaw
ruled him out of order, said he
didn't want to waste so much
time by checking every sub's
note.
The motion to strike went down
60-62.
The opponents then moved to
strike the word "sole" from "sole
i jurisdiction." This was voted
down by a slightly more substan
tial margin in the face of one of
the more trenchant puns heard in
the Legislature — "What if a stu
dent murders someone? Do we
still have sole jurisdiction?"
After another half-hour of what
Shaw called "quibbling," some
one finally called for a final
vote on the whole resolution. An
over w rough t representative
jumped to his feet and literally
screamed for adjournment so he
could consult his constituency.
He was overruled under protest.
Finally, after two and a half
hours of debate, the resolution
j was passed by hand vote.
"Some of these guys could give
I lessons to the Southern filibust
ered," a reporter from the
Examiner declared in disgust
after missing his deadline.
Undoubtedly, they will do so
again this week, as LASStT again
turns to debating important and
complex issues in a manner often
reminiscent of the balcony crowd
l at (he Sunday night Hicks.
