## Committee Reports Demanded

| Editor, Tile Daily:
Two issues of very groat im
portance to the Stanford commu
nity have arisen from the LASSU
Judicial Report: 1) administrative
interference in the teaching proc
ess -the issue of academic free
dom; and 2) administrative inter
ference in the student judicial
process — the issue of students'
rights.
In the area of academic 112 roe
dom, the matter has always been
perfectly clear. Faculty and stu
dents cannot tolerate outside in
terference with the content of
study.
In the area of students' rights,
the issues have been obscured by
inadequate definition, but LASSU,
at its recent emergency meeting,
has clarified the matter for the
future. The danger of administra
tive interference with the judicial
process has made it essential for
students to assert their right to
govern their own affairs.
The LASSU Report charges
administrative interference with
both academic freedom and stu
dents' rights. Members of the ad
ministration have issued state
ments which conflict with those
charges. We commend the official
appointment of a faculty commit
tee to investigate that conflict,
and we assume that it will act in
full cooperation with the LASSU
emergency investigating commit
tee. We believe that in order to
resolve the conflict between the
charges and denials and to clear
the air of rumor and suspicion,
these two investigatory commit
tees must make public a full
statement of their findings as
soon as possible.

112 Editor, The Daily:
We wish to thank Darrell Hal
! verson, Nora Crow, and Ed Shaw
j for bringing the problem of slu
' dent judiciary-administration re
lations to the attention of the
( Stanford student body. This ac
tion can only be applauded a 11 d
j supported, for it has been a long
11 im e since Stanford students
| have even dared think on the
j winds of freedom blowing. As
! was noted in the editorial, the
awareness of a lack of commu
j nication between the administra
tion and the students of this Uni
| versity has led the latter to main
tain only the minimum of rela
tions with the Administration.
' The result of this attitude on the
part of the students, one most
rational when the students' at
tempt to clarify an issue only
leads to deliberate and further
obfuscation, has led some mem
bers of the Administration to em
ploy methods one would hardly
call judicial—'let alone honest.
The women on this campus have
endured not only a more than ade
quate dose of nonsense but also
an incredible lack of respect. We
appreciate the fact that Miss
Crow, Mr. Halverson, and Mr.
Shaw have initiated a re-evalua
tion of our ability to control our
selves both in public and in pri
vate.
We would like especially to en
dorse Miss Crow's action in mak
ing public the attitude of Dean
Allen towards the faculty mem
bers of the Department of Eng
lish. To put any restrictions on
the material that a teaching as
sistant or professor may use in
his course is intolerable.

• Dialogue Does Exist
Editor, The Daily:
Your contention that the ad
ministration "has rarely, if ever,
participated in an open, public
discussion of University prob
lems" appears to bo made either
in ignorance or in spite of the
facts. While in tho past there may
have been justification for this
accusation, tho present situation
indicates tho administration is far
more willing than in any recent
year to moot and discuss mutual
problems with students.
Thus far this quarter there
have been two major programs
aimod at. fostering a dialogue be
tween administration and stu
dents. The ST&T program s a w
President Sterling speak to the
University on depersonalization.
Following his address every liv
ing group was offered the oppor
tunity of having an administrator
for dinner and discussion on any
topic of interest. Over 75 per
cent of the undergraduate living
groups, with tho exception of
Stern, took advantage of this
opportunity. During tho past week
there has been a program on fra
ternities with a speech by Presi
dent Sterling and two panels of
administrators discussing the
housing and other problems of
fraternities. Is this a monologue?
I There are more such occasions
in tho planning. Last Tuesday, in
a meeting with tho ST&T Com
mit too. several administrators, in
cluding Deans Gordon and Win
i bigler expressed groat interest in
a monthly or semimonthly, in

formal discussion session with
students. They expressed no lack
of desire to participate in th e s e
programs. Rather, they were con
cerned with how to secure suffi
cient publicity to ensure a good
turnout.
It impresses me that your ne
glecting these facts is indicative
of your attitude of solving the j
communications problem. Rather!
than meet with the administration '
in an effort to promote a dia- j
logue, you continually antagonize
them by poor publicity, misquota
tions, and unfounded criticisms'
such as the editorial in question. J
Cub reporters: The yellow,
press is not the most effective I
means of communication.

• Shaw's Answer
Editor, The Daily:
There will undoubtedly bo vari
ous reactions to the report of Miss
Crow and Mr. Halverson on stu
dent judiciary and administration
relations which was printed in
yesterday's Daily. Indeed, some of
our quicker thinkers on campus
have already responded. Take, for
example, our illustrious LASSU
Speaker, Mr. Ed Shaw:
I cannot help but compare our ;
situation here at Stanford with
the recent developments at the !
United States Air Force Aca- j
demy. That grave matters are i
involved at both institutions is \
obvious. The difference is that ;
we intend to go about our
house cleaning in as open and
beneficial a manner as is pos
sible.
If Mr. Shaw "cannot help but j
compare," I, for one, should pre
fer his analogies to come rather j
from the head than the heart. The
only possible connection between
the Stanford situation and that of j
the Academy is that matters are 1
indeed "grave." The brillance of !
the comparison is, however, over- j
shadowed by its deficiencies. 1
point out only the most obvious: j
the Academy situation involved
student violation of existing honor
code rules; the Stanford situation j
involves the absence of any real J
limits to administrative discipli-;
nary power and the question of I
administrative influence in the
academic world.
All of this is not merely a face- j
tious criticism of Mr. Shaw's abil-'

ily to express himself by analogy;
il is a criticism of the kind of in- ■
stantaneous emotional thinking
which is apt to appear in any sit-1
uation of this sort. Let us hope in
tiie days to come that the major-1
ity of Stanford students will be'
able to refrain from such quick)
I wit ted indulgences.

• Moral Duties
Kditor, The Daily:
After reading the Crow-Halver
i son report in The Daily it strikes
1 me that the University is very
lackadaisical in carrying out its
judicial and moral duties. There
are probably thousands of lewd,
immoral students and faculty who
have engaged in extramarital
I sexual relationships with out
! ever coming to the notice of the
i administration. This includes the
heart-rending cases of virgin
coeds being seduced and thereby
becoming little better than street
walkers. With the desire of help
ing the administration rid th e
campus of moral degenerates I
offer the following suggestions:
• Require that at the begin
ning of each academic year all
j students and faculty sign an oath
| stating 1 hat they have never en
gaged in extra-marital sex rela
tions; and if married that they
have never performed any abnor
mal sex practices with their
spouse.
• Expand the honor code so
j that a student must report to the
administration any other student
known to have engaged in sexual
! intercourse.
• Construct hidden areas where
i detectives and cameras can be in
! stalled so as to provide surveil
lance of sleeping quarters a n d
I bathrooms so as to catch students
engaged in masturbation or
. homosexual behavior. If Walter
i Jenkins had been expelled from
! college he could never have be
come a national security risk in
I later years.
• Initiate conferences with the
j administration at the University
of Mississippi which has a suc
| cessful program of students re
i porting any subversive views of
the faculty to the administration.
• Investigate the relationship
J between radical student activity
j and sexual misbehavior encourag
; ing local newspapers to denounce
; the communist-sex-fiends.

• Shaw's Answer
Editor, The Daily:
There will undoubtedly bo vari
ous reactions to the report of Miss
Crow and Mr. Halverson on stu
dent judiciary and administration
relations which was printed in
yesterday's Daily. Indeed, some of
our quicker thinkers on campus
have already responded. Take, for
example, our illustrious LASSU
Speaker, Mr. Ed Shaw:
I cannot help but compare our ;
situation here at Stanford with
the recent developments at the !
United States Air Force Aca- j
demy. That grave matters are i
involved at both institutions is \
obvious. The difference is that ;
we intend to go about our
house cleaning in as open and
beneficial a manner as is pos
sible.
If Mr. Shaw "cannot help but j
compare," I, for one, should pre
fer his analogies to come rather j
from the head than the heart. The
only possible connection between
the Stanford situation and that of j
the Academy is that matters are 1
indeed "grave." The brillance of !
the comparison is, however, over- j
shadowed by its deficiencies. 1
point out only the most obvious: j
the Academy situation involved
student violation of existing honor
code rules; the Stanford situation j
involves the absence of any real J
limits to administrative discipli-;
nary power and the question of I
administrative influence in the
academic world.
All of this is not merely a face- j
tious criticism of Mr. Shaw's abil-'

ily to express himself by analogy;
il is a criticism of the kind of in- ■
stantaneous emotional thinking
which is apt to appear in any sit-1
uation of this sort. Let us hope in
tiie days to come that the major-1
ity of Stanford students will be'
able to refrain from such quick)

• Moral Duties
Kditor, The Daily:
After reading the Crow-Halver
i son report in The Daily it strikes
1 me that the University is very
lackadaisical in carrying out its
judicial and moral duties. There
are probably thousands of lewd,
immoral students and faculty who
have engaged in extramarital
I sexual relationships with out
! ever coming to the notice of the
i administration. This includes the
heart-rending cases of virgin
coeds being seduced and thereby
becoming little better than street
walkers. With the desire of help
ing the administration rid th e
campus of moral degenerates I
offer the following suggestions:
• Require that at the begin
ning of each academic year all
j students and faculty sign an oath
| stating 1 hat they have never en
gaged in extra-marital sex rela
tions; and if married that they
have never performed any abnor
mal sex practices with their
spouse.
• Expand the honor code so
j that a student must report to the
administration any other student
known to have engaged in sexual
! intercourse.
• Construct hidden areas where
i detectives and cameras can be in
! stalled so as to provide surveil
lance of sleeping quarters a n d
I bathrooms so as to catch students
engaged in masturbation or
. homosexual behavior. If Walter
i Jenkins had been expelled from
! college he could never have be
come a national security risk in
I later years.
• Initiate conferences with the
j administration at the University
of Mississippi which has a suc
| cessful program of students re
i porting any subversive views of
the faculty to the administration.
• Investigate the relationship
J between radical student activity
j and sexual misbehavior encourag
; ing local newspapers to denounce
; the communist-sex-fiends.

Two issues of very groat im
portance to the Stanford commu
nity have arisen from the LASSU
Judicial Report: 1) administrative
interference in the teaching proc
ess -the issue of academic free
dom; and 2) administrative inter
ference in the student judicial
process — the issue of students'
rights.
In the area of academic 112 roe
dom, the matter has always been
perfectly clear. Faculty and stu
dents cannot tolerate outside in
terference with the content of
study.
In the area of students' rights,
the issues have been obscured by
inadequate definition, but LASSU,
at its recent emergency meeting,
has clarified the matter for the
future. The danger of administra
tive interference with the judicial
process has made it essential for
students to assert their right to
govern their own affairs.
The LASSU Report charges
administrative interference with
both academic freedom and stu
dents' rights. Members of the ad
ministration have issued state
ments which conflict with those
charges. We commend the official
appointment of a faculty commit
tee to investigate that conflict,
and we assume that it will act in
full cooperation with the LASSU
emergency investigating commit
tee. We believe that in order to
resolve the conflict between the
charges and denials and to clear
the air of rumor and suspicion,
these two investigatory commit
tees must make public a full
statement of their findings as
soon as possible.

' The result of this attitude on the

The women on this campus have

• Dialogue Does Exist
Editor, The Daily:
Your contention that the ad
ministration "has rarely, if ever,
participated in an open, public
discussion of University prob
lems" appears to bo made either
in ignorance or in spite of the
facts. While in tho past there may
have been justification for this
accusation, tho present situation
indicates tho administration is far
more willing than in any recent
year to moot and discuss mutual
problems with students.
Thus far this quarter there
have been two major programs
aimod at. fostering a dialogue be
tween administration and stu
dents. The ST&T program s a w
President Sterling speak to the
University on depersonalization.
Following his address every liv
ing group was offered the oppor
tunity of having an administrator
for dinner and discussion on any
topic of interest. Over 75 per
cent of the undergraduate living
groups, with tho exception of
Stern, took advantage of this
opportunity. During tho past week
there has been a program on fra
ternities with a speech by Presi
dent Sterling and two panels of
administrators discussing the
housing and other problems of
fraternities. Is this a monologue?
I There are more such occasions
in tho planning. Last Tuesday, in
a meeting with tho ST&T Com
mit too. several administrators, in
cluding Deans Gordon and Win
i bigler expressed groat interest in
a monthly or semimonthly, in

formal discussion session with
students. They expressed no lack
of desire to participate in th e s e
programs. Rather, they were con

• Dialogue Does Exist
Editor, The Daily:
Your contention that the ad
ministration "has rarely, if ever,
participated in an open, public
discussion of University prob
lems" appears to bo made either
in ignorance or in spite of the
facts. While in tho past there may
have been justification for this
accusation, tho present situation
indicates tho administration is far
more willing than in any recent
year to moot and discuss mutual
problems with students.
Thus far this quarter there
have been two major programs
aimod at. fostering a dialogue be
tween administration and stu
dents. The ST&T program s a w
President Sterling speak to the
University on depersonalization.
Following his address every liv
ing group was offered the oppor
tunity of having an administrator
for dinner and discussion on any
topic of interest. Over 75 per
cent of the undergraduate living
groups, with tho exception of
Stern, took advantage of this
opportunity. During tho past week
there has been a program on fra
ternities with a speech by Presi
dent Sterling and two panels of
administrators discussing the
housing and other problems of
fraternities. Is this a monologue?
I There are more such occasions
in tho planning. Last Tuesday, in
a meeting with tho ST&T Com
mit too. several administrators, in
cluding Deans Gordon and Win
i bigler expressed groat interest in
a monthly or semimonthly, in

formal discussion session with
students. They expressed no lack
of desire to participate in th e s e
programs. Rather, they were con
cerned with how to secure suffi

It impresses me that your ne

• Shaw's Answer
Editor, The Daily:
There will undoubtedly bo vari
ous reactions to the report of Miss
Crow and Mr. Halverson on stu
dent judiciary and administration
relations which was printed in
yesterday's Daily. Indeed, some of
our quicker thinkers on campus
have already responded. Take, for
example, our illustrious LASSU
Speaker, Mr. Ed Shaw:
I cannot help but compare our ;
situation here at Stanford with
the recent developments at the !
United States Air Force Aca- j
demy. That grave matters are i
involved at both institutions is \
obvious. The difference is that ;
we intend to go about our
house cleaning in as open and
beneficial a manner as is pos
sible.
If Mr. Shaw "cannot help but j
compare," I, for one, should pre
fer his analogies to come rather j
from the head than the heart. The
only possible connection between
the Stanford situation and that of j
the Academy is that matters are 1
indeed "grave." The brillance of !
the comparison is, however, over- j
shadowed by its deficiencies. 1
point out only the most obvious: j
the Academy situation involved
student violation of existing honor
code rules; the Stanford situation j
involves the absence of any real J
limits to administrative discipli-;
nary power and the question of I
administrative influence in the
academic world.
All of this is not merely a face- j
tious criticism of Mr. Shaw's abil-'

ily to express himself by analogy;
il is a criticism of the kind of in- ■
stantaneous emotional thinking
which is apt to appear in any sit-1

• Moral Duties
Kditor, The Daily:
After reading the Crow-Halver
i son report in The Daily it strikes
1 me that the University is very
lackadaisical in carrying out its
judicial and moral duties. There
are probably thousands of lewd,
immoral students and faculty who
have engaged in extramarital
I sexual relationships with out
! ever coming to the notice of the
i administration. This includes the
heart-rending cases of virgin
coeds being seduced and thereby
becoming little better than street
walkers. With the desire of help
ing the administration rid th e
campus of moral degenerates I
offer the following suggestions:
• Require that at the begin
ning of each academic year all
j students and faculty sign an oath
| stating 1 hat they have never en
gaged in extra-marital sex rela
tions; and if married that they
have never performed any abnor
mal sex practices with their
spouse.
• Expand the honor code so
j that a student must report to the
administration any other student
known to have engaged in sexual
! intercourse.
• Construct hidden areas where
i detectives and cameras can be in
! stalled so as to provide surveil
lance of sleeping quarters a n d
I bathrooms so as to catch students
engaged in masturbation or
. homosexual behavior. If Walter
i Jenkins had been expelled from
! college he could never have be
come a national security risk in
I later years.
• Initiate conferences with the
j administration at the University
of Mississippi which has a suc
| cessful program of students re
i porting any subversive views of
the faculty to the administration.
• Investigate the relationship
J between radical student activity
j and sexual misbehavior encourag
; ing local newspapers to denounce
; the communist-sex-fiends.

Two issues of very groat im

In the area of academic 112 roe

In the area of students' rights,
the issues have been obscured by
inadequate definition, but LASSU,
at its recent emergency meeting,
has clarified the matter for the

process has made it essential for
students to assert their right to
govern their own affairs.
The LASSU Report charges
administrative interference with
both academic freedom and stu

• Moral Duties
Kditor, The Daily:
After reading the Crow-Halver
i son report in The Daily it strikes
1 me that the University is very
lackadaisical in carrying out its
judicial and moral duties. There
are probably thousands of lewd,
immoral students and faculty who
have engaged in extramarital
I sexual relationships with out
! ever coming to the notice of the
i administration. This includes the
heart-rending cases of virgin
coeds being seduced and thereby
becoming little better than street
walkers. With the desire of help
ing the administration rid th e
campus of moral degenerates I
offer the following suggestions:
• Require that at the begin
ning of each academic year all
j students and faculty sign an oath
| stating 1 hat they have never en
gaged in extra-marital sex rela
tions; and if married that they
have never performed any abnor
mal sex practices with their
spouse.
• Expand the honor code so
j that a student must report to the
administration any other student
known to have engaged in sexual
! intercourse.
• Construct hidden areas where
i detectives and cameras can be in
! stalled so as to provide surveil
lance of sleeping quarters a n d
I bathrooms so as to catch students
engaged in masturbation or
. homosexual behavior. If Walter
i Jenkins had been expelled from
! college he could never have be
come a national security risk in
I later years.
• Initiate conferences with the
j administration at the University
of Mississippi which has a suc
| cessful program of students re
i porting any subversive views of
the faculty to the administration.
• Investigate the relationship
J between radical student activity
j and sexual misbehavior encourag
; ing local newspapers to denounce
; the communist-sex-fiends.

Two issues of very groat im
portance to the Stanford commu
nity have arisen from the LASSU
Judicial Report: 1) administrative
interference in the teaching proc
ess -the issue of academic free
dom; and 2) administrative inter
ference in the student judicial
process — the issue of students'
rights.
In the area of academic 112 roe
dom, the matter has always been
perfectly clear. Faculty and stu
dents cannot tolerate outside in
terference with the content of
study.
In the area of students' rights,
the issues have been obscured by
inadequate definition, but LASSU,
at its recent emergency meeting,
has clarified the matter for the
future. The danger of administra
tive interference with the judicial
process has made it essential for
students to assert their right to
govern their own affairs.
The LASSU Report charges
administrative interference with
both academic freedom and stu
dents' rights. Members of the ad
ministration have issued state
ments which conflict with those
charges. We commend the official
appointment of a faculty commit
tee to investigate that conflict,
and we assume that it will act in
full cooperation with the LASSU
emergency investigating commit
tee. We believe that in order to
resolve the conflict between the
charges and denials and to clear
the air of rumor and suspicion,
these two investigatory commit
tees must make public a full
statement of their findings as
soon as possible.

• Dialogue Does Exist
Editor, The Daily:
Your contention that the ad
ministration "has rarely, if ever,
participated in an open, public
discussion of University prob
lems" appears to bo made either
in ignorance or in spite of the
facts. While in tho past there may
have been justification for this
accusation, tho present situation
indicates tho administration is far
more willing than in any recent
year to moot and discuss mutual
problems with students.
Thus far this quarter there
have been two major programs
aimod at. fostering a dialogue be
tween administration and stu
dents. The ST&T program s a w
President Sterling speak to the
University on depersonalization.
Following his address every liv
ing group was offered the oppor
tunity of having an administrator
for dinner and discussion on any
topic of interest. Over 75 per
cent of the undergraduate living
groups, with tho exception of
Stern, took advantage of this
opportunity. During tho past week
there has been a program on fra
ternities with a speech by Presi
dent Sterling and two panels of
administrators discussing the
housing and other problems of
fraternities. Is this a monologue?
I There are more such occasions
in tho planning. Last Tuesday, in
a meeting with tho ST&T Com
mit too. several administrators, in
cluding Deans Gordon and Win
i bigler expressed groat interest in
a monthly or semimonthly, in

formal discussion session with
students. They expressed no lack
of desire to participate in th e s e
programs. Rather, they were con
cerned with how to secure suffi
cient publicity to ensure a good
turnout.
It impresses me that your ne
glecting these facts is indicative
of your attitude of solving the j
communications problem. Rather!
than meet with the administration '
in an effort to promote a dia- j

11 im e since Stanford students
| have even dared think on the
j winds of freedom blowing. As
! was noted in the editorial, the
awareness of a lack of commu
j nication between the administra
tion and the students of this Uni
| versity has led the latter to main
tain only the minimum of rela
tions with the Administration.
' The result of this attitude on the
part of the students, one most
rational when the students' at
tempt to clarify an issue only
leads to deliberate and further
obfuscation, has led some mem
bers of the Administration to em
ploy methods one would hardly
call judicial—'let alone honest.
The women on this campus have
endured not only a more than ade
quate dose of nonsense but also
an incredible lack of respect. We
appreciate the fact that Miss
Crow, Mr. Halverson, and Mr.
Shaw have initiated a re-evalua
tion of our ability to control our
selves both in public and in pri
vate.
We would like especially to en
dorse Miss Crow's action in mak
ing public the attitude of Dean
Allen towards the faculty mem
bers of the Department of Eng
lish. To put any restrictions on
the material that a teaching as
sistant or professor may use in
his course is intolerable.

• Dialogue Does Exist
Editor, The Daily:
Your contention that the ad
ministration "has rarely, if ever,
participated in an open, public
discussion of University prob
lems" appears to bo made either
in ignorance or in spite of the
facts. While in tho past there may
have been justification for this
accusation, tho present situation
indicates tho administration is far
more willing than in any recent
year to moot and discuss mutual
problems with students.
Thus far this quarter there
have been two major programs
aimod at. fostering a dialogue be
tween administration and stu
dents. The ST&T program s a w
President Sterling speak to the
University on depersonalization.
Following his address every liv
ing group was offered the oppor
tunity of having an administrator
for dinner and discussion on any
topic of interest. Over 75 per
cent of the undergraduate living
groups, with tho exception of
Stern, took advantage of this
opportunity. During tho past week
there has been a program on fra
ternities with a speech by Presi
dent Sterling and two panels of
administrators discussing the
housing and other problems of
fraternities. Is this a monologue?
I There are more such occasions
in tho planning. Last Tuesday, in
a meeting with tho ST&T Com
mit too. several administrators, in
cluding Deans Gordon and Win
i bigler expressed groat interest in
a monthly or semimonthly, in

formal discussion session with
students. They expressed no lack
of desire to participate in th e s e
programs. Rather, they were con
cerned with how to secure suffi
cient publicity to ensure a good
turnout.
It impresses me that your ne
glecting these facts is indicative
of your attitude of solving the j
communications problem. Rather!
than meet with the administration '
in an effort to promote a dia- j
logue, you continually antagonize
them by poor publicity, misquota
tions, and unfounded criticisms'
such as the editorial in question. J
Cub reporters: The yellow,
press is not the most effective I
means of communication.

• Shaw's Answer
Editor, The Daily:
There will undoubtedly bo vari
ous reactions to the report of Miss
Crow and Mr. Halverson on stu
dent judiciary and administration
relations which was printed in
yesterday's Daily. Indeed, some of
our quicker thinkers on campus
have already responded. Take, for
example, our illustrious LASSU
Speaker, Mr. Ed Shaw:
I cannot help but compare our ;
situation here at Stanford with
the recent developments at the !
United States Air Force Aca- j
demy. That grave matters are i
involved at both institutions is \
obvious. The difference is that ;
we intend to go about our
house cleaning in as open and
beneficial a manner as is pos
sible.
If Mr. Shaw "cannot help but j
compare," I, for one, should pre
fer his analogies to come rather j
from the head than the heart. The
only possible connection between
the Stanford situation and that of j
the Academy is that matters are 1
indeed "grave." The brillance of !
the comparison is, however, over- j
shadowed by its deficiencies. 1
point out only the most obvious: j
the Academy situation involved
student violation of existing honor
code rules; the Stanford situation j
involves the absence of any real J
limits to administrative discipli-;
nary power and the question of I
administrative influence in the
academic world.
All of this is not merely a face- j
tious criticism of Mr. Shaw's abil-'

ily to express himself by analogy;
il is a criticism of the kind of in- ■
stantaneous emotional thinking
which is apt to appear in any sit-1
uation of this sort. Let us hope in
tiie days to come that the major-1
ity of Stanford students will be'
able to refrain from such quick)
I wit ted indulgences.

• Moral Duties
Kditor, The Daily:
After reading the Crow-Halver
i son report in The Daily it strikes
1 me that the University is very
lackadaisical in carrying out its
judicial and moral duties. There
are probably thousands of lewd,
immoral students and faculty who
have engaged in extramarital
I sexual relationships with out
! ever coming to the notice of the
i administration. This includes the
heart-rending cases of virgin
coeds being seduced and thereby
becoming little better than street
walkers. With the desire of help
ing the administration rid th e
campus of moral degenerates I
offer the following suggestions:
• Require that at the begin
ning of each academic year all
j students and faculty sign an oath
| stating 1 hat they have never en
gaged in extra-marital sex rela
tions; and if married that they
have never performed any abnor
mal sex practices with their
spouse.
• Expand the honor code so
j that a student must report to the
administration any other student
known to have engaged in sexual
! intercourse.
• Construct hidden areas where
i detectives and cameras can be in
! stalled so as to provide surveil
lance of sleeping quarters a n d
I bathrooms so as to catch students
engaged in masturbation or
. homosexual behavior. If Walter
i Jenkins had been expelled from
! college he could never have be
come a national security risk in
I later years.
• Initiate conferences with the
j administration at the University
of Mississippi which has a suc
| cessful program of students re
i porting any subversive views of
the faculty to the administration.
• Investigate the relationship
J between radical student activity
j and sexual misbehavior encourag
; ing local newspapers to denounce
; the communist-sex-fiends.
