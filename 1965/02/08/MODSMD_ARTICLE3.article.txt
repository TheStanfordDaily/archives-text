j The Crow-Halverson Report to LASSU.
| cause of the current campus controversy
over the Stanford dencry, had its roots
in connection with the handling of the
Frank Morse case last spring.
It was then that seeds of disenchantment
with the relationship between the Deans'
! Office and the student judiciary were first
i sown in the minds of Darrell Halvcrson,
; who was then chairman of Men's Council
and Judicial Council, and Nora Crow, who
was a member of tlie latter group. At that
time, Halvcrson told The Daily yesterday,
he first committed himself mentally to put
into writing his complaints about "irregu
larities" in the handling of student discipli
nary cases by th office of H. Donald Win
bigler, dean of mdents.
IT WAS N<? / long thereafter that Miss
| Crow attender the luncheon with Deans Lu
i file Allen a' .1 Elizabeth Avery at which
| Dean Allen inegedly asked Women's Coun
! cil to report on the content of Stanford Eng
-1 lish Department lectures. Also in attend
j anee were six other members and members
select of Women's Council, Kate Branstcn,
Terry Mot an, Karon Booth, Vicky Oanz.
Caroline Ward, and then-Chairman Marion
1 Leib.

"We didn't wish to make the substance
of our discussion with Dean Allen known
at thai time," Miss Crow told The Daily
yesterday, "because the Council was trying
to re-establish a working relationship with
the Deans' Office after the Frank Morse
case."
Miss Crow, as chairman-select, was to
be the one through whom Dean Allen would
communicate confidential information on
sex cases to the Council, and as such, "was
afraid to jeopardize the Council's work."
BUT ONCE Autumn Quarter was well
underway, Miss Crow realized thai the re
lationship was no longer a working one:
"Dean Allen was angry about the publica
tion of precedent cases in The Daily and
had almost entirely cut off relations with
the Council. I was no longer running a risk
of hurting the Council by making the con
tent of the discussion known to some fac
ulty members."
Having come to this conclusion, Miss
Crow and her fellow Council members then
wrote up a four-page summary of Dean Al
len's statements at the luncheon discus
sion.
The statement was signed by three of the
who had attended, and was handed
over to a member of the English faculty,
who in turn presented it to a member of the
Executive Committee.' <>112 the Academic

Council, Stanford's top faculty group. This
attempt at channeling the report through
the faculty met with little response, Miss
Crow said.
AFTER A CONVERSATION at the be
ginning of this quarter, Halverson and Miss
Crow decided to combine their complaints
against the actions of the two deans, Win
bigler and Miss Allen, into the unified re
port published in last Thursday's Daily.
The text of the earlier four-page statement
was incorporated into the larger statement.
Their original plan was to publish the full
report in the Winter Quarter issue of the
Sequoia. Editor Charlotte Low at first
agreed, but later changed her mind on the
grounds of "difficulties of content program
ming." The theme of the issue was to be
civil rights, Miss Low told Halverson and
Miss Crow, but if they wished, the report
could be run in the Spring Quarter edition.
Miss Crow, who was by this time becom
ing somewhat apprehensive about the whole
situation, and Halverson, who will graduate
at the end of Winter Quarter, decided they
did not want lo wait that long.
(Tomorrow's article will discuss Miss
Crow's ami llalverson's consideration of
the (iCC's forthcoming Challenger maga
zine as a means or publication, and their
filial derision to clianiicl the report

"We didn't wish to make the substance
of our discussion with Dean Allen known
at thai time," Miss Crow told The Daily
yesterday, "because the Council was trying
to re-establish a working relationship with
the Deans' Office after the Frank Morse
case."
Miss Crow, as chairman-select, was to
be the one through whom Dean Allen would
communicate confidential information on
sex cases to the Council, and as such, "was
afraid to jeopardize the Council's work."
BUT ONCE Autumn Quarter was well
underway, Miss Crow realized thai the re
lationship was no longer a working one:
"Dean Allen was angry about the publica
tion of precedent cases in The Daily and
had almost entirely cut off relations with
the Council. I was no longer running a risk
of hurting the Council by making the con
tent of the discussion known to some fac
ulty members."
Having come to this conclusion, Miss
Crow and her fellow Council members then
wrote up a four-page summary of Dean Al
len's statements at the luncheon discus
sion.
The statement was signed by three of the
who had attended, and was handed
over to a member of the English faculty,
who in turn presented it to a member of the
Executive Committee.' <>112 the Academic

Council, Stanford's top faculty group. This
attempt at channeling the report through
the faculty met with little response, Miss
Crow said.
AFTER A CONVERSATION at the be
ginning of this quarter, Halverson and Miss
Crow decided to combine their complaints
against the actions of the two deans, Win
bigler and Miss Allen, into the unified re
port published in last Thursday's Daily.
The text of the earlier four-page statement
was incorporated into the larger statement.
Their original plan was to publish the full
report in the Winter Quarter issue of the
Sequoia. Editor Charlotte Low at first
agreed, but later changed her mind on the
grounds of "difficulties of content program
ming." The theme of the issue was to be
civil rights, Miss Low told Halverson and
Miss Crow, but if they wished, the report
could be run in the Spring Quarter edition.
Miss Crow, who was by this time becom
ing somewhat apprehensive about the whole
situation, and Halverson, who will graduate
at the end of Winter Quarter, decided they
did not want lo wait that long.
