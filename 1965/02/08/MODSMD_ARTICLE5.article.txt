### MIKE COUZENS 
Forty-nine Navy jets made the first
direct attack upon North Viet Nam land
installations yesterday. Infiltration bases
were targets in what Secretary of De
fense Robert S. McNamara described as
"Heavy fires .heavy smoke and substan
tial damage."
The action was a swift reply to sur
prise guerilla atlacks Saturday which
killed eight Americans and wounded 109.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON ordered with
drawal of U.S. dependents from South
Viet Nam and dispatched a Hawk mis
sille anti-aircraft battalion to the scene.
North Viet Nam claimed that four U.S.
planes had been shot down, but Secre
tary McNamara, in a press conference,
said that only one was lost. He identified
the plane as an A4D Skyhawk bomber,
and said the pilot had bailed out.
SOVIET PREMIER Alexei N. Kosy
gin was in Hanoi when the attacks were

made far to the South. Eight hours be
fore, he made a policy statement claim
ing that the U.S.S.R. "will not remain
indifferent" to any "acts of war" against
North Viet Nam.
An earlier retaliatory attack occurred
last August in response to patrol-boat at
tacks upon U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of
Tonkins. U.S. carrier planes replied with
the destruction of torpedo boat bases
and of an oil dump.
FOUR STANFORD professors when
questioned about the attacks, all c o n
curred that they saw no departure from
present policy. Claude A. Buss, professor
of history, believes that Secretary Mc-
Namara's statement honestly articulates
the U.S. position. ..
In a press conference, McNamara said,
"I think this is quite clear that this was
a test of the will, a clear challenge of the
political purpose of both the United
States and South Vietnamese govern
ments.
"It was a test and a challenge to which

neither the South Vietnamese govern
ment nor tiie United States government
could fail to respond without mislead
ing the North Vietnamese as to our in
tent and the strength of our purpose to
carry out that intent."

JAN F. TRISKA, associate professor
of political science, suggested, " perceive
the American response as an attempt to
suggest that nothing will slow down
American vigilance." But he views the
position an untenable in the long run.
"I suspect it is a put-up performance. I
think we will get out."

Prof. Buss summarized, "The conflict
is heating up. But the response was a
change in degree, not in kind. It does not
appear to be a turning point."

PROF. TRISKA believes that the
crisis will eventually end in negotiations.
Oli Holsti, Research Coordinator for the
Institute of Political Studies, speculated
in similar terms, "Perhaps this is an at
tempt to stiffen our policy for negotiated
settlement."

Prof. Triska sees the struggle for Viet
Nam in the wider context of a power con
frontation among China, the Soviet
Union and the United States. "The Rus
sians," he believes, "would like to be
major actors there. They would like some
kind of negotiated settlement."

PROF. BUSS emphasizes the chronic
problems of Viet Nam which cannot be
resolved by military action. lie explains
that each side in the conflict has a rea
sonable legal rationale, and that their
differences can only be resoved in ne
gotiation.

The North Vietnamese, he explains, ar
gue that north and south are one nation,
and that they are not aggressors. Th e
Americans, on the other hand ,are an
attacking foreign power.

From the American viewpoint, each
response is provoked by North Vietna
mese attacks. Prof. Buss suggests, "1
don't think any of the problems are
solved from yesterday to today. This is
not a crisis, but a long range situation."

carry out that intent."

JAN F. TRISKA, associate professor
of political science, suggested, " perceive
the American response as an attempt to
suggest that nothing will slow down
American vigilance." But he views the
position an untenable in the long run.
"I suspect it is a put-up performance. I
think we will get out."

Prof. Buss summarized, "The conflict
is heating up. But the response was a
change in degree, not in kind. It does not
appear to be a turning point."

PROF. TRISKA believes that the
crisis will eventually end in negotiations.
Oli Holsti, Research Coordinator for the
Institute of Political Studies, speculated
in similar terms, "Perhaps this is an at
tempt to stiffen our policy for negotiated
settlement."

Prof. Triska sees the struggle for Viet
Nam in the wider context of a power con
frontation among China, the Soviet
Union and the United States. "The Rus
sians," he believes, "would like to be
major actors there. They would like some
kind of negotiated settlement."

PROF. BUSS emphasizes the chronic
problems of Viet Nam which cannot be
resolved by military action. lie explains
that each side in the conflict has a rea
sonable legal rationale, and that their
differences can only be resoved in ne
gotiation.

The North Vietnamese, he explains, ar
gue that north and south are one nation,
and that they are not aggressors. Th e
Americans, on the other hand ,are an
attacking foreign power.

From the American viewpoint, each
response is provoked by North Vietna
mese attacks. Prof. Buss suggests, "1
don't think any of the problems are
solved from yesterday to today. This is
not a crisis, but a long range situation."
Forty-nine Navy jets made the first
direct attack upon North Viet Nam land
installations yesterday. Infiltration bases
were targets in what Secretary of De
fense Robert S. McNamara described as
"Heavy fires .heavy smoke and substan
tial damage."
The action was a swift reply to sur
prise guerilla atlacks Saturday which
killed eight Americans and wounded 109.
PRESIDENT JOHNSON ordered with
drawal of U.S. dependents from South
Viet Nam and dispatched a Hawk mis
sille anti-aircraft battalion to the scene.
North Viet Nam claimed that four U.S.
planes had been shot down, but Secre
tary McNamara, in a press conference,
said that only one was lost. He identified
the plane as an A4D Skyhawk bomber,
and said the pilot had bailed out.
SOVIET PREMIER Alexei N. Kosy
gin was in Hanoi when the attacks were

made far to the South. Eight hours be
fore, he made a policy statement claim
ing that the U.S.S.R. "will not remain
indifferent" to any "acts of war" against
North Viet Nam.
An earlier retaliatory attack occurred
last August in response to patrol-boat at
tacks upon U.S. destroyers in the Gulf of
Tonkins. U.S. carrier planes replied with
the destruction of torpedo boat bases
and of an oil dump.
FOUR STANFORD professors when
questioned about the attacks, all c o n
curred that they saw no departure from
present policy. Claude A. Buss, professor
of history, believes that Secretary Mc-
Namara's statement honestly articulates
the U.S. position. ..
In a press conference, McNamara said,
"I think this is quite clear that this was
a test of the will, a clear challenge of the
political purpose of both the United
States and South Vietnamese govern
ments.
"It was a test and a challenge to which

neither the South Vietnamese govern
ment nor tiie United States government
could fail to respond without mislead
ing the North Vietnamese as to our in

carry out that intent."
