# Committee Examines Judicial Controversy
## Inquiry Focuses On Luncheon Talk 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
Prof. Gerald Gunther of the
Law School, chairman of t li e
Academic Council's three-man
investigatory committee, said
last night that his group has
already talked to most of the
witnesses of last spring's conver
sation between Dean of Women
Lueile Allen and the Women's
Council regarding the Depart
ment of English.
"We are not as yet finished
with l he fact-gathering"/' he said.
"We hope to be through very
short ly."
PROF. KENNETH ARROW
of the Economics Department
told The Daily that no clear con
sensus of the facts was yet ap
parent. "The more we interview,
the more conflicts there are," he
said. "We are trying to ascertain
to the best of our knowledge
whose memory is better."
According to Arrow, the scope
of the committee's investigation
has enlarged since the interview
ing began. The main focus still
centers on Dean Allen's luncheon
discussion with Women's Coun
cil, but the three-man committee
is also investigating other inci
dents related to the report.
During the weekend Dean Al
len elaborated on her initial state
ment as to the accuracy of the
Crow Halverson account.
A BY-LINED ARTICLE in
Saturday's Examiner quoted her
as saying, "1 can't imagine where
they got this—except perhaps it
was at a Women's Council meet
ing nine months ago. One of the
members said she objected to
some theme subjects given fresh
man girls.
"I told her, 'If you will verify
this, I'll be glad to talk to the
chairman of the English Depart
ment about it.' That was the
last I heard of it. . .
"Really and truly and on my
honor, that report was out of
thin air."
