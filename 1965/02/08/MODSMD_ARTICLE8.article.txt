EDITOR'S NOTE: The following is an interpretation of
the above resolution by Ed Shaw, Speaker of the Legislature.
"If we say the University is run in three separate spheres,
state law, University policy, and ASSU policy, and assuming
that ASSU policy does not break from state law, then we can
assume that the 'we assert' clause means that in cases where
ASSU policy and University policy are in conflict, ASSU policy
would take precedence.
"It doesn't say we won't enforce University policy. Right now
stated ASSU policy and stated University policy agree except
on liquor."
(The so-called "liquor referendum" referred to by Shaw was
passed by the Legislature in 1962. It reads, "The possession,
transportation, or use of intoxicating liquors by Stanford stu
dents in the University community shall be in accordance with
California State Law.")
