## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
The San Francisco Ballet will J
I present two new works in its pro- j
1 gram at Memorial Auditorium at
| S:3O tonight.
"Octet" uses eight dancers
four male and four female—in
a ballet set to Stravinsky's music j
that choreographer William Chris
' tensen says "wryly comments on
I modern conformity."
THE OTHER new ballet, which
has a libretto by columnist Herb
Caen, is titled "Pop Art." Using
the music of American composer
Charles Ives, it depicts the four
ages of man in contemporary j
American society.
"Pop Art" has sets and cos
tumes by San Francisco artist Cal I
Anderson, and is choreographed
by the company's director and
principal choreographer Lew
Christenscn.
Also on the program will be
"Sinfonia" and "Divertissement I
d'Auber," which was also per- j
formed when the Ballet appeared
• on campus in 1962.
THE COMPANY, founded in
1933, is considered along with ,
New York City Ballet of George I
Balanchine to be not only an [
j excellent ballet company but also'
one of the prime causes in the
increased interest in American
ballet.

They have, in recent years,
toured South America, Asia, the
Middle East and Africa on State
Department tours.
Tickets for tonight's perform
ance, priced from $2 to $4, are on
sale at. the Tresidder Ticket Office.
