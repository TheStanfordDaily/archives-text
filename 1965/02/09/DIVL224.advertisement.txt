CHRISTIANITY: I
DEFENDER OF THE STATUS QUO?
It is sometimes claimed that Christians are so otherworldly that they
are no earthly good. Christianity is supposed to emphasize the life after death
at the expense of the life here and now. Thus Christianity is often pictured
as a handy device welcomed by the rich and powerful to maintain the status
quo.
It is claimed that men forced by the rich and powerful to live in poverty
and deprivation are told by Christianity not to be concerned with their earthly
lot, but to be willing to be content with little money, bad homes, poor food,
shabby clothing, insufficient education, social prejudice, all in the hope of
pie in the sky bye and bye. This is the caricature of Christianity which Com
munism feeds upon, and insofar as it represents a prostitution of Christianity,
rightly so.
This picture of Christianity is in flat contradiction to the life and teachings
of Jesus Christ and of His apostles as they wrote of them in the Bible. When
Christ called men not to be anxious for the necessities of this life but to seek
first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, He was not setting the value
of a heavenly kingdom in the future over against the needs of this present
life. He was issuing a call to His followers, in all that they did, to live consistently
with the rule of God over their lives, and to seek to express through their
lives the righteousness of God Himself.
One of the great results of -oming to God through Jesus Christ is a
vital social consciousness. The Golden Rule is a principle for social relations.
It is true that the basic responsibility of the church is to lead men to Jesus
Christ, but this responsibility cannot be met if each individual Christian is not
fundamentally concerned about the needs of the whole man and of the
society in which he lives.
The Christian is called to be concerned not only with that religious element
which runs through our civilization, but with the basic application of Christ
anity and the relevancy of Jesus Christ to that civilization in its entirety. In no
other way can the Christian live up to the call of Jesus Christ to be a light
to the world and a salt of the earth.
Social concern is shared in common between Christianity and humanism.
But whereas humanism can find no higher source or goal than man himself,
Christianity finds the source of its strength and the goal of its labors in the
] God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Social needs were met by Jesus Christ
with a perfection not matched before or after by any other man or organization
of men. Is not knowing Hiin the place to start? Think about it.

and deprivation are told by Christianity not to be concerned with their earthly
lot, but to be willing to be content with little money, bad homes, poor food,
shabby clothing, insufficient education, social prejudice, all in the hope of
pie in the sky bye and bye. This is the caricature of Christianity which Com
munism feeds upon, and insofar as it represents a prostitution of Christianity,
rightly so.
This picture of Christianity is in flat contradiction to the life and teachings
of Jesus Christ and of His apostles as they wrote of them in the Bible. When
Christ called men not to be anxious for the necessities of this life but to seek
first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, He was not setting the value
of a heavenly kingdom in the future over against the needs of this present
life. He was issuing a call to His followers, in all that they did, to live consistently
with the rule of God over their lives, and to seek to express through their
lives the righteousness of God Himself.
One of the great results of -oming to God through Jesus Christ is a
vital social consciousness. The Golden Rule is a principle for social relations.
It is true that the basic responsibility of the church is to lead men to Jesus
Christ, but this responsibility cannot be met if each individual Christian is not
fundamentally concerned about the needs of the whole man and of the
society in which he lives.
The Christian is called to be concerned not only with that religious element
which runs through our civilization, but with the basic application of Christ
anity and the relevancy of Jesus Christ to that civilization in its entirety. In no
other way can the Christian live up to the call of Jesus Christ to be a light
to the world and a salt of the earth.
Social concern is shared in common between Christianity and humanism.
But whereas humanism can find no higher source or goal than man himself,
Christianity finds the source of its strength and the goal of its labors in the
] God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Social needs were met by Jesus Christ
with a perfection not matched before or after by any other man or organization
of men. Is not knowing Hiin the place to start? Think about it.

CHRISTIANITY: I
DEFENDER OF THE STATUS QUO?
It is sometimes claimed that Christians are so otherworldly that they
are no earthly good. Christianity is supposed to emphasize the life after death
at the expense of the life here and now. Thus Christianity is often pictured
as a handy device welcomed by the rich and powerful to maintain the status
quo.
It is claimed that men forced by the rich and powerful to live in poverty
and deprivation are told by Christianity not to be concerned with their earthly
lot, but to be willing to be content with little money, bad homes, poor food,
shabby clothing, insufficient education, social prejudice, all in the hope of
pie in the sky bye and bye. This is the caricature of Christianity which Com
munism feeds upon, and insofar as it represents a prostitution of Christianity,
rightly so.
