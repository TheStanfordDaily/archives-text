• l*lane Crash Kills 84
NEW YORK — An Eastern Air Lines pro
peller-driven airliner exploded and plunged
like a fiery comet into the Atlantic Ocean last
night minutes after takeoff from Kennedy
Ail-port. All 84 persons aboard vanished in
the icy waters of the dark sea.
A mass of orange flames formed a funeral
pyre as the four-engine DC7B disappeared,
leaving only an oil slick as an immediate mark
of disaster off Long Island's south shore. The
plane blew up at about 3,500 feet.
No survivors were found. And it was three
hours after the crash before surface rescue
ships picked up the first bits of wreckage —
some cushions and plastic bags from the ill
fated aircraft.

House conferees to a Senate-House conference

the strict ban voted by the House Jan. 26 by
a 204-177 margin.
This leaves the House conferees free to
accept a Senate modification of the ban, which
Johnson supports since it would not tie his
hands. The Senate voted last week to give the
President discretion to complete a three-year
agreement for the shipments if he deems this
in the national interest.

NEW YORK — An Eastern Air Lines pro

the icy waters of the dark sea.
A mass of orange flames formed a funeral

leaving only an oil slick as an immediate mark
of disaster off Long Island's south shore. The
