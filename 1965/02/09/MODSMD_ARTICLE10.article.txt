## Pike Criticizes Far Right 
### BOB EGELKO 
The radical right mind Millers from "mass paranoia, Bishop
James A. Pike told a Tresidder audience yesterday.
"Nevertheless, there is something appealing about the simple
j answers they offer, as in the case of Proposition I I, where the fie
! titious doctrine of 'absolute property rights' won over a majority of

| the voters,"the Episcopal Bishop
of California, a former attorney
land a virgorous anti-14 cam-
I paigner, declared.
UK WAS appearing under the
i sponsorship of the S 1 a n 112 or d
| Young Democrats.
Pike characterized far-right doc
trines as "simplistic; they're un
jwilling to face a reality that
might he complex or ambiguous.
In their rigidity and tendency to
reduce all complex questions
down to one 'simple' solution they
! resemble the radical left."
To illustrate his theme, Pi k c
i described a turbulent recent trip
[to ultra-conservative southeast
j Texas.
"TllK KIND ot mentality 1 en
countered," declared the Okla
homa-born prelate, "is one you
j wouldn't be aware existed, unless
you come from Orange County.
They're against public schools.
They censor textbooks school
children don't even know that the
UN and UNESCO exist, and eco
nomics texts contain no refer
ences to Marxist theories.
"The people of the Brownsville
and Corpus Christ 1 areas stand
! firm in their conviction that any-
J thing to the left of President Me
j Kinley is suspect. Race relation
| ships, mental health, fluoridation
â€” they're all part oJ the Plot."
j "The legislators are becoming
o\ .<[ i\ cautions about liberal nioa

sures," ho said, "for they fc c 1
that the people might not be with
them. As long as it can wield
this sort of influence, the radical
right will have a future in this
country."
