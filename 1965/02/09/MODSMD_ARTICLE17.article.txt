# CARDS WIN 34-3
## Ruggers Rout San Diego 
### TOM EDISON 
Complete demoralization, how
ever, without perfection was how
coach Pete Kmelovic summed up
the performance of Stanford's
rugby team Saturday after they
had humiliated defending South

ern California champions S a n
Diego State, 34-3.
The Indian charges were led
by the defensive daring of John
Faber and offensive antics of
Dick Ragsdale, Boh Blunt, and
Dan Terpack. Ragsdale scored 14
points.
The Indians were more th a n
equipped, both with size and
speed, to meet the onslaught of
(he invaders from the south. The
brief skirmish, lacking any com
parison to a major battle, was
waged predominately: in San
Diego territory.
The brief maneuvers of the op
position were successfully warded
off by the Tribe whose current
campaign has netted four victims
all for ihe sake of "tuning-up"
for next week's conference opener
against USC.
After several determined ef
forts to score that fell short, Stan
ford scored its first goal on a
short run by Steve Pursell. This
score had been set up by a 25-
yard run by Hank McQueen.
The second score came shortly
thereafter on a beautiful take and
pass from Ragsdale to wing Bob
Blunt who stepped over for the

score. Another try by Blunt and
one by Faber, and J. D. Lodato
rounded out the scoring in the!
first half.
The second half play was high
lighted by several brilliant in- 1
dividual efforts but Stanford's
play on the whole was ragged. !
Passes went astray and tackles
were half-hearted.
Second period play did begin,
however, with an outstanding
jaunt by Ragsdale who ran
through five defenders on a loose
ruck for 3 points. Ragsdale added
seven more points in the second
half, three on a try which was
set up by an excellent fake by
Terpack and four by two conver
sions.
Boh Blunt using his speed to his
advantage throughout the contest!
made another try on a 15-yard
run.
San Diego's only score was on
a free kick. Previous to this boot j
San Diego had just barely missed j
a 30-yarder that hit the up-right 1
and bounced away.
Coach Kmelovic commented
that he thought that they had let
up in the second half and "played
like a soccer team."
