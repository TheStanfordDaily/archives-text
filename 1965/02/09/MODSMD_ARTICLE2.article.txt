# FCC Arrives On Campus
## 
### 
A Freshman Coordinating
Committee (FCC), an ad hoc
group, lias been formed re
cently to deal with the cur
rent controversy over the
judicial process at Stanford.
The purpose of the organi
zation, according to Jerry
Biedernian, a prune mover in
the group, is "to provide all
freshmen with information"
regarding the controversy
ami "to give them a chance
to take part in any action"
that might have to be taken.
Members of the organiza
tion, inspired by bull sessions
in Junipero house and led by
two residents there — M e I
lvnox and Biedermau — are
concerned with basic issues
regarding Stanford's position
as a university, but the com
mittee itself has been formed
to deal specifically with the
problems of rights of Stan
ford students and the judicial
process.
< Biedernian commented. "In
the past the University has
shelved controversial ques
tions until student apathy has
set in. It is the intent and
purpose of this committee to
maintain freshmen interest
until full and complete action
has been taken."
Those interested are in
vited to attend a discussion
Wednesday at 5 p.m. in the
Junipero lounge. Darrell If a 1-
verson, one of the authors of
the Judicial Report which
sparked the current contro
versy, will speak at the meet
ing.
The only link between the
Freshmen Coordinating Com
mittee and the Graduate Co
ordinating Committee, said
Biedernian, "is one of name."
