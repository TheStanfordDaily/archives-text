## University Urged To Clarify Stand On Academic Freedom 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The fol
lowing letter was originally
sent to Dean ol' Undergraduate
Education Robert Wert by As
sociate Professor of Chemistry
Frank E. Harris. Harris .sub
mitted a copy of the letter to
The Daily for publication.
Dear Dean Wert:
As you know, the recent stu
dent report on Student Judiciary-
Administration relations and the
subsequent statements by Deans
Winbigler and Allen have received
widespread publicity both within
and beyond the University com
munity. I believe that the issues
which have been raised are im
portant, and for this reason I
am writing to urge that the Uni
versity take a clear and timely
public stand upon them.
In my view, the main issue is
not the right of the Dean's Office
to guide and control (to some ex
tent) student conduct, but rather
the alleged assertion that a Stu
dent Dean's responsibilities in
clude the monitoring of subject
matter in academic courses. The
faculty of this university cover a
b r o a d spectrum of political,
moral, and relgious views, and
one of the main benefits of a
university education is the stu
dent's exposure to these diverse
viewpoints, as disturbing as this
may be to a Dean of Women, or
even to some of our students'
parents. The administration of a
great university jealously guards
the freedom of its faculty mem
bers to take unpopular, unconven
tional, and even occasionally ill
advised points of view. I do not
believe we should remain quiet
while the Stanford Administra
tion is accused of attacking this
freedom.
I therefore call upon you to
make clear that Stanford indeed
respects this academic freedom,
not by merely saying so, but by
ensuring that the Dean of Stu
dents' Office acts accordingly.
This, in turn, necessitates a reali
zation in the Dean of Students'
Office that the views of faculty
members (both in and out of :
class) are just none of their busi- j
ness. That such a realization ex- \
ists is not evident from the state-•

ments emanating from that office.
Moreover, if it is found after care
ful investigation that Dean Allen
has attempted to use her position
I to influence the content of any
I course, I. for one, would feel that
i the interests of academic freedom
! would be served only by her re
i moval. But, whatever the facts, it
lis important that they be deter
! mined, be publicly revealed, and
be appropriately and fort brightly
| acted upon.
I think it important that mem
| hers of the faculty take a strong
! public stand on this matter, and
II am therefore sending a copy
of this letter to the Stanford
Daily.

• Bloc Controls LASSU
Editor, The Daily:
It has now become evident that {
the duly-elected, official repre
sentative organization of the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University, commonly known as 1
LASSU, has fallen into the hands J
of the recently-elected 'bloc' of 1
graduate students. Last Thursday
evening, this group voting to
gether was able to end all debate
before it began (thereby eliminat
ing genuine efforts at discus
sion), to put down reasonable
motions aimed at a more thor-1
ough analysis of the situation,
and lastly to pass a preposterous
resolution....
It is clear that the LASSU reso
lution is "unconstitutional." Fur
ther, keeping in mind that Stan
ford is a private university, au
thorities always retain t ho final
right to control student affairs
and conduct to any degree they
deem to be proper. This concept j
is inherent to the notion of a pri
vate university. If Stanford did
not operate according to such a
principle, it would be a state uni
versity, supported by state funds,
and the students would not be
paying $1,500 a year for tuition.;
If any particular student does not
like the University's regulations j
on student affairs and conduct, it j
is his right and responsibility to
inquire about the .justice or legal-1
ity of the rule. If he is not satis
fied. he may withdraw from the j
institution.
The so-called "Graduate Co- i
ordinating Committee," sup-1
posedly seeking "to either crea- j
tivcly examine the social situation
or lead to social change," is
nothing but a group of emotional
charlatans, crying about 'horrible i
past abuses,' and suffering from
a psychological malady of "there ;
is nothing better to do."
The net result of Thursday eve
ning's activities is that LASSU j
has lost any respect from admin-'

I istration, faculty, and students it
may have previously enjoyed.
To the undergraduate members
of LASSU, therefore, I issue a
"call to arms"—to logically ana
lyze the situation before you, to
consult your constituencies, to
generate interest and discussion
among students and to make rea
sonable and responsible decisions.
To the students of Stanford Uni-
I versity I ask if you truly want to
be included in that rebellious rab
ble gathered outside of President
Sterling's office, shouting "We
| assert that we have the sole jur
-1 isdiction over student affairs and
j conduct!" If not, now is time to
I say so.
A united responsible effort by
! the enlightened forces of reason
' able students can and will elimi
j nate the distinct possibility of an
other FSM mess at Stanford. But
! this can be accomplished on 1 y
'through immediate action. The
j "time is night."

• Aii End to Rumors
Editor, The Daily:
I am most grateful that the
issues presented in the "Report on
Student Judiciary-Administration
Relations" have finally been
brought to light in a public state
ment. To my knowledge, "rumors"
1 have been circulating on the cam
pus for the past two years con
cerning these matters; it is only
j fair and ethical to raise them
from such a sub-rosa level to a
definite statement.
Personally, I am sorry that the
article had to deal with the per
sonalities of our present admin
istrators. However, one cannot
present any kind of case without
; "evidence." In other words, one
cannot deal in generalities: one
[cannot speak of "judicial proc
esses" or "academic freedom" and
expect to evoke any discussion or
response without a"ease in point."
Frankly, I am not concerned with
the validity of the "evidence."
The important point to remem
ber is that the issue at hand is
not one of individuals or of "true"
or "false." The point is that cer
tain issues have been raised; i.e.,
who is in charge of judicial and
disciplinary action? Is a student:
judicial council responsible to <or|
controlled by) the administra
tion? Are we, as students, cap
able of governing ourselves and j
do we have that right?
And T feel that there is only
one honest answer to these ques
tions. According to democratic
procedure, administrative, judi
cial and legislative bodies are dis
tinct and separate. Furthermore,
one person or body cannot be, at
one and the same time, prosecu
tor, judge and jury. What we

must clo now is to clarify these
distinctions on the university
: level: all three operations cannot
| and must not l>e in the hands of
1 any one body.
In conclusion, I would like to
say thai I have hopes for
| the first time in my "Stanford
career"- that the student body
can and will assume an indepen
dent role in judicial and legisla
tive matters. My appeal is to ihe
students of this university an
appeal for involvement and com-.
I mittment. It does matter!

• ISO Personal Attack
Editor, The Daily:
Your Friday editorial is ex
actly right. There can be no over
stating that the Crow-Halverson
report represents the Dean of
Women as acting in her public
role. "Personal attack" is out of
the question.
For their report, Miss Crow
and Mi-. Halverson deserve t hanks
! and admiration. And it needed to
he made public: a picture of ad
ministrative power in a way that
can mean only wreckage for edu
cation. The growth that educa
tion aims at takes place within
a dialogue not easily sustained,
and the participants, teacher and
student alike, cannot possibly
I carry on with the sense of being
I spied upon. Students, who are
I said to have agreed wi,th the
i Dean's alleged proposal, risked
wrecking their own educations.
They allowed themselves to be
persuaded that they and their fel
low students are hopelessly im- j
mature and incapable of growth.;
Certainly they know better, if;
only for their own sakes, but
more certainly they should never I
have been presented with such a I
proposal, least of all with the;
persuasive force inherent in ad-;
ministrative power.
The wonder is how much of the :
iceberg remains obscured in the
fog of circumlocution — never!
mind how much still rides be- j
neath the surface.

• Publication Unwise
Editor, The Daily:
The publication of the report of i
the Judicial councils seems to me I
to have been an unwise—and un-1
fair—move. The report was writ
ten to be read and considered by
a group of people whose knowl
edge of this university is much
deeper than that of the uninitiated
student, and who could presum
| ably balance the negative side
i presented with an awareness of
| the positive elements of Univer-
I sity administration. The goal of!
| this kind of report is or should
! be—an improvement of the status
j quo; thus obviously the points
raised would be negative ones—
the aspects in need of improve
ment. To present these to an
aware student government and to
the Administration is one thing;
to present, however, to the general
student body a one-sided picture,
knowing that they have no access

to the other side, is not entirely
honest. And if, as Nora and Dar
rell say, the University has al
ready started positive action,
then such a publication as theirs
can only arouse animosity and a
{subsequent block in student-ad
ministration communications, es
j pecially as the poor taste ex
hibited in the report's selection of
(quotations and examples is too
! flagrant to need comment.
Is this stalemate, then, our goal?
Tf not, Nora and Darrell seem to
be sadly lacking in human under-
I standing, not to mention in games
manship!

• Inform Community
Editor, The Daily:
We, the undersigned, would
! like to express our support of the
Judicial Council Report and
; commend th e prompt action
| which the Academic Council has
| taken. In view of the concern
j which the faculty has shown, we
! feel this problem can be solved
without the destructive incidents
which occurred at Cal. One way
in which such incidents can be
prevented is by informing the Uni
versity community of the facts as
determined by the investigatory
Committee of the Academic Coun
cil.
