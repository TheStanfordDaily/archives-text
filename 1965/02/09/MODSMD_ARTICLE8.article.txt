# Dirty Rush At The Teke House
## 
### KITTY GALORE 
The newest and shortest-lived fraternity
in the history of Stanford appeared on cam
pus last night. Tau Kappa Epsilon, the Teke
house, staged a one-night stand, roared
through dirty rush and pledged two mem
bers.
It was enough to immortalize the Teke's
as the fastest talking jocks in the row.
ANT) AS FOB the Tiki goddesses who
played hostessâ€”well you'll never see their
likes at Branner.
What the situation boils down to is the
traditional eating club RF on the first night
of fraternity rush. An eating club talks one
of the women's low houses into loaning

out its premises for the night and furnish
ing the downstairs in "early fraternity."
They erect huge Greek letters on the front
door, turn on the stereo, and see how many
gullible frosh males they can draw inside.
This year the "L" asked Guthrie to be
its partner in perfidy.
THE MALES spent yesterday afternoon
hiding Guthrie's bike rack, concocting a
common spiel, and hastily memorizing the
floor plan.
Back last night after dinner, they did
a double take as the Guthrie Girls emerged
in their promised attire: low-cut black
dresses, spike heels and three layers of eye
goop.
The Teke's were in business.
OF COURSE, a few crises arose.

Why did all the Teke rooms have white
ruffled curtains?
Why did a caller suddenly burst in the
front door and yell up for a dame?
Where was the men's room? (This last
inquiry was settled by directions to the
ATO house across the street.)
BUT, by shoving the curious into sepa
rate corners and bidding them faster than
they could talk, the Teke's swept through
the evening in glorious style.
On this morning after, the "L" has set
tled back to gloat and the Guthrie Girls arc
still te-hee-ing among themselves.
However, the Guthrie RA wants to know
what she's supposed to do with all the frosh
who got invited back tomorrow night for an
upstairs tour of the house.
