# CROW-HALVERSON REPORT
## Obstacles To Publication 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor (Second in a Series 
I
Nora Crow and Darrell Halverson ran into vari
ous obstacles in their efforts to have their report
on the student judicial system and the Stanford
deanery brought to the attention of the University
| community.
After deciding not to wait until Spring Quar
ter to publish their report in the Sequoia they dis
cussed their situation with Bob Rosen, co-editor of
a forthcoming student magazine, the Challenger.
ROSEN WAS RECEPTIVE to the report, and
told Halverson and Miss Crow that ho would be
willing to publish it in the first issue of the gradu
ate-produced journal if they so wished. But, Hal
verson emphasized in a Daily interview, "he made
i it very clear that whatever choice we made, il was
to be in our best interests."
Rosen told The Daily yesterday that a( the
time, "My feeling was that there didn't seem to be
1 other channels through which the report could bo
1 expressed." He invited publication of the article,
he said, because it would tic in with the magazine's
' purpose, that of being a forum for political and
j social discussion.
In the meanwhile, on January 27, Daily Editor
| Nancy Steffen learned of the situation. She mei
I that evening with Halverson and Miss Crow, and it
was tenatively agreed that The Daily would pub
lish a review of the report on the day of its re
lease in the Challenger, then scheduled to go on
! sale Tuesday of last week.
I P THROUGH THIS TIME, the eo-authors ol
; the documents had resisted thoughts of channeling
I their report through an branch of ASSU. espe
j dally the Legislature, because, according lo Ilalver
i son. "We did not want one specific segment of the
Stanford community to bear the entire burden of
addressing the issues the document contained.
Further, we wished to maintain personal control
over its means and time of publication."

control of the situation began to slip out of their
hands,
Ed Shaw, Speaker of LASSU, and at that time
chairman of Publications Board, attended a party
following the Daily banquet of that evening where
he first heard rumors of the impending publica
tion of the report. He left Ihe party early Sunday
morning, and by sunrise had learned, through a
source or sources he refuses to disclose, of the
document's contents.
Sunday morning Shaw wrote a letter as LASSU
Speaker to Halverson, asking him for an account
of his "reflections and experiences" as a foimer
member of the judiciary. It read, in part:
"IT IS 3IY understanding that you have
reached certain conclusions which would be of
extreme interest to the Legislature and I would
ask that you prepare this in the form of a report
to be delivered to the body as soon as possible."
Halverson and Miss Crow assented to Shaw's
request to bring the report lo LASSU because, in
Ilalvcrson's words, "We felt that every student had
a stake in it."
The two were also worried about the possibility
ol a libel suit. Although a member of the law
school faculty had already told them that he con
sidered the report nonlibelous, the report's au
thors decided they might be safer under the pro
tection of LASSU.
AND SO, Sunday afternoon, Rosen's invitation
Id publish in the Challenger was declined, and it
was agreed that the report would be presented at
the regularly scheduled meeting of LASSU Feb
ruary 11.

following the Daily banquet of that evening where
he first heard rumors of the impending publica

morning, and by sunrise had learned, through a
source or sources he refuses to disclose, of the
document's contents.
Sunday morning Shaw wrote a letter as LASSU
Speaker to Halverson, asking him for an account
of his "reflections and experiences" as a foimer
member of the judiciary. It read, in part:
"IT IS 3IY understanding that you have
reached certain conclusions which would be of
extreme interest to the Legislature and I would
ask that you prepare this in the form of a report
to be delivered to the body as soon as possible."
Halverson and Miss Crow assented to Shaw's
request to bring the report lo LASSU because, in
Ilalvcrson's words, "We felt that every student had
a stake in it."
The two were also worried about the possibility
ol a libel suit. Although a member of the law
school faculty had already told them that he con
sidered the report nonlibelous, the report's au
thors decided they might be safer under the pro
tection of LASSU.

ROSEN WAS RECEPTIVE to the report, and
told Halverson and Miss Crow that ho would be
willing to publish it in the first issue of the gradu
ate-produced journal if they so wished. But, Hal
verson emphasized in a Daily interview, "he made

Rosen told The Daily yesterday that a( the
