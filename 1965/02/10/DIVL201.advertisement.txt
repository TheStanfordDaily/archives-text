The Disappearing
God of the Gaps
It sounds sophisticated to argue that man's idea of God arose back in i
the early days of history as an effort to provide an explanation for those
things which were not understood. In the early years those areas not explainable
by natural means far exceeded those which man could explain; evidence for
God was found everywhere. If lightning flashed, it was God signalling; if
thunder roared, it was God speaking. When an mcame to understand the |
natural phenomena responsible for lightning and thunder, God was silenced. 1
Today, scientific advances seem to have placed the control of the world so
completely in the hands of men, that the hypothesis of God is hardly relevant
and longer.
It has been natural for man to attribute to God all the unknown and un
explanable phenomena of man's experience But this tendency has led in a
| related fashion to the exclusion of God as the cause of the known phenomena j ,
I in man's experience. Thus, the belief has developed that God is manifest and j
"proved'' only by the miraculous, the obviously supernatural, that which
j defies natural explanation. As time passes and knowledge increases, the i
number of phenomena which defy natural explanation decreases Thus, there '
is a tendency to push the relevancc of God and His activity into ever decreasing j
orbs of influence, to confine God to the gaps of ignorance. As we find out more
about the Creation, we are inclined to sec less and less evidence of the
Creator.
The Bible clears up this whole confusion. There, the work of God's
imminence in all of creation is everywhere emphasized along with God s
transcendence. God does not appear in history only, or even primarily, in [
those events which we term miracles, but God manifests Himself and His 1
power in every detail of the natural course of history. It is because God is !
there that it is natural.
We need not hesitate to confess that this particular problem has often
been aggravated by the official position of Christian ecclesiastics. Too many
times the "official ' Church has insisted that some specific intrepretation of a
Bible passage be held as scientific fact until long after a conscientious and
informed Christian would agree. Finally the Church also has reached the j
point where it was compelled to back down and admit that its interpretation 1
was incorrect. But the world does not discriminate on the niceties of inter
pretation and truth, and too often concludes that scientific advances have
once again removed another superstitious dogma from the ecclesiastical credo.
The reality of God is grasped in no other way so intimately as by coming
to know the person of Jesus Christ. Christ says that anyone who had seen j
Him through the eyes of faith, had seen God the Father, the Creater and
Sustainer of the universe— I and the Father are one'' (Matthew 10:30).— j

The Disappearing
God of the Gaps
It sounds sophisticated to argue that man's idea of God arose back in i
the early days of history as an effort to provide an explanation for those
things which were not understood. In the early years those areas not explainable
by natural means far exceeded those which man could explain; evidence for
God was found everywhere. If lightning flashed, it was God signalling; if
thunder roared, it was God speaking. When an mcame to understand the |
natural phenomena responsible for lightning and thunder, God was silenced. 1
Today, scientific advances seem to have placed the control of the world so
completely in the hands of men, that the hypothesis of God is hardly relevant
and longer.
It has been natural for man to attribute to God all the unknown and un
explanable phenomena of man's experience But this tendency has led in a
| related fashion to the exclusion of God as the cause of the known phenomena j ,
I in man's experience. Thus, the belief has developed that God is manifest and j
"proved'' only by the miraculous, the obviously supernatural, that which
j defies natural explanation. As time passes and knowledge increases, the i
number of phenomena which defy natural explanation decreases Thus, there '
is a tendency to push the relevancc of God and His activity into ever decreasing j
orbs of influence, to confine God to the gaps of ignorance. As we find out more
about the Creation, we are inclined to sec less and less evidence of the
Creator.
The Bible clears up this whole confusion. There, the work of God's
imminence in all of creation is everywhere emphasized along with God s
transcendence. God does not appear in history only, or even primarily, in [
those events which we term miracles, but God manifests Himself and His 1
power in every detail of the natural course of history. It is because God is !
there that it is natural.
We need not hesitate to confess that this particular problem has often
been aggravated by the official position of Christian ecclesiastics. Too many
times the "official ' Church has insisted that some specific intrepretation of a
Bible passage be held as scientific fact until long after a conscientious and
informed Christian would agree. Finally the Church also has reached the j
point where it was compelled to back down and admit that its interpretation 1
was incorrect. But the world does not discriminate on the niceties of inter
pretation and truth, and too often concludes that scientific advances have
once again removed another superstitious dogma from the ecclesiastical credo.
The reality of God is grasped in no other way so intimately as by coming
to know the person of Jesus Christ. Christ says that anyone who had seen j
Him through the eyes of faith, had seen God the Father, the Creater and
Sustainer of the universe— I and the Father are one'' (Matthew 10:30).— j
