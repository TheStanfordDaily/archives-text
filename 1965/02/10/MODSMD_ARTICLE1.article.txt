# Crow-Halverson: The Tumult And The Shouting
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor (Last in a Series 
After deciding on January 31 to channel
their report on judicial-administration rela
tionships through LASSU, Nora Crow and
Darrell Halverson endeavored to discuss the
matter with members of the Stanford admin
istration.
That afternoon the two went to see Vice
President for Finance Kenneth M. Cuthbert
son at his home. "We specifically chose Cuth
bertson," Halverson later told The Dally, "be
cause his duties were not in the area of our
report,"
CUTHBKRTSON CAUTIONED the two
against publishing the document, and advised
them to see Vice Provost and Dean of Under
graduate Education Robert J. Wert.
The next morning, Monday, the two met
with Wert in his office. He, too, cautioned them
against publishing, and suggested that they
see Dean of Women Lueile Allen, who was
heavily criticized in the report.
A few hours later they met with Dean
Allen and Assistant Dean of Women Elizabeth
Avery. Neither had previously read the report,
although Dean Allen, according to Halverson,

commented, "Some of my friends have read
it."
THIS COMMENT presumably referred to
a faculty source through which the adminis
tration had first heard of the report's exist
ence.
Dean Allen, said Halverson, called the re
port "destructive," and insisted that the co
authors leave a copy of it with her. Halverson
and Miss Crow refused.
At that point, as the meeting is recon
structed by Halverson, Dean Allen took the
copy of the report, put it in her desk, and
closed the drawer. Halverson pointed out that
it was their personal property, with their
names on it, and that they had come in volun
tarily as a courtesy, and were surprised at her
behavior. Dean Allen relented, and began
reading the text of the report.
WHEN SHE FINISHED, she returned the
document, and Halverson and Miss Crow left.
The following day, Tuesday, President Wal
lace Sterling and Prof. Benjamin Page, chair
man of the Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council, appointed a three-man fact
finding committee to investigate! the charges
made in the Crow-Halverson report. Chosen
were Profs. Kenneth Arrow of the Department
of Economics, Sanford Dornbusch of the De
partment of Sociology, and Gerald Gunther of
the School of Law, chairman.

Dornbusch informed Halverson and Miss
Crow that Sterling would like to talk to them
that morning.
THEY WENT TO the President's Office
and talked to Sterling for seventy minutes,
during which time he expressed his hopes that
the report not be published. "It seemed as
though he were more interested in the impact
that the report would make than he was with
its implications," Halverson stated later. "We
expected a discussion, but it was more like an
inquisition."
By Wednesday, the wheels of the adminis
tration and the faculty had begun to roll rather
quickly, and it began to appear as though
some sort of action on Dean Allen's status
might be taken before the regularly scheduled
LASSU meeting of February II at which the
Crow-Halverson report was to be presented.
However, shortly after dinner that evening,
a manila envelope was slipped under the office
door of LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw. It con
tained a two-page dittoed paraphrase of the
four-page affidavit on the luncheon discussion
with Dean Allen.
ALSO ENCLOSED was an anonymous type
written note that read:
"We arc a group of graduate students inter
ested in this matter and feel that this report
should be published, which you are afraid to do
as might be expected as a member of student

government. We feel that publication might
result in the same type of sludent action that
was so successful at Cal where 'student gov
ernment' failed. This report will be distributed
to the student body."
On the envelope was the notation: "Copies
to the Chronicle and the Examiner." Neither
paper has yet received copies of the dittoed
sheets.
A half hour later, a similar package was
found under the door of Darrell Halverson's
room at Stern Hall, with an unsigned note
that read:
"YOU WILL NO DOUBT recognize parts
of the enclosed writing. This will be released
around campus tomorrow if there is no change
in our plans. We are a group of graduate stu
dent who appreciate your efforts but fear you
have fallen into a program of appeasement
similar to students in student government at
Cal. We cannot let this happen."
A conference in the office of Daily Editor
Nancy Steffen was immediately called. In at
tendence were Miss Steffen, Shaw, Miss Crow,
Halverson. Challenger co-editor Bob Rosen,
several members of the Graduate Coordinat
ing Committee, and a few other involved in
dividuals.
The group unanimously agreed that if the
issues were to be brought to the attention of
the Stanford community in the form of the

two-page paraphrase (which discussed only the
luncheon discussion at which Dean Allen made
her charges of eroticism in the English De
partment), then the resulting "sexual bomb
shell" would obscure the fuller issues deline
ated in the complete Crow-Halverson report.
IT WAS QUICKLY concluded that the "se
cret" had been so widely spread by that time
that it would be impossible to trace the anony
mous notes to any particular individual. (In
fact, one person in attendence who hashes at:
Wilbur Hall l'ccalled overhearing a table of
freshmen discussing some of the issues in
volved over lunch that day.) Thus, there was
no way in which the writers of the threat could
be persuaded to change their minds.
The possibility was discussed of asking the
Student Police to stop any attempted on-cam
pus distribution of the threatened handout
on the grounds that the Publications Board
had not approved it; the idea was discarded
when it was pointed out that any resulting in
cidents might be blown up as abuses of the
freedom of expression.
And so it was decided, late Wednesday
night, that LASSU would be called into spe
cial session the following evening to consider
the report. Shaw released the text of the state
ment to The Daily for publication in its en
tirety in Thursday's edition.
And then the deluge began.
