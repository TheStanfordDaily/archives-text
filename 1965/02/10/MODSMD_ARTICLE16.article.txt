## Sports Is Too Ambivalent, Athletes Incapable Of Moral Indignation 
### Roger Magnuson 
The clickety-clack of sandals
aroused mo from lhe slate of
euphoric let harpy into which 1
had fallen, and 1 glanced up just
in time to see my old friend Irv
ing Grossman laying his battered
green book bag upon my desk.

known as "Superaet ivist!" I the
"X" is, of course, silent), began
the usual retelling of bow his
metamorphosis from a "sulking,
bleedingheart," into "Superaetiv

|ist!" was ill accomplished under
the personable aegis of a five-day
Dale Carnegie course.
And. to be sure, he talked about
how necrophiliaes can't help be
ing what they are and about how
they have a valuable contribution
to make to our society, and about
the need for sensistive coroners,
and related matters. Rut all the
while I could tell bis hemophiliac
heart simply wasn't in it.
Finally, lie looked around fur
tively and cleared his voice.
"I never thought you'd do it,"
he said, adjusting his sandal.
"Do what," 1 said.
"Become a Sports Editor, of
i course. Sports is alien, you know,
lo the democratic process. Also to
■ superaet ivism."
"But not to atavism; is that
your point, Irving?"
-lust Too Ambivalent
"Well, it's just that sports is
so ambivalent," Irving added.
"One minute you almost render
a fellow impotent and then you
i help him up: vou wreak violence

upon him and then you pat him
on the back. Thai doesn't work in
my line," he said.
"Why not?" I asked ingenu
ously.
"Do you realize what would
happen il' were to sing a panegy
ric to George Wallace or help
that Selma County Sheriff get
back up? Or il' I went witch-hunt
ing for neerophiliaes? Why I'd be ;
ostracized from my milieu!"
"It could be bad, all right," i;
agreed.
"The raving pits," ho shrieked.
"Is the ambivalence your major
complaint against Sports and
Sports Editors, Irving?" 1 asked
uncertainly.
"No, not really." he answered,
"the real trouble with athletes
is that I've never seen one who
could really get morally indig
nant. A little angry, maybe, but
never really morally indignant.
Now you better believe 1 didn't
become "Superactivist!" by just
being a little angry."
"1 should say not," I said.
Mora I Indignation
"No, 1, Irving Grossman!, be
came Superactivist! by my bound
less capacity for moral indigna
tion; give me any issue and I'll
hit you with a burst of objurgat
ing righteous anger. It's my spe
cialty," he beamed proudly.
"Sin?" I asked.
"Well almost a nyt hi n g, he
said, his scrofulous face becom
ing temporarily contorted, "any
way athletes, and sportsmen gen
erally, don't have it. They treat,
with a few egregious exceptions,
their opponents as though they
were adroit as themselves. Makes
for bad crusaders," he said.
"Can you imagine treating
Franco as mistaken but basically
j decent?" he said getting up to
leave, "or, for that matter. Bull
Corner?"
"Not in my most sublime mo
ments of euphoric apathy," I said.
"Well, then, I guess there's still
hope for you," he said. "But could
you do men one favor? Try to
make sports a little less competi
tive and just a little more, say,
didactic?" he said.
"I'll see what I can do, Irving
Grossman!" I said. "For super
-1 activism sake."
Ciiant's Task
But 1 recognized at once that
the task would require a veritable
Prometheus. For, after all. .sports
is quintessentially ambivalent,
and competitive.
Regarding the opponent as
probably as worthy as himself,
the athlete is quite incapable of
moral indignation, and is thus
quite an unactivistic creature,
leaving righteous anger to mai
lers of the spirit, not matters of
people or the polite.
In his ambivalence he yet at
tacks, but with his "amour
propre" assuring that his thrust
will always be that of the duel.
And not that of the longshore
man cleaning out a waterfront
saloon.

mocracy, has unfortunately too
often been, as Mencken once ob
served, that of the longshoreman,
