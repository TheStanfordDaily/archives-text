## Leopold Account Challenged 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduate representative to
LASSU who is not a member of !
the GCC and as one who vctcd to I
strike the "We assert" clause
from the resolution passed at last j
Thursday's session, I wish to take \
issue with several points in Mr.'
Leopold's article (Monday's -
Daily) and Mr. Malovos letter!
(Tuesday's Daily).
The special session of LASSU j
last week was not the first time j
that the newly elected graduate
representatives were seated. The j
new members were introduced at j
the previous LASSU meeting and i
several graduate students already j
held seats. In other words, gradu
ate representatives did not sud
denly descend on the Legislature!
last Thursday.
It is also inaccurate to identify |
all the new graduate representa- J
tives with the GCC. A number of i
the new legislators are also GCC i
members, but the 20-29 vote by
the graduates against striking;
hardly supports the contention ;
that the graduates are a GCC rub- j
her stamp. Although the un d e r- i
graduates approved the motion t<»;
strike, the 40-33 vote reveals sig-!
nificant support among the under
graduates for what Mr. Malovos;
implies is a GCC resolution.
It should be recognized, more
over, that the amendment to i
strike the "We assert" clause was ,
introduced by a graduate student '
and that the major opposition to
the clause was led by graduate!
students. Th e undergraduates
were surprisingly reti c en t
throughout the debate.
Regarding the roll call vote. Mr.
Leopold's statement that "one of j
the more suspicious types on the!
GCC moved that substitutes be'
challenged" appears to imply that
the GCC was hoping to swell the!
vote against striking. As I recall, j
however, the "suspicious type"
voted to strike.
Mr. Leopold's final comparison
of LASSU proceedings to the Sun- j
day flicks is particularly unfor-j
tunate. Not only is it an aspersion ,
on legislature members but it |
damningly misrepresents the seri- i
ous debate of the emergency scs-!
sion.
It is disturbing that both arti
cles imply a graduate (read GCC)
take-over of LASSU. The gradu
ate representatives do not consti-j
tutc a majority of the legislature. |
They do not vote as a bloc. They j
cannot pass any measure without
the support of the undergradu
ates. With the important issues of
student rights and academic free-i
dom at stake, it is no time to pro
mote false factionalism.

• Aii Erroneous Notion
Editor, The Daily:
It is an erroneous, though pre
valent nation to equate morality
with sex mores. Victorian sup
pression and Freudian overem
phasize, notwithstanding, sex
plays only a small part in the
whole idea of human ethos. And
that small, albeit important part,
is certainly of a private nature.
Whereas, lying in high office is
most damaging to public moral
ity, yet it is so much taken for
granted and considered part of
the game, that a concern for
truth seems somehow simple
minded and quixotic.
I recommend Montaigne's essay
on the subject: time honored,
good literature, not a bit salaci
ous. The Administration might
try to treat students (and Eng
lish teachers) as responsible
adults, there is a good chance
they will turn out to be just that.

• Unfortunate Reaction
Editor, The Daily:
Two of the letters published in
The Daily of Tuesday, February
9, represent two different but
equally unfortunate kinds of re
action to the challenge of the
Crow-Halverson Report and the
LASSU resolution. . . .
The first attitude, voiced by
Kenneth Malovos, is that impas
sioned clinging to the status quo
which masquerades under phil
osophical-sounding appeals to the
nature of things. . . .
The motivation for this display
of nonsense becomes clear later
in Mr. Malovos's letter when,
after calling the GCC "a group <>112
emotional charlatans" and the
members of LASSU who voted for
the resolution "rebellious rabble,"
he posits as the overriding goal
the elimination of "the distinct
possibility of another FSM mess
at Stanford."
If Mr. Malovos's attitude is
based on a fear of turmoil and
change, that of Margaret St. John
is based on a more respectable
and therefore more seductive and
so finally more dangerous motive:
sympathy, or "human understand
ing," as she calls it. And indeed
it is probably unavoidable to feel
a twinge (pathetic) for "poor
Dean Allen," but it is imperative
that that twinge should not pre
vent us from taking the proper
action to protect students, faculty,
and university if the charges in
the report are substantiated.
Margaret St. John questions
the good taste of Nora Crow and
Darrell Halverson in bringing to

light the circumstances of th is
case. She has, I think, laid her
accusation of poor taste at the
wrong door. In any event, we
should not let the fascinating
character of these charges nor
any suspicions (which must be
very faint by now) that they are
not authentic blind us to the
reality of the threat to the aca
demic community, intolerable
even in potentiality, which the re
port emphasizes. We must be sat
isfied with nothing less than a
full assertion and recognition by
all elements involved, including
the administration, of academic
freedom and student self-jurisdic
tion.

The squeaking wheel gets the

* Unlrustin<£ Materialism
Editor, The Daily:
One response to LASSU's
Thursday night resolution might
be "Why not?"
Why can't a community of 10,-
000 intelligent young adults estab
lish, enforce, and comply with a
legal system of their own mak
ing? The system would, of course,
incorporate all Federal, Califor
nia, and local laws and regulation
applicable to students on campus.
This is no violent upheaval from
the loft, no total break with pub
lic institutions. Nor is it a seces
sion from the Mother university:
the administration would con
tinue to provide the facilities for
the academic experience.
The students of Stanford have
voiced their desire only to have
"sole jurisdiction over student af
fairs and conduct." Responsibil
ity tends to make men more re
sponsible. This university prides
itself in its cultivation of "stu
dent leaders"; does anyone fear
that these same leaders would
abdicate in the face of increased
responsibility?
The students, with appropriate
scientific attitude, want to experi
ment in self-government. Must
their first breath of political life
be smothered under the wing of
well-meaning, but untrUsting, Ma
ternalism?
