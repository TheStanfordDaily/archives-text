# Planning Office Stresses Open Space, Compactness

### HENRY MULLER 
"Stanford is a big jigsaw puz
zle that will take from fifty to
seventy-five more years to put
together," according to Planning
Office Director Harry Sanders.
THE PLANNING OFFICE at
Stanford was established shortly
after the end of World War 11. It
is the first such facility to exist
in any university in the United
States.
Previously, an individual or an
administrative committee would
make decisions regarding con
struction and expansion on cam
pus, as is still done in many insti
tutions.
The result generally is that
these important decisions are
made without foresight.
BUT STANFORD is known for
its foresight. The first example
came when Senator Stanford for
bade thai any part of the 8,800-
acre campus ever be sold. This
has turned out to be one of ihe
most intelligent decisions ever
made, according to Sanders' asso
ciate, Oscar Nelson.
The tact that Stanford has one
of the largest campuses of any
university does not. mean that the
school can continue to spread out
in a haphazard manner, as do
most large cities in this country.
This is win the Planning Office
has established an overall long
range master plan for ihe entire
8,800 acres.
ONE OF Ihe main objectives of
this master plan is to mainlain
the character of open space that
has become typical of the Univer
sity. Kxamples are I In* Wilbur
courtyards and While Memorial
Plaza
On Ihe other hand, a degree of
compactness is necessary, since
the central part of the campus can
only be confined to a certain
space. The office is trying to
reach a mean in which bolh quali
ties will be evident. Il is in older

| to achieve this mean that th e
| courtyard idea has become so
i popular.
| In the Planning Office, which is
: located in Encina Hall, (here is a
scale model of the central part of
\ the campus. Upon looking al this
model, a visitor will be struck
i by Ihe sight of many buildings
[that he has not noticed on cam
< pus.
THE REASON for some, such
as the McCullough Building for
| Engineering and Space Research,
i is that they are not yet completed.
But. there are many buildings
on this model that represent
neither facilities under construc
tion nor those to be built in the
j near future. They represent build
ings that will someday perhaps
in fifteen or twenty years be
built on campus.
These hypothetical buildings
are mostly of simple rectangular
shape and the purpose of putting
them on the model is to see how
they will fit in with Ihe surround
ings. What the planners are con
cerned with is not the appearance

of one of these buildings from an
j architectural point of view, but
i its size, shape, and location.
ONCE THFOY have decided on
j this and the time has come for
the facility to lie erected, then
they give the proper instructions
; to an architect. No designing is
done in the office. It is only a liai
son between the University and
outside architects.
The Planning Office is also re
sponsible for the part of the prop
i crty that is away from the center
jof the campus. It played an im
portant role in the planning of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
j Center fSLACi and of the Jasper
i Ridge Biological Reserve.
But the planners are just as
cautious and foresighted with this
part of the campus. Other univer
sities have to buy land for new
1 facilities. According to Sanders,
"We are fortunate to have all this
I land; but we must learn to value
and respect it."
He predicts that someday every
acre will be used as an integral
part of the University.


LIBRARY COMPLEXâ€”This complex of buildings
on the Planning Office's scale model will even
tually be known as the "Library Quad." To the
far left is the new undergraduate library and
to the right front of Hoover Tower is the Hoover

Expansion soon to be built. The design of the
future buildings is still in doubt. Those in the
photograph are examples of the hypothetical
buildings placed on the model to show what
they woulci look like.
