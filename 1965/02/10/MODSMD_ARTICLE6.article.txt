# TMU Magazine Policy Set By Student Board
## 
### BRUCE BURTON 
Supply and demand were aeeepted as the chief determining
factors for selection of periodicals at the Tresidder Union Store in
a two-hour meeting of the TMU Board last night.
The Board voted four to thrw in favor of a proposal reading
"the Board will consider content ol a periodical only as an argu-

ment for inclusion of a maga
zine in the store racks.
CONTROVERSY over alleged
censorship of magazines at Tresid
der began last November when
"The Realist" was dropped from
the store's stock because it was
allegedly "offensive, of poor qual
ity, and not in demand," according
to Tom Riles, chairman of the
TMU Board.
Debate last night centered
around whether determination of
magazines on sale at the Union
should be based on consumer de
mand or on their content.
The original proposed read that
except for matters of possible
libelous publications the Board
"cannot eliminate evaluation of
publications themselves if a
varied and up-to-date line of pe
ridoicals is to be offered. The
Board recognizes that it is rarely
necessary to consider content in
the evaluation of the periodical."
OBJECTION TO this was voiced

by Robert Pinsky and Mike Soule,
j members of the Graduate Coordi
i 11 a ting Committee's Academic
Freedom Committee, who argued
that selection of periodicals
should be made according to sup
i ply and demand.
The two GCC members, neither
of whom are members of the TMU
Board, argued against the Board's
; right to exclude periodicals on the
! basis of content and said that
1 "the ebb and flow of sales" should
i determine what goes on sale.
â€¢ Also objectionable to Pinsky and
; Soule was a line in the proposal
I saying "specific requests for re
i moval or addition of newspaper
i and magazine titles" would be eon
tsidered by the Board.
THEY SAIl) that the word "spe
cific" would limit consideration
!of complaints to those only of
! members of the University com
j munity.
Chief objection was made, how
ever, to the last sentence of the
' proposed policy. Pinsky and Soule
said that the word "never" should
be subsitutcd for "rarely" in de
fining the Board's power to delcr
j mine magazines on sale at the
} Union.
Pinsky stated that "we don't
j think you should have that right
; at all" to Riles.
The sentence finally was
changed to read that the Board
"will consider the content, of a
i periodical only as an argument
for inclusion."
As the final resolution stands,
however, both Riles and the two
GCC members were pleased. The
Board chairman said that he
thought "the policy will suffice. 1
think its is a good one."
Pinsky stated "the potential
dangerous implications of some
of the language is ameliorated by
the Board's decision to abandon
consideration of content as a cri
terion for excluding a periodical."
