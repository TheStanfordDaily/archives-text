# University Land Use Is Questioned
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
How does Stanford plan to use
its mostly unspoiled foolliill acre
age for academies, research or
for nothing at all?
The question was posed Mon
day night by planning consultant
William Spangle at a joint public
hearing of the San Mateo County
Planning Commission and th e
Portola Valley Town Planning
Commission held in the Portola
Valley School.
SPANGLE, whose firm has pre
pared a master plan for Portola
Valley, declared that "the com
munity has a right to know the
plans of the university so that it
can plan for the surrounding
area" and charged the University
with failure to cooperate.
Up to this point, the Trustees
have refused to designate an y
special usage for the land in ques
tion all of it is in San Mateo
County. Under Spangle's plan, it
would be left open for recrea
tional facilities or house only
some rcse a r c h administrative
offices.
"We think it's a little presump
tuous to plan so specifically as of
now," commented Dave Casto. Di
rector of the University Land and
Developmcn t Program.
CASTO SAIl) Spangle's plan
was praiseworthy in that "il at
tempts to take a rural community
and keep it from being encroached
upon. . . . Unfortunately, the plan
ner has dealt too much with
aesthetics and not enough wit h
economies."
Casio said th a t Spangle's
charges "probably won't change
our minds any."
