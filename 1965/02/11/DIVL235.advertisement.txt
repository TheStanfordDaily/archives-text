the same problem —from the opposite even the score a bit by finding out more

Our Representative will be on your campus shortly with information about positions in
each of these divisions:

Pomona
in NEW YORK — Electronics Division and Stromberg-Carlson in Rochester

Incidentally, our man will have the solution to the puzzle along, just in case you missed it.
