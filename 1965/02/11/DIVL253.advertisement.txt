Christianity:
A Psychological Crutch?
It. is fashionable nowadays to brush off Christianity as a cleverly
contrived version of man's age-old attempts to alleviate his fears by in
vocation of a deity. The argument runs that in the days before the
; advent of science, man quieted his psychological fears by religious
activity, by placating gods made after his own image or the image Of
nature around him. Hut now, with the maturity that man has achieved
as the result of the scientific advances of recent centuries, it is improper
for man to continue to rely upon this crutch. So, man is finally come of
age. l ie has arrived at the point in history where he is truly the master
of his fate and the captain of his soul, lie no longer lias a religious sense
and no longer experiences religious needs. Knowledge has replaced ig
norance. It is unbecoming for man thus matured to continue to hold on
to the rudiments of his evolutionary childhood.
If Christianity were no more than a product of man's attempts to j
alleviate his fears of the unknown, then it might well be agreed that he :
ought eventually to arrive at that state of maturity when be could stand i
on his own two feet in his own strength. Hut, unfortunately for man,
he is embroiled in a dilemma which far transcends his abilities to extri- j
cate himself.
Cultures change and civilizations rise and fall, but there is abundant i
empirical evidence that there continues through all of recorded history, !
and substantially unchanged today, a basic, need at the core of each !
man's lite, liach of us has a sense of losttiess, an insecurity, an inability
to communicate, a fear of personal commitment because of a fear of
personal rejection, a striving for satisfaction, a craving for peace and
acceptance. All <>112 this has one basic root: the unwillingness of man to
yield self-will to higher will. Clod's will. The Hible calls it sin.
As long as man's relationship with (iod is unrestorcd lie cannot
function as a whole man; he cannot be truly free, lie falls victim to all j
the miseries of frustrated human existance. lie cannot fulfil the purpose
for which lie. is on earth. The empirical evidence argues only too plainly
that man's coming of age in a scientific and technological sense has done
little to remove his intrinsic spiritual need. Indeed, it has probably acted
j frequently to aggravate the symptoms.
There is a unique answer to this dilemma of man. ft is knowing
J i Jesus Christ in a personal way, where a man commits (entrusts) his
.whole life to Christ and claims for himself the restoration oi the u
; latioiiship with (rod that Christ has made available for him. This is
' not a psychological crutch. It i> the power of (jod to salvation, think
about it.
