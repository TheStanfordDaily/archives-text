# Economics Versus Aesthetics In Foothill Debate
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
The University has again Im>-
come embroiled in a contro
versy over how it should use
its foothill acreage.
Last year, the Town of
Woodside objected to the in
stallation of overhead power
lines for the Stanford Linear
Accelerator (SI.AC). This year,
Portola Valley is upset because
the University, in Vice Presi
dent Alt' Brandin's words, has
refused to regard its foothill

acreage as "either a pleasure
land or as an endless source of
greenbelt areas and public
parks."
The current conflict is caused
by a master plan prepared for
the Portola Valley Town Plan
ning - Commission by William
Spangle and Associates. Under
the plan, much of the Univer
sity's land in Sail Mateo 11 o t
presently in use would he sei
aside for public parks and rec
reational facilities.
Only ill this manner, Spangle
writes iu the foreword to th •*
Portola Valley Plan, will it be
possible "to maintain the area

as one of scenic beauty with
a quality of open space provid
ing relief from more congested
areas. . .
The University, according
to real estate manager Dave
Casto, agrees that the proposal
is an "excellent idea," but un
fortunately is not economi
cally sound. In Brandin's
words, "the plan seems to ig
nore the unforeseen but surely
increasing needs of Stanford
University for both land and
economic support."
lie continued "... Stan
ford's lands are held in public
trust under provisions of the

State Constitution for purposes
which support the University's
programs. The Trustees a r e
obligated to preserve these
lands in perpetuity and they
are also obligated to defend
them against exploitation for
private benefit and for public
uses unrelated to Stanford's
needs."
Specifically, the University
objected to the following pro
visions:
• New public trails, roads
and parks in the area adjacent
to the Jasper Kidge Biological
Preserve. By attracting more
people, these would "eventually

doom the Kidge as a Labora
tory."
• Use of Searsvllle Lake as
a "district serving park" to be
kept for recreation use ami
"either privately or publicly
owned."
• The location of recrea
tional areas adjacent to SLAC.
Brandin told the planners
that since "we own and pay the
taxes on these properties . . .
(we) cannot affix a use today
without knowing more than is
now known of the changes that
will l>c brought about by the
immediate presence of th e
Junipero Serra Freeway a n d

its interchange with the pro
posed Willow Freeway exten
sion; or of the stimulus to fu
ture University and private re
search and development activi
ties which might he brought
alH>ut by the operation of th e
linear accelerator."
For these reasons, the Trus
t«vs have left most of the area
between Alpine Road and the
Town of Woodside as 'pending
definition.'
At the second public hearing
Monday night, Spangle re
butted Brandin aiul the Trus
td'es. "Th e University," In
dia rged, "is subject to the

same opportunities ami con
straints as any other projierty
owner. . . . The community has
a right to know the plans of
the I uiversity so that it can
plan for the surrounding area."
Sangle urged the University
to "determine the general char
acter of us" planned for th e
disp u t e d areas. Then he
warned that "it is perfectly
conceivable that a use proposed
by Stanford might not be ap
propriate and in such a case
the general community Inter
est should be overriding."
The third public hearing has
not yet been scheduled.

lands in perpetuity and they
are also obligated to defend
them against exploitation for
private benefit and for public
uses unrelated to Stanford's
needs."
Specifically, the University
objected to the following pro
visions:
• New public trails, roads
and parks in the area adjacent
to the Jasper Kidge Biological
Preserve. By attracting more
people, these would "eventually

doom the Kidge as a Labora
tory."
• Use of Searsvllle Lake as
a "district serving park" to be
kept for recreation use ami
"either privately or publicly
owned."
• The location of recrea
tional areas adjacent to SLAC.
Brandin told the planners
that since "we own and pay the
taxes on these properties . . .
(we) cannot affix a use today
without knowing more than is
now known of the changes that
will l>c brought about by the
immediate presence of th e
Junipero Serra Freeway a n d

its interchange with the pro
posed Willow Freeway exten
sion; or of the stimulus to fu
ture University and private re
search and development activi
ties which might he brought
alH>ut by the operation of th e
linear accelerator."
For these reasons, the Trus
t«vs have left most of the area
between Alpine Road and the
Town of Woodside as 'pending
definition.'
At the second public hearing
Monday night, Spangle re
butted Brandin aiul the Trus
td'es. "Th e University," In
dia rged, "is subject to the

same opportunities ami con
straints as any other projierty
owner. . . . The community has
a right to know the plans of
the I uiversity so that it can
plan for the surrounding area."
Sangle urged the University
to "determine the general char
acter of us" planned for th e
disp u t e d areas. Then he
warned that "it is perfectly
conceivable that a use proposed
by Stanford might not be ap
propriate and in such a case
the general community Inter
est should be overriding."
The third public hearing has
not yet been scheduled.
The University has again Im>-
come embroiled in a contro
versy over how it should use
its foothill acreage.
Last year, the Town of
Woodside objected to the in
stallation of overhead power
lines for the Stanford Linear
Accelerator (SI.AC). This year,
Portola Valley is upset because
the University, in Vice Presi
dent Alt' Brandin's words, has
refused to regard its foothill

acreage as "either a pleasure
land or as an endless source of
greenbelt areas and public
parks."
The current conflict is caused
by a master plan prepared for
the Portola Valley Town Plan
ning - Commission by William
Spangle and Associates. Under
the plan, much of the Univer
sity's land in Sail Mateo 11 o t
presently in use would he sei
aside for public parks and rec
reational facilities.
Only ill this manner, Spangle
writes iu the foreword to th •*
Portola Valley Plan, will it be
possible "to maintain the area

as one of scenic beauty with
a quality of open space provid
ing relief from more congested
areas. . .
The University, according
to real estate manager Dave
Casto, agrees that the proposal
is an "excellent idea," but un
fortunately is not economi
cally sound. In Brandin's
words, "the plan seems to ig
nore the unforeseen but surely
increasing needs of Stanford
University for both land and
economic support."
