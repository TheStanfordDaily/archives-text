# Olmstead Designed Plans For Campus

### HENRY MULLER (Second in a Series 
Stanford w as one ol the first universities to luive an overall plan
for development. This is largely due to the fact that Sen. Stan
ford gave a very large amount of money for its founding.
No one could found a university today with Sit million, hut
in the late 19th century such an amount was sufficient to do prac-

tically anything.

LELAND STANFORD first
i hired one of the leading city plan
ners of the day, Frederick Law
Olmstead, to develop an overall
plan for the university. Olm- j
stead had become famous 112 or J
planning Central Park in Newi
I York.
Many problems were connected
[with finding a suitable plan for a
California institution. The most
i prominent was the semi-arid cli
mate. In trying to develop a con-
| sistent and compartible pattern,)
the original architects looked in
| various parts of the world for a
j climate similar to that of t he Pen
insula.
They found that the topogra
| phy, horticulture, and climate of
j central and southern Spain
greatly resembled thai of Senator
Stanford's farm. In Spain, they
noticed, a house customarily
! turned inward rather than out
ward. This was the inspiration for
the Quadrangle.
THE OLMSTEAD Plan called t
for a row of seven quadrangles. 1
There would be one central quad, j
the present one. and three quads j
to the north and south.
A large area for detached dwell
ings would he located to the east
and west of the row of quadran
gles. This residential area would
Ih> connected to the central uni
versity buildings by wide walk
ways.
SOUTH OF the Quad there arc j
now three libraries. One more,
the undergraduate library, is be
inj, r built, and another, the Hoover
Building adjacent to Hoover Tow
er, will soon be under construc
tion.
According to plans, there will
one day be several more buildings,
all either librdHes, or closely ro I

lated to other libraries.
OI,.MSTKAI> conceived a quad
rangle of buildings with related
uses. Thus, it not architecturally,
in principle the library quad will
resemble the central quad.
Similarly, north of the central
quad are several science build
ings. These are the Chemistry
Building, th e Varian Physics
Building, the MeCullough Build
ing, and the Physics Lecture Hall.
A Biology complex and a. new
Earth Science Building are to be
built in the same area. Again, the
principle, although not the L r eo-
