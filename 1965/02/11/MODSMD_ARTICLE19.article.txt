# Matmen Face Oregon, Poly
## 
### 
Still hurting in ihe lower weight
divisions, Stanford wrestlers l'aee
a tough Oregon team tonight at
7:30 p.m. in the Pavilion, then
grapple with Cal Poly of Pomona
tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. in Eneina
Gym.
The Cards will probably have
to forfeit two or three matches
in both meeets. Even with that
10- or 15-point handicap, Stanford
still has a good chance to beat Cal
Poly.
Oregon is something else, how
ever. The Ducks finished second
in last year's Pacific Coast tourna-
I ment behind Oregon State, which
I downed Stanford, 28-8, last week.
| Wrestling for Stanford will be
! Corky Vance, Bob Garcia, Mike
Davison, Bruce WiLhelm, an d
either Frank Pratt or John Price.
