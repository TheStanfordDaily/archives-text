# Vandals Mar SNCC Photos With Insults
## No Clues Toward Finding Culprits

Vandals defaced a Mississippi
Freedom Project display in the
lobby outside of Cubberley Audi
torium Tuesday night with racist
remarks.
Other similar remarks were
painted on the construction fence
surrounding the site of the new
undergraduate library, located
near Cubberley, several weeks
ago.
ASSISTANT CHIEF of Police
Tom Bell said yesterday there are
no leads, but "there is a good
chance" the same party is respon
sible for both incidents.
The Cubberley scrawlings, ap
parently made with a black mark
ing pencil, contained such smears
as "Down with Niggers." "Hate.
Hate, Hate," and "Ship 'Em Back
To Africa." There were also x's
through the eyes of Negroes
shown in the pictures and other
random scribbling.
THE DISPLAY includes pic
tures of Mississippi Negroes,
whites, and police as well as vari
ous scenes from the state. The
pictures are taken from"The
Movement," a pictorial "documen
tary of a struggle for equality."
A third case of vandalism in
volved an off-campus graduate
student in English, Robert Pin
skey, who found "Kill the Jews"
and several swastikas painted on
the front of his Palo Alto house
last Friday.
The vandalism was presumably
in response to a poem about con
centration camps Pinskey pub
lished in the newsletter of the
Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee.
