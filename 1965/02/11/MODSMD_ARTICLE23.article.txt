# An Aphorism A Day . . .
## 
### 
A week ago yesterday, shortly before " The
Deluge," President Sterling made one of his rare
gestures at public "communication.
In a speech to the IFC, he issued a "chal
lenge" to the Stanford student community — a
"challenge contained iu the following criteria
for judging one's own "responsibility":
• Maintain high standards of academic per
formance;
• Keep high standards of personal conduct;
• Show respect and care for private property.
(lie also suggested that criticism should be
made with good humour and without arro
gance. )
Certainly few would quarrel with the legiti
maev of these aphorisms as a modus vivendi:
but the fact that Dr. Sterling felt it necessary to
couch such profundities in the solemn form of
"A Challenge" betrays an attitude that is either
very naive or very patronizing.
The latter would seem more typical.
Not infrequently, members of the administra
tion seem to act as if possessed by some rare form
of schizophrenia.
Thus at one moment an administrator may
boastfully extoll the intelligence and maturity of
that rare and commercially precious commodity
("image-wise")—the Stanford student—and, at
the next moment, may adopt the most patroniz
ingly paternalistic of attitudes in shunting aside
the student s desire to supervise his own conduct.
Apparently the Stanford student is "mature
and intelligent only within the confines of the
classroom. Once outside that magic perimeter he
reverts to the level of a babbling infant, unable
to care for his own needs.
This is not merely a double standard; this is
legerdemain.
What is lacking in this attitude is respect
respect for the dignity of the student as a mature
human being.
Somehow in America, we have developed the
myth that to be a student is to be something less
than a person. The eight or more years of sec
ondary and college level schooling which society
requires of those who would attain "status" is
often regarded as a period of suspended anima
tion during which the individual "prepares for
life.
In recent years, however, the concept of the
student as bystander has become less and less

valid. From Mississippi to East Palo Alto, the
student lias been an active member of his so
ciety. In cxccedingh trying situations he lias fre
quently demonstrated a capacity for courage,
tenacity, and responsibility worthy of any
"adult."
Yet bureaucratic machines are notoriously
slow to react even in the face ot the most obvious
evidence.
Thus at Stanford, as elsewhere, the Adminis
tration has clung resolutely to its traditional
means of dealing with students with little regard
to the present effectiveness of those means.
Essentially, many members of the Stanford
administration still regard student government in I
terms of "citizenship training. ' The reforms of j
the past two years have been little more than j
sops at best.
The administration still too frequently regards !
students as a necessary evil to be manipulated,
convinced, and controlled for the greater ease
and comfort of the "institution. What liberaliza
tion there is, has largely been a result of an in
crease in administrative anxiety; not a lessening
of administration paternalism.
The last retreat of a beleagnrcd bureacracy is
stubbornness; "Attendance at this University is
a privilege and not a right" is a stubborn state-!
merit.
The ultimate result of this stubbornness is
that student demands for some measure of per
sonal autonomy (e.g., "We assert that ASSU
shall have sole jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct. ) are dismissed with nan a second
thought as "mere rebellion."
In short, "student dignity has a hard time j
existing in an atmosphere of patronizing pater
nalism.
Ultimately, no one can doubt but that the
administration can be as stubborn as it wants
for as long as it wants. The power is all on one
side.
Yet it would be a shame in a university com- j
munity if a jealous conservation of authority be- J
came the motive for all action.
Perhaps it is time for a little painful re-evalu-;
ation.
For, as President Sterling remarked to the
IFC, "Any element of any institution must be!
able to justify its existence. If it cannot, it should j
not exist."

The last retreat of a beleagnrcd bureacracy is
stubbornness; "Attendance at this University is

The ultimate result of this stubbornness is
that student demands for some measure of per
sonal autonomy (e.g., "We assert that ASSU
shall have sole jurisdiction over student affairs

thought as "mere rebellion."
In short, "student dignity has a hard time j

Ultimately, no one can doubt but that the

A week ago yesterday, shortly before " The
Deluge," President Sterling made one of his rare
gestures at public "communication.
In a speech to the IFC, he issued a "chal
lenge" to the Stanford student community — a
"challenge contained iu the following criteria
for judging one's own "responsibility":
• Maintain high standards of academic per
formance;
• Keep high standards of personal conduct;
• Show respect and care for private property.
(lie also suggested that criticism should be
made with good humour and without arro
gance. )
Certainly few would quarrel with the legiti
maev of these aphorisms as a modus vivendi:
but the fact that Dr. Sterling felt it necessary to
couch such profundities in the solemn form of
"A Challenge" betrays an attitude that is either
very naive or very patronizing.
The latter would seem more typical.
Not infrequently, members of the administra
tion seem to act as if possessed by some rare form
of schizophrenia.
Thus at one moment an administrator may
boastfully extoll the intelligence and maturity of
that rare and commercially precious commodity
("image-wise")—the Stanford student—and, at
the next moment, may adopt the most patroniz
ingly paternalistic of attitudes in shunting aside
the student s desire to supervise his own conduct.
Apparently the Stanford student is "mature
and intelligent only within the confines of the
classroom. Once outside that magic perimeter he
reverts to the level of a babbling infant, unable
to care for his own needs.
This is not merely a double standard; this is
legerdemain.
What is lacking in this attitude is respect
respect for the dignity of the student as a mature
human being.
Somehow in America, we have developed the
myth that to be a student is to be something less
than a person. The eight or more years of sec
ondary and college level schooling which society
requires of those who would attain "status" is
often regarded as a period of suspended anima
tion during which the individual "prepares for
life.
In recent years, however, the concept of the
student as bystander has become less and less

valid. From Mississippi to East Palo Alto, the
student lias been an active member of his so
ciety. In cxccedingh trying situations he lias fre
quently demonstrated a capacity for courage,
tenacity, and responsibility worthy of any
"adult."
Yet bureaucratic machines are notoriously
slow to react even in the face ot the most obvious
evidence.
Thus at Stanford, as elsewhere, the Adminis
tration has clung resolutely to its traditional
means of dealing with students with little regard
to the present effectiveness of those means.
Essentially, many members of the Stanford
administration still regard student government in I
terms of "citizenship training. ' The reforms of j
the past two years have been little more than j
sops at best.
The administration still too frequently regards !
students as a necessary evil to be manipulated,
convinced, and controlled for the greater ease
and comfort of the "institution. What liberaliza
tion there is, has largely been a result of an in
crease in administrative anxiety; not a lessening
of administration paternalism.
