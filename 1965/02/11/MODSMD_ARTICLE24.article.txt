## Resolution In Poor Taste 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Hurrah for Ken Malovos. His
has been the first sensible voice
I've heard since last Thursday.
Not enough has been said about
the fact that (he "We assert that
the ASSU shall have sole .jurisdic
tion over student affairs and con
duct." clause is completely out of
tone with the rest of I he resolu
tion. This resolution was used
as a vehicle for a Grad Student
"cause," and they effectively used
the emotionalism caused by t he
Crow-Halverson Report to propel
it. It was obvious that night that

I supporters like Gary Feldman of
"spy systems," "thought police,"
and "giggling little girls" fame
j were ranting rather than arguing,
j Shades of Mario Savio.
All in all, passing the resolu
t tion with it's impotant rider last
| week was in very poor taste.
First, it amounted to an affirma
tion of the truth of the Crow-Hal
verson Report when the stated in
tent of tin 1 resolution was to with
hold judgment. Second, it demon
strated that LASSU is easily
swayed by a little organization
and a few pseudo-idealists. It's

disappointing to see student rep
resentatives who allow them
selves to be swayed by emotion- i
alism rather than rational argu- j
ments.
I suppose 1 could solve my prob
lem. though, by following the pre
cedent established last week by
the Grads themselves and merely
assert that they no longer have j
any influence or jurisdiction in
LASSU.
