The possibility of creating a
1 new organic molecule that would :
Ibe superconducting at ordinary |
; room temperature or above is dis-:
j cussed by Stanford University!
J Prof. William A. Little in the
| leading article of this month's
j issue of Scientific American)
| magazine.
j Superconductivity is a remark-j
| able kind of electrical perpetual
j motion that occurs in certain!
I metals cooled It) near obsolute j
I zero (-459°F). When electric cur
rent is induced in such metal, it
flows indefinitely without appreci
• able loss of power.
POWERFUL electromagnets as
strong as 250.000 gauss (500,000
'times the force of the earth's
magnetic field) have been built j
on the principle of superconduc
| tivity. Other potential uses are
; lossless power lines, frictionless j
bearings, and superconducting
I atom smashers. The main stum
bling block has been the require-!
| ment of elaborate and expensive j
! refrigeration equipment.
Prof. Little's proposed molecule,
if it can be produced, would elimi
note the refrigeration problem.
1 But he emphasizes that his idea is |
j only a theory, that although crea
| tion of such a molecule seems'
i possible it may eventually prove j
impossible. In any event he ex- i
pects it may take years of experi
ments to do the necessary re-1
search.
