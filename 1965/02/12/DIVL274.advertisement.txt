I CHEATING IS BIG NEWS
Cheating is making headlines in Washington and in Colo- j[!
rado Springs. Most people are against it. Many people do it. jj!
I Some get caught. C'hers do not. ![!
Though it is easy to explain cheating, the acceptance of it i j
I becomes more serious. Those who can cheat quite harmlessly ' >
on an exam can also cheat more harmfully when they are re- iji
sponsible for the defense of the nation. Some who complain ! !
loudly about high taxes are responsible for them by cheating ![!
on their own returns. We decry the activities of a Baker in jj!
Washington, but most of us have got a little of Bobby in us. !
Husbands who cheat their wives, and wives who cheat their
husbands, both cheat their children out of a knowledge of ![!
what is right and what is wrong. jj
When things get tough we cheat, rather than attack the
difficulties like men. Cheating is the escape hatch for those j
content to "get by." Minimum effort produces a second-rate ij
citizenry. The Great Society will never be built with incompe
tent men. Look for the easy way out in exams and you end up ij
5 looking for the easy way out in Vietnam or in the Congo.
Modern technology, problems and opportunities increase. j
To match this challenge we need more honesty, not less, more i
discipline, not less, more character, not less. <
j' We need moral re-armament just as we need military re- j
|| armament. The integrity of our officers is as important as the J
jj! accuracy of our missiles. j
I We strongly support the officers of the Academies who fight j
to arm morally, awake mentally, and perfect physically, the
pick of young American leadership. We stand with them in j
their efforts to safeguard the nation. We also stand by the J
cadets who resigned, who if they are the kind of men we J
believe they are, will rise above their mistakes and fight to J
preserve our standards and freedom. Ji[
At stake is not just cheating in college or Congress, but the j !
g modern motives and aims of America. Small aims make small !
jj men. Why should free men accept lesser aims for their lives, jij
ij pursued with less discipline and lesser sacrifice than those j [
; who follow the doctrines of Marx? Freedom must be spread
to survive. Absolute moral standards must be lived to keep j |
II men free. God must be obeyed to make democracy the moral |!j
j force it is meant to be. j!j
I* We, the undersigned, were among the 2,400 students who jj!
met at the Moral Re-Armament conference on Mackinac Island, !
Michi-gan last summer. We are planning for 10,000 to meet X
there this summer. By 1966 we want to have 100,000 young Ji[

I CHEATING IS BIG NEWS
Cheating is making headlines in Washington and in Colo- j[!
rado Springs. Most people are against it. Many people do it. jj!
I Some get caught. C'hers do not. ![!
Though it is easy to explain cheating, the acceptance of it i j

on an exam can also cheat more harmfully when they are re- iji
sponsible for the defense of the nation. Some who complain ! !
loudly about high taxes are responsible for them by cheating ![!
on their own returns. We decry the activities of a Baker in jj!
Washington, but most of us have got a little of Bobby in us. !
