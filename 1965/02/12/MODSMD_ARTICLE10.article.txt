# VD Problem Not Severe At Stanford
## 
### DOUD OHMANS 
The problem of venereal disease
is probably Jess severe at Stanford
than in the Bay Area and th« na
tion, according to Dr. Maurice M.
Osborne Jr., executive director of
the Stanford Health Service.
He said that the problem as
analyzed in a recent Palo Alto
Times series is indeed a serious
one, but less so among college
students than among the high
school population. "It is my im
pression," said Osborne, "that in
about the last year we are seeing
a few more cases of gonorrhea,
but no detectable rise in syphilis."
He gave two reasons for this
lag.
"IN GENERAL," he said, "most
Stanford students are more aware
and more scared of venereal dis
ease than are teenage populations
of less education and lower socio
economic standing."
As a second reason, he cited the
remarks of Dr. Mervin Freedman,
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Men: "Most Stanford students in
dulge in intercourse, if at all, only
in the context of a serious rela
tionship. . . . Promiscuity is rare
on the college campus."
Predictably, most VD is con
tracted from off-campus contacts
or "out-and-out prostitutes," said
Osborne.
DR. OSBORNE agreed with the
contention of the Times that
about TO per cent of all eases are
unreported to the County. He said
that some Stanford students prob
ably go to private doctors rather
than the Health Service in order
to "keep their record clean."
Some students, he said, feel
that to come to the Health Service
with VD is like admitting a viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard. "In fact, this is not true.
VD is a purely medical matter and
has no bearing on a student's
standing with the University."
Hal Wilson, University Public
Health Officer here, argued
that to draw generalizations from
figures in the range of three or
four reported cases a year is de
ceptive and dangerous.
DOCTOR WILSON said. "Be
causc our educational back
grounds are better, Stanford stu
dents probably have less VD then
a cross-section of all teenagers."
"Venereal disease is controlled
by public awareness," said Wilson,
"and there hasn't been much edu
cation in the field. ... It will prob
ably take years for the upward
trend to reverse itself."
Wilson explained that when a
Stanford student is treated for
VD. the case is reported in anony
mous code to the Stanford Pub
lice Health Office, and then to
Santa Clara County. Stanford has
an agreement with the county
that contacts will be followed up
and offered treatment, not by
county health officials, but by
Stanford doctors.

The problem of venereal disease
is probably Jess severe at Stanford
than in the Bay Area and th« na
tion, according to Dr. Maurice M.
Osborne Jr., executive director of
the Stanford Health Service.
He said that the problem as
analyzed in a recent Palo Alto
Times series is indeed a serious
one, but less so among college
students than among the high
school population. "It is my im
pression," said Osborne, "that in
about the last year we are seeing
a few more cases of gonorrhea,
but no detectable rise in syphilis."
He gave two reasons for this
lag.
"IN GENERAL," he said, "most
Stanford students are more aware
and more scared of venereal dis
ease than are teenage populations
of less education and lower socio
economic standing."
As a second reason, he cited the
remarks of Dr. Mervin Freedman,
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Men: "Most Stanford students in
dulge in intercourse, if at all, only
in the context of a serious rela
tionship. . . . Promiscuity is rare
on the college campus."
Predictably, most VD is con
tracted from off-campus contacts
or "out-and-out prostitutes," said
Osborne.
DR. OSBORNE agreed with the
contention of the Times that
about TO per cent of all eases are
unreported to the County. He said
that some Stanford students prob
ably go to private doctors rather
than the Health Service in order
to "keep their record clean."
Some students, he said, feel
that to come to the Health Service
with VD is like admitting a viola
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard. "In fact, this is not true.
VD is a purely medical matter and
has no bearing on a student's
standing with the University."
Hal Wilson, University Public
Health Officer here, argued
that to draw generalizations from
figures in the range of three or
four reported cases a year is de
ceptive and dangerous.
DOCTOR WILSON said. "Be
causc our educational back
grounds are better, Stanford stu
dents probably have less VD then
a cross-section of all teenagers."
"Venereal disease is controlled
by public awareness," said Wilson,
"and there hasn't been much edu
cation in the field. ... It will prob
ably take years for the upward
trend to reverse itself."
Wilson explained that when a
Stanford student is treated for
VD. the case is reported in anony
mous code to the Stanford Pub
lice Health Office, and then to
Santa Clara County. Stanford has
an agreement with the county
that contacts will be followed up
and offered treatment, not by
county health officials, but by
Stanford doctors.
