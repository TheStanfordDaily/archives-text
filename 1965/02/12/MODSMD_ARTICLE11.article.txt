## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (CPS) â€” A
group of students at Temple Uni
versity here are forming to lobby
against state sales taxes on text
books.
Led by two officers of the stu
dent government, the group plans
lo ask students to send postcards
to their representatives in the
slate legislature asking them to
dislodge an anti-textbook tax bill
from committee. A similar bill
was passed in 1961. but was later
declared unconstitutional by the
State Supreme Court.
The Temple group is cooperat
ing with a parallel effort at the
University of Pennsylvania.
