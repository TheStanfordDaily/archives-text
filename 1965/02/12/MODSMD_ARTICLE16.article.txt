# Shakespeare Mauled In Comedia 'Twelfth Night'
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
Even though the performance
was open to the public free of
charge, it is a moot point as to
which state of mind predominated
! during Comedia's version of
"Twelfth Night": righteous indig
nation at seeing Shakespeare so
: callously and unforgivably
mauled, or embarrassment at see
ing the players trying to bite off
and chew a piece of theatrical
steak when obviously neither
their teeth nor their talent were
up to it.
(Angry critics are inclined to
be a trifle pompous; this one is
struggling' against almost over
whelming odds to be an excep
tion.)
To be as brief (and charitable)
as possible, Shakespeare's plot,

which turns on a tricky case of
identical twins and mistaken
identity, is a sort of high romance,
wherein most of the comic ele
ments are carried by a slapstii ky
side intrigue.
The Wrong Laughs
Unfortunately, that is not quite I
as things appear on Comedia's j
stage. The serious and romantic j
parts are even more ridiculous I
than the ridiculous ones (which
are very funny); and although
there is a good deal of pleasant
laughter during the evening, too
often it is in the wrong places.
Once in a while, the Bard him-;
self manages to struggle to stage j
center in the guise of one or an-1
other of the characters and give;
the audience a glimmering of
what might have been, but those
moments are precious few.
And they are mainly the work
of Kathryn Rainie, who doesn't |
need to bother stealing the show: j
siie has it all wrapped up from j
her first entrance. Her cockney |
accent and her serving-maid's |
sauciness are both consistent and
convincing, as well as having the!
extra added attraction (if being!
j subtle.
And A Headache
Eric Silins' comic Sir Andrew
Agueeheek is consistent enough,;
too, but he is regrettably an ar- i
dent practitioner of the deafening
delivery, which does little more;
than give the listener a splitting
headache.
The rest of t lie cast is epito
mized by Jim Harris as Orsino,
who delivers the first line of the
play, "If music be the food of
love, play on," not only incredibly
woodenly but with all the accents
in the wrong place, no mean feat
considering the line is perfect
iambic pentameter. They all try
very hard, and sometimes almost |
succeed, hut they never quite;
make it.
In short, granted that the play's
subtitle actually is "What You'
Will," still, by no conceivable |
stretch of the imagination could
, Shakespeare ever have willed
| what Comedia has done to it.

sauciness are both consistent and

And A Headache
Eric Silins' comic Sir Andrew
Agueeheek is consistent enough,;
too, but he is regrettably an ar- i
dent practitioner of the deafening
delivery, which does little more;
than give the listener a splitting
headache.
The rest of t lie cast is epito
mized by Jim Harris as Orsino,
who delivers the first line of the
play, "If music be the food of
love, play on," not only incredibly
woodenly but with all the accents
in the wrong place, no mean feat
considering the line is perfect
iambic pentameter. They all try
very hard, and sometimes almost |
succeed, hut they never quite;
make it.
In short, granted that the play's
subtitle actually is "What You'
Will," still, by no conceivable |
stretch of the imagination could
, Shakespeare ever have willed
| what Comedia has done to it.
Even though the performance
was open to the public free of
charge, it is a moot point as to
which state of mind predominated
! during Comedia's version of
"Twelfth Night": righteous indig
nation at seeing Shakespeare so
: callously and unforgivably
mauled, or embarrassment at see
ing the players trying to bite off
and chew a piece of theatrical
steak when obviously neither
their teeth nor their talent were
up to it.
(Angry critics are inclined to
be a trifle pompous; this one is
struggling' against almost over
whelming odds to be an excep
tion.)
To be as brief (and charitable)
as possible, Shakespeare's plot,

which turns on a tricky case of
identical twins and mistaken
identity, is a sort of high romance,
wherein most of the comic ele
ments are carried by a slapstii ky
side intrigue.
The Wrong Laughs
Unfortunately, that is not quite I
as things appear on Comedia's j
stage. The serious and romantic j
parts are even more ridiculous I
than the ridiculous ones (which
are very funny); and although
there is a good deal of pleasant
laughter during the evening, too
often it is in the wrong places.
Once in a while, the Bard him-;
self manages to struggle to stage j
center in the guise of one or an-1
other of the characters and give;
the audience a glimmering of
what might have been, but those
moments are precious few.
And they are mainly the work
of Kathryn Rainie, who doesn't |
need to bother stealing the show: j
siie has it all wrapped up from j
her first entrance. Her cockney |
accent and her serving-maid's |
sauciness are both consistent and
convincing, as well as having the!
extra added attraction (if being!
j subtle.
