## Stanley Supremely Moving In Tension Filled 'Seance' 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
A candle flickers in a dark room.
A woman's sad, austere face ap
pears behind the wavering light.
Her hushed voice murmurs to
the sound of softly falling rain as
an undertone. She extinguishes
the candle. A gabled house is re
flected in a pond.
These opening shots of "Seance
on a Wet Afternoon" establish a
mood of underkeyed tension
which is sustained throughout.
Indeed, the entire film is a study
in restraint and understatement.
The considerable and unrelenting
tension is achieved by glances,
voice inflections, strained silences,
exaggeration of natural sounds
(the patter of rain, a brush run
ning through hair, the incessant
ticking of a clock), tight editing
with sharp cuts from scene to
scene, occasional use of asynchro
nous sound, an d chiaroscuro
photography which views th e
characters from varying angles.
Owing to the unflagging taste
of Bryan Forbes, the director,
these stylistic devices serve solely
as means for maintaining tension
and never become obtrusive di
gressions merely for their own
sake.
Subtle Screenplay
Forbes has aided his subtle di
rectorial skills with his equally
subtle screenplay. The plot, which
concerns a medium who under
takes a kidnapping so she can
claim to use her powers in dis
covering the child, is, in itself,
material for a conventional thril
ler. But under Forbes' superin
tendence, the result is anything
but conventional.
This is so principally because of
the film's intriguing structure,
which unfolds the details of the
plot somewhat in the form of a
maze; by following suggestion
and inference, the viewer assem
bles gradually and piece by piece
the sense of what is happening.
This conscious ambiguity of
plot rightfully focuses attention
on the character of the medium,
and it is the richness of this char
acter which elevates the film from
the category of thriller. With the
presence of Kim Stanley as the
medium the film becomes some
thing very elevated indeed.

Complex Portrayal
With a restraint and ease that
is thoroughly natural, Miss Stan
ley's character operates on sev
eral levels of complexity. She is
at first the shrewish wife who
domineers her weak-willed hus
band (played with uncanny skill
by Richard Attenborough) into
going through with the kidnap
ping. To keep her husband in
line, she snaps at him, eyes flash
ing menacingly, or she mothers
him solicitously, or she adopts the
coyness of a young girl.
When she threatens her hus
band, her face becomes hard and
cruel, her puffy eyes squint, her
lower lip protrudes in disgust, her
voice is razor-sharp. When s h e
wants sympathy from him. her
features become soft and round,
her voice is high-pitched and nos
talgic.
In her dealing with her cus
tomers and with the police, we
get a different side of her alto
gether. She is here the brisk and
politic businesswoman, thor
oughly in control of the situation.
Madness Suggested
Underneath everything she
does, however, Miss Stanley man
ages to suggest her character's
madness, which in turn manifests
itself on two levels: there is the
madness of a lost little girl,
utterly alone and defenseless, and
tlie madness of her belief in the
spirit world. During the seance
scenes, when she believes she has
contacted a spirit, her whole body
shakes uncontrollably and her
voice quavers with repressed in
tensity.
But the summit of the actress'
work is tho poignancy she injects
into what might have been a
largely unsympathetic character.
At the end we learn that she lias
kidnapped the little girl as a
means of reaching the spirit of
her dead son. In the final seance
she holds this imaginary infant in
her arms, and as she sobs quietly
she is supremely moving.
Kim Stanley has long been one
of Broadway's most gifted ac
tresses; now, in her second film,
she has become a star. Hopefully,
she will find other challenging
film scripts so that her art can
be appreciated in cities all over
the world.

tomers and with the police, we
get a different side of her alto
gether. She is here the brisk and
politic businesswoman, thor
oughly in control of the situation.
Madness Suggested
Underneath everything she
does, however, Miss Stanley man
ages to suggest her character's
madness, which in turn manifests
itself on two levels: there is the
madness of a lost little girl,
utterly alone and defenseless, and
tlie madness of her belief in the
spirit world. During the seance
scenes, when she believes she has
contacted a spirit, her whole body
shakes uncontrollably and her
voice quavers with repressed in
tensity.
But the summit of the actress'
work is tho poignancy she injects
into what might have been a
largely unsympathetic character.
At the end we learn that she lias
kidnapped the little girl as a
means of reaching the spirit of
her dead son. In the final seance
she holds this imaginary infant in
her arms, and as she sobs quietly
she is supremely moving.
Kim Stanley has long been one
of Broadway's most gifted ac
tresses; now, in her second film,
she has become a star. Hopefully,
she will find other challenging
film scripts so that her art can
be appreciated in cities all over
the world.


A candle flickers in a dark room.
A woman's sad, austere face ap
pears behind the wavering light.
Her hushed voice murmurs to
the sound of softly falling rain as
an undertone. She extinguishes
the candle. A gabled house is re
flected in a pond.
These opening shots of "Seance
on a Wet Afternoon" establish a
mood of underkeyed tension
which is sustained throughout.
Indeed, the entire film is a study
in restraint and understatement.
The considerable and unrelenting
tension is achieved by glances,
voice inflections, strained silences,
exaggeration of natural sounds
(the patter of rain, a brush run
ning through hair, the incessant
ticking of a clock), tight editing
with sharp cuts from scene to
scene, occasional use of asynchro
nous sound, an d chiaroscuro
photography which views th e
characters from varying angles.
Owing to the unflagging taste
of Bryan Forbes, the director,
these stylistic devices serve solely
as means for maintaining tension
and never become obtrusive di
gressions merely for their own
sake.
Subtle Screenplay
Forbes has aided his subtle di
rectorial skills with his equally
subtle screenplay. The plot, which
concerns a medium who under
takes a kidnapping so she can
claim to use her powers in dis
covering the child, is, in itself,
material for a conventional thril
ler. But under Forbes' superin
tendence, the result is anything
but conventional.
This is so principally because of
the film's intriguing structure,
which unfolds the details of the
plot somewhat in the form of a
maze; by following suggestion
and inference, the viewer assem
bles gradually and piece by piece
the sense of what is happening.
This conscious ambiguity of
plot rightfully focuses attention
on the character of the medium,
and it is the richness of this char
acter which elevates the film from
the category of thriller. With the
presence of Kim Stanley as the
medium the film becomes some
thing very elevated indeed.

Complex Portrayal
With a restraint and ease that
is thoroughly natural, Miss Stan
ley's character operates on sev
eral levels of complexity. She is
at first the shrewish wife who
domineers her weak-willed hus
band (played with uncanny skill
by Richard Attenborough) into
going through with the kidnap
ping. To keep her husband in
line, she snaps at him, eyes flash
ing menacingly, or she mothers
him solicitously, or she adopts the
coyness of a young girl.
When she threatens her hus
band, her face becomes hard and
cruel, her puffy eyes squint, her
lower lip protrudes in disgust, her
voice is razor-sharp. When s h e
wants sympathy from him. her
features become soft and round,
her voice is high-pitched and nos
talgic.
In her dealing with her cus
tomers and with the police, we
get a different side of her alto
gether. She is here the brisk and
politic businesswoman, thor
oughly in control of the situation.
