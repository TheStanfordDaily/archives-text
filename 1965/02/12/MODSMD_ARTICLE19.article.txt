# Christian Living: A System of Cosmic Barter?
## 
### 
The attitude of toe many professing Christians toward the motivation lor
Christian living does little to dispel the caricature that Christians actions are
traded for God's blessings. Too otten it seems that ( hristians <1 <> good because
God has promised to be good to them and give them good things in return. '1 ou
often it seems that Christians are afraid to do evil because Cod ha* threatened
to punish them and take away things they like. Thus, the motivation for
Christian living is presented as either enlightened self-interest or craven fear
of the loss of life's comforts.
11* this is your attitude low aid the motivation behind the things that people,
who call themselves Christians, do. then you need to take a good look at the
Bible. And while you are at it. show it to your Christian friends as well. For
not only does the Bible totally repudiate such a position, but it emphasizes
that Christian living can be motivated only by God's love in a person which
gives a desire to serve Jesus Christ.
Sometimes it is true that material things do come to Christians, but the
only earthly 'reward' that Christians are promised is persecution for the sake
of Jesus Christ. The "\\ hat-do-1 -get-out-of-it', what's in it - for-me', reward
motive is totally at odds with the teaching of the Bible. Any attempted service
to God rendered out of a motivation for the acquisition of rewards, either in
life or iti an afterlife, is by its very nature no service at all. For exactly the
same reasons, any attempted service to God resulting from a selfish fear of
retribution if the sen ice is left tin rendered, is also no service.
Perhaps the service-reward, no-punishment, cosmic-barter caricature has
been related to a-misunderstanding of the function ot God's law. Too often the
commandments of God are viewed as the symbol of tyrannical power imposed
upon men from without, as the cold imposition of arbitrary responsibility, or
as an unpleasant burden to be borne, lest God be offended as He waits in
sovereign impassiv eness to crush the offender in the tires of Mis wrath. Paul
emphasizes what a perversion of the law of God such an attitude is, when he
savs in Romans 13 :10. "I ovc is the fulfilling of the law", and then, as Christ
said in Matthew 5:17, "Think not that 1 am come to destroy the law . . . but
to fulfill".
Do you believe that love is a powerful force in human life, perhaps the
most opwerful force there is? Should you not then come to the source of love,
to the unconditioned Personality whose very naturi is hue: The apostle John
wrote to Christians, ". . . for God is love. In tins was manifested the love of
God toward us, bet ausi that God sent His only begotten Son into the world,
that we might live through Him. Herein i- love. . . that He loved us and sent
His Son to be the propitiation for our sins" ( I John I :S 10). Do you wonder
about the love of God for you Conn- and see thai love which was so great
that your God in the Person of Jesus Christ was willing even to lay down His
life for you. Think about it.

that Christian living can be motivated only by God's love in a person which
gives a desire to serve Jesus Christ.
Sometimes it is true that material things do come to Christians, but the
only earthly 'reward' that Christians are promised is persecution for the sake
of Jesus Christ. The "\\ hat-do-1 -get-out-of-it', what's in it - for-me', reward
motive is totally at odds with the teaching of the Bible. Any attempted service
to God rendered out of a motivation for the acquisition of rewards, either in
life or iti an afterlife, is by its very nature no service at all. For exactly the
same reasons, any attempted service to God resulting from a selfish fear of
retribution if the sen ice is left tin rendered, is also no service.
Perhaps the service-reward, no-punishment, cosmic-barter caricature has
been related to a-misunderstanding of the function ot God's law. Too often the
commandments of God are viewed as the symbol of tyrannical power imposed
upon men from without, as the cold imposition of arbitrary responsibility, or
as an unpleasant burden to be borne, lest God be offended as He waits in
sovereign impassiv eness to crush the offender in the tires of Mis wrath. Paul
emphasizes what a perversion of the law of God such an attitude is, when he
savs in Romans 13 :10. "I ovc is the fulfilling of the law", and then, as Christ
said in Matthew 5:17, "Think not that 1 am come to destroy the law . . . but
to fulfill".
Do you believe that love is a powerful force in human life, perhaps the
most opwerful force there is? Should you not then come to the source of love,
to the unconditioned Personality whose very naturi is hue: The apostle John
wrote to Christians, ". . . for God is love. In tins was manifested the love of
God toward us, bet ausi that God sent His only begotten Son into the world,
that we might live through Him. Herein i- love. . . that He loved us and sent
His Son to be the propitiation for our sins" ( I John I :S 10). Do you wonder
about the love of God for you Conn- and see thai love which was so great
that your God in the Person of Jesus Christ was willing even to lay down His
life for you. Think about it.
