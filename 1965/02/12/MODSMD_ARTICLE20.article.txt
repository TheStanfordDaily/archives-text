# MEET NCAA CHAMPIONS
## Indian Swimmers Host USC 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The defending NCAA champion
Southern California Trojans with
six swimmers freshly returned
from the Olympic Games, barge
into the Farm Pond today at 3:00
p.m.
The frosh meet Chico State at
the same time, seeking to lengthen
its already impressive string of
record performances.
Saturday at 2:00 p.m. the vai
sit y meeis a strong Utah squad.
The Utes have lately emerged as
a growing swimming power.

SOUTHERN CAL swimmers
have made Trojan spectators
hoarse, winning more than fifty
consecutive dual meets. USC has
taken four straight AAWU cham
pionships and appears to be eas
ily on the way to their fifth.
Last spring, USC Coach Peter
Daland's squad dethroned the "un
beatable" Indiana and swam past
a strong Yale contingent to bring
the NCAA swimming champion
ship to Troy. USC has nearly the
same championship team return
ing this season.
The USC squad glitters with
gold, silver, and bronze Olympic
hardware. Roy Saari brought
home a gold medal in t ho 880
meter freestyle relay and a silver
medal in the 400 meter individual
medley.
BILL CRAIG made good in the

I breast stroke leg of the 400 meter
i medley relay to earn a gold medal.
Bob Bennett, a bronze medalist in
; t lie 200 meter backstroke, makes
his living by swimming opposite
to the customary bottoms-up atti-
I tude.
Breaststroker Wayne Anderson,
; distance man Sandy Gilchrist, and
j sprinter Rich McGcah constitute
the remainder of Troy's Olympic
I complement. With these six in
front with a dazzling team back
ing them up and down to the third
level, USC looks formidable to say
the least.
When Southern Cal was swim
ming last quarter without its
Olympians, the Trojans com
pletely swamped Washington.
Washington was the team that
touched out the Indians in the
final relay, 484-45'-, two weeks
ago.

STANFORD has just tho oppo
| site situation with depth, and
will need all that the varsity can
put forth. Ilkka Suvanto and Jim
Laney present a threat nearly
every place in the line up. Sprin
ters Bill Derrig, Mike Doscher,
Dave Calfee, and Dave Hawkins
! will have a tough time with the
fleet Trojan seahorses.
Stanford's freshmen, with one
American record, a pool record,
| and six frosh records already
! tucked under their suits, will be
[blasting out against the clock to
garner still more.
