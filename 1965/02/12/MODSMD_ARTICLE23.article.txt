# Indian's Scalp Saving Campaign To Prove Its Hair Against OSU
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Having hiked north last week-1
lend and collected two scalps, |
j barely escaping with their own,
tho Stanford Indians are going to
i have to be at their best tonight
and Saturday when they again
meet Ihe sealpless invaders Ore
gon and Oregon State. Stanford
defeated both of these teams last j
! weekend.
I
Revenge will be sought by both i
! of these squads. Stanford pelted
it he Oregon State Beavers last!
! week 51-48 and defeated Oregon!
>77 75 in two real thrillers.
NEITHER route.si was decided '
until the final seconds of the
j game. The key shot in the Oregon
game was delivered by Stanford's
Gary Loveridge in the last three
seconds lo down the Ducks, 77-75.
Oregon shot a torrid 62 per cent
!in the first half and completed
the contest with 54 per cent.
Against Cal last week their deadly
shooting continued hitting 64 per
cent in the first half.
Outside shooting may be the
; focal point of both games. Oregon

| State's offense is almost entirely,
dependent on the shooting of Jim
1 Jarvis whose outside shots of 30
! feet or more are not uncommon.
Jarvis is the leading scorer in the
league averaging over 22 points
a game.
OREGON HAS three fine out
side shooters in guards Nick
Jones, Jim Barnett, and forward
Bill Jennings.
Both squads are of the same
j caliber, having split their two pre
vious non-conference meetings by
; almost the same margin. Oregon
won the first 59-53 and Oregon
! State the second 53-48.
However, the Ducks of Oregon
! State seem to have a betLer bal-!
ance of scoring. All five starters
are averaging in double figures.
Jim Barnett is high at 17.3 with
Bill Jennings and Nick Jones
pumping in around 15 a game.
NICK JONES has shown the!

i most improvement in recent
games. Against Stanford last
Week he tallied 20 points and
: against California the following
' evening he put in 23.
So teamed with running mate
Jim Barnett, Oregon has a very
| classy baekcourt pair indeed. Cali-
I fornia coach Rene Herrerias called
j them, "one of the finest guard
j combinations on the Coast.''
Stanford is going to need all the
luck they can get this weekend;
, the going will be rough. To win
the Indians will have to clamp
down on defense and stop as much
of the outside shooting as pos
i sible. Rebounding will also deter
| mine if Stanford will survive with
its hair.

Stanford is going to need all the
luck they can get this weekend;

the Indians will have to clamp
down on defense and stop as much
of the outside shooting as pos

I
Revenge will be sought by both i

it he Oregon State Beavers last!
! week 51-48 and defeated Oregon!
>77 75 in two real thrillers.
NEITHER route.si was decided '
until the final seconds of the
j game. The key shot in the Oregon
game was delivered by Stanford's
Gary Loveridge in the last three
seconds lo down the Ducks, 77-75.
Oregon shot a torrid 62 per cent
!in the first half and completed
the contest with 54 per cent.
Against Cal last week their deadly
shooting continued hitting 64 per
cent in the first half.
Outside shooting may be the
; focal point of both games. Oregon

| State's offense is almost entirely,
dependent on the shooting of Jim
1 Jarvis whose outside shots of 30
! feet or more are not uncommon.
Jarvis is the leading scorer in the
league averaging over 22 points
a game.
OREGON HAS three fine out
side shooters in guards Nick
Jones, Jim Barnett, and forward
Bill Jennings.
Both squads are of the same
j caliber, having split their two pre
vious non-conference meetings by
; almost the same margin. Oregon
won the first 59-53 and Oregon
! State the second 53-48.
However, the Ducks of Oregon
! State seem to have a betLer bal-!
ance of scoring. All five starters
are averaging in double figures.
Jim Barnett is high at 17.3 with
Bill Jennings and Nick Jones
pumping in around 15 a game.
NICK JONES has shown the!

i most improvement in recent
games. Against Stanford last
Week he tallied 20 points and
: against California the following
' evening he put in 23.
So teamed with running mate
