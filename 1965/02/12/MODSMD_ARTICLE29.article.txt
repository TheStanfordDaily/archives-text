## Leopold, Malavos Questioned 
### 
Ltlitor, Th*' Daily:
We question the validity of
several statements and implica
tions presented in Mr. Leopold's
article of Monday, February 8,
and Mr. Malavos' letter of Tues
day, February 9. A large part of
our constituency in Roble has ex
pressed concern about so-called
"GCC control of LASSU," and
has requested that we forward
their view of the situation.
Re Mr. Leopold's article:
1 low does one define a "bloc?"
Do these new graduate seats con
stitute a "bloc" any more than
did an obstructionist undergrad
uate group which has had pre
vious control?....
Attendance was so heavy that

members were asked to sit in the
visitors' section. We are voting
j members, freshman, hardly mem
bers of the Graduate Coordinat
ing Committee, yet we found our
selves and other undergraduates
sitting near us applauding the
j first constructive and forthright
speeches we have yet heard in
' the Legislature.
Moreover, Mr. Leopold has sue
ceded in portraying a devious and
j rebellious legislative group which
jwe somehow failed to witness
last week.... Only a s 1 e e ping
j member could have thought the
| clause "obscured."
Re. Mr. Malavos' letter:
i In an effort to appear more
i "reasonable" that the "rabble" he

I so scathingly condemns, Mr.
Malavos made several statements
that are untrue. He asserts that
j this insidious group "was able to
end all debate before it began
| (thereby eliminating genuine ef
: forts at discussion)." He neglects
the fact that by parliamentary
procedure debale can be closed
only by a two-thirds vote. ...Of
| fifty-two available graduate seats
i only thirteen are filled by mem
; bers of the Graduate Coordinating
| Committee. Moreover, debate on
the clause was not aborted by
radicals ttying to "railroad" the
resolution through LASSU ; de
bate continued for over two hours
| and was stopped, again, only by
I a two-thirds vote....
Furthermore, can Mr. Malavos
propose that the efforts of grad
uate students and others is not
I to examine and to correct the
"justice and legality of the rule?"
Should we "withdraw from the
| institutions" at the first twinges
! of 'discontent ?
We would ask of Mr. Malavos
how many reform movements
with valid and essential dissatis
factions have pristine adherents
and motivations. His judgements
i on the personalities of this new
> element in LASSU are surely ir-
I relevant to the issue at hand.
We would further ask Mr.
j Malavos what respect LASSU
"has pr e vi o us 1 y enjoyed." As
i freshman and new members of
the Legislature, we were shocked
and disillusioned to find both
i apathy towards, and contempt for,
the Legislature, prior to a new
spirit of intiative in that body,
i Witness the Gaieties' parody.
Finally, we suggest that Mr.
Malavos reveals a contradiction in
tone. He condemns hasty action;
| what is more rash than the "call
■to arms" of the undergraduate
body to quell an influence lhat
may. with time and effort, prove
to be a good one?

• GCC Vigilantes
Lditor, The Daily:
A word about the Graduate
I Coordinating Committee.
What this group of self-ap
pointed vigilantes doesn't seem
•to understand is that a great
many insignificant things take
place on a university campus
which merit apathy. For example
the Graduate Coordinating
Committee.
This committee this pocket
of intellectual poverty has au
daciously proclaimed itself
spokesman for the graduate stu
dents on campus. Needless to say,
we the represented, were much
relieved to learn that these dra
gon slayers have announced their
support of one of the articles in
the Bill of Rights. We await anxi
i ously their next act of defiance.
