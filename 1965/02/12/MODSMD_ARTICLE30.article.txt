## GCC Mathematic Miracle Usurps LASSU Power 
### Justin Beck 
Somebody's math isn't too good, at least when it comes to,
counting up GCC votes.
One man-one vote is generally the standard in the Legislature,
but last week, I hear, the GCC got G2 votes, one more than enough
to set LASSU adrift in seas commonly labeled "irresponsibility" and

"radicalism" (Hither term will*
do, for these days they are used
interchangeably).
But someone must have mis-1
counted, for at last report, the |
GCC had only 13 members in the
Legislature, and at most, 12 sup- j
ported LASSU's controversial as
sertion. Twelve from 02 leaves
fifty votes unaccounted for, a
mystery that probably still baf
fles the I'oli. Sci. Department.
How did they get those other
fifty voles blackmail, bribery,
threats of violence, hypnotism, or
some subtler form of propaganda
heretofore unknown to the hu
man race. Did they use death rays
from outer space or robots, or per-!
haps blackjacks in dark alleys to!
coerce the Legislature into sup- i
porting statements against its
will.
The GCC claims innocence, of I
course.
.lay Kadanc. who has done for)
the GCC what that tatoo did for
Marlboro cigarettes, maintains
that even discounting their votes,
the issue was fairly close, 59-50.
He even claims that 33 under-1
graduates supported the "ole
.jurisdietion" clause.
It's amazing that Kadane should j
make such statements in the face
of all logic. Everyone knows that
the GCC is radical and the LASSU j
said something irresponsible.]
Therefore, as my Logic professor
says, let's blame those graduate
students. Q.E.D.
But the story gets worse; not |
only have those 13 graduate stu- j
dents railroaded their pet scheme j
through the 130 member legisla
ture. but they haven't represented
anybody while doing it.

After all they were elected un
contested, stifling, no doubt, a
great number, presumably a ma
jority, of the decent, right-minded
graduate students, who, though
they don't like radicalism, like to
vote even less.
One recalls the Chicago Trib
une's analysis'of the last election
so many people voted for John
son that they must not have
known what they were voting for.
That is the process known as
"The Great Unmandate." The
more people who vote for an in
dividual. the smaller the percent
age that agree on any single issue.
Therefore, the smaller the man
date.
The GCC candidates ran un
opposed, and, apparently got no
mandate at all.
If some more conservative
graduate students had run against
the GCC and had then been beaten
by a narrow margin, quite obvi
ously the GCC would have had a
more certain mandate. At least
that's the way things seem to
operate around here.
So while those 13 GCC'ers some
how get counted 02 times in the
role call vote last Thursday, its
obvious that representing no one,
they shouldn't have been allowed
to vole at all.
Instead .those radicals got 02
votes, enough to power through a
helpless Legislature their own
pel schemes which in the end can
only hurt the Administraion's feel
ings and perhaps break that preci
ous thread of communication be
tween students and Administra
tion that has accomplish so much
of so little.

of so little.
Somebody's math isn't too good, at least when it comes to,
counting up GCC votes.
One man-one vote is generally the standard in the Legislature,
but last week, I hear, the GCC got G2 votes, one more than enough
to set LASSU adrift in seas commonly labeled "irresponsibility" and

"radicalism" (Hither term will*
do, for these days they are used
interchangeably).
But someone must have mis-1
counted, for at last report, the |
GCC had only 13 members in the
Legislature, and at most, 12 sup- j
ported LASSU's controversial as
sertion. Twelve from 02 leaves
fifty votes unaccounted for, a
mystery that probably still baf
fles the I'oli. Sci. Department.
How did they get those other
fifty voles blackmail, bribery,
threats of violence, hypnotism, or
some subtler form of propaganda
heretofore unknown to the hu
man race. Did they use death rays
from outer space or robots, or per-!
haps blackjacks in dark alleys to!
coerce the Legislature into sup- i
porting statements against its
will.
The GCC claims innocence, of I
course.
.lay Kadanc. who has done for)
the GCC what that tatoo did for
Marlboro cigarettes, maintains
that even discounting their votes,
the issue was fairly close, 59-50.
He even claims that 33 under-1
graduates supported the "ole
.jurisdietion" clause.
It's amazing that Kadane should j
make such statements in the face
of all logic. Everyone knows that
the GCC is radical and the LASSU j
said something irresponsible.]
Therefore, as my Logic professor
says, let's blame those graduate
students. Q.E.D.
But the story gets worse; not |
only have those 13 graduate stu- j
dents railroaded their pet scheme j
through the 130 member legisla
ture. but they haven't represented
anybody while doing it.

After all they were elected un
contested, stifling, no doubt, a
great number, presumably a ma
jority, of the decent, right-minded
graduate students, who, though
they don't like radicalism, like to
vote even less.
One recalls the Chicago Trib
une's analysis'of the last election
so many people voted for John
son that they must not have
known what they were voting for.
That is the process known as
"The Great Unmandate." The
more people who vote for an in
dividual. the smaller the percent
age that agree on any single issue.
Therefore, the smaller the man
date.
The GCC candidates ran un
opposed, and, apparently got no
mandate at all.
If some more conservative
graduate students had run against
the GCC and had then been beaten
by a narrow margin, quite obvi
ously the GCC would have had a
more certain mandate. At least
that's the way things seem to
operate around here.
So while those 13 GCC'ers some
how get counted 02 times in the
role call vote last Thursday, its
obvious that representing no one,
they shouldn't have been allowed
to vole at all.
Instead .those radicals got 02
votes, enough to power through a
helpless Legislature their own
pel schemes which in the end can
only hurt the Administraion's feel
ings and perhaps break that preci
ous thread of communication be
