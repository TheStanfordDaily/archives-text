# 'DRIVE IN' PREVENTED
## Campus Ignores Auto Age 
### HENRY MULLER 
(Third In a S«'ri»'s)
When Stanford University was
I originally planned, it was decided
| that no vehicles would be allowed
: near the central University build
| ings. This principle has been car
! ried over into the Automobile
| Age.
| According to Oscar Nelson of
•the Planning Office, "We don't
I want a drive-in University." If
' the gradual closing up of streets
continues as it has in the past
I years, all indications are that tho
S automobile will become less and
! less of an asset on campus.
; THE FIRST drastic step was
; taken in 1949. Lasuen Street was
! closed from History Corner to
I Campus Drive. The remains of
11he street and of the curb are
' still obvious in front of the Main
Library and the Education Build
ling, as well as in the portion of
Lasuen behind Dinkelspiel Audi
torium.
In 1964, the sastern part of La
! suen, between Palm Drive a n d
jSerra Street, was closed because

of construction 011 the new Gradu
ate School of Business. It will not
be reopened.
In about two or three years,
work will begin on the new Earth
Sciences Building, which will
straddle Lomita Street just West
of the McCullough Building. At
that time, Lomita will have 1o be
closed to traffic from Serra Street
to beyond the new edifice.
THEN THE CLOSED portion
of Lomita will be transformed
into a plaza. There will be foun
tains, lawns, and benches, a n d
Physics students will no longer
have to worry about indignant
drivers as they hurry to class.
When work begins on the new
Biology complex, to be located dia
gonally opposite Math Corner,
Lomita will also be permanently
closed from Serra to a point past
the Chemistry Building.
The closing of these streets
raises an obvious question: What
alternatives will there be for the
drivers who frequently use these
streets?
THE PLANNING Office has

again resorted to an overall plan
in order to answer these ques
tions. There will be a drive that
will completely encircle the cen
tral part of the campus. It will be
known as Campus Drive. A por
tion of it, namely from the vicin
ity of the Medical Center, past
the Varsity Tennis courts to tlie
intersection of Alvarado Row, is
already in use.
When the older fraternity
houses are torn down, Campus
Drive will bo extended in a north
westerly direction through the
area now occupied by the frats,
will go all the way around Lake
Lagunita, and back to the Medi
cal Center. There will be no
through traffic anywhere with
in this circle.
There will, however, be plenty
of access to the various facilities
within the central part of the
campus. There will also be an ade
quate amount of parking facilities
both along these access roads and
along the peripheral drive.
EMERGENCY vehicles will still
bo able to travel without restric
tion in the central part of campus.
The Planning Office is quite im
pressed by the fact that their cir
culation principle is the prevail
ing pattern in many other cam
puses. The planners for the Uni
versity of California campuses at
Santa Cruz and Irvine came to
Stanford to investigate the plan
and then chose to adopt a very
similar one. This indicates to Plan
ning Office Director Harry Sand
ers that "we are on the right
track."
DESPITE ITS expansion. Stan
ford is still trying to maintain its
distinctive atmosphere. Unlike
most universities, it is fortunate
enough to be separated from the
nearest community by a distance
of one mile.
Wherever their are any struc
tures relatively close to El Ca
mino Heal, as in Escondido Vil
lage, a "Green Belt" of trees and
shrubbery is planted in order to
separate the two and to give Stan
ford its identity.
