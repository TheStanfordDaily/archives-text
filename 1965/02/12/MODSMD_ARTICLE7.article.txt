### BRUCE BURTON 
An uneasy peace has settled in Southeast Asia
following joint U.S.-South Vietnamese air retalia
tion yesterday against military installations in
Communist North Viet Nam.
Nearly 1 BO planes U.S. fighter escorts and Viet
namese bombers struck targets in the communist
north in reprisal against renewed Viel Cong ter
rorist attacks on U.S. military facilities in South
Viet Nam.
THK A IK KAII) heavily damaged the targets,
two communist training and supply bases, accord
ing to a U.S. spokesman, but four planes and one
pilot were reported lost.
In Washington, President Lyndon Johnson con
ferred with members of the Congress and his Cabi
net. A White House statement maintained U.S.
desire to "avoid spreading the conflict,'' but didn't
say if yesterday's bombing would be the last made
in answer to the communist attack Wednesday
upon an enlisted men's barracks in Qui Nhon which
left 25 Americans dead or missing.
In Sun Francisco .evacuated families of Ameri
can soldiers in South Viet Nam and the dead and
wounded from Qui Nhon and Pleiku, scene of a
raid Saturday by the Viet Cong, continued to land
at Travis Air Force Base.

Bay Area watched more than 3.i intercontinental
jet bombers fly in a northwesterly direction.
Travis AFB called the 852 flights a "classified
Strategic Air Command operational exercise."
Hamilton AFB. north of San Francisco, said there

and other Western stales starting ' last night.
At Stanford. Associate Professor Jan F. Triska
of the Political Science Department said that the
American reprisal strikes were in line with over
all U.S. policy in Viet Nam.
Triska said he believes the U.S. eventually
wants a negotiated peace in Viet Nam and that the
air strikes were a meair of v.iviitu "Us a stron,".ei

hand" in any future negotiations.
liL SAII> THE ATTACKS were justified be
cause "we continue to carry our retaliation against
the Viet Cong in North Viet Nam because it is our
choice.
"We chose to interpret the attack in South Viet
Nam on the American advisers and installations
as being carried out" by North Vietnamese instead
of communist guerillas because it permits the U.S.
to fight "our kind of war." he stated. Triska added
the U.S. preferred the "clean and fast" air war to
the "dirty, guerilla war."
The professor said he still thought "it is an at
tcmpt by us to permit for future negotiations.
"WE HAVE BEEN there a long time and are
afraid to get out because we are afraid to lose
face. There are several alternatives: to extend it
or to get out. The third is to extend it in order to
terminate it."
This is what: the U.S. is doing, according to
Triska. "We have chosen to determine" that the
North Vietnamese arc the basic U.S.South Viet
namese enemies in this instance "in such a way
that our own response would be as satisfactory for
our own policy goals."
Triska thinks that the U.S. wants to be pres
sured into negotiations through world opinion,
and that the danger to peace created by the Vict
Nam crisis would create this pressure.
"WE WANT NEGOTIATION suggested to us
by many others," he said.
Also at Stanford, the Peace Caucus, the So
cialist Caucus, and the Graduate Coordinating Com
mittee, are sponsoring a rally today at 11:45 a.m.
in the White Memorial Plaza on a "Declaration of
Conscience on Viet Nam."
The "Declaration" is a paper circulated by sev
eral national peace groups stating its signers will
not support the continuation of the war iti South
east Asia.
Speakers at the rally will include Dr. Christian
IJay, Roy Kepler and Iru Sandperl.
