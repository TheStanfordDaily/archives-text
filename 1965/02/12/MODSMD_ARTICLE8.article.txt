# LASSU MEETING
## Morality Issue Still Uncertain 
### JUSTIN BECK 
The Legislature tip-toed up to the "morality" issue once again
last night, and quickly tip-toed away, hearing President Scott Mc-
Bride's report on the opinions of the University legal counsel.
Mcßride told the Legislature that he felt that Kadane's resolu
tion ot two weeks ago would "eliminate the Honor Code," put the

students at the mercy of the-
Deans, and establish two separate
judicial procedures for students.
In commenting on Jay Kadane's
morality resolution, which was
changed in the process to a bill,
Mcßride implied that the Univer
sity can enforce any unwritten
policy it wishes, and such was the
procedure followed in cases in
voking sexual violations.
HOWEVER, HE also said that
if opinion was against a Univer
sity policy that he didn't "think
that they could effectively en
force" it. But he feared that if the
students did not enforce these un
written University policies, then
the Deans' Office could, without
the case "being tried at a student
level."
Representative Bill O'Connell of
Humanities and Sciences asked
the President if the Legislature
interpreted the Fundamental Stan
dard, as is its right according to
the Board of Trustees, then could
the Administration, which repre
sents the Board of Trustees inter
pret the Fundamental Standard
differently.
McBRIDE ANSWERED that
the University legal council
pointed out that the ASSU Con
stitution does not state 1 hat the
Legislature has "sole" right to in
terpret the Fundamental Stan
dard.
However, Kadane's bill was re
ferred to the By-Laws Committee
along with another bill introduced
by Kadane and Steve Stern, chair
man of the Judicial Reform Com
mittee. which also defines Judicial
Council jurisdiction.
In other action, the Legislature
referred a resolution calling for
weekly meetings to the Rules
Committee, and a. bill appropriat
ing $1,000 for publications to the
Publications Board. LASSU de
nied an $850 appropriation to the
Graduate Student Associate to
provide for graduate publications.
THE DAILY received an ap
propriation of $384.80 to make up
for overtime expenses incurred in
the publication of the Crow-Hal
verso n report. The student fi
nancial manager opposed that ac
tion on the grounds that The
Daily had a profit sharing plan.

The Legislature tip-toed up to the "morality" issue once again
last night, and quickly tip-toed away, hearing President Scott Mc-
Bride's report on the opinions of the University legal counsel.
Mcßride told the Legislature that he felt that Kadane's resolu
tion ot two weeks ago would "eliminate the Honor Code," put the

students at the mercy of the-
Deans, and establish two separate
judicial procedures for students.
In commenting on Jay Kadane's
morality resolution, which was
changed in the process to a bill,
Mcßride implied that the Univer
sity can enforce any unwritten
policy it wishes, and such was the
procedure followed in cases in
voking sexual violations.
HOWEVER, HE also said that
if opinion was against a Univer
sity policy that he didn't "think
that they could effectively en
force" it. But he feared that if the
students did not enforce these un
written University policies, then
the Deans' Office could, without
the case "being tried at a student
level."
Representative Bill O'Connell of
Humanities and Sciences asked
the President if the Legislature

dard, as is its right according to

the Administration, which repre
sents the Board of Trustees inter
pret the Fundamental Standard
differently.
