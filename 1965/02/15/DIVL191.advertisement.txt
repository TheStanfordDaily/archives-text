Words from the
Eternal Christ
"The Lord possessed me in the beginning of I lis way, before
His works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning,
or ever the earth was. When there were no depths. I was brought
forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. Before
the mountains were settled before the hills, was 1 brought forth ; while
as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part
of the dust of the world. When He prepared the heavens, I was
there: when He set compass upon the face of the depth: When He
established the clouds above: when lie strengthened the fountains
of the deep: W hen He gave to the sea His decree, that the waters
should not pass His commandment: when He appointed the foun
dation of the earth: Then I was by Him, as One brought up with
Him: and T was daily His delight, rejoicing always before Him;
Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth; and my delights were
with the sons of men.
"Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children, for blessed
are they that keep my ways. Hear instruction, and be wise, and
I refuse is not. Blessed is the man that hcareth me, watching daily
at my gates; waiting at the posts of my doors. For whoso findeth
me findeth life; and shall obtain favour of the Lord. But He that
sinneth against me wrongeth His own soul: all they that hate me
love death" ( Proverbs 8:22-36)
"1 am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith
the Lord which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Al
mighty ... 1 am the first and the last. 1 am 1 le that liveth, and was
dead; and behold, 1 am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the
keys of hell and death" (Revelation 1 :8,17,18)
Won't you accept God's gift of eternal life nowâ€”
"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever"
(Hebrews 13:8).
