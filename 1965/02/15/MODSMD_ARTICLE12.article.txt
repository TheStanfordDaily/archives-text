### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Miko Wall and Mark Parmely
added two more bright lights to
Stanford's freshman swimming
team's sparkle as they both bet
tered the NCAA freshman record
for 500 yards freestyle last Fri

day. The Papooses hoarded 10 oft
11 firsts to drown Chieo State. I
71-24.
The varsity did not fare so well
against NCAA champion i
Southern Cal. The Trojans held, |
70-25, scooping up all but two
event wins.
Stanford rebounded on Satur
day, treading on visiting Utah, 55 j
40. Utah is the defending Western ,
Athletic Conference champion.
WALL'S RECORD time was a
swift 5:00.7. Parmely nudged the
old mark of 5:02.6 by a tenth ol'
a second.
John Kesler broke his seeond
freshman record against Chieo
State, sloshing for 200 yards on
his baek in 2:08.3. Bill Meyer won !
the 50 and 100 freestyle sprints
and swam in the winning free
style relay. Bob Mornsen came
through as a double winner, win
ning the breaststroke and individ
ual medley races.
USC, WITH Olympians galore
in every niche of the lineup,
clinched the meet after the eighth
event. Bill Derrig salvaged th e
only Stanford swimming win, tak
ing the 50 freestyle in 22.7. John
Vandervelde laid out a Stanford
diving triumph.
Southern Cal's Willeford, for
mer NCAA 500 frosh record
holder, swam the 500 moments
after Wall and Parmely erased
his record. Willeford finished in
5:01.6.
Utah presented another serious
threat to the Indians' already sag
ging record .Coach Jim Gaughran
â€”

| calculated that Stanford would
I need both relays as well as top
performances from every man
down the line.
JIM LANEY and Bill Derrig
I were the ones to fill the bill.
Laney turned in a 53.2 split in
the butterfly leg of the medley
relay to give Stanford the decisive
' margin. A scant ten minutes later
he came back to win the gruelling
i 200 individual medley.
Derrig won the 50 freestyle, led
a 1-2 Stanford sweep in the 100
freestyle, and led off the winning
freestyle relay. Laney was the an
-1 chor man on the freestyle tandem.

| STANFORD led all the way,
(boasting a 41-20 lead after the
i 100 freestyle, the seventh event.
Setbacks in the next two events
left Stanford with a 45-31 lead go
ing into the breaststroke.
Ukka Suvanto, who had earlier
won the 200 butterfly in 2:03.0,
was touched out for first in the
1200 breaststroke, the second-to
last race. Suvanto's 3 points for
j second place were good enough,
I however, to assure a Stanford vic
! tory.
The freestyle relay turned out
1 to be Cardinal frosting on a Salt
: Lake cake.
