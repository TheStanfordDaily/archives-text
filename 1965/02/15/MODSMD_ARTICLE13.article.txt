# Ruggers Record Fifth Win As USC Succombs, 20-0
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Led by the kicking of Dick
Ragsdale and a defensive scrum
that dominated the entire game,
the Stanford Rugby team rolled
to its fifth straight win Satur
day, defeating the USC Trojans
20-0 in Los Angeles.
The game was played on a field
somewhat smaller than the con
ventional rugby field and this
factor helped USC to contain the
usually effective Stanford run
ning game. USC was hurt by an
athletic department ruling which
does not allow football players to
play on the rugby team.
RAGSDALE opened the scor
ing with a 30-yard penalty kick.
Then scrum man Bob Rath fell on
;a USC fumble in the end zone to
, make the score 6-0. At the end of
: the first half Ragsdale kicked
J another penalty kick, this time
; from 25 yards, and Stanford led
| at halftime, 9-0.
Early in the second half Card
hooker, John Faber, picked up a
ball from a loose scrum and ran
15 yards for a try. Ragsdale
! kicked the conversion. Shortly
afterward Ragsdale kicked a 20-
yard running drop kick and fol
lowed this with another penahy
kick. This gave him 14 points for
the day and made the final score
20-0. The Stanford scrum, which
i completely prevailed in the first
half, had a tougher time in the
! second period with the scrappy
USC team, but the Trojans were
never able to muster an effective
j offensive attack.
Coach Pete Kmetovic was gen
erally pleased with the team's per
| formance. Afler the game lie com
i mented, "I felt that they let down
a little in the second half as they

| found the going a little easier,
iWe will have to put together a
; complete game next week to beat
UCLA. UCLA played very well in
a 17-11 loss to California last
week." 'Kmetovic praised the
offensive play of Dan Terpack
and the kicking of Ragsdale. He
also singled out Eric Degooyer
and freshman Blaine Nye for
their fine lineout play.
KMETOVIC feels that this
year's team compares favorably
with last season's championship
squad. Although the Cards lack
most of last year's backfield, the
team has a talented and experi
enced scrum. Next week's game
with UCLA should be an indica
tion of how the Indians will fare
in the coming "Big Game Scrum
Axe" series with California. The
first game of the home and home
series will be played at Stanford
February 27.
The two Stanford JV rugby
teams also scored victories this
weekend. The number one JV
team defeated the Cal Davis rug-
I gers 16-3 behind the standout
offensive and defensive play of
i Gary Pettigrew. The second JV's
j beat the Davis second team 14-9.
Jim Rowles led the victors with
| two tries, both on 20-yard runs.
