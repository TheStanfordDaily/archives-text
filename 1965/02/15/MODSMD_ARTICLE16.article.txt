# The 						Quality Of Courage
## 
### 
Yesterday Stanford took a painful but firm
step towards becoming that which it lias always
professed to be — a truly great University.
In the past week, the University has under
gone a trial by ordeal — has endured that ordeal,
and iu enduring affirmed its ability to conduct
the kind of agonizing self-appraisal which is so
necessary to true and continual progress.
It may seem unwarranted to talk of the events
c>f the past week, culminating in the resignation
of the Dean of Women, in terms of progress, but
progress there has been.
Too often we speak of the progress ol an aca
demic institution in terms of acquisition — the
garnering of funds, the construction of new build
ings, the accumulation of honors and plaudits.
But true progress is more subtle. It is a func
tion of courage — the courage required to speak
the truth though the truth be painful — the cour
age required to act from a commitment to prin
ciple rather than from a desire to "save face."
In his words and actions of the past days Presi
dent Sterling has show n such courage.
His immediate decision to refer this matter to
the Academic Council demonstrated the wisdom
and decisiveness so necessary to an effective ad
ministrator and the confidence in the faculty so
important in a leader of an academic commu
nity.
These are the abilities of leadership that
seemed so noticeably lacking in the Cal admin
istration during its handling of the FSM contro
versy.
The faculty, in turn, responded to the Presi
dent's gesture of confidence with energy and un
derstanding — understanding which at once
recognized the crucial nature of the issues in
vovled and the ethical prerogative of the faculty

as a whole to deal with these issues directly.
The University' unswerving affirmation of aca
demic freedom stands as a monument to the force
of united faculty concern.
The character and quality of the response
from both faculty and administration should, one
hopes, act as a challenge to the student and as
a reminder that the affirmation of principle and
truth must be a continual process in which there
are no simple "victories.
At this point one feels a natural desire to seek
some return to "normalcy. To do so, however,
would be to render the events of the last week
meaningless.
What is demanded now is a recognition that
what has happened is not an end but a begin
ning. What is demanded now, of the students in
particular, is an increased application of courage
—the intellectual courage to think in boldly
Utopian terms, to discuss and to question, and
to begin to form some understanding of the na
ture of the process of education in which they
are so totally emmersed.
It will take courage for the student to reject
the secure image of himself as a "citizen in
training." It will take courage to accept the re
sponsibility that comes with the awareness that
there are 110 "inevitable circumstances" or "irre
versible trends," but only human action and inac
tion.
If he wishes, the student may choose not to
act — may choose to accept "what is" rather than
fight for "what might be."
But this would be a shame. For education
itself is nothing if it is not founded on the active
belief that it is only through the thought and ac
tions of individual human beings that "what
might be is transformed into reality.
