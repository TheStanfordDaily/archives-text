Executive Committee of the Academic Council and President
Wallace Stirling oi Stanford University:
In May, 1964 there was a meeting of Women's Council and deans
of women. Issues arising from that meeting were brought to the
attention of the Executive Committee of the Academic Council and
to the President of the University at 4 p.m. on Monday, February 1.
The Executive Committee appointed a sub-committee to investigate
these issues. The sub-committee began its investigation on Wednes
day, February 3, and submitted its report to the Executive Commit
tee and to the President of the University on Thursday, February 11.
The report was accepted.
The President and the Executive Committee have recognized and
considered the arguments in favor of publishing the report; they
have also recognized and considered the arguments in favor of re
specting the private interests of the individuals concerned. As a result
of these considerations, the President and the Executive Committee
have concluded that, despite their earlier decision to publish, the
report will not be released for publication.
It will be accessible upon request as a privileged and confidential
communication to the following members of the University commu
nity: the Advisory Board of the Academic Council, Academic Deans,
the Executive Head of the English Department, the Dean of Students,
the President and Vice President of ASSU, the Speaker of LASSU,
the president of the Associated Women Students, and the chairman
of Men's Council and the chairman of the Women's Council. The I
President and the Executive Committee have also concluded that in
stead of publishing the report, they will make the following state
ment:
1. The report of the subcommittee was based on interviews with
all participants in the May 1964 meeting as well as with others who j
had information on collaterally relevant matters. The members of
the sub-committee were impressed with the evident sincerity and good
faith of all the persons interviewed. There were inevitable difficulties
in recall of an event which occurred nine months earlier, but the
sub-committee believes that it was able to reconstruct key points
of the May 1964 discussion.
2. In the sub-committee's inquiry, no person charged either that
the general level of attention to sexual matters in English courses
is excessive or inappropriate or that there has been sexual miscon
duct between teachers in the English Department and students.
The President of the University affirms that to his knowledge
no charges of sexual misconduct have been lodged against any
teacher in the English Department during the sixteen years of his!
term as President.
3. The President and the Executive Committee reassert the long-1
standing and unwavering commitment of this University to the prin
ciple of academic freedom the right of scholars to think, write,
teach, and learn in an atmosphere of free inquiry.
In particular, they wish to emphasize that commitment to aca
demic freedom requires that questions concerning the content and
conduct of courses should not be investigated except by appropriate
academic authorities.
4. Recognition of the need for improvement of the judicial process
had already led to the appointment by the President of a special
student-faculty committee under the chairmanship of Dean Wert.
The charge of this Committee is to study this matter and formulate
recommendations for improvement; its work is well under way.
The report of the sub-committee emphasizes the urgency of meet
ing this need.
5. Other needs concerning communication and relationships with
in the University community should be studied and met. One pressing
problem, highlighted by the subcommittee report, is that members
of the community are uncertain or uninformed as to where a sugges
tion or grievance may be brought for appropriate attention.
The President will appoint a special committee representing stu
dents, faculty, and University officers to study this and related prob-1
lems and make recommendations for meeting them.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Following' is the text oi a statement by tlw
Executive Committee of the Academic Council and President
Wallace Stirling oi Stanford University:
In May, 1964 there was a meeting of Women's Council and deans
of women. Issues arising from that meeting were brought to the
attention of the Executive Committee of the Academic Council and
to the President of the University at 4 p.m. on Monday, February 1.
The Executive Committee appointed a sub-committee to investigate
these issues. The sub-committee began its investigation on Wednes
day, February 3, and submitted its report to the Executive Commit
tee and to the President of the University on Thursday, February 11.
The report was accepted.
The President and the Executive Committee have recognized and
considered the arguments in favor of publishing the report; they
have also recognized and considered the arguments in favor of re
specting the private interests of the individuals concerned. As a result
of these considerations, the President and the Executive Committee
have concluded that, despite their earlier decision to publish, the
report will not be released for publication.
It will be accessible upon request as a privileged and confidential
communication to the following members of the University commu
nity: the Advisory Board of the Academic Council, Academic Deans,
the Executive Head of the English Department, the Dean of Students,
the President and Vice President of ASSU, the Speaker of LASSU,
the president of the Associated Women Students, and the chairman
of Men's Council and the chairman of the Women's Council. The I
President and the Executive Committee have also concluded that in
stead of publishing the report, they will make the following state
ment:
1. The report of the subcommittee was based on interviews with
all participants in the May 1964 meeting as well as with others who j
had information on collaterally relevant matters. The members of
the sub-committee were impressed with the evident sincerity and good
faith of all the persons interviewed. There were inevitable difficulties
in recall of an event which occurred nine months earlier, but the
sub-committee believes that it was able to reconstruct key points
of the May 1964 discussion.
2. In the sub-committee's inquiry, no person charged either that
the general level of attention to sexual matters in English courses
is excessive or inappropriate or that there has been sexual miscon
duct between teachers in the English Department and students.
The President of the University affirms that to his knowledge
no charges of sexual misconduct have been lodged against any
teacher in the English Department during the sixteen years of his!
term as President.
3. The President and the Executive Committee reassert the long-1
standing and unwavering commitment of this University to the prin
ciple of academic freedom the right of scholars to think, write,
teach, and learn in an atmosphere of free inquiry.
In particular, they wish to emphasize that commitment to aca
demic freedom requires that questions concerning the content and
conduct of courses should not be investigated except by appropriate
academic authorities.
4. Recognition of the need for improvement of the judicial process
had already led to the appointment by the President of a special
student-faculty committee under the chairmanship of Dean Wert.
The charge of this Committee is to study this matter and formulate
recommendations for improvement; its work is well under way.
The report of the sub-committee emphasizes the urgency of meet
ing this need.
5. Other needs concerning communication and relationships with
in the University community should be studied and met. One pressing
problem, highlighted by the subcommittee report, is that members
of the community are uncertain or uninformed as to where a sugges
tion or grievance may be brought for appropriate attention.
The President will appoint a special committee representing stu
dents, faculty, and University officers to study this and related prob-1
lems and make recommendations for meeting them.
