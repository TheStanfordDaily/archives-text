## Students Do Have Many Freedoms 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Your editorial "An Aphorism A
Day..has destroyed anything
that was left of my will to resist
speaking out against an attitude
which has been getting under my
skin throughout, four years at
Stanford. I am sick and tired of
listening to Stanford students
complain about how underpri
vileged they are! Would someone
please show me a coeducational
university of comparable stature
which offers its students more
personal freedom and more oppor
tunity to accept adult responsi
bility.
Anyone who feels he has the
"right" to attend one of the finest
universities in the world is badly
in need of some serious instruc
tion, lest, he succumb to the
equally erroneous assumption
that the world owes him a living.
Ask one of the 5600 students who
were turned away last year
whether he thinks a Stanford
education is a right or a privilege.
I think it is about time we stop
ped crying and counted our bles
sings for a change.
As for the students maturity
which you speak of: Do you seri
ously believe that in that Ihree
months between our high school
graduation and our first quarter
at college we suddenly blossomed
into adulthood? Do you honestly
feel that your one example, the
action taken from "Mississippi to
East Palo Alto," is "obvious evi
dence" of student maturity? Are
you really trying to convince us
that since the contention that
"Attendance at this University is
a privilege and not a right" is a
"stubborn statement" that it is
therefore invalid? Do you really
mean to imply that most Ameri
cans look upon a student as
"something less than a person?"
Are you seriously trying to tell us
that the Administration ever

"regards students as a necessary
evil?"
As you so aptly quoted presi
dent Sterling, "Any element of
any institution must be able to
ju s ti 112 y its existence." 1 don't
think I am speaking just for
myself when 1 say that perhaps
the editorial "element" of the
Daily "institution" should display
a little more maturity of thought
and expression in order to justify
its existence.

Editor, The Daily:
In the February 10th Daily, MY.
Dave Casto, Director of the Uni
versity Land and Development
Program, stated that the Portola
Valley planning consultant "h a s
dealt too much with aesthetics
and not enough with economics"
in suggesting that Stanford land
be left open for scenic and recrea
tional purposes.
In the last ten years 1 have
seen the peninsula devastated in
the interest of economics. It is
surprising that Mr. Casto has not
yet seen the possibilities of zon
ing Palm Drive for commercial
operations. I suggest that Mr.
Casto establish at least one de
cent nature trail before leasing
the foothills to the subdividers. 1
for one am not satisfied simply
looking at the green on a dollar
bill.
