• Saigon Stabilizes Government
SAIGON, South Vict Nam - Phan Huy Quat, a native of what
is now the Communist North, was reported last night to have fonned

who had won the approval of feuding religious and political factions,
including the Buddhists.
• Hanoi Claims JSeiv Attach
TOKYO — North Viet Nam charged two U.S.-South Vietnamese
ships shelled one of its villages yesterday in what it called a new act
of provocation against the Hanoi regime. Radio Hanoi said both craft
were set afire by gunfire from North Vietnamese troops.
The broadcast .monitored here, made no mention of North Vietna
mese damage or casualties.
• Communist Reaction Still Awaited
WASHINGTON — The surge in Communist declarations of unity
following U.S. air reprisals on North Viet Nam appeared yesterday
to be causing little surprise among Washington officials.
What remains to be seen, they said, is what deeds Moscow, Peking
and Hanoi will perform behind their barrage of words.
The Red propaganda so far, while tough sounding, has been not
able for its vagueness. It. also has been less shrill in proportion to
the distance away from the scene of hositilities in Viet Nam.
U.S. sources declined to draw from this a conclusion that the
Communist powers will do nothing in response to the air strikes.
