### 
The Stanford-World University
Service released today the details
of its projected 1%.") summer proj
ect in Hong Kong, a British
Crown Colony on the coast of
China. A program for all inter
ested students, will bo held on
Tuesday, February 16, ;it 7:1">
p.m. in the small lounge of Tresid
der Memorial Union.
Volunteers from the 1963 and
1061 summer projects will de
scribe their activities and impres
sions of the Hong Kong experi
ence. Dean Dwight Clark, WUS
faculty advisor and two-year vet
eran on the project, will also ad
dress prospective volunteers. Fol
lowing announcement of plans for
the 1963 project, slides will be
presented and a film illustrating
the conditions of the colony will
be shown after the meeting to
those interested.
The project includes a two-week
stopover in Japan and several
days in Taiwan, both as guests
rii the 11.11 i•»11.»I WUS or-'aiii/a

lions. Application forms, already
obtainable in the Dean of Men's
office on Inner Quad, will be avail
able at this time along with gen
eral information sheets.
Veteran WUS volunteer Jim
Baxter enumerated the various
projects on which Stanford stu
dents have labored: English teach
ing teams for students of all ages,
but principally of college age,
since mastery of English is virtu
ally the basis for any plans of a
Chinese in Hong Kong to improv e
his condition; work with children
within refugee resettlement units
as teachers and recreational
supervisors; work with mission
ary doctors as assistants a n d
nurses.
These and other projects place
the volunteers in intense person
to person contact v\ith the popula
tion. Lodging and eating condi
tions for many workers, although
rarely as poor as those of the
refugees, are frequently very
limited when compared to those
on the Stanford campus.
