Amid traditional color and spon
taneous humor, the Stanford

! nual General Assembly session
I Saturday.
Continuing throughout th e
! morning and afternoon, the pro-
I gram was guided In' the efforts of
I Stuart Novick, the Secretary-Gen
i eral, and Steve Dobbs, General As
sembly President.
TOPPING Tin: list of approved
measures were the call for a
plebiscite in Southern Rhodesia
land the request for a cease-fire
and international conference on
; tlie Vietnam turmoil. Also passed
; were resolutions seeking prefer
ential trade agreements for de
veloping countries and urging ex
' pansion of the Security Council.
Heading the defeated motions
j was India's proposal granting
| recognition by the United Nations
j to the People's Republic of China
: as the "only legitimate representa

tives of China in the. United
Nations."
THE REPRESENTATIVE of
the United States praised the or
ganization, stating "never in the
history of the world has there
been an organization with such a
broad base of international sup
port." But he cited the question of
enforcement of the Charter as "a
most grave crisis which threatens
to shake ihe organization to its
very core." He implied that re
fusal to enforce Russia's financial
obligations, or the admission of
Rod China woidd be strongly re
pugnant lo the United States,
though he mentioned neither na
tion by name.
Russia served early notice that
it would oppose any attempts to
enforce what it called "the spectre
of Article 19." She stated that she
had "exhaustively demonstrated
that no legal grounds exist for the
compulsory collection of ihe so
called debts, ostensibly accumu
lated by the USSR.
