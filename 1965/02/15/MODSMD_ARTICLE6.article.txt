### DOUG OHMANS 
Dean Lucille A. Allen has requested a terminal leave of absence
as clean of women and as associate professor of education, effec
tive immediately, according to a statement released by President
Wallace Sterling last night.
"1 have granted the request," he said.
President Sterling's statement accompanied a brief report by
the Executive Committee of the Academic Council. The report
concerned the results of the subcommittee's investigatory study
of student judiciary-administration relations. The text of the state
ment is reprinted in full on page four.
Publication of the longer twelve-page document is being with
held "as a privileged and confidential communication ... in favor
of respecting the private. 1 interests of the individuals concerned.
The Academic Council subcommittee was headed by Gerald
Gunther, Stanford professor of law. Also included were Sanford
M. Dombitsch, executive head and professor of sociology, and
Kenneth J. Arrow, professor of economics and professor of sta
tistics.
Dornbusch said ol the Academic Council release, "The short
statement is completely faithful to the spirit of our longer docu
ment."
The Academic Council release had five major points:
• The sub-committee appreciated "the evident sincerity and
good faith of all the persons interviewed."
• There is no evidence that the "general level of attention to
sexual matters is excessive or inappropriate that there has been
sexual misconduct between teachers in the English Department
and students."
• The President and the Executive Committee reassert their
commitment to the principle of academic freedom.
• A student-faculty committee will attempt to improve the
judicial process.
• A special Presidential committee of students, faculty, and
University officers will be appointed to study the problem of how
suggestions or grievances should be aired.
Nora Crow and Darrell llalversou, the student co-authors oi
the original Student Judiciary-Administration report to LASSU,
made the following statement:
"We should like to commend the Executive Committee of
the Academic Council for its prompt and careful investigation
of the issues raised in our report.
We appreciate especially the recognition of "the need for
improvement of the judicial process" and "other needs con
cerning communication and relationships within the Univer
sity community." We think the articulation of the Univer
sity's position on academic freedom and judicial reform is
perhaps more meaningful than any specific action proceeding
from the investigation.
We recognize that this official statement begins a dialogue
between students and administrators which must at last be
salutary for the University.
We believe that the events of the past few weeks reflect
the intelligence and responsibility of the administrators, fac
ulty members, and students who responded to our report.
