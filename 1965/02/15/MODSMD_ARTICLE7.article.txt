# OSU NIPS STANFORD, AS...
## Tribe Splits Weekend Series 
### TOM EDISON 
Playing erratic bull both Fri
day and Saturday nights, I he
Stanford basketball team was
first tripped by a slow-moving
Oregon State offense, 17-1.1, on
the pr e s s u r e react ions of Jim
Jams, but then rebounded to
stage its own surge which toppled
Oregon, 73-(j2.
The outcome of both games was
not decided until the latter min
utes but both lacked any real lus
ter. Indian highlight of Hie week
end was the 48-point total con
tribution of Bob Bedell and the
overall hustle against Oregon
which almost makes the many
mental errors excusable.
.VAIIVIK' niVDIY outside
shooting provided some excitment
for the onlookers but little was
contributed by an Indian. Bob
Bedell made 2.1 points but his
eve was the only one on the bas
ket.
Although Oregon State led the
entire first half, Stanford came
storming back after the half
time break and took the lead
away from the Beavers on nine
straight joints by Bedell.
Oregon State never led by
more than four points in the first
half and the score was knotted up
five times. Oregon State led 2G-23
at the half.
WITH KKDKIJ/S scoring the
Indians gained a live-point advan

ten and a half minutes left in the
second half.
After a time-out if was all Jar
vis. He scored 13 out of Oregon's
last 1 1 points and put them ahead
for keeps on ;i steal and lay-up
with just over two minutes left
in the game. The little scoring
wonder from Corvallis astound
ingly garnered Hi out of OSl"s 21
second-half points, most of them
on shots of 2.1 feet or more.
Stanford made an effort to
catch Jarvis but a one minute

stall was successfully used by the
Beavers to douse any spark the
Indians hoped would set their
scoring ablaze once more.
( OACH HOWIE Dallmar was
so impressed by Jarvis that all
he could say about him was that
"he was great."
In Saturday night's contest the
tempo of action increased a little
but inaecuarate shooting by Ore
gon and ineffective rebounding by
Stanford contributed to an unsuc
cessful performance both for the
fans in the Pavilion and those
viewing the game on television.
The lead changed 15 times in
the first half and ended with
Stanford barely holding the edge
at 32-31. However, with a lay-up
by Kosanke and four straight
points by Hinckley the Indians be
gan to pull out and away from
Oregon. Stanford never relin-
