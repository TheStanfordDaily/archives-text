The Proof of God's Love
Did you know that the Bible says —
''Everyone who really believes that Jesus is the Christ proves
himself one of God's family. The man who loves the Father can
not help loving the Father's own Son. The test of the genuiness of
our love for (iod's family lies in this question—do we love God Him
self and do we obey I lis commands? For loving God means obeying
His commands, and these commands of His are not burdensome,
for God's "heredity" within us will always conqueor the world
outside un. In fact thi> faith of ours is the only way in which the i
world has been conquered. For who could ever be said to conquer the
world,in the true sense, except the man who really believes that
Jesus is God's Son? Jesus Christ Himself is the one who came by
water and by blood —not by water only, but by the water and the
blood. The Spirit bears witness to this, for the Spirit is the truth.
J The witness therefore is a triple one—the Spirit in our own hearts,
; the signs of the water of baptism and the blood of atonement — and
i they all say the same thing. If we are prepared to accept human \
testimony, God's own testimony concerning His Son is surely infi- ;
nitely more valuable. The man who really believes in the Son of
: God will find God's testimony in hi> own heart. The man who will
not believe God is making Him out to be a liar, because he is del
: iberately refusing to accept that God lia.s given concerning His own
| Son. 'I'/uil is, that Cod has given men life and this real life is to be j
I found only in His Son. It follows naturally that any man who has i
! genuine contact with Christ has this life; and if he has not, then he !
does not possess this life at all. I have written like this to you who j
already believe in the name of (iod's Son so that you may be quite j
sure that, here and now, you posses eternal life" (I John 5:1-13 j
