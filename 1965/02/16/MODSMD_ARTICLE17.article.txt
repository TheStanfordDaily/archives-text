# Stanford Baseballers To Open Season Today Against USF Dons
## 
### ROBERT THIERIOT 
Stanford's varsity baseballers
initiate the 1965 season today
| when they open against USF at 3
' p.m. on the Sunken Diamond,
j John Mason will climb (he hill
for the Indians.
This year's squad should pro
| duce a fine season. Experience,
J particularly in the pitching staff,
i will account for much improve

tment over last year's losing rec
i ord. Superior front-line pitching,
a fine defensive outfield, and
catcher Jim Hibbs represent the
team's strong points.
MUCH OF THE Indian's off
ense will have to depend on Hibbs.
He led last year's team in virtu
ally every batting department,
batting .351. Until the other hit
lers such as Pete Middlekauff
.280, and George Thatcher .295, be
gin connecting, Hibbs will have
lo carry the team.
Problems facing the team are
a lack of consistent hitting at
j third and short. Lack of pitching
; below the front lino may plague

| coach Dutch Fehring throughout
: the season, unless he finds some-1
one to fill the spots.
As clean of the pitching corps,
j John Mason does not boast a fan
tastic varsity record. Last year he
only won two games, bul carved !
a neat 2.99 era. But lie throws j
hard, has gained experience, and
coach Fehring feels that ho will
be great.
SOUTHPAW Jim Blachke a n d
Daro Quiring also are slated 1o
i see action in today's tilt.
' Quiring is only a sophomore. Last
year on the frosh he was the ace
| of the staff, collecting seven vic
tories and averaging close to ten
; strikeouts per game.
Short and third find two more
sophomores attempting to fill
j spots vacated by graduation. Dick '
Swan at short flashes a sparkling
glove and rapped opposing hurl
ers for .375. Mike Ottmar batted
.392 last year.
Much of how the team will fair
this year depends on these two
boys' performances at the plate.
The squad lacks some depth, but.
has an abundance of experience
at most positions.
Freshman baseball will open Its j
season this Saturday, when they ,
entertain the Santa Clara Broncos
i here. Coach Ray Young cites the!
I infield as the team's strong point i
! on defense.
He feels that if his team can ;
; make few mistakes, they will be |
' able to win many low scoring
close games. Like the varsity,!
the pitching is fairly strong but j
no depth, with hurlers Frank
: Klinger, Charlie Rvan, and Bill i
i Holt.
In the batting department, the'
j team is not overpowering, but sev
;eral boys could blossom into very
capable batters.
