### JUSTIN BECK Executive Editor 
The LASSU By-Laws Commit- j
tee will hold open hearings to
night in Room 271 of Tresidder,
to discuss possible changes in j
ASSU judicial procedure.
The committee is currently con- i
sidering three pieces of legisla-â€¢
lion, the Judicial system, includ
ing one establishing optional jury j
trials for students accused of vio- i
lations.
CARL HILLENBRAND, law
school graduate student and com
mittee chairman, commented thai
although judicial reform is being j
considered by several student-fac
ulty-administration committees, |
"the Legislature is the best rep- :
rcsentative of student body opin-!
ion and only it can change the
ASSU judicial structure and pro !
cedures."
lie predicted that if the Legisla
ture enacts responsible changes!
in this area that they will be ac- j
septed by the Board of Trustees. \
All members of the University
community, including faculty and j
administrators, who have valid
comments to make on proposed)
changes in the judicial system
are invited to speak to the com-j
mittee, he said.
BILLS SUBMITTED to the By-
Laws Committee by the Legisla
ture include the Kadane resolu- j
tion on morality, the Kadane-
Stern bill, further defining the
tion of judicial councils and giv
ing the Legislature sole author
ity to determine what University
policies may be enforced by the
judicial council. There is also the
Feldman bill establishing certain i
safeguards, including jury trial
for students.
Some amendments to Kadane-
Stern bill ,further defining the
powers of the Legislature in judi
cial matters and the authority of
judicial councils are expected, it
was learned yesterday.
If the Kadanc-Stern bill re-;
ceives legislative approval, judi
cial councils may punish a student
only for violations of state, fed
eral or municipal ordinance, such
University policy as have been
approved by the Legislature,
Honor Code, and Ihe ASSU Con
stitution and By-Laws.
