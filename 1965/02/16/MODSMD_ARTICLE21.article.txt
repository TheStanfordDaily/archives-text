## Viet Nam Negotiations Urged 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Because news reports from Viet
nam are conflicting and confused,
there are many students w ho,
fearful of making the wrong com
mitment, have decided to make
none. They are not convinced that
the North Vietnamese arc inno
cent of aiding the Vietcong, they
are afraid that if we should with-;
draw our troops we would be
abandoning South Vietnam to Chi- j
nese domination, and they are)
hopeful that our present policy of
raiding North Vietnam in retalia
tion to Vietcong attacks will
frighten the communists into a
negotiated peace on our terms.
On the other hand, they listen
with horror to reports of tortures
which we condone; they suspect
that the majority of the Vietna
mese resent our presence in their
country, and they believe that a
nuclear war would be a cat astro-1
phe which no requirements of pol- 1
icy could justify.
All of u.s have two main con-!
cerns in this situation: first, that
the threat of nuclear war be re
moved; and, second, that the
people of Vietnam lie enabled to
choose their own government |
peacefully. It seems that neither)
we nor the communists will with- j
draw from our commitments, and
yet another Korea, after perhaps j
years of death and misery, will
probably end in another stale-;
mate.
Neither side could benefit from I
war; neither side desires war, yet j
because defeat would be unthink- j
able for both sides, only the most
determined action by the people j
of all the countries of the world
can prevent one. Whatever our;
confusion, we can be sure that I
war will neither reduce the threat
of nuclear war nor allow the Viet- j
namese to live in peace and de
mocracy, and we can commit our
selves at least to a policy of ne
gotiations to guarantee the neu

trality and autonomy of South j
Vietnam.
If we do not commit ourselves :
now we must accept responsibility j
for whatever tragedy results,
from our present policy. There:
are two petitions being circulated !
which are designed to put pres- j
sure on our government to desist
from provocations which may
lead to war.
The effect of these petitions
will be to convince our leaders
that we will not support; a war in
Vietnam and that another solu
tion must be found. Despite our
uncertainty, this much, I believe,
most of us can accept. 1 urge you
lo sign at least one of the peti
tions in White Memorial Plaza.

• Why Hesitate —
Editor, The Daily:
It seems extraordinary that we
have not heard the siren call of
revolution, e o m in g either from
the Graduate Coordinating Com
mittee or from others among the
interested. Gentlemen, you hesi- j
late unneedfully.
There is a question which has j
not been asked: will the appear- i
a nee of the LASSU Judicial Re- !
port mark the beginning of a con
tinuing and directed effort on the i
part of students to bring about ,
change within the University? Ii
suggest that this would be some- i
thing new. In the past, there have
been those few who did desire j
revolution, but they were the few, j
a species of the Nine Unknown
Men, keeping knowledge, and
thus power, cached away as se
cret. Yet revolutions, led by the j
few, are made by the many.
Six hundred years ago, Etienne
de la Boetie observed that the
will of a tyrant gains sway only
through the acquiescence of his
subjects, for "a people enslaves '

l itself, cuts its own throat, when,
; having a choice between being
; vassals and being free men, it
| deserts its liberties and takes on
the yoke, gives consent to its own
misery, or, rather, apparently
j welcomes it."
Those that Boetie spoke had no
choice because there was no vis
ion, no "revolutionary conscious
ness," no Utopia to channel the
forces of discontent to bring on
change. Before men will desert
the yoke, they must have a taste
of liberty, and an idea of what
freedom can be like.
• The great questions of academic
freedom and student rights, and
the greater question of whether
the "contradiction of the college"
can be resolved from within the
college itself, are overshadowed
by the greatest question of all:
will the few now lead the many,
inform them, talk to them, talk
with them, awaken them, call
| them to the revolution which is
yet unborn? Gentlemen, they wait
upon us.

• Give Me Liberty
Editor, The Daily:
Lewis Gray, Tom O'Neal a n d
j Ken Malovos should count their
j blessings. What if Patrick Henry
I and Tom Payne were on the Legis
i lature. Pat might make one of
i those completely in poor taste
j comments like, "Give me liberty
| or give me death." Pass some reso
lution and some turkey like John
Hancock is sure to sign his name
too big. A personality glory cult.
And Payne even published unau
thorized newsletters! So let's be
thankful that rabble-rousers and
professional agitators like that
aren't at Stanford. If they were,
we might not be on the edge of
greatness. We might be over.
