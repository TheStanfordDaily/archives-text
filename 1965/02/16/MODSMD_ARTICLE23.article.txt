## Domestic Affairs Stressed At End Of Postwar Period 
### Walter Lippmann 
Seen £10111 the sidelines, it has been particularly impressive to
| note how the beginning of the Johnson administration lias been
marked by a change ot emphasis and direction. For the first lime
in the 25 years since the start of the second world war, the main
attention of the President is not fixed upon the dangers abroad, but

| on the problems and the prospects"
i at home.
It will be a great mistake, I
jam sure, to read this as meaning
| that the country is withdrawing
: into isolation, having lost interest
in the world abroad. What has
happened is that there is for the
time being a conjuncture of
events abroad which makes it safe
and prudent for the country to
abate its anxiety and to pay atten
tion to its own affairs. For these
affairs have been sacrificed and
grievously neglected for a quar
ter of a century.
The President's budget and his
messages compose, it seems to
: me. a brilliantly contrived and in
tegrated program for initiating
j those progressive reforms which
j are at once necessary and practi
cable. Read as a whole, the collec
tion of messages shows the Presi
dent to be a bold innovator who
j is likely 10 succeed because he is
j deeply in touch with the great
I central mass of American senti
: mcnt and opinion.
Coherent Program
We have rarely, if ever, seen at
j the beginning of a new adminis
j tration such a coherent program,
such insight and resourcefulness.
I The President has grasped the
; nettle of race relations, of church
land state controversy, of busi
i ness confidence and tho welfare
[state with a sure and skillful
. hand.
There is an international con
text for the explicit Johnson pro*
| gram. Though the President did
i not talk about it because it is not
! ripe to be talked about from his
!office, the state of the world to
! day permits and justifies the pre
occupation with American domes
| tic affairs. I do not, of course.
1 presume to know or to say how
I the President - if he were given
! to generalization and speculation,
which is isn't — would describe
i the state of world affairs which
I is implied in his policies and pro
| gram. But the state of the world
; can be described somewhat as fol
! lows.
The postwar period which has
j lasted for 20 years has kept us
jail preoccupied with the unfin
ished business of the world war.
I It has not been possible 1o make
la settlement of that war, either
! in Europe, where Germany and
11lie Continent are partitioned, or
in Eastern Asia, where Korea,
China and Indo-China are parti
tioned and Japan is separated
j from the Ryukyus.
The Settlement
This postwar period is now end
j ing. The period we have entered
upon is already plainly visible in

! Europe, and quite dimly il is just
beginning to appear in East Asia.
This post postwar period will see
a general movement toward the
settlement of the second world
t war.
The hard core of the settlement
will be the inevitable return to
i normal after t h e convulsions
j which the world war produced.
; Thus, in Europe the collapse of
i Hitler's Nazi empire brought the
Russians to the Elbe River in the
middle of Europe. The Soviet tide
I will have to recede. In fact, it has
quite visibly already begun to re-
J cede. In East Asia the collapse of
the Japanese empire brought the
1 United States to the Asian main
land and to some of the islands
off its shores. This is an extension
of our political power beyond its
normal and natural limits, and
like the Russians in Europe, the
1 American tide will have to recede.
Displacement of Power
It is as abnormal for the United
States to be in Seoul, in Okinawa,
j in Quemoy and Matsu and For-
I mosa, in Saigon and Hue as it is
! abnormal for the Russians to be
1 in Berlin, Warsaw, Prague, Buda
pest, Bucharest and Sofia. The
I settlement of the world war,
I which must come someday is cer
tain to mean correction of the
; great displacements of power
■ of the Russian power into the
; heart of Europe and of American
! power onto the mainland of Asia.
The historical reality cannot be
understood in terms of battles
which are won or lost. The whole
historical process is more like a
I geological phenomenon, like the
I subsiding of the earth and the re-
I turn of the walers after a great
upheavel. It is a callow kind of
! jingoism to talk of victory for us
j and defeat for the Soviet Union as
i it accommodates itself to the
! growing intercourse between the
; two halves of Europe. And it is
! panic-mongering to flagellate our
i selves into paroxysms of anguish
! and shame at the prospect of ne
| gotiating settlements which end
our entanglements in East Asia.
The role of the United States
I in the world today is to use its
j power, its resources, its brains
! and its experience to see that, this
i inevitable readjustment in Eu
rope and Asia comes to pass de
cently and honorably. The time
has come to stop imagining our
j selves to be the "leader" of Eu
rope. The time has come to stop
; beating our heads against stone
walls under the illusion that we
; have been appointed policeman
I to t he human race.

The postwar period which has

The Settlement

j ing. The period we have entered
upon is already plainly visible in

! Europe, and quite dimly il is just

This post postwar period will see
a general movement toward the
settlement of the second world
t war.
The hard core of the settlement
will be the inevitable return to
i normal after t h e convulsions

I will have to recede. In fact, it has
quite visibly already begun to re-
J cede. In East Asia the collapse of
the Japanese empire brought the
1 United States to the Asian main
land and to some of the islands
off its shores. This is an extension
of our political power beyond its

Displacement of Power

middle of Europe. The Soviet tide
I will have to recede. In fact, it has
quite visibly already begun to re-
J cede. In East Asia the collapse of
the Japanese empire brought the
1 United States to the Asian main
land and to some of the islands
off its shores. This is an extension
of our political power beyond its
normal and natural limits, and
like the Russians in Europe, the
1 American tide will have to recede.
Displacement of Power
It is as abnormal for the United
States to be in Seoul, in Okinawa,
j in Quemoy and Matsu and For-
I mosa, in Saigon and Hue as it is
! abnormal for the Russians to be
1 in Berlin, Warsaw, Prague, Buda
pest, Bucharest and Sofia. The
I settlement of the world war,
I which must come someday is cer
tain to mean correction of the
; great displacements of power
■ of the Russian power into the
; heart of Europe and of American
! power onto the mainland of Asia.
The historical reality cannot be
understood in terms of battles
which are won or lost. The whole
historical process is more like a
I geological phenomenon, like the
I subsiding of the earth and the re-
I turn of the walers after a great
upheavel. It is a callow kind of
! jingoism to talk of victory for us
j and defeat for the Soviet Union as
i it accommodates itself to the
! growing intercourse between the
; two halves of Europe. And it is
! panic-mongering to flagellate our
i selves into paroxysms of anguish
! and shame at the prospect of ne
| gotiating settlements which end
our entanglements in East Asia.
The role of the United States
I in the world today is to use its
j power, its resources, its brains
! and its experience to see that, this
i inevitable readjustment in Eu
rope and Asia comes to pass de
cently and honorably. The time
has come to stop imagining our
j selves to be the "leader" of Eu
rope. The time has come to stop
; beating our heads against stone
walls under the illusion that we
; have been appointed policeman
I to t he human race.
Seen £10111 the sidelines, it has been particularly impressive to

attention of the President is not fixed upon the dangers abroad, but

i at home.
It will be a great mistake, I
jam sure, to read this as meaning

: into isolation, having lost interest
in the world abroad. What has
happened is that there is for the
time being a conjuncture of
events abroad which makes it safe
and prudent for the country to
abate its anxiety and to pay atten
tion to its own affairs. For these
affairs have been sacrificed and
grievously neglected for a quar
ter of a century.
The President's budget and his
messages compose, it seems to
: me. a brilliantly contrived and in
tegrated program for initiating
j those progressive reforms which

dent to be a bold innovator who
j is likely 10 succeed because he is
j deeply in touch with the great
I central mass of American senti
: mcnt and opinion.
Coherent Program

j tration such a coherent program,
such insight and resourcefulness.

land state controversy, of busi
i ness confidence and tho welfare
[state with a sure and skillful
. hand.
There is an international con
text for the explicit Johnson pro*
| gram. Though the President did
i not talk about it because it is not
! ripe to be talked about from his
!office, the state of the world to
! day permits and justifies the pre
occupation with American domes
| tic affairs. I do not, of course.
1 presume to know or to say how
I the President - if he were given
! to generalization and speculation,
which is isn't — would describe
i the state of world affairs which
I is implied in his policies and pro
| gram. But the state of the world
; can be described somewhat as fol
! lows.
The postwar period which has
j lasted for 20 years has kept us

I It has not been possible 1o make
la settlement of that war, either

11lie Continent are partitioned, or
in Eastern Asia, where Korea,
China and Indo-China are parti
tioned and Japan is separated
j from the Ryukyus.
The Settlement
This postwar period is now end
j ing. The period we have entered
upon is already plainly visible in

! Europe, and quite dimly il is just
beginning to appear in East Asia.

a general movement toward the
