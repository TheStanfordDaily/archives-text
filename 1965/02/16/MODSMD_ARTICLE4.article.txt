### LYNN DALEY 
"It will take India a minimum
of 50 years to reach the standard
of living now enjoyed by Brazil
or Mexico," emphasized Profes
sor N. S. Ramaswamy of the Uni
versity of Bombay, India in a
speech last night at Tresidder.
Professor Ramaswamy, who is
doing research in the Production
Management Program at Stan

ford this year, devoted his speech
to the economic, social, and politi
cal problems of modern India. The
speech was the sixth in a series
presented by the Tresidder Pro
gram Division on underdeveloped
economies.
THE INDIAN professor blamed
India's economic problems on the
centralization of wealth in a few
hands. Fully "one-third of the
population earns only ten cents a
day."
"India is now saving only ten
per cent of her gross national
product. She should save at least
20 per cent in order to progress,
but a vast majority of the people
are unable to save at all."
Ramaswamy pointed to the de
population of the villages as an
other source of concern to Indian
economists. "We need leadership
in the villages, but the people who
get an education are lured away
by good jobs in the cities. People
must sacrifice and come back to
the villages."
STILL ANOTHER obstacle to
India's progress has been its in
volvement in the struggle with
China. "We have had to double
our defense expenditure, and even
though I do not say that India
should stop paying for defense,

I we cannot afford defense spend-
I ing."
"It is said that India should re
duce its population, but our people
are our greatest resource. We just
i need leadership to enable these
I people to build the schools, roads,
and buildings that we need in ihe
villages," concluded Ramaswamy.
