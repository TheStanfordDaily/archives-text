# ENGINEERING PHENOMENON
## Majors' Schedules Are Flexible 
### 
Next week the ritual of pre-registra
tion will begin again and. for many engi
neering students, it will seem to be just
another round of fitting required courses
into time slots.
However, according to Bob Williamson,
chairman of Student Engineering Study
Committee, there arc a few engineers
who will be taking advantage of the high
degree of flexibility built into the many
engineering programs.
"SOME. FACED with a list of 18U re
quired units, will think that engineering
education is nothing more than a punch
card program for producing an engineer
ill four years." Said Williamson, "Those
who take the time to study the situation
will find something quite different. The
engineering curriculum includes freedom
that many engineering students and
some of their advisors are not aware of."
"Each engineering student, both al
graduate and undergraduate levels, is
given the opportunity of adjusting the
details of his study program to fit
his own interests and ambitions.
In no ease is the student required
to follow an inflexible currieulm rep
resenting goals arbitrarily chosen for
him bv other's. We feel that the ctn

riculum should be a servant rather
than a master of the engineering stu
dent.
IN THE 1 A('K of the mass of engi
neering units, this philosophy often
seems nothing more than idle talk. Yet
according to Williamson, careful study
will show that the student is really free
to adjust his own program.
"Courses and Degrees" says:
The requirements listed below un
der the heading 'Courses Normally
Taken hy All Engineering Students'
may be modified in unusual situations
to satisfy specific objectives.
And it is not required that these spe
cific objectives have an "E" before their
course number. "Courses and Degrees"
goes on to say that:
Substitutions or deletions from the
Supplementary Requirements may be
made with the approval of the stu
dent's faculty adviser. "Every student
is urged to discuss with his adviser
any change that would improve the
curriculum for his personal needs.
A survey by Williamson shows that
tew engineering students have read
"Comset; and Degrees' cloudy and id

the same students complain that they arc
too restricted.
EVERY DEPARTMENT in the Engi
neering School states that their require
ments can be modified. The Electrical
Engineering Department points out,
"Courses to complete the undergraduate
program will be selected according to the
student's interest. The following three
lists of courses are suggested."
According to the Civil Engineering Sec
lion. "Strict adherence to one of these
programs is NOT required." (emphasis
added.) In each department lists of
courses are suggested, not required.
The modifications above concern only
departmental programs. For the student
who plans to use engineering as a back
ground for other work, there is the Gen
eral Engineering program, which allows
a maximum choice <>f courses.
A student can be an engineer, gradu
ate with an engineering degree, and still
specialize in economics or history of poli
tical science.
PROFESSOR YENNARD, Chairman
of the School of Engineering Commit
tee on Student Advising and Counseling,
said recently that he was shocked to hear
that engineering students were not gen
ii ally aware that there were ;=o many

options open to them.
He pointed out that it has always been
the policy of the Engineering School to
lot the student work out his own pro
gram. Sample programs, he went on to
say, are just samples and are not binding
on the student.
The Student Engineering Study Com
mittee recently made the following
rccommndations
• The burden of responsibility for a
flexible program rests on the student.
"The Engineering School encourages stu
dents to diversify and yet few take the
opportunity."
• The student who desires something
besides a "carbon curriculum" must first
demine his goals and find courses that
fit these goals.
• Second, he must go to his advisor
with his ideas and be willing to work to
set up a program that is meaningful."
Many students will find that the present
programs are good ones'' "the opti
mum for the typical student, according
to Courses and Degrees.
This evening at 9:15, KZSU will present
a panel discussion with various members
of the engineering faculty and students
discussing the options within the engi
neering program.
