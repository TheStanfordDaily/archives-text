# Allen Issues Statement, Denies Making Charges
## Cites Stanford's Crucial Problems 
### MARSHA COOK 
Lucile Allen denied yesterday
making any derogatory .state
incuts in relation to the English
1 Department in a statement re
leased today in San Francisco.
She stated h o w e v e r that,
| "1 felt that in the best interests
of the University no useful pur
pose could be served by prolong
ing the controversy."
SHE WENT on to say, "T h e
; question is academic freedom —
I for whom? Under what circum-
I stances? Does it obtain for all?
It is my desire that this incident
will serve to put the entire aca
! demie community and its public
on notice that much needs to be
; done to formulate and implement
definitive policies designed to
i clarify relationships among stu
dents, faculty, and administrators
| at this critical time in our nation's
i history."
Though she resigned, she said
that she was ". . . not unmindful
i of the myriad pleas of my many
{friends among Stanford students,
1 faculty and administration, as
well as those outside of the Uni
versity, t hat I remain as dean to
carry on with the work I had
undertaken four years ago."
SHE PRAISED President Wal
lace Sterling and expressed grati
tude to all who had helped her.
"President Sterling . . . has my
I complete respect. He will, I'm
i sure, meet with propriety and
; firmness the inevitable challenges
to duly constituted authority
which will be made in the years
j to come."
"Perhaps in this incident the
j University is served better than
it. knows. It focused upon a few
questions among many unsettled
issues in higher education, s u e h
' as,
• "What is the role of a stu-
I dent's disciplinary council?"
• "Are our mores today so
complicated that faculty and ad
ministrators should be required
to sit on the council?"
• "What are roles of faculty,
j students, and administrative offi
! cers at the points where their
duties appear to overlap?"
• "What guidance can a partic
| ular administrative officer re
ceive in carrying our unpredicted
land uncharted responsibilities?"
