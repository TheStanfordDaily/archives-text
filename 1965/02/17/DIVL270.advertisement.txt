How to enjoy
two Londons on one visit
Lively London offers you new sounds,
new sights and new ideas. Traditional
O
London still abounds with treasures.
1x lively London, bright new things are happening.
Writers and painters are turning out important new
work (you ean mix with them in their favorite haunts
for the price of a coffee or a beer). Sounds of a kind
you've never heard come beating out of jazz clubs.
(Membership starts as low as 7(ty.) The theatre and
ballet are full of vitality (theatre seats start at 70/-). Two
weeks' membership in a nightclub with a famous satiri
cal floor show will cost you only $1.50.
The other London is still there, taking no notice. West
minster Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, the Tower of
London, Changing the Guard at Buckingham Palace.
The splendid museums, the great art galleries. You can
enjoy most of I his London absolutely free.
