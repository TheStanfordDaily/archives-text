• Albania Forces I .IS, Showdown
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. Albania, the closest European ally
of Red China and some-time critic of Moscow communism, demanded
yesterday that the General Assembly break its paralyzing deadlock
by starting to vote. The move could force a Soviet-American show
down over assembly voting rights and lead to further U.N. crisis.
To many delegates it appeared the proposal was prompted by
Peking not a member of the United Nations amid the intensify
ing big power moves relating to Viet Nam and Moscow's efforts for
a world Communist conference on ideological differences.

do, the whole scheme of state-run medical facilities in this country

The physicians are angry at what they call a grossly inadequate

week. They had asked for a minimum of $196.
