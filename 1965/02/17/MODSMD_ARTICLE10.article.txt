# Subsidy For GCC Debated
## Board Unable To Resolve Question 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
The Publications Board de
j clined last night to make a rec
ommendation to the Legislature
on the Graduate Coordinating
Committee's request for an $850
subsidy for its newsletter.
While urging the Legislature to
j maintain a fund of $200 to be used
; at the discretion of a three-man
I subcommittee of the Publications
; Board "for expenses of initial is
; sues of spontaneous publications."
i it dodged the question of subsidiz
ing a continuing publication of a
• voluntary group.
The Board resolved that such ;j
; decision "is solely the business
| of the Legislature." However, it
; later approved in principle "publi
cation by any campus group that
i feels it. has something worthwhile
: to say."
Present University policy would
i not allow the Legislature to grant
funds to any voluntary organi
. zation for the purpose of espous
! ing opinion on off-campus issues,
| Robert Naylor, chairman of the
board, told The Daily.
Publications Board member
Clyde Christofferson had earlier
told Ihe board that even if such
an act were legal, "LASSU is not
about to give away so much
money without keeping a finger
on it."
In order to receive any sub
sididy from the ASSU for con
tinuous publication, the GCC
would have to appeal directly to
the Graduate Student Association
or to the Publications Board,
Naylor added.
The latter could subsidize th e
proposed eight issues of the GCC
newsletter with funds from its
Assistance Fund.
"However, the Assistance Fund
is now in Ihc red by $100; thus.
\vc would not probably grant the
request unless we received further
| funds from the ASSU Contin
i geney Fund."
The GSA could also appropri
ate whatever funds it has for
publication to the GCC. However,
when Bill O'Connell Treasurer
of the GSA and a member of the
GCC—urged the Legislature last
week to appropriate $850 to the
GSA for just such a purpose, his
bill was defeated by a hand vote.
