plained the title of his discussion
by affirming that the Florentine!
is the only poet ever to have
"seen" the Diety and responsibly
describe his "vision."
AMi;M)l\(i thk lecture's title j
to read "How a Poet Sees God" be-!
cause of the timeless nature of;
Dante's experience. Singleton cen
tered his remarks on the one hun
dreth and final canto of the Di
vine Comedy, the passage in |
which the wayfaring poet finally
achieves the beatific vision.
Dante's journey to God is ac- i
complished via the three "lights" j
of reason, faith and glory. After I
being guided through Inferno and
Purgatorio by the lights of reason
and faith as personified by Virgil
and Beatrice, the pilgrim reaches!
Paradaiso and ascends to the
tenth heaven whereupon, over
whelmed by the "Light of Glory"!
Dante is assisted to his vision of
God by the spirit of St. Bernard.

Singleton cautioned his audience
that Dante's masterpiece should
lie taken neither as a solely re
ligious, nor as a solely poetical
work, hut rather as an esthetic
experience synthesizing the I wo.
