Each one of us speaks with the greatest assurance when lie relates his own
experiences and tells his own story. Such is the case of the Apostle Paul, a devout
Jewish scholar and learned theologian of his da\. Converted to I hristiatiiH front a
position where he zealously persecuted the church, lie became Cod's great messenger
t«i the Gentiles and the human instrument the Holy Spirit used to write 14 books of tin;
New Testament. On the road to Damascus lie encounter. <1 the Lord Jesus Christ in
a life-changing vision. Thereafter, he described his new Christian life as if it were
an exciting foot race for eternal rewards. What Paul saw and experienced every
Christian discovers in his own way. Indeed, catching a personal glimpse of reality is
enough to change the course of one's life and goals. Hi re are Paul's own words:
"King Agrippa. said to Paul 'You have our permission to speak tor yourself'.
Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defence: . . . 'My life from my
youth up, the life 1 led from the beginning anion.; my people and in Jerusalem, is
familiar to all Jews. Indeed, they have known nic long enough and could testify, it
they only would, that I belonged to the strictist group of our religion: I lived as a
Pharisee . ..
'I myself once thought it my duty to work actively against the name of Jestls
of Nazareth; and 1 did so in Jerusalem. It was I who imprisoned many of Hod's
people by authority obtained from the chief priests; and when they were condemned
to death, my vote was cast against tlieni. In all the synagogues I tried by repeated
punishment to make them renounce their faith; indeed my fury rose to such a pitch
that I extended my persecution to foreign cities.
'On one such occasion I was travelling to J>atua.-cus with authority and coin
mission from the chief priests; and as I was on niv way. Your Majesty, in the
middle of the day I saw a light from the sky. more brilliant than the situ, shining
all around me and my travelling companions. We all fell to the ground, and then I
heard a voice saying to me in the Jewish language. "Saul. Saul, why do you persecute
nic? It is hard for you. this kicking against the goad." I said, "tell me. Lord, who
are you"; and the Lord replied, "1 am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. Hut now,
rise to your feet and stand upright. I have appeared to you for a purpose: to appoint
you my servant and witness, to testify both to what you have seen and to what you
shall sci of nic. I will rescue you from this people and from the (Jentilcs to whom
I am sending you. I send you to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to
light, from the dominion of Satan to Ciod, so that, by trust in me. tlu v may obtain
forgiveness of sins, and a place with those whom God has made his own" (Acts 26:
1,4,5,9-19).
What is it that could make a learned, well educated, sucees i ill man like Paul
abandon all he had and pursue a changed course and a new life 5 What could it be
but his realization of the truth about Jesus Chri-t and Kternal Yalucs so different
front those the world subscribes to? You, too can join the exciting race for eternal
rewards. Place your trust in Jesus Christ today. You, too, can discover the reality of
life in fellowship with the Lord Jesus Christ.
