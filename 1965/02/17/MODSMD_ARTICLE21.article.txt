# Stanford Swim Team Nearing Goal Of National Prominence
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's freshman swimmers
I have drawn attention to themsel
| ves recently in a spectacular way.
I Sunken in their wakes lie one
i American record, an NCAA fresh
man record, a pool record, a n d
seven Stanford freshman records.
The Papooses have erased marks
in every corner of the record
book, and to name the out stand
: ing freshman swimmers is lo
write down (he team roster.
Two such power-packed fresh
! man teams back to back, coupled
with Ihe Indians' aggressive
! sophomores, should provide the
I impetus necessary to boosl Stan
ford into a position of national
! swimming promience. Swimming
j coach Jim Gaughran anticipates
! such a freshman team next fall.
Among the hopefuls for next
I season are six to ten of the top 20
I prep swimmers in the nation. A 1
\ least five of these were All-Ameri
j can in two or more events as high
school juniors.
When looking lor a freshman
swimmer, Coach Gaughran con-

I siders a boy's coach, his training
j program, his league, and the level
of his competition as well as his
j past achievements. Often a 112 a i r
swimmer, when given the coach
ling and the facilities to improve,
; blossoms into a front line competi
tor.
ACADEMIC APPEAL
Jim Gaughran's personal re
cruiting has contributed immen
sely to the building of Stanford's
j swimming teams. Stanford offers
ample facilities, a fleet of top
flight swimmers, a well-coordi
i nated training program, and a few
scholarships. Yet all of these fac
tors are found in practically every
school, particularly towards ihe
SOU til.
What, then, sways a capable ath
lete from an established swim
! ming school such as USC? The ob
i vious answer is Stanford's aca
; demic program.
Yale, which offers comparable
I academic stature, a highly rated
1 swimming team, and a way to get
I away from home for a California
1 swimmer, pr e s en t s Stanford's

greatest competition in the market
for freshman swimmers.
One thing that would really en
! hance Stanford's training and re
i cruiting program is a 50-meter
poo 1. In today's increasingly
; fierce competition, the benefits de
| rived from longer distance train
: ing often prove decisive. A 50-
meter pool is in the planning stage
behind the new basketball pavil
ion, but the familiar story of lack
of funds is presently clogging the
[water works.
GOAL: NATIONAL FAME
Jim Gaughran's goal, and one
that now looms large, is a top
ranked national team for Stan
ford. Stanford is picking up the
nation's leading high school
swimmers, and this year's fresh
man squad is one of the three
best in the country. The attain
ment of such a ranking, however,
j must coincide with the mainten
ance of swimmers' high academic
standards.
When asked if the Stanford
study grind hurt current perform
ances, Coach Gaughran replied,

"Of course wo could be doing bet
ter if we were to work out four
or five hours a day. Bui right now
our swimmers are turning in their
best times ever, and maintaining
a tremendous attitude." He stated
that, as a rule, swimmers have
done better academically while
training than out of season.
Gaughran attributed this phe
nomenon to the need for increased
organization of time and more in
tensified study habits.
INTEREST RISES
National interest in swimming
jumped markedly last fall with
the U.S. Olympic team's incredible
successes. The wave of enthusi
asm. however, has not quite
crested over Hoover Tower. Nor
even over the walls into the En
cina chlorine cloister. Stanford
met Ihe perennially potent Santa
Clara Swim Club in a reco rd
smashing jamboree witnessed by
a sparsely populated bleacher sec
tion. NCAA champion USC drew
scarcely more last Friday.
Stanford's varsity this year is
scraping along with the barest
minimum of team members. With
about ten regulars, the team has
about half as many as it needs.
As a consequence of this dearth
of depth, the Tribe has dropped
a few close meets that perhaps
they wouldn't have otherwise.
Since most of the front line swim
mers have to swim in the maxi
mum of three events, the team
cannot afford to "hold" a man for
one crucial event.
The team attitude, however, is
one of enlhusiasm and encourage
ment. And with reinforcements
coming up next year from the
frosh, Stanford varsity swimming
will soon begin to flash a cham
pionship smile.
MR. STANFORD SWIMMING
Whatever the reasons for Stan
ford swimming achievements,
past or projected, Jim Gaughran
must stand on top. Graduating
from Stanford in 1954, he was an
All-American swimmer and All-
Pacific Coast water poloist for
Iwo years running. In 1956 he
traveled to Melbourne as a mem
ber of the U.S. Olympic water
polo team. Gaughran still plays
water polo with the Nor-Cal cham
pion San Francisco Olympic Club.
Gaughran coached the fresh
man water polo and swimming
squad and assisted with the var
sity in 1955-56. He received his
Stanford Law degree in 1958, and
in 1960 became Aquatics Director.
The same year, Gaughran rein
stituted water polo as a sport at
Stanford. In four years he pushed
his team to the number one col
legiate ranking in the country.
Gaughran was named assistant
coach of the U.S. water polo squad
in the Pan American Games of
1963 and is a member of the U.S.
Olympic Water Polo Committee
and the NCAA and AAU commit
tees.
As for personal preference be
tween water polo and swimming,
Coach Gaughran states simply,
"Whichever is in season."
