# 5-0 SHUTOUT
## Cards Stomp Dons In Baseball Opener 
### ROBERT THIERIOT 
Stanford opened its baseball season yesterday by easily de
feating the USF Dons 5-0, behind eluteh pitching of John Mason,
Jim Blasehke, and Daro Quiring, and the timely hitting of Hon
Yettand Hon llovley.
John Mason was shaky in the opening inning and had to sur-

vive a bases-loaded situation. USF'
collected half of its hits in this
inning. They never made even a
minor scoring threat lor the rest
of the game. Mason hung on to
receive credit for the win.
STANFORD SCORED the only
run they needed in the first inn
ing. Ron Yett led off the season
for the Indians with a resounding
triple and romped home on Bob
Cox's ensuing groundout.
The Indians added another in
the third, when Yett drove a 270-
foot drive off the very top of the
right fielci wall for his second
triple. Cox again drove him home,
this time with a sacrifice fly.
In the sixth the Cards broke the
game wide open with an explosive
three-run rally. Jim Hibbs
grounded a base hit into center
and legged it out for a double.
Pete Middlekauff was hit by a
pitch. George Thacher drove
Hibbs home with a single. When
the center fielder ignorantly
threw the ball home in a vain
attempt to cut Hibbs down, both
runners moved up a base.
Ron Hovley batted for Rick
Berra, who had collected two
singles, and promptly drove both
runners home. The rally there
upon fizzled with three consecu
tive outs.
DARO QUIRING was particu
larly impressive. He hurled the
final three innings, allowing no

baserunners and whiffing four.
With two walks in addition to his
triples, Ron Yett now leads the
club in slugging percentage with
a very impressive 3.000.
In contrast to Stanford's excel
lent pitching, the USF pitchers
had problems keeping the ball un
der the batter's eye-level. Often a
pitch reached the backstop on the
fly after passing over the poor be
wildered catcher's head.
Although he was hit less, Dick
Swan sparkled on defense. Four
times he came up with sizzling
grounders only to nip the runner
at first. The crowd showed its ap
preciation for the shortstop's fine
play, when they gave him a long
ovation following a diving play in
the ninth inning.
The horsehiders have several
games remaining before the first
CIBA contest. The Indians face
the San Francisco State Golden
Caters this Friday on the Sunken
Diamond.
