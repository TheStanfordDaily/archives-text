## AWS 'Botches Things Again' 
### Justin Beck 
The charming ladies of the
AWS, our collegiate counterpart
of the Ladies' Bridge Club and
the DAR. have botched things
again.
Only this time, rather than
messing up their own petty af
fairs they have "ground the
wheels of the University to a
halt," a feat that Mario Savio
and a thousa n d supporters
couldn't accomplish at Cal.
As il was two months ago, as it
is now, and as it probably will be
for the next several months, t he
girls of the AWS social regula
tions committee are sitting on any
possible reforms of social regula
tions this year. Only they prefer
to call it "acting responsibly."
Last q u a rier undergraduate
women, including Women's Coun
cil, expressed concern about ex
isting social regs, and proposed
concrete reforms. Quick as a
wink, the Student Affairs and Ser
vices Committee tossed the mat
ter over to the Social Regs Com
mittee with instructions to take a
survey.
Even more quickly Carol Swan
son. the current head of the So
cial Regs Committee, dashed to
her typewriter to prepare her
materpiece, the grandest public
opinion poll since Tom Dewey was
elected President.
It's long, complete, and utterly
useless, and if the AWS hadn't
also fallen into that latter cate
gory, it might have been able to
stop Miss Swanson before her
project got underway. But 1 hey
didn't and now the AWS is in the
midst of compiling the greatest
statistical analysis ol' Stanford
women ever. Even Harvey Hall,
the registrar, won't he able to
match those statistics when the
AWS survey is finally finished.
But he shouldn't worry. It will
he a long time before Miss Swan
son finishes her work, and even
longer before some kind of report
emerges from that mass of sta
tistics. A minimum estimate is
now about two more months.
Of course the Student Affairs
and Services Committee must
have known what would be t he re
sult of giving tlie AWS something
responsible to do. Like Grant pur
suing Lee, the AWS has said, "We
will be responsible if it takes all
winter." It has and then some.
Miss Swanson has done such a
magnificent job of preparing her
questionaire that the results can
not be machine coded (Someth
ing that Dr. Maccoby of the De

partment of Communications Re
search must have known when his
advice was so freely handed out
to Miss Swanson). So there is
Miss Swanson over at the Comp
Center hand coding hundreds of
cards, a full time job for a girl
who would like to be a full time
student.
Every girl, locked safe in her
dorm each night should bow her
head in a moment of silent prayer
for t he labors of "responsibility."
Or perhaps simply remember
that every crime has its punish
ment.
But the AWS simply can't pro
pose Social Regs changes w i t h
out statistics. That wouldn't be
responsible.
Could the Board of Trustees ap
prove any liberalization without
knowing the percent of Stanford
girls who have read the Social
Regs Handbook, or t he number
who think that ehaperones pro
tect them, or about the correla
tion between girls CPA's and
understanding the details of over

night regulations?
One can picture Trustee Otis
Chandler saying, "How can you
justify this change when we don't
know how many sophomore girls
from Pasadena want midweek
overnights?" But if the AWS
could just fire an answer, like for
instance, 38 per cent, Otis he'd
probably forget about Barry Gold
water and endorse Carol Swan
son for President.
And the AWS might get its so
cial regs.
President Sterling would be
pleased by the statistics, too.
At the next ST&T speech, M iss
Swanson's survey would prob
ably get a lull fifteen minutes,
not to mention a standing ovation
from the assembled Administra
tors.
Rut after observing the AWS's
modus operandi, one doubts that
a liberalization of social regula
tions is, after all, a wise thing.
If the AWS were uncaged a full
24 hours a day, only disaster
could befall this University.

search must have known when his
advice was so freely handed out

Miss Swanson over at the Comp
Center hand coding hundreds of
cards, a full time job for a girl
who would like to be a full time
student.
Every girl, locked safe in her
dorm each night should bow her
head in a moment of silent prayer
for t he labors of "responsibility."
Or perhaps simply remember
that every crime has its punish
ment.
But the AWS simply can't pro
pose Social Regs changes w i t h
out statistics. That wouldn't be
responsible.
Could the Board of Trustees ap
prove any liberalization without
knowing the percent of Stanford
girls who have read the Social
Regs Handbook, or t he number
who think that ehaperones pro
tect them, or about the correla
tion between girls CPA's and
understanding the details of over

night regulations?
One can picture Trustee Otis
Chandler saying, "How can you
justify this change when we don't
know how many sophomore girls
from Pasadena want midweek
overnights?" But if the AWS
could just fire an answer, like for
instance, 38 per cent, Otis he'd
probably forget about Barry Gold
water and endorse Carol Swan
son for President.
And the AWS might get its so
cial regs.
President Sterling would be
pleased by the statistics, too.
At the next ST&T speech, M iss
Swanson's survey would prob
ably get a lull fifteen minutes,
not to mention a standing ovation
from the assembled Administra
tors.
Rut after observing the AWS's
modus operandi, one doubts that
a liberalization of social regula
tions is, after all, a wise thing.
If the AWS were uncaged a full
24 hours a day, only disaster
could befall this University.
The charming ladies of the
AWS, our collegiate counterpart
of the Ladies' Bridge Club and
the DAR. have botched things
again.
Only this time, rather than
messing up their own petty af

wheels of the University to a

and a thousa n d supporters
couldn't accomplish at Cal.
As il was two months ago, as it
is now, and as it probably will be
for the next several months, t he
girls of the AWS social regula

possible reforms of social regula
tions this year. Only they prefer
to call it "acting responsibly."
Last q u a rier undergraduate
women, including Women's Coun
cil, expressed concern about ex
isting social regs, and proposed
concrete reforms. Quick as a
wink, the Student Affairs and Ser
vices Committee tossed the mat
ter over to the Social Regs Com
mittee with instructions to take a
survey.
Even more quickly Carol Swan
son. the current head of the So
cial Regs Committee, dashed to
her typewriter to prepare her
materpiece, the grandest public
opinion poll since Tom Dewey was
elected President.
It's long, complete, and utterly
useless, and if the AWS hadn't
also fallen into that latter cate
gory, it might have been able to
stop Miss Swanson before her
project got underway. But 1 hey
didn't and now the AWS is in the
midst of compiling the greatest
statistical analysis ol' Stanford
women ever. Even Harvey Hall,
the registrar, won't he able to
match those statistics when the
AWS survey is finally finished.
But he shouldn't worry. It will
he a long time before Miss Swan
son finishes her work, and even
longer before some kind of report
emerges from that mass of sta
tistics. A minimum estimate is
now about two more months.
Of course the Student Affairs
and Services Committee must
have known what would be t he re
sult of giving tlie AWS something
responsible to do. Like Grant pur
suing Lee, the AWS has said, "We
will be responsible if it takes all
winter." It has and then some.
Miss Swanson has done such a
magnificent job of preparing her
questionaire that the results can
not be machine coded (Someth
