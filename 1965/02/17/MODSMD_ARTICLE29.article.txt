## Aphorism Editorial Defended 
### 
Dear Mr. Taylor:
Your letter concerning th e
"aphorism" editorial jolted me out
of my academic panic and into
speaking out on an attitude that
cropped up in the Malovos letter,
but didn't get sufficiently under
my skin at the time. If it weren't
for the fact that I have been a
Stanford student almost twice as
long as you have, your atlitude
might surprise, unsettle, or be
wilder me. Instead it merely reg
isters as a pathological symptom.
When I first arrived here in
September, 1937. one of the first
things I was told by the Wilbur
sponsor was the following. I can't
say for sure whether or not he
was instructed to say it or not,
but I did find out shortly there
after that virtually the same thing
was said by sponsors in meetings
in several other corridors:
A Stanford student should
never make the mistake of saying
"They can't do that to me." Stan
ford is a private university, and
is not restricted to the laws and

controlled judicial procedures
taken for granted by Americans.
Anyone who assumes he can rely
on due process of law is doomed
to a rude awakening. If they de
cide they want to do it to you.
they can and will, and there is
nothing you can do about it.
When you register, you volun
tarily submit to the fundamental
standard, and the interpretation
of violations of this standard is
left up to them. There is no court
of appeals. You must realize for
your own protection that you have
no rights as a Stanford student.
If you get into trouble, you cannot
hope to have your rights as an
individual taken into considera
tion. This is not a direct quote,
but is an accurate summary of
the content.
In the years I have spent as a
Stanford student, I have, until re
cently. seen nothing that would
contradict the sponsor's state
ment. Instead. I have seen a long,
dreary chain of incidents that
strongly confirm it. The F ran k

1 Morse matter was not the first
:oi w M'st. I have been careful, but
have seen more people seriously
I wronged than I can count or even
remember 1 don't know what you
| have seen, but your cry of indig
-1 nation implies that Stanford stu
dents don't have a right to com
plain. About what 7
You don't seem very clear on
this. You seem to have badly mis
: understood the editorial. If the
! editor had bawled about our be
ing "underprivileged, I'd be on
your side. But she didn't. I know,
and she knows as well as you do
that acceptance to this school is a
; great privilege. You mentioned
the erroneous assumption that
people feel they have "the right to
attend." This assumption was not
Contained in the editorial.
The editor discussed the way
people are treated once they are
here. She does not wish to assert
thai the statement, "Attendance
at this university is a privilege
and not a right," is invalid. She
merely feels, and rightly so, that
j this statement is gravely misap
: plied when used as an excuse for
ignoring complaints about mis
handling of students.
She says that the administra
; Hon has clung to "its traditional
means of dealing with students
with little regard to the present
effectiveness of those means,"
and that cries for a reform of a
miserably inadequate and unjust
system (adjectives mine) are
countered with the "stubborn"
statement which you are so quick
| to defend.
You seem to have missed this
point. I direct my remarks at an
(attitude that is implied, not stated
directly in your letter. You are
sick and tired of hearing students
; complain. You ask to be shown a
university of comparable stature
where students have more per
sonal freedom and opportunity to
accept adult responsibility than
here. This is utterly immaterial.
1 find this pathological because it
represents the kind ot compla
j cency, the kind of ignorance to
and blindness for current prob
: lems, inequalities, and inconsis
tencies that allow people to sit
back and sop up the beauties of
what they already have while re
fusing to, or not needing to, or
being too oblivious to worry about
| shortcomings, and the need tor
overcoming them in order to
make what we already have even
; better.
! The editor discussed exactly this
! danger in today's (Monday's* edi
| torial, "The Quality ol' Courage."
I think both of these editorials
show a clear insight into serious
problems and that they display
the "maturity of thought and ex
j pression" you demand as a justi
fication of the editorial element
of The Daily.
