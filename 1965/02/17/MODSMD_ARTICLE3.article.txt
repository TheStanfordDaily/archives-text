# LASSU Debates Judicial Change
## 
### BILL WERTZ 
The By-Laws Committee of
LASSU held an open hearing last
night to discuss several possible
changes in ASSU judicial proce
dure.
Members of the Stanford com
munity testified on three bills sub
mitted to the by-laws committee
by the legislature.
All three bills revolve around
the question of jurisdiction over
violations of either the Funda
mental Standard, University pol
icy, or California civil law.
Complicating the issue is the
fact that some actions constitute
violations of Stanford rules and
regulations while they d<> not vio
late California civil law; for ex
ample. the consumption of alco
holic beverages by persons over
21.
Another ilem <>( much debate
is the fact that Ihe Fundamental
Standard and a large part of the
University's policy is undefined.
The By-Laws Committee will
consider the testimony received
last night in making a recommen
dation to the legislature as l<Â»
which bill it anv. merits approval
