### JOHN THAYER 
There is an old saying in the theatre that those who can, write

however, w hen those who can t, appreciate. And Manuel Freed
i man's "The Temptation of Christie" is one of those.
It is an aurally shocking, brutally candid, angry young play

I though Freedman's ideas, tightly
compressed as they are, some
times go by almost too fast, they
are unsettling enough to warrant
a double exposure with a stolen
script.
You may be revolted by what
"The Temptation of Christie" has

complishment as any young play
wright can hope for.
