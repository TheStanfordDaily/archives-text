## 'The New Abolitionists' 
### VIVI BOZMAN 
The Sew Abolitionist* by Howard Zinn, historian, professor,
and advisor to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, is
a portrait of SNCC in action and an assessment of its meaning for
American society.
The major part of the book traces SNCC's evolution from the

first sit-ins in Greensboro, North 1 *
Carolina, by four college fresh-1
men on Fob. 1. 1960. through the
freedom rides of the summer of j
1961, the efforts to register voters j

| in Mississippi, Georgia, and Ala
bama, and the forging of plans
i in 1964 for the Mississippi Free
dom Project. Zinn describes each
lof these actions in compelling
detail, retaining, through quotes
and vivid descriptions, the dra
matic quality of the experience.
The pattern of each of these
events is similar: the awakening
and organization of Negro citi
zens, an attempt to register to
vote, arrests, beating, and some
times killings. And SNCC's re
sponse is always the same - pro
tests, marchs, appeals to the
(federal government, more at
tempts to register, more protests
an enactment of the words of
the freedom song, "We'll never
turn back."
And perhaps this is the
'central point of Zinn's book, that
j SNCC has created a new and
; youthful force of revolt, which by
its very nature will never turn
back, which can be neither fright
ened. pistol whipped, nor compro
; mised out of existence. SNCC has
; brought protest and action, com
; mitment and dedication, and in
so doing has aroused Negroes in
the deep South "from quiescence
to revolt" and has distrubed "the
' conscience of the entire nation."
Zinn quotes an old man at a
; mass meeting in Selma, Alabama,
after Freedom Day: "Nothing
like this ever happened to Selma.
Nothing, until SNCC came here."
SNCC's workers are young
radicals, whose only ideology is
| a belief in the possibility of a
better society, and whose means
are the revolutionary ones of non
violence, direct action, and civil
disobedience. The "new abolition
ists" are similar to the old aboli
tionists in their "healthy disre
spe c t for respectability," but
differ in that SNCC's people are
not middle class reformers.
In general, SNCC staff mem
bers are young, college-educated
Negroes from southern working
class families. The experience of
John Lewis national chairman of
SNCC, is typical: "Twenty-three
years old, born on an Alabama
farm veteran of the Nashville sit
ins. beaten in the freedom rides,
jailed twenty times...
In the last two chapters Zinn
turns to an evaluation of the role
of the federal government, asking
"which side is the federal govern
ment on?" Zinn charges the
federal government with laxity in
enforcement of civil rights laws
and lays the responsibility for
enforcement at the door of the
executive branch, particularly the
president.
In discussing SNCC's 112 u t u r e
and"the revolution beyond race,"
Zinn cities several basic issues in
American society which the civil
rights movement has brought to
the fore. Direct action, he writes,
has created "a political power
which resides outside the regular
political establishment," and the
fight for racial justice has raised
the question of "whether perhaps
we need a fundamental restruc
turing of the economic system."
A basic question concerning
SNCC's future is whether it will
be able to create a revolution be
yond race, a society of humanity,
justice, and equality for all. The
promise of a better land exists in
the dedication and constant effort
of SNCC workers; and the chal
lenge to work for the better
I society is perhaps SNCC's great
' Â«>st contribution to the nation.
