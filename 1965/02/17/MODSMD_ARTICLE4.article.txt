# Tests Give Inside Track On Individual
## 
### HOLLY HINKS 
Ono Pre-Reg morning, tho majority of
the Freshmen Class decides they are not
j afraid of germs on door knobs, realizes
I they have answered tho same question
I six contradictory ways, and begins to
! wonder if the California Psychological
i Inventory Test has any validity.
Dr. Harold Korn, Director of Research
at the Counseling and Testing Service,
| believes the results of the California
Test and the Strong Vocational Test are
, indicative of an individual's personality,
whether the person was completely hon
' est in the test or not.
"THE I>l <. ICII to which people are
i honest on the tests," Korn pointed out,
j "varies with the degree to which each
j person is honest with himself." The basis
for tlie interpretation of the tests, he ex
plained, is not whether or not each per-
I son believes what he says, but that he is
j willing to say this about himself.
The tests do have certain safe guards
! against those who attempt to appear
very good or very bad on the results.

But less than one per cent of the stu
dents who take the tests answer all the
questions dishonestly.
The ovei-all results of both tests show
the "remarkable diversity" of Stanford
students, according to Korn. "Given the
selectivity in admissions," ho states,
"there is still remarkable room for diver
sity."
THE pKI.MAKV purpose for which the
test results are used is to give the coun
selors a background sheet on students
who come to talk. "The tests give us a
perspective on the student's problems,"
Korn remarked, "and help to provide bet
ter psychological service."
In research, the results of the tests
are being correlated in order to apply
them to specific problems at Stanford.
"All research is predicated on the notion
that what goes on in the university in
volves the whole student, not just the
intellect," Korn observed. "The personal
ity helps determine intellectual interests
and academic behavior."
Consequently, Korn has attempted to

understand the reasons behind the suc
cesses or failures of a student and
eventually predict grade point averages
from the test results.
THIS HAS proved extremely difficult,
according to Korn, because of the great
"heterogenity of performance in stu
dents."
No formula has yet been derived for
the research done in the engineering de
partment either. Because of the high
drop-out rate in the engineering pro
gram, Korn is trying to discover whether
or not he can predict from the results
of his tests if a student will drop out.
Currently, Korn is doing research on
the influence of a college experience on
an individual's personality. He is test
ing the senior class and comparing these
results with the results of tests taken
during their Freshman year.
THE SENIOR TESTING is completely
voluntary, and Korn urges interested
seniors to take the test at the Counseling
and Testing Center.
Research is also being done to deter

mine the validity of the tests in Ren.
eral. Korn is trying to discover to what
extent such factors as family back
ground and economic status influence a
studcnt's performance.
Despite the fact that only one third of
the Freshmen ever inquire about the
test results, Korn believes they are help
ful to the individiual. "The minimum
benefit is that it satisfies student curi
osity," he observed, "beyond that the re
sults themselves help the student under
stand himself and facilitiate decision
making."
ANI) HOW does all this fit into the
germs on the door knobs? "The point of
the germ question is completely irrele
vant," Korn said. The tests are con
structed empirically, he added, accord
ing to a large number of different
items.
These items are determined by sta
tistics on group differences among
people . It is a student's pattern on a
group of items and not simply one ques
tion which determines his score.

THE pKI.MAKV purpose for which the
test results are used is to give the coun
selors a background sheet on students
who come to talk. "The tests give us a
perspective on the student's problems,"
Korn remarked, "and help to provide bet

In research, the results of the tests
are being correlated in order to apply

"All research is predicated on the notion
that what goes on in the university in
volves the whole student, not just the
intellect," Korn observed. "The personal
ity helps determine intellectual interests
and academic behavior."
Consequently, Korn has attempted to

understand the reasons behind the suc
cesses or failures of a student and
eventually predict grade point averages
from the test results.
THIS HAS proved extremely difficult,
according to Korn, because of the great
"heterogenity of performance in stu
dents."
No formula has yet been derived for
the research done in the engineering de
partment either. Because of the high
drop-out rate in the engineering pro
gram, Korn is trying to discover whether
or not he can predict from the results
of his tests if a student will drop out.
Currently, Korn is doing research on
the influence of a college experience on
an individual's personality. He is test
ing the senior class and comparing these
results with the results of tests taken
during their Freshman year.
THE SENIOR TESTING is completely
voluntary, and Korn urges interested
seniors to take the test at the Counseling
and Testing Center.
Research is also being done to deter

mine the validity of the tests in Ren.
eral. Korn is trying to discover to what
extent such factors as family back
ground and economic status influence a
studcnt's performance.
Despite the fact that only one third of
the Freshmen ever inquire about the
test results, Korn believes they are help
ful to the individiual. "The minimum
benefit is that it satisfies student curi
osity," he observed, "beyond that the re
sults themselves help the student under
stand himself and facilitiate decision
making."
ANI) HOW does all this fit into the
germs on the door knobs? "The point of
the germ question is completely irrele

structed empirically, he added, accord
ing to a large number of different
items.
These items are determined by sta
tistics on group differences among
people . It is a student's pattern on a
group of items and not simply one ques
tion which determines his score.

"THE I>l <. ICII to which people are

The tests do have certain safe guards

very good or very bad on the results.

But less than one per cent of the stu

The ovei-all results of both tests show
