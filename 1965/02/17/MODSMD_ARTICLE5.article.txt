# Brown Says State Politics Leans Right
## GOP Campaign Tactics Improve 
### BILL MOORE 
California polities is taking a
turn to the right. Governor Pat
Brown told 25 Stanford Y o un g
Democrats visiting Sacramento
yesterday.
Brown, one of five top slate
leaders to address the group, at
tributed this trend "to those
many unrooted people coming out
here each day who are concerned
only with their own private lives."
FOR THEM, he explained, gov- '
ernment is an institution to be!
feared and nothing else.
"The extremes of this are the.
far right," he said. "There's no I
arguing with these people. I want '
to know what they think, al-'
though I can't make heads orj
tails out of it."
But even some of his own party
colleagues "fail to realize that '
government has certain obliga-!
tions to protect and help people."
This was evidently a veiled refer
ence to Assembly Speaker Jesse j
Unruh and Senate President Pro
tempore Hugh Burns, who he de- j
scribed "near the right."
BROWN SAW tough sledding;
for California Democrats next
year.
"The Republicans are intelligent j
about campaigning now. They are ■
getting good looking candidates, j
Two or three of our people who;
went down the drain last year did
so because they had better look-!
ing, more articulate opponents.
"Take Salinger. Although I
thought he looked fine, some said j
he didn't come over well at all. •
Smoking that stogcy too much.
Short and fat."
BROWN contrasted this wit h
the "dashing appearance" of Sal
inger's victorious rival, hoofsterj
George Murphy. But the compli-j
ments ended there.
"I don't respect Mr. Murphy. 1 .
try to work with our senators, but
he's impossible. I've never seen
such inane replies as those he
made to me when he was up here I
recently.
"That man is an idiot."
The Young Democrats, who
were on a day-long tour of the
capital, also met with Unruh,
Burns, Controller Alan Cran
ston and Lieutenant Governor
Glenn Anderson.
