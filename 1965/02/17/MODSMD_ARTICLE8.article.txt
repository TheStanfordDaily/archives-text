# Universities Face Rebellion Against 'Managerial Ideology'
## 
### BRUCE BURTON 
Associate Professor Charles A.
; Drekmeier of the Political Science
Department declared yesterday
I that American universities are
facing "a new variety of rebellion
: against standardization the re
] hellion of the consumer society."
Drekmeier said that this rcvolu
; tion is occuring because of a
i carry-over from economics to edu
-1 cation of the "managerial ide
ology," the demand by society
that universities produce trained
| individuals to meet increasing
i technological needs.
COM PARING university - stu-
I dent relationships to that of a
I business to its employes, he said
| that universities have tended to
subordinate student rights.
"The college has become a pro
ducer on the model of the business
i bureaucracy. Service has replaced
the concept of rights," he said.
According to Drekmeier, society
is not only a consumer of college
graduates, but students are also
i consumers of the education off
ered by universities and colleges.
1 TO DIOPRIVK students of these

rights, Drekmeier charged, "the
university has had to appeal to
arguments which are not very
convincing to the businessman."
He said there have been fewer
infringements on student rights
"in later years, perhaps because
there are fewer radicals around,
but mostly because of the bureau
cracy in universities" which help
smooth out problems.
DRKKMEIKK said this bureau
cracy sets up committees to study
matters of academic freedom --
what he defines as "the right to
disagree" or quietly eases out
persons, either students or fac
ulty. who disturb the smooth func
tioning of the institution.
He said the chief problem is
"whether the university is to so
cialize that is, prepare for so
ciety - or is there to help young
people find an identity for them
selves.
The professor feels academic
freedom "has got to be more than
to gain a technological education."
"The freedom to learn," according
to Drekmeier, "involves the need
to take responsibility for one's ac
tions.
Students have to see that de
cisions have consequences," he

j said. Ho declared that education
should entail the "willingness to
i consider every side of an issue so
I we can decide for ourselves."
SPEAKING OF depersonaliza
tion in the university, Drekmeier
! said that "education always in
| volves a certain amount of aliena
tion" because it is a strictly per
i sonal goal.
Drekmeier also spoke on the
in loco parentis issue, attributing
i university acceptance of the role
; of "moral guardian of the young"
| to the religious backgrounds of
most institutions.
He stated that few schools
"truly accept" the in loco parentis
role and that adults cannot fully
i determine standards for their chil
dren.

According to Drekmeier, society
is not only a consumer of college
graduates, but students are also
i consumers of the education off
ered by universities and colleges.
1 TO DIOPRIVK students of these

rights, Drekmeier charged, "the
university has had to appeal to
arguments which are not very
convincing to the businessman."
He said there have been fewer
infringements on student rights
"in later years, perhaps because
there are fewer radicals around,
but mostly because of the bureau
cracy in universities" which help
smooth out problems.
DRKKMEIKK said this bureau
cracy sets up committees to study
matters of academic freedom --
what he defines as "the right to
disagree" or quietly eases out
persons, either students or fac
ulty. who disturb the smooth func
tioning of the institution.
He said the chief problem is
"whether the university is to so
cialize that is, prepare for so
ciety - or is there to help young
people find an identity for them
selves.
The professor feels academic
freedom "has got to be more than
to gain a technological education."
"The freedom to learn," according
to Drekmeier, "involves the need
to take responsibility for one's ac
tions.
Students have to see that de
cisions have consequences," he

j said. Ho declared that education
should entail the "willingness to
i consider every side of an issue so
I we can decide for ourselves."
SPEAKING OF depersonaliza
tion in the university, Drekmeier
! said that "education always in
| volves a certain amount of aliena
tion" because it is a strictly per
i sonal goal.
Drekmeier also spoke on the
in loco parentis issue, attributing
i university acceptance of the role
; of "moral guardian of the young"

most institutions.
He stated that few schools
"truly accept" the in loco parentis
role and that adults cannot fully
i determine standards for their chil
dren.

Department declared yesterday

Drekmeier said that this rcvolu

i carry-over from economics to edu
-1 cation of the "managerial ide
ology," the demand by society
that universities produce trained
| individuals to meet increasing
i technological needs.

the concept of rights," he said.
