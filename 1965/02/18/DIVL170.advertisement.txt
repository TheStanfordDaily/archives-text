A Clean Slate
And A New Life
Not many people realize that (iod seek.* to add Hi* goodness to their
lives and enrich every area of human activity. All too many assume that
the Christian life i* one of rules and regulations, of had habits reluctantly
forsaken, and puritanical living which takes all the fun out of life. Nothing
could he further from the truth. What (iod freely dots for all who trust
Jesus Christ is to wipe out the record of their transgressions. I lc abolishes
and forgets their sins and mistakes, and implants within them His own
Iloly life, making them complete for the first time, and making available
to them the resources to meet every situation with confidence and power.
Consider (iod's statement* about the individual who is "in Christ" and
has claimed by faith what (iod has offered :
"For in Jesus Christ the whole fullness of Deity continue.* to dwell in
bodily form—gi\ing complete expression of tin divine nature. And you
are in I lint, made full and have come to fullness of life in Christ you too
are in Him, filled with the (iodhead: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and
reach full spiritual stature. And He is the head of all rule and authority
—of every angelic principality and power. In Him also you were circum
sized with a circumcision not made with hands, but in a spiritual circum
cision performed by Christ by stripping off the body of the flesh (the
whole corrupt, carnal nature with its passions and lusts). You were
buried with Hint in your baptism, in which you were also raised with Him
to a new life through faith in the working of < iod a* displayed when lie
raised Him from the dead. And you, who were dead in trespasses and the
uncircumcision of your flesh—your sensuality, your sinful carnal nature

of our way by nailiiuy it to His cross, (iod disarmed the principalities
ranged against us and made a bold display and public example of them,
in triumphing over them in Christ and in the cross" (Col. 2:9:15).

Not many people realize that (iod seek.* to add Hi* goodness to their
lives and enrich every area of human activity. All too many assume that
the Christian life i* one of rules and regulations, of had habits reluctantly
forsaken, and puritanical living which takes all the fun out of life. Nothing
could he further from the truth. What (iod freely dots for all who trust
Jesus Christ is to wipe out the record of their transgressions. I lc abolishes
and forgets their sins and mistakes, and implants within them His own
Iloly life, making them complete for the first time, and making available
to them the resources to meet every situation with confidence and power.
Consider (iod's statement* about the individual who is "in Christ" and
has claimed by faith what (iod has offered :
"For in Jesus Christ the whole fullness of Deity continue.* to dwell in
bodily form—gi\ing complete expression of tin divine nature. And you

are in Him, filled with the (iodhead: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, and
reach full spiritual stature. And He is the head of all rule and authority
—of every angelic principality and power. In Him also you were circum
sized with a circumcision not made with hands, but in a spiritual circum
cision performed by Christ by stripping off the body of the flesh (the
whole corrupt, carnal nature with its passions and lusts). You were
buried with Hint in your baptism, in which you were also raised with Him
to a new life through faith in the working of < iod a* displayed when lie
