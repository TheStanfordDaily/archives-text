# Trackmen Keyed For Sizzling Cinders

### PETE KING 
"This is ilie best track learn I've
had at Stanford. Why, the po
tential of these hoys is enormous.
They're ready for competition
right now."
Listening to Stanford track
coach Payion Jordan describe this
year's team is like hearing a
southern California oilman ex
citedly brag about Ihe 10 new
"gushers" he has just discoverer).
The eyes sparkle, the smile is en
gaging, the quiet manner exudes

confidence. I
Coaches everywhere are not
exactly famous for poor-mouth
ing their team's chances before a
season, and Jordan has always
had an enthusiastic drive which
rubs off on his track teams, be
they strong or weak. This season,
however, much of the optimism
appears to be .justified.
good iik;ii sc iiool chop
A very effective recruiting!
campaign has assembled a sizable
number of last season's sought
al'ier prep standouts. As a result,
Stanford has one of the strongest 1
l'rosh track teams in the country.
The varsity will be powerful, too.
All told, Stanford has eight
sprinters who can run the 100-,

yard dash in 10 seconds flat or
under. They are led by senior
Larry Quest ad, who ran 9.3 in the
1963 NCAA finals to nip Olympic
star Henry Carr for first place.
Backing him up are senior Eric
Frische, whoso best: is 9.5, a n d
sophomore Dale Rubin.
Most of the varsity sprint com
petition may come from fresh
man Roger Cox, who has run 9.7
already in practice. His 6.!i clock
ing in the indoor 60-yard dash re
cently tied Questad's school rec
ord. Although Cox's best is 9.1»,
he has beaten a 9.1 man, and usu
ally performs In st in the long h
races.
In the 140, freshman Jim Ward
may be the best Stanford quar

ter-miler in several years. An
Ohio State prep champ, his best
effort is a sparkling 17.4 clock
ing.
IHSTAM i; TK.-VM STRONG
In past seasons, Stanford has
boasted one of the country's fin
es) lung-distance teams. The sit
uation looks blight again in 1965.
Bolh Dave Deubner and Weym
Kirkland have shaved nine min
ules in ihe two-mile race, and
are lough in the mile, also. Paul
Schlicke, whom Jordan calls "Ihe
warhorso ol our distance team,"
has a 1:02 best in the file and
8:56.1 in the two-mile.
I'liil Arnaudo's 14.6 best in ihe
high hurdles and 37.7 in the lows,
leads that department. Greg Ford
and Bud Walsh, the latler a de
cathlon prospect, add tremendous
depih to the hurdles events.
<;<> 111 (• 11 II M PUR
The high jump has been a weak
varsity event recently, and will be
Stanford's weakest event this
season. But wait 'til next year. Kd
llanks, a thin 5'10" freshman with
coil spring leys, vaulted 6'9" in
practice last week; bis best is
.just under 6'I0". The 12-year-old
l'rosli record of (i'ti'i" should fall
in the first meet, and the varsity
mark of has only a year
more to live.

Tho polo vfiull and triple jump
should I>o the Tribe's best field
events. Senior Chuck Smith
soared 1.75" on his fiberglass pole
in a recent all-comers meet to set
a Stanford record. Right behind
him is sophomore Jim Eshelman,
another 15-foot plus vaulter.
In the weird hop, step, and
jump event. Art Miller has a fine
48'1" mark and John Goode has
done 17'6". The Cards will prob
ably place 1-2 or 1-3 in this even)
in most meets. "Iron man" Bob
Mclntyre leads the broad jump
ers at 23'10", and has leaped IG'9"
in the triple jump.
Bruce Wilhelm shattered the
freshman shot put record by
nearly two feel last year, with a
best of f)6'2V. With valuable
competitive wrestling experience
this quarter as a start, Wilhelm
should lie the firsi (50-footer in
Stanford history.
FIVE HOME MEETS SEATED
Jordan has scheduled five home
meets this year, with the opener,
the Stanford Relays, on March 6.
The Tribe meets Fresno State and
San Jose State during tho spring
break, then faces a tough Wash
ington State team and arch-rival
USC in April.
Jordan feels his boys have the
spirit and tlx* talent to win the
close meets, li they can, Stanford
will be the favorite to win the con
ference title. Two years ago, the
Tribe came 11 points from being
the nation's No. I dual meet
team. Losses to San Jose, 7<>(>fl;
to Oregon, 71-71; and to l'S(\ 7.5-72,
72, could easily have been re
versed. Those teams were rated
3-2-1, respectively.
Optimism aside, only a wait
and-see attitude is appropriate
wherever Stanford track is con
cerned. Last year, too many in
consistent efforts resulted in the
team going downhill. Picked for
second in the conference, Stan
ford finished a distant fifth, and
the season's nadir was reached in
the NCAA meet, where the In
dians managed only a single
point, after finishing a surpris
ingly strong second with 12 points
only the year before.
In all sports, attitude is more
than half the battle. In football
and basketball, a good team ef
fort can often mask individual
let-downs. Not so in track, where
it is man against man. if Jordan
can maintain Hie present high
team morale, Stanford could have
the country's best dual meet
squad. But it won't be easy.
