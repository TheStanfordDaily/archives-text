The Fundamental Standard of the Associated
Students of Stanford University acknowledges
that "Stanford students recognize their respon
sibility to condemn any action which is offensive
to, or jeopardizes the rights, privileges . . . of
others."
The forthcoming LASSU debate over judicial
jurisdiction and women's social regulations should
prove an interesting test of this assertion — a
test of whether or not Stanford students ih)
recognize their communal responsibility to create
a climate and a system which insures that the
rights and mature dignity of fellow students are,
indeed, respected.
Women's social regulations constitute an en
tire system which is offensive — in its hypocritical
cnlorccment of the demeaning "double standard"
<>1 sexual morality — and unjust — in its disrespect
tor the private standards of conduct of individual
women students.
It is to be hoped that LASSU, unlike the AW S
social regs committee, will not miss the point.
The AWS social regs reform committee, for
all its data processing machinery—is fundamen
tal!) useless; for it assumes that reform can only
come with the consensus of the majority.
In this assumption the committee simply ig
nores the most basic precept of democracy: that
the rights of the minority must be preserved and
protected — protected especially from the arbi

trary and ignorant tyranny of majority w ill,
Freedom is never absolute. But it does not
seem unreasonable to expect Stanford women
(if they are indeed women and not little girls as
the social regs handbook would suggest) to be
able to set their own standards of personal eon
duct and to test those standards against circmn
tances and temptations of a real world.
Those women who feel they need the "moral
prop" provided by parietal hours should be al
lowed to retain it. The others, one hopes, the
majority, should be allowed the prerogatives of
their maturity.
The question of social regulations, however,
cannot be discussed in a vacuum for it finds its
meaning in the even more basic discussion of
university purpose. The crux of the matter is this:
does a university whose central business is aca
demic business have any business at all regulat
ing the private, non-academic lives of its mem
bers?
Unless we are mistaken, Stanford University
is neither a scout camp nor a monastery.
In fact, it claims to be an institution of higher
learning.
With this claim in mind, perhaps it would be
well for all of us to discard the attitudes and
rules of the scout camp and monaster)" and turn
with full energy to the business of teaching and
learning.
