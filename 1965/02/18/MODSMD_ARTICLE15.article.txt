# Letters To The Editor
## Thanks, Mr. Beck 
### 
Dear Mr. Beck:
The AWS Social Regulations
Committee and I, personally,
! would like to thank you for the
j most illuminating article which
appeared in Wednesday's Daily.
I Its concise and clear verbiage re-
I quires our acclamation and it is
I only with deep regrets that I
| write tiie following clarifications:
1. It was made clear to the So
cial Regulations Committee, at
the time our present investigation
was undertaken, that no reforms
in policy would be made for the
current academic year. We hope
that whatever changes are recom
mended will bo basic enough so
that such an extensive study, as
I tiie present one, will not be re
quired in tiie near future.
2. Therefore, "responsibility" is
of the utmost importance.
3. My nubby little fingers,
scarred with hours of coding,
have come to a grinding halt out
of sheer exhaustion and the al
most unbelievable reality t li a t
questionnaire number 1049 is com
pleted. Now, it is the dubious
honor of the computer center to
key-punch 2,000 cards, and feed
them to an IBM machine.
4. Therefore, it is with great!
pleasure and relief that I an- j
nounce tho astounding news that
the results of our fabled question-!
naire shall be released within the j
next two weeks.
5. And, if President Sterling
and Harvey Hall would like a,
copy (as you suggest), a limited
I supply will be made available. |
(j. The committee feels that lhe ;
length of the questionnaire ha si
| been a great advantage, rather
I than a detriment, because we now i
have a more complete picture of 1
' the women students and the ways (
in which they would like to set; i
j the present regulations changed.
7. The responses to the ques- j
j tionnaire were extremely bounti
ful in number and our harvest has
more than reaped its reward
j with tired eyes and happy hearts |
we shall present the Student Af-!
fairs and Services Committee
with a preliminary report of pro
posed reform by the end of this
quarter.
8. A thorough examination of
i social regulations reform is i
necessary and responsibility for
completeness is our intent.
Again, Mr. Beck, we wish to j
thank you for a most entertaining j
editorial.

• A Parent's Opinion
Editor, The Daily:
As the mother of a Stanford
freshman girl and as a veteran !
English teacher, I should like to
express an opinion.
If the Stanford admissions!
operate on as high a standard as I
they are supposed to (23 per cent I
of 1964 applicants — Ix>ok maga-|
zine), it seems to me that any!
girl accepted should be able to j
I handle herself without a compli-|
; eated set of rules and hours. I!
j appreciate the willingness of the I
! administration to act in the place j
j of a parent, but my husband and'
: I would not be willing to send
| our daughter so far away geo
graphically if we thought she
needed any more guide than the;
j famous Code. If she had not had'
high standards of her own, she,
would not have applied to Stan-!
I ford.
As an English teacher, I deeply:
resent the shadow cast on Staf
ford's T.A.'s. Again, if admission i
i to Stanford graduate school is as
| select as it is nationally believed
I to be, those selected should be

j able to handle wisely any material
which deserves to be called litera
ture. Remove from literature hu-1
man love, and you would have a
dull residue. I am happy to have
outgrown the tabus of my mother
and grandmother, the natural
products of Victorian "niceness."
During my daughter's Christmas
| vacation, I read all of her papers
written for English and paid spe
cial attention to her (male)
teacher's comments. I concluded
that she had a good teacher, and
we are all satisfied that she has
him again this term.
In this week's Tune, Stanford
rates at the top with girls. Let's
keep it this way without silly nit
picking.
MRS. SAM'OHD J. HANSON ;
• Go Paddle A Canoe
Editor, The Daily:
The arguments against appro- j
priation for graduate publica-:
tions presented at last week's i
meeting of the Legislature would j
have been laughable had the Leg- j
islature itself not taken them so
seriously. Although the legisla- j
tors seemed to suffer both con- j
science and pocketbook pangsj
over the issue, they could later
blithely appropriate funds for
canoe paddles. It might he fruit- j
ful to apply the arguments j
against the publications resolu-j
tion, which was referred and may j
be defeated, to the apparently I
more clear-cut issue of sporting i
equipment.
I would vote "no" on the latter
issue for the following reasons.
First, why should the Legislature
provide funds for this particular
sport, when there might be other
sports that, perhaps, some people
might want to engage in, some
day, possibly?
Second, not all Stanford stu
dents paddle canoes. The legisla
tion, therefore is not warranted
because it does not fulfill either
the need or the desire of a large
and, what is more important, rep-|
resent at ivc, group of students.
I, for one, am not going to let
a mere canoeist tell me what to
spend my money on. I can't pad
dle a canoe; I don't know of any
one who can; 1 don't know of j
anyone who does. I see no reason.:
therefore, why the Legislature
ought to endorse, underwrite, sup
port and encourage canoeing on ;
campus.
Third, what about a campus
squash court?
Fourth, has the Canoe Club
thought of other ways to solve its
problem? It might, for example,
hold a canoe race, and channel the |
profits toward paddles. (Well,!
maybe not a race — maybe a j
"drift." I guess with a race you j
would have to have a paddle, and
I guess that's what they need.
Still .) Better yet, they might
try to find some substitute for
paddles. Run a contest for sug
gestions, say I, and sec how many
people respond. Get: a mandate j
for campus canoeing. Find out
how many people are interested
enough in canoe paddles to un
earth a substitute for them. Has
the Canoe Club tried yardsticks?
Broom handles? Window poles?
Come now, canoe enthusiasts, you
can find another way. Buy the
paddles out of your own pocket, j
and rent them to recover your in-!
vestment. Woudln't that be the i
logical procedure?
I move, Mr. Speaker, that we
refer this whole issue to the Com
mittee on Hydro-Athletics, and 1 j
would like to propose an amend
ment to the resolution: rather I
than appropriate paddles, I sug
gest that we confiscate Ihe canoes.
