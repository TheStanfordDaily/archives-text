# Scratch Sheet Due For Fall Reg
## 
### 
The Stanford Scratch Sheet,
that sometimes witty, terse,
and pithy student evaluation
of course offered at Stan
ford, will once again put in
an appearance in prc-reg
lines. According to John Bry
son, chairman of tile Aca
<l e m i c Affairs Committee
which handles the survey, the
19(»;> version of the all-telling
little book should be out in
time for spring quarter pre
registration for fall classes.
Under the direction of John
Brooks and Doug Cushing,
both of whom are members
of the Academic Affairs Com
mittee, students will begin
distributing questionnaires to
classes in the next few weeks.
Courses have been divided
into ten academic areas, each
headed by a student chair
man. After the question
naires are tabulated, students
will write up a survey report
and description of each class.
This year's Scratch Sheet
will contain three or four
short paragraphs on about
75 courses. The presentation
form will be (1) Identifica
tion of the course number, de
partment, instructor, etc. ('!)
Description of the quality of
the course as derived from
questionnaire materials. (8)
Discussion of the reading
loads, midterms, kinds and
lengths of papers, and any
Important related informa
tion (such as prerequisites.)
Selection of courses to be
included in the Scratch Sheet
will be based on ready acces
sibility, general studies rele
vance, and special interest.
According to Bryson, th e
1%0 model will differ from

last year's Scratch Sheet both
in length and format. It is to
run approximately 40 pages—
the IJMJ4 verson was about
J 00.
Whereas the Scratch Sheet
of a year ago was conceived
primarily as a detailed rej»ort
of.course content, the new
sheet will give greater ex
pression to student evalua
tion.
Tlie hope of the commit tee
is to present a reasonably ob
jective and unbiased descrip
tion which can point out both
strengths and weaknesses. Its
double purpose is to provide
students with description and
criticism of a representative
number of classes (especially
in liberal arts), and also to
serve as a source of feed
back information to profes
sors.
Bryson reports that com
pilation of a student scratch
sheet has become common
practice at most large univer
sities, and the Stanford com
mittee carries on regular cor
respondence with similar
committees at other colleges.
According to Bryson, th e
committee has found that
most professors react favor
ably to a well-planned and
impartial student evaluation
system.
Although Bryson reports
that students composing the
Scratch Sheet will be "witty
when appropriate," he empha
sizes that "there will be no
attempt to l>e humorous at
anyone's expense."
The Scratch Sheet will also
be sold again next fall, to
make it available to entering
freshmen.
