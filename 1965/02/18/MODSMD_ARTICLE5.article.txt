## South Making Progress 
### 
A 11 a v d Lowenstein, 112 or m o 1
Stanford political science profes
sor and Stern Hall director, re-)
turned to the campus last even
ing. In an hour-long in formal j
presentation, Lowenstein detailed I
the progress that has been made j
in the Mississippi civil rights I

struggle during the past year
and one-half.
He began his talk with an out
line of the situation when the
first civil rights efforts began in
that state, in 1963. Finding the
ballot box and court litigation
wholly unrealistic as means for
affecting change, the first leader

j ship group sought other channels, j
| "We diagnosed the problem as I
i being unsolvable from within Mis-;
' sissippi itself," he said.
ROBERT MOSES, Lowenstein
and the others in the statej
("organization" decided that it j
Would ho necessary to get the I
federal government the con-;
I science of the nation. It was j
determined that national atten-j
lion would somehow have to be
drawn to the conditions in Mis
sissippi.
Th c re a 1 breakthrough, a s
Lowenstein, views it. came with
the Noverber, 1963. Aaron Henry
for-Governor campaign, the "free
dom vote." Stanford and Yale
Universities sent carloads of vo
lunteers to the state, and the
thought of possibly conducting a|
summer project was created as a
result.
That project. Lowenstein of
fered. "will someday be recog
nized as of the most important!
social and political events in our]
history."
Two changes that have occured
represent for A Hard Lowenstein!
proof that better times are com-!
ing. "First of all," he stated,
"Mississippi whites know they're,
beaten." The debate will shift, j
he predicted, to one between
moderate and extremist whites, j
rather than between whites and [
Negroes. Secondly, he pointed out.
Mississippi understands it will!
lose Democratic National Conven-1
t.ion representation, its Congress
men and federal money if it does
not move to give its Negroes
the franchise.
Among his concluding com- j
me nt s , he offered prospective)
rights workers the thought that,
"The process of contributing is so
important at this time when so!
many people are having trouble'
finding meaning in what's going
on." â–
