# Dean Fitzwater Resigns; Protests Case Handling
## 
### JAMES B. BRISCOE Managing Editor 
Associate Dean of Women Bonnie Fit/water resigned yester
day with an angry blast at University handling of the judicial con
troversy.
"I find it impossible to continue within the framework oi a
policy permitting the course of recent decisions." sik* stated in her

let ter of reslgnat ion. "t
"WORKING RELATIONSHIPS
among faculty, administrative
officers, and students demand an '
inherent respect for the rights I
and responsibilities of each group i
by the others," she said. "This'
integral factor of an educational j
institution has been dissolved by i
the administrative decisions of
the past few days."
Dean Fit/water, in an inter- (
view with The Daily, further I
charged that the investigation of;
the charges by a three-man sub-'
committee formed by the Exeeu- j
tive Committee of the Academic;
Council was "one-sided arid in
complete."
"They called primarily stu
dent witnesses," she noted, "and !
failed to call certain witnesses fa-1
vorablc to Dean Allen."
Tin; SUBC OMMITTEE was j
composed of Profs. Gerald Gun- j
ther, of the School of Law; Ken-)
neth Arrow, economics; and San
ford Dornbusch, sociology.
She further charged that Dean
Lucilc Allen's rights had been;
abrogated by the "unjust and sen-j
sational attack" made by a "small j
group of students."
"I cannot believe that restrict
ing academic freedom to the use)
of one group is an honorable dis-;
charge of the University's dedi-;
cation to its educational purpose," .

she stated.
SHE ALSO indicated that, in
' her opinion, Dean Allen was oper
lat in g completely within her
j sphere of responsibility in at
tempting to investigate the
• charges allegedly made against
the English Department.
"Any University officer has the
j responsibility and duty to be cog
nizant of events on campus and to
| establish the facts and validity of
; discussions," she stated. "It is the
• usual procedure in the Dean's
j Office to first establish what the
information and the facts are."
DEAN FITZWATER noted
that students were misusing their
"rights, privileges and freedoms"
in their "attacks" on Dean Allen."
"If our students do not acknowl
edge the responsibilities of free
dom, their post-university life
will be futile," she said in her let
j ter of resignation.
Dean Fitzwater came to Stan
ford in 1961 with Dean Allen. She
had formerly been Dean of Wom
en at Southern Methodist Univer
sity.
' Her resignation will become ef
! fective at the end of Winter Quar
| ter, March 19.
