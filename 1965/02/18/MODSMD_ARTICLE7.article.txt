### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
"The ghetto in the North is only
a symptom of the disease in tlie
South." John Love, the 24-year
old director of the Student Non
violent coordinating Committee
(SNCC) voting drive in Selma,
Alabama told a press conference
in Tresidder yesterday afternoon.
"And just as the disease spread
from the South," declared the
Harlem native who has worked in
Selma since last June, "so the
cure might spread from there
also."

One attempt at effecting a cure
in the South is being made in
Selma. "When SNCC first came to
Selma there were only 200 Ne
groes on the voting list out of 17,-
000 eligible Negroes, and no one
was even trying to register any
more. Now there is not only more
interest in voting, there is also
more willingness to stand up to
the inevitable harrassment and
intimidation."
Love said that the recent mass
demonstrations resulted from
Sheriff Jim Clark's handling of
the SNCC voter registration drive.

"The Klan doesn't, need tu do
i anything down there; Jim Clark
j does their job fur them."
Love described how last month
j Clark's "posse" herded 600 would
be voters into the alley behind
the county court house and told
i them to use the back door. "That's
when the arrests started. We
aren't going in back doors a ny
more."
But the only power than can
J keep the Selma Negro from being
sent to the back door or arrested
i is the federal government, Love
declared.
"My hope is that sooner or later
! the national government will rea
} lize its responsibilities. . . . This
j is a democracy and the govern-
I ment is supposed to guarantee the
: right to vote."
