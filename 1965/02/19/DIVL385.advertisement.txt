| Wko Is Jesus Christ?
Although Ik' wrote no books, travelled no more than ninety miles I
from His birth place, owned no property, animated no fortune, won only
j a handful of converts, and was crucified as a common criminal, the life
| of Jesus Christ has changed the entire course of world history and divided
; the ages into "8.C." and "A.1)." One may admire Mohammed, Buddha, I
or Confucius, hut the life of Jesus Christ is different in kind and character.
Yet today, many well-educated, well-informed collegeans have never read |
: the Biblical account of this one life and the man who lived it. Millions !
have died readily for Him and endured every manner of persecution, de- j
fending to their last breath- the New Testament claim that Jesus Christ j
was and is the Creator, and T.ifc-Ciiver. and the Sustaining (lod'of the j
universe:
"Jesus Christ is the exact likeness of the unseen God--—the visible j
representation of the invisible; He is the i'irst-l>orn of all creation. For it. j
was in Him that all things were created, in heaven and on earth, things j
seen and tiling unseen, whether thrones, dominions, rulers or authorities; j
j all things were created and exist through Him and in Him and for Him.
And He Himself existed before all things and in Him all things exist—
cohere, are held together. He also i-- the Head of His Iwxlv, the church;
j seeing He is the beginning, the first-born from among the dead, so that j
He alone in everything and in every respect might occupy the chict
| place stand first and be pre-eminent. For it has pleased the Father that
| all the divine fullness—the sum total of the divine, perfection, powers and
| attributes—should dwell in I lim permanently.
"And Cx»d purposed that through—, by the service, and intervention
of- Him all things should lie reconciled back to Himself, whether on
earth or in heaven, as through Him the bather made peace by means of
| the blood of lli> cross. And although you at one time were estranged and
| alienated from Him and of hostile attitude of mind in your wicked activi
j ties, yet now has Christ, the Mexsiah, reconciled you to (rod in the body
I of ffix flesh through death, in order to present yon holy ond faultless and
| irreproachable in llis bather's presence" (Colossians 1 : 15-22).
