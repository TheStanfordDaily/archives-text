and patrol boats closed in yesterday on a
strongly defended cove 235 miles northeast of

capsized there by Vietnamese aerial bomb;?
Tuesday.
Lt. Gen. Nguyen Khanh, commander of the

safely, without a 'head-on' collision with U.S.
military power."
And he made clear that lie saw no alterna

ing nations.
