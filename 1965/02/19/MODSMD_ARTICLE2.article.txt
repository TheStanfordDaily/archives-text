# DRY UP BOYS!
## Dolwig And The Senate Vs. The Stanford Male 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
"We've got to keep the boys
at Stanford walking a
straight path," declared Sen.
Richard J. Dolwig (R-San
Mateo) yesterday as he intro
duced a bill that would for
bid restaurants within 1 1
miles of the campus to serve
hard liquor.
Dolwig's bill would discon
tinue Ihe present policy of
allowing the Department of
Alcoholic Beverages Control
to issue on-sale alcohol licen
ses to "Premises licensed as
bona fide eating places"
within the 1 i mile limit.
IT WOULD, however only
prohibit new licenses and
would not in any ease ef
fect such venerable institu
tions as The "O", The "Rats."
and the "Busy Bee," since it
is not illegal to sell beer with
in the 1 ' , mile zone and
would not be even if Dolwig's
bill passes.
Dolwig told The Daily that
"certain groups in Menlo
Park" had urged him to in
troduce the legislation. "They
feel, as I do, that the now
housing developments spring
ing up around the campus
make a l'» mile limit neces
sary."
"When I went to Stanford,"
the graduate of the class of
'36 continued, "it was isolated.
Under present conditions rhe
problem of liquor sales is
more pertinent."
DOLWIG'S BILL does not

refer to Stanford in particu
lar; it only mentions "certain
universities." According to
the Associated Press, how
ever, the Senator added that
he "specifically had Stanford,
my alma mater, in mind."
His bill, killed in the Sen
ate Committee on Govern
mental Efficiency last year
in what Dolwig admitted was
"not a very close vote," may
have the support of Governor
Pat Brown this time.
On December 1 of last
year, ABC's San Jose super
visor Doyle Jensen told The
Daily, the Supreme Court
struck down an executive rule
instigated by the governor

that would have forbidden
the issuance of on-sale li
censes to any establishment
within one mile of the Uni
versity "if it was to be fre
quented by students."
THE GOVERNOR was un
available for comment yester
day and his aides were not
sure what stand he would
take.
At the present time, accord
ing to Robert Beyers of the
News and Publications De
partment. Stiekney's restaur
ant at 3398 El Camino Real,
is the only place in Dolwig's
"dry zone" that sells liquor.
Local reaction was mixed.
"THE 'O' has served beer
since 1932," the at tendon t
barkeep at Ihe Oasis Beer
Garden declared yesterday,
"and we plan to sell beer of
less than 4 percent content as
long as they'll let us."
The consensus at Stiekney s
was somewhat more critical.
One executive, who prefers to
remain anonymous until "the
organization" takes a public
stand, called Dolwig's pro
posal "ridiculous."
"Any place that has a cock
tail bar makes more money,"
he observed.
Susan Minkler, presently
a cashier at the Redwood City
Stiekney's said that when she
worked at the Stiekney's
restaurant in the Town and
Country Shopping Center,,
"ten or twenty people over a
three month period came in
and asked to be served, and
we couldn't serve them be
case of Stanford."

"We've got to keep the boys
at Stanford walking a
straight path," declared Sen.
Richard J. Dolwig (R-San
Mateo) yesterday as he intro
duced a bill that would for
bid restaurants within 1 1
miles of the campus to serve
hard liquor.
Dolwig's bill would discon
tinue Ihe present policy of
allowing the Department of
Alcoholic Beverages Control
to issue on-sale alcohol licen
ses to "Premises licensed as
bona fide eating places"
within the 1 i mile limit.
IT WOULD, however only
prohibit new licenses and
would not in any ease ef
fect such venerable institu
tions as The "O", The "Rats."
and the "Busy Bee," since it
is not illegal to sell beer with
in the 1 ' , mile zone and
would not be even if Dolwig's
bill passes.
Dolwig told The Daily that
"certain groups in Menlo
Park" had urged him to in
troduce the legislation. "They
feel, as I do, that the now
housing developments spring
ing up around the campus
make a l'» mile limit neces
sary."
"When I went to Stanford,"
the graduate of the class of
'36 continued, "it was isolated.
Under present conditions rhe
problem of liquor sales is
more pertinent."
DOLWIG'S BILL does not

refer to Stanford in particu
lar; it only mentions "certain
universities." According to
the Associated Press, how
ever, the Senator added that
he "specifically had Stanford,
my alma mater, in mind."
His bill, killed in the Sen
ate Committee on Govern
mental Efficiency last year
in what Dolwig admitted was
"not a very close vote," may
have the support of Governor
Pat Brown this time.
On December 1 of last
year, ABC's San Jose super
visor Doyle Jensen told The
Daily, the Supreme Court
struck down an executive rule
instigated by the governor

that would have forbidden
the issuance of on-sale li
censes to any establishment
within one mile of the Uni
versity "if it was to be fre
quented by students."
THE GOVERNOR was un
available for comment yester
day and his aides were not
sure what stand he would
take.
At the present time, accord
ing to Robert Beyers of the
News and Publications De
partment. Stiekney's restaur
ant at 3398 El Camino Real,
is the only place in Dolwig's
"dry zone" that sells liquor.
Local reaction was mixed.
"THE 'O' has served beer
since 1932," the at tendon t
barkeep at Ihe Oasis Beer
Garden declared yesterday,
"and we plan to sell beer of
less than 4 percent content as
long as they'll let us."
The consensus at Stiekney s
was somewhat more critical.
One executive, who prefers to
remain anonymous until "the
organization" takes a public
stand, called Dolwig's pro
posal "ridiculous."
"Any place that has a cock
tail bar makes more money,"
he observed.
Susan Minkler, presently
a cashier at the Redwood City
Stiekney's said that when she
worked at the Stiekney's
restaurant in the Town and
Country Shopping Center,,
"ten or twenty people over a
three month period came in
and asked to be served, and
we couldn't serve them be
case of Stanford."
