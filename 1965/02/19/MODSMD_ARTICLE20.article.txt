# 'BOOKS'—It's a Newspaper
## 
### 
There is something new under the sun. It is BOOKS, a rousing monthly newspaper
now in its second year of publication-. HOOKS believes that you art- better educated
and no longer slavishly follow the best-seller lists. HOOKS believes you want to know
everything that's published, especially l>y the university presses. Thoroughly covering the
book beat, HOOKS treats books, authors, and their seminal ideas as news. BOOKS is
the one newspaper people who really care about books say they can't get along without.
HOOKS makes books come alive. It has reported on Salinger's new novel; what hap
lined when Velikovsky published the earth-shaking "Worlds in Collision;" what's hap
pened to Norman O. Brown and "Life Against Death;" the smouldering old volcano, Ezra
Pound; Merle Miller's story of how people really act toward each other in the JOth
century; Joan Baez' battles; the LSI) books; the new Edward Lewis W'allant award; 13
profiles of notable suicides; Paul Weiss' 27 proofs of God's existance; the distinct and
indispensable contributions of Jewish-American writers; the big book on campus, "The
Reasonable Adventurer;" about Princeton's class of '54; Shel Silverstein's fantastic chil
dren's book, which took four years to get published; etc., etc.
Regular columns include the two-page "Cocktail Party." dazzling, inside talk of
books and publishjng; "Critics' Scoreboard," what book reviewers coast-to-coast are say
ing; "The Local Scene," reports on literary activities in communities around the country.
Plus a summary of almost every hardcover and paperback book published in your
fields of interest in the month they are published. NO OTHER PUBLICATION DOES
THIS.
James Purdy says: "HOOKS has shown very unusual methods . . . you actually men
tion authors whose books do not sell 100 copies an hour . . . How can you last? Isn't
America already beautiful enough without you?"

There is something new under the sun. It is BOOKS, a rousing monthly newspaper
now in its second year of publication-. HOOKS believes that you art- better educated
and no longer slavishly follow the best-seller lists. HOOKS believes you want to know
everything that's published, especially l>y the university presses. Thoroughly covering the
book beat, HOOKS treats books, authors, and their seminal ideas as news. BOOKS is
the one newspaper people who really care about books say they can't get along without.
HOOKS makes books come alive. It has reported on Salinger's new novel; what hap
lined when Velikovsky published the earth-shaking "Worlds in Collision;" what's hap
pened to Norman O. Brown and "Life Against Death;" the smouldering old volcano, Ezra
Pound; Merle Miller's story of how people really act toward each other in the JOth
century; Joan Baez' battles; the LSI) books; the new Edward Lewis W'allant award; 13
profiles of notable suicides; Paul Weiss' 27 proofs of God's existance; the distinct and
indispensable contributions of Jewish-American writers; the big book on campus, "The
Reasonable Adventurer;" about Princeton's class of '54; Shel Silverstein's fantastic chil
dren's book, which took four years to get published; etc., etc.
Regular columns include the two-page "Cocktail Party." dazzling, inside talk of
books and publishjng; "Critics' Scoreboard," what book reviewers coast-to-coast are say
ing; "The Local Scene," reports on literary activities in communities around the country.
Plus a summary of almost every hardcover and paperback book published in your
fields of interest in the month they are published. NO OTHER PUBLICATION DOES
THIS.
James Purdy says: "HOOKS has shown very unusual methods . . . you actually men
tion authors whose books do not sell 100 copies an hour . . . How can you last? Isn't
America already beautiful enough without you?"
