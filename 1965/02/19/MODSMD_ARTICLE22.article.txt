# 'Teahouse' Full Of Humor, Compassion And Wisdom
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
Its a funny thing, but often in the theater the most high
minded, noble and dramatic plays which attempt to say a great
deal about the nature of the human condition — or the condition
of human nature — wind up being nothing but highflown, pom-

pous and dull.
On the other hand, the most
lighthearted and seemingly giddy
comedy can, in its own amusing
way, say a great deal — and can
say it with wit and charm.
"Teahouse of the August Moon"
is such a comedy, and in its cur
rent production at San Carlos'
Circle Star it displays all of the
humor, the compassion and the
wisdom that won it the Pulitzer
Prize.
Wartime Wit
Its humor is the humor one
always finds in wartime — or in
this case post-wartime, since
"Teahouse" deals with the Ameri
can occupation of Okinawa after
World War 11. Its compassion is
the sort that comes from seeing
people one cares about in trouble
and sympathizing with them.
Its wisdom comes from — and
to — its characters, for whom
the learning process is often a dif
ficult one. But, as narrator-inter
preter Sakini says, "Pain makes
man think; thought makes man
wise, and wisdom makes life en
durable."
And with Eddie Bracken as Sa
kini, "Teahouse" is — in spite of
its three hour length — eminently
endurable. Playing a role he calls
one of his favorites, Bracken cap
tures all of Sakini's sly devilish
ness without sacrificing the gen
tleness that makes the third act:
so wonderfully touching.
Blakely Believable
As the hapless Captain Fisby
—whose career in the Army has
been a long series of mistakes
followed by "requests to request a
transfer" — Gene Blakely is in
gratiating. Reluctantly acceding
to the Okinawans' wishes, he in
advertently does the right thing.
When in the last act he informs
Sakini that "I'm making peace
with myself somewhere between
my ambitions and my limita
tions," he is entirely believable.
As the harassed Colonel Purdy,
Charles Alvin Bell is good. It is
a stereotyped role and Bell plays j
it as such — but he plays it well, j
Tom Winston, as a farm-happy i
Army psychiatrist, is hilarious
and adds immensely to the play's
humor. Barry Ford and Yuki Shi
moda are extremely good in the
only other English-speaking parts.
Orientals Excellent
Tsu Kobayashi is lovely an d
graceful as geisha girl Lotus
Blossom, and Tatsuo Hasekawa
and Mara Kim contribute excel
lent performances in non-English
speaking parts.
Hal Shafer's sets are effective,
with his teahouse itself a thing
of delicate beauty, and A 1 Mill
man's lighting is also good. The
music — by an unnamed com
poser — adds a pleasant touch.
Under Yuki Shimoda's unerring
direction, "Teahouse of the Aug
ust Moon" is a delightful produc
tion — well characterized by Sa
kini when he says "We go over
big, boss."

the sort that comes from seeing
people one cares about in trouble
and sympathizing with them.
Its wisdom comes from — and
to — its characters, for whom
the learning process is often a dif
ficult one. But, as narrator-inter
preter Sakini says, "Pain makes
man think; thought makes man
wise, and wisdom makes life en
durable."
And with Eddie Bracken as Sa
kini, "Teahouse" is — in spite of
its three hour length — eminently
endurable. Playing a role he calls
one of his favorites, Bracken cap
tures all of Sakini's sly devilish
ness without sacrificing the gen
tleness that makes the third act:
so wonderfully touching.
Blakely Believable
As the hapless Captain Fisby
—whose career in the Army has
been a long series of mistakes
followed by "requests to request a
transfer" — Gene Blakely is in
gratiating. Reluctantly acceding
to the Okinawans' wishes, he in
advertently does the right thing.
When in the last act he informs
Sakini that "I'm making peace
with myself somewhere between
my ambitions and my limita
tions," he is entirely believable.
As the harassed Colonel Purdy,
Charles Alvin Bell is good. It is
a stereotyped role and Bell plays j
it as such — but he plays it well, j
Tom Winston, as a farm-happy i
Army psychiatrist, is hilarious
and adds immensely to the play's
humor. Barry Ford and Yuki Shi
moda are extremely good in the
only other English-speaking parts.
Orientals Excellent
Tsu Kobayashi is lovely an d
graceful as geisha girl Lotus
Blossom, and Tatsuo Hasekawa
and Mara Kim contribute excel
lent performances in non-English
speaking parts.
Hal Shafer's sets are effective,
with his teahouse itself a thing
of delicate beauty, and A 1 Mill
man's lighting is also good. The
music — by an unnamed com
poser — adds a pleasant touch.
Under Yuki Shimoda's unerring
direction, "Teahouse of the Aug
ust Moon" is a delightful produc
tion — well characterized by Sa
kini when he says "We go over
big, boss."
Its a funny thing, but often in the theater the most high
minded, noble and dramatic plays which attempt to say a great
deal about the nature of the human condition — or the condition
of human nature — wind up being nothing but highflown, pom-

pous and dull.
On the other hand, the most
lighthearted and seemingly giddy
comedy can, in its own amusing
way, say a great deal — and can
say it with wit and charm.
"Teahouse of the August Moon"
is such a comedy, and in its cur
rent production at San Carlos'
Circle Star it displays all of the
humor, the compassion and the
wisdom that won it the Pulitzer
Prize.
Wartime Wit
Its humor is the humor one
always finds in wartime — or in
this case post-wartime, since
"Teahouse" deals with the Ameri
can occupation of Okinawa after
World War 11. Its compassion is
the sort that comes from seeing
people one cares about in trouble
and sympathizing with them.
Its wisdom comes from — and
to — its characters, for whom
the learning process is often a dif
