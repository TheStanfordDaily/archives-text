# 'THE POSSESSED'
## Dostoevsky's Ideas Retained 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
Before 1 began last weekend to
i read Camus' dramatization of
"The Possessed," I had some
grave misgivings. I wondered how
it would be possible to convert
into workable dramatic form Dos
toievsky's sprawling, populous
novel of ideas; after reading
Camus' attempt, I felt he had
undertaken an impossible task.
With the limitations of length
that a play imposes, there simply
is not enough time to develop the
characters sufficiently so that they
become more than mouthpieces
for ideas. Further, Camus was not
able to find a central focus for the
many strands of the episodic plot,

and the resulting diffusion makes
relationships among the many
characters unclear.
What Camus has managed to
bring off, however, is a clear and
intelligent exposition of Dostoev
sky's ideas. As an intellectual exor
cise, his play is consistantly en
gaging.
Excitement Achieved
The Stanford Players' current
production of the play achieves
this same intellectual excitement
and clarity, and the profundities
of Dostoevsky's writing illuminate
the evening.
But there is something more, for j
in addition to challenging tho mind, |
the Stanford presentation attempts
to engage the viewer's feelings,

and it succeeds to a degree I would
novo have imagined possible.
Under the painstaking direction |
of Leon Katz, Dostoevsky's ideas ,
are more accessible by their ex- j
pression through characters who i
live. To be sure, the characters'
reality is not maintained through
out ; one senses now and again that
tic is watching a brilliant seminar,
but on the stage of the Little The
atre there is the undeniable sweep
and force of intense emotion.
Characters Complex
The characters suffer, they are
imprisoned by their inability to i
love, they are possessed by the
devils of nihilism and blind revo- j
lution, they desperately need I
meaning and purpose at the same j
time that they deny, they hate and I
destroy, they denounce God as J
fiercely as they need some outside i
force to guide them.
There are explosions of outward j
conflict and violence, there are sug-1
gestions of internalized pain; there
are flashes of sardonic humor and j
moments of stunning drama; j
scenes of quiet frustration are j
punctuated with scenes of action i
and movement. And throughout !
there is the sense that the search
for meaning in Dostoevsky's Rus
sia is relevant to the search for
meaning in mid-twentieth-century
America.
This excitement is sustained by
a cast which has responded in uni
son to what doubtless must have
been inspiring direction. Con
fronted with establishing ex
tremely complex characterizations
in a short time, however, most of
the actors do either slightly too
much or too little. But without ex
ception, they are headed in the
right direction, and whatever ex
cesses or deficiencies I noted Tues
day evening will probably be
smoothed out by the weekend per
formances.
ftxeellent Actors
Limitations of space prevent
me from giving proper attention i
to each of the actors, but let me i
at least single out for special j
praise Ruth Hunt's tyrannical and
moving Varvara (her perform
ance is acting of the highest es-j
tate), Donald Patterson's solid j
Stavrogin, Gerald Hiken's ingra !
tiating Stepan, and Norma Ed-1
wards' immaculate work in thei
brief role of Prascovya.
In an effort to untangle the!
plot complexities, Dr. Katz has 1
wisely given more dialogue to a !
narrator who ties events together. 1
introduces characters, guides us i
through the intricate chronology. |
and even on occasion outlines key I
themes. But ihe surging forward |
movement of Dr. Katz's direction j
keeps events at such a pace that '
I suspect the viewer without;
prior knowledge will be at some- j
what of a loss.
Dr. Katz has also rearranged
the position of some scenes; this j
is particularly helpful in the new j
opening scene wherein Stavro- j
gin confesses to a priest the rea- i
son why he has chosen to live!
an "ironic" iife. With this con !
fession as a reference point, Stav-j
l ogin is established unambigu-j
ously as the central character, and J
in the light of his confession, his!
nihilism, his lovelessness, his re-1
pression, his indifference, his!
acute conscience, and his uncanny |
influence in molding the lives of;
others is clarified. Indeed, in be-1
coming a presentation of Stavro
gin's spiritual development, the;
revised play achieves a unity that
is so lacking in Camus' version.
This careful, creative produc
tion demands everyone's attention.
