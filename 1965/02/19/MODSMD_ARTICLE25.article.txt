jby Rene Clement about the effects of World War II on two young
! French children. It's at Tresidder today.
; GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 is perhaps the best of the Hollywood
musicals of the 1930'5. Starring Dick Powell, Joan Blondell and Ruby

movie at Tresidder tomorrow features elaborate choreography by
Busby Berkeley.
COME BLOW YOUR HORN is the film of the Broadway comedy
by Noil Simon (who also wrote "Barefoot in the Park") about a play
boy bachelor- played by Frank Sinatra who teaches his younger
brother some of his techniques, only to find HIS girls now attracted
to the younger brother. It's at the flicks Sunday.
SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON is the subtle, sensitive film
written and directed by Bryan ("L-Shaped Room") Forbes about a
medium who stages a kidnapping to display her clairvoyant powers.
Kim Stanley is the odds-on bet for the Oscar for her performance as
j the medium, and is ably assisted by Richard Altcnborough as her
! henpecked husband in this film at the Fine Arts.
MARRIAGE—ITALIAN STYLE teams "Yesterday, Today and To
j morrow" actors Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni and director

; her.
MARY POPPINS, perhaps Walt Disney's best movie, stars Julio
! Andrews as the "practically perfect" English nanny who jumps
; through sidewalk chalk drawings and slides UP bannisters. Miss An-
I dreWs is superb at the head of a uniformly excellent cast in this
I musical fantasy at the Varsity.
THE COOL WORLD is a film by Shirley ("The Connection")
Clark about juvenile delinquency in Harlem. Filmed with a largely
j non-professional cast, it is at the Paris with WOMEN OF THE
WORLD.

| South Pacific island during World War 11, with Leslie Caron as a
: woman who with a group of young girls interrupts his idyllic ex
' istence. BEDTI.ME STORY stars David Niven and in what seems
to be some particularly appropriate typecasting Marlon Brando as
a pair of gigolos in the comedy cofeatured at the Park.
THOSE CALLOWAYS stars Brian Keith, Vera Miles and Brandon
DeWilde as three members of a family thai traps wild animals in
i northern New England. A Walt Disney film, it is at the Stanford
with Jules Verne's MYSTERIOUS ISLAND.
GOLDFINGER stars Sean Connery as the supersmooth British
{secret agent James Bond in the film of one of lan Fleming's wildest
{books. Featuring a robbery of Fort Knox and a wild car chase (in
1 which Bond drives a car equipped with machine guns in the bumper,
built-in smoke and oil screens, and an ejection seat for any unwanted
i passenger), it is still at the Bijou.
