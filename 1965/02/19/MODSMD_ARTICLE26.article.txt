# Red Rugby Team Seeks Victory Against UCLA
## 
### 
Looking for their "toughest
game of the season so far." as
Coach Pete Kmetovie put it. Stan
ford's rugby team will play host
to UCLA tomorrow at 1:30.
Fresh from their fifth victory
in a row last weekend over South
ern Cal, whom I hey defeated 20-0,
the Indians will find the Bruins
elusive on the open field.
THK BUI INS arc led by foot
ball players who have changed
their pads and helmets for shorts
and knee-high socks.
The Bruin's squad will not only
have the experience gained from
football going for them but they
will also have the experience
gained from four other rugby
contests. Their record is 2-2.
Last week UCLA barelj lost to
Cal who has one of the finest
teams in the area, 17-11. As Kme
tovie phrased it, "They looked
real strong." They have also lost
to Long Beach 12-11.
BASICALLY Stanford will use
the same line-up with Stanford's

depth strengih being relied upon
heavily. The fleet feet of Bob
Blunt, Dick Ragsdale, and Dan
Terpack will certainly come in
handy against the strong arms
from the South.
Next week-end the Indians will
entertain the University of Cali
fornia in the first part of rugby's
"Big Game." Stanford will then
travel to Cal the following week
end and the victor of these two
games will decide the winner of
"The Big Game Scrum Axe."
