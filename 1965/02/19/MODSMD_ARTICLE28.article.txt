# Hope To Avenge Loss
## Boxers Fight Cal Tonight 
### TOM EDISON 
Scouting for its first victory of
the s e a so n, Stanford's boxing
squad will mix it up tonight with
the Bears at Cal in their next to
last varsity match of the season.
Cal barely beat the Indians in
their previous meeting, .VI.
Cal has since beaten both Ne
vada and Chico State and a vic
tory over Stanford would wrap
up the league championship for
them. Stanford lost to Nevada 7-2
in their only other match of the
season.
STANFORD'S earlier defeat
by the Bears can be attributed to
losses in the heavier weight divi
sions. Stanford did not win the
last four matches and a definite
weakness has been shown in the
Indians' heavier boxers in both
matches.
If Stanford shows a weakness
in the heavyweight divisions. Cal
shows a strength.
The Bears' 156-pounder Tom
Gioseffi has won the conference
title for the last two years and
has not lost a bout since early

in his sophomore year. Gioseffi is
rated as possibly the finest col
legiate boxer in the nation.
AT 165 POI NDS, Paul Rein, a
two-year letlerman, is also unde
feated this year. Walt Cumming
ham, Cal's heavyweight boxer,
knocked out Stanford's Tom Yan
gcr in their first meeting. How
ever, Cal's strength in their light
er boxers is bare.
For Stanford, might lies in their
light. Currently Ruby Ober/an,
Jim Conti, and George Bellows
are undefeated. Ober/an and
Conti definitely have to be the
most colorful Indian boxers.
Oberxan's b:;ut with Paul Bell
should be another donneybrook
In their previous meeting both of
these Impounders fought il out
to the very end. Ober/an is unde

feated in throe years of boxing
but fought to a draw last year
against Bell.
rONTI CARRIES the biggest
and most lethal weapon for ihe
Indians. In his bout with Nevada
he set his opponent down in the
first round with one resounding
punch.
Bellows has shown some out
standing defensive maneuvers but
his offensive punch is lacking.
Bellows fought to a draw in the
Nevada match and knocked out a
victory againsi hK Bear oppo
nent.
Stanford's forfeit in the 125-
pound bout may have a direct
bearing on Ihe match's outcome.
This forfeit provided Cal with
their margin for victory in thoii
last meeting.
IK STANFORD is 10 win thev
must win in their usual style in
the lighter classes and eke out a
win in the heavier weight divi
sions.
Stanford's final boxing malch
will be against Chico State March
ti. Their performance in the con
ference tournament March 1!)-2i
is a possibility.
