Professor William Rivers of the
Communications Department indi
cted what ho called the "humor
less approach" that literary ent
ire take toward their work in
yesterday's installment of the
Tresidder Authors Series.
This overly serious attitude, he
explained, is a result of a
doctrinaire approach to literary
analysis and produces writing
that is "grim."
'THE MOST frequent accusa
tions made by one critic of an
other is that he fails to state his
standards of evaluation," a fact
which Rivers said is a sign of a
desire to establish "mathematical"
methods for criticism.
