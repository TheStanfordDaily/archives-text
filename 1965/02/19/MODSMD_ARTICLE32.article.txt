Southern Cal. crushed UCLA |
S3-S in their encounter earlier this
season. USC tackled the Indians, j
70-25, but had a number of ex- i
tremely tight races." 6 The tribe
should be in good shape for spear- j
ing the Bruins.

anemic 3-5 record this season. Of j
the remaining dual meets of the

2-1 tally. UCLA and Cal should go
down before the tribe, but Foot- j
hill threatens to give the Indians j
rough water.

Friday away and Cal here next j
Saturday. After that the Indians:
travel north to Eugene, Oregon, a ;
a pool of many sorrows for Stan-,
ford's varsity, to compete in the
AAWU championships. The NCAA
championships come up March
25-27.

weekend toppled an NCAA fresh
man record and three Stanford
