# Indians Travel North; Battle Unpredictables
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Displax ing inconsistent pla\ last weekend, Stanford's basket
hall sqnad will oppose the Washington Huskies tonight and will
again perform before a regional television audience Saturda\
afternoon when they play Washington State. Both games are
north in the timber country.
Although both squads currently displax unimpressive confer-

ence records of 3-5 (Wash.) and*
2-6 (WSU>, they are capable of
playing winning basketball. How
ever, to win their top individual

performers must be having one
of their better nights because be
low two or three men it becomes
awfully slim.
TINS TYI'K of p!a\ was demon
strated by the Cougars hist week
end when they barely lost to
UCLA 70-68 and USC 59-57.
To achieve this height the
Cougars relied on the brilliant
play of center Ted Werner. Wer
ner, 6' 8", 230 pounds, scored 13
points in the two games and
grabbed 36 rebounds. Against the
high-flying Bruins alone he flip
ped in 27 points and pounced for
24 rebounds.
The Huskies also rely on this
type of individual play to win.
Forward Lynn Nance, at 6'6" and
averaging almost 20 points a
game in conference action, pulled
the Huskies along two weeks ago
and also nearly upset UCLA,
78-75.
The Cougars with Werner play
ing at his best and with the ad
dition of 6'7" Randy Stoll. who
was out for eight games because
of scholastic ineligibility, may
give the Indians the same type of
treatment that OSU did last week
end.
It will be left to be seen if the
Huskies can put together a consis
tent attack and revenge the out
come of their previous meeting
with Stanford which they lost
80-68.
