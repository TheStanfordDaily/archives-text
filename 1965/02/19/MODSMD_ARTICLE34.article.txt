The Stanford varsity Gymnas
tics team faces an awesome col
lection of stuntmen this evening
as il meets the University of Cali
fornia. The "Big Circus" is at
Berkeley, starting at 7:00 p.m.,
[with the Stanford - Cal boxing!
j match immediately following.
THE BEAKS are rivaled only by
Washington to represent district :
Mght in ihe NCAA national dual j
meet competition. Several B ears
: rank high in national gymnastics
ratings, including Dan Millman
(second in trampoline, eighth in
| floor excercisei, Lonnie Kapp
i (eighth in high bar), and Rich
j Field (third in rings).
Although ihc Tribe showed
j marked improvement in their j
| swing south last week, losing to ;
| USC and UCLA, there is little hope
i of stopping the California on
j slaught and the Bears 55-meet win
; streak. Card mentor John Gilmore
: forsees that Stanford may salvage
i places in the trampoline and the
J side-horse and will be concentrat
ing on improving individual scores.
