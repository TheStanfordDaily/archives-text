# A
						Noble Idea

### 
In his Valentine's Day memorandum on the
Crow-Halverson report, President Wallace Ster
ling vowed to establish a student-iacuity-staff
committee to study the problem ol intra-univer
sitv communications.
It was a noble idea. It still is a noble idea.
And it will no doubt continue to be a noble idea
during the ensuing weeks or months or years
of crises and problems while the committee is
waiting to be appointed.
Patience is a great virtue: A Stanford aphor
ism.
Anyhow, assuming that the committee does
eventually come into being (and, assuming, with
trepidation, that the selection of members allows
for a range of divergent views) it might be well
for it to begin by discussing the problems in
herent in discussing the "problem of communica
tion."
There arc now, as there have been in the
past, a few "channels of communication" through
which individuals may seek redress for griev
ances.
Hopefully, the committee will find means to
multiply these "channels' and make their exis
tence known to the faculty and students at large.
Hopefully also, the committee will address itself
directlv to the problem of those staff members,

particularly the deans, who have to walk a tight
rope 1 between their roles as "disciplinarians" and
"counsellors."
Indeed, perhaps it would not be too far afield
for a committee on communication to begin a
study of the entire structure of the administration
—a structure which blocks true communication
1)\ forcing the deans to act as a buffer between
the students and higher administrative echelons,
and inhibits creative leadership by putting the
deans in the unenviable position of having to en
force and interpret policies in whose formula
tion they have had very little part.
Yet, even assuming that the committee could
resolve these dilemmas (a large assumption), it
more basic "problem of communication" would
remain to plague us.
The crux of the matter is this: The most im
portant kind of "communication" within a uni
versitx community is tlu« absolutely unfettered
communication of ideas from one "learner" to an
other.
And this kind of communication can only
occur, to any degree that is really challenging,
if the university feels secure enough within itself
to not only tolerate, but welcome, dissidents,
rebels, non-conformists, and even, perish the
thought, people who are simply "wrong.
Stanford does not vet feel that secure.
