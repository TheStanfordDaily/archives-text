## Drekmeier Expands On Speech 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
There is the story about the two
charwomen arguing across the ex
panse of an alley. They never
could come to an agreement be
cause they were arguing from
different premises. Your reporter
and I may have the same prob
lem, for I can make no sense of
the statement attributed to me in
Wednesday's Daily regarding the
need for universities "to appeal
to arguments which arc no) very
convincing to the businessman"
when Ihcy attempt to deprive stu
dents of rights.
The article was faithful to the
general theme of my talk at
Stern, but I would like to expand
a little on rny remarks. In my
attempt to clarify what is meant
by the ambiguous term "aca
demic freedom of students," I
mentioned that the AAUP under
stands the issue as essentially a
matter of ensuring procedural due
proces in cases of alleged
misconduct, protection against
improper disclosures on academic
records, the safeguarding of off
campus freedom, and the like.
These protections are generally
related to a view of education
which links formal learning to a
wider participation in the affairs
of the community and to broad
self-government a view which
is critical of the concept of th e
college as a public utility provid
ing for the technical requirements
of society, or the college as a kind
of "pretend" world.
In tracing the development of
the type of educational theory
that is expressed in President
Kerr's Godkin Lectures at Har
vard, I discussed the different ar
guments that have been used to
justify business hierarchies and
guide the work relations of man
agers and employees. Many of
these ideas can be found lurking
behind the policies that regulate
the colleges of this country. The
distinction between the structures
and purposes of industrial bureau
cracies and the university has be
come less clear as the latter has
undertaken to educate more and
more young people, as academic
specialization has increased, as
the need for trained personnel
in industry and government has
become pressing, and as a result
of a number of other develop
ments. The so-called "human t ela
tions" approach has penetrated
the university in the form of
parentalist theories which are
felt as degrading to many stu
dents. And, at the same time, the
protection of faculty academic
freedom is not considered a par
ticularly urgent problem because
the nature of pressures has
changed. Controls are frequently
of a much subtler type than for
merly was the case: they grow
out of a suspicion of those who
don't fit the desired routines and
the established compartments of
knowledge. The "easing out" be

gins when a graduate student al
lows foundation money to deter
mine his field of concentration.
The undergraduate, reading that
the aim of a liberal education is
"to keep us from being over
whelmed" or "to help us interpret
our lives" must often feel suffo
cated by the proliferation of
methods courses in some depart
ments, the diminishing opportuni
ties for interdisciplinary study,
the almost complete victory of
social science over social philoso
phy. He, too, is eased out if his
interests lie in areas or ap
proaches that graduate programs
consider too unwieldy or inter
disciplinary lo handle. A part of
the discontent we arc witnessing
is a student insistence on a return
to "elite" forms of education that
flourished in a day when social
demands on the college were more
general and less vigorous, and in
which establishments of higher
learning were formulaiors rather
than instruments of national pur
pose.
I know that I have come a long
way from traditional interpreta
tions of academic freedom, but
these considerations seem to mo a
justified extension of the prin
ciples that inhere in the concept.
Now that a Stanford dean, in a
recent statement, has implied that
academic freedom extends to ad
ministrators as well as those on
either end of the teaching log, I
admit that the issue threatens to
become very complex. We ought
to keep it within the context of
the collegia! system, and I would
pursue this if The Daily did not
object to long-windedness.

â€¢ A New Low
Editor, The Daily:
Now that our "sex scandal" has
simmered down a little, perhaps 1
can say a few calm words about
it. If ever a newspaper was a rag,
it must then have been like The
Daily on 4 Feb. I congratulate you
on your performance: you have
hit a new low. That said, I'll turn
to more constructive comment.
You did do something good
when you got this whole busi
ness about academic freedom out
into the open. It's about time
someone brought it out from un
der the rug. But the way you did
it only led to further confusion
of the whole issue. What you did
was confuse academic freedom
with the Stanford student's sex
life. Frankly, I can't set anything
but the remotest connection be
tween the two.
May 1 clarify? The issue at
stake involves not sex, but free
dom of thought: not morals, but
discipline. Freedom of thought
and student discipline are impor
tant university issues; but my sex
life and morals are my own busi
ness. Stanford people have a

unique capacity for analyzing
everything and understanding
nothing; therefore I'll point out
what I believe our errors of
thought are.
First, to my fellow students: we
have too little respect for discip
line. Anything we don't like we
jump to point out as evil, and so
we have unnecessarily castigated
the administration in 4 Feb.'s
Daily. Now the adminstration:
I'm afraid they deserve much
of the abuse they get. They have
begun by imposing on us a Funda
mental Standard, without explain
ing to us whether it applies to
morals or discipline. In their na
tural desire to control the stu
dents as much as possible, t hey
apply it to our morals. Of course,
many of the students don't believe
in morality as the administration
sees it. And, as I mentioned be
fore, our morals are not the ad
ministration's business; their job
is to impose necessary discipline.
To finish, I'll ask everyone this:
why do we get so worked up over
sex? It's as good and natural a
function of life as eating, drink
ing, sleeping, or eliminating. They
all require regulation to deliver
their maximum benefit, but it is
the individual who must do the
regulating. All the English teach
ers have done is talk about a per
vasive fact of life; I certainly hope
they continue doing so.

discipline. Freedom of thought
and student discipline are impor
tant university issues; but my sex
life and morals are my own busi
ness. Stanford people have a

unique capacity for analyzing
everything and understanding
nothing; therefore I'll point out
what I believe our errors of
thought are.
First, to my fellow students: we
have too little respect for discip
line. Anything we don't like we
jump to point out as evil, and so
we have unnecessarily castigated
the administration in 4 Feb.'s
Daily. Now the adminstration:
I'm afraid they deserve much
of the abuse they get. They have
begun by imposing on us a Funda
mental Standard, without explain
ing to us whether it applies to
morals or discipline. In their na
tural desire to control the stu
dents as much as possible, t hey
apply it to our morals. Of course,
many of the students don't believe
in morality as the administration
sees it. And, as I mentioned be
fore, our morals are not the ad
ministration's business; their job
is to impose necessary discipline.
To finish, I'll ask everyone this:
why do we get so worked up over
sex? It's as good and natural a
function of life as eating, drink
ing, sleeping, or eliminating. They
all require regulation to deliver
their maximum benefit, but it is
the individual who must do the
regulating. All the English teach
ers have done is talk about a per
vasive fact of life; I certainly hope
they continue doing so.
JOHN RABY
Editor, The Daily:
There is the story about the two
charwomen arguing across the ex
panse of an alley. They never
could come to an agreement be
cause they were arguing from
different premises. Your reporter
and I may have the same prob
lem, for I can make no sense of
the statement attributed to me in
Wednesday's Daily regarding the
need for universities "to appeal
to arguments which arc no) very
convincing to the businessman"
when Ihcy attempt to deprive stu
dents of rights.
The article was faithful to the
general theme of my talk at
Stern, but I would like to expand
a little on rny remarks. In my
attempt to clarify what is meant
by the ambiguous term "aca
demic freedom of students," I
mentioned that the AAUP under
stands the issue as essentially a
matter of ensuring procedural due
proces in cases of alleged
misconduct, protection against
improper disclosures on academic
records, the safeguarding of off
campus freedom, and the like.
These protections are generally
related to a view of education
which links formal learning to a
wider participation in the affairs
of the community and to broad
self-government a view which
is critical of the concept of th e
college as a public utility provid
ing for the technical requirements
of society, or the college as a kind
of "pretend" world.
In tracing the development of
the type of educational theory
that is expressed in President
Kerr's Godkin Lectures at Har
vard, I discussed the different ar
guments that have been used to
justify business hierarchies and
guide the work relations of man
agers and employees. Many of
these ideas can be found lurking
behind the policies that regulate
the colleges of this country. The
distinction between the structures
and purposes of industrial bureau
cracies and the university has be
come less clear as the latter has
undertaken to educate more and
more young people, as academic
specialization has increased, as
the need for trained personnel
in industry and government has
become pressing, and as a result
of a number of other develop
ments. The so-called "human t ela
tions" approach has penetrated
the university in the form of
parentalist theories which are
felt as degrading to many stu
dents. And, at the same time, the
protection of faculty academic
freedom is not considered a par
ticularly urgent problem because
the nature of pressures has
changed. Controls are frequently
of a much subtler type than for
merly was the case: they grow
out of a suspicion of those who
don't fit the desired routines and
the established compartments of
knowledge. The "easing out" be

gins when a graduate student al
lows foundation money to deter
mine his field of concentration.
The undergraduate, reading that
the aim of a liberal education is
"to keep us from being over
whelmed" or "to help us interpret
our lives" must often feel suffo
cated by the proliferation of
methods courses in some depart
ments, the diminishing opportuni
ties for interdisciplinary study,
the almost complete victory of
social science over social philoso
phy. He, too, is eased out if his
interests lie in areas or ap
proaches that graduate programs
consider too unwieldy or inter
disciplinary lo handle. A part of
the discontent we arc witnessing
is a student insistence on a return
to "elite" forms of education that
flourished in a day when social
demands on the college were more
general and less vigorous, and in
which establishments of higher
learning were formulaiors rather
than instruments of national pur
pose.
I know that I have come a long
way from traditional interpreta
tions of academic freedom, but
these considerations seem to mo a
justified extension of the prin
ciples that inhere in the concept.
Now that a Stanford dean, in a
recent statement, has implied that
academic freedom extends to ad
ministrators as well as those on
either end of the teaching log, I
admit that the issue threatens to
become very complex. We ought
to keep it within the context of
the collegia! system, and I would
pursue this if The Daily did not
object to long-windedness.

â€¢ A New Low
Editor, The Daily:
Now that our "sex scandal" has
simmered down a little, perhaps 1
can say a few calm words about
it. If ever a newspaper was a rag,
it must then have been like The

hit a new low. That said, I'll turn

You did do something good

someone brought it out from un

it only led to further confusion
of the whole issue. What you did
was confuse academic freedom
with the Stanford student's sex

but the remotest connection be
tween the two.

tions of academic freedom, but
these considerations seem to mo a
justified extension of the prin
ciples that inhere in the concept.
Now that a Stanford dean, in a
recent statement, has implied that
academic freedom extends to ad
ministrators as well as those on
either end of the teaching log, I
admit that the issue threatens to
become very complex. We ought
to keep it within the context of
the collegia! system, and I would
pursue this if The Daily did not

â€¢ A New Low
Editor, The Daily:
Now that our "sex scandal" has
simmered down a little, perhaps 1
can say a few calm words about
it. If ever a newspaper was a rag,
it must then have been like The
Daily on 4 Feb. I congratulate you
on your performance: you have
hit a new low. That said, I'll turn
to more constructive comment.
You did do something good
when you got this whole busi
ness about academic freedom out
into the open. It's about time
someone brought it out from un
der the rug. But the way you did
it only led to further confusion
of the whole issue. What you did
was confuse academic freedom
with the Stanford student's sex
life. Frankly, I can't set anything
but the remotest connection be
tween the two.
May 1 clarify? The issue at
stake involves not sex, but free
dom of thought: not morals, but
discipline. Freedom of thought
and student discipline are impor
tant university issues; but my sex
life and morals are my own busi
ness. Stanford people have a

unique capacity for analyzing
everything and understanding
nothing; therefore I'll point out
what I believe our errors of
thought are.
First, to my fellow students: we
have too little respect for discip
line. Anything we don't like we
jump to point out as evil, and so
we have unnecessarily castigated
the administration in 4 Feb.'s
Daily. Now the adminstration:
I'm afraid they deserve much
of the abuse they get. They have
begun by imposing on us a Funda
mental Standard, without explain
ing to us whether it applies to
morals or discipline. In their na
tural desire to control the stu
dents as much as possible, t hey
apply it to our morals. Of course,
many of the students don't believe
in morality as the administration
sees it. And, as I mentioned be
fore, our morals are not the ad
ministration's business; their job
is to impose necessary discipline.
To finish, I'll ask everyone this:
why do we get so worked up over
sex? It's as good and natural a
function of life as eating, drink
ing, sleeping, or eliminating. They
all require regulation to deliver
their maximum benefit, but it is
the individual who must do the
regulating. All the English teach
ers have done is talk about a per
vasive fact of life; I certainly hope
they continue doing so.
JOHN RABY
Editor, The Daily:
There is the story about the two
charwomen arguing across the ex
panse of an alley. They never
could come to an agreement be
cause they were arguing from
different premises. Your reporter
and I may have the same prob
lem, for I can make no sense of
the statement attributed to me in
Wednesday's Daily regarding the
need for universities "to appeal
to arguments which arc no) very
convincing to the businessman"
when Ihcy attempt to deprive stu
dents of rights.
The article was faithful to the
general theme of my talk at
Stern, but I would like to expand
a little on rny remarks. In my
attempt to clarify what is meant
by the ambiguous term "aca
demic freedom of students," I
mentioned that the AAUP under
stands the issue as essentially a
matter of ensuring procedural due
proces in cases of alleged
misconduct, protection against
improper disclosures on academic
records, the safeguarding of off
campus freedom, and the like.
These protections are generally
related to a view of education
which links formal learning to a
wider participation in the affairs
of the community and to broad
self-government a view which
is critical of the concept of th e
college as a public utility provid
ing for the technical requirements
of society, or the college as a kind
of "pretend" world.
In tracing the development of
the type of educational theory
that is expressed in President
Kerr's Godkin Lectures at Har
vard, I discussed the different ar
guments that have been used to
justify business hierarchies and
guide the work relations of man
agers and employees. Many of
these ideas can be found lurking
behind the policies that regulate
the colleges of this country. The
distinction between the structures
and purposes of industrial bureau
cracies and the university has be
come less clear as the latter has
undertaken to educate more and
more young people, as academic
specialization has increased, as
the need for trained personnel
in industry and government has
become pressing, and as a result
of a number of other develop
ments. The so-called "human t ela
tions" approach has penetrated
the university in the form of
parentalist theories which are
felt as degrading to many stu
dents. And, at the same time, the
protection of faculty academic
freedom is not considered a par
ticularly urgent problem because
the nature of pressures has
changed. Controls are frequently
of a much subtler type than for
merly was the case: they grow
out of a suspicion of those who
don't fit the desired routines and
the established compartments of
knowledge. The "easing out" be

gins when a graduate student al
lows foundation money to deter
mine his field of concentration.
The undergraduate, reading that
the aim of a liberal education is
"to keep us from being over
whelmed" or "to help us interpret
our lives" must often feel suffo
cated by the proliferation of
methods courses in some depart
ments, the diminishing opportuni
ties for interdisciplinary study,
the almost complete victory of
social science over social philoso
phy. He, too, is eased out if his
interests lie in areas or ap
proaches that graduate programs
consider too unwieldy or inter
disciplinary lo handle. A part of
the discontent we arc witnessing
is a student insistence on a return
to "elite" forms of education that
flourished in a day when social
demands on the college were more
general and less vigorous, and in
which establishments of higher
learning were formulaiors rather
than instruments of national pur
pose.

ments. The so-called "human t ela
tions" approach has penetrated
the university in the form of
parentalist theories which are
felt as degrading to many stu
dents. And, at the same time, the
protection of faculty academic
freedom is not considered a par
ticularly urgent problem because
the nature of pressures has
changed. Controls are frequently
of a much subtler type than for
merly was the case: they grow
out of a suspicion of those who
don't fit the desired routines and
the established compartments of
knowledge. The "easing out" be

gins when a graduate student al
lows foundation money to deter
mine his field of concentration.
The undergraduate, reading that
the aim of a liberal education is
"to keep us from being over
whelmed" or "to help us interpret
our lives" must often feel suffo
cated by the proliferation of
methods courses in some depart
ments, the diminishing opportuni
ties for interdisciplinary study,
the almost complete victory of
social science over social philoso
phy. He, too, is eased out if his
interests lie in areas or ap
proaches that graduate programs
consider too unwieldy or inter
disciplinary lo handle. A part of
the discontent we arc witnessing
is a student insistence on a return
to "elite" forms of education that
flourished in a day when social
demands on the college were more
general and less vigorous, and in
which establishments of higher
learning were formulaiors rather
than instruments of national pur
pose.
I know that I have come a long
way from traditional interpreta
tions of academic freedom, but
these considerations seem to mo a
justified extension of the prin
ciples that inhere in the concept.
Now that a Stanford dean, in a
recent statement, has implied that
academic freedom extends to ad
ministrators as well as those on
either end of the teaching log, I
admit that the issue threatens to
become very complex. We ought
to keep it within the context of
the collegia! system, and I would
pursue this if The Daily did not
object to long-windedness.

â€¢ A New Low
Editor, The Daily:
Now that our "sex scandal" has
simmered down a little, perhaps 1
can say a few calm words about
it. If ever a newspaper was a rag,
it must then have been like The
Daily on 4 Feb. I congratulate you
on your performance: you have
hit a new low. That said, I'll turn
to more constructive comment.
You did do something good
when you got this whole busi
ness about academic freedom out
into the open. It's about time
someone brought it out from un
der the rug. But the way you did
it only led to further confusion
of the whole issue. What you did
was confuse academic freedom
with the Stanford student's sex
life. Frankly, I can't set anything
but the remotest connection be
tween the two.
May 1 clarify? The issue at
stake involves not sex, but free
dom of thought: not morals, but
discipline. Freedom of thought
and student discipline are impor
tant university issues; but my sex
life and morals are my own busi
ness. Stanford people have a

unique capacity for analyzing
everything and understanding
nothing; therefore I'll point out
what I believe our errors of
thought are.
First, to my fellow students: we
have too little respect for discip
line. Anything we don't like we
jump to point out as evil, and so
we have unnecessarily castigated
the administration in 4 Feb.'s
Daily. Now the adminstration:
I'm afraid they deserve much
of the abuse they get. They have
begun by imposing on us a Funda
mental Standard, without explain
ing to us whether it applies to
morals or discipline. In their na
tural desire to control the stu
dents as much as possible, t hey
apply it to our morals. Of course,
many of the students don't believe
in morality as the administration
sees it. And, as I mentioned be
fore, our morals are not the ad
ministration's business; their job
is to impose necessary discipline.
To finish, I'll ask everyone this:
why do we get so worked up over
sex? It's as good and natural a
function of life as eating, drink
ing, sleeping, or eliminating. They
all require regulation to deliver
their maximum benefit, but it is
the individual who must do the
regulating. All the English teach
ers have done is talk about a per
vasive fact of life; I certainly hope
they continue doing so.
