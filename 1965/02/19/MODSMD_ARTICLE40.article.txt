## SFM Office Needs Reform, Shaw Says 
### Justin Beck 
There is a tradtion at Stanford known as the Student Financial
Manager s Report, a tradition of reporting on matters a hit beyond
even the student financial manager's w ide sphere of responsibility.
Ed Shaw, last year's SFM, was no exception, ranging further
afield than a big-league shortstop, and compiling, in the process, a

remarkable fielding record, al-'
though perhaps lacking ihe grace
of an Apparieio or McMillian.
Moreover Shaw's journey through
Stanford-land is ihe anabasis of
student reports, longer, more ac
tion-packed, and certainly more
mandering that those of his pre
decessors. Those who follow had
best concentrate on polishing up
their prose, rather than trying to
match Shaw word for word, a
task comparable to pitching pen
nies with the Federal Reserve
System.
New Proposals
But buried within Shaw's ac
count of last year are a couple of
proposals of definite merit, both
o d d 1 y enough considering Ihe
range of Shaw's interests con
cerning ihe SFM and the funds he
adminis l
The fir ; < "v-! the position of
SFM be ; ,i.sh< .i. The second,
far more modest, is that petty
a s h iuiui l - be established for
groups banking with the Stu
dents' Organization Fund.
Shaw is a good businessman
with a long range view of things,
a pair of assets no) often found
in student government ledgers.
Facing experience as SFM last
year convinced him that the job
of handling student government
finances is rapidly outgrowing the
capacity of part-time students.
(Shaw took about as many units
last year as the football team won
games).
Duties Of SFM
In his report he outlined the
SFM's duties:
"He is the controller of the
Students' Organizations Fund
with over two hundred accounts
and at least half that many
treasurers reporting to him. His
responsibility to the Legislature
for these groups who receive
general fund support is one of
eontrollership and bussiness man
agership. He also has the responsi
bility for the following functions:
1) the Student Police, 2) the Sun
day Night Movies (Flicks). 3) the
operations of the Boathouse and
the supervision of the Lifeguards,
4) the operations of the ASSU
Office, and 5> he must report to
the Legislature on the soundness,
both financial and operational, of
proposed plans for any project
offered to that body. Added to all
these functions he is supposed to

prepare plans for future opera-i
| tions of the ASSU.
Shaw predicts that unless the
position of the SFM is radically
;a 11 e red . ;i "permanent profes
! sional" might eventually be hired I
:to fill the current positions of
, SFM and Financial Director.
As an alternate solution which
would maintain student leader
ship despite the increasing bur-:
den of the position, Shaw would
| divide the position into two stu
' dent-held posts.
One student would serve as the
; controller of the ASSU. insuring
that proper accounting and finan
cial operations are followed, as
well as operating the SOF. The!
other would serve as a business
! manager, directing the business
; aspects of student affairs.
Shaw's other proposal is that
limited petty cash funds be per
mitted for student organizations. :
At the present time no expendi
tures can be made by groups
j banking with the SOF unless a,
purchase order is made in ad-!
vanee. One group under this sys- j
tern incurred a debt of several
dollars to the Tresidder Union!
which it has not been able to pay, .
because the SFM would not allow 1
a purchase order filled out after !
the fact.
No Brazilian Trip
Shaw suggests that a treasurer i
be allowed up to $15 to use for
> petty cash expenditures of up to |
| $5. In order to replenish the fund j
the student would have to show
| cash receipts for every expendi-1
ture and have the organization |
president sign the payment vou
! cher.
Under this plan the most a
treasurer could abscond with is j
$15. not quite enough to buy a
plane ticket to Brazil, and pro- j
bably not enough to make theft
i worth while. And the ASSU of
fices would save both time and
money by stopping the flood of
minor purchase orders.
No action has been taken on j
this second of Shaw's proposals, ;
indicating that some opposition
to the plan exists. But if there is i
oppos i t i on it does not come
from the groups banking with Ihe
SOF. Too many treasurers have
spent too much time filling out
ASSU purchase orders to admire
the safety and efficency of Ihe
I present system.

As an alternate solution which
would maintain student leader
ship despite the increasing bur-:

One student would serve as the

that proper accounting and finan

other would serve as a business

Shaw's other proposal is that
limited petty cash funds be per
mitted for student organizations. :
At the present time no expendi
tures can be made by groups
j banking with the SOF unless a,
purchase order is made in ad-!
vanee. One group under this sys- j

dollars to the Tresidder Union!

Shaw suggests that a treasurer i
be allowed up to $15 to use for

| $5. In order to replenish the fund j
the student would have to show

ture and have the organization |
president sign the payment vou
! cher.
Under this plan the most a
treasurer could abscond with is j
$15. not quite enough to buy a
plane ticket to Brazil, and pro- j
bably not enough to make theft
i worth while. And the ASSU of
fices would save both time and
money by stopping the flood of
minor purchase orders.
No action has been taken on j
this second of Shaw's proposals, ;
indicating that some opposition
to the plan exists. But if there is i
oppos i t i on it does not come
from the groups banking with Ihe
SOF. Too many treasurers have
spent too much time filling out
ASSU purchase orders to admire
the safety and efficency of Ihe
I present system.
There is a tradtion at Stanford known as the Student Financial
Manager s Report, a tradition of reporting on matters a hit beyond
even the student financial manager's w ide sphere of responsibility.
Ed Shaw, last year's SFM, was no exception, ranging further
afield than a big-league shortstop, and compiling, in the process, a

remarkable fielding record, al-'
though perhaps lacking ihe grace
of an Apparieio or McMillian.
Moreover Shaw's journey through
Stanford-land is ihe anabasis of
student reports, longer, more ac
tion-packed, and certainly more
mandering that those of his pre
decessors. Those who follow had
best concentrate on polishing up
their prose, rather than trying to
match Shaw word for word, a
task comparable to pitching pen
nies with the Federal Reserve
System.

Shaw is a good businessman
with a long range view of things,
a pair of assets no) often found
in student government ledgers.
Facing experience as SFM last
year convinced him that the job
of handling student government
finances is rapidly outgrowing the
capacity of part-time students.
(Shaw took about as many units
last year as the football team won
games).
Duties Of SFM
In his report he outlined the
SFM's duties:
"He is the controller of the
Students' Organizations Fund
with over two hundred accounts
and at least half that many
treasurers reporting to him. His
responsibility to the Legislature
for these groups who receive
general fund support is one of
eontrollership and bussiness man
agership. He also has the responsi
bility for the following functions:
1) the Student Police, 2) the Sun
day Night Movies (Flicks). 3) the
operations of the Boathouse and
the supervision of the Lifeguards,
4) the operations of the ASSU
Office, and 5> he must report to
the Legislature on the soundness,
both financial and operational, of
proposed plans for any project
offered to that body. Added to all
these functions he is supposed to

prepare plans for future opera-i

their prose, rather than trying to

New Proposals
But buried within Shaw's ac
count of last year are a couple of
proposals of definite merit, both
o d d 1 y enough considering Ihe
range of Shaw's interests con
cerning ihe SFM and the funds he
adminis l
The fir ; < "v-! the position of
SFM be ; ,i.sh< .i. The second,
far more modest, is that petty
a s h iuiui l - be established for
groups banking with the Stu
dents' Organization Fund.
Shaw is a good businessman
with a long range view of things,
a pair of assets no) often found
in student government ledgers.
Facing experience as SFM last
year convinced him that the job
of handling student government
finances is rapidly outgrowing the
capacity of part-time students.
(Shaw took about as many units
last year as the football team won
games).
Duties Of SFM
In his report he outlined the
SFM's duties:
"He is the controller of the
Students' Organizations Fund
with over two hundred accounts
and at least half that many
treasurers reporting to him. His
responsibility to the Legislature
for these groups who receive
general fund support is one of
eontrollership and bussiness man
agership. He also has the responsi
bility for the following functions:
1) the Student Police, 2) the Sun
day Night Movies (Flicks). 3) the
operations of the Boathouse and
the supervision of the Lifeguards,
4) the operations of the ASSU
Office, and 5> he must report to
the Legislature on the soundness,
both financial and operational, of
proposed plans for any project
offered to that body. Added to all
these functions he is supposed to

prepare plans for future opera-i
| tions of the ASSU.
Shaw predicts that unless the
position of the SFM is radically
;a 11 e red . ;i "permanent profes
! sional" might eventually be hired I
:to fill the current positions of
, SFM and Financial Director.
As an alternate solution which
would maintain student leader
ship despite the increasing bur-:
den of the position, Shaw would
| divide the position into two stu
' dent-held posts.
One student would serve as the
; controller of the ASSU. insuring
that proper accounting and finan
cial operations are followed, as
well as operating the SOF. The!
other would serve as a business
! manager, directing the business
; aspects of student affairs.
Shaw's other proposal is that
limited petty cash funds be per
mitted for student organizations. :
At the present time no expendi
tures can be made by groups
j banking with the SOF unless a,
purchase order is made in ad-!
vanee. One group under this sys- j
tern incurred a debt of several
dollars to the Tresidder Union!
which it has not been able to pay, .
because the SFM would not allow 1
a purchase order filled out after !
the fact.
No Brazilian Trip
Shaw suggests that a treasurer i
be allowed up to $15 to use for
> petty cash expenditures of up to |
| $5. In order to replenish the fund j
the student would have to show
| cash receipts for every expendi-1
ture and have the organization |
president sign the payment vou
! cher.
Under this plan the most a
treasurer could abscond with is j
$15. not quite enough to buy a
plane ticket to Brazil, and pro- j
bably not enough to make theft
i worth while. And the ASSU of
fices would save both time and
money by stopping the flood of
minor purchase orders.
No action has been taken on j
this second of Shaw's proposals, ;
indicating that some opposition
to the plan exists. But if there is i
oppos i t i on it does not come
from the groups banking with Ihe
SOF. Too many treasurers have
spent too much time filling out
ASSU purchase orders to admire
the safety and efficency of Ihe
I present system.
There is a tradtion at Stanford known as the Student Financial
Manager s Report, a tradition of reporting on matters a hit beyond
even the student financial manager's w ide sphere of responsibility.
Ed Shaw, last year's SFM, was no exception, ranging further
afield than a big-league shortstop, and compiling, in the process, a

remarkable fielding record, al-'
though perhaps lacking ihe grace
of an Apparieio or McMillian.
Moreover Shaw's journey through
Stanford-land is ihe anabasis of
student reports, longer, more ac
tion-packed, and certainly more
mandering that those of his pre
decessors. Those who follow had
best concentrate on polishing up
their prose, rather than trying to
match Shaw word for word, a
task comparable to pitching pen
nies with the Federal Reserve
System.
