# On The Right
## Newsmen Dissatisfied By LBJ's 'Big Brotherliness' 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Conceivably the air strikes,
against North Vietnam will dissi
pate the low pressure area that
has recently settled over the head
of Lyndon Johnson. Of course if it :
had been President Goldwater i
who ordered the air strikes, most :
American opinion-makers would:
be howling with rage. That it J
should have come from a Demo- i
cratic President, at whose right i
hand sits a former chairman of I
the Americans for Democratic
Action, make criticism more? diffi
cult. Indeed it is true, I fear, that
in our age, and for a long time
to come, we shall have to rely l
on the left for important acts of ;
statesmanship which, if they were i
executed by the right, would sun
der the nation.
President Johnson, then, can
probably count on the support of
the great majority of the oxer
lords of American opinion for his
deed, and at the moment he very
much needs their kindly atten
tion having intensely annoyed
them during recent weeks. The
President's relations with the
press are truly deteriorating, Mr.
Roscoe Drummond having gone
so far as to say direfully that
"what is happening is that Mr.
Johnson is in the process of de
stroying tin 1 presidential press
conference as Washington cor
respondents have known it for 32
years."
Big Brotherliness
Other reporters have charged
that there is a Big Brotherliness
in his handling of them that is
disconcerting, not to say creepy.
Specifically it is charged that I he
President tunes in on briefings
given to the press by his assistant
Mr. George Reedy, who if he an
swers a question not-quite-the
right-way, gets interrupted there
and then by a Presidential blast
over th e telephone, instructing
him how to correct his approach.
American newspapermen don't
like to bo bugged. It may be all
right for newspapermen to bug
the lives of public officials, but it
is most definitely not okay for a
President to bug his own assist-

ant in his dealings with news
papermen. Needless to say, Mr.
Reedy has denied the charge.
And then the whole matter of
the Churchill funeral, which
somehow refuses to die down. The
President is of course most di
rectly responsible for escalating
his ineptitude into a first-class
diplomatic fiasco, by his inexpli
cable comment that after all, he
had not "observed" that "other na
tions" had "in most instances sent
either their top man or the next
man" to London. Apart from the
refractory statistics (there were
four kings, two queens, four
presidents and sixteen prime min
isters in London), America is
not, where Churchill is concerned,
supposed to be like any other na
tion. Churchill's precise diploma
tic contributions to America may
be a matter for adjudication by
another generation of scholars,
but there is no denying the bio
logical fact that half the blood
that ran through his veins was
American, or that he greatly en
riched the language we all speak.
LBJ'S PUBLIC IMAGE
Most probably it is just one of
those little valleys that very pow
erful men have to traverse in the
course of scaling the heights of
! popularity. Three years ago there
was a lot of dissatisfaction against
Mr. Kennedy for his news man
agement and a certain apprehen
sion over that sycophancy which
was even then beginning to sur
round him: but he easily over
; came it as, no doubt, Mr. John
son will as our eyes refocus from
the press conferences and Mr.
| Churchill'.** funeral, over to Viet
j nam, where we face a most seri
lous crisis which Mr. Johnson now
»seems to be preparing to con
-1 front more realistically. Perhaps
' a new era has begun, when we
will worry less about the niceties
lof South Vietnamese parliamen
! tary life, than about the prospec
tive loss of the Southeast Asian
I subcontinent to the savage power

statesmanship which, if they were i

President Johnson, then, can

the great majority of the oxer

much needs their kindly atten

Reedy has denied the charge.
And then the whole matter of

somehow refuses to die down. The
President is of course most di

his ineptitude into a first-class
diplomatic fiasco, by his inexpli
