# I-Center Sponsors Zete Return With Fireside, Dance
## 
### 
The Zetes are long departed and
; it is with a sigh of nostalgia that
â€¢ all (except the Stanford Fire De
partment, the Akels, and the
II ech t e 1 Foundation > recollect
; their fun-loving escapades which
! used to give the campus a flavor
} of excitement and adventure.
Now they are gone and with
them some of the finest collec
tions in American universities of
a nt i qu e firearms (musketry),
caveman wall drawings, mis
placed furniture, and artistic
I photographs, not to mention an
j outstanding tradition of unusual
i social events.
Lest this tradition be totally
j erased, a dance and fireside to
: morrow evening from 8 to 12 will
j celebrate "the return of the Zetes"
at their home of so many years,
the International Center.
The event is jointly sponsored
j by the I-Center, the I-Club, and
the Associated Alumni of Over
seas Campuses. According to
Brian Stowell. President of AAOC,
"there is some concern that the
I-Center is losing its vigorous
American character, for with the
exit of the Zetes almost no Ameri
can students go near the I-Center.
It is becoming far more isolated
from the mainstream of Amen
jean student life than in the hey
day of the Zetes."
