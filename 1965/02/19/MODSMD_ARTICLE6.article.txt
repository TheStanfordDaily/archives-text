# LASSU Demands Direct Report From Social Regs
## 
### The Editorial Staff 
Tin- Legislature last night clarified its position as the formula
tor of student policy by prohibiting the AW S Social Regulations
Committee from reporting its findings to "any faculty or adminis
trative' board before the Legislature has approved those findings.
This action was taken to ensure that the problem of social regu-

lations would not be taken out
student hands before the Legis
lature could approve or disap
prove the AWS recommendations.
THE RESOLUTION was initi
ally proposed as an amendment to
a bill formulating a committee to
consider the findings of the AWS
concerning social regulations and
report to the Legislature within
two weeks.
This bill was defeated 41-34.
The amendment was then re
introduced as a separate resolu
tion and passed by a wide margin.
Earlier the Legislature referred
the controversial judicial reform
bill to the Rules Committee after
90 minutes of debate.
THE BILL WOULD assert that
"Ihe community of Stanford stu
dents regards itself as a self
governing democratic society"
and that the Legislature "has
jurisdiction within the student
community over student conduct."
It then establishes the "criteria
for detering violation" and con
cludes that only the following ac
tions shall be deemed punishable:
• Violations of the Fundamen
tal Standards.
• Violations of the Honor Code.
• Violations of the Constitu
tion and By-Laws of the Associ
ated Students.
UNDER THIS By-Laws change,
the Fundamental Standard will
be construed as applicable only to
offenses which are:
• Acts the commission of which
would constitute violation of Fed
eral or California state statutes

where no prosecution has been
undertaken by civil authorities.
• Violation of written Univer
sity policies which have been spe
cifically accepted as violations of
the Fundamental Standard by the
Legislature or the Board of Trus
tees.
The By-Laws committee had
considered tlie bill and had recom
mended that the Legislature pass
it. However, the chairman of the
By-Laws committee, Carl Hillen
brand, entered a minority report
opposing the proposed change in
that it would "divide the student
judiciary from the Faculty and
Administration."
Since other members also ob
jected to the wording in some of
the clauses, Speaker Ed Shaw
appointed both Gary Feldman,
sponsor of the bill, and Rob Sang
ster, one of its principal critics, as
ex-officio members of the four
man Rules Committee.
SHAW SAID open hearings
would be held next week.
LASSU also passed a resolution
appropriating $1,000 from its
contingency fund to the Publica
tions Board for the publication of
organizational newsletters.
Originally the bill stipulated
that the funds be used only for
graduate publications and only
by those organizations which arc
not "self-perpetuating." However,
these two stipulations were
stricken.
INCLUDED WAS a stipulation
that all organizations must pro
vide ample space in their publica
tions for the expression of views
contrary to their own.

contrary to their own.
Tin- Legislature last night clarified its position as the formula
tor of student policy by prohibiting the AW S Social Regulations
Committee from reporting its findings to "any faculty or adminis
trative' board before the Legislature has approved those findings.
This action was taken to ensure that the problem of social regu-

lations would not be taken out
student hands before the Legis
lature could approve or disap
prove the AWS recommendations.
THE RESOLUTION was initi
ally proposed as an amendment to
a bill formulating a committee to
consider the findings of the AWS
concerning social regulations and
report to the Legislature within
two weeks.
This bill was defeated 41-34.
The amendment was then re
introduced as a separate resolu
tion and passed by a wide margin.
Earlier the Legislature referred
the controversial judicial reform
bill to the Rules Committee after
90 minutes of debate.
THE BILL WOULD assert that
"Ihe community of Stanford stu
dents regards itself as a self
governing democratic society"
and that the Legislature "has
jurisdiction within the student
community over student conduct."
It then establishes the "criteria
for detering violation" and con
cludes that only the following ac
tions shall be deemed punishable:
• Violations of the Fundamen
tal Standards.
• Violations of the Honor Code.
• Violations of the Constitu
tion and By-Laws of the Associ
ated Students.
UNDER THIS By-Laws change,
the Fundamental Standard will
be construed as applicable only to
offenses which are:
• Acts the commission of which
would constitute violation of Fed
eral or California state statutes

where no prosecution has been
undertaken by civil authorities.
• Violation of written Univer
sity policies which have been spe
cifically accepted as violations of
the Fundamental Standard by the
Legislature or the Board of Trus
tees.
The By-Laws committee had
considered tlie bill and had recom
mended that the Legislature pass
it. However, the chairman of the
By-Laws committee, Carl Hillen
brand, entered a minority report
opposing the proposed change in
that it would "divide the student
judiciary from the Faculty and
Administration."
Since other members also ob
jected to the wording in some of
the clauses, Speaker Ed Shaw
appointed both Gary Feldman,
sponsor of the bill, and Rob Sang
ster, one of its principal critics, as
ex-officio members of the four
man Rules Committee.
SHAW SAID open hearings
would be held next week.
LASSU also passed a resolution
appropriating $1,000 from its
contingency fund to the Publica
tions Board for the publication of
organizational newsletters.
Originally the bill stipulated
that the funds be used only for
graduate publications and only
by those organizations which arc
not "self-perpetuating." However,
these two stipulations were
stricken.
INCLUDED WAS a stipulation
that all organizations must pro
vide ample space in their publica
tions for the expression of views
contrary to their own.
