# Second LASSU Veep Proposed
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
A plan introduced to the Legislature last night bv Chuck Lud
lani, chairman ol the Executive-Legislative Reorganization Com
mittee, would substantially revise the present ASSU executive
branch by creating two offices of vice-president.
The proposal, if adopted by LASSU, would free the student

body president from many of hisH
administrative duties, giving him
more time to pursue his policy-j
making and leadership responsi-!
bilities, Ludlam told The Daily
last night.
UNDLK THK I'LAN, the first
vice-president would be the direct !
successor to tlie presidency and
would manage much of the ad-j
ministration of the association.!
This administrative work is now
handled largely by an administra
tive assistant, who is appointed
by the president.
The second vice-president would
take over the duties of the pre
sent vice-president, which now,
consist of being responsible for |
the calendar of events for student ,
organizations and living groups.
In addition, the second vice-!
president would coordinate boards j
and commissions that fall under |
AS.SU jurisdiction. This would in-;
elude attendance at meetings as:
an ex officio member of all these
groups a duty that now belongs
to the president, but currently
goes unperformed due to do
mands on his available time.
i,UI)LAM SAID that the job
was designed with the idea in
mind that it would tie filled by ;i

woman student, although no
stipulation to that effect is spe
cifically mentioned in his pro
posal.
He also mentioned that the new
plan should improve the quality
of the number two executive in
the case of presidential succes
sion.
The two vice-presidents. Lud
lam stated, would bo directly re
sponsible to the president. He
added that since the three execu
tive officers would have to work
in close cooperation, they would
probably be elected on a single
ticket.
LUDLAM mentioned that such
a development could lead to the
organization of political parties
on the Stanford campus. Result
ing coalition tickets, such as a
fraternity-eating club combina
tion, "would make politics a lot
more interesting," he said.
He doubted that a bloc ticket
<i fraternity troika, for example
could meet with much success.
Ludlam is hopeful that the
double vice-presidency proposal
can be made into law before the
ASSU general election Spring
Quarter.

take over the duties of the pre
sent vice-president, which now,
consist of being responsible for |
the calendar of events for student ,
organizations and living groups.
In addition, the second vice-!
president would coordinate boards j
and commissions that fall under |
AS.SU jurisdiction. This would in-;
elude attendance at meetings as:
an ex officio member of all these
groups a duty that now belongs
to the president, but currently
goes unperformed due to do
mands on his available time.
i,UI)LAM SAID that the job
was designed with the idea in
mind that it would tie filled by ;i

woman student, although no
stipulation to that effect is spe
cifically mentioned in his pro
posal.
He also mentioned that the new
plan should improve the quality
of the number two executive in
the case of presidential succes
sion.
The two vice-presidents. Lud
lam stated, would bo directly re
sponsible to the president. He
added that since the three execu
tive officers would have to work
in close cooperation, they would
probably be elected on a single
ticket.
LUDLAM mentioned that such
a development could lead to the
organization of political parties
on the Stanford campus. Result
ing coalition tickets, such as a
fraternity-eating club combina
tion, "would make politics a lot
more interesting," he said.
He doubted that a bloc ticket
<i fraternity troika, for example
could meet with much success.
Ludlam is hopeful that the
double vice-presidency proposal
can be made into law before the
ASSU general election Spring
Quarter.
A plan introduced to the Legislature last night bv Chuck Lud
lani, chairman ol the Executive-Legislative Reorganization Com
mittee, would substantially revise the present ASSU executive
branch by creating two offices of vice-president.
The proposal, if adopted by LASSU, would free the student

body president from many of hisH
administrative duties, giving him
more time to pursue his policy-j
making and leadership responsi-!
bilities, Ludlam told The Daily
last night.
UNDLK THK I'LAN, the first
vice-president would be the direct !
successor to tlie presidency and
would manage much of the ad-j
ministration of the association.!
This administrative work is now
handled largely by an administra
tive assistant, who is appointed
by the president.
