### 
Seven hundred years before the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, the Jewish
prophet Isaiah wrote these words concerning the Messiah W ho was to
come:
"Who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord
revealed? For He (Messiah) shall grow up before Him (God) sa a
tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground : He has no form or comeli
ness ; and when we shall see 1 lim, there is no beauty that we should desire
Him.
"He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquain
ted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from Him; He was des
pised and we esteemed Him not. Surely He has born our griefs and
carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem Him stricken, smitten of God
and afflicted. Hut He was wounded for our transgressions. lie was
bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace upon Him; and
with I li> stripes we are healed.
"All we like sheep have gone astray: we have turned every one to
his own way, and the Lord has laid on Him (the Messiah) the iniquity
of us all. He was oppressed and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His
mouth: He is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before
his shearers is dumb, so He openeth not. His mouth, lie was taken from
prison and from judgement: and who shall declare I lis generation? For
He was cut off out of the land of the living: and for the transgressions
of my people lb' was stricken. And He made Mis grave with the wicked,
and with the rich in His death; because He had done no violence, neither
was any deceit in His mouth. Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He
has put Him to grief: when thou shall make His soul an offering for sin,
He shall see I lis seed, 1 le shall prolong 1 lis days, and the pleasure of the
Lord shall prosper in His hand. He shall see the travail of His soul, and
shall be satisfied: by Mis knowledge shall my righteous servant justify
many; for He shall bear their iniquities. Therefore will 1 divide Him a
portion with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong;
because He has poured out His soul unto death: and He was numbered
with the transgressors: and He bore the sin of many, and made inter
cession for the transgressors: and He bore the sin of many, and made
intercession of the transgressors'' (Isaiah 53, KJY)
The remarkable prophecies of this passage were fulfilled in minute
detail by one.man. Jesus Christ, whose life is an open book for you to ex
amine for yourself. Consider this Old Testament foreview of Christ and
then check the New Testament record: John 12:38, Matthew 27:30, 31,
8:17, 26:63: 27:12-14: 27:11-10 27:57-60; 27:38; Mark 15:3-5; Luke
22:37; 23:34: Acts 8:32-33; 13:38, 39; Romans 3:25, 5:15-18; 1 Peter
2:22-24.
Decide for yourself, who is the Messiah? Arc His claims reasonable?
Is the record accurate and clear? Is not Jesus Christ the only one Person
in all of history in a unique position to meet man's deepest needs and carry
His daily burdens? Trust Him today and find out in experience.
