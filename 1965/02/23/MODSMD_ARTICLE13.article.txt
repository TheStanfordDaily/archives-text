# Drop to Third in Conference
## Card Cagers Split Two Tilts 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The pressure will be on the
| Stanford Indians next weekend
[when I hey host USC and UCLA
thanks to the split the basketball
team garnered in the recent pair
of contests at Washington.
The cagers rallied from a half <
lime deficit of ivvo points to beat |
the University of Washington, 65-;
156. The next day in a television
i tilt Stanford almost pulled i he
, game out of the fire on a lay-in j
| by Ray Kosanke with 28 secondsi
to go, but nine seconds later!
IWashington State guard Tom:
Tornmervik found himself alone I
in the corner.
He pumped a jumper through
the net lo give his team a 59-58 j
lead. The Indians brought the ball
downcourt quickly. The usual
outside passes ensued and the In
dians set lied for a last second 18-
foot jumper which failed.
MEANWHILE BAC K in th e
Southland, USC defeated Oregon
and Oregon Slate to move a full
game ahead of the Tribe in the

race for second place.
Washington spotted Stanford
an early 12-9 lead and then
jumped ahead 16-14. The Huskies
held on and wenl to the halftime
locker room leading. 29-27.
After the intermission many
j teams "come out shooting"; un
fortunately for Washington they
(emerged from their short respite
as the antithesis of this phrase.
In the first 18 minutes of the sec
ond half, the Huskies hit only
| three field goals.
IN THE HALF of their obvious
misery, Washington hit six of
j thirty-one shots to help them
along the road to a .258 field goal
I percentage for the entire game.
Stanford hit .421.
Bob Bedell kept up his average
by canning 20 points. The only
other men in double figures were
Kent Hinckley, 15 points, and
Clayton Haaka, 10. Through a con
certed team effort, the Indians
grabbed 55 rebounds. The Huskies
had 40 of which 22 were in the
first half.
The following day Washington
State made a one-point halftime
lead stand an endurance test as
;the Indian vainly tried to stave
I off third place in the conference
standings. The Cougars lead, 32-
31, at the half.
FIVE BALL control errors by
Stanford in the early going plus
| the superior board play of WSU's
| muscular center Te d Werner,
coupled with the offensive work
of 6'7" sophomore Randy Stoll
effected the demise of the Indians.
Stoll, just recently declared
scholasticly eligible, was playing
a high post with Clayton Raaka
guarding him.
Repeatedly, the Cougars would
clear the lane and Stoll would roll
around Raaka, grab the high pass
for easy buckets and sometimes
fouls. This was deleterious to
Stanford not only on the score

.board but also foul-wise as Raaka
was charged with his third per
sonal early In the fray.
TIIESIC FACTORS propelled (he
| Cougar to a 25-14 lead two-thirds
of the way through (ho first half.
A steal by Gary Loveridge and
two free-throws by Bob Bedell,
however, closed the gap lo 32-31
as (ho half ended.
The tide fluctuated during the
entire second half with neither
team having more than a two
; point until 44 per cenl free-throw
er Ted Werner hit two charity
tosses with a minute to go. This
I gave his team a 57-54 advantage.
I Hay Kosanke hit a jumper lo
I pull the Indians within one point,
j Then lie drove around Werner
for the go ahead points, but Tom
mervik came up with his most
| propitious .jumper of ihe season
to win (he game for Washington
Slate, 59-58.
