Stanford University lias always shown a pe
culiar unwillingness to countenance personnel
or policies which are public liabilities.
The recent disposal of the Dean of W omen
is just one rather ironic example of this attitude
in action. There are others.
This is not to say, of course, that the Univer
sity is so crass as to blatantly kowtow to the ex
plicit demands of external pressure groups. The
administration has been scrupulously careful in
this regard, particularly in its acceptance of fi
naneial gilts.
However, in a broader sense, the University
is indeed controlled by external society; for it
has somehow come to regard itself as a "pro
ducer, obligated to turn out the kind and quan
tity of intellectual manpower which the nation
at large thinks it needs.
In 1916, El I wood P. Cubberlev of Stanford
elaborated upon this view of education in a pas
sage from his book. Public School Administration:
"Our schools are, in a sense, factories in which
the raw products (children) are to be shaped
and fashioned into products to meet the vari
ous demands of life. The specifications for
manufacturing come from the demands of
the twentieth-century civilization, and it is the
business of the school to build its pupils to
the specifications laid down.
This producer-consumer attitude to educa

tion, in which students are "built. . .to the speci
fications laid down," has more currency than one
would like to believe.
The University system, feeling itself increas
ingly dependent upon aid from government and
large corporations, has become most reluctant
to act as a catalyst for radical social criticism
and has, in fact, gone to great limits to rationalize
its current role as servant to the status quo.
One can hardly doubt that it is the Univer
sity's duty to "produce the leaders of tomor
row's society.
But what kind of leaders? And leaders to
what purpose?
Does the University work to develop students
as human beings, sensitizing them to moral and
social issues? Or does it rather operate on a "ser
vice station" approach, filling up students with
high octane "knowledge" and sending them on
their separate ways?
The final question is this: does the current
concept of education as "training" for future
societal role-playing really serve the nation's
needs?
It would seem that it does not.
It would seem rather, that the university, in
acting as a reflector, and not as a fornuilator, of
cultural values has abrogated its basic respon
sibility: its responsibility to lead and to criticize
and to be better than the rest of society, so so
ciety in turn may become better itself .
