## Alum Praises Student Maturity 
### 
Dear Dr. Sterling-:
As a 1962 graduate and inter
ested observer of Stanford Uni
versity, let me congratulate you
for the intelligent and responsible
handling of the incident involv
ing the former dean of women,
Miss Lucile Allen.
An educational institution that
can attract the brightest, most
promising young adults in th e
country cannot afford to be un
aware of the changed character of
these students. The character and
values of a group are judged by
those of its articulate and effec
tive leaders. A substantial num
ber of student leaders today ap
pear to be more perceptive of
society's inconsistencies, more ac
tively pursuing their solutions,
more serious older, somehow.
Older than I was as a student
three years ago, more mature,
even, than the freshmen I spon
sored in 1962.
They have demonstrated their
commitment to responsible de
mocracy by acting within its
framework — as civil rights
workers, as Peace Corps rep re

sentatives, and in political and
civic organizations. As citizens
they have learned to use the tools
of free inquiry, to "put their bod
ies on the line" for a belief in
equal rights, and to recognize
both integrity and sophistry be
yond the pages of a history book.
There still will be parity raids,
beer busts, and foolish behavior,
but they will become fewer in
each generation of students. A n d
fewer students each year will re
spond to or expect to encouter a
dean whose role is "judgmental"
and puntive and whose qualifica
tion is military training.
I recognize the fundamental
contradiction that faces a dean
that tries to keep student confi
dence and interest at heart, yet
whose defined responsibilities as
dean preclude her from acting as
a disinterested party. Most stu
dents come to recognize this, too.
I recall that friends on the faculty
and residence faculty associates
listened to more than their share
of student woes. Their advice
could be trusted because they
had no axe to grind. Perhaps

the suggested plan to transfer
disciplinary functions to a faculty
committee will make the dean's
office more effective in dealing
with students.
Probably there always will be
some day-to-day friction in melt
ing student and administration
goals. I can point to no panacea
in administrative structure; my
only model is human Dean Al
lard K. Lowenstein.
In his brief time at Stanford,
he generated excitement about,
learning, he demonstrated the
worth and effectiveness of indi
vidual action, and he imparted to
students his belief that students
have a stake in and should con
tribute to the life of the Univer
sity. During his stay, students he
had inspired worked hard for the
University — taking polls, re
searching reports, making pre
sentations to living groups on
student issues such as coed din
ing, membership in the National
Student Association, and revision
of the ASSU constitution.
I have not seen the report con
cerning the former dean of wom
en. But I would hope that the
University administration recog
nizes that* Hie commitment it rep
resents would not be made unless
Ihe students involved cared about
their University and the Stanford
students yet to come.

I recall that friends on the faculty

of student woes. Their advice
could be trusted because they
had no axe to grind. Perhaps

the suggested plan to transfer
disciplinary functions to a faculty
committee will make the dean's
office more effective in dealing
with students.
Probably there always will be
some day-to-day friction in melt

only model is human Dean Al

In his brief time at Stanford,
he generated excitement about,
learning, he demonstrated the
worth and effectiveness of indi

students his belief that students
have a stake in and should con
tribute to the life of the Univer
sity. During his stay, students he
had inspired worked hard for the
University — taking polls, re
searching reports, making pre
sentations to living groups on
student issues such as coed din
ing, membership in the National
Student Association, and revision
of the ASSU constitution.
I have not seen the report con

Dear Dr. Sterling-:
As a 1962 graduate and inter
ested observer of Stanford Uni
versity, let me congratulate you
for the intelligent and responsible
handling of the incident involv
ing the former dean of women,
Miss Lucile Allen.
An educational institution that
can attract the brightest, most
promising young adults in th e
country cannot afford to be un
aware of the changed character of
these students. The character and
values of a group are judged by
those of its articulate and effec
tive leaders. A substantial num
ber of student leaders today ap
pear to be more perceptive of
society's inconsistencies, more ac
tively pursuing their solutions,
more serious older, somehow.
Older than I was as a student
three years ago, more mature,
even, than the freshmen I spon
sored in 1962.
They have demonstrated their
commitment to responsible de
mocracy by acting within its
framework — as civil rights
workers, as Peace Corps rep re

sentatives, and in political and
civic organizations. As citizens
they have learned to use the tools
of free inquiry, to "put their bod
ies on the line" for a belief in
equal rights, and to recognize
both integrity and sophistry be
yond the pages of a history book.
There still will be parity raids,
beer busts, and foolish behavior,
but they will become fewer in
each generation of students. A n d
fewer students each year will re
spond to or expect to encouter a
dean whose role is "judgmental"
and puntive and whose qualifica
tion is military training.
I recognize the fundamental
contradiction that faces a dean
that tries to keep student confi
dence and interest at heart, yet
whose defined responsibilities as
dean preclude her from acting as
a disinterested party. Most stu
dents come to recognize this, too.
