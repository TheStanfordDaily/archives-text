# GLASS HOLDS
## Attempt On Axe Foiled 
### BOB EGELKO 
The Axe rests secure today in
its Tresidder Union case, behind
the glass cover which thwarted
ten would-be thieves early Mon
! day morning.
According to a report by Offi
cer Lester of the Stanford Police
Dept., this latest attempt on the
170-year-old trophy went smoothly
until the culprits tried to break
I the case.
AT A.M. Monday, a false
i alarm, which has yet to be traced,
was set in the main library.
Seventeen minutes later a boy
I about 18-year-old walked up to
I Tresidder janitor Joe Dutrc and
! asked to be let into ihe Union to
(retrieve a forgotten hook.
Dutre complied and opened the
. door.
Ten "student-type" y o u th s
rushed into Tresidder, and, armed
with a crowbar, went to work on
the wooden frame around the
Axe case.
THEY SUCCEEDED in ripping

the frame off the wall, but the
I glass proved unbreakable.
Head custodian Edward Jones
phoned the Stanford police, b u 1
before they arrived, the gang fled.
| Police have no leads, in the direc
tion of Berkeley or elsewhere, to
j the identity of the ton youths.
The incident was tlio first in
'what will undoubtedly bo a long
! line of attempts to wrest the Axe
I away from Farm territory be
; tween now and November. Since
; the inception of the Axe as a Big
| Game trophy in 1930, Stanford
has never held it for as long as
the current four-year period
making the Axe a tempting tar
! get for anyone who can uncover
i it
j Meanwhile, the wood frame,
loft behind by the gang as they
fled, has been replaced, and the
; Axe remains beneath glass and
burglar alarm in Tresidder.
And it's going to be hard to get
into the Union for the next few
! nights on the flimsy excuse that
you left a book.
