# MOOT COURT
## Law Student Tops Ouster Hearing 
### 
Third year law student,
Robert A. Nebrig, Jr., gar
nered first place and the $100
cash award that went with it
in the final round of the thir
teenth annual Marion Rice
Kirkwood Moot Court Com
pel i I ion held last Friday in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The court, sitting as the
United States Supreme Court,
consisted of The Honorable
Phil A. Gibson, former Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court
of California, as chief justice,
and The Honorable Stanley
A. YVciglc and The Honorable
Walter K. Craig, both district
judges in the Federal Court
System, as associate justices,
lis decision was based en
tirely upon the contestants'
skills in oral argument, and
abilities to answer questions
from the court, as well as

upon the written briefs sub
mitted to the court.
The ease at bar was that of
Peterson v. Board of Trustees
of Western University, a
hypothetical student discip
linary case. Peterson, the
petitioner, was expelled from
Western University for par
ticipating in a riot in a girl's
dormitory and for failure to
cooperate with the student
judicial council.
Peterson contended that he
had been denied the right to
"due process" granted by the
11th Amendment in that he
was not allowed to have his
attorney present in the heat
ing room and was not allowed
to cross-examine witnesses.
Summary judgment was
granted for the university at
the trial level, and this dcei
sion was affirmed by the Cali

fornia District Court of Ap
peals. The case was brought
to the United States Supreme
Court on a writ of certiorari.
Since the flue process re
quirements of the fourteenth
amendment apply only to ac
tions by the states, Peterson
based his argument on the
premise thai the university
was a "state actor." In order
to establish this premise,
counsel for Peterson pointed
to the numerous relationships
between the university and
the state and local govern
ments.
On a similar basis, counsel
for Peterson contended that
the university's mam connec
tions with the federal govern
ment made il a "federal ac
tor" under the requirements
for due process established
bv the fifth amendment.

On the other hand, the uni
versity argued that it would
be an unwarranted extention
of the amendment, to apply it
to a private educational insti
tution. Counsel for the uni
versity further contended
that such an extension would
be disruptive of its interest
in holding orderly and dis
creet disciplinary proceed
ings.
It was also argued by coun
sel for the university that
even it it were considered a
"state actor." the university
did not deny Peterson hi s
constitutional rights. He was
given a fail - hearing wi t h
adequate not ice of the
charges against him. Me was
also allowed confrontation of
adve r s e wit nesses and a
chance to refute the charges
against him.
