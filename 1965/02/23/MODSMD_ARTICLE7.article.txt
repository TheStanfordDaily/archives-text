## 
### DOUG OHMANS 
Fifty women of Union Resi
dence have signed a petition call
ing for a mass meeting of the
Associated Women Students. The
petition, delivered to AYVS Vice-
President Chick Sullivan yester-,
day in accordance with an ASSU
i By-Laws provision, calls for a |
meeting to discuss the forthcom
ing proposals of Carol Swanson's
Social Regulations Committee.
In response to the petition. Miss 1
Sullivan informally promised that
the AYVS would hold the re-;
quested mass meeting as soon as!
a time and place for it could be:
arranged.
JIiDY ItOHKEK, President of
Union Residence ,said, "We are
concerned and disturbed with the
committee's apparent inaction. I
We want the issues to be more
open to public discussion."
The petition asks for a mass i
| meeting to be called by the AWS j
! President before March 5 to:
• Present in detail the commit
tee's proposals.
• Explain the delay and give a
progress report if the proposals!
are not; ready.
• Discuss the role of the ques-1
tionnaires in the formulation of j
the proposals.
In response to the petition, Miss
' Swanson said, "We have always
1 been planning to hold such a
meeting as soon as the commit-'
j tee completes its work." S h e
! added, "Our meetings have been;
I open all quarter, and they will
continue to be open. We have al-;
j ways been willing to answer any!
j girl's questions."
THE COMMITTEE hopes to fin
ish the report in time to present
I it at Thursday's AWS meeting.,
i From there the proposals will go i
J to the legislature which in last:
I Thursday's meeting forbid the

AWS to report to any other fac
ulty or administration body.
With regard to the third point
of the petition, Miss Swanson
said, "We have tried not to be
bound by statistics. Rather, we
have tried to work from the gen
eral trends indicated in the ques
tionnaires. I think that we have
put enough work into the study
to tlo this."
"We can't guarantee sweeping
reforms," said Miss Swanson,
"but some liberalization of social
regulations seems inevitable in
light of student opinion."
TINA KOSA, a Union senior
and author of the petition, said
that if the forthcoming proposals
are not satisfactory, the women
of Union will probably submit
their own set of recommendations
for consideration.
Miss Sullivan commented, "I
am glad to see such interest being
shown by students in the pro
posal." She cautioned, however,
that the proposals are
based on a iarge number of fac
tors. "1 hope that discussion of
these proposals will be well
thought out," she said, "and that
alternative proposals will try to
take all the factors into account."
