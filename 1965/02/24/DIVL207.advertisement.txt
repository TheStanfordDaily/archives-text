"Satan's first attack upon the human race was his sly effort to destroy
Eve's confidence in the kindness of God. Unfortunately for her and for us,
he succeeded too well. From than day, men have had a false conception oi
God, and it is exactly this that has cut out from under them the ground of
righteousness and driven them to reckless and destructive living.
Nothing twists and deforms the soul more than a low or unworthy
conception of God. Certain sccts. such as the Pharisees, while they held
that God was stern and austere, yet managed to maintain a fairly high
level of external morality; hut their righteousness was only outward.
Inwardly they were "whited sepulchre's' as our Lord Himsilt told them.
Their wrong conception of God resulted in a wrong idea of worship. To
a Pharisee, the service of God was a bondage which he did not love, but
which lie could not escape without a loss too great to bear. Ihe God of
the Pharisee was not a t iod eas\ to live with, ■> his religion became grim
and hard and loveless, it had to be so, for our notion ol < iod must always
determine the quality of our religion . . .
From a failure properly to understand (iod comes a word of un
happiness among good Christians even today. The Christian lift* is thought
to be a glum, unrelieved cross carrying under the eye of a tern Father
who expects much and excuses nothing, lie is austere, pei visli, highly
tempermental. and extremely hard to plea e. the kind of lite which
springs out of such libelous notions must of net rssity be but a parody on
I the true life in Christ...
The truth is that (iod is all love, and those w ho trust ITim never nerd
know anything but that love. He is ju.-t, indeed, and lie will not condone
sin; but through the blood of the everlasting comcnaut lie is able to act
toward us exactly a - if we had never sinned. I ouard the trusting sons of
men I lis mercy w ill always triumph over justice.
The fellowship of God is delightful beyond all telling lie communes
with His redeemed out - in an easy, uninhibited fellowship that is rest full
and healing to the soul, lb is not scsitive nor .-elfish nor tempermental.
What I le is today we shall find I litn tomorrow and the next day and
the next year. ITe is not bard to please, though He may bt hard to satisfy.
He expects of us only what lie has Himself first supplied, lie is quick to
mark every simple effort to pleast Him, and just as quick to overlook
imperfections when lie know - we meant to do Hill will. He loves us for
ourselves and values our love more than galaxit ot newly created
