# Coed Wins Trip To Los Angeles
## 
### 
The latest winner of a round
trip ticket to Los Angeles in the
Stanford Daily-Pacific Southwest
: Airlines basketball contest is Gail
i Louise Sorem, a graduate s t u
dent in physiology.
Miss Sorem and Don Folgner,
' graduate student in materials
scienr-e, both correctly picked the
winners of all ten contest games,
but Miss Sorem's prediction of a
68-63 Washington State victory in
the Indian-Cougar game was more
accurate then Folgner's 68-66
guess; the final score was 59-58.
This week's contest is the next
to-last of the season. The entry
blank appears in today's issue.
