# You Win A Few, You Lose A Few...
## That Was The Sports Weekend That Was 
### 
By Tilt' Ace Sports Stall
There have been sports week
ends with more glorious victories
and weekends with more ignomin
ious defeats, but never a weekend
with more varied action than the
one just past. Stanford teams
ventured forth on eight different
fronts and here are the results:
Baseball
Stanford baseballers survived a

live-run San Jose rally in the
ninth inning to edge the Spartans,
S-B, yesterday in Sunken Diamond.
The Indians ran their record to
-1-0, following two crushing vic
tories over inept San Francisco
State here last weekend.
Against San Jose, Ron Ye I t
slammed a triple and double and
George Thacher hit two singles as
Stanford took an 8-1 lead. The
Spartans then rapped Dick Ko
vacevich for four hiis and three
walks for five runs until John
Mason relieved Kovacevich and
promptly induced a double play
line drive to end the game.
Friday Stanford stomped the
Golden Gaters, 112-1. The game
was long and drawn-out. The In
dians scored early and often, ex
ploding for a seven-run second
inning to put the issue on ice.
Saturday the Tribe had little
trouble, gradually picking up mo
mentum until by the ninth inn
ing t hey had a 12-0 lead. Bob Cox
belted a single, double, and triple

to lead Stanford batters.
The freshmen opened their sea
son Saturday with an 8-5 deci
sion over Santa Clara. Bill Holt
pitched courageously for live inn
ings to register the victory. Frank
Klinger replaced him in the sixth
to put down a rally, then had to
survive a three-run Bronco upris
ing in the ninth inning.
Rugby
The Stanford Rugby team, tak
ing command from the start of
the game, rolled to their sixth
straight victory Saturday, defeat
ing the UCLA ruggers, 2f>-11.
On the first play after the
kickoff Dick Ragsdale swept 50
yards down the left sidelines for
a try. He then kicked the con
version and Stanford had a 5-0
lead in the opening moments of
play. From then on Uio Indians
were never headed.
Other Stanford scores came on
a 10-yard gallop by David Evans,
a scrum push, a long run by Dan
Terpack, a 15-yarder by Steve

Purcell, and a 20-yard intercepted |
pass by Bob Newberry.
Offensive star of the game was
Dick Ragsdale who individually
scored 11 points. This was his,
second 1 1-point game of the sea
son. Bob Newberry and H en r y j
Mac Queen both turned in fine de
fensive games and the whole
scrum dominated this game as
they have the entire season.
