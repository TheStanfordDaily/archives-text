# New Contact Provided To Dean's Office
## Moore To Act As Troubleshooter 
### MICHAEL ROSTER 
W hat aiv present student atti
tudes and opinions? Where do
they conflict with university
policy? What changes do stu
dents want to see in general uni
versity administration?
To answer these questions, the
Dean of Men's Office has brought
in Mollis Moore to serve as a link
between the students and the
deans. His job, as Moore describes
it, is to alleviate the most critical
"trouble spot" in the present sys
stem: that of poor communica
tion.
"I'VE TALKED with students,
faculty, and various administra
tors," said Moore. "The major
need in improving communication
is to provide more 'personalized'
contact."
Moore was graduated from
Stanford in ID6-4 magnum cum
laude and with membership in
Phi Beta Kappa. He was a mem
ber of Sigma Chi fraternity and
played three years in first string
varsity basketball.
He also served on the student
faculty committee and various
other boards. Moore is thus well
aware of undergraduate views
and problems.
"MY PRIMARY DUTY right
now is in dealing with frater
nities." he said. One of the major
problems in this area is with the
designing of the third fraternity
cluster.
However, Moore is also co n -
corned with the more general
problems of undergraduates. And
the dean's office has given him
full latitude in exploring these
problems and making recommen
dations for improvements.
"I'm truly impressed with most
of the administrators here at
Stanford," said Moore. "They
show a willingness and sincere
desire to find student views and
to make changes where needed."
THIS is NOT to say that
there are not problems. Moore
himself can cite numerous ex
amples from his own undergradu
ate experience where administra
tive decisions seemed unjustified.
Perhaps there was reason for
some of these decisions. But an
almost complete lack of com
munication brought only student
resentment and student hostility.
"To exchange ideas, to discuss
problems" is what is needed, ac
cording to Moore. "My job is to
find these problems and help
establish this exchange of ideas."
