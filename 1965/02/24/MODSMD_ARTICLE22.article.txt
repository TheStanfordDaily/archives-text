## Admission Myth Destroyed: Men Smarter Than Women 
### 
Editor, Tiie Daily:
Curious about the Administra
tion's reasons for maintaining the
unequal man-woman ratio, I re
cently visited the Admissions
Office and was given the follow
ing explanation, which I hope is
an accurate representation:
1. Set by the Board of Trustees,
the ratio is based on the national
average of men to women attend
ing college.
2. Men and women are accepted
according to the same academic
standards. J-fowever, of those ad
mitted to the present Freshman
class, the men, on the average,
had higher academic qualifica
tions than the women.
3. A higher percentage of men
than women are denied admission.
4. Even if the Trustees set no
ratio, the actual ratio would j
change very little. Stanford, with j
its emphasis on engineering and j
relative neglect of the humanities,}
is simply more attractive to m en ;
than to women (Merit Scholars!
excepted).
5. Lack «>f housing is a major I
limitation on admissions, since it j
is believed that one feature most j
attractive to women is on-campus j
housing. The recent poll indicat
ing to the contrary was dismissed
as having employed a biased sam
ple.
That the women are brighter j
than the men is a myth; that the j
ratio will change is doubt fid.

• Irresponsible Daily
Editor, The Daily:
If the AWS is being too "re- i
sponsible," The Daily is certainly
making up for it. If Otis Chand
ler were reviewing the soc legs
change and looked to The Daily
editorial column for a check on
responsible student opinion, he'd
curfew the men and lock the wom
en up at nine o'clock. Criticism of
the soc regs change procedure
may very well be justified, and
Justin Beck's editorial would
make a fine satire for the lower
front page, but it has no place on
the editorial page, to which th e
campus looks for well thought-out
and constructive comment on the
issues.

• Heck Satire Attacked
Dear Mr. Beck:
Now that you have played your
game of obnoxious lampoonery
once more, would you care to say
something profound about the
AWS and its attempt to approach
the extensive problem involved
in social regulations and changes
thereof? At. least they, Mr. Beck,
are making a conscious effort to
deal rationally with the problem.
Be they right or wrong in ap
proach — I can't sec that your
inane haranguing accomplishes

anything in a positive sort of
way. But then, I suppose trouble
causing is your forte.
The assumption of a bit of
mature responsibility on the part
of the editorial staff of The Daily
<or at least certain members i
thereof i would be an immense I
improvement, to be sure.

Dear >liss Steffen:
This letter is addressed to you j
or whoever wrote tlie editorial
titled "An Aphorism a Day" in i
the Daily on February 11.
You assert that Dr. Sterling's j
remarks to the IFC presented a I
challenge to "the Stanford stu-j
dent community." This is not!
true. His remarks were intended ;
| for that segment of Ihe student |
j community — the fraternity men
I -present at the IFC Banquet.
! This year's theme for Greek
| Week (a fraternity affair) was!
; "Meeting the Challenge." I on- i
| close a copy of the Greek Week j
| Program which was placed at ,
| each seat at the IFC Banquet. In
i his introductory remarks, I FC ■
; President Bill McGee pointed out
j that times are changing and that
i Stanford fraternities must meet j
j the challenge of these times, par
| ticularly academically.
When Dr. Sterling spoke, he,
| picked up the Greek Week "Chal
lenge" theme presented his
criteria to the fraternities.' He
was challenging the fraternity j
to measure up to the rest of the
University student body.
i May I now ask how your editor
i ial is justified? You have taken ;
; remarks completely out. of con*
; text and twisted them to meet
you r own purposes, whatever
i they may be. This is irresponsible ;
! and shows a total lack of editorial:
integrity. Editorial attack must j
' be based on honesty.

• Reply To Taylor
Editor, The Daily:
In answer to S. Brooke Taylor's
challenge, "Would someone please
show me a coeducational univer
sity of comparable stature which
offers its students more personal
freedom and more opportunity to
accept adult responsibility."
Cal women can live off-cam
pus. If they live in dorms, they
can leave overnight any time they
choose if they have a parents' re
lease (general, not specific.) The
range of political groups at Cal,
from Maoist to American Nazi,
seems to indicate some political
freedom, too.
Nobody is denying that Stan
ford is a great university. Only,
have you, Mr. Taylor, ever heard
of anyone coming to Stanford to

bo under Social Regs? Mo si
seem to come here in spite of
them.
