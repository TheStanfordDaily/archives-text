Two major problems confront
; the policies of the United States
in the Middle East. The first.
; stemming from the international
juridical claims of the Israeli
j Zionist organizations, primarily
affects Jewish Americans and is
| of consequence to the United
1 States and the immediate and/or
j crisis loyalty of its Jewish citi
-1 /.ens.
Zionism and Israel claim, first,
td constitute "the Jewish people"
national entity under public inter
national law, and, secondly, to
confer membership in the same
nationality entity. Thus, the State
of Israel claims to be "the Sov
: ereign State of the Jewish people"
rather than only the state of its
regular nationals. In the same
way the Zionist Organization pub
lic body claims to represent and
j to act for "the Jewish people"
| rather than only Zionists.
It is clear, however, that within
! the historical context no interna
j tional agreement < beginning with
' the 1917 Balfour Declaration) has
! granted the Zionists or Israel
i juridical authority for "Jewish
people" nationality claims, nor
been consistent with the appli
cable basic principles of public
international customary law.
Thus Israel and the Zionist
, Organization have sought to
establish their claims through
'customary international law.
i Customary law is composed of
! two elements: an uncontested par
ticular pattern of conduct in the
1 past, and an over-all moral right
> ness in the particular pattern.
I While the second element, moral
lightness, can be indefintely de
; bated, asserted or denied, the
United States government con-
I tests the first element.
The State Department "recog
nizes the State of Israel as a sov
j ereign State and citizenship of the
I State of Israel. It recognizes no

other sovereignty or citizenship in I
connection therewith. It does not
recognize a legal-political relation-!
ship based upon the religious I
identification of American citi-1
zens. It does not in any way dis- j
criminate among American citi
zens upon the basis of their reli-1
gion.
Accordingly, it should lie clearj
! that the Department of State does i
j not regard the 'Jewish people' j
| concept as a concept of interna-
I tional law." (Letter dated April 20, |
i 19(il from Phillip Talbot, Assist-1
i ant Secretary in the State De-J
I partment, to Elmer Berger, |
I American Council for Judaism.)!
Second Issue
The second major issue c on- j
fronting the United States is its'
j ability to pursue successfully its j
| many interests in the Middle East.!
; Prior to World War I American j
interests in the area were cul-,
Itural and commercial. Great Brit
ain was the dominant political!
and economic power in the Mid-j
j die East.
The inability of Great Britain to '
continue supporting Greece and;
the U.S. government's decision'
! 11947) to assume that responsibil-j
ity together with the support of;
1 Turkey virtually committed us to j
taking all necessary measures to j
[prevent the intrusion of Soviet:
power into the Middle East. The
• abortive 1951 Middle Eastern de-\
! dense proposals eventually led to !
| t he Baghdad Pact and, upon Iraq's
I withdrawal t after the 1958 revo
lution), to the Central Treaty Or
j ganization.
Territory Important
"So far as the sheer value of j
! territory is concerned," said Gen-!
eral Eisenhower "there is no more |
strategically important area in j
the world." But these lands which j
connect three continents and two
oceans are more than just, strate
gically important, for thev have
become the center of power and
political influence of the non
aligned nations, and the success
of U.S. policies the world over
will depend to a certain extent
on what is said and done in Cairo,
Baghdad, and Beirut.
Since World War I in general
and 1942 in particular (when the
Biltmore program was presented
by the Zionist Conference in New
York City) the United States has
followed a pro-Zionist policy de
! spite the near-complete opposition j
! of the State Department to th e i
! idea of a Jewish State. The rea
! sons for this are various, ranging
from the universal sympathy for
Jews following the Hitlerian per- j
I secutions to the well-organized
' Jewish-Zionist lobby, to President I
Truman's famous apology, "I am I

sorry, gentlemen, hut I have to 1
answer to hundreds of thou- :
sands who are anxious for th e
success of Zionism; I do not have
hundreds of thousands of Arabs'
among my constitutents."
Many Middle Eastern special- i
ists consider our present pro-!
Israel policy to he incompatible
with our national interests in the
Middle East. They point to the
rising demand in the Arab nations
for a clarification of our stand 1
in the Arab-Israeli conflict; to our ,
moral and politically reaffirmed j
obligation (through the United]
Nations) to the 1,200,000 Arab!
refugees of today ,and to our re- i
cent set-backs in the Middle East, i
If our interests and policies are
indeed incompatible, the necessary
policy revisions can only be ac
complished within the latitude of
American public opinion. This
flexibility depends on a real un
derstanding of ihc Middle East I
and the Arab-Israeli conflict. The i
image of the lazy, backward
Arah is out-dated. It is within the

namic an d determined Arah
world that a reexamination of
our Middle Eastern interests and
policies must take place.

Two major problems confront
; the policies of the United States
in the Middle East. The first.
; stemming from the international
juridical claims of the Israeli
j Zionist organizations, primarily
affects Jewish Americans and is
| of consequence to the United
1 States and the immediate and/or
j crisis loyalty of its Jewish citi
-1 /.ens.
Zionism and Israel claim, first,
td constitute "the Jewish people"
national entity under public inter
national law, and, secondly, to
confer membership in the same
nationality entity. Thus, the State
of Israel claims to be "the Sov
: ereign State of the Jewish people"
rather than only the state of its
regular nationals. In the same
way the Zionist Organization pub
lic body claims to represent and
j to act for "the Jewish people"
| rather than only Zionists.
It is clear, however, that within
! the historical context no interna
j tional agreement < beginning with
' the 1917 Balfour Declaration) has
! granted the Zionists or Israel
i juridical authority for "Jewish
people" nationality claims, nor
been consistent with the appli
cable basic principles of public
international customary law.
Thus Israel and the Zionist
, Organization have sought to
establish their claims through
'customary international law.
i Customary law is composed of
! two elements: an uncontested par
ticular pattern of conduct in the
1 past, and an over-all moral right
> ness in the particular pattern.
I While the second element, moral
lightness, can be indefintely de
; bated, asserted or denied, the
United States government con-
I tests the first element.
The State Department "recog
