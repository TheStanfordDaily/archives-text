# Koestler Sees Thought And Emotions As Inseparable
## 
### MIKE COHEN 
"Truth is a function of beauty,
Beauty a function of truth."
Arthur Koestler used this para
phrase of Keats last night to illus
trate two of the basic arguments
of his Tuesday Evening address:
that emotion cannot be separated
from thought in the creative proc
ess, and that the creative inspira
tion of the scientist and the artist
arc essentially identical.
KOESTLER began his lecture
by defining the creative leap of
both the scientist and artist as a
process of "bissociation."
The creative moment involves
a reordering of an established set.
of rules for thought and behavior.
Creation is, according to Koestler,
a revolutionary moment in that it
destroys part of the old code, and
replaces ii with new rules, now
ways of viewing the world around
us.
The creative insight occurs,
Koestler says, in the "games of
the underground," in the uncon
scious, which is free from "pre
vailing dogmatisms."
AFTER DISCUSSING the un

conscious aspects of creativity
Koestler turned to a discussion
of its emotional factors.
Koestler pointed to the ways
man can see himself: as a part of
a higher whole, or as a self-suffi
cient whole embodying subordi
nate parts.
He suggested that this dicho
tomy could be used as an organiz
ing principle in the classification
of human emotions.
WHEN MAN SEES himself as
a self-suffcient whole he demon
strates what Koestler called the
self-assertive emotions: rage,
hate, fear, sex drives, etc. These
arc emotions which the behavioral
sciences have begun to explore,
but we must not make the mis
take of thinking that these are
the only emotions.
There are also what Koestler
called the "self-transcending
emotions." which man experiences
when he feels himself to be a
part of a higher whole.
These are experiences such as
religious feelings or aethetie ap
preciation. They are strong emo
tions and Koestler notes that "the
self-transcending emotion are as
powerful as the self-assertive
drives." It is for that reason that
a man will die for the nation of
which he feels himself a part.
THESE EMOTIONS are central
motives in the creative search of
both the scientist and artist.
Koestler gave a series of illus
trations designed to demonstrate
that even the purest of sciences,
mathematics, very often verfies
its propositions through emo
tional means.
A mathematical theory is hold
to be true not because it per
fectly explains the facts, but be
cause its elegance, its beauty,
satisfy an almost aesthetic inner
sense of the mathematician.
Proceeding from mathematics
Koestler showed tliiit each of the
"less pure" sciences has a greater
component of subjectivity (of
"beauty" in his paraphrase of
Keats) and a'smaller component
of objectivity ("truth") until one
reaches t he arts-scienoesboundar\
1 psychoanalysis, for example) and
then moves {done the continuum

into the arts such as fiction which
are highly subjective but retain
a component of objectivity. All
•are, however, both objective and
[subjective, both "truth"and
' "beauty," both intellect and emo
-1 tion.

Beauty a function of truth."

A mathematical theory is hold
to be true not because it per
fectly explains the facts, but be
cause its elegance, its beauty,
satisfy an almost aesthetic inner
sense of the mathematician.
Proceeding from mathematics
Koestler showed tliiit each of the
"less pure" sciences has a greater
component of subjectivity (of
"beauty" in his paraphrase of
Keats) and a'smaller component
of objectivity ("truth") until one
reaches t he arts-scienoesboundar\

then moves {done the continuum

into the arts such as fiction which
are highly subjective but retain
a component of objectivity. All

-1 tion.
"Truth is a function of beauty,
Beauty a function of truth."
Arthur Koestler used this para
phrase of Keats last night to illus
trate two of the basic arguments
of his Tuesday Evening address:
that emotion cannot be separated
from thought in the creative proc
ess, and that the creative inspira
tion of the scientist and the artist
arc essentially identical.
KOESTLER began his lecture
by defining the creative leap of
both the scientist and artist as a
process of "bissociation."
The creative moment involves
a reordering of an established set.
of rules for thought and behavior.
Creation is, according to Koestler,
a revolutionary moment in that it
destroys part of the old code, and
replaces ii with new rules, now
ways of viewing the world around
us.
The creative insight occurs,
Koestler says, in the "games of
the underground," in the uncon
scious, which is free from "pre
vailing dogmatisms."
AFTER DISCUSSING the un

conscious aspects of creativity
Koestler turned to a discussion
of its emotional factors.
Koestler pointed to the ways
man can see himself: as a part of
a higher whole, or as a self-suffi
cient whole embodying subordi
nate parts.
He suggested that this dicho
tomy could be used as an organiz
ing principle in the classification
of human emotions.
WHEN MAN SEES himself as
a self-suffcient whole he demon
strates what Koestler called the
self-assertive emotions: rage,
hate, fear, sex drives, etc. These
arc emotions which the behavioral
sciences have begun to explore,
but we must not make the mis
take of thinking that these are
the only emotions.
There are also what Koestler
called the "self-transcending
emotions." which man experiences
when he feels himself to be a
part of a higher whole.
These are experiences such as
religious feelings or aethetie ap
preciation. They are strong emo
tions and Koestler notes that "the
self-transcending emotion are as
powerful as the self-assertive
drives." It is for that reason that
a man will die for the nation of
which he feels himself a part.
THESE EMOTIONS are central
motives in the creative search of
both the scientist and artist.
Koestler gave a series of illus
trations designed to demonstrate
that even the purest of sciences,
mathematics, very often verfies
its propositions through emo
tional means.
