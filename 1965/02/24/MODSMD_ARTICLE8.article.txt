would give women the option of signing out. and

changes in the present svstem.
CIIICK SCI,I.IVAN, the AWS Vice President,
also announced last night that the mass meeting

to examine the studies and tentative proposals
marie in the area of social regulations.

mittee is expected by the end of next week, with
the drafting of the report to begin this week.
TIIK si'BiIKCTIVK portions of tin* regs ques
tionnaires luive revealed a desire both for liberal

ized overnight policy and for liberalized hours for
senior women. In filling out the questionnaires,
most students, have tended to emphasize one or the
other but rarely both at once.
Questionnaires sent to a random sampling of
parents of Stanford coeds have revealed that par
ents are generally in favor of fairly conservative
regulat ions.
Interviews with Stanford administrators, coun
selors and other advisors have produced requests
for simplification of present social regs. Many per
sons interviewed also favor a well thought out
liberalization, if is desired by a majority of
women students.
The committee last night also approved a pro
posal, which will allow men in row house lobbies
until 2:30 on weekends. Lockup hours will remain
the same in each house, but men may be let in
after lockup.
Kach row house will be allowed to choose
whether or not ii will adopt the new policy. Mouses
favoring the change ma\ put it into effect begin
nin:: March 3.
