What the Bible Calls "Sin"
(Juite ;i few people joke about "secret >ins" not cjvtito realizing that sin
{ is a state of being. "Sins," which are specific deeds of wickedness like murder
| and fornication, stem from the state of sin, just as leaves "stem" from a branch.
The problem is not that you should give up secret vices and so-called pleasures,
! but that the underlving disease called "sin" should be cured.
"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adultery, fornication,
theft, false witness, slander." (Matthew 15 :1V >
Sin is "lawlessness," or basically. living in independence of Cod. (iod
is life, (iod is truth, (iod is lose, (iod is wisdom, (iod is light. We human
beings have been deluded by a Dark Power (Satan) into believing that we i
can successfully live in independence of our Creating Source. When the Bible
! says ( Romans 6 :J.i) that "the wages of sin i- death" it means that the result
! of liv ing in independence of (iod is complete and permanent separation from
| Him who alone is life and truth and love Infected by -in we human beings
j have been disconnected from the Power Supply of l.tfe and are like cut off
; branches, dying in our in>. withering and perishing daily, unless we seek
restoration to the Tree of Life.
Hut the good news of the New Testament concerns a (iod who really cares :
j "The wages of mii is death, but the (jiff of (iod is eternal life, through Jesus j
l Christ our Lord." ( Romans (5:2.?)
To become plugged into the Power Suppb of File, restored to a proper j'
relationship to (iod, is a very real experietue which happens to each individual I
who personally (by a commitment of bis will) receives Jesus Christ as his Lord. 1
This can be done at any time or any place, in a moment's time- such as in the i
quiet of one's room, or in counsel with a Christian friend. \o human mediators I
| are necessary or required. However, the commitment to Cod must be personal i
and individual.
Man lives under the great delusion that In rati be independent of (iod. Cn
j fortunately for liitn, lie cannot ! I'his is why the Apostle Paul tells those who
hare received Christ as Lord. "Do not yield your members to sin as instru
ments of wickedness, but yield yourselves to < -od a* men who have been brought
■ from death to lift and your members to Cod as instruments of righteousness.
I For sin will hav eno dominion over you, since you are not under law but under
i (Cod's grace . . . Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to anyone as
i obedient slaves, you are the slaves of the one whom von obey, cither of sin,
! which leads to death, or of obcdicnci , which leads to righteousness.'' (Romans
| 6 :12* 16) 1
Von are today either ,i servant of sin, or a servant of Jesus Christ. But a I
servant you are, and by no means are you the master of your own destiny and
, ruler of your own life "Another" ha> you in His control — either Sin (the |

What the Bible Calls "Sin"
(Juite ;i few people joke about "secret >ins" not cjvtito realizing that sin
{ is a state of being. "Sins," which are specific deeds of wickedness like murder
| and fornication, stem from the state of sin, just as leaves "stem" from a branch.
The problem is not that you should give up secret vices and so-called pleasures,
! but that the underlving disease called "sin" should be cured.
"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adultery, fornication,
theft, false witness, slander." (Matthew 15 :1V >
Sin is "lawlessness," or basically. living in independence of Cod. (iod
is life, (iod is truth, (iod is lose, (iod is wisdom, (iod is light. We human
beings have been deluded by a Dark Power (Satan) into believing that we i
can successfully live in independence of our Creating Source. When the Bible
! says ( Romans 6 :J.i) that "the wages of sin i- death" it means that the result
! of liv ing in independence of (iod is complete and permanent separation from
| Him who alone is life and truth and love Infected by -in we human beings
j have been disconnected from the Power Supply of l.tfe and are like cut off
; branches, dying in our in>. withering and perishing daily, unless we seek
restoration to the Tree of Life.
Hut the good news of the New Testament concerns a (iod who really cares :
j "The wages of mii is death, but the (jiff of (iod is eternal life, through Jesus j
l Christ our Lord." ( Romans (5:2.?)
To become plugged into the Power Suppb of File, restored to a proper j'
relationship to (iod, is a very real experietue which happens to each individual I
who personally (by a commitment of bis will) receives Jesus Christ as his Lord. 1
This can be done at any time or any place, in a moment's time- such as in the i
quiet of one's room, or in counsel with a Christian friend. \o human mediators I
| are necessary or required. However, the commitment to Cod must be personal i
and individual.
Man lives under the great delusion that In rati be independent of (iod. Cn
j fortunately for liitn, lie cannot ! I'his is why the Apostle Paul tells those who
hare received Christ as Lord. "Do not yield your members to sin as instru
ments of wickedness, but yield yourselves to < -od a* men who have been brought
■ from death to lift and your members to Cod as instruments of righteousness.
I For sin will hav eno dominion over you, since you are not under law but under
i (Cod's grace . . . Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to anyone as
i obedient slaves, you are the slaves of the one whom von obey, cither of sin,
! which leads to death, or of obcdicnci , which leads to righteousness.'' (Romans
| 6 :12* 16) 1
Von are today either ,i servant of sin, or a servant of Jesus Christ. But a I
servant you are, and by no means are you the master of your own destiny and
, ruler of your own life "Another" ha> you in His control — either Sin (the |

The problem is not that you should give up secret vices and so-called pleasures,
! but that the underlving disease called "sin" should be cured.
"For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adultery, fornication,
theft, false witness, slander." (Matthew 15 :1V >
Sin is "lawlessness," or basically. living in independence of Cod. (iod
is life, (iod is truth, (iod is lose, (iod is wisdom, (iod is light. We human
beings have been deluded by a Dark Power (Satan) into believing that we i
can successfully live in independence of our Creating Source. When the Bible
! says ( Romans 6 :J.i) that "the wages of sin i- death" it means that the result
! of liv ing in independence of (iod is complete and permanent separation from
| Him who alone is life and truth and love Infected by -in we human beings
j have been disconnected from the Power Supply of l.tfe and are like cut off
; branches, dying in our in>. withering and perishing daily, unless we seek
restoration to the Tree of Life.
Hut the good news of the New Testament concerns a (iod who really cares :
j "The wages of mii is death, but the (jiff of (iod is eternal life, through Jesus j
l Christ our Lord." ( Romans (5:2.?)
To become plugged into the Power Suppb of File, restored to a proper j'
relationship to (iod, is a very real experietue which happens to each individual I
who personally (by a commitment of bis will) receives Jesus Christ as his Lord. 1
This can be done at any time or any place, in a moment's time- such as in the i
quiet of one's room, or in counsel with a Christian friend. \o human mediators I
| are necessary or required. However, the commitment to Cod must be personal i
and individual.
Man lives under the great delusion that In rati be independent of (iod. Cn
j fortunately for liitn, lie cannot ! I'his is why the Apostle Paul tells those who
hare received Christ as Lord. "Do not yield your members to sin as instru
ments of wickedness, but yield yourselves to < -od a* men who have been brought
■ from death to lift and your members to Cod as instruments of righteousness.
I For sin will hav eno dominion over you, since you are not under law but under
i (Cod's grace . . . Do you not know that if you yield yourselves to anyone as
i obedient slaves, you are the slaves of the one whom von obey, cither of sin,
! which leads to death, or of obcdicnci , which leads to righteousness.'' (Romans
| 6 :12* 16) 1
Von are today either ,i servant of sin, or a servant of Jesus Christ. But a I
servant you are, and by no means are you the master of your own destiny and
, ruler of your own life "Another" ha> you in His control — either Sin (the |
personification of evil which tlu I'ihlc call- tlit - devil or Satan), or Jesus
i Christ (the Ford of Fife), is your master. Whom are you serving? Whom are ,
; you depending upon 112 Who sustains and energizes your iile. Don't be fooled
| by the delusion of .*<•// .sufficiency. Fet Jesus Christ be your Ford today.
