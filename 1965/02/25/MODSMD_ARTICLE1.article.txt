French-Soviet accord hut President Johnson was reported far from
convinced that the Communists want to engage in meaningful ne
gotiations now.
In Moscow—Diplomatic informants said the Soviet Union would
seek at any conference the neutralization of South Viet Nam, some
thing the United States has regarded with a jaundiced eye.
In Peking Premier Chou En-lai of Red China said any settle
ment in Viet Nam would hinge on withdrawal of U.S. military forces.
In New York —U.N. Secretary-General U Thant said he had made
proposals to the United States and other nations concerned for a

the fighting and let the United States withdraw gracefully from

In Warsaw, Poland —U.S. Ambassador John Moors Cabot met
with Red Chinese Ambassador Wang Kuo-chuan in what diplomats
viewed as an attempt to avert an expanded war in Viet Nam.

with skepticism. One source asked why call a conference now "when
there is plainly no possible basis on which the principal contenders
could negotiate?"

VIET NAM
• Negotiations On Viet IS am Continue
PARIS — Fiance and the Soviet Union agreed yesterday to co
operate to seek a solution of the Viet Nam crisis at the international
conference table.
As the two nations reached their accord at the initiative of the
Soviet Union, there were other developments in world capitals:
In Washington The White House declined to comment on the
French-Soviet accord hut President Johnson was reported far from
convinced that the Communists want to engage in meaningful ne
gotiations now.
In Moscow—Diplomatic informants said the Soviet Union would
seek at any conference the neutralization of South Viet Nam, some
thing the United States has regarded with a jaundiced eye.
In Peking Premier Chou En-lai of Red China said any settle
ment in Viet Nam would hinge on withdrawal of U.S. military forces.
In New York —U.N. Secretary-General U Thant said he had made
proposals to the United States and other nations concerned for a
negotiated settlement and was confident ways could be found to end
the fighting and let the United States withdraw gracefully from
South Viet Nam.
In Warsaw, Poland —U.S. Ambassador John Moors Cabot met
with Red Chinese Ambassador Wang Kuo-chuan in what diplomats
viewed as an attempt to avert an expanded war in Viet Nam.
In London—-British sources greeted the Soviet-French accord
with skepticism. One source asked why call a conference now "when
there is plainly no possible basis on which the principal contenders
could negotiate?"
