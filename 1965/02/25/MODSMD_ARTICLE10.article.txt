## 
### 
The Workshop, a new, uncler
graduate-produced bi-weekly .jour
nal, will make its appearance on
the campus literary scene regis
tration day of Spring Quarter.
The new publication, to come
out in mimeographed form a n d
sell for a dime, is the result of a
year of planning by sophomore
Henry Alloy.
ITS PURPOSE, according to
Alley, who will co-edit the journal
with senior English-major Charles
Fels, is "to bring literature out of
its alien shell and make it a living
part of the campus by present
ing it informally and at low
cost."
Its informality will make it at
tractive to the ignored literary tal
ent in the undergraduate commu
nity, and. as such, the Workshop
"will appeal to the undergrauate
student population as the Se
quoia cannot," Alley stated.
"The Stanford literary malaise
is due to shyness, not apathy," he
said. "We hope to search o u t
those people who are too modest
to present their work to the pres
ently established publications."

Alley, will emphasize diversity
and accessibility. It will be open
to poetry, short stories, and criti
cal essays, he said.

frequency of publication, staff
member Evelyn Hutterer said she
thought the journal "will be alive
in a sense that a magazine that
comes out once a quarter cannot."
Pat Tipton, another staffer,
thinks that the campus will be
receptive to the Workshop. "I
think there are introspective pco
| pie, especially in the large resi
dences, who could really use this
I publication," she said.
I Manuscript collection boxes will
be located in the English Depart
j ment building on Quad, in various
living residences, in the Storke
Publications Building, in the Main
Library, and in Tresidder Union.
An editorial board of fifteen
people, under the advisorship of
