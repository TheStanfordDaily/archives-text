## SU Onlookers Peek At Soviet Athletes' Form 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Several hundred students and other interested individuals spi ut
part ol yesterda) alteruoon basking in the sun alonu; the outer eon
fines ol Angell Field. hopeful of a chance to see in action a ;j[roiip
ol si\ Russian track and field athletes.
Most observers came expressly to see the two most famous

athletes of the group, world rec
ord holders Valeryi Brumel and
Igor Terovaneseyn. It was iheir
day off and they were nowhere
to be seen.
JUMI'KKS, it seems, tail off
suddenly as a meet approaches.
Instead of leaping into sand and
sawdust pits, they were dinner
guests at a nearby country club.
The athletes who have com
peted in four U.S. meets already
and are now preparing for their
last meet tomorrow night in San
Francisco are the following: Val
eryi Bulvshev (distance runner),
Antolyi Tvfiehahlov (high hurdler).
Valeryi Brumel (high jumper),
Igor Terovaneseyn (broad jump),
Gonnady Bu/.nitzsov (pole vault),
and Tamara Press (women's shot
put and discus).
As I arrived, Tamara Press,
clad in sky blue sweats, was prac
ticing one of her specialties, the
shot put. She holds the world
record in this event and also the
discus. In her illustrious track
career, she has accumulated three
gold medals in the Olympics and
ten in USA-USSR competition.
Standing at the back of the
shot put circle, with her back to
the throwing area, her face is ex
pressionless. This is purported
to be an outward sign of a state i
of relaxed concentration. Her left |
arm is straight up. her right hand j
contains the shot and perches on !
her right shoulder.
TWO QUICK STEPS to the
right with her mouth wide open,
a final grunt, and the shot is aloft, j
later to raise chalk from the farth- 1
est lino. As the shot hits, she lets;

loose a few select Russian voci
ferations expressing her approval
or dissatisfaction with her effort.
The other Russian to perform
was Valeryi Bulyshev, who holds
the Soviet national record for the
half mile, a 1:46.7. lie stripped his
sweats and jogged several laps.
As he finished his short workout
he t.-ivc the crowd a gesture of
victory hands clasped over hi"
head. A hi! cocky, perhaps.
Antoli Mickahlov. a high hurd
ler, spent most of his time talking
with several acquaintances who
could speak Russian and taking
pictures wilh his movie camera.
MOST ENTHUSIASTIC of the
spectators was undoubtedly an
employee at Stern who introduced
himself to all the Russian athletes
and to anybody else who looked
as if they would lie interested in
the role he played in international
relations. "Remember me, I'm the
guy who gave you your food last
time you were here." They re
membered, or at least said they
did.
Accompanying the athletes on
their tour of the U.S. which in
cludes five meets is Gavril Korob
kov, the articulate and personable
Soviet National Coach. This is
his fifth visit to the United States,
and he enjoys competing here. He
has been especially pleased with
the performances of Gennady
Bu/.nitzsov, who has won the pole
vault competition twice on th e
tour.
KOROBKOV feels that sports, j
track and field in particular, can j
do a great deal to develop good
relations between countries.
"Everybody looks when you per
form, and a good performance re
flects on the country you repre
sent."
He said he liked the climate in j
California, but then added that !
most of the outstanding track and
field stars in the Soviet Union
come from areas that, have heavy
snowfall.
"The athletes from the south
of our country where there is
nice weather all year are to o
lazy. And besides that, there is
too much wine there." A dry
sense of humor, I thought.

Most observers came expressly to see the two most famous

athletes of the group, world rec
ord holders Valeryi Brumel and
Igor Terovaneseyn. It was iheir
day off and they were nowhere
to be seen.
JUMI'KKS, it seems, tail off
suddenly as a meet approaches.
Instead of leaping into sand and
sawdust pits, they were dinner
guests at a nearby country club.
The athletes who have com
peted in four U.S. meets already
and are now preparing for their
last meet tomorrow night in San
Francisco are the following: Val
eryi Bulvshev (distance runner),
Antolyi Tvfiehahlov (high hurdler).
Valeryi Brumel (high jumper),
Igor Terovaneseyn (broad jump),
Gonnady Bu/.nitzsov (pole vault),
and Tamara Press (women's shot
put and discus).
As I arrived, Tamara Press,
clad in sky blue sweats, was prac
ticing one of her specialties, the
shot put. She holds the world
record in this event and also the
discus. In her illustrious track
career, she has accumulated three
gold medals in the Olympics and
ten in USA-USSR competition.
Standing at the back of the
shot put circle, with her back to
the throwing area, her face is ex
pressionless. This is purported
to be an outward sign of a state i
of relaxed concentration. Her left |
arm is straight up. her right hand j
contains the shot and perches on !
her right shoulder.
TWO QUICK STEPS to the
right with her mouth wide open,
a final grunt, and the shot is aloft, j
later to raise chalk from the farth- 1
est lino. As the shot hits, she lets;

loose a few select Russian voci
ferations expressing her approval
or dissatisfaction with her effort.
The other Russian to perform
was Valeryi Bulyshev, who holds
the Soviet national record for the
half mile, a 1:46.7. lie stripped his
sweats and jogged several laps.
As he finished his short workout
he t.-ivc the crowd a gesture of
victory hands clasped over hi"
head. A hi! cocky, perhaps.
Antoli Mickahlov. a high hurd
ler, spent most of his time talking
with several acquaintances who
could speak Russian and taking
pictures wilh his movie camera.
MOST ENTHUSIASTIC of the
spectators was undoubtedly an
employee at Stern who introduced
himself to all the Russian athletes
and to anybody else who looked
as if they would lie interested in
the role he played in international
relations. "Remember me, I'm the
