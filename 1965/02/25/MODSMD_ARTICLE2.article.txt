# New Accelerator Installed To Complement Two-Miler
## 
### 
A new Van de Graaff "tandem"
linear electron accelerator has
just been installed in a basement
vault of the Varian Laboratory of
Physics. The new atom smasher
will be used for research in low
energy physics.
Professors Walter E. Meyerhof
and Stanley S. Hanna will direct
the Van de Graaff's operations.
With the new accelerator, they
will explore the forces that hold
particles of the automic nucleus
together.
The Van de Graaff will comple
ment the two-mile, high energy
accelerator, presently in construc
tion. The high energy accelerator
Is used primarily to create new
particles themselves.
The new atom smasher acceler
ates protrons and deuterons at
energies up to L 8 million electron

volts.
It cost approximately $1.9 mil
lion and research operations will
run around $300,000 a year, both
financed by the National Science
Foundation.
Both operate on the "electro
static" principle, pulling charged
atoms, or ions, toward a high
voltage terminal. It was one of
the earliest types of accelerators,
invented in 1931 by Robert J.
Van de Graaff of MIT.
"Our understanding of nuclear
structure cannot be said to be
sufficiently complete until on the
one hand the character of the
nuclear force Is understood in
detail, and on the other hand the
static and dynamic properties of
co m p Ie x nuclei become clear
enough to give a thorough under
standing of nuclear models and
their interrelations,"
