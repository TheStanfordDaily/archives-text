### TOM EDISON 
A sport originating with the
North American Indians, lacrosse
has once again captured the spirit
of a hearty group of Indians who,
with a fondness for the outdoors
and a love for competition, have
turned to this sport as a lumber
jack turns to fighting.
Lacrosse exists at Stanford only
in rudimentary forms, the sport
being organized only two years
ago. Aspirations for bigger and
better things are strong. All par
ticipation is voluntary.

HOWIE TAYLOR is presently
the so-called coach, with Parker
Llewellyn acting as captain. Spon
soring Stanford's lacrosse team is
the Northern California Lacrosse
Club.
This club hopes to see lacrosse
become a major sport in this area.
They donate all ihe money for
trips and have provided the In
dian's with all their present
equipment. Besides the team at
Stanford they have also organ
ized contigcnts in San Francisco
and Palo Alto.

I The University of California
I may also organize a lacrosse team.
| Competition has thus greatly ex
panded for Stanford's lacrosse
team.
PRACTICES will officially com-
I mence next Monday. Stanford's
first scheduled game will be
March 6 wilh a Palo Alto team
composed mostly of Stanford
! graduates who wish to continue
their performance in this sport.
; Other contests will be held against
the Air Force Academy, Univer
sity of Colorado, Claremont Col
liege, the Southern California All-
Stars ,and the Marines from Camp
Pendleton.
THE MARINES were the only
team to defeat Stanford last year,
and they continually produce an
outstanding team. Stanford's
: schedule consists of seven games
and a possible eighth with Cali
fornia.
Importance is placed on quick
and accurate passing in this game
with the action occurring on an
openfield about the size of a foot
ball field. The game resembles ice
hockey somewhat with goals
scored by out-maneuvering the
opposition and firing the base
ball-size puck in the six-foot
square netted goal.
