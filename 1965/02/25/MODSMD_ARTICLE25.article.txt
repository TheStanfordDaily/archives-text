## Cockfighting: A Profile in (Chickenly) Courage 
### Roger Magnuson 
"The crucial question we must ask, ladies and gentlemen,'
Slattery was finishing in a flourish of oleagenous rhetoric, "is
whether the American people can tolerate something so brutal to
the human spirit as boxing.
"Interesting question," came a voice from the back of the

smoke-filled television room, '"but
perhaps not so relevant as to ask
whether the American people can
tolerate something so gross as
Slattery's People."
Now Slattery was addressing
the camera directly, "We got rid
of cock-fighting," he said, "we
can get rid of boxing."
And so ended a hoary hour of
hortatory directed against box
ing, with the camera focusing on
an old, greying Negro being
smashed twenty consecutive limes
in the head, and Slattery looking
on indignantly.
Actually the arguments pro
ducer! against boxing are easily
enough confuted by noting thai
fighting does keep juveniles off
the streets, Unless, perhaps, the
juveniles are in Viet Nam.
Cock Fighling Gets Bad Press
But the first parts of Slattery's
non-sequitur, the slur against
cock-fighting, is a more serious
affront to the world of sports;
it's just another example of Ihe
"bad press" cock-fighting has been
getting the past few decades.
Where is the social studies text
book, outside Orange County,
which doesn't mention the sport
wilh a swell of pejorative adjec
tives in a chapter sandwiched
somewhere in between the "Rob
ber Barons" and "Man's Last
Best Hope."
Where is the Audubon Society
member who, over a luncheon of
fried chicken, doesn't point to
cock-fighting as the dark "Kon
trastgestalt" to modern enlighten
ment?
No, let's break the moratorium
on cock-fighting, eschew th e
"noble experiment" proclivities of
some segments of out population
and bring back a noble early-
American tradition into the world
of games. Let's bring back th e
cock-fight.
The advantages of such a pro
posal boggle the mind; making
Stanford the cock-fight capital of
the world would be equivalent to
making Harvard known as Ihe
"Stanford of the East."
-fobs For The Semi-skilled
First, there would a surge of
new employment opportunities on
the peninsula. Thousands of jobs
would be created for semi-skilled
workers; the increase in admin
istrators alone would be substan
tial.
Indeed, with a Dean of Cock
fights, four or five Assistant
Deans of Cock-fights, five or six
Associate Deans «>1 Cock-fights,
several liaisons and coordinators,
and peripheral employees, there
wouldn't be an unemployed ad

ministrator west of the Air Force
Academy.
And secondly, who has not,
along with Sen. Fulbright,
■ ; "viewed with alarm" our surplus
of chickens due to European tariff
i restrictions, and the shaky con
dition of many loyal, upstanding
chicken growers? The return of
cock-fighting would do for these
people what dog-racing does for
the makers of mechanical rabbits.
Hauteur Among The Breeders
The breeding of gamecocks for
j important single-elimination tour-
I naments would develop into a
highly skilled profession and
icreate a little respect, if not
hauteur, among a subset of our
population so long deprived of
the cavalier disposition.
But the most important argu
ment for its return, as one of the
' most important arguments for
anything at Stanford, is finan
cial, and concomitant with the
introduction of parimutuals.
Stanford does well enough fi
nancially on its major sports now,
without parimutuals. With pari
mutuals, cock-fighting wou 1 d
j make the noi inconsiderable coin
! extracted from football appear a
veritable pittance.
A New PACE
Getting the parimutuals might
be somewhat of a finesse opera
tion, but once we had them we
could develop a new and better
PACE program: "Parimutuals
and cock-fighting. ... Euphoria."
And of course, close circuit tele
vision and/or pay TV would pro
vide another source of tuition
: money.
And the New PACE would cer
tainly excel the old operation.
Is not, one might ask. the in
dependence and self-respect of
running a profitable business pa
tronized by uncoerced throngs of
American citizens, filling up Stan
ford stadium and casting t heir
dollar votes for cock-fighting, a
'better, more American way of
raising money than the poor
mouth, tin cup approach?
Would not Lcland Stanford
think so?
A Eot Of Red Ro<tfs
Yes, one cock-fight under the
new PACE could construct a lot
of red tile roofs, and could be paid
for by many on-Stanford citizens,
but the final justification lies
within the sport itself.
Gamecock against gamecock,
battling nobly before thousands
of cheering spectators, a para
digm of the manly, or chickenly,
i art of self-defense.
It might almost be enough to
give the epithet "chicken" a good
name.

Cock Fighling Gets Bad Press
But the first parts of Slattery's
non-sequitur, the slur against
cock-fighting, is a more serious
affront to the world of sports;
it's just another example of Ihe
"bad press" cock-fighting has been
getting the past few decades.
Where is the social studies text
book, outside Orange County,
which doesn't mention the sport
wilh a swell of pejorative adjec

Best Hope."
Where is the Audubon Society

cock-fighting as the dark "Kon

No, let's break the moratorium
on cock-fighting, eschew th e
"noble experiment" proclivities of
some segments of out population
and bring back a noble early-
American tradition into the world
of games. Let's bring back th e
cock-fight.
The advantages of such a pro
posal boggle the mind; making
Stanford the cock-fight capital of
the world would be equivalent to
making Harvard known as Ihe
"Stanford of the East."
-fobs For The Semi-skilled
First, there would a surge of
new employment opportunities on
the peninsula. Thousands of jobs
would be created for semi-skilled
workers; the increase in admin
istrators alone would be substan
tial.
Indeed, with a Dean of Cock
fights, four or five Assistant
Deans of Cock-fights, five or six
Associate Deans «>1 Cock-fights,
several liaisons and coordinators,
and peripheral employees, there
wouldn't be an unemployed ad

ministrator west of the Air Force
Academy.
And secondly, who has not,
along with Sen. Fulbright,
■ ; "viewed with alarm" our surplus
of chickens due to European tariff
i restrictions, and the shaky con
dition of many loyal, upstanding
chicken growers? The return of
cock-fighting would do for these
people what dog-racing does for
the makers of mechanical rabbits.
Hauteur Among The Breeders
The breeding of gamecocks for
j important single-elimination tour-
I naments would develop into a
highly skilled profession and
icreate a little respect, if not
hauteur, among a subset of our
population so long deprived of
the cavalier disposition.
But the most important argu
ment for its return, as one of the
' most important arguments for
anything at Stanford, is finan
cial, and concomitant with the
introduction of parimutuals.
Stanford does well enough fi
nancially on its major sports now,
without parimutuals. With pari
mutuals, cock-fighting wou 1 d
j make the noi inconsiderable coin
! extracted from football appear a
veritable pittance.
A New PACE
Getting the parimutuals might
be somewhat of a finesse opera
tion, but once we had them we
could develop a new and better
PACE program: "Parimutuals
and cock-fighting. ... Euphoria."
And of course, close circuit tele
vision and/or pay TV would pro
vide another source of tuition
: money.
And the New PACE would cer
tainly excel the old operation.
Is not, one might ask. the in
dependence and self-respect of
running a profitable business pa
tronized by uncoerced throngs of
American citizens, filling up Stan
ford stadium and casting t heir
dollar votes for cock-fighting, a
'better, more American way of
raising money than the poor
mouth, tin cup approach?
Would not Lcland Stanford
think so?
A Eot Of Red Ro<tfs
Yes, one cock-fight under the
new PACE could construct a lot
of red tile roofs, and could be paid
for by many on-Stanford citizens,
but the final justification lies
within the sport itself.
Gamecock against gamecock,
battling nobly before thousands
of cheering spectators, a para
digm of the manly, or chickenly,
i art of self-defense.
It might almost be enough to
give the epithet "chicken" a good
name.
"The crucial question we must ask, ladies and gentlemen,'
Slattery was finishing in a flourish of oleagenous rhetoric, "is
whether the American people can tolerate something so brutal to
the human spirit as boxing.
"Interesting question," came a voice from the back of the

smoke-filled television room, '"but
perhaps not so relevant as to ask
whether the American people can
tolerate something so gross as
Slattery's People."
Now Slattery was addressing
the camera directly, "We got rid
of cock-fighting," he said, "we
can get rid of boxing."
And so ended a hoary hour of
hortatory directed against box
ing, with the camera focusing on
an old, greying Negro being
smashed twenty consecutive limes
in the head, and Slattery looking
on indignantly.
Actually the arguments pro
ducer! against boxing are easily
enough confuted by noting thai
fighting does keep juveniles off
the streets, Unless, perhaps, the
juveniles are in Viet Nam.

American tradition into the world
of games. Let's bring back th e
cock-fight.
The advantages of such a pro
posal boggle the mind; making
Stanford the cock-fight capital of
the world would be equivalent to
making Harvard known as Ihe
"Stanford of the East."
-fobs For The Semi-skilled
First, there would a surge of
new employment opportunities on
the peninsula. Thousands of jobs
would be created for semi-skilled
workers; the increase in admin
istrators alone would be substan
tial.
Indeed, with a Dean of Cock
fights, four or five Assistant
Deans of Cock-fights, five or six
Associate Deans «>1 Cock-fights,
several liaisons and coordinators,
and peripheral employees, there
wouldn't be an unemployed ad

ministrator west of the Air Force
Academy.
And secondly, who has not,
along with Sen. Fulbright,
■ ; "viewed with alarm" our surplus
of chickens due to European tariff
i restrictions, and the shaky con
dition of many loyal, upstanding
chicken growers? The return of
cock-fighting would do for these
people what dog-racing does for
the makers of mechanical rabbits.
Hauteur Among The Breeders
The breeding of gamecocks for
j important single-elimination tour-
I naments would develop into a
highly skilled profession and
icreate a little respect, if not
hauteur, among a subset of our
population so long deprived of
the cavalier disposition.
But the most important argu
ment for its return, as one of the
' most important arguments for
anything at Stanford, is finan
cial, and concomitant with the
introduction of parimutuals.
Stanford does well enough fi
nancially on its major sports now,
without parimutuals. With pari
mutuals, cock-fighting wou 1 d
j make the noi inconsiderable coin
! extracted from football appear a
veritable pittance.
A New PACE
Getting the parimutuals might
be somewhat of a finesse opera
tion, but once we had them we
could develop a new and better
PACE program: "Parimutuals
and cock-fighting. ... Euphoria."
And of course, close circuit tele
vision and/or pay TV would pro
vide another source of tuition
: money.
And the New PACE would cer
tainly excel the old operation.
Is not, one might ask. the in
dependence and self-respect of
running a profitable business pa
tronized by uncoerced throngs of
American citizens, filling up Stan
ford stadium and casting t heir
dollar votes for cock-fighting, a
'better, more American way of
raising money than the poor
mouth, tin cup approach?
Would not Lcland Stanford
think so?
A Eot Of Red Ro<tfs
Yes, one cock-fight under the
new PACE could construct a lot
of red tile roofs, and could be paid
for by many on-Stanford citizens,
but the final justification lies
within the sport itself.
Gamecock against gamecock,
battling nobly before thousands
of cheering spectators, a para
digm of the manly, or chickenly,
i art of self-defense.
It might almost be enough to
give the epithet "chicken" a good
name.
"The crucial question we must ask, ladies and gentlemen,'
Slattery was finishing in a flourish of oleagenous rhetoric, "is
whether the American people can tolerate something so brutal to
the human spirit as boxing.
"Interesting question," came a voice from the back of the

smoke-filled television room, '"but
perhaps not so relevant as to ask
whether the American people can
tolerate something so gross as
Slattery's People."
Now Slattery was addressing
the camera directly, "We got rid
of cock-fighting," he said, "we
can get rid of boxing."
And so ended a hoary hour of
hortatory directed against box
ing, with the camera focusing on
an old, greying Negro being
smashed twenty consecutive limes
in the head, and Slattery looking
on indignantly.
Actually the arguments pro
ducer! against boxing are easily
enough confuted by noting thai
fighting does keep juveniles off
the streets, Unless, perhaps, the
juveniles are in Viet Nam.
Cock Fighling Gets Bad Press
But the first parts of Slattery's
non-sequitur, the slur against
cock-fighting, is a more serious
affront to the world of sports;
it's just another example of Ihe
"bad press" cock-fighting has been
getting the past few decades.
Where is the social studies text
book, outside Orange County,
which doesn't mention the sport
wilh a swell of pejorative adjec
tives in a chapter sandwiched
somewhere in between the "Rob
ber Barons" and "Man's Last
Best Hope."
Where is the Audubon Society
member who, over a luncheon of
fried chicken, doesn't point to
cock-fighting as the dark "Kon
trastgestalt" to modern enlighten
ment?
No, let's break the moratorium
on cock-fighting, eschew th e
"noble experiment" proclivities of
some segments of out population
and bring back a noble early-
American tradition into the world
of games. Let's bring back th e
cock-fight.
