# Social Regulation: Karate Chop To Freedoms Of Responsibility
## 
### DARRELL HALVERSON 
Students at Stanford have seen women's social
regulations criticized periodically for a number
of years. Until this year critical concern has come
from a small segment of the student population.
Now, however, a sustained critique of the system
has taken form through the efforts of men and
women working as individuals and in groups.
The campus as a whole seems to have grasped
the basic contradiction of social regulation within
an educational environment engendered to instill
values. Students now are interested in restructur
ing the Stanford social milieu so that it reflects
student attitudes more accurately and positively
than in the past.
Relate To People
Students think that social regulations, if there
are to be any at all, must relate directly to the kind
of people they are, or hope to be through their
experience at Stanford. This thinking comes from
women and men, since both are affected by the
regulation of either group. To understand the
significance of this kind of thinking and the new
breed of Stanford student who originates it, one
should examine the motivations of the students
in the continuing social regulations controversy.
Most students experience, upon coming to col
lege, an unusual measure of independence they
never had before. All seem to relish this freedom
to choose, even if some are not as adept at man
aging it as others.
In short, students accept the greater freedom of
college life and acknowledge the added responsibil
ity that comes with it. Where they fail is in not
fully understanding and protecting their new free
dom to choose. Passively accepting a blanket
regulation of social life is one example of this
failure. When the university seeks to regulate
arbitrarily the social milieu, it is exercising a deci
sion-making power in "a matter of conscience."
This is not a legitimate prerogative of any educa
tional institution.
Invasion Of Privacy
In addition, the reporting and clerical functions
of Stanford social regulations clearly constitute
an invasion of privacy when women students are
empowered --- and, in fact, obligated to have
knowledge of others' personal lives. A number of
arguments can be mounted against this practice.
Before examining t ho logical arguments against
social regulations, however, a review of their ori
gins and development might be helpful.
Women's social regulations at Stanford are
made, interestingly enough, by the women (the
Social Regulations Committee of the Associated
Women Students) and approved by the Dean of
Women.
In recent years, the approved social regulations
have appeared in a booklet which outlines various
concerns—dress, etiquette, hours—in general, set
ting up the "do's" and "don'ts" of social life for
women on the campus. Until this year, the book
let was regarded as humorous, innocuous or, at
most, a nuisance. Now, however, thinking has
changed.
Regulation Accepted
Because students are regulated daily by rules
and procedures aimed at efficiency, safety, health
or some other consideration, they have accepted
regulation of their social lives as just another con
cession to the ideal of better living — up to now.
Today's Stanford students have struck upon the
not so profound idea that "arbitrary regulation"
and "value development" may be antithetical con
cepts within the university environment. Stanford
asks and assists students to acquire a liberal edu
cation "designed to produce a citizen worthy of a
free society and a free university." How, students
ask, can one form meaningful, durable values
the kind that contribute to a "free society" when
the opportunity to do so is undermined by the
existence of an arbitrary system of values?
For, in fact, social regulations must presume
some values to be meaningful. If these are not
matured, student values, can they be accepted as
relevant to students? Students think not.
Social regulations tacitly assume that students
are either unable or unwilling lo control respon

sibily their own behavior. Student do not assume
this, and neither can a university whose primary
goal is the education of young men and women
to make their own intelligent decisions in all con
cerns ol their lives—including social concerns.
Internal Values
By and large, students believe that the values
necessary for responsible, autonomous behavior by
anyone must come from within that person and
not from some external authority. Consistent with
this point of view, they see the present social
regulations as symbols of distrust and suspicion.
For in telling women how to act, why and
where, these regulations imply that women are in
capable of independent and responsible action. But
acting alone is an integral part of adult life and
it seems that a university experience must do more
than "rehearse" one for such action. Perhaps a
specific criticism of the social regulations will be
helpful in illustrating this point.
The "2:30 a.m. lock-out rule" has received much
attention from students. In the past, deans, dormi
tory supervisors and some of the students them
selves have justified this regulation by saying
that it protects a woman's health, contributes to
her security and, less importantly, gives her an
arbitrary means of cutting short the unpleasant
ness of a "bad date."
Underlying Assumptions
Superficially, all of these reasons seem some
what acceptable. But are they? And what underly
ing assumptions do they contain and what do
these assumptions imply about Stanford students?
Primarily,'they assume that a woman will not
or cannot be responsible for her own health, safety
and ability to handle unpleasant people; or situa
tions. Secondly, they imply that Stanford stu
dents either do not have the intelligence or do not
have the values to make responsible judgments
in their personal lives. Were this so, it would be
a curious commentary on Stanford's admissions
procedures, not to mention a refutation of the di
verse educational backgrounds which bring stu
dents to Stanford.
The "2:30 a.m. lock-out rule" and its companion
regulations serve notice to students thai they art
not responsible. Of freshmen, newly arrived at
Stanford, this might be said; of upperclassmen, it
should not be said.
Graded System
If a total discard of the social regulations is
not feasible because of freshmen, then a graded
system should be initiated that would restore in
creasing freedom of social movement to those who
have demonstrated their acceptance of responsi
bility. Given the primary purpose of a university
education — that of encouraging an informed in
dependence and responsibility the Stanford so
cial regulations for women are an unfortunate con
tradiction and impediment to the education
process.
A thoughtful consideration of social regulations
requires a simultaneous examination of the phil
osophy as well as the facts of university social
attitudes. Students are now making such an ex
amination.
The one conspicuous factor inevitably seen is
that of responsibility who shall have it and why?
In many areas the university acts in loco parentis,
in the place of parents this position arising, na
turally enough, from the desire of parents that
their sons and daughters be supervised while se
curing an education away from home.
Regulations A Barrier
But. if that education is to be a moral and
ethical one and truly "secured," it must be seated
within the individual. Students acknowledge the
need for some supervision in the educational proc
ess, but they will not allow the responsibility for
shaping their lives to be preempted by a system
of social regulations which superimposes "their"
values upon them.
They see their position in the university as that
of young adults, working through a period of
transition to a maturity that will help them be
responsible citizens. The existing social regulations
constitute a barrier to that maturity. As such they
are marked for extinction.

the kind that contribute to a "free society" when
the opportunity to do so is undermined by the
existence of an arbitrary system of values?
For, in fact, social regulations must presume
some values to be meaningful. If these are not
matured, student values, can they be accepted as
relevant to students? Students think not.
Social regulations tacitly assume that students
are either unable or unwilling lo control respon

sibily their own behavior. Student do not assume
this, and neither can a university whose primary
goal is the education of young men and women
to make their own intelligent decisions in all con
cerns ol their lives—including social concerns.
Internal Values
By and large, students believe that the values
necessary for responsible, autonomous behavior by
anyone must come from within that person and
not from some external authority. Consistent with
this point of view, they see the present social
regulations as symbols of distrust and suspicion.
For in telling women how to act, why and
where, these regulations imply that women are in
capable of independent and responsible action. But
acting alone is an integral part of adult life and
it seems that a university experience must do more
than "rehearse" one for such action. Perhaps a
specific criticism of the social regulations will be
helpful in illustrating this point.
The "2:30 a.m. lock-out rule" has received much
attention from students. In the past, deans, dormi
tory supervisors and some of the students them
selves have justified this regulation by saying
that it protects a woman's health, contributes to
her security and, less importantly, gives her an
arbitrary means of cutting short the unpleasant
ness of a "bad date."
Underlying Assumptions
Superficially, all of these reasons seem some
what acceptable. But are they? And what underly
ing assumptions do they contain and what do
these assumptions imply about Stanford students?
Primarily,'they assume that a woman will not
or cannot be responsible for her own health, safety
and ability to handle unpleasant people; or situa
tions. Secondly, they imply that Stanford stu
dents either do not have the intelligence or do not
have the values to make responsible judgments
in their personal lives. Were this so, it would be
a curious commentary on Stanford's admissions
procedures, not to mention a refutation of the di
verse educational backgrounds which bring stu
dents to Stanford.
The "2:30 a.m. lock-out rule" and its companion
regulations serve notice to students thai they art
not responsible. Of freshmen, newly arrived at
Stanford, this might be said; of upperclassmen, it
should not be said.
Graded System
If a total discard of the social regulations is
not feasible because of freshmen, then a graded
system should be initiated that would restore in
creasing freedom of social movement to those who
have demonstrated their acceptance of responsi
bility. Given the primary purpose of a university
education — that of encouraging an informed in
dependence and responsibility the Stanford so
cial regulations for women are an unfortunate con
tradiction and impediment to the education
process.
A thoughtful consideration of social regulations
requires a simultaneous examination of the phil
osophy as well as the facts of university social
attitudes. Students are now making such an ex
amination.
The one conspicuous factor inevitably seen is
that of responsibility who shall have it and why?
In many areas the university acts in loco parentis,
in the place of parents this position arising, na
turally enough, from the desire of parents that
their sons and daughters be supervised while se
curing an education away from home.
Regulations A Barrier
But. if that education is to be a moral and
ethical one and truly "secured," it must be seated
within the individual. Students acknowledge the
need for some supervision in the educational proc
ess, but they will not allow the responsibility for
shaping their lives to be preempted by a system
of social regulations which superimposes "their"
values upon them.
They see their position in the university as that
of young adults, working through a period of
transition to a maturity that will help them be
responsible citizens. The existing social regulations
constitute a barrier to that maturity. As such they
are marked for extinction.
Students at Stanford have seen women's social
regulations criticized periodically for a number
of years. Until this year critical concern has come
from a small segment of the student population.
Now, however, a sustained critique of the system
has taken form through the efforts of men and
women working as individuals and in groups.
The campus as a whole seems to have grasped
the basic contradiction of social regulation within
an educational environment engendered to instill
values. Students now are interested in restructur
ing the Stanford social milieu so that it reflects
student attitudes more accurately and positively
than in the past.
Relate To People
Students think that social regulations, if there
are to be any at all, must relate directly to the kind
of people they are, or hope to be through their
experience at Stanford. This thinking comes from
women and men, since both are affected by the
regulation of either group. To understand the
significance of this kind of thinking and the new
breed of Stanford student who originates it, one
should examine the motivations of the students
in the continuing social regulations controversy.
Most students experience, upon coming to col
lege, an unusual measure of independence they
never had before. All seem to relish this freedom
to choose, even if some are not as adept at man
aging it as others.
In short, students accept the greater freedom of
college life and acknowledge the added responsibil
ity that comes with it. Where they fail is in not
fully understanding and protecting their new free
dom to choose. Passively accepting a blanket
regulation of social life is one example of this
failure. When the university seeks to regulate
arbitrarily the social milieu, it is exercising a deci
sion-making power in "a matter of conscience."
This is not a legitimate prerogative of any educa
tional institution.
Invasion Of Privacy
In addition, the reporting and clerical functions
of Stanford social regulations clearly constitute
an invasion of privacy when women students are
empowered --- and, in fact, obligated to have
knowledge of others' personal lives. A number of
arguments can be mounted against this practice.
Before examining t ho logical arguments against
social regulations, however, a review of their ori
gins and development might be helpful.
Women's social regulations at Stanford are
made, interestingly enough, by the women (the
Social Regulations Committee of the Associated
Women Students) and approved by the Dean of
Women.
In recent years, the approved social regulations
have appeared in a booklet which outlines various
concerns—dress, etiquette, hours—in general, set
ting up the "do's" and "don'ts" of social life for
women on the campus. Until this year, the book
let was regarded as humorous, innocuous or, at
most, a nuisance. Now, however, thinking has
changed.
Regulation Accepted
Because students are regulated daily by rules
and procedures aimed at efficiency, safety, health
or some other consideration, they have accepted
regulation of their social lives as just another con
cession to the ideal of better living — up to now.
Today's Stanford students have struck upon the
not so profound idea that "arbitrary regulation"
and "value development" may be antithetical con
cepts within the university environment. Stanford
asks and assists students to acquire a liberal edu
cation "designed to produce a citizen worthy of a
free society and a free university." How, students
ask, can one form meaningful, durable values
the kind that contribute to a "free society" when
the opportunity to do so is undermined by the
existence of an arbitrary system of values?
For, in fact, social regulations must presume

in the place of parents this position arising, na
turally enough, from the desire of parents that
their sons and daughters be supervised while se
curing an education away from home.
Regulations A Barrier
But. if that education is to be a moral and
ethical one and truly "secured," it must be seated
within the individual. Students acknowledge the
need for some supervision in the educational proc
ess, but they will not allow the responsibility for
shaping their lives to be preempted by a system
of social regulations which superimposes "their"
values upon them.
They see their position in the university as that
of young adults, working through a period of
transition to a maturity that will help them be
responsible citizens. The existing social regulations
constitute a barrier to that maturity. As such they
are marked for extinction.
Students at Stanford have seen women's social
regulations criticized periodically for a number
of years. Until this year critical concern has come
from a small segment of the student population.
Now, however, a sustained critique of the system
has taken form through the efforts of men and
women working as individuals and in groups.
The campus as a whole seems to have grasped
the basic contradiction of social regulation within
an educational environment engendered to instill
values. Students now are interested in restructur
ing the Stanford social milieu so that it reflects
student attitudes more accurately and positively
than in the past.
Relate To People
Students think that social regulations, if there
are to be any at all, must relate directly to the kind
of people they are, or hope to be through their
experience at Stanford. This thinking comes from
women and men, since both are affected by the
regulation of either group. To understand the
significance of this kind of thinking and the new
breed of Stanford student who originates it, one
should examine the motivations of the students
in the continuing social regulations controversy.
Most students experience, upon coming to col
lege, an unusual measure of independence they
never had before. All seem to relish this freedom
to choose, even if some are not as adept at man
aging it as others.
In short, students accept the greater freedom of
college life and acknowledge the added responsibil
ity that comes with it. Where they fail is in not
fully understanding and protecting their new free
dom to choose. Passively accepting a blanket
regulation of social life is one example of this
failure. When the university seeks to regulate
arbitrarily the social milieu, it is exercising a deci
sion-making power in "a matter of conscience."
This is not a legitimate prerogative of any educa
tional institution.
Invasion Of Privacy
In addition, the reporting and clerical functions
of Stanford social regulations clearly constitute
an invasion of privacy when women students are
empowered --- and, in fact, obligated to have
knowledge of others' personal lives. A number of
arguments can be mounted against this practice.
Before examining t ho logical arguments against
social regulations, however, a review of their ori
gins and development might be helpful.
Women's social regulations at Stanford are
made, interestingly enough, by the women (the
Social Regulations Committee of the Associated
Women Students) and approved by the Dean of
Women.
In recent years, the approved social regulations
have appeared in a booklet which outlines various
concerns—dress, etiquette, hours—in general, set
ting up the "do's" and "don'ts" of social life for
women on the campus. Until this year, the book
let was regarded as humorous, innocuous or, at
most, a nuisance. Now, however, thinking has
changed.
Regulation Accepted
Because students are regulated daily by rules
and procedures aimed at efficiency, safety, health
or some other consideration, they have accepted
regulation of their social lives as just another con
cession to the ideal of better living — up to now.
Today's Stanford students have struck upon the
not so profound idea that "arbitrary regulation"
and "value development" may be antithetical con
cepts within the university environment. Stanford
asks and assists students to acquire a liberal edu
cation "designed to produce a citizen worthy of a
free society and a free university." How, students
ask, can one form meaningful, durable values
the kind that contribute to a "free society" when
the opportunity to do so is undermined by the
existence of an arbitrary system of values?
For, in fact, social regulations must presume
some values to be meaningful. If these are not
matured, student values, can they be accepted as
relevant to students? Students think not.
Social regulations tacitly assume that students
are either unable or unwilling lo control respon

sibily their own behavior. Student do not assume
this, and neither can a university whose primary
goal is the education of young men and women
to make their own intelligent decisions in all con
cerns ol their lives—including social concerns.
Internal Values
By and large, students believe that the values
necessary for responsible, autonomous behavior by
anyone must come from within that person and
not from some external authority. Consistent with
this point of view, they see the present social
regulations as symbols of distrust and suspicion.
For in telling women how to act, why and
where, these regulations imply that women are in
capable of independent and responsible action. But
acting alone is an integral part of adult life and
it seems that a university experience must do more
than "rehearse" one for such action. Perhaps a
specific criticism of the social regulations will be
helpful in illustrating this point.
The "2:30 a.m. lock-out rule" has received much
attention from students. In the past, deans, dormi
tory supervisors and some of the students them
selves have justified this regulation by saying
that it protects a woman's health, contributes to
her security and, less importantly, gives her an
arbitrary means of cutting short the unpleasant
ness of a "bad date."
Underlying Assumptions
Superficially, all of these reasons seem some
what acceptable. But are they? And what underly
ing assumptions do they contain and what do
these assumptions imply about Stanford students?
Primarily,'they assume that a woman will not
or cannot be responsible for her own health, safety
and ability to handle unpleasant people; or situa
tions. Secondly, they imply that Stanford stu
dents either do not have the intelligence or do not
have the values to make responsible judgments
in their personal lives. Were this so, it would be
a curious commentary on Stanford's admissions
procedures, not to mention a refutation of the di
verse educational backgrounds which bring stu
dents to Stanford.
The "2:30 a.m. lock-out rule" and its companion
regulations serve notice to students thai they art
not responsible. Of freshmen, newly arrived at
Stanford, this might be said; of upperclassmen, it
should not be said.
Graded System
If a total discard of the social regulations is
not feasible because of freshmen, then a graded
system should be initiated that would restore in
creasing freedom of social movement to those who
have demonstrated their acceptance of responsi
bility. Given the primary purpose of a university
education — that of encouraging an informed in
dependence and responsibility the Stanford so
cial regulations for women are an unfortunate con
tradiction and impediment to the education
process.
A thoughtful consideration of social regulations
requires a simultaneous examination of the phil
osophy as well as the facts of university social
attitudes. Students are now making such an ex
amination.
The one conspicuous factor inevitably seen is
that of responsibility who shall have it and why?

women on the campus. Until this year, the book
let was regarded as humorous, innocuous or, at
most, a nuisance. Now, however, thinking has
changed.
Regulation Accepted
Because students are regulated daily by rules
and procedures aimed at efficiency, safety, health
or some other consideration, they have accepted
regulation of their social lives as just another con
cession to the ideal of better living — up to now.
Today's Stanford students have struck upon the
not so profound idea that "arbitrary regulation"
and "value development" may be antithetical con
cepts within the university environment. Stanford
asks and assists students to acquire a liberal edu
cation "designed to produce a citizen worthy of a
free society and a free university." How, students
ask, can one form meaningful, durable values
the kind that contribute to a "free society" when
the opportunity to do so is undermined by the
existence of an arbitrary system of values?
For, in fact, social regulations must presume
some values to be meaningful. If these are not
matured, student values, can they be accepted as
relevant to students? Students think not.
Social regulations tacitly assume that students
are either unable or unwilling lo control respon

sibily their own behavior. Student do not assume
this, and neither can a university whose primary
goal is the education of young men and women
to make their own intelligent decisions in all con
cerns ol their lives—including social concerns.
Internal Values
By and large, students believe that the values
necessary for responsible, autonomous behavior by
anyone must come from within that person and
not from some external authority. Consistent with
this point of view, they see the present social
regulations as symbols of distrust and suspicion.
For in telling women how to act, why and
where, these regulations imply that women are in
capable of independent and responsible action. But
acting alone is an integral part of adult life and
it seems that a university experience must do more
than "rehearse" one for such action. Perhaps a
specific criticism of the social regulations will be
helpful in illustrating this point.
The "2:30 a.m. lock-out rule" has received much
attention from students. In the past, deans, dormi
tory supervisors and some of the students them
selves have justified this regulation by saying
that it protects a woman's health, contributes to
her security and, less importantly, gives her an
arbitrary means of cutting short the unpleasant
ness of a "bad date."
Underlying Assumptions
Superficially, all of these reasons seem some
what acceptable. But are they? And what underly
ing assumptions do they contain and what do
these assumptions imply about Stanford students?
Primarily,'they assume that a woman will not
or cannot be responsible for her own health, safety
and ability to handle unpleasant people; or situa
tions. Secondly, they imply that Stanford stu
dents either do not have the intelligence or do not
have the values to make responsible judgments
in their personal lives. Were this so, it would be
a curious commentary on Stanford's admissions
procedures, not to mention a refutation of the di
verse educational backgrounds which bring stu
dents to Stanford.
The "2:30 a.m. lock-out rule" and its companion
regulations serve notice to students thai they art
not responsible. Of freshmen, newly arrived at
Stanford, this might be said; of upperclassmen, it
should not be said.
Graded System
If a total discard of the social regulations is
not feasible because of freshmen, then a graded
system should be initiated that would restore in
creasing freedom of social movement to those who
have demonstrated their acceptance of responsi
bility. Given the primary purpose of a university
education — that of encouraging an informed in
dependence and responsibility the Stanford so
cial regulations for women are an unfortunate con
tradiction and impediment to the education
process.
A thoughtful consideration of social regulations
requires a simultaneous examination of the phil
osophy as well as the facts of university social
attitudes. Students are now making such an ex
amination.
The one conspicuous factor inevitably seen is
that of responsibility who shall have it and why?
In many areas the university acts in loco parentis,
in the place of parents this position arising, na
turally enough, from the desire of parents that
their sons and daughters be supervised while se
curing an education away from home.
Regulations A Barrier
But. if that education is to be a moral and
ethical one and truly "secured," it must be seated
within the individual. Students acknowledge the
need for some supervision in the educational proc
ess, but they will not allow the responsibility for
shaping their lives to be preempted by a system
of social regulations which superimposes "their"
values upon them.
They see their position in the university as that
of young adults, working through a period of
transition to a maturity that will help them be
responsible citizens. The existing social regulations
constitute a barrier to that maturity. As such they
are marked for extinction.
Students at Stanford have seen women's social
regulations criticized periodically for a number
of years. Until this year critical concern has come
from a small segment of the student population.
Now, however, a sustained critique of the system
has taken form through the efforts of men and
women working as individuals and in groups.
The campus as a whole seems to have grasped
the basic contradiction of social regulation within
an educational environment engendered to instill
values. Students now are interested in restructur
ing the Stanford social milieu so that it reflects
student attitudes more accurately and positively
than in the past.
Relate To People
Students think that social regulations, if there
are to be any at all, must relate directly to the kind
of people they are, or hope to be through their
experience at Stanford. This thinking comes from
women and men, since both are affected by the
regulation of either group. To understand the
significance of this kind of thinking and the new
breed of Stanford student who originates it, one
should examine the motivations of the students
in the continuing social regulations controversy.
Most students experience, upon coming to col
lege, an unusual measure of independence they
never had before. All seem to relish this freedom
to choose, even if some are not as adept at man
aging it as others.
In short, students accept the greater freedom of
college life and acknowledge the added responsibil
ity that comes with it. Where they fail is in not
fully understanding and protecting their new free
dom to choose. Passively accepting a blanket
regulation of social life is one example of this
failure. When the university seeks to regulate
arbitrarily the social milieu, it is exercising a deci
sion-making power in "a matter of conscience."
This is not a legitimate prerogative of any educa
tional institution.
Invasion Of Privacy
In addition, the reporting and clerical functions
of Stanford social regulations clearly constitute
an invasion of privacy when women students are
empowered --- and, in fact, obligated to have
knowledge of others' personal lives. A number of
arguments can be mounted against this practice.
Before examining t ho logical arguments against
social regulations, however, a review of their ori
gins and development might be helpful.
Women's social regulations at Stanford are
made, interestingly enough, by the women (the
Social Regulations Committee of the Associated
Women Students) and approved by the Dean of
Women.
In recent years, the approved social regulations
have appeared in a booklet which outlines various
concerns—dress, etiquette, hours—in general, set
ting up the "do's" and "don'ts" of social life for
women on the campus. Until this year, the book
let was regarded as humorous, innocuous or, at
most, a nuisance. Now, however, thinking has
changed.
