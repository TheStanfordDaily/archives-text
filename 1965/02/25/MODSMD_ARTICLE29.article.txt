## LASSU Overlooks Value Of Fundamental Standard 
### 
j Editor, The Daily:
The current effort to drop the
j Fundamental Standard by legisla-
I tive fiat has had fairly easy sleri
j ding through a liberal-controlled
i LASSU up until now. As a result,
nothing has served to bring the
legislature or the Daily or the
general student body into a basic
discussion of the possible desir
ability of a "fundamental stan
dard" as opposed to student appli
cation of a segment of the state
and municipal codes.
There seem to be three sources
for the dissatisfaction mirrored
in LASSU.
First, there is a startling lack
of awareness in the student body
, that the Fundamental Standard
as applied by the stulen' iudici
ary is common law or piece lent
law and is not an arbitrary appli
cation of vague wordings.
Secondly, there is a lack of defi
nition of, and adherence to due
processes and common law on
the part of administration claim
ing to a •' in loco parentis.
Thirdly, university regulations
are imposed noon the student judi
ciary. such :i 'hose dealing with
'•exual inte ours-' an ' social con
duct. which are deemed by th e
students to be contradictory to
the intentions of the Fundamental
Standard. Although none of these
1 problems is very open to glib and
sweeping answers, they are cer
tainly areas for effective, con
structive legislative action. Wo
seem instead determined to kill
the patient in order to eradicate
the cancer.

• Noble Truth?
Editor, The Daily:
Probably I am naive or stupid
I or both, but I do not understand
the precedent thai has been estab
lished with Dean Allen's resigna
tion. Perhaps you can clarify the
j meaning of the event and tell me
jthe great moral which must have
1 emerged.
How do Miss Crow and Mr. Hal
! verson differ from the young
women in M. L. Starkey's The
Devil in .Massachusetts? Has free
dom of opinion and expression
; been defended by denying it or
requiring that it be truth? Has
| a blow been struck for tolerance
| through intolerence? Has wisdom
i been established as a criterion for
i participation in a university?
In failing to see the noble truth
j in this affair, it is probable that
I am short-sighted. I consider the
sins attributed to Dean Allen
indiscretion, imperfection, intol
arence, etc. and, as I am a hu
man animal. I find I also possess

| those qualities. Is it now estuh-1
lished that only perfect men can'
! administer a university?
Where is the next application of
"trial by controversy" to be? Can
we now report a professor's ex
pression of views unpopular with
his students to President Ster
ling? Can a student be held ae-;
countable under ihe honor code
for gossip-like behavior? Are we
all to be constantly alert and on
j guard against foolish behavior so
we can report it to The Daily?
I feel 1 ought to know, before
I am embarrassed at registration,
if being "right" and 'wise'' arej
now criteria for participation in
this university.
Thank you for your expected
advice.

• Parent Questioned
Editor, The 'Daily:
1 believe that in her recent 1
letter to The Daily, criticizing so
cial regulations and defending the
English Department, a Stanford
parent has failed to consider two
very important things.
The first is that high intelli- ;
gcnce and diligent study habits;
do not necessarily imply maturity
and responsibility. The former |
attributes may gain for one ad-j
mission to Stanford as a graduate
student or as an undergraduate
student. But they do not trans-!
form one into a responsible j
teaching assistant or a respon
sible undergraduate. Responsibil-,
ity stems primarily from many |
I other sources.
Secondly, I too, resent the i
| shadows cast on the English De
! partment. However, a faculty in
vestigating committee has found
I that these shadows were not cast ;
j by an administrator. If not from j
an administrator, then from:
| whence did these shadows arise?!
ils it possible that a student re- i
port printed in The Daily, intend
ing to be helpful and to do good,,
has, due to unfounded statements,
I caused only destruction and de
| famation ?
I think ii wise to consider these,
two ideas in present and future j
j discussions of campus issues.

The current effort to drop the
j Fundamental Standard by legisla-
I tive fiat has had fairly easy sleri
j ding through a liberal-controlled
i LASSU up until now. As a result,
nothing has served to bring the
legislature or the Daily or the
general student body into a basic
discussion of the possible desir
ability of a "fundamental stan
dard" as opposed to student appli
cation of a segment of the state
and municipal codes.
There seem to be three sources
for the dissatisfaction mirrored
in LASSU.
First, there is a startling lack
of awareness in the student body
, that the Fundamental Standard
as applied by the stulen' iudici
ary is common law or piece lent
law and is not an arbitrary appli
cation of vague wordings.
Secondly, there is a lack of defi
nition of, and adherence to due
processes and common law on
the part of administration claim
ing to a •' in loco parentis.
Thirdly, university regulations
are imposed noon the student judi
ciary. such :i 'hose dealing with
'•exual inte ours-' an ' social con
duct. which are deemed by th e
students to be contradictory to
the intentions of the Fundamental
Standard. Although none of these
1 problems is very open to glib and
sweeping answers, they are cer
tainly areas for effective, con
structive legislative action. Wo
seem instead determined to kill
the patient in order to eradicate

Editor, The Daily:
Probably I am naive or stupid
I or both, but I do not understand
the precedent thai has been estab

How do Miss Crow and Mr. Hal

women in M. L. Starkey's The

In failing to see the noble truth

indiscretion, imperfection, intol

Where is the next application of

sible undergraduate. Responsibil-,
ity stems primarily from many |
I other sources.
Secondly, I too, resent the i

DEANNE M. WILSON
j Editor, The Daily:
The current effort to drop the
j Fundamental Standard by legisla-
I tive fiat has had fairly easy sleri
j ding through a liberal-controlled
i LASSU up until now. As a result,
nothing has served to bring the
legislature or the Daily or the
general student body into a basic
discussion of the possible desir
ability of a "fundamental stan
dard" as opposed to student appli
cation of a segment of the state
and municipal codes.
There seem to be three sources
for the dissatisfaction mirrored
in LASSU.
First, there is a startling lack
of awareness in the student body
, that the Fundamental Standard
as applied by the stulen' iudici
ary is common law or piece lent
law and is not an arbitrary appli
cation of vague wordings.
Secondly, there is a lack of defi
nition of, and adherence to due
processes and common law on
the part of administration claim
ing to a •' in loco parentis.
Thirdly, university regulations
are imposed noon the student judi
ciary. such :i 'hose dealing with
'•exual inte ours-' an ' social con
duct. which are deemed by th e
students to be contradictory to
the intentions of the Fundamental
Standard. Although none of these
1 problems is very open to glib and
sweeping answers, they are cer
tainly areas for effective, con
structive legislative action. Wo
seem instead determined to kill
the patient in order to eradicate
the cancer.

• Noble Truth?
Editor, The Daily:
Probably I am naive or stupid
I or both, but I do not understand
the precedent thai has been estab
lished with Dean Allen's resigna
tion. Perhaps you can clarify the
j meaning of the event and tell me
jthe great moral which must have
1 emerged.
How do Miss Crow and Mr. Hal
! verson differ from the young
women in M. L. Starkey's The
Devil in .Massachusetts? Has free
dom of opinion and expression
; been defended by denying it or
requiring that it be truth? Has
| a blow been struck for tolerance
| through intolerence? Has wisdom
i been established as a criterion for
i participation in a university?
In failing to see the noble truth
j in this affair, it is probable that
I am short-sighted. I consider the
sins attributed to Dean Allen
indiscretion, imperfection, intol
arence, etc. and, as I am a hu
man animal. I find I also possess

| those qualities. Is it now estuh-1
lished that only perfect men can'
! administer a university?
Where is the next application of
"trial by controversy" to be? Can
we now report a professor's ex
pression of views unpopular with
his students to President Ster
ling? Can a student be held ae-;
countable under ihe honor code
for gossip-like behavior? Are we
all to be constantly alert and on
j guard against foolish behavior so
we can report it to The Daily?
I feel 1 ought to know, before
I am embarrassed at registration,
if being "right" and 'wise'' arej
now criteria for participation in
this university.
Thank you for your expected
advice.

• Parent Questioned
Editor, The 'Daily:
1 believe that in her recent 1
letter to The Daily, criticizing so
cial regulations and defending the
English Department, a Stanford
parent has failed to consider two
very important things.
The first is that high intelli- ;
gcnce and diligent study habits;
do not necessarily imply maturity
and responsibility. The former |
attributes may gain for one ad-j
mission to Stanford as a graduate
student or as an undergraduate
student. But they do not trans-!
form one into a responsible j
teaching assistant or a respon
sible undergraduate. Responsibil-,
ity stems primarily from many |
I other sources.
Secondly, I too, resent the i
| shadows cast on the English De
! partment. However, a faculty in
vestigating committee has found
I that these shadows were not cast ;
j by an administrator. If not from j
an administrator, then from:
| whence did these shadows arise?!
ils it possible that a student re- i
port printed in The Daily, intend
ing to be helpful and to do good,,
has, due to unfounded statements,
I caused only destruction and de
| famation ?
I think ii wise to consider these,
two ideas in present and future j
j discussions of campus issues.
