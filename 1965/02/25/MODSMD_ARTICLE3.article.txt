# THE 'CHALLENGER'
## For The Compleat Activist 
### STEVE LEOPOLD JON ROISE Associate Editors 
The recently-issued Stanford
Challenger, it skeins, is in
flicted with the Moses Syn
drome — a desire to lead the
bewildered Stanford student
out of the hot sands of aliena
tion-prone Inner Quad and
into the pleasant oasis of so
cial activism.
From an introductory edi
tors' note discussing the "per
verted value system of . . .
malevolent administrators" to
an article on civil disobedience,
the magazine assumes th e
premise of activism, and then
proceeds to argue fine details
for (50 pages.
And so it is that the reader,
unless lie happens to l>c a stu
dent activist, will go away mi

convinced, perhaps w i th a
stronger feeling of alienation
toward the Challenger than to
ward The Nasty University.
In what is no doubt the best
article of the magazine. Prof.
Christian Bay of the Depart
ment of Political Science pro
motes "Education for Free
dom" in opposition to the phil
osophy that education is a proc
ess of preparing the student
for his place in society.
Bay sees as a basic difficulty
of current education "the per
verse and yet all-pervasive idea
that people should l>e shaped
for the jobs available, rather
than the other way around."
The best education, Bay
states, is the one which "does
the most good in terms of pro
moting every individual's capa
city to defend his freedom in

the fullest sense." Individual
freedom b« iconics for him the
chief aim of education.
This freedom, as defined by
Bay, has three components. It
is psychological, meaning that
the individual understands his
own motives; it is social, mean
ing that the individual has the
opportunity to make a choice
without the constraints of so
ciety; and it is autonomous,
meaning that the individual is
aware of the variety of alter
native choices open to him.
An article by James Sattler,
a graduate student doing re
search at the Hoover Institu
tion who is called by one GCC
insider "a member of the radi
cal wing of the organization,"
discusses the long-range goals
of the graduate group in an
article titled "Stanford — Tin*

GCC and the Communitarian
University."
Sattler sees the current con
flict as one between what he
calls the Establishment, a ii d
those people living in an intel
lectual a n d social isolation
which he calls "the inner
ghetto."
The former group, he says, is
comprised of "the authoritar
ian lilieral corporation-univer
sity complex; the administra
tors of external improvement
[e.g., slogans and statistics
about excellence ami Ph.D. ra
tios, PACE]."
The latter, lie says, is a new
class of students, "communi
tarians" —"people who are the
conscious proletariat of the
American New Left."
Sattler states that the "noil-
Establishinentarians," presum

ably including the GCC, wish
nothing less than a complete
transformation of the Univer
sity into a communitarian so
ciety.
lie concludes, in a manner
that is more assertive than ra
tional, that even though there
are "good guys" on both sides
(an admission that is out of
tone with tin* rest of the ar
ticle), coexistence between the
two groups is impossible.
It isn't hard to guess which
side he thinks must go.
A somewhat more palatable
approach — though similar and
more inclusive — is made by
Henry Anderson in his "War
on Alienation."
Anderson asserts that the
"War <>n Poverty" is not really
an answer to the need for so-
