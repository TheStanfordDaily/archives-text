# THE 						'CHALLENGER'
## For The Compleat Activist 
### STEVE LEOPOLD JON ROISE Associate Editors 
The recently-issued Stanford
Challenger, it skeins, is in
flicted with the Moses Syn
drome — a desire to lead the
bewildered Stanford student
out of the hot sands of aliena
tion-prone Inner Quad and
into the pleasant oasis of so
cial activism.
From an introductory edi
tors' note discussing the "per
verted value system of . . .
malevolent administrators" to
an article on civil disobedience,
the magazine assumes th e
premise of activism, and then
proceeds to argue fine details
for (50 pages.
And so it is that the reader,
unless lie happens to l>c a stu
dent activist, will go away mi

convinced, perhaps w i th a
stronger feeling of alienation
toward the Challenger than to
ward The Nasty University.
In what is no doubt the best
article of the magazine. Prof.
Christian Bay of the Depart
ment of Political Science pro
motes "Education for Free
dom" in opposition to the phil
osophy that education is a proc
ess of preparing the student
for his place in society.
Bay sees as a basic difficulty
of current education "the per
verse and yet all-pervasive idea
that people should l>e shaped
for the jobs available, rather
than the other way around."
The best education, Bay
states, is the one which "does
the most good in terms of pro
moting every individual's capa
city to defend his freedom in

the fullest sense." Individual
freedom b« iconics for him the
chief aim of education.
This freedom, as defined by
Bay, has three components. It
is psychological, meaning that
the individual understands his
own motives; it is social, mean
ing that the individual has the
opportunity to make a choice
without the constraints of so
ciety; and it is autonomous,
meaning that the individual is
aware of the variety of alter
native choices open to him.
An article by James Sattler,
a graduate student doing re
search at the Hoover Institu
tion who is called by one GCC
insider "a member of the radi
cal wing of the organization,"
discusses the long-range goals
of the graduate group in an
article titled "Stanford — Tin*

GCC and the Communitarian
University."
Sattler sees the current con
flict as one between what he
calls the Establishment, a ii d
those people living in an intel
lectual a n d social isolation
which he calls "the inner
ghetto."
The former group, he says, is
comprised of "the authoritar
ian lilieral corporation-univer
sity complex; the administra
tors of external improvement
[e.g., slogans and statistics
about excellence ami Ph.D. ra
tios, PACE]."
The latter, lie says, is a new
class of students, "communi
tarians" —"people who are the
conscious proletariat of the
American New Left."
Sattler states that the "noil-
Establishinentarians," presum

ably including the GCC, wish
nothing less than a complete
transformation of the Univer
sity into a communitarian so
ciety.
lie concludes, in a manner
that is more assertive than ra
tional, that even though there
are "good guys" on both sides
(an admission that is out of
tone with tin* rest of the ar
ticle), coexistence between the
two groups is impossible.
It isn't hard to guess which
side he thinks must go.
A somewhat more palatable
approach — though similar and
more inclusive — is made by
Henry Anderson in his "War
on Alienation."
Anderson asserts that the
"War <>n Poverty" is not really
an answer to the need for so-
cial change. Since he feels strongly
too strongly, perhaps — about men's
plight in the "very dungeon in which
most of us languish," he advocates an
increase in what he terms "face-to-face
associations."
These associations will be voluntary,
apolitical and relatively cheap. They will
be the basic social units in his "com
munitarian" society — a Utopia staffed
by dedicated social activists, not social
workers.
In these two articles, then, one sees
the worst symptoms of the Moses Syn
drome — overwrought analysis and a
penchant for phrasemongering.
One of the better articles of the issue
is a caustic commentary by co-editor R.
V. Denenberg, "The Loneliness of the
Long-Distance Agitator," which dis
cusses with a good deal of insight the
institutionalization of civil disobedience
in the American society.
Denenberg presents the theory that
the acceptance of such disobedience is
a result of demonstrators pledging "not
to be Nasty" by not extending th e i r
pleas for public sympathy into hin
drances annoying to society.
However, says Denenberg, "By agree

ing not to be disagreeable . . . civil dis
obedience abandoned what is potentially
its greatest weapon, for the ultimate
strength of the technique is that where
sympathy fails to follow a demonstra
tion of grievance, simple desire to get
rid of the hindrance may effect amelio
ration of the complaint."
DEN EN BERG'S ARGUMENT grows
weak, however, when he attempts to
convince his public that civil disobedi
ence with the pure purpose of disrup
tion is an effective method of gaining
an end. He asserts, but fails to explain,
how it is that such a demonstration of
"Nastiness" leads those annoyed by it
to work for the demonstrating group's
ends, rather than the elimination of the
group itself.
Completing the excellent duet on the
civil rights movement is Luke Rabat's
"Notes From the County Jail."
Admittedly Kafkaesque in parts, this
diary is also remarkably human in
others. Young Negro girls get sick of
drinking Cokes after integrating three
restaurants; one integrationist has his
ardor temporarily inflamed by an ex
cess of hot pepper on his hamburgers
at the Chick'n Treat.
VET THE STORY is primarily one of
horror. And although the author is
sometimes overwrought, one concludes
that he has reason to be.

For the scene is Meridian, Mississippi,
home of the 21 men accused of killing
Chancy, Schwerner and Goodman, and
the time is proximate. Kabat can thus
be forgiven his excesses; Riven the
situation they are undoubtedly all too
true.
No liberal campus magazine would be
complete without some commentary on
the ideological parents of the student
rebellion at Berkeley—the Free Speech
Movement. Thus, there are two articles;
both are uneven.
MADEEON BERKOWITZ' "Commen
tary on the Commentaries" is best when
it criticizes some of the more inane
interpretations of the Berkeley revolt,
such as Prof. Lewis Feuer's abject
analysis of the University as a magnet
for the "morally corrupt, intellectual
lumpen proletariats, lumpen beatniks,
lumpen agitators" who "wend their way
to the university campus to advocate a
melange of narcotics, sexual perver
sion, collegiate Castroism and campus
Maoism."
Mrs. Berkowitz, a graduate student
in history, quite aptly terms this "color
ful name calling," and then proceeds to
apply the brush herself. The critics -
such as Feuer and Sidney Hook — are
"middle-aged liberals;" the Trustees and
Board of Regents for large universities
represent "industrial interests . . . more

concerned about perpetuating them
selves than improving liberal educa
tion;" and the American student, to
use Paul Goodman's observation, is
today's "major exploited class."
However, when the author refrains
from advocacy, her analysis of what
the problems were — and are — make
the effort quite valuable.
THE AYVAKI) for pedantry goes to
Edward Epstein for his minute-by-min
ute and witness-by-witness account of
"Who Killed Tippit:—and Why?"
Epstein's thesis, complete with "third
men" and "fifth bullets," is only an
other variation on the recurring theme
of absolute innocence until guilt is
proven beyond all doubt, not all rea
sonable doubt, that some have used con
tinually in considering the Kennedy
Assassination and the Warren Report.
The author scores the Commission
for having "conspicuously avoided pur
suing any lines which may have sug
gested Tippit's involvement with Os
wald" and for ignoring "rumors t hat
Tippit knew Ruby."
The inference, then, is that the "au
thoritarian liberals" mentioned else
where in the magazine in this article
embodied by Warren, McCone, Russell,
et al have failed to render justice, and,
more importantly, they did so on pur
pose.

Likewise, Professor J. R. Seeley's let -
tor to Berkeley Chancellor Martin
Meyerson ranges from profundity to
sophistry with relative ease.
ON ONK HANI), there is a brief and
illuminating analysis of administra
tive power in universities "it is no)
oven given power, but seized power,
Hobbesian power, power ceded lest
worse befall, power without consensus
or consent. ... It can budget and con
tain. It cannot create. It cannot lead."
But then comes the overstatement
"I'm not sure there is a University
worthy of the name left"—and the tor
tured imagery — "Emancipation is
something that, taken in too small bits,
turns to dead sea fruit and ashes in
the mouth."
The magazine as a whole, in spite of
(or perhaps partly because of > its radi
cal slant, is well written and well worth
reading—in fact, essential reading for
anyone wishing to understand the
forces that effect a university as it
quavers on the edge of greatness.
The Challenger may never develop
into the Great Magazine envisioned in
the editors' note, but, for a first effort,
it is noteworthy and interesting, and
will serve as a fine memento for cam
pus sentimentalists of what the San
Francisco newspapers call "The Great
Student Revolt."

lectual a n d social isolation
which he calls "the inner
ghetto."
The former group, he says, is
comprised of "the authoritar
ian lilieral corporation-univer
sity complex; the administra
tors of external improvement
[e.g., slogans and statistics
about excellence ami Ph.D. ra
tios, PACE]."
The latter, lie says, is a new
class of students, "communi
tarians" —"people who are the
conscious proletariat of the
American New Left."
Sattler states that the "noil-
Establishinentarians," presum

ably including the GCC, wish
nothing less than a complete
transformation of the Univer
sity into a communitarian so
ciety.
lie concludes, in a manner
that is more assertive than ra
tional, that even though there
are "good guys" on both sides
(an admission that is out of
tone with tin* rest of the ar
ticle), coexistence between the
two groups is impossible.
It isn't hard to guess which
side he thinks must go.
A somewhat more palatable
approach — though similar and
more inclusive — is made by
Henry Anderson in his "War
on Alienation."
Anderson asserts that the
"War <>n Poverty" is not really
an answer to the need for so-
cial change. Since he feels strongly
too strongly, perhaps — about men's
plight in the "very dungeon in which
most of us languish," he advocates an
increase in what he terms "face-to-face
associations."
These associations will be voluntary,
apolitical and relatively cheap. They will
be the basic social units in his "com
munitarian" society — a Utopia staffed
by dedicated social activists, not social
workers.
In these two articles, then, one sees
the worst symptoms of the Moses Syn
drome — overwrought analysis and a
penchant for phrasemongering.
One of the better articles of the issue
is a caustic commentary by co-editor R.
V. Denenberg, "The Loneliness of the
Long-Distance Agitator," which dis
cusses with a good deal of insight the
institutionalization of civil disobedience
in the American society.
Denenberg presents the theory that
the acceptance of such disobedience is
a result of demonstrators pledging "not
to be Nasty" by not extending th e i r
pleas for public sympathy into hin
drances annoying to society.
However, says Denenberg, "By agree

ing not to be disagreeable . . . civil dis
obedience abandoned what is potentially
its greatest weapon, for the ultimate
strength of the technique is that where
sympathy fails to follow a demonstra
tion of grievance, simple desire to get
rid of the hindrance may effect amelio
ration of the complaint."
DEN EN BERG'S ARGUMENT grows
weak, however, when he attempts to
convince his public that civil disobedi
ence with the pure purpose of disrup
tion is an effective method of gaining
an end. He asserts, but fails to explain,
how it is that such a demonstration of
"Nastiness" leads those annoyed by it
to work for the demonstrating group's
ends, rather than the elimination of the
group itself.
Completing the excellent duet on the
civil rights movement is Luke Rabat's
"Notes From the County Jail."
Admittedly Kafkaesque in parts, this
diary is also remarkably human in
others. Young Negro girls get sick of
drinking Cokes after integrating three
restaurants; one integrationist has his
ardor temporarily inflamed by an ex
cess of hot pepper on his hamburgers
at the Chick'n Treat.
VET THE STORY is primarily one of
horror. And although the author is
sometimes overwrought, one concludes
that he has reason to be.

For the scene is Meridian, Mississippi,
home of the 21 men accused of killing
Chancy, Schwerner and Goodman, and
the time is proximate. Kabat can thus
be forgiven his excesses; Riven the
situation they are undoubtedly all too
true.
No liberal campus magazine would be
complete without some commentary on
the ideological parents of the student
rebellion at Berkeley—the Free Speech
Movement. Thus, there are two articles;
both are uneven.
MADEEON BERKOWITZ' "Commen
tary on the Commentaries" is best when
it criticizes some of the more inane
interpretations of the Berkeley revolt,
such as Prof. Lewis Feuer's abject
analysis of the University as a magnet
for the "morally corrupt, intellectual
lumpen proletariats, lumpen beatniks,
lumpen agitators" who "wend their way
to the university campus to advocate a
melange of narcotics, sexual perver
sion, collegiate Castroism and campus
Maoism."
Mrs. Berkowitz, a graduate student
in history, quite aptly terms this "color
ful name calling," and then proceeds to
apply the brush herself. The critics -
such as Feuer and Sidney Hook — are
"middle-aged liberals;" the Trustees and
Board of Regents for large universities
represent "industrial interests . . . more

concerned about perpetuating them
selves than improving liberal educa
tion;" and the American student, to
use Paul Goodman's observation, is
today's "major exploited class."
However, when the author refrains
from advocacy, her analysis of what
the problems were — and are — make
the effort quite valuable.
THE AYVAKI) for pedantry goes to
Edward Epstein for his minute-by-min
ute and witness-by-witness account of
"Who Killed Tippit:—and Why?"
Epstein's thesis, complete with "third
men" and "fifth bullets," is only an
other variation on the recurring theme
of absolute innocence until guilt is
proven beyond all doubt, not all rea
sonable doubt, that some have used con
tinually in considering the Kennedy
Assassination and the Warren Report.
The author scores the Commission
for having "conspicuously avoided pur
suing any lines which may have sug
gested Tippit's involvement with Os
wald" and for ignoring "rumors t hat
Tippit knew Ruby."
The inference, then, is that the "au
thoritarian liberals" mentioned else
where in the magazine in this article
embodied by Warren, McCone, Russell,
et al have failed to render justice, and,
more importantly, they did so on pur
pose.

Likewise, Professor J. R. Seeley's let -
tor to Berkeley Chancellor Martin
Meyerson ranges from profundity to
sophistry with relative ease.
ON ONK HANI), there is a brief and
illuminating analysis of administra
tive power in universities "it is no)
oven given power, but seized power,
Hobbesian power, power ceded lest
worse befall, power without consensus
or consent. ... It can budget and con
tain. It cannot create. It cannot lead."
But then comes the overstatement
"I'm not sure there is a University
worthy of the name left"—and the tor
tured imagery — "Emancipation is
something that, taken in too small bits,
turns to dead sea fruit and ashes in
the mouth."
The magazine as a whole, in spite of
(or perhaps partly because of > its radi
cal slant, is well written and well worth
reading—in fact, essential reading for
anyone wishing to understand the
forces that effect a university as it
quavers on the edge of greatness.
The Challenger may never develop
into the Great Magazine envisioned in
the editors' note, but, for a first effort,
it is noteworthy and interesting, and
will serve as a fine memento for cam
pus sentimentalists of what the San
Francisco newspapers call "The Great
Student Revolt."
The recently-issued Stanford
Challenger, it skeins, is in
flicted with the Moses Syn
drome — a desire to lead the
bewildered Stanford student
out of the hot sands of aliena
tion-prone Inner Quad and
into the pleasant oasis of so
cial activism.
From an introductory edi
tors' note discussing the "per
verted value system of . . .
malevolent administrators" to
an article on civil disobedience,
the magazine assumes th e
premise of activism, and then
proceeds to argue fine details
for (50 pages.
And so it is that the reader,
unless lie happens to l>c a stu
dent activist, will go away mi

convinced, perhaps w i th a
stronger feeling of alienation
toward the Challenger than to
ward The Nasty University.
In what is no doubt the best
article of the magazine. Prof.
Christian Bay of the Depart
ment of Political Science pro
motes "Education for Free
dom" in opposition to the phil
osophy that education is a proc
ess of preparing the student
for his place in society.
Bay sees as a basic difficulty
of current education "the per
verse and yet all-pervasive idea
that people should l>e shaped
for the jobs available, rather
than the other way around."
The best education, Bay
states, is the one which "does
the most good in terms of pro
moting every individual's capa
city to defend his freedom in

the fullest sense." Individual
freedom b« iconics for him the
chief aim of education.
This freedom, as defined by
Bay, has three components. It
is psychological, meaning that
the individual understands his
own motives; it is social, mean
ing that the individual has the
opportunity to make a choice
without the constraints of so
ciety; and it is autonomous,
meaning that the individual is
aware of the variety of alter
native choices open to him.
An article by James Sattler,
a graduate student doing re
search at the Hoover Institu
tion who is called by one GCC
insider "a member of the radi
cal wing of the organization,"
discusses the long-range goals
of the graduate group in an
article titled "Stanford — Tin*

GCC and the Communitarian
University."

flict as one between what he

No liberal campus magazine would be

MADEEON BERKOWITZ' "Commen

analysis of the University as a magnet
for the "morally corrupt, intellectual
lumpen proletariats, lumpen beatniks,
lumpen agitators" who "wend their way
to the university campus to advocate a
melange of narcotics, sexual perver

Maoism."
Mrs. Berkowitz, a graduate student
in history, quite aptly terms this "color
ful name calling," and then proceeds to
apply the brush herself. The critics -
such as Feuer and Sidney Hook — are
"middle-aged liberals;" the Trustees and
Board of Regents for large universities
represent "industrial interests . . . more

concerned about perpetuating them
selves than improving liberal educa
tion;" and the American student, to
use Paul Goodman's observation, is
today's "major exploited class."
However, when the author refrains
from advocacy, her analysis of what
the problems were — and are — make
the effort quite valuable.
THE AYVAKI) for pedantry goes to
Edward Epstein for his minute-by-min

"Who Killed Tippit:—and Why?"
Epstein's thesis, complete with "third

other variation on the recurring theme
of absolute innocence until guilt is
proven beyond all doubt, not all rea
sonable doubt, that some have used con

Assassination and the Warren Report.
The author scores the Commission

The recently-issued Stanford
Challenger, it skeins, is in
flicted with the Moses Syn
drome — a desire to lead the
bewildered Stanford student
out of the hot sands of aliena
tion-prone Inner Quad and
into the pleasant oasis of so
cial activism.
From an introductory edi
tors' note discussing the "per
verted value system of . . .
malevolent administrators" to
an article on civil disobedience,
the magazine assumes th e
premise of activism, and then
proceeds to argue fine details
for (50 pages.

dent activist, will go away mi

convinced, perhaps w i th a
stronger feeling of alienation
toward the Challenger than to

In what is no doubt the best
article of the magazine. Prof.
Christian Bay of the Depart
ment of Political Science pro
motes "Education for Free
dom" in opposition to the phil
osophy that education is a proc
ess of preparing the student
for his place in society.
Bay sees as a basic difficulty
of current education "the per
verse and yet all-pervasive idea
that people should l>e shaped
for the jobs available, rather
than the other way around."
The best education, Bay
states, is the one which "does
the most good in terms of pro
moting every individual's capa
city to defend his freedom in

the fullest sense." Individual
freedom b« iconics for him the
chief aim of education.
This freedom, as defined by
Bay, has three components. It
is psychological, meaning that
the individual understands his
own motives; it is social, mean
ing that the individual has the
opportunity to make a choice
without the constraints of so
ciety; and it is autonomous,
meaning that the individual is
aware of the variety of alter
native choices open to him.
An article by James Sattler,
a graduate student doing re
search at the Hoover Institu
tion who is called by one GCC
insider "a member of the radi
cal wing of the organization,"
discusses the long-range goals
of the graduate group in an
article titled "Stanford — Tin*

GCC and the Communitarian
University."
Sattler sees the current con
flict as one between what he
calls the Establishment, a ii d
those people living in an intel
lectual a n d social isolation
which he calls "the inner
ghetto."
The former group, he says, is
comprised of "the authoritar
ian lilieral corporation-univer
sity complex; the administra
tors of external improvement
[e.g., slogans and statistics
about excellence ami Ph.D. ra
tios, PACE]."
The latter, lie says, is a new
class of students, "communi
tarians" —"people who are the
conscious proletariat of the
American New Left."
Sattler states that the "noil-
Establishinentarians," presum

ably including the GCC, wish
nothing less than a complete
transformation of the Univer
sity into a communitarian so
ciety.
lie concludes, in a manner
that is more assertive than ra
tional, that even though there
are "good guys" on both sides
(an admission that is out of
tone with tin* rest of the ar
ticle), coexistence between the
two groups is impossible.
It isn't hard to guess which
side he thinks must go.
A somewhat more palatable
approach — though similar and
more inclusive — is made by
Henry Anderson in his "War
on Alienation."
Anderson asserts that the
"War <>n Poverty" is not really
an answer to the need for so-
cial change. Since he feels strongly
too strongly, perhaps — about men's
plight in the "very dungeon in which
most of us languish," he advocates an
increase in what he terms "face-to-face
associations."
These associations will be voluntary,
apolitical and relatively cheap. They will
be the basic social units in his "com
munitarian" society — a Utopia staffed
by dedicated social activists, not social
workers.
In these two articles, then, one sees
the worst symptoms of the Moses Syn
drome — overwrought analysis and a
penchant for phrasemongering.
One of the better articles of the issue
is a caustic commentary by co-editor R.
V. Denenberg, "The Loneliness of the
Long-Distance Agitator," which dis
cusses with a good deal of insight the
institutionalization of civil disobedience
in the American society.
Denenberg presents the theory that
the acceptance of such disobedience is
a result of demonstrators pledging "not
to be Nasty" by not extending th e i r
pleas for public sympathy into hin
drances annoying to society.
However, says Denenberg, "By agree

ing not to be disagreeable . . . civil dis
obedience abandoned what is potentially
its greatest weapon, for the ultimate
strength of the technique is that where
sympathy fails to follow a demonstra
tion of grievance, simple desire to get
rid of the hindrance may effect amelio

Epstein's thesis, complete with "third

The Challenger may never develop
into the Great Magazine envisioned in
the editors' note, but, for a first effort,
it is noteworthy and interesting, and
will serve as a fine memento for cam
pus sentimentalists of what the San
Francisco newspapers call "The Great
Student Revolt."
The recently-issued Stanford
Challenger, it skeins, is in
flicted with the Moses Syn
drome — a desire to lead the
bewildered Stanford student
out of the hot sands of aliena
tion-prone Inner Quad and
into the pleasant oasis of so
cial activism.
From an introductory edi
tors' note discussing the "per
verted value system of . . .
malevolent administrators" to
an article on civil disobedience,
the magazine assumes th e
premise of activism, and then
proceeds to argue fine details
for (50 pages.
And so it is that the reader,
unless lie happens to l>c a stu
dent activist, will go away mi

convinced, perhaps w i th a
stronger feeling of alienation
toward the Challenger than to
ward The Nasty University.
In what is no doubt the best
article of the magazine. Prof.
Christian Bay of the Depart
ment of Political Science pro
motes "Education for Free
dom" in opposition to the phil
osophy that education is a proc
ess of preparing the student
for his place in society.
Bay sees as a basic difficulty
of current education "the per
verse and yet all-pervasive idea
that people should l>e shaped
for the jobs available, rather
than the other way around."
The best education, Bay
states, is the one which "does
the most good in terms of pro
moting every individual's capa
city to defend his freedom in

the fullest sense." Individual
freedom b« iconics for him the
chief aim of education.
This freedom, as defined by
Bay, has three components. It
is psychological, meaning that
the individual understands his
own motives; it is social, mean
ing that the individual has the
opportunity to make a choice
without the constraints of so
ciety; and it is autonomous,
meaning that the individual is
aware of the variety of alter
native choices open to him.
An article by James Sattler,
a graduate student doing re
search at the Hoover Institu
tion who is called by one GCC
insider "a member of the radi
cal wing of the organization,"
discusses the long-range goals
of the graduate group in an
article titled "Stanford — Tin*

GCC and the Communitarian
University."
Sattler sees the current con
flict as one between what he
calls the Establishment, a ii d
those people living in an intel
lectual a n d social isolation
which he calls "the inner
ghetto."
The former group, he says, is
comprised of "the authoritar
ian lilieral corporation-univer
sity complex; the administra
tors of external improvement
[e.g., slogans and statistics
about excellence ami Ph.D. ra
tios, PACE]."
The latter, lie says, is a new
class of students, "communi
tarians" —"people who are the
conscious proletariat of the
American New Left."
Sattler states that the "noil-
Establishinentarians," presum

ably including the GCC, wish
nothing less than a complete
transformation of the Univer
sity into a communitarian so
ciety.
lie concludes, in a manner
that is more assertive than ra
tional, that even though there
are "good guys" on both sides
(an admission that is out of
tone with tin* rest of the ar
ticle), coexistence between the
two groups is impossible.
It isn't hard to guess which
side he thinks must go.
A somewhat more palatable
approach — though similar and
more inclusive — is made by
Henry Anderson in his "War
on Alienation."
Anderson asserts that the
"War <>n Poverty" is not really
an answer to the need for so-
cial change. Since he feels strongly
too strongly, perhaps — about men's
plight in the "very dungeon in which
most of us languish," he advocates an
increase in what he terms "face-to-face
associations."
These associations will be voluntary,
apolitical and relatively cheap. They will
be the basic social units in his "com
munitarian" society — a Utopia staffed
by dedicated social activists, not social
workers.
In these two articles, then, one sees
the worst symptoms of the Moses Syn
drome — overwrought analysis and a
penchant for phrasemongering.
One of the better articles of the issue
is a caustic commentary by co-editor R.
V. Denenberg, "The Loneliness of the
Long-Distance Agitator," which dis
cusses with a good deal of insight the
institutionalization of civil disobedience
in the American society.
Denenberg presents the theory that
the acceptance of such disobedience is
a result of demonstrators pledging "not
to be Nasty" by not extending th e i r
pleas for public sympathy into hin
drances annoying to society.
However, says Denenberg, "By agree

ing not to be disagreeable . . . civil dis
obedience abandoned what is potentially
its greatest weapon, for the ultimate
strength of the technique is that where
sympathy fails to follow a demonstra
tion of grievance, simple desire to get
rid of the hindrance may effect amelio
ration of the complaint."
DEN EN BERG'S ARGUMENT grows
weak, however, when he attempts to
convince his public that civil disobedi
ence with the pure purpose of disrup
tion is an effective method of gaining
an end. He asserts, but fails to explain,
how it is that such a demonstration of
"Nastiness" leads those annoyed by it
to work for the demonstrating group's
ends, rather than the elimination of the
group itself.
Completing the excellent duet on the
civil rights movement is Luke Rabat's
"Notes From the County Jail."
Admittedly Kafkaesque in parts, this
diary is also remarkably human in
others. Young Negro girls get sick of
drinking Cokes after integrating three
restaurants; one integrationist has his
ardor temporarily inflamed by an ex
cess of hot pepper on his hamburgers
at the Chick'n Treat.
VET THE STORY is primarily one of
horror. And although the author is
sometimes overwrought, one concludes
that he has reason to be.

For the scene is Meridian, Mississippi,
home of the 21 men accused of killing
Chancy, Schwerner and Goodman, and
the time is proximate. Kabat can thus
be forgiven his excesses; Riven the
situation they are undoubtedly all too
true.
No liberal campus magazine would be
complete without some commentary on
the ideological parents of the student
rebellion at Berkeley—the Free Speech
Movement. Thus, there are two articles;
both are uneven.
MADEEON BERKOWITZ' "Commen
tary on the Commentaries" is best when
it criticizes some of the more inane
interpretations of the Berkeley revolt,
such as Prof. Lewis Feuer's abject
analysis of the University as a magnet
for the "morally corrupt, intellectual
lumpen proletariats, lumpen beatniks,
lumpen agitators" who "wend their way
to the university campus to advocate a
melange of narcotics, sexual perver
sion, collegiate Castroism and campus
Maoism."
Mrs. Berkowitz, a graduate student
in history, quite aptly terms this "color
ful name calling," and then proceeds to
apply the brush herself. The critics -
such as Feuer and Sidney Hook — are
"middle-aged liberals;" the Trustees and
Board of Regents for large universities
represent "industrial interests . . . more

concerned about perpetuating them
selves than improving liberal educa
tion;" and the American student, to

the editors' note, but, for a first effort,
it is noteworthy and interesting, and
will serve as a fine memento for cam
pus sentimentalists of what the San
Francisco newspapers call "The Great
Student Revolt."
The recently-issued Stanford
Challenger, it skeins, is in
flicted with the Moses Syn
drome — a desire to lead the
bewildered Stanford student
out of the hot sands of aliena
tion-prone Inner Quad and
into the pleasant oasis of so
cial activism.
From an introductory edi
tors' note discussing the "per
verted value system of . . .
malevolent administrators" to
an article on civil disobedience,
the magazine assumes th e
premise of activism, and then
proceeds to argue fine details
for (50 pages.
And so it is that the reader,
unless lie happens to l>c a stu
dent activist, will go away mi

convinced, perhaps w i th a
stronger feeling of alienation
toward the Challenger than to
ward The Nasty University.
In what is no doubt the best
article of the magazine. Prof.
Christian Bay of the Depart
ment of Political Science pro
motes "Education for Free
dom" in opposition to the phil
osophy that education is a proc
ess of preparing the student
for his place in society.
Bay sees as a basic difficulty
of current education "the per
verse and yet all-pervasive idea
that people should l>e shaped
for the jobs available, rather
than the other way around."
The best education, Bay
states, is the one which "does
the most good in terms of pro
moting every individual's capa
city to defend his freedom in

the fullest sense." Individual
freedom b« iconics for him the
chief aim of education.
This freedom, as defined by
Bay, has three components. It
is psychological, meaning that
the individual understands his
own motives; it is social, mean
ing that the individual has the
opportunity to make a choice
without the constraints of so
ciety; and it is autonomous,
meaning that the individual is
aware of the variety of alter
native choices open to him.
An article by James Sattler,
a graduate student doing re
search at the Hoover Institu
tion who is called by one GCC
insider "a member of the radi
cal wing of the organization,"
discusses the long-range goals
of the graduate group in an
article titled "Stanford — Tin*

GCC and the Communitarian
University."
Sattler sees the current con
flict as one between what he
calls the Establishment, a ii d
those people living in an intel
lectual a n d social isolation
which he calls "the inner
ghetto."
The former group, he says, is
comprised of "the authoritar
ian lilieral corporation-univer
sity complex; the administra
tors of external improvement
[e.g., slogans and statistics
about excellence ami Ph.D. ra
tios, PACE]."
The latter, lie says, is a new
class of students, "communi
tarians" —"people who are the
conscious proletariat of the
American New Left."
Sattler states that the "noil-
Establishinentarians," presum

ably including the GCC, wish
nothing less than a complete
transformation of the Univer
sity into a communitarian so
ciety.
lie concludes, in a manner
that is more assertive than ra
tional, that even though there
are "good guys" on both sides
(an admission that is out of
tone with tin* rest of the ar
ticle), coexistence between the
two groups is impossible.
It isn't hard to guess which
side he thinks must go.
A somewhat more palatable
approach — though similar and
more inclusive — is made by
Henry Anderson in his "War
on Alienation."
Anderson asserts that the
"War <>n Poverty" is not really
an answer to the need for so-
cial change. Since he feels strongly
too strongly, perhaps — about men's
plight in the "very dungeon in which
most of us languish," he advocates an
increase in what he terms "face-to-face
associations."
These associations will be voluntary,
apolitical and relatively cheap. They will
be the basic social units in his "com
munitarian" society — a Utopia staffed
by dedicated social activists, not social
workers.
In these two articles, then, one sees
the worst symptoms of the Moses Syn
drome — overwrought analysis and a
penchant for phrasemongering.
One of the better articles of the issue
is a caustic commentary by co-editor R.
V. Denenberg, "The Loneliness of the
Long-Distance Agitator," which dis
cusses with a good deal of insight the
institutionalization of civil disobedience
in the American society.
Denenberg presents the theory that
the acceptance of such disobedience is
a result of demonstrators pledging "not
to be Nasty" by not extending th e i r
pleas for public sympathy into hin
drances annoying to society.
However, says Denenberg, "By agree

ing not to be disagreeable . . . civil dis
obedience abandoned what is potentially
its greatest weapon, for the ultimate
strength of the technique is that where
sympathy fails to follow a demonstra
tion of grievance, simple desire to get
rid of the hindrance may effect amelio
ration of the complaint."
DEN EN BERG'S ARGUMENT grows
weak, however, when he attempts to
convince his public that civil disobedi
ence with the pure purpose of disrup
tion is an effective method of gaining
an end. He asserts, but fails to explain,
how it is that such a demonstration of
"Nastiness" leads those annoyed by it
to work for the demonstrating group's
ends, rather than the elimination of the
group itself.
Completing the excellent duet on the
civil rights movement is Luke Rabat's
"Notes From the County Jail."
Admittedly Kafkaesque in parts, this
diary is also remarkably human in
others. Young Negro girls get sick of
drinking Cokes after integrating three
restaurants; one integrationist has his
ardor temporarily inflamed by an ex
cess of hot pepper on his hamburgers
at the Chick'n Treat.
VET THE STORY is primarily one of
horror. And although the author is
sometimes overwrought, one concludes
that he has reason to be.

For the scene is Meridian, Mississippi,
home of the 21 men accused of killing
Chancy, Schwerner and Goodman, and
the time is proximate. Kabat can thus
be forgiven his excesses; Riven the
situation they are undoubtedly all too
true.
No liberal campus magazine would be
complete without some commentary on
the ideological parents of the student
rebellion at Berkeley—the Free Speech
Movement. Thus, there are two articles;
both are uneven.
MADEEON BERKOWITZ' "Commen
tary on the Commentaries" is best when
it criticizes some of the more inane
interpretations of the Berkeley revolt,
such as Prof. Lewis Feuer's abject
analysis of the University as a magnet
for the "morally corrupt, intellectual
lumpen proletariats, lumpen beatniks,
lumpen agitators" who "wend their way
to the university campus to advocate a
melange of narcotics, sexual perver
sion, collegiate Castroism and campus
Maoism."
Mrs. Berkowitz, a graduate student
in history, quite aptly terms this "color
ful name calling," and then proceeds to
apply the brush herself. The critics -
such as Feuer and Sidney Hook — are
"middle-aged liberals;" the Trustees and
Board of Regents for large universities
represent "industrial interests . . . more

concerned about perpetuating them
selves than improving liberal educa
tion;" and the American student, to
use Paul Goodman's observation, is
today's "major exploited class."
However, when the author refrains
from advocacy, her analysis of what
the problems were — and are — make
the effort quite valuable.
THE AYVAKI) for pedantry goes to
Edward Epstein for his minute-by-min
ute and witness-by-witness account of
"Who Killed Tippit:—and Why?"
Epstein's thesis, complete with "third
men" and "fifth bullets," is only an
other variation on the recurring theme
of absolute innocence until guilt is
proven beyond all doubt, not all rea
sonable doubt, that some have used con
tinually in considering the Kennedy
Assassination and the Warren Report.
The author scores the Commission
for having "conspicuously avoided pur
suing any lines which may have sug
gested Tippit's involvement with Os
wald" and for ignoring "rumors t hat
Tippit knew Ruby."
The inference, then, is that the "au
thoritarian liberals" mentioned else
where in the magazine in this article
embodied by Warren, McCone, Russell,
et al have failed to render justice, and,
more importantly, they did so on pur
pose.

Likewise, Professor J. R. Seeley's let -
tor to Berkeley Chancellor Martin
Meyerson ranges from profundity to
sophistry with relative ease.
ON ONK HANI), there is a brief and
illuminating analysis of administra
tive power in universities "it is no)
oven given power, but seized power,
Hobbesian power, power ceded lest
worse befall, power without consensus
or consent. ... It can budget and con
tain. It cannot create. It cannot lead."
But then comes the overstatement
"I'm not sure there is a University
worthy of the name left"—and the tor
tured imagery — "Emancipation is
something that, taken in too small bits,
turns to dead sea fruit and ashes in
the mouth."
The magazine as a whole, in spite of
(or perhaps partly because of > its radi
cal slant, is well written and well worth
reading—in fact, essential reading for
anyone wishing to understand the
forces that effect a university as it
quavers on the edge of greatness.
