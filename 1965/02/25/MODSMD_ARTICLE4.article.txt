old infirmary, which is located
five miles from the center of cam

The new Health Center will

"The new center," reports Dr.
Maurice M. Osborne, director of
the Health Service, "will be
highly accessible, always avail

less of the student's time than we
have been able to offer in the past
because of our dispersed loca
tion."

health service building is due to
