# BU Students Fight To Control Paper
## 
### 
BOSTON (CPS) â€”A struggle
for the control of tho newspaper
at Boston University moved to
ward a climax this week as the
School's Student Congress pre
pared to demand that control of
the News be turned over the the
Congress by the Board of Trus
tees.
President of the University
Harold C. Case opened the con
troversy when he invoked a long
dormant section of the news*-
paper's charter that permits tho
administration to exercise censor
ship over the paper and to compel
it to print any article the adminis
tration wished to have printed.
Case's demand s apparently
came in response to an editorial
in last week's issue of the News
attacking a plan by the adminis
tration to take over control of the
campus FM radio station which
is now student controied.
The paper had also been out
spoken in criticism of the campus
bookstore which it said reaped
"excessive profits."
Last week, after Case an
nounced that he would use the
section of the charter to print a
front page editorial and news
stroy, the Student Congress voted
to give the News money to print
a "bootleg" edition of the issue

that would not contain tho Case
material. It also asked Case to
expunge the section of the charter
governing the operation of the
News.
Case dropped his demand but
said only the University Board of
Trustees could change the char
ter. He also .said that he would
not invoke the clause as long as
the News "maintains a standard
of responsible journalism."
