# PERVERSE INTERESTS:
## Hawkes Sees Horror In Life 
### MARSHA COOK 
"I am a puritan from beginning to end
I just have an interest in the perverse,"
stated John Hawkes, author of Second
Skin, yesterday afternoon in Trcsidder
Union.
As an author and playwright, Hawkes
said he has "spent fifteen years trying to
be true to the horror which permeates the
world we live in."
"LOVE DOESN'T cure the sickness <Â»1
our age," he stated.
His talk centered on his novels The
( annib.il and Second Skin, although lie read
a recent work, a one-act play which he has
titled The Wax Museum.
Hawkes has been working with the Ac
tor's Workshop iti San Francisco on a Ford
Foundation Grant. Recently he was asked to
write a play using two female characters.

The result was The Wax Museum, with
"Sally Ann" and a lively lady called "Bingo.'
The two confront each other in "an unclean,
lurid place."
BINGO'S LINES set the pace for the
whole sequence. She says of Christine Keel
er: "She's every school girl's heroine;" of
Tar/an "He's the only American in the
place;" of Marie Antoninettc, "Maybe she
remembered herself as a virgin when the
axe fell;" of Joan of Arc, "She was ignor
ant. but she had pretty legs though."
Bingo also says. "Love is dirty. Didn't
anyone ever tell you that before?"
Hawkes felt thai "The writer's position
is a fairly easy one" in drama because of
the permanent physical viewpoint. Fiction
is the constant effort of finding a psycho
logical stance.
"FICTION STARTS when you arrive at
nothing," he said.
When writing for the theater. Ilawkes

has found that reality is "the stage itself."
Before he began his work with the theater,
lie explained thai he "had no idea that ac
tors were intelligent."
Among his other works are The Beetle
Leg, (ioose and the Grave, and Tin* Lime
Twig. The Second skin has been nominated
for the National Book Award to be given
this March.
lIAWKLS FOMIKKLY taught at Har
vard and is presently an associate professor
of English at Brown University. He has re
ceived a Guggenheim Fellowship.
He told the audience that during college
he had a very difficult lime passing foreign
language courses and came out of the ex
perience with a deep loathing for German
and Germany.
The Wax Museum was Hawkes' first dra
matic work. He did not announce its first
reading, although he said it would be in the
near future.
