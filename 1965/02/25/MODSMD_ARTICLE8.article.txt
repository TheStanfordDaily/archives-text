The LASSU Rules Committee last night approved a thoroughly
amended version of the Judicial Reform Bill, giving the ASSU
"exclusive original judicial jurisdiction" in cases involving student
affairs and conduct.
The bill, amended by Gary Feldman and Robert Sangster,

permits judicial councils lo con
• sider University policies under the
Fundamental Standard only
when those policies have been ap
proved by a two-thirds vote of the
Legislature.
This bill, plus one dealing with
Women's Social Regulations and
another concerning the accept
ance of liquor advertisements for
i The Daily, will highlight the
LASSU meeting to be held in
| Room 320 at 7:30 tonight.

i fines cases in which the ASSU
j judicial councils may find a stu
dent guilty as only those "which
they judge to be in violation of:
(a> the ASSU Constitution and
By-Laws (b) the Fundamental
Standard — which shall be c o n
strued so as to include: the Honor
Code; convictions under State and
Federal statutes; and policies of
the University" which have been
approved by the Legislature.
Under the bill, the student is
offered the option of having his
case handled by the judicial sys
tem or of having the Dean of

is not exclusive, that actions that
were considered violations of the
! Honor Code or University policy,
| or that resulted in conviction un
der State and Federal statutes
could still be considered by the
judicial councils.
IN TIIE AREA of convictions
| under a State or Federal statute,
"a judicial council shall not be
! compelled to reach a finding of
violation of the Fundamental
Standard if the* circumstances of
I the case indicate that such find
i ing would be inequitable when
j awarded in addition to civil or
! criminal penalties."
University policies would fall
1 under the Fundamental Standard
if the policy is first submitted to
the ASSU President, who, in turn,
would present it to the Legisla
ture. LASSU would have to ac

strued so as to include: the Honor

| or that resulted in conviction un
der State and Federal statutes
could still be considered by the
judicial councils.
IN TIIE AREA of convictions

violation of the Fundamental
Standard if the* circumstances of
I the case indicate that such find
i ing would be inequitable when
j awarded in addition to civil or

would present it to the Legisla
ture. LASSU would have to ac
cept or reject the policy within
