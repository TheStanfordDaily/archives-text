I all the head knowledge and doctrine in the w rid. The Apostle Paul abandoned his
| ititcllcctii.il. theological background that he might know (jml and walk with llim:
"Hut what things w.-rc gain to ntc those 1 counted loss for Christ. Yea. doubtless,
! and I count all things but loss for the < xeclli ncy of the knowledge of Christ .lesiis

(iod meets individuals today on a man-to man basis. \,, human mediators or
priests are necessary. Anyutn who wishes, may know God and walk with Him in

The presence of sin in your life will quickly quench the Holy Spirit and bring

is basically acting in independence of fjod, hence the vital importance of total sur

i involves a total surrender, in e\< ry area of lift .to J. sits Christ.
'I hon who chose to run tin race, to s,, k the living (iod who inhabits eternity, j
; never regret the abandonment of their live- to llis. "...that I may know Him

Mini in llis death, that if possible. I might attain the resurrection from the dead. 1
i Not that I havi already obtained this or am already perfect: but I press on to make j
; it my own. because Christ Jesus has made me His own. Brethren, I do not consider
i j that I have it my own; but this one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and
! straining forward to what lies ahead. I pre-- on toward the goal for the prize of the
upward calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of lis who arc mature be thus minded;
j and if in anything you arc otherwise minded. (lod will reveal that also to yotl."

Perhaps you have not yet met Jcstis Christ. This is an i ssential fir t-stcp in walk*

always said that life with Hint i- lift ,is it should I>< lived by all. What's keeping you
from finding out for yourself?
