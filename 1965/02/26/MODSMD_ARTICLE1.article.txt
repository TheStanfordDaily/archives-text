### JIM HAUSER International Editor 
The Stanford Chapter of Sigma
Chi fraternity has announced that
it will ask its national organiza
tion to allow Negro membership
in Sigma Chi locals when the na
tional meets in Denser, Colo, this
June.
"We are considering at least
one, maybe two Negro rushecs
right now." Gary Kerns, president
of Stanford Sigma Chi, said.
"I would stress that we are
working with the national organ
ization on this," he said.
If Sigma Chi does pledge a Ne
gro this spring, it would be the
first chapter in the country to do
so. Other minority group mem
ber?; have already been accepted.
The national organization
dropped the "white clause" bar
ring Negro membership in 1958.
"We have been working since
September. garnered support
from California locals, from alum
ni. and from the university." the
president said. "The majority are
for Negro membership as long as
we can get the national to agree?."
Kerns said the national organ
ization is still undecided. The
point in question, he said, is a
clause in the national charter say
ing "each member (of a local)
must lie socially acceptable to any
Sigma Chi."
