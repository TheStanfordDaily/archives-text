# THE 						BEARD OF AVON
## 
### 
Topic for today is that perennial favorite of English majors,
that ever-popular crowd pleaser, that good sport and grout
American —William. Shakespeare (or "The Swedish Nightin
gale" as he is better known as).
First let us examine the persistent theory 1 hat Shakespeare (or
"The Pearl of the Pacific" as he is jocularly culled) is not the
real author of his plays. Advocates of this theory insist the plays
arc so full of classical allusions and learned references 1 hat they
couldn't possibly have been written by the son of an illiterate
country butcher.
To which I reply "Faugh!" Was not the great Spinoza's father
a humble woodcutter? Was not the immortal Isaac Newton's
father a simple second baseman? (The elder Newton, incidental
ly, is one of history's truly pathetic figures. He was, by all ac
counts, the greatest second baseman of his time, but baseball,
alas, had not yet been invented. It used to break young Isaac's
heart to see his father get up every morning, put on uniform,
spikes, glove, and cap, and stand alertly behind second base,
bent forward, eyes narrowed, waiting, waiting, waiting. That's
all —waiting. Isaac loyally sat in the bleachers and yelled "(lood
show, Dad!" and stuff like that, but everyone else in town snig
gered derisively, made coarse gestures, and pelted the Newtons
with overripe fruit —figs for the elder Newton, apples for the
younger. Thus, as we all know, the famous moment came when
Isaac Newton, struck in the head with an apple, leapt to his feet,
shouted "Europa!" and announced the third law of mot ion: "For
every action there is an opposite and equal reaction!"^

(IIow profoundly true ilvosc simple words arc! Take, for ex
ample, Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades. Shave with a
Personna. That's the action. Now what is the reaction? Pleasure,
delight, contentment, cheer, and facial felicity. W hy such a
happy reaction? Because you have started with the sharpest,
most durable blade ever honed —a blade that gives you more
shaves, closer shaves, comfort abler shaves than any other brand
on the market. If, by chance, you don't agree, simply return
your unused Personnas to the manufacturer and lie will send you
absolutely free a package of Beep-Beep or any other blade you
think is better.)
Hut I digress. Back to Shakespeare (or "The Gem of the
Ocean" as he was ribaldly appelated).
Shakespeare's most important play is, of course, Ilamlet (or,
ns it is frequently called, Macbeth). This play tells in living color
the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who one night sees a
ghost upon the battlements. (Possibly it is a goat he sees; I have
a first folio t hat is frankly not too legible.) Anyhow, Hamlet, is so
upset by seeing this ghost (or goat) that he stabs Polonius and
Brer Bodkin, lie is thereupon banished to a leather factory by
the king, who hollers, "Get thee to a tannery 1" Thereupon
Ophelia refuses her food until Laertes shouts, "Get thee to a
beanery!" Ophelia is so cross that she chases her little dog out of
t he room, crying, "Out, damned Spot!" She is fined fifty shillings
for cussing, but Portia, in an eloquent plea, gets the sentence eon i
muted to life imprisonment. Thereupon King Lear and Queen
A lab proclaim a festival —complete with kissing games and a
pie-eating contest. Everybody has a perfectly splendid t inie unt il
Banquo's ghost (or goat) shows up. This so unhinges Richard 111
that lie drowns his cousin, Butt Malmsey. This leads to a lively
discussion, during which everyone is killed. The little dog Spot
returns to utter the immortal curtain lines:

Shakespeare's most important play is, of course, Ilamlet (or,

the story of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, who one night sees a
ghost upon the battlements. (Possibly it is a goat he sees; I have
a first folio t hat is frankly not too legible.) Anyhow, Hamlet, is so
upset by seeing this ghost (or goat) that he stabs Polonius and
Brer Bodkin, lie is thereupon banished to a leather factory by
the king, who hollers, "Get thee to a tannery 1" Thereupon
Ophelia refuses her food until Laertes shouts, "Get thee to a
beanery!" Ophelia is so cross that she chases her little dog out of
t he room, crying, "Out, damned Spot!" She is fined fifty shillings
for cussing, but Portia, in an eloquent plea, gets the sentence eon i

Topic for today is that perennial favorite of English majors,
that ever-popular crowd pleaser, that good sport and grout
American —William. Shakespeare (or "The Swedish Nightin
gale" as he is better known as).
First let us examine the persistent theory 1 hat Shakespeare (or
"The Pearl of the Pacific" as he is jocularly culled) is not the
real author of his plays. Advocates of this theory insist the plays
arc so full of classical allusions and learned references 1 hat they
couldn't possibly have been written by the son of an illiterate
country butcher.
To which I reply "Faugh!" Was not the great Spinoza's father
a humble woodcutter? Was not the immortal Isaac Newton's
father a simple second baseman? (The elder Newton, incidental
ly, is one of history's truly pathetic figures. He was, by all ac
counts, the greatest second baseman of his time, but baseball,
alas, had not yet been invented. It used to break young Isaac's
heart to see his father get up every morning, put on uniform,
spikes, glove, and cap, and stand alertly behind second base,
bent forward, eyes narrowed, waiting, waiting, waiting. That's
all —waiting. Isaac loyally sat in the bleachers and yelled "(lood
show, Dad!" and stuff like that, but everyone else in town snig
gered derisively, made coarse gestures, and pelted the Newtons
with overripe fruit —figs for the elder Newton, apples for the
younger. Thus, as we all know, the famous moment came when
Isaac Newton, struck in the head with an apple, leapt to his feet,
shouted "Europa!" and announced the third law of mot ion: "For
