# 'Marriage' Is Pure Escapism
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
A sneaking suspicion arose
I while watching "Marriage Italian
Style" the other night, one which
; after much rumination seems
more and more like a disastrous
certainty — that mass production
has invaded the Italian movie in
dustry. Vittorio de Sica and Carlo
Ponti, the Henry Fords of foreign
filmdom, are now using inter
-1 changeable actors, the principle
I being that if one sticks Marcello
Mastroianni and Sophia Lorcn in
any scenario and lets Ihom do
! their stuff, the result is bound
i to be a success.
This, of course, supposes that
the plots, sets, costumes, etc. are
all more or less alike — which
they are, consisting of a tawdrily
elegant background against which
sex and respectability inevitably
(and often comically) get all tan
gled up. Nothing momentous is
said or done; but everyone on the
scene seems to be having a gay
' old time, and presumbaly enjoy
ment is infectious, or something.
Art Or Model T?
The fallacy in all this is that
! making Model T's requires crafts
| manship, while making a movie
ought to require an expenditure
of artistry, which this one doesn't
seem to be doing most of th e
time. Of course, it is only fair to
i say .that Ponti and de Sica are
not the first to have used this
technique and fallen into the trap;
I Hollywood has been doing it. for
i years, most recently in that re
| volting series of emasculated
surfing movies whose low-water
| mark was "Muscle Beach Party."
In contrast to Ihe frenetic ba
i nality of "Muscle," however, the
| Italians (Europeans always do
; things so much better) at least
! have managed to come up with an
entertaining evening in their lat-
I est attempt.
This variation on the old theme
i features Sophia as a prostitute
| who has been kept by the same
man (Marcello) on and off for a
, decade or two, and who has spent
! her leisure hours thinking up
; clever little schemes to get him to
I marry her, none of which ha s
i so far succeeded.
Sophia's Trump Card
Meanwhile, she has borne him
i at least one — and possibly three
sons, which tardy and unset
tling disclosure finally does the
matrimonial trick. In between,
the picture is pretty consistently
satiric, often savagely so; for
tunately, it never really gets seri
ous. Mastroianni's performance
occasionally falls short of its
customary excellence, and Loren
has some trouble playing the
homely homebody; otherwise they
are as inimitable as ever.
j The color often seems a bit
overexposed; maybe it's just that
! Mediterranean sunlight. And
j somebody ought to send Naples a
carload of SOS pads before the
creeping grunge takes over the
place.
But enough. Just as marriage
(Italian style) is no marriage at
all, so, obviously, this movie is
no artistic milestone. Neverthe
less, it does have its share of good
moments, and so, if nothing else,
is worth it as pure high-quality
escapism.

A sneaking suspicion arose
I while watching "Marriage Italian
Style" the other night, one which
; after much rumination seems
more and more like a disastrous
certainty — that mass production
has invaded the Italian movie in
dustry. Vittorio de Sica and Carlo
Ponti, the Henry Fords of foreign
filmdom, are now using inter
-1 changeable actors, the principle
I being that if one sticks Marcello
Mastroianni and Sophia Lorcn in
any scenario and lets Ihom do
! their stuff, the result is bound
i to be a success.
This, of course, supposes that
the plots, sets, costumes, etc. are
all more or less alike — which
they are, consisting of a tawdrily
elegant background against which
sex and respectability inevitably
(and often comically) get all tan
gled up. Nothing momentous is
said or done; but everyone on the
scene seems to be having a gay
' old time, and presumbaly enjoy
ment is infectious, or something.
Art Or Model T?
The fallacy in all this is that
! making Model T's requires crafts
| manship, while making a movie
ought to require an expenditure
of artistry, which this one doesn't
seem to be doing most of th e
time. Of course, it is only fair to
i say .that Ponti and de Sica are
not the first to have used this
technique and fallen into the trap;
I Hollywood has been doing it. for
i years, most recently in that re
| volting series of emasculated
surfing movies whose low-water
| mark was "Muscle Beach Party."
In contrast to Ihe frenetic ba
i nality of "Muscle," however, the
| Italians (Europeans always do
; things so much better) at least
! have managed to come up with an
entertaining evening in their lat-
I est attempt.
This variation on the old theme
i features Sophia as a prostitute
| who has been kept by the same
man (Marcello) on and off for a
, decade or two, and who has spent
! her leisure hours thinking up
; clever little schemes to get him to
I marry her, none of which ha s
i so far succeeded.
Sophia's Trump Card
Meanwhile, she has borne him
i at least one — and possibly three
sons, which tardy and unset
tling disclosure finally does the
matrimonial trick. In between,
the picture is pretty consistently
satiric, often savagely so; for
tunately, it never really gets seri
ous. Mastroianni's performance
occasionally falls short of its
customary excellence, and Loren
has some trouble playing the
homely homebody; otherwise they
are as inimitable as ever.
j The color often seems a bit
overexposed; maybe it's just that
! Mediterranean sunlight. And
j somebody ought to send Naples a
carload of SOS pads before the
creeping grunge takes over the
place.
But enough. Just as marriage
(Italian style) is no marriage at
all, so, obviously, this movie is
no artistic milestone. Neverthe
less, it does have its share of good
moments, and so, if nothing else,
is worth it as pure high-quality
escapism.
