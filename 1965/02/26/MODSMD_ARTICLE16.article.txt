# 'Blithe Spirit' Missing The Necessary Flair
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
The luimor of Noel Coward's
| "Blithe Spirit" is not the belly
! laugh sort of humor that one
finds in most Broadway comedies.
|It is, rather, an extremely witty
and brittle brand of humor the
! sort so often found in British
! comedies that requires a spe
cial, undefinable flair on the part
j of the cast and director.
Regrettably, this flair is only
I sporadically apparent in the cur
rent production at Burlingame's
Hyatt Music Theatre directed by
; Michael Ferrall.
When il is apparent "Blithe
: Spirit" is like a delicious glass of
i sparkling champagne. But when
it is not, it is like a long episode
of the television series "Topper."
Ghosts And Such
For "Blithe Spirit" is the story
of Charles Condomine, a writer
j who, in researching a book, in
j vites a medium to his house for
I a seance. When she inadvertently
| materializes (i.e., brings back) his
dead first wife — who can be seen
I and heard only by him — all kinds
I of complications develop.
In the role of Elvira — the first
wife Arleno Dahl is charming,
lovely and talented. Costumed in
a flowing dress of lavender chif-
I Ton, she seems to float ratber than
| walk across the stage. In spite of
i her necessarily pale make-up, her

[ seductive voice and totally femi
nine manner must make her the
; world's sexiest ghost.
As Madame Arcati the me
; dium — Ann B. Davis comes close
| to walking away with the show.
! Her part is the most interesting,
land she takes full advantage of
I its inherent opportunities ex-
I ploiting them to tho fullest with
out ever going overboard as a
| less expert actress might.
Sullivan Unconvincing
Grant Sullivan is simply uncon
vincing as the middle-aged Con
! domine. Although he delivers his
[lines with a veteran's skill, his
| voice and his virile good looks
j count too heavily against him.
Marrian Walters plays Mrs.
Condomine with an appropriate
acidity. Although virtually inau
dible in the play's opening scene,
j her performance in later scenes
| is quite good.
| William Browder is good and
Peggy Doyle is outstanding as a
stuffy doctor and his wife. A n d
Ann Wakefield — as the maid
is excellent. In a cast whose Brit
ish accents range from inconsist
ent to nonexistent, she is flawless.
Ferrall's direction keeps the ac
tors constantly in motion, but all
too often seems pointless — fre
quently resembling some strange
kind of dance performed by part
ners maneuvering around the
huge L-shaped sofa that domi
nates the stage.

dead first wife — who can be seen

I of complications develop.
In the role of Elvira — the first
wife Arleno Dahl is charming,
