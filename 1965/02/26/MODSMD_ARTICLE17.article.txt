# Indians Begin Key Series
## Undefeatable UCLA Team Here Tonight 
### PETER EAKIAND 
Stanford goes against UCLA's
high-stepping Wooden horse to
night at 8:00 in the Pavilion.
Bruin Coach John Wooden brings
his talent-laden squad, which
hasn't lost a league game in
two years, north to wrap up its
fourth consecutive league cham
pionship.
The Indians are currently wag
ing an uphill battle to secure
second place, which is now occu
pied by SC. If Stanford wins to
night against lICLA or Saturday
against SC and then goes on next
week to topple Cal twice, it will
have a chance at the runner-up
slot since SC must play the Bruins
twice more.
HEADING Till: Bruins attack
are Gail "Mr. Offense" Goodrich,
who is the conference scoring
leader at 23.3 points per game,
and forward Keith "Mr. Defense"
Erickson, who is not only the
team's second leading scorer(l3.3 >
but also a defensive standout.
The Bruins have two other double
figures scorers in Freddie Goss
(12.5i and Edgar Lacey (11.5).
The supporting cast is impres
sive: starting center Doug Mcin
tosh; his sophomore substitute,
Mike Lynn; and utilily man Ken
ny Washington, who is adept at
filling weaknesses in both the
backcourt and the front line.
The Indians are in the role of
giant-killer, but they can find
solance in the fact that the Bruins
have not found the confines of the
Pavilion to their liking in recent
years. Before winning 100-88 last
year, the Bruins had a three game
losing streak here.
The Indians have been playing
.500 ball the last two weeks,
which is not fitting for a conten
der. Bob Bedell has been carrying
the offensive load as he poured
through 36 points last weekend,
48 the week before.
Sporadic basketball is one thing
they cannot afford this weekend.
To win, the Indians must play 40
minutes of their best basketball,
something Coach Howie Dallmar
readily admits. This means no
ball-handling errors, no defensive
lapses, and consistent scoring and
rebounding.
On the season, the Bruins have
won 19 and lost 2. Their conquers
were Illinois in the opening game
and lowa midway through the
season. They have now won seven
in a row.
