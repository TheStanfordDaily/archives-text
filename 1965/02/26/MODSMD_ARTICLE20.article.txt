## 
### 
By WKLLS SHOEMAKER
Indian swimmers will he in hoi
water this weekend. Stanford
meets explosive Foothill this
afternoon away. Tomorrow at 2
p.m., Cal comes to Stanford seek
ing to avenge a 53-42 beating
earlier this season.
The Papooses, with two weeks
training between them and their
last meet, will be hot on the rec
ord trail against Santa Ana JC
; loday and Cal's t'rosh tomorrow.
Foothill has overpowering
1 strength. In recent meets ihe Owls
j forced NCAA champion USC
| down to the last relay. If Foothill

were a four-year school, the Owls
would surely rale anions the top
three teams in the nation.
STANFORD AND Chl will both
be at season's peak 1 his weekend,
with the AAWU championships
only a week away. In their earlier
encounter this year, Stanford led
all the way but needed a pitched
effort in the freestyle relay to
earn a victory.
Stanford's llkka Suvanto, who
won three events against UCLA
last weekend, has been ill. With
out Suvanto, the Cal meet will
become uncomfortably tight.
Jim Laney, Bill Derrig, and
Dave Calfree, each of whom won
two or more events in Stanford's
62-33 rout of the Bruins, will
carry the burden for Stanford.
Mike Wall and Marv Parmely,
who both broke the NCAA fresh
man 500 free record two weeks
ago, will have another shot at the
same distance this weekend. Gary
Sheerer, Bob Momsen, John Kes
ler, and Pete Ready will also be
frosh to watch.
Putting four of these freshmen
together, varsity coach Ji m
Gaughran can perhaps fish oui a
NCAA freshman freestyle relay
record.
