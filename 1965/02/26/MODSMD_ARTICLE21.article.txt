# Indian Nine To Venture From Security Of Home
## 
### 
Stanford's baseballers have
I fared well thus far this season,
: holding to an unblemished record
and registering four victories. But
Coach W. P. (Dutch) Fehring's
I charges have not yet ventured out
:of the plush and spacious con
j fines of the Sunken Diamond, and
'the question remains whether or
i not the horsehiders will suffer
! from the infamous and popular
I Stanford malady of losing road
| trips.
THE INDIANS will hit the road
'for the first time this weekend,
i facing a strong Sacramento State
i squad this afternoon and th en
! traveling to Davis to meet th e
Aggies Saturday.
Though th e league opener
against Cal is only a week away,
Fchring plans to use his top two
hurlers in the weekend tilts.
1 Sophomore flash Daro Quiring
| will do the chores Friday an d
j junior righthander John Mason
: will face the Davis stickers.
BOTH .MASON and Quiring are
i sitting with 1-0 records and 0.00

learned-run averages. Quiring has
I given up but on infield single in
I the two games he has worked
| and at one time retired 19 bat
' ters in a row before an error
broke the skein. Mason salvaged
I an 8-6 Stanford victory over San
Jose by taking over the mound in
' the ninth inning with the sacks
j jammed and forcing the first
hitter into a double play.
Big man at the plate for the In
dians will be right hander Ron
Yett, who has been booming out
long hits all season.
