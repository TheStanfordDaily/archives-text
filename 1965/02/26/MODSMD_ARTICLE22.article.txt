# SU's Wilhelm Selected As All-American
## 
### 
Bruce Wilhelm, who was re
cently given an Honorable Men
tion ranking on a mid-season All-
American wrestling team, will
lead the Stanford Indians against
Cal Saturday in their final dual
meet of the season.
Even though the season has
been a disappointing one for Stan
ford, they have a good chance to
defeat the Bears for their third
victory.
As usual, the Cards will forfeit
the first three weights and hope
that the heavier weight wrestlers
can duplicate these points to their
advantage.
Wilhelm has been the mainstay
in ihe Tribe line-up this season.
He has come up with several falls
and a win over last years PCI
heavyweight champ, Art Makin
ster.
In last week's match Bruce
pinned his opponent in just 18 sec
onds. He has also won falls in 23
and 37 seconds this year.
