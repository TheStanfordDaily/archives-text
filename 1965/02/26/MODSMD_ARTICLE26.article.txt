A provocative exhibition of drawings by Fortu
naif) Duranti, an early nineteenth century Italian
artist who is currently being rediscovered, is on
display through March 7 at the Stanford Art Gal
lery. In his youth Duranti suffered an emotional
breakdown which left him insane for the rest of
his life. Though his drawings are not the scrawl
ings of a madman, his insanity did release him
from the severely conventional neoclassic tradi
tions of his time and allowed him to develop a defi
nitive and richly inventive style.
Duranti's work has the fragmented incomplete
ness and obscurity of remembered dreams. There
are large blank areas in each drawing, and his
figures and backgrounds are never fully developed,
but rather are studies of linear relationships.
Ilis drawings can be grouped by subject matter
into three main areas: religious, classical, and
fantastic. His disiurbing, irreverent treatments of
conventional religious subjects are the most nu
merous. In one ol' the many drawings of the Ma
donna and Child, there is utter fear in the Child's
eyes, and the Madonna, unconcerned, reads a book.
In another, the exaggerated, bulging eyes of both
the Madonna and Child make them look wildly
deranged.
Duranti's drawings with classical settings are
even more noticeably studies <>112 linear relation
ships. In a few of these, sharply drawn, rigid
figures set up geometric patterns against severe

classical columns. In others, there is a loosening
of form, shapes are indicated by a few curves,
and in the graceful, flowing lines there is a note
of tranquillity not present in the artist's other
works. In "Worshippers in an Antique Temple,"
the numerous grouped-together figures are exe-j
cuted with short, jagged lines, and the effect of ;
arrested motion is achieved.
Though all of Duranti's work has the elementj
of fantasy, the third group of drawings is char-1
acterized by the weird figures and the elusive sym-1
bols reminiscent of the fantastic style of Hierony-!
mus Bosch. In one of these, a blurred, winged fig-1
ure descends to earth against a desolate back- J
ground of ruins. At the bottom right of the draw-!
ing, there is a round mirror-like object which Du
ranti uses in many other drawings. (In one picture,
this blank globe covers half the face of the Virgin, i
In another example of his macabre style, Moses
battles a horned monster on a vast, empty plain.
With a few dark strokes to suggest the sky, Du- j
ranti creates an atmosphere of evil and chaos.
Though he reacted against the formalism of j
his time, Duranti's art, despite its persistent note of 1
fragmentation and disorder, has a cold, almost for- j
mal beauty; the viewer observes his work with
detached interest. Duranti has translated into ait
his own personal fantasies; this glimpse into the
workings of his mind is intriguing but too curi
ous and specialized to be moving or to have uni
versal appeal.

naif) Duranti, an early nineteenth century Italian
artist who is currently being rediscovered, is on
display through March 7 at the Stanford Art Gal
lery. In his youth Duranti suffered an emotional
breakdown which left him insane for the rest of
his life. Though his drawings are not the scrawl
ings of a madman, his insanity did release him
from the severely conventional neoclassic tradi
tions of his time and allowed him to develop a defi
nitive and richly inventive style.
Duranti's work has the fragmented incomplete
ness and obscurity of remembered dreams. There
are large blank areas in each drawing, and his
figures and backgrounds are never fully developed,
but rather are studies of linear relationships.
Ilis drawings can be grouped by subject matter
into three main areas: religious, classical, and
fantastic. His disiurbing, irreverent treatments of
conventional religious subjects are the most nu
merous. In one ol' the many drawings of the Ma
donna and Child, there is utter fear in the Child's
eyes, and the Madonna, unconcerned, reads a book.
In another, the exaggerated, bulging eyes of both
the Madonna and Child make them look wildly
deranged.
Duranti's drawings with classical settings are
even more noticeably studies <>112 linear relation
ships. In a few of these, sharply drawn, rigid
figures set up geometric patterns against severe

classical columns. In others, there is a loosening
of form, shapes are indicated by a few curves,
and in the graceful, flowing lines there is a note
of tranquillity not present in the artist's other
works. In "Worshippers in an Antique Temple,"
the numerous grouped-together figures are exe-j
cuted with short, jagged lines, and the effect of ;
arrested motion is achieved.
Though all of Duranti's work has the elementj
of fantasy, the third group of drawings is char-1
acterized by the weird figures and the elusive sym-1
bols reminiscent of the fantastic style of Hierony-!
mus Bosch. In one of these, a blurred, winged fig-1
ure descends to earth against a desolate back- J
ground of ruins. At the bottom right of the draw-!
ing, there is a round mirror-like object which Du
ranti uses in many other drawings. (In one picture,
this blank globe covers half the face of the Virgin, i
In another example of his macabre style, Moses
battles a horned monster on a vast, empty plain.
With a few dark strokes to suggest the sky, Du- j
ranti creates an atmosphere of evil and chaos.
Though he reacted against the formalism of j
his time, Duranti's art, despite its persistent note of 1
fragmentation and disorder, has a cold, almost for- j
mal beauty; the viewer observes his work with
detached interest. Duranti has translated into ait
his own personal fantasies; this glimpse into the
workings of his mind is intriguing but too curi
ous and specialized to be moving or to have uni
versal appeal.
