## Coed Supports Efforts Of Social Regs Committee 
### 
Editor, The. Daily:
The Social Regulations Commit
tee has been and is working on
the problem ol' social regulations
review. 1 deplore publicized ef
forts to nettle and spur the com
mittee on, intimating that its work
is being indifferently performed.
Mr. Beck seems to think of him
self as a champion for Women's
Rights. He would be doing better
to allow the committee to do its
work in peace. The committee
members are. after all, attempt
ing to complete the quarter's
work as well as put in the amount
of time required by the survey
analysis and formulation of
recommendations.
Union Residence's recent peti
tion appears somewhat superflu
ous. I question the feasibility of
"public discussion," called for by
Miss Rohrer, at an AWS mass
meeting. Indeed, if "the delay"
occurs, there would be no reason
for such a meeting. If the results
of the questionnaire and the So
cial Regulations Committee re
port are to be made public, as
promised, then there is no practi
cal reason for such a meeting at
all. In any case, I am certain that
there would be a great deal of in
terest in recommendations sub
milted by Union Residence.
I think that at least a signifi
cant minority would be pleased
by some changes in the present
Social Regs. I think that, at least
by junior year, the Stanford
woman is aware and confident

I enough of herself not to abuse a
i "no hours" policy. Most of those
returning from foreign campuses
! tl cite the German campus as a
personal experience), have al
ready successfully used the pol
icy. The Stanford woman's sense
of responsibility is already recog
nized by the present escalating
hours policy, which culminates
in the required four hour per
| twenty-four lock-in for juniors
and seniors, hardly more than a
token night. I do not believe that
the policy of hours for fresh
men should he changed although
: the freshman hours could well be
(Simplified. In my opinion 1 h e y
I give the freshman woman free
dom enough to "develop her good
| judgment and social maturity."
Personally hoping for a change
in the Social Regs, I believe that
'the committee is taking all opin
ions into account in their analysis
1 and proposals.

Anti "Free Speech"
Dear President Sterling:
As Stanford graduates, we feel
: compelled to write to you regard
ing the student "free speech"
movement. We are horrified to
learn that students have the auda
city to demand "sole jurisdiction
over student affairs and conduct."
| We urge you to maintain a strong
i position in this matter. We feel

that the Board of Trustees and
Ihe Administration must retain
the authority in student discipline.
We read the Stanford Daily
editorial, February 11. entitled
"An Aphorism a Day"and were i
amazed at the obvious immatur-1
ity or misunderstanding of the
writer about the need for freedom
in tlie classroom and freedom out
side of the classroom. I J ei haps we
are "stubborn" too, however, we
believe that education is a "privi
lege and not a right." Were our
children of the age to enter col
lege, we surely would not consider
Stanford under any less adminis
trative supervision of student con-;
duct than is held now. We beg you
not to yield to these student de
mands.
