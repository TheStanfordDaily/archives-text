UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. U.N. Secretary-General U Thant made
a new appeal yesterday for negotiations to end the war in Viet Nam.
He declared for the second time in two days he believes firmly that
it is futile to seek a military solution.
Thant's statement, issued through a spokesman, said he had no
intention of suggesting on Wednesday that the American people are
not well-informed on Viet Nam or that the U.S. government is with
holding information from them about the situation there.
Thant sought to clarify a news conference remark in which he
had said that the American people, if they knew the facts, would
agree with him that further bloodshed is unnecessary in Viet Nam,
and that negotiations alone could create conditions which would en
able the United States to withdraw from that part of the world.

WASHINGTON - The House Judiciary Committee approved a
bill yesterday that would require congressional districts io be nearly
equal in population.
The legislation, which has long been blocked in the committee,
also is aimed at eliminating the weird shapes of gerrymandered dis
tricts by requiring them to be compact and contiguous.
Under the key provision of the bill, no district could contain a
population varying by more than 15 per cent from the population of
the average congressional district in a state. In general, districts
average about 100,000, which would permit a variance of 60,000.
The provision would apply to the next Congress.
Approval was by voice vote after the committee defeated a motion
to permit a 20 percent variance in population.
The bill is regarded as having an excellent chance for House pas
sage.

WASHINGTON - The House Judiciary Committee approved a
bill yesterday that would require congressional districts io be nearly
equal in population.
The legislation, which has long been blocked in the committee,
also is aimed at eliminating the weird shapes of gerrymandered dis
tricts by requiring them to be compact and contiguous.
Under the key provision of the bill, no district could contain a
population varying by more than 15 per cent from the population of
the average congressional district in a state. In general, districts
average about 100,000, which would permit a variance of 60,000.
The provision would apply to the next Congress.
Approval was by voice vote after the committee defeated a motion
to permit a 20 percent variance in population.
The bill is regarded as having an excellent chance for House pas
sage.
