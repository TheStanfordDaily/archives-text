# RED CHINA
## Documentary debuts Tonight 
### 
An hour-long film on Red
China made by a former British
Broadcasting Corporation corre
spondent will make its U.S. debut
today in Memorial Auditorium at
4:15 and 8 p.m.

The documentary was made
from 12 hours of uncensored film
1 brought back from Communist
| China by Felix Greene, author and
a former senior executive of the
BBC.
Greene said this was the first
showing of the film in the United
States, although it has been pre
sented in Canada and Britain. lie
said he picked Stanford for the
debut primarily because he lias
been a resident of Palo Alto for
the past 13 years.
The movie "will be a highly con
troversial film because the Ameri
can public has not been aware of
the fantastic changes that have
taken place in China since 1949,"
Greene stated.
He said it would not l>e consid
ered "controversial" in other
Western nations "who are more
informed about developments in
Communist China."
Greene felt tluil the documen
tary, sponsored by the Interna
tional Club, "covers a great deal
of ground, showing life of the
Chinese in the cities, in the coun
tryside, and many aspects of
communist life today."
"Visually, it is a fast moving
and exciting film."
Greene is the author of two

books on China, "A Curtain of Ig
norance" and "Awakened China,"
and has travelled three times to
that country.
The films from the third trip,
lasting from Oct, 19(53, to Jan.,
19(31. are the basis for the docu
mentary. Greene said he is the
first Westerner to ever have a
television interview with Red
Chinese Premier Chou En-lai.
