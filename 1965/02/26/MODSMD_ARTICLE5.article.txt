## LASSU Takes Sole Judicial jurisdiction 
### THE EDITORIAL STAFF 
The Lejjislatvire passed the
judicial Heform Bill In a vote of
94-18 last nitwit, giving ASSU
"exclusive original judicial juris
diction over student discipli
nary cases.
The bill permits ASSU judicial
j councils to render judgment on
violations of University policy
only when such policy has previ
ously been approved for inclu
sion in the Fundamental Standard
j by a two-thirds vote of LASSU.
BKKOliL approving the bill,
the Legislature heavily defeated
an amendment offered by Ditane
Kennedy of the School of Law. It
would have required that rhe Uni
versity only communicate its pol
l icy to LASSU in order that ASSU
councils recognize that policy.
Robert Sangster of the Law
School, who co-sponsored the bill
with Gary Feldman of the Mathe
matics Department, told the body
that this bill would encourage the
University to "articulate its pol
icy."
He admitted that the adminis
tration could ignore the Legisla
ture's decision on a particular pol
i icy statement, thus bringing
i about a "confrontation between
students and the Administration."
"This bill does not necessitate
any action from the Trustees
aside from making its policy
known to the ASSU President and
the Legislature," ASSU President
Scott McBride told TSs«> Daily.
According to the Constitution,
amendments to it must be ap
proved by the President of t h e
University. However, McBride
; said that By-Laws have changed
[in the past without actions by the
; President.
THIS WAS NOT the case three
years ago when a change in the
liquor policy was adopted by the
student body in a referendum,
land proposed to the Trustees. Tlte
Trustees considered the proposal
and then rejected it.
In other business, a bill permit
ting student publications to ac
cept liquor advertising, with the
intent of increasing revenues, was
passed unanimously.
ASSU President Scott McBride
told the Legislature that such ad
vertising had previously been
: against University policy.
Susan Lewis, a senior from Lag
: unita, reported to 1 he* Legislature
that a caucus of its women mem
bers met yesterday afternoon
and decided to take under consid
eration a measure making upper
class women's social regulations
voluntary.
The matter was referred back
to the women's caucus for addi
tional study, with directions that
it be re-represented at the next
i meeting of the Legislature.
TilK PROPOSAL under study
by most of the caucus called for:
• No distinctions on the basis
! of sex in ihe area of regulations
j for Stanford students.
• Possible mandatory regula
tions for Freshmen and sopho
more women.
• An option for the unrestricted
i classes to live under either t he
present, soon to be reformed, so
cial regulations, or the new policy
regulat ions.
MCBRIDK noted in a statement
to The. Daily after the meeting:
"I witnessed tonight a mile
stone in legislative history at
i Stanford.
"The legislature b\ its oi'dcrh
{and critical discussion of the hill
* evidenced the major premise of
the entile legislature: students are
willing to accept responsibilty.
"Only then can student govern

to the University community."
