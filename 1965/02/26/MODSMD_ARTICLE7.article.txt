# NEWSLETTER REVIEWED
## Are Maoists For Free Love? 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
The second GCC Newsletter,
which today is available for de
posit in the green book bags of
Stanford's alienated malaise, de
scribes with tongue-in-cheek t li c
caricature of sensitive activists as
"Maoist-beatnik-sexual libertine
pseudo-student" neurotics.
Such nomenclature is really
quite unfair, after ali, and avoided
by all. save the Philistines and
prosaic prophets of the "corporate
university."
"Maoist?" The GCC Newsletter
graphically shows that it is not

Maoist, for the latter is limited by
a set of beliefs in the crucible of
which it would like to refashion
society, and for the advancement
of which it seeks change.
IX JAMES SATTEEK'S lead
article "The Free University
Movement" one learns that he is
opposed to alienation and"the ac
quisitive ethos" and is for giving
society a "sense of direction." (liv
ing it simple direction along a de
fined path, is obviously not t|ie
GCC's banana.
He is also against lh< corporate
university which, according to
Paul Goodman, saps the student's
initiative, dampens his sexuality,
and dulls his curiosity. A trium
virate of happenings perhaps
somehow related.
FOR IKA SANDI'EKE tans,
the newsletter contains another
retelling of the gory truth about
Vietnam, about the unpopularity
of its government, about the apop
lexy of its Buddhists, and about
the killing of its masses a I I
brought about by the onl\ "ay
ressor in Vietnam." Referring,
non-maoist icalh we ma\ presume,
to the United States.
"Sexual libertine?" Outside ol
an article by editor Igor Webb,
who spots a threat arisin to the
notion that "sex is healthy" and
"inhibitions . . . harmful" from
a sub-culture ol administrators
(most of whom, we are informed,
are "old maids" t, there is scar
cely any sex at all.
I no IH NT?" ( > I \

the insensitive, or non-revolution
ary. could regard the continually
reoccurring concept of the univer
sity as a strategic homebase as
misdirected, or "pseudo."
For those who can separate the
"Maoist -beat nik-sexua 1 1 i bert i ne
pseudo student" from the . . .
well, the healthy activist, if may
present a useful diversion for an
apathetic Friday afternoon.
