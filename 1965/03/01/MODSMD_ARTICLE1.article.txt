• Heckler Silenced At Muslim Meeting
CHICAGO Elijah Muhammad, standing behind a barrier of
bodies, assured the closing session of the Black Muslim convention
yesterday that the outbreak of violence among Negroes had not made
him shaky.
The violence and threats that began with the assassination last
Sunday of Malcolm X in New York swirled no closer to Muhammad
than a point 70 yards from his platform in the Coliseum.
The disturbance —the only one during the three-day convention
—took place shortly after Muhammad, 67, began a 3-hour 15-minute
speech.
Muhammad's karate-trained Fruit of Islam bodyguards seized
and pummeled a man they said had insulted their leader. Extra
police squads were called to take the injured man, identified as Willie
Greer, 30, of Chicago to a hospital.
