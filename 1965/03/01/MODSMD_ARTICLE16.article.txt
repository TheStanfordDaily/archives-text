the booming kicks of Dick Rags
dale and Bob Blunt. However as |
the game progressed, Cal began to
find holes in the Stanford defense
and blocked a number of punts.

was particularly effective in ha
rassing Stanford kickers.
The first Cal offensive threat
came as a result of a blocked kick.
The blocked punt resulted in a
Stanford knock-on. Stanford con
trolled the ensuing scrum and
Dan Terpack put the ball in
"touch," out of bounds.
However, the Bears won the line
out and worked the ball out, man
by man. to the outside. The Bears
were deep into Card territory be
fore Bob Blunt stopped the Cal
wing with a hard tackle. Up to
this point the game had been |
largely played in Cal territory.

THIS WAS the last Cal scoring
threat and Stanford showed signs
of making a comeback. Ragsdale,
Tim Hansel and Terpack broke
through for repeated gains. Rags
dale almost scored on the 30-yard
romp, but the Indians always
lacked the final offensive punch
needed to cross the goal.
The two Stanford JV teams also

Cal. The No. 1 JV's lost 11-3.
Monty Orr scored the only try for
the Indians on an assist from
