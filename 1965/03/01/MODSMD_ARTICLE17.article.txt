# Cards Survive Bomb Threat, Beat USC
## 
### PETE KING 
It was variety night Saturday
;in Stanford Pavilion. Spectators
: were treated to periods of pre
jgame total darkness (during
; which the USC band energetically
played "Lights Out"), a bomb
scare in the second half which em
ptied the gym for 20 minutes, and
a small-scale riot. Incidentally,
| Stanford downed USC, 87-71, to
I maintain its hopes for second
place in the PAC basketball race.
REBOUNDING after a crush
ing loss to UCLA the night before,
Stanford shot ."53 per cent from
the floor. Forward Bob Bedell led
the Tribe with 23 points, and re
serve center Craig Cordes added
some crucial buckets in the second
half, ending with 16. Kent Hinck
ley scored 20.
With 10:22 left in the game, and
I the Indians leading, 62-51, Stan
! ford police and firemen arrived
i and halted the game. The 2,800
spectators were ordered outside,
leaving only a few tight-lipped,
nervous television announcers in
side desperately trying to stave
off total boredom among 1 heir
viewers.
No bomb was found, and people
were allowed back inside. As play
resumed, USC applied a full-court
press which yielded several In
dian errors. A lay-up off a steal
by USC's Rod Alleman closed the
gap to 68-63 with 5:22 left.
But then Hinckley hit a jumper
and Cordes scored five quick
points to move Stanford safely
ahead, 77-65, and the Tribe
coasted from there.

TROJAN forward Allen Young
shot well all evening, netting 28
points. But .a tremendous defen
sive job by Cordes and Ray Ko
sanke held (JSC's John Block, who
average 21 points a game, to just
three foul shots.
Two arching jumpers by Hinck
ley and a graceful fast-break
dunk by Clayton Raaka boosted
Stanford to an early 7-1 lead.
Then, 18 slraighl Indian points by
Bedell and Kosanke put the In
dians on top, 25-10, with nine
minutes gone.
Bedell hit .11 of 20 from the
floor, and Cordes six of nine. Gary
Loveridge tallied only two free
throws, but had nine assists, as
the Indians employed a breaking
offense. Stanford outrebounded
USC, 43-27, led by Kosanke's 10.
THE VICTORY left Stanford
wit h a 7-5 conference record, only
one game behind second-place
USC, at 8-4.
Just before the varsity game,
the Pavilion lights suddenly
dimmed to half power during a
frosh-junior varsity tussle. While
electricians fiddled with the
wires, the two teams dilated their
eyes and kept playing. The frosh
won in sudden-death overtime, 73-
71.
Before the game resumed fol
lowing the bomb scare, a small
riot developed between the USC
band and Stanford students. The
object in dispute was a Trojan
helmet, although the southland
band wound up minus a trombone
after the brief fight.
