# Committee Changes Scheduling Policy
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
Preference will no longer be given to the Tuesday Evening
Series in the scheduling of campus events on Tuesday nights, ac
cording to a policy decision made last Friday by the Committee
on Public Exercises.
Also abolished was the rule which forbade the scheduling of

meeting or speakers before 4:15"
p.m. Groups may now schedule
anything for any time of day
when there is space available
The committee's action clarified
the role of the committee itself in
saying that it acts only as a
"clearing-house." Application by
a group to sponsor a speaker is
to be discouraged only because of
conflicting demands for space or
time.
A special subcommittee, headed
by Dr. Edwin Zimmerman, rec
ommended eliminating the pre
emptive scheduling of the Tues
day Evening Series because*
• The policy of the committee
is not to make such value judg
ments on Ihc content and quality
of lectures as is implied by the
pre-emptive scheduling.
•There is no justification for
leaving other buildings empty at
the time of the lecture.
• Leaving Tuesday night other
wise free does not necessarily
guarantee a larger audience for
the Tuesday Evening Series.
Until now, this program has
been the only exception to the
general rule of impartiality in
scheduling programs. The Com
mittee has always served, and
will continue to serve, in an ad
visory capacity to avoid bad con
flicts, by pointing out to the
various groups what competition
exists.

In order to reduce red tape in
scheduling, the committee further
proposed the establishment of a
master board in the committee's
office in Encina. This would be
designed to show at a glance the
times and places available for
speakers, and would co-ordinate
the scheduling done by this office
with that ofTresidder.
