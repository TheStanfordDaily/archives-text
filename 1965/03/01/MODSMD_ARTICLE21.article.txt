## Stanford Logical Setting For Evolution Of Ethical Norms 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In a society whose values are
undergoing radical change, new
ethical norms must he permitted
to evolve, and I can think of no
more logical place for this to hap
pen than at a university populated
by the theoretical cream of that
society. Happily, this trend is em
erging at Stanford, and I find it
lamentable that two bearers of
so distinguished a name as Cub
berley should oppose this con
structive event. Surely, they must
realize that the Stanford of today
bears no more resemblance to the
Stanford of their day than theirs
did to Leland Stanford's. Today's
students can handle, and there
fore must have, more responsibil
ity sooner—for their own sake.
Finally, were the hypothetical
Cubberley children insufficiently
mature to select their own college
independent of parental preju
dice, let me hasten to assure their
parents that there would be no
place for them at Stanford.

Editor, The Daily:
I wish to express my respect
for the manner with which th c
students of Stanford University
have conducted themselves during
the events of the last several
weeks. Where students of less
maturity and inferior resolutions
have shown themselves all too
ready to resort immediately to
more violent and extreme means
of protest, Stanford students have
repeatedly demonstrated their
responsibility and sincerity in
relentlessly seeking out the most
effective means of peaceful a n d
constructive change.
Last Thursday LASSU again
showed that the Associated S t u
dents are willing and able to take
responsibility for the actions of
students. Responsibility for one's
own actions is perhaps the most
important part of education, and
I feel certain that the Administra
tion and the Board of Trustees
will cooperate with the Associated
Students in this endeavor.

The path of change is paved
with hot coals. It is more painful
to go slowly, but there is far less
chance of slipping and incinerat
ing the whole cause. The more
extreme means of protest always
exist as alternatives but are recog
nized as the last resort, employed
reluctantly and only in the most
desperate of circumstances. De
mands breed defiance while dec
onstrated concern and responsibil
ity arc welcomed with respect, co
operation, and results.

parents that there would be no
place for them at Stanford.

Editor, The Daily:
I wish to express my respect
for the manner with which th c
students of Stanford University
have conducted themselves during
the events of the last several
weeks. Where students of less
maturity and inferior resolutions
have shown themselves all too
ready to resort immediately to
more violent and extreme means
of protest, Stanford students have
repeatedly demonstrated their
responsibility and sincerity in
relentlessly seeking out the most
effective means of peaceful a n d
constructive change.
Last Thursday LASSU again
showed that the Associated S t u
dents are willing and able to take
responsibility for the actions of
students. Responsibility for one's
own actions is perhaps the most
important part of education, and
I feel certain that the Administra
tion and the Board of Trustees
will cooperate with the Associated
Students in this endeavor.

The path of change is paved
with hot coals. It is more painful
to go slowly, but there is far less
chance of slipping and incinerat
ing the whole cause. The more
extreme means of protest always
exist as alternatives but are recog
nized as the last resort, employed
reluctantly and only in the most
desperate of circumstances. De
mands breed defiance while dec
onstrated concern and responsibil
ity arc welcomed with respect, co
operation, and results.

Editor, The Daily:
In a society whose values are
undergoing radical change, new
ethical norms must he permitted
to evolve, and I can think of no
more logical place for this to hap
pen than at a university populated
by the theoretical cream of that
society. Happily, this trend is em
erging at Stanford, and I find it
lamentable that two bearers of
so distinguished a name as Cub
berley should oppose this con
structive event. Surely, they must
realize that the Stanford of today
bears no more resemblance to the
Stanford of their day than theirs
did to Leland Stanford's. Today's
students can handle, and there
fore must have, more responsibil
ity sooner—for their own sake.
Finally, were the hypothetical
Cubberley children insufficiently
mature to select their own college
independent of parental preju
dice, let me hasten to assure their
parents that there would be no
place for them at Stanford.
