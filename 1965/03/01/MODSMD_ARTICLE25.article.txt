# Born, Not Made
## 
### 
Christians are born, not made, and Christian life is experience
with God, not philosophy or religious speculation. When asked by
a scholar and leader of His day how a man might enter the Kingdom
of God, Jesus told Nicodemus, "Von must be born again (John
3:1-3). To be "born again," (literally in the Greek, "to be born
from above"), is to be regenerated by God—made alive spiritually.
Nicodemus at first confused spiritual birth with the well-known
experience of physical birth ( John 3:4-12), but Jesus emphasized
that the new birth was different—one which every man must ex
perience if lie would know the reality of God in his life.
Spiritual birth is the direct result of personally receiving Jesus
Christ, the word of God: "You have been born anew, not of perish
able seed, but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word
of God; for all flesh is like grass, and all its glorv like the flower of
grass. The grass withers and the flower falls, but the word of the
Lord abides forever. That word is the good news (Gospel) which
was preached to you" (I Peter 1:23-25).
The "new birth' has immediate and long-term consequences in
the life of any individual. What God does for a person the moment
he is spiritually born is to create a new life altogether, for God does
not reform or refine sinners. From God's viewpoint, "If any man
be in Christ he is a new creation, old things are passed away, be
hold all things are become new" (2 Corinlhinians 5:17).
It is one thing to talk about the new birth, to discuss being
born again, and quite another thing to actually experience this
miraculous transformation. Spiritual birth is emphatically real, and
definitely possible for any and all; the only requirement is willing
ness to let Jesus Christ enter one's life. The result ol your decision
will be a real and deeply personal meeting with God resulting in
peace and jov which is not available through am other means.
Have you been born Iroin above? Why not receive Jesus
Christ by faith now. In a moment of time your life can be changed!

he is spiritually born is to create a new life altogether, for God does
not reform or refine sinners. From God's viewpoint, "If any man
be in Christ he is a new creation, old things are passed away, be
hold all things are become new" (2 Corinlhinians 5:17).
It is one thing to talk about the new birth, to discuss being
born again, and quite another thing to actually experience this
miraculous transformation. Spiritual birth is emphatically real, and
definitely possible for any and all; the only requirement is willing
ness to let Jesus Christ enter one's life. The result ol your decision
will be a real and deeply personal meeting with God resulting in
peace and jov which is not available through am other means.
Have you been born Iroin above? Why not receive Jesus
Christ by faith now. In a moment of time your life can be changed!
