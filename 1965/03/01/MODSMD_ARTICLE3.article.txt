# Reaction To Judicial Bill Noncommital
## LIBERAL REGS OFFERED Sterling Wants 'Review, Study, And Discussion' 
### JON ROISE 
The higher echelons of the
j Stanford hierarchy have reacted
with a barrage of neutrality in
response to Thursday's LASSU
resolution approving complete
ASSU jurisdiction over the stu
dent disciplinary process.
President Wallace Sterling said
Friday: "This action by the stu
dent legislature affects the his
; toric delegation of responsibilities
to student government by faculty
and trustees. The action will re
i quire, review, study, and dis
{cussion."
Vice Provost and Dean (if Un
dergraduate Education Robert J.
Wert said that the President, who
is now away at an alumni confer
ence will be meeting with mem
| bers of the faculty before making
any decisions on the matter.
DEAN OF STUDENTS H. Don
ald Winbigler said ho had "no
} comment."
I Richard E. Guggenhime, presi-
I dent of the Stanford Board of
I Trustees, told The Daily last
j night that the matter will prob-
I ably be brought up at the Board's
! next regularly scheduled meeting
I March 18.
Guggenhime stated that he was
| not yet ready to comment on his
J reaction to the LASSU action at
| this time. "I don't have all the
i facts and I don't think that it is
! appropriate to comment prema
j turely," he said.
ASKED IF he thought a special
t meeting would be called before
March 18, he replied, "At the mo
ment there is no plan to hold any
meeting of the Board in advance
of that date."
Prof. Kenneth J. Arrow of the
Department of Economics and a
] member of the Executive Commit
â€¢ toe of ihe Academic Council, said
that the possibility did exist that
Stanford's top faculty group
would look into the implications
of the LASSU bill, but that he
1 knew of "no plans at present" to
j take any specific action.
I "The matter will receive quite
a bit of attention in one form oi

another," ho added.
UNDER THE ASSU Constitu
tion, the judicial bill, which was
passed as a change in the ASSU
By-Laws, needs no official ap
proval either by the University
president or the Board of Trus
tees.
The Board, however, as the
group which granted the Stanford
student body the right of seli
government, could by the same
token veto any action taken by
that government.
Such was the case three years
ago when a liberalized campus
liquor policy was adopted by the
student body in a referendum,
but later vetoed by the Board of
Trustees.
GUGGENHIME also commented
on another LASSU resolution
passed unanimously Friday night
urging the Board of Trustees "to
consider Ihe establishment of a
Committee on Student Affairs, to

be available to student opin
ions. ..."
"ft we think that it's indicated,
cussed yet," he said. "Any sug
gestion that is made will be con
sidered."
The Board at present has
standing committees on invest
ments, finance, academic affairs,
buildings and grounds, planning
and development, and land de
velopment, but none on student
affairs.
According to Guggenhime, dis
cussion on student affairs is at
present channeled through the
Board's Academic Affairs Com
mittee.
THE STUDENT legislature's
action said the judicial councils
shall only appraise student con
duct which may be in violation
of the Associated Student's con
stitution and by-laws or the Fun
damental Standard.
