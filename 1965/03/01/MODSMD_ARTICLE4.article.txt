# BRUINS WIN, 83-67
## Classy UCLA Blitzes Indians 
### PETER EAKLAND 
Before a packed house in the Pavilion Satur
day night, Stanford's cagers had trouble contain
ing the balanced run-and-shoot offense of UCLA in
the first half and, although they played the Bruins
on even terms in the second half, they were routed,
83-67.
UCLA jumped out to a commanding lead as it
had done in the meeting between these two teams
earlier in the year. Coach Howie Dallmar said
after the game that his players were overly tense.
They had trouble locating the hole in the basket
and were passing up good offensive opportunities
once they maneuvered past the Bruin press.
IN CONTRAST to the cautious, inept Card at
tack, the Bruins started quickly and never let up.
They shot as if the basket were a funnel. During
the first half ,three scoring sprees of ten. eight,
and eight points did the Indians in.
Although the Bruins shot a torrid 46 per cent
iti the first half compared to the Indians' 23 per
cent, the main reason for the sizable Uelan lead at
halftime was the strong rebounding at both ends
of the court by Edgar Lacey, Mike Lynn, and Keith
Eriekson. Lacey himself had 14 rebounds at half
time.
Due to strong offensive rebounding, the Bruins
had several shots at the basket each time they
came down count. They took 44 shots in the half,
compared to 26 for Stanford.
FREDDIE C.OSS started the Bruins' momen
tum with six of the Bruins' first eight points. From
there, most of the story was Gail Goodrich, the
conference's leading scorer, who scored 1 < in the
first half. The left-hander converted on numerous
jumpers from outside but also netted several shots
from the crowded inside. Only 6-1, "The Twig"
pulled down eight rebounds during the game, sec
ond only to Lacey.
When the Bruin surge momentarily began to
subside, Coach John Wooden injected Kenny Wash
ington. The injection soon had its effect as the
Bruins boosted their lead from 12 to 28 by half
time. In this stretch, Washington had eight points.
Coming out for the second half hellbent on
proving themselves capable of playing good basket
ball, the Indians started to run with the Bruins
and made good on several fast breaks. As the pace
quickened, the Indians' shooting improved and the
UCLA lead got smaller, although not appreciably
