# Bomb Scare Empties Gym
## 
### 
Stanford police are still in
vestigating the telephone bomb
threat that interrupted Satur
day night s basketball game with
use.
A police officer told a televi
sion announcer that "it Jooked
like an on-campus job," but offi
cers yesterday said this did not
appear to be the case.
A similar telephone threat broke
up a basketball game on the Foot
hill campus Friday night, and
officers speculate that the same
individual may be responsible for
both calls.
ACCORDING to Stanford Po
lice Chief Gordon Davis, the de- !
j partment received a warning at l
9:(H5 p.m. that "a bomb is going j
to go off in the Pavilion in ten
minutes."
No mysterious parcels w ere
I turned up, but a few minutes later
i police decided to evacuate th e
i building in order to give firemen
a chance to make a thorough
search.
In the meantime, the police de
j partment received a second call.'
! A man who identified himself as
! Jim Turner said, "I think my kid
brother may have turned in the
false alarm." He gave officers a ;
telephone number at which his
brother could be reached, but,
that, number proved to be non- j
existent. Chief Davis suggested J
that both calls were made by the i
same person, and officers are
continuing their investigation.
