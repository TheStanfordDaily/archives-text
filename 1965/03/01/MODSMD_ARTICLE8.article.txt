# Mass Meeting To Discuss Compromise
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER Feature Editor 
A compromise proposal for
liberalization of social regula
tions was approved last night in
an eleventh-hour meeting of the
AWS Social Regs Committee.
The new proposal was worked
out in light of the social regs
questionnaire as well as of previ
ous proposals by the Branner
sponsors, the women of Union,
and the legislative sponsors of
last week's LASSU bill.
ACCORDING TO Carol Swan
son, chairman of the committee,
the philosophy is that of "growth
within a minimal framework
Graduation of the regulations by
classes will give women increas
ing amounts of freedom, she said.
The LASSU Women's Caucus
had suggested a revision of the
philosophy behind social regs.
This, according to Susan Lewis,
legislative sponsor of Ihe LASSU
proposal, was intended to "place
the responsibility of social con
duct on the shoulders of the in
dividual, as opposed to the Uni
versity."
The proposal would liberalize
hours for freshman women, for
instance changing the closing
hour to 12 p.m. instead of 10:30.
If the proposal is put into ef
fect, juniors and seniors will have
the option of signing out for 2:30
p.m. or for 8:30 the following
morning. Those who sign out for
8:30 may come in at any time up
to 8:30. A key system would there
fore be used in all women's
houses.
The sign-out procedure would
remain unchanged under the new
proposal. That is, all women will
have to indicate their destination
for purposes of contact in an em
ergency.
Changes in overnight regula
tions would eliminate all require
: ments for chaperones unless sub
ject to ASSU policy. Junior and
senior women would be given un
i limited mid-week overnights.
THE PROPOSAL will be sub
mitted for discussion to the mass
meeting of AWS to be held at 4:30
tomorrow afternoon in the Phy
; sics Tank.
Before coming before LASSU
on Wednesday night, it will be
taken before the living groups
by the House Piesidents and will
lie discussed by the AWS Board
â€¢and by the Undergraduate
Women's Caucus of LASSU Tues
day evening.
Should the proposal be ap
proved by LASSU, it will then be
i channeled to the Committee on
I Student. Affairs on Services for
discussion at its meeting Thurs
, day. The proposal would then go
to the Board of Trustees.
Full details of the proposal will
be available at the mass meeting
today.
"There would seem to be no rea
son why the Legislature would
not enact such a proposal," said
Ed Shaw, speaker of the Legisla
! lure last night.
