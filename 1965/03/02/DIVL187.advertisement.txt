Get into some wised-up
Post-Grads that know where
a crease should always be and
where it should never be, and
how to keep things that way
The reason is the Koratron 1 "
fabric of 65% Dacron*/35%
cotton. No matter how many
timesyouwashandwearthese
trimly tapered Post-Grad
slacks, they'll stay completely
neat and make the iron obso
lete. In tan, clay, black, navy
or loden, $6.98 in poplin or
gabardine, $7.98 in oxford.
At swinging stores.
