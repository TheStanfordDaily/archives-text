I have no hot line to Mississippi, and have not been South since August, but
I have intimations (which I hope are wrong) that the Negro revolution is
entering a harder stage, the patience is running out, That the next long, hot
summer will test the white man s taste for brotherhood in more excrutiating
ways.

In Adam or in Christ?
Regardless of your theory or views concerning the origin of man, there is no
I escaping our universal brotherhood one with another. It you'll give thought and
I prayer to the subject of the family tree of man you'll soon discover that the Biblical
view is diametrically opposed to the hypothesis of an ascending evolution of man
I which skirts around the all-important issue of sin and death. The Bible says we sin
j because wc are "in Adam," decended from our fallen first parents. Death is in the
: world because of sin, that is. because man has been cut oft from his relationship
I with the Author of life, Jesus Christ. The New Testament extends freely to all of
I us today God's offer of reconcilation and restoration to Him. Tn a single sentence
j the problem and the solution can be summed up: "The wages of sin is death, but
I the free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our I/ml" (Romans 6:23), '
As Adam is the federal head of a fallen race, so Jesus Christ, by virtue of His
death and resurrection, has become tin federal head of a New ( reation. Becoming
a Christian remove,- an individual front hi- relationship "in Adam" anil transfer- him
into a new relationship "in Christ." Study the following pa-sage from Romans chapter
5, and then, if you have not yet done -o let Cod place you "in I lirist" today.
"When Adam sinned the entire human race was declared guilty. His sin brought
death into the world, and so everything began to grow old and die. (Wc know that
it was Adam's sin that caused this - and tiot each person dying because of bis own
sins -because although of course people were sinning from the. time of Adam until
.Moses, God did not in those days judge them guilty of death for breaking llis laws
-because lie had not yet given ill> laws to thein. nor told theni what lie wanted
them to do. So when they died it was not for thesi sins of their own; and since they
themselves had never disobeyed God's special law against eating the forbidden fruit,
as Adam had, there dying was not because of that. It wa- because, when Adam
sinned, all of us were declared guilty with hint and began to die because of his sin).
What a. contrast between Adam and Christ Who was yet to come. And what a dif
fretice between man's sin and Cud's forgiveness. For tin- one man, Adam, brought
death to man through hi- -in. Hut- this one man Jesus Christ, brought foregiveness
to many through (iod's mercy. Adam's one sin brought the penalty of death to many,
while Christ freely takes away many -ins and gi\< - itlorioiis life instead.
"The sin of tin- man, Adam, caused death to be king over all, but all who
will take God's gift of forgiveness and approval are kings of life because of this
one man. Jesus Christ. Yes Adam's sin brought punishment to all, but Christ's act
of goodness makes men right with Cod, so that tliey can live. Adam caused many
to be sinners because he disobeyed Cod, and ("lirist caused many to be made accept
| able to Cod because he obeyed. The 'IVn Commandment: were eiveii so that all could
see the extent ot their failure to obey (iod's laws. Hut the inoie wi see out! sinfulness,
the more we see God's abounding grace forgiving us. And so sin ruled over men,
all men and brought them to death, but now God's kindness rules instead, giving us
right standing with God and resulting in eternal lit' through Jesus t lirist, our Lord."
