• India, Poland Criticize L,S,
LONDON — India has joined Poland iri
sharp criticism of American reprisal bombings
of Communist North Viet Nam, qualified West
ern diplomats reported yesterday.
Canada has defended the American raids
as justifiable, these sources said.
India, Poland and Canada make up the In
ternational Control Commission assigned un
der the 1954 Geneva agreement to supervise
the workings of the peace. Judgments of the
three countries were embodied in a special
report to the British and Soviet governments
which presided over the 1954 conference.
India and Poland claimed they could find
no evidence to confirm the justifications off
ered by the Americans for ordering the bomb
ings that the Hanoi regime has been direct
ing Viet Cong aggressions in the south and
that there has been "continuing infiltration of
personnel and equipment" from the north.

Canada held that evidence of such infiltra
tion has been established and that Hanoi's
links with the Viet Cong could not be chal
lenged.

• Johnson May Visit Russia
WASHINGTON — The White House indi
cated yesterday that it still would welcome an
exchange of visits this year between Presi
dent Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosy
gin.
It did so by saying "there has been no
change in the situation" since a speech by
President Johnson February 3.
In that speech to the Anti-defamation
League, Johnson said: "I have reason to be
lieve that the Soviet leadership would welcome
my visit to their country—as I would be very
glad to do. I am hopeful that before this year
is out this exchange of visits between us may
occur."
The White House version of steps looking

toward an exchange of visits between John
son and Kosygin disagreed with Kosygin's
version.
Kosygin indicated to Western newsmen in
Leipzig, Germany, yesterday that he had in
vited Johnson to visit the Soviet Union two
months ago and that he had received no reply.
