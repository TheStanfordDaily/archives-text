# Controversy Over Social Regs: Venerable Stanford Tradition
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Associate Editor 
Administrators never tire of telling students
that nothing new ever happens at this campus;
that every several years the same problems keep
coming up.
Social regulations are a good case in point
it's all been said before, like in 1927 and 1930, al
l hough its unlikely that the current Administra
tors were around then, or if they were, that they
would admit it.
The 1927 controversy began in May with cut
backs in the social regulations announced by Wom
en's Conference, the predecessor of AWS, appar
ently because of previous lack of enforcement of
the rules.
By May 19 The Daily had faced the issue head
on, both in an editorial, "The Winds of Freedom
Blow," and in the student column, "Bull Session"
written by Stephen O'Donnell. A "Stanford
Mother" counterattacked in the same issue.
An Age Of Prudery
Concluded the editorial, "This is no longer an
age of prudery and false respectability; it is an
age of responsible freedom. It is surprising that
Stanford women are so slow in demanding this
freedom."
The "Stanford Mother" commenting on O'Don
nell's column the day before on the possibility
of Administration pressure in setting social regs,
answered, "If the rules to which Mr. O'Donnell ob
jects do eminate from the office of the Dean of
Women, that is quite sufficient to hall-mark them,
for everybody who knows Stanford at all, knows
that the Dean is the kindest, wisest, most impartial
and most sympathetic Dean any university could
have. She is a tower of strength, a comfort and an
inspiration to every woman on the campus.
"The women know the rules and if they are
not willing to obey them and so help in keeping
up the high reputation Stafford women rightfully
enjoy, they are free to go elsewhere, where the
rules are more to their taste."
Overflowing Wil li Life
Some Stanford girls were compared in the let
ter to young colts, "overflowing with life and vigor,
and these forces, for the good of their owners and
everybody else must be bridled and trained in the
right direction." [The good Dean referred to in
the letter is Miss Mary Yost, who no longer holds
the position. 1
The next day the AWS President made a state
ment concluding, "May we remind the women that
our present rules were adopted by them [the Ad
ministration! only last quarter. At that time every
effort was made to get suggestions. That was the
time to bring out criticisms and new ideas, but
we arc always glad of them.
"Council and Conference are the first to wel
come a more alert public opinion among the
women."
"A Stanford Man" shared the letters to the
editor section of the paper with the AWS President.
He remarked that the University "should not have
to tell them 11he women | when to come in at night.
If a woman, intellectual enough to come to college,
does not know how to care for herself, both mor
ally and physically, she should go back home.
Sit Around And Squawk
"This is neither the eighteenth nor the nine
teenth century. It is today. . .. The Women's Coun
cil must find itself in a very embarrassing situa
tion, for it allows the women of the University to
smoke—ssh, upstairs and in private—yet it de
mands that they be at home by 10:30 (Three hours
later by special permission). ... So the fault lies
with the women themselves. They sit around and
squawk and talk a lot, but they do not do a thing
to alleviate the present conditions. If women don't
know how to care for themselves when in college,
they never will."
Monday, May 23, The Daily ran opposing feel
ings by Dean Yost and Dr. Margery Baily of the
English Department. Dean Yost took the stand
that if the women wished to think about changing

the rules they could, but that it was too late in the
year to take any immediate action.
Dr. Baily stated, somewhat more strongly, "The
women of this University should abolish rules
which both the men and women 01 Stanford know
to be fit only for the government of little girls,
and which are moreover the cause of constant an
noyance and ill feeling, and the opportunity of a
great deal of that small tyranny which is inseper
able from the administration of petty rules."
After commenting on recent changes in the
status of women, she said, "A third type, the girls
who want to live all their lives exactly as they lived
in the nursery merely because they have been told
it is proper, and who want everybody else to live
in the same way, frequently form the group that
in any self-governing student body likes to make
the laws. This is in 110 way to bo construed as
criticism of the present Women's Council or of the
Council just preceding, both of which appear to
be open-minded and willing to take sugges
tions. ..."
Self-Respecting Human Beings
"It is at once gratifying and somewhat amus
ing to see that it is Stanford men who appear in
their proper light as self-respecting and inherently
decent adult human beings."
Finally a study was instituted by the AWS.
One reader wrote to The Dally, proposing a plan
she believed would "do away with much of the ex
isting discontent . . . and at the same time would
not be so radical as to arouse the ire of campus
authorities, the frown of outraged convention, the
curse of yellow press publicity, 01* any other evil"
Although pointing out that most students were
concerned not with hours, but with the system
itself, she said, "Looking at the case from a purely
practical standpoint, however, it is evident that
lockouts will never be entirely done away with
during our college career. All the forces of present
day convention are against it." But her proposal
of a standard 11:30 p.m. lockout, except for first
quarter freshmen who would get 10:30's, automatic
weekend l:30's, with 2 a.m. by special permission,
and accumulative time before punishment was ac
cepted only in part.
The Most Liberal In The Country
Nine months later the student agitation finally
resulted in some changes, making the rules ac
cording to The Daily "among the most liberal in
the Universities and colleges of the country." The
women got a unrestricted l:30's on weekends (b)
permission for men to stay in women's residences
until 1:30 on weekends (c) permission for fresh
man women to "motor after dark in groups of
four 01* more" and (d) permission for "two or
more" women to enter a men's living group.
At that time, according to a Daily editorial, only
Cal among thirty of the best, known universities
permitted its women to stay out later, and then
only until 2 a.m. At Tennessee there was a regula
tion that "no less than two couples may go boating,
driving, or drinking in a public place." Only one
other school specifically permitted women to
smoke.
Denison College in Granville, Ohio, had possibly
the strictest regulations at that time. According
to The Daily, Denison had a 10 p.m. lookout on
weekdays, extended to 10:30 p.m. on weekends.
Other rules included the following:
To See A 31 an On Business
If a girl had to see a man on business for longer
than 10 minutes she had to register with the house
president. Freshmen were limited to two social
engagements a week, one of which had to be listed
on the school calender. Two couples could attend
the theater on Saturday afternoon provided they
registered beforehand in the Dean's Office. Two
couples could attend the theater in the evening, if
registered and if accompanied by a senior on wom
en's council or a house president.
"So, after all," said The Daily, "The Stanford
women aren't as hemmed in as they might be."

the rules.
By May 19 The Daily had faced the issue head
on, both in an editorial, "The Winds of Freedom
Blow," and in the student column, "Bull Session"
written by Stephen O'Donnell. A "Stanford
Mother" counterattacked in the same issue.
An Age Of Prudery
Concluded the editorial, "This is no longer an
age of prudery and false respectability; it is an
age of responsible freedom. It is surprising that
Stanford women are so slow in demanding this
freedom."
The "Stanford Mother" commenting on O'Don
nell's column the day before on the possibility
of Administration pressure in setting social regs,
answered, "If the rules to which Mr. O'Donnell ob
jects do eminate from the office of the Dean of
Women, that is quite sufficient to hall-mark them,
for everybody who knows Stanford at all, knows
that the Dean is the kindest, wisest, most impartial
and most sympathetic Dean any university could
have. She is a tower of strength, a comfort and an
inspiration to every woman on the campus.
"The women know the rules and if they are
not willing to obey them and so help in keeping
up the high reputation Stafford women rightfully
enjoy, they are free to go elsewhere, where the
rules are more to their taste."
Overflowing Wil li Life
Some Stanford girls were compared in the let
ter to young colts, "overflowing with life and vigor,
and these forces, for the good of their owners and
everybody else must be bridled and trained in the
right direction." [The good Dean referred to in
the letter is Miss Mary Yost, who no longer holds
the position. 1
The next day the AWS President made a state
ment concluding, "May we remind the women that
our present rules were adopted by them [the Ad
ministration! only last quarter. At that time every
effort was made to get suggestions. That was the
time to bring out criticisms and new ideas, but
we arc always glad of them.
"Council and Conference are the first to wel
come a more alert public opinion among the
women."
"A Stanford Man" shared the letters to the
editor section of the paper with the AWS President.
He remarked that the University "should not have
to tell them 11he women | when to come in at night.
If a woman, intellectual enough to come to college,
does not know how to care for herself, both mor
ally and physically, she should go back home.
Sit Around And Squawk
"This is neither the eighteenth nor the nine
teenth century. It is today. . .. The Women's Coun
cil must find itself in a very embarrassing situa
tion, for it allows the women of the University to
smoke—ssh, upstairs and in private—yet it de
mands that they be at home by 10:30 (Three hours
later by special permission). ... So the fault lies
with the women themselves. They sit around and
squawk and talk a lot, but they do not do a thing
to alleviate the present conditions. If women don't
know how to care for themselves when in college,
they never will."
Monday, May 23, The Daily ran opposing feel
ings by Dean Yost and Dr. Margery Baily of the
English Department. Dean Yost took the stand
that if the women wished to think about changing

the rules they could, but that it was too late in the
year to take any immediate action.
Dr. Baily stated, somewhat more strongly, "The
women of this University should abolish rules
which both the men and women 01 Stanford know
to be fit only for the government of little girls,
and which are moreover the cause of constant an
noyance and ill feeling, and the opportunity of a
great deal of that small tyranny which is inseper
able from the administration of petty rules."
After commenting on recent changes in the
status of women, she said, "A third type, the girls
who want to live all their lives exactly as they lived
in the nursery merely because they have been told
it is proper, and who want everybody else to live
in the same way, frequently form the group that
in any self-governing student body likes to make
the laws. This is in 110 way to bo construed as
criticism of the present Women's Council or of the
Council just preceding, both of which appear to
be open-minded and willing to take sugges
tions. ..."
Self-Respecting Human Beings
"It is at once gratifying and somewhat amus
ing to see that it is Stanford men who appear in
their proper light as self-respecting and inherently
decent adult human beings."
Finally a study was instituted by the AWS.
One reader wrote to The Dally, proposing a plan
she believed would "do away with much of the ex
isting discontent . . . and at the same time would
not be so radical as to arouse the ire of campus
authorities, the frown of outraged convention, the
curse of yellow press publicity, 01* any other evil"
Although pointing out that most students were
concerned not with hours, but with the system
itself, she said, "Looking at the case from a purely
practical standpoint, however, it is evident that
lockouts will never be entirely done away with
during our college career. All the forces of present
day convention are against it." But her proposal
of a standard 11:30 p.m. lockout, except for first
quarter freshmen who would get 10:30's, automatic
weekend l:30's, with 2 a.m. by special permission,
and accumulative time before punishment was ac
cepted only in part.
The Most Liberal In The Country
Nine months later the student agitation finally
resulted in some changes, making the rules ac
cording to The Daily "among the most liberal in
the Universities and colleges of the country." The
women got a unrestricted l:30's on weekends (b)
permission for men to stay in women's residences
until 1:30 on weekends (c) permission for fresh
man women to "motor after dark in groups of
four 01* more" and (d) permission for "two or
more" women to enter a men's living group.
At that time, according to a Daily editorial, only
Cal among thirty of the best, known universities
permitted its women to stay out later, and then
only until 2 a.m. At Tennessee there was a regula
tion that "no less than two couples may go boating,
driving, or drinking in a public place." Only one
other school specifically permitted women to
smoke.
Denison College in Granville, Ohio, had possibly
the strictest regulations at that time. According
to The Daily, Denison had a 10 p.m. lookout on
weekdays, extended to 10:30 p.m. on weekends.
Other rules included the following:
To See A 31 an On Business
If a girl had to see a man on business for longer
than 10 minutes she had to register with the house
president. Freshmen were limited to two social
engagements a week, one of which had to be listed
on the school calender. Two couples could attend
the theater on Saturday afternoon provided they
registered beforehand in the Dean's Office. Two
couples could attend the theater in the evening, if
registered and if accompanied by a senior on wom
en's council or a house president.
"So, after all," said The Daily, "The Stanford
women aren't as hemmed in as they might be."

of Administration pressure in setting social regs,
answered, "If the rules to which Mr. O'Donnell ob
jects do eminate from the office of the Dean of
Women, that is quite sufficient to hall-mark them,
for everybody who knows Stanford at all, knows
that the Dean is the kindest, wisest, most impartial
and most sympathetic Dean any university could
have. She is a tower of strength, a comfort and an
inspiration to every woman on the campus.
"The women know the rules and if they are
not willing to obey them and so help in keeping
up the high reputation Stafford women rightfully
enjoy, they are free to go elsewhere, where the
rules are more to their taste."
Overflowing Wil li Life
Some Stanford girls were compared in the let
ter to young colts, "overflowing with life and vigor,
and these forces, for the good of their owners and
everybody else must be bridled and trained in the
right direction." [The good Dean referred to in
the letter is Miss Mary Yost, who no longer holds
the position. 1
The next day the AWS President made a state
ment concluding, "May we remind the women that
our present rules were adopted by them [the Ad
ministration! only last quarter. At that time every
effort was made to get suggestions. That was the
time to bring out criticisms and new ideas, but
we arc always glad of them.
"Council and Conference are the first to wel
come a more alert public opinion among the
women."
"A Stanford Man" shared the letters to the
editor section of the paper with the AWS President.
He remarked that the University "should not have
to tell them 11he women | when to come in at night.
If a woman, intellectual enough to come to college,
does not know how to care for herself, both mor
ally and physically, she should go back home.
Sit Around And Squawk
"This is neither the eighteenth nor the nine
teenth century. It is today. . .. The Women's Coun
cil must find itself in a very embarrassing situa
tion, for it allows the women of the University to
smoke—ssh, upstairs and in private—yet it de
mands that they be at home by 10:30 (Three hours
later by special permission). ... So the fault lies
with the women themselves. They sit around and
squawk and talk a lot, but they do not do a thing
to alleviate the present conditions. If women don't
know how to care for themselves when in college,
they never will."
Monday, May 23, The Daily ran opposing feel
ings by Dean Yost and Dr. Margery Baily of the
English Department. Dean Yost took the stand
that if the women wished to think about changing

the rules they could, but that it was too late in the
year to take any immediate action.
Dr. Baily stated, somewhat more strongly, "The
women of this University should abolish rules
which both the men and women 01 Stanford know
to be fit only for the government of little girls,
and which are moreover the cause of constant an
noyance and ill feeling, and the opportunity of a
great deal of that small tyranny which is inseper
able from the administration of petty rules."
After commenting on recent changes in the
status of women, she said, "A third type, the girls
who want to live all their lives exactly as they lived
in the nursery merely because they have been told
it is proper, and who want everybody else to live
in the same way, frequently form the group that
in any self-governing student body likes to make
the laws. This is in 110 way to bo construed as
criticism of the present Women's Council or of the
Council just preceding, both of which appear to
be open-minded and willing to take sugges
tions. ..."
Self-Respecting Human Beings
"It is at once gratifying and somewhat amus
ing to see that it is Stanford men who appear in
their proper light as self-respecting and inherently
decent adult human beings."
Finally a study was instituted by the AWS.
One reader wrote to The Dally, proposing a plan
she believed would "do away with much of the ex
isting discontent . . . and at the same time would
not be so radical as to arouse the ire of campus
authorities, the frown of outraged convention, the
curse of yellow press publicity, 01* any other evil"
Although pointing out that most students were
concerned not with hours, but with the system
itself, she said, "Looking at the case from a purely
practical standpoint, however, it is evident that
lockouts will never be entirely done away with
during our college career. All the forces of present
day convention are against it." But her proposal
of a standard 11:30 p.m. lockout, except for first
quarter freshmen who would get 10:30's, automatic
weekend l:30's, with 2 a.m. by special permission,
and accumulative time before punishment was ac
cepted only in part.
The Most Liberal In The Country
Nine months later the student agitation finally
resulted in some changes, making the rules ac
cording to The Daily "among the most liberal in
the Universities and colleges of the country." The
women got a unrestricted l:30's on weekends (b)
permission for men to stay in women's residences
until 1:30 on weekends (c) permission for fresh
man women to "motor after dark in groups of
four 01* more" and (d) permission for "two or
more" women to enter a men's living group.
At that time, according to a Daily editorial, only
Cal among thirty of the best, known universities
permitted its women to stay out later, and then
only until 2 a.m. At Tennessee there was a regula
tion that "no less than two couples may go boating,
driving, or drinking in a public place." Only one
other school specifically permitted women to
smoke.
Denison College in Granville, Ohio, had possibly
the strictest regulations at that time. According
to The Daily, Denison had a 10 p.m. lookout on
weekdays, extended to 10:30 p.m. on weekends.
Other rules included the following:
To See A 31 an On Business
If a girl had to see a man on business for longer
than 10 minutes she had to register with the house
president. Freshmen were limited to two social
engagements a week, one of which had to be listed
on the school calender. Two couples could attend
the theater on Saturday afternoon provided they
registered beforehand in the Dean's Office. Two
couples could attend the theater in the evening, if
registered and if accompanied by a senior on wom
en's council or a house president.
"So, after all," said The Daily, "The Stanford
women aren't as hemmed in as they might be."

Administrators never tire of telling students
that nothing new ever happens at this campus;
that every several years the same problems keep

Social regulations are a good case in point
it's all been said before, like in 1927 and 1930, al

The 1927 controversy began in May with cut
backs in the social regulations announced by Wom

ently because of previous lack of enforcement of
the rules.
By May 19 The Daily had faced the issue head
on, both in an editorial, "The Winds of Freedom
Blow," and in the student column, "Bull Session"
written by Stephen O'Donnell. A "Stanford

enjoy, they are free to go elsewhere, where the
rules are more to their taste."
Overflowing Wil li Life
Some Stanford girls were compared in the let
ter to young colts, "overflowing with life and vigor,
and these forces, for the good of their owners and
everybody else must be bridled and trained in the
right direction." [The good Dean referred to in
the letter is Miss Mary Yost, who no longer holds
the position. 1
The next day the AWS President made a state
ment concluding, "May we remind the women that
our present rules were adopted by them [the Ad
ministration! only last quarter. At that time every
effort was made to get suggestions. That was the
time to bring out criticisms and new ideas, but
we arc always glad of them.
"Council and Conference are the first to wel
come a more alert public opinion among the
women."
"A Stanford Man" shared the letters to the
editor section of the paper with the AWS President.
He remarked that the University "should not have
to tell them 11he women | when to come in at night.
If a woman, intellectual enough to come to college,
does not know how to care for herself, both mor
ally and physically, she should go back home.
Sit Around And Squawk
"This is neither the eighteenth nor the nine
teenth century. It is today. . .. The Women's Coun
cil must find itself in a very embarrassing situa
tion, for it allows the women of the University to
smoke—ssh, upstairs and in private—yet it de
mands that they be at home by 10:30 (Three hours
later by special permission). ... So the fault lies
with the women themselves. They sit around and
squawk and talk a lot, but they do not do a thing
to alleviate the present conditions. If women don't
know how to care for themselves when in college,
they never will."
Monday, May 23, The Daily ran opposing feel
ings by Dean Yost and Dr. Margery Baily of the
English Department. Dean Yost took the stand
that if the women wished to think about changing

the rules they could, but that it was too late in the
year to take any immediate action.
Dr. Baily stated, somewhat more strongly, "The
women of this University should abolish rules
which both the men and women 01 Stanford know
to be fit only for the government of little girls,
and which are moreover the cause of constant an
noyance and ill feeling, and the opportunity of a
great deal of that small tyranny which is inseper
able from the administration of petty rules."
After commenting on recent changes in the
status of women, she said, "A third type, the girls
who want to live all their lives exactly as they lived
in the nursery merely because they have been told
it is proper, and who want everybody else to live
in the same way, frequently form the group that
in any self-governing student body likes to make
the laws. This is in 110 way to bo construed as
criticism of the present Women's Council or of the
Council just preceding, both of which appear to
be open-minded and willing to take sugges
tions. ..."
Self-Respecting Human Beings
"It is at once gratifying and somewhat amus
ing to see that it is Stanford men who appear in
their proper light as self-respecting and inherently
decent adult human beings."
Finally a study was instituted by the AWS.
One reader wrote to The Dally, proposing a plan
she believed would "do away with much of the ex
isting discontent . . . and at the same time would
not be so radical as to arouse the ire of campus
authorities, the frown of outraged convention, the
curse of yellow press publicity, 01* any other evil"
Although pointing out that most students were
concerned not with hours, but with the system
itself, she said, "Looking at the case from a purely
practical standpoint, however, it is evident that
lockouts will never be entirely done away with
during our college career. All the forces of present
day convention are against it." But her proposal
of a standard 11:30 p.m. lockout, except for first
quarter freshmen who would get 10:30's, automatic
weekend l:30's, with 2 a.m. by special permission,
and accumulative time before punishment was ac
cepted only in part.
The Most Liberal In The Country
Nine months later the student agitation finally
resulted in some changes, making the rules ac
cording to The Daily "among the most liberal in
the Universities and colleges of the country." The
women got a unrestricted l:30's on weekends (b)
permission for men to stay in women's residences
until 1:30 on weekends (c) permission for fresh
man women to "motor after dark in groups of
four 01* more" and (d) permission for "two or
more" women to enter a men's living group.
At that time, according to a Daily editorial, only
Cal among thirty of the best, known universities
permitted its women to stay out later, and then
only until 2 a.m. At Tennessee there was a regula
tion that "no less than two couples may go boating,
driving, or drinking in a public place." Only one
other school specifically permitted women to
smoke.
Denison College in Granville, Ohio, had possibly
the strictest regulations at that time. According
to The Daily, Denison had a 10 p.m. lookout on
weekdays, extended to 10:30 p.m. on weekends.
Other rules included the following:
To See A 31 an On Business
If a girl had to see a man on business for longer
than 10 minutes she had to register with the house
president. Freshmen were limited to two social
engagements a week, one of which had to be listed
on the school calender. Two couples could attend
the theater on Saturday afternoon provided they
registered beforehand in the Dean's Office. Two
couples could attend the theater in the evening, if
registered and if accompanied by a senior on wom
en's council or a house president.
"So, after all," said The Daily, "The Stanford
women aren't as hemmed in as they might be."
(To B<* Continued Tomorrow)
Administrators never tire of telling students
that nothing new ever happens at this campus;
that every several years the same problems keep
coming up.
Social regulations are a good case in point
it's all been said before, like in 1927 and 1930, al
l hough its unlikely that the current Administra
tors were around then, or if they were, that they
would admit it.
The 1927 controversy began in May with cut
backs in the social regulations announced by Wom
en's Conference, the predecessor of AWS, appar
ently because of previous lack of enforcement of
the rules.
By May 19 The Daily had faced the issue head
on, both in an editorial, "The Winds of Freedom
Blow," and in the student column, "Bull Session"
written by Stephen O'Donnell. A "Stanford
Mother" counterattacked in the same issue.
An Age Of Prudery
Concluded the editorial, "This is no longer an
age of prudery and false respectability; it is an
age of responsible freedom. It is surprising that
Stanford women are so slow in demanding this
freedom."
The "Stanford Mother" commenting on O'Don
nell's column the day before on the possibility
of Administration pressure in setting social regs,
answered, "If the rules to which Mr. O'Donnell ob
jects do eminate from the office of the Dean of
Women, that is quite sufficient to hall-mark them,
for everybody who knows Stanford at all, knows
that the Dean is the kindest, wisest, most impartial
and most sympathetic Dean any university could
have. She is a tower of strength, a comfort and an
inspiration to every woman on the campus.
"The women know the rules and if they are
not willing to obey them and so help in keeping
up the high reputation Stafford women rightfully
enjoy, they are free to go elsewhere, where the
rules are more to their taste."
