# Third Dean Announces Resignation
## Women Approve New Regulations 
### JON ROIE MARY KAY BECKER 
I lie new social regulations pro
posal went through the first of
many channels at the AWS mass
meeting yesterday with little ob
jection except in the area of
hours lor freshman women.
After the meeting Judy Bart
let t and Cia White of Roble sub
mitted an amendment to Miss
Swanson, calling for more liberal
ized regulations for freshman and
sophomore women.
."MISS SWANSON said the sug
gested amendment would be con
sidered at tonight's meeting of
her committee
An amendment introduced by
Fran McArthur. a former Roble
sponsor, to "instruct the Social
Regulations Committee to recom
mend approval of the proposal by
April 1, 1965," was passed heavily
after a short period of parliamen
tary chaos.
The body then voted on individ
ual sections of the actual proposal.
The first section, dealing with
overnight policy, was passed with
few dissenting votes.
In the voting and discussion on
the second section, concerning
hours, a bloc of freshmen and
sophomores expressed some dis

satisfaction with the proposal.
INSTEAD OF having 30 and 35
late leaves respectively in Winter
and Spring Quarters as they do
now, freshmen would have 25 late
leaves throughout/the year.
As Miss Swanson pointed out,
however, the new proposal also in
cludes the extension of closing
hours for freshmen from 10:30 to
12:00. The reasoning behind the
proposal, she said, was that this
would reduce the number of late
leaves used up now between 10:30
and midnight.
The freshman request for more
liberal rules asked that:
• Second-quarter frcshm en
have 35 2:3o's.
• Third-quarter freshmen
have unlimited 2:3o's.
• Rules for sophomores be the
same as the rules for juniors and
seniors.
THE REQUEST added, "We be
lieve these to be valid changes
that will be met with maturity
and responsibility on the part of
the persons involved."
Miss White said that the rules
suggested for freshmen did no t
conform to the stated philosophy
behind the changes: to allow the
women to "experience increasing
amounts of freedom — with the
ultimate goal being that of per

sonal decision in all areas."
"The philosophy of gradual
growth of social responsibility is
ignored for freshmen," Miss
White said.
MISS BARTLETT added. "Our
main complaint is that we'll have
fewer late leaves second and third
quarters than we do now. We dis
agree with the assumption that
we should have fewer late leaves
because of the later lock-out. It's
completely irrelevant."
The section on freshmen hours
was passed by a vote of 105-67, the
closest of the votes taken and the
only one officially counted.
There was also discussion of
the reasons for leaving the hours
for first-quarter sophomores un
changed, that is, 35 late leaves, all
2:3o's.
They are given unlimited late
leaves for the rest of the year.
TIIE MAIN REASON, Miss
Swanson explained, was that mov
ing into upperclass dorms puts a
great deal of pressure on sopho
mores, since "juniors and seniors
have learned to study in such a
fashion that it looks like they
never study."
After the meeting. AWS Presi
dent Chana Chiba told The Daily
that under the new regulations it
would be possible for junior and
senior women to live off campus.
A woman wishing to do so would
have to sign out at the beginning
of each quarter for its duration,
and then sign back in at the quar
ter's end, she said.
MISS CHIBA acknowledged
that such a policy would be fi
nancially discriminatory against
less affluent students, as a wom
an living off campus would still
have to pay on-campus room and
board.
An informal poll of the wom
en's residences taken last night
after house meetings indicated
strong support from each house
for the proposal.
