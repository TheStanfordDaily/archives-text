## U.S. Goal: Neo-Colonialism Vs. Ideological Globalism 
### Walter Lippmann 
The debate about Vietnam is taking place ainicl uncertainty
and confusion about our over-all foreign policy. The practical
questions which have to be decided turn principally on where and
in what manner the military power of the United States should be
engaged on the Asian continent and on the African continent.

The issue of foreign policy in" 1
Vietnam is whether our military
commitments on the Asian main
land are overextended and should
be reduced or whether they a r e j
not extended enough and should
be widened, deepened and en
larged.
Underlying these questions
there is a passionate emotional
issue. It is whether the security
of the United States, which must
be the primary preoccupation of
U.S. foreign policy, depends on a
limited or 011 an unlimited en
gagement of our military power.
A limited engagement of mili
tary power is one which is made
only when our vital interest is
clear and our military capacity is
idequate. This view of things is
now called "neo-isolationism" be- ]
cause it differs from a commit
ment to engage our forces any
where. be it in Vietnam or in the
Congo, where freedom as we un
derstand it is threatened by Com
munists. 11 the first of these
views is neo-isolationism, the
second is ideological globalism.
Isolationist Policy
Until after the fall of France
in 1940 and t he Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor in 1941, our pol
icy was genuinely isolationist.
This policy was breached during
the m ont hs when Winston
Churchill's England stood alone
against the victorious Nazis. The
breach was made by President
Roosevelt's circumvention of the
neutrality policy, first by lending
Britain 50 destroyers and then by
persuading Congress to enact the
, Lend Lease Act:.
The problem of our foreign pol
icy today will not be fully under
stood until historians explain how
our intervention in the second
world war to defeat t he Nazis and
the Japanese became inflated into
the so-called Truman Doctrine of
the late 1940's, in which the United
[States said it was committing
itself to a global ideological strug
gle against revolutionary com
munism.
For it is this global commit
ment which is at the root of our
difficulty in appraising cooly the
extent and the importance of our
engagement in Vietnam. Thus,
I there are men saying today that

the defense of Saigon is the de
fense of Hawaii and that a truce
rather than a "victory" in Indo-
IChina will determine the fate of
the world and the position of the
United States as a great power j
and the safety of West Berlin and
so forth. For those who think this
way, there is no stopping point
between globalism and a retreat
into our former isolationism.
A Stopping Point
I think there is a.stopping point
between globalism and isolation-j
ism. The test of statesmanship is
to find those stopping points and
act accordingly.
For example, I read that it is
our duty and interest to resist
communism with force wherever
it is advancing with force and
that no price is too heavy to pay
for the fulfillment of that duty.
But in spite of all these declara
tions the fact is that the United
States did not intervene to resist
the Chinese conquest of Tibet, as
naked a case of aggression as any
we have seen. Why not? For the
i good and sufficient reasons that
j the United States could not reach
Tibet in order to defend it. And
: what is more, that Tibet is not a
j vital interest of the United States
'for which the President has the
right to spend American lives.
For another reason, take Ber
lin. There was an uprising in 1933,
and on ideological grounds alone
we should have supported the in
surrection and even incited it. On
the contrary, we did what we
could to damp it down, not wish
ing to trigger a world war by a
pitched battle in Berlin.
These examples show that put
to the test our officials have acted
more wisely than they have
talked, that put to the test they
have been statesmen and n o t
ideological crusaders.
For my part, I admire the pub
lic men who play it cool and do
not bend their judgment to the ex
hortations of the globalists. I am
confident, moreover, that in the
issues of war and peace the safe
course is to make a judgment
as to where is the balance of our
interests and our power, and hav
ing made that judgment to choose
decisively.

in what manner the military power of the United States should be
engaged on the Asian continent and on the African continent.

The issue of foreign policy in" 1
Vietnam is whether our military
commitments on the Asian main
land are overextended and should
be reduced or whether they a r e j
not extended enough and should
be widened, deepened and en
larged.
Underlying these questions
there is a passionate emotional
issue. It is whether the security
of the United States, which must
be the primary preoccupation of
U.S. foreign policy, depends on a
limited or 011 an unlimited en
gagement of our military power.
A limited engagement of mili
tary power is one which is made
only when our vital interest is
clear and our military capacity is
idequate. This view of things is
now called "neo-isolationism" be- ]
cause it differs from a commit
ment to engage our forces any
where. be it in Vietnam or in the
Congo, where freedom as we un
derstand it is threatened by Com
munists. 11 the first of these
views is neo-isolationism, the
second is ideological globalism.
Isolationist Policy
Until after the fall of France
in 1940 and t he Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor in 1941, our pol
icy was genuinely isolationist.
This policy was breached during
the m ont hs when Winston
Churchill's England stood alone
against the victorious Nazis. The
breach was made by President
Roosevelt's circumvention of the
neutrality policy, first by lending
Britain 50 destroyers and then by
persuading Congress to enact the
, Lend Lease Act:.
The problem of our foreign pol
icy today will not be fully under
stood until historians explain how
our intervention in the second
world war to defeat t he Nazis and
the Japanese became inflated into
the so-called Truman Doctrine of
the late 1940's, in which the United
[States said it was committing
itself to a global ideological strug
gle against revolutionary com
munism.
For it is this global commit
ment which is at the root of our
difficulty in appraising cooly the
extent and the importance of our
engagement in Vietnam. Thus,
I there are men saying today that

the defense of Saigon is the de
fense of Hawaii and that a truce
rather than a "victory" in Indo-
IChina will determine the fate of
the world and the position of the
United States as a great power j
and the safety of West Berlin and
so forth. For those who think this
way, there is no stopping point
between globalism and a retreat
into our former isolationism.
A Stopping Point
I think there is a.stopping point
between globalism and isolation-j
ism. The test of statesmanship is
to find those stopping points and
act accordingly.
For example, I read that it is
our duty and interest to resist
communism with force wherever
it is advancing with force and
that no price is too heavy to pay
for the fulfillment of that duty.
But in spite of all these declara
tions the fact is that the United
States did not intervene to resist
the Chinese conquest of Tibet, as
naked a case of aggression as any
we have seen. Why not? For the
i good and sufficient reasons that
j the United States could not reach
Tibet in order to defend it. And
: what is more, that Tibet is not a
j vital interest of the United States
'for which the President has the
right to spend American lives.
For another reason, take Ber
lin. There was an uprising in 1933,
and on ideological grounds alone
we should have supported the in
surrection and even incited it. On
the contrary, we did what we
could to damp it down, not wish
ing to trigger a world war by a
pitched battle in Berlin.
These examples show that put
to the test our officials have acted
more wisely than they have
talked, that put to the test they
have been statesmen and n o t
ideological crusaders.
For my part, I admire the pub
lic men who play it cool and do
not bend their judgment to the ex
hortations of the globalists. I am
confident, moreover, that in the
issues of war and peace the safe
course is to make a judgment
as to where is the balance of our
interests and our power, and hav
ing made that judgment to choose
decisively.

commitments on the Asian main
land are overextended and should
be reduced or whether they a r e j
not extended enough and should
be widened, deepened and en
larged.
Underlying these questions
there is a passionate emotional
issue. It is whether the security
of the United States, which must
be the primary preoccupation of
U.S. foreign policy, depends on a
limited or 011 an unlimited en
gagement of our military power.
A limited engagement of mili
tary power is one which is made
only when our vital interest is
clear and our military capacity is
idequate. This view of things is
now called "neo-isolationism" be- ]
cause it differs from a commit
ment to engage our forces any
where. be it in Vietnam or in the
Congo, where freedom as we un
derstand it is threatened by Com
munists. 11 the first of these
views is neo-isolationism, the
second is ideological globalism.
Isolationist Policy
Until after the fall of France
in 1940 and t he Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor in 1941, our pol
icy was genuinely isolationist.
This policy was breached during
the m ont hs when Winston
Churchill's England stood alone
against the victorious Nazis. The
breach was made by President
Roosevelt's circumvention of the
neutrality policy, first by lending
Britain 50 destroyers and then by
persuading Congress to enact the
, Lend Lease Act:.
The problem of our foreign pol
icy today will not be fully under
stood until historians explain how
our intervention in the second
world war to defeat t he Nazis and
the Japanese became inflated into
the so-called Truman Doctrine of
the late 1940's, in which the United
[States said it was committing
itself to a global ideological strug
gle against revolutionary com
munism.
For it is this global commit
ment which is at the root of our
difficulty in appraising cooly the
extent and the importance of our
engagement in Vietnam. Thus,
I there are men saying today that

the defense of Saigon is the de
fense of Hawaii and that a truce
rather than a "victory" in Indo-
IChina will determine the fate of
the world and the position of the
United States as a great power j
and the safety of West Berlin and
so forth. For those who think this
way, there is no stopping point
between globalism and a retreat
into our former isolationism.
A Stopping Point
I think there is a.stopping point
between globalism and isolation-j
ism. The test of statesmanship is
to find those stopping points and
act accordingly.
For example, I read that it is
our duty and interest to resist
communism with force wherever
it is advancing with force and
that no price is too heavy to pay
for the fulfillment of that duty.
But in spite of all these declara
tions the fact is that the United
States did not intervene to resist
the Chinese conquest of Tibet, as
naked a case of aggression as any
we have seen. Why not? For the
i good and sufficient reasons that
j the United States could not reach
Tibet in order to defend it. And
: what is more, that Tibet is not a
j vital interest of the United States
'for which the President has the
right to spend American lives.
For another reason, take Ber
lin. There was an uprising in 1933,
and on ideological grounds alone
we should have supported the in
surrection and even incited it. On
the contrary, we did what we
could to damp it down, not wish
ing to trigger a world war by a
pitched battle in Berlin.
These examples show that put
to the test our officials have acted
more wisely than they have
talked, that put to the test they
have been statesmen and n o t
ideological crusaders.
For my part, I admire the pub
lic men who play it cool and do
not bend their judgment to the ex
hortations of the globalists. I am
confident, moreover, that in the
issues of war and peace the safe
course is to make a judgment
as to where is the balance of our
interests and our power, and hav
ing made that judgment to choose
decisively.
