# IIR Builds 'Bridge' On Foreign Affairs
## 
### STAN DALEY 
After almost a two-year absence, The Bridge will reappear on
campus today. One is tempted to say "the Bridge is out' — which
is hardly to say that it is a wash-out — but which does bring the
title of the magazine into question. Ostensibly a magazine on inter
national relations, one supposes that the title refers to a bridge

between peoples or a bridge to<
understanding and communica
tion. thence to peace, etc.
Thankfully this theme is not
present. The do-gooders had bet
tor not buy The Bridge.
What do people students and
faculty — who claim to be "inter
nationally-minded" write about?
They touch on communism, Ber
lin (two on this), economics and
disarmament. If one appreciates

r
the problems in these subject
! areas one may well bo bettor able
to "relate internationally."
THE ARTICLES themselves aro
scholarly. By far the best is Prof.
Jan F. Triska's on "Stanford
Studies of the Communist Sys
tem."
A more subjective treatment of
communism. Berlin, and most im
port a n t. of the author
| is Bob Mann's description of his
twenty-one months in East Ger
man prisons. A Stanford in Ger
many Group VII member, Mann
was caught in an attempt to aid
refugees shortly after the Berlin
i Wall went up. In essence he faced
a moral problem. What can an in
dividual do against a police state?
MAYBE AFTER follow GCC
members read Jay Kadane's (and
jC. Daniel Vencill's) article t hey
will want to take away his cer
j tificatc of radicalism <if indeed he
over had one). Kadane and Ven
j cil would hestiate a long while be
fore disarming the nation. Maybe I
they won't please the Peace Can- j
I eus, but they do offer some posi- j
| tive ideas.
The Bridge has reappeared due
to the work of editors Marty
j Greenwald. Karen Moxness, Dirk
Gillam. and Justin Book. The
striking cover design by Gail,
Gutierrez suggests an eerie city,
perhaps a wall perhaps Berlin, j
As one editor put it."It should
only sell." The lii*!*!!;*' will be on
