CHURCH, who earned his un- j
dergraduate and law degrees at I
j Stanford, is already on record as i
seeking a major reappraisal of j
the government's foreign policy. ;
He is a ranking member of the j
j Senate Foreign Relations Com-1
! mittee.

In a recent article written for
the New York Times magazine, he
declared: "We are in too deep in
Africa and Asia."
"WE HAVE come to treat 'Com
munism' regardless of what form
it may lake in any given country,
as the enemy," he wrote. "We
fancy ourselves as guardians of
the free world, though most of
it is not free and never has been."
Our policy of massive American
aid and direct intervention, Sena
tor Church wrote, has at least
two defects: "First, it exceeds our
national capability; second, among
the newly emerging nations where
the spectre of Western imperial
ism is dreaded more than com
munism. such a policy is self-de
feating."
