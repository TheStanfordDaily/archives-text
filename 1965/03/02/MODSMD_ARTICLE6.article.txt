## 
### 
The only remaining member of the Dean of Women's Office an
nounced her resignation yesterday.
Assistant Dean of Women Elizabeth N. Avery, in a statement
released yesterday, echoed the bitter charges against the Adminis
tration made earlier by Associate Dean of Women Bonnie Fitz-

water.
"I AM resigning not because
Dean Allen has left, but because
of the way the University re
sponded to the situation which
led to her resignation," the 25-
year-old dean said in a statement
released yesterday.
President Wallace Sterling has
accept her resignation "with re
gret."
Dean Avery's resignation fol
lows Dean of Women Lucile Al
len's request for a terminal leave
of absence Feb. 14, effective at
that time, and Miss Fitzwater's
resignation, announced Feb. 17
and effective March 19.
IN HER statement she said:
"Although I have enjoyed work
ing at Stanford and being a part
.of the University community for
three and a half years, at t h i s
I time I submit my resignation as
Assistant Dean of Women to be
come effective the end of 1 his
academic year.
"It was only after a great deal
of thought and reflection that I
decided not to leave at the end of
! this quarter. I have agreed to
â€¢ stay until the end of the academic
year in order to complete the
work I am doing and because of
my concern for students.
"I have strong convictions re
garding the issues involved in the
recent controversy. I was present
at the meeting last spring with
! Dean Allen and Women's Coun
cil. At that meeting we acted in
i response to a student concern
through a legally constituted
I body, the Women's Council. We
neither violated, nor did we make
any suggestion which would in
fringe upon anyone's academic
freedom.
"STANFORD HAS lost a great
deal in Dean Allen's departure.
Dean Allen's stature, her integ
rity, her concern for others, and
her warmth have meant a great
deal to many students, as well as
to others in the University com
munity.
"My concern extends beyond
Dean Allen to the whole Univer
sity, for Stanford has also lost a
critical opportunity to state
clearly its position 011 the rights
of students and the rights of the
faculty and administrative offi
cers.
"I hope that the events of the
j past few weeks will continue to
| call the attention of the academic
[community to the need for
clearly-defined procedures that
will support sound administrative
I action.
"I BELIEVE it is time for every
one who cares about Stanford, in-
I dividually and collectively, to take
a careful look at where the l7ni
versity stands and to look
thoughtfully to what lies ahead."
