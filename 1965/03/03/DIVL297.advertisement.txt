This Program is designed to develop young men
for careers in life insurance sales and sales man
agement. It provides an initial training period of 3
months (including 2 weeks at a Home Office School)
before the men move into full sales work.
Those trainees who are interested in and who are
found qualified for management responsibility are
assured of ample opportunity to move on to such
work in either our field offices or in the Home Office
after an initial period in sales.
The Connecticut Mutual is a 118-year-old com
pany with 560,000 policyholder-members and over
six billion dollars of life insurance in force. Ag
gressive expansion plans provide unusual oppor
tunities for the men accepted.
