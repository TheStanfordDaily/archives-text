Prof Supports Establishment of INHF
David >1. Potter, professor of history at Stanford, has participated
in the launching of a movement for the establishment of a National
Humanities Foundation (NIIF).
The NIIF plan, now transformed into House and Senate bills for
its establishment and funding, is designed as a companion to the
older National Science Foundation, which supports scientific re
search at colleges and universities. Hearings on both bills liegan last i
week in Washington.
Prof. Potter is ;i member of a special committee of the American
Council of Learned Societies which developed a "Report on the Hu
inanities."
The Senate bill, introduced by Sen. Claiborne Pell (D.-R.1.), pro
vides for matching grants-in-aid for the arts to each state and to
qualified nonprofit professional groups involved in the major art
forms.
On a similar basis, the humanities would be assisted in terms :
| of improved education, research, teaching and scholarship.
