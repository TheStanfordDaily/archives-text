# SEQUOIA REVIEW
## A
						Question Of 'Imagery' 
### LINDA LITERARY 
Sequoia, Stanford's much-maligned literary
magazine, has undergone a change of image.
It used to be, in Stanford's not-so long ago age
of pastoral innocence and communal apathy, that
Sequoia was the campus far-out rag, gathering
place for all kinds of anarchist ravings, indecipher
able poetiy (usually by non-student beatniks-in
residence), and editorials uniform in anti-Philistia,
pro-revolutionary sentiment.
BUT, AS WE'VE said, times have changed.
There's an ad on the front pages, and no editorial.
The GCC Newsletter and the Challenger make
Sequoia's modest offering of a "Focus on Missis
sippi," seem a tame product of the Establishment.
But they've managed to sneak a few things in.
The five articles centering around Mississippi may
show lack of editorial concern with "the corpora
tion university," but they suggest that involve
ment with off-campus issues can be exciting too.
THE LEAD article by Professor Wilford Stone,
an account of two weeks spent teaching at a Free

dom School in Mississippi last summr, provoca
tively uses personal experience to render and illu
minate both the condition of the Negro and the
reaction of the Southerner in an era of racial awak
ening.
It is followed by a careful exegesis of Eudora
Welty's story "A Worn Path" by Professor Alfred
Appel, an article by Carolyn Egan, another Free
dom School teacher, letters by Luke Kabat (a
Challenger reprint?) and a reminiscence by Missis
sippi-born Robert Canzoneri.
The two stories and four poems which complete
the magazine are well-written and readable to the
point of glandness (almost all by undergraduates,
as if to answer Workshop complaints).
BUT THERE are exciting things here too: a
fine etching of the naked "Sheriff" by Leonard
Baskin, and Rick Russom's translation of a sexy
Baudelaire poem.
So if Sequoia is "way in" instead of "way out,"
it's a readable and worthwhile vacation from all
that campus involvement.
