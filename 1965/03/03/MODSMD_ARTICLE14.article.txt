# Fifty Yale Students Picket Over Faculty Tenure Rule
## 
### 
According to yesterday's New
York Times, fifty students began
picketing Yale's administrative
offices yesterday to protest the
university's faculty tenure pro
gram.
THE TIMES reported that the
students objected to the deter
mination of tenure "by the quan
tity of a professors' published
works instead of the quality of
their teaching." The students
characterized Yale's policy as
"publish or perish."
The students, who took up their
posts at 1 p.m., said the picketing
would continue around the clock
until 4 p.m. Thursday. After the
picketing stops, administrators,
professors and students are sched
uled to hold a forum.
The demonstration is the result
of a report that the Yale Tenure
Appointment Committee had de
nied teaching tenure to Richard
J. Bernstein, a popular associate
professor of philosophy. This was
the second time the 32-year-old
educator had been denied tenure.

BRUCE L. PAYNE, graduate
student in political science, said
the students were demonstrating
primarily over the university's
policy which "discourages creative
teaching."
A professor of philosophy, Rob
ert S. Brumbaugh, said, "Under
the criteria of publications that
were used for Mr. Bernstein, we
could not have gotten tenure for
Aristotle when he was 32, we
could not have gotten it for Kant,
and on a much homelier level, I
could not have gotten it."
Paul Weiss, Sterling Professor
of Philosophy, added that "the
committee came to its conclusion
slowly and conscientiously, but
that does not mean that its deci
sion was not stupid, unfair, dis
maying and one from which il
will take this university and the
department a long time to re
cover."
