# 'EXCESSIVE INTERVENTION'
## Church Knocks Foreign Policy 
### BILL WERTZ 
Senator Frank Church (I).-Ida
ho), ranking member of the Sen
ate Foreign Relations Committee,
said last night that the United
States has become over-involved
in both Africa and Asia.
Giving the 1963 Distinguished
Alumnus Award Lecture in Me
morial Auditorium, Church said
that although he is a confirmed

I internationalist, he feels that
U.S. foreign policy contains an
excess of interventionism.
; "The pendulum of our foreign
I policy can swing from one ex
treme to the other," Church .said.
| "Once we thought that anything
j which happened abroad was none
| of our business; now we evidently
think that everything which hap
pens abroad has become our busi
ness."
THE REASON the U.S. has

spread itself so thin, Church said,
"stems from our intensely ideo
logical view of the Cold War. We
have come to treat 'communism,'
regardless of what form it may
I take in any given country, as the
enemy. We fancy ourselves as
guardians of the 'free' world. . . .
I We seek to immunize this world
against further communist infec
j tion through massive injections of
I American aid. and, whenever
! necessary .through direct Ameri

can intervention.
Church said this undertaking
had two major defects: "First, it
exceeds our national capability;
second, among the newly emerg
ing nations, where the spectre of
western imperialism is dreaded
more than communism, such a
policy can be self-defeating."
Thus, he said, "A foreign policy
of intervention, which was right
for Western Europe, is apt lo be
wrong for those continents which
have just thrown off European
rule."
Church cited two reasons 112 or
the U.S. success in Europe follow
ing World War 11. One reason, he
said, was that the U.S. was clearly
accepted to be a "nuclear senti
nel" against further Russian ag
gression. Another was that "in
Europe, we stood among people
with whom we shared a common
ancestry. . . . This cultural bond
meant that most Europeans gen
erally shared our aims and our
point of view."
"IT DOES not follow that Afri
cans and Asians share this view,"
Church said. "They have been
participants in a different revo
lution.
"We must understand that, for
most Africans and Asians, our
concept of self-government and
individual freedom is totally un
real. ... In most of these emer
gent lands, it is colonialism, not
communism, which is the ugly
word."
Church listed rising anti-Ameri
can feeling, accusations of neo
colonialism, and attacks on U.S.
embassies as examples that the
policy of intervention in Asia and
Africa is backfiring.
