# The 						New Way to Life
## 
### 
Every Christian, as regenerated by tlie Holy Spirit, spiritually horn, and
placed "into Christ" is a new creation, a new kind of individual altogether.
However, not all believers in Christ have experienced full victory and de
liverance from the dominion of sin because they have not fully entrusted their
lives to God. Chapter 7 of the New Testament Letter, Romans, describes the
struggles of such an individual who seeks to throw off the shackles of >in
and to live the Christian life in self effort without Cod's total assistance.
Victory comes when the point of total surrender occurs.
"When your old nature was active, sintul desires were at work within
you, making you want to <i<> whatever Cod said not to do, and producing sin
ful deeds, the rotting fruit that comes with death. Hut now you need no longer
worry about the Jewish laws and customs because you "died" while in their
captivity, and now you can really serve Cod : not in the old way, mechanically
obeying a set of rules, but in the new way. with all of your hearts and minds.
Well then, am 1 suggesting that these laws of (iod are evil? Of course not!
No, the law is not sinful hut it was the law that showed me my sin. 1 would
never have known the sin in my heart—the evil desires that are hidden there
—except the law said, You must not have evil desires in your heart.' But sin
used this law against evil desires by reminding me that such desires are wrong
and arousing all kinds of forbidden desires within me! Only if there were no
laws to break would there be no sinning. That is why 1 felt fine so long as T
did not understand what the law really demanded, But when I found out then
I realized that I had broken the law and was a sinner, doomed to die. So far
as 1 was concerned, the good law which was supposed to show me the way of
life resulted in my being given the death penalty. Sin fooled me by taking the
good laws of God and using them to make me guilty of death. . . . The law is
good. The trouble is not there, but with me, because I am too sinful to obey it.
I don't understand myself at all. for I really want to do what is right, but 1
can't. I do what 1 don't want to —what I hate.
1 know perfectly well that what 1 am doing is wrong and that the laws T
am breaking the good ones. . . . When I want to be good. 1 don't; and when 1
try not to do wrong, I do it anyway. Now if I am doing what I don't want to,
it is plain where the trouble is; sin still has me in its evil grasp . . . there is
something else deep within me, in my lower nature, that is at war with my mind
and wins the fight and makes me a slave to the sin and death that are still
within me. In my mind 1 want to be God's willing servant but instead .1 find
myself still enslaved to sin. So you see how it is: my new life tells me to do
right, but the old nature that is still inside me loves to sin. Oh what a terrible
thing this is! Who will free from my slavery to this deadly lower nature?
Thank God! It has been done through Jesus Christ our Lord. He has set me
free" ( Romans 7 :7-J5 I.ivincj Letters).
Enter that deep rest in Christ (Hebrews 4:9-10) which comes only to
those who are fully committed and totally surrendered to our Lord. His total
victory can be yours today free for the asking.

"When your old nature was active, sintul desires were at work within
you, making you want to <i<> whatever Cod said not to do, and producing sin
ful deeds, the rotting fruit that comes with death. Hut now you need no longer
worry about the Jewish laws and customs because you "died" while in their
captivity, and now you can really serve Cod : not in the old way, mechanically
obeying a set of rules, but in the new way. with all of your hearts and minds.
Well then, am 1 suggesting that these laws of (iod are evil? Of course not!
No, the law is not sinful hut it was the law that showed me my sin. 1 would
never have known the sin in my heart—the evil desires that are hidden there
—except the law said, You must not have evil desires in your heart.' But sin
used this law against evil desires by reminding me that such desires are wrong
and arousing all kinds of forbidden desires within me! Only if there were no
laws to break would there be no sinning. That is why 1 felt fine so long as T
did not understand what the law really demanded, But when I found out then
I realized that I had broken the law and was a sinner, doomed to die. So far
as 1 was concerned, the good law which was supposed to show me the way of
life resulted in my being given the death penalty. Sin fooled me by taking the
good laws of God and using them to make me guilty of death. . . . The law is
good. The trouble is not there, but with me, because I am too sinful to obey it.
I don't understand myself at all. for I really want to do what is right, but 1
can't. I do what 1 don't want to —what I hate.
1 know perfectly well that what 1 am doing is wrong and that the laws T
am breaking the good ones. . . . When I want to be good. 1 don't; and when 1
try not to do wrong, I do it anyway. Now if I am doing what I don't want to,
it is plain where the trouble is; sin still has me in its evil grasp . . . there is
something else deep within me, in my lower nature, that is at war with my mind
and wins the fight and makes me a slave to the sin and death that are still
within me. In my mind 1 want to be God's willing servant but instead .1 find
myself still enslaved to sin. So you see how it is: my new life tells me to do
right, but the old nature that is still inside me loves to sin. Oh what a terrible
thing this is! Who will free from my slavery to this deadly lower nature?
Thank God! It has been done through Jesus Christ our Lord. He has set me
free" ( Romans 7 :7-J5 I.ivincj Letters).
Enter that deep rest in Christ (Hebrews 4:9-10) which comes only to
those who are fully committed and totally surrendered to our Lord. His total

Every Christian, as regenerated by tlie Holy Spirit, spiritually horn, and
placed "into Christ" is a new creation, a new kind of individual altogether.

lives to God. Chapter 7 of the New Testament Letter, Romans, describes the
struggles of such an individual who seeks to throw off the shackles of >in
