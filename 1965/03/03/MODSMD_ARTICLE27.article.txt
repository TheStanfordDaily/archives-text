Lust October, the Stanford community re
sponded to the Mississippi arrests of twelve civil
rights workers by raising over SI.SOO in bond
money during a single evening.
During the past two days, over uiuet\ people
have been arrested in Mississippi; at least one
individual, a \cv. York attorney, has been bru

and barely a ripple of indignation has crossed
the Stanford campus.
This demonstrable dissipation ol concern is
attributable, not so much to that demon of old—
"Stanford apathy"—but, rather, to that more gen

"adjust, in time, to even the most hideous of
situations.

but profound social movements rarely achieve
their mature goals in the space of a few years,
much less in a few months.
The accomplishment of change demands sus

willing to contribute emotional energy in such
agonizing quantities.

having paid off our conscience, we simply retire,
leaving the good people of Mississippi to their
own, time-honored devices, and ourselves to our
traditional self-satisfaction.
