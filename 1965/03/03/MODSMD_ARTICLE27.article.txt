# The 						Mississippi Norm

### 
Lust October, the Stanford community re
sponded to the Mississippi arrests of twelve civil
rights workers by raising over SI.SOO in bond
money during a single evening.
During the past two days, over uiuet\ people
have been arrested in Mississippi; at least one
individual, a \cv. York attorney, has been bru
tally beaten in the presence of a county sheriff;
and barely a ripple of indignation has crossed
the Stanford campus.
This demonstrable dissipation ol concern is
attributable, not so much to that demon of old—
"Stanford apathy"—but, rather, to that more gen
eral quality of human nature which allows us to
"adjust, in time, to even the most hideous of
situations.

In short, we have come to accept violence and
injustice as "normal for Mississippi and have
ceased to be shocked when violence and injus
tice occur,
This was, unfortunately, to bo expected.
but profound social movements rarely achieve
their mature goals in the space of a few years,
much less in a few months.
The accomplishment of change demands sus
tained effort. And, quite frankly, few of us are
willing to contribute emotional energy in such
agonizing quantities.
Rather, having fought the good battle briefly,
having paid off our conscience, we simply retire,
leaving the good people of Mississippi to their
own, time-honored devices, and ourselves to our
traditional self-satisfaction.
