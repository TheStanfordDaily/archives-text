There seems to be a misunderstanding on the
part of some soon-to-be-gone administrators con
cerning the activities of students since the publi
cation of the Crow-Halverson Report.
Apparently both assistant Deans of W omen,
Elizabeth Avery and Bonnie Fit/water, believe
the students are engaging in a general attack on
authority.
But both the Judicial Bill and the proposed
social regulations are an expression of the matur
ity of students here, and a confident assertion by
the student body of its own good judgment, not
an attack, as the Deans suppose.
The Judicial Bill is based on the premise
that the student courts are, in fact, student courts
—a part of the Associated Students and not an
arm of the Deans' offices.
But that would mean little in itself if the
Legislature did not feel that the student bodv is

mature enough to assume responsibility lor its
own conduct, and that students are responsible
enough to set their own regulations, to be en
forced by their own judicial system.
The current social regulations are based on
the premise that undergraduate women are un
able to set proper hours for themselves.
Most women, however, feel that by their jun
ior year they are sufficiently mature to regulate
their own hours, and that reliance on a system
of administrative regulation stifles expression of
their maturity by allowing them to avoid mak
ing any decision concerning these hours.
Hopefully other, more permanent, adminis
trators will see the events of recent weeks in
their true perspective—a desire of students to
regulate their own conduct, with the advice, but
without the excessive protection currently exer
cised bv University authorities. — J.II.
