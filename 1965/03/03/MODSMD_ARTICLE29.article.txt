# The 						Long-Long Story Of Social Regs On The Farm; Part The Second
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Executive Editor 
(Second In A Series)
Controversy over Social Regu
lations came up again, however,
in 1930, when student protests
lead to another change, this
time to a system not unlike th ( >
present one.
On February 2;">, 1930, The
Daily ran an editorial, "Where
The Winds of Freedom Blow,"
criticizing remarks made by
Dean of Women Mary Yost in
an interview with the Denver
Post.
That editorial said in part:
"The great exception a n d
the great triumph for the free
dom of the Five Hundred
[Stanford women were then
limited to 500] is, of course,
the smoking privilege. Con
cerning this boon to woman
hood, Miss Yost said: 'Now
the girls who wish may smoke
in their rooms, just as do the
men students. Practically the
same regulations apply to both
groups.'
"Thank goodness D e ii v e r
knows that Stanford is pro
gressive.
"But Denver should also be
informed of other features of
Stanford's super-system of
handling its feminine contin
gent. There is the lock-out,
for instance. It is nice and
progressive, too."
The Daily continued, "In con
clusion Miss Yost tolls the wait
ing Denver public this: 'We
must develope initiative, the
ability to stand alone, and a
sense of group responsibility.'
"Yes, Yes! And again yes!"
Where The Winds Of Freedom
Blow
A senior replied in the next
issue that, "'Where ihe winds
of freedom blow" may sound
ironical in the case of women's
regulations, but there is no such
thing as personal freedom in a
social group. Women's colleges
over the country have rules as
strict or even stricter than those
here and while it may be said
thai ,Sl an ford men are basking

in the light winds of freedom
perhaps a little more regulation
of tho Cardinal roughs might
not be amiss."
Concurrent with a drive to
help the starving Bulgarians,
action was begun to institute
sweeping changes in the social
regulations.
On March ."5, The Daily printed
an interview with Dr. Bertha Dy
ment, medical advisor and di
rector of women's physical edu
cation. She felt that "during the
growing period girls should have
nine hours sleep."
What About Studies Then
"If social activities keep a girl
up until 3 a.m. on Friday a n d
Saturday nights and occupy her
on Sundays, she is going to take
the first three or four days of
the week to recuperate, to be
ready for the next week-end.
What about studies then!"
Shortly thereafter, in an un
related incident, the "Immortal
Twenty-One" recovered the Axe
from Cal.
But the problem of social re
gulations came back strong on
April 26, with a report in The
Daily of a near fatal automobile
accident caused by a student at
tempting to get his date back
to campus by the mandatory
10:30 weekday lockout.
An editorial at the time, while
favoring ending the system, sug
gested that more reasonable
hours than 10:30 and 1:30 might
be found. "The Daily does not
advocate the abandonment of
women's regulations altogether.
Even though sane and desirable,
such a move would be out of the
question in the light of existing
conditions, hard and fast con
ventions and accepted custom."
Mass .Meeting, Circa 1030
By Monday fifty girls ha d
signed a petition demanding a
mass meeting to consider
changes in the social regulations
syst e m. Immediately AWS
countered wllh a vote among
the women on four questions
arising from the regulations.
Again, on April 29, The Daily
editorialized on the subject ad

vocating a 2:30 lockout, al
though, "There is a relic of Vic
torianism and the double stan
dard in the present regulations
which Stanford as one of most
liberal universities in the coun
try should not tolerate." The
girls at the mass meeting that
day unanimously favored the
2:30 lockout on weekends and
11:30 on weekdays.
On Monday, May 5, the propo
sal was taken to the living
groups who favored automatic
weekend 2:3o's, regular ll :30's
on weekdays, and a cer tain num
ber of "floating" 2:3o's during
the week.
By the end of the week, the
proposal went into a committee
of the AWS Conference, for
final recommendations.
A week and a half later, the
proposal came out of committee
as a tentative proposal to aban
don rules for graduate women,
juniors and seniors. A 2:30 sign
in on weekends would be p e r
mitted sophomores and fresh
men, with midweek 2:3o's
granted to sophomores with per
mission of the Conference mem
ber in the living group.
Will They lOver Speak Out?
The Daily, however, began to
have doubts about the ability of
the women to carry such a pro
posal to the administration.
"In personal conversation one
learns that women here on
the Farm are dissatisfied with
many of their traditions and
rules. But will they speak out;
will they take the necessary
steps to rectify the wrong?
"They will not. For years
now the women have decried
(privately) the lockout sys
tem; and only within the last
few weeks have they worked
up enough courage to make
an attempt at doing some
thing about it. To date the de
sired end hasn't been reached,
but there are persons in cer
tain circles who entertain
hopes.
The day before the paper had
criticized the slowness of the
AWS in working on Ihe prob
lem.

"The women have now con
vened, and reconvened, and re
convened again. They have dis
cussed the matter from at least
30 different angles. They have
had votes, plans, conferences,
lectures, and committee meet
ings.
"It is great fun, of course, but

all good things must end, you
know.
"Wouldn't it be nice if the mat
ter were ended right now?"
That editorial concluded, "The
matter could be --- and should i
be closed within the week, as
far as the women themselves are
concerned."
