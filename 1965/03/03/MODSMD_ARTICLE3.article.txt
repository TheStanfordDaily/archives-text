# Church Calls Viet Conflict Civil, Not Containing, War
## 
### JON ROISE BILL WERTZ 
"We need to make a differentia
tion between the containment of
China and civil wars which in
clude communist elements," said
United States Sen. Frank Church
in discussing the problems of
American involvement in South
east Asia at a press conference
yesterday in Tresidder Union.
The youthful Idahoan, who has
recently come into conflict wit h
President Lyndon Johnson over
policy in Viet Nam. told a group
of Bay Area reporters that "A dif
ferent American policy, one di
rected toward the containment of
China, is what is needed."
THIS, ill': SAID, could best be
done "by encircling China with

stable, independent countries."
He suggested that the United
States might make a greater ef
fort to strengthen the positions
of those countries on the Chinese
periphery which have already
achieved stability. "For example,"
he said, "it might be wise to ex
tend our nuclear umbrella to India
to protect her from Chinese inva
sion."
In regard to the Viet Nam situa
tion, he said that the greatest dif
ficulty is not a matter of insuffi
cient American assistance, bul is
rather the failure of Saigon's in
ternal factions to create a unified
front. "This necessary unity and
cohesion," he said, "they must
find for themselves."
ANY SETTLKMK\T, he af
firmed, "ultimately is up to the
Vietnamese. We must recognize
that; they must recognize that.
"A civil war, in the end. must
be settled by the people of that
country."
However, he emphasized, "I am
not proposing a withdrawal from
Southeast Asia that would leave
a vacuum that Chinese troops
would fill.
"I DON'T THINK that we
should withdraw except in the
context of a political settlement.
"It's clear that there must be
some political settlement, eventu
ally. It's clear that wc will reach
no military decision, just as we
didn't in Korea."
He said that any expanded
war would be "costlier" than the
Korean conflict, with respect to
American losses.
( HI'KC II STATKD that lie sup
ports American retaliatory bomb
ing of North Viet Nam "because
it is all that is available for us to
demonstrate our strength in
Southeast Asia."
lie would not say, however,
whether he supports nonretalia
lory bombing raids against the
North, such as the one carried out
yesterday morning on President
Johnson's onler^

Later in the afternoon, at a
discussion with students at th e
I-Centcr, Church reiterated his
view of the Vietnamese fighting
as primarily a civil war between
North and South, as opposed to a
war of containment.
THE ISSUE at stake, he said,
was whether Viet Nam would be
come united under control from
Hanoi, or remain divided with a
separate government in Saigon.
Church said that il was hard to
say how much support there was
in Viet Nam for either the com
munist or anticommunist forces.
"I would say there is a hard core
of support for both sides," he
said, "and that .there is a large
measure of indifference in be
tween."

The youthful Idahoan, who has
recently come into conflict wit h
President Lyndon Johnson over
policy in Viet Nam. told a group
of Bay Area reporters that "A dif
ferent American policy, one di
rected toward the containment of
China, is what is needed."
THIS, ill': SAID, could best be
done "by encircling China with

stable, independent countries."
He suggested that the United
States might make a greater ef
fort to strengthen the positions
of those countries on the Chinese
periphery which have already
achieved stability. "For example,"
he said, "it might be wise to ex
tend our nuclear umbrella to India
to protect her from Chinese inva
sion."
In regard to the Viet Nam situa
tion, he said that the greatest dif
ficulty is not a matter of insuffi
cient American assistance, bul is
rather the failure of Saigon's in
ternal factions to create a unified
front. "This necessary unity and
cohesion," he said, "they must
find for themselves."
ANY SETTLKMK\T, he af
firmed, "ultimately is up to the
Vietnamese. We must recognize
that; they must recognize that.
"A civil war, in the end. must
be settled by the people of that
country."
However, he emphasized, "I am
not proposing a withdrawal from
Southeast Asia that would leave
a vacuum that Chinese troops
would fill.
"I DON'T THINK that we
should withdraw except in the
context of a political settlement.
"It's clear that there must be
some political settlement, eventu
ally. It's clear that wc will reach
no military decision, just as we
didn't in Korea."
He said that any expanded
war would be "costlier" than the
Korean conflict, with respect to
American losses.

Later in the afternoon, at a
discussion with students at th e
I-Centcr, Church reiterated his
view of the Vietnamese fighting
as primarily a civil war between
North and South, as opposed to a
war of containment.
THE ISSUE at stake, he said,
was whether Viet Nam would be
come united under control from
Hanoi, or remain divided with a
separate government in Saigon.
Church said that il was hard to
say how much support there was
in Viet Nam for either the com
munist or anticommunist forces.
"I would say there is a hard core
of support for both sides," he
said, "and that .there is a large
measure of indifference in be
tween."
"We need to make a differentia
tion between the containment of
China and civil wars which in
clude communist elements," said
United States Sen. Frank Church
in discussing the problems of
American involvement in South
east Asia at a press conference
yesterday in Tresidder Union.
