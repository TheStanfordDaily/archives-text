## 'Sophomoric' Review Hit 
### 
Editor, Tlhi Daily:
Your review of The Challenger
was sophomoric. Rather than con
sider the articles seriously it fell
into sarcasm, superciliousness,
sneers. This tone reveals a va
cuum of concern for the issues be
ing discussed and is exemplified
in such incredible comments as,
"Since he feels strongly perhaps
to strongly—about, men's plight
in the 'very dungeon in which
most of us languish'. ..." I fail
to see how one can feel "too
strongly" about the tragedies of
emasculation, impotence, moan
inglessness — the "dungeon" of
alienated existence, and your re
viewers' judgment on this point
makes me suspect that they do
not feel "too strongly" about any
thing.

• Mother Defended
Editor, The Daily:
In Deanne Wilson's criticism of
my parent's letter, I feel that
false assumptions have been made
which I would like to clarify. To
quote from my mother's letter:
"If the Stanford admissions oper
ate on as high a standard as they
are supposed to, it seems to me
that any girl accepted should be
able to handle herself without a
complicated set of rules and
hours."
My mother did not assume that
"high intelligence and diligent
study habits" (a quote from Miss
Wilson) are the sole standard of
Stanford admissions. Having seen
the extensive character rating
forms which were to be sent to
Stanford by all prospective stu
dents, she could not have made
such an assumption, and she did
not.
However I think she could
assume that if these recommen
dation forms had been filled out
honestly and then had been care
fully considered by the admissions
board, students accepted would be
of high calibre in respect to both
intelligence and character. She
also could assume, as she does,
t hat girl students of such high
calibre would bo able to handle
themselves without complicated
social regulations, and that the
Honor Code could be used as a
personal guide in whatever simple
regulations might be used.
She is not so idealistic as to
think that every Stanford girl is
completely responsible and ma
ture, but she does think that
Stanford girls as a group are
responsible and mature enough to

regulate their own social lives
with a minimum of regulation.
As far as Miss Wilson's re
marks on the English T.A. situa- j
tion are concerned, she implies
that my mother accused the ad
ministration (Dean Allen i of mak
ing up charges. My mother did
not do this at all. She simply said
that if Stanford had chosen its i
T.A.'s with "reputed" care, it j
should respect their judgment on
handling all facets of literary ma- j
terial. She said that such care
fully chosen T.A.'s should be able
to handle this material wisely and
that my T.A. had done so. She did
not say that therefore all T.A.'s
do, but that some may have been
judged by Victorian standards of
"niceness" which she considered)
poor criteria for teacher evalua-1
j tion.
Finally, my mother's letter was
not a document of philosophical
i doctrine but was a parent's opin
ion; an opinion which was, I be
lieve, broadminded and generous.
She feels, as I do, that a positive
and trusting approach to areas of i
personal conduct is good, and
that Stanford students and T.A.'s
have yet to prove that they do not |
: deserve it.

| • Zion Anachronism ?
Editor, The Daily:
Israel is an anachronism. It
heralds a religious heritage and
national purpose anomalous in an
age of secular statism and be-j
havioral politics. It is thus unique
within the post-war proliferation
of fledgling states.
Israel was founded by people;
'with faith and with a vision: its
birthright was affirmed by the!
| collective Western conscience.
Israel the state may be chal
lenged for its policies; Israel the j
; ideal cannot be challenged. It is |
i the ethical significance of a Zion-j
' ist homeland which makes Rabbi |
Berger's brand of assimilat ionism
particularly abhorrent. A Rabbi
should know better.
