# 'Ratioism' Infects Foreign Centers

### JOE ROSENBLOOM News Editor 
More Stanford men will be
going overseas, hi it they may
Im> enjoying it less; at least
it is going to be harder to
beat the ratio.
Overseas Campus Director
Robert Walker announced
yesterday that men will soon
outnumlier women at all the
campuses.
Until now, only the Ger
many campus, with 13 men
and 30 women, could claim
this distinction. As of next
fall, the campuses in Italy
and France, as well as a new
campus in Austria, will re
flect the change in policy.
A fifth campus in England,
which received final approval
from the Board of Trustees
last month, will open its doors
in January of next year to
more males than females.
The change adjusted the
overseas campus representa
tion more toward the Stan
ford men-women ratio, Walk
er stated.
"The men, in effect, have
been discriminated against,
and we are trying to correct
this," lie remarked.
But the overall result for
all five campuses will be a ra
tio of 1.5 males per coed, still
somewhat short of the 2.5 to
one undergraduate ratio on
the Farm.
The Italian and French
campuses, which previously
have had equal proportions of
the sexes, will be reappor-

tioned with Italy adding eight
men and keeping its 4(1 wom
en and France accepting 52
men and 28 women. Austria,
like England, will be allotted
50 men and 30 women.
The men-women proportion
depends entirely on the "hous
ing situation" at each cam
pus, Walker declared.
He stated that the dispar
ity in the numbers of each
sex at the Germany campus
has created no problem ami
"1 don't see any reason why
it should at the others."
The application deadline for
next year's sessions at th e
four campuses has been ex
tended until the end of this
week because of "some con
fusion," the Director added.
Applications for the English
campus will not be accepted
until the spring quarter.
Despite an expected in
crease in applications induced
by the addition of two cam
puses, Walker anticipates a
fall in Hie minimum GPA
necessary for acceptance.
In tin- past applications
have come from hen and wom
en in the same percentages
relative to their numbers. The
GI'A for men has generally
l»een 2.8 and that for men and
2.6 for women. There have
Iweit about two and a half to
two times more applicants
than places available.
What influence the new ra
tio will have in stimulating
female applications is still un
clear.

relative to their numbers. The
GI'A for men has generally
l»een 2.8 and that for men and
2.6 for women. There have
Iweit about two and a half to
two times more applicants
than places available.

it is going to be harder to
beat the ratio.
Overseas Campus Director
Robert Walker announced
yesterday that men will soon
outnumlier women at all the
campuses.
Until now, only the Ger
many campus, with 13 men
and 30 women, could claim
this distinction. As of next
fall, the campuses in Italy
and France, as well as a new
campus in Austria, will re
flect the change in policy.
A fifth campus in England,
which received final approval
from the Board of Trustees
last month, will open its doors
in January of next year to
more males than females.
The change adjusted the
overseas campus representa
tion more toward the Stan
ford men-women ratio, Walk
er stated.
"The men, in effect, have
been discriminated against,
and we are trying to correct
this," lie remarked.
But the overall result for
all five campuses will be a ra
tio of 1.5 males per coed, still
somewhat short of the 2.5 to
one undergraduate ratio on
the Farm.
The Italian and French
campuses, which previously
have had equal proportions of
the sexes, will be reappor-

tioned with Italy adding eight
men and keeping its 4(1 wom
en and France accepting 52
men and 28 women. Austria,
like England, will be allotted
50 men and 30 women.
The men-women proportion
depends entirely on the "hous
ing situation" at each cam
pus, Walker declared.
He stated that the dispar
ity in the numbers of each
sex at the Germany campus
has created no problem ami
"1 don't see any reason why
it should at the others."
The application deadline for
next year's sessions at th e
four campuses has been ex
tended until the end of this
week because of "some con
fusion," the Director added.
Applications for the English
campus will not be accepted
until the spring quarter.
Despite an expected in
crease in applications induced
by the addition of two cam
puses, Walker anticipates a
fall in Hie minimum GPA
necessary for acceptance.
