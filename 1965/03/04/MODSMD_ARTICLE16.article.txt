# WRESTLERS READY TO WRESTLE, AS
## Cards Host AAWU Mat Tournament 
### 
Oregon State, led by AU-Ameri-
J can Len Kauffman, appears the
| team to beat this weekend as
I grapplers from all over the West
Coast assemble on the Stanford
campus for the AAWU Wrestling
Tournament.
Of the seven schools in the con
ference only USC will not be rep
resented in the fracas.
Stanford's wrestling team, hurt
all season by weaknesses in the
lower weights, should not find
this deficiency so diluting to its
strength this weekend. In tourna
ment play, several excellent per
formances can meliorate b a d
showings, or no showings, in other
weight classes.
ALTHOUGH sometimes medi
ocre, Stanford could finish as high
as third in the tourney with vic
tories in the heavier weights. The
Indian's best chance for a division
crown is at the heavyweights,
with undefeated Bruce Wilhelm,
6'2", 24.i pound sophomore leading
the way.
Wilhelm, who has compiled an
j 11-0 record in his first year of col
| legiate wrestling, will have to
overcome the challenge of Oregon
State's Art Makinster, who was
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
champion last year.
The two day tournament begins

I Friday evening at 7:30 p.m. with
first round matches in the Pa
: vilion. A double session is set for
Saturday, one beginning at 12:00
p.m. at Encina Gym and the other
| at 7:30 p.m. in the Pavilion.
ADMISSION to the event will
be $1.00 for adults, with children
and students admitted free to the
i opening session.
With seemly wrestling in seven
of the ten classifications, the Beav
ers of Oregon State must be re
garded as the tournament favor
i ile.
Their leading contender, Len
Kauffman, who was recently
named to the mid-seasoft Ail-
American team, was third in the
NCAA tournament last season
land won the National AAWU
championship in the 171 pound
j division.
OTHER BEAVERS who are ex
| peeled to do well in the tourney
| include Art Makinster, defending
: champion heavyweight whose
j only defeat this year came at the
ban d s of Stanford's Wilhelm,
! Gary Head at 123, Ron Iwasaki at
115, Robin Bolton at 130, and
1 Hank Shenk at 191.
I Last year it was UCLA that
I captured the crown, and the
: Bruins this year could pose a
; l hreat to Oregon State.
UCLA has two champions from
| last year in Dave Hollinger at 115
! and Bobbie Jenko at 123, but

. the superior depth of the Beavers
will probably be the determining
feature of the contest.
Alter Oregon State and UCLA,
there are many teams fighting
amongst one another for th i rd
place, including Stanford. Only
the Washington Huskies appear
completely outclassed.
STANFORD wrestlers who may
place in the meet besides Wilhelm,
who has to be rated the favorite
in the heavyweight class, are
Steve Schaum at 157, Frank Pratt
at 167, John Price at 167, and Mike
Davison at 177.
How the individual meets might
be decided are as follows:
115 pounds — UCLA's Hollinger
should pick up the title, but he
may be pressed by Ron Iwasaki
i of OSU and Phil Walson of Cal.
123 pounds - Bobbie Jenko, the
Bruin's defending AAWU cham
! pion will do battle with OSU's
■ Gary Head, Pacific Coast Cham
j pion of last year.
130 pounds — Two Oregon
stars, Doug Robertson of Oregon
I and Robin Bolton of OSU,
have the field to themselves.
137 pounds — Lee Sprague of
Oregon State is the favorite to
capture the crown.
157 pounds — Stanford's Steve
Schaum here has a good oppor
tunity to win a division for the
(Indians. He should have tough
j competition in Bob Mitchell of
I Oregon.

147 pounds — Bob Munger of
; UCLA.
I<»7 pounds It's Kauffman of
' OSU.
177 pounds - Mike Davison of
1 Stanford could upset the field.
191 pounds Hank Schenk of
Oregon State appears the favor-
I ite.
Heavyweight Stanford's last
I best hope at this point in the
lournamont is with big Bruce
Wlllielm. Already having whipped
most of his more formidable op
ponents, Wilhelm should win the
I division for Stanford.
