### Editorial Staff 
The Legislature last night supported the AWS Hoard in reject
ing an attempt by the Social Regulations Committee to delay con
sideration of new social regulations.
Carol Swanson ,speaking for the Social Regulations Committee,
told the Legislature that her committee needed more time to con-

sider the tentative proposals'*
made earlier this week.
But LASSU passed, by an over
whelming majority, a resolution
supporting the action taken by
the mass meeting Monday and j
the AWS Board yesterday, in ac
cepting the new proposals and
aiming for a possible implementa
tion by April 1.
THE RESOLUTION instructed
the Undergraduate Women's
Caucus to "investigate the imple
mentation of the fnewly proposed
social regulation)."
Sponsored by Elizabeth Wall,
the resolution also expressed the I
concurrence of the Legislature
with the AWS Board concerning j
the proposed changes in social;
legs. It directed ASSU President 1
Scott Mc√üride to report the reso
lution along with a text of the j
! proposed women's regulations and
; other "supporting information"
j to the Student Affairs and Serv
i ices Committee.
i The Legislature also expressed
! its intention to encorporate a ma
j .jor outline of the new Social]
Regulation into the ASSU By
: Laws.
The proposal was accepted as a !
j first reading of a By-Laws change
and sent to the Undergraduate'
j Women's Caucus to be put in final
j form.
BY THAT ACTION, LASSU in- j
dicated that it would bring the
proposed regulations to a vote at I
the first meeting of next quarter.
The Social Regulations Commit
; tee and the Undergraduate Worn
! en's Caucus have indicated that
by that time the minor problems
of implementation should be re-
I solved.
In other action a resolution in
troduced by Jay Kadane to direct
,the Publications Board to appro-
I priate an additional $80 for the
: publication of the GCC Newslet
-1 ter was voted down 45-38.
Earlier yesterday, the AWS
; Board overrode the Social Regu
lations Committee and passed, 18-
j 2, the proposed regulations ap
i proved Monday at the AWS mass
I meeting.
( The action was taken after
'Miss Swanson, Chairman of the
Social Regulations Committee,
told the Board, composed of the
presidents of each of the women's

residences, that more time was
needed fur the women to come to
to a "real understanding" of the
proposed regulations.
"WE AGREE on the entire pro
posal," she said, "but there are
implications that can't be con
sidered on a two-day notice."
She stated that she would pre
fer that regulations not be im
plemented until September.
Chan a Cliiba, president of
AWS, told the group that "a great
deal of pressure has been exerted
upon the (Social Regulations)
Committee to hurry up and get
something done."
BECAUSE OF the pressures on
the committee during the time the
regulations were being formula
ted, she said, the committee did
not feel that two days was ade
quate time between presenting the
proposals to the students and
having them acted upon by the
legislature.
She cited the AWS Board, the
President's Student Affairs and
Services Committee (which initia
led the social regulations study),
LASSU. and campus opinion as
expressed through The Daily as
the pressuring groups.
