# Morse Attacks U.S. Viet Policy: 'No Particular Objective To It'
## 
### Bruce Burton 
» Senator Wayne Morse lam
; basted American foreign policy
in Southeast Asia yesterday,
I charging (he Eisenhower admin
list ration with "secret" diplomacy
land Lyndon Johnson with no ob
: jective at all in Viet Nam.
i Morse (Dem.-Ore.) said that the
I American public as well as Con-
I gress "are stiil much in the dark
j as to the purpose and objective of
; the ("recent) attacks.
"I THINK the Administration
has told us about all it can about
our policy in Southeast Asia, be
cause there is no particular objec
tive to it,"he said.
Morse also charged John Fos
| ter Dulles, secretary of state un
j der the Eisenhower Administra
tion, with unsuccessful secret at
; tempts to bring British troops into
I the Vietnamese conflict.
J He said the Dulles negotiations
I with Churchill and Anthony Eden
1 and President Johnson's silence on
I Southeast Asia policy are leading
| to "government by concealment."
Morse criticized recent air at
tacks against North Vietnamese
military installations and said the
"so-called White Paper that
i sought to justify these attacks
t after the fact was shot full of j
i holes by the testimony of Admin-
I istration officials.
According to Morse, "maintain-!
| ing an overwhelming American
(force in Southeast Asia" is a pol-
J Icy of "hoping" we won't be forced
into showdowns with the Commu
-1 nists.
Til 10 SENATOR also answered
what he called "rightwing"
charges that U.S. policy in Asia
pursues a "no-win" course: "The

reason we have so many 'no-win'
policies is because we have so
many 'can't-win' objectives," he
said.
Morse warned that the U.S.
! "cannot roll back the tide of Asian
! nationalism that ousted every
j western power from its Asiatic
, footholds.
"We can fight on the present
scale in North and South Viet
I Nam a hundred years . . . but we
will not be able to make China
• leave her neighbors alone . . .
; or be able to impose on any part
i of Indochina a government of our
: choosing," he stated.
RETURNING TO the air at
tacks, Morse charged they are
I "one more admission that we can
; not win a guerrilla war in th e
south." He said that holding on
to Southeast Asia would require
a ground force of at least 300,000
American troops and wondered
whether the loss in lives would be
worth the struggle.
The senator declared that "our
i practice in Asia is running en
j tirely contrary" to previous U.S.
I dependence upon "observance of
international rules and resort to

.international bodies" for mainten
: ance of peace.
MORSE SAID that for ten years
i U.S. claims that North Viet Nam
| has been violating the 1954 Gon
! Eva Accord have not been brought
I "to the parties who signed the
i agreement and who were respon
sible for its enforcement."
"Nor did we go to the United
Nations," Morse said, "the sole
; international body with jurisdic
| tion over threats to peace; In
| stead, we multiplied our own vio-
I lations by joining in the fighting."
Morse said this failure to bring
i the U.N. into the Viet Nam crisis
may be "one of the main causes
of the weakening" of the interna
tional body.
As a substitute for present U.S.
policy of military aid, Morse sug
gested the U.S. work towards
"economic freedom" in Southeast
Asia.
He said only economic indepen
dence from foreign control will
lead Asians from communism.
"You cannot export political
. freedom," he said. "We've been
| trying it for 20 years in foreign
! policy and its been a flop."
