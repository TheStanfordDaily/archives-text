# Student Employment Office Offers Part-Time Work
## 
### 
Anxious to earn some extra
money? Almost all students are,
though very few of thorn take
advantage of the University's Stu
dent Employment Office, which is
located in the west wing of En
eina Hall.
The Office is a division of Ihc
Placement Services and its pri
mary purpose is to help provide
temporary or permenent employ
ment for students at Stanford.
II also helps local wives to find
secretarial, clerical or other types
of work in the area.
The assistant director of th c
Placement Services in charge of
the Student Employment Office
is Mrs. Barbara B. Cochran. She
explained lo the Dully that there
are primarily three ways in which
students can find jobs while at
Stanford.
One method is through the
Financial Aids Office, whi c h
generally fills openings in the
library, and in I lie various Food
Services on or around campus;
another is simply by scouting
local employers and requesting
work on a direct, individual basis;
the Employment Office is the
third and in many ways the most
useful.
The Student Employment Of
fice is contacted by area busi
nesses and individuals as they
need part-lime help. It keeps li

I tings of the opportunities, a large,
I portion of them in "open-book !
listings", which students aiv free;
to check over in the office. Pay
! rates vary from $.60 hour to $4.00 â– 
and more. The job range through i
ja variety of fields, the biggest
I ones being tutoring, baby sitting,
| and unskilled labor.
There is a very great diversity
of opportunities. Mrs. Cochran
Pointed out some of the more
colorful ones: A short time ago.
a young woman student was

, placed in a position as a "human
alarm clock", which consisted of
' awakening a local lady in person
j al 7 a.m., five days a week, for
ten dollars. Currently there are
' openings for part-time jobs as an
organist at two local Sunday
Church services for more than
two dollars an hour; as aa kennel
man; as a bartender; as an art
teacher in a junior high school;
as a play ground leader; as a
sailing instructor for two lecn-age
children; and many others as
well.
In addition lo jobs on a regular
basis, there is a number of tem
porary jobs for those desiring
I extra money to "tide them over".
Some of these are one-day garden
ing or raking jobs for $1.30 or
i $2.00 per hour, although there are
many others from which to
choose. Mrs. Cochran estimated
j that in the open file, there are, at
present, approximately $250 dol
lars worth of short term jobs
! available.
For those of a more academic
bent, there are many positions
open for qualified tutors, both of
high-sclvol and college-aged stu
; dents. There are some lab assis
tant positions available, many
office help jobs, work as delivery
men, and also jobs for which the
students arc paid with room and
I or board.
