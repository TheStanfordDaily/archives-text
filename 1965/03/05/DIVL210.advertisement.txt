| A Groaning World j
The world about us under the pall of death, (Genesis
3:17-19). Paradise is gone, overgrown with thorns and thisles.
The cry of the wild animal reflects the despair and darkness of
a dying world. All creation awaits the Spring of Christ's return.
"For all creation is waiting patiently and hopefully for that
future day when God will glorify His children. For on that day,
thorns and thistles, sin, death, and decay that overcame the
world against its will, at God's command will all disappear,
and the world around tis will share in the glorious freedom
from sin which God's children enjoy. For we know that even
the things of nature, like animals and plants, groan in sickness
and death as they await this great event. And even we Chris
tians although we have the witness of the Holy Spirit within
us, aren't free from trouble: we too wait anxiously for that day
when God will give us full rights as His children, including
the new hodies He has promised us â€”bodies that will not be
sick again and that will never die" (Romans 8:18-23).
While God has promised to intervene again in human af
fairs in a drastic way and restore the world to order, a large
number will be left out, banished into onter darkness by their
refusal to accept 1 lis way of doing things
The question, is do YOU know the overwhelming victory
and new life which God offers freely today, even as the sands
of time are running out? Have YOU discovered reality as it j
really is, the life of Jesus Christ our Lord? Don't be swept away
with the perishing and lost in a dying world, receive today
God's great gift to you. Your prayer of trust in Jesus Christ
is all God asks of you.
