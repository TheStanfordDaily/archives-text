Stephen Jaeger , , . „ , .
b.b.a., Unir. of Pittsburgh District Sales Office, is a good example of how it
works. His first assignment, in January, 1963,
was in the Administrative Department where he had the opportunity to
become familiar with procedures and communications between dealerships
and the District Office. In four months he moved ahead to the Sales Plan
ning and Analysis Department as an analyst. He studied dealerships in
terms of sales history, market penetration and potentials, and model mix.
This information was then incorporated into master plans for the District.
In March, 1964, he was promoted to Zone Manager—working directly with
19 dealers as a consultant on all phases of their complex operations. This
involves such areas as sales, finance, advertising, customer relations and
business management. Responsible job? You bet it is—especially for a man
not yet 25 years old. Over one million dollars in retail sales, annually, are
involved in just one dealership Steve contacts.
As a growth company in a growth industry, Ford Motor Company offers
an exceptionally wide spectrum of job opportunities. The chances are good
that openings exist in your field of interest. See our representative when
he visits your campus. We are looking for men who want responsibility —
and will be ready for it when it comes.
