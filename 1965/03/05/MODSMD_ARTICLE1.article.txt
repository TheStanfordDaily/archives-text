• U.S. 4 Aggression* Denounced
MOSCOW The Soviet Union accused
the United States of "acts of planned aggres
sion" in Viet N'um and said they were "an indi
cation that the United States is embarking
upon the road of further extending the war in
Southeast Asia.''
Referring to U.S. air raids on North Viet
Nam, a statement distributed yesterday by the
Soviet news agency Tass said:
"Such actions of the United States are in
compatible with pronouncements about the de
sire to improve relations with the Soviet
Union.
"Moreover, they undermine the founda
tion on which alone relations between the
U.S.S.R. and the United States can be culti
vated, namely the principle of peaceful coex
istence."
The statement was read to U.S. Ambassa

dor Foy D. Kuhler by Foreign Minister Andrei
A. Gromyko last night.
"The U.S. government," the statement said,
"must be aware of the far-reaching conse
quences the developments in Viet Nam may
have for the international situation as a whole
and for Soviet-American relations in particu
lar, if the United States sticks to its present
course."
• Communists Stone i!.S. Embassy
MOSCOW — Hundreds of screaming Red
Chinese and Vietnamese students stoned and
spattered the U.S. Embassy yesterday, beat
back police, scuffled with soldiers and dis
persed only when army reinforcements moved
in. Shouting, "Down with American imperal
ism," the demonstrators denounced U.S. air
strikes in Viet Nam.
U.S. Ambassador Foy D. Kohler delivered
a stiff protest, declaring police protection had
been inadequate. It was the second attack on
the embassy within a month. Foreign Min

ister Andrei A. Gromyko apologized, promised
to pay for the damage, and said greater mea
sures would be taken for protection of the
embassy in the future.
• Castro Implies U,S. Invasion
HAVANA, Cuba --- Prime Minister Fidel
Castro called Wednesday night for "full sup
port and aid" for North Viet Nam from "all
Socialist countries."
In a speech to a sugar workers' meeting
outside Havana, he said, "We are sorry that
we are not near North Viet Nam so that Cuba
could help North Viet Nam with all its means
including antiaircraft guns and planes with
their pilots." He implied that if the United

States is not stopped in its air attacks against
North Viet Nam it would attack other coun
tries, intimating that Cuba would be next.
"If the imperialist aggression is not
stopped," Castro said, "it will be one thing
today and tomorrow another."
STATE AND LOCAL
• Kuehel Eyes Governorship
SACRAMENTO — Two Republican legis
lators said yesterday there was a strong pos
sibility that U.S. Sen. Thomas Kuchel would
run for governor of California in 1966.
Assemblyman William T. Bagley of San
Rafael and John G. Veneman of Modesto told
newsmen they had talked with Kuchel in
Washington this week "and he wants the door
left open for his possible entry into the gov
ernor's race."
Neither assemblyman would say directly if

Kuchei would run but stated he was consider*
ing the matter seriously.
• Gasoline Tax liaise In Sight
SACRAMENTO The first major tax
boost of the session passed the Senate yester
day, a bill to raise the statewide gasoline tax
one cent for nine months to rebuild Northern
California's flood-destroyed roads.
The bill by Sen. Randolph Collier, D-Yreka.
moved to the Assembly on a 30-3 vote after
half an hour's debate. Its fate there is uncer
tain, as Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Unruh
said earlier in the day he hasn't made up his
mind whether to back the measure.
Three Southern California Republican sen
ators, Gordon Cologne of Indio, Jack Schrade
of San Diego and John Sehmitz of Tustin,
opposed the emergency legislation. Assembly,
men from the south also may oppose the bill
in the lower house.
