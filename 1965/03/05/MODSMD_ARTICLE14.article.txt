JIMMY SMITH has eclipsed all house records at Basin Street
West. With a trio composed of organ, guitar, and drums, the veteran
jazzman has drawn huge crowds nightly. Curiously, there is an
astoundingly high percentage of women at the sets.
Tilt: MODERN JAZZ QUARTET is slated to follow Jimmy Smith,
for a twelve day run starting March 10. LENNY BRUCE will return
to the club for a week during spring vacation.
The RAMSEY LEWIS TRIO, a swinging, blues and gospel oriented
jazz group, opened at the Jazz Workshop Tuesday. Future plans in
clude the GERRY MULLIGAN QUARTET, March 16; the AHMAD
JAMAL TRIO, March 30; the MOSE ALLISON TRIO, April 13.
JOE BUSHKIN'S stay at El Matador is extended through March
15. His sets have attracted a good number of musicians in and around
the Bay Area, principally due to the presence of the great Jo Jones
on drums.
Due to a hand injury, Joao Gilberto has cancelled out of his Mata
dor engagement and flown home to Brazil. His spot will be filled by-
CAE TJADER, who will bring in his quintet on March 16. The
CHARLIE BYRD TRIO will follow on March 29.
JON HENDRICKS' stay at the Trident in Sausalito has been ex
tended for two more weeks. DENNY ZEITLIN, the obstetrician-jazz
pianist who currently plays Monday nights at the club, will take a
week off from the hospital beginning March 22 to entertain his stead
ily increasing body of fans. Zeitlin, who was just listed in the Down
Beat Readers Poll for 1964, is a highly creative musician who is well
worth seeing over spring vacation.
JEAN HOFFMAN, who is virtually the house pianist at the Tri
dent most of the year, is currently at Gatsby's in Sausalito. Like the
Trident, this club charges no cover, door, or minimum; however, this
club is not open to minors.
