# Van Dyke Worth Seeing In Enjoyable 'Sergeants'
## 
### 
If it did nothing else, the pro
duction of "No Time For Ser
geants" now at the Circle Star
Theatre would be worth seeing as
proof that Jerry Van Dyke is
more than just Dick Van Dyke's
brother.
Van Dyke — Jerry, that is
stars as Will Stockdale, the hill
billy private whose blundering
naivete almost ruins the Air
Force. Although the emotional de
mands on the actor playing Will
are hardly exhausting, Van Dyke
proves himself quite a competent
actor with an excellent sense of
comic timing and in ingratiating
personality.
Fortunately, there is much thfcU
is worth seeing in "Sergeants" in
addition to Van Dyke's perform
ance. For although he is on stage
almost throughout the show, he
alone cannot •— and does not
make "Sergeants" the enjoyable
production that it is.
First Rate Support
The supporting cast is uni
formly first rate. Robert Caspar,
as Will's fanatically devoted bud
dy, and Paul Bryar, as the ser
geant who indeed seems to have
no time to call his own, are both

excellent — each providing, in his
own way, an admirable foil for
Van Dyke.
Robert Nash and Henry Hunter, j
as a pair of generals whose care-;
fully laid plans are fouled up by j
Will, are delightfully befuddled j
brass. As a motorcycle-jacketed!
big shot who has had one year of
ROTC Art Alisi is also extremely
good.
Notable in smaller roles (and
often in several roles each) are i
Roy Johnson, Robert Gibbons, Mi
chael Brooks, Robert Hopper, j
Jack Crowder and Ned York.
Wildly Inventive
Responsible for tying the play ;
together and making the variedl
episodes flow smoothly, director
I Ernest Sarracino has staged "Ser-1
geants" with an often wildly in-!
ventive humor. The slow-motion j
fight and the imaginative scene I
changes (particularly one from
one office to another) are only j
two of the most noticeable—and •
outstanding of his ideas.
Hal Shafer's sets are quite effec-1
tive. With the exception of the air
plane—where there wasn't much ;
he could do Ihey are suggestive
j without ever cluttering the stage.
A 1 Millman's lighting is adequate.

often in several roles each) are i

Wildly Inventive
Responsible for tying the play ;
together and making the variedl
episodes flow smoothly, director
I Ernest Sarracino has staged "Ser-1
geants" with an often wildly in-!
ventive humor. The slow-motion j
fight and the imaginative scene I
changes (particularly one from
one office to another) are only j
two of the most noticeable—and •
outstanding of his ideas.
Hal Shafer's sets are quite effec-1
tive. With the exception of the air
plane—where there wasn't much ;
he could do Ihey are suggestive
j without ever cluttering the stage.
A 1 Millman's lighting is adequate.
If it did nothing else, the pro
duction of "No Time For Ser
geants" now at the Circle Star
Theatre would be worth seeing as
proof that Jerry Van Dyke is
more than just Dick Van Dyke's
brother.
Van Dyke — Jerry, that is
stars as Will Stockdale, the hill
billy private whose blundering
naivete almost ruins the Air
Force. Although the emotional de
mands on the actor playing Will
are hardly exhausting, Van Dyke
proves himself quite a competent
actor with an excellent sense of
comic timing and in ingratiating
personality.
Fortunately, there is much thfcU
is worth seeing in "Sergeants" in
addition to Van Dyke's perform
ance. For although he is on stage
almost throughout the show, he
alone cannot •— and does not
make "Sergeants" the enjoyable
production that it is.
First Rate Support
The supporting cast is uni
formly first rate. Robert Caspar,
as Will's fanatically devoted bud
dy, and Paul Bryar, as the ser
geant who indeed seems to have
no time to call his own, are both

excellent — each providing, in his
own way, an admirable foil for
Van Dyke.
Robert Nash and Henry Hunter, j
as a pair of generals whose care-;
fully laid plans are fouled up by j
Will, are delightfully befuddled j
brass. As a motorcycle-jacketed!
big shot who has had one year of
ROTC Art Alisi is also extremely
good.
