### TOM EDISON 
Having followed through with the first stage of its three part
plan to capture second place, Stanford's basketball team will at
tempt to "pull off the final execution of their feat against Cal
this weekend.
The initial step in the Indians' master plan was to defeat

Southern California last Satui â€¢<
day. This was accomplished. Now
all that is left for Stanford is to
make it a two-game sweep against
the Bears. Oh incidently, for Stan
ford to take sole possession of
second the Trojans must lose both
their games to UCLA this week
end which is conceivable. The Tro
jans currently lead the Indians
by one game.
STANFORD PLAYS the Bears
there Friday and return Saturday
to perform for television at 3:00
p.m.
Although the Bears possess a
mere 4-8 conference record, they
' do possess a potent team which
will do anything but play dead
for Stanford. Cal would like
i nothing better than to knock Stan
ford out of second place.
The Bears have shown a vast
j improvement over the first part
of the season and will he at their
| prime against the Tribe. In Ihe
| earlier part of the season Cal lost
to Washington 55-46, Oregon
| State 74-57, and USC 75-55.
They have since bealen them all,
j although by a mere sum of four
i points. But victories are victories,
j you can't lake that away from
l them.
Stanford will have a definite
I height advantage. Cal's tallest
: player is Henderson at G'6". The
; Indians range is much greater.
RAY KOSANKE at 6'9'i" is the
' top man for Stanford. Bob Bedell,
j Indian's leading scorer, and Clay
ton Raaka round out the strength
that Stanford will rely upon if
they hope to dump the improving
Bears.
Don Wolthers is the Bears' top
' scorer with 17 points a game. He

is also their best defensive man.
He has held WSU's Handy Stoll
to five points, Washington's Lynn
Nance to ten, and UCLA's Keith
Erickson to five.
Stanford's play must be superb
and the rebounding must be tops
to win. Like the saying goes, "The
best laid schemes o'mire an d
men gang aft agley."
