# Female Hoopsters Big Game Victors
## 
### 
Stanford's women's basketball
team won its Big Game yesterday,
beating Cal, 32-28. High scorer for
Stanford was Anne Osborn, who
I had 11 points.
The team's seniors got the game
I off to a good start, scoring nine
points in the first quarter, but
Cal tightened it up in the second
half.
