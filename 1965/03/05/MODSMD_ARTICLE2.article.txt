BROOM ON THE ROOFTREE-Pic
tured above is the end of the
world's longest building-a "kly
stron gallery" built atop the
underground two-mile acceler
ator being constructed at Stan
ford under a $114 million con
tract with the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission. The broom tradition
comes from Scandinavian build
ers, while the American flag
(upper right) making the last gir
der is a custom begun by Ameri
can Indian steelworkers and
bridge builders.
