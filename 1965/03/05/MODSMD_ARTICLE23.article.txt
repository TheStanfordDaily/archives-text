## Judicial Bill Isolates Students 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I have written a letter to Presi
dent Sterling urging that the
Board of Trustees veto the Judi
cial Competence Bill enacted by
LASSU on Thursday, February
25. A carbon copy of that letter,
more strongly worded than this
briefer one, is enclosed herewith;
it is too long for the Daily to print,
but I place it with you for public
keeping in order that any mem
ber oi' this university who wishes
may read it.
My reasons for speaking out
against the bill are the following.
First, what ever the apparent
moderation of its wording, it in
fact places all, not merely origi
nal, judicial authority over stu
dent discipline exclusively in the
hands of the Associated Students.
Second, it can only serve to
divide rather than unite the uni
versity as a community, and it
threatens the probability of a
breach, not between students and
administration, but between stu
dents and faculty.
The resolution appears to me,
not to be a step toward creating
the "free, communitarian univer
sity" which certain persons allege
they desire. It seems, rather, a
step toward dividing the univer
sity in such a way that it will no
longer be able to call itself a
"community" at all. 1 presume,
by the way, to read into the now
apparently disreputable label "ad
ministration," also the term "fac
ulty," since I cannot find so sharp
a line between these two parts of
the university in aims and ideals
as some others now seem easily
able to do. The assumption, more
over, that students can only learn
effectively to regulate their con
duct by isolating themselves from
the rest of the community in
which they spend the greater part
of their late adolescent and early
adult lives appears illogical. A
formally and judicially autono
mous "society within a society"
can scarcely hope to generate a
"communitarian university."

• Cartoon Castigated
Editor, The Daily:
Yesterday's editorial cartoon, j
"Tit For Tat," clearly implies that !
j student actions have caused the!
| departure of the Dean of Worn-J
en's staff in retaliation for the!
previous departures of Deans
Craig. Larimer and Lowenstein. I
Such an allegation is totally false, j
Dean Allen's resignation followed
an investigation by a faculty com- 1
mittee.
The other two deans have re
signed because they were not in
sympathy with the way the uni
versity responded to the situation.
Tlie cartoon implies I hat the,
; Crow-Malverson Report was the
product of personal vindictive-:
ness. It ignores the real and im- j
portant issue of academic free- 1
1 dom which was central to that re-:
| port. It also gives credence to the j
unfortunate belief that much:
student activity with regard to j
I university policies is motivated i
primarily by concern over person- ;
alities rather than by concern for!
land dedication to the improve
ment of the university.
Its appearance in the l Daily is
extremely unfortunate.

• Committee Appointed
Editor, The Daily:
Late Wednesday afternoon the
faculty. University officers, and
President Sterling took a c on- j
structive step toward communica
tion with representatives of stu
dent government. A statement
j was given to The Daily at 7:45 j
p.m. that day but did not appear
in Thursday's paper.
Wednesday evening LASSU re
sponded by appointing a commit-j
tee to meet with representatives
of the faculty and University offi-!
cers. This seems to me an affirma-
II ive move toward the dialogue!
The Daily is encouraging, but it
was not mentioned in your report !
of the LASSU session.
Why is constructive action by

students, faculty, and University
|officers not fit to print in the
Peninsula's only morning news
paper?

EDITOR'S NOTE: The Daily
shares Professor Dornbusch's
concern that the COUP policy
statement and the report of
LASSU's subsequent action did
not appear in The Daily yester
day. This omission was en
tirely unintentional, resulting
from the pressures of tune and
circumstance. The text of the
policy statement appears on the
front page of today's Daily.
• Viet-INam Petition
Editor, The Daily:
The following statement, to be
sent to President Johnson next
Tuesday, is being circulated
among faculty and academic staff
for signatures:
"We protest the escalation of
war in S.E. Asia. We urge imme
diate and intensive negotiations
to end our military involvement
in Viet Nam, to be followed by
offers of aid for reconstruction.
Every American bomb over South
Viet Nam and especially over
North Viet Nam is a blow to
American's position as champion
of international law and world
peace."
Copies of the statement are
available in room 3S3F of the
Mathematics department, physics
corner, for persons willing to sign
or assist in the circulation.

CORRECTION
The resignation referred to yes
terday in Miss Stella Hammond's
letter was that of Dean Bonnie
Eitzwater. Events happening in
the interval between receipt of
the letter and its publication made
it appear to refer to Dean Eliza
beth Avery's resignation.
