# McDonald: Teachers Should Learn Techniques Of Educational Research
## 
### 
Teachers need to have a solid grounding
in the techniques and uses of education;!
research as well as in the arts of the class
room, a Stanford educator is convinced.
Prof. Frederick J. McDonald, of Stan
ford's School of Education, in a paper pre
pared for a recent meeting of the Western
Regional Conference on Educational Re
search, stresses that simultaneously learn
ing how to teach and to do research on
learning "should become as characteristic
of the professional schools of education as
the case method is for the law and btisi
ness schools."
MeDONAM), who holds posts ol
associate professor of education and psy
chology, emphasizes the value of the "em
pirieal inductive" mode of thinking, like that
used in the natural sciences and medicine,
as opposed lo the "theoretical-deductive"
method, like that used in philosophy, which
is "weak hut preferred" by today's educa
tors.
A massive national program to qualify
teachers to do their own educational re
search would "create a critical mass of
school personnel" who will "turn to re
search to solve problems, not lo justify
what ii is doing, or happens to think is a

good idea."
''Ii will shift the locus ol decision-mak
ing from the (teachers' > lunchroom and
from the proliferating committees through
out our systems lo the research team," lie
writes.
"IT is now dear," he continues, "that
education will have to change, in the next
two dccades at most, from a practical art
to an applied science. This nation has been
progressively committing itself to educa
tion, and is now beyond the point where its
schools can be left to tinkerers or marau
ders.
"The country-doctor image of the Ameri
can teacher, the hard-working, common
sense school teacher who knows the tricks
of his trade, is a silly myth, ;ind perpetuat
ing it does a disservice to the intelligence
and imagination of many teachers.
The basic problem. Prof. McDonald em
phasizes. is lo change the teaching profes
sion > mode of thinking about how profes
sional knowledge is produced and how to
evaluate It. The only way to do this, he
maintains, is lo engage the teacher "in
some form of research activity while he is
training for teaching."
"Till'', (iO\l,S should be to nei the be

ginning practitioner to d<> some hypothesis
making and testing," he believes. "The way
to learn something about research is to do
it, to be near people who do it, and from
whom you can learn, whose interest and
enthusiasm will botli fire and sustain you."
The organization capable of funding
such a massive attack on the phase of the
teaching profession is the U.S. Office of
Education. Prof. McDonald suggests de
veloping programs supported by grants for
teachers to research on learning.
The purpose, even to letting a teacher
try out ideas that prove not testable, would
be to give him "research experience on the
problems that capture his interest, not to
make him a research worker or necessar
ily produce a piece of publishabie research,"
Prof. McDonald feels.
"We have preached piously that the
practitioner ought to read research and
look at the data available to him. He is not
trained to do so, and we have not demon
strated lo him how such activities will make
a difference."
This massive assault, he concludes, is
no| on the problems of doing research in
schools, but on the problems of engaging
the schools in doin:* research.
