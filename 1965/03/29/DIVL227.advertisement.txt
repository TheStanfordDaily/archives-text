The words "The just shall live by faith", found in the Old
Testament (Habakuk 2:4) and quoted in Romans (1 :16, 17)
brought Martin Luthor to accept and receive Jesus Christ as
his personal Savior in the winter of 1 512.
To many, the word "faith" means "1 hope God is real, but
I'm not sure". But faith as the Bible uses the term means trust,
reliance, and daily dependence on the actual and living Lord,
Jesus Christ. Every individual who would know God must
first take a step "in faith", as Martin Luther did, claiming
Jesus Christ as personal Redeemer and Lord. God always re
sponds to those who seek to know 1 lim personally, so that be
lievers in Christ are those who have no doubt whatsoever about
the reality of their personal relationship to Him. "Draw near
to God and I le will draw near to you" (James 4 :8).
The Bible contrasts "sight", which is depending on natural
reason and sensory inputs, with "faith", which is depending on
God and what lie has said in the Bible. "Without faith it is
impossible to please God, for he that comes to God must be
lieve that 1 le is and that I le rewards those who diligently seek
Him" (I lebrews 11 :6).
Temporarily, at least, faith may ignore the evidence of the
senses, the emotions and natural reasoning in order to press
for answers from God who is the Source of all things. "... we
look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are
unseen ; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things
that are unseen are eternal" (2 Corinthinians 4:16. 17 ).
It may seem to come that in God is "blind faith", but such
is not the case. Rather, the limited vision brought bv man's senses
and human reasoning is subordinated to a deeper way of seeing
all of life through the eyes of faith. "Faith is the assurance of
things hoped for. the conviction of things not seen . . . by faith
we understand that the world was created by the word of God,
so that what is seen was made out of things which do not appear"
(Hebrews 11 :13).
Faith in the God of the Bible is something which really
works, something which brings broader and deeper answers to
the meaning of life. Because faith works in experience, and be
cause God demonstrates 1 limself to the satisfaction of any indi
vidual who wants to get acquainted with I lim, why not find out
fo'- vourself bv niviting lesus Christ into vour life todav —
