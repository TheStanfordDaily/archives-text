• WO Die After Chilean Quakes
SANTIAGO, Chile — A giant earthquake
struck central Chile yesterday killing at least
400 persons, injuring 155 and leaving 200 in
habitants of a farming area missing in the
collapse of a dam.
The 230-foot-high El Cobre dam near La
Calera, 70 miles north of Santiago, broke un
der the crushing force of the massive earth
movement. Flood waters swept away more
than 80 farmhouses, leaving the fate of many
inhabitants unknown.
Up and down this elongated mountain
land, the earth shook. But the full force of
the quake hit the central provinces of Acon
cagua, Valparaiso, Coquimbo and Santiago,
where a third of Chile's 7.8 million people live.
• Laotian Kevolt Reported
VIETIANE, Laos — Supporters of ousted

Deputy Premier PJioutni Nosavan staged a
small-scale military revolt yesterday and seized
Thakhek, a city on the Thailand border 100
miles southeast of here, according to reports
reaching Vientiane. Laotion officials in Vien
tiane showed little concern.
The reports said rumors in the Mekong
River city were that Phoumi would attempt to
return to Laos from his exile in Thailand.
Phoumi, a rightist general, fled into exile
early in February after an unsuccessful mili
tary coup aimed at restoring his supremacy in
the Laotian army.
• China Stops Rnss. Aid To Hanoi
MOSCOW — Communist China is refusing
to let the Soviet Union ship arms through
China or fly them over its territory to North
Viet Nam, Communist sources reported yes
terday.
Specifically, the Chinese will not permit
Soviet antiaircraft missiles through, one in
formant said.

Efforts to move weapons across China by
rail were running into delays, with some
freight cars shunted onto sidings, the sources
said.
There was no official confirmation of such
difficulty. But a failure of Soviet weapons to
arrive in Hanoi would fit into Chinese accusa
tion that Moscow has failed to aid Viet Nam
because of alleged efforts to win U.S. favor.

• King Plans Alabama Boycott
SAN FRANCISCO — Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. announced yesterday his intention to
call for an economic boycott on goods made in
Alabama.

"1 will call on the nation," King said, "to
rise up in a firm action program."
He said he thought conditions in Alabama
had degenerated to such a "low level of social
disruption" that it was necessary to bring
pressures on Gov. George C. Wallace.
At a news conference, King explained that
he did not intend an "eternal boycott."
"I would call first for something like a
10-day withdrawal," said King. "Then if
nothing was done, I'd call for a repeat of the
boycott."
He said he would discuss the plan with
board members of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference Thursday and Friday
in Baltimore. He said he didn't expect that ac
tion would be taken within the next two weeks.
In addition to assistance from unions, he
said he would call on the American people to
refuse to buy Alabama products. He said he
would also ask the federal government to
withhold federal funds for projects in Ala
ibama.

• K.K.K, II (nits I o Set* L.B.J.
ATLANTA — Klan leaders from Georgia,
and Alabama telegraphed President Johnson
yesterday requesting a conference to discuss
the President's attack on the Ku Klux Klan.
Calvin F. Craig, Georgia grand dragon of
United Klans of America Inc., said the tele
gram asking the conference was sent yester
day shortly after noon. It was signed by Craig
and Robert M. Shelton Jr. of Tuscaloosa, im
iXM-ial wizard of the United Klans.
The request followed angry denunciations
of the President by Klan leaders after John
son declared war on the hooded order Friday.
The President served warning to Klansmen
when he announced the arrest of four Alabama
Klansmen in the night-rider slaying of a white
civil rights worker.
