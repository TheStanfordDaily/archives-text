# Judicial Bill Fate Remains In Doubt
## Trustees Hear Sterling On LASSU Measure; Committee Unresolved 
### JONATHAN ROISE Associate Editor 
| The status of the Judicial Competence Hill, passed by LASSU j
j 94-18 on February 25, is still in doubt with only three days remain-1
j ing before its April 1 implementation date.
The Board of Trustees received a report on the legislature's!
I move from President Wallace Sterling at its regular!} scheduled

meeting March 18, but took no
j act ion on it.
j In the meanwhile, a 15-man
! committee of students, faculty,
and deans has been discussing the
bill since March 10, without reach
, ing any major compromises.
Sterling is personally heading
this committee.
Judicial Bill
The bill asserted that as of
April 1, "no student conduct may
be adjudged a violation of the
J Fundamental Standard |by ASSU
judicial councils| by virtue of
i having been contrary to Univer
sity policy unless such policy has
previously been officially com
municated to the ASSU President
and lias been recognized by a two
thirds vote of Legislature. . . ."
The University has not yet com
; municated any statements of pol
; icy in this manner.
! Speaker of LASSU Ed Shaw, a
j member of the Committee of 15,
; told The Daily last night that the
j five students on the committee
would present a report on their
progress at Thursday's LASSU
meeting.
Sterling told The Daily yester
day that he had "no idea" as to
whether the committee could
reach some sort of compromise
! before Thursday. He said he felt
; that the pressure of t lie deadline
was "impractical."
"I think what we need is time."
! lie said.
Constitutionality
In regard to the bill itself, Ster
ling noted that "there has been
; some doubt as to whether it is
! constitutional."
Sterling refused to divulge the
nature or content of his report
to the Board of Trustees, other
i than to say that the Board was
| not required to make any immedi-
I ate decisions.
"No inference should be taken
from this inaction," Sterling told
The Daily, and emphasized that
the Board's failure to reject the
I LASSU proposal could not be con

[strued as approval of the sug
; gested judicial changes.
Under the provisions of th e
ASSU Constitution, the bill, which
passed in the form of an ASSU
By-Laws change, does not require
approval of the Board of Trustees
or the president of the Univer
sity. The Board, however, is the
I body which granted the right of
| self-government to die Stanford
I studentry, and can, by that token.
| veto any action taken by the
| Associated Students.
Without Support
; In the meanwhile, should the'
'ASSU bill go into effect without'
i the support of the administration,!
the ASSU judicial councils would
be left in a state in which they
could not enforce any violation of
I presently-standing University pol
icy.
"We cannot operate in a void,"
Sterling emphasized to The Daily.
He refused, however, to explain
what form of disciplinary control
would be exerted upon the student
body in such a case.
Prof. Benjamin Page, chairman
of the Executive Committee of the
Academic Council and a member
j of the Committee of 15, said yes
j tcrday that the discussions of the
j latter group had "centered around
'the aims and objectives that lay
j behind the judicial competence
| bill." He hestitated to say whether
| this meant that the group would
| produce a compromise accept
: able to both the administration
! and the students.
Position of Student
j He did say that he thought
"some good will come out of this
! rather thorough consideration of
'the position of the student in re
gard to University policy."
The Committee of 15 was
formed after the passage of the
Judicial Competence Bill in re-!
| sponse to a joint statement by the
Committee on University Policy,
;of which Sterling is chairman, j
j and the Advisory Board of the
1 Academic Council.
