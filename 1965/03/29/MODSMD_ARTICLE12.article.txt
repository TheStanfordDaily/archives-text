# Black Muslim Speaks Today
## 
### 
Bernard E. Cushmeer, minis
tor of a Black Muslim mosque in
Sun Francisco, will appear on
campus today under the sponsor
ship of the Political Union.
His speech will be at 4:15 in
Memorial Auditorium.
Cushmeer, who has been a fol
lower of Elijah Muhammad's
Black Muslim movement for the
past ten years, describes tho goals
of the movement as universal
peace, brotherly love, and "a home
somewhere on this earth that we
can call our own."
Although he is primarily con
cerned with "delivering the mes
sage of the Honorable Elijah Mu
hammad to my own people,"
Cushmeer agreed to an informa
tional meeting open to the pub
lic. In accepting, Cushmeer stated
that he does not expect to make
many if any -converts at the
meeting.
Cushmeer believes that the Civil
Rights Bill will not solve the prob
lem between the black and white
man in America, nor will CORE
or NAACP, even though these
groups "have done the best they
can according to what they have."
