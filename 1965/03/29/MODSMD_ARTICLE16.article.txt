## 
### PETE KING

came up with several best-ever
performances Saturday in Stan

ner and Paul Schlicke contributed
most to the victory, although
Larry Questad, Bob Stoecker, Jim

sprint, and caught the tiring Spar
tans at the tape, lunging to the
inside of Gibeau to win by inches.
The time was 1:51.7, his best ever.

Spartans far behind as ho won
the two-mile in 9:01 with a power
ful finishing kick.

shot 53-8 1 , also his best, but did
not score.
Eshelman pole-vaulted 15-6 1 u to
lie teammate Chuck Smith, who
had broken his own Stanford rec
ord with a 15-Bvault the week
before. Eshelman then barely
missed 16-1.
Ken Fraser held off two San
Jose runners to capture the 440;
Tyler Wilkins threw the discus
169-1 v i, his best, to take third;
and John Goode scored an im
portant third-place point in the

a spindly 5-foot- 10-inch high
jumper, leaped 6-10 to break a
nine-year-old varsity record and
a 12-year-old freshman mark.
