# Cards Finish Well In Winter Sports
## 
### PETE KING 
A strong Stanford end-of-the
quarter athletic effort was re
warded with two second places
and one third in the conference,
as the Indians atoned for a lack
luster winter sports season early
this month.
Clayton Raaka and Kent Hinck
ley boosted the basketball team to
two wins over arch-rival Califor
nia, 86-79 and 72-59, on March 5-6.
It was the fourth straight year
Stanford has won the cage series
with the Bears, the Tribe's fifth
consecutive victory on Cal's court,
and their ninth win in 11 starts
against the Bears.
WHILE Stanford was breaking
over, under, around, and through
the hapless Bears, UCLA was
graciously handing IJSC a pair of
defeats, which shot Stanford into
second place in the PAC for the
third time in four years (the
I fourth time Stanford tied with
UCLA for the title).
Raaka scored 22 points in the
first Cal game, a career high.
Most of Rock's points came under
neath the basket on feeds from
the guards. Hinckley tallied 11
and 17 in the two games, sparking
a second half Card rally which
i clinched the second victory.
| Stanford finished the season
I with a 15-8 record, and 9-5 in the
j conference.
WRESTLING
i Heavyweight Bruce Wilhclm led
1 Stanford to second place in the

prised Oregon State's A 1 Makin

SWIMMING
Stanford's sophomore and jun
ior swimmers performed well in
the conference meet, as Stanford
j took a distant third behind USC
1 and Oregon. Coach Jim Gaughran

last year's Olympic champ in the
400-meter medley with a world
