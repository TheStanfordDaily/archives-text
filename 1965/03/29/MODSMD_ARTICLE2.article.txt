# Cal in Arms Over Action By Regents
## Grad Students Barred from Gov. 
### JAMES BRISCOE Managing Editor 
I lie Berkeley campus of the
I Diversity of California has
again erupted into turmoil; this
time on the question of gradu
ate students joining the Asso
ciate Student organization.
Graduate students voled to join
the organization last week by a
five to three margin, but th e
Board of Regents rejected the
plan at their Friday meeting on
the grounds that less than 50
per cent of the graduate students
voted on the question.
Saturday night, however, the
student Senate decided to ignore
the ruling of the Regents and
proceed with ratification of the
constitutional amendment and the
election of ten graduate members
to the Senate.
The elections, originally sched
uled for today and tomorrow,
were ordered postponed for a
week by the Judicial Council be
cause tlie text of the proposed
constitutional amendment had not
been published in the student
paper.
University Policy
According to University Presi
dent Clark Kerr, the regents
based their decision on a long
existing policy that any actions
which would impose compulsory
fees must be voted on by at least
half of the group involved. Ap
proximately 32 per cent of the
graduate students voted in last
weeks election.
The Graduate Coordinating
Council, largest existing graduate
group called the action "med
dling." A spokesman for the FSM
reportedly said, "We'll have to hit
them."
