## Liberals Propose KKK Investigation 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Congressman Weltner of Georgia has proposed that the House
Committee on Un-Ameriean Activities investigate the Ku Klux
Klan, which proposal has made him an overnight darling in liberal
quarters. Strange, considering that those most overwhelmed by the
idea of investigating the KKK tend to be precisely the same bodies

who urge the abolition of the
Committee. But never mind the
inconsistency for the moment.
What about the proposal?
The KKK is essentially a terror
organization, whose activities in
the generation since Justice Hugo
Black was a member of it appear
to have evolved from emphasis on
physical terrorism (lynchings,
floggings, burnings) to psycho
logical terrorism (spook-specta
cles—vivid reminders of its for
mer militancy—parades, public ex
postulations, objurgations,
threats). The House Committee on
Un-American Activities is by law
enjoined to investigate — as the
Committee's name suggests — or
ganized activities that conspire
against American freedom, and
there is no reasonable doubt in
my mind, or (in this solitary case)
anyone else's, that the KKK seeks
to do precisely that, namely, to
diminish the freedom of those
members of the community whose
race or religion differ from that
of the Imperial Wizard.
A Technical Weakness
The House Committee suffers
from a technical weakness which
neatly serves up both the liberals
and the conservatives with the
present dilemma. On the one hand
the conservatives have quite
rightly asserted that an investi
gating committee of Congress
should keep its eyes on the Com
munist movement so as to focus
national attention on its mcichina
tions and to contrive obstructive
legislation. On the other hand the J
liberals have quite rightly pointed
out that the mandate of the Com
mittee — the pursuit of "un-
American activities" — is danger
ously broad. What we see today
is an ironic consequence of one
faction pressing its dislike of
"right wing" fanaticism (the
KKK) at the expense of its own
reservations about the investigat
ing powers of Congress.
When the liberals howl that ;
what is un-American is a matter
of judgment, and sometimes even !
of taste, they are, to an impor- i
tant extent, correct. Conservatives 1
haven't given sufficient thought !
to the serious element of liberal '
criticisms of HUAC for the very j
good reason that they suspect that
the liberal critics of HUAC are
ultimately moved by the desire
to persecute anybody and any
thing that investigates, and ha
rasses Communists.

Now we are up against it.
Congressman We 11 ne r believes
the KKK is un-American. I agree
with him. Does it follow that
HUAC should investigate the
KKK? I happen to believe that
the Committee of Correspondence
(which conspires to bring on uni
lateral disarmament) is un-Amer
ican. Should HUAC investigate
it? I believe the committees set
up to abolish right-to-work pri
vileges are un-American. Investi
gate? Clearly not.
Committee on
Communist Activities
We need to distinguish between
the Communist threat, which is
pre-eminent, and backed by the
thermonuclear power of tlie de
clared enemy of most any view
of the American way of life, and
other threats. We need a Commit
tee on Communist Activities,
which is the name HUAC should
in my judgment adopt, and in so
doing, clarify its mission. Then
when the need arises for a federal
agency to investigate other ac
tivities, let an ad hoc committee
do so, having made the prima
facie case before Congress why a
particular organization should be
looked into. Such a reform in the
present system should please
those liberals who believe (as I
do) that HUAC's license is too
broad; and please also those con
servatives who on the one hand
desire continuing vigilance over
Communist activity, and on the
other hand are willing to acknow
ledge that HUAC's powers are
too broad for good measure.
Should HUAC — meanwhile —
go ahead and investigate the
KKK? My own vote would be in
favor of the Committee's doing so
even while recognizing the danger
of using the broad franchise
HUAC now has. But to conduct
such an investigation might have
the salutary result of uniting ex
plicit liberal reservations about
HUAC with implicit conservative
reservations. The quarrel would
go on — over whether or not
Communist (let alone Left) activi
ties should be looked into by a
Committee of Congress. But at
least the factions might be
brought together in agreement
that the Committee's franchise
should be more narrowly defined.
