## Dolwig Shows Blindness With Liquor Legislation 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to comment 011 Senator
Richard J. Dolwig's attempts to
tighten the control over drinking
habits of students by forbidding
restaurants closer than one and 1
one-half miles from campus to
serve liquor.
1) Though I cannot back this
up statistically, my impression is
that there is a persistent tendency
for some students in most West
ern countries to get drunk from
time to time.
2). While some of the reasons
for this may be obscure, one which
is identifiable is that students are
interested in finding out what it
is like.
3) One other important reason
is that the consumption of alcohol
is widely accepted among adults,
though drunkenness may not be,
and students {ire anxious to dis
cover where the boundary is, and
how it can be recognized in them
selves.
4) Students arc going to drink
anyway, and this isn't necessarily
detrimental to themselves or
others, and in some cases may be
highly beneficial by helping to re
lease tensions ere.'ited in the aca
demic environment.

5) As students are going to
drink anyway, is it a sensible pol
icy to make them drive automo
biles l\ii miles to get it, so that
their return trip is likely to make
them a danger to themselves and
to others?
6) Thus isn't it safer to allow
students to drink and get drunk
as close to campus as possible?
Under these conditions, students
would be enabled to make their
experiments, release inhibitions
and tensions, and enjoy them
i selves without endangering lives.
7) Needless to say, the same
j arguments apply to amending the
i fundamental standard to allow al-
I cohol on campus.
8) To those who fear that if!
restrictions arc lifted student life
would become one vast Bac
chanalian Revel, that students
would be distracted from Ihcir
studies, and that they would be
encouraged to bccome alcoholics,
I can only reply that such revels
occur anyway, that their danger
is directly proportional to the dis
tance students have to drive to
get to them, and that those who j
become alcoholics would havel
reached that condition anyway,
