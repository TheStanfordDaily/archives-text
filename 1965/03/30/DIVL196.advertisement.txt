The road to management is a two-way street at
Ford Motor Company. On one side of the street,
the college graduate brings to us his talents,
|j|P abilities and ambitions. Then it is up to us to
ensure that he realizes his full potential.

mm- development. One method is periodic evaluations.

A Amu p ursue j n developing his capabilities. These
8.5., Columbia University performance reviews are prepared at least once
a year by the employe's immediate supervisor,
reviewed by higher management and discussed with the employe.
In addition, there are frequent reviews and analyses of individual perform
ance in which promotions, salary increases and developmental moves are
planned. These programs are so important that each division and staff has a
special section responsible for administering them. One of the people who
helps oversee these programs is Toby Kahr. His experience is also an
example of how a college graduate benefits from these programs.
In 1963, Toby completed our College Graduate Program. During these
first two years, he gained a depth of experience in Company policies involv
ing all aspects of employe relations. Currently he supervises the Personnel
Planning and Training Section of our Steel Division. In essence, Toby is
helping to implement the program that led to his own career development.
Programs such as these are intended to make certain that your perform
ance at Ford Motor Company will be recognized ;and will determine how
fast you'll move ahead. The development of future managerial material is
one of our fundamental goals. See our representative when he visits your
campus. Something good may develop for you.
