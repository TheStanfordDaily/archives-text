I love a man in Van Heusen "417"
IVs wild, the way his Ion?, lean
good looks come on strong in that
"V-Tapered" fit. Anyone can tell
he's top man on my scene when he
steps out in the stepped-up styling of
authentic Button-Downs or smooth
Snap-Tabs. And the added
attraction of Van Heusen spring
fabrics and colors make him my
favorite distraction.

If V-Taperâ€”for the leatt trim look.
