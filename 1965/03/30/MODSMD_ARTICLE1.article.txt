• Itomb Wrecks L .S. Embassy
SAIGON, Viet Nam — A huge bomb ex
ploded at the United States Embassy in Saigon
today, killing and wounding scores of Ameri
cans and Vietnamese. Some American offi
cials were reported among the casualties.
The tremendous force of the bomb esti
mated to weigh 250 pounds — killed as many
as 20 Vietnamese.
At least seven Americans were carried,
badly wounded, from tho five-story concrete
structure. Most of the wounded Americans
were women secretaries. First reports said
three Americans were dead.
• Reds Charge Hinder Violation
SAIGON, South Viet Nam — U.S. Navy
planes dumped 45 tons of bombs on North
Vietnamese radar and other installations on
Bach Long Island yesterday to pursue a de

molition job started last Friday. Forty-two
fighter-bombers and an escort of unannounced
strength made the raid.
In the process, they stirred a charge from
Radio Peking that eight planes violated Red
China's airspace near Hainan Island, 80 miles
east of Bach Long. However, though Hainan
is a base for MIG interceptors, the raiders
sighted no aerial challenge.

a Vatican birth control commission to con
clude its work urgently and courageously,
without leaving Roman Catholics "exposed to
uncertainties."
His remarks — published in a Vatican an
nouncement that broke the secrecy surround
ing the work of the commission — appeared
to be an exhortation to its members to over

come reported divisions concerning use of the
new contraceptive pills.

PASADENA, Calif. — Dr. Charles Richter
of the California Institute of Technology said
his instruments recorded "a major earth
quake," probably in the Vicinity of the Aleu

Richter said the quake, centered about 3,500
miles from Pasadena, was comparable in mag
nitude to the one which took a heavy toll in
life and property Sunday in Chile.
He rated the quake at 7.1 on the Richter
Scale, a method of calculating the magnitude
of quakes.

campaign.
Wallace's office said only that he would
meet at 9:30 a.m. today with a committee of
civil rights leaders. An informed source said
that it would be essentially the same group
that failed to see Wallace last Thursday after

today, killing and wounding scores of Ameri

The tremendous force of the bomb esti
mated to weigh 250 pounds — killed as many

SAIGON, South Viet Nam — U.S. Navy
planes dumped 45 tons of bombs on North
Vietnamese radar and other installations on
Bach Long Island yesterday to pursue a de

fighter-bombers and an escort of unannounced
strength made the raid.
In the process, they stirred a charge from
Radio Peking that eight planes violated Red
China's airspace near Hainan Island, 80 miles
east of Bach Long. However, though Hainan
is a base for MIG interceptors, the raiders
sighted no aerial challenge.
