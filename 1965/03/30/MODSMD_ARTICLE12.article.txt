Fred Goff, head sponsor at Wil
bur, thought that "the kind of
constructive dialogue that th e
booklet asks for has already be
gun at Wilbur."
"Many freshmen," he said,
"went into fraternities during the
open-houses looking for such a
dialogue, and it is good to see
criticism coming from within the
system."
Golf said, "I doubt whether
huge changes will be made in the
fraternities, but there should be
some improvements as a result
of criticism."
"As it is," he continued, "rush
is relatively inhuman to freshmen.
. . . They take what may be super
ficial decisions very hard." He ex
pressed his personal preference
for a draw system.
Dean Summers Opt imist it-
Robert Summers, Dean of Fra
ternities at Stanford, argued that
"fraternities should and will adapt
to changing conditions. . . . They
will not be abolished."
"Fraternities are in a dynamic
situation," said Summers, "and
they will continue to adapt to
t heir changing conditions. . . . The
serious problems that indeed exist
can be worked out."
He saiil that "the dialogue be
ing sought is a healthy thing,"
but "criticism should be kept
in perspective.
He cited the "mutual concern"
of fraternity members for each
other as a major advantage of
fraternities over independent liv
ing. Ho called the new clusters"
the beginning of a great program,
perhaps the best in the country."
As evidence of an improving
situation, Summers argued that
"rush has gone better than ever
this year," and that the men's
GPA for the clusters is above the
all-men's average.
Gordon Welcomes Dialogue
Robert Gordon, Dean of Men,
felt that the results of criticism
will become more "legible with
time."
"I think the dialogue will open
up issues that need to be aired."
said Gordon, "and I hope that the
fraternities will respond to criti
cisms offered in good faith." He
said, "The intent of criticism is
not negative; it's motive is to
arouse concern."

Gordon Welcomes Dialogue
Robert Gordon, Dean of Men,
felt that the results of criticism
will become more "legible with
time."
"I think the dialogue will open
up issues that need to be aired."
said Gordon, "and I hope that the
fraternities will respond to criti
cisms offered in good faith." He
said, "The intent of criticism is
not negative; it's motive is to
arouse concern."
The authors of the controver
sial fraternity critique "A Second
Look' will meet with freshmen

lounge.
According to co-author Leith
Anderson, the group hopes to
"make? specific some of the gen
eralizations in the booklet."
"We will answer any questions
that are raised," he said.
Key Figures Comment
Fred Goff, head sponsor at Wil
bur, thought that "the kind of
constructive dialogue that th e
booklet asks for has already be
gun at Wilbur."
"Many freshmen," he said,
"went into fraternities during the
open-houses looking for such a
dialogue, and it is good to see
criticism coming from within the
system."
Golf said, "I doubt whether
huge changes will be made in the
fraternities, but there should be
some improvements as a result
of criticism."
"As it is," he continued, "rush
is relatively inhuman to freshmen.
. . . They take what may be super
ficial decisions very hard." He ex
pressed his personal preference
for a draw system.
Dean Summers Opt imist it-
Robert Summers, Dean of Fra
ternities at Stanford, argued that
"fraternities should and will adapt
to changing conditions. . . . They
will not be abolished."
"Fraternities are in a dynamic
situation," said Summers, "and
they will continue to adapt to
t heir changing conditions. . . . The
serious problems that indeed exist
can be worked out."
He saiil that "the dialogue be
ing sought is a healthy thing,"
but "criticism should be kept
in perspective.
He cited the "mutual concern"
of fraternity members for each
other as a major advantage of
fraternities over independent liv
ing. Ho called the new clusters"
the beginning of a great program,
perhaps the best in the country."
As evidence of an improving
situation, Summers argued that
"rush has gone better than ever
this year," and that the men's
GPA for the clusters is above the
all-men's average.
