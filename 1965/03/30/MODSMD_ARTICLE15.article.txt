versed on the seasonal exploits
this last year of a certain William
Bradley who attends Princeton

trated dealing with the NCAA
' finals in Portland. SI underplayed
I Bradley.
1 It is difficult to judge a player

j in just two games of basketball,
I any player that is except Bill
; Bradley. Bill Bradley is not an
ordinary college basketball player.
I Unless the spectator sees him in
; action, he cannot begin to imagine
I what this man does, consistently.
| To give an example- in the con
solation game Saturday night
j Princeton faced Wichita State.
I The Shockers defense was so put
| rid thai Princeton swiftly ap
j proached the N'CAA record lor
game points. Bradley was also
nearing the record for individual
points in several categories.
As usual Princeton looked 1o
Mr. Bradley for the additional
points. As usual, he responded.
I He pul Princeton over the team
! mark with a 25-foot hook shot
from the corner which merely

whipped through the nets. The
generally non-partisan crowd ex
ploded in amazement. With two
minutes remaining Bradley was
taken out.
He only got a minute long
standing ovation because the offi
cials resumed the game. Bill col
lected 58 points, breaking Oscar
Robinson's eight-year-old mark.
Besides scoring one point short
of half of Princeton's 118 points
he also led them in rebounds, as
sists, field goals, free throws,
shooting percentage and numer
ous other classifications in which
statistics are not kept.
The night before, Bradley had
been in foul trouble almost from
the beginning. Just before the end
of the half he collected his third
foul on a very disputable charg
ing call. One minute into the sec
ond half he was caught for his
fourth. Princeton was only down
by four points at the time.
The Tigers switched to a zone
defense to take some of the pres
sure off Bradley. He had to last
nineteen minutes without a foul.
He wasn't dainty about the whole
thing. Diving after the ball, at
tempting interceptions, knocking
the ball loose from the large
Michigan players, and trying to
block every shot within reach, he
really put his ability to the test.
Finally with six minutes remain
ing, he obviously slapped Cazzie
Russell of Michigan and so fouled
out. The crowd gave him a short
standing ovation.
Princeton, with their leader and
inspiration gone, lost easily,
though they were only down by
six points at Bradley's departure.
He had only scored 29 points (his
season average). 19 had come in
the first half. Only ten came in
the 14 minutes of play in the .sec
ond stanza.
But Bradley's loss had also
meant that Princeton lost its fast
break, leading passer, leading re
bounder (Robinson Brown had

also fouled out.), and captain. It
was a dead team.
Both these nights, following the!
game in which Princeton partici-1
I pated, UCLA with Gail Goodrich,
destroyed its opponent. UCLA j
and Princeton never met. Bothj
I nights Goodrich with his driving
layups and long set shots led
| UCLA in scoring. Though an ex
cellent shooter, it is at that point
| which his excellency halts. He is
not on enthusiastic passer. He en
| joys shooting, and therefore takes
I most any opportunity. In the'
! game against Michigan, Good
j rich took five shots within the
! first three minutes. One bounced j
I around t lie rim and finally)
j dropped through. Three missed
backboard, rim, and netting en- 1
jtirely. He was forcing his shots, j
j refusing to pass off when defen- :
sively tied up. Seemingly he was I
trying to catch up to Bradley's 58
| points. Eventually, Goodrich be-,
! gan to hit and ended up with 42
points for the night. But Good
rich was not nearly the whole
show, though he is a "showboat."
Kenny Washington shot beauti-j
fully. Edgar Lacey was great on j
the boards among the Wolverine
"monsters."
Bradley walked away with the;
voting for "Most Valuable Play
er" for the championships. But:
some, including UCLA coach j
John Wooden (of course), thought j
J that Goodrich deserved the honor. |
Just because Goodrich has excel- j
i lent teammates surrounding him j
!to throw the ball to him, play J
j defense, get rebounds, and help!
1 scoring should not make him;
great. Goodrich just plainly shoots I
a lot. His field goal percentage is !
not unbelievable. And Goodrich is j
loud and extremely "cocky."
Bradley though is silent, com-j
posed, and subtle. In very plain
simple words, he has "class." He i
led a mediocre group of players to
the overwhelming upset of Provi-!
denee by 40 points. That was an ,
I upset! He led them all the way to
I the Eastern Championship against
Michigan. He kept them in the
I game until he fouled out.
He destroyed Wichita State all i
by his lonesome. He did most of
I Princeton's rebounding, passing,
Sand setting up of plays including
j their fast break), besides his con
j sistent scoring. He also did not
â–  force his shots. And he makes
most of his incredible shots. In
| the playoffs his shooting percent
ages were astronomical. He only
; missed one foul shot in the two
| games.
| Possibly it will console John
Wooden considerably (it should)
; that Goodrich was lucky enough
to share "Co-player of the year" ;

was a grotesque error in judge
ment. Goodrich simply does not

by the New York Knicks as their ,
territorial choice, if he decides toj

longer, and may eventually lead

j in just two games of basketball,
I any player that is except Bill

ordinary college basketball player.

j Princeton faced Wichita State.
I The Shockers defense was so put

j proached the N'CAA record lor
game points. Bradley was also
nearing the record for individual
points in several categories.
As usual Princeton looked 1o
Mr. Bradley for the additional
points. As usual, he responded.
I He pul Princeton over the team
! mark with a 25-foot hook shot
from the corner which merely

whipped through the nets. The
generally non-partisan crowd ex
ploded in amazement. With two
minutes remaining Bradley was
taken out.
He only got a minute long
standing ovation because the offi
cials resumed the game. Bill col
lected 58 points, breaking Oscar
Robinson's eight-year-old mark.
Besides scoring one point short
of half of Princeton's 118 points
he also led them in rebounds, as
sists, field goals, free throws,
shooting percentage and numer
ous other classifications in which
statistics are not kept.
The night before, Bradley had
been in foul trouble almost from
the beginning. Just before the end
of the half he collected his third
foul on a very disputable charg
ing call. One minute into the sec
ond half he was caught for his
fourth. Princeton was only down
by four points at the time.
The Tigers switched to a zone
defense to take some of the pres
sure off Bradley. He had to last
nineteen minutes without a foul.
He wasn't dainty about the whole
thing. Diving after the ball, at
tempting interceptions, knocking
the ball loose from the large
Michigan players, and trying to
block every shot within reach, he
really put his ability to the test.
Finally with six minutes remain
ing, he obviously slapped Cazzie
Russell of Michigan and so fouled
out. The crowd gave him a short
standing ovation.
Princeton, with their leader and
inspiration gone, lost easily,
though they were only down by
six points at Bradley's departure.
He had only scored 29 points (his
season average). 19 had come in
the first half. Only ten came in
the 14 minutes of play in the .sec
ond stanza.
But Bradley's loss had also
meant that Princeton lost its fast
break, leading passer, leading re
bounder (Robinson Brown had

also fouled out.), and captain. It
was a dead team.
Both these nights, following the!
game in which Princeton partici-1
I pated, UCLA with Gail Goodrich,
destroyed its opponent. UCLA j
and Princeton never met. Bothj
I nights Goodrich with his driving
layups and long set shots led
| UCLA in scoring. Though an ex
cellent shooter, it is at that point
| which his excellency halts. He is
not on enthusiastic passer. He en
| joys shooting, and therefore takes
I most any opportunity. In the'
! game against Michigan, Good
j rich took five shots within the
! first three minutes. One bounced j
I around t lie rim and finally)
j dropped through. Three missed
backboard, rim, and netting en- 1
jtirely. He was forcing his shots, j
j refusing to pass off when defen- :
sively tied up. Seemingly he was I
trying to catch up to Bradley's 58
| points. Eventually, Goodrich be-,
! gan to hit and ended up with 42
points for the night. But Good
rich was not nearly the whole
show, though he is a "showboat."
Kenny Washington shot beauti-j
fully. Edgar Lacey was great on j
the boards among the Wolverine
"monsters."
Bradley walked away with the;
voting for "Most Valuable Play
er" for the championships. But:
some, including UCLA coach j
John Wooden (of course), thought j
J that Goodrich deserved the honor. |
Just because Goodrich has excel- j
i lent teammates surrounding him j

j defense, get rebounds, and help!
1 scoring should not make him;

a lot. His field goal percentage is !
not unbelievable. And Goodrich is j

led a mediocre group of players to
the overwhelming upset of Provi-!
denee by 40 points. That was an ,
I upset! He led them all the way to
I the Eastern Championship against
Michigan. He kept them in the
I game until he fouled out.
He destroyed Wichita State all i

I Princeton's rebounding, passing,

j in just two games of basketball,

j Princeton faced Wichita State.
I The Shockers defense was so put

j proached the N'CAA record lor
game points. Bradley was also
nearing the record for individual
points in several categories.
As usual Princeton looked 1o
Mr. Bradley for the additional
points. As usual, he responded.
I He pul Princeton over the team
! mark with a 25-foot hook shot
from the corner which merely

whipped through the nets. The
generally non-partisan crowd ex
ploded in amazement. With two
minutes remaining Bradley was
taken out.
He only got a minute long
standing ovation because the offi
cials resumed the game. Bill col
lected 58 points, breaking Oscar
Robinson's eight-year-old mark.
Besides scoring one point short
of half of Princeton's 118 points
he also led them in rebounds, as
sists, field goals, free throws,
shooting percentage and numer
ous other classifications in which
statistics are not kept.
The night before, Bradley had
been in foul trouble almost from
the beginning. Just before the end
of the half he collected his third
foul on a very disputable charg
ing call. One minute into the sec
ond half he was caught for his
fourth. Princeton was only down
by four points at the time.
The Tigers switched to a zone
defense to take some of the pres
sure off Bradley. He had to last
nineteen minutes without a foul.
He wasn't dainty about the whole
thing. Diving after the ball, at
tempting interceptions, knocking
the ball loose from the large
Michigan players, and trying to
block every shot within reach, he
really put his ability to the test.
Finally with six minutes remain
ing, he obviously slapped Cazzie
Russell of Michigan and so fouled
out. The crowd gave him a short
standing ovation.
Princeton, with their leader and
inspiration gone, lost easily,
though they were only down by
six points at Bradley's departure.
He had only scored 29 points (his
season average). 19 had come in
the first half. Only ten came in
the 14 minutes of play in the .sec
ond stanza.
But Bradley's loss had also
meant that Princeton lost its fast
break, leading passer, leading re
bounder (Robinson Brown had

also fouled out.), and captain. It
was a dead team.
Both these nights, following the!
game in which Princeton partici-1
I pated, UCLA with Gail Goodrich,
destroyed its opponent. UCLA j
and Princeton never met. Bothj
I nights Goodrich with his driving
layups and long set shots led
| UCLA in scoring. Though an ex
cellent shooter, it is at that point
| which his excellency halts. He is
not on enthusiastic passer. He en
| joys shooting, and therefore takes
I most any opportunity. In the'
! game against Michigan, Good
j rich took five shots within the
! first three minutes. One bounced j
I around t lie rim and finally)
j dropped through. Three missed
backboard, rim, and netting en- 1
jtirely. He was forcing his shots, j
j refusing to pass off when defen- :
sively tied up. Seemingly he was I
trying to catch up to Bradley's 58
| points. Eventually, Goodrich be-,
! gan to hit and ended up with 42
points for the night. But Good
rich was not nearly the whole
show, though he is a "showboat."
Kenny Washington shot beauti-j
fully. Edgar Lacey was great on j
the boards among the Wolverine
"monsters."
Bradley walked away with the;
voting for "Most Valuable Play
er" for the championships. But:
some, including UCLA coach j
John Wooden (of course), thought j
J that Goodrich deserved the honor. |
Just because Goodrich has excel- j
i lent teammates surrounding him j

led a mediocre group of players to
the overwhelming upset of Provi-!

I upset! He led them all the way to
I the Eastern Championship against
Michigan. He kept them in the
I game until he fouled out.
