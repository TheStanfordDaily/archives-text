# A 						Step In The Right Direction

### 
In a speech at the Inter-Fraternity Council
Banquet early last month, President Sterling
challenged Stanford fraternities to meet their
responsibilities. "Any element of any institution
must justify its existence, he told the gathered
house officers. "If it cannot, it should not exist."
Yesterday, a group of eight present and past
fraternity members issued a booklet, entitled "A
Second Look, to the freshmen men, who are
presently going through rush.
The booklet was written by students who
have been within the fraternity system, who un
derstand the problems of Stanford fraternities,
and who are shaping their own views for an effec
tive living group.
These men, too, offer a challenge to fraterni
ties, and their criticisms are certainly well
founded. Most houses are far from realizing
their full potential in providing a balanced aca
demic, social, and cultural environment.
We suspect a majority of the houses did not
truly heed Sterling s challenge offered at the ban

quel. Few, if any, had any sort of discussions
afterward. If there have been any major changes
in house attitudes and programs, we haven't
heard of them. Hopefully, the challenge offered
in the booklet distributed yesterday will strike
closer to home. And hopefully, the freshmen,
presently reviewing various possible living ar
rangements. will carry the challenge as they at
tend this week's open houses and rush functions.
The freshmen, it is hoped, will read carefully
the opinions of "A Second Look." But they should
not stop there. They should maintain a question
ing, if not critical attitude throughout rush;
they must look beyond house CPA's and social
activities if they are to find the "right" living
group.
In short, they should look beyond the me
chanics of the living groups, and delve into group
attitudes. " -
With such an outlook in mind, perhaps the
fraternities'claim that the man chooses the house,
and not the house the man, will come true.
