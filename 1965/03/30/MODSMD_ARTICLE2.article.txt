### 
Two petitions critical of Ad
ministration policy in Schna and
Vietnam were sent to President
Johnson l>y Stanford groups dur
ing Dead Week.
One hundred and forty-four
members and research associates
signed a petition which appeared
in The Daily March 5 in a letter
from math professor Karel Le-
Leeuw. It denounced the "escala
tion of war in Southeast Asia"
and called for "immediate and in
tensive negotiation to end our
military involvement in Vietnam."
Having been branded overag
gressive in Vietnam, the Johnson
administration was criticized for
reticence in Alabama in a petition
drafted by Randy Ireson, chair
man of the newly formed "Stan
ford Friends of SNCC."
The petition calls on Johnson
and Attorney General Nicholas
Gatzenbach "to use the executive
and judicial powers . . . to secure
the enforcement of already exist
ing laws that apply to Civil
Rights."
With 527 signatures, including
those of Professors Pease. Brown
and Dornbusch, the petition was
mailed to Washington on March
lii and subsequently acknowl
edged.
