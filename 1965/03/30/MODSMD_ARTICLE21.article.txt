## Who Needs A Dean? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I recently observed in my city's
newspaper a "scandal column" in
volving the Dean of Women at my
old Alma Mater. Since I had nol
been to the farm for a while it
was mainly interesting for me to
muse that this was the first occa
sion on which I had ever in my
eight years on campus become
aware of the name of the then
current Dean of Women ... the
point being that we do not need
one.
Ii has been my impression that
the Dean of Women is supposed
to run herd on the various social
activities and non-academic prob
; lems of women students. I am
vaguely aware that there are
i usually a million committee meet
! ings and various bureaucracies
| organized to see that this function
is carried out. Now, having been
! a woman student at Stanford for
approximately 30 per cent of my
life, I surely can recall having en
gaged in many social activities
iand having personal problems of
l various kinds and degrees of seri
ousness. It would NEVER, EVER,
| have occurred to me even in the
[ farthest reaches of the ninth
circle of my psyche that the
Dean of Women would, could, or
should be in any way relevant to
those activities or those problems.
I heartily recommend that
those few of the functions of the
Dean of Men and of the Dean of
Women which involve discipline,
financial aid, or housing, be re
distributed to the appropriate |
University offices set up to deal
with them AND that the salaries
of the Deans of Men, of Women, i
and of Students be removed to!
the budget of the Counseling and 1
Testing Service, which agency j
has express concern with the voca-1

tional, study, and personal prob
lems of students . . . men students,
women students . . . people stu
dents.
Before rushing off to enact my
suggestion, of course, the Univer
sity should await the contrary re
j actions of other alumni or alum-1
! nae. The silence will be deafening.
Sincerely,
ELEANOR WILLEMSEN, !
