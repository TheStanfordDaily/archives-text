# Gallery to Display Works Of Oriental Traditionalist
## 
### 
The paintings of Anna \Yu Weakland will be displayed at
Stanford University Art Gallery March 16 through April 4.
While credited with infusing new, and individualized, life into
the Oriental traditional mode of painting, Mrs. Weakland's methods
are old and subtle.
After attending Columbia, studying painting under Prof. Ya-

Chun Wang, and teaching Chinese'
painting at the China Institute in
New York, she came to Califor
nia and continued her work in the
Stanford Art Department from
1953*55.
Since then she has had several
one-man exhibitions on the West
Coast, in Hong Kong, England,
and Canada.

Survival of Tradition
Dr. Lorenz Eitner, head of the
Stanford Art and Architecture De
partment, says of her work, "The
painting of Anna Wu Weakland
appears to me to represent a sur
vival of tradition, not revival.
They are Chinese painting, their
debt to modern Western art seems
to me small.
"There is, on the other hand, a
great deal of the conventional in
j them, in their themes, treatment
and technique. This would damn
them as Western art in the eyes
of those to whom convention is
anathema.
"But to Mrs. Weakland, who is
not a Western artist, these con
ventions are the raw matter from
which she draws beauty and
j meaning, just as other artists use
| visual experience as material for
art.
"By drawing on tradition she
restricts her freedom to 'create,'
to use this inflationary word, but
she gains in return the serenity
ancKfassuranee which give to her
j work its particular appeal.
Traditionlcss Century
I "Nearly all the most vital art of
the past 150 years has been anti
traditional. Our society has put
artists under the obligation to be
original, to be 'creative'; it ex
pects each of them to invent his
I own artistic language.
"The loss is irreparable. Tradi
tion cannot be revived once it is
dead, .just as religion cannot be
revived, and for* the same reasons.
There have been attempts, in our
traditionlcss century, to restore
the folkways and beliefs of the
national past, and with them old
traditions of art.
"These attempts in the West
have always bogged down in man
neristic anachronism, in 'kitsch'
or worse. No wonder that we look
with a kind of envv on those cul

t- ;
, tures, remote from our own, in
i which modernity seems to have
preserved a link with the past,
permitting the serious artist to
express himself in a traditional
or even popular idiom."

national past, and with them old
traditions of art.
"These attempts in the West
have always bogged down in man
neristic anachronism, in 'kitsch'
or worse. No wonder that we look
with a kind of envv on those cul

t- ;
, tures, remote from our own, in
i which modernity seems to have

permitting the serious artist to
express himself in a traditional

The paintings of Anna \Yu Weakland will be displayed at
Stanford University Art Gallery March 16 through April 4.
While credited with infusing new, and individualized, life into
the Oriental traditional mode of painting, Mrs. Weakland's methods
are old and subtle.
After attending Columbia, studying painting under Prof. Ya-

Chun Wang, and teaching Chinese'
painting at the China Institute in
New York, she came to Califor
nia and continued her work in the
Stanford Art Department from
1953*55.
Since then she has had several
one-man exhibitions on the West
Coast, in Hong Kong, England,
and Canada.

Survival of Tradition
Dr. Lorenz Eitner, head of the
Stanford Art and Architecture De
partment, says of her work, "The
painting of Anna Wu Weakland
appears to me to represent a sur
vival of tradition, not revival.
They are Chinese painting, their
debt to modern Western art seems
to me small.
"There is, on the other hand, a
great deal of the conventional in
j them, in their themes, treatment
and technique. This would damn
them as Western art in the eyes
of those to whom convention is
anathema.
"But to Mrs. Weakland, who is
not a Western artist, these con
ventions are the raw matter from
which she draws beauty and
j meaning, just as other artists use
| visual experience as material for
art.
"By drawing on tradition she
restricts her freedom to 'create,'
to use this inflationary word, but
she gains in return the serenity
ancKfassuranee which give to her
j work its particular appeal.
Traditionlcss Century
I "Nearly all the most vital art of
the past 150 years has been anti
traditional. Our society has put
artists under the obligation to be
original, to be 'creative'; it ex
pects each of them to invent his
I own artistic language.
"The loss is irreparable. Tradi
tion cannot be revived once it is
dead, .just as religion cannot be
revived, and for* the same reasons.
There have been attempts, in our
traditionlcss century, to restore
the folkways and beliefs of the
national past, and with them old
traditions of art.
"These attempts in the West
have always bogged down in man
neristic anachronism, in 'kitsch'
or worse. No wonder that we look
with a kind of envv on those cul

t- ;
, tures, remote from our own, in
i which modernity seems to have
