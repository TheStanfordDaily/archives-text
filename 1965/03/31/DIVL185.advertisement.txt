Go Directly to God
Collegians seeking the truth often ask Christians to explain the
existence of the clergy and the hierarchy of "the church", for it seems
to some that layers and layers of Higher Management must serve as
go-betweens to God.
Consistent and satisfying answers to such questions are always found
in the Holy Scriptures, for God has not intended that man-made barriers
and traditions should keep any individual from discovering the reality of a
close and personal relationship with Jesus Christ. The Bible dismisses the
necessity of human or saintly intermediaries between God and man with
the simple statement. "There is one God and one mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave Himself a ransom for all" (I
Timothy 2:5, 6).
Within His church God appoints and designates special men, such j
as apostles, and pastors and teachers, to perform certain tasks in order
that the church might be built up spirtually (see Ephcsians 4:11-13").
But the most remarkable and challenging designation and appointments
of God are His priests, royal servants of His household who offer prayers
and worship and consecrated service to the Master who bought them at
the price of His own blood. The clear teaching of the Bible is that each
and every Christian, every child of God by faith in Jesus Christ, is such
a royal priest: "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy
nation, God's own people, that you may declare the wonderful deeds of I
Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous life. Once you
were no people, but now you are God's people; once you had not re
ceived mercy, but now you have received mercy" (1 Peter 2:9, 10).
God, who is no respecter of persons, offers to all men the privilege
and high calling of becoming His sons. But a person is of no value to
God unless his life is consecrated and available (Romans 12:1, 2) for
use, a cleansed vessel fit for the service of the King. This is why Christians
are called to holy living and to full surrender to the Lord Jesus.
If you are not a Christian today, won't you consider joining God's
family, the household of faith which serves the Lord Jesus Christ with
willing hearts and hands? And if you are a Christian but not living the
life of one, won't you consider the high price paid for your redemption?
"Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit within
you, which you have from God? You are not your own, you were bought
with a price. So glorify God in your body" (I Corinthinians 6:19-20).
