### 
Five of the authors of the hook
let, "A Second Look." answered
questions from freshmen last
night in the Trancos lounge.
Dave Calfee prefaced the meet
ing by saying that "every living
situation at Stanford needs some
review," and that the booklet was
published to "challenge fraterni
ties to evaluate themselves." He
also said that "fraternities are
not a block, and must be judged
individually." The feeling that a
fraternity is more than a living
group was expressed by all. Cal
fee said fraternities have "no
boundaries."
Sorenson proposed a "draw"
system for men's residences. He
said such a system at Harvard
enables two-thirds of the men to
live in their first choice residence.
Doug Sorenson mentioned the
paradox of rush: a short rush
enables more study time and costs
less money, but a longer rush
would provide better communica
tion.
The academic atmosphere of
fraternities is limited, according
to Steve Hodge. In one fraternity
members would rather watch a
situation comedy on television
than the news.
Dave Calfee suggested houses
can lx> analyzed better after bids
are received, and advised, "Don't
get swept off your feet."
