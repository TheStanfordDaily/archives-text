# RECORD NOW 14-3
## Sunken Diamond Massacre: Indians 21, St. Mary's 2 
### PETE KING 
It was batting average-fattening
time yesterday at Sunken Dia
mond, as Stanford's sluggers
pounded three St. Mary's pitchers
for 18 hits, crushing the Gallop
ing Gaels, 21-2.

The game was called after eight
innings. The reason given was
darkness, but it could well have
I been mercy, as the Indians pulled
i off one of the worst baseball mas- i
saeres within recent memory.
Ai the end of three innings, thej
! score was an innocuous 4-1. But I
then Stanford pitcher Mike Con- j
nelly drew a walk, there were
four singles by Ron Yett, Bob I
Cox, Jim Hibbs, and Pete Middle-,
kauff, two wild pitches, and Steve [
Hovley and Dick Swan walked, i
George Thacher's sacrifice fly'
ended the six-run inning.
Might-run Inning
The Tribe scored eighl more in j
the sixth inning, the big blow be-j
ing John Propstra's three-run j
triple, which right fielder Ken,
Rivaro made a futile dive for. j
Cliff Harris drove in the final In- j
dian runs with a two-run double.
Yett and Middlekauff each col- j
lected a double and two singles
apiece to lead the hitters.
Last week in seven games Stan
ford hit 13 home runs, but even
St. Mary J pitchers couldn't throw
gopher balls in Sunken Diamond, j
which measures 365 feet to left,
355 to right, and about 540 to
center. Two towering drives by

Hibbs, which would have been
homers in other ball parks, wore
merely spectacular outs.
Three St. Mary's hitters pro
vided comic relief, as they each
donned uniform number 21, ihe
Gaels being a bit short of uni
forms.
St. Mary's scored on a single
and two wild pitches by Connelly !
in the first inning. Relief pitcher j
John Mason yielded an unearned '
run in the eighth.
Stanford's record is now 14-3. !
The team's next action is a double-!
header with the Air Force Aca-1
demy here Saturday at noon.

innings. The reason given was
darkness, but it could well have
I been mercy, as the Indians pulled
i off one of the worst baseball mas- i
saeres within recent memory.
Ai the end of three innings, thej
! score was an innocuous 4-1. But I
then Stanford pitcher Mike Con- j
nelly drew a walk, there were
four singles by Ron Yett, Bob I
Cox, Jim Hibbs, and Pete Middle-,
kauff, two wild pitches, and Steve [
Hovley and Dick Swan walked, i
George Thacher's sacrifice fly'
ended the six-run inning.
Might-run Inning
The Tribe scored eighl more in j
the sixth inning, the big blow be-j
ing John Propstra's three-run j
triple, which right fielder Ken,
Rivaro made a futile dive for. j
Cliff Harris drove in the final In- j
dian runs with a two-run double.
Yett and Middlekauff each col- j
lected a double and two singles
apiece to lead the hitters.
Last week in seven games Stan
ford hit 13 home runs, but even
St. Mary J pitchers couldn't throw
gopher balls in Sunken Diamond, j
which measures 365 feet to left,
355 to right, and about 540 to
center. Two towering drives by

Hibbs, which would have been
homers in other ball parks, wore
merely spectacular outs.
Three St. Mary's hitters pro
vided comic relief, as they each
donned uniform number 21, ihe
Gaels being a bit short of uni
forms.
St. Mary's scored on a single
and two wild pitches by Connelly !
in the first inning. Relief pitcher j
John Mason yielded an unearned '
run in the eighth.
Stanford's record is now 14-3. !
The team's next action is a double-!
header with the Air Force Aca-1
demy here Saturday at noon.
