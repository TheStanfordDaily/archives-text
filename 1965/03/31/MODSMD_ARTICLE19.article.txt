# Letters To The Editor A Witch A Week
## 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Let me congratulate you on
your magnificent ridicule of Presi
dent Sterling's speech to the Los
Angeles Alumni. You so superbly
use the tactics of quoting out of
context, misrepresentation of
facts, conclusion jumping and
making something out of nothing,
that I am afraid that you will give
the Chronicle writers of feature
stories on Stanford's sex life an
inferiority complex. Never have I
seen anyone go so far out of their
way in an effort to criticize some
one else. You should change the
name of your paper to The Salem
Daily and your motto could be '"A
Witch a Week."
The original speech was merely
trying to delineate a number of
the problems Stanford as an edu
cational institution in 1965 faces.
The greatest proportion of it was
dedicated to the shortage of
teachers. At no point in his dis
cussion of these problems did he
express any opinions which could
be construed to represent policy
statements regarding how th e
GCC would be dealt with. 1 am
frankly quite amused that the
sophisticated Stanford Daily has
promptly burst into tears merely
because the President of the uni
versity wounded its pride by quot
ing Aristotle regarding the im
petuosity of youth. Your "editor
ial" certainly supports the phil
osopher's opinion.

• Discontent in Spain
Editor, The Daily:
As I follow in The Daily, the
activities of the FSM movement
at Cal, and the Stanford students,
in turn looking at their own sit
uation, I decided that there might
be some interest on the Farm in
the plight of the Spanish students
who cannot even air their griev
ances.
After a series of student demon
strations stemming from: discon
tent with the lack of channels of
communication between the stu
dents and the university adminis
trators; dissatisfaction with Gen
eral Franco's appointment of Ihe
heads of student organizations in
stead of their election by students;
desire to have the British remove
themselves from Gibraltar; and
demand for payments on govern
ment scholarships (freely given,
but funds ultimately not sup
plied), the School of Philosophy
and Letters of the University of

Madrid h a s been temporarily
closed.
The building was locked yester
day (Thurs., Feb. 25) following
instructions in a government or
der. The reason given was repeti
tion of events ''outside" educa
tional activities (i.e., demonstra
tions).
A final note — Spanish laws, ,
which strictly prohibit striking ;
and demonstrations of any nature, j
have one consolation lor students.
That is, students may demonstrate
inside the schools at the Univer
sity of Madrid without interfer
ence until the head of the depart
ment decides that the activity has
gotten out of hand, and then he
will silently order the patiently
waiting police forces to come j
forth from their vigils outside the i
building. Once again, nothing has :
been solved or gained. Only days j
of would be classes lost, and the \
prolongation of the school year.

• Over The Edge?
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Stanford is very close
to greatness, I can think of one
small recommendation that would
probably push us over the edge.
It would certainly be helpful if
students were able to buy required
textbooks from the Stanford book
store. It seems to be an ever-in
creasing phenomenon, that many
required texts are sold out after
the first two days of the quarter.
Students can then make a pene
trating search throughout the Bay
Area to find a copy, or else wait
for one, two, three, or often four
weeks for the bookstore to receive
a shipment.
The bookstore is very helpful
in posting a list of newly received
texts, but its size only emphasizes
the number of books that are not
available. When questioned as to
why there are never enough
books, bookstore personnel state
that they order texls according to
the predicted enrollment as given
by the professor. The professor
bases his prediction on. pre-reg
statistics and on past experience.
Somewhere along the line, small
errors are being made.
Frustration is multiplied when
after that long awaited shipment
arrives, even then too often the
texts disappear before everyone
gets his copy. It is only partially
reassuring to be told that a third
shipment is on its way and will be
here two weeks from next month.

If only a fraction of the $150 a
year which a student according to
the university's model budget is
expected to spend on books and
supplies is spent in the bookstore,
ten thousand students spending at
least one half of a million dollars
per year should be able to provide
an income sufficient for an ade
i quate stock of textbooks. In gen
i eral, the services of the bookstore
are excellent; but transistor ra
dios and Mother's Day greeting
cards are not enough.

• Fatherly Faculties
Editor, The Daily:
The recent wave of student
| agitation at Berkeley seems to lie
| calming for a while; A. H. Ras
i kin's thoughtful account in the
■ Sunday Chronicle has led me to
j this observation:
Despite the insistence in some
I quarters that higher education is
a right rather than a privilege. I
still feel that the fine physical fa
cilities of our universities, the
character of men like Clark Kerr,
and the fatherly attitudes which
are almost always somewhat
present in faculty, all represent
to some extent parental qualities
of the society at large. Certainly,
life in general (social or natural)
is not so benevolent or indulgent
in its dealings with the individual
left to his own resources. Those
of us of an earlier generation who
were engaged in a struggle
against depression and Fascism
perhaps know that better, but I
suspect few of any generation
would quarrel with that state
ment.
In return for his helpful atti
tude, the individual father expects
something called "respect"
(Goethe saw this as the sine qua
non of education). Which does not
mean, of course, blind obedience,
nor does it preclude the liveliest
criticism nor, later, a healthy
"total" revolt and a finding of the
new man's identity. But, at a cer
tain point during the apprentice
ship, the bond of special arrange
ments can be violated by an ex
cessive or premature defiance. It
is hard to say just when this hap
pens, each case being individual.
But, on the whole, one comes
away from the recent Berkeley
events with the feeling that there
are some young people around
who are in danger of forfeiting
Iheir place in the academic heart.

j this observation:
Despite the insistence in some
I quarters that higher education is
a right rather than a privilege. I
still feel that the fine physical fa
cilities of our universities, the
character of men like Clark Kerr,
and the fatherly attitudes which
are almost always somewhat
present in faculty, all represent
to some extent parental qualities
of the society at large. Certainly,
life in general (social or natural)
is not so benevolent or indulgent
in its dealings with the individual
left to his own resources. Those
of us of an earlier generation who
were engaged in a struggle
against depression and Fascism
perhaps know that better, but I
suspect few of any generation
would quarrel with that state

In return for his helpful atti

something called "respect"
(Goethe saw this as the sine qua
non of education). Which does not
mean, of course, blind obedience,
nor does it preclude the liveliest
criticism nor, later, a healthy
"total" revolt and a finding of the
new man's identity. But, at a cer
tain point during the apprentice

is hard to say just when this hap

Let me congratulate you on
your magnificent ridicule of Presi
dent Sterling's speech to the Los
Angeles Alumni. You so superbly
use the tactics of quoting out of
context, misrepresentation of
facts, conclusion jumping and
making something out of nothing,
that I am afraid that you will give
the Chronicle writers of feature
stories on Stanford's sex life an
inferiority complex. Never have I
seen anyone go so far out of their
way in an effort to criticize some
one else. You should change the
name of your paper to The Salem
Daily and your motto could be '"A
Witch a Week."
The original speech was merely
trying to delineate a number of
the problems Stanford as an edu
cational institution in 1965 faces.
The greatest proportion of it was
dedicated to the shortage of
teachers. At no point in his dis
cussion of these problems did he
express any opinions which could
be construed to represent policy
statements regarding how th e
GCC would be dealt with. 1 am
frankly quite amused that the
sophisticated Stanford Daily has
promptly burst into tears merely
because the President of the uni
versity wounded its pride by quot
ing Aristotle regarding the im
petuosity of youth. Your "editor

be some interest on the Farm in
the plight of the Spanish students
who cannot even air their griev

After a series of student demon
strations stemming from: discon
tent with the lack of channels of
communication between the stu
dents and the university adminis
trators; dissatisfaction with Gen
eral Franco's appointment of Ihe
heads of student organizations in
stead of their election by students;
desire to have the British remove
themselves from Gibraltar; and
demand for payments on govern

but funds ultimately not sup
plied), the School of Philosophy

Madrid h a s been temporarily
closed.
The building was locked yester
day (Thurs., Feb. 25) following

tion of events ''outside" educa

A final note — Spanish laws, ,
which strictly prohibit striking ;
and demonstrations of any nature, j
have one consolation lor students.
That is, students may demonstrate
inside the schools at the Univer

• Over The Edge?
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Stanford is very close
to greatness, I can think of one
small recommendation that would
probably push us over the edge.
It would certainly be helpful if
students were able to buy required
textbooks from the Stanford book
store. It seems to be an ever-in
creasing phenomenon, that many
required texts are sold out after
the first two days of the quarter.
Students can then make a pene
trating search throughout the Bay
Area to find a copy, or else wait
for one, two, three, or often four
weeks for the bookstore to receive
a shipment.
The bookstore is very helpful
in posting a list of newly received
texts, but its size only emphasizes
the number of books that are not
available. When questioned as to
why there are never enough
books, bookstore personnel state
that they order texls according to
the predicted enrollment as given
by the professor. The professor
bases his prediction on. pre-reg
statistics and on past experience.
Somewhere along the line, small
errors are being made.
Frustration is multiplied when
after that long awaited shipment
arrives, even then too often the
texts disappear before everyone
gets his copy. It is only partially
reassuring to be told that a third
shipment is on its way and will be
here two weeks from next month.

If only a fraction of the $150 a
year which a student according to
the university's model budget is
expected to spend on books and
supplies is spent in the bookstore,
ten thousand students spending at
least one half of a million dollars
per year should be able to provide
an income sufficient for an ade
i quate stock of textbooks. In gen
i eral, the services of the bookstore
are excellent; but transistor ra
dios and Mother's Day greeting
cards are not enough.

weeks for the bookstore to receive
a shipment.
The bookstore is very helpful
in posting a list of newly received
texts, but its size only emphasizes
the number of books that are not

why there are never enough
books, bookstore personnel state
that they order texls according to
the predicted enrollment as given
by the professor. The professor
bases his prediction on. pre-reg

Somewhere along the line, small

Frustration is multiplied when
after that long awaited shipment
arrives, even then too often the

shipment is on its way and will be
here two weeks from next month.

If only a fraction of the $150 a
year which a student according to
the university's model budget is
expected to spend on books and
supplies is spent in the bookstore,
ten thousand students spending at
least one half of a million dollars
per year should be able to provide
an income sufficient for an ade

Let me congratulate you on
your magnificent ridicule of Presi

use the tactics of quoting out of
context, misrepresentation of
facts, conclusion jumping and
making something out of nothing,
that I am afraid that you will give
the Chronicle writers of feature
stories on Stanford's sex life an
inferiority complex. Never have I
seen anyone go so far out of their
way in an effort to criticize some
one else. You should change the
name of your paper to The Salem
Daily and your motto could be '"A
Witch a Week."
The original speech was merely
trying to delineate a number of
the problems Stanford as an edu
cational institution in 1965 faces.
The greatest proportion of it was
dedicated to the shortage of
teachers. At no point in his dis
cussion of these problems did he
express any opinions which could
be construed to represent policy
statements regarding how th e
GCC would be dealt with. 1 am
frankly quite amused that the
sophisticated Stanford Daily has
promptly burst into tears merely
because the President of the uni
versity wounded its pride by quot

petuosity of youth. Your "editor

Now that Stanford is very close

small recommendation that would
probably push us over the edge.
It would certainly be helpful if
students were able to buy required

required texts are sold out after
the first two days of the quarter.
Students can then make a pene

plied), the School of Philosophy
and Letters of the University of

Madrid h a s been temporarily
closed.
The building was locked yester
day (Thurs., Feb. 25) following
instructions in a government or
der. The reason given was repeti
tion of events ''outside" educa
tional activities (i.e., demonstra
tions).
A final note — Spanish laws, ,
which strictly prohibit striking ;
and demonstrations of any nature, j
have one consolation lor students.
That is, students may demonstrate
inside the schools at the Univer
sity of Madrid without interfer
ence until the head of the depart
ment decides that the activity has
gotten out of hand, and then he
will silently order the patiently
waiting police forces to come j
forth from their vigils outside the i
building. Once again, nothing has :
been solved or gained. Only days j
of would be classes lost, and the \
prolongation of the school year.

• Over The Edge?
Editor, The Daily:
Now that Stanford is very close
to greatness, I can think of one
small recommendation that would
probably push us over the edge.
It would certainly be helpful if
students were able to buy required
textbooks from the Stanford book
store. It seems to be an ever-in
creasing phenomenon, that many
required texts are sold out after
the first two days of the quarter.
Students can then make a pene
trating search throughout the Bay
Area to find a copy, or else wait
for one, two, three, or often four
weeks for the bookstore to receive
a shipment.
The bookstore is very helpful
in posting a list of newly received
texts, but its size only emphasizes
the number of books that are not
available. When questioned as to
why there are never enough
books, bookstore personnel state
that they order texls according to
the predicted enrollment as given
by the professor. The professor
bases his prediction on. pre-reg
statistics and on past experience.
Somewhere along the line, small
errors are being made.
Frustration is multiplied when
after that long awaited shipment
arrives, even then too often the
texts disappear before everyone
gets his copy. It is only partially
reassuring to be told that a third
shipment is on its way and will be
here two weeks from next month.

If only a fraction of the $150 a
year which a student according to
the university's model budget is
expected to spend on books and
supplies is spent in the bookstore,
ten thousand students spending at
least one half of a million dollars
per year should be able to provide
an income sufficient for an ade
i quate stock of textbooks. In gen
i eral, the services of the bookstore
are excellent; but transistor ra
dios and Mother's Day greeting
cards are not enough.

• Fatherly Faculties
Editor, The Daily:
The recent wave of student
| agitation at Berkeley seems to lie
| calming for a while; A. H. Ras
i kin's thoughtful account in the
■ Sunday Chronicle has led me to
j this observation:
Despite the insistence in some
I quarters that higher education is
a right rather than a privilege. I
still feel that the fine physical fa
cilities of our universities, the
character of men like Clark Kerr,
and the fatherly attitudes which
are almost always somewhat
present in faculty, all represent
to some extent parental qualities
of the society at large. Certainly,
life in general (social or natural)
is not so benevolent or indulgent
in its dealings with the individual
left to his own resources. Those
of us of an earlier generation who
were engaged in a struggle
against depression and Fascism
perhaps know that better, but I
suspect few of any generation
would quarrel with that state
ment.
In return for his helpful atti
tude, the individual father expects
something called "respect"
(Goethe saw this as the sine qua
non of education). Which does not
mean, of course, blind obedience,
nor does it preclude the liveliest
criticism nor, later, a healthy
"total" revolt and a finding of the
new man's identity. But, at a cer
tain point during the apprentice
ship, the bond of special arrange
ments can be violated by an ex
cessive or premature defiance. It
is hard to say just when this hap
pens, each case being individual.
But, on the whole, one comes
away from the recent Berkeley
events with the feeling that there
are some young people around
who are in danger of forfeiting
Iheir place in the academic heart.
