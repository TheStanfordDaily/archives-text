# Trustees Okay Decor Changes
## 
### 
Trustees of Stanford have au
thorized a $1 million renovation
program for residence halls, the
University announced today.
Scheduled to start this summer,
the renovation will be financed
by $750,000 from undesignated
funds received during the PACE
Program and $250,000 from resi
dence repair and replacement re
serves.
General plans for the renova
tion have been developed over the
past several months by a subcom
mittee of the Committee on Un
dergraduate Education, including
representatives from the faculty,
Business Office, Planning Office,
Dean of Students Office, and Un
dergraduate Education Office.
The director and three or four
student representatives in each
residence hall affected by the pro
gram will have an opportunity to I
present their views on the renova
tions for their area.
The genera 1 improvements j
recommended vary from hall to
hall. InToyon, Lagunita, Branner.
and Roble, all student rooms may
be redecorated and refurnished.
Three model rooms were redeco
rated in Roble last fall, as were
two in Branner, to give freshman
women a chance to evaluate alter
native designs.
In Stern Hall, corridor and
lobby areas may be redecorated,
as these areas were in Fremont
House on an experimental basis
two years ago. Similar changes
may be made in Wilbur.
William Friedrichs, former as
sistant dean of men, has been
named assistant to the director of
residences to help implement the
renovation program. Friedrichs,
33, received his A.B. in speech
and drama at Stanford in 1953
and his M.B.A. here in 1957.
The 1965-66 program is designed
to meet only the most urgent
renovation needs. Total require
ments in this field are estimated
at nearly $2 million.
