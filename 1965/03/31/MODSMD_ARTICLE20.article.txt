## The
						Negro, the Vote, And the 15th Amendment 
### Walter Lippmann 
The basic question before Congress in considering the pro
posed Voting Rights Act of 1965 is whether it wishes to have the
15th Amendment of the Constitution enforced. This amendment
forbids the denial or abridgement of the right of citizens of the
United States to vote "on account of race, color or previous condi-

tion of servitude."
It was ratified in 1870—now 95
years ago — and under Section 2
gives Congress "power to enforce
this article by appropriate legisla
tion." Congress passed the En
forcement Act on May 31, 1870.
This was followed the next year
(1871) by a law making it a fed
eral crime to prevent citizens
from voting by threat or intimida
tion and established a system of
federal supervisors of elections.
In the quarter of a century
which followed, certain of the
former Confederate States re
sisted succesfully the enforce
ment of the legislation, and by
1894 Congress itself repealed most
of the legislation enforcing the
15th Amendment. Various devices
were adopted by tin? resisting
states in order to deny the vote
1o the great mass of their Negroe
citizens. These devices, setting up
difficult tests of literacy, educa
tion and knowledge of the state
and federal constitutions, would
disfranchise a great many of the
whites.
Grandfather Clause
To make sure that the whites
could vote and the Negroes could
not, a number of states, beginning
in 1895, enacted the so-called
"Grandfather Clause." This al
lowed citizens descended from
anyone who had voted on Jan. 1.
18<>7 (when, of course, no former
slave could as yet vote) to be
registered as voters even if they
could not pass the literacy test.
The "Grandfather Clause"
which the Supreme Court struck
down in 1915 was followed by laws
excluding Negroes from the real
elections, which were the primar
ies. This, too, was struck down by
the court in a number of decisions
handed down in the 1940s during
and after the second world war.
Nevertheless, the resisting states
in the Deep South persisted and
continued by various subterfuges
and various kinds of intimidation
to keep the Negro voters down to
a small minority.
Higher Titan The Constitution
Anyone who wishes to argue for
the preservation of the existing
system of discrimination and
against federal intervention must
argue that as a matter of public
policy, which they deem to be
higher than the language of the
Constitution itself, the 15th
Amendment is wrong and should
be nullified. They must argue that
the present and for the indefinite
future it is not: safe that more
than a minority of the Negro citi
zens should be enfranchised.
It is not unlikely, it seems to
me, that a reputable and compas
sionate historian could say that
in 1870 voting by the mass of nt..v
freedmen of the South, then illite
rate and wholly inexperienced be
cause of their former condition of
slavery, might have precipitated
irreparable violence in the old
Confederacy. But such an inter

pretation of the South does not
apply to conditions as they are to
day — a century after the Civil
War.
Credit To Any Race
The Negroes, in spite of th e
cruel handicaps they suffer, have
produced a generation of leading
men — such as Martin Lut h e r
King, Ralph Bunche, Thurgood
Marshall and Roy Wilkins, who
I would be a credit to any race.
| And the great-grandchildren of
| the Southern rebels are no longer
; preoccupied with an effort to re
verse the outcome of the Civil
! War.
i In the light of history, in view
of the changed condition of t he
: modern South, considering how
intolerable it is to deny justice
j too long, the federal government
! can proceed with a good and firm
1 conscience, it is poetic justice of
! a high order that the federal gov
ernment should be led in this en
terprise by the first Southerner
j who is President of the United
• States since the Civil War. The
federal government must enforce
the 15th Amendment, and having
j put its hand to the plow it must
; not and cannot turn back.
