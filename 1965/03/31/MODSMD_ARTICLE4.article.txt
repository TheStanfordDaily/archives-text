# Dean Burch To Discuss GOP Future
## 
### 
Dean Burch, in his last day as
Republican national chairman, !
will visit Stanford this afternoon
and present a talk on what the
future position and platform of
the GOP should be.
The speech, sponsored by th e
Stanford Area Young Republi
cans, is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. in |
the combined lounges of Tresid
der.
Burch was elected Republican
national chairman last July at the
request of Barry Goldwater, who
had just been overwhelmingly
nominated for the Presidency.
Burch remained at the helm of
the Republican Party throughout
the campaign and came under
heavy criticism from liberal ele
ments of the GOP following the
Republican defeat in November.
To avoid the party split that
was predicted if he had been chal- i
longed at the January meeting of 1
the National Committee, Burch
submitted his resignation, effec
tive April 1.
Burch has been speaking to a
number of colleges and universi
ties in the past few weeks and j
has stated that ho believes the
Republican Party must remain
conservative in the future in or-:
der to regain the power it has j
been losing, particularly in regis- j
tration, since 1940.
Since the election, Burch hasj
also been critical of the traditional ,
method of Presidential campaign- j
ing. In an article in last week's '
Saturday Evening Post, he con
demned the strenuous schedules
that candidates are forced to keep i
as ineffective iri exposing the can
didate to the public, and particu
larly in developing a meaningful j
dialogue on the major issues.
He proposed that in the future, j
both candidates abstain from at- |
tempting to visit every state and '
every major city and concentrate ,
their efforts and party funds in |
a series of eight weekly one-hour i
television broadcasts to be carried >
by all three networks in which j
the candidates would address
themselves to similar issues.
