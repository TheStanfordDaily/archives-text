### TERRY COXON 
Howard Abrams, Winton Pro
fessor of English Literature at
Cornell University, will speak to
night at 8 in the rTesidder Large
Lounge on "The Tradition of the
Portrait of the Artist."
Abrams, a member of the
America Academy of Arts and

Sciences and twice a Guggenheim j
Fellow, is I he author of The |
Mirror and the Lamp, a work
dealing with the transition of
English literature from the neo- j
classical period ol Pope lo the
Romantic Movement. A mild-man
nered scholar who speaks with
the meditative lone of one who is;
constantly rethinking his opin-j
ions, Abrams is a model of "thel
absent-minded professor." When
asked for the sub-title of The
Mirror and the Lamp, it was only
by a process of moaning and fore
head-clasping that he was able to
recall it Romantic Theory and
the. Critical Tradition.
The tradition of the portrait of
an artist, Abrams explained in
an interview wilh the Daily, seeks
to describe the initiation of a
young man into the artist's occu-j
pation and to illuminate the pro !
cess by which he is readied fori
his role of observer and creator.
Abrams finds the earliest traces
of the tradition in the Old Testa
ment accounts of the preparation
of the prophets for their special
tasks of reflection and public ex
hortation. "The tradition took de
finite form." he said, "with Au
gustine's Confessions," and the
works of other "Christian spiri-i
tual autobiographers."
In the early nineteenth century,
however, the tradition became |
secularized vvilh the publication
of Wordsworth's "Prelude," and
has continued into more recent i

times with the writings ol' Proust
and Joyce, he explained.
In 1953 Abrams served as Ful
bright Lecturer at the Royal Uni
versity of Malta, where he was
elected an honorary permanent
member of the faculty. In 1963
he delivered the Roadie Lectures
at the University of Indiana.
