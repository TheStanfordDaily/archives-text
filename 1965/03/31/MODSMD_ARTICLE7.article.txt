# FIRST EDITION APPEARS
## 'Workshop:' Full of Vitality 
### HILDA KOSSOFF 
Vitality fills the first edition of the Workshop,
Stanford's newest magazine. Attacking the image
of self-satisfied obscurity associated with college
literary efforts, the Workshop aims to narrow "the
gross separation between Stanford's literary life
and its everyday world," according to editor Henry
Alley.
Unlike other publications which come out once
a quarter, the Workshop is to appear every two
weeks. This frequently, together with the low price
10 cents should bring the magazine closer to
the community.
Workshop manuscripts come both from the
Creative Writing department and from the general
student body. Collection hoses for contributions
have been set up in the Main Library, Trosidder
Union, and various living groups.
The six selections in volume one, number one
of the Workshop touch a wide range of subjects
from gentle fantasy to chillingly plausible ac
counts of life at Stanford in its least appetizing
aspect s.
I /is:i Vouill's "The Runaway Kerris Wheel'

holds the readers interest and almost maKos nun
believe in its strange little world of carnival and
stars. While less than polished unsteady syntax
intrudes on some of the best passagesâ€”-it makes
pleasant reading.
The Workshop's strongest pieces, however, are
the first and last two aehingly real Saturday eve
nings on the Farm. The first, "Saturday Night"
by David Schuman. watches a Psych major's reac
tions to an unbearable workload and an unsym
pathetic girlfriend. It draws no conclusions, but
leaves the reader with an impression of having
stepped briefly into someone's soul while eaves
dropping on his conversation.
The second, "Sim* You Round Quad'' by Melissa
I'routy, looks out through the eyes of a blonde
coed on a too-frenetic date. An impressionistic
piece cast in the present tense, it consistently main
tains a frighteningly believable illusion.
Certainly no one will feel he has spent his 10
cents in vain, and hopefully many will be encour
aged to contribute to future issues. As a bi-weekly,
the Workshop has great potential as a forum for
Olltd wise buried I tlenl.
