# New By-Laws To Be Heard
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Executive Editor 
The Legislature By-Laws Committee meets tonight at 7:15
in Tresitkler to consider the NSA By-Law change proposed
last quarter by ASSU President Scott Mc√üride, the Daily bill
which would establish a year long editorship, and two other pro
posed By-Laws.
The first part of the meeting will be in joint session with the

Executive-Legislative Reorganiza-"*
tion Committee, which is consider- j
ing a constitutional overhaul of j
the President's and Vice-Presi- <
dent's office.
Among the proposals that the J
committee is considering is an j
amendment to have the President j
and Vice-President run on the
same ticket in the spring cam- {
paign.
By-Law Changes
The NSA proposal would call!
for the election of some of the
delegates to the national conven
tion in the summer. Only the
ASSU President-elect and the
NSA coordinator would be ap
pointed. All ot her delegates would
be elected in a campus-wide elec
tion.
The Daily By-Laws changes in
clude a general up-dating of the;
Daily constitution, but the most j
controversial part is a*section of;
the bill changing the term of,
office of the editor from half a j
year 1o a full school year.
11l connection with the bill, By-'
Laws chairman Carl Hillenbrand ;
announced that: former editors, j
present editorial board members,
and present night editors would j
be invited to attend the meeting, j
Supporters of the change feel'
that the longer editorship would i
produce a better newspaper. Op-:
ponents, however, feel that the
longer editorship might limit the
opportunities for advancement on j
the paper and would mean that if
a bad editor were elected he would
serve for a full year rather than
only a half year.
Overseas Campus Board
Another By-Law that the com-i
mittc will consider is the Over-j
seas Campus Alumni Board bill !

which would establish a new
board to coordinate activities and
programs for students who have
studied at the overseas campuses.
The final bill which the commit
tee will study tonight is the Social
Procedures bill, sponsored by Vice-
President Mary Ann Odegaard.
The bill would overhaul the By-
Laws concerning registration of
social events, which in certain
areas are considered outdated.
Hillenbrand stated that the
meeting would be open to the pub
lic and that any member of the
University Community who op
poses the passage of a bill is in
vited to attend and give his argu
ments tc the committe. The Legis
lative sponsors of the bills and
all parties interested in the pas
sage of these bills are expected
to attend, he added.
