# 1000 Stanford Women Can't Be Wrong
## 
### SUE HEILMANN 
According to statistics recently re
leased l»y tile Social Regulations Com
nuttee, a majority of Stanford women
consider present social regulations both
somewhat restrictive and not too use
ful. The women on campus tend to fa
vor liberalizing hours for upperclass
women, liberalizing rules for women
in men's residences and especially
changes in the overnight policy.
Coeds did, however, report that they
feel regulations are somewhat desirable
in learning social responsibility and that
they have enough freedom under pres
ent regs to make social decisions.
About (ill per cent of the women feel
that the university has little or no obli
gation to set standards for the univer
sity community, although many girls
questioned the definition of 'standards.'
They did,however, report that their
parents would not respond favorably to
liberalized regs.
About three-quarters of women ques
tioned said that they would like to ac

eept the added responsibility of liberal
ization for late leave hours, overnight,
regs, sign-out procedure and chaperone
requirements, and they also felt that
most of the women students on campus
would honor increased freedom.
Students were especially interested
in changes in midweek overnights and
chaperones. They reported being gener
ally satisfied with the sign-out proce
dure, the key system and men iu wom
en's residences.
When asked the purpose of social
regulations, women reported that they
feel present regs are designed primar
ily to control moral behavior; with pro
tection, promoting order and providing
a structure for the woman who may
need it coming as secondary concerns.
.Most coeds emphasized, however, that
they feel social regs should be designed
more to serve as a means of enabling
the university to contact a student in
case of emergency. Safety and fulfill
ing a responsibility to parents were also
mentioned as purposes of ideal social

regs.
When asked what midweek overnight
jmlicy they favored for women stu
dents, coeds voted for a graduated sys
tem ranging from "only when emer
gency demands" for freshmen to "un
limited for upperclass women (especi
ally for seniors — somewhat less
strongly for juniors).
Women students also tended to favor
keeping the present hours for fresh
men women. Even though a majority
of women reported that when they were
freshmen they considered their hours
"moderate to somewhat restrictive," a
majority of coeds would vote to keep
freshmen women's hours as they are
or make them even more restrictive.
Keeping in mind their desire for more
personal responsibility in the area of
overnight procedure, coeds would like
to simplify current sign-out cards. Stu
dents strongly favored requiring all
women to indicate the address and ex
jiected time of return. Requiring the
mode of trans]iortation and compan

ions drew less support. Most coeds did
not favor requiring tlie name ol' a hos
ess.
Conc«Tning open houses, the vole was
evenly divided over whether or not resi
dences should be required to register
their open house hours. A bare major
ity opted for non- registration.
The idea tliat open house hours be
up to each individual house drew strong
support.
Women favored having tlieir resi
dences open from 7 to 11 p.m.
So far as correlating residences with
replies is concerned, there do not ap
pear to be any clear-cut trends of "very
liberal" or "very conservative."
Replies from Union tended to be most
liberal — those from tlie Row were by
and large the most conservative. Flo
Mo and Lag questionnaires were al
most identical.
Branner coeds were slightly more lib
eral than the dollies Ln Roble — but
differences, again, we r e relatively
slight.

According to statistics recently re
leased l»y tile Social Regulations Com
nuttee, a majority of Stanford women
consider present social regulations both
somewhat restrictive and not too use
ful. The women on campus tend to fa
vor liberalizing hours for upperclass
women, liberalizing rules for women
in men's residences and especially
changes in the overnight policy.
Coeds did, however, report that they
feel regulations are somewhat desirable
in learning social responsibility and that
they have enough freedom under pres
ent regs to make social decisions.
About (ill per cent of the women feel
that the university has little or no obli
gation to set standards for the univer
sity community, although many girls
questioned the definition of 'standards.'
They did,however, report that their
parents would not respond favorably to
liberalized regs.
About three-quarters of women ques
tioned said that they would like to ac

eept the added responsibility of liberal
ization for late leave hours, overnight,
regs, sign-out procedure and chaperone
requirements, and they also felt that
most of the women students on campus
would honor increased freedom.
Students were especially interested
in changes in midweek overnights and
chaperones. They reported being gener
ally satisfied with the sign-out proce
dure, the key system and men iu wom
en's residences.
When asked the purpose of social
regulations, women reported that they
feel present regs are designed primar
ily to control moral behavior; with pro
tection, promoting order and providing
a structure for the woman who may
need it coming as secondary concerns.
.Most coeds emphasized, however, that
they feel social regs should be designed
more to serve as a means of enabling
the university to contact a student in
case of emergency. Safety and fulfill
ing a responsibility to parents were also
mentioned as purposes of ideal social

regs.
When asked what midweek overnight
jmlicy they favored for women stu
dents, coeds voted for a graduated sys
tem ranging from "only when emer
gency demands" for freshmen to "un
limited for upperclass women (especi
ally for seniors — somewhat less
strongly for juniors).
Women students also tended to favor
keeping the present hours for fresh
men women. Even though a majority
of women reported that when they were
freshmen they considered their hours
"moderate to somewhat restrictive," a
majority of coeds would vote to keep
freshmen women's hours as they are
or make them even more restrictive.
Keeping in mind their desire for more
personal responsibility in the area of
overnight procedure, coeds would like
to simplify current sign-out cards. Stu
dents strongly favored requiring all
women to indicate the address and ex
jiected time of return. Requiring the
mode of trans]iortation and compan
