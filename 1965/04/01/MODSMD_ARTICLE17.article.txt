## The 						Relevance of PE In a Fifty-Mile March 
### Roger Magnuson 
A lamentablo misfortune il is that PE courses are hold in somc
what low esteem in (he groves.of our Stanford academe.
Instead of looking upon the general studies athletic requirements
as an enrichment, indeed, a necessary part of ihc well-being of the
scholar, one often detects a certain reservation about things physical, j
Interrupted only by a sort of insouciant flurry of activity to get '
the requirements out of the way as gracefully and conveniently as
! possible.
TOTAL WAR OR A PROTRACTED CONFLICT?
And when a sludent does take a PE course, it's total war for a
quarter, rather than protracted conflict.
Something really should be done.
Assuming, as it is fashionable to assume, that students al'e gen
erally mature, consistent, and santiary (.although maybe a lit tie
alienated), the problem obviously reduces to: -
How can physical education make itself relevant to the interests,
goals, and legitimate aspirations of the Stanford student? How may
it make it possible for him to athletically relate, io identify with
I physical education?
The answer is obvious: it must acquiesce to the superstitious of
the student community by altering the content of its courses.
Bowling in fine. (It's black ball—white pin symbolism is ingeni
j ous.) But in a day of social disruption and non-violence? -Perhaps t£e
| department could consider some suggestions for real-relevant activi-
J ties. :
HONORS IN ACTIVISM?
! A sort of Honors in Activism.
Those who have commendable prison records as a result of break
-1 ing "bad" southern laws or those who have fled Berkeley, could be
granted Honors at! Entrance; advanced placement tests in essay form
| could be given in "Great Oehlocrats: Profiles in Courage," or "Cath
! arsis is a Prison Break and a Bail-jump," or something of similar
difficulty.
Once on the Farm the new-fangled PE major could begin to spe
cialize in areas like "Cattle Prongs and The Power of Positive Think
ing," indulging all the while in non-violent exercises for conditioning
such as "Marching," "The Sit-in" and"The Lie-in."
Whereby the student would come to class and demonstrate sundry
postures which the instructor, not necessarily a regular faculty
member (perhaps even a Unitarian minister), could judge in areas
of "poise," "grace," and like that.
MUSIC AS 'PE'
The PE Department could join ecumenically with the Music De
partment and combine in courses such "Various Folk Songs for Vari
ous Crises," and other types of vocal brouhaha.
Strange as it may seem, a music minor could even supplement a
physical education major; but then, relevant athletics often make
! strange bedfellows.
Of course, the course of study wouldn't be complete without "How
! I Learned to Stop Worrying and Absorb Police Brutality," certainly
the well-known, popular, optimistic pamphlet, "Every Administrator
Must Have His Sproul Hall."
WITH EMINENT LECTURERS
Guest lecturers could be brought in like Mario Savio, or Jack
(In the beginning was the WORD) Weinberg, and other eminent pub
lic figures, who could speak on any number of subjects from "How
to be Vulgar Gracefully" to "A Free University in a Free Society
Comes Only Through Isometrics."
In short, the physical education program could illustrate the need
for adequate physical conditioning in philosophical meliorism, and
hence become once more a relevant force in the academic commu
nity.
Teaching subjects of some utility, appealing to those for whom
; physical activity itself has no particular appeal.
BRINGING CLASS TO THE MOB
Not only would the products of such training be in better condi
tion for what lies ahead of them, but in the years after, perhaps
the tone of mass demonstrations could be enhanced.
Perhaps, even class could come to the mob.
For what more sanguinary accomplishment does the Academy
dare hope?

postures which the instructor, not necessarily a regular faculty

MUSIC AS 'PE'
The PE Department could join ecumenically with the Music De
partment and combine in courses such "Various Folk Songs for Vari
ous Crises," and other types of vocal brouhaha.
Strange as it may seem, a music minor could even supplement a
physical education major; but then, relevant athletics often make
! strange bedfellows.
Of course, the course of study wouldn't be complete without "How
! I Learned to Stop Worrying and Absorb Police Brutality," certainly
the well-known, popular, optimistic pamphlet, "Every Administrator
Must Have His Sproul Hall."
WITH EMINENT LECTURERS
Guest lecturers could be brought in like Mario Savio, or Jack
(In the beginning was the WORD) Weinberg, and other eminent pub
lic figures, who could speak on any number of subjects from "How
to be Vulgar Gracefully" to "A Free University in a Free Society
Comes Only Through Isometrics."
In short, the physical education program could illustrate the need
for adequate physical conditioning in philosophical meliorism, and
hence become once more a relevant force in the academic commu
nity.

BRINGING CLASS TO THE MOB
Not only would the products of such training be in better condi

the tone of mass demonstrations could be enhanced.

TOTAL WAR OR A PROTRACTED CONFLICT?
And when a sludent does take a PE course, it's total war for a

Something really should be done.
Assuming, as it is fashionable to assume, that students al'e gen
erally mature, consistent, and santiary (.although maybe a lit tie

How can physical education make itself relevant to the interests,
goals, and legitimate aspirations of the Stanford student? How may
it make it possible for him to athletically relate, io identify with
I physical education?
The answer is obvious: it must acquiesce to the superstitious of
the student community by altering the content of its courses.
