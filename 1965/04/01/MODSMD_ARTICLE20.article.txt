## An Answer to the Second Look 
### 
Ktlilor, The Dally:
The authors of "A Second Look"
have made some valid criticisms
of the fraternity systems. They
indicate that definite problems
exist in various aspects of frater
nity life. This booklet is intro
duced as critical information, but
the generalizations provided pro
duce distortions of the situations.
The first aspect which the book
let criticizes is rush. Over the past
three years, the fraternities have
been attempting to develop a rush
policy which will give the fresh
men and the fraternities the great
est opportunity for evaluation. A
committee which was organized
Winter Quarter by IFC, lIIC, ICC,
and the Wilbur sponsors has al
ready begun meeting to deter
mine a rush policy which will de
crease superficiality and pressure
in the future.
The second part of the booklet
indicates that fraternity initia
tions are only poor imitations of
high school initiations. This is not
tlie case, because initiations are
based on traditions that are asso
ciated with the foundations of a
fraternity. Most of the houses
have taken various measures;
some are major and others are
more minor and gradual in de-!
veloping initiation procedures
which are constructive and re
warding for the pledges and ac
tives.
The section on social life seems

invalid because it is based on the
premise that too many freshmen
.join a fraternity to use it as a
social crutch. Fraternity social life
forms a nucleus for the individual
to have a comprehensive social life
if the individual chooses to ex
pand on the base provided.
With tlie establishment of the
Interfraternity Academic Commit
tee, the IFC has begun an attempt
to improve fraternity scholarship.
Studies of ways to improve schol
arship, establishment of living
group seminars, guest-in-resident
programs, and various other
topics have been undertaken.
These attempts combined with
extensive individual fraternity ef
forts to improve scholarship are
bringing an increased considera
tion of fraternities as an integral
part of the academic community.
These are some of the actions
which IFC and the fraternities
have taken. I agree changes in
fraternity thinking are necessary,
but these changes can not be com
pleted immediately without dam
aging the foundations of the fra
ternity concept and the system as
a whole. The changes must be
based on a recognition of prob
lems with a gradual implementing
of new ideas and approaches with
-1 in each house and the fraternity
system. This has already been
started. "A Second Look" has only
reiterated problems which the fra
ternities not only have acknowl
edged, but also have taken posi

tive and constructive actions to
solve.

• Not True!
Editor, The Daily:
We read the article about our
"marriage" with mixed reactions
last, week at the French campus,
realizing that to some it was in
poor taste, while to others it was
humorous. We would like to say
that it is not true and do not be
lieve that it was entered in a ma
licious manner or in one that
would embarrass you, the "Daily,"
Dr. Walker or his staff.
Our apologies to all those in
volved in the misunderstanding.

• Tyranny of the Masses
Editor, The Daily:
This I write with goodwill to-
I ward all. I do so as a graduate of
Stanford University and of the
| Stanford Medical School, and as
ja regular subscriber to The Stan
ford Daily.
1 It has to do with the recent
I LASSU resolution approving com
plete ASSU jurisdiction over the
student disciplinary process. It
amounts to a few words of cau
tion (as a reminder) to the effect
that there is such a thing as the
tyranny of the majority, not to

mention the.' tyranny of the i
masses.
The heavy vote of the legisla
ture of 94-18 approving complete
ASSU jurisdiction over student
discipline is so nearly unanimous
that it approaches tho possible
"tyranny of the masses" in some
sort of eventual showdown.
It takes great maturity to han
dle freedom properly, and I be
lieve there is ample evidence to
prove that man will eventually
escape from freedom to some sort
of tyranny when the chips are
down.
It appears to me that if the stu
dents are determined to discipline
themselves collectively, that pro
vision should be made by the stu
dents to protect themselves from!
or against themselves. There is i
no greater tyranny than might (in I
numbers) is right. This suggests a !
Student's Bill of Rights to protect
the God given or inalienable free-1
doms or rights of the individual 1
whoever he is and wherever he >
is—against any mass, collective, !
or governmental tyranny in
this case, collective student
tyranny.
An alternative appears to bo to:
give to the Administration of the
.University freely, and without
rancor or resentment all the re
sponsibility that normally would
be due Stanford University, or any
university of it's kind, that per
tains to student discipline. Some
of this authority might be dele
gated, of course, to the faculty.
I am prone to believe that in
the matter of student discipline
a higher level of maturity would
! be found in the President of the
I University and the Board of Trus
tees and that the student in his
better judgment would freely de
sire a more steadying hand than
that of his collective own. More
over, it seems that any university
administration has a responsibil
ity in student discipline that can
not be completely relinquished to
students or others.

• I 'ill on the Hark
Editor, The Daily:
As perhaps "the oldest living
Master's degree candidate now fin
ing up," I have had a rather ex
tended acquaintance with The
Daily. (Started in 1950-54, came
back in 1959-61, and have been
hanging around Stanford ever
since.)
The. Daily has varied in quality
cyclically over the years, as does
any institution. My own feeling
is that The Daily circa 1963-64
and 1965-65 is by far the best over
all series of Dailies I've read. Per
haps it would be of interest to get
down to specifics:
First, my criteria I believe a
! campus newspaper should fill the
! gaps left by "normal" newspapers,
i to wit: the Palo Alto Times does
! an excellent job of covering Pen
insula news. The Times and the
! Examiner and Chronicle hit the
national and international news.
Now, except for (in my opin
ion) a certain minority of stu
dents, such as Political Science,
' History, and Economics majors,
reportage of these events and a
: forum for expression of opinion
(via letters to the editor, editor
ials, opinion writers, etc. > exists
in the aforementioned "normal"
papers. But up until 1963-64 and
1964-65 (again in my opinion),
little was done in The Daily about
letting us know what went on
outside the campus that would
affect us inside, or what was go
ing on within the boundaries of
the campus.
For instance, we really had good
coverage of who won awards, pub
lished important papers, or de
livered addresses, until recently.
The sports reportage and much of
the news was mainly opinion, and
little interest was taken in the
treatment, of students by the Uni
versity.
In short, I think you are doing
a grand job and I applaud th e
Stanford news coverage I now
see in The Daily.

Studies of ways to improve schol

topics have been undertaken.
These attempts combined with
extensive individual fraternity ef
forts to improve scholarship are
bringing an increased considera
tion of fraternities as an integral
part of the academic community.
These are some of the actions
which IFC and the fraternities
have taken. I agree changes in
fraternity thinking are necessary,
but these changes can not be com
pleted immediately without dam
aging the foundations of the fra
ternity concept and the system as
a whole. The changes must be
based on a recognition of prob

of new ideas and approaches with

• Tyranny of the Masses
Editor, The Daily:
This I write with goodwill to-
I ward all. I do so as a graduate of
Stanford University and of the
| Stanford Medical School, and as
ja regular subscriber to The Stan
ford Daily.
1 It has to do with the recent
I LASSU resolution approving com
plete ASSU jurisdiction over the
student disciplinary process. It
amounts to a few words of cau
tion (as a reminder) to the effect
that there is such a thing as the
tyranny of the majority, not to

mention the.' tyranny of the i
masses.
The heavy vote of the legisla
ture of 94-18 approving complete
ASSU jurisdiction over student
discipline is so nearly unanimous
that it approaches tho possible
"tyranny of the masses" in some
sort of eventual showdown.
It takes great maturity to han
dle freedom properly, and I be
lieve there is ample evidence to
prove that man will eventually
escape from freedom to some sort
of tyranny when the chips are
down.
It appears to me that if the stu
dents are determined to discipline
themselves collectively, that pro
vision should be made by the stu
dents to protect themselves from!
or against themselves. There is i
no greater tyranny than might (in I
numbers) is right. This suggests a !
Student's Bill of Rights to protect
the God given or inalienable free-1
doms or rights of the individual 1
whoever he is and wherever he >
is—against any mass, collective, !
or governmental tyranny in
this case, collective student
tyranny.
An alternative appears to bo to:
give to the Administration of the
.University freely, and without
rancor or resentment all the re
sponsibility that normally would
be due Stanford University, or any
university of it's kind, that per
tains to student discipline. Some
of this authority might be dele
gated, of course, to the faculty.
I am prone to believe that in
the matter of student discipline
a higher level of maturity would
! be found in the President of the
I University and the Board of Trus
tees and that the student in his
better judgment would freely de
sire a more steadying hand than
that of his collective own. More
over, it seems that any university
administration has a responsibil

not be completely relinquished to

As perhaps "the oldest living

tended acquaintance with The
Daily. (Started in 1950-54, came
back in 1959-61, and have been
hanging around Stanford ever
since.)
The. Daily has varied in quality
cyclically over the years, as does
any institution. My own feeling
is that The Daily circa 1963-64
and 1965-65 is by far the best over
all series of Dailies I've read. Per
haps it would be of interest to get
down to specifics:
First, my criteria I believe a
! campus newspaper should fill the
! gaps left by "normal" newspapers,
i to wit: the Palo Alto Times does
! an excellent job of covering Pen
insula news. The Times and the
! Examiner and Chronicle hit the
national and international news.
Now, except for (in my opin
ion) a certain minority of stu
dents, such as Political Science,
' History, and Economics majors,
reportage of these events and a
: forum for expression of opinion
(via letters to the editor, editor
ials, opinion writers, etc. > exists
in the aforementioned "normal"
papers. But up until 1963-64 and
1964-65 (again in my opinion),
little was done in The Daily about
letting us know what went on
outside the campus that would
affect us inside, or what was go
ing on within the boundaries of
the campus.
For instance, we really had good
coverage of who won awards, pub
lished important papers, or de
livered addresses, until recently.
The sports reportage and much of
the news was mainly opinion, and
little interest was taken in the
treatment, of students by the Uni

• Tyranny of the Masses
Editor, The Daily:
This I write with goodwill to-
I ward all. I do so as a graduate of
Stanford University and of the
| Stanford Medical School, and as
ja regular subscriber to The Stan
ford Daily.
1 It has to do with the recent
I LASSU resolution approving com
plete ASSU jurisdiction over the
student disciplinary process. It
amounts to a few words of cau
tion (as a reminder) to the effect
that there is such a thing as the
tyranny of the majority, not to

mention the.' tyranny of the i
masses.
The heavy vote of the legisla
ture of 94-18 approving complete
ASSU jurisdiction over student
discipline is so nearly unanimous
that it approaches tho possible
"tyranny of the masses" in some
sort of eventual showdown.
It takes great maturity to han
dle freedom properly, and I be
lieve there is ample evidence to
prove that man will eventually
escape from freedom to some sort
of tyranny when the chips are
down.
It appears to me that if the stu
dents are determined to discipline
themselves collectively, that pro
vision should be made by the stu
dents to protect themselves from!
or against themselves. There is i
no greater tyranny than might (in I
numbers) is right. This suggests a !
Student's Bill of Rights to protect
the God given or inalienable free-1
doms or rights of the individual 1
whoever he is and wherever he >
is—against any mass, collective, !
or governmental tyranny in
this case, collective student
tyranny.
An alternative appears to bo to:
give to the Administration of the
.University freely, and without
rancor or resentment all the re
sponsibility that normally would
be due Stanford University, or any
university of it's kind, that per
tains to student discipline. Some
of this authority might be dele
gated, of course, to the faculty.
I am prone to believe that in
the matter of student discipline
a higher level of maturity would
! be found in the President of the
I University and the Board of Trus
tees and that the student in his
better judgment would freely de
sire a more steadying hand than
that of his collective own. More
over, it seems that any university
administration has a responsibil

not be completely relinquished to
students or others.

As perhaps "the oldest living
Master's degree candidate now fin

tended acquaintance with The
Daily. (Started in 1950-54, came
back in 1959-61, and have been
hanging around Stanford ever
since.)
The. Daily has varied in quality
cyclically over the years, as does
any institution. My own feeling
is that The Daily circa 1963-64
and 1965-65 is by far the best over
all series of Dailies I've read. Per
haps it would be of interest to get
down to specifics:
First, my criteria I believe a
! campus newspaper should fill the
! gaps left by "normal" newspapers,
i to wit: the Palo Alto Times does
! an excellent job of covering Pen
insula news. The Times and the
! Examiner and Chronicle hit the
national and international news.
Now, except for (in my opin
ion) a certain minority of stu
dents, such as Political Science,
' History, and Economics majors,
reportage of these events and a
: forum for expression of opinion
(via letters to the editor, editor
ials, opinion writers, etc. > exists
in the aforementioned "normal"
papers. But up until 1963-64 and
1964-65 (again in my opinion),
little was done in The Daily about
letting us know what went on
outside the campus that would
affect us inside, or what was go
ing on within the boundaries of
the campus.
For instance, we really had good
coverage of who won awards, pub
lished important papers, or de
livered addresses, until recently.
The sports reportage and much of
the news was mainly opinion, and
little interest was taken in the
treatment, of students by the Uni

In short, I think you are doing
a grand job and I applaud th e
Stanford news coverage I now

The authors of "A Second Look"
have made some valid criticisms
of the fraternity systems. They
indicate that definite problems
exist in various aspects of frater
nity life. This booklet is intro
duced as critical information, but
the generalizations provided pro
duce distortions of the situations.
The first aspect which the book
let criticizes is rush. Over the past
three years, the fraternities have
been attempting to develop a rush
policy which will give the fresh
men and the fraternities the great
est opportunity for evaluation. A
committee which was organized
Winter Quarter by IFC, lIIC, ICC,
and the Wilbur sponsors has al
ready begun meeting to deter
mine a rush policy which will de
crease superficiality and pressure
in the future.
The second part of the booklet
indicates that fraternity initia
tions are only poor imitations of
high school initiations. This is not
tlie case, because initiations are
based on traditions that are asso
ciated with the foundations of a
fraternity. Most of the houses
have taken various measures;
some are major and others are
more minor and gradual in de-!
veloping initiation procedures
which are constructive and re
warding for the pledges and ac
tives.
The section on social life seems

invalid because it is based on the
premise that too many freshmen
.join a fraternity to use it as a
social crutch. Fraternity social life
forms a nucleus for the individual
to have a comprehensive social life
if the individual chooses to ex

fraternity thinking are necessary,
but these changes can not be com

aging the foundations of the fra
ternity concept and the system as

based on a recognition of prob

of new ideas and approaches with

started. "A Second Look" has only

• Not True!
Editor, The Daily:
We read the article about our

realizing that to some it was in
poor taste, while to others it was
humorous. We would like to say
that it is not true and do not be

• Tyranny of the Masses
Editor, The Daily:
This I write with goodwill to-
I ward all. I do so as a graduate of
Stanford University and of the
| Stanford Medical School, and as
ja regular subscriber to The Stan
ford Daily.
1 It has to do with the recent
I LASSU resolution approving com
plete ASSU jurisdiction over the
student disciplinary process. It
amounts to a few words of cau
tion (as a reminder) to the effect
that there is such a thing as the
tyranny of the majority, not to

mention the.' tyranny of the i
masses.
The heavy vote of the legisla
ture of 94-18 approving complete
ASSU jurisdiction over student
discipline is so nearly unanimous
that it approaches tho possible
"tyranny of the masses" in some
sort of eventual showdown.
It takes great maturity to han
dle freedom properly, and I be
lieve there is ample evidence to
prove that man will eventually
escape from freedom to some sort
of tyranny when the chips are
down.
It appears to me that if the stu
dents are determined to discipline
themselves collectively, that pro
vision should be made by the stu
dents to protect themselves from!
or against themselves. There is i
no greater tyranny than might (in I
numbers) is right. This suggests a !
Student's Bill of Rights to protect
the God given or inalienable free-1
doms or rights of the individual 1
whoever he is and wherever he >
is—against any mass, collective, !
or governmental tyranny in
this case, collective student
tyranny.
An alternative appears to bo to:
give to the Administration of the
.University freely, and without
rancor or resentment all the re
sponsibility that normally would
be due Stanford University, or any
university of it's kind, that per
tains to student discipline. Some
of this authority might be dele
gated, of course, to the faculty.
I am prone to believe that in
the matter of student discipline
a higher level of maturity would
! be found in the President of the
I University and the Board of Trus
tees and that the student in his
better judgment would freely de
sire a more steadying hand than
that of his collective own. More
over, it seems that any university
administration has a responsibil
ity in student discipline that can
not be completely relinquished to
students or others.

• I 'ill on the Hark
Editor, The Daily:
As perhaps "the oldest living
Master's degree candidate now fin
ing up," I have had a rather ex
tended acquaintance with The
Daily. (Started in 1950-54, came
back in 1959-61, and have been
hanging around Stanford ever
since.)
The. Daily has varied in quality
cyclically over the years, as does
any institution. My own feeling
is that The Daily circa 1963-64
and 1965-65 is by far the best over
all series of Dailies I've read. Per
haps it would be of interest to get
down to specifics:
First, my criteria I believe a
! campus newspaper should fill the
! gaps left by "normal" newspapers,
i to wit: the Palo Alto Times does
! an excellent job of covering Pen
insula news. The Times and the
! Examiner and Chronicle hit the
national and international news.
Now, except for (in my opin
ion) a certain minority of stu
dents, such as Political Science,
' History, and Economics majors,
reportage of these events and a
: forum for expression of opinion
(via letters to the editor, editor
ials, opinion writers, etc. > exists
in the aforementioned "normal"
papers. But up until 1963-64 and
1964-65 (again in my opinion),
little was done in The Daily about
letting us know what went on
outside the campus that would
affect us inside, or what was go
ing on within the boundaries of
the campus.
For instance, we really had good
coverage of who won awards, pub
lished important papers, or de
livered addresses, until recently.
The sports reportage and much of
the news was mainly opinion, and
little interest was taken in the
treatment, of students by the Uni
versity.
In short, I think you are doing
a grand job and I applaud th e
Stanford news coverage I now
see in The Daily.
KENNETH HIRSCH
Ktlilor, The Dally:
The authors of "A Second Look"
have made some valid criticisms
of the fraternity systems. They
indicate that definite problems
exist in various aspects of frater
nity life. This booklet is intro
duced as critical information, but
the generalizations provided pro
duce distortions of the situations.
The first aspect which the book
let criticizes is rush. Over the past
three years, the fraternities have
been attempting to develop a rush
policy which will give the fresh
men and the fraternities the great
est opportunity for evaluation. A
committee which was organized
Winter Quarter by IFC, lIIC, ICC,
and the Wilbur sponsors has al
ready begun meeting to deter
mine a rush policy which will de
crease superficiality and pressure
in the future.
The second part of the booklet
indicates that fraternity initia
tions are only poor imitations of
high school initiations. This is not
tlie case, because initiations are
based on traditions that are asso
ciated with the foundations of a
fraternity. Most of the houses
have taken various measures;
some are major and others are
more minor and gradual in de-!
veloping initiation procedures
which are constructive and re
warding for the pledges and ac
tives.
The section on social life seems

invalid because it is based on the
premise that too many freshmen
.join a fraternity to use it as a
social crutch. Fraternity social life
forms a nucleus for the individual
to have a comprehensive social life
if the individual chooses to ex
pand on the base provided.
With tlie establishment of the
Interfraternity Academic Commit
tee, the IFC has begun an attempt
to improve fraternity scholarship.
Studies of ways to improve schol
arship, establishment of living
group seminars, guest-in-resident
programs, and various other
topics have been undertaken.
These attempts combined with
extensive individual fraternity ef
forts to improve scholarship are
bringing an increased considera
tion of fraternities as an integral
part of the academic community.
These are some of the actions
which IFC and the fraternities
have taken. I agree changes in
fraternity thinking are necessary,
but these changes can not be com
pleted immediately without dam
aging the foundations of the fra
ternity concept and the system as
a whole. The changes must be
