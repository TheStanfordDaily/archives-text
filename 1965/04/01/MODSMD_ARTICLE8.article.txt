# Profs Feel Spirit of Love In Alabama
## 
### JANIE ARIES 
Robert McAfee Brown, Profes
sor of Religion, and Jeffrey
Smith. Professor of Philosophy,
both agreed the gift of Selma, Ala
bama, to those who participated in
the civil right demonstration was
a spirit of "almost unbelievable
love."
Sponsored by the Mid-Peninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing, the two
professors described their recent
experiences in Selma at the time
of the march 1o Montgomery.
When Smith read that James
Reeb had died, he knew he had
to go to Selma. He described the
compound in which the demon
strators lived, two blocks of N'e
gro housing, cordoned off by tho
police. Those inside felt they were
among friends.
The sense of community, said
Brown, was the closest analogue
to what the kingdom of heaven
must be. At the barrier to the com
pound one could feel ihe enor
mous sentiment of love over hate.
The two speakers expressed ad
miration that the Negroes could
live in an atmosphere of hatred
and yet feel this genuine love.
The meaning of Selma is for
ever, concluded Smith. Now that
the battle in Selma has been won.
Brown believes attention must be
focused on the Voter Registration
Bill before Congress. "Selma is a
gift given to us, but the problem
that it caricatures is everywhere,"
he stated.
Selma is a lot like Palo Alto,
Brown commented, though the
barrier here is housing, he said.
The purpose of last night's meet
ing was to recruit students for a
campaign to elicit, student sup
port for fair housing.
