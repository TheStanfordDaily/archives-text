### BOB DAVIS 
"The debate that is supposed !
to be the heart of the American I
political process never came oil"
in the 1964 Presidential cam
paign, former Republican Na
tional Chairman Dean Burch told
an overflow audience in Tresidder
yesterday, under sponsorship of;
The Stanford Area Young Repub- i
lieans.
It was Bureh's last speech :.Â«s
national chairman, his tei'm end- 1
ing last night.
"On one side, the groundwork !
was laid hut like tangos, it takes
two to make a debate. And Lyn- j
don Johnson wasn't having any," !
he said.
Burch insisted that Johnson
was running against a "caricature
of a trigger-happy extremist" and 1
that this caricature was largely
drawn by "our own fellow Repub-j
licans."
\Vishy-Wasliy ( ainpaiyns
"We've become used to cam- j
paigns that are not sharp clashes
of principle," Burch explained, "it
was on this score that the 1964 j
campaign may have shattered pre- \
cedent and made some fresh politi-:
cal history."
Burch said that one party last ,
| year did attempt to articulate ai
clear and consistent point of view, j
j"Some would call it conservatism.
But I'd just as soon call it tradi
tional Republicanism," he ex-1
plained.
j According to Burch, an Ameri
can political party must be broad
enough to attract the public sup
port it will need to be successful,
, and yet it must be separate and ;
I distinct, organized around a core!
I of principles.
The Republicans were such a
i party in 1964, he insisted.
"Hidden" Issues
j Burch reminded his audience of
what he called the "hidden cam-j
; paign" of the last election. It in- j
I eluded the "campaign in which!
Senator Goldwater called for the i
interdiction of Viet Cong supply j
lines," a system of block grants |
to the states, and executive cn-
J forcement to assure equal voting!
rights to all Americans. "But ;
I somehow, these issues never got
j through," Burch remarked,
j Burch "fervently dislikes" the;
j inference linking the John Burch j
! Society and the Republican party,,
he made clear in a press confer-!
i ence before the speech. But he re
j marked that he never heard that i
i the John Birch Society was trying :
1 to overthrow the country like the j
j Communists.
Robert: Welch is an "absolutely !
impractical, ill-advised man." lie;
