Need a Psychiatrist?
of people arc on the couch today, for high pressure living in a
strife-torn world makes impossible demands on the human being. Compe
tent medical help is expensive and treatment is often lengthy and diffi- ,
.lilt, for the human mind a marvelous and complex fabric woven over
years of experience and countless reactions to life. To understand and j
unravel the living material of the mind requires immense skill, training
and knowledge.
While the sciences of psychology and psychoanalysis are not much
more than half a century old, Jesus Christ, some twenty centuries ago,
healed and treated a great variety of illnesses, physical and mental, with
perfect success: "He went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues â– 
and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and
every infirmity among the people . . . and they brought Him all the sick, I
those afflicted with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, and
paralytics, and Ile healed them ... " ( Matthew 4 :23~25).
The Old Testament calls Jesus Christ the "Wonderful Counselor"
(Isaiah { >:6). for as the Great I'hysican He has healed more than one
case abandonded by men as hopeless. It i< because Jesus Christ is man's
Creator and Redeemer, and the Source of all life that He is in a unique
position to bring aid to men.
God's therapy begins with the new birth (which occurs when faith '
and trust is placed in the Lord Jesus Christ). The regenerating and re- j
new ing work of God which follows implants Christ within men to fill !
I the inner hollow which man calls "self". Modern psychologists have !
made a great fuss about the unconscious mind and "finding the true self",
but apart from spiritual birth and the indwelling life of Jesus Christ, their
therapy will fail, because God has made us creatures who are dependent
upon Him.
The Apostle Paul prayed that men would discover what the indwefl-
I ing life of < iod can mean to any individual" : "may (iod grant you, accord
| ing to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with sight by His
Spirit in the inner man, flint ( hrist may dwell in your hearts by faith ...
that you may be filled with all the fullness of God" (Ephesians 3:14-21).
Need a psychiatrist? Jesus Christ stands ready to help you. He said,
"All things are possible to him who believes" (Mark 9:23). Why be a
hollow man when He stands ready to fill you with Himself, to !>e the
Physician of your soul and the Guardian of your eternal destiny, if you
but ask Him today.
