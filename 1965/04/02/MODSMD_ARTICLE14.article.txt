# AN OVER-RATED FILM
## A 						Dissent On 'Zorba' 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
Since the acclaim for "Zorba
the Greek" has reached b a n d
wagon proportions, and since
there is strong evidence that the
rush to see and praise it will
become a stampede (brought on
by the tone-deaf critics and celeb
rities who have been tooting its
horn), now is definitely the time
to offer a dissenting opinion lest
the film be buried under a moun
tain of mindless admiration.
Basically, "Zorba's" problem is
pseudo-ness: in the absence of
a decent scenario, it craftily con
centrates on giving the illusion
of substance and significance,
whereas actually its pretensions
are entirely groundless. Proving

them so, however, involves a little
backtracking.
First of all, "Zorba's" skeletal
plot, coherent only in the sense
that the beginning and ending
are separated by a passage of
time, concerns the attempts of
Alan Bates, a young English poet
type, and Anthony Quinn, a mid
dle-aged lusty-type, to re-open a
Cretan lead mine left to Bates
by his father. They are both im
plied failures; Quinn, however,
is stronger by virtue of his ex
perience, i.e., his callousness in
the face of suffering and evil, and
his propensity for dancing his
problems away.
Unfortunate Advice
Quinn, as Zorba, unfortunately
cannot resist giving advice on
matters other than the mine it
self; in particular, he advises
that not to sleep with the local
young widow would be a sin.
Bates is progressively aghast,
adament, ambivalent, willing, and
eager; the widow is willing and
eager. Her local suitor protests
nonviolently and drowns himself.
The town protests violently and
slits her throat during the funeral
mass.
Zorba's mate (Lila Kedrova),
the aging proprietress of the
town's hotel, proves less contro
versial. Her death (from natural
causes) provokes a more shrug
(from Zorba) and a wild house
stripping spree (from the towns
folk) that leaves behind only the
corpse in its bed.
As a climax to all this, Zorba
characteristically and spectacu
larly bungles the mining opera
tion; but Bates learns to dance
his problems away; and so all

ends more or less happily, for
(hose who have survived the or
deal, that is.
In the interim, the possibilities
for meaning have divided them
selves into three neat, mutually
destructive camps. The result is
a windfall for analysis, but a
catastrophe for "Zorba." On the ;
basis of throat-slitting and house-j
stripping, the film's unflinching
realism might be taken as a sym
bolic comment on all mankind.'
Symbolic of what is not clear;
the most one can say on this ac
count is that "Zorba" definitely is
not a travel poster for Crete.
Gentle Satire?
Or, possibly the film is gently
satiric rather than savage; after
all, there are a few funny spots.
However, the gruesome memory
of blood and avarice immediately
dispells that notion, leaving only
the characters and their prob
lems. Thanks to a particularly un
enlightening script — a near
blank on such details as motiva
tion and conflict — this last re-'
sort is also unfruitful.
Alan Bates manages to trans
cend the situation. He employs
ihe eloquence of gesture and si
lence to communicate his agony
as a sterile artist and a failed
man, in the process giving a per
formance of remarkable subtlety
and sensitivity. Lila Kedrova does
nearly as well; but Anthony
Quinn is mediocre — all makeup
and affectation.
Of course, he is not the only
one at fault; the blame for "Zor-1
ba" can be liberally distributed'
onto the inept shoulders of writ
er, director, and producer alike. l
They should have started with l
decent material or not at all, in- j
stead of trying to pawn off paste
as the genuine article. For with I
Ihe exception of Alan Bates,
"Zorba" is over-priced, over
rated, and a colossal lead bal
loon that should have been shot
out of the sky long before now.
