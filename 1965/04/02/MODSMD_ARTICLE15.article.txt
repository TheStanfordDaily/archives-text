## 'Sound of Music' A Sentimental But Delightfully Charming Film 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
"The Sound of Music," th e
Rodgers and Hammerstein musi
cal loosely based on Maria
Trapp's memoir "The Trapp Fam
ily Singers," tells of a young
Austrian postulant, Maria, who
seems unsuited to become a
nun. Sent as a temporary gover
ness for Captain von Trapp's
seven children, she eventually
marries him and, to escape the
the Nazis, flees with him and
the children over the Alps to
Switzerland.
It is a sentimental story, and
critics are supposed to be hard
and unemotional men, unmoved
by sentiment and impervious to
charm. But the film version of
"The Sound of Music" is so de
lightfully charming that it could
weaken the re v solve of even the
strongest critic.
Producer-director Robert Wise
obviously fell in love with Aus
tria and although in Ted Mc-
Cord's magnificent color photog
raphy the film is beautiful
enough to be a travelogue, the
scenery supplements rather than
overpowers the actors.
Excellent Score
The score, although not Rod
gers' best, is still excellent, rang
ing from the exuberant "Do Re
Mi" to the inspirational "Climb
Every Mountain" and the tender
"Something Good" (one of two
new songs for which Rodgers sup
plied music AND lyrics).
As if the scenery and music
were not enough, Wise has as
sembled an almost perfect cast.
As Maria, Julie Andrews fits the
word that in "Mary Poppins" she

said should be used when one
couldn't think of anything else
to say: she is supercalifragilistic
expialidocious.
Indeed, from the moment the
camera, after soaring across the
Alps and over the Austrian coun
tryside, zooms in on ihe grassy
meadow where she is joyously
singing the title song, she is so
irresistibly and vibrantly alive
that she seems incandescent.
Outstanding Support
Christopher Plummer plays
the Captain with commendable
understatement, making the diffi
cult transition from martinet to
loving father totally believable.
In the large — and outstanding

—supporting cast Eleanor Park- j
or, Peggy Wood, Charmian Carr
and Kym Karath are exception
ally good. And Bil Baird's mario
nettes are marvelous.
Ernest Lehman's screenplay, j
although inexcusably overly melo-1
dramatic in the final graveyard
scene, is good.
Wise's direction is consistently
imaginative; his staging of the
"Do Re Mi" and "Something
Good" scenes (both aided consid
erably by choreographers Marc
Breaux and Dee Dee Wood) is
superb. And Boris Leven's ele-1
gant sets provide an appropriate
background for this enchanting)
film.

loving father totally believable.
In the large — and outstanding

—supporting cast Eleanor Park- j
or, Peggy Wood, Charmian Carr
and Kym Karath are exception
ally good. And Bil Baird's mario
nettes are marvelous.
Ernest Lehman's screenplay, j
although inexcusably overly melo-1
dramatic in the final graveyard
scene, is good.
Wise's direction is consistently
imaginative; his staging of the
"Do Re Mi" and "Something
Good" scenes (both aided consid
erably by choreographers Marc
Breaux and Dee Dee Wood) is
superb. And Boris Leven's ele-1
gant sets provide an appropriate
background for this enchanting)
film.
"The Sound of Music," th e
Rodgers and Hammerstein musi
cal loosely based on Maria
Trapp's memoir "The Trapp Fam
ily Singers," tells of a young
Austrian postulant, Maria, who
seems unsuited to become a
nun. Sent as a temporary gover
ness for Captain von Trapp's
seven children, she eventually
marries him and, to escape the
the Nazis, flees with him and
the children over the Alps to
Switzerland.
It is a sentimental story, and
critics are supposed to be hard
and unemotional men, unmoved
by sentiment and impervious to
charm. But the film version of
"The Sound of Music" is so de
lightfully charming that it could
weaken the re v solve of even the
strongest critic.
Producer-director Robert Wise
obviously fell in love with Aus
tria and although in Ted Mc-
Cord's magnificent color photog
raphy the film is beautiful
enough to be a travelogue, the
scenery supplements rather than
overpowers the actors.
Excellent Score
The score, although not Rod
gers' best, is still excellent, rang
ing from the exuberant "Do Re
Mi" to the inspirational "Climb
Every Mountain" and the tender
"Something Good" (one of two
new songs for which Rodgers sup
plied music AND lyrics).
As if the scenery and music
were not enough, Wise has as
sembled an almost perfect cast.
As Maria, Julie Andrews fits the
word that in "Mary Poppins" she

said should be used when one
couldn't think of anything else
to say: she is supercalifragilistic
expialidocious.
Indeed, from the moment the
camera, after soaring across the
Alps and over the Austrian coun
tryside, zooms in on ihe grassy
meadow where she is joyously
singing the title song, she is so
irresistibly and vibrantly alive
that she seems incandescent.
Outstanding Support
Christopher Plummer plays
the Captain with commendable
understatement, making the diffi
cult transition from martinet to
loving father totally believable.
