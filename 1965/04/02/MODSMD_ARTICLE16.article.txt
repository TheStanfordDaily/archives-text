## A 						Summary of Top Bay Area Entertainment 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
Since Monday night is Oscar night — Hollywood's annual ritual j
of self-congratulation — John Thayer, Foster Hirsch and I have i
decided to make our predictions, buoyed by our 13 for 15 record
on the Oscar nominations. Here are the people we think WILL—
but not necessarily SHOULD—win:
Best film: "31V FAIR LADY."
Rest actor: REX HARRISON.
Best actress: JULIE ANDREWS in a tight win over Kim Stan
ley, Julie will get it as much for excellent work in "The American- j
ization of Emily" and"The Sound of Music" (see review) as for
"Mary Poppins," the film for which she is nominated. Also, Julie's j
noticable absence in big winner "My Fair Lady" will help, as will j
the fact that while she and Hollywood are a mutual admiration so- !
ciety, there is no love lost between Kim Stanley and the film world.
Best supporting actor: STANLEY HOLLOW AY, unless Holly
wood decides, after giving its two top Oscars to Britishers, to get ;
patriotic—in which case it will go to Edmond O'Brien.
Best supporting actress: AGNES MOOREHEAD, although Gladys |
Cooper has an outside chance of swinging in on "My Fair Lady's" :
coattails.
Best director: STANLEY KUBRICK, although George Cukoi ;
might well get it since his "My Fair Lady" did not offend people as j
Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" did. Also, not since 1956 has the director
of the "Best Film" not won.
Best screenplay (adaptation): "MY FAIR LADY," unless Alan
Jay Lerner's screenplay is considered too close to the Broadway
original, in which case it will go to "Dr. Strangelove."
Best screenplay (original): "A HARD DAY'S NIGIIT," a choice
we realize puts us out on a limb, but it's the only film that every
critic we know of liked.
Best song: "< HIM CIIIM CIIEREE."
Best foreign film: "WOMAN IN THE DUNES," although this
Oscar usually goes to the best-known foreign film and therefore ;
might go to "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow."
FILMS
THE SOUND OF MUSIC is at the United Artists in San Fran
cisco (see review on this page).
ZORBA THE GREEK is at the Bridge in San Francisco (see re
view on this page).
THE SUITOR, a wild French farce starring Pierre Et;iix, and a
German color film of FAUST are today's and tomorrow's Tresid-'
der movies.
WHAT A WAY TO GO stars Shirley JXlacLaine as a woman whose
husbands get rich and then die in this movie at the flicks Sunday. 1
MONDO PAZZO. a sensationalist "Mondo Cane" type film, and
the marvelously escapist CARTOUCHE are at the Bijou.
MARY POPPINS is the Walt Disney musical fantasy, starring j
Julie Andrews, still at the Varsity.
PEYTON PLACE and RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE provide a
double dose of small-town sex in the program at: the Park.
SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON is the sensitive psychologi
cal suspense film at the Fine Arts with Ingmar Bergman's Oscar
winner THE VIRGIN SPRING.
HOW TO MURDER YOUR WIFE is the new Jack Lemmon com- i
edy that features Virna Lisi as the objeet of his homicidal inten
tions. Also on the bill at the Paris is LILIES OF THE FIELD, for
which Sidney Poitier won the Oscar as Best Actor last year, and
Oscar nominated cartoon THE PINK PIIINK.
DEAR HEART is the latest film by Delbert ("Marty") Mann.
It's teamed with a Peter Sellers movie, TRIAL AN!) ERROR, at
the Stanford.
MARRIAGE ITALIAN STYLE reteams Oscar nominee (and
former winner) Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni in this'
Italian comedy still at the Guild.
JAZZ (By RICK BALE)
LOUIS JORDAN and a very swinging quintet are backing the
great blues shouter BIG MAMA WILLIE MAE THORNTON as
well as providing some good jazz and rollicking humor of their own, 1
nightly at Basin Street West. Stanford students are admitted without
cover charge.
AHMAD JAMAL opened Tuesday at the Jazz Workshop, with
VERNELL FOURNIER back on the drums after a short absence.
The trio is much freer and more exploratory than during their last
S.F. stint at Basin Street West.
The 808 SUA LETT A TRIO performs nightly at El Matador,
where VINCE GUARALDI and BOLA SETE are due on the 14th.
In Sausalito, -ILAN HOFFMAN is at Gatsby's, and BRAZIL 65,
a latin vocal-instrumental group is at the Trident.
The DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET, the C'AL TJADER QUINTET,
and the BUDDY DE FRANCO QUARTET will appear at the Circle j
Star Theater in San Carlos Monday, April 5.

JAZZ (By RICK BALE)
LOUIS JORDAN and a very swinging quintet are backing the
great blues shouter BIG MAMA WILLIE MAE THORNTON as
well as providing some good jazz and rollicking humor of their own, 1
nightly at Basin Street West. Stanford students are admitted without
cover charge.
AHMAD JAMAL opened Tuesday at the Jazz Workshop, with
VERNELL FOURNIER back on the drums after a short absence.
The trio is much freer and more exploratory than during their last
S.F. stint at Basin Street West.
The 808 SUA LETT A TRIO performs nightly at El Matador,
where VINCE GUARALDI and BOLA SETE are due on the 14th.
In Sausalito, -ILAN HOFFMAN is at Gatsby's, and BRAZIL 65,
a latin vocal-instrumental group is at the Trident.
The DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET, the C'AL TJADER QUINTET,
and the BUDDY DE FRANCO QUARTET will appear at the Circle j
Star Theater in San Carlos Monday, April 5.
Since Monday night is Oscar night — Hollywood's annual ritual j
of self-congratulation — John Thayer, Foster Hirsch and I have i
decided to make our predictions, buoyed by our 13 for 15 record
on the Oscar nominations. Here are the people we think WILL—
but not necessarily SHOULD—win:
Best film: "31V FAIR LADY."
Rest actor: REX HARRISON.
Best actress: JULIE ANDREWS in a tight win over Kim Stan
ley, Julie will get it as much for excellent work in "The American- j
ization of Emily" and"The Sound of Music" (see review) as for
"Mary Poppins," the film for which she is nominated. Also, Julie's j
noticable absence in big winner "My Fair Lady" will help, as will j
the fact that while she and Hollywood are a mutual admiration so- !
ciety, there is no love lost between Kim Stanley and the film world.
Best supporting actor: STANLEY HOLLOW AY, unless Holly
wood decides, after giving its two top Oscars to Britishers, to get ;
patriotic—in which case it will go to Edmond O'Brien.
Best supporting actress: AGNES MOOREHEAD, although Gladys |
Cooper has an outside chance of swinging in on "My Fair Lady's" :
coattails.
Best director: STANLEY KUBRICK, although George Cukoi ;
might well get it since his "My Fair Lady" did not offend people as j
Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" did. Also, not since 1956 has the director
of the "Best Film" not won.
Best screenplay (adaptation): "MY FAIR LADY," unless Alan
Jay Lerner's screenplay is considered too close to the Broadway
original, in which case it will go to "Dr. Strangelove."
Best screenplay (original): "A HARD DAY'S NIGIIT," a choice
we realize puts us out on a limb, but it's the only film that every
critic we know of liked.
Best song: "< HIM CIIIM CIIEREE."
Best foreign film: "WOMAN IN THE DUNES," although this
Oscar usually goes to the best-known foreign film and therefore ;
might go to "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow."
FILMS
THE SOUND OF MUSIC is at the United Artists in San Fran
cisco (see review on this page).
ZORBA THE GREEK is at the Bridge in San Francisco (see re
view on this page).
THE SUITOR, a wild French farce starring Pierre Et;iix, and a
German color film of FAUST are today's and tomorrow's Tresid-'
der movies.
WHAT A WAY TO GO stars Shirley JXlacLaine as a woman whose
husbands get rich and then die in this movie at the flicks Sunday. 1
MONDO PAZZO. a sensationalist "Mondo Cane" type film, and
the marvelously escapist CARTOUCHE are at the Bijou.
MARY POPPINS is the Walt Disney musical fantasy, starring j
Julie Andrews, still at the Varsity.
PEYTON PLACE and RETURN TO PEYTON PLACE provide a
double dose of small-town sex in the program at: the Park.
SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON is the sensitive psychologi
cal suspense film at the Fine Arts with Ingmar Bergman's Oscar
winner THE VIRGIN SPRING.

critic we know of liked.
Best song: "< HIM CIIIM CIIEREE."

JAZZ (By RICK BALE)
LOUIS JORDAN and a very swinging quintet are backing the
great blues shouter BIG MAMA WILLIE MAE THORNTON as
well as providing some good jazz and rollicking humor of their own, 1
nightly at Basin Street West. Stanford students are admitted without
cover charge.

VERNELL FOURNIER back on the drums after a short absence.
The trio is much freer and more exploratory than during their last
S.F. stint at Basin Street West.
The 808 SUA LETT A TRIO performs nightly at El Matador,
where VINCE GUARALDI and BOLA SETE are due on the 14th.
In Sausalito, -ILAN HOFFMAN is at Gatsby's, and BRAZIL 65,
a latin vocal-instrumental group is at the Trident.
The DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET, the C'AL TJADER QUINTET,

Star Theater in San Carlos Monday, April 5.
Since Monday night is Oscar night — Hollywood's annual ritual j
of self-congratulation — John Thayer, Foster Hirsch and I have i
decided to make our predictions, buoyed by our 13 for 15 record
on the Oscar nominations. Here are the people we think WILL—
but not necessarily SHOULD—win:
Best film: "31V FAIR LADY."
Rest actor: REX HARRISON.
Best actress: JULIE ANDREWS in a tight win over Kim Stan
ley, Julie will get it as much for excellent work in "The American- j
ization of Emily" and"The Sound of Music" (see review) as for
"Mary Poppins," the film for which she is nominated. Also, Julie's j
noticable absence in big winner "My Fair Lady" will help, as will j
the fact that while she and Hollywood are a mutual admiration so- !
ciety, there is no love lost between Kim Stanley and the film world.
Best supporting actor: STANLEY HOLLOW AY, unless Holly
wood decides, after giving its two top Oscars to Britishers, to get ;
patriotic—in which case it will go to Edmond O'Brien.
Best supporting actress: AGNES MOOREHEAD, although Gladys |
Cooper has an outside chance of swinging in on "My Fair Lady's" :
coattails.
Best director: STANLEY KUBRICK, although George Cukoi ;
might well get it since his "My Fair Lady" did not offend people as j
Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" did. Also, not since 1956 has the director
of the "Best Film" not won.
Best screenplay (adaptation): "MY FAIR LADY," unless Alan
Jay Lerner's screenplay is considered too close to the Broadway
original, in which case it will go to "Dr. Strangelove."
Best screenplay (original): "A HARD DAY'S NIGIIT," a choice
we realize puts us out on a limb, but it's the only film that every
critic we know of liked.
Best song: "< HIM CIIIM CIIEREE."
Best foreign film: "WOMAN IN THE DUNES," although this
Oscar usually goes to the best-known foreign film and therefore ;
might go to "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow."
