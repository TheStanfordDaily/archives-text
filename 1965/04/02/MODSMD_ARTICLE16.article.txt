Since Monday night is Oscar night — Hollywood's annual ritual j
of self-congratulation — John Thayer, Foster Hirsch and I have i
decided to make our predictions, buoyed by our 13 for 15 record
on the Oscar nominations. Here are the people we think WILL—
but not necessarily SHOULD—win:
Best film: "31V FAIR LADY."
Rest actor: REX HARRISON.
Best actress: JULIE ANDREWS in a tight win over Kim Stan
ley, Julie will get it as much for excellent work in "The American- j
ization of Emily" and"The Sound of Music" (see review) as for
"Mary Poppins," the film for which she is nominated. Also, Julie's j
noticable absence in big winner "My Fair Lady" will help, as will j
the fact that while she and Hollywood are a mutual admiration so- !
ciety, there is no love lost between Kim Stanley and the film world.
Best supporting actor: STANLEY HOLLOW AY, unless Holly
wood decides, after giving its two top Oscars to Britishers, to get ;
patriotic—in which case it will go to Edmond O'Brien.
Best supporting actress: AGNES MOOREHEAD, although Gladys |
Cooper has an outside chance of swinging in on "My Fair Lady's" :
coattails.
Best director: STANLEY KUBRICK, although George Cukoi ;
might well get it since his "My Fair Lady" did not offend people as j
Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove" did. Also, not since 1956 has the director
of the "Best Film" not won.
Best screenplay (adaptation): "MY FAIR LADY," unless Alan
Jay Lerner's screenplay is considered too close to the Broadway
original, in which case it will go to "Dr. Strangelove."
Best screenplay (original): "A HARD DAY'S NIGIIT," a choice
we realize puts us out on a limb, but it's the only film that every
critic we know of liked.
Best song: "< HIM CIIIM CIIEREE."
Best foreign film: "WOMAN IN THE DUNES," although this
Oscar usually goes to the best-known foreign film and therefore ;
might go to "Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow."
