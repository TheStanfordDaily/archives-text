# STANFORD FAVORED
## Indian Trackmen Meet UCLA 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's undefeated track
team journeys south this week
end, hoping that Ihe momentum
I of their big victory over San Jose
} State last week will carry them
! past UCLA.
The Indians ran away from the
I Bruins here last year, 103-42.
i However, this year UCLA has a

new coach, Jim Bush, who has
managed to corral nine newcom
ers from junior college campuses,
in addition to four standouts from
overseas.
Leading the Uclans is Bob Day,
whose 4:08.9 mile and 8:3.").3 two
mile are the best collegiate times
of the year. The Bruins also have
German Arnd Kruger, with bests
of 1:48.6 and 4:12.4, and New Zea-

lander Geoff Pyne, who has run
a 9:03 2-mile this year.
Against this formidable trio,
Stanford will send Dave Deubner,
with a 1:51.7 half-mile best, and
Paul Schlicke, whose 8:55.1 two
milo two weeks ago stands as the
second-best 19G5 collegiate mark.
DISTANCE RACES GRIM
Although things look grim for
the Tribe in the distance events,
where they have been strongest
recently, Stanford should lose
only one of the remaining races.
That would be the 330-yard hur
dles, where another New Zealand
er, Roger Johnson, has clocked
37.3 seconds.
The Cards will score heavily in
the sprints, led by Larry Que
stad, whose recent 20.7 time in
the 220 is second-best nationally.
He is undefeated in the 100-yard
dash this season, and should beat
UCLA's Len Dodson. If either
Eric Frische or Dale Rubin have
a good day, Stanford could go 1-2
in both sprints and win the 440
relay.
Ken Fraser hasn't lost a 440-
yard race yet this year and will
be favored, although UCLA's Bob
Frey could pull an upset.
The high hurdles is a tossup
between Stanford's Rick Scherer
(14.7) and UCLA's Mike Swain

I (14.8i. The Indians should win
I the mile relay, where their best
j is 3:16.5.
BRUINS YOUNG
On paper, Stanford is favored
in five of seven field events, but
UCLA is loaded with unpredict
able sophomores and juniors who
could come through with their
best efforts. Bruin Steve Lock
appears a cinch winner in the
high jump, and Hermann Spegel
will battle with Stanford's George
Porter in the javelin, where both
have thrown over 220 feet,
i UCLA boasts two 15-foot plus
pole vaulters in Ken House and
Eric Berge. However, last we c k
Stanford's Jim Eshelman and
Chuck Smith both soared 15-6 1 j.
Willi good competition from the
Bruins, either Smith or Eshelman
could top 16 feet.
In the broad jump, three Stan
ford men have better marks than
any Bruin, and John Goode ap
parently has the triple jump to
himself. Bruce Wilhelm and Bob
Stoecker, improving each week,
should place 1-2 in the shot put,
and Stoecker will be favored in
the discus.
With an extremely young team,
UCLA lacks depth. Since Stanford
is two or three men deep in
nearly every event, the Indians
should win by 15 to 20 points. But
this is rush week, which tradi
tionally has impaired track per
formances, and the point margin
could well be smaller.
