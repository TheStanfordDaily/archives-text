### ROSILINE NAVIN 
The English department is eli
minating the graduate compre
hensive examination that is now
taken by all graduate English
students to qualify for the Ph.D I
degree. A qualifying exam to be
taken after the first year of
graduate study is to be substitu
ted.
The new exam, a general test j
in English and American litera
ture, will qualify graduate stu
dents to start specializing in the!
department.
According to graduate English
student Steve Marx, the new

exams represents a totally new
attitude in the English depart
ment. "The new exams imply that
students have enough interest to
pursue their studies without
having to he tested after comple
ting their work. They will be diag
nostic and will determine what
additional general courses should
be taken before a student starts
to specialize," stated Marx.
Only three or four other grad
uate schools in the country, ex
plains Marx, have done away with
t heir e o m pr eh en si v e exams,
"though I expect that others will
in the furture."
Graduate student Tom Sher
man adds, "Doing away with the
comprehensives demo nst rat es
confidence in students, the ex
pression of which is long over
due."
"Until now," explaines Profes
sor George Sensabaugh of the
En g 1 is h department, "students
have specialized in their first few
years and have generalized in
their last year to prepare for the
comprehensive exam. The reason
for eliminating the comprehen
sives is to leave students free to
specialize after the first year
without looking forward to a final
exam."
Ph.D candidates will still take
oral examinations in their special
field and will write a dissertation.
