"Well, Ice often seen a eat without a grin, '
thought Aliee; "but a grin without a cat!
It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all
my life!"
l.ewi,v Carroll
Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
For decades Stanford's student government,
like Alice's übiquitous Cheshire, has looked lor
all the wonderland-world like a disembodied
grin plastered across the void.
Not that student officers necessarik wanted
it that way. They had little choice.
Quite obviously, those who initial!) granted
student self-government tin 1 right to exist never
intended it to be more than a facade—an intri
cate but essentially lifeless arm of the Univer
sity which, with a little care, might be effec
tively operated by remote control to handle some
inevitable administrative and judicial dirty work.
And then, of course, student government gave
the kids a good means of "citizenship train
ing. . . .
Anyhow . . . For a number of years, the
University played Aliee to the ASSUs disem
bodied Cheshire ("The Cat only grinned when
it saw Aliee. It looked good-natured. she
thought. . . .")
And, for a number of years, it took "all the
running we could do to kee}) in the same
place. ..."
And, for a number of years, the rule was,
indeed, "jam to-morrow and jam yesterday—
but never jam to-day."

Until this year. . . .
When the most curious tiling happened:
The grin found the Cat, and the Cheshire ma
terialized—claws first.
"Curiouser and curiouser,' mused Alice.
Can ions, indeed.
Curious that, after all these years, the stu
dent legislature should have the audacity (or
perhaps the naivete) to assume that, since the
Trustees in 1963 "authorized the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University to exercise and dis
charge major privileges and responsibilities, it j
might hew ell to dig up a few major privileges J
and responsibilities to exercise and discharge.
Curious, that LASSU, whose trustee-ap- j
proved Constitution gives it the right "to inter
pret the Fundamental Standard, this Constitu
tion and its By-Laws, should begin to interpret
llit' Fundamental Standard, this Constitution
and its By-Laws.
Curious that the existence oJ a student judi
cial s\stem should be so construed as to mean
that students have the responsibility to judge
their peers and set the rules by which those
judgments are to be made.
Curious that women's social regulations, pur
portedly designed "to give a woman as much!
freedom as practical so that she can develop her
good judgment and social maturity" should be
liberalized so as to actually give a woman that j
practical freedom.
Curious. . . .
es, it is all verv curious indeed.

it saw Aliee. It looked good-natured. she
thought. . . .")

running we could do to kee}) in the same
place. ..."
And, for a number of years, the rule was,
indeed, "jam to-morrow and jam yesterday—
but never jam to-day."

Until this year. . . .
When the most curious tiling happened:
The grin found the Cat, and the Cheshire ma
terialized—claws first.
"Curiouser and curiouser,' mused Alice.
Can ions, indeed.
Curious that, after all these years, the stu
dent legislature should have the audacity (or
perhaps the naivete) to assume that, since the
Trustees in 1963 "authorized the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University to exercise and dis
charge major privileges and responsibilities, it j
might hew ell to dig up a few major privileges J
and responsibilities to exercise and discharge.
Curious, that LASSU, whose trustee-ap- j
proved Constitution gives it the right "to inter
pret the Fundamental Standard, this Constitu
tion and its By-Laws, should begin to interpret
llit' Fundamental Standard, this Constitution
and its By-Laws.
Curious that the existence oJ a student judi
cial s\stem should be so construed as to mean
that students have the responsibility to judge
their peers and set the rules by which those
judgments are to be made.
Curious that women's social regulations, pur
portedly designed "to give a woman as much!
freedom as practical so that she can develop her
good judgment and social maturity" should be
liberalized so as to actually give a woman that j
practical freedom.
Curious. . . .
es, it is all verv curious indeed.

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland
For decades Stanford's student government,
like Alice's übiquitous Cheshire, has looked lor
all the wonderland-world like a disembodied
grin plastered across the void.
Not that student officers necessarik wanted
it that way. They had little choice.
Quite obviously, those who initial!) granted
student self-government tin 1 right to exist never
intended it to be more than a facade—an intri
cate but essentially lifeless arm of the Univer
sity which, with a little care, might be effec
tively operated by remote control to handle some
inevitable administrative and judicial dirty work.
And then, of course, student government gave
the kids a good means of "citizenship train
ing. . . .
