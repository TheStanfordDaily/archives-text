# Letters To The Editor
## Daily Does It Again 
### 
Editor, Th<* Daily:
We are disappointed lo note
that Tiie Daily tailed to promptly
publish a statement submitted to
the Editor personally at 5:30 p.m. i
on March 31 by Professor Dorn
buseh. The proffered statement !
included, 1 believe, the following: I
"Robert Sangster and Sanford 1
Dornbusch, two members uf the!
subcommittee discussing thej
Judicial Competence Bill and>
other issues, stated that many:
early disagreements have been re
solved and that only a few points
of disagreement remain." Profes
sor Dornbusch also transmitted a j
resolution adopted and released
by the Committee on University
Policy, as follows: "Upon hearing
a report of the subcommittee, we
are encouraged by the progress
made and we desire that the dis
cussions co nti n u e."
The failure to promptly publish j
the resolution of the Committee
on University Polity is the second !
such instance within the past j
few weeks. I do not say that The I
Daily is obliged to print every-;
thing that is submitted, but the!
choice of material for acceptance j
and the timing of publication are i
matters of concern to all.
It is important now, as at all :
times, to preserve an atmosphere
of cooperation and mutual respect
among students, faculty, and ad
ministration. The statements
submitted by Professor Dorn-1
busch would contribute to such !
an atmosphere. They indicate
progress in a collective attempt j
to resolve some problems affect-1
ing the entire University commu
nity. It seems to rne that this
side of the picture would be of
interest to many of your readers. !

EDITOR'S NOTE: The Daily
once again profoundly regrets
the entirely unintentional over
sight whie.li resulted in our out
mission of the COUP resolution
from yesterday's edition.
• Dangerously Safe
Editor, The Daily:
I read in The Daily that cita-1
tions are now being given to j
bikers who fail to "stop at stop j
signs." I may be depersonalized
but 1 am also shy and humble. I j
do not want a citation for any-;
thing. Consequently:
Yesterday I stopped at a stop
sign. The following events took
place in rapid succession: an as
tonished motorist rammed me
from behind, an equally surprised
motorscooter plowed into my
right side, I dropped my Rocks
I text and a gawking pedestrian
kicked it into the sewer. As the I
three of them commenced to pum
mel me about the head and shoul- \
ders, a question came to my mind. J
Is the world ready for our bold,
new rule? PETE BROWN

• HUAC vs. kKK
Editor, The Daily:
William Buckley's recent article
in The Daily (March 29) com
ments on the "inconsistency" of
liberals. He suggests thai "Lib
erals Propose KKK Investiga
tion" (headline) and that Con
gressman Weltner is now an
"overnight darling in liberal quar
ters'' since ho "proposed (sic)
that the House Committee on
Un-American Activities investi
gate the Ku Klux Klan." Mr.
Buckley goes on to describe the
activities of the KKK. the HUAC,
and concludes his column with
some comment regarding such an
investigation.
I am forced to hesitate when
ever Mr. Buckley t.ikes a mo
ment to explain the liberal point
of view. When he chooses to
speak on behalf oi the entire lib
era! community in their pre
sumed support of the HIiAC in
vestigation of the KKK, I am
reassured (once again) that he
knows not whereof he speaks.
Surely, I am not qualified to
speak for these ' liberal quarters."
Perhaps the American Civil Liber
ties Union could do a better job,
but even they have an acknowl
edged wide spectrum of variation
of liberal opinion. It is not unfair
nevertheless, to concede their
broad based liberal support as a
first approximation to a "liberal
point of view."
The March, 1965, issue of the
ACI.r News comments at some
length on the proposed investiga
tion. Under a headline which
reads "Oppose HUAC Investiga
tion of Ku Klux Klan" an article
summarizes ACLU views. It
points out that KKK "activities
fall into the category of violation
of criminal law, which the Depart
ment of Justice has the clear au
thority to investigate and prose
cute ... It (the HUAC) has no
authority to involve itself in this
area." The statement goes on to
say that "a full investigation by
the HUAC ... is bound to pro
duce the same kind of exposure
for exposure's sake which does
serious harm to freedom of
speech and association in our
country." The statement says fur
ther ". . . it would be easy for us,
as it is for some others, to cheer
the HUAC's proposed investiga
tion. But the vitality of the demo
cratic institutions we defend lies
in their equal application to all."
1 hope that this can clarify the
issues a bit. Most liberals (alas)
would like to speak for them
selves. But in a time of crisis 1
don't think we'd elect Mr. Buck
ley as our spokesman. He is too
often wrong.

The failure to promptly publish j

• HUAC vs. kKK
Editor, The Daily:
William Buckley's recent article
in The Daily (March 29) com
ments on the "inconsistency" of
liberals. He suggests thai "Lib
erals Propose KKK Investiga
tion" (headline) and that Con
gressman Weltner is now an
"overnight darling in liberal quar
ters'' since ho "proposed (sic)
that the House Committee on
Un-American Activities investi
gate the Ku Klux Klan." Mr.
Buckley goes on to describe the
activities of the KKK. the HUAC,
and concludes his column with
some comment regarding such an
investigation.
I am forced to hesitate when
ever Mr. Buckley t.ikes a mo
ment to explain the liberal point
of view. When he chooses to
speak on behalf oi the entire lib
era! community in their pre
sumed support of the HIiAC in
vestigation of the KKK, I am
reassured (once again) that he
knows not whereof he speaks.
Surely, I am not qualified to
speak for these ' liberal quarters."
Perhaps the American Civil Liber
ties Union could do a better job,
but even they have an acknowl
edged wide spectrum of variation
of liberal opinion. It is not unfair
nevertheless, to concede their
broad based liberal support as a
first approximation to a "liberal
point of view."
The March, 1965, issue of the
ACI.r News comments at some
length on the proposed investiga
tion. Under a headline which
reads "Oppose HUAC Investiga
tion of Ku Klux Klan" an article
summarizes ACLU views. It
points out that KKK "activities
fall into the category of violation
of criminal law, which the Depart
ment of Justice has the clear au
thority to investigate and prose
cute ... It (the HUAC) has no
authority to involve itself in this
area." The statement goes on to
say that "a full investigation by

sumed support of the HIiAC in
vestigation of the KKK, I am
reassured (once again) that he
knows not whereof he speaks.
Surely, I am not qualified to
speak for these ' liberal quarters."
Perhaps the American Civil Liber
ties Union could do a better job,
but even they have an acknowl
edged wide spectrum of variation
of liberal opinion. It is not unfair
nevertheless, to concede their
broad based liberal support as a
first approximation to a "liberal
point of view."
The March, 1965, issue of the
ACI.r News comments at some
length on the proposed investiga
tion. Under a headline which
reads "Oppose HUAC Investiga
tion of Ku Klux Klan" an article
summarizes ACLU views. It
points out that KKK "activities
fall into the category of violation
of criminal law, which the Depart
ment of Justice has the clear au
thority to investigate and prose
cute ... It (the HUAC) has no
authority to involve itself in this
area." The statement goes on to
say that "a full investigation by
the HUAC ... is bound to pro
duce the same kind of exposure
for exposure's sake which does
serious harm to freedom of
speech and association in our
country." The statement says fur
ther ". . . it would be easy for us,
as it is for some others, to cheer
the HUAC's proposed investiga
tion. But the vitality of the demo
cratic institutions we defend lies
in their equal application to all."
1 hope that this can clarify the
issues a bit. Most liberals (alas)
would like to speak for them
selves. But in a time of crisis 1
don't think we'd elect Mr. Buck
ley as our spokesman. He is too
often wrong.

Editor, Th<* Daily:
We are disappointed lo note
that Tiie Daily tailed to promptly
publish a statement submitted to
the Editor personally at 5:30 p.m. i
on March 31 by Professor Dorn
buseh. The proffered statement !
included, 1 believe, the following: I
"Robert Sangster and Sanford 1
Dornbusch, two members uf the!
subcommittee discussing thej
Judicial Competence Bill and>
other issues, stated that many:
early disagreements have been re
solved and that only a few points
of disagreement remain." Profes
sor Dornbusch also transmitted a j
resolution adopted and released
by the Committee on University
Policy, as follows: "Upon hearing
a report of the subcommittee, we
are encouraged by the progress
made and we desire that the dis
cussions co nti n u e."
The failure to promptly publish j
the resolution of the Committee
on University Polity is the second !
such instance within the past j
few weeks. I do not say that The I
Daily is obliged to print every-;
thing that is submitted, but the!
choice of material for acceptance j
and the timing of publication are i
matters of concern to all.
It is important now, as at all :
times, to preserve an atmosphere
of cooperation and mutual respect
among students, faculty, and ad
ministration. The statements
submitted by Professor Dorn-1
busch would contribute to such !
an atmosphere. They indicate
progress in a collective attempt j
to resolve some problems affect-1
ing the entire University commu
nity. It seems to rne that this
side of the picture would be of
interest to many of your readers. !

• Dangerously Safe
Editor, The Daily:
I read in The Daily that cita-1
tions are now being given to j
bikers who fail to "stop at stop j
signs." I may be depersonalized
but 1 am also shy and humble. I j
do not want a citation for any-;
thing. Consequently:
Yesterday I stopped at a stop
sign. The following events took
place in rapid succession: an as
tonished motorist rammed me
from behind, an equally surprised
motorscooter plowed into my
right side, I dropped my Rocks
I text and a gawking pedestrian
kicked it into the sewer. As the I
three of them commenced to pum
mel me about the head and shoul- \
ders, a question came to my mind. J
Is the world ready for our bold,
new rule? PETE BROWN

• HUAC vs. kKK
Editor, The Daily:
William Buckley's recent article
in The Daily (March 29) com
ments on the "inconsistency" of
liberals. He suggests thai "Lib
erals Propose KKK Investiga
tion" (headline) and that Con
gressman Weltner is now an
"overnight darling in liberal quar
ters'' since ho "proposed (sic)
that the House Committee on
Un-American Activities investi
gate the Ku Klux Klan." Mr.
Buckley goes on to describe the
activities of the KKK. the HUAC,
and concludes his column with
some comment regarding such an
investigation.
I am forced to hesitate when
ever Mr. Buckley t.ikes a mo
ment to explain the liberal point
of view. When he chooses to
speak on behalf oi the entire lib
era! community in their pre
sumed support of the HIiAC in
vestigation of the KKK, I am
reassured (once again) that he
knows not whereof he speaks.
Surely, I am not qualified to
