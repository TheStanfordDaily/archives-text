# JFK's Stay At The Farm
## 
### DOUGLAS HALL 
John F. Kennedy and Harvard are so
nearly synonymous that his period at
Stanford has been overshadowed. Yet.
his brief four months as a graduate stu
dent here were decisive in the formation
of his political ideology.
"Why Stanford?" Kennedy was asked
by the Stanford Daily when he arrived.
"I picked Stanford principally because
of your ex-Student Body President and
Student Manager, Tom Killefer. He was
rny brother's roommate si Harvard, and
he sncred so at the Florida climate when
he was staying with us there, that I
had to find out if il was really the cli
mate or .just Killefer.'' Kennedy smiled,
"So far lie's right, but just wait till I
see that first cloud. . .
At Stanford Kennedy obtained a "Per
mit to Attend," which granted auditiing
privileges only, but left him free to audit
any class he chose. His major at Har
vard had been political science, and with
his auditing freedom Kennedy now gravi
tated in that direction.
First Impression
But Kennedy didn't make as strong a
first impression on his classmates. One
of the classes Kennedy audited was two
hours long, and there was a fifteen-min
ute break when the students usually sat
on the lawn and chatted in the warm
California fall. One, David Cuthbertson,
noticed that Kennedy usually stood away
from any group and remained by him
self. Cuthbertson tried to approach him.
"Ho impressed me as being rather shy,
reserved, somewhat aloof and yet not
stuffy or conceited." Some of the other
students never even knew Jack Ken
nedy's name.
This was strange because the shy
young graduate auditor became a minor
campus celebrity. Jack Kennedy had
spent the summer before coming to
Stanford converting his Harvard honors
thesis into a book titled "Why England
Slept." Now while Kennedy was at Stan
ford, it became a best seller.
The Daily interviewer the promising
young author of "Why England Slept,"
and smugly reported, "Stanford he likes
unequivocally and the football team
included." Stanford in 1940 was ex
tremely proud of an undefeated foot
ball team well on its way to the Rose
Bowl. "You have no idea how it feels to
yell for a winning team!" Kennedy ob
ligingly exclaimed. Harvard hadn't been
doing very well the last few years.
Reaction To Germany
But football did not remain Kennedy's
most absorbing interest that fall of
1940. War was growing around America.
On October 1(> a headline in The Daily
read, "Japanese, Axis Hail Treaty." One
day later, Jack Kennedy in white shirt
and tie registered for "America's first
peacetime conscription."
The War had already enfolded Jack
Kennedy's father. Ambassador Joseph

Kennedy, in London. B1 i (/. bombs
knocked his car onto I lie sidewalk and
rattled the Embassy. Al Stanford, Jack
Kennedy said proudly, "I understand
they're calling Dad 'America's Most
Bombed Ambassador' now. That's a
helluva title isn't it?"
On November 9 the Most Bombed Am
bassador told America that he would do
everything ho could to keep us out of a
war "that is not our war." Joseph Ken
nedy said, "If the United States sets
into it with England, we'll be left holding
the bag." This stand made the Ameri
can Ambassador one of the most un
popular men in Great Britain and
created a dilemma for his son at Stan
ford.
Disagreement With Father
"Young Kennedy was in the middle
of the problem since he had written that
honors thesis at Harvard," recalls Theo
dore Krcps, one of his Stanford profes
sors. In "Why England Slept" Ken
nedy had written, "The hatred of
war is in this day of modern warfare,
a great disadvantage. . . . There must

be no doubt in anyone's mind, the deci
sion must be automatic: if we debate, if
we hestiate, if we question, it. will be
too late."
At. this time Kennedy became a fre
quent guest at the Kreps* Sunday eve
ning "At Homes." He liked to sit on the
rug with his back up against the baby
grand piano, eating a piece of Mrs.
Kreps' specialty, lazy-daisy cake. From
this position he would discuss the ques
tion of America's entrance into the
War; the controversy perplexed and
totally absorbed him. "His grades would
not have been as good as some of the
othersâ€”he was interested in this otic
thing only," says Kreps.
"He opposed his father," Kreps con
tinues. "There was nothing personal and
no family differences just this differ
ence of ideas. His father was not a paci
fist; both believed in arming. It was not
a question of arming, it was what we
were aiming for. Jack thought we would
have to commit ourselves. He thought
it might take years, biy. that it woidd
come. I'd say he was a little more far
seeing than his father in this matter."


Jack Kennedy registers for "America's
first peacetime conscription" while at
Stanford in 1940. His number, 2748,
was the eighteenth drawn, and Ken-

nedy became one of 22 Stanford stu
dents among the first prospective draf
tees.
