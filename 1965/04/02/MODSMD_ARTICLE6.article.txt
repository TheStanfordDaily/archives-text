# ABRAMS ON WORDSWORTH
## 'Prelude' Foreshadows Modern Novel 
### CHRISTINE COOK JOE JACOBS 
Author Howard Abrams, speak
ing on "From Wordsworth to
Proust; The Tradition of 1 he
Portrait of the Artist" at Tresid
der Wednesday said that Words

worth "introduced a new element
into the literary universe" in his
poem "Prelude."
Abrams explained how this
"spiritual autobiography in verse"
foreshadowed two developments
in the novel just emerging at that

time: the development of a mind
(Bildungsroman t and the devel
opment of an artist (Kinstlero
man).
He said that "Prelude" dealt
with four themes used by great
modern novelists: ihe genesis of a

novel (or any work of art), the
problem of time and memory, the
importance of the seemingly triv
ial and the function of the epi
phany, which has been called ( lie
"felicity of an ineffable vision."
the conversion to the religion of
art and a revelation of the ar
tist's vocation and his life as a
preparation for that vocation.
Abrams staled that the .similari
ties between Joyce, Proust and
Wordsworth "are the resull of a
hundred-year Christian tradition
of religious confessional writing,"
of which the ultimate source was
the Confessions of St. Augustine.
Thus, said Abrams, in the sense
that Augustine used all of these
themes, Augustine could be con
sidered the first modern writer.
He emphasized, however, that
"Prelude" marked a departure
from the Augustinian concept of
God, nature and the human soul
to a new tradition of "men as
natural beings in the strength of
nature."
This approach diminished the
role of the traditional God, since
mind and nature interacted in the
universe, thus explaining Ihe
history of the universe and de
veloping the individual mind.
In concluding, Abrams said
that Wordsworth hand wanted
I his new element in Hie universe
which he had introduced to be "a
light hung up in cheer mankind
