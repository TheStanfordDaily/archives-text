## 
### DANIEL SCHWARTZ 
A sped a I Senior Colloquium and a series of
"Sunday Seminars" have been formed by the
Stanford-in-Washington Committee to inform
prospective Washington interns of the workings
and life of Washington polities.
Jay Kittle, Chairman of the Stanford-in-Wash
ington Committee, has also announced that the
S-I-W Program has formally affiliated with the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Education.
Kittle stressed that such an affiliation would add
to the continuity of the program from year to
year.
He added that Dr. Robert Wert, the Dean ol
Undergraduate Education, would appoint an ad
visory board of faculty, administrators and stu
dents, "to advise the Stanford-in Washington
group on the conduct of its program, and to ad
vise the Dean of Undergraduate Education on
action which should be taken by the University in
support of the program."
Kittle also pointed out that funds coming t<>
the program could now be given directlv t<Â» the

University, and would thus be tax-deductible.
S-I-W would continue to manage its own affairs,
hp said, making use of assistance from the Alumni
Association, the Development Office and Dean
Wert's Office.
The Colloquium and the special seminars, Kit
tle said, arc part of a "three pronged approach to
minimize the possibility of having interns arrive
in Washington with distorted ideas about what
the federal government is and what their place in
it for the summer would be."
The third "prong," he outlined, involved the
S-I-W Committee advising prospective interns to
enroll in a course on "Legislative Behavior" taught
by Professor Martin Shapiro in the Political
Science Department.
The "Sunday Seminars," to be held on five dif
ferent Sundays this quarter in Tresidder, will be
discussions with a number of Stanford professors
and others. They will attempt to give both a de
tailed description of the government, and "an in
gredient of practical adv ice for working effectively
in Washington " l-'iltle said.
