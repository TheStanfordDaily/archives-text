# Social Regs Approved; Cal Students Supported
## Judicial Bill Implementation Postponed 
### 
The Legislature, in one ot its
busiest meetings of the year,
voted unanimously to imple
ment new soeial regulations on
April 16.
Also, with some dissent, it voted
to postpone the implementation
of the Judicial Competence Bill
for one week, encouraging con
tinued discussion between faculty,
administrators and students on
the bill.
In another major action it ap
proved, with five dissenting votes,
a resolution supporting the at
tempts of the Associated Students
of the University of California to
seat graduate students in the Cal
student Senate.
Judicial Bill Report
Af'.2r the report of the five stu
dents who have been meeting
with the Committee on University
Policy (COUP), the Legislature
authorized a statement saying
that the one week postponement
was made "in recognition of the
desire of COUP that further dis
cussions might occur."
Previous to the LASSU meet
ing, COUP issued a resolution
stating that the committee was
"encouraged by the progress
made" and desires "that the dis
cussions continue."
It added, "The Legislature joins
COUP in an expression that these
meetings be continued."
The bill of postponement in
eluded a clause asserting th a t
LASSU still maintains its belief
in the philosophy that motivated
the original Judicial Bill.
Postponement of the controver
sial section of the Judicial Bill,
Which temporarily went into ef
fect yesterday, came about as a
result of a closed-door report to
Legislature by the five students
who have been meeting for the
past three weeks with COUP in
an effort to reach a compromise
acceptable to both sides.
Social Regulations
The new social regulations call
for unlimited 7 to 9 a.m. late
leaves and unlimited overnights
for junior and senior women.
Freshman and sophomore women
shall have a graduated number
of 2:30 laic leaves, and one mid
week overnight per week.
The Berkeley Resolution which
will be sent to Edward Carter,
chairman of the Board of Re
gents, Cal President Clark Kerr,
Chancellor Martin Meyerson, and
ASUC President Charles Powell
stated in part. "We view wit h
alarm any action which would vio
late the integrity of vote taken
by the student community and
we deplore the possibility that the
admission of graduate students
to the ASUC might precipitate the
dissolution of student govern
ment on the Berkeley campus."
Some members of the Legisla
ture protested that the resolution
was a statement involving an off
campus issue, which is forbidden
by the Board of Trustees.
However it was pointed out
that the ban on off-campus issues
is not official ASSU policy, but
merely a statement by the Board
of Trustees, and therefore has no
effect in the Legislature.
