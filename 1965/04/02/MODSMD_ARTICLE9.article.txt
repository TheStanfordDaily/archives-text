IS EUROPE?
College life is such a busy one, what with learning the Maxixe,
attending public execut ions, and walking our cheetahs, that per
force we 112 ind ourselves somet inies neglecting our studies. There
fore this column, normally a vehicle for innocent tomfoolery,
will occasionally forego levity to ofl'cr a quirk survey course in
one of the learned disciplines. Today, for an opener, we will dis
cuss Modern European History.
strictly defined, Modern 1 iuropean History covers the history
of Europe from January 1, 1964, to the present. However, in
order to provide employment for more teachers, the course has
been moved back to the Age of Pericles, or the Renaissance, as
it. is better known as.
The single most important fact to remember about Modern
European History is the emergence of Prussia. As we all know,
Prussia was originally called Russia. The "P" was purchased
from Persia in 1574 for $24 and Manhattan Island. This later
became known as Guy Fawkes Day.
Persia without a "P" was of course called Ersia. This so em
barrassed the natives that they changed the name of the
country to Iran. This led to a rash of name changing. Mesopo
tamia became Iraq, Schleswig-Holstein became Saxe-Coburg,
Bosnia-Herzegovina became Cleveland. There was even talk
about changing the name of stable old England, but it was for
gotten when the little princes escaped from the Tower and in
vented James Watt. This later became known as the Missouri
Compromise.

Meanwhile Johann Gutenberg was quietly inventing the print
ing press, for which we may all be grateful, believe you me. Why
grateful? I'll tell you why: Because without Gutenberg's inven
tion you would not have this newspaper to read and you might
never learn that Personna Stainless Steel Razor Blades are now
available in two varieties —the regular double-edge blade we
have all come to know and love, and the new Personna Injector
Blade. Users of injector razors have grown morose in recent
years, even sullen, and who can blame them? How would you
feel if you were denied the speed and comfort and durability and
1 ruth and beauty of Personna Stainless Steel shaving? Not very
jolly, I'll wager! But injector shavers may now rejoice—indeed
all shavers may —for whether you remove your whiskers reg
ularly or injectorly, there is a Personna blade for you—a Per
sonna Stainless Steel Blade which will give you more luxury
shaves than Beep-Beep or any other brand you might name. If
by chance you don't agree, the makers of Personna will gladly
buy you a pack of any brand you think is better.
Yes, iriends, we may all be grateful to Johann Gutenberg for
inventing the means to spread this great news about Personna.
The next time j'ou're in Frankfurt-am-Main, why don't you
drop in and say thanks to Mr. Gutenberg? lie is elderly—4oB
years last birthday—but st ill quite active in his laboratory. Only
l.ist week lie invented the German short-haired pointer.
But 1 digress. Returning to Modern European History, let
us now examine that ever-popular favorite, France.
France, as we all know, is divided imo several Departments.
There is the Police Department, the Fire Department, tlie Gas
and Water Department, and the Bureau of Weights and Meas
ures. There is also Madame Pompadour, but 1 hat is a dirty story
and is taught only to graduate students.
Finally we take up Italy —the newest European nation. Italy
did not become a unified state until 1848 when Garibaldi, Cavour,
and Victor Emmanuel threw three coins in the Trevi Fountain.
This lovely gesture so enchanted all of Europe that Metternich
traded Parma to Talleyrand for Mad Ludwig of Bavaria. Then
everybody waltzed till dawn and then, tired but happy, they
started the Thirty Years War. This later became known as Pitt
the Younger.
Space does not permit me to tell you any more about Modern
European History. Aren't you glad?
