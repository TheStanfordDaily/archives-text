• U.S. Met liy IS. Viet MIGs
SAIGON, South Viet Nam — Communist
jet fighters, ideniified as Soviet-built MlGlos
and 17s of Korean War vintage, pounced out
of a haze and shot down two U.S. Air Force
supersonic FlO5 fighter-bombers yesterday.
The FlO5 were part of a 60-plane attack
on a strategic bridge 65 miles south of the
North Vietnamese capital of Hanoi. The Red
jets escaped unscarthed.
A number of other aircraft were brought
down by heavy and accurate groundfire, U.S.
officials in Saigon reported. They declined to
give the number because rescue operations
were under way.

Vietnamese claimed 37 enemy planes were
downed in three separate U.S.-South Vietna
mese air attacks on the north. The dispatch
made no mention of the MIGs.

• Last Blocks West Germans
BERLIN — Communist East Germany last
night barred West German legislators from
crossing by land to West Berlin for a parlia
mentary meeting Wednesday.
The West Germans promptly declared the
meetingw ill be held despite all Communist
threats, and called a Cabinet meeting to be
held in Berlin on the same day.
In a growing test of wills over the first
Bundestag—lower house meetingi n West
Berlin in seven years, the Communists earlier
in the day turned back West Berlin's Mayor

Willy Brandt at an East German bolder cross
ing.
Brandt, leader of West Germany's opposi
tion Socialists, flew home lated from Ham
burg. The West German deputies not yet in
Berlin presumably also will take planes to
attend the parliamentary meeting Wednes
day.
The Soviet government and the East Ger
mans have warned in notes to the Western
powers that the session could lead to serious
int orn ational comp 1 ications.
There was no immediate comment from
the Western Allies — the United States, Brit
tain and France — on the East German ban.
The three powers had agreed with West Ger
many in authorizing the meeting.

• Hi AC Head Cites KKK Violence
WASHINGTON — Chairman Edwin E.
Willis, D.-La., said yesterday the House Com
mittee on Un-American Activities is turning
up evidence of systematic planning of violence
in some Klan organizations.
"Within different klaverns and lodges you
havea ction groups who lead these acts of vio
lence — intimidations and threats," he said.
Willis noted, however that many members
of such klaverns disavow any knowledge of
such activities. He suggested it may be the
planning for violence is limited only to some
parts of some Klan groups.
Willis, whose committee is launching an
investigation of the Klan — called by Presi
dent Johnson "a hooded society of bigots" —
said volunteered information is pouring into
the committee.
Some of it, he said, is in the form of letters

from businessmen offering to cooperate b>
telling of their experiences with Klan threats

LOS ANGELES — "I've got arthritis," said
Sandy Koufax. "When will 112 pitch? There's
no way for me to know."
That's how the 29-year-old southpaw hurl

When will he rejoin his Los Angeles Dodg

"I just don't know,"he replied.
