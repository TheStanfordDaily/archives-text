# Card Lacrosse Squad Clubbed By San Marino
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Lacking experience while play
ing a team that lacked lit lie of
anything, Stanford's lacrosse
team lost to San Marino College
Saturday 10-4 in a very unimpres
sive showing.
San Marino, playing with sev
eral All-Americans and with a
month of practice and several
games behind them, dominated
the entire game. Stanford's coach
Howie Taylor, however, stated
that he felt ihe Indians played a
much better game in the second
half and is confident that their
performances will improve as
more experience is gained. Stan
ford has had only two practices
since spring break.
The first score of the contest
came after about lon minutes of
action by San Marino and much
sloppy play by Stanford. After
another score by San Marino on
a beautiful shot from thirty feet
out, Stanford scored its first goal j
but the game always looked hope-1
less for the Indians.
At: Ihe quarter San Marino lead |
r>-2 and showed brillance on sev- j
oral offensive maneuvers. Several
San Marino shots were wide but
nonetheless they showed their
offensive dominance over the hap
less Indians.
Stanford was even unable to
score when San Marino had one
player sitiing in the penalty box.
Bad passing and lack of team
work contributed much to Stan
ford's inability to score.
Bob Murphy and Parker Llewel
lyn showed promise of things 1o
come. With mostly sophomores
and freshmen on the squad, these
two performers will have to carry
the load until more experience can
be gained by the more novice
players.
