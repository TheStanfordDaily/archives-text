## Roundup of Rumors and Rumblings 
### Justin Beck 
Once again it is time to toss
out a few of the rumors, fears,
and insanities that generally ob
scure things around the campus.
Unlike good five cent cigars or
Deans of Women, rumors abound
here, and these are the choicest
of the current crop.
Students suspicious of the Ad
ministration's use of medical
leaves of absence point to this re
cent incident: Mrs. Louis Gregg,
the Lag Dorm Director, suggested
to one student who had made her
self persona non grata to the Ad
ministration that she take a medi
cal leave. Said the administrator,
"You won't have any trouble get
ting one; just go and see Dr.
." The student, however, de
clined. Supposedly tlie Adminis
tration lias tried in the past to
get health service cooperation in
removing students charged with
moral offenses.
KEEPING UP WITH THE
JONESES: Rumor has it that one
fraternity hired a stripper for
one of their rush parties last
week. Not to lie outdone another'
frat group hired the same strip- i
per for the next night, and topped j
the evening off by showing, their
collection of obscene movies to J
the rushees. Nothing like show-1
ing the frosh a well-balanced so
cial life.
Is it true that President Ster
ling personally nixed a faculty
plan to have Stanford run Ra
venswood High School. Sup
posedly Sterling feels, on the
basis of a southern trip many
years ago, that self-help is the
only solution to Negro problems.
Fraternities and sex are getting
to be a rather boring subject i
around here, but rumor has it i
that one fraternity found a new
angle during their "hell week" or
"work week" as President Ster
ling calls it in the IFC Rush
Handbook. The pledges had to
have a treasure hunt which in
cluded finding a prostitute and
bring her back to the house.

Are demonstrations permitted
at the Stanford Shopping Center?
When the recent San Jose to San
Francisco march tried to go
through the Stanford owned cen
ter, a cop blocked, the way, cit
ing a University policy against it.
Now the business office says it's
O.K.—just check with them first.
A Quota System
Insiders say that the Board of
Trustees' Democrat, Judge Duni
wa.v of San Francisco, was se
lected because President Sterling
figured that an all-Republican
Board made it. difficult to lobby
among Democratic Congressmen.
Who says that Stanford doesn't
practice a quota system?
The Winds of Freedom seem
to be blowing toward a change in
liquor policy. One sign: Dean of
Men Bob Gordon recently sug
gested the possibility of campus
liquor lockers for students, just
like the ones being installed in
the "dry" faculty club.
Is there any truth to rumors
of FBI warnings of Commies in
! college youth movements? Fred
| Glover, Assistant to the President,
j says that Stanford gets lots of
I warnings from right wingers, but
j that no one in the office remem
j bered getting one from FBI chief
J. Edgar Hoover.
Nobody Knows
Behind Closed Doors Depart
ment: What went on at the meet
ing last quarter between
Dean Fitzwater, AWS President
Chana Chiba, Social Regs Chair
man Carol Swanson, and the two
house presidents known to op
pose the new social regs? No
body knows, but you can bet that
they didn't talk about the weather.
INSIDE INNER QUAD . . . Ru
mor has it that President Sterling
gets to pick thirty members of
each freshman class, no matter
what the Admissions Office says.
If so does Sterling consider bank
rolls before grades in filling those
thirty spots?

What happened to Dean Cor
don's "top drawer" rush commit
tee of last quarter? Seems like
it's still in the top drawer, folks.
Pressure from Above
One popular professor in th e
Classics Department is on the
verge of leaving, students close
to him say. They blame pressure
from the higher ups in the depart
ment.
Words to remember depart
ment — Dean Gordon on the
ASSU Constitution: "You can
take that Constitution and a
dime and just about buy yourself
a cup of coffee."
The development office is pay
ing close attention to student pro
tests since it came out that con
tributions to Cal plunged after
problems there. Several showed
up at a LASSU meeting and came
to the conclusion that "the stu
dents are restless."
A former student close to the
GCC is doing a study of the Board
of Trustees similar to the one
done on the Regents by FSM'ers
at Cal. That one disclosed possible
tie-ups between Regents' private
business and Cal investments.
Ahead of Schedule
It could be that the Board of
Trustees are already checking for
a new President. Informed
sources say that Sterling may be
close to retirement, several years
ahead of schedule.
Would-be authors on campus
are taking note of the fate of Dar
rell Halverson, co-author of the
Crow-Halverson report. Halver
son is now in Tahiti, on a Univer
sity sponsored research project.
It seems to be a case of feeding
the hand that bites you.
It could very well be that pro
posals to eliminate the Dean of
Women's office are being seri
ously considered. In addition cur
rent talk is that Dean Winbigler
will be moved up, replaced by
Gordon. That would end both
the Deans of Men and Women.
How much chance is there for
liberal social regs? Insiders figure
prospects are good that Student
Affairs and Services and Dean
Wert both figure to back them.
The only possible opposition
opposition might come from Ster
ling himself and the Board,
neither, of course, noted for their
interest in liberalizing student
regs.
One student wanted Dean Allen
to tackle a faculty member who
had served liquor to minors. She
refused "The faculty is too
strong," she said, with remark
able foresight.
