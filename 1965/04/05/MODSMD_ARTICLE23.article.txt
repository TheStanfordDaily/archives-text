## Silent Spring in Village 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
There will be a silent spring in
most of Escondido Village this
year, due to a nest-egg-baby bird
extermination program. Mainten
ance men have been taking down
the nests of eggs and featherlcss
squeeking birds, and have been
throwing these in trash cans
(They say they didn't particularly
want to, but were only following
"orders." They delegated their
personal responsibility to a high
er authority.)
In this case the higher author
ity is Escondido Village adminis
tration. The "take down the nests"
program was initiated because of
several phone calls complaining
of the "mess" the birds were
making. We have several nests
in the roof of our building and
no mess in sight. Yet Escondido
Village authorities decided to re
move all the nests, wanted or not.
They acted, I feel, without much
reflection or moral decision, hast
ily seeking to pacify a few bitter
persons without consulting the
village council or the bulk of vil
lage residents, (who never im
agined such a program could he
initiated).
Many of us have children, who
have joyfully watched the nests
being built and the baby birds
being fed. What shall we tell them
now?
I, along with several of my
friends, called the office and
asked them to stop this cruel and
senseless extermination, and they
finally did. But de-nesting had
been going on several days and
the greater part of the village is
now filled with empty cornices
and searching parent birds.
The village policy on bird nests
is now this. Those desiring nests
on their apartment roofs removed
have only to call Escondido main
tenance; and the maintenance
crews, paid by rent money from
all Escondido residents, bird-lover
and hater alike, will carry out
the demolition work. Escondido
Village does not wash our win
dows, and I do not think it should
remove our birds. If there be an
individual who dislikes these little
creatures so much, let him take
the dirty work into his own hands.
Let there be no more mass-exter
mination, nor, hopefully, any in
dividual who would seek to de
stroy a beautiful part of spring
and of life.

Editor, The Daily:
Hooray for Eleanor Willemsen!
Her March 30 Daily letter places
the recent Dean of Women "prob
lems" in true perspective. In case
her qualifications for extension of
her thesis to Deans of Men is
challenged, I offer this support.
In nine years at three colleges/
universities I never perceived, or
heard anyone adequately explain,
how the Dean of Men's existence
did or could affect my life in any
way. Perhaps The Daily could

• Berkeley Resolution
Last Thursday the Legislature
voted on a resolution concerned
with the current situation on the
Berkeley campus. As a member
of the Legislature I am appalled
by the rationale attributed to the
majority's vote by the last para
graph in Friday's lead article.
This paragraph implied 1> that
the Berkeley resolution was con
sidered by the majority to be a
violation of Trustee policy and
21 that the majority circumvented
this policy by asserting that
the Legislature is not subject to
Trustee rulings.
This assertion posits ;i seem
ingly absurd relationship between
the Legislature and the Board
of Trustees. That the majority
subscribed to this assertion is, it
seems to me, an improbable and
unjustified conclusion. As to the
resolution itself, it was my un
derstanding ai Thursday's meet
ing that the present situation at
Berkeley is sufficiently pertinent
to student affairs on the Stanford
campus to fall within the scope
of student government action un
der prevailing policies of the
Board of Trustees. If this is not
a reasonable understanding I
fully expect that the Board of
Trustees or the Administration
will so indicate, or would so have
indicated last fall when the Legis
lature passed another resolution
on the Berkeley situation.
In any case, as a member of
Legislature I certainly did not
vote on Thursday's Berkeley reso
lution for the ridiculous reason
implied in Friday's Daily, namely,
that statements of the Board of
Trustees are not relevant to ac
tions of Legislature.

and searching parent birds.
The village policy on bird nests
is now this. Those desiring nests
on their apartment roofs removed
have only to call Escondido main
tenance; and the maintenance
crews, paid by rent money from
all Escondido residents, bird-lover

the demolition work. Escondido
Village does not wash our win

remove our birds. If there be an

• Berkeley Resolution
Last Thursday the Legislature
voted on a resolution concerned
with the current situation on the
Berkeley campus. As a member
of the Legislature I am appalled
by the rationale attributed to the
majority's vote by the last para
graph in Friday's lead article.
This paragraph implied 1> that
the Berkeley resolution was con
sidered by the majority to be a
violation of Trustee policy and
21 that the majority circumvented
this policy by asserting that
the Legislature is not subject to
Trustee rulings.
This assertion posits ;i seem
ingly absurd relationship between
the Legislature and the Board
of Trustees. That the majority
subscribed to this assertion is, it
seems to me, an improbable and
unjustified conclusion. As to the
resolution itself, it was my un
derstanding ai Thursday's meet
ing that the present situation at
Berkeley is sufficiently pertinent
to student affairs on the Stanford
campus to fall within the scope
of student government action un
der prevailing policies of the
Board of Trustees. If this is not
a reasonable understanding I
fully expect that the Board of
Trustees or the Administration
will so indicate, or would so have
indicated last fall when the Legis
lature passed another resolution
on the Berkeley situation.
In any case, as a member of
Legislature I certainly did not
vote on Thursday's Berkeley reso
lution for the ridiculous reason
implied in Friday's Daily, namely,
that statements of the Board of
Trustees are not relevant to ac
tions of Legislature.

There will be a silent spring in
most of Escondido Village this
year, due to a nest-egg-baby bird
extermination program. Mainten
ance men have been taking down
the nests of eggs and featherlcss
squeeking birds, and have been
throwing these in trash cans
(They say they didn't particularly
want to, but were only following
"orders." They delegated their
personal responsibility to a high
er authority.)
In this case the higher author
ity is Escondido Village adminis
tration. The "take down the nests"
program was initiated because of
several phone calls complaining
of the "mess" the birds were
making. We have several nests
in the roof of our building and
no mess in sight. Yet Escondido
Village authorities decided to re
move all the nests, wanted or not.
They acted, I feel, without much
reflection or moral decision, hast
ily seeking to pacify a few bitter
persons without consulting the
village council or the bulk of vil
lage residents, (who never im
agined such a program could he
initiated).
Many of us have children, who
have joyfully watched the nests
being built and the baby birds
being fed. What shall we tell them
now?
I, along with several of my
friends, called the office and
asked them to stop this cruel and
senseless extermination, and they
finally did. But de-nesting had
been going on several days and
the greater part of the village is
now filled with empty cornices

with the current situation on the
Berkeley campus. As a member
of the Legislature I am appalled
by the rationale attributed to the
majority's vote by the last para
graph in Friday's lead article.
This paragraph implied 1> that
the Berkeley resolution was con
sidered by the majority to be a
violation of Trustee policy and
21 that the majority circumvented
this policy by asserting that
the Legislature is not subject to
Trustee rulings.
This assertion posits ;i seem
ingly absurd relationship between
the Legislature and the Board
of Trustees. That the majority
subscribed to this assertion is, it
seems to me, an improbable and
unjustified conclusion. As to the
resolution itself, it was my un
derstanding ai Thursday's meet
ing that the present situation at
Berkeley is sufficiently pertinent
to student affairs on the Stanford
campus to fall within the scope
of student government action un
der prevailing policies of the
Board of Trustees. If this is not
a reasonable understanding I
fully expect that the Board of
Trustees or the Administration
will so indicate, or would so have
indicated last fall when the Legis
lature passed another resolution
on the Berkeley situation.
In any case, as a member of
Legislature I certainly did not
vote on Thursday's Berkeley reso
lution for the ridiculous reason
implied in Friday's Daily, namely,
that statements of the Board of
Trustees are not relevant to ac
tions of Legislature.
