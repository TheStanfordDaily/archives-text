# The 						Way to World Peace
## 
### 
Famed and eminent British historian Arnold J. l oynbee
declared recently that civilization has reached the point where
the very continuity of the human race depends upon the forma
tion of world government. " It is the mutual interest of the nations
to subordinate their national sovereignty to world authorities,
he said, "This is the only condition on which the nations can
survive in an atomic age".
In the light of world developments i> is interesting to con
sider the words of Jesus Christ. About two thousand years ago
the Prince of IVace told I lis followers: "You will hear of wars
and rumors of wars ; see that you are not alarmed : tor this must
take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against
nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be lamiues
and earthquakes in various places: all this is but the beginning
of sufferings ..." (Matthew 24 :l-8).
According to the Bible, history's darkest hour lies yet
ahead, a period of destruction and death far exceeding the toll
and travail of two world wars. From this holocaust only a few
will be saved.
Those who seek to bring about peace on earth should ac
quaint themselves with (iod s ways and methods, lor I lis great
purpose in present times is to call, out ot a lost dying world, a
group of people to lliinselt (Acts 15:13 IS).
The Kingdom of God begins with changed human hearts
through personally receiving Jesus Christ as Lord, ejsus Christ,
who came to bring peace to men, also made it clear I le was on
earth to divide and to separate men ( Matthew 10:33â€”34, J5 :31-
46).
God's soiiltion to the problem of world peace is to silently
and invisibly change mens lives b\ transtorming them trom
within. Those who meet and receive Jesus Christ have, not only
the peace of God here and now, but look expectantly and confi
dently to the day when His program for world peace has fully
come.
There is onl\ one effective wa\ you can work loi world
peace and that is liy accepting (iod's plans and methods. Commit
your life to Jesus Christ and become I li> instrument of righteous
ness and ills avenue of expression in a warring world whose
rebellion is basically against < iod alone.
