# Role of University Discussed
## 
### BILL WERTZ 
In an informal discussion at the
Women's clubhouse Friday Dr.
William H. Cowley of Stanford's
education department defended
the concern of most universities

with students' physical, intellect
ual and moral well-being. "We
should be interested in the whole
student," he said.
Cowley, speaking on the role
of the university in society, gave

the first lecture in a series of dis
cussions planned by the Y.W.C.A.
on "The University in Perspec
tive."
The role of the university, Cow
ley said, depends on the nature of
the society. The university must
attempt to meet the needs of
whatever society it is in.
I Cowley said the needs of the
| society were determined by many
I people, by both student and fac
ully pressure, and that there was
a constant tension between groups
with different ideas as to those
j needs. Sometimes, he said, these
tensions are released violently,
as when students at St. Johns re
belled against the indoctrination
on the catholic church.
Cowley provided a framework
for further discussions in t he
series by outlining a brief history
of the university tradition, which
stems, he says, from Plato's Aca
demy.
He traced the development of
the university from the Academy
to the museum at Alexandria
[which collected much of the
! known Greek knowledge. This
i knowledge was carried to Europe,
! Cowley said, by the Arabs, who
founded univerisities in Spain.
! From Spain, univerisities spread
| into Italy and France and finally
; to England and the United States
i many centuries later.
