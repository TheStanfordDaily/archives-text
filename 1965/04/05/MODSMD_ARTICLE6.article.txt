# TRUSTEE GUGGENHIME
## President Discusses Board 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
With the muffled roar of San Francisco's
rush hour in the background, Richard E.
Guggenhime, President of the Stanford
Board of Trustees, sat in his seventh floor
j office of Heller, Ehrman. White and Me
| Auliffe recently, and talked with a repre
sentative of The Daily.
Guggenhime, s(>, a graduate of Stanford
! (A.B. '29> and Harvard CL.L.B. '32), and the
| holder of a Phi Beta Kappa key. pushed his
j chair back against a shelved wall filled
j with volumes of California Reports and the
Harvard Law Review, and covered a range
of topics while an air conditioner hummed
! quietly in the background.
President Implements Board Opinions
Guggenhime talked first about the rela
tionship of the Board of Trustees to the
President of the University, whom the
Board appoints.
He analogized the relationship of the
Boarrl to t lie president as that of the Brit
ish Parliament: to its Prime Minister, in
I which the latter resigns in the case of a
j no-confidence vote on the part of the former.
! "You either support the president or get
' a new one," he explained.
I The Board's opinions, he said, serve as
"guidelines" to the president: "He solicits
these opinions, he knows the Board's views;
his job is to implement: them."
Usually, he said, there is little disagree
j ment between the president and the Board,
I as the Trustees consistently accept the
| recommendations of the man whom they
hired to run the University. "When you're
lucky enough to get a man like Wally Ster
ling," he explained, "then you rely on his
judgment in many areas. We have great
confidence in this fellow."
Sterling's Decision Probably Final
i He reiterated this position in regard to
the current campus debate over LASSU's
; Judicial Competence Bill. "The Board will

support the president, in whatever he de
cides," he asserted. "This is President Ster
ling's responsibility."
Once the president has decided upon the
fate of the bill, Guggenhime said, Sterling
will present to the Board "either a recom
mendation or a statement of his actions."
"The odds are overwhelming that the ulti
mate decision will be reported to the Board,
and that'll be it."
Kill's Meaning In Doubt
In regard to the bill itself, he said that
it "raises some pretty fundamental discus
sion on who does what to whom."
"I'm not sure what that bill means yet.
frankly," he continued. "I think that's one
of the subjects of the discussion and in
quiry."
Guggenhime declined to express for pub
lication his own opinion of the bill, saying
that his comments at this time "wouldn't
contribute to the discussion."
Board Members Not "MOssbacks"
Guggenhime was somewhat concerned
about the image projected by the Board's
members. "Contrary to popular opinion,
they're not mossbacks; they're not super
annuated. They're normal, vibrant people."
"I think there's an assumption that we
don't have a feeling for what's going on,"
said Guggenhime, in reference to the popu
lar student impression of the Board, "but
it's not correct," He noted that many of the
Trustees had frequent contact with the
campus in the line of their duties, and that
several have children who attend Stanford.
Board Meets Monthly
Guggenhime estimated that he spends
ihc equivalent of a day and a half per week
in Board activities, in addition to his regu
lar work as a lawyer.
The Trustees, he said, meet in San Fran
cisco the third Thursday of every month.
The proceeding two days are spent in meet
ings of the Board's standing committees on

Investments, Finance, Academic Affairs,
Buildings and Grounds, Planning and De
velopment, and Land Development.
These committees, according to Guggen
hime, make recommendations which the
assembled Board uses as the bases of its
decisions.
Trustees Serve Without Fay
"Ultimately and fortunately, there is usu
ally strong consensus on the Board. This
does not mean that there is not thorough
debate," he asserted.
He added that Board members serve with
out compensation.
He also noted that in spite of all these
pressures, Board members manage to stay
"very well informed and very attentive."
Each is presented with a half-inch thick
agenda several clays before Board meetings
in order to prepare himself for the upcom
ing discussions.
Emeriti Aid ill Work
The Board's workload, he said, is consid
erably lessened by the work of the Trustees
emeriti, many of whom continue 1o partici
pate in the Board's work at the end of their
ten-year terms or after their mandatory
retirements at the age of TO.
Guggenhime delineated the procedure by
which the Board perpetuates its member
ship.
When a vacancy occurs, he said, the
Board is polled for the names of likely can
didates. The Nominations Committee stud
ies these suggestions, after which the Board
selects the new member.
Guggenhime said that the Nominations
Committee endeavors to recommend "men
and women of breadth, understanding, and
ability."
Making a college community like Stan
ford operational "is a team effort," Gug
genhime concluded. "Unless all the parts
work together, the University cannot func
tion."
