### STAN DALEY 
While most of the student body
I was sunning, .skiing or making
! up incompletes during Spring
j break, three KZSU staffers made
'a six-city, 5,800 mile tour of the
I South to prepare a series of ra-
I dio program on the activities of
j various civil rights groups.
"CR 65"- eight half-hour shows
| to be aired every Tuesday night
I from 10-10:30 p.m. beginning to
j morrow night is the result of this
trip.
<jrather«*(l Information
Station Manager Ralph Peer
iand Chief Engineer Jim Mcßae

thought of the idea, and Person
nel Director Bo O'Neil joined
them on the 12-day trip.
"We spent most of our time
talking with staff workers in the
various organizations," Peer ex
plained, "to gather background in
formation on their operations and
to find out what they planned to
do this summer."
Near the end of the trip the
three visited Biloxi, Mississippi,
where they talked to members of
the .Mississippi Freedom Demo
cratic Party (MFDP>. The next
day they agreed to take some of
the "top brass" who were in town

for a workshop over to Montgom- I
cry, Alabama.
< ivil Unrest
"We wanted to go through !
Meridian," Meßae said, "but they :
were opposed. They said that the .
cops in the neighboring area car- j
ried Tommy guns."
However, the travelers saw no i
policemen until they arrived in [
Montgomery, where there were !
thousands of them.
It was in Montgomery that the i
KZSU-men had their only brush j
with the more seamy side of j
Southern hospitality. Although j
police cars had tailed their car in j
various cities, especially when Nc-!
groes wore riding with them, they j
had not had any trouble. In Mont
gomery some cars buzzed them I
on the street the night before the;
marchers from Selma arrvied, i
and the whites yelled obscenities.!
Interviewed Marchers
The next day they interviewed j
marchers from Selma at the camp !
outside the city, "Mostly, we con
centrated on questions of how
their security had been arranged
for and why they marched," Me- j
Rae said.
The group walked in with the i
m a r e licrs and recorded the!
speeches at the." rally, "and then !
got out of Montgomery as quickly !
as possible."
All in all, the three visited head-j
quarters and workshops- of all j
the major civil rights organiza- j
tions in cities as diverse as Me-
Comb. Miss., New Orleans and At- j
lanta.
The first program tomorrow I
night will de;il with today's clce-j
tion in McComb, where two Ne- j
groes arc running for local office 1
for the first time in state history j
since Reconstruction.
