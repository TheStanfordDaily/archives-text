### 
| A chemist and throe physicists
have been honored with unre-
Istricted grants for basic research
i from the Alfred P. Sloan Founda
j tion.
Named Alfred P. Sloan Re
search Fellows were Chemistry
i Prof. Victor W. Laurie, who will
I carry on his investigations in
■ molecular spectroscopy, and Phy
jsics Profs. Sam M. Austin, Frank
! S. Dietrich, and Robert J. Oakes.
Profs. Austin and Dietrich will
I continue their research in low
i energy nuclear physics, while
Prof. Oakes will pursue theoreti-
I cal studies in high-energy particle
i physics.
They were selected along with
87 other chemists, mathemati

cians, physicists and interdiscipli
nary scientists from f>2 U.S. and
Canadian universities who re
ceived $1,400,000 in awards from
the Foundation. Recipients must
be nominated by colleagues, and
most awards are for two years.
