### BOB THIERIOT 
Unbeknown to many Daily read
ers the Frosh baseball team from
Stanford University is off to a
roaring start in the Freshman
Bay Area Baseball League. The
teiim has compiled an 8-1 slate.
Santa Clara, holding down the
second spot, has a 3-1 record to
trail ihe Papooses by 2'l< games.
But more important Santa Clara
trails by 5 games in the win col
umn. All the other teams in the
league have at least four losses.
First Loss
The frosh have played two
games with the Broncos. In the
first game of the season the Pa
pooses outlasted Santa Clara 7-5.
From then until last Saturday the
Stanford pitchers hurled five
shutouts in six games, including
two massacres of San Francisco
State, 17-0. By the time of the
second Santa Clara game the
team earned run average was last
ing comfortably below 1.00.
The Little Indians had built up
a three and a half game lead
over the Broncos. But Stanford
did not have it. Santa Cla r a
bombed the Papooses 13-4. For the
first time the pitching was poor.
Par usual the hitting was strong
but not timely. Stanford left thir
teen men stranded on the bases.
As the assistant coach put it,
"We won the little battles. They
won Ihe big ones. We out scored
them in the eighth inning, 4-1."
But Stanford is not in any danger
in the FBABL. It has overcome
California twice.
