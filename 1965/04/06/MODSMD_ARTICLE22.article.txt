# Flood Stage at Berkeley
## 
### 
Charlie Powell, President of the Berkeley
ASUC, is a patient and cautious young man.
Calm in the face of impending disaster, dis
passionate in the midst of passionate advocacy,
and, apparently completely oblivious to the
thoughts and temper of those whom he was
elected to lead—Powell, for over six months now,
fiddled away in his citadel in the ASUC union
while, only four floors below, on the steps ol
Sproul hall, the University of California burned
around him.
With this in mind, then, it is perhaps not un
fair to suggest that the time and tide in the
affairs of Berkeley has reached the flooding
stage when Charlie Powell of the ASUC feels
called upon to take a stand.
And that's just what he did—in his own quix
otic way—yesterday while tentatively backing
the graduate students in their fight with the re
gents over ASUC representation. "I felt," said
Powell, "that the issue of the [graduate] elec
tions was such that I couldn't help but support
the students all the way.
Powell's statement in support of the students
(ironic though it be in its reluctance) merely
reinforces the suggestion that Cal's Board of
Regents, acting out of fear and a large measure
of ignorance—and aided and abetted by their be
leaguered Chancellor Martin Meyerson—are de
termined, once again, to propel Berkeley from
the brink into the chasm of disaster.
II one ignores, for the moment, the somewhat
confusing question of voting percentages, the
issue behind the issue of graduate representa
tion in the ASUC becomes clear enough. The
graduate students at Berkeley, particularly the
GCC, represent the kind of hard-core liberal
sentiment which has traditionally made the poli
tically-self-conscious Board of Regents fairly

bristle in distaste. Thus, as one Berkeley senate
member has pointed out, "The regents simply
can't tolerate the possibility of a senate run by
the GCC and Slate."
However, given half a democratic chance, the
possibility of a senate run by the GCC and Slate
is more likely than not to become a reality. Ilence,
the Regents, from their point of view, could do
naught but make sure that democracy, even with
in the limits of the ASUC constitution, was given
no chance at all. And that's exactly what they've
done in their recent edict invalidating an amend
ment to the Berkeley constitution which would
have brought the graduate students back into
the ASUC.
As most observers of the Berkeley scene point
out, the Regent's argument that the amendment,
approved by better than two to one, was invalid
because less than fifty per cent of the graduates
eligible participated in voting ,simply doesn't
make sense.
"They invented this thing about fifty per
cent," said one member of the senate, "and then
said it's been in effect for ever and ever; but it
never has been in effect here until now." Charles
Powell confirmed this view, and added, "1 think
of the Regents as being very fine people, but 1
think when they made this decision they just
didn't have the facts before them."
The facts are these: if the students continue
with their elections, as they, in good faith must,
and Chancellor Meyerson acts according to the
Regents' edict, as he feels he must, the ASUC
will face abolition—an act which would obliterate
any possibility of further student-administration
communication.
Thus, fine people or not, the Regents have,
in their efforts to avoid trouble, merely estab
lished the preconditions for wholesale catas
trophe.
