## Rumor Roundup: Gossip and Inuendo 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I hope Monday's "Roundup of
Rumors and Rumblings" is not a
permanent feature. Its substitu
tion of gossip and inuendo for au
thenticated news and responsible
interpretation lacks both intellec
tual integrity and a respect for
human rights.
For instance, I have no knowl
edge of the Ravenswood plan, or
of whether President Sterling
nixed it, or if he did, why. But if
he did, Justin Beck's conclusion
that "Supposedly President Ster
ling feels, on the basis of a South
ern trip many years ago, that j
self-help is the only solution to '
Negro problems," is stupid a n d
unjust.

• Amusing Review
Editor, The Daily:
I want to thank you for the
amusing review of Zorba the
Greek in last Friday's Daily, and
especially for the perceptive an
alysis of the roots and meaning
of Mr. Quinn's Zorba. It takes a
rather special kind of careful
thought to feel Zorba's message
as you did . . . that to survive
life's troubles one need only to
dance the Greek or Cretan equiv- j
alent of the Jerk . . . with some'

feeling, of course . . . and you
were quite the responsible critic
to expose the shallowness of this
message.
Certainly by continuing to use
your mind in this fashion you
will be able to avoid failure, exu
berance, agony, ecstasy, seductive
widows and "pscudo-ness," not to
say sore muscles from dancing.
Yes Boss, don't ever undo your
belt or your pants may fall down,
and the breezes are so uncomfort
able. Fat men do look ridiculous
running naked into the sea don't
they? Yes serious young men
with their pants lashed up to
their armpits are safe from
"trouble" as well as wandering
widows.

• A Grave Defieieney
Editor, The Daily:
Being a Cal student, perhaps it
was with an overzealously criti
cal eye that I visited your campus
recently. Yet. I cannot remain
silent. I feel compelled to call a
grave deficiency in your whole
academic approach to the carpet.
Visiting the freshman coed dorm,

Roble Hall, I was distressed to
learn that there is not a single
men's rest room in the edifice.
Down on the farm, this may raise
some eyebrows that a male should
be concerned with such amenities
in a girl's dorm, but we at Cal
have been softened by the estab
lish custom of constructing,
shall we say, dual rest rooms in
all dormitories. The lack of same
caused untold personal embarrass
ment to myself, firstly when I en
quired of a sweet young thing,
the whereabouts of the water
closet and was politely, but
firmly, informed that I was out of
luck; and secondly, because of
the curiosity my female compan
ion evinced concerning my sub
sequent skittish gyrations.
The advantages of more males
staying longer hours would more
than compensate for the construc
tion cost of appropriate facilities.
Perhaps, a campus-wide drive
could be spearheaded by the "dol
lies" of Branner, Roble, and Flo
Mo. If such a project was initiated
and successfully concluded on
your campus, a telling blow would
be struck for the power and effi
cacy of student government and
for the genuine concern it mani
fests for the welfare of all stu
dents.
