## Gas Warfare: Breaking Old Taboos and Soft Policy 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
By using gas in South Vietnam we have punctured, though
not by any means penetrated, a taboo which, in the particular sit
uation, has greatly served the interests of the enemy. Gas has its
military uses. It is an ugly weapon, but paradoxically it is ugly
primarily because of the damage it didn't do, rather than because

of the damage it did do. "
The international revulsion
against gas after the first world
war was the result of everyone's
knowing someone who limped
back from the front lines in
France, his lungs half destroyed,
who slowly a n d agonizingly
coughed his way to death during
the ensuing five, ton, or twenty
years. If the gas had killed 1 he
vieitims outright instead of
merely maiming them, the revul
sion against it woul d have
seemed about as pointless as a
revulsion against bullets, which
are designed to kill, and are there
fore most appropriately instru
ments of wars which are them
selves designed to kill: to kill un
til the enemy loses the will, or
the capacity, to sustain more
punishment, and capitulates to
the victor. Purely in terms of hu
man phychology, the enduring
abhorrence of gas would not have
been so vital a force in contem
porary politics if gas had been
deadlier, rather than less deadly.
Selfish Not Humane
The same nations which, dur
ing the second world war, felt
free to use concentration camps,
gas ovens, fire bombs, and atom
bombs, cannot reasonably be sup
posed to have flinched at the
use of gas as a result of humani
tarian scruple or Swiss protocols
(actually, the United States never
subscribed to the Geneva agree
ment of 1925). It is the judgment
of students of the second war
that the principal reason why
gas was not used was selfish
rather than humane or legalistic.
The better judgment on both
sides was that no one, by initiat
ing the use of gas, could count
ontaking any decisive advantage:
that the retaliatory use of gas
might very well cause more dam
age to the first party than he
gained by initiating the use of it.
Now the United States is cau
tiously defying the general taboo
against gas by using not a gas
l.uperimproved to guarantee a
deadly effect: but a wholly inno
cent variant, comparable to tear
gas, which is designed to immo
bilize the enemy over a finite
period of time, leaving him with
his lungs, and sinuses, wholly

intact. It was to be expected that
the enemy, caught in a tactical
situation where the gas hurt him
more than the retaliatory use of
it would hurt us, should howl
with pain: and that he should
count, quite safely, on the echo
chambers of liberal fatuity to
carry his propaganda around the
world.
Administration Immobilizes
The Administration, every bit
| as susceptible to world opinion as
1 a Vietcong soldier is to gas, was
duly immobilized. Finally, Dean
Husk stumbled forward with the
Administration's hesitant justifi
cations. That was encouraging.
But it was discouraging that he
should have stressed its harmless
character in such a way as to
! imply that we pledge ourselves
not to use the real thing. Be
cause the real thing is exactly
what we need given the situation
we face in South Vietnam.
Senator Goldwater had his head
chopped off a year ago when he
revealed that tin 1 Pentagon was
actually considering the use of
a special kind of atom bomb to
effect defoliation and bare the
movements of the terrorists, so
as to be able to stop them from
the air. Another taboo: and pub
lic opinion appeared to close
down on the use of any nuclear
device, even if restricted to for
ests and jungles.
The Real McCoy
Now, by stressing the non-nox
i ious characteristics of the gases
we have been using, we seem to
[ be recommitting ourselves not to
use the real McCoy we ought al
most certainly to be using.
War is the second worst activ
ity of mankind, the worst being
I acquiescence in slavery. Having
I chosen war in South Vietnam, it
becomes correct to use means ap
| propriate to its successful com
pletion. It would be wholly wrong
I to atomize Moscow in order to set
things right in Vietnam. It is as
wrong to leave matters uncon
cluded in Vietnam because we re
fuse to use weapons there which
are wholly appropriate to the ob
jective we undertook.

By using gas in South Vietnam we have punctured, though
not by any means penetrated, a taboo which, in the particular sit
uation, has greatly served the interests of the enemy. Gas has its
military uses. It is an ugly weapon, but paradoxically it is ugly
primarily because of the damage it didn't do, rather than because

of the damage it did do. "
The international revulsion
against gas after the first world
war was the result of everyone's
knowing someone who limped
back from the front lines in
France, his lungs half destroyed,
who slowly a n d agonizingly
coughed his way to death during
the ensuing five, ton, or twenty
years. If the gas had killed 1 he
vieitims outright instead of
merely maiming them, the revul
sion against it woul d have
seemed about as pointless as a
revulsion against bullets, which
are designed to kill, and are there
fore most appropriately instru
ments of wars which are them
selves designed to kill: to kill un
til the enemy loses the will, or
the capacity, to sustain more
punishment, and capitulates to
the victor. Purely in terms of hu
man phychology, the enduring
abhorrence of gas would not have
been so vital a force in contem
porary politics if gas had been
deadlier, rather than less deadly.
Selfish Not Humane
The same nations which, dur
ing the second world war, felt
free to use concentration camps,
gas ovens, fire bombs, and atom
bombs, cannot reasonably be sup
posed to have flinched at the
use of gas as a result of humani
tarian scruple or Swiss protocols
(actually, the United States never
subscribed to the Geneva agree
ment of 1925). It is the judgment
of students of the second war
that the principal reason why
gas was not used was selfish
rather than humane or legalistic.
The better judgment on both
sides was that no one, by initiat
ing the use of gas, could count
ontaking any decisive advantage:
that the retaliatory use of gas
might very well cause more dam
age to the first party than he
gained by initiating the use of it.
Now the United States is cau
tiously defying the general taboo
against gas by using not a gas
l.uperimproved to guarantee a
deadly effect: but a wholly inno
cent variant, comparable to tear
gas, which is designed to immo
bilize the enemy over a finite
period of time, leaving him with
his lungs, and sinuses, wholly

intact. It was to be expected that
the enemy, caught in a tactical
situation where the gas hurt him
more than the retaliatory use of
it would hurt us, should howl
with pain: and that he should
count, quite safely, on the echo
chambers of liberal fatuity to
carry his propaganda around the
world.
Administration Immobilizes
The Administration, every bit
| as susceptible to world opinion as
1 a Vietcong soldier is to gas, was
duly immobilized. Finally, Dean
Husk stumbled forward with the
Administration's hesitant justifi
cations. That was encouraging.
But it was discouraging that he
should have stressed its harmless
character in such a way as to
! imply that we pledge ourselves
not to use the real thing. Be
cause the real thing is exactly
what we need given the situation
we face in South Vietnam.
Senator Goldwater had his head
chopped off a year ago when he
revealed that tin 1 Pentagon was
actually considering the use of
a special kind of atom bomb to
effect defoliation and bare the
movements of the terrorists, so
as to be able to stop them from
the air. Another taboo: and pub
lic opinion appeared to close
down on the use of any nuclear
device, even if restricted to for
ests and jungles.
The Real McCoy
Now, by stressing the non-nox
i ious characteristics of the gases
we have been using, we seem to
[ be recommitting ourselves not to
use the real McCoy we ought al
most certainly to be using.
War is the second worst activ

By using gas in South Vietnam we have punctured, though
not by any means penetrated, a taboo which, in the particular sit
uation, has greatly served the interests of the enemy. Gas has its
military uses. It is an ugly weapon, but paradoxically it is ugly
primarily because of the damage it didn't do, rather than because

of the damage it did do. "
The international revulsion
against gas after the first world
war was the result of everyone's
knowing someone who limped
back from the front lines in
France, his lungs half destroyed,
who slowly a n d agonizingly
coughed his way to death during
the ensuing five, ton, or twenty
years. If the gas had killed 1 he
vieitims outright instead of
merely maiming them, the revul
sion against it woul d have
seemed about as pointless as a
revulsion against bullets, which
are designed to kill, and are there
fore most appropriately instru
ments of wars which are them
selves designed to kill: to kill un
til the enemy loses the will, or
the capacity, to sustain more
punishment, and capitulates to
the victor. Purely in terms of hu
man phychology, the enduring
abhorrence of gas would not have
been so vital a force in contem
porary politics if gas had been
deadlier, rather than less deadly.
Selfish Not Humane
The same nations which, dur
ing the second world war, felt
free to use concentration camps,
gas ovens, fire bombs, and atom
bombs, cannot reasonably be sup
posed to have flinched at the
use of gas as a result of humani
tarian scruple or Swiss protocols
(actually, the United States never
subscribed to the Geneva agree
ment of 1925). It is the judgment
of students of the second war
that the principal reason why
gas was not used was selfish
rather than humane or legalistic.
The better judgment on both
sides was that no one, by initiat
ing the use of gas, could count
ontaking any decisive advantage:
that the retaliatory use of gas
might very well cause more dam
age to the first party than he
gained by initiating the use of it.
Now the United States is cau
tiously defying the general taboo
against gas by using not a gas
l.uperimproved to guarantee a
deadly effect: but a wholly inno
cent variant, comparable to tear
gas, which is designed to immo
bilize the enemy over a finite
period of time, leaving him with
his lungs, and sinuses, wholly

intact. It was to be expected that
the enemy, caught in a tactical
situation where the gas hurt him
more than the retaliatory use of
it would hurt us, should howl
with pain: and that he should
count, quite safely, on the echo
chambers of liberal fatuity to
carry his propaganda around the
world.
Administration Immobilizes
The Administration, every bit
| as susceptible to world opinion as
1 a Vietcong soldier is to gas, was
duly immobilized. Finally, Dean
Husk stumbled forward with the
Administration's hesitant justifi
cations. That was encouraging.
But it was discouraging that he
should have stressed its harmless
character in such a way as to
! imply that we pledge ourselves
not to use the real thing. Be
cause the real thing is exactly
what we need given the situation
we face in South Vietnam.
Senator Goldwater had his head
chopped off a year ago when he
revealed that tin 1 Pentagon was
actually considering the use of
a special kind of atom bomb to
effect defoliation and bare the
movements of the terrorists, so
as to be able to stop them from
the air. Another taboo: and pub
lic opinion appeared to close
down on the use of any nuclear
device, even if restricted to for
ests and jungles.
The Real McCoy
Now, by stressing the non-nox
i ious characteristics of the gases
we have been using, we seem to
[ be recommitting ourselves not to
use the real McCoy we ought al
most certainly to be using.
War is the second worst activ
ity of mankind, the worst being
I acquiescence in slavery. Having
I chosen war in South Vietnam, it
becomes correct to use means ap
| propriate to its successful com
pletion. It would be wholly wrong
I to atomize Moscow in order to set
things right in Vietnam. It is as
wrong to leave matters uncon
cluded in Vietnam because we re
fuse to use weapons there which
are wholly appropriate to the ob
jective we undertook.
