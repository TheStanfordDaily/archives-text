# Scientist Examines Unique Storage Rings
## High-Energy Electron Collision Achieved by Team of Scientists 
### 
Success of one of the most
unique experiments ever sel up
to test some of our most funda
mental concepts of matter was
announced recenfly by a team of
Stanford-Princeton physicists.
Princeton Prof. Bernard Gittlo
nian reported the achievement
collisions of electrons at an
"equivalent energy" of 360 Bev
(billion electron volts) in a pair
of storage rings located here at
Stanford. He spoke at a particle
accelerator conference held in
Washington, D.C.
The first high-energy collisions
-.between electrons ever achieved
j occurred 011 Feb. 1. The event cli
maxed six years of intensive
(work, three of them years of
(frustrating problems that threa
tened to defeat the scientists'
; efforts.
The experiments's success opens
. j up a whole new area of research
I 1 into some of the most profound
questions in physics. A m o tig
1 other things, the high-energy
• j electron collisions will constitute
• the severest test yet devised for
one of modern physics' most suc
cessful theories the theory of
quantum electrodynamics.
Even more intriguing, perhaps,
