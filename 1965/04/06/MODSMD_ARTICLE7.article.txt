# Elementary Students Learn Mathematics from Computer
## 
### 
Professor Patrick Suppes, Director of the Institute for Mathe
matical Studies in the Social Sciences has announced that a com
puter-based laboratory for learning and teaching has been developed
at the Computation Center.
At present twelve first graders are coming in every day for
thirty miinutes to work individually at computer terminals. A com
plete mathematics curriculum is being presented to them under
computer control. Also on a daily basis, two bright second graders
and two kindergarten children are being presented and taught spe
cial curriculums.
Initial work was begun in 1963 with a one million dollar grant
from the Carnegie Foundation. The mathematics curriculum re
search, as well as purchase of some of the equipment, is also being
supported by the Course Content Improvement Section of the Na
tional Science Foundation.
The computer-based laboratory consists of six student stations
located in a special addition built on to the Computation Center. At
each station is an IBM terminal which displays a microfilm image
on which the student may respond with a light pen. and a Philco
cathoderay tube with accompanyihg typewriter keyboard.
In addition, a Westinghouse audio system will bo delivered in
the next few weeks. This audio system provides random access to
prerecorded messages to play to a student at a station.
A typical example of a problem in arithmetic would be the fol
lowing: a student is shown 3 112 5. In the case of the IBM device he
is shown ;i visual keyboard at the bottom of the screen, and he may
use his light pen to select the correct answer, namely, the numeral
2. Or for a similar display on the cathoderay tube he may use the
typewriter keyboard to respond.
Advantages of the computer-based system appear to be many.
Hr. Suppes outlined these: extensive accommodations to individual
differences, data recording and analysis, teachers will be Ireed to give
students individual attention, and easy recognition of individual .stu
dent problems.
