# Elections at Cal Delayed; Mock Voting Is Held
## 
### JAMES BRISCOE Managing Editor 
The* futurc ol student government at Berkeley still remains
in doubt today, as elections ior graduate representatives to the
Student Senate were postponed by the Student Judicial Commit
tee pending a hearing tomorrow to determine the constitutional
ity of the vote.
The Graduate Coordinating Council is, however, holding a

"freedom vote" using all the regu
lar polling facilities of the Asso
ciated Students. According to
Brian Turner, a member of the
Student Senate, the GCC will ap-
I peal to the Senate to have 1 h c
voting certified as an official
election if the Judicial Com. rules
favorably on the Constitutional
amendment to admit graduates.
Voting turnout is reported to
bo very heavy. Turner reports
that at least 4,000 people have
already voted and the total turn
out is expected to be near 8,000.
Amendment Nullified
The controversy arose after the
Board of Regents attempted to
nullify a constitutional amend
ment passed by the student body.
The amendment allowed the ad
mission of graduate students to
the Associated Students of the
University of California (ASUC>.
[ The Trustees based their deci
j sion on the fact that less than
1 50 per cent of the graduate stu
| dents voted in a referendum on
whether or not to seek admission
to the ASUC. Admission would
allow the ASUC to collect eompul
jsory fees from the graduates.
However, ASUC Pr e si d en t
j Charlie Powell indicated that such
fees were already being levied.
He reported that the graduates
have been paying $2.25 to th e
ASUC since 1959 for the student
newspaper and administrative
|cost.
Future of Freedom Vote
Turner expressed hope that the
'"freedom vote would be certified
as an official ASUC election by
;the Student Senate, but Powell
| felt it was unlikely and undesir
j able.
"I would hate to see it accepted
(as a legitimate vote," he told the
Daily last night.
Powell believes the vote itself
is a very good thing however.
"I look on the freedom ballot
j as being a poll," ho said, "And as
| such I think it is very good. It is
j very important to find a better
| opinion of the grads on this mat-
I ter."
Powell indicated that if the
Judicial Committee approves the
j constitutional change, and the
j Senate refuses to accept the free
: dom vote, regular elections will be
1 held on Monday, Tuesday, and
! Wednesday of next week.
ASI'C May Be Dissolved
Chancellor Martin Meyerson
j has threatened to dissolve the
' ASUC if graduates are admitted
j to the Senate. The Regents have
'taken the position that their veto
nullifies 1 he constitutional amend
| mont, and Meyerson maintains
I elections of grad representatives
would then be in violation of the
ASUC Constitution.
Powell expressed the opinion
that it would nol be possible to
abolish the ASUC except in rela
tion to the Administration.
"I think you can consider us
as autonomous business organ
! ization," he said, "We pay taxes to
| the state as the ASUC."
The ASUC presently leases a
building from the University to
house their offices, and Powell
'stated that the students would

j not voluntarily move out of the
1 building.
Students Would Force
Court Fight
"They may have to evict us," he
i said, "And probably what we
I would do then is go to court with
i the whole thing."
Turner indicated that the stu
! dent body might also bring suit
j against the administration on the
question of student fees. The Uni
: versity has not yet turned over to
the ASUC the fees collected from
: the students in February.

ASI'C May Be Dissolved
Chancellor Martin Meyerson
j has threatened to dissolve the
' ASUC if graduates are admitted
j to the Senate. The Regents have
'taken the position that their veto
nullifies 1 he constitutional amend
| mont, and Meyerson maintains
I elections of grad representatives
would then be in violation of the
ASUC Constitution.
Powell expressed the opinion
that it would nol be possible to
abolish the ASUC except in rela
tion to the Administration.
"I think you can consider us
as autonomous business organ
! ization," he said, "We pay taxes to
| the state as the ASUC."
The ASUC presently leases a
building from the University to
house their offices, and Powell
'stated that the students would

j not voluntarily move out of the
1 building.
Students Would Force
Court Fight
"They may have to evict us," he
i said, "And probably what we
I would do then is go to court with
i the whole thing."
Turner indicated that the stu
! dent body might also bring suit
j against the administration on the
question of student fees. The Uni
: versity has not yet turned over to
the ASUC the fees collected from
: the students in February.
The* futurc ol student government at Berkeley still remains
in doubt today, as elections ior graduate representatives to the
Student Senate were postponed by the Student Judicial Commit
tee pending a hearing tomorrow to determine the constitutional
ity of the vote.
The Graduate Coordinating Council is, however, holding a

"freedom vote" using all the regu
lar polling facilities of the Asso
ciated Students. According to
Brian Turner, a member of the
Student Senate, the GCC will ap-
I peal to the Senate to have 1 h c
voting certified as an official
election if the Judicial Com. rules
favorably on the Constitutional
amendment to admit graduates.
Voting turnout is reported to
bo very heavy. Turner reports
that at least 4,000 people have
already voted and the total turn
out is expected to be near 8,000.
Amendment Nullified
The controversy arose after the
Board of Regents attempted to
nullify a constitutional amend
ment passed by the student body.
The amendment allowed the ad
mission of graduate students to
the Associated Students of the
University of California (ASUC>.
[ The Trustees based their deci
j sion on the fact that less than
1 50 per cent of the graduate stu
| dents voted in a referendum on
whether or not to seek admission
to the ASUC. Admission would
allow the ASUC to collect eompul
jsory fees from the graduates.
However, ASUC Pr e si d en t
j Charlie Powell indicated that such
fees were already being levied.
He reported that the graduates
have been paying $2.25 to th e
ASUC since 1959 for the student
newspaper and administrative
|cost.
Future of Freedom Vote
Turner expressed hope that the
'"freedom vote would be certified
as an official ASUC election by
;the Student Senate, but Powell
| felt it was unlikely and undesir
j able.
"I would hate to see it accepted
(as a legitimate vote," he told the
Daily last night.
Powell believes the vote itself
is a very good thing however.
