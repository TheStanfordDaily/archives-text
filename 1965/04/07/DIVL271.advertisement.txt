like William Shakespeare. Although it is now KHI years since his liirlh. his
writings and plays are more popular than ever. The epigrammatic style of the
faun 1 poe and playwright often mistaken for that of the Hible. In a class
uf midwestern college students more than half mistook Shakespearean lines
as these to lie from the Bible :
"Ignorance is the curse of (iod, knowledge the wing whereby we fly to
heaven" ( I'art 2, If airy 11. Act IV, Scene 7).
"The ruin speaks, that sometime it w;is a worthy building" ( Cymbelinc,
Act V. Scene 2).
. . told by an idot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing" (Macbeth,
Act V, Scene 5 ).
"Lord, what fool* these mortals be" (Midsummer Night's Dream, Act
111. Scene 2).
"And earthly power doth then show likest (iod when mercy seasons
justice" < Merchant of I 'enice, Act IV. Scene I).

as these to lie from the Bible :
"Ignorance is the curse of (iod, knowledge the wing whereby we fly to
heaven" ( I'art 2, If airy 11. Act IV, Scene 7).
"The ruin speaks, that sometime it w;is a worthy building" ( Cymbelinc,
Act V. Scene 2).

Act V, Scene 5 ).
"Lord, what fool* these mortals be" (Midsummer Night's Dream, Act

as these to lie from the Bible :
"Ignorance is the curse of (iod, knowledge the wing whereby we fly to
heaven" ( I'art 2, If airy 11. Act IV, Scene 7).
"The ruin speaks, that sometime it w;is a worthy building" ( Cymbelinc,
Act V. Scene 2).

111. Scene 2).
"And earthly power doth then show likest (iod when mercy seasons
