A I londa is a slim 24''
at the widest point. This V $88
narrows down the hunt for
a parking space considerably. You can
slide into almost any shady spot. I,ike just
outside of English Lit. Hondas tit into slim budgets too.
Prices start about $215*. Gas goes farther, up to 200 mpg
on some models. And cutting your wheels in half does just
about the same tiling for insurance costs. Or more.
This is the sporty Super 90 with its distinguished T-bone
frame. Tops 60 niph. Just one of the 15 Honda models that
make other campus transportation strictly for the birds.
