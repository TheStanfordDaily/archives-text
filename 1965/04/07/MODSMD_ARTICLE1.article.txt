# The 						Happy Days of Wine and Rosencranz

### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor (First in a Series 
In Spring, the sap begins to run and so
do the local student politieos.
for those innocents who think that Stan
ford's annual rite of Spring is only a hap
hazard confrontation of inflated egoes, and
who think that a group like the GCC is an
aberration, a brief history of the various stu
dent cabals and their candidates during the
last three ASSU Presidential elections may be
enlightening.
Boy's -Job
"Send a man to do a boy's job," the cam
paign blurb urged the student body one week
before the primary election three years ago.
The candidate was a late entry; his name
would not appear on the primary ballot. It
would have to be written in.
The candidate didn't seem to be serious—
"It takes a pompous person to deal with pom
pous people. That is why I should be elected."

The candidate's supporter's didn't seem to
be serious either. Aside from the above slogan,
they coined such constituent organizations as
"Aliens for Armin" and "Anti-Behaviorists for
Armin."
Poli Sci T.A.
The candidate was Armin Rosencranz,
fourth year grad student, a teaching assistant
in the Political Science Department, and the
eventual winner of a hotly contested, seven
man race.
"It all began as a joke among several of us
in Political Science; We thought he'd be furi
ous and withdraw . . . but he didn't," said sen
ior Helen Benjamin.
Tom O'Leary, a teaching assistant in the
department, noted that Armin had a "follow
ing" among some ofthe students in his classes,
and that they mimeographed the flylets trum
peting "Charmin' Armin's virtues."
Won Primary
Rosencranz' appeal was such that he won
the primary, thus leaving only Jim Andrus.s

to stop him from winning the Presidency.
The candidate told The Daily after the pri
mary vote that ho hoped "the glory of near
victory doesn't undermine the shy, modest,
diffident, self-effacing and unassuming na
ture which has unquestionably endeared me
to so many of my supporters."
Three days later a photograph of the two
candidates appeared on the front page. An
druss struck a normal politician's pose; Armin
did an imitation of a self-satisfied Napoleon,
with a hand under his coat and a smug smile
on his face.
Serious Government
The issues in the resulting campaign were
somewhat obscure. Andruss appealed to all
those who were in favor of "serious govern
ment" at Stanford. Armin promised to "replace
the traditional bureaucracy with an enlight
ened despotism."
Liquor was the big issue. A change in the
Fundamental Standard had been approved by
the Legislature which would make the Uni

versity's liquor policy "in accordance with
state law" and the referendum would be on
the same ballot as the presidential campaign.
Andruss was non-committal; Rosencranz' sup
porters chanted that "Armin is charmin' but
liquor is quicker."
In the last days of the campaign, however, a
more serious side to Armin's platform was
brought to light. He made an appeal for co
educational housing, urged the formation of
tutorial and study groups under interested
grad students, and encouraged campus intel
lectual's to take a more active part in student
government.
Many Graduates Vote
On election day, Armin Rosencranz won
by 262 votes out of a record turnout of 3,604.
The official number of graduates who voted
was 424—"an unusually large number," ac
cording to the Election Committee Chairman
- and many others who voted did not indicate
their class on the voting list.
While Armin was thanking the student

body lor its "discriminating exercise of th e
franchise," and assuring everyone that he
"really didn't plan on running for Governor,"
Bob Sayler, the outgoing ASSU President, was
making a few caustic observations to the Daily.
"It is difficult to comment on the amor
phous concept called Armin Rosencranz," he
said. "To impress some, Mr. Rosencranz ridi
culed student government; to impress others
he embraced it.
.Rosencranz a Fraud
"This tactic suggests that as a political
scientist, Armin Rosencranz is a fraud.
"He distributed posters which read 'Send a
man to do a boy's job.' If Mr. Rosencranz is a
man, it doesn't have to be a boy's job," Say
lor concluded.
Many were just as confused as to what
Rosencranz really had in mind. Not too many
knew about GRIP, or' about the new Presi
dent's determination to utilize what lie had
called "interested student intellectuals" in re
vamping the role of student government vis
a-vis the Administration and faculty.
