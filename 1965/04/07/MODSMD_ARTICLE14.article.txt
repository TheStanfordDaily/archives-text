### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
It looks like Berkeley is about to lose another chancellor.
Martin Meyerson, dean of the College of Environmental De
sign at Berkeley when he replaced Edward Strong as chancellor
in early January, is walking a thin line between the University of
California's students and its Board of Regents.
At their March 26 Board meeting, the Regents rejected a

graduate student request for per-'
mission to participate in Ber
keley's student government, th e
Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California.
UC President Clark Kerr ex
plained that the Regents' action
was based on the results of a
graduate student referendum in
which 32 per cent of the graduates
voted. A small majority favored
ASUC representation. The Re
gents, said Kerr, would only have
accepted the request if more than
half of the graduates had voted,
by a two-to-one margin, for inclu
sion.
