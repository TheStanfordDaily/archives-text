# Politicos Will Still Receive 'Daily Texan'

### 
AUSTIN, Texas (CPS)â€”State
legislators in Texas will continue
to receive The Daily Texan, stu
dent newspaper at the University
of Texas, despite efforts by the
University's Board of Regents to
keep copies of the Texan away
from the Legislature, which meets
only a few blocks from the Uni
versity.
The Student Assembly unani
mously appropriated $112.50 from
the Students' Association budget
to provide subscriptions for legis
lators who wish to receive the
Texan. Greg Lipscomb, Students'
Association president and author
of the bill, estimated that at least
half of the legislators would want
the subscriptions.
Meanwhile Regent Frank Er
win re-emphasized that he did not
approve sending 200 free copies
of The Texan to the Legislature
at the expense of the student
body. Earlier the Regents had
cut off all free distribution of The
Texan, including that at the Legis
lature, exchange papers, and the
annual special edition for fresh
men.
However, the Regents have since
made it clear that their original
purpose was to prohibit free dis
tribution to legislators, and not
to impose additional restrictions
on the newspaper, such as estab
lishing complex procedures for
Student Publications Board Pol
icy decisions, as had been previ
ously indicated.
Editor Charmayne Marsh writes:
"Complimentary copies were pro
hibited because this was the
broadest and most subtle means
available to separate from legisla
tors a paper which is one of the
few questioning state operations;
a paper which is regraded as lib
eral and often criticized for pre
senting an image of the Univer
sity which irritates because it is
committed to reporting the truth."
