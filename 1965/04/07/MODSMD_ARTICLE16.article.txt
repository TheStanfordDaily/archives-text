# Berkeley's GCC
## 
### 
In the meanwhile, the gradu
ates, organized into Berkeley's
own GCC, the Graduate Coordinat
ing Council (an outgrowth of the
now-dying FSM), went looking
for student support.
They found it most notably in
the person of Charlie Powell, erst
while president of the ASUC, who
is generally considered by Be r
keley students to be the top-seeded
charader of UC's oft-times incom
petent and (under normal circum
stances) unfailingly pro-adminis
tration student government.
They seem, too, to have gained
a lot of friends in the ASUC Sen
ate- the same body which, on the
night of the Berkeley sit-ins,
passed a resolution of nonsupport
for the arrested students.
With the help of the ASUC, the
graduates are today concluding
a mock election which has at
tracted more student voters than
any other election in Berkeley's
history.
And it's unlikely that all these
students have come outside just
for the weather.
Respectable "Rebels"
There seems little doubt that,
having been given the chance to
express their sentiments on an
issue that so much implies the
suppressiveness of the multiver
sity, the studentry will reply in
kind.
It seems likely, too, that gradu
ate representatives will be seated
at tonight's ASUC Senate meet
ing, against the wishes of the
Board of Regents.
And so, with a unanimity of stu
dent opinion far greater than
that ever faced by the administra
tion in wake of the December sit
ins, the student body has once
again chosen to confront the
Board of Regents.
But this time there is a differ
ence. This time, the "rebels" are
respectable.
FSM Out
They are no longer dominated
by the libertine bearded ones of
the FSM variety who, regardless
of their righteousness or lack
thereof, alienated many of their
potential bourgeois liberal sym
pathizers through their unconven
tional tactics and perhaps more
unconventional appearances.
This time their hero is short
haired, all-American Charlie
Powell, the duly-constituted rep
resentative of The Twenty-seven
Thousand.
What little internal opposition
there is comes from the ASUC
Student Judicial Council, a body
which one Senate member calls
"a self-perpetuating group of fra
ternity and sorority kids some
what. more conservative than
Barry Goldwater," and the likes
of Mike Lee, a student govern
mentalist who is perhaps better
know on this side of the Bay
for pulling a gun on several
spirited Stanfordites during last
fall's pre-Big Game activities.
The Middle Man
With student desires so strongly
aligned against the mighty Board,
the man in the middle, Meyerson,
is tottering deliciately in between.
Compromise seems unlikely;
without compromise comes con
frontation.
With confrontation come demon
strations.
And, as experience has shown,
few chancellors are allowed more
than one.

FSM Out
They are no longer dominated
by the libertine bearded ones of
the FSM variety who, regardless
of their righteousness or lack
thereof, alienated many of their
potential bourgeois liberal sym
pathizers through their unconven
tional tactics and perhaps more
unconventional appearances.
This time their hero is short
haired, all-American Charlie
Powell, the duly-constituted rep
resentative of The Twenty-seven
Thousand.
What little internal opposition
there is comes from the ASUC
Student Judicial Council, a body
which one Senate member calls
"a self-perpetuating group of fra
ternity and sorority kids some
what. more conservative than
Barry Goldwater," and the likes
of Mike Lee, a student govern
mentalist who is perhaps better
know on this side of the Bay
for pulling a gun on several
spirited Stanfordites during last
fall's pre-Big Game activities.
The Middle Man
With student desires so strongly
aligned against the mighty Board,
the man in the middle, Meyerson,
is tottering deliciately in between.
Compromise seems unlikely;
without compromise comes con
frontation.
With confrontation come demon
strations.
And, as experience has shown,
few chancellors are allowed more
than one.
In the meanwhile, the gradu
ates, organized into Berkeley's
own GCC, the Graduate Coordinat
ing Council (an outgrowth of the
now-dying FSM), went looking
for student support.
They found it most notably in
the person of Charlie Powell, erst
while president of the ASUC, who
is generally considered by Be r
keley students to be the top-seeded
charader of UC's oft-times incom
petent and (under normal circum
stances) unfailingly pro-adminis
tration student government.
They seem, too, to have gained
a lot of friends in the ASUC Sen
ate- the same body which, on the
night of the Berkeley sit-ins,
passed a resolution of nonsupport
for the arrested students.
With the help of the ASUC, the
graduates are today concluding
a mock election which has at
tracted more student voters than
any other election in Berkeley's
history.
And it's unlikely that all these
students have come outside just
for the weather.
Respectable "Rebels"
There seems little doubt that,
having been given the chance to
express their sentiments on an
issue that so much implies the
suppressiveness of the multiver
sity, the studentry will reply in
kind.
It seems likely, too, that gradu
ate representatives will be seated
at tonight's ASUC Senate meet
ing, against the wishes of the
Board of Regents.
And so, with a unanimity of stu
dent opinion far greater than
that ever faced by the administra
tion in wake of the December sit
ins, the student body has once
again chosen to confront the
Board of Regents.
But this time there is a differ
ence. This time, the "rebels" are
respectable.
