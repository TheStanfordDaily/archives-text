# Rice Editor Removed; Wouldn't Talk to Dean
## Decision Upheld: 500 Demonstrate 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
The editor of the Rice Univer
sity Thresher has been removed
from his post and put on discipli
! nary probation for "flouting the
authority of the University by
i refusing to answer a summons
! to the office of the Dean of Men
I after ample notification . . . and
! by further refusing to talk on
the telephone with the Dean."
The Dean reportedly wanted to
speak to Editor Hugh Rice Kelly
about the omission of the name of
the Thresher's faculty sponsor
1 from the staff box of the paper.
The incident occurred three
i weeks ago, and it resulted in a
demonstration by 500 Rice stu
dents, a protest and petition from
the Student Senate, and pleas
from several members of the fac
ulty. However, the President of
the University, K. S. Pitzer, re
fused to reverse the Dean's deci
sion, and yesterday acting editor
John Durham was officially
elected to fill Kelly's position.
Appeal Denied
Both the original probation and
the denial of the appeal were
made without any judicial hear
ing. The Dean, in Pitzer's words,
"was in possession of all the es-
I sential facts through his direct
knowledge; hence there was no
need to delay for investigation or
for a committee judgment of con
flicting testimony."
Kelly talked to both men, but
he was unable to have the deci
| sion reversed.
Over 1,000 students signed a
I petition which acknowledged that
| the editor did the Dean a "grave
! discourtesy" but questioned "a
disciplinary action whose effect is
to remove the editor from hi s
office, an action with indirect
overtones of suppression of the
press."
"When discourtesy is taken as
insubordination," the petition con
tinued, "it is time the students
expressed concern over the theory
and practice of discipline on the
Rice campus."
University Questioned
Acting Editor Durham also
questioned the University's han
dling of the affair.
"While the university must
i have the power to discipline stu-
I dents for misconduct, it must also
assume the responsibility of ex
ercising this power in a duly pre
scribed manner. There must be
a strict enumeration of offenses
and these offenses must be ade
quately defined. Furthermore,
there must be guarantees that due
process will be followed . . ."
As of yesterday, however, Kelly
i was still on probation (although
he will be allowed to graduate),
and Durham told The Daily that
no student demonstrations had
been held in the last two weeks.

Appeal Denied
Both the original probation and
the denial of the appeal were
made without any judicial hear
ing. The Dean, in Pitzer's words,
"was in possession of all the es-
I sential facts through his direct
knowledge; hence there was no
need to delay for investigation or
for a committee judgment of con
flicting testimony."
Kelly talked to both men, but
he was unable to have the deci
| sion reversed.
Over 1,000 students signed a
I petition which acknowledged that
| the editor did the Dean a "grave
! discourtesy" but questioned "a
disciplinary action whose effect is
to remove the editor from hi s
office, an action with indirect
overtones of suppression of the
press."
"When discourtesy is taken as
insubordination," the petition con
tinued, "it is time the students
expressed concern over the theory
and practice of discipline on the
Rice campus."
University Questioned
Acting Editor Durham also
questioned the University's han
dling of the affair.
"While the university must
i have the power to discipline stu-
I dents for misconduct, it must also
assume the responsibility of ex
ercising this power in a duly pre
scribed manner. There must be
a strict enumeration of offenses
and these offenses must be ade
quately defined. Furthermore,
there must be guarantees that due
process will be followed . . ."
As of yesterday, however, Kelly
i was still on probation (although
he will be allowed to graduate),
and Durham told The Daily that
no student demonstrations had
been held in the last two weeks.
The editor of the Rice Univer
sity Thresher has been removed
from his post and put on discipli
! nary probation for "flouting the
authority of the University by
i refusing to answer a summons
! to the office of the Dean of Men
I after ample notification . . . and
! by further refusing to talk on
the telephone with the Dean."
The Dean reportedly wanted to
speak to Editor Hugh Rice Kelly
about the omission of the name of
the Thresher's faculty sponsor
1 from the staff box of the paper.
The incident occurred three
i weeks ago, and it resulted in a
demonstration by 500 Rice stu
dents, a protest and petition from
the Student Senate, and pleas
from several members of the fac
ulty. However, the President of
the University, K. S. Pitzer, re
fused to reverse the Dean's deci
sion, and yesterday acting editor
John Durham was officially
elected to fill Kelly's position.
