# Columbia Report: College Cheating Found Rampant
## 
### 
NEW YORK (CPS)—Cheat
ing in tlu* nation's colleges
and universities is a lot more
wide spread than we like to
admit, according to a recent
survey of deans and students
conducted by Columbia Uni
versity.
The survey, which was
made in the wake of a cheat
ing scandal at the U.S. Air
Force Academy which ap
parently involved over 100
cadets revealed that:
—The amount of academic
dishonesty in col le^e is
"grossly underestimated" by
students, student body presi
dents, and deans.
—Only a small proportion
of those who cheat are caught
and punished.
—Schools with honor sys
tems are less apt to have a
high level of cheating th a n
those with other arrange
ments for control.
—Elements of school qual
ity are associated with low
levels of cheating.
The report said that per
haps the "most alarming find
ing" concerned "the preva
lence of academic dishonesty
on American college cam
puses." It said that "at least
half the students in the
sample have engaged in some
form of academic dishonesty
since coming to college," and
termed this a conservative
estimate.
The report said that only
a relatively small percentage
of the cheaters are caught
and punished, and in most
cases, only lenient punish
ments are given out.
"Seldom are students sus
pended or dismissed for vio
lating norms of academic in
tegrity, despite the fact that
authorities consider this a

serious disciplinary viola
tion," it said.
The report said that "those
who have difficulty adjusting
to the role of student as evi
denced by poor study habits
and low grades, are indeed
more likely to cheat than the
good students . . . ," but
"when we control for other
factors associated with cheat
ing in college, academic per
formance has only a minor
effect.
"Those who value the social
aspects of college life are
more apt to cheat than those
who emphasize intellectual
interests and activities, even
when we take their academic
performance into account,"
it said.
It said the important thing
was that one's "fellow stu
dents disapprove of cheating,"
and sa i d "normative con
straints from peers" have a
much greater effect on cheat
ing than do "personal-value
orientations toward college
adjustment to academic de
mands."
The report said, however,
that cheating was less likely
to occur at smaller colleges
with a low faculty-student ra
tio and high academic stan
dards than at a big school.
Highly selective schools also
appear to have less cheating
than others.
It said that "the level of
cheating is much lower at
schools that place primary
responsibility for dealing with
cases of academic dishonesty
in the hands of the students
and their elected representa
tives, as under the honor sys
tem, than at schools that rely
on faculty-centered control
or have a form of mixed con
trol, in which faculty and
students jointly participate."

on American college cam
puses." It said that "at least
half the students in the
sample have engaged in some
form of academic dishonesty
since coming to college," and
termed this a conservative
estimate.
The report said that only
a relatively small percentage
of the cheaters are caught
and punished, and in most
cases, only lenient punish
ments are given out.
"Seldom are students sus
pended or dismissed for vio
lating norms of academic in
tegrity, despite the fact that
authorities consider this a

serious disciplinary viola
tion," it said.
The report said that "those
who have difficulty adjusting
to the role of student as evi
denced by poor study habits
and low grades, are indeed
more likely to cheat than the
good students . . . ," but
"when we control for other
factors associated with cheat
ing in college, academic per
formance has only a minor
effect.
"Those who value the social
aspects of college life are
more apt to cheat than those
who emphasize intellectual
interests and activities, even
when we take their academic
performance into account,"
it said.
It said the important thing
was that one's "fellow stu
dents disapprove of cheating,"
and sa i d "normative con
straints from peers" have a
much greater effect on cheat
ing than do "personal-value
orientations toward college
adjustment to academic de
mands."
The report said, however,
that cheating was less likely
to occur at smaller colleges
with a low faculty-student ra
tio and high academic stan
dards than at a big school.
Highly selective schools also
appear to have less cheating
than others.
It said that "the level of
cheating is much lower at
schools that place primary
responsibility for dealing with
cases of academic dishonesty
in the hands of the students
and their elected representa
tives, as under the honor sys
tem, than at schools that rely
on faculty-centered control
or have a form of mixed con
trol, in which faculty and
students jointly participate."
NEW YORK (CPS)—Cheat
ing in tlu* nation's colleges
and universities is a lot more
wide spread than we like to
admit, according to a recent
survey of deans and students
conducted by Columbia Uni
versity.
The survey, which was
made in the wake of a cheat
ing scandal at the U.S. Air
Force Academy which ap
parently involved over 100
cadets revealed that:
—The amount of academic
dishonesty in col le^e is
"grossly underestimated" by
students, student body presi
dents, and deans.
—Only a small proportion
of those who cheat are caught
and punished.
—Schools with honor sys
tems are less apt to have a
high level of cheating th a n
those with other arrange
ments for control.
—Elements of school qual
ity are associated with low
levels of cheating.
