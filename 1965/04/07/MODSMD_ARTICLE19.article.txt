MSU Offers Experimental Program
EAST LANSING, Michigan (CPS) — Michigan Stale University
students will have an opportunity to obtain a liberal education in a
small college setting and still have the advantages of a large univer
sity under an experimental program approved recently by MSU's
Board of Trustees.
The program centers around the establishment of a new, semi
autonomous experimental college which will be limited to a maxi
mum of 1,000 to 1,100 students. The first class will consist of about
400 freshmen, Provost Howard R. Neville explained.
A special committee has suggested that the program of the ex
perimental college be committed to a broad liberal education with
an in-depth study of a specific field. The broad liberal education would
center around a substantial core of required courses.
Newest Protest Form: The Camp Out
COLLEGE PARK, Maryland (CPS) — Camping out has finally
joined sitting in as a protest gesture.
Two University of Maryland students who were refused admis
sion to a camping course spent a recent night in sleeping bags on
the mall in front of Maryland's library. They were protesting the
physical education department's policy of closing certain courses,
like camping, to students who are not majors in physical education.
The students —the president of a men's dormitory and editor of
its newspaper—said they slppt well except for the penetrating cold,
puddles from a day's worth of rain and snow, and the glare from a
Diamondback photographer's flashbulb.
Students Protest 'Forced Resignation'
CHICAGO (CPSi Students at Chicago's Art Institute have!
begun a class strike following the sudden resignation of Norman B.
Boothby, popular dean of the art institute school. Students said that
his resignation was forced.
A count last Tuesday showed that of the 559 students scheduled
to lie in class only 40 appeared. Nearly 100 of the students who re
fused to attend class picketed in front of the school; dressed in suits,
they demonstrated without incident.
The Aft Institute said that Boothby was asked to resign because !
he was unable to handle the "staggering administrative load." George |
B. Young, vice president of the Board of Trustees of the Institute!
said, "Administration was not his strongest point."
Meanwhile, 70 of the Institute's 114 teachers have met with ad
ministration officials to announce their intention of joining the Amer- !
icon Federation of Teachers. There arc 950 full-time students enrolled j
at the school.
