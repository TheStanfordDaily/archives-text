and Frank Duffy collected a
triple and single.
Papooses Are 9-1
Stanford has a 9-1 league rec
ord; Santa Clara trails at 4-1. The

this Friday and at Sunken Dia
mond on Saturday. The series

The freshmen's first two runs
came in the third inning, Martin,
I Rich Werschkul, and Mike Scho-
I maker reached base on an error,
I a walk, and a fielder's choice in
which Martin was thrown out at
third. Then Greg Taylor swatted
a run-scoring single, and Lewis
smashed a line drive that bounced
! once in the infield and almost
killed the second baseman. Lewis
j was somehow thrown out at first,
i but a run scored.
