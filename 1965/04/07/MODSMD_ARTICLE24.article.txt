# TRIBE DOWNS UCLA, 79-66
## Trackmen Barely Win 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's weary trackmen
i barely survived an upset bid by
UCLA yesterday, as ihey rallied
j to defeat the Bruins, 79-66, in t ho
: Los Angeles Coliseum. The meel
had been scheduled for Saturday,
j bul was postponed by rain.
The win kept Stanford unde
feated. The Indians will face pow
erful USC in a traditional show
down Saturday in Stanford Sta-
I dium.
UCLA's Bob Day and Stanford's
! Paul Schlicke provided the day's
; finest duels. Day held off Schlicke
i in the mile to win in 4:02.8, a n d
j also beat him in the Iwo-mile, in
18:49.0. Day's two wins were the
: fastest collegiate "double" of the
| year. Schlicke ran 4:05.7 in the
I mile, his best this year, and set
1 a Stanford record in ihe two-mile,
I with an 8:51.4 clocking.
Only 100 Spectators
The day was cloudy and brisk,
i and the track was slightly mushy.
! Only 100 die-hard track fans
showed up to watch.
Several upsets early in the meet
put Stanford behind by 15 points.
The Indians closed the gap to 10
I with only a few events remain
j ing. Then Bud Walsh, Bob Mc
; Intyre, and John Goode swept
j the broad jump, and Bob Stoecker
and Tyler Wilkins placed 1-2 in
i the discus, boosting Stanford over
'the magic 73-point mark, which
clinches the meet.
Card sprinter Larry Questad
i remained unbeaten in ihe 100-yard
I dash, edging UCLA's Len Dodson
; in 9.6 seconds. Questad also won
i Ihe 220 in 21.5 to Dodson's 21.6.
Other Stanford favorites didn't
! fare so well. Ken Fraser ran a
J slow 48.7 in the 440 and was a
I distant third. Bruce Wilhelm had

an off day, and had to rely on
his last try 1o place third in the
shot put.
Smith Injures Muscle
Chuck Smith, Stanford record
holder in the pole vault, injure ! a
leg muscle in warming up and
didn't compete. Jim Eshelman
won the event, anyway, for the
Indians, at 15-0.
Greg Ford and Bud Walsh led
in the 330-yard hurdles, but both
stumbled oxer the final hurdle to
let favored Roger Johnson win
for UCLA. Ford ran 37.5 and
Walsh 37.8, their best times ever.
Ford nipped Johnson in the 120-
yard hurdles in 14.9.
The Indians easily captured
both relays, winning the 110 re
lay in 41.1. The mile relay squad
mistakenly thought that the
meet's outcome depended on them,
and so they blazed to a 10-yard
victory in 3:14.5, nearly two sec
onds better than their previous
best.
< Inteh Victory
A clutch performance by triple
jumper Art Miller helped stave
off a Uclan victory. Miller
bounded past a tightly bunched
jumping field to win with an ap
proximate 45-6 effort.
It was t he fourth straight Stan
ford track victory over UCLA.
Saturday's opponent. IJSC, has
beaten Stanford 28 straight times.

UCLA yesterday, as ihey rallied
j to defeat the Bruins, 79-66, in t ho
: Los Angeles Coliseum. The meel
had been scheduled for Saturday,

The win kept Stanford unde
feated. The Indians will face pow
erful USC in a traditional show
down Saturday in Stanford Sta-
I dium.
UCLA's Bob Day and Stanford's
! Paul Schlicke provided the day's
; finest duels. Day held off Schlicke
i in the mile to win in 4:02.8, a n d
j also beat him in the Iwo-mile, in
18:49.0. Day's two wins were the
: fastest collegiate "double" of the
| year. Schlicke ran 4:05.7 in the
I mile, his best this year, and set
1 a Stanford record in ihe two-mile,
I with an 8:51.4 clocking.
Only 100 Spectators
The day was cloudy and brisk,
i and the track was slightly mushy.
! Only 100 die-hard track fans
showed up to watch.
Several upsets early in the meet
put Stanford behind by 15 points.
The Indians closed the gap to 10
I with only a few events remain
j ing. Then Bud Walsh, Bob Mc
; Intyre, and John Goode swept
j the broad jump, and Bob Stoecker
and Tyler Wilkins placed 1-2 in
i the discus, boosting Stanford over
'the magic 73-point mark, which
clinches the meet.
Card sprinter Larry Questad
i remained unbeaten in ihe 100-yard
I dash, edging UCLA's Len Dodson
; in 9.6 seconds. Questad also won
i Ihe 220 in 21.5 to Dodson's 21.6.
Other Stanford favorites didn't
! fare so well. Ken Fraser ran a
J slow 48.7 in the 440 and was a
I distant third. Bruce Wilhelm had

an off day, and had to rely on
his last try 1o place third in the
shot put.
Smith Injures Muscle
Chuck Smith, Stanford record
holder in the pole vault, injure ! a
leg muscle in warming up and
didn't compete. Jim Eshelman
won the event, anyway, for the
Indians, at 15-0.
Greg Ford and Bud Walsh led
in the 330-yard hurdles, but both
stumbled oxer the final hurdle to
let favored Roger Johnson win
for UCLA. Ford ran 37.5 and
Walsh 37.8, their best times ever.
Ford nipped Johnson in the 120-
yard hurdles in 14.9.
The Indians easily captured
both relays, winning the 110 re
lay in 41.1. The mile relay squad
mistakenly thought that the
meet's outcome depended on them,
and so they blazed to a 10-yard
victory in 3:14.5, nearly two sec
onds better than their previous
best.
< Inteh Victory
A clutch performance by triple
jumper Art Miller helped stave
off a Uclan victory. Miller
bounded past a tightly bunched
jumping field to win with an ap
proximate 45-6 effort.
It was t he fourth straight Stan
ford track victory over UCLA.
Saturday's opponent. IJSC, has
beaten Stanford 28 straight times.

put Stanford behind by 15 points.
The Indians closed the gap to 10
I with only a few events remain
j ing. Then Bud Walsh, Bob Mc
; Intyre, and John Goode swept
j the broad jump, and Bob Stoecker
and Tyler Wilkins placed 1-2 in
i the discus, boosting Stanford over
'the magic 73-point mark, which
clinches the meet.
Card sprinter Larry Questad
i remained unbeaten in ihe 100-yard
I dash, edging UCLA's Len Dodson
; in 9.6 seconds. Questad also won
i Ihe 220 in 21.5 to Dodson's 21.6.
Other Stanford favorites didn't
! fare so well. Ken Fraser ran a
J slow 48.7 in the 440 and was a
I distant third. Bruce Wilhelm had

an off day, and had to rely on
his last try 1o place third in the
shot put.
Smith Injures Muscle
Chuck Smith, Stanford record
holder in the pole vault, injure ! a
leg muscle in warming up and
didn't compete. Jim Eshelman
won the event, anyway, for the
Indians, at 15-0.
Greg Ford and Bud Walsh led
in the 330-yard hurdles, but both
stumbled oxer the final hurdle to
let favored Roger Johnson win
for UCLA. Ford ran 37.5 and
Walsh 37.8, their best times ever.
Ford nipped Johnson in the 120-
yard hurdles in 14.9.
The Indians easily captured
both relays, winning the 110 re
lay in 41.1. The mile relay squad
mistakenly thought that the
meet's outcome depended on them,
and so they blazed to a 10-yard
victory in 3:14.5, nearly two sec
onds better than their previous
best.
< Inteh Victory
A clutch performance by triple
jumper Art Miller helped stave
off a Uclan victory. Miller
bounded past a tightly bunched
jumping field to win with an ap
proximate 45-6 effort.
It was t he fourth straight Stan
ford track victory over UCLA.
Saturday's opponent. IJSC, has
beaten Stanford 28 straight times.

Stanford's weary trackmen
i barely survived an upset bid by
UCLA yesterday, as ihey rallied
j to defeat the Bruins, 79-66, in t ho
: Los Angeles Coliseum. The meel
had been scheduled for Saturday,
j bul was postponed by rain.
The win kept Stanford unde
feated. The Indians will face pow
erful USC in a traditional show
down Saturday in Stanford Sta-
I dium.
UCLA's Bob Day and Stanford's
! Paul Schlicke provided the day's
; finest duels. Day held off Schlicke
i in the mile to win in 4:02.8, a n d
j also beat him in the Iwo-mile, in
18:49.0. Day's two wins were the
: fastest collegiate "double" of the
| year. Schlicke ran 4:05.7 in the
I mile, his best this year, and set
1 a Stanford record in ihe two-mile,
I with an 8:51.4 clocking.
Only 100 Spectators
The day was cloudy and brisk,
i and the track was slightly mushy.
! Only 100 die-hard track fans
showed up to watch.
Several upsets early in the meet
put Stanford behind by 15 points.
The Indians closed the gap to 10
I with only a few events remain
j ing. Then Bud Walsh, Bob Mc
; Intyre, and John Goode swept
j the broad jump, and Bob Stoecker
and Tyler Wilkins placed 1-2 in
i the discus, boosting Stanford over
'the magic 73-point mark, which
clinches the meet.
Card sprinter Larry Questad
i remained unbeaten in ihe 100-yard
I dash, edging UCLA's Len Dodson
; in 9.6 seconds. Questad also won
i Ihe 220 in 21.5 to Dodson's 21.6.
Other Stanford favorites didn't
! fare so well. Ken Fraser ran a
J slow 48.7 in the 440 and was a
I distant third. Bruce Wilhelm had

an off day, and had to rely on
his last try 1o place third in the
shot put.
Smith Injures Muscle
Chuck Smith, Stanford record
holder in the pole vault, injure ! a
leg muscle in warming up and
didn't compete. Jim Eshelman
won the event, anyway, for the
Indians, at 15-0.
Greg Ford and Bud Walsh led
in the 330-yard hurdles, but both
stumbled oxer the final hurdle to
let favored Roger Johnson win
for UCLA. Ford ran 37.5 and
Walsh 37.8, their best times ever.
Ford nipped Johnson in the 120-
yard hurdles in 14.9.
The Indians easily captured
both relays, winning the 110 re
lay in 41.1. The mile relay squad
mistakenly thought that the
meet's outcome depended on them,
and so they blazed to a 10-yard
victory in 3:14.5, nearly two sec
onds better than their previous
best.
< Inteh Victory
A clutch performance by triple
jumper Art Miller helped stave
off a Uclan victory. Miller
bounded past a tightly bunched
jumping field to win with an ap
proximate 45-6 effort.
It was t he fourth straight Stan
ford track victory over UCLA.
Saturday's opponent. IJSC, has
beaten Stanford 28 straight times.
