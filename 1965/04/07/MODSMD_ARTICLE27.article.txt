# Letters To The Editor
## An Open Letter to IFC President 
### 
IFC President :
It seems that your letter of yes
terday centered around two main
points. First you say that fraterni
ties are in fact already moving
in the directions urged in "A Sec
ond Look." (e.g., you say they
are developing a new rush policy
which will "decrease superficial
ity and pressure in the future,"
"initiation procedures which are
constructive and rewarding," and
"an attempt to improve fraternity
scholarship.")
You then go on to say that
these changes must not occur too
quickly lest we "damage the foun
dations of the fraternity concept."
Perhaps it would be helpful to
Freshmen now confronted with
rush for you to explain more ex
actly just what are "the founda
tions of the fraternity concept."
Are they the attempt to develop
the whole individual, the attempt
to integrate living groups into the
academic environment of the Uni
versity, the attempt to provide
opportunities for the fullest pos
sible development of widespread
interests of house members? If so,
this is commendable, but what is
distinctive abo u t fraternities?
How do these aims differ from
the aims of Stern or Wilbur or
the University as a whole?
Are they merely an orientation
toward a higher degree of social
activity? Do they offer a further
escape from the classroom? If so,
how valuable are these?
Or does the foundation of the
fraternity concept rest on unani
mous or virtually unanimous
selection of members? If so.
should it he? How does this affect
the first mentioned set of goals?
We do not think that these
questions are so terribly difficult
or that their answers will be
necessarily detrimental to fra
ternities. We do think that fra
ternity men have an obligation to
answer them.

• Pacifism
Editor, The Daily:
I have some questions for the
pacifists recently active on cam
pus which show that what I call
"naive pacifism" and "extreme
militarism" are untenable, a n d
that any tenable theory of "con
structive pacifism" must include
some principles of "reasoned mili
tarism."

The usual rejoinders to "naive
pacifism," i.e., always going limp
in the face of all hostility, are to
ask such questions as, "Did going
limp help the six million Jews in
Germany?", "Should the United
States have gone limp after Pearl
Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941?", and
"Should a mother upon seeing a
man about to injure or steal her
child be passive and phone for
an arbitrator?"
On the other hand, extreme
militarism is not a reasonable
alternative men would be spill
ing blood in a barbaristic state of
fighting like animals. ... if any
survived the radioactive fallout.
A tenable theory of pacifism
must suggest effective means to
guarantee peace and at the same
time provide means both to set
tle domestic and international dis
putes and to enforce those settle
ments. In the past duels and wars
have been employed for those
purposes.
To say that killing is morally
wrong and to assert that univer
sal pacifism has never been tried
do not prove that it can work in
our imperfect world. In order for
pacifism to work either the vast
majority of men must be calm
and reasonable (is this likely?)
or you must provide a deterrent
to lawbreaking and to war, which
suggests the following dilemma:
If we discarded all means for pro
ducing nuclear bombs, the threat
of immediate annihilation by an
accidental or malicious push of
"the button" would be eliminated.
But if the H-bombs were gone,
men would no longer be afraid to
stir up old disputes and would
once again resort to "limited"
wars. So it seems that the possibil
ity of immediate annihilation,
ironically, has been the only effec
tive deterrent to world-wide war
that man has yet invented!
Can chastisement be an effec
tive deterrent to lawbreaking and
to war? Economic pressure is an
alternative deterrent, but is it not
possible that a starving nation will
not wish to engage in polite, gen
tile chit-chat? Wasn't economic
pressure a major cause of World
War II?
Can the West immediately lay
down arms after the recent re
iteration of Red China that they
do not believe in peaceful coex
istence? After their refusal to
sign the test-ban treaty? And
while they are continuing to shell
the off-shore islands? Disarma
ment and going limp by only one
of the parties works only when
you have relatively benevolent
enemies, which are scarce.
But progress is being made
along pacifistic lines: a test-ban
treaty has been signed, it h a s

been 20 years since a world war,
non-violence has worked in th e
south, many countries abide by
many of the decisions of the
United Nations, and several peace
conferences have succeeded. There
is hope, notwithstanding the hy
steric cries of those saying thai
the world will soon come to an
end as a result of "the button."
These are signs that, paeifistic
means can work, but pacifism is
safe only when resort to it is
universal — there have been too
many mad dictators to rely on it
otherwise, just as it is dangerous
to rely on "the button" as a de
terrent.
In Viet Nam there is a possibil
ity that paeifistic goals will soon
be achieved — there is hope for
a peace conference (which worked
in Laos), self-determinative elec
tions, and reversion of military aid
to technical and medical aid. But
would pacifistic goals be achieved
if as soon as we withdrew, the
Viet Cong stepped up their fight
ing to full-scale war? Is an en
forced peace worse than free bat
tle, pacifists?
Of course, other principles such
as "freedom of self-determina
tion" can justify letting them
fight their own battles, but is that
pacifism? Would Viet Cong at
tacks (non-pacifism) on Ameri
can bases have ceased if we had
not retaliated with a "strike for
a strike" theory? Did our prior
scolding do any good?
Mr. Sandperl and Mr. Kepler
are effective in that they admir
ably focus attention on alterna
tives to war. but they must not
delude us into thinking that there
would be instantaneous harmony
if all American soldiers wo u 1 d
simply cast aside their guns and
sing with Joan Baez. They have
humanitarian ideals, but pacifism
must be adapted to human nature,
which is not ideal.

• Bookstore Defended
Editor, The Daily:
Robert Anderson's criticism of
the mechanics of book ordering in
the Stanford bookstore is cer
tainly valid, but not the fault, I
believe, of the store. The Univer
sity does not release, or even uti
lize, pre-reg enrollment statistics,
so there is no real way of antici
pating class enrollments, hence
no sure way to order adequate
books. And, since the architects
or planners omitted storage
space, the bookstore cannot err
on the generous side in their or
dering.
