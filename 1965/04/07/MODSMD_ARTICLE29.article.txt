## US, Red Policies Preclude Negotiations in Vietnam 
### Walter Lippmann 
The cardinal defect of the administration's conduct of the war
in Indo-China has been pointed ont hy Republican Sen. John Sher
man Cooper of Kentucky. In a statement last week (March 25),
Sen. Cooper said that the U.S. government, like its adversaries in
Peking and Hanoi, is "prescribing conditions as a prerequisite to
negotiations which will not be ae-+

cepted."
The Communists are making it
a condition of a negotiation that
the United States must withdraw
from Vietnam; we are making it
a condition of a negotiation that
North Vietnam must withdraw
from South Vietnam. This is.
said Sen. Cooper, "a kind of de
mand from both sides for uncon
ditional surrender."
It is, therefore, highly impor
tant that the administration put
itself in a position where negotia
tion is possible, granting that even
if it did so Hanoi and Peking may
gamble on winning the war in
order to overrun South Vietnam
and inflict a smashing defeat on
the United States. But regardless
of what they do, we must come
into court with clean hands. The
administration needs to clarify
its own position in order to set
in motloi m movement for nego
tiation and failing that. 1o put the
onus of oro'origirg and widening
die 1 war unmistakably on our ad
versaries.
A Willingness To Negotiate?
There is a mistaken impression
in this country that we are ready
and willing to negotiate but that
the other side is imposing intoler
able conditions namely, that
we should withdraw our forces be
fore the negotiation begins. Sen.
Cooper rejects the Communist
condition, as do all of us who have
been actively interested in th is
question. We cannot withdraw our
forces until there has been a poli
tical settlement in Indo-China, a
settlement which promises to last
because it serves the primary in
terests of all concerned.
But what, as a matter of fact,
is our position? It is that before
negotiations can take place, the
North must demonstrate its readi
ness "to leave its neighbors
alone." Secretary of State Dean
Rusk has avoided a precise defi
nition of that phrase. We know
that "illegal infiltration of mili
tary personnel and arms" is con
sidered to violate that condition.
Sen. Cooper says of this posi
tion: "1 think it unlikely that the
Communists will agree to this
condition for negotiations as we
will not agree to their condition
that the United States withdraw."
What Son. Cooper is asking the
administration to do is what was
done in the Korean War: "No
such conditions were imposed by
either side prior to negotiations,
but a cease fire was sought." Un
til the administration comes
around to this position, its diplo
macy will be confused.

' The Essentials of 1954'
Last week (March 25) the Presi
dent issued a statement that "we
■ have said many times to all who
iare interested in our principles
j for honorable negotiation — that
Iwe seek no more than a return
jto the essentials of 1954 a reli
able arrangement to guarantee
the independence and security of
all in Southeast Asia."
i This is rather puzzling. The
agreements of 1954 were reached
jat Geneva at a conference at
which there participated not only
; the Indo-Chinese states but also
Russia, Red Chin a, Britain,
[France and the United States.
The agreements ended the fight
ing between the French Union
forces and the Viet Minh in Laos,
Cambodia and Vietnam. These
| states were to become independent
countries, with Vietnam parti
tioned at the 17th parallel into
two zones pending general "free
(elections" to be held by Jan. 20,
! 1956.
The cease fire agreement was
j signed by the military comman
ders. But in addition, the Geneva
! Conference issued a final declara
tion, dated July 21. This declara
tion contained the following prin
ciples of the settlement. One of
j the principles was that the cease
! fire prohibited "introduction into
1 Vietnam of foreign troops and
j military personnel as well as of
all kinds of arms and munitions."
! Concerning Elections In Vietnam
The United States did not sign
i the final declaration. But the un
| dersecretary of state, Gen. Bedell
i Smith, made a "unilateral declara
tion" which said that the United
I States supported the agreements
and that "in connection with the
statement in the declaration con
cerning free elections in Vietnam,
my government wishes to make
clear its position which it has ex
pressed in a declaration made in
Washington on June 29, 19(51, as
; follows: 'In the case of nations
now divided against their will, we
shall continue to seek to achieve
| unity through free elections super
| vised by the United Nations to
| insure that they are conducted
fairly.'"
Considering the essentials of
the 1964 agreements, it is not easy
to understand what it means to
say now that "we seek no more
than a return to the essscntials
of the agreements of 1954." I am
afraid it means that in the diplo
matic conduct of the war in Viet
nam, the diplomatists have not
been doing their homework.

Peking and Hanoi, is "prescribing conditions as a prerequisite to
negotiations which will not be ae-+

cepted."
The Communists are making it
a condition of a negotiation that
the United States must withdraw
from Vietnam; we are making it
a condition of a negotiation that
North Vietnam must withdraw
from South Vietnam. This is.
said Sen. Cooper, "a kind of de
mand from both sides for uncon
ditional surrender."
It is, therefore, highly impor
tant that the administration put
itself in a position where negotia
tion is possible, granting that even
if it did so Hanoi and Peking may
gamble on winning the war in
order to overrun South Vietnam
and inflict a smashing defeat on
the United States. But regardless
of what they do, we must come
into court with clean hands. The
administration needs to clarify
its own position in order to set
in motloi m movement for nego
tiation and failing that. 1o put the
onus of oro'origirg and widening
die 1 war unmistakably on our ad
versaries.
A Willingness To Negotiate?
There is a mistaken impression
in this country that we are ready
and willing to negotiate but that
the other side is imposing intoler
able conditions namely, that
we should withdraw our forces be
fore the negotiation begins. Sen.
Cooper rejects the Communist
condition, as do all of us who have
been actively interested in th is
question. We cannot withdraw our
forces until there has been a poli
tical settlement in Indo-China, a
settlement which promises to last
because it serves the primary in
terests of all concerned.
But what, as a matter of fact,
is our position? It is that before
negotiations can take place, the
North must demonstrate its readi
ness "to leave its neighbors
alone." Secretary of State Dean
Rusk has avoided a precise defi
nition of that phrase. We know
that "illegal infiltration of mili
tary personnel and arms" is con
sidered to violate that condition.
Sen. Cooper says of this posi
tion: "1 think it unlikely that the
Communists will agree to this
condition for negotiations as we
will not agree to their condition
that the United States withdraw."
What Son. Cooper is asking the
administration to do is what was
done in the Korean War: "No
such conditions were imposed by
either side prior to negotiations,
but a cease fire was sought." Un
til the administration comes
around to this position, its diplo
macy will be confused.

' The Essentials of 1954'
Last week (March 25) the Presi
dent issued a statement that "we
■ have said many times to all who
iare interested in our principles
j for honorable negotiation — that
Iwe seek no more than a return
jto the essentials of 1954 a reli
able arrangement to guarantee
the independence and security of
all in Southeast Asia."
i This is rather puzzling. The
agreements of 1954 were reached
jat Geneva at a conference at
which there participated not only
; the Indo-Chinese states but also
Russia, Red Chin a, Britain,
[France and the United States.
The agreements ended the fight
ing between the French Union
forces and the Viet Minh in Laos,
Cambodia and Vietnam. These
| states were to become independent
countries, with Vietnam parti
tioned at the 17th parallel into
two zones pending general "free
(elections" to be held by Jan. 20,
! 1956.
The cease fire agreement was
j signed by the military comman
ders. But in addition, the Geneva
! Conference issued a final declara
tion, dated July 21. This declara
tion contained the following prin
ciples of the settlement. One of
j the principles was that the cease
! fire prohibited "introduction into
1 Vietnam of foreign troops and
j military personnel as well as of
all kinds of arms and munitions."
! Concerning Elections In Vietnam
The United States did not sign
i the final declaration. But the un
| dersecretary of state, Gen. Bedell
i Smith, made a "unilateral declara
tion" which said that the United
I States supported the agreements
and that "in connection with the
statement in the declaration con
cerning free elections in Vietnam,
my government wishes to make
clear its position which it has ex
pressed in a declaration made in
Washington on June 29, 19(51, as
; follows: 'In the case of nations
now divided against their will, we
shall continue to seek to achieve
| unity through free elections super
| vised by the United Nations to
| insure that they are conducted
fairly.'"
Considering the essentials of
the 1964 agreements, it is not easy
to understand what it means to
say now that "we seek no more
than a return to the essscntials
of the agreements of 1954." I am
afraid it means that in the diplo
matic conduct of the war in Viet

a condition of a negotiation that
North Vietnam must withdraw
from South Vietnam. This is.
said Sen. Cooper, "a kind of de
mand from both sides for uncon
ditional surrender."
It is, therefore, highly impor
tant that the administration put
itself in a position where negotia
tion is possible, granting that even
if it did so Hanoi and Peking may
gamble on winning the war in
order to overrun South Vietnam
and inflict a smashing defeat on
the United States. But regardless
of what they do, we must come
into court with clean hands. The
administration needs to clarify
its own position in order to set
in motloi m movement for nego
tiation and failing that. 1o put the
onus of oro'origirg and widening
die 1 war unmistakably on our ad
versaries.
A Willingness To Negotiate?
There is a mistaken impression
in this country that we are ready
and willing to negotiate but that
the other side is imposing intoler
able conditions namely, that
we should withdraw our forces be
fore the negotiation begins. Sen.
Cooper rejects the Communist
condition, as do all of us who have
been actively interested in th is
question. We cannot withdraw our
forces until there has been a poli
tical settlement in Indo-China, a
settlement which promises to last
because it serves the primary in
terests of all concerned.
But what, as a matter of fact,
is our position? It is that before
negotiations can take place, the
North must demonstrate its readi
ness "to leave its neighbors
alone." Secretary of State Dean
Rusk has avoided a precise defi
nition of that phrase. We know
that "illegal infiltration of mili
tary personnel and arms" is con
sidered to violate that condition.
Sen. Cooper says of this posi
tion: "1 think it unlikely that the
Communists will agree to this
condition for negotiations as we
will not agree to their condition
that the United States withdraw."
What Son. Cooper is asking the
administration to do is what was
done in the Korean War: "No
such conditions were imposed by
either side prior to negotiations,
but a cease fire was sought." Un
til the administration comes
around to this position, its diplo
macy will be confused.

' The Essentials of 1954'
Last week (March 25) the Presi
dent issued a statement that "we
■ have said many times to all who
iare interested in our principles
j for honorable negotiation — that
Iwe seek no more than a return
jto the essentials of 1954 a reli
able arrangement to guarantee
the independence and security of
all in Southeast Asia."
i This is rather puzzling. The
agreements of 1954 were reached
jat Geneva at a conference at
which there participated not only
; the Indo-Chinese states but also
Russia, Red Chin a, Britain,
[France and the United States.
The agreements ended the fight
ing between the French Union
forces and the Viet Minh in Laos,
Cambodia and Vietnam. These
| states were to become independent
countries, with Vietnam parti
tioned at the 17th parallel into
two zones pending general "free
(elections" to be held by Jan. 20,
! 1956.
The cease fire agreement was
j signed by the military comman
ders. But in addition, the Geneva
! Conference issued a final declara
tion, dated July 21. This declara
tion contained the following prin
ciples of the settlement. One of
j the principles was that the cease
! fire prohibited "introduction into
1 Vietnam of foreign troops and
j military personnel as well as of
all kinds of arms and munitions."
! Concerning Elections In Vietnam
The United States did not sign
i the final declaration. But the un
| dersecretary of state, Gen. Bedell
i Smith, made a "unilateral declara
tion" which said that the United
I States supported the agreements
and that "in connection with the
statement in the declaration con
cerning free elections in Vietnam,
my government wishes to make
clear its position which it has ex
pressed in a declaration made in
Washington on June 29, 19(51, as
; follows: 'In the case of nations
now divided against their will, we
shall continue to seek to achieve
| unity through free elections super
| vised by the United Nations to
| insure that they are conducted
fairly.'"
Considering the essentials of
the 1964 agreements, it is not easy
to understand what it means to
say now that "we seek no more
than a return to the essscntials
of the agreements of 1954." I am
afraid it means that in the diplo
matic conduct of the war in Viet
nam, the diplomatists have not
been doing their homework.
The cardinal defect of the administration's conduct of the war
in Indo-China has been pointed ont hy Republican Sen. John Sher
man Cooper of Kentucky. In a statement last week (March 25),
Sen. Cooper said that the U.S. government, like its adversaries in
Peking and Hanoi, is "prescribing conditions as a prerequisite to
negotiations which will not be ae-+

cepted."
The Communists are making it
a condition of a negotiation that
the United States must withdraw
from Vietnam; we are making it
a condition of a negotiation that
North Vietnam must withdraw
from South Vietnam. This is.
