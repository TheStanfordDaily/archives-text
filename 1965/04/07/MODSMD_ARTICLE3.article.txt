# Student Body to Vote on Constitutional Amendment
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
A constitutional amendment reorganizing the offices of ASSU
President and Vice-President will go before the student body in
a special general election next week.
The amendment, already passed in the Legislature with only
two negative votes, would substantially alter the office of Vice-

President, revise the method of
succession to the Presidency, and
clarify several of the powers of
both officers.
Two-thirds of those voting
must approve the amendment be
fore it can be sent to President J.
E. Wallace Sterling's office for
final consideration.
"The bill is not controversial,"
Chuck Ludlam, chairman of the

LASSU committee on Executive
Reorganization, told The Daily,;
"and we encountered few objec-1
tions to it either in committee or i
on the floor of the Legislature." <
Increased Authority
Both Scott Mcßride, ASSU i
President, and Mary Ann Ode- i
gaard, the current Vice-President,
favor the proposed revision.
Under the amendment, the
office of Vice-President would
have greatly enhanced authority.!
Presently, the Vice-President, "ad-;
ministers and coordinates the,
social program of the association" j
and keeps "the calcndar«of events ;
for student organizations and liv-j
intf groups." Under the new j
amendment, he would be primar- j
ily responsible for the administra- j
tivc tasks of the Executive office.
The Vice-President is to be re
sponsible for the execution of the
Legislature's policy concerning
the ASSU Boards and Commission
and, thus, will have a vote on
each of these bodies.
The President, meanwhile, will j
lose his vote on these boards.
"We want to kick him upstairs," j
Ludlam said.
Presidential Duties
"The committee fell that the
President should !>r> primarily
concerned with his duties as the!
leader of the student body, as j
liaison between the students and
the administration and faculty. !
and as a policy initiator," Ludlam
added.
Also included in ihe amend
ment is a new means of choosing
a successor for a President who
is unable to serve his whole term.
Presently, a general election must
be called to fill the vacated posi
tion.
The proposed amendment would
make the Vice-President the auto
matie successor.
"Under the present system, this
would not be feasible," Ludlam
explained, "because the Vice-
President's powers and duties are
totally dissimilar from those of
the President. The amendment
would assure that the continuity

of (ho Executive Branch was
maintained and that the best
qualified individual would assume
the vacant post."
Finally, the amendment clari
fies the responsibilities of the
President. The phrase "and
i duties" was added to the word
! "powers" to change the tone of
the section dealing with the Presi-
I dent's authority.
Meßride praised the amendment,
[especially because it gave the
Vice-President "some specific and
well-defined duties."
"Right now," he added, "th e
President delegates the duties;
usually, that means that the Vice-
President is left to utilize her own
personal initiative."

Two-thirds of those voting
must approve the amendment be
fore it can be sent to President J.
E. Wallace Sterling's office for
final consideration.
"The bill is not controversial,"
Chuck Ludlam, chairman of the

LASSU committee on Executive
Reorganization, told The Daily,;
"and we encountered few objec-1
tions to it either in committee or i
on the floor of the Legislature." <
Increased Authority
Both Scott Mcßride, ASSU i
President, and Mary Ann Ode- i
gaard, the current Vice-President,
favor the proposed revision.
Under the amendment, the
office of Vice-President would
have greatly enhanced authority.!
Presently, the Vice-President, "ad-;
ministers and coordinates the,
social program of the association" j
and keeps "the calcndar«of events ;
for student organizations and liv-j
intf groups." Under the new j
amendment, he would be primar- j
ily responsible for the administra- j
tivc tasks of the Executive office.
The Vice-President is to be re
sponsible for the execution of the
Legislature's policy concerning
the ASSU Boards and Commission
and, thus, will have a vote on
each of these bodies.
The President, meanwhile, will j
lose his vote on these boards.
"We want to kick him upstairs," j
Ludlam said.
Presidential Duties
"The committee fell that the
President should !>r> primarily
concerned with his duties as the!
leader of the student body, as j
liaison between the students and
the administration and faculty. !
and as a policy initiator," Ludlam
added.
Also included in ihe amend
ment is a new means of choosing
a successor for a President who
is unable to serve his whole term.
Presently, a general election must
be called to fill the vacated posi
tion.
The proposed amendment would
make the Vice-President the auto
matie successor.
"Under the present system, this
would not be feasible," Ludlam
explained, "because the Vice-
President's powers and duties are
totally dissimilar from those of
the President. The amendment
would assure that the continuity

of (ho Executive Branch was
maintained and that the best
qualified individual would assume
the vacant post."
Finally, the amendment clari
fies the responsibilities of the
President. The phrase "and
i duties" was added to the word
! "powers" to change the tone of
the section dealing with the Presi-
I dent's authority.
Meßride praised the amendment,
[especially because it gave the
Vice-President "some specific and
well-defined duties."
"Right now," he added, "th e
President delegates the duties;
usually, that means that the Vice-
President is left to utilize her own
personal initiative."
A constitutional amendment reorganizing the offices of ASSU
President and Vice-President will go before the student body in
a special general election next week.
The amendment, already passed in the Legislature with only
two negative votes, would substantially alter the office of Vice-

President, revise the method of
succession to the Presidency, and
clarify several of the powers of
both officers.
Two-thirds of those voting
must approve the amendment be
fore it can be sent to President J.
