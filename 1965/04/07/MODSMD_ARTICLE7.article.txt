# FROSH MAGAZINE
## Vitality and Audacity Reflected in Prism 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Editor 
Stanford's latest literary magazine, the Prism,
was written entirely by freshmen, and, not unsur
prisingly, it reads as though it were written en
tirely by freshmen.
Which is to say that it's not exactly the Partisan
Review.
But nobody should have expected that anyhow.
Indeed, what the writing (both prose and
poetry) lacks in technical facility il often makes
up in audacity and sheer vitality two qualities
frequently absent from the work of more aged
practioneers.
The quality of the magazine as a whole six
short stories, fourteen poems, and two journal
istic features is frustratingly erratic.
Even the best works in particular. Jon Moynes
poem "The Clock," Tom McPhcrson's delightful
Hemingway parody "The Rains of Jilimakaro," and
"Were We Tough" are flawed in
parts. The rest of the selection varies along the
scale from good to downright bad.
The collection of poetry, in particular, reveals
a kind of stylistic sameness reminiscent of a class
exercise in "modified e. e. eummings."
The most successful effort is Jon Moynes
rhymie chant "The Clock," perhaps because, for
all its mannerism, it is both comprehensible and
honest,
Ellen Eeinborg's poem, "The Cure of It," is

also rather neatly done, although her "fruitful
metaphor" ("Your soul is bare/ for I have pared
tho fruit from it and eaten well") may possibly
move one more easily to laughter than to tears.
Tom McPherson gets off to a particularly in
teresting start in his parody of Ernest Heming
way's "The Snows of Kilimanjaro."
The story degenerates rapidly in an overly-facile
Conclusion, but along the way McPherson captures
the idiocies of the Ilemingay idiom with delight
ful accuracy:
"Frederica walked well in front. She was wear
ing jodhpurs and carrying her rifle. She was a
damn good shot. There was no denying that. There
was no getting around that at all. A damn good
shot, he thought, a God damn good shot. He had
taught her."
Mcpherson's satire is quite devesting, but as
if to prove that there are two sides to every lite
rary question, Prism offers as its last, and finest
selection. Paine Kerr's short story "Were We
Tough," a nostalgic reminenee of boyhood which
is at once quite within the Hemingway tradition
of simplicity and quite a bit better than that tra
dition for its honesty and fidelity to sensation.
Indeed, one is quite relieved thai t lie editors
of Prism should have chosen to conclude w i I h
Kerr's piece: for il avoids that quality of Prism
which is most irritating literary affectation
and is rich in that quality which makes Prism as
;i whole well worth iis 35 rents: vilnlity.
