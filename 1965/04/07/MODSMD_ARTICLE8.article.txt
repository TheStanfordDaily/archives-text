# Future Action On Regs Seen
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
Preparation for the implementing of the new soeial regulations
proposal, whieh is to take effect April 16, will not begin until after
the Student Affairs and Services Committee meeting Monday,
the AWS Social Regulations Committee reported yesterday.
Once final word on the proposal is given next week, members

of the committee will meet with*
each house to "re-educate" the;
women.
The Student Affairs and Ser
vices Committee may recommend i
the proposal to President Sterl
ing. who may then pass it on
aither to a top faculty group or i
to the Trustees, or both, accord
ing to Mrs. Judith Hannemann, J
advisor to the AWS committee.
An Assumption Made
"We've gone on the assumption i
that the proposal would have to
be recommended to the Trustees |
because it includes major changes ,
versify, for instance in that chap- j
crones are not required and that j
junior and senior women have j
almost unlimited hours" Mrs.;
Hannemann said.
Minor changes and disputed i
j interpretations of the new pro-1
posal are still being settled by j
the various committees.
The morning sign-in time for j
i juniors and seniors has been
i moved back from 8:30 a.m. to til
! a.m. The later hour was felt to !
be infeasible since it will bo the:
I Auxiliary Committee representa
tive of each house to check the
sign-out cards and this would pre
vent her from taking 8 a.m.
classes.
With the change, she will have!
j from 6 until 8:30 to check the;
cards: a search for a missing'

girl then might not begin until
8:30.
To Avoid Contusion
Moreover, since 6 a.m. is the
official opening hour for the resi
dence, this will help avoid possi
ble confusion about which day a
girl is signed out for, as she
cannot sign out again until after
6 a.m.
The committee is also working
around the loophole which has
been suggested as a possible new
proposal, that a girl could sign
out for the entire quarter and
live off campus.
"We feel it necessary to define
unrestricted overnights in terms
of freedom within the framework
of a residence university," accord
ing to the committee.
The LASSU committee appoin
ted last week for the implementa
tion of the proposal has written
an experimental draft of a new
social regulations handbook,
which will not be printed until
final details on wording and policy
have been agreed upon by both
committees.
The LASSU committee, accord
ing to chairman Elizabeth Wall,
is also concerned with the physi
cal changes thai are necessary in
carrying out the proposal, includ
ing installing a door and hiring a
night-watcher for Lagunita.

Minor changes and disputed i
j interpretations of the new pro-1
posal are still being settled by j
the various committees.
The morning sign-in time for j
i juniors and seniors has been
i moved back from 8:30 a.m. to til
! a.m. The later hour was felt to !
be infeasible since it will bo the:
I Auxiliary Committee representa
tive of each house to check the
sign-out cards and this would pre
vent her from taking 8 a.m.
classes.
With the change, she will have!
j from 6 until 8:30 to check the;
cards: a search for a missing'

girl then might not begin until
8:30.
To Avoid Contusion
Moreover, since 6 a.m. is the
official opening hour for the resi
dence, this will help avoid possi
ble confusion about which day a
girl is signed out for, as she
cannot sign out again until after
6 a.m.
The committee is also working
around the loophole which has
been suggested as a possible new
proposal, that a girl could sign
out for the entire quarter and
live off campus.
"We feel it necessary to define
unrestricted overnights in terms
of freedom within the framework
of a residence university," accord
ing to the committee.
The LASSU committee appoin
ted last week for the implementa
tion of the proposal has written
an experimental draft of a new
social regulations handbook,
which will not be printed until
final details on wording and policy
have been agreed upon by both
committees.
The LASSU committee, accord
ing to chairman Elizabeth Wall,
is also concerned with the physi
cal changes thai are necessary in
carrying out the proposal, includ
ing installing a door and hiring a
night-watcher for Lagunita.
Preparation for the implementing of the new soeial regulations
proposal, whieh is to take effect April 16, will not begin until after
the Student Affairs and Services Committee meeting Monday,
the AWS Social Regulations Committee reported yesterday.
Once final word on the proposal is given next week, members

of the committee will meet with*
each house to "re-educate" the;
women.
The Student Affairs and Ser
vices Committee may recommend i
the proposal to President Sterl
ing. who may then pass it on
aither to a top faculty group or i
to the Trustees, or both, accord
ing to Mrs. Judith Hannemann, J
advisor to the AWS committee.
An Assumption Made
"We've gone on the assumption i
that the proposal would have to
be recommended to the Trustees |
because it includes major changes ,
versify, for instance in that chap- j
crones are not required and that j
junior and senior women have j
almost unlimited hours" Mrs.;
Hannemann said.
