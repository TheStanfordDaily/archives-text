# WEDG FORMED
## New Student Group 
### MARSHA COOK 
Last February a small group of students began meeting Wed
nesday nights at the I-Center to discuss recent developments in
American education, fhe inlormal gatherings ha\'e produced a
full-scale organization, WEDG.
WEDG is interested in Stanford University, its theory and
its future.

It was motivated by the issues
pertaining to education that un
derlay the FSM movement at Cal.
WEDG is interested in the impli
cations concerning academic free
dom the role of Deans and Uni
versity personnel.
Moreover, WEDG examines the
Civil Rights Movement, work
camps, and the whole concept of
non-residence education.
WEDG derives its name from
Wednesday Evening Discussion
Group. It meets at 10:30 p.m. to
talk about everything from social
regulations to the basic philoso
phy of a University.
It grew slowly by word of
mouth because the students did
not want to lose the informality
of the meetings. It was and is
open to everyone, drawing its
membership from all four classes
and graduate students.
WEDG began because people
realized that change was needed
and was possible, if only enough
interest could be focused in the
right directions.
By offering a place for dissent
ing opinion, WEDG is trying to
open channels of communication
on campus.
WEDG has arrived at a defini
tion of a university so that other
thoughts on education can have a
basis. Part of its definition states,
"We believe that the Universit.v
should acl as a social conscience

and positive influence in society."
It also says, ". . . the University
j should work toward the fullest
j individual development of all its
J members."
WEDG sees itself as a catalyst
I for action, and hopefully, vast
i improvement of University policy.
