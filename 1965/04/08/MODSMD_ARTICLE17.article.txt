## USC-Stanford Track Series: Bitter Rivalry 
### Pete King 
The greatest track rivalry in Ihe U.S. will have its 60th renewal
in Stanford Stadium 1 his Saturday when USC, perennial number
one team, comes north to try to continue ils recent mastery of In
dian track teams.
The Trojans have beaten Stanford 28 straight limes in dual
meets. The Tribe last won in 1933; since then the score has been
as close as 73-72 two years ago, bui with USC always victorious.
The Trojan-Indian series has traditionally seen many of the lin
est individual performances in college track, mainly because year
alter year, USC and Stanford are among the top four collcgiate
teams. Stanford won the first meet, 101-18, and the next 21. Then,
in the early 1930'5, the two teams won four meets apiece, each one
loaded with national or world record holders. The rivalry got as
bitter as a Chinese Tong war, with the winner able to claim the
national championship of track.
Then USC's track machine went into high gear, and Stanford
lost repeatedly, including a 104-29 humiliation in 1961. But Stanford
coach Payton Jordan's aggressive campaigning has brought some
very promising talent to the Farm, and the Tribe's chances of beat
ing USC never looked better than they do now.
Nine Records lit Danger
Conceivably, nine meet records could fall Saturday, six by Stan
lord athletes, and three by USC. Stanford's Larry Qucstad ran 9.6 in
the 100-yard dash Tuesday, and should break Charlie Paddock's
44-year-old dash mark of 9.6, as well as the 31-year-old 220 record of
20.9
Paul Schlicke ran the second fastest mile-two mile "double" in
collegiate history Tuesday, only to l>e beaten by UCLA's Bob Day,
who ran the fastest, one. Meet records of 1:03 and 8:58.8 (which he
holds) could well fall.
The pole vault duel promises to be among the most exciting.
Stanford's Jim Eshelman has cleared 15-6 1 - this year, while the Tro
jans' Bill Fosdick has done 15-7 \i>. if Card Chuck Smith < 15-8 1 -) has
recovered from his muscle injury, the meet record of 15-9 Vi looks

extremely shaky.
In the jumps, they don't come
any bettor in college than USC's
Wollesley Clayton and Mahoney
Samuels. Clayton leaped 26 feel
last week in the broad jump, and
and Samuels look only one triple
jump to soar 51-11 *L>, not far off
the U.S. record. Both should sol :
meet records, as should Stanford's j
400 relay team.
Jordan predicts the meet will
bo so close that it will take the
last event — the mile relay — to
decide it. However, that is de
pendent on the Stanford team giv
ing the performance of its life.
For USC is still the USC of old,
and is favored by 10 to 15 points.
Troy Damaged
Troy's prestige as the number
one track team suffered a thud
ding blow to the solar plexus last
week when New Mexico beat
them, 98'.t0 46%. That score is
no typographical error. The Tro
jans were drawn, quartered, pack
aged, and shipped in neat little
pieces back to Los Angeles. That
it could happen to USC, which
had lost only one dual meet in
the previous 20 years, which had
won 22 of 33 NCAA track titles
(finishing second six limes), and
which could boast 52 world rec
ord holders and 16 Olympic c ham
pions, seems simply incredible.
The reason was simple. The
Trojan athletic department blun
dered magnificently in allowing
New Mexico to use its freshmen
in the meet, contrary to ordinary j
league rules. Whether or not they
knew what they were getting into, j
the Trojans received a painful j
black eye, although it is Jordan's |
opinion that both USC and Stan- j
ford could beat New Mexico if j
they could use their frosh teams.

meet records, as should Stanford's j
400 relay team.
Jordan predicts the meet will
bo so close that it will take the
last event — the mile relay — to
decide it. However, that is de
pendent on the Stanford team giv
ing the performance of its life.
For USC is still the USC of old,
and is favored by 10 to 15 points.
Troy Damaged
Troy's prestige as the number
one track team suffered a thud
ding blow to the solar plexus last
week when New Mexico beat
them, 98'.t0 46%. That score is
no typographical error. The Tro
jans were drawn, quartered, pack
aged, and shipped in neat little
pieces back to Los Angeles. That
it could happen to USC, which
had lost only one dual meet in
the previous 20 years, which had
won 22 of 33 NCAA track titles
(finishing second six limes), and
which could boast 52 world rec
ord holders and 16 Olympic c ham
pions, seems simply incredible.
The reason was simple. The
Trojan athletic department blun
dered magnificently in allowing
New Mexico to use its freshmen
in the meet, contrary to ordinary j
league rules. Whether or not they
knew what they were getting into, j
the Trojans received a painful j
black eye, although it is Jordan's |
opinion that both USC and Stan- j
ford could beat New Mexico if j
they could use their frosh teams.
The greatest track rivalry in Ihe U.S. will have its 60th renewal
in Stanford Stadium 1 his Saturday when USC, perennial number
one team, comes north to try to continue ils recent mastery of In
dian track teams.
The Trojans have beaten Stanford 28 straight limes in dual
meets. The Tribe last won in 1933; since then the score has been
as close as 73-72 two years ago, bui with USC always victorious.
The Trojan-Indian series has traditionally seen many of the lin
est individual performances in college track, mainly because year
alter year, USC and Stanford are among the top four collcgiate
teams. Stanford won the first meet, 101-18, and the next 21. Then,
in the early 1930'5, the two teams won four meets apiece, each one
loaded with national or world record holders. The rivalry got as
bitter as a Chinese Tong war, with the winner able to claim the
national championship of track.
Then USC's track machine went into high gear, and Stanford
lost repeatedly, including a 104-29 humiliation in 1961. But Stanford
coach Payton Jordan's aggressive campaigning has brought some
very promising talent to the Farm, and the Tribe's chances of beat
ing USC never looked better than they do now.
Nine Records lit Danger
Conceivably, nine meet records could fall Saturday, six by Stan
lord athletes, and three by USC. Stanford's Larry Qucstad ran 9.6 in
the 100-yard dash Tuesday, and should break Charlie Paddock's
44-year-old dash mark of 9.6, as well as the 31-year-old 220 record of
20.9
Paul Schlicke ran the second fastest mile-two mile "double" in
collegiate history Tuesday, only to l>e beaten by UCLA's Bob Day,
who ran the fastest, one. Meet records of 1:03 and 8:58.8 (which he
holds) could well fall.
The pole vault duel promises to be among the most exciting.
Stanford's Jim Eshelman has cleared 15-6 1 - this year, while the Tro
jans' Bill Fosdick has done 15-7 \i>. if Card Chuck Smith < 15-8 1 -) has
recovered from his muscle injury, the meet record of 15-9 Vi looks

extremely shaky.
In the jumps, they don't come
any bettor in college than USC's
Wollesley Clayton and Mahoney
Samuels. Clayton leaped 26 feel
last week in the broad jump, and
and Samuels look only one triple
jump to soar 51-11 *L>, not far off
the U.S. record. Both should sol :
meet records, as should Stanford's j
400 relay team.
