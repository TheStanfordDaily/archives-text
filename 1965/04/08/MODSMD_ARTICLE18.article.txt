# AAWU Begins New Program In Recruiting
## 
### 
The Presidents and Chancellors
lof the Athletic Association of
Western Universities have rati
j tied a new athletic recruiting pro
: gram which will go into effect
; this spring. The new program, do
| signed to lessen recruiting pres
sures on both athletes and
coaches, is the "Statement of ln
| tent" program previously adopted
by several other athletic confer
j enees.
By April 15, member schools
must have filed in league Execu
tive Director Thomas J. Hamil
ton's office statements each
j wishes sent to prospective stu
| dent-athletes. The AAWU office
will process and record ihe state
ments and send them out to the
prospects.
A high school senior receiving
more than one statement may de
cide to sign one, may wait until
1 later to decide, or may not sign at
all.
If he choses not to sign, Hamil
ton stresses, ". . . he can attend
i any university he desires, be elig
ible for any assistance by ihe Uni
versity under Conference an d
NCAA rules, and be fully eligible
for all competition."
The sole reason for signing such
a pact is that, once the athlete
has indicated his choice of a
school, other conference institu
tions are forbidden from contact
ing him.
