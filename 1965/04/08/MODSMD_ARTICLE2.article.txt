# Cal Senate Hesitates On Grad Seating
## Election Approves Posts For GCC 
### 
The ASUC Senate debated
long into the night last night on
the question of seating ten grad
uate students elected in yester
day's election.
Should the Senate certify the
results of the election, despite I
the opposition of the Board of Re
gents, the Berkeley campus could
bo hi] with another student-ad
ministration crises. As the Daily
went to press last night no deci
sion had been reached.
The G r a d u a t e Coordinating
Committee swept to any easy vic
tory in the mock senate elections
at the University of California
yesterday. Their margin over a
more conservative slate of the
Associated Graduate Students
was about four to one.
The amendment to the ASUC
constitution giving the graduate
students scats on the senate was
approved by an overwhelming
7,118 to 868 margin.
However, the senate appeared
to be heading for some kind of
compromise on the seating of the
graduate representatives.
C hancellor's Threats
UC Chancellor Martin Meyer
son has threatened to make the
ASUC a voluntary organization if
any graduate students were
seated in defiance of a Board of
Regent's veto of a student vote
admitting the graduate students
two weeks ago.
ASUC officials have hinted at ;
legal action against the Univer- j
sity if an attempt was made at ;
evicting them from their offices, ■
or in denying them the student !
fees collected at the beginning of j
tli is semester.
Reliable sources stated late yes
terday that probable course of ac
tion for the senate would be to
delay the possible ASUC-Adminis
tration confrontation over the
seating of the ten elected GCC j
members at least for tonight by j
forming a joint senate-GCC com- j
mitte to consider their seating.
The amendment making the'
graduate students part of the
ASUC for the first time since j
1959 and the graduate approval:
of membership had been rejected !
by the Regents because less than j
half the students had voted and
less than two-thirds had approved '
of the action.
Students at Cal felt that the
election had been legally carried
out and attempted to hold elec- :
tions for graduate representatives !
anyway.

7,118 to 868 margin.
However, the senate appeared
to be heading for some kind of
compromise on the seating of the
graduate representatives.
C hancellor's Threats
UC Chancellor Martin Meyer
son has threatened to make the
ASUC a voluntary organization if
any graduate students were
seated in defiance of a Board of
Regent's veto of a student vote
admitting the graduate students
two weeks ago.
ASUC officials have hinted at ;
legal action against the Univer- j
sity if an attempt was made at ;
evicting them from their offices, ■
or in denying them the student !
fees collected at the beginning of j
tli is semester.
Reliable sources stated late yes
terday that probable course of ac
tion for the senate would be to
delay the possible ASUC-Adminis
tration confrontation over the
seating of the ten elected GCC j
members at least for tonight by j
forming a joint senate-GCC com- j
mitte to consider their seating.
The amendment making the'
graduate students part of the
ASUC for the first time since j
1959 and the graduate approval:
of membership had been rejected !
by the Regents because less than j
half the students had voted and
less than two-thirds had approved '
of the action.
Students at Cal felt that the
election had been legally carried
out and attempted to hold elec- :
tions for graduate representatives !
anyway.
