# Social Regs Squeeze
## 
### 
There appears to be some difference of opin
ion between survivors in the Dean's offices and
student leaders on the question of social regula
tions.
At least the opinions expressed by Mrs. Joyce
Hanneinann in yesterday's Daily, if they can be
taken as the Administration viewpoint, seem to
differ somewhat from those expressed by student
leaders on the same subject.
Mrs. Hanneinann seems to feel that no action
will be taken on the new social regulations until
they have been approved by the highest author
ity necessary, which is to say the Hoard of Trus
tees. (If, like Harry Truman, President Sterling
ever had a sign on his desk, "The Buck Stops
Here," he has long since passed it on to the
Trustees.)
If the students do as Mrs. Hanneinann ap
parently feels that they should, then the April
16 enactment is much too early. For Social Regu
lations to go into effect on that day, a great deal
of work will have to be done, and more impor
tant, a great deal of money, probably from ASSU
funds, will have to be spent prior to the Board
of Trustee meeting on the 15th.
According to Carol Swanson, co-chairman of
the AWS Social Regulations Committee and a
member of the Legislature Special Implementa
tion Committee, before the new regulations can
become effective a new booklet has to be written
and distributed to every undergraduate girl on
campus; several meetings have to be held with
the women to answer their questions on the new
policy; and most important a combination elec
tric door and Little Old Lady doorkeeper have to
bo installed in Lagunita.
It seems fairly clear that all these things can
not be achieved in the time span between the
Board's decision on April 15 and 12:01 p.m. April
16, the enactment date for the new regulations,
and that either the Legislature or some one else
will have to provide money for establishing a
policy that the Trustee's may reject. Either that
or the Legislature will have to set back the April
16 deadline.
One person this incident may put on the spot
is Dean of Students 11. Donald Winbigler, who
is also Financial Director of the ASSU. As Finan
cial Director he has the fairly routine job of

automatically countersigning all ASSU checks
greater than $100 (lor example, a new door in
Lagunita), but as Dean of Students he might
find it a little difficult to approve the expenditure
of money for a project that the Board of Trustees
might reject.
Up to now Dean Winbigler has been able to
keep his job as ASSU Financial Director sepa
rate from his duties as an Administration official,
and no doubt he will attempt to continue on this
course, if for no other reason than attempting to
block an ASSU expenditure lor social regs would
almost certainly provoke the often talked about,
but heretofore non-existent, confrontation be
tween student government and University au
thorities, in an area—social regulations—which is
potentially the most explosive on this campus.
One problem with the social regulations is
that their original raison d'etre, to protect the
purity of Stanford women has become rather
dated. Like Cal s four-letter words, no one of
any proper taste or upbringing mentions the Vic
torian basis of social regulations.
In these modern, mentholated days, the
double standard in women's hours is ignored.
Social regulations exist so that a girl can be con
tacted in case of an emergency, or if she is in
some mythical danger after 2:30, the Stanford
police department can conduct an almost equally
mythical search. In the last fourteen years they
usually haven't had to look much further than
the cactus gardens—the girl's major worry when
awakened being the threat of University dis
cipline.
But while the double standard is publicly ig
nored, privately it no doubt still carries great
weight among middle-aged and above Univer
sity officials. And this fact makes it very difficult
for students to reach agreement with University
officials on the regulations. For social regulations
based on an unstated double standard are far
different from social regulations based on
"safety."
Once social regulations were based on the
idea of keeping women out of men's rooms—now
they only force the girl to leave by 2:30. And
now the Administration is being forced to decide
if half a double standard is better than none at
all. J.B.
