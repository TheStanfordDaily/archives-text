# On The Right
## Showmanship and Rocket Thrust Push Reds Ahead 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Suddenly we are all blue again as a result of the Soviet Union's
achievement ten days ago in space, it has been rubbed in our face,
the doomsayers say, how very far advanced the Soviet Union is
in space technology. Undoubtedly the Communists will get to the
moon first, o Lawdy Lawdy, woe is us: and so shall we ululate

together tor several months to
come. Not for very much longer,
I warrant, as in due course we
shall, without, however, anything
like the theater the Communists
have developed, equal or surpass
their most recent achievement.
A few observations are in or
der. The most obvious technical
one is that the Soviets' most re
cent feat was achieved primarily
as the result of its continuing
lead in the use of a powerful pro
pellant at the first stage of the
rocket's journey. Their machine
has more thrust than our ma
chine — though the gap is clos
ing. We don't seem to know what
it is that gives their rocket that
extra oomph.
Cavorting in Space
The gentleman who stepped out
of the space capsule to cavort in
space had, before doing so, to
seal off the section of the capsule
in which his companion, the
chauffeur, sat. And in order to
do this it was, the scientists de
duce, necessary to construct a
sub-chamber capable of air-tight
compression — which means a lot
of hardware, extremely heavy, of
the kind that uses up a lot of
extra fire power getting off the
launching pad.
The human feat itself was an
act of great courage, but that is
hardly a commodity monopolized
by the Soviet Union. If the au
thorities had instructed any of
our astronauts to poke their
heads, or their whole bodies, out
side the window of their vehicle,
they'd have done so, unquestion
ingly. But it is not the American
way to undertake the risk of a
human life except after every
thing has been done to minimize
the risk.

United States overtook the Soviet

Union in all save that one factor,
the powerful initial thrust. We
iiave danced circles around the
Russians in space. Alongside our
own vehicles, theirs look like
model T's.
What we have greatly to fear
! is our psychological reliance on
Russian preoccupation and Rus
! sian timetables. Two or three
| years ago Khrushchev announced
1 that he had no interest whatever
I in reaching the moon; whereupon
the wind went right out of our
! sails, and many of us begain to
wonder whether there was any
I point in developing our fancy new
(water pistol if the other fellow
j wasn't, going to challenge us with
i his. Now suddenly the Kremlin
announces that they are, needless
to say, going to the moon — and
we sweat wit h apprehension
about the lead they have over us.
I'oli tical Sliowmansh ip
My own inclination, considering
the near absolute consistency of
the Communists as bloody liars.
I was to assume that when they
! told us they weren't going to the
moon, that they had every inten
tion of doing so; and to assume
that now that they say they are
going there, that they have some
thing quite other in mind, like
maybe space platforms to circle
our planet, loaded down with all
those bombs they produced while
wo were sleeping off the Spirit
of Camp David.
They do lead us about by the
nose, the Communists, and all be
cause of their superior political
showmanship. And when you con
sider that this is the home of Bar
j num and Bailey, not Russia! Or
| does the Soviet encyclopedia re-
I veal that Barnum and Bailey were
I really Russian after all? Maybe
| they were.

A few observations are in or
der. The most obvious technical
one is that the Soviets' most re
cent feat was achieved primarily
as the result of its continuing
lead in the use of a powerful pro
pellant at the first stage of the
rocket's journey. Their machine
has more thrust than our ma

it is that gives their rocket that
extra oomph.
Cavorting in Space
The gentleman who stepped out
of the space capsule to cavort in
space had, before doing so, to
seal off the section of the capsule
in which his companion, the
chauffeur, sat. And in order to
do this it was, the scientists de
duce, necessary to construct a
sub-chamber capable of air-tight
compression — which means a lot
of hardware, extremely heavy, of
the kind that uses up a lot of
extra fire power getting off the
launching pad.
The human feat itself was an
act of great courage, but that is
hardly a commodity monopolized
by the Soviet Union. If the au
thorities had instructed any of
our astronauts to poke their
heads, or their whole bodies, out
side the window of their vehicle,
they'd have done so, unquestion
ingly. But it is not the American
way to undertake the risk of a
human life except after every
thing has been done to minimize
the risk.
