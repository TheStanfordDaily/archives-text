# ROSENCRANZ' YEAR
## A 						GRIP ping Experience 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
(Second in a Sories)
"It is my firm impression (hat 100 many
I politicos t;iko themselves much too seri
! ously," ASSU Presidential candidate Armin
| Rosencranz said prior to his election three
| years ago. "They seem to go into office
! with harebrained schemes and go out leav
! ing behind them an unfulfilled committee
j which, of course, never gels abolished."
i For once in his campaign, "Charmin' At-
I min" wasn't joking. Armin Rosencranz did
| not believe in committees, at least, not in
j bureaucratic committees, lie had run an
ad hoc campaign; now he would run an ad
| hoc student government.
"Armin was ;i very bad President as re-
I gards administrative and mundane mat
j tors,*' senior Helen Benjamin, one of Rosen
cranz' aides recalled, "The Legislature in
| his term was almost a non-Legislature . . .
! It only had two effective committees."
KosciuTuiiy/s (■KM*
The most effective organization in the
J President's arsenal, therefore, was an ad
1 hoc group called GRIP the Group with
I Real Inside Power.
j The name and the organization were
! Rosencranz' idea. "The membership con-
I sistcd mostly of apolitical intellectuals
j who would never have touched student poli
ti'*s otherwise." Miss Benjamin continued.
GRIP began with a membership of ap
! proximately 30; it would dissolve a yeur
j later wilh over 12U members.
"CIRIP's express purpose was to educate
the faculty ;is to student concerns." com
mented Skip Martin. "The logical method
of doing this was to ascertain the opinion
of a cross-section of interested student j."

Then, Roseneranz would appoint them to
an ad hoc commit!e to study the problem
and to talk with members of the relevant
faoult y-administ rat ion commit tees.
Issues would not be hard to find.
Armin's 'Four Freedoms'
In his first speech as President, Rosen
eranz told the incoming freshmen that four
freedoms were necessary at Stanford:
• Fredom lo pai ticipate in university pol
icy deliberations and decision-making which
affect students.
• Academic freedom "the freedom for
anybody who had anything to say that is
worth hearing."
• Freedom to govern our own non
academie lives.
• Fredom to emerge from the lethargy
and the apathy that binds our generation.
In the following months, three issues
demonstrated how serious Roseneranz and
co. were in enlarging the scope and the au
thority of student government.
studnu Participation
The first issue was the least controver
sial. President J. E. Wallace Sterling agreed
to let students appointed by the ASSU
President .join several of the President's
Advisory committees.
The second issue was the KPFA contro
versy. which all started when Roseneranz
sent a note to Sen. Thomas Dodd express
ing eoncern over the Senate Internal Sub
committee's investigation of San Francisco
radio station KPFA,
Dean of Students H. Donald VVinbigler
immediately labelled the letter "an im
proper involvement of the University's
name in a matter which, according to offi
cial policy, is not delegated to slndent or
ganizutioir

Moth the Legislature and the Daily
backed Rosencranz. and at one point, the
Administration threatened the students in
volved with disciplinary measures.
( onipromise Decision
A final t*risis was averted wnen the 'Trus
tees made a compromise decision in April,
a decision that also affected the third big
issue of Armin's term, t lie approval of a
new ASSU Constitution, which provided
for a greatly enlarged Legislature (from
21 to approximately one that woidd
elect its own speaker instead of being
chaired by the ASSU President.
The Trustees accepted the Constitution
but upheld University policy and forbid the
Legislature to speak out on off-campus
issues. Instead. University facilities would
be open to voluntary student organizations
which could take partisan stands on public
issues.
The Time I> < oming
By the end of the year. then. Rosencranz
and GRIP had made the Administration
aware that "the time was coming when stu
dent government would no longer be an
arm of the Administration," as one former
member put it.
The humor of Rosencranz' campaign had
been replaced by a more serious approach
to student government, but not. everything
was serene.
The new Legislature, in its first meet
ing. had to adjourn after two hours when
a 30-30 deadlock was reached over I he issue
of raising the price of the flicks to l()e fur
one evening to support the Con Home
Drive.
"Unbelievable!" was all Ih e voluble
President could -ouv.

By the end of the year. then. Rosencranz
and GRIP had made the Administration
aware that "the time was coming when stu

member put it.
The humor of Rosencranz' campaign had
been replaced by a more serious approach
to student government, but not. everything

I sistcd mostly of apolitical intellectuals

GRIP began with a membership of ap

"CIRIP's express purpose was to educate

of a cross-section of interested student j."

Then, Roseneranz would appoint them to
an ad hoc commit!e to study the problem

Armin's 'Four Freedoms'
In his first speech as President, Rosen
eranz told the incoming freshmen that four
freedoms were necessary at Stanford:
• Fredom lo pai ticipate in university pol
icy deliberations and decision-making which
affect students.
• Academic freedom "the freedom for
anybody who had anything to say that is
worth hearing."
• Freedom to govern our own non
academie lives.
• Fredom to emerge from the lethargy
and the apathy that binds our generation.
In the following months, three issues
demonstrated how serious Roseneranz and
co. were in enlarging the scope and the au
thority of student government.
studnu Participation
The first issue was the least controver
sial. President J. E. Wallace Sterling agreed
to let students appointed by the ASSU
President .join several of the President's
Advisory committees.
The second issue was the KPFA contro
versy. which all started when Roseneranz

Armin's 'Four Freedoms'
In his first speech as President, Rosen
eranz told the incoming freshmen that four
freedoms were necessary at Stanford:
• Fredom lo pai ticipate in university pol
icy deliberations and decision-making which
affect students.
• Academic freedom "the freedom for
anybody who had anything to say that is
worth hearing."
• Freedom to govern our own non
academie lives.
• Fredom to emerge from the lethargy
and the apathy that binds our generation.
In the following months, three issues
demonstrated how serious Roseneranz and
co. were in enlarging the scope and the au
thority of student government.
studnu Participation
The first issue was the least controver
sial. President J. E. Wallace Sterling agreed
to let students appointed by the ASSU
President .join several of the President's
Advisory committees.
The second issue was the KPFA contro
versy. which all started when Roseneranz
sent a note to Sen. Thomas Dodd express
ing eoncern over the Senate Internal Sub
committee's investigation of San Francisco
radio station KPFA,
Dean of Students H. Donald VVinbigler
immediately labelled the letter "an im
proper involvement of the University's
name in a matter which, according to offi
cial policy, is not delegated to slndent or
ganizutioir

Moth the Legislature and the Daily
backed Rosencranz. and at one point, the
Administration threatened the students in
volved with disciplinary measures.
( onipromise Decision
A final t*risis was averted wnen the 'Trus
tees made a compromise decision in April,
a decision that also affected the third big
issue of Armin's term, t lie approval of a
new ASSU Constitution, which provided
for a greatly enlarged Legislature (from
21 to approximately one that woidd
elect its own speaker instead of being
chaired by the ASSU President.
The Trustees accepted the Constitution
but upheld University policy and forbid the
Legislature to speak out on off-campus
issues. Instead. University facilities would
be open to voluntary student organizations
which could take partisan stands on public
issues.
The Time I> < oming
By the end of the year. then. Rosencranz
and GRIP had made the Administration
aware that "the time was coming when stu
dent government would no longer be an
arm of the Administration," as one former
member put it.
The humor of Rosencranz' campaign had
been replaced by a more serious approach
to student government, but not. everything
was serene.
The new Legislature, in its first meet
ing. had to adjourn after two hours when
a 30-30 deadlock was reached over I he issue
of raising the price of the flicks to l()e fur
one evening to support the Con Home
Drive.
"Unbelievable!" was all Ih e voluble
President could -ouv.
(Second in a Sories)
"It is my firm impression (hat 100 many
I politicos t;iko themselves much too seri
! ously," ASSU Presidential candidate Armin
| Rosencranz said prior to his election three
| years ago. "They seem to go into office
! with harebrained schemes and go out leav
! ing behind them an unfulfilled committee
j which, of course, never gels abolished."
i For once in his campaign, "Charmin' At-
I min" wasn't joking. Armin Rosencranz did
| not believe in committees, at least, not in
j bureaucratic committees, lie had run an
ad hoc campaign; now he would run an ad
| hoc student government.
"Armin was ;i very bad President as re-
I gards administrative and mundane mat
j tors,*' senior Helen Benjamin, one of Rosen
cranz' aides recalled, "The Legislature in
| his term was almost a non-Legislature . . .
! It only had two effective committees."

The most effective organization in the
J President's arsenal, therefore, was an ad
1 hoc group called GRIP the Group with
I Real Inside Power.
j The name and the organization were
! Rosencranz' idea. "The membership con-
I sistcd mostly of apolitical intellectuals
