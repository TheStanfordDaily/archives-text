# LASSU To Hear Report By Committee of Five
## Judical Proposal To Be Discussed 
### 
The Legislature, tonight, will
I hear the final report and recom
, menclations of the Committee of
Five which has been meeting
with faculty and administrators
on the Judicial Competence Bill,
LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw said
yesterday. The meeting will be
at 7:30 p.m. in room 320.
i Enactment of the controversial
j bill, had been postponed one week
| by the Legislature to permit con
j tinued negotiations.
j The bill creating special com
mission on fraternity practices
will again be brought to the floor.
Shaw said. It had been tabled last
week because rush open houses
prevented the fraternities from
| being fully represented. Shaw in
dicated that the bill's sponsors
would propose some amendments
j to it.
| The resolution, sponsored by
Jay Kadane, requesting that the
University administration return
| the registration of voluntary
; groups, will also be brought back
i on the floor after being tabled last
j week. The Administration took
'over the registration of the groups
last year after student leaders
indicated an unwillingness to re
quire any registration at all.
i A progress report on social reg
ulations from the implementation
committee appointed last week is
also expected Shaw said. The com
mittee is working towards putting
j new social regulations into effect
; April 16.
The new regulations will permit
juniors and seniors to sign out
until 6 a.m. or take unlimited
I overnights. Freshmen and sopho
| more hours will also be liberal
ized. but to a lesser degree.
Shaw believes the recommen
dations of the committee of five
and the fraternity commission to
jbe the most controversial busi
' ness on the agenda.
