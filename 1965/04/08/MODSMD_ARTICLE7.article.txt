# Stillman Dirty Rush Lures Dollies Galore
## 
### 
The female adjunct to fra
ternity dirty rush came off
at Stillman House last night
—hut not quite the way it had
been planned.
The open house function —
to which dollies in particular
and men in general had been
invited —was viewed from the
first with administrative
trepidation.
Higher-ups were a hit leary
of the whole idea and looked
down upon the soeial function
with equal parts of curiosity
and anxiety.
As it turned out, they really
needn't have worried.
The young ladies sat around
and ate cookies and acted like
ladies.
The young men sat around
and ate cookies and . . .
On the surface, it was a
lovely little get-together.
But behind closed doors,
things were quite another
story.
You can see it all now: The
smoke filled room. The ver
bal ding. "I'm sure I saw her
on quad one day with a green
book bag." "That outfit must
have come from Cost Plus."
"You can't believe a word
she says. I know she writes
for the Daily."
Stillman house, after a I I,
has a history of dirty rush
ing. Several years ago the

Stillmanites were audacious
enough to circulate a daisy
covered rush manual entitled:
"Are YOU a Stillman Girl?"
But things have a way of
catching up with those who
err. (Fun Stan and all, you
know.)
Since it was something of
an innovation, the open house
function drew an unusually
large crowd of interested
freshman dollies and interest
ing uppcrclass men.
The turnout, in fact, proved
to he something of a prob
lem.
Feeling smug and self-sat is
tied, the Theta Delt's ar
rived en masse, and found,
somewhat to their undis
guised distaste, that 110, they
weren't the sole fraternity to
have been invited.
To soothe their ruffled feel
ings, the Stillman hostesses
plied them with cookies and
punch.
But, between P e Theta
Delt's and the other male
guests, every speck of food
disappeared within the first
hour.
luter-Kow Council has al
ready begun action against
the offenders. And rumor has
it that; Stillmanites will soon
be subjected to the ultimate
in punative penalties: ham
for dinner for one whole
week.
