# Sterling Evaluates Trends Of 'Restless Generation'
## 
### 
President J- Wallace Sterling
addressed himself to some of the
problems of the "restless genera
tion" at an informal discussion
with the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers yesterday.
Contrasting this generation of
students with the so-called "lost
generation" and the "apathetic
generation," he said that the gene
ral feeling is that "something
must now transcend intellectual
interest; it must be a moral com
mitment." This commitment in
coincident in time with the rising
expectations of underprivileged
people throughout the world and
is the Peace Corps and civil rights
organizations.
Another aspect of the new gen
eration which Sterling discussed,
is its tendency toward national
organization, oriented along the
lines of the students' moral com
mitment rather than student
government, Although this tend
ency is hard to evaluate the Presi
dent believes it is becoming more
apparent.
Asked how he would have re
acted had he been in Clark Kerr's
position last November, Sterling
replied that he frankly didn't
know. The structure of the uni
versity community at Berkeley is
very complex, and "out of the
complexities involved, there arose
a situation in which the differ
ent segments of the university
weren't talkine to each cither."

I President Sterling noted two
(differences between the situations
| at Cal and Stanford. At Cal a ma
jor irritant has been the presence
: of an organization called the Inde
pendent Association of Non-Stu
-1 dents which has grown up around
the macpus. Stanford has no such
I problem.
"We are not strictly confronted
i with a free speech problem, such
as Berkeley was." he added. The
! Political Union and the lIR give
j students an opportunity to ex-
I press their views through an or
i ganization.
