Hungry?
Iti our pari of the world almost nobody dies of malnutrition. The
opulent wealth of our nation has produced a great abundance of food and
line homes, of new cars and television sets, of giant skyscrapers and plush,
gleaming banks, \inericans may not be starving materially but they arc
among the "hungriest" people on earth. Is not such hunger evident on
every hand by the soaring divorce rate, the increase in crime and del
inquency. and in movements of political and social unrest? What men arc
seeking for is freedom and fulfillment, for inner peace and satisfaction.
On a larger scale, wars and conflicts among men are just the projected |
result of man's individual searching for food to satisfy his restless spirit.
This is why Ihe Apostle James, brother of the Lord Jesus Christ, writes:
"\\ hat: causes wars and what causes fightings among you— Is it not your
passions (cravings for pleasure and fulfillment) that are at war among your
members— You desire and do not have so you kill. And you covet and
cannot obtain, so you fight and wage war" (James 4:1, 2).
In our restless age, more and more Americans are discovering that
fame and fortune, that success and education, that wealth and riches do
not satisfy for long, but onlj generate deeper hungers and desires. However,
disillusionment and despair need not follow. The answer is not to abandon
