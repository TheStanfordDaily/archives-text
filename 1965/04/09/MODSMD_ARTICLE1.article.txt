## Resolution Approved by Legislature 
### JAMES BRISCOE JUSTIN BECK 
A compromise within the tri
partite Committee of 15—rep
senting the student, the faculty,
and the administration—on the
controversial Judicial Compe
tence Section of the By-Laws was
announced to the Legislature last
night.
A resolution on the compro
mise and a By-Laws change im
plementing the changes were
passed overwhelmingly by the
Legislature.
The Legislature approved the
recommended resolution SS to 7.
The vote <>n the By-Laws change
was 84 to 11.
Robert Sangster. sluden! mem
ber of the Committee of lfj, told
the Daily that "the resolution is
virtually certain to be adopted
overwhelmingly by the other two
constituents of the University
community. In fact, the Legisla
ture did noi consider any o th e r
possible result."
The resolution will also be pre
sented to the Academic Council
or the Executive committee, and
to President Wallace Sterling for
approval.
Reasserts Principle
The resolution reasserts t li e
principle of original judicial .jur
isdiction by the Judicial councils
over student affairs and conduct.
It provides that when "Univer
sity law or policy conflicts with
the ASSU Constitution or By-
Laws, the latter shall be con
trolling; except that in every
case in which an ASSU judicial
council decided it cannot enforce
a University law or policy," the
case shall be referred to such
separate tribunals as the Univer
sity may set up."
The jurisdiction of these tri
bunals shall be limited to these
cases, however.
The resolution was signed by j
Professor Sanford M. Dornbusch. I
John R. McPnough, Benjamin M. i
Page, anrl Phillip H. Rhinelander j
representing the faculty; by Gary
M. Feldman. J. Scott Mcßride, j
Edward E. Shaw, and Sangster
for the students; and by Robert
•J. Wert for the administration.
It further asserts that a "stu
dent should be disciplined only for
conduct which he did believe or
had reason to believe was a vio
lation of the Fundamental Stan
dard at the time it occured."
C Imnnels Responsibilities
The resolution finally states,
that "all University constituencies
are entitled to express their views
prior to the formulation of Uni
versity policies respecting matters;
in which they have a legitimate
interest," and recommends that
a mechanism should be estab
lished through which duly ap
pointed representatives of the
Academic Council, President of j
the University, and the Legisla
ture meet to discuss University j
problems and policies."
The By-Laws changes approved j
by the Legislature alter the Judi
cial Competence section alone the >
lines set forth in the joint reso
lution, and further alter the re
sponsibilities of students under
the Fundamental Standard to be
responsible only for regulations
and policies "which h;ive been
written and publicized as such." !
The Legislature tabled the reso
lution established a commission
tf) study alledged violations of the
fundamental standard in initia
tion practices.
The proposal had met with
strong fraternity opposition. Bill
McGee, the lEC President, stated ;
that the IPC had been consider-'
ing investigating that very same j
thing and 1 hat pretty soon their
investigation would start.
