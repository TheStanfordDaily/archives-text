## 'Greatest Story Ever Told' A Splendid Achievement 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
After reading the unfavorable
notices given by normally discern
ing critics to "The Greatest Story
Ever Told," I approached the film
skeptically, with the one reserva
tion that a director as experi
enced as George Stevens m us t
surely have managed at least one
or two acceptable scenes.
As it turned out, my hesitation
was well-founded, for "The Great
est Story Ever Told" is a splendid
achievement a moving, legiti
mate and definitive document of
the life of Christ. The critics who
dismissed the film failed to ob
serve the tremendous dedication
with which it has been made.
Indeed, Stevens' commitment
and integrity are evident in every
aspect of the composition. Here is
no Hollywood spectacular with
DeMille sets, mob scenes, gratui
tous promiscuity and wooden dia
logue and acting. The film's ut
ter simplicity, its deliberate pace
and its restrained emotion are not
pretentious attempts at mock
solemnity, but rather are means
of conveying an atmosphere of
reverence without being either
pious or sentimental.
Visual Experience
The film, above all, is a visual
experience. With dialogue at a

minimum, the message is con
veyed primarily by means of a
series of grand pictures. Scenes
of dominant, quiet white and
gray patterns are alternated with
colorful sky and landscapes. The
huge Cinerama screen, used with
out cheap gimmicks, gives a feel
ing of space and breadth. The
graceful, flowing editing imparts
a sense both of movement and
the passage of time. Alfred New
man's unobtrusive musical score
matches the stateliness and dig
nity of the film's pace.
Stevens' obvious determination
and inspiration have drawn from
his star-laden cast performances
of u very high level. Max Von
Sydow's Christ has quiet strength
and nobility, and his intensity
and conviction make the largely
familiar words of Christ meaning
ful and fresh. If there is a short
coming in his interpretation, il
is that in playing with such aus
terity his Christ is somewhat
lacking iti warmth and humor.
I did not find it a distraction to
have famous faces in the support
ing parts because in almost every
instance the star is particularly
well-suited to his role. Among the
many truly stunning perform
ances, Dorothy McGuire's Mary
has great beauty and eloquence

and Jose Ferrer makes a craven,
cringing Herod.
Not Flawless
I do not mean to suggest by my
enthusiasm that the film is with
out flaws, for there are, to he
sure, some excesses. Though the
slow pace is sustained by the in
tensity of the direction and the
performances, the four hour run
ning time could profitably be re
duced to a more comfortable
length. Filmed in Utah and the
Grand Canyon, the scenery is occa
sionally too plentiful and Western
j when what is needed is the harsh-
I ness of Israel.
There are also occasional arti
ficialities of staging: the Last
! Supper scene, based too closely
on the Da Vinci painting, is stiff
land hackneyed, the tomb at the
: end is too obviously a Hollywood
sound stage, some of the color
;proce s si n g is amateurishly
blurred, Shelley Winters and John
Wayne are jarringly bad in cameo
roles, and the dialogue, though
clear, economical and intelligent
most of the way, suffers at times
i from a stilted over-familiarity.
But in retrospect these misfor
j tunes are minor blemishes in an
Io t herwise conscientious and
j gripping artistic.effort.

surely have managed at least one
or two acceptable scenes.
As it turned out, my hesitation
was well-founded, for "The Great
est Story Ever Told" is a splendid
achievement a moving, legiti
mate and definitive document of
the life of Christ. The critics who
dismissed the film failed to ob
serve the tremendous dedication
with which it has been made.
Indeed, Stevens' commitment
and integrity are evident in every
aspect of the composition. Here is
no Hollywood spectacular with
DeMille sets, mob scenes, gratui
tous promiscuity and wooden dia
logue and acting. The film's ut
ter simplicity, its deliberate pace
and its restrained emotion are not
pretentious attempts at mock
solemnity, but rather are means
of conveying an atmosphere of
reverence without being either
pious or sentimental.
Visual Experience
The film, above all, is a visual
experience. With dialogue at a

minimum, the message is con
veyed primarily by means of a
series of grand pictures. Scenes
of dominant, quiet white and
gray patterns are alternated with
colorful sky and landscapes. The
huge Cinerama screen, used with
out cheap gimmicks, gives a feel
ing of space and breadth. The
graceful, flowing editing imparts
a sense both of movement and
the passage of time. Alfred New
man's unobtrusive musical score
matches the stateliness and dig
nity of the film's pace.
Stevens' obvious determination
and inspiration have drawn from
his star-laden cast performances
of u very high level. Max Von
Sydow's Christ has quiet strength
and nobility, and his intensity
and conviction make the largely
familiar words of Christ meaning
ful and fresh. If there is a short
coming in his interpretation, il
is that in playing with such aus
terity his Christ is somewhat
lacking iti warmth and humor.
I did not find it a distraction to
have famous faces in the support
ing parts because in almost every
instance the star is particularly
well-suited to his role. Among the
many truly stunning perform
ances, Dorothy McGuire's Mary
has great beauty and eloquence

and Jose Ferrer makes a craven,
cringing Herod.
Not Flawless
I do not mean to suggest by my
enthusiasm that the film is with
out flaws, for there are, to he
sure, some excesses. Though the
slow pace is sustained by the in
tensity of the direction and the
performances, the four hour run
ning time could profitably be re
duced to a more comfortable
length. Filmed in Utah and the
Grand Canyon, the scenery is occa
sionally too plentiful and Western
j when what is needed is the harsh-
I ness of Israel.
There are also occasional arti
ficialities of staging: the Last
! Supper scene, based too closely
on the Da Vinci painting, is stiff
land hackneyed, the tomb at the
: end is too obviously a Hollywood
sound stage, some of the color
;proce s si n g is amateurishly
blurred, Shelley Winters and John
Wayne are jarringly bad in cameo
roles, and the dialogue, though
clear, economical and intelligent
most of the way, suffers at times
i from a stilted over-familiarity.
But in retrospect these misfor
j tunes are minor blemishes in an
Io t herwise conscientious and
j gripping artistic.effort.
After reading the unfavorable
notices given by normally discern
ing critics to "The Greatest Story
Ever Told," I approached the film
skeptically, with the one reserva
tion that a director as experi
enced as George Stevens m us t
surely have managed at least one
