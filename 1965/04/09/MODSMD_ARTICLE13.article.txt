## Jamal At The Workshop 
### RICK BALE 
Listening to the first few minutes of Ahmad Jamal's opening at
the Jazz Workshop, I was struck once again by the importance of
the live performance in jazz.
Although a jazz recording may unfold the most lyrical melodies
or beautiful harmonies, it can rarely if ever capture the humor, the
suspense — the humanness — that is so much a part of this art.
Yet even in live performance the jazzman may fail to emerge.
An insensitive clubowner, a noisy audience, an unconscientious critic
—these are thorns in the side of every jazzman. Frustrated and con
fused, he may walk off the set or fail to play at all, later to be
branded as "eccentric" or weird."
The current run of Jamal at the Workshop is an excellent ex
ample of live jazz at its finest, without many of the hang-ups that
creep between artist and audience. The attentive crowds and the
excellent management are but two of the factors allowing the trio
to produce some of its best efforts in years.
On the longer, extended numbers, Jamal is able to work out more
thoroughly ideas that have been glossed over in the past. With Jamil
Sulieman on bass and Vernell Fournier on drums, the group is much
freer and more exploratory than during their November stint at
Basin Street West.
Nowhere in past recordings is so clearly evident the complete
integration of this trio. Each idea introduced is given three distinct
emotional commentaries, but the pattern woven is of one voice.
This will be Jamal's last weekend at the club—Mose Allison opens
Tuesday to be followed by Thelonius Monk on the 25th. John Coltrane
Is slated for mid-May.
"Elsewhere, Louis Jordan and Big Mama Willie Mae Thornton are
at Basin Street West, Don Scaletta is at El Matador, and Brasil '65
is at the Trident in Sausalito.
