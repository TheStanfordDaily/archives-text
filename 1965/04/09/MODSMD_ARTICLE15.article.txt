# Menotti's 'The Medium' Occasion For Rejoicing
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
Opera is always difficult to
stage; in English it is even more
so, since shoddy dramatics and a
ludicrous plot can't be sheltered
in the haven offered by a foreign
language.
Thus when an opera in English
is not only musically excellent
but dramatically brilliant, it is
occasion for rejoicing. Such an
occasion is presented by the Pen
insula Religious Drama Guild's
current production of Gian-Carlo
Menotti's "The Medium."
The story of a fraudulent me
dium who feels a hand at her
throat during a seance and, des
perately afraid, turns to drink as
she mentally disintegrates, "The
Medium" is an intense emotional
experience.
Profoundly Moving
Credit for this profoundly mov
ing production must go largely to
the husband and wife team of
Conrad and Linda Bishop; his
direction is unerringly dramatic
but never melodramatic, and it is

not coincidental that "The Me-!
dium's" most memorable parts I
(the "Black Swan" and "Monica,
Monica" scenes) not only come i
closer to containing real arias
than any other portion of the
opera but are vitally important •
dramatic scenes as well.
Mrs. Bishop's musical direction
continually supports but does not
overwhelm the drama of "The Me- j
dium." Indeed, it is difficult to
tell where his individual contribu
tion leaves off and hers begins. !
The set, credited to both of them,!
is entirely appropriate to the
mood of the opera.
And they have assembled an
ideal cast — actors who can sing
superbly (or singers who can act
superbly again one can't be
sure). In the immensely difficult
role of Madame Flora, the me-1
dium, Willene Gunn is brilliant; J
her awesomely powerful voice and
commanding dramatic presence I
combine in an unforgettable per-1
formance.

Lovely Soprano
As her daughter Monica, Ma
rian Hampton displays great per
sonal warmth in addition to a
pure and lovely soprano. Al
though at times she is difficult
to understand, this seems more
the fault of Menotti than Mrs.
Hampton.
Clark Can's portrayal of the
mysterious mute Toby is a beau
tifully modulated performance,
expressing in gestures and move
ment more than many actors can
do with Marc Antony's funeral
oration.
As three of Madame Flora's pa
trons Sally Smaller, Marrietta
Schmidt and Paul Hohenberg
round out the cast with effective
portrayals.

Conrad and Linda Bishop; his
direction is unerringly dramatic
but never melodramatic, and it is

not coincidental that "The Me-!
dium's" most memorable parts I
(the "Black Swan" and "Monica,
Monica" scenes) not only come i
closer to containing real arias
than any other portion of the
opera but are vitally important •
dramatic scenes as well.
Mrs. Bishop's musical direction
continually supports but does not
overwhelm the drama of "The Me- j
dium." Indeed, it is difficult to
tell where his individual contribu
tion leaves off and hers begins. !
The set, credited to both of them,!
is entirely appropriate to the
mood of the opera.
And they have assembled an
ideal cast — actors who can sing
superbly (or singers who can act
superbly again one can't be
sure). In the immensely difficult
role of Madame Flora, the me-1
dium, Willene Gunn is brilliant; J
her awesomely powerful voice and
commanding dramatic presence I
combine in an unforgettable per-1
formance.

Lovely Soprano
As her daughter Monica, Ma
rian Hampton displays great per
sonal warmth in addition to a
pure and lovely soprano. Al
though at times she is difficult
to understand, this seems more
the fault of Menotti than Mrs.
Hampton.
Clark Can's portrayal of the
mysterious mute Toby is a beau
tifully modulated performance,
expressing in gestures and move
ment more than many actors can
do with Marc Antony's funeral
oration.
As three of Madame Flora's pa
trons Sally Smaller, Marrietta
Schmidt and Paul Hohenberg
round out the cast with effective
portrayals.


SOPRANO — Marian Hampton
appears as Monica in "The Me- '
dium."
Opera is always difficult to
stage; in English it is even more
so, since shoddy dramatics and a
ludicrous plot can't be sheltered
in the haven offered by a foreign
language.
Thus when an opera in English
is not only musically excellent
but dramatically brilliant, it is
occasion for rejoicing. Such an
occasion is presented by the Pen
insula Religious Drama Guild's
current production of Gian-Carlo
Menotti's "The Medium."
The story of a fraudulent me
dium who feels a hand at her
throat during a seance and, des
perately afraid, turns to drink as
she mentally disintegrates, "The
Medium" is an intense emotional
experience.
Profoundly Moving
Credit for this profoundly mov
ing production must go largely to
the husband and wife team of
Conrad and Linda Bishop; his
direction is unerringly dramatic
but never melodramatic, and it is

not coincidental that "The Me-!
dium's" most memorable parts I
