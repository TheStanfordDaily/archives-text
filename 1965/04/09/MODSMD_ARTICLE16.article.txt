# Indians to Meet USC for Coast Track Supremacy
## 
### PETE KING 
Barring a continuance of recent bad weather, Stanford and I SC
w ill clash tomorrow afternoon in Stanford Stadium in a meet that 1
could determine the West C.'oast (and therefore national) cham
pion dual meet track team. Field events start at 1:30, with the
first race scheduled lor 2 p.m.
A decision will be made this morning at 11:00 a.m. 011 whether

to hold the meet, postpone it, or*
exorcise some other alternative
which both teams can agree on.
The same will hold true for Hie
freshman track meet wilh the Col
lege of San Mateo, scheduled for
4:00 p.m. U)d;iy on Angell Field.
The meet promises to be even
more exciting than the San Jose
State meet two weeks ago, in
which Stanford emerged with an
18-point victory for the first time
in 10 years. An Indian win tomor
row would be the first in 32 years
over the Trojans.
USC lias Edge
The wet track may keep several
meet records from being broken,
but the competition promises to
be keen in every event. USC has
an edge, if season performances
are compared, but Stanford is in
its "best physical condition of the
year," according to coach Payton
Jordan.
A Stanford victory appears un

likely, simply because the Indians
will have to perform perfectly,
while ihe Trojans can afford a
few upsets and si ill have enough
points to win.
Doping out Ihe moel, certain
events and certain athletes are
of pivotal importance. The first
of these is the javelin. Stanford's
George Porter is favored, but sec
ond place is doubtful. Both Bob
| Stoecker and John Goode are
j about as good as USC's Dick
I Carter, but Stoecker must com
| pete in two other events and
I Goode in three others, and they
may be spread too thin.
Other hinge events are the dis
cus and pole vault. Stoecker, who
has thrown ihe discus 176-6, will
I duel with Trojan Gary Carlson
(175-10). Pole vaulter Jim Eshel-
I man (115-6> will probably be on
1 his own against Troy's Bill Fos
dick (15-7'.'), since Card Chuck |
Smith is a doubtful entrant.
Upset, Possibilities
The sprint events, worth 37
| points altogether, will also be
iigh t 1 y contested. Stanford's
Larry Questad is a solid favorite
in both dashes, and if teammate
Eric Frische can also squeeze by j
USC's Dwight Middleton, S t a n
ford's upset chances will soar.
Dave Deubner in the 880 is fig
dured for third, but he has an
excellent chance for first.
Paul Schlicke is favored in the
two-mile, but Stanford needs an
upset third place from either Mar
tin Hill or Weym Kirkland. The
broad jump is another event
where the Tribe could gain upset
points. If the meet, goes to the
mile relay, it will be decided in
Ihe final lap, with Stanford's Ken
Fraser racing USC's Dave Buck.
