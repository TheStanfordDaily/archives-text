# FIRST SESSION SATURDAY
## Spring Football Returns 
### JOK HERNANDEZ 
Head football coach John Rals
ton and his staff will greet ap
proximately 100 varsity aspirants
Saturday in tho flist spring prac
tice of 1965. The head knocking
sessions end May 10 with tho an
nual varsity-alumni game.
Among the 100 or so hopefuls,
there are 23 lettermen. Thirteen
of the letter winners played of
fense last fall. But tho ten defen
sive lettermen are all stalwarts.
Seven of them were regulars on
last year's defensive squad.
The strong point of the offense
should he the backfield. All four
of the quarterbacks headed by
Dave Lewis are returning. A1 the
running halfback position the na
tion's third leading rusher, with
936 yards, Ray Handley, will re

turn. Speedy Bob Blunt Handley's
understudy last year is returning
also, with no small chance of dis
placing Handley. Blunt may be
moved to flanker, though, in
order to replace the graduated
Jack Ladato.
John Read and Pete Middlekauf
are top choices as of now for tho
fullback spot. Read, a hard run
ning 210 pound sophomore, gain
ed 301 yards last season.
The Indians averaged 108 yards
per game in the air last year.
This figure could be in for a big
boost as both starting ends, John
Mason and Mike Connelly, will be
back. The two ends were the lop
two receivers for the team in
1964.
Re'ying on last year's horses
the line will lack its usual heft,

I but will be blessed with much
(speed. 11 6'6", 278 pound J.C.
transfer Dave Zivich and 234
pound Bill James, also a iransfer,
come through, however, the Tribe
l will surely not feel slighted at Iho
! scales.
Three of the front four on do
! fense will be back: Mike Hibler,
Tom Ross, and Gary Pettigrew.
I Bill Ogle, back-up to starter Bob
' Nichols last year, looms as tho
i fourth man up front. Freshmen
, Blaine Nye, 253 pounds, and fdr
j mer all-C.I.F. Player of the Year
j Don Schwartz could dump any of
;lhe front four, however.
A 1 Wilburn who started the last
1 half of the season should be more
j than adequate at the defensive
lend spot. The other end is up for
grabs.
