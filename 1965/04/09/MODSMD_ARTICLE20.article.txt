# Baseball Team to Battle Dangerous Santa Clara
## 
### BOB THIEROT 
Stanford's two baseball teams
meet face to face with Santa
Clara's Broncs in a pair of home
land home series this weekend.
The varsity riding high in first !
place in the CIBA will be out to
, increase their lead over the close
pack.
John Mason will probably hurl:
! this afternoon when the Santa
Clara Broncos invade the Sunken
Diamond.
The choice for Saturday would
j seem to be Daro Quiring, who usu
ally teams with Mason to knock
â€¢ off enemy batters in short two-
I game series. Quiring has a 5-1 rec
ord this season. Only last week
| end the duo pitched the Indians
I to a doubleheader sweep over the!
i Air Force Academy.
Connelly Ace Reliever
Quiring went the distance,
| while Mason yielded only two hits
] in six shutout frames. The ace
I reliever of the crew Mike Connelly
hopefully doesn't figure to see j
much action. He has become a j
capable fireman though. Against
| the Air Force, he mopped up for j
! Mason and whiffed six Falcons in j
three innings. He surrendered no I
hits.
Frosh Defend Lead
In the Freshman Bay Area |
; Baseball League Stanford will be
trying to maintain its sizable lead \
over Santa Clara. The Papooses!
and Broncs have spit two games
thus far this season. This seems
jto be the final opportunity for:
! the Broncos to make a definite'
| run at the league leaders. These j
I will be the last iwo games be-i
llwecn the two teams.
Santa Clara is the only team to
i have beaten Ihe Papooses this sea-!
'son. Should the teams even split !
'the series Santa Clara would still'
trail by 2 1 .a games. They would
have to hope for someone else to
knock off the Papooses also.
Yet should Santa Clara sweep j

the .sories, they would only trail
by one 'a game. More important
they would ho 2 games ahead in
the loss column. The Broncs
dropped a 7-5 decision to the Pa
pooses up here in the first game
of theseason. The Broncs returned
the favor by swamping the frosh
last weekend, 13-4. Both teams
have only lost once. This series
should decide the outcome of the
Frosh League.
