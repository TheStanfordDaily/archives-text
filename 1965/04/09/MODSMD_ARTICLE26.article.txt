## Criticisms: Constructive, But Not New 
### 
Editor. The Daily:
Ii is difficult to define funda
mental concepts applicable to ail
twenty-three individual autono-j
mo us fraternities. Fraternities j
firmly believe in the four concepts
which you mentioned in your let- i
tor: development of thf whole
individual, integration of the liv
ing group into the academic en
vironment of the University, pro-}
vision of opportunities for the;
fullest possible development of j
widespread interest of house mem- •:
bers, as well as an orientation to- j
ward social activity in the com- j
plete sense. These beliefs arc in !
accord with the aims of the Uni
versitv. Further, the unique and |
desirable advantages of the fra i
ternit.y system are confirmed by!
the fact that a great majority of'
freshmen men went through rush.
Most of these have pledged or will
pledge a fraternity.
Some of iho criticisms offered!
by the authors of "A Second
Look" are constructive, but none I
are novel. Much credit should be
given to those fraternity men who
are working from within the sys
tem to improve the individual
houses. It is true that the future
of fraternities is in the hands of
the pledges who will continue to
work within Ihe system rather
than outside of the system to
strengthen the individual fraterni
1 ics.

• Reasons for Unrest
Editor, The Daily:
It has been suggested that one
cause of the recent student un- j
rest at major state universities
has been the nature of their ad
missions policies. Stanford, re
portedly quite selective, has never
theless seen the growth of a simi
lar fringe Kultur.
This diffuse melange of hangers
on, pseudo "non-students," a n d
alleged graduate students regu
larly cluster in large student cen
ters from which emerge pockets |
of disruptive unrest.
They are the fountainhead of
organized political activism, they
have spearheaded the drive to
ward the so-called "New Moral
ity," and their scholastic malinger
ing provides a fluid foundation
for their unthinking indulgence in
quasi-movements supposedly con
cerned with "vital issues."
Such conditions are not condu
cive to academic freedom in its j
classical sense, and those desir- !
ing a constructive meeting of ■
minds instinctively hesitate be

| fore the questionable prospects
thereby presented to them.

• Suggestions
Editor, Th«> Daily:
May I make a few suggestions
i that I believe would be beneficial
in the improvement of your al
; ready great newspaper? I sug*
i gest the following:
. 1. Group all news items refer
ring to the Savios, Kings, would
1 be clergy, rioters, and other such
; demagogues whose income is ap
i patently from groups other than
i those interested in the welfare of
! the United States - group all
j these'into one easily removable
section.
2. Color that section, for ease
I in identification, pale red or bright
I pink.
I 3. Make the si/e of the section
approximately two inches longer
I than normal for the following rea
sons: it would facilitate removal
and separation from the rest of
your fine newspaper; it would,
when properly folded, make an
excellent liner for a tray of Kitty
Litter.

• Musie Dilemma
! Editor, The Daily:
Stanford students, we are led
• to believe, are hand-picked from
I thousands of applicants every
year. The Admissions Department
states that well over 90 per cent
of these applicants arc capable of
doing the work required at Stan
| ford. Those admitted, therefore,
are picked because they have spe
cial extracurricular interests in
high school, such as sports, lite
rary efforts, or music. Stanford
provides full opportunity to par
ticipate in sports through murals,
classes, and the varsity. There are
always people needed to work on
literary publications (Sequoia)
and not so literary publications
| (Daily), and debaters can go to
* the S.U.N, or run for public office.
It seems a shame that music
should be so different.
Obviously the nature of music
precludes intramural competition.
Therefore, if one wishes to take
part in organized musical activity
one lias to go to the Music De
partment. The department does a
good job on general interest
! courses such as Introduction to
j Music. However, if a person wants
to take instrumental instruction
'but not be a major (there are
many of these among the hand-

picked Stanford students), he is
in real trouble. These are the
facts. You cannot have individual
instrumental instruction unless
you are a music major. If y o it
want instrumental instruction at
all, you must be a music minor,
| and even then you take lessons
with one or two other students at
the same time. You cannot take
i lessons at all unless you have al
! ready reached a certain high level
jof proficiency only music ma
jjors are allowed to take begin
' ning lessons. For all this you still
: pay $40 per quarter, or $4 per
: lesson. Finally, music minors are
\ allowed only one unit for taking
| lessons. One should spend about
I half an hour to one hour a day
j keeping his touch, and about two
i hours if he wishes to really im
prove and get a decent grade.
Surely this amount of time is
worth more than one unit. W h a t
[really irritates, however, is that
i the professors I and other people
I I know have talked to all agree
i that the situation is bad and
j something should be done — but
j always later, or "next quarter"
i (quote from Executive Head Dr.
j Crosten).
If the Music Department is in
terested in solutions to the prob
• lem, I have many. I just hope this
| letter pulls them into realizing
that their present philosophy is
(much too strongly biased in fa
jvor of the music major, and that
I there are many other very inter
ested and talented people who
I would be a credit to the depart
j ment if they were given th e
I chance. That "wide, liberal educa
tion" Stanford is so proud of is
I being severely hindered by the
attitude of the Music Depart
ment, and in the process the De
partment is being hurt by the
loss of respect it is slowly gain
ing from disappointed; formerly
enthusiastic students.

• Time for Thought
Editor, The Daily:
As President Johnson has ironi
cally stated: the bombing of the
United States Embassy in Saigon
indicates the extent of the Viet
namese problem. It does rather
pointedly suggest that the U.S.
is not as welcome in South Viet
nam as our State Department
would have us believe. Rather
than use this episode as a pre
text for the bombing of Hanoi,
it would be far more appropriate
to reevaluate our involvement in
Vietnam altogether.
