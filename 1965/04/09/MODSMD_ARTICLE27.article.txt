# From The Establishment
## Amendment To Streamline Hierarchy, Define Duties 
### Steve Leopold 
"Tilt' Vice-Presidency isn't worth a pitcher ol warm spit,"' de
clared John Garner, FDR's first running mate.
Garner may have been speaking of the national office, hut his
words adequately describe the present power position of the
ASSU Vice-President vis-a-vis the other high-ranking officers in

student government. <
According to the ASSU Consti
tution, the Vice-President's duties
consist of "administering and co
ordinating the social program of
the association" and keeping "the
calendar of events for student or
ganizations and living groups."
Whatever else she does is mostly
on her own initiative.
For this reason LASSU's Execu
tive Reorganization Committee
has proposed an amendment to
the Constitution that would
greatly revamp and expand the
explicit powers and duties of the
Vice-President <see Page 2>.
Under the new order, the Vice-
President would probably become
the chief administrator of the
ASSU. He would take over the
President's current role as a vot
ing member of the 20-odd boards
and commissions of the Associa
tion.
In the present condition, "it's
physically impossible for th c
President to meet these obliga
tions." Scott Mcßride said recently
in explaining I lis support of the
amendment. Also, the President is
responsible for appointing sev
eral students to various boards
and committees, which takes up
more time for interviews.
A final problem is that of pres
tige. The President's administra
tive assistant assumes control of
the student government when the
President is out of town or other
wise temporarily incapacitated.
Yet this transition is not Consti
tutional, and when an administra
tor is confronted with a request
from the administrative assistant,
he is often unfamiliar with both
the person and his real power in
student government.

On the whole, then, the pro
posed amendment should stream
line thehierarohy of the ASSU
as well as clarify it. It would give
the President more free time to
initiate policy changes and deal
with the overall view.
As a purely organizational plan,
the amendment is almost beyond
debate. Or, as Chuck Ludlam,
chairman of the Executive Reor
ganization Committee, has said
"non controversial, though some
parts are confusing."
However, the amendment has
thrown the political processes on
campus into something between
panic and despair. The issue hat
hit the campus just as the stu
dent politicians begin jockeying
for position in this year's race for
President of the Student Body.
Under t h e current system,
everything is simple — if noi con
dusive to efficient student govern
ment. A coed wins the Vice-Presi
dency and spends a year coordi
nating the Association's social
functions. A male wins the Presi
dency and appoints one of the
faithfuls from his campaign
retinue to be administrative as
sistant. And everyone is happy,
though disorganized.
The proposed revision would
not necessitate that the Vice-
President and the President run
on the same ticket, but the Legis
lature has already passed a By-
Law which makes such a mating
necessary, regardless of the out
come of next week's vote.
Confusing? Not at all, it just
requires further discussion some
of which will appear in this col
umn Monday.
