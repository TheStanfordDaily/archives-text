"Piffle, Mr. Walsh. Piffle!"
With those words from James
Woolsey — administrative assis
tant to ASSU President Armiri
Roseneran/, two years ago, Rhodes
scholar, members of GRIP and
principal drafter of the present
ASSU Constitution the Presi
dential campaign of 1963 began,
seven months before the voting.
The "Mr. Walsh" being piffled
j was one Mike Walsh, critic of
; Rose n era nz' style of government
and an eventual candidate for the
Presidency of the student body.
Walsh had blasted Rosencranz'
i "Four Frecdoms" (freedom to par
|ticipate in University policy de
: liberations, complete freedom of
| discussion, freedom for students
! to govern their non-academic
lives, and freedom to emerge from
the lethargy and the apathy that

binds our generation) in the
Daily, calling them "considerably
unrealistic, grossly irresponsible,
and alarmingly naive." Moreover,
Walsh caustically noted that Ro
seneranz was "demanding a great
er student voice in administrative
affairs, while denying the admin
istration any voice in student af
fairs."
( andidates Emerge
Seven months later, Mike Walsh
declared himself a candidate for
the ASSU Presidency. His oppo
nent, Bud Wedin, was only a
sophomore, but he had spent the
year as chairman of the Legisla
ture's By-Laws committee and had
worked hard among those inter
ested in increasing the scope and
authority of student government.
By Spring, Wedin had emerged
as the candidate of "the establish
ment" a derogatory term that
denoted his association with Ro

i sencranz, GRIP and the student.
i activist movement.
r Fhe issues were clear by the;
lend of the lirst debate between
the-two. Wedin praised the cur- j
rent administration and claimed j
I that "students should now move!
; into new areas of policy decision
making by the student-faculty
committees." He believed that:
"our job is not to run the Univer- i
: sity smoothly, but to question and j
; to probe."
Walsh asked where student gov-;
.eminent was going to draw the!
j line. He thought there were places j
;where the students "really will
! never have a vote on student fac-'
lulty committees, such as those |
I areas of university finance." Fin-1
i ally, he blasted Roseneranz as an
("enlightened Moses" whose only j
j weapon was pressure.
Wedin Wins
The results of this debate were;
, mixed, according to a student who
was high up in Wedin's campaign!
| hierarchy. "In the debate itself, j
! Bud got cut to shreds. He went.
lover there without any prepara
tion. Walsh had facts and figures j
land was ready for a political de- 1
hate. Luckily, the debate was in
a woman's dorm, in a men's dorm
I we would have been dead. Walsh j
came off harsh and somewhat;
pompous."
Within two weeks, however. We
din was beating Walsh both in
| debate and in the personality con
test. our anonymous and pet
haps biased chronicler relates.
GRIP's part in ihc campaign!
was hard to gauge. Most of the
(members were sympathetic with
Wedin, senior Helen Benjamin >
told the Daily, "but he never got
'any sort of endorsement at a meet
ing."
When the votes were counted,
Wedin won 1,414 to 933.
As the 1963-64 school year be
gan, Iwo things became apparent.
GRIP had dissolved with the end
!of Roseneranz' term, but Wedin
| had picked up a dedicated ally in
|one Ilene Strelitz, the Daily edi
tor.
St relit/.' first editorial mirrored
I Wedin's campaign observation i
(hat harmony was not an essen
tial attribute of a great univer-j
sity. She noted that a high-rank
ing administrator had said to a I
! faculty member the year before;
jthat he wanted to run a "happy j
university."
" 'Happy,' " Strelitz wrote, i
list of adjectives to be applied to
the ideal academic community,",
She further raked the University;
for denying freedom of religion
, "would seem the last in an infinite
| on campus and for allowing the
j judicial structure to be run by
'students only in a limited number
of cases.

Adiiunist rat ion Reaction
The Administration, though, had
decided that one year of Rosen
eranzism was enough. "Wedin's
Presidency was one long reaction
to Armin's term," his aide con
tinned. "He just wasn't able to
communicate with President Ster
ling."
The first evidence of ibis reac
tion came when Sterling an
nounced that student membership
on the key Student Affairs and
Services Committee had been cut
from 5 to 3, and tha 1 the Com
mittee on Public Exercises had re
ceived a 7 to 3 reduction in stu
dent membership. Moreover, Ster
ling said he would no longer take
only the ASSU President's recom
mendations, but he would also
accept direct applications and
recommendations from the Dean
of Students and other sources.
The Legislature objected, but
to no avail. The resulting student
participation in the committees
was ironical to say the least.
Walsh, the defeated Presidential
candidate, was put on the Stu
dent Affairs and Services Com
mittee; Wedin, the winner, ended
up on the Committee on Athletics.
Off-Campus Issues
The student activists moved to
off-campus issues. In late October,
former Assistant Dean of Me n
Allard K. Lowenstein, who was
working in Mississippi at the
time, called on the Stanford com
munity for money and manpower
to help in the Mock Election be
ing staged in Mississippi for state
NAACP head Aaron Henry.
The Legislature could not act
officially due to a university pol
icy that prohibited its speaking
out on off-campus issues. But
more than $5,000 was raised and
the basis for the ensuing Civil
Rights Secretariat and subsequent
Civil Rights groups here at Stan
ford was established.
The other big issue of last
year began overseas and ended at
the Registrar's office. Frank
Morse was suspended for break
ing some door panels at the Flor
ence campus. His suspension had
come ;il the request of Dr. Guelfo
Frulla, the director of the Italian
campus; it was upheld by the
Dean of Students. The ruling of
the student judicial council of the
Italy VII group was overruled
and the Men's Council here was
never given a chance to hear
Morse's appeal.
The controversy that followed
was protracted, but Morse was
not enrolled Spring quarter. More
over, Ihc Administration had won
another battle; in this year's
Crow-Halverson report, the Dean
was heavily criticized, but no in
vestigation was held.
Thus, the year ended with We
din fighting on all fronts, but
winning few victories

Adiiunist rat ion Reaction
The Administration, though, had
decided that one year of Rosen
eranzism was enough. "Wedin's
Presidency was one long reaction
to Armin's term," his aide con
tinned. "He just wasn't able to
communicate with President Ster
ling."
The first evidence of ibis reac
tion came when Sterling an
nounced that student membership
on the key Student Affairs and
Services Committee had been cut
from 5 to 3, and tha 1 the Com
mittee on Public Exercises had re
ceived a 7 to 3 reduction in stu
dent membership. Moreover, Ster
ling said he would no longer take
only the ASSU President's recom
mendations, but he would also
accept direct applications and
recommendations from the Dean
of Students and other sources.
The Legislature objected, but
to no avail. The resulting student
participation in the committees
was ironical to say the least.
Walsh, the defeated Presidential
candidate, was put on the Stu
dent Affairs and Services Com
mittee; Wedin, the winner, ended
up on the Committee on Athletics.
Off-Campus Issues
The student activists moved to
off-campus issues. In late October,
former Assistant Dean of Me n
Allard K. Lowenstein, who was
working in Mississippi at the
time, called on the Stanford com
munity for money and manpower
to help in the Mock Election be
ing staged in Mississippi for state
NAACP head Aaron Henry.
The Legislature could not act
officially due to a university pol
icy that prohibited its speaking
out on off-campus issues. But
more than $5,000 was raised and
the basis for the ensuing Civil
Rights Secretariat and subsequent
Civil Rights groups here at Stan
ford was established.
The other big issue of last
year began overseas and ended at
the Registrar's office. Frank
Morse was suspended for break
ing some door panels at the Flor
ence campus. His suspension had
come ;il the request of Dr. Guelfo
Frulla, the director of the Italian
campus; it was upheld by the
Dean of Students. The ruling of
the student judicial council of the
Italy VII group was overruled
and the Men's Council here was
never given a chance to hear
Morse's appeal.
The controversy that followed
was protracted, but Morse was
not enrolled Spring quarter. More
over, Ihc Administration had won
another battle; in this year's
Crow-Halverson report, the Dean
was heavily criticized, but no in
vestigation was held.
Thus, the year ended with We
din fighting on all fronts, but
winning few victories

scholar, members of GRIP and
principal drafter of the present
ASSU Constitution the Presi
dential campaign of 1963 began,
seven months before the voting.
The "Mr. Walsh" being piffled
j was one Mike Walsh, critic of
; Rose n era nz' style of government
and an eventual candidate for the
Presidency of the student body.
Walsh had blasted Rosencranz'
i "Four Frecdoms" (freedom to par

: liberations, complete freedom of
| discussion, freedom for students
! to govern their non-academic
lives, and freedom to emerge from
the lethargy and the apathy that

binds our generation) in the
Daily, calling them "considerably
unrealistic, grossly irresponsible,
and alarmingly naive." Moreover,
Walsh caustically noted that Ro
seneranz was "demanding a great
er student voice in administrative
affairs, while denying the admin
istration any voice in student af
fairs."

Seven months later, Mike Walsh
declared himself a candidate for
the ASSU Presidency. His oppo
nent, Bud Wedin, was only a
sophomore, but he had spent the
year as chairman of the Legisla
ture's By-Laws committee and had
worked hard among those inter
ested in increasing the scope and
authority of student government.
By Spring, Wedin had emerged
as the candidate of "the establish
ment" a derogatory term that
denoted his association with Ro

i sencranz, GRIP and the student.
i activist movement.
r Fhe issues were clear by the;
lend of the lirst debate between
the-two. Wedin praised the cur- j
rent administration and claimed j
I that "students should now move!
; into new areas of policy decision
making by the student-faculty
committees." He believed that:
"our job is not to run the Univer- i
: sity smoothly, but to question and j
; to probe."
Walsh asked where student gov-;
.eminent was going to draw the!
j line. He thought there were places j
;where the students "really will
! never have a vote on student fac-'
lulty committees, such as those |
I areas of university finance." Fin-1
i ally, he blasted Roseneranz as an
("enlightened Moses" whose only j
j weapon was pressure.

gan, Iwo things became apparent.

jthat he wanted to run a "happy j
university."
" 'Happy,' " Strelitz wrote, i
list of adjectives to be applied to
the ideal academic community,",
She further raked the University;
for denying freedom of religion
, "would seem the last in an infinite

Adiiunist rat ion Reaction
The Administration, though, had
decided that one year of Rosen
eranzism was enough. "Wedin's
Presidency was one long reaction
to Armin's term," his aide con
tinned. "He just wasn't able to
communicate with President Ster
ling."
The first evidence of ibis reac
tion came when Sterling an
nounced that student membership
on the key Student Affairs and
Services Committee had been cut
from 5 to 3, and tha 1 the Com
mittee on Public Exercises had re
ceived a 7 to 3 reduction in stu
dent membership. Moreover, Ster
ling said he would no longer take
only the ASSU President's recom
mendations, but he would also
accept direct applications and
recommendations from the Dean
of Students and other sources.
The Legislature objected, but
to no avail. The resulting student
participation in the committees
was ironical to say the least.
Walsh, the defeated Presidential
candidate, was put on the Stu
dent Affairs and Services Com
mittee; Wedin, the winner, ended
up on the Committee on Athletics.
Off-Campus Issues
The student activists moved to
off-campus issues. In late October,
former Assistant Dean of Me n
Allard K. Lowenstein, who was
working in Mississippi at the
time, called on the Stanford com
munity for money and manpower
to help in the Mock Election be
ing staged in Mississippi for state
NAACP head Aaron Henry.

The Administration, though, had
decided that one year of Rosen
eranzism was enough. "Wedin's
Presidency was one long reaction
to Armin's term," his aide con
tinned. "He just wasn't able to
communicate with President Ster
ling."
The first evidence of ibis reac
tion came when Sterling an
nounced that student membership
on the key Student Affairs and
Services Committee had been cut
from 5 to 3, and tha 1 the Com
mittee on Public Exercises had re
ceived a 7 to 3 reduction in stu
dent membership. Moreover, Ster
ling said he would no longer take
only the ASSU President's recom
mendations, but he would also
accept direct applications and
recommendations from the Dean
of Students and other sources.
The Legislature objected, but
to no avail. The resulting student
participation in the committees
was ironical to say the least.
Walsh, the defeated Presidential
candidate, was put on the Stu
dent Affairs and Services Com
mittee; Wedin, the winner, ended
up on the Committee on Athletics.
Off-Campus Issues
The student activists moved to
off-campus issues. In late October,
former Assistant Dean of Me n
Allard K. Lowenstein, who was
working in Mississippi at the
time, called on the Stanford com
munity for money and manpower
to help in the Mock Election be
ing staged in Mississippi for state
NAACP head Aaron Henry.
The Legislature could not act
officially due to a university pol
icy that prohibited its speaking
out on off-campus issues. But
more than $5,000 was raised and
the basis for the ensuing Civil
Rights Secretariat and subsequent
Civil Rights groups here at Stan
ford was established.
The other big issue of last
year began overseas and ended at
the Registrar's office. Frank
Morse was suspended for break
ing some door panels at the Flor
ence campus. His suspension had
come ;il the request of Dr. Guelfo
Frulla, the director of the Italian
campus; it was upheld by the
Dean of Students. The ruling of
the student judicial council of the
Italy VII group was overruled
and the Men's Council here was
never given a chance to hear
Morse's appeal.
The controversy that followed
was protracted, but Morse was
not enrolled Spring quarter. More
over, Ihc Administration had won
another battle; in this year's
Crow-Halverson report, the Dean
was heavily criticized, but no in
vestigation was held.
Thus, the year ended with We
din fighting on all fronts, but
winning few victories

"Piffle, Mr. Walsh. Piffle!"
With those words from James
Woolsey — administrative assis
tant to ASSU President Armiri
Roseneran/, two years ago, Rhodes
scholar, members of GRIP and
principal drafter of the present
ASSU Constitution the Presi
dential campaign of 1963 began,
seven months before the voting.
The "Mr. Walsh" being piffled
j was one Mike Walsh, critic of
; Rose n era nz' style of government
and an eventual candidate for the
Presidency of the student body.
Walsh had blasted Rosencranz'
i "Four Frecdoms" (freedom to par
|ticipate in University policy de
: liberations, complete freedom of
| discussion, freedom for students
! to govern their non-academic
lives, and freedom to emerge from
the lethargy and the apathy that

binds our generation) in the
Daily, calling them "considerably
unrealistic, grossly irresponsible,
and alarmingly naive." Moreover,
Walsh caustically noted that Ro
seneranz was "demanding a great
er student voice in administrative
affairs, while denying the admin
istration any voice in student af
fairs."
( andidates Emerge
Seven months later, Mike Walsh
declared himself a candidate for
the ASSU Presidency. His oppo
nent, Bud Wedin, was only a
sophomore, but he had spent the
year as chairman of the Legisla
ture's By-Laws committee and had
worked hard among those inter
ested in increasing the scope and
authority of student government.
By Spring, Wedin had emerged
as the candidate of "the establish
ment" a derogatory term that
denoted his association with Ro

i sencranz, GRIP and the student.
i activist movement.
r Fhe issues were clear by the;
lend of the lirst debate between
the-two. Wedin praised the cur- j
rent administration and claimed j
I that "students should now move!
; into new areas of policy decision
making by the student-faculty
committees." He believed that:
"our job is not to run the Univer- i
: sity smoothly, but to question and j
; to probe."
