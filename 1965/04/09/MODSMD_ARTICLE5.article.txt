## ASUC Crisis Unresolved 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Editor 
j The showdown at Berkeley over graduate membership in the
j ASI r C lias — temporary at least — fizzled into nothing.
The all-out confrontation, predicted for last \\ ednesday s ASI (,
i Senate meeting, failed to materialize through a long evening of
I tumultuous debate and tenuous compromise which ultimately pro-

duced nothing of substance save
perhaps dissention.
In the face of disunity, ASUC
President Charlie Powell yester
day announced plans for a con
stitutional convention and issued
a call ' for an end to belligerence
and destructive action and for the
beginning of a new era of good
feeling among the students of this
campus."
All efforts to establish a work
ing compromise Wednesday night
! finally came to an abrupt halt
when ten members of the Ber
keley GCC, elected as Senate rep
resentatives on a "freedom ballot"
this week, stalked angrily from
the Senate floor.
GCC Departure
The GCC departure came when
1 the Senate voted 8 to 7, with two
i abstentions, to accept an amend
! merit, proposed by Powell, which
I would have watered down a com-
J promise bill establishing a "Crisis
i Commission" (composed of th e
21-man ASUC Senate and the 10
j GCC representatives) to study the
! dilemma in which the Berkeley
| student government finds itself
! and to recommend by initiative
'proposals for reorganization to
the student body in the May elec
tions.
In the absence of the GCC, the
; amended "Crisis Commission"
1 proposal went down to defeat.
The "Crisis Commission Com
promise" — apparently a time
! buying device was originally
hammered out in the long after
| noon of caucuses which preceded
! the Senate meeting.
The establishment of the com
; mission would have allowed the
j Senate to practically bring the
! graduate representatives within
I the ASUC Senate structure while,
• at the same time, temporarily
'avoiding the question of officially
' seating the GCC an action which
Berkeley Chancellor Martin Mey
! erson has said will force him to
i dissolve the Senate.
Compromise Acceptable?
There was some indication that
the Commission compromise, as
originally agreed upon, would
| have been acceptable to Meyerson,
; but the events of Wednesday
■ night made that a moot point,
i The Wednesday session began
at 7:30 p.m. The Commission Bill
was last on the agenda, and as
j 10:30 rolled around it still hadn't
! come up for debate.
At that point, a member of the
GCC announced the results of the
| freedom vote: 7,184 yes; 868 no
on a constitutional amendment
giving the graduate students
I representation on the Senate, and
| ten GCC senators elected by a
margin of better than 4 to 1.
There was a burst of applause,
j and then Powell recessed the ses
sion for twenty minutes.
New Amendments
During the recess, the GCC
reps and members of SLATE,
Berkeley's liberal political party,
met in a cloak-room caucus to
' revise their plans.
Two amendments would be ad
i ded to the original compromise
Bill: The first would provide that
the Commission hold open meet
! ings every week. The second, and
(most crucial amendment, would
forbid tho regular ASUC from
I "considering or voting on policies
lor financial matters affecting
j next semester's student govern
ment."
The tactic would he this: the
I question of seating the GCC rep
resentatives elected in the free
j dom vote, would lie introduced,
but not seconded. It would thus
! die, for the moment, hut could
| be brought up again at the end of
! debate.
Next, the compromise, with its
I significant new amendments,
would be debated and, presum- 1
, ably passed.
Finally the question of the GCC
.seating would be brought up
again and, quite inevitably de-;
| feated.
At this point, the GCC repre
sentatives would "walk to the

table anyhow and take our
seats."
Powell would adjourn the Sen
ate, but the GCC would remain
J behind, under their own power
j reconvene the session, under the
| auspices of the ASUC senate
| draft a "telegram to governor
; Brown," and, finally, adjourn.
Kill Stalemated
That was the plan at least. In
practice it didn't quite work.
The question of the GCC seal*
I ing was, indeed, brought up. And
| did, indeed, fail for lack of a sec
| ond. But the project stalled on the
| compromise bill.
Powell, having second thoughts
j about the consequences of the
j amended version of the bill
j (which he had agreed to intro
duce, under pressure from
I SLATE and the GCC) moved to
amend the controversial section
six so that the Senate was merely
"to consult with" Iho commission
j before considering policies or
financial matters affecting next
| semester's student government.
It wasn't much, but it was
I enough for the CCC.
Powell's amendment passed,
and the graduates walked out
'leaving Berkeley in much the
! same unhappy state in which it
| had been some eight hours before.
Powell Angered
Powell, obviously angered by
Wednesday's events, had a feu
strong words to say about the
GCC members who walked out.
i"I just think that it's very diffi
cult to work with people like
j that who pick up their marbles
land go home every time they
don't get their own way," lie ob
; served to the Daily.
"What we're going to have to
do," he continued, "is get some
thing so basically democratic
I that they'll have to go along or
be relegated to the fringes . . .
They're just going to have to
; cooperate."
What Powell apparently has in
mind is his constitutional conven
tion which would meet to draw
iup a proposal for governmental
! reorganization to be submitted to
the Berkeley student body this
I May.
Campus Unity
Powell's official statement,
i released yesterday, took on a
j milder tone. While regretting that
j"the Senate and the elected grad
uate students were unable to ag-
I ree on a plan for the restructur
j ing of tho ASUC in Wednesday
j night's Senate meeting," he ob
! served optimistically that "all
' students on this campus arc work*
; ing together toward an effective,
student government."
There may yet be grounds for
j Powell's stated optimism, but
! Wednesday's debate seems to indi
cate that at Berkeley the pres
sures of both time and emotion
j are working against the posibility
of a saving compromise.

Powell Angered
Powell, obviously angered by
Wednesday's events, had a feu
strong words to say about the
GCC members who walked out.
i"I just think that it's very diffi
cult to work with people like
j that who pick up their marbles
land go home every time they
don't get their own way," lie ob
; served to the Daily.
"What we're going to have to
do," he continued, "is get some
thing so basically democratic
I that they'll have to go along or
be relegated to the fringes . . .
They're just going to have to
; cooperate."
What Powell apparently has in
mind is his constitutional conven
tion which would meet to draw
iup a proposal for governmental
! reorganization to be submitted to
the Berkeley student body this
I May.
Campus Unity
Powell's official statement,
i released yesterday, took on a
j milder tone. While regretting that
j"the Senate and the elected grad
uate students were unable to ag-
I ree on a plan for the restructur
j ing of tho ASUC in Wednesday
j night's Senate meeting," he ob
! served optimistically that "all
' students on this campus arc work*
; ing together toward an effective,
student government."
There may yet be grounds for
j Powell's stated optimism, but
! Wednesday's debate seems to indi
cate that at Berkeley the pres
sures of both time and emotion
j are working against the posibility
of a saving compromise.
j The showdown at Berkeley over graduate membership in the
j ASI r C lias — temporary at least — fizzled into nothing.
The all-out confrontation, predicted for last \\ ednesday s ASI (,
i Senate meeting, failed to materialize through a long evening of
I tumultuous debate and tenuous compromise which ultimately pro-

duced nothing of substance save
perhaps dissention.
In the face of disunity, ASUC
President Charlie Powell yester
day announced plans for a con
stitutional convention and issued
a call ' for an end to belligerence
and destructive action and for the
beginning of a new era of good
feeling among the students of this
campus."
All efforts to establish a work
ing compromise Wednesday night
! finally came to an abrupt halt
when ten members of the Ber
keley GCC, elected as Senate rep
resentatives on a "freedom ballot"
this week, stalked angrily from
the Senate floor.
GCC Departure
The GCC departure came when
1 the Senate voted 8 to 7, with two
i abstentions, to accept an amend
! merit, proposed by Powell, which
I would have watered down a com-
J promise bill establishing a "Crisis
i Commission" (composed of th e
21-man ASUC Senate and the 10
j GCC representatives) to study the
! dilemma in which the Berkeley
| student government finds itself
! and to recommend by initiative
'proposals for reorganization to
the student body in the May elec
tions.
In the absence of the GCC, the
; amended "Crisis Commission"
1 proposal went down to defeat.
The "Crisis Commission Com
promise" — apparently a time
! buying device was originally
hammered out in the long after
| noon of caucuses which preceded
! the Senate meeting.
The establishment of the com
; mission would have allowed the
j Senate to practically bring the
! graduate representatives within
I the ASUC Senate structure while,
• at the same time, temporarily
'avoiding the question of officially
' seating the GCC an action which
Berkeley Chancellor Martin Mey
! erson has said will force him to
i dissolve the Senate.
Compromise Acceptable?
There was some indication that
the Commission compromise, as
originally agreed upon, would
| have been acceptable to Meyerson,
; but the events of Wednesday
■ night made that a moot point,
i The Wednesday session began
at 7:30 p.m. The Commission Bill
was last on the agenda, and as
j 10:30 rolled around it still hadn't
! come up for debate.
At that point, a member of the
GCC announced the results of the
| freedom vote: 7,184 yes; 868 no
on a constitutional amendment
giving the graduate students
I representation on the Senate, and
| ten GCC senators elected by a
margin of better than 4 to 1.
There was a burst of applause,
j and then Powell recessed the ses
sion for twenty minutes.
New Amendments
During the recess, the GCC
reps and members of SLATE,
Berkeley's liberal political party,
met in a cloak-room caucus to
' revise their plans.
Two amendments would be ad
i ded to the original compromise
Bill: The first would provide that
the Commission hold open meet
! ings every week. The second, and
(most crucial amendment, would
forbid tho regular ASUC from
I "considering or voting on policies
lor financial matters affecting
j next semester's student govern
ment."
The tactic would he this: the
I question of seating the GCC rep
resentatives elected in the free
j dom vote, would lie introduced,
but not seconded. It would thus
! die, for the moment, hut could
| be brought up again at the end of
! debate.
Next, the compromise, with its
I significant new amendments,
would be debated and, presum- 1
, ably passed.
Finally the question of the GCC
.seating would be brought up
again and, quite inevitably de-;
| feated.
At this point, the GCC repre
sentatives would "walk to the

table anyhow and take our
seats."
Powell would adjourn the Sen
ate, but the GCC would remain
J behind, under their own power
j reconvene the session, under the
| auspices of the ASUC senate
| draft a "telegram to governor
; Brown," and, finally, adjourn.
Kill Stalemated
That was the plan at least. In
practice it didn't quite work.
The question of the GCC seal*
I ing was, indeed, brought up. And
| did, indeed, fail for lack of a sec
| ond. But the project stalled on the
| compromise bill.

| ten GCC senators elected by a
margin of better than 4 to 1.
There was a burst of applause,
j and then Powell recessed the ses
sion for twenty minutes.
New Amendments
During the recess, the GCC
reps and members of SLATE,
Berkeley's liberal political party,
met in a cloak-room caucus to
' revise their plans.
Two amendments would be ad
i ded to the original compromise
Bill: The first would provide that
the Commission hold open meet
! ings every week. The second, and
(most crucial amendment, would
forbid tho regular ASUC from
I "considering or voting on policies
lor financial matters affecting
j next semester's student govern
ment."
The tactic would he this: the
I question of seating the GCC rep
resentatives elected in the free
j dom vote, would lie introduced,
but not seconded. It would thus
! die, for the moment, hut could
| be brought up again at the end of
! debate.
Next, the compromise, with its
I significant new amendments,
would be debated and, presum- 1
, ably passed.
Finally the question of the GCC
.seating would be brought up
again and, quite inevitably de-;
| feated.
At this point, the GCC repre
sentatives would "walk to the

table anyhow and take our
seats."
Powell would adjourn the Sen
ate, but the GCC would remain
J behind, under their own power
j reconvene the session, under the
| auspices of the ASUC senate
| draft a "telegram to governor
; Brown," and, finally, adjourn.
Kill Stalemated
That was the plan at least. In
practice it didn't quite work.
The question of the GCC seal*
I ing was, indeed, brought up. And
| did, indeed, fail for lack of a sec
| ond. But the project stalled on the
| compromise bill.
Powell, having second thoughts
j about the consequences of the
j amended version of the bill
j (which he had agreed to intro
duce, under pressure from
I SLATE and the GCC) moved to
amend the controversial section
six so that the Senate was merely
"to consult with" Iho commission
j before considering policies or
financial matters affecting next
| semester's student government.
It wasn't much, but it was
I enough for the CCC.
Powell's amendment passed,
and the graduates walked out
'leaving Berkeley in much the
! same unhappy state in which it
| had been some eight hours before.
Powell Angered
Powell, obviously angered by
Wednesday's events, had a feu
strong words to say about the
GCC members who walked out.
i"I just think that it's very diffi
cult to work with people like
j that who pick up their marbles
land go home every time they
don't get their own way," lie ob
; served to the Daily.
"What we're going to have to
do," he continued, "is get some
thing so basically democratic
I that they'll have to go along or
be relegated to the fringes . . .
They're just going to have to
; cooperate."
What Powell apparently has in
mind is his constitutional conven
tion which would meet to draw
iup a proposal for governmental
! reorganization to be submitted to
the Berkeley student body this
I May.
Campus Unity
Powell's official statement,
i released yesterday, took on a
j milder tone. While regretting that
j"the Senate and the elected grad
uate students were unable to ag-
I ree on a plan for the restructur
j ing of tho ASUC in Wednesday
j night's Senate meeting," he ob
! served optimistically that "all
' students on this campus arc work*
; ing together toward an effective,
student government."
There may yet be grounds for
j Powell's stated optimism, but
! Wednesday's debate seems to indi
cate that at Berkeley the pres
sures of both time and emotion
j are working against the posibility
of a saving compromise.
j The showdown at Berkeley over graduate membership in the
j ASI r C lias — temporary at least — fizzled into nothing.
The all-out confrontation, predicted for last \\ ednesday s ASI (,
i Senate meeting, failed to materialize through a long evening of
I tumultuous debate and tenuous compromise which ultimately pro-

duced nothing of substance save
perhaps dissention.
In the face of disunity, ASUC
President Charlie Powell yester
day announced plans for a con
stitutional convention and issued
a call ' for an end to belligerence
and destructive action and for the
beginning of a new era of good
feeling among the students of this
campus."
All efforts to establish a work
ing compromise Wednesday night
! finally came to an abrupt halt
when ten members of the Ber
keley GCC, elected as Senate rep
resentatives on a "freedom ballot"
this week, stalked angrily from
the Senate floor.
GCC Departure
The GCC departure came when
1 the Senate voted 8 to 7, with two
i abstentions, to accept an amend
! merit, proposed by Powell, which
I would have watered down a com-
J promise bill establishing a "Crisis
i Commission" (composed of th e
21-man ASUC Senate and the 10
j GCC representatives) to study the
! dilemma in which the Berkeley
| student government finds itself
! and to recommend by initiative
'proposals for reorganization to
the student body in the May elec
tions.
In the absence of the GCC, the
; amended "Crisis Commission"
1 proposal went down to defeat.
The "Crisis Commission Com
promise" — apparently a time
! buying device was originally
hammered out in the long after
| noon of caucuses which preceded
! the Senate meeting.
The establishment of the com
; mission would have allowed the
j Senate to practically bring the
! graduate representatives within
I the ASUC Senate structure while,
• at the same time, temporarily
'avoiding the question of officially
' seating the GCC an action which
Berkeley Chancellor Martin Mey
! erson has said will force him to
i dissolve the Senate.
Compromise Acceptable?
There was some indication that
the Commission compromise, as
originally agreed upon, would
| have been acceptable to Meyerson,
; but the events of Wednesday
■ night made that a moot point,
i The Wednesday session began
at 7:30 p.m. The Commission Bill
was last on the agenda, and as
j 10:30 rolled around it still hadn't
! come up for debate.
At that point, a member of the
GCC announced the results of the
| freedom vote: 7,184 yes; 868 no
on a constitutional amendment
giving the graduate students
I representation on the Senate, and
| ten GCC senators elected by a
margin of better than 4 to 1.

keley GCC, elected as Senate rep
resentatives on a "freedom ballot"
this week, stalked angrily from
the Senate floor.
GCC Departure
The GCC departure came when
1 the Senate voted 8 to 7, with two
i abstentions, to accept an amend
! merit, proposed by Powell, which
I would have watered down a com-
J promise bill establishing a "Crisis
i Commission" (composed of th e
21-man ASUC Senate and the 10
j GCC representatives) to study the
! dilemma in which the Berkeley
| student government finds itself
! and to recommend by initiative
'proposals for reorganization to
the student body in the May elec
tions.
In the absence of the GCC, the
; amended "Crisis Commission"
1 proposal went down to defeat.
The "Crisis Commission Com
promise" — apparently a time
! buying device was originally
hammered out in the long after
| noon of caucuses which preceded
! the Senate meeting.
The establishment of the com
; mission would have allowed the
j Senate to practically bring the
! graduate representatives within
I the ASUC Senate structure while,
• at the same time, temporarily
'avoiding the question of officially
' seating the GCC an action which
Berkeley Chancellor Martin Mey
! erson has said will force him to
i dissolve the Senate.
Compromise Acceptable?
There was some indication that
the Commission compromise, as
originally agreed upon, would
| have been acceptable to Meyerson,
; but the events of Wednesday
■ night made that a moot point,
i The Wednesday session began
at 7:30 p.m. The Commission Bill
was last on the agenda, and as
j 10:30 rolled around it still hadn't
! come up for debate.
At that point, a member of the
GCC announced the results of the
| freedom vote: 7,184 yes; 868 no
on a constitutional amendment
giving the graduate students
I representation on the Senate, and
| ten GCC senators elected by a
margin of better than 4 to 1.
There was a burst of applause,
j and then Powell recessed the ses
sion for twenty minutes.
New Amendments
During the recess, the GCC
reps and members of SLATE,
Berkeley's liberal political party,
met in a cloak-room caucus to
' revise their plans.
Two amendments would be ad
i ded to the original compromise
Bill: The first would provide that
the Commission hold open meet
! ings every week. The second, and
(most crucial amendment, would
forbid tho regular ASUC from
I "considering or voting on policies
lor financial matters affecting
j next semester's student govern
ment."
The tactic would he this: the
I question of seating the GCC rep
resentatives elected in the free
j dom vote, would lie introduced,
but not seconded. It would thus
! die, for the moment, hut could
| be brought up again at the end of
! debate.
Next, the compromise, with its
I significant new amendments,
would be debated and, presum- 1
, ably passed.
Finally the question of the GCC
.seating would be brought up
again and, quite inevitably de-;
| feated.
At this point, the GCC repre
sentatives would "walk to the

table anyhow and take our
seats."
Powell would adjourn the Sen
ate, but the GCC would remain
J behind, under their own power
j reconvene the session, under the
| auspices of the ASUC senate
| draft a "telegram to governor
; Brown," and, finally, adjourn.
Kill Stalemated
That was the plan at least. In
practice it didn't quite work.
The question of the GCC seal*
I ing was, indeed, brought up. And
| did, indeed, fail for lack of a sec
| ond. But the project stalled on the
| compromise bill.
Powell, having second thoughts
j about the consequences of the
j amended version of the bill
j (which he had agreed to intro
duce, under pressure from
I SLATE and the GCC) moved to
amend the controversial section
six so that the Senate was merely
"to consult with" Iho commission
j before considering policies or
financial matters affecting next
| semester's student government.
It wasn't much, but it was
I enough for the CCC.
Powell's amendment passed,
and the graduates walked out
'leaving Berkeley in much the
! same unhappy state in which it
| had been some eight hours before.
Powell Angered
Powell, obviously angered by
Wednesday's events, had a feu
strong words to say about the
GCC members who walked out.
i"I just think that it's very diffi
cult to work with people like
j that who pick up their marbles
land go home every time they
don't get their own way," lie ob
; served to the Daily.
"What we're going to have to
do," he continued, "is get some
thing so basically democratic
I that they'll have to go along or
be relegated to the fringes . . .
They're just going to have to
; cooperate."
What Powell apparently has in
mind is his constitutional conven
tion which would meet to draw
iup a proposal for governmental
! reorganization to be submitted to
the Berkeley student body this
I May.
Campus Unity
Powell's official statement,
i released yesterday, took on a
j milder tone. While regretting that
j"the Senate and the elected grad
uate students were unable to ag-
I ree on a plan for the restructur
j ing of tho ASUC in Wednesday
j night's Senate meeting," he ob
! served optimistically that "all
' students on this campus arc work*
; ing together toward an effective,
student government."
There may yet be grounds for
j Powell's stated optimism, but
! Wednesday's debate seems to indi
cate that at Berkeley the pres
sures of both time and emotion
j are working against the posibility
of a saving compromise.
