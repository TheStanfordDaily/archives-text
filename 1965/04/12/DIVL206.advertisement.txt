Who Crucified Jesus Christ?
Xo pronouncements of theologians or debates of learned
scholars are necessary to answer the question "who crucified
Jesus Christ" for the Bible is quite explicit in recording the in
cidents and events which led to the crucifixion of the Lord of
Glory. (Matthews 26-27, Mark 15, Luke 22-23, John I<S-1 ( >.)
()|" i'ir.st importance is the assertion Jesus Christ Himself
made concerning I lis impending death :"I am the good shepherd
. . . and 1 lay down my life for my sheep ... no one takes it
from me, but I lay it down on my own accord. 1 have power to lay
it down and 1 have power to take it up again ; this charge 1 have
received from my Father" (John 10:14-18).
The circumstances of the crucifixion of Jcsns Christ are re
corder in the words of the Apostle Peter who said, "Men of
Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to
von by God with might words and wonders and signs which God
! did through Mini in your midst, as yon yourselves know —this
Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowl
edge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless
men. But God raised I lim up, having loosed the pangs of death,
because it was not possible for Him to be held by it . . . Let all
: the house of Israel therefore know assuredly that God has made
1 lim both lord and Christ . . (Acts 2 :22-36).
Now it is not the intent of the Bible to fix the blame but to
enlighten men everywhere and to call them to seek the forgive
ness of God, for Ihe Lord esus ChriJst voluntarily died on the
cross for your sins and mine. The deepest answer to the question
"who crucified Christ" is that you and I did.
The cross of Jesus Christ is the expression of God's love to
ward us. for this is how God has reconciled man to Himself:
"And I le is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only,
but also for the sins of the entire world" (I John 2-2).
Recognize the seriousness of your sin (that is, your inde
pendence from God) and receive the forgiveness and reconcilia
tion with (iod which the Cross has made possible. What greater
love could you ever hope to find?

Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowl
edge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless
men. But God raised I lim up, having loosed the pangs of death,
because it was not possible for Him to be held by it . . . Let all

enlighten men everywhere and to call them to seek the forgive

"who crucified Christ" is that you and I did.
The cross of Jesus Christ is the expression of God's love to
