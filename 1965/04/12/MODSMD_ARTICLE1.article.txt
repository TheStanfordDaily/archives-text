# McBride's 'Slowdown' Releases GRIP
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor (Fourth in a Series 
In retrospect, the ASSU Presidential cam
paign last year appears to be one ol protest
and reaction.
John Bryson, a supporter of Rosencranz
arid VVedin, was reacting against the adminis
trative red tape—"we need a wider base of
student participation and a broadened view of
the role of student government."
Ed Kaiser was reacting against The Daily—
". . . . I have risked the disfavor of those 1
cannot journalistically respect instead of
prostituting my personal and political convic
tions for their support . . . The other candi
dates, who have sought the favor of The Daily
have run typical campaigns and have become
typical candidates . . ."
Steve Gruber protested the very existence
of student government. He proposed to abolish
LASSU, replacing it with mass meetings in the

Stadium —"Direct democracy is our only hope."
Scott Mcßride opposed the current trend
in student government. He was against the
Legislature discussing off-campus issues, and
he advocated making the Civil Rights Secreta
riat into a voluntary organization under the
auspices of the Political Union.
Last Moment Campaign
Mcßride had found the right form of pro
test and won the election 1,649 to 1,354 for
Bryson. Kaiser and Gruber were far behind.
According to one anonymous student, who
observed the campaigning closely, the ingredi
ents of Mcßride's victory were (1) massive fra
ternity support, (2) bettor organization, and
(3) Mcßride was a little better speaker than
his opponents.
Mcßride, like Armin Rosencranz two years
before, entered the campaign at the last mo
ment. He took out a petition one day before
it was due. However, his organization, though

it began late, was by all accounts—the best
of the four candidates.
The Gruber Approach
Support from the fraternities was provoked
by the Legislature's tentative consideration of
rush policy. A rush committee had been estab
lished, and the fraternities were "stirred up"
to quote our observer. They wanted to write
their own rush policy. Mcßride agreed that
rush was a matter "outside the Legislature,"
whereas Bryson held that LASSU must ap
prove rush policy.
On the organizational level, Mcßride was
able to utilize the pledge class of his own fra
ternity — Kappa Sigma to garner votes in
both Wilbur and Stern. After the election, Mc-
Bride was to credit 150 campaign workers
for his victory. They even managed to seques
ter approximately 500 hats left over by the
Ford Caravan group and plaster Scott's name
on t hem.

Gruber took another approach. He gave
speeches on "Sex and the American Way ol
Death" in the stacks and in front of the Mau
soleum. He also held $25 a plate dinners to
rally financial support.
The issues in the campaign were clear cut,
especially after Gruber's GRIPE (Gruber's
Revulsion at Inane Political Efforts) and
Kaiser's gripe against The Daily were elimi
nated in the primary.
Mcßride stressed "experimentation" in stu
dent government, especially increased student
faculty-administration communication. He also
said that the executive branch of student gov
vernment should speak out less on certain
issues—student involvement in off-campus
issues should not be organized and directed
through the President's office.
He won with this appeal. "Many students
thought things were going too fast," our ob
server concluded, "it was time to slow down
a bit."

During the first part of Mcßride's term,
things stayed relatively slowed down. The new
President preferred to work with the faculty
and administration as much as was possible.
'Solidified Advances'
"He solidified the advances made in previ
ous years," a high ranking officer in student
government who is often critical of the Presi
dent told this reporter, "hut he was doing it
on an informal level, which meant the dia
logue would collapse with his departure."
Aid in "slowing things down" was given by
Robert Naylor, then editor of The Daily, who
usually counseled moderation if not inaction
in his editorials.
However, as the year ended, several diverse
factors were beginning to coalesce to form the
nucleus of what the Palo Alto Time s would
later call the "Student Autonomy Movement."
It would begin to the accompaniment of
loud rumblings from across the Bay.
