# SC Topples Trackmen
## 
### PETE KING 
. USC's strength in the field
events, a shocking Trojan half
mile sweep, and a Stanford mis
hap in the intermediate hurdles
gave USC a thrilling, 75-70 track
victory over Stanford Saturday
at Foothill College.
■ A brilliant effort by Stanford's

Paul Schlicke and Weym Kirk
land in the two-mile had pulled
the Indians into a 70-70 tie with
only the mile relay remaining.
But the relay had been conceded
to USC in pre-meet forecasts, and
the Trojans predictably won by
15 yards to gain their 30th
straight track win over Stanford.
The meet was switched to Foot
hill's all-weather track because
heavy rain had made a soggy
mess of Stanford's cinder track.
Stanford Leads
Going into the intermediate hur
dules, Stanford held a 53-51 lead,
and a 1-2 Indian finish would vir
tually guarantee a Stanford team
victory, since the two-mile and
discus, strong Stanford events,
had not yet been held.
Stanford's Greg Ford and Bud
Walsh led as predicted halfway
through the hurdles. Then, Ford
tripped over the fifth of the eight
hurdles, sprawling to the track.
Ford's mishap probably cost the
Tribe an additional three points
for second place, according to
coach Pay ton Jordan.
But, as in any track meet, every
event is equally important. Little
disappointments mounted for
Stanford throughout the meet.
Bruce Wilhelm failed to place in
the shot put, and the Trojans
swept that event.
880 Shocker
The biggest shocker, however,
took place in the 880, an event
where Stanford has traditionally
been strong. The Indians' strategy

i was to burn oul the Trojan run*
! ners by sotting a killing pace. Har
lan Andrews ran the first 440 in
j a blazing 54.5 seconds, and team
mate Dave Deubncr ran alongside
to box out USC's Bruce Bess and
j Dennis Carr.
But the strategy failed. An
i drews faded as expected, but
i Deubncr tired also, and the three
| USC runners passed him to sweep
• the event. Deubner had earlier
run 4:09.8 in the mile, his best
ever, and that effort undoubtedly
; winded him, whereas the Trojan
880 men wore fresh.
The lost points in the 880 were
| seemingly recaptured in the very
next race. Larry Questad led a
! Stanford sweep in the 220, win
ning in 21.6 seconds. Eric Frische
; ran 21.7 and Dale Rubin 22.0. But
j if the Tribe were to beat USC,
they could afford no mistakes and
had to pull off upsets. They had
several upsets, but also faltered
when they could ill afford it.
Day Began Well
The day began well for S t a n
ford. A beautiful baton pass from
Eric Frische to Dale Rubin sprung
the 440 relay team to an early
lead, and Stanford won in 40.9
i seconds, tying the 15-year-old
! school record and establishing a
I meet record.
A killing pace in the mile by
Andrews wrecked USC. Paul
J Schlicke won in 4:07.3, Andrews
was second in 1:08.7, and Deub
ner third. Initial and final laps
' of 59.1 and 60 seconds wore out
Trojan Doug Calhoun, and aided
5 the Stanford sweep.
Then Jim Eshelman provided a
I crowd-pleasing come-through per
formance in the polo vault, clear
ing 15 feet on his final attempt
and going on to win at 15-6, ahead
j of Trojan Bill Fosdick's 15-0.
Ken Fraser scored an upset sec
ond place in the 440, behind USC's
, Dave Buck, who ran away from
! everyone in a sparkling 47.3. Bud
'Walsh broad-jumped 24-l 1 L», his
j best ever, for second place, and
, Frische took second in the 100 be
hind Questad when USC's Dwight
Middleton pulled up after 40 yards
with a stiff leg.
USC Won Field Events
But USC won five of the seven
field events, out scoring Stanford,
41-22. Mahoney Samuels set a
meet record in the triple jump
| with 48-4 'i, and Gary Carlsen
I flipped the discus 181-512, his
j best ever, to beat Card Bob
! Stoecker's fine 173- J £ effort.
Stanford was hoping to pin a
! second straight loss on USC,
' which hasn't happened since 1928,
j but Troy maintained its track su
; premacy over the Indians for the
' 32nd year in a row.
