# Lacrosse Team Gets First Ever Win Against Marines
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Playing as if a championship
were at stake, Stanford's lacrosse
team won its first game of the
season, Saturday, in what could be
termed Stanford's finest hour.
The Indians defeated the strong
Camp Pendleton Marines, 5-4, be
fore a small partisan S t a n 112 or d
crowd, for the first time in three i
years.
Stanford controlled the enlire
contest and, even though the Ma- j
rines were without the services
of a couple of their key perform-1
ers, showed brillance on their
passing, defensive savagery, a n d
team work.
No similarity could be seen,
between this team and the one'
that lost to The San Marino La-i
crosse Club a week ago.
Although the entire team per
formed excellently, several play
ers were outstanding for the In-;
dian squad. Outstanding freshmen
included Goalie and Captain Mel
Ellis, who made several great
saves, and mid-fielders Mont y
Orr, with his hustle and speed,
and Glenn Thomas, with his pass
ing, revealed that Stanford's po
tential is ready for action.
Veteran attackman Pete Eak
land and midfielders Bob Murphy
and Parker Llewellyn also added
vital contributions to Stanford's
cause.
The Marines used a zone de
fense throughout the game and
the Indians had difficulty at first
in penetrating it. From tho start,
however, Stanford showed a domi
nance over the Marines in steal
ing passes and blocking shots.
The Marines were the first to
score as Skip Rudolph found a
corner of the net after a minute ,
of action.

In the second quarter, however,
Stanford began jamming up the
Marine's defense and were so ef
fective in their offensive maneu
vers and fakes that they lead at
halftime 3-1.
Early Lead
Murphy skipped one by the
Marine goalie to start the Card
scoring. Thomas then put the
Indians ahead on a bounce shot
that landed in the upper confines
of the net. Eakland converted
a Murphy pass just before inter
mission.
The spirited hosts increased
their margin to 4-1 as Eakland
scored his second goal of the game
early in the second half. The
score was 4-2 going into the
fourth quarter.
The fourth quarter nemesis
that beat the Indians in their two
previous encounters with the Ma
rines presented a real danger up
to the final minutes.

With a change in game tempo, |
(he Marines pushed through two |
goals both by Skip Rudolph in |
the final period to knot the score!
at 4-4.
In the final minutes of Ihc game
Stanford missed several shots for
the go-ahead goal before Monty
Orr bounced one in with a min
ute and a half of action remain
ing.
