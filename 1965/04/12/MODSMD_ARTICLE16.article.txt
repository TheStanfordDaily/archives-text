# Reform for the Row?
## 
### 
The Inter-Fraternity Council will choose a
president tonight in an election that will show
whether or not tho Row is seriously interested
in introspection and internal reform.
One progressive candidate with several ideas
for strengthening both the structure and effec
tiveness of the IFC is running against two more
"traditional" fraternity men.
This candidate has suggested an overhauling
of the delegation of responsibility and authority
within the organizational structure of the IFC,
making the Council's several standing commit
tees into semi-autonomous bodies. By delegating
some of the more routine business of and the
multitudinous complaints against fraternities
to these committes, it is hoped that the unwieldy
Council itself might be left to consider the more
philosophical problems behind reforming the un
satisfactory rush and initiation procedures now
in existence.
It is hoped, too, that an IFC organized along
these lines would have time to consider thor
oughly ways in which the academic and extra
curricular lives of fraternity men might be
brought up to the level of the University as a
whole.
LASSU is currently considering a resolution
that would create a Special Commission on Fra
ternities, to be appointed by the Speaker, which
would study the possibility that "some Stanford
fraternities' pre-initiation procedures are in vio
lation of the Fundamental Standard."
One seriously wonders whether the Legisla
ture, and especially those of its members who

are pushing hardest for the investigation, are
truly qualified to conduct an inquiry into the
machinations of a system about which they know
so little.
When one considers some of the deleterious
activities perpetuated by certain of the fraterni
ties during both rush and initiation — activities
both detrimental and humiliating to the individ
uals involved, as well as blatant violations of any
reasonable interpretation of the Fundamental
Standard — it becomes impossible to deny that
an investigation of some sort is necessary.
The IFC tonight will, in effect, decide
whether or not the fraternities will take the initia
tive in this matter, instead of waiting, as usual,
to react defensively to each new criticism of Life
On The Row.
If the IFC is willing to take the responsibility
to conduct such an investigation, then it is fitting
that the Council do so. If, indeed, its members
do understand the internal problems of the sys
tem better than any other body on campus (as
IFC President Bill McGee claims), then it
should recognize its shortcomings and be willing
to correct them.
If the fraternities are not able to take up this
responsibility, then perhaps it will be time for
the campus as a whole (as represented, for in
stance, by a commission such as the one sug
gested in the LASSU resolution) to do it for
them.
The outcome of tonights elections should
show the lFC's willingness to prove the sincerity
of its stated good intentions. J.R.
