## Student Government and 'Catch-SU' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In Jon Roise's interview w i th (
Richard Guggenhimc, tho Trustee j
President reveals an attitude that J
is more than faintly reminiscent j
of Joseph Heller: perhaps it could !
bo called Catch-SU.
There seems to be a basic atti
tude among the administrators of
Stanford University which would
allow truly mature students com
plete self-government. Maturity,
however, seems to be defined by
them in terms of the students' re
action to authority; mature in
dividuals will not be in revolt
against established authority
symbols. If the students are not
reacting against authority, then
they will accept these symbols,
and there is no need for self
government; the students will see
that the administration always
acts in the University's best inter
ests. But if the students desire
self-government, then they are in
revolt against the authority of the
University and are, by definition,
not ready for self-government.
This is Catch-SU.

Until there is a fundamental
change in the attitude of the ad
ministrators of the University,
until they recognize that the stu
dents are not children in summer
camp to be taken care of until
they go home, but rather adult
and in many cases voting and tax
paying members of the commu
nity, student participation in 112 h e
affairs of the University will bo
limited to a few token powers —
candy bribes to keep the children
quiet.

• Hashers Wince
Editor, Thr Daily:
We share with hashers in every
dorm a growing distaste for hair
curlers and curler bonnets at
meal-time.
We wince at pink lace bonnets
defensively over forehead and
ears. We groan at limp shower
caps draped offensively over
bristling rollers.
A necessary evil? Perhaps. But

we point to the many coeds who
somehow confine their curlers to
their private cubbyholes. We ap
plaud wholeheartedly the cultured
young woman who told us: "This
is one thing that I am saving for
my husband!"

In Jon Roise's interview w i th (
Richard Guggenhimc, tho Trustee j
President reveals an attitude that J
is more than faintly reminiscent j
of Joseph Heller: perhaps it could !
bo called Catch-SU.
There seems to be a basic atti
tude among the administrators of
Stanford University which would
allow truly mature students com
plete self-government. Maturity,
however, seems to be defined by
them in terms of the students' re
action to authority; mature in
dividuals will not be in revolt
against established authority
symbols. If the students are not
reacting against authority, then
they will accept these symbols,
and there is no need for self
government; the students will see
that the administration always
acts in the University's best inter
ests. But if the students desire
self-government, then they are in
revolt against the authority of the
University and are, by definition,
not ready for self-government.
This is Catch-SU.

Until there is a fundamental
change in the attitude of the ad
ministrators of the University,
until they recognize that the stu
dents are not children in summer
camp to be taken care of until
they go home, but rather adult
and in many cases voting and tax
paying members of the commu
nity, student participation in 112 h e
affairs of the University will bo
limited to a few token powers —
candy bribes to keep the children
quiet.

• Hashers Wince
Editor, Thr Daily:
We share with hashers in every
dorm a growing distaste for hair
curlers and curler bonnets at
meal-time.
We wince at pink lace bonnets
defensively over forehead and
ears. We groan at limp shower
caps draped offensively over
bristling rollers.
A necessary evil? Perhaps. But

we point to the many coeds who
somehow confine their curlers to
their private cubbyholes. We ap
plaud wholeheartedly the cultured
young woman who told us: "This
is one thing that I am saving for
my husband!"
