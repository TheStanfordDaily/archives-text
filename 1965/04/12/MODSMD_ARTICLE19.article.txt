## ASSU Amendment Forces Candidates to Realign 
### Steve Leopold 
The Legislature played an April Fool's Day prank on the pant- j
ing aspirants for the ASSU Presidency, and the confusion hasn't :
cleared up yet.
By an overwhelming majority, LASSU approved a By-Laws I
change that would force candidates ior both the Presidency and

the Vice-Presidency to run on" 1
tickets.
The change was only logical,
given the new duties of the Vice-
President as proposed in the
amendment to the ASSU Consti
tution being voted on today and
tomorrow. If the Vice-President's
office becomes a glorified and
more prestigious version of the
current job of administrative as
sistant to the President, then the
President would naturally want a
Vice-President who would work
for him rather than something
thfl voters —in the ultimate wis
dom-swept into office.
Examples of this often humor
ous situation are not hard to find.
One of the bigger bungles of the
Founding Fathers was the Elec
toral College, and before its mode
of operation was changed it had
put Adams and Jefferson to
gether. Today, there are gover
nor's who can't leave their ownj
states for fear the Lieutenant j
Governor will pardon some of his i
political friends and otherwise j
wreak havoc.
Problems on the Horizon
Thus, the ticket proposal makes j
sense. And since the Executive
Reorganization Amendment also
makes sense, there would seem
to be few problems on the hori
zon.
However, there are some politi- j
cal drawbacks to this whole
scheme. First, it would probably
eliminate coeds from the upper
echelon of de jure student govern
ment. Granted, that under the
present order, the female Vice-
President has little real power,
but there is an opportunity for
initiative and — at the least —
some prestige to the job.
Second, the complexities in ar
ranging tickets are intriguing to
specialists in the field of student
politics, but painful to those who
have to make the arrangements.
And the mad scramble has al
ready begun.
Stern and Bow
Balanced tickets will undoubt
edly be the order of the day. The
Row candidate will try to fin d

someone acceptable from Stern, |
and vice versa, hut what exactly !
will they present for a platform
on rush? Again, someone is going ;
to try and influence the graduate'
vote, but how does one win the ;
GCC's support without alienating j
these who salivate at the mention
of the organization?
Finally, one could pick a girl
as a running mate, but so far, j
none of the undeclared candidates 1
have shown much interest in this. 1
Moreover, each candidate for
President will have the problem
of finding an efficient administra- j
tor who is also an articulate cam
paigner. ff the latter attribute
takes precedent, then the ASSU
will suffer for it.
Pluses and Drawbacks
In the last analysis, then, the j
proposed amendment has its or-1
ganizational pluses as well as its j
political drawbacks. The issues j
may be blurred due to political ex- i
pediency, but perhaps not.
On the whole, it should be a
worthwhile experiment.

pediency, but perhaps not.
On the whole, it should be a
worthwhile experiment.
The Legislature played an April Fool's Day prank on the pant- j
ing aspirants for the ASSU Presidency, and the confusion hasn't :
cleared up yet.
By an overwhelming majority, LASSU approved a By-Laws I
change that would force candidates ior both the Presidency and

the Vice-Presidency to run on" 1
tickets.
The change was only logical,
given the new duties of the Vice-
President as proposed in the
amendment to the ASSU Consti
tution being voted on today and
tomorrow. If the Vice-President's
office becomes a glorified and
more prestigious version of the
current job of administrative as
sistant to the President, then the
President would naturally want a
Vice-President who would work
for him rather than something
thfl voters —in the ultimate wis
dom-swept into office.
Examples of this often humor
ous situation are not hard to find.
One of the bigger bungles of the
Founding Fathers was the Elec
toral College, and before its mode
of operation was changed it had
put Adams and Jefferson to
gether. Today, there are gover
nor's who can't leave their ownj
states for fear the Lieutenant j
Governor will pardon some of his i
political friends and otherwise j
wreak havoc.
Problems on the Horizon
Thus, the ticket proposal makes j
sense. And since the Executive
Reorganization Amendment also
makes sense, there would seem
to be few problems on the hori
zon.
However, there are some politi- j
cal drawbacks to this whole
scheme. First, it would probably
eliminate coeds from the upper
echelon of de jure student govern
ment. Granted, that under the
present order, the female Vice-
President has little real power,
but there is an opportunity for
initiative and — at the least —
some prestige to the job.
Second, the complexities in ar
ranging tickets are intriguing to
specialists in the field of student
politics, but painful to those who
have to make the arrangements.
And the mad scramble has al
ready begun.
Stern and Bow
Balanced tickets will undoubt
edly be the order of the day. The
Row candidate will try to fin d

someone acceptable from Stern, |
and vice versa, hut what exactly !
will they present for a platform
on rush? Again, someone is going ;
to try and influence the graduate'
vote, but how does one win the ;
GCC's support without alienating j
these who salivate at the mention
of the organization?
Finally, one could pick a girl
as a running mate, but so far, j
none of the undeclared candidates 1
have shown much interest in this. 1
Moreover, each candidate for
President will have the problem
of finding an efficient administra- j
tor who is also an articulate cam
paigner. ff the latter attribute
takes precedent, then the ASSU
will suffer for it.
Pluses and Drawbacks
In the last analysis, then, the j
proposed amendment has its or-1
ganizational pluses as well as its j
political drawbacks. The issues j
may be blurred due to political ex- i
pediency, but perhaps not.
On the whole, it should be a
worthwhile experiment.
