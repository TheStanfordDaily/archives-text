# IFC ELECTIONS
## Fraternity Issues Discussed 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
The three announced candidates for the presi
dency of the Inter-Fraternity Council Bill Hen
ley of Phi Kappa Sigma, Rick Sawyer of Phi Gam
ma Delta, and Rob Freeman of Sigma Chi -stated
their positions on various fraternity issues in inter
views with The Daily yesterday.
The election, to tx 1 held tonight in Room 27."i
of Tresiddcr Union beginning at 7:30, will also
involve the selection of a vice-president.
Bill Henley said that he was upset with recent
criticism of fraternities and "selective association."
Part ot the problem, he said, is the lack of any
real communication between fraternities. To cor
rect this situation, he said he would encourage
more inter-fraternity functions, and would work to
ward the establishment of a guest-speaker pro
gram, to be sponsored by IFC and open to all
houses, in order to show that "the IFC is doing
something."
He said he thought that IPC should set up a
"self-introspection" committee to investigate prob
lems of rush and initiation.
In regard to rush policy, Henley stated that it
"should be strictly enforced." Those parts of it
which cannot be enforced, he said, should be
"changed or eliminated" to conform to practice.
Henley expressed concern over the lack of par
ticipation of fraternity men in the extracurricular
life of the University. He said that Ihe chief blame
for this was that most fraternity men "don't know
what's open to them," and said that he would at
tempt to correct this by having the IFC publicize
positions open in various student activities.
Freeman said that as presider, he would effect
a general reorganization of the IFC to make the
Council a more effective body.

He feels that IFC can no longer be a "one man
show." To this end, he would delegate more au
thority to the chairmen of IPC's seven standing
committees so that most of the Council's "trivial"
work could be dealt with outside of meetings of
the entire Council.
Freeman said that he would also add
a Legislative Position Committee to the list of
standing committees "to increase contact and inter
est in LASSU by the fraternities."
Freeman would create a "more wieldy" Steer
ing Committee, composed of the standing commit
tees' chairmen, to meet bi-weekly with the presi
dent and tho IFC Board.
"You're never going to revamp the fraternities
overnight," he said. "'This is intended as an inter
mediate step."
He said that it was his understanding that
Dean of Men Robert Cordon has already called
for an investigation of initiation and rush prac
tices, and that he would bo willing to have the
IFC take on full responsibility for the inquiry.
Rick Sawyer told The Daily he would seek
greater participation from house presidents and
IFC representatives so that "new ideas" might
come from them as well as from himself.
Sawyer said that hi 1 favors a strong IFC, and
that as president he would promote "stronger in
ter-fraternity relations" in order to "get the IFC
off the ground."
He said he was not sure thai an investigation
of rush was necessary, or that, if it were, who
would conduct it.
"I can't see any violent changes as being neces
sary," he stated, "but I'm open for new ideas."

that as president he would promote "stronger in

He said he was not sure thai an investigation

would conduct it.

their positions on various fraternity issues in inter
views with The Daily yesterday.

of Tresiddcr Union beginning at 7:30, will also
involve the selection of a vice-president.
Bill Henley said that he was upset with recent
criticism of fraternities and "selective association."
Part ot the problem, he said, is the lack of any
real communication between fraternities. To cor
rect this situation, he said he would encourage
more inter-fraternity functions, and would work to
ward the establishment of a guest-speaker pro
gram, to be sponsored by IFC and open to all
houses, in order to show that "the IFC is doing
something."
He said he thought that IPC should set up a
"self-introspection" committee to investigate prob
lems of rush and initiation.
In regard to rush policy, Henley stated that it
"should be strictly enforced." Those parts of it
which cannot be enforced, he said, should be
"changed or eliminated" to conform to practice.
Henley expressed concern over the lack of par
ticipation of fraternity men in the extracurricular
life of the University. He said that Ihe chief blame
for this was that most fraternity men "don't know
what's open to them," and said that he would at
tempt to correct this by having the IFC publicize
positions open in various student activities.
Freeman said that as presider, he would effect
a general reorganization of the IFC to make the
Council a more effective body.

He feels that IFC can no longer be a "one man
show." To this end, he would delegate more au
thority to the chairmen of IPC's seven standing
committees so that most of the Council's "trivial"
work could be dealt with outside of meetings of
the entire Council.
Freeman said that he would also add
a Legislative Position Committee to the list of
standing committees "to increase contact and inter
est in LASSU by the fraternities."
Freeman would create a "more wieldy" Steer
ing Committee, composed of the standing commit
tees' chairmen, to meet bi-weekly with the presi
dent and tho IFC Board.
"You're never going to revamp the fraternities
overnight," he said. "'This is intended as an inter
mediate step."
He said that it was his understanding that
Dean of Men Robert Cordon has already called
for an investigation of initiation and rush prac
tices, and that he would bo willing to have the
IFC take on full responsibility for the inquiry.
Rick Sawyer told The Daily he would seek
greater participation from house presidents and
IFC representatives so that "new ideas" might
come from them as well as from himself.
