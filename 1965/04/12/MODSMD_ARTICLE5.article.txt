## Social Regs Action Seen 
### JAMES BRISCOE Managing Editor 
The Committee 011 University |
Policy (COUP) and tlu* Ad-[
visory Board of the* Academic'
Council, meeting in joint session
Friday, approved unanimously j
the .judicial resolution issued by
the Committee of 10, subject to!
three interpretations.
The bodies also adopted a reso- j
lution stating that until the Stu- ]
dent Affairs and Services Com-j
mittee acts on the proposed !
changes in social regulations, the
old l egs will remain in effect. The
Legislature, which adopted the
new regulations on April 1. pro-j
vided they should take effect April i
16.
Interpretations
According to Howard Brooks, i
Executive Secretary of COUP,j
the interpretations of the judiciali
resolution voted were:
• All appeals from the Dean of 1
Students, if a student options to!
have his case decided by the dean. I
will be to a student-faculty ap
peals board mutually agreed upon
by the Legislature and the fac
ulty, and not to student judicial
councils.
• In the event of a conflict oj
ASSU and University policy, the '
former shall be binding only so j
far as the student judicial coun-'
cils are concerned.
• If a student is tried by faculty
tribunals, he will be guaranteed ;
only "all procedural rights"
granted by the ASSU Constitu
tion.
The bodies also took action to j
begin setting up immediately the !
faculty tribunals outlined in the I
resolution by the Committee of 115. I
I Brooks indicated that these tri
bunals would be of a permanent
nature.
Social Regs Resolution
The resolution on Social Regu
! lations provides that the present
' regulations shall remain in effect
j until the Student Affairs and ser
• vices commit te has had time to
study and act upon the proposed
I changes.
The resolution was apparently
i in response to the bill passed by
the Legislature which provides
; that the new regs will go into
j effect this Friday.
However, a confrontation be
tween the Legislature and Admin

istration will probably be avoided
as the Student Affairs and Ser
vices Committee meets today, and
according to Professor Charles
Drekmeier, a member of the com
mit te, "it seems quite definite that
|the regulations! will come to a
vote."
Drekmeier indicated that the
committee is anxious to reach a
decision before the meeting of the
Board of Trustees Thursday.
He expressed optimism that the
proposed changes would be ap
proved by the Committee. "I think
the committee has been generally
impressed by the method in which
tlie regulations were formulated,"
he told The Daily.

The Committee 011 University |
Policy (COUP) and tlu* Ad-[
visory Board of the* Academic'
Council, meeting in joint session
Friday, approved unanimously j
the .judicial resolution issued by
the Committee of 10, subject to!
three interpretations.
The bodies also adopted a reso- j
lution stating that until the Stu- ]
dent Affairs and Services Com-j
mittee acts on the proposed !
changes in social regulations, the
old l egs will remain in effect. The
Legislature, which adopted the
new regulations on April 1. pro-j
vided they should take effect April i
16.
Interpretations
According to Howard Brooks, i
Executive Secretary of COUP,j
the interpretations of the judiciali
resolution voted were:
• All appeals from the Dean of 1
Students, if a student options to!
have his case decided by the dean. I
will be to a student-faculty ap
peals board mutually agreed upon
by the Legislature and the fac
ulty, and not to student judicial
councils.
• In the event of a conflict oj
ASSU and University policy, the '
former shall be binding only so j
far as the student judicial coun-'
cils are concerned.
• If a student is tried by faculty
tribunals, he will be guaranteed ;
only "all procedural rights"
granted by the ASSU Constitu
tion.
The bodies also took action to j
begin setting up immediately the !
faculty tribunals outlined in the I
resolution by the Committee of 115. I
I Brooks indicated that these tri
bunals would be of a permanent
nature.
Social Regs Resolution
The resolution on Social Regu
! lations provides that the present
' regulations shall remain in effect
j until the Student Affairs and ser
• vices commit te has had time to
study and act upon the proposed
I changes.
The resolution was apparently
i in response to the bill passed by
the Legislature which provides
; that the new regs will go into
j effect this Friday.
However, a confrontation be
tween the Legislature and Admin

istration will probably be avoided
as the Student Affairs and Ser
vices Committee meets today, and
according to Professor Charles
Drekmeier, a member of the com
mit te, "it seems quite definite that
|the regulations! will come to a
vote."
Drekmeier indicated that the
committee is anxious to reach a
decision before the meeting of the
Board of Trustees Thursday.
He expressed optimism that the
proposed changes would be ap
proved by the Committee. "I think
the committee has been generally
impressed by the method in which
tlie regulations were formulated,"
he told The Daily.
