## 
### 
Thirty-one Stanford faculty
' members and students will form
' the nucleus of a new coordinating
group, tho Stanford Association
iof University Scholars, Wednes
day night in the large lounge of
; Tresidder at 8 p.m.
According to a spokesman for
j Ihe group, Robert Rosen, "Th c
1 need for an organization that
stresses the common role of both
I students and faculty as members
of a community of scholars has
; long existed."
This group, which plans to ex
pand to a national organization
soon, will attempt to establish a
'bond between faculty and stu
| dents to maintain a "clear af
i firmation of the necessary nature
j of the University as a community
: of scholars."
Origins of SAI'S
The impetus for tho Stanford
Association of University Schol

ars grew out of a meeting held
immediately after t li e spring
break which was called by Rosen
and Professor Seeley. The planned
Wednesday night meeting, how
over, will be open 10 all interested
faculty and students and will fea
ture an outlining of the organiza
tional plans of the group.
An "open letter to Stanford Uni

versity scholars" being distrib
uted by the group illustrates the
fact that presently there is no
group, national or otherwise, that
represents the common interests
and identity of faculty and stu
dents.

group include:
Chri.stain Bav, Howard S. linker, 'iurdon
