## Lacrosse Moving Westward; Jay Lehr Leads Arizona U. 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Lacrosse is a sport which was invented by the
North American Indians, is tlie national sport of
Canada, and has beon nurtured primarily on
America's east coast. In the Maryland area and
also among the Ivy League schools, lacrosse ranks
alongside of or ahead of baseball and track in
| number of participants and spectators. Former
I players and enthusiasts have been drifting west
jiward after their college days in significant num
bers.
Their zest for the game has not waned, and
j lacrosse clubs and teams have sprung up at vari
i ous locations west of the Rockies in recent years.
J The number is increasing all the time.
| Universities currently fielding teams besides
(Stanford are Cal, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Air
Force, and Claremont.
In Sout hern California, there is a strong seven
; team league which consists of the Camp Pendle
ton Marines, Claremont, the San Marino Lacrosse
Club, and several other clubs.
The university teams have various relation
ships with their schools' athletic departments. Both
the Air Force Academy and Colorado operate
strong intramural programs, but although they
I compete intercollegiately they do not as yet have
I varsity recognition.
Lacrosse, in existence for only three years at
Arizona, received varsity recognition last year to
become the first team in the western states lo
oporale at this level. Much of the credit for this
distinction belongs to Jay Lehr, the instigator of

lacrosse at Arizona and now a lacrosse assistant
at Ohio State.
The key to Lehr's success was exposure. At
least once a week during theseason, radio or tele
vision interviewed him or one of the players. One
of the games was televised live. Also, most of the
players wore light jackets around campus to show
their connection with the squad.
Lehr sold western lacrosse not only to the,
Tucson area, but also to the NCAA organization <
and ultimately to the Arizona athletic department, j
He conjured up the WCLA (Western Collegiate
Lacrosse Association) and personally selected an
all-star team (Arizona had played all its members
during the season). A sizable write-up appeared in
1 lie annual Lacrosse Guide.
The preceding information impressed the Ari
zona athletic department. Lehr continued to sell.
He stepped up the number of practice sessions
from three to five days a week. He told the de
partment how lacrosse has grown strong in every
area in which it has been introduced. He told them
about the other schools in the west that had
started programs.
Particularly, he emphasized that making la
crosse a varsity sport at Arizona would boost its
program considerably and besides would set a
percedent that teams representing other schools
could aim for. The request for recognition was
turned down two years ago. but gladfully accepted
last year, making Arizona the forerunner in west- j
ern collegiate lacrosse.
