## Power Struggle Obscures Issues 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
It would seem that an amount
of "power" is to be transferred
from administrative to student
faculty eschelons. In principle, 1
welcome this transition.
However, it is important to re
member that merely transferring
power does not automatically in
sure sensibility and wisdom in
the re-use of that power.
Power can be a labile, danger
ous and highly individualized com
modity on any campus, irregard
less of which person misuses it,
and I wish to make it perfectly
clear that no one person, or group,
has a monopoly in this form of
despotism.
Campus issues such as "in loco
parentis," infantilization of stu
dents, and freedom regarding per
sonal and property rights, are
paramount and demand elucida
tion and revision. A lucid state
ment of these issues ought to pre
eeed the transfer of power.
It seems to me that the on-going
"power struggle" has displaced
these issues, and may preclude
the possibility of changing them.
If these issues are not modified
before power transfer is facili
tated, then I fail to see how the
inherent rights and freedom of
students will become any less con
fused than the confusion which
now prevail.
I suggest that a "Bill of Rights"
be adopted and established to re
place a notoriously antiquated
"Fundamental Standard." Within
such a "Bill," placement and bal
ance of power ought to exist.

Editor, The Daily:
To those political innocents who
still cling to the debauched logic
that U.S. involvement in Vietnam
is a commitment to democracy
and freedom in that unfortunate
country, I submit the following
material gleaned from The. Sun
day Times Magazine. (London),
January 10, 1963, concerning Gen
eral Nguyen Cao Cy. Information
on the current junta holding pow
er in Saigon has been scarce, al
though TIME, the weekly news
magazine, has given us a portrait
of the commander of the South
Vietnamese Air Force as a mus

tachioed gallant who wears gaudy
scarves and packs pearl-handled
pistols. General Cy, General Chi
and General Minh (le petit) com
pose the triumvirate that deposed
General Khan who deposed Gen
eral Minh (le grand) who deposed
President Diem. According to The
Sunday Times Magjizine, General
Cao Cy has asserted that "his only
hero is Hitler." He is further
quoted as saying "We need lour
or live Hitlers in Vietnam." In
the same pictorial essay there is
a photograph of a detachment of
Cambodian mercenaries, p u r
chased with American money,
who, like Cao Cy, are operating
in Vietnam for democratic prin
ciples and in the best interests of
the Vietnamese people.
None of this, I realize, is espe
cially illuminating. That General
Cao Cy has fori brightly stated his
fascist predilections perhaps only
confirms the suspicions of many,
but what is particularly offensive
is that his politics, quietly sub
sumed in the term of convenience,
can mean so little while those of
Ho Chi Minh are so crucial. Our
unholy marriages with Franco
and a host of star-studded Latin
American caudillos have perhaps
dulled our appetites for clear dis
tinctions. These dishonorable alli
ances, the use of these repugnant
means and figures, all deployed
in our supposed defense of th e
Free World, represent, I am told
a 'tragic dilemma' in American
foreign policy. This as though
we had Creons in the Pentagon
and Defense Department whose
hearts arc wrung by the 'neces
sity' of General Cao Cy. The trag
edy of that dilemma is not in
Washington. It is in Vietnam, the
lot of the Vietnamese people
whose national existence is now
consecrated by General Cao Cy.
It. is in Spain, in Recife, Lisbon,
Guatemala and Seoul, wherever
we sustain puppet regimes with
the full panoply of our ideals. Men
like Nguyen Cao Cy are, of course,
staunch anti-communists, but then
so was his hero.
The situation is such in Viet
nam now that discussion is barely
possible. Moral and ideological
justifications for our policy there
are on the distinguished level of
the speeches one hears at Ameri
can Legion conventions. Argu

ments frankly grounded in real
politik must confront the fact that
the war, as it: is now fought, is
a dead loss, that the military alter
natives all lead directly into night
mart. Exhausted, one merely
trades atrocities and the telling
of the most recent crimes con
cludes the conversation. Moral
indignation gives way to simple,
total disgust.

Editor, The Daily:
The picture of the new Mc-
Cullough Engineering Building
on the front page last Friday
serves as a somewhat grim re
minder of the complete lack of
architectural imagination char
acterizing much of the new con
struction on campus. At a time
when universities throughout the
country are demonstrating con
siderable esthetic vitality, S t a n
ford seems mired in the illusion
that brown concrete is about as
great a departure from the origi
nal sandstone as would be safe,
or desirable, to contemplate. The
result is a series of buildings de
void of inspiration, resembling
the prefabricated monstrosities
current in Moscow and, alas, de
tracting from the genuine beauty
of the original architecture. It is
ironical that this university, which
is so avant-garde in its academic
work, should be so reactionary in
its appearance.

Editor, The Daily:
In order to protect the basic
academic purpose of Stanford
University as a privately endowed
educational institution, and to as
sure the ten thousand students
selected to study here of some
sense of control of these pur
poses, would it not be proper for
the Board of Trustees and the
Student Legislature to jointly
establish and interpret a Funda
mental Standard of Goals and
Ideals for all administrative em
ployees of the University?
All persons delegated adminis
trative responsibility could be re
quired to sign this Fundamental
Standard as a requisite for em

ploymcnt. Willi th is constant
check on bureaucratic procedures,
the Board of Trustees through
and with the Students could be
assured that the aims of our Uni
versity would at all times be pur
sued in the manner that the mom-
I bers of the University community
i desired.

Editor, Tiw Daily:
I wish to reply to the ungentle
manly complaint voiced by the
Roble Hashers in Monday's paper.
First, these hashers ought to
realize that "the customer is al
ways light," and that they have
no reason or right to complain
about what their charges wear to
meals.
Second, if they do not like their
working conditions, then they
ought to remember that no one
forced them to work in a girls'
dormitory: they should either quit
or transfer to one of the men's
dormitories, where 1 have yet to
sec anyone come to a meal with
his hair up in curlers.
And if this is not sufficient,
I then, as my own experience leads
i me to believe, are not "the many
(coeds who somehow confine their
| curlers to their private cubby
| holes" more than enough to make
| up for the ones who do not.

er in Saigon has been scarce, al
though TIME, the weekly news
magazine, has given us a portrait
of the commander of the South
Vietnamese Air Force as a mus

tachioed gallant who wears gaudy
scarves and packs pearl-handled
pistols. General Cy, General Chi
and General Minh (le petit) com
pose the triumvirate that deposed
General Khan who deposed Gen
eral Minh (le grand) who deposed
President Diem. According to The
Sunday Times Magjizine, General
Cao Cy has asserted that "his only
hero is Hitler." He is further
quoted as saying "We need lour
or live Hitlers in Vietnam." In
the same pictorial essay there is
a photograph of a detachment of
Cambodian mercenaries, p u r
chased with American money,
who, like Cao Cy, are operating
in Vietnam for democratic prin
ciples and in the best interests of
the Vietnamese people.
None of this, I realize, is espe
cially illuminating. That General
Cao Cy has fori brightly stated his
fascist predilections perhaps only
confirms the suspicions of many,
but what is particularly offensive
is that his politics, quietly sub
sumed in the term of convenience,
can mean so little while those of
Ho Chi Minh are so crucial. Our
unholy marriages with Franco
and a host of star-studded Latin
American caudillos have perhaps
dulled our appetites for clear dis
tinctions. These dishonorable alli
ances, the use of these repugnant
means and figures, all deployed
in our supposed defense of th e
Free World, represent, I am told
a 'tragic dilemma' in American
foreign policy. This as though
we had Creons in the Pentagon
and Defense Department whose
hearts arc wrung by the 'neces
sity' of General Cao Cy. The trag
edy of that dilemma is not in
Washington. It is in Vietnam, the
lot of the Vietnamese people
whose national existence is now
consecrated by General Cao Cy.
It. is in Spain, in Recife, Lisbon,
Guatemala and Seoul, wherever
we sustain puppet regimes with
the full panoply of our ideals. Men
like Nguyen Cao Cy are, of course,
staunch anti-communists, but then
so was his hero.
The situation is such in Viet
nam now that discussion is barely
possible. Moral and ideological
justifications for our policy there
are on the distinguished level of
the speeches one hears at Ameri
can Legion conventions. Argu

ments frankly grounded in real
politik must confront the fact that
the war, as it: is now fought, is
a dead loss, that the military alter
natives all lead directly into night
mart. Exhausted, one merely
trades atrocities and the telling
of the most recent crimes con
cludes the conversation. Moral
indignation gives way to simple,
total disgust.

The picture of the new Mc-
Cullough Engineering Building
on the front page last Friday
serves as a somewhat grim re
minder of the complete lack of
architectural imagination char
acterizing much of the new con
struction on campus. At a time
when universities throughout the
country are demonstrating con
siderable esthetic vitality, S t a n
ford seems mired in the illusion
that brown concrete is about as
great a departure from the origi
nal sandstone as would be safe,
or desirable, to contemplate. The
result is a series of buildings de
void of inspiration, resembling
the prefabricated monstrosities
current in Moscow and, alas, de
tracting from the genuine beauty
of the original architecture. It is
ironical that this university, which
is so avant-garde in its academic
work, should be so reactionary in
its appearance.

I wish to reply to the ungentle
manly complaint voiced by the
Roble Hashers in Monday's paper.
First, these hashers ought to
realize that "the customer is al
ways light," and that they have
no reason or right to complain
about what their charges wear to
meals.
Second, if they do not like their
working conditions, then they
ought to remember that no one
forced them to work in a girls'
dormitory: they should either quit
or transfer to one of the men's
dormitories, where 1 have yet to
sec anyone come to a meal with
his hair up in curlers.
And if this is not sufficient,
I then, as my own experience leads
i me to believe, are not "the many
(coeds who somehow confine their
| curlers to their private cubby
| holes" more than enough to make
| up for the ones who do not.

It would seem that an amount
of "power" is to be transferred
from administrative to student
faculty eschelons. In principle, 1
welcome this transition.
However, it is important to re
member that merely transferring
power does not automatically in
sure sensibility and wisdom in
the re-use of that power.
Power can be a labile, danger
ous and highly individualized com
modity on any campus, irregard
less of which person misuses it,
and I wish to make it perfectly
clear that no one person, or group,
has a monopoly in this form of
despotism.
Campus issues such as "in loco
parentis," infantilization of stu
dents, and freedom regarding per
sonal and property rights, are
paramount and demand elucida
tion and revision. A lucid state
ment of these issues ought to pre
eeed the transfer of power.
It seems to me that the on-going
"power struggle" has displaced
these issues, and may preclude
the possibility of changing them.
If these issues are not modified
before power transfer is facili
tated, then I fail to see how the
inherent rights and freedom of
students will become any less con
fused than the confusion which
now prevail.
I suggest that a "Bill of Rights"
be adopted and established to re
place a notoriously antiquated
"Fundamental Standard." Within
such a "Bill," placement and bal

It. is in Spain, in Recife, Lisbon,
Guatemala and Seoul, wherever
we sustain puppet regimes with
the full panoply of our ideals. Men
like Nguyen Cao Cy are, of course,
staunch anti-communists, but then

The picture of the new Mc-
Cullough Engineering Building
on the front page last Friday
serves as a somewhat grim re
minder of the complete lack of
architectural imagination char
acterizing much of the new con
struction on campus. At a time
when universities throughout the
country are demonstrating con
siderable esthetic vitality, S t a n
ford seems mired in the illusion
that brown concrete is about as
great a departure from the origi
nal sandstone as would be safe,
or desirable, to contemplate. The
result is a series of buildings de
void of inspiration, resembling
the prefabricated monstrosities
current in Moscow and, alas, de
tracting from the genuine beauty
of the original architecture. It is
ironical that this university, which
is so avant-garde in its academic
work, should be so reactionary in
its appearance.

In order to protect the basic
academic purpose of Stanford
University as a privately endowed
educational institution, and to as
sure the ten thousand students
selected to study here of some
sense of control of these pur
poses, would it not be proper for
the Board of Trustees and the
Student Legislature to jointly
establish and interpret a Funda
mental Standard of Goals and

ployees of the University?
All persons delegated adminis
trative responsibility could be re

I wish to reply to the ungentle
manly complaint voiced by the
Roble Hashers in Monday's paper.
First, these hashers ought to
realize that "the customer is al
ways light," and that they have
no reason or right to complain
about what their charges wear to
meals.
Second, if they do not like their
working conditions, then they
ought to remember that no one
forced them to work in a girls'
dormitory: they should either quit
or transfer to one of the men's
dormitories, where 1 have yet to
sec anyone come to a meal with
his hair up in curlers.
And if this is not sufficient,
I then, as my own experience leads
i me to believe, are not "the many
(coeds who somehow confine their
| curlers to their private cubby
| holes" more than enough to make
| up for the ones who do not.

It would seem that an amount
of "power" is to be transferred
from administrative to student
faculty eschelons. In principle, 1
welcome this transition.
However, it is important to re
member that merely transferring
power does not automatically in
sure sensibility and wisdom in
the re-use of that power.
Power can be a labile, danger
ous and highly individualized com
modity on any campus, irregard
less of which person misuses it,
and I wish to make it perfectly
clear that no one person, or group,
has a monopoly in this form of
despotism.
Campus issues such as "in loco
parentis," infantilization of stu
dents, and freedom regarding per
sonal and property rights, are
paramount and demand elucida
tion and revision. A lucid state
ment of these issues ought to pre
eeed the transfer of power.
It seems to me that the on-going
"power struggle" has displaced
these issues, and may preclude
the possibility of changing them.
If these issues are not modified
before power transfer is facili
tated, then I fail to see how the
inherent rights and freedom of
students will become any less con
fused than the confusion which
now prevail.
I suggest that a "Bill of Rights"
be adopted and established to re
place a notoriously antiquated
"Fundamental Standard." Within
such a "Bill," placement and bal
ance of power ought to exist.

• Saigon Profile
Editor, The Daily:
To those political innocents who
still cling to the debauched logic
that U.S. involvement in Vietnam
is a commitment to democracy
and freedom in that unfortunate
country, I submit the following
material gleaned from The. Sun
day Times Magazine. (London),
January 10, 1963, concerning Gen
eral Nguyen Cao Cy. Information
on the current junta holding pow
er in Saigon has been scarce, al
though TIME, the weekly news
magazine, has given us a portrait
of the commander of the South
Vietnamese Air Force as a mus

tachioed gallant who wears gaudy
scarves and packs pearl-handled
pistols. General Cy, General Chi
and General Minh (le petit) com
pose the triumvirate that deposed
General Khan who deposed Gen
eral Minh (le grand) who deposed
President Diem. According to The
Sunday Times Magjizine, General
Cao Cy has asserted that "his only
hero is Hitler." He is further
quoted as saying "We need lour
or live Hitlers in Vietnam." In
the same pictorial essay there is
a photograph of a detachment of
Cambodian mercenaries, p u r
chased with American money,
who, like Cao Cy, are operating
in Vietnam for democratic prin
ciples and in the best interests of
the Vietnamese people.
None of this, I realize, is espe
cially illuminating. That General
Cao Cy has fori brightly stated his
fascist predilections perhaps only
confirms the suspicions of many,
but what is particularly offensive
is that his politics, quietly sub
sumed in the term of convenience,
can mean so little while those of
Ho Chi Minh are so crucial. Our
unholy marriages with Franco
and a host of star-studded Latin
American caudillos have perhaps
dulled our appetites for clear dis
tinctions. These dishonorable alli
ances, the use of these repugnant
means and figures, all deployed
in our supposed defense of th e
Free World, represent, I am told
a 'tragic dilemma' in American
foreign policy. This as though
we had Creons in the Pentagon
and Defense Department whose
hearts arc wrung by the 'neces
sity' of General Cao Cy. The trag
edy of that dilemma is not in
Washington. It is in Vietnam, the
lot of the Vietnamese people
whose national existence is now
consecrated by General Cao Cy.

Editor, Tiw Daily:
I wish to reply to the ungentle
manly complaint voiced by the
Roble Hashers in Monday's paper.
First, these hashers ought to
realize that "the customer is al
ways light," and that they have
no reason or right to complain
about what their charges wear to
meals.
Second, if they do not like their
working conditions, then they
ought to remember that no one
forced them to work in a girls'
dormitory: they should either quit
or transfer to one of the men's
dormitories, where 1 have yet to
sec anyone come to a meal with
his hair up in curlers.
And if this is not sufficient,
I then, as my own experience leads
i me to believe, are not "the many
(coeds who somehow confine their
| curlers to their private cubby
| holes" more than enough to make
| up for the ones who do not.

Editor, The Daily:
It would seem that an amount
of "power" is to be transferred
from administrative to student
faculty eschelons. In principle, 1
welcome this transition.
However, it is important to re
member that merely transferring
power does not automatically in
sure sensibility and wisdom in
the re-use of that power.
Power can be a labile, danger
ous and highly individualized com
modity on any campus, irregard
less of which person misuses it,
and I wish to make it perfectly
clear that no one person, or group,
has a monopoly in this form of
despotism.
Campus issues such as "in loco
parentis," infantilization of stu
dents, and freedom regarding per
sonal and property rights, are
paramount and demand elucida
tion and revision. A lucid state
ment of these issues ought to pre
eeed the transfer of power.
It seems to me that the on-going
"power struggle" has displaced
these issues, and may preclude
the possibility of changing them.
If these issues are not modified
before power transfer is facili
tated, then I fail to see how the
inherent rights and freedom of
students will become any less con
fused than the confusion which
now prevail.
I suggest that a "Bill of Rights"
be adopted and established to re
place a notoriously antiquated
"Fundamental Standard." Within
such a "Bill," placement and bal
ance of power ought to exist.

• Saigon Profile
Editor, The Daily:
To those political innocents who
still cling to the debauched logic
that U.S. involvement in Vietnam
is a commitment to democracy
and freedom in that unfortunate
country, I submit the following
material gleaned from The. Sun
day Times Magazine. (London),
January 10, 1963, concerning Gen
eral Nguyen Cao Cy. Information
on the current junta holding pow
er in Saigon has been scarce, al
though TIME, the weekly news
magazine, has given us a portrait
of the commander of the South
Vietnamese Air Force as a mus

tachioed gallant who wears gaudy
scarves and packs pearl-handled
pistols. General Cy, General Chi
and General Minh (le petit) com
pose the triumvirate that deposed
General Khan who deposed Gen
eral Minh (le grand) who deposed
President Diem. According to The
Sunday Times Magjizine, General
Cao Cy has asserted that "his only
hero is Hitler." He is further
quoted as saying "We need lour
or live Hitlers in Vietnam." In
the same pictorial essay there is
a photograph of a detachment of
Cambodian mercenaries, p u r
chased with American money,
who, like Cao Cy, are operating
in Vietnam for democratic prin
ciples and in the best interests of
the Vietnamese people.
None of this, I realize, is espe
cially illuminating. That General
Cao Cy has fori brightly stated his
fascist predilections perhaps only
confirms the suspicions of many,
but what is particularly offensive
is that his politics, quietly sub
sumed in the term of convenience,
can mean so little while those of
Ho Chi Minh are so crucial. Our
unholy marriages with Franco
and a host of star-studded Latin
American caudillos have perhaps
dulled our appetites for clear dis
tinctions. These dishonorable alli
ances, the use of these repugnant
means and figures, all deployed
in our supposed defense of th e
Free World, represent, I am told
a 'tragic dilemma' in American
foreign policy. This as though
we had Creons in the Pentagon
and Defense Department whose
hearts arc wrung by the 'neces
sity' of General Cao Cy. The trag
edy of that dilemma is not in
Washington. It is in Vietnam, the
lot of the Vietnamese people
whose national existence is now
consecrated by General Cao Cy.
It. is in Spain, in Recife, Lisbon,
Guatemala and Seoul, wherever
we sustain puppet regimes with
the full panoply of our ideals. Men
like Nguyen Cao Cy are, of course,
staunch anti-communists, but then
so was his hero.
The situation is such in Viet
nam now that discussion is barely
possible. Moral and ideological
justifications for our policy there
are on the distinguished level of
the speeches one hears at Ameri
can Legion conventions. Argu

ments frankly grounded in real
politik must confront the fact that
the war, as it: is now fought, is
a dead loss, that the military alter
natives all lead directly into night
mart. Exhausted, one merely
trades atrocities and the telling
of the most recent crimes con
cludes the conversation. Moral
indignation gives way to simple,
total disgust.

• Reactionary Style
Editor, The Daily:
The picture of the new Mc-
Cullough Engineering Building
on the front page last Friday
serves as a somewhat grim re
minder of the complete lack of
architectural imagination char
acterizing much of the new con
struction on campus. At a time
when universities throughout the
country are demonstrating con
siderable esthetic vitality, S t a n
ford seems mired in the illusion
that brown concrete is about as
great a departure from the origi
nal sandstone as would be safe,
or desirable, to contemplate. The
result is a series of buildings de
void of inspiration, resembling
the prefabricated monstrosities
current in Moscow and, alas, de
tracting from the genuine beauty
of the original architecture. It is
ironical that this university, which
is so avant-garde in its academic
work, should be so reactionary in
its appearance.
