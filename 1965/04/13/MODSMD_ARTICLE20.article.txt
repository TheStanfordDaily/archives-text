## Skeletons in the Row Closet-A Private Affair? 
### Justin Beck 
Bill McGce and liis twenty-three automatons trooped into
LASSU Thursday night, in a scene reminiscent of the smashing
of tht' ASSU Rush Committee last year. Only this time they were
determined to stop an ASSU investigation of initiation practices,
another skeleton in the How's already overcrowded closet.

Like the South, Stanford's fra
ternities are fighting for a way
of life, and like any Klu Klux
Klaner, they dislike outsiders
messing around with their pecu
liar institution.
But before McGee and his min
ions could crusade for fraternal
fair play from the Legislature,
they had to sit through the debate
on tlie Committee of Five recom
mendations, a feat of courage no
Greek since Thermopylae h a s
ever quite matched.
It was quite sad that they had
to undergo all that since what
quite obviously they felt the im
portant thing, and indeed the only
tiling that brought them there,
was this grave threat to their way
of life, an outside investigation.
What the rest of the students did
with the judicial system was their
problem, not the Row's.
A Big Surprise
But they stuck it out a n d
launched the most carefully laid
battle plan since Von Schliffen.
And like Von Schliffen's it began
with a big surprise.
After introducing the resolu
tion establishing an ASSU com
mittee to investigate the Row's
initiation practices, the 1 sponsor,
yielded by prenrrangement to a
representative from the Row, Bill
Keylor, to introduce a compro
mise amendment.
Only the clean-cut Mr. Keylor
failed to introduce the full com
promise amendment, reneging on
a clause which would have re
quired the IFC. after conducting

its own investigation, to report to
the Legislature. After all, when
you are fighting for a way of life,
a broken agreement or two doesn't
matter much.
McGee's Menagerie
And when Steve Hodge at
tempted to put the reporting
clause back in. McGee and hi s
menagerie rose to fight back,
pleading that it would destroy
the IFC, that the Legislature
couldn't understand fraternity
problems, and that it would make
the investigation a whole lot eas
ier if the Legislature couldn't find
out the results.
That last point was probably
the most valid one in the whole
bunch. An official report, expos
ing and publicly condemning a
number of fraternity practices be
fore they get their rushees sewed
up, could be disastrous for the
Row—and judging from their de
fense of secrecy in the Legisla
ture, they have got a lot to hide
from the freshmen and the Uni
versity community. However they
forgot one thing — the fact that
one has a lot to hide is scarcely
a valid argument for keeping the
subsequent investigation secret.
Dirty Hush as Usual
One fact the Legislature might
keep in mind is that the IFC is
totally unable to police itself. Last
year they demanded the right to
set their own rush policy, and yet
even with their own policy it was
dirty rush as usual all year.
One fraternity man, now inac
tive, commented privately that he
attended a party last fall at which
"live or six" freshmen were pres
ent, in direct violation of IFC
rules. "It wasn't unusual," he
added "because every house does
it." But Bill McGee asked the Leg
islature with a straight face tha.
the IFC be permitted to clean its
own house without outside help.
Fortunately the Legislature,
tired after four hours of debate,
decided to postpone the entire
issue, putting the entire matter
on the agenda as the first order
of business this week. Hopefully
the IFC in the mean time, might
consider its position of blind op
position to outside aid.
Scott Mcßride's own attempted
compromise, after the reporting
clause had been accepted by the
Legislature over the objections of
McGee and his men, was a bit
baffling. One representative com
mented after the meeting. "If I
knew what went through Scott's
mind when he introduced that, I
might be able to figure out what
has been going on in the Presi
dent's office all year."
Decisions for IFC
The IFC might think about
three things before deciding to
pursue their own secret investi
gation. First, would they be hurt
more by making their own secret
investigation of a problem the
whole campus knows exists, or by
welcoming an outside, impartial
investigation of which a public
report would be made? Second,
are they actually capable of polic
ing any rules that they make?
Third, is it wiser to seek coopera
tion with student, government
than to simply fight any move the
ASSU makes toward correcting
fraternity problems.
Probably the Row has been on
the defensive for too long a time
to do any more than to crawl into
its shell when the outside world
looks critically in its direction.
Bui the Row might remember
one thing, a shell does little good
if the occupant has cancer.
