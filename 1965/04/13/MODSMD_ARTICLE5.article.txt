# Judicial Proposal Released
## Report Calls for Board of Appeals 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
The Committee on Judicial)
Procedure yesterday released a j
! set of tentative recommendations
for revisions in the student judi-1
ciary that are substantially in
j agreement with proposals made
i earlier by LASSU's Committee on
j Judicial Reform.
The tripartite student-faculty
administration body, which has
| been meeting since November and
is under the chairmanship of Dean
j of Undergraduate Education Rob
| ert J. Wert, recommended:
•The creation of a final Board ;
of Appeals, to be composed of
three faculty members and three j
students, and to be chairmaned j
by a member of the School of
law;
• Enactment of a 14-point. bill
lof rights for students against!
|whom charges involving student;
affairs and conduct have been j
lodged;
• Reorganization of the judicial
councils of the overseas cam- j
puses, including clarification of
the right of appeal;
• Standardization of record
| keeping of the various judicial
bodies.
Constitutional Amendment
According to Wert, his commit
tee will meet April 16 with t li e;
Legislature's permanent Commit-1
| tee on the Judiciary, formed at
! the end of Winter Quarter. The'
combined committees would make
a recommendation to LASSU in i
the form of an ASSU Constitu-j
tional amendment which, if
passed, would probably be voted
upon by the student body in the
; spring General Election.
Speaker of LASSU Ed Shaw
said last night that lie saw "no
major differences" between the
! recommendations of Wert's group
j and those of the LASSU commit
tee. but said that there were cer- ;
tain areas of the two proposals
that "may require further discus
-1 sions."
Wert said that he was "opti
mistic that an agreement can be !
! reached."
Under the proposals of Wert's
committee, the Board of Appeals, |
upon the request of either an ac- :
icused student or "a University!
; representative," will have the
power to review ;i ny decision of
the student-composed j u d i c i a 1
councils.
ItcennimemkMl Mights
Among the recommended rights I
for a defendant are that he "be
informed in writing of the
| charges against him. of the al
leged act upon which the charge
is based, and of the constitutional j
! provision, standard, code, rule,
regulation, by-law, or policy which j
j it is alleged to infringe."
An accused student would also
i have the right to request the!
Dean of Students to decide his!
i ease rather than have it referred ;
to a judicial council.
