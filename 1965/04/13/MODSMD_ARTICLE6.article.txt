# HODDING CARTER:
## Change Comes to Mississippi 
### FRANK SILVER 
Hodding Carter will speak on
"The Tale of Two Cities" in the
civil rights movement at T:45 to
night in Memorial Auditorium.
His speech will open the new
Carlos McClatchv Memorial Lec
ture series.'
Speaking at a press conference
yesterday, the Pulitzer Prize-win
ning editor and publisher of the
G r e en vi 11 e, Mississippi Delta
Democrat-Times revealed that his
speech would compare ihe atti
tudes and traditions concerning
race relations in Greenville and
McComb, Mississippi.
McComb is widely noted for the
numerous burnings and bomb
ings which took place there last
summer. Greenville is less widely

. known for its moderate position
on race issues. "A strong tradi
tion ot community leadership by
men of good will" accounts for
much of the difference between
the two towns, according to Car
ter.
The South Will Adjust
Commenting on some broader
| issues at the press conference,
i Carter said that the South will
inevitably adjust its racial poli
-1 cies. Thirteen states couldn't force
i acceptance of their views a hun
, died years ago, he said, and"I
j don't think Mississippi can lick
the nation today."
Economic pressure will be vital
in bringing about change, accord
ing to Carter. For instance, the
'awarding of federal contracts 1o

companies which have compiled
I with equal employment regula
i lions will carry wide influence.
Carter also noted that competi
i tion to attract industry will cause
| changes on the municipal level.
An example of this occurred re
cently when sixteen school boards
voluntarily voted to offer school
desegregation plans to the civil
rights commission after Green
ville had taken the lead. The rea
! son for this, Carter said, was that
these cities could not afford to be
left behind in the competition for
j new industry.
' Mississippi will have to solve
basic problems before it will make
much progress. "Our problem is
!to find jobs, especially for Ne
! groes," Carter said, "and to train
| Negroes for the jobs."
