# FAIR HIRING DISPUTE
## CORE Pickets Stickney's 
### 
The issue of equal opportunity employ
ment became visible three weekends ago at
tlu 1 Town and Country Stickney's restau
rant when a picket line sponsored by the
Mid-Peninsula Congress of Racial Equality
(MPCORE) appeared on the sidewalk be
tween El Camino Real and Stickney's.
"Our approach is not to tell them what
to do, but to ask them what they can do,"
said Mrs. Connie Biel, the secretary of
MPCORE's employment committee.
"The way I feel about it, my shirt-tails
are clean," said Adrian Stickney, president
of the Stickney's restaurant and bakery
chain.
Stickney's employs over 309 people, a
labor force which now Includes eight or
nine Negroes. According to Stickney, "It's
true: I had no Negroes working for me a
year ago."
Ten Month's Negotiations
Negotiations between Stickney's and
MPCORE have been going on for the last
ten months Talks gave way to demonstra
tions after an exchange ol letters lietween
Mr. Jacque Lefover of Stickney's and Mr.
Henry Organ of MPCORE.
In a letter dated February 21 Organ
stated that "MPCORE and many other Civil
Rights organizations have been of great
assistance to firms who wish to make affir
mative moves toward increasing and esca
lating Negro employment, and there is

much information that we can and do share
with them in pursuit of this goal."
Lefevcr, in his reply to MPCORE, con
cluded by asserting, "it is our most sincere
wish 1o be left alone in our search and pur
suit of goals dictated by our own conscience,
not anyone else's."
Goals of the Picket
MPCORE states on a mimeographed
sheet given to those who approach the
picket line that it will continue to protest
"until a positive recruitment program is
undertaken by Stickney's or the number
of Negroes working at Stickney's in
creases." They contend that Stickney's pres
cut hiring practices constitute "tokenism."
The two parties met on April 3 and
Stickney's agreed to establish contact with
Ihe minorilN specialist of the California De
partment of Employment and the emplo>
menl supervisor of the Bayshore Employ
ment Service. Stickney's refused, however,
to place its ads in minority news media,
trguing that it placed ads in the Palo Alto
rimes and three other Bay Area newspap
ers. It argued further that there was no
reason for MPCORE to single out Stickney's
when other restaurants on the El Camino
strip had no Negro employees at all. Stick
ney's asked MPCORE to take its proposals
to the Peninsula Restaurant Association, ot
which Stickney's is. however, not a mem
ber.

Double Confusion
There is confusion in both the employ
ment and negotiation pictures. Stickney's
and MPCORE agree that there is not a ple
thora of Negroes registered at the employ
ment services and that many of those who
are registered will need additional training
in order to qualify as waitresses, bus-boys,
fry cooks, or cashiers. But as of now, a
training workshop does not exist.
The negotiation picture is blurred by
the fact that a Human Relations Commit
tee. established by the Mayor of Palo Alto
in July 1963, was dissolved after it turned
oxer its fact-finding report to the Palo Alto
City Council in December 1964. The problem
of delegation of authority enters the picture
with the advent of the California Fair Em
ployment Practices Commission, The FEPC
gave no authority to the Palo Alio Human
Relations sub-committee on employment to
mediate disputes between civil rights groups
and business firms.
An Authority Vacuum
An effort to resolve the authority va
cuum. created by FEPC's sole jurisdiction
over mediation, was taken by Stickney on
Monday when he asked for FEPC interven
tion. Stickney stated that "It is our objective
to assure that our firm continues to com
ply with the Fair Employment Practices
Act by initiating whatever action is reason
ably called for."
