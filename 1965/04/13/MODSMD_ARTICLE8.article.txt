# National Suspends Sigma Chi
## Negro Pledge To Remain; Chapter To Appeal Ruling 
### JIM HAUSER 
The National Executive Committee of Sigma Clu traternit)
has "temporarily suspended" its Stanford chapter for failure to be
"interested in carrying on the ritual, standards, and traditions oi
the fraternity."
Harry V. Wade, Grand Consul of the fraternity, informed the

Stanford chapter Sunday of the*
Executive Board's decision.
The suspension came after the
Stanford chapter informed the na-1
tional organization that it planned ,
to pledge a Negro.
Gary Kerns, president of t he j
Stanford chapter, said, "We have
pledged a Negro. A house meeting i
tonight will determine)
how we will react to the suspen-'
sion."
Chapters on temporary suspen- i
sion can appeal to the national or-1
ganization at the National Conven-1
tion June IT.
Negotiate witli National
Kerns said, "We will not give \
up the pledge to stay in the na-1
tional but we intend to try to eon-1
vince the national organization !
that we should stay affiliated."
Pat Forster, a member of the j
Stanford chapter, said, "There is ■
still plenty of fur to fly." The fra-1
ternity will send a delegation to !
the national convention in Den
ver, Colo, this June IT to plead
the cause of the local chapter.
Until the suspension, the Stan-|
ford chapter was the only Sigma ■
Chi chapter in the country with j
a Negro member.
If the one-year suspension be-!
comes permanent, Sigma Chi will
be the third Stanford fraternity
to separate from its national j
organization since 195 T. In 1960.
Alpha Tail Omega, became Alpha ;
Tail Omicron and in 1962, Sigma ;
Nu became Beta Chi.
Is 10 very body llappy?
Although the national organiza-;
tion has no discriminatory clause.!
its constitution does contain the I
stipulation that no chapter pro
pose for membership anyone "who
for any reason is likely to be con
sidered personally unacceptable

as a brother by any chapter or any
member anywhere." Sigma Chi,
Kerns said, has a great deal of its
I strength in the South.
Frank Olrich, past president of
I the Stanford chapter, said Feb
, ruary 4in a letter to the national
i organization, "Not only arc we
; losing many outstanding Negro
| athletes »nd scholars, but many
j well-qualified Caucasian students
! are avoiding our house because of
their overt dista-.te for our dis
criminatory policy."
The Executive Board answered
[the chapter February 8 saying.
"The fraternity has nothing in its
j public constitution, statutes, or in
(secret ritual, that keeps anyone
i out of our fraternity because of
! his race, creed or national back-
I ground."
Adhering to the Executive
(Board's letter, the Stanford chap
iter rushed without discrimination
| this spring.
Alumni Support Chapter
Kerns said that the chapter had
| sent out letters to 6<M) alumni ask
| ing their opinion on the chapter's
rush policy. Of 130 responding, 123
I supported the chapter.
"I would venture to say that
j it's nearly unanimous in the house
| that we try to stay in the na
i tional,'' Kerns said.
The Stanford Board of Trus
tees in 1937 adopted the policy
j that "the university is opposed to
1 discriminatory racial and religi
; ous clauses and practices. Insofar
as such clauses or practices exist,
the University will work actively
with student groups to eliminate
them at the earliest possible date."
