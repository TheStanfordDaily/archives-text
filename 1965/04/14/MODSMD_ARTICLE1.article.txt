# Introduction to Contemporary Activism

### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor (Last in a Series 
When students returned to the campus
after last Christmas vacation they discovered
that a new time designation was being used.
It was 1965 A.B. Alter Berkeley.
The controversy over the Free Speech
Movement had sputtered and flamed inter
mittently all oi Fall Quarter, but when during
Dead Week the Academic Council at Berkeley
finally gave their overwhelming support to the
dissidents and a confrontation with the Board
of Regents seemed imminent, a group of
graduate students decided to garner what sup
port they could for the FSM and the Academic
Council here at Stanford.
Ilmar Waldner, a graduate student in phil
osophy, is generally considered the prime
originator of the resultant Graduate Coordi
nating Committee (GCC) and was chosen as
chairman at the first meeting. This meeting,
attended by approximately 40 students, was

called to deal solely with the Berkeley crisis.
Over 1200 Signatures
As a result, petitions with over 1200 signa
tures were sent to the Regents, Tom Sherman,
publicity chairman of the GCC, told The Daily.
However, the people present at the meeting
were not only concerned with matters at Cal,
but with the "larger problems that the Ber
keley controversy implied," as the first GCC
Newsletter later explained.
Thus viewing themselves as "participants
in ihis general and radical student revolt,"
these graduates turned their attention to the
problems they thought were present in this
university community.
C 'onimittees Established
Committees were thus set up by those mem
bers interested in investigating certain aspects
iif University life and regulations. Undoubt
edly, the most significant: of these was a com
mitter led by Jay Kadane which considered
how i! would be possible to fill the 52 empty
graduate seats in the Legislature.

This committee originally decided to fill
each of these positions by presenting petitions
to the Legislature; however, it was decided
that a special election should be held instead.
As a result, the Legislature lost its under
graduate orientation and most of its "modera
tion."
Not all these new representatives were
members of the GCC; only 15 had paid their
membership dues. Thus, it would take more
than an activist political group with only 100
dues-paying members to provoke a meaningful
re-evaluation of University policies.
Two More Catalysts
The two other necessary catalysts appeared
on the scene in early February. Senior Nancy
Steffen, perhaps the compleat activist, became
editor of The Daily; and the Crow-Halverson
Report was completed and readied for publica
tion.
Miss Steffen's first editorial declared that
the "slender but precious achievements of the
past few years at Stanford have always been

initiated by an explosion which, in one mighty
blast, cleared away the dead wood." The Crow-
Halverson was nothing if not an "explosion."
The very day the report was published, the
Legislature passed a resolution sponsored by
Jay Kadane which proclaimed that tlie "ASSU
shall have sole jurisdiction over student affairs
and conduct."
In succeeding months, the Legislature has
sought to implement this declaration in sev
eral fields — social regulations and judicial
reform being the two most prominent ex
amples. Moreover, attempts have been made
to induce overt faculty support in these en
deavors, or at least solicit faculty comment.
'An Ideal System'
"In an ideal system, the Administration
exists solely to serve the students and fac
ulty," Miss Steffen editorialized February 8.
"But it is only through the continued asser
tion of faculty concern that this ideal can be
transformed into reality."
To that extent, such organizations as

SAUS (Stanford Association of University*
Scholars) — a group of "practicing scholars"
whose originators were GCC member Bob
Rosen and faculty members Christian Bay and
John Seeley - represent an attempt to encour
age the faculty to enter the continuing dia
logue.
In many respects, it has been a long way
from Armin Rosencranz and GRIP to thi*
renovated Legislature, the GCC and SAUS.
But the goal was established long ago, by for
mer ASSU President Bud Wedin in his last
speech to the student body:
"Perhaps it is time to review some of the
institutions of our society at Stanford, to sec
if we are really doing our utmost to produce
students with intellectual maturity, the sell
assurance, and the sense of dignity and inde
pendence so needed in today's society. This
requires a new viewpoint toward the student
in the University community it requires that
he be given a new respect and dignity. If this
can be secured, we may yet gain the 'Far Side
of Utopia."
