# Frosh Baseballers Beat Menlo for 10-1 Record
## 
### 
Running their season record to
101, Stanford's freshman base
ball team smothered Menlo Col
lege yesterday, 10-2, in a non
league clash on the loser's field.
Shortstop Frank Duffy led Ihe
Papooses with a two-run homer
in the fifth Inning. Outfielder Bill
Holt's first inning hi! brought
across two runs, and centerfielder
Mike Schomakcr was two for
three, scoring three runs and
stealing an amazing six bases. All
told, the frosh stole 12 bases.
Stanford will meet the same
team at home tomorrow at 3:00
p.m. Then they will play their re
maining eight league games. The
team is 0-1 in the league, but
Santa Clara is fast catching up,
at 6-1.
Young Has Reservations
Coach Ray Young surveys the
the rest of the 1 season with a few
reservations. Four of the five
leading hitters, Duffy, Scho
maker. Larry Heath, and Greg
Taylor, are out for spring football
practice, and will see only limited
action.

However, Young foresees an up
sw ing in his team's play as more
games are played. "This was only
our third game in six weeks,"
lamented Young. "Our loss to
Santa Clara came after a four-
I week lay-off for dead week, finals,
i and vacation. As soon as our
pitchers get some valuable prae
i lice, we'll be strong again."
