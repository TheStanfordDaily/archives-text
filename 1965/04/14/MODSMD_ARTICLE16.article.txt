The game was non-league. Toda\ the Indians return to CIBA
action with a game at Santa Clara at 3 p.m. Stanford holds a one

and a half game league lead with

Davis pitcher Steve McCarthy
retired 13 of the first 14 men he
faced and allowed only two hits.

open Stanford's eighth inning.
Then Tom Melzer, with two
strikes on him, swung and missed
a pitch that bounced in front of
the plate and got by the catcher.
Melzer sprinted to first safely,
and McCarthy got credit for a
strikeout.
Card pitcher Bob Hartwig next
sliced a single between first and
second base, sending Melzer i<>
third. Bruce Lytic then replaced
Hartwig as a courtesy runner
and stole second. McCarthy
walked Ron Yett intentionally to
load the bases.
('ox Squeeze limits
Centerl'ielder Bob Cox t hen
laid down a nifty squeeze bunt
that McCarthy dove for, hn i
couldn't scoop up in time to nail
Melzer speeding for the plate.
With the bases still loaded,
Steve Hovley bounced one to the
first baseman, who threw to the
catcher, Bill Ceandrot, to force
Lytic. Ceandrot then faked a
throw to second and tossed the
ball over the third baseman's
head in a vain attempt to pick
off Yett. Yett and Cox scored eas
ily.
