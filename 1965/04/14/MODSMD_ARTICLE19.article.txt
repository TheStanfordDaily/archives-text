# A 						Modus Vivendi
## 
### 
Late last vear, shorth after the dust had set
lied over the Frank Morse case, one young Stan
lord dean, long respected bv tin* students, made
a particularly prophetic comment to an earnest
Daily reporter.
"Either there's going to be a moderation of
view s on the part ol tlx administration, he said,
"or I think we re going to have some kind of in
cident that's going to really blow the place up."
W cml—through most of the first part of this
year there seemed to be little moderation of
administration views.
\nd we did, indeed, have our incident — an
incident which laid bare such deep — and justi
fied — student frustrations as might in time have
"really blow n the place up.
What has prevented that cataclysmic event
from occurring — thus far at least — has been a
determined eflorl on the part of all members of
the university community (and particularly on
the part of President Sterling and the Stanford
administration) to avoid the kind of paralysis of
understanding which, at Berkeley, left men of
general good will on all sides no choice but to
go for each others throats.
The effort to avoid paralysis has required a
liberal expenditure of restraint and a consider
able willingness to compromise by all concerned.
Thus far, that expenditure has been willingly
made.
Most Stanford administrators are probably far
from agreeing with Harold Taylor, former presi
dent of Sarah Lawrence, that "students are right
and the university structure is wrong."
But they have had the willingness to recog
nize temporarily at least, that Dean Winbigler's

comment of last vear that "students tend to resist
authority merely to be resisting authority is
insufficient as a working assumption — that the
judicial reform hill, and the Crow-1 lalverson re
port from which it grew, are products of real
university problems — and that there may be
some wisdom to Taylors further suggestion that
universities "should reorganize the university
structure in order to take advantage of the new
insights regarding education which the students
are developing through their political, social, and
educational reform movements."
Old assumptions and techniques are not easily
shunted aside, but the administration's tentative
acceptance of the judicial competence bill—ham
mered out in long discussions with faculty and
administration — gives one reason to believe that
a significant "moderation of views has in fact
occurred.
Even more than the bill's content, its man
ner ol passage — facilitated by a renewed par
ticipation of the faculty in matters of structural
university reform — brings hope that a great deal
of necessary and positive reform can be effected
in short period — and without wholesale disrup
tion.
In its final form, die judicial bill is a com
promise.
It brings no Utopia into being.
But it does set a precedent for the begin
nings of a modus vivendi within the university
community in which reasonable men can dis
cuss their disagreements — however profound —
in a reasonable fashion, and with a reasonable
assurance that all sides are being heard.
It's a little thing in itself — this modus iircixli.
But it's been a long time coming.
