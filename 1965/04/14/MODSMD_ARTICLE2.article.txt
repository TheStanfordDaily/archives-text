### KATHY ALLEN 
Fifteen years ago, one frus
trated musician each evening
crawled up a steam tunnel
into Hoover Tower to play
"Tea for Two" on the caril
lon. At another time, (lie Al
pine ( 111') painted footprints
up the sid ■ of the same tall
building to its very peak. All
might have continued un
hindered but for 1 lie presence
of one shadowy figure fight
ing a ceaseless battle against
(he forces of evil ever lurking
about our fair and peaceful
campus — Captain Midnight.
Me stopped the tunnel and
stopped the music. No one
knows what happened to I he
Alpine Club, but it has since
disquietingly ceased such on
campus activities.
For years his identity has
been closely guarded. Now,
a mild-mannered reporter for
that great local sheet has
tracked him to his secret hid
ing place.
At long last he is unmasked.
() u e innocuous, mild-man
nered Carl Gielitz .joined the
forces of peace and order
some fifteen years ago. Last
spring, to every motorist's
horror, he was promoted to
Patrol Sergeant and given an
entire heat to supervise.
They told him to keep his
shiny motorcycle — to speed
his work.
They put up a cartoon of

him in their office. It depicts
him standing majestically tri
umphant before a halted
motorist, playing with maud
lin air his violin.
He is playing a "requiem."
The motorist, still unsus
pecting of the untouchable
ness of bis apprehemler, is
whining. "I take it you don't
believe I was only doing 40."
Fat chance.
This Gielitz is a man to
reckon with laughing at the
attempts of students to par
ody him iu "Gaieties" produc
tions. He actually enjoys
them.
After a recent foray onto
the highways and byways,
one sorrowful and ticketed
student was heard to mutter,
"lle'd give his own mother a
ticket!" He laughed at that
too.
As Sergeant Gielitz ducked
into a closet to reemerge in
his other identity as Captain
Midnight, he observed to his
interviewer, "At least they
picked a nickname you c a n
I>rint,** referring of course to
the forces of evil, who years
ago gave him the title.
He slipped out of a window
into the moonlight and onto
bis cycle and was away. A
puzzled observer muttered,
"Say, who is that dark, black
draped man?"
"Why," answered a by
stander, "didn't you know?
That's Captain Midnight!"
