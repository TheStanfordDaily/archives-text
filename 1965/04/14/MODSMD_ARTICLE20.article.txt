# COMMITTEE REPORT
## What We Have Learned 
### 
Editor's Note: Two members j
of the studeiit-l'aculty-adminis
tration committee which consid
ered the Judicial Competence
Kill have agreed to publish
some ol their impressions about
what their committees did, why
it was done ami bow these de
cisions were reached. Rob Sang
ster is a graduate student of
Law; Sanford Doriibuscli is a
professor of Sociology.)
We've come a long way. The
Legislature demonstrated its j
intent, by passing the Judicial
Competence Bill, to accomplish :
certain specific goals. They were: !
• To establish the right of a
student, against whom charges
have been brought by the Office
of the Dean of Students, to be \
judged wholly within the ASSU
Judicial System.
• To eliminate exertion of Uni-j
versity pressure upon students as
to exercise of their rights and.
to this end, to require the Dean j
of Students to inform each stu- j
dent charged with an offense of i
all of his rights.
• To establish the principle
that a student should not, and
cannot, be held to answer for con
duct unless, at the time it
occurred, he did believe or rea
sonably should have believed that |
such conduct was a violation of
the Fundamental Standard and
would incur disciplinary action.
The idea was to free students !
from being held to answer to an
oft-iilusory body of law referred ;
to as "unartieulated University!
policy." Such policy, shimmering
chameleon-like beneath the Iran- {
quil surface of neatly written
rules and regulations, seemed all i
too frequently to spring forth and '
coil about the hapless and unsus- i
peeting student.
• To establish a mechanism
whereby the students would have |
an effective voice, through tit e
Legislature, in the formulation of
University policies relating to stu
dent conduct.
• To achive immediate elarifi- i
cation of University regulations
and policies which purport to j
regulate students regarding sex
ual activity (and, presumbaly, in- I
activity), political activity, and
liquor intake - and their revi
sion, perhaps in the order sug-j
gested, if appropriate.
The first four of these goals I
have been reached. The process is |
underway to attain the fifth.
Convinced that our goals were
legitimate, wo sought a method
by which ethically, they could be
attained. In retrospect, we believe
that the method selecled, that of
frank, arduous discussion and de
bate between representatives of
the three constituents of our com
munity, was the most effective
and most valuable available. We
got, by and large, what we
w ante d. Of equal importance,
however, we have "engaged th e
enemy" and found him to be, as
we had premised, rational, intelli
gent, and interested in our
thoughts and desires as well as
his own. It is significant that the
four men representing the Stu
dent Body in these recent discus
sions agree that the Faculty and
the Administration representa
tives were present in good faith,
without pre-conceived positions or
irrevocable commitments. It be
came apparent that they had poli
tical problems within their own
constituencies and that they were
perhaps, as they might be, em
barrassed at the lack of leader
ship in our community by the fac
ulty.
We can expect that within the
next few weeks we shall see in
action the new. or renovated, con- j
eept of a student-faculty liaison |
as the most likely combination i
through which mutual agree-;
menls can be made to result in
changes in the now unilaterally
determined governing standards
of conduct. A change in the liquor j
policy appears imminent.
The dissenters to the product of
these discussions (LASSU passed
the Bill 81-11) must recognize I hat

Ihey fail in their responsibilities,
if they believe in their position,
by offering no more than eriti
pism. They must offer construe
live solutions for future problems.
Similarly, however, those mem
bers of the faculty and adminis
tration who expressed belief thai
there "were no real issues" and
that the students were "making
trouble" and issuing "deadlines"
as challenges must now recognize
ihat the student body has demon
strated that it feels there are
real issues, that it is concerned
with maintenance of its dignity
and is determined to assume a
position with the faculty and ad
ministration in formulation of the
governing and guiding principles
of tho University. In sum, it must
be acknowledged that the student
body has acted honorably, w i th
deep consideration for the repu
tation of this University. Our ap
proach toward implementation of
the Judicial Competence Bill was
one of responsibility, good faith,
and determination. It worked, but
there are miles to go before we
sleep.

• Dornhusch's
Impressions
There were no devils among
the student leaders with whom
we dealt. Everyone spoke and
acted in complete good faith. I
didn't realize how old I am. To
day's students talk and think
very differently from those of a
few years ago, and my graduating
class of 1948 is several genera
tions back.
• Students think universities
are efficient. The typical slow
pace of committee effort is seen
by some students as a calculated
reaction to student pressure.
o Newspapers are not better
than ever. All the papers stressed
conflict and ignored movement to
ward agreement.
• There were real issues behind
student concerns. Thev were not
living in a fantasy world.
• Students perceive faculty
members as apathetic good guys
One of the constructive results of
President Sterling's leadership
has been increased interaction
among University officers and
faculty. Recent events have in
creased communication with stu
dents and emphasized the impor
tance of faculty participation in
University affairs. Perhaps we
shall soon even have an interest
ing Academic Council meeting!
• Einstein was right. Time is
relative. For students, the end of
the world comes every June. The
student desire for haste is some
limes interpreted as undue pics
sure when it really represents a
need for achievement on an an
nual basis.
• Any issue will do. The issue
at Stanford is neither judicial
process nor social regulations, but
the wish to have a voice in Univer
sity decision-making.
• Even if dead wrong, student
action may help make a better
university. It forces faculty and
University officers to examine
their own beliefs and assess their
current \alidity.
• Judicial competence was the
first of many issues. We sought
to develop a mechanism for re
solving problems we haven't yet
imagined. With goodwill, it may
work. It did for us.
