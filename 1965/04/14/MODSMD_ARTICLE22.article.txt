# Are You Dressing More Now -But Enjoying It Less?
## Styles for the Stanford Campus 
### 
Fashion being as it is some
what of a traumatic experience
for all aeculturated women, the
coining of every change of sea
son precludes days fraught
with anxiety as females try to
figure what it is they may
wear.
It's not a question of "What
do I wear?" It's a question of
"What do I wear if she wears
what she thinks I think she's
going to wear because I think
she thinks 1 don't know what
she thinks I think I do."
Realizing as we do that most
Stanford coeds are far too busy
eating sunflower seeds or stag
ing water balloon fights to
spend much time on fashion
able pursuits, we have decided
to sally forth with our ready
made answer to every young
lady's wardrobe problems.
Ours is a basic and minimal
list of "must-haves" for the

fashionable for the spring of
1965:
1. Four green book bags to
be unseamed and sewn to
gether as a poncho. Absolutely
indispensible. Goes with every
thing.
2. Mud-brown, waterproof,
army-surplus raincoat with
hood. Should ideally be several
sizes too large and hit two
inches above the knee.
3. Three burlap A-line skirts,
baggy as can be. UNDER NO
C I r'c umstance s may
THESE SKIRTS EVER BE
WASHED OR IRONED.
4. Three black long-sleeved
turtle-necked pullovers for cool
weather.
5. Three black sleeveless tur
tle-necked pullovers for warm
weather.
6. One pair progressively

shrinkable wliite levis for dorm
and casual wear.
7. One pair while levis cut off
1o two inches above the knees.
To be worn under mud-brown,
waterproof, army-surplus rain
coat to all quad classes on rainy
days.
8. One pair "made in Italy,
Greece or Israel" leather thongs
for all quad and casual wear.
9. One pair high-heeled thongs
to be saved for those occasions
designated as "cocktail" or
"very dressy."
10. Three sleeved or sleeve
less, high cut or low cut ab
solutely non-commital black
dresses to be worn for all social
occasions when the young man
announces cheerfully "It's (.-oat
and tie."
11. One supercstlifragilisticex
pialeious-type black dress for
good-and-dressy occasions.
ALSO SUITABLE FOR
DRESSY OCCASIONS:
One perfectly good, left-over
high-school skirt and sweater to
be worn with unpolished loaf
ers and an air of complete de
fiance.

what she thinks I think she's
going to wear because I think
she thinks 1 don't know what
she thinks I think I do."

eating sunflower seeds or stag
ing water balloon fights to
spend much time on fashion
able pursuits, we have decided

sizes too large and hit two
inches above the knee.
