# CALIFORNIA CRAZE
## Sun Tans For Sale 
### 
Whenever sweet young things get the fashion bug, the settle
ment of "What shall 1 wear" is only the beginning. No self
respecting female could ever turn her mind to other topics until
the equally weighty problems of "what shade of black mas
cara' or "what shade of blonde hair ' has also been settled.

It's not just that women can't
ever make up their minds.
Things change.
But predictably, eveiy spring
time, comes ihe great push to
"California Tan."
Selling like hot cakes on the
East Coast are any and all cos
metic preparations which either
signify or imply some connec
tion or resemblance to the girls
in that never-never surfers'
paradise.
Of course, real genuine Cali
fornia surfers have no need of
anything to make them look
like the genuine article. But for
poor unfortunates recently im
migrated from the East or dol
lies stuck studying in dark gar
rets for most of winter quarter,
the latest glowy tan powders
and pearly bright blushers are
a boon beyond compare.
Likewise, evei'yone knows
that the natives scorn to paint
their lips. But visitors on the sly
have been known to wow male
sun worshippers with soft and
pale lipsticks. Also found to
have magnetic properties are
the new clear but shiny lip
glosses, which have the added
advantage of tasting good too.
It has been found that the
eyes of surfing dollies tend to
have one thing in common —
a certain "wow." How each fe
male accomplishes her particu
lar brand of eye appeal is a
closely guarded secret, but it is
known that all use such things
as eyeliner (in various shades
of brown and black), mascara
(in various shades of black and
black) and eyeshadow (in vari
ous shades of brown-green-blue
purple).
According to our most es
teemed fashion magazines, the
latest in hair styles is to wear

it either long and straight or
short and straight. Very clean
.and shiny.
But since four-foot free flow
ing hair tends to look a little
odd on five-foot tall girls, and
since not every coed has the
perfect features of a fashion
mannequin, il is perhaps pre
dictable that most young ladies
wear their hair exactly as they
please.

dictable that most young ladies
wear their hair exactly as they
please.
Whenever sweet young things get the fashion bug, the settle
ment of "What shall 1 wear" is only the beginning. No self
respecting female could ever turn her mind to other topics until
the equally weighty problems of "what shade of black mas
cara' or "what shade of blonde hair ' has also been settled.

It's not just that women can't
ever make up their minds.
Things change.
But predictably, eveiy spring
time, comes ihe great push to
"California Tan."
Selling like hot cakes on the
East Coast are any and all cos
metic preparations which either
signify or imply some connec
tion or resemblance to the girls
in that never-never surfers'
paradise.
Of course, real genuine Cali
fornia surfers have no need of
anything to make them look
like the genuine article. But for
poor unfortunates recently im
migrated from the East or dol
lies stuck studying in dark gar
rets for most of winter quarter,
the latest glowy tan powders
and pearly bright blushers are
a boon beyond compare.
Likewise, evei'yone knows
that the natives scorn to paint
their lips. But visitors on the sly
have been known to wow male
sun worshippers with soft and
pale lipsticks. Also found to
have magnetic properties are
the new clear but shiny lip
glosses, which have the added
advantage of tasting good too.
It has been found that the
eyes of surfing dollies tend to
have one thing in common —
a certain "wow." How each fe
male accomplishes her particu
lar brand of eye appeal is a
closely guarded secret, but it is
known that all use such things
as eyeliner (in various shades
of brown and black), mascara
(in various shades of black and
black) and eyeshadow (in vari
ous shades of brown-green-blue
purple).
According to our most es
teemed fashion magazines, the
latest in hair styles is to wear

it either long and straight or
short and straight. Very clean
.and shiny.
But since four-foot free flow
ing hair tends to look a little
odd on five-foot tall girls, and
since not every coed has the
perfect features of a fashion
mannequin, il is perhaps pre
dictable that most young ladies
wear their hair exactly as they
please.
