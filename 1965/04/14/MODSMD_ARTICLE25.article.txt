# Introducing Super-Kick, The Source Of SU Chic
## 
### 
And here we have Super-
Kick, t Ik* swinging Stanford
coed. Utlic of limb and long on
looks, she's super-up on all the
styles that will briny her
double-blinks this spring of
1965.
At the base of her fashion
p hi I os op h y, Super-Kick is
strong 011 classical stand-bys
like loafers, madras, and skirts
and blouses for quad. Realiz
ing full well, however, that she
can never gel daddy to re-vamp
her clothes allowance unless
she convinces him she's in
really dire need, Super-Kick
must, periodically, come up
with something new.
This spring she opts for
weird-bright color combos and
way-out pattern mixes.
High (ill the "In" list are
things like marmalade orange
with sky blue, grass green with
gun-metal gray, and navy ink
with delicate pink. To he used
to maximum effect, color com
binations must break all th e
rules and garner incredulous

stares as Su|>er-Kiek bops to
class.
Super-Kick also likes stripes
with checks or plaids or polka
dots.
Although generally against
blase things that match, Super-
Kiek makes an exception when
it comes to patterned stockings
and their corresponding tops or
shifts. She may turn up in blue
pink-yellow swirlicues or purple
print. Super-Kick is, however,
something of a realist in one
respect. When her beloved pat
terned stockings become pep
pered with runs, sin' consigns
them to at-liome-in-her-room
where - no - one • else - can
see-them wear.
Super-Kick also rallies loud
and long for quad-wear shifts.
She garners them with beads
or enamel arm bangles or dan
gling jade drops for her super
pierced ears and knows that the
first thing to do when buying a
shift is to throw the belt away.
Super-Kick lives in her snazz
leather sandals. Occasionally,
however, (like when wearing

her print stockings) she has
been known to consent to ultra
cut-out flats in shades like
taxi-cab yellow or candy-apple
red. High-heeled versions of
these same snazz shoes serve
Super-Kick for dress-up occa
sions.
When Super-Kick goes cas
ual, the only decision she ever
deigns to make is which pair
of white levis it'll be this time.
Super-Kick avoids sweatshirts
like the plague. Having discov
ered one day to her horror that
bulge hides her bod, she no w
chooses pullovers (even black
will do).
Super-Kick's traumatic con
clusion that extra material is
decidedly unnecessary forms
the basis of her swim suit col
lection. Not even the current
fishnet fandangos could ever
lure her back into a classical
one-piece suit. But fishnet in a
two-piece —now THAT'S some
thing else.
At the opposite end of the
spectrum, Super-Kick's dressy
clothes tend to be surprisingly

demure. She's now discovering
little jackets and skirts in inter
esting new materials. Dotted
swiss ANYTHING is automati
cally good. White pique, quilt
ing and slithery crepe are too.
When Super-Kick dresses up,
she often appears In overt mani
festations of her "Stanford
syndrome." Sometimes it's in
silky shifts as straight up a n d
down as Hoover Tower. Some
times it's in printed items as
way out as the Stanford Mu
seum. If she plans to really
swing, Super-Kick may add a
hair-piece or two to make her
look like Mem Claw.
Other favorite gambits for
the incognito bit are eyelet and
flowers and white flowered
stockings and black velvet mary
janes, in which she looks
straight out of Alice and Won
derland, or layers and layers of
pastel crepe — the very nearest
things to great-grandmother's
tear table.
With these she wears a cot
ton candy full-length coat. Pre
ferably quilted.

Sometimes just for kicks,
however, Super-Kick may show
up in her stunning mud-brown
army surplus raincoat.
Although she hates suits like
the purple plague, Super-Kick
has finally consented to have
just one stuffed way hack in her
closet to be worn only on Easter
Sunday and when Aunt Bertha
comes to call.
Occasionally, of course, Sup
er-Kick runs into a date who's
seriously taken-aback by her
novel way with clothes. At
these moments she just smiles
helplessly and says "but all you
said was coat and tie, and I
knew I couldn't wear that."
Super-Kick has given up try
ing to explain that there's no
Fl'N in being fashionable.
She's seen enough little black
rufflics to last her a life-time.
And it's also highly unlikely
that you'll ever again see Super-
Kick at a cocktail party in her
low-cut zapperroo.
She's saving that particular
little number for her eight
o'clocks on quad.


TRAVEL TOGS—Super-Kick looks especially dashing cis she sets
off for a week-end jaunt in the country. Note her lovely bell
bottom white levis and dotted swiss combat jacket. Her slcish
ancl-cut high-heeled sandals add that extra touch.

er-Kick runs into a date who's
seriously taken-aback by her
novel way with clothes. At
these moments she just smiles
helplessly and says "but all you
said was coat and tie, and I
knew I couldn't wear that."
Super-Kick has given up try
ing to explain that there's no
Fl'N in being fashionable.
She's seen enough little black
rufflics to last her a life-time.
And it's also highly unlikely
that you'll ever again see Super-
Kick at a cocktail party in her
low-cut zapperroo.
She's saving that particular
little number for her eight
o'clocks on quad.


TRAVEL TOGS—Super-Kick looks especially dashing cis she sets
off for a week-end jaunt in the country. Note her lovely bell
bottom white levis and dotted swiss combat jacket. Her slcish
ancl-cut high-heeled sandals add that extra touch.
And here we have Super-
Kick, t Ik* swinging Stanford
coed. Utlic of limb and long on
looks, she's super-up on all the
styles that will briny her
double-blinks this spring of
1965.
At the base of her fashion
p hi I os op h y, Super-Kick is
strong 011 classical stand-bys
like loafers, madras, and skirts
and blouses for quad. Realiz
ing full well, however, that she
can never gel daddy to re-vamp
her clothes allowance unless
she convinces him she's in
really dire need, Super-Kick
must, periodically, come up
with something new.
This spring she opts for
weird-bright color combos and
way-out pattern mixes.
High (ill the "In" list are
things like marmalade orange
with sky blue, grass green with
gun-metal gray, and navy ink
with delicate pink. To he used
to maximum effect, color com
binations must break all th e
rules and garner incredulous

stares as Su|>er-Kiek bops to
class.
Super-Kick also likes stripes
with checks or plaids or polka
dots.
Although generally against
blase things that match, Super-
Kiek makes an exception when
it comes to patterned stockings
and their corresponding tops or
shifts. She may turn up in blue
pink-yellow swirlicues or purple
print. Super-Kick is, however,
something of a realist in one
respect. When her beloved pat
terned stockings become pep
pered with runs, sin' consigns
them to at-liome-in-her-room
where - no - one • else - can
see-them wear.
Super-Kick also rallies loud
and long for quad-wear shifts.
She garners them with beads
or enamel arm bangles or dan
gling jade drops for her super
pierced ears and knows that the
first thing to do when buying a
shift is to throw the belt away.
Super-Kick lives in her snazz
leather sandals. Occasionally,
however, (like when wearing

her print stockings) she has
been known to consent to ultra
cut-out flats in shades like
taxi-cab yellow or candy-apple
red. High-heeled versions of
these same snazz shoes serve
Super-Kick for dress-up occa
sions.
When Super-Kick goes cas
ual, the only decision she ever
deigns to make is which pair
of white levis it'll be this time.
Super-Kick avoids sweatshirts
like the plague. Having discov
ered one day to her horror that
bulge hides her bod, she no w
chooses pullovers (even black
will do).
Super-Kick's traumatic con
clusion that extra material is
decidedly unnecessary forms
the basis of her swim suit col
lection. Not even the current
fishnet fandangos could ever
lure her back into a classical
one-piece suit. But fishnet in a
two-piece —now THAT'S some
thing else.
At the opposite end of the
spectrum, Super-Kick's dressy
clothes tend to be surprisingly

demure. She's now discovering
little jackets and skirts in inter
esting new materials. Dotted
swiss ANYTHING is automati
cally good. White pique, quilt
ing and slithery crepe are too.
When Super-Kick dresses up,
she often appears In overt mani
festations of her "Stanford
syndrome." Sometimes it's in
silky shifts as straight up a n d
down as Hoover Tower. Some
times it's in printed items as
way out as the Stanford Mu
seum. If she plans to really
swing, Super-Kick may add a
hair-piece or two to make her
look like Mem Claw.
Other favorite gambits for
the incognito bit are eyelet and
flowers and white flowered
stockings and black velvet mary
janes, in which she looks
straight out of Alice and Won
derland, or layers and layers of
pastel crepe — the very nearest
things to great-grandmother's
tear table.
With these she wears a cot
ton candy full-length coat. Pre
ferably quilted.

Sometimes just for kicks,
however, Super-Kick may show
up in her stunning mud-brown
army surplus raincoat.
Although she hates suits like
the purple plague, Super-Kick
has finally consented to have
just one stuffed way hack in her
closet to be worn only on Easter
Sunday and when Aunt Bertha
comes to call.

seum. If she plans to really
swing, Super-Kick may add a
hair-piece or two to make her
look like Mem Claw.
Other favorite gambits for
the incognito bit are eyelet and
flowers and white flowered
stockings and black velvet mary
janes, in which she looks
straight out of Alice and Won
derland, or layers and layers of
pastel crepe — the very nearest
things to great-grandmother's
tear table.
With these she wears a cot
ton candy full-length coat. Pre
ferably quilted.

Sometimes just for kicks,
however, Super-Kick may show
up in her stunning mud-brown
army surplus raincoat.
Although she hates suits like
the purple plague, Super-Kick
has finally consented to have
just one stuffed way hack in her
closet to be worn only on Easter
Sunday and when Aunt Bertha
comes to call.
Occasionally, of course, Sup
er-Kick runs into a date who's
seriously taken-aback by her
novel way with clothes. At
these moments she just smiles
helplessly and says "but all you
said was coat and tie, and I
knew I couldn't wear that."
Super-Kick has given up try
ing to explain that there's no
Fl'N in being fashionable.
She's seen enough little black
rufflics to last her a life-time.
And it's also highly unlikely
that you'll ever again see Super-
Kick at a cocktail party in her
low-cut zapperroo.
She's saving that particular
little number for her eight
o'clocks on quad.


TRAVEL TOGS—Super-Kick looks especially dashing cis she sets
off for a week-end jaunt in the country. Note her lovely bell
bottom white levis and dotted swiss combat jacket. Her slcish
ancl-cut high-heeled sandals add that extra touch.
And here we have Super-
Kick, t Ik* swinging Stanford
coed. Utlic of limb and long on
looks, she's super-up on all the
styles that will briny her
double-blinks this spring of
1965.
At the base of her fashion
p hi I os op h y, Super-Kick is
strong 011 classical stand-bys
like loafers, madras, and skirts
and blouses for quad. Realiz
ing full well, however, that she
can never gel daddy to re-vamp
her clothes allowance unless
she convinces him she's in
really dire need, Super-Kick
must, periodically, come up
with something new.
This spring she opts for
weird-bright color combos and
way-out pattern mixes.
High (ill the "In" list are
things like marmalade orange
with sky blue, grass green with
gun-metal gray, and navy ink
with delicate pink. To he used
to maximum effect, color com
binations must break all th e
rules and garner incredulous

stares as Su|>er-Kiek bops to
class.
Super-Kick also likes stripes
with checks or plaids or polka
dots.
Although generally against
blase things that match, Super-
Kiek makes an exception when
it comes to patterned stockings
and their corresponding tops or
shifts. She may turn up in blue
pink-yellow swirlicues or purple
print. Super-Kick is, however,
something of a realist in one
respect. When her beloved pat
terned stockings become pep
pered with runs, sin' consigns
them to at-liome-in-her-room
where - no - one • else - can
see-them wear.
Super-Kick also rallies loud
and long for quad-wear shifts.
She garners them with beads
or enamel arm bangles or dan
gling jade drops for her super
pierced ears and knows that the
first thing to do when buying a
shift is to throw the belt away.
Super-Kick lives in her snazz
leather sandals. Occasionally,
however, (like when wearing

her print stockings) she has
been known to consent to ultra
cut-out flats in shades like
taxi-cab yellow or candy-apple
red. High-heeled versions of
these same snazz shoes serve
Super-Kick for dress-up occa
sions.
When Super-Kick goes cas
ual, the only decision she ever
deigns to make is which pair
of white levis it'll be this time.
Super-Kick avoids sweatshirts
like the plague. Having discov
ered one day to her horror that
bulge hides her bod, she no w
chooses pullovers (even black
will do).
Super-Kick's traumatic con
clusion that extra material is
decidedly unnecessary forms
the basis of her swim suit col
lection. Not even the current
fishnet fandangos could ever
lure her back into a classical
one-piece suit. But fishnet in a
two-piece —now THAT'S some
thing else.
At the opposite end of the
spectrum, Super-Kick's dressy
clothes tend to be surprisingly

demure. She's now discovering
little jackets and skirts in inter
esting new materials. Dotted
swiss ANYTHING is automati
cally good. White pique, quilt
ing and slithery crepe are too.
When Super-Kick dresses up,
she often appears In overt mani
festations of her "Stanford
syndrome." Sometimes it's in
silky shifts as straight up a n d
down as Hoover Tower. Some
times it's in printed items as
way out as the Stanford Mu
seum. If she plans to really
swing, Super-Kick may add a
hair-piece or two to make her
