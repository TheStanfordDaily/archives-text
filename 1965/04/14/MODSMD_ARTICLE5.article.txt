• Viet Cong Push Expected
SAIGON' U.S. officials said at a State Department briefing
that the Communists may be preparing for a big offensive in central
or northern South Viet Nam
President Johnson assigned Henry Cabol Lodge to undertake a
special mission in Asia to bolster support for U.S. policy in Viet
Nam. The former ambassador to Viet Nam leaves Washington this
week for talks with leaders in Australia, New Zealand, the Philip- i
pines, Formosa, Japan and South Korea.
The U.S. officials said there has been neither a public nor a private j
sign from the Communist capitals of wanting to take up Johnson's j
April 7 offer of unconditional peace discussions on Viet Nam.
In assessing a lull over the past couple of weeks in activity by
the Communist Viet Cong guerrillas, the U.S. officials said there is
evidence the Reds have been resting, regrouping and strengthening!
their forces in the central and northern parts of South Viet Nam. j
Past patterns indicate that the Viet Cong strike after a pause, it was j
stated.
• Soviets Deny Space Report
MOSCOW Soviet scientists yesterday repudiated a Tass news '
agency report that they had uncovered evidence of intelligent beings !
in outer space trying to communicate with other planets.

space. The report touched off skeptical reactions from scientists j
around the world.

• Record Flooding Expected

As Minnesota moved into its second week of flooding, the Weather
Bureau said a tremendous water buildup on the Mississippi River
is expected to move past St. Paul at a record 27 feet on Friday on
its way to the Gulf of Mexico.
The floodwaters have taken 10 lives in Minnesota thus far and !
, caused an estimated $20 million in damage.
• Rescue Work Continues
Volunteers continued digging yesterday into twisted rubble for j
! additional victims of more than a dozen separate tornadoes that 1
raked a six-state Midwest area Sunday with devastating effect.
; The count of dead climbed to 219 as clean-up crews dug into
| smashed homes, businesses and farm buildings, mainly in Indiana I
and Ohio, where the twisters took their heaviest tolls.
There were no official figures on the number of persons hurt in
'the Palm Sunday onslaught but Red Cross officials estimated at
| least 5,000 suffered injuries to some extent. The dollar loss was j
placed at more than $23.1 million, possibly much more.
