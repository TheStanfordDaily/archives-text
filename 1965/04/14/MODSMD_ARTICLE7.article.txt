; The Young Republicans' news
i letter, expanded to blanket the en

I studied look at economic policy
to an unstudied rant about the
radical ogre.
Bob Naylor's editorial bemoans
the lack of discussion and debate

"Economic Needs vs. Political

Expediency," by Dr. Roger A.
Freeman begins as a serious in
vestigation of our economic sys
tem and ends, unpredictably, in
an attack on the income tax.
Dr. Freeman's thesis seems to
be that capitalism is a blessing
because the balance of individual
greed produces the greatest eco
nomic benefit. What is most dis
turbing is his bland acceptance
that greed should rule our lives.
Like Freeman's article, Fr; nk
Verlot's article on Communist
guerrilla tactics begins as "ra
tional" analysis and ends as a
paranoid tirade against some
bogey man: here it is the "polem
ics of Lippman, editorials of the
Times, the rantings of Morse, the
pleadings of politieos, the howl of
perennial fellow travelers." I lis
blood thirsty desire for a total
American victory seems to rival
Maos' Communist determination.

article on campus radicalism, re

cals like sunshine and pizza pie
just like other people.
Without it one can easily lose
sight thai the student radical is
;i human being. After quoting
Kerr, Sterling, and other noted
| authorities on the inner workings
|of the radical's mind, Naylor
moves on to an exposition of the
'sinister motives of these evil
j beings, ll is nothing loss than "re
i forming American society . .
1 and along SDS "lines,'' a line
'quoted from the GCC Newsletter.
Omitted is a critque of these
"lines" as well as any understand
ing of what is really going on.
Roger Magnuson's spleen in the
article on page 9 ("The 'Great
ness' of M. L. King"> is entirely
beneath notice. But il must be
mentioned anyway. Here's a man
who can beg a moral question
with both eyes closed.
For those who have a between
class-break to spare, here is a
publication well worth the time
and money.

"Economic Needs vs. Political

Expediency," by Dr. Roger A.
Freeman begins as a serious in
vestigation of our economic sys
tem and ends, unpredictably, in
an attack on the income tax.
Dr. Freeman's thesis seems to
be that capitalism is a blessing
because the balance of individual
greed produces the greatest eco
nomic benefit. What is most dis
turbing is his bland acceptance
that greed should rule our lives.

Verlot's article on Communist
guerrilla tactics begins as "ra

paranoid tirade against some
bogey man: here it is the "polem
