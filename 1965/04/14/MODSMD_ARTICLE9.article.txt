In the Inter-Fraternity Council
election Monday night Bob Free
man was elected IFC President.
He received 26 out of 45 votes to
defeat Rick Sawyer of Phi Delta
Gamma, and Bill Henley of Phi
Kappa Sigma.
Scotl McGilvray Delta Up
silon was chosen vice-president.
Running against McGilvray were
Leith Anderson of Kappa Sigma
and Larry Mitchell of Chi Si.
The office of secretary was en
trusted to Don Balea of ATO.
Freshman Ray Col by was
elected Inter House Council presi
dent last night by defeating Nick
Davis by a margin of 205 io 136
with 56 votes going to write-in
candidates.
Colby, the first freshman to be
elected to this post, promises to
"promote an attitude of activism
to give the residents a maximum
of opportunity with a minimum
of pressure to participate."
Colby's election marks the first
time a resident of one of the
smaller, front houses has boon
elected, according to Douglas
Hall, the outgoing IHC president.
Specifically, ho is interested in
speeding up the program of pro
viding suites in Stern similar to
those found in the new clusters.
With a platform entitled Proj
ect Aware, Colby will attempt to
destroy apathy in Stern Hall.
According to Colby, "A deter
mined effort must be made to get
and keep top individuals as R.A.'s.
Their value extends beyond dis
cipline; as mature, experienced,
provocative individuals, they can
provide the necessary stimulus
for creative thought."
In the primary election, Colby
received a plurality but not ;i
majority of the votes. That elec
tion also included two amend
ments to the IHC constitution.
The first amendment, which
was defeated, would have charged
each Stern resident $1.00 instead
of $.50 for IHC dues. The second
amendment, removing the limita
tion that the IHC vice-president
bp a house president, was ap
proved.
Colby's term of office begins
Monday and runs until Monday
of the fourth week of next Spring
Quarter.
