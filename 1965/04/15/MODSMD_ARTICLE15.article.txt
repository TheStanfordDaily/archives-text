THE WISDOM OF JFK
ed. T. S. Settel. E. I*. Dutton.
128 pages. $8.00.
The latest addition to the bur
geoning of Kennedianna is a lii
tle book called The Wisdom of
JFK, a compilation of selections
from the late President's
speeches. The chief problems in
anthologies of this kind is uni
fying the selections (1) with con
sistency of thought, and (2J with
a consistency of purpose. The
former is not within the ant holo
gist's domain, but the latter defi
nitely is; and there T. S. Settel,
who compiled this volume, runs
into difficulties.
His preface, which ought, cer
tainly, to emphasize the prin
ciples used in choosing the selec
tions and thus the purpose of tiie
book, does no such thing. In
stead, it eulogizes Kennedy as a
man of great "wisdom" and "elo
quence," concluding, "In this
small selection of the wisdom of
JFK will be found some of th e
words most likely to make their
mark in history."
Settle is clearly uneasy about
the relationship between form
and content and their bearing on
his anthology, as well as vague
about the meaning of "wisdom."
Webster on Wisdom
Webster has this to say: "Wis
dom is the capacity of judging
soundly and dealing broadly with
facts; especially in their practical
relations to life and conduct; it
often implies depth of insight or
ripeness of experience."
One immediately thinks of the

wisdom of Confucius, and that
association neatly exposes Set
lei's error. JFK displays none of
the reflections on experience and
I prescriptions for conduct that
have characterized the world's
I moral philosophers except when
it quotes those philosophers.
One would not expect it to do
so, either, since it is a collection
of speeches concerned with af
fairs of the moment; delivered
during the tenure of a political
office. If anything, it reveals
Kennedy as a man of high ideals
and noble purpose, a man who
was not afraid to state his ideals
and sacrifice for them and who
expected his fellow man to do
the same, but who knew history
well enough not to expect too
much of of him. It is a portrait
of a man, not wisdom for the
ages.
Eloquence and Wisdom
Then there is that uneasiness
about eloquence. Seitel doesn't
mention it in the title, yet he
links it with "wisdom" in his
preface as if the two were in
separable. Now form and content
| may be inseparable in literature,
! but they are not necessarily so
! elsewhere.
In fact, speeches are nearly al
ways judged on the basis of rhe
toric, on their power to persuade
or move to action. And a demon
i stration of eloquence requires re
| printing more of a single speech
| than Settel offers; a sentence or

jan abbreviated paragraph will
I not do.
• Moreover, Settel must know
that nowadays Presidents do not
write all their speeches; t hey
simply do not have the time. Yel
he makes no effort to establish
the eloquence as Kennedy's,
; when, for all the reader knows,
| it may be Theodore Sorensen's —
Kennedy's speechwriter — rather
| than the President's himself.
Living Biography
What emerges, then, is neither
! wisdom nor a great deal of elo
j quence (whose eloquence is not
certain, either). Rather, it. is
what has been elsewhere termed
i the "living biography" of a com
; manding figure, a man w hose
| watchwords were humility and
responsibility. He may be sum
med up in this quotation from
his last speech, never given:
"We in this country, in this
| generation, are by destiny
I rather than choice — the watch
men on the walls of world free
dom. We ask, therefore, that we
may exercise our strength w i I h
wisdom and restraint, and that
| we may achieve in our time and
for all time the ancient vision of
'peace on earth, goodwill toward
; men.' That must always be our
j goal, and ihe righteousness of
j our cause must always underlie
j our strength. For as was written
j long ago: 'Except the Lord keep
the city, the watchman waketh
1 but in vain.' "
