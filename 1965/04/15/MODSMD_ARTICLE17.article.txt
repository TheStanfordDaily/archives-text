### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
When writing about a play by
a "classic" playwright like Mo
liere, critics (and publicists) are
quick to point out that the play
is still performed because the
points it makes and the ideas it:

In its examination of hypocrisy

Here was a very funny writer.
And the Stanford Players' pro
duction of "Tartuffe" now run
