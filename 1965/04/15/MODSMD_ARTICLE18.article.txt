# Lou Gottlieb At Tangent
## 
### PHIL DEGUERE 
"I hope lhat some ol' the things
which go on in my mind might,
! when properly articulated, be
amusing to people who aren't be
-1 ing overcharged."
So spoke part-time Limeliter
i Lou Gott lieb in a hasty back
j stage discussion between shows
lat Palo Alto's Top of the Tan
! gent, where he is currently ap
pearing. He seemed a little em
harassed at; having to articulate
! what he does on stage, and re
peatedly said the thing to do was
i watch his act.
Unfortunately, the act of watch
ing and listening to this extra
j ordinary performer is so divert
ing that it is almost impossible
ito come away with any single
! impression, olher than that he
i is a very funny man.
His shows are divided almost
; half and half between a ram-
I bling monologue on whatever
! seems to be in his mind at the
i time, and a short series of un
j usual folk songs. The humor is
i somewhat better than the music,
i perhaps because he achieves a
| greater degree of contact with
i the audience. Sitting alone on
| the stage, leaning on his bass, ho
: is less a performer, and so more
i of a personality.
Gottlieb is, if anything, too
| subtle. A number of cracks eli-
I cited no response at all, but when
! he connected, the audience went
I wild. Nor should this be too
| surprising to anyone familiar
I with the old Limeliters, when
| Gottlieb carried most of the ban
ter between songs.
But his voice Is a little too
i rough, his delivery a little too
; stark, to make him a commer
cial-type folksinger. He handles
i only certain types of songs well,
but within this area he is ver
satile indeed. He can sing with
i equal authority "Rumania Ru
-1 mania," in Rumanian, and the
â–  old Negro work song, "No More
' Cane on This Brazos."
Gottlieb is too much a force
lon the stage to make him easy
!to describe. His appeal comes
| from his ability to bring the au
' dience along with him as he
rambles from subject to subject
| or song to song. lie has been a
j professional since the age of six,
and it shows.
Lou Gottlieb appears three
times nightly, tonight through
j Sunday, at the Tangent in Palo
J Alto. With him is Buddy Bohn,
i as usual. Reservations are recom
mended for ihe early shows.
