# LASSU May Investigate Fraternities
## Tabled Issue To Be Resolved 
### 
LASS I , tonight will once
again try to resolve the politi
cally potent issue of an investi
gation of initiation practices,
which was tabled last week lor
the second week in a row. The
meeting will he at 7:30 p.m. in
Room 320, Geology Corner.
The resolution, calling for an
ASSU investigation of possible
Fundamental Standard violations
in fraternity "work week" activi
ties, has been opposed by the
IPC, which is conducting its own
investigation.
A compromise amendment was
introduced last week by Theta
Chi representative Bill Keylor,
but the entire issue was tabled
before a vote could be taken.
Social Kegs Report
According to Speaker Ed Shaw,
a report from the social regula
tions implementation committee
may bo made. Shaw indicated
that administrative problems may
delay actual implementation past
the April 16 deadline set by the
Legislature.
Another Constitutional amend
ment may be introduced tonight
striking the rule that the Speak
er has to be elected the begin
ning of the school year. The pro
posal would have the Speaker
elected in the spring, so that the
President would never serve as
speaker and continuity in the
Legislature would be assured.
Another by-law will be intro
duced from the Committee on
Voluntary Organizations, headed
by Jay Kadane, which would
establish petty cash funds.
Petty Cash Fund
Currently, according to Stu
dent Financial Manager John
Andcrholt, petty cash funds
exist on an informal basis. How
ever, a strict interpretation of
the Student's Organization Fund
Rules does not permit them.
Under the present procedures,
a student has, technically, to fill
out a purchase order for every
expenditure that he makes, even
if il is only for a few cents,
Shaw first proposed petty cash
funds in his Student Financial
Manager's report of last year,
feeling that the present method
of doing things is a waste of
ASSU time and creates unneces
sary expenses for the ASSU.
One potentially controversial
issue which will come up at to
night's meeting is a resolution
sponsored by Tom Rado, which
charges Stickney's Restaurant
with unfair racial practices and
urges Stanford students to boy
cott the chain.
