# Letters To The Editor
## Shades of Ilene Strelitz! 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The article on the College
Young Republican convention in
Oakland in Tuesday's Daily was
evidence ol gross irresponsibility
in news judgment and editing on
several counts.
First, your re-write man cut
the submitted article to shreds,
and, in the process of condens
ing it in half, said that all "right
wing candidates" were defeated.
In point of fact, while the really
extreme candidates were de
feated, the sentiment at the con
vention was definitely conserva
tive, and a slate of responsible
but solid conservatives was
elected.
Furthermore, the condensation
missed the main news value of
the submitted article, which was
not Bob Naylor's election as state
treasurer, but the participation
of the Stanford delegation in the
general victory of responsible
and articulate conservatives.
Second, the article Was origi
nally to have been published
Monday, when the Bay Area
papers and both wire services
broke the story, but instead it
was shoved aside by an article
telling about a meeting to be
held Wednesday night to organ
ize the latest FSM-type group,
including among its members the
Daily editor and the GCC presi
dent. Would any other group
have got front-page publicity ad
vertising an organizational meet
ing. and two days in advance?
Third, the article that finally
did appear was buried on page
two in favor of a 16-inch article
on the front page telling about
a CORE demonstration at Stick
ncy's held "three weekends ago."
(Nowhere in the CORE article
was there even the implication
that Stanford or Stanford stu
dents were in any way involved.)
Is it the personal ideological
predelections of the editor which
are behind this disgraceful pol
icy? Shades of Ilene Strelitz!!

Editor, The Daily:
It is unfortunate that The
Daily did not attach more signifi
cance to the results of last Mon
day's IPC meeting. As criticisms
of certain fraternity practices
have become more vocal in the
last few weeks, most of the re
sponsible fraternity leaders have
become increasingly aware of
the need for an effective pro
gram of self-improvement.
At that meeting a clear voice
was posed. The IFC could unite

to fight improvement or it could
unite to fight for it. Fortunately
the latter view prevailed and a
very capable spokesman, Rob
Freeman, was chosen to imple
ment the plans.
Criticism has done its job. The
IFC is willing and its leadership
eager to institute the necessary
reforms. Whether they can re
mains to be seen. 1 think they
can. Freeman has appointed
Leith Anderson, Tom Cotton, Bill
Hendley, and Jeep Hardinge to ;
a special Inter-Fraternity Im
provement Commission w hi c h
will study specific problems and
issue specific suggestions (those
adopted as policy will be en
forced with possible suspension
of rush privileges).
Now is the time for those who
have criticized the system, both j
from within and from LASSU,
to allow th e m the "second ■
chance" they deserve.

Editor, The Daily:
Some people may feel that the
ideas behind Justin Beck's article
in Tuesday's Daily have merit.
However, agreement or disagree
ment with these ideas is not our!
concern in this letter.
As an editor of The Daily, Mr.!
Beck has certain responsibilities,
to his readers, responsibilities!
which he failed to fulfill in Tues-'
day's article. We find the air of
"sensationalism" in the article to
be most offensive. "Yellow jour
nalism" is an insult to the intelli

gence of The Daily's readers,
most of whom are Stanford stu
dents and alumni.
The gross analogy of S ta n
ford fraternities to the Ku Klux
Klan is not logical, (especially
since Sigma Chi has just been
suspended from ihe national for
pledging a Negro), nor is Mr.
Beck's parting remark, bluntly
stating that all fraternities are
cancerous organizations. The en
tire article appears not as in
telligently stated opinion but as
rashly stated prejudice. Wh en
a newspaper editor writes in
such a fashion, he is acting ir
responsibly in his position and
disdainfully toward hi s readers'
intelligence. Unless the article
was meant to be comic, Mr. Beck
and The Daily have no excuse for
its publication.

At that meeting a clear voice
was posed. The IFC could unite

to fight improvement or it could
unite to fight for it. Fortunately
the latter view prevailed and a
very capable spokesman, Rob
Freeman, was chosen to imple
ment the plans.
Criticism has done its job. The
IFC is willing and its leadership
eager to institute the necessary
reforms. Whether they can re
mains to be seen. 1 think they
can. Freeman has appointed
Leith Anderson, Tom Cotton, Bill
Hendley, and Jeep Hardinge to ;
a special Inter-Fraternity Im
provement Commission w hi c h
will study specific problems and
issue specific suggestions (those
adopted as policy will be en
forced with possible suspension
of rush privileges).
Now is the time for those who
have criticized the system, both j
from within and from LASSU,
to allow th e m the "second ■
chance" they deserve.

Editor, The Daily:
Some people may feel that the
ideas behind Justin Beck's article
in Tuesday's Daily have merit.
However, agreement or disagree
ment with these ideas is not our!
concern in this letter.
As an editor of The Daily, Mr.!
Beck has certain responsibilities,
to his readers, responsibilities!
which he failed to fulfill in Tues-'
day's article. We find the air of
"sensationalism" in the article to
be most offensive. "Yellow jour
nalism" is an insult to the intelli

gence of The Daily's readers,
most of whom are Stanford stu
dents and alumni.
The gross analogy of S ta n
ford fraternities to the Ku Klux
Klan is not logical, (especially
since Sigma Chi has just been
suspended from ihe national for
pledging a Negro), nor is Mr.
Beck's parting remark, bluntly
stating that all fraternities are
cancerous organizations. The en
tire article appears not as in
telligently stated opinion but as
rashly stated prejudice. Wh en
a newspaper editor writes in
such a fashion, he is acting ir
responsibly in his position and
disdainfully toward hi s readers'
intelligence. Unless the article
was meant to be comic, Mr. Beck
and The Daily have no excuse for
its publication.

LEGISLATURE'S EXECUTIVE
REFORM COMMITTEE
Editor, The Daily:
The article on the College
Young Republican convention in
Oakland in Tuesday's Daily was
evidence ol gross irresponsibility
in news judgment and editing on
several counts.
First, your re-write man cut
the submitted article to shreds,
and, in the process of condens
ing it in half, said that all "right
wing candidates" were defeated.
In point of fact, while the really
extreme candidates were de
feated, the sentiment at the con
vention was definitely conserva
tive, and a slate of responsible
but solid conservatives was
elected.
Furthermore, the condensation
missed the main news value of
the submitted article, which was
not Bob Naylor's election as state
treasurer, but the participation
of the Stanford delegation in the
general victory of responsible
and articulate conservatives.
Second, the article Was origi
nally to have been published
Monday, when the Bay Area
papers and both wire services
broke the story, but instead it
was shoved aside by an article
telling about a meeting to be
held Wednesday night to organ
ize the latest FSM-type group,
including among its members the
Daily editor and the GCC presi
dent. Would any other group
have got front-page publicity ad
vertising an organizational meet
ing. and two days in advance?
Third, the article that finally
did appear was buried on page
two in favor of a 16-inch article
on the front page telling about
a CORE demonstration at Stick
ncy's held "three weekends ago."
(Nowhere in the CORE article
was there even the implication
that Stanford or Stanford stu
dents were in any way involved.)
Is it the personal ideological
predelections of the editor which
are behind this disgraceful pol
icy? Shades of Ilene Strelitz!!

It is unfortunate that The
Daily did not attach more signifi

of certain fraternity practices
have become more vocal in the

sponsible fraternity leaders have
become increasingly aware of
the need for an effective pro

• Thanks Daily
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily is to be congratu
lated for its very fine coverage
of the work of the Legislature
throughout the year. Our com
mittee would like to particulars'
thank The Daily for its help in
publicizing the Constitutional
Amendments to reorganize the
Executive Branch which w ere
passed by the student body on
Tuesday. Your cooperation was
greatly appreciated.
LEGISLATURE'S EXECUTIVE
REFORM COMMITTEE
Editor, The Daily:
The article on the College
Young Republican convention in
Oakland in Tuesday's Daily was
evidence ol gross irresponsibility
in news judgment and editing on
several counts.
First, your re-write man cut
the submitted article to shreds,
and, in the process of condens
ing it in half, said that all "right
wing candidates" were defeated.
In point of fact, while the really
extreme candidates were de
feated, the sentiment at the con
vention was definitely conserva
tive, and a slate of responsible
but solid conservatives was
elected.
Furthermore, the condensation
missed the main news value of
the submitted article, which was
not Bob Naylor's election as state
treasurer, but the participation
of the Stanford delegation in the
general victory of responsible
and articulate conservatives.
Second, the article Was origi
nally to have been published
Monday, when the Bay Area
papers and both wire services
broke the story, but instead it
was shoved aside by an article
telling about a meeting to be
held Wednesday night to organ
ize the latest FSM-type group,
including among its members the
Daily editor and the GCC presi
dent. Would any other group
have got front-page publicity ad
vertising an organizational meet
ing. and two days in advance?
Third, the article that finally
did appear was buried on page
two in favor of a 16-inch article
on the front page telling about
a CORE demonstration at Stick
ncy's held "three weekends ago."
(Nowhere in the CORE article
was there even the implication
that Stanford or Stanford stu
dents were in any way involved.)
Is it the personal ideological
predelections of the editor which
are behind this disgraceful pol
icy? Shades of Ilene Strelitz!!

Editor, The Daily:
It is unfortunate that The
Daily did not attach more signifi
cance to the results of last Mon
day's IPC meeting. As criticisms
of certain fraternity practices
have become more vocal in the
last few weeks, most of the re
sponsible fraternity leaders have
become increasingly aware of
the need for an effective pro
gram of self-improvement.
At that meeting a clear voice
was posed. The IFC could unite

to fight improvement or it could
unite to fight for it. Fortunately
the latter view prevailed and a
very capable spokesman, Rob
Freeman, was chosen to imple
ment the plans.
Criticism has done its job. The
IFC is willing and its leadership
eager to institute the necessary
reforms. Whether they can re
mains to be seen. 1 think they
can. Freeman has appointed
Leith Anderson, Tom Cotton, Bill
Hendley, and Jeep Hardinge to ;
a special Inter-Fraternity Im
provement Commission w hi c h
will study specific problems and
issue specific suggestions (those
adopted as policy will be en
forced with possible suspension
of rush privileges).
Now is the time for those who
have criticized the system, both j
from within and from LASSU,
to allow th e m the "second ■
chance" they deserve.

Editor, The Daily:
Some people may feel that the
ideas behind Justin Beck's article
in Tuesday's Daily have merit.
However, agreement or disagree
ment with these ideas is not our!
concern in this letter.
As an editor of The Daily, Mr.!
Beck has certain responsibilities,
to his readers, responsibilities!
which he failed to fulfill in Tues-'
day's article. We find the air of
"sensationalism" in the article to
be most offensive. "Yellow jour
nalism" is an insult to the intelli

gence of The Daily's readers,
most of whom are Stanford stu
dents and alumni.
The gross analogy of S ta n
ford fraternities to the Ku Klux
Klan is not logical, (especially
since Sigma Chi has just been
suspended from ihe national for
pledging a Negro), nor is Mr.
Beck's parting remark, bluntly
stating that all fraternities are
cancerous organizations. The en
tire article appears not as in
telligently stated opinion but as
rashly stated prejudice. Wh en
a newspaper editor writes in
such a fashion, he is acting ir
responsibly in his position and
disdainfully toward hi s readers'
intelligence. Unless the article
was meant to be comic, Mr. Beck
and The Daily have no excuse for
its publication.
