# With Reform on the Creep, Can IFC Be Far Behind?
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
LASSU will be presented tonight with the opportunity to
demonstrate that its move for greater student autonomy on the
Stanford campus is motivated by a desire to exercise responsibil
ity, and not by a lust for power.
The issue of an investigation of fraternity' Fundamental Stan-

dard violations, unlike a topic
such as the Judicial Competence
Bill, does not deal with the divi
sion of control of student affairs
and conduct between the admin
istration and the students, but
rather with the rights of student
groups to maintain control over
their own activities.
In the past, when the fraterni
ties had neither the initiative nor
the desire to eliminate some of
their more blatantly repulsive
practices (let alone recognize that
something was amiss), the in
tervention of an outside group,
such as the Legislature, to fill
the void left by a weak Inter
fraternity Council would have
been justified.
But now, things are different.
New IFC President
Monday night the IFC, perhaps
with last Thursday's LASSU
meeting in mind, elected Hob
Freeman to its presidency - a
move somewhat akin to the Re
publicans nominating Jacob Ja
vits for the White House.
Within a half hour after the
meeting en d e d, Freeman ap
pointee! a special committee to
investigate fraternity Fun Stan
abuses, and directed the five mem
bers to report back Iheir find
ings and a set of positive, con
structive recommendations as
soon as possible.
This report, said Freeman, will
be "as open and as uninhibited
as possible," and will be released
to LASSU and the University
community, hopefully by mid-
May, and by the end of the quar
ter at the latest.
The committee, he added, has
already met twice.
There is the possibility, of
course, of a whitewash. It isn't
very likely, though, considering
the composition of the investiga
tory committee.
Disgruntled Gifeks
Leith Anderson, one of the dis
gruntled Greeks who wrote the
highly critical evaluation of fra
ternity life, "A Second Look,"
will chair the committee. Other
members are Rhodes scholar
Tom Cotton of Beta Chi, Jeep

Hardinge of SAE, Bill Henley of
Phi Kappa Sigma, and Dcke
Roger Mertz.
Mertz is the only "conservative"
on the committee; he was in
cluded to placate the more reac
tionary elements of the IFC, and
should be no threat to a thorough
investigation.
The question facing LASSU,
then, comes down to a choice be
tween commending Freeman and
the IFC for their initiative, or
! ignoring this maiden effort.
The Legislature could, if it
| wished, press for LASSU repre
sentation on the committee—a
sideswipe at the IFC at a time
i when a slap on the back would
j be more appropriate.
It could also, if it wished, re
quire a special report from the
i investigatory committee directly
: to LASSU before its release to the
j University community. Such a
! move would amount to a power
! play, on the part of the Legisla
| ture, to assert its opwer over a
body which, in reality, is not un
der its control. (The IFC is an
■ autonomous organization which
does not come under the ASSU
Constitution or By-Laws.) The
| resulting inter-student struggle
! would not do much for a student
! government which is trying its
damnedest to demonstrate its
"responsibility" to its elders.
Cancer Cure
The ideal solution would be to
keep the resolution from coming
' to a vote tonight. This could be
I done either by having the reso
i lution tabled permanently, or
! having the sponsor withdraw it
| from the floor.
Since, with the creation of
Freeman's investigatory commit
tee, the resolution is now super
fluous, either move would both
save LASSU from a disunifying
battle (with dubious legal results,
j should it pass), and be an ex
pression of support for tiie IFC's
initiative.
If the resolution goes through,
it would be euthanasia for a
cancel* patient that, hopefully, has
found a cure.

New IFC President
Monday night the IFC, perhaps
with last Thursday's LASSU
meeting in mind, elected Hob
Freeman to its presidency - a
move somewhat akin to the Re
publicans nominating Jacob Ja
vits for the White House.
Within a half hour after the
meeting en d e d, Freeman ap
pointee! a special committee to
investigate fraternity Fun Stan
abuses, and directed the five mem
bers to report back Iheir find
ings and a set of positive, con
structive recommendations as
soon as possible.
This report, said Freeman, will
be "as open and as uninhibited
as possible," and will be released
to LASSU and the University
community, hopefully by mid-
May, and by the end of the quar
ter at the latest.
The committee, he added, has
already met twice.
There is the possibility, of
course, of a whitewash. It isn't
very likely, though, considering
the composition of the investiga
tory committee.
Disgruntled Gifeks
Leith Anderson, one of the dis
gruntled Greeks who wrote the
highly critical evaluation of fra
ternity life, "A Second Look,"
will chair the committee. Other
members are Rhodes scholar
Tom Cotton of Beta Chi, Jeep

Hardinge of SAE, Bill Henley of
Phi Kappa Sigma, and Dcke
Roger Mertz.
Mertz is the only "conservative"
on the committee; he was in
cluded to placate the more reac
tionary elements of the IFC, and
should be no threat to a thorough
investigation.
The question facing LASSU,
then, comes down to a choice be
