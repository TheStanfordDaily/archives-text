# The 						Season of ASS Absurdity
## 
### ROBERT NAYLOR 
The season is come when
across the campus will echo anew
the peculiar rhetoric of the Cam
paigning Presidential Candidate,
pleading as he will for a "for
ward step" in the conduct of stu
dent government, a step toward
that great Utopia in which stu
dents will have a major voice in
all University policy.
It is time that the absurdity of,
these pleas for a greater role;
for student government be ex-!
posed; is there no one in th e j
Steve Gruber tradition to speak !
out on t he real issue of this cam-!
paign?
The first problem with greater j
involvement of student govern- j
ment in University policy is that i
the "issues" rarely interest stu
dents as a whole. Who will dedi-1

cato much effort to dealing say,
with the problems of housing,
course elevation, speaker sched
uling, organizational finance, or
amending student constitution
and by-laws?
There are a hearty few, to be
sure. Not enough to fill the
Legislature certainly not enough
to make for any competition for
posts in student government;
but there are always a few "stu
dent government types" the bu
reaucrats, er, administrators of
tomorrow.
Why Expand
Even conceding that there is
some role for student govern
ment (it does serve useful ad
ministrative and disciplinary
functions): does the traditional
lack of interest in its concerns

justify their expansion? Not logi
cally.
Associated with the lack of in- j
terest in student government—an
apathy which, if anything, demon
strates a wise discrimination on
the part of the average student
—is the almost total, but seldom
admitted, incompetence of the
Legislature.
Anyone who has ever attended
a LASSU meeting — free of the
limitations of 1 lie student bureau
cratic mentality - will testify
that discussion is shallow; that
many representatives have no j
knowledge of the issues, that or-:
ganized minorities with even j
the slightest knowledge of par
liamentary procedure can almost
always get t heir way, that the
legislative process is in fact al
most a joke.
These are not t he credentials j
of an organization to bo en- j
trusted with duties of any great-}
er import than it presently has, [
and the almost total indifference t
with which most students view
its actions should be a sign that i
its "representativeness" is a
sham and that greater power |
can be given it only with the most j
callous disregard for ihe dangers
of rule by militant and poten
tially destructive minorities.
Students and Faculty Unequal
Even if interest could be
aroused in educational and ad
ministrative issues, and if the
Legislature were a responsible
organization, who among the stu
dent body is qualified to deal!
with problems of budget, eurric-j
ulurn, planning- -even in an ad- j
visory capacity? Student govern
ment types universally fail to

recognize that students are just
not coequal with the faculty and j
administration, that they are in
ferior and therefore ought not j
to be trusted with important mat-;
ters, except as the faculty and
administration see fit.
But, it will be argued, you
should not take such a negative
attitude! You should discourage
apathy toward student govern
ment and encourage greater par-:
ticipation in this worthwhile or
ganization.
Irrelevant to Student
Ah, the final absurdity. In i
point of fact, student government •
(dare I say it> is hardly worth-j
while at all. It is irrelevant. Ir
relevant to the student's great
est concerns at Stanford; irrele
vant to those concerns which will
be important after he graduates.
Does anyone seriously believe
that participation in LASSU
really "prepares one to be an ef
fective citizen" later on? Pre
cinct work in elections, participa
tion in campus political organiza
tions, and work projects in Ti
juana and Hong Kong are in
finitely more effective. If stu
dents would spend as much time
using the rights they have in
reforming the world of adults, i
the result might be wondrous in- j
deed.
I will not deny that for the I
bureaucrat of tomorrow, or even
the student leader of tomorrow. j
there are jobs to be done. Per-'
haps we should be thankful that
there are a few of that peculiar i
breed. But certainly it would be
a mistake to give them any real j
power.
