# Measuring Movements of Earth
## 
### 
Ultra-sensitive measurements of surface land
movements —as litle as one-tenth the thick
ness of a human hair—are being recorded next
to a Stanford campus reservoir by Geology
Prof. Stanley N. Davis (right) and graduate

Frank Peterson. Vertical movements are meas
ured in well at right (covered to protect gauges
from temperature change) with electronic
readout equipment and thermometer in fore
ground.
