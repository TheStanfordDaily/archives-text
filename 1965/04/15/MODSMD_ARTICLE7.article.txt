## 
### 
President Wallace Sterling and ;
| many alumni rallied to the sup
port of the Sigma Chi's in their
effort to eliminate any de facto
discriminatory practices within
| the national fraternity.
j In a letter to chapter leaders,

I Sterling said the University's op
position to discriminatory prac
tices has been "unequivocally;
clear" since 1957, when the Board
of Trustees committed the Uni
versity to "work actively" with
student groups toward this end.

Sterling said the Sigma Ch i
National Executive Committee's
| decision to suspend temporarily
the local chapter's charter is "un
fortunate, but it in no way af
fects the University's position or
its support of the local chapter."
Sterling- Commends Chapter
He commended the chapter for
its "patience in exploring every
possible alternative from within
i the national fraternity" and "for
! following a procedure of close
! cooperation with the chapter ad
| visor, alumni, and appropriate
University officers."
In a wire to National Frater
; nity President Harry V. Wade
of Indianapolis, Senator Lee Met
j calf, Montana Democrat, urged
that the National Executive Com
| mittee's temporary suspension of
! the Stanford chapter "be re
| seinded and hearings held" on
| its charges against the local.
"Any other course may endan
i ger Sigma Chi on every campus
in America and bring our fra
ternity into national disrepute,"
Metcalf warned.
L.A. Attorney 'Shocked'
In a letter to Wade, another
i chapter alumnus, Los Angeles
! Attorney John L. Nourse said he
i was "shocked by the arbitrary
I manner in which the executive
committee acted and by its ap
parent disregard of those provi
| sions of the constitution and
'statutes of the fraternity which
; give any member accused of mis-
I conduct the right to a trial."
Members of the chapter have
| repeatedly expressed their de
sire to stay within the national
organization.
Chapter President Gary Kerns
said, "We intend to make every
I effort to resolve out differences
j within the framework of the na
tional fraternity. Wo appreciate
j the strong support already given
; us by several key alumni."
"Social Acceptability"
i Sigma Chi has no overt con
j stitutional clause involving racial
discrimination. However, it docs
! have a "social acceptability
j clause."
On February 1, the chapter in
j dicated it felt the national prac
ticed dc facto discrimination, and
j announced the local's intention to
I rush on a nondiscriminatory ba
j sis.
On April 2. the national exoeu
tivc committee suspended the
local for failure to "carry on the
j ritual, standards, and traditions
of the fraternity." Word of 11 ii>
