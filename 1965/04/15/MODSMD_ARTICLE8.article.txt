j searching for volunteers to go to
i South America this Juno.
! ACCION began in California
i 10 months before the Peace
Corps was established.
Since that time it has developed

in Venezula, encouraging audi
helping people to better their own |
communities while calling on gov-!

ment, and a nearly complete lack j

solution, leaving immediate prob
, lems unmet.

New Programs
This summer new programs are
starting in Argentina and Bra-;
zil. Consequently, the need fori
; 112 ieldworkers is three times as!
i great. Workers must be able to
(solve practical problems and
1 show a capacity for leadership,
; initiative, and imagination.
Speaking ability in Spanish is
not essential; technical skills are
helpful but not necessary. The;
minimum age is 20.
All North American partici
pants receive a two-week orienta
tion in the United States, then
join their Latin American coun*;
terparts in Caracas to begin an
intensive four month, infield
I training program.
Each fieldworker contracts to
, work for periods ranging from !
I 15 months to a lifetime career. I
Similar to Peace Corps volun-1
leers, each receives a salary pro
portioned to living expenses in;
the host country.
ACCION's (ioal
The goal of an ACCION field
worker is not simply to bring
about physical improvements. The
I essential purpose is to develop a
I sense of "community" which be
comes the living principle of so
cial, economic, and political re
j construction from Ihe bottom up.
t Volunteers prefer ACCION to

the Peace Corps because it is a !
smaller, more personal organiza- j
tion 150 people are now at work 1
in the field. Recruits feel that j
they will have more freedom on ;
the job and will be able to join
the community more easily be
cause they will not lie associated
willi the often-blemished U.S.
image abroad.

New Programs
This summer new programs are
starting in Argentina and Bra-;
zil. Consequently, the need fori
; 112 ieldworkers is three times as!
i great. Workers must be able to
(solve practical problems and
1 show a capacity for leadership,
; initiative, and imagination.
Speaking ability in Spanish is
not essential; technical skills are
helpful but not necessary. The;
minimum age is 20.
All North American partici
pants receive a two-week orienta
tion in the United States, then
join their Latin American coun*;
terparts in Caracas to begin an
intensive four month, infield
I training program.
Each fieldworker contracts to
, work for periods ranging from !
I 15 months to a lifetime career. I
Similar to Peace Corps volun-1
leers, each receives a salary pro
portioned to living expenses in;
the host country.
