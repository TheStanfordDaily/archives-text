# STERLING APPROVES SOCIAL REGS
## Trustees Hear Report; Regs Take Effect April 30 
### 
President Sterlting has approved the changes in women's social
regulations recommended by student committees. The new regula-1
tions go into effect on April 30.
On Thursday, April 15, President Sterling sent the followingl
statement to the Stanford Board of Trustees:
"l,ast fall I asked the Dean of Undergraduate Education to
make a study of women's social regulations, which would include
a review of those in effect at. Stanford and at other comparable
institutions, and to make such recommendations fur change in
Stanford's regulations as the result might indicate.
"This study was thoroughly carried out by the Associated
Women Students Social Regulations Committee acting on the re
quest of the President's Conimitte on Student Affairs and Services.
"As a result of this study, these two committees have unani
mously recommended certain changes in women's social regula
tions. I have approved these regulations and they will become!
effective April 30. The period !»etwecii now and the effective date
will afford time for tlk* implementation of the recommendations, i
and for communicating tlun in detail to the women students of
Stanford.
"The Committee oil Student Affairs and Services unanimously
recommended that the. new regulations he reviewe<l each spring
for the next three years. I welcome and approve this recommenda
tion also
"The new regulations are intended to place more responsibility
on the individual student. They are consistent with the housing
policy of a residential university, recognize the University's obliga
tion to provide for students' safety, and are in keeping with the j
Fundamental Standard, which has long governed student conduct
at Stanford.
"They permit increasing frwdom of decision as students de-'
velop from freshman to senior year and reflect the high level of
responsibility towards society and themselves already demontrated
by the overwhelming majority of Stanford students.
"In approving these changes, the University is expressing its
confidence in their maturity and good judgment."
The new regulations provide in part that:
• Junior and senior women will have the option of signing out I
lor 2:30 a.m. or for 6 a.m. the next morning. They will also have un
limited overnights.
• The closing hour for freshman dorms is extended to 12 p.m.
It was previously 10:30.
• Chaperones will no longer be required for overnights unless :
subject toASSU policy.
The new regulations were worked out by the AVVS Social liegu-j
lations Committee in conjunction with the LaSSU Special Commis-1
sion on Social Regulations.
Elizabeth Wall, chairman of the Commission, announced that ai
handbook explaining the new regulations would be handed out to all I
women as soon as possible. House meetings will also bo held to make '
certain that all women understand the new regulations.
The Presidential committee report noted that the extension in
freshman dormitory hours will make them correspond closely with j
library closing hours. It also w ill reduce the need for late leaves by j
freshmen who participate in social and cultural events on campus j
and in the surrounding communities.
In like manner, the extension of junior and senior late leaves, at
the option of the student, until as late as 6 a.m. will allow students
adequate time for returning from social and cultural events in the |
Bay Area, when use of an overnight leave would be inappropriate, l
or impossible. These changes in hours also will minimize the hazards ■
of students racing back to campus 1o meet a deadline.
A survey of 35 comparable institutions, conducted by the AWS
committee, showed 10 now permit upperclass women to sign out 1
overnight. These institutions include Oregon, Colorado, Northwest-!
em. Cornell, Washington (St. Louis). Antioch. Reed, Radcliffe,|
UCLA, and Miami (Ohio).
Originally phrased by Stanford's first president, David Starr Jor- j
dan, the Fundamental Standard says: "Students are expected to show j
both within and without the University such respect for order, mo- 1
rality, personal honor, and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. Failure to observe this will be sufficient cause for!
removal from the University."
