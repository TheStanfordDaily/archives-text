# LAST HOME MEET
## Track Squad Awaits WSU 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's track loam will per
' form al homo for the last time
i this season tomorrow, hosting a
talent-rich Washington State team
'at 1:30 p.m. in the Stadium. The
; strong Tribe 112 res linn an team hosts
J a three-way meet today, at 4 p.m.
i at Angell Field.
For the fourth straight week,
1 Stanford will lie dodging rain
clouds. Should heavy rain make
. it impossible to hold the meet to
morrow. plans are to postpone it
until Monday.
The very name Washington

Stale conjures up images of me
diocrity in sports, but Ihe Cou
gars have a 246-foot javelin
thrower, a 4:06 miler, a 14.3 hur
dler, a 9:02 two-miler, a 57-fool
plus pole vaulters.
That's class in any league. For
tunately Stanford has enough
depth to be favored by about 80-
65, but WSU cannot be taken
lightly. Last year the Indians
were favored to score 90 points
against the Cougars, but barely
won, 78-07.
Questad >lay Not Run
Stanford's best sprinter, Larry
Questad, is likely to see only lim
ited action tomorrow, having stif
fened a muscle last weekend in
the USC meet. Pole vaulter
Chuck Smith is still a doubtful
entrant.
The Cougars will probably take
an early lead in the meet on the
strength of their great field event
squad. Harald Lorentzon is fa
vored over Cards Boh Stoecker
and Bruce Wilhelm in the shot
put, and 6-8 high jumper Bob
Keppel should Win easily. The
broad jump duel between Stan
ford's Bud Walsh and WSlJ's Joe

| Wiggs promises lo ho exciting,!
! Walsh having a host leap only
j three-fourths of an inch hotter.
If Stanford coach Pay ton Jor
| clan decides not to run Paul j
I Schliekc in the mile, Cougar Vic
j Bennet (-1:06.9 best i will have an 1
icdge over Dave Deubner and |
; Harlan Andrews. Schlicke, Weym ;
Kirkland, and Cougar Chris West-'
man are the class of the Iwo-milo I
I field.
\\ r ith Questad nursing a sore
muscle, Eric Frische and Dale i
Rubin will bo counted on for first
j and third in both sprints. WStT's j
Dale Hickman has run 9.8 and i
run 21.6 for three straight weeks. I
Cougar Hurdler Injured
Cougar Bill Bleaknoy's time in '
the high hurdles, 14.3, is far
ahead of either Greg Ford or Bud
Walsh, but ho injured a leg last
week. The Stanford duel: should
go 1-2 in the intermediates.
Dave Deubner will try to avoid
a repeat of last week's 880, which
USC svvopt. But WSU has three j
men under 1:54.5. Should the;
j Cougars pick up big points there, j
tho moot could well go to the mile '
j relay, where Stanford has a five
j second margin in best times. The
,440 relay is unquestionably Stan-J
j ford's.
Since this is only tho second j
I dual moot between the teams, 10
or 12 meet records will probably I
fall.

The very name Washington

Stale conjures up images of me
diocrity in sports, but Ihe Cou
gars have a 246-foot javelin
thrower, a 4:06 miler, a 14.3 hur
dler, a 9:02 two-miler, a 57-fool
plus pole vaulters.
That's class in any league. For
tunately Stanford has enough
depth to be favored by about 80-
65, but WSU cannot be taken
lightly. Last year the Indians
were favored to score 90 points
against the Cougars, but barely
won, 78-07.
Questad >lay Not Run
Stanford's best sprinter, Larry
Questad, is likely to see only lim
ited action tomorrow, having stif
fened a muscle last weekend in
the USC meet. Pole vaulter
Chuck Smith is still a doubtful
entrant.
The Cougars will probably take
an early lead in the meet on the
strength of their great field event
squad. Harald Lorentzon is fa
vored over Cards Boh Stoecker
and Bruce Wilhelm in the shot
put, and 6-8 high jumper Bob
Keppel should Win easily. The
broad jump duel between Stan
ford's Bud Walsh and WSlJ's Joe

| Wiggs promises lo ho exciting,!
! Walsh having a host leap only
j three-fourths of an inch hotter.
If Stanford coach Pay ton Jor
| clan decides not to run Paul j
I Schliekc in the mile, Cougar Vic
j Bennet (-1:06.9 best i will have an 1
icdge over Dave Deubner and |
; Harlan Andrews. Schlicke, Weym ;
Kirkland, and Cougar Chris West-'
man are the class of the Iwo-milo I
I field.
\\ r ith Questad nursing a sore
muscle, Eric Frische and Dale i
Rubin will bo counted on for first
j and third in both sprints. WStT's j
Dale Hickman has run 9.8 and i
run 21.6 for three straight weeks. I
Cougar Hurdler Injured
Cougar Bill Bleaknoy's time in '
the high hurdles, 14.3, is far
ahead of either Greg Ford or Bud
Walsh, but ho injured a leg last
week. The Stanford duel: should
go 1-2 in the intermediates.
Dave Deubner will try to avoid
a repeat of last week's 880, which
USC svvopt. But WSU has three j
men under 1:54.5. Should the;
j Cougars pick up big points there, j
tho moot could well go to the mile '
j relay, where Stanford has a five
j second margin in best times. The
,440 relay is unquestionably Stan-J
j ford's.
Since this is only tho second j
I dual moot between the teams, 10
or 12 meet records will probably I
fall.
Stanford's track loam will per
' form al homo for the last time
i this season tomorrow, hosting a
talent-rich Washington State team
'at 1:30 p.m. in the Stadium. The
; strong Tribe 112 res linn an team hosts
J a three-way meet today, at 4 p.m.
i at Angell Field.
For the fourth straight week,
1 Stanford will lie dodging rain
clouds. Should heavy rain make
