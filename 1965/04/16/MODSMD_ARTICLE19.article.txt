According to the late Herbert Hoover, "Words
without actions are the assassins of idealism.
University students and teachers arc encour
aged to become experts with words. Professors,
in order to eat, must publish ad nauseam; stu
dents, for whom good grades mean good jobs,
develop logorrhea at the end of eveiy quarter.
Of course one does learn to distinguish between
verbiage and concise expression. One learns that
language is an effective means, perhaps the most
effective means, ol understanding human prob
lems.
But language is not always the most effective
means of solving those problems. Articulation of
solutions, however brilliant, does not equal imple
mentation of those solutions. As the National Stu
dent Association has pointed out, "The role of the
student involves a commitment to an educational
process that extends beyond classroom training.
Stanford recognizes that education must not
be limited to the classroom. But, not trusting stu
dents to determine their own development, the
I Diversity institutionalizes its efforts to produce
the "whole man." While paternalistic, general
studies requirements, including requirements for
activitiy credits, do at least indicate concern for
the entire educational process. And the future
may be brightened when academic credit is
granted for field work in the social sciences.
\\ hile Stanford does attempt to encourage stu
dents to go beyond their formal education, these

attempts currently represent little more than
tokenism. According to a 1963 statement of the
Board of Trustees, "Students are encouraged to
stuch', discuss, debate and become knowledgeable
about contemporary affairs. So much for words.
What about actions?
The Trustees' statement continues, " The expres
sing of opinions or taking of positions with respect
to these matters ... is not a function of student
government at Stanford.'
Stanford's student government, including one
legislator for every seventy-five students, is per
haps the most representative student government
in the country. As such, it is certainly qualified to
speak for its constituents. In recent months
LASSU has proved its responsibility and its re
sponsiveness to the best interests of the students
and the Stanford community in general. There is
no reason to believe that LASSU would not prove
itself equally capable were it to take positions in
the best interests of the Palo Alto community,
California, and the nation.
Not .only is the legislature qualified to take such
positions, it is obliged to take them. The society,
isolated from its scholars, languishes and dies.
Scholarship, divorced from the active implications
of schoralship, is sterile. Members of the Univer
sity community, including students, must be at
once dispassionate critics and active participants,
fulfilling their thought in action.
The learner and the citizen cannot be usefully
separated.

language is an effective means, perhaps the most
effective means, ol understanding human prob

But language is not always the most effective
means of solving those problems. Articulation of
solutions, however brilliant, does not equal imple
mentation of those solutions. As the National Stu
dent Association has pointed out, "The role of the
student involves a commitment to an educational
process that extends beyond classroom training.
Stanford recognizes that education must not
be limited to the classroom. But, not trusting stu

activitiy credits, do at least indicate concern for
the entire educational process. And the future

attempts currently represent little more than
tokenism. According to a 1963 statement of the
Board of Trustees, "Students are encouraged to

about contemporary affairs. So much for words.
What about actions?
The Trustees' statement continues, " The expres

to these matters ... is not a function of student
government at Stanford.'
Stanford's student government, including one
legislator for every seventy-five students, is per
haps the most representative student government
in the country. As such, it is certainly qualified to
speak for its constituents. In recent months
LASSU has proved its responsibility and its re
sponsiveness to the best interests of the students
and the Stanford community in general. There is
no reason to believe that LASSU would not prove
itself equally capable were it to take positions in
the best interests of the Palo Alto community,
California, and the nation.
Not .only is the legislature qualified to take such
positions, it is obliged to take them. The society,
isolated from its scholars, languishes and dies.
Scholarship, divorced from the active implications
of schoralship, is sterile. Members of the Univer
sity community, including students, must be at
once dispassionate critics and active participants,
fulfilling their thought in action.
The learner and the citizen cannot be usefully
separated.

without actions are the assassins of idealism.
