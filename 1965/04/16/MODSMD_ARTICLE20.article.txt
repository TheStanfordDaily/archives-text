# FROM THE FRINGE
## Amidst All the Brouhaha 
### ROGER MAGNUSON 
Amidst the* brouhaha generated recenth on campus about social
regulations and administrative control of the university, it may he
heartening to point out the universality of the problem—to demon
strate, perhaps, that such irritations flourish not only under the
palm fronds.
The time has come to reveal a similar (and highly secret) effort

to liberalize regulations at a great
Midwestern institution to prop
erly record the birth of an idea.
It began with a meaningful dia
logue in the lunchroom.
After the traditional comments
about the poor quality of the
food, one of the blue work-shirted
figures seated around the wooden
table laid down his fork and
cleared his throat.
"Who does the administration
think we are, anyway?" he said
angrily. "Don't they think we're
mature enough to run our own
lives, to handle the challenges
which we meet at this place?"
"If you ask me." said another
(and no one did), "these regs are
hindering rather than helping our
development; they're stultifying
our basically carefree (but ma
ture) spirits."
"Unlimited nine o'clocks, free
dom to participate in outside ac
tivities. to crusade, to fight the
fight for those ideals to which we
all aspire," added a bearded fel
low grandiloquently.
He waited for the concomitant
sighs of pleasure to cease. "The
reason they don't let us exercise
our basic rights," he said, "is that,
they simply don't realize Ihe con
tribution we make to society—in
the areas of civil disobedience,
non-violence, racial harmony. And
they don't like some of our plans
for redistribution of income."
"What it boils down to," he con
cluded, "is that the're afraid of
new ideas!"
"Yea," said a swarthy member
of the coterie, "what about the
'Bugsy Siegel Society for Civil
Disobedience' to which most of us
belong? Dare they say that that
isn't fully in keeping with the
Zeitgeist, that it isn't, in point of
fact, helpful to our society?"
"Our contribution to civil dis
obedience," added the oleaginous
one, acting as midwife. "We, like
Bugsy, never break 'good' laws,"

he explained for the sake of the
uninitiated, "and never respect
bad ones."
"You're not kidding," the swar
thy one said. "And what about
the 'Frank Nitty Non-violent Co
ordinating Committee (Fink)';
what single group can boast of a
more substantive contribution to
American society?"
"Our contribution to non-vio
lence," reminded the expert in
homiietics. "We, like Frank, nev
tr resort to violence. Unless, of
course, it's absolutely necessary."
"That's right," said the greaser,
pounding his palm upon the table.
"And, lest we forget, what about
the Secret and Mystic Brother
hood of Those Bent on Improving
Sicilian - Italian Relations (SAM
BO)? There lias been, to bo sure,
a little violence involved, but
we've come a long, long way."
"And we've a long, long way to
go," nodded another in agree
ment. "But I think, and I'm quite
sure the rest of you will agree,
that our most important contribu
tion has been in the area of in
come redistribution."
"Who among us, after all, has
taken from any but the filthy rich
and given to naught but the filthy
poor, namely us? Who, in point
of fact, has not caused a wonder
ful straightening of the Lorenz
curve!"
"But," he concluded, "although
we've been in the forefront of ac
tivism, they still don't seem to
want to trust us, to respect our
maturity, to bove us more outside
contact and activity, to lessen the
strict regulaions."
"It almost makes you think,"
said one, "that they regard us as
necessary evils."
The bell rang. The blue-shirted
figures arose from the tables with
new purpose. With, in short, the
cries and wails of a newly born
idea behind them.
And walked back to their cells.

he explained for the sake of the

"You're not kidding," the swar

"Our contribution to non-vio

"That's right," said the greaser,
pounding his palm upon the table.
"And, lest we forget, what about
the Secret and Mystic Brother

a little violence involved, but
we've come a long, long way."
"And we've a long, long way to

that our most important contribu

"But," he concluded, "although

The bell rang. The blue-shirted

The time has come to reveal a similar (and highly secret) effort

After the traditional comments
about the poor quality of the
food, one of the blue work-shirted

cleared his throat.
"Who does the administration
think we are, anyway?" he said
angrily. "Don't they think we're

which we meet at this place?"
"If you ask me." said another

"Unlimited nine o'clocks, free

all aspire," added a bearded fel
low grandiloquently.
He waited for the concomitant
sighs of pleasure to cease. "The
reason they don't let us exercise
our basic rights," he said, "is that,
they simply don't realize Ihe con

the areas of civil disobedience,
non-violence, racial harmony. And
they don't like some of our plans

"What it boils down to," he con
