## Integration Issue In Crucial School Board Election 
### 
Kilitor, Tile Daily:
This Tuesday, April 20. there is I
a very important election which !
is of concern to many in the Stan- i
ford Community . . . the Sequoia
Union School Board election. The i
issue is INTEGRATION of the \
high schools in the district spe
cifically, immediate action by the
school board to prevent Ravens- 1
wood High School, in East Palo I
Alto, from becoming a completely
segregated high school. The in-j
cumhents are all on record strong
ly supporting such action. The
three challengers have publicly
staled that they will do nothing to
prevent Ravenswood from becom
ing an all-Negro school.
A large voter turnout is abso
lutely necessary on Tuesday. If
tht three incumbents are not

elected, and any one of tho chal
lengers is (one of whom has the
active support of the far right in
the area), many of the programs
involving Stanford University's
attempts to enrich the educational
opportunities for the Ravenswood
students may be in,jeopardy.
A volunteer committee, includ
ing many Stanford students and
professors, has been formed to
work for the election of the in
cumbents. and to fight the segre
gationist policies of the challen
gers. Close to 50 of the most
promising precincts in the school
district have been worked inten
sively during the past week. Lit
erature has been distributed and
the voters are primed for the
election. What is needed now is a
MASSIVE GET OUT THE VOTE

DRIVE between 4 and 7 p.m. on
Tuesday. Walking lists are al
ready prepared. We need many
volunteers to walk the precincts—
transportation will be provided if
necessary. Call 327-3099 or 365-
2520 for more information. Vol
unteers will be assembling at 3,
4. and 5 p.m. at Engineering Cor
ner on Tuesday. April 20. Those
preferring can come directly to
the dispatching office, 1044 Betch
St., East Palo Alto.

Editor, The Daily:
Now you know, Bob. the way 1
see these "student government
types" isn't as "er, administrators

of tomorrow," but more like "re
formers of today." They all seem
to want to change things around
which does appear a bil pre
sumptuous, admittedly and they
all seem to have got the idea that
thoy can make tilings better than
they are now which does smack
of being visionary all right.
So, there's a pretty strong in
dictment against them, but. I
wanted to put in a good word. It
strikes me, you know, that maybe
one of the distinguishing charac
teristics of this bureaucracy you
talk about is just plain acceptance
of (you know the expression)
"the prevailing rationality."
That's the idea that you should
just fit in and do your chores.
It's not really apathy- more like
systematic humility: "who am I
to question why?" and that sort
of thing. Well, I guess you al
ready talked about that in your
column.
What I wanted to say is—well,
first, that I'm happy to see that
you're taking up where Steve
Gruber started and are maintain
ing his tradition of assent—-that
maybe these fellows aren't such
potential bureaucrats after all.
Seems as if they'll be damned be
fore they'll just fit in, and I don't
think they're going to wait
around for someone like you to
give them any power, either.
Seems to me that they may just
move outside normal channels
and find their own.

Editor, The Daily:
Nearly all posters announcing

a "Let's got out of Vietnam"
rally and walk to bo held Friday
noon in White Plaza have been
taken down from the kiosks on
campus.
We appeal to whoever is re
sponsible for removing them to
return them and to let us know
of his differences with us. Open
confrontation of those with dif
fering viewpoints is essential
both to democracy and to human
decency.
You cannot change our politics
or our actions by trying to deny
their existence. But we welcome
any challenge or criticism you
would care to offer either in
a public meeting or debate or in
private conversation.
Know, too, that basic to all of
our political philosophies, basic
to our protest of the war in Viet
nam, is a concern that individuals
be let live, and that thoy be let
determine the course of their
own lives. Though on a very dif
ferent level, it is our same con
cern here on campus that in
dividuals or groups, whatever
their political viewpoint, be let,
and even encouraged to, speak
without interference.
Again we welcome a chance to
discuss our differences. You can
get in touch with us by calling
Ingrid Jacobsen (323-9043) at
Union Residence or by leaving
a message for her there.

This Tuesday, April 20. there is I
a very important election which !
is of concern to many in the Stan- i
ford Community . . . the Sequoia
Union School Board election. The i
issue is INTEGRATION of the \
high schools in the district spe
cifically, immediate action by the
school board to prevent Ravens- 1
wood High School, in East Palo I
Alto, from becoming a completely
segregated high school. The in-j
cumhents are all on record strong
ly supporting such action. The
three challengers have publicly
staled that they will do nothing to
prevent Ravenswood from becom
ing an all-Negro school.
A large voter turnout is abso
lutely necessary on Tuesday. If
tht three incumbents are not

elected, and any one of tho chal
lengers is (one of whom has the
active support of the far right in
the area), many of the programs
involving Stanford University's
attempts to enrich the educational
opportunities for the Ravenswood
students may be in,jeopardy.
A volunteer committee, includ
ing many Stanford students and
professors, has been formed to
work for the election of the in
cumbents. and to fight the segre
gationist policies of the challen
gers. Close to 50 of the most
promising precincts in the school
district have been worked inten
sively during the past week. Lit
erature has been distributed and
the voters are primed for the
election. What is needed now is a
MASSIVE GET OUT THE VOTE

DRIVE between 4 and 7 p.m. on
Tuesday. Walking lists are al
ready prepared. We need many
volunteers to walk the precincts—
transportation will be provided if
necessary. Call 327-3099 or 365-
2520 for more information. Vol
unteers will be assembling at 3,
4. and 5 p.m. at Engineering Cor
ner on Tuesday. April 20. Those
preferring can come directly to
the dispatching office, 1044 Betch
St., East Palo Alto.

• You Know, Bob
Editor, The Daily:
Now you know, Bob. the way 1
see these "student government
types" isn't as "er, administrators

of tomorrow," but more like "re
formers of today." They all seem
to want to change things around
which does appear a bil pre
sumptuous, admittedly and they
all seem to have got the idea that
thoy can make tilings better than
they are now which does smack
of being visionary all right.
So, there's a pretty strong in
dictment against them, but. I
wanted to put in a good word. It
strikes me, you know, that maybe
one of the distinguishing charac
teristics of this bureaucracy you
talk about is just plain acceptance
of (you know the expression)
"the prevailing rationality."
That's the idea that you should
just fit in and do your chores.
It's not really apathy- more like
systematic humility: "who am I
to question why?" and that sort
of thing. Well, I guess you al
ready talked about that in your
column.
What I wanted to say is—well,
first, that I'm happy to see that
you're taking up where Steve
Gruber started and are maintain
ing his tradition of assent—-that
maybe these fellows aren't such
potential bureaucrats after all.
Seems as if they'll be damned be
fore they'll just fit in, and I don't
think they're going to wait
around for someone like you to
give them any power, either.
Seems to me that they may just
move outside normal channels
and find their own.

Nearly all posters announcing

a "Let's got out of Vietnam"
rally and walk to bo held Friday
noon in White Plaza have been
taken down from the kiosks on
campus.
We appeal to whoever is re
sponsible for removing them to
return them and to let us know
of his differences with us. Open
confrontation of those with dif
fering viewpoints is essential
both to democracy and to human
decency.
You cannot change our politics
or our actions by trying to deny
their existence. But we welcome
any challenge or criticism you
would care to offer either in
a public meeting or debate or in
private conversation.
Know, too, that basic to all of
our political philosophies, basic
to our protest of the war in Viet
nam, is a concern that individuals
be let live, and that thoy be let
determine the course of their
own lives. Though on a very dif
ferent level, it is our same con
cern here on campus that in
dividuals or groups, whatever
their political viewpoint, be let,

This Tuesday, April 20. there is I
a very important election which !
is of concern to many in the Stan- i
ford Community . . . the Sequoia
Union School Board election. The i
issue is INTEGRATION of the \
high schools in the district spe
cifically, immediate action by the
school board to prevent Ravens- 1
wood High School, in East Palo I
Alto, from becoming a completely
segregated high school. The in-j
cumhents are all on record strong
ly supporting such action. The
three challengers have publicly
staled that they will do nothing to
prevent Ravenswood from becom
ing an all-Negro school.
A large voter turnout is abso
lutely necessary on Tuesday. If
tht three incumbents are not

elected, and any one of tho chal
lengers is (one of whom has the
active support of the far right in
the area), many of the programs
involving Stanford University's
attempts to enrich the educational
opportunities for the Ravenswood
students may be in,jeopardy.
A volunteer committee, includ
ing many Stanford students and
professors, has been formed to
work for the election of the in
cumbents. and to fight the segre
gationist policies of the challen
gers. Close to 50 of the most
promising precincts in the school
district have been worked inten
sively during the past week. Lit
erature has been distributed and
the voters are primed for the
election. What is needed now is a
MASSIVE GET OUT THE VOTE

DRIVE between 4 and 7 p.m. on
Tuesday. Walking lists are al
ready prepared. We need many
volunteers to walk the precincts—
transportation will be provided if
necessary. Call 327-3099 or 365-
2520 for more information. Vol
unteers will be assembling at 3,
4. and 5 p.m. at Engineering Cor
ner on Tuesday. April 20. Those
preferring can come directly to
the dispatching office, 1044 Betch
St., East Palo Alto.

• You Know, Bob
Editor, The Daily:
Now you know, Bob. the way 1
see these "student government
types" isn't as "er, administrators

of tomorrow," but more like "re
formers of today." They all seem
to want to change things around
which does appear a bil pre
sumptuous, admittedly and they
all seem to have got the idea that
thoy can make tilings better than
they are now which does smack
of being visionary all right.
So, there's a pretty strong in
dictment against them, but. I
wanted to put in a good word. It
strikes me, you know, that maybe
one of the distinguishing charac
teristics of this bureaucracy you
talk about is just plain acceptance
of (you know the expression)
"the prevailing rationality."
That's the idea that you should
just fit in and do your chores.
It's not really apathy- more like
systematic humility: "who am I
to question why?" and that sort
of thing. Well, I guess you al
ready talked about that in your
column.
What I wanted to say is—well,
first, that I'm happy to see that
you're taking up where Steve
Gruber started and are maintain
ing his tradition of assent—-that
maybe these fellows aren't such
potential bureaucrats after all.
Seems as if they'll be damned be
fore they'll just fit in, and I don't
think they're going to wait
around for someone like you to
give them any power, either.
Seems to me that they may just
move outside normal channels
and find their own.

Editor, The Daily:
Nearly all posters announcing

a "Let's got out of Vietnam"
rally and walk to bo held Friday
noon in White Plaza have been
taken down from the kiosks on
campus.
We appeal to whoever is re
sponsible for removing them to
return them and to let us know
of his differences with us. Open
confrontation of those with dif
fering viewpoints is essential
both to democracy and to human
decency.
You cannot change our politics
or our actions by trying to deny
their existence. But we welcome
any challenge or criticism you
would care to offer either in
a public meeting or debate or in
private conversation.
Know, too, that basic to all of
our political philosophies, basic
to our protest of the war in Viet
nam, is a concern that individuals
be let live, and that thoy be let
determine the course of their
own lives. Though on a very dif
ferent level, it is our same con
cern here on campus that in
dividuals or groups, whatever
their political viewpoint, be let,
and even encouraged to, speak
without interference.
