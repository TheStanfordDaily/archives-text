# Don't Be a Conformist
## 
### 
Why conform to a decadent, dying world.*' Isn't lile more
than tract homes and ;i color T\ set r Shouldn't success be more
than two cars in the garage and a summer home in the moun
tains? Isn't there more to life that keeping up with the Joneses
and going along with the crowd?
(iod, too, is against (Irabu ess and staleness and conformity—
that sterile sameness which reduces men to robots, and life to
mere drudgery. Xor is the alternative to conformity revolution.
It comes as a surprise to mail) to learn that Jesus Christ is
against rules and regulations, ritual and ceremony, conformity
and emptiness. Ile is the ()ne who said. "I am come that they
might have life and that more abundantly" (John 10:10).
It is a paradox, but nevertheless a fact, that a person becomes
free only when he yields the throne of his life to the I -ordship of
Jesus Christ. Although designed to he king over the kingdom of
our own life, each of us is a servant of sin. and unseen powers of
evil, until we individually ask Jesus Christ to set us free. ("If
the Son shall make you free you will be free indeed"— John
8:36).
Entrusting one's life to the Mastery of Christ releases man
to be all that his Creator has intended him to he. All that has been
built into us can onlv be released and unlocked and unfolded as
we seek the. power of the Lord Jesus Christ, for I le is the Key
to Life.
I )on'l he a conformist! Let God transform your life. "... < live
Jesus Christ your bodies, as a living sacrifice, consecrated to
Mini and acceptable to Hint. Don't let the world around you
i squeeze you into its own mold, but let (iod remold your minds
from within, so that von mav prove in practice that the plan of
God for you is good, meets all His demands and moves toward
the goal of true maturity" (Romans 12:1.2 Phillips).
