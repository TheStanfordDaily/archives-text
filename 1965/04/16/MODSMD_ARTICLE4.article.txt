## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
A new undergraduate program
in creative development, featur
ing small-group seminars, re
search, and perhaps a few new
publications, will Ix* offered lo
next September's incoming class.
Some 200 to 250 entering fresh
men will be given the opportunity
to join seminars of from six to
eight students, under the direction
of professors or advanced grad
uate students. to conduct intensive
research, engage in cross-depart
mental inquiry, or to study in
depth some single problem, idea,
or author.
The program was announced
Tuesday evening by Albert J.
Guerard. professor of English and
chairman of a faculty committee
which devised the plan.
( HALLKXCiIN<i SITUATION
The aim of the program, ac
cording to the committee, is to
"place the freshman in an intellec
tually challenging situation, with
objectivies more unusual and per
haps more complex than those in
thet standard freshman courses."
The seminars will extend over
two quarters some autumn- win
ter, the rest winter-spring and
will offer three units of credit per
quarter.
."The fall-winter group," said
Guerard, "will be randomly
chosen from those who apply for
the program. A somewhat smaller
group, chosen on the basis of rec
ommendations by fall quarter in
structors or sponsors, will be of
fered the winter-spring sequence."
ALL DEPARTMENT
PARTICIPATION
All departments will probably
participate in the program, for
which specific seminar and re
search topics are yet to be chosen.
As part of the program, $3,300
will be provided for subsidizing
a variety of new. and perhaps
experimental undergraduate pub
lications.
The program, according to Gue
rard. is designed to launch the tal
ented freshman directly into the
advanced intellectual life of the
University.
