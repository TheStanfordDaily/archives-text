### STEVE LEOPOLD SUSAN WICKZER 
Implementation of the new w omen's social regulations was post
poned until April 30 with the unanimous approval of the Legislature
last night.
At the same time, all but two of the 125-odd representatives pres
ent concurred with a request by ASSU President Scott Mcßride to

postpone indefinitely a LegislaH
lure - sponsored investigation of i
fraternity initiation procedures.
In the discussion of new busi
ness. the Legislature passed a
resolution reactivating the Com
mittee of Fifteen, composed of
five members each from students
and administration, to discuss [
changes in the university's policy
toward liquor.
The Legislature also approved
a resolution directing the By-laws
Committe to consider legislation
on the power of LASSU to speak
on off-campus issues. It also calls
for the Committee of Fifteen or
ganization to be used in discus
sion of University policy on this
matter.
In other action, the Legislature
tabled a resolution which con
demned the racial discrimina
tion evidenced in the hiring prac
tices of Stickney's restaurants."
Sponsored by Thomas Rado, Rod
Sangster. and Ira Arlook, the res- j
olution also urged all students to
refrain from patronizing 1 he res
taurants until the racial discrimi
nation had ceased.
Elizabeth Wall, chairman of the
special ASSU commission for the'
implementation of social regula-1
tions, moved that implementation
be postponed in accordance with
President Wallace Sterling's
statement to the Board of Trus-j
tees for the following reasons:
• Time was needed to complete
the writing, typing, and distribu
tion of approximately 1700 six- <
page copies of the new social reg
ulations.
• The AWS Social Regulations;
Committee has to meet the direc
tors and Resident Assistants of
the women's living groups, as
well as hold two general meetings
in each living quarters to explain
the procedures that will he fol
lowed.
• The AWS Social Regulations
Committee also wishes to meet |
with the women's judicial organi
zations to insure their under
standing of the new rules.
In moving the indefinite post
ponement of the proposed LAS-;
SU investigation of fraternity in
itiation procedures, Mcßride not
ed that the Inter-Fraternity Coun- 1

til (IFO had elected new officers
Monday and had established an
investigating committee which
would make a public report by
May 15.
Leitli Anderson, chairman of
the IFC investigating committee,
assured the Legislature that his
committee would report on ini
tiation proceedings and the meth
ods of integrating pledges into
the houses, and that the commit
tee would make any recommen
dations necessary to a general
session of the IFC.
Speaker of the Legislature Ed
Shaw told The Daily that the
"election of the IFC officers and
their subsequent actions indicat
ed that for the first time the fra
ternity system was ready to ad
vance from internal direction.
With this in mind, I believe that
the Legislature was taking cogni
zance of its role in the university
community by postponing any ac
tion pending IFC investigations."
With five dissenting votes, the
Legislature passed a resolution to
send Adrian Stickney a leter in
viting him to come before LASSU
next week to discuss the issues
surrounding the charges of racial
discrimination.
In other action the Legislature
voted to:
• Change the responsibility of
paying the Student Police from
the individual organization re
quiring them, to the ASSU budg
et.
• Make minor changes in the
editorial salaries of the Quad.
• Make the now-voluntary Ov
erseas Campus Alumni Board into
an official ASSU organization.
• Make the Speaker of the
House an official delegate to the
NSA convention in place of the
Daily Editor.
• Remove the constitutional
requirement that the Speaker of
the House be elected in the Fall.
LASSU passed with ten dis
senting votes a resolution asking
the Student Affairs and Services
Committee to return the responsi
bility of registering voluntary
groups because it believed regis
tration to be unnecessary.
