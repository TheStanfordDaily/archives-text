Thou Shalt Love
Je.su?- Christ was once asked by a lawyer, " I eaclier, which is the
greatest commandment in the law?" To this question our Lord replied.
"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all
your soul, and with all your mind. Phis is the great and first command
ment. And ;i second is like it. You shall love your neighbor as yourself.
On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets (Mat
thew 22:35-40>.
Now love can not be commanded. Kither you love someone or you do
not; either you are concerned or you are not. Indeed, most everyone
would agree that loving one's neighbor as oneself would solve most hu
man problems, but can love really I"' generated by (iod s commandment
to love Mini wholeheartedly, and one > neighbor as oneself :
The commandments of God's I .aw, which reveal I lis standards and
character, do not serve to produce a response of love in the human heart,
hut rather show man his deepest need and greatest inadequacies: "Now
we know that whatsoever things the Law saitli, it saith to them who are
under the Law : that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may
become guilty before God. Therefore by the deeds of the Law there shalj
no flesh be justified in 1 lis sight : for the Law is the knowledge of sin"
(Romans 3:19, 20).
The astute and the wise can immediately see that the commandments
"Thou shalt love" are designed to awaken us so that we see ourselves
as God sees us, and to establish a personal relationship with llim. Thus,
"the Law was our schoolmaster to bring us to (. hrist (Galatians 3:24).
The Apostle John further clarified this issue when he wrote, "Herein is
love, not that we loved God. but that He loved lis and sent His Son to
be the propitiation for our sins" (I John 4:10).
Only by accepting the gift of God's love (Jesus Christ) does one have
the resources necessary to love (iod and his own neighbor. As John con
tinues, "Beloved let lis love one another; for love is of God and he who
loves is born of God and knows God (I John 4:/).
Indeed, the unselfish, self-giving love of God is the answer to every
human problem. Discover this for yourself by inviting Jesus Christ into
your life. "Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides
in him, and he in God .. . (nil is love. (I John 4:15).
