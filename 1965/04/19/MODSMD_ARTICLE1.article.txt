• Fulbright Asks Bombing Halt
WASHINGTON—Taking issue with Secre
tary of State Rusk, Sen. J. W. Fulbright,
D-Ark., said yesterday a temporary halt in air
strikes against North Viet Nam might open
the way to peace negotiations.
Rusk said in a statement Saturday the ad
ministration has considered and rejected the
idea of suspending air raids against North
Viet Nam because such action "would only en
courage the aggressor and dishearten our
friends who bear the brunt of battle."
Fulbright, who heads the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said he does not relish
differing with the Secretary but believes that
bombings may cause the North Vietnamese to
"dig in" and the Russians to decline to talk so
long as they continue.

In a plea clearly aimed at the conflict in
Viet Nam, he urged a negotiated end to "every
war and guerrilla operation."
"May the day come," he said, "on which

the discords among peoples will be resolved
not only with the force of arms, but rather in
the light of reasonable negotiations, and let
every war and guerrilla operation give way
to constructive collaboration which is mutual
and fraternal."

JAKARTA, Indonesia —U.S. policy in Viet

Sunday in a general African-Asian verbal
broadside delivered against imperialism, co
lonialism and neocolonialism at the 10th anni
versary celebration of the Bandung confer
ence.
At a public ceremony in a ports hall filled
with 5,000 people, Indonesian President Su

the Americans is to withdraw and "let the
Vietnamese people solve their problem."

Thousands of workers piled sandbags and
kept a round-the-clock vigil at dikes along the
Mississippi River from the Twin Cities in
Minnesota to Cairo, 111., yesterday as icy, high
water menaced levees.
But in some areas the flood threat abated.
The U.S. Weather Bureau said the Missis
sippi—north of St. Louis, Mo., in the Quincy,
111., and Hannibal, Mo., areas—fell in the last

land Saturday night.

to growers of $48 million annually.
