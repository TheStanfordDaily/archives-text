ment.

tions Commission Chairman John

MacKenzie-Brown
Presidential aspirant Sandy
MacKenzie and V-P contender
Clark Brown, in outlining their
platform, said, "Student govern
ment concerns with University
policy changes are critical and,
should he the primary area of j
concern to the Legislature. We i
feel that academic concerns are ,
central to the University and
should be central to the execu-1
tive branch ot student govern-1
ment especially.
"Essential to viable student
government is increased partici
| pation in the decision-making
process by students on all levels j
—students serving on all relevant |
administration and faculty com- j
mittees and in student govern- j
ment are a means whereby stu-|
dents who are not ASSU offi- j
cers or legislators can influence
policy and initiate programs in
j areas of particular concern toi
! them, such as library and curri
j cular reforms."
Magnuson-Soule
According to ASSU Presidential
| candidate Roger Magnuson, run
! ning with George Soule, "Stu- ;
dents must realize that student
government is one of the great
est inventions since depilatiories."
! In revealing the platform for his
("front porch" campaign, candi-;
i date Magnuson coined the slo- j
gans, "Let us reason together, ;
amibivalently," and, "Manus
manum labat," in support of his
i program of "student government
; run by convival ambiverts."
Magnuson's platform c i t e s

three items he considers signifi
cant to student life:
• Students are mostly sanitary
but sometimes alienated.
• Off-campus issues For
what purpose do students elect
student leaders to serve in stu
| dent government unless to arti
culate opinions on off-campus
! issues? But they must be rele
j vanl issues: like cock-fighting.
• Those students who desire
[ should be made professors emeriti
lso that they can drink in the
I Faculty Club,
Uuhhins-.Morse
Dave Robbins, presidential can
didate, and Frank Morse, candi
date for vice president, base their
platform on a program of in
creased involvement in student
government through "a less
monolithic legislative and execu
tive structure." Their proposals
for implementing this program
include the revitalization of the
executive branch with the addi
tion of a five-man cabinet to co
ordinate student committees and
act in an advisory capacity to
the president.
They do not believe that under
the present representative sys
tem that LASSU would be speak
ing on off-campus issues in such
a way as to represent the entire
student body.
Sliaw-SorenscMi
In announcing their platforms,
Ed Shaw, running for President,
i and Doug Sorensen, running for
Vice-President, emphasize a con
tinuation of "the students' rights
to judicial process hard won this
I year." More specifically, Shaw
j and Sorensen urge maintenance
and improvement of the new So
-1 eial Regulations just passed,
; strengthening the authority of the
j 1.F.C., and a closer coordination
I of students and faculty in policy
determination. "We've been work
ing for you this year, we want to
: work next year, too," the candi
dates stated.
The candidates' meal schedules
as determined thus far are:
Monday lunch:

Clark Brown, in outlining their
