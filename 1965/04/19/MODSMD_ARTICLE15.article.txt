# COACH CONDON CHRISTENED...
## Stanford Crews Sweep 
### 
Stanford's three crews coasted
to victory Saturday, in an auspi
cious initiation of Will Condon as
new varsity coach. Hosting Ore
gon Stale, Southern California,
and San Diego State on their Red
wood City course, the Indian var
sity and junior varsity oarsmen
finished with a comfortable l:ii
length margin over the nearest
shell. The frosh finished 1 1 2
lengths in front.
Varsity cox Gene Hermitte, a

I junior, guided his boat manned by I
1 five juniors and three sophomores
I across the 2000-meter course in
six minutes and 18 seconds. San
j Diego State was the nearest eon
tender in 6:24.8, nudging out Or
! egon State by one second.
With Hermitte in the first boat
were stroke Steve Parker, 7-man
[Larry Hough (captain), 6-man
, Dave Robbins, ~>-man Tim Cowles,
1 4-man Larry McBride, 3-man Dick
| Herzog, 2-man Bill Stump, and
bow-man Leeds Disston.
OSU Second in JV
Oregon State took second place
in the JV and Frosh competition,
and USC managed dead last in
every heat. San Diego State
brought only a varsity boat, com
ing two days in advance to work
out on the course.
Because of recent bad weather.

the Indian crow has nol boon able
to have a complete workout in
quite a while, only working on
starts and sprints. The work ap
parently paid off, as all three
boats jumped out to early leads i
which they hold all the way.
Spirits were high around the:
Stanford boat house and some op- j
limism towards next week's race
against Coast crew powerhouse |
California. Coach Condon, how- j
ever, was reticent about his;
crew's chances against the Bears, j
pointing out that Cal beat San
Diego State earlier in the season ,
by 16 seconds, compared to Stan- i
ford's six. Certainly the Indian i
oarsmen will not be able to run [
the low-stroke races they ran Sat- j
urday if they are to usurp the j
Bears for the first time since
1957.
