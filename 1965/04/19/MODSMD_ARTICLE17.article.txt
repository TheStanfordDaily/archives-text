## 
### TOM EDISON 
Absence makes the heart grow
fonder but for the Stanford la
crosse team absence made the
team flounder. The Indians were
trampled by the Palo Alto La
crosse Club. Saturday, 10-5. Stan
ford played without three of its
top performers.
Pete Eakland scored all but one
of Stanford's goals. Stanford's in
itial score came from Doug Ram
say on an assist by Glenn Thorn
as.
The Palo Alto squad, comprised
mostly of former Stanford la
crosse players, got off with a
quick 2-0 lead with only two min
utes of play and soared to a 4-0
lead before the end of the first
quarter.
Stanford tightened up its de
fense while loosening up on of
fense in the second quarter and
came within two points of the
Palo Alto squad, 5-3.
However, most of Stanford's
scores came on slop shots and the
Indians never reached the style of
play that they revealed last week
end against the Marines.
Margin Cut
In the second half Ihe Palo
Alio team again led by four
points, 7-3, on a shot by Wynn
Peterson. Two flicks with the
stick by Stanford's Pete Eakland
whittled ihe lead to two points
but the town team put away three
straight scores in the final min
utes of the contest to win, 10-5.
Next weekend the Stanford
squad plays the University of
California here. This is the first
year for lacrosse at Cal.
