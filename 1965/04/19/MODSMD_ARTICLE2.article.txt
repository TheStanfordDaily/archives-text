# Box 7885 Where Are You?
## 
### 
Bureaucracy lias again sa
botaged The Daily and ruined
the life ol' an innocent vic
tim. Due to a lack oi' commu
nication between members of
tbe foil Home Hydrot'ollies
Committee, The Daily is
forced to print a retraction of
a retraction.
Dii Thursday The Daily an
nounced that llydrofollies en
trants must send a fee of one
dollar to Stanford Box 7885.
On Friday we were informed
by another member of the
Committee, and d 111 if nil y
printed, that there was no
entry fee and that fÂ«ul play
was afoot. Since Friday, the
Committee has gotten its two
heads together and decided
that there IS an entry fee of
one dollar and it IS to be sent
to Box 7885.
Further details could not be
uncovered. The whereabouts
of the owner of Box 7885 are
unknown. It is believed that
after the inference in Friday's
Daily that Hydrot'ollies en
trants were being duped, the
innocent owner, fearing that
he might be considered a
crook and have to face a
Gestapo-like- visit from Cap
tain Midnight, may have fled
the campus.
The Daily can only express
its regret at the inconven
ience which has been caused
and plead for the owner of
Box 7885 to please come back.
AI so The Daily has been in
formed that the Hydrot'ollies
committee is drowning: they
need a boat for their water
skiing show on April 25. If
you can help, call Ken Majer
at 321-2472.
