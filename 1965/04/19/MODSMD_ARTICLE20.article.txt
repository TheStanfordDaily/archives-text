# Letters To The Editor
## News, Si; Grapevine, No 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily's decision to publish
another "Roundup of Rumors and
Rumblings" contrasts s tar k 1 y
with its repeated failure in recent
weeks to provide timely, on-the
spot news coverage of what the
trade calls hard news — state
ments of fact and opinion by such
groups as the Committee on Uni
versity Policy, the Advisory
Board, the President's Committee
on Judicial Procedure, and even
the Student Legislature, on oc
casion.
Events ranging from a Tuesday
Evening Series lecture to Robert
McAfee Brown's talk on fair hous
ing (which was postponed once
for lack of any advance mention
in The Daily) have suffered from
the more routine shortcomings of
advance publicity.
Blame for much of this can
be traced to the usual faults of
any human organization, which in
The Daily's case are complicated
by severe shortages of funds and
news space.
Those who believe deeply in the

editorial freedom of student news
| papers, as I do, must be equally
i concerned about its responsible
j exercise.
Rushing the campus grapevine
; into print is a poor substitute for
: trying to dig out confirmed facts
;or expressing individual views,
however unpalatable they may be
jto others.
Editors who do so are in a poor
; position to complain about "The
Pygmies to the North" (The
i Chronicle and The Examiner) or
: complain about inaccurate cover
i age of campus developments by
the Bay Area press, as your pre
decessors and contemporaries
| have done.

• Thanks, Dr. Sterling
Editor, The Daily:
Having worked long and hard
' to see a new system of social reg
! ulations be approved and made
! effective, the AWS Social Regula
tions Committee would like to ac

knowledge at this time the assist
ance of the University adminis
tration. The success of our com
mittee's work reflects the great
amount of participation by all
concerned members of the Uni
versity Community, and further
more, demonstrates the effective
student-administration coopera
tion in achieving his end.
Rapid approval of these regula
tions by President Sterling and
the Committee on Student Affairs
and Services emphasizes the good
faith of the University adminis
tration and its confidence in re
sponsible student action.
It is our hope that such associ
ation will continue to be fruitful
'and that further avenues of com
munication will be opened.
