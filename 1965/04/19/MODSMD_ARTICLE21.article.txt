# An African Looks at the Congo

### URIAH CHINWAH (First in a Series 
It is from here the light
shines forth which for mil
lions of men still plunged in
barbarism will be the dawn of
a better era. . . . Our cities
are gorged with the products
of the most diverse indus
tries; nowhere will they find
so great a market to absorb
them. The most intelligent of
our youth demand wider hori
zons oil which to expend their
abounding energy. Our work
ing population will derive
from the virgin regions of Af
rica new sources of prosper
ity and render more in ex
change.
These were 1 he words spoken
by that daring and visionary
adventurer, King Leopold II of
the Belgians, on his acquisition

of the Congo "Free" State as a
personal property. This was to
wards the close of ihe nine
teenth century; the last pieces
of land were being divided up
amongst various European pow
ers, and Leopold, through un
usual genius and dexterity, had
managed to carve out a fairly
extensive and potentially rich
territory for himself. As his
chronicler put it, "for one man
to have acquired all this (the
Congo) without the use of
force, entirely by his own
means, with no support from
his country and in competition
with far more powerful rivals,
was an almost incredible feat,
which only the possession by
Leopold of extraordinary quali
ties could explain."
Today Africa glances back
over the brief span of history,
and wonders about Leopold and
Belgium. Were the noble senti
ments about improving the lot

Editor's nolo: The following
article, the first of a series by
Stanford student Uriah Chin

of an alien culture into Africa,

Africa today. It is the first in

of the natives ever really put
into action? Was Leopold's
opening speech merely a cool
ant for soothing his—and the
rest of the colonizing world's
conscience as to the propriety
of his actions, if such soothing
were possible?
Virgin Africa
Today, what is disconcerting
to the African is not so much
that a man from across the

seas could have had the effront
ery to acquire, with the consent
of the great powers of the day,
vast tracts of African land as
personal property hut that ben
efits which accrued from Bel
gian incursion into the Congo
were incident; 1 .! rather than de
liberate. Hence, it would ap
pear to the African that Leo
pold's emphasis was on Bel
gium's "deriving from the vir
gin regions of Africa new
sources of prosperity . . ." and
not on "rendering more in ex
change."
Shining Zeal
On the happier side, we have
the incidental benefits previous
ly mentioned. With the opening
up of a new land came a wave
of people of all shades of color
and intentions. The best ele
ments were obviously the mis
sionaries w hose zeal shone
forth clearly and steadfastly.
The keenly perceptive African
was not slow to realize that this
was a different kind of man.
To sum up the history with
which most of us are familiar,
certain violent practices gradu
ally faded away from the na
tives' customs; schools, church
es, and health centers sprang
up. For some it really was the
dawn of a better era, spear
headed not by colonizing forces
but by people with mystical
and spiritual convictions. Gov
ernmental machinery set up by
the colonists <1 id help in pre
serving order and, especially, in
restoring some sanity to a

world gone berserk with t he
slave trade. Missionaries re
ceived the full support of such
machinery and therefore did
more efficient work. The colo
nists were not slow to see that
the missions could also serve
their own ends. Trade did pros
per, lines of communication
were established, cities sprang
up, and men with various valu
able technical skills and other
useful knowledge came into tHe
country.
The Congo Playground
Thus Leopold did serve some
useful ends in the Congo, even
if indirectly. What if he had
not come to the Congo? Would
other powers not have .seized it
and split up the shares? This
does not mean, however, that
we close our eyes to the impro
prieties of one man just be
cause during the time he lived
impropriety was fashionable.
With his extraordinary powers,
Leopold could easily have set
the native and the Congo well
on the road to meaningful in
dependence. With his vision, he
could have discerned that a
state of exploitation could not
continue for too long without
calling into play violent and ir
repressible forces.
I lis chronicler, perhaps by ac
cident. presented the balance
sheet in the following words:
"If the Belgian capital is the
splendid city we see today, it is
largely thanks to Leopold—and
the Congo."

Virgin Africa
Today, what is disconcerting
to the African is not so much
that a man from across the

seas could have had the effront
ery to acquire, with the consent
of the great powers of the day,
vast tracts of African land as
personal property hut that ben
efits which accrued from Bel
gian incursion into the Congo
were incident; 1 .! rather than de
liberate. Hence, it would ap
pear to the African that Leo
pold's emphasis was on Bel
gium's "deriving from the vir
gin regions of Africa new
sources of prosperity . . ." and
not on "rendering more in ex
change."
Shining Zeal
On the happier side, we have
the incidental benefits previous
ly mentioned. With the opening
up of a new land came a wave
of people of all shades of color
and intentions. The best ele
ments were obviously the mis
sionaries w hose zeal shone
forth clearly and steadfastly.
The keenly perceptive African
was not slow to realize that this
was a different kind of man.
To sum up the history with
which most of us are familiar,
certain violent practices gradu
ally faded away from the na
tives' customs; schools, church
es, and health centers sprang
up. For some it really was the
dawn of a better era, spear
headed not by colonizing forces
but by people with mystical
and spiritual convictions. Gov
ernmental machinery set up by
the colonists <1 id help in pre
serving order and, especially, in
restoring some sanity to a

world gone berserk with t he
slave trade. Missionaries re
ceived the full support of such
machinery and therefore did
more efficient work. The colo
nists were not slow to see that
the missions could also serve
their own ends. Trade did pros

were established, cities sprang
up, and men with various valu
able technical skills and other
useful knowledge came into tHe

The Congo Playground
Thus Leopold did serve some
useful ends in the Congo, even
if indirectly. What if he had
not come to the Congo? Would
other powers not have .seized it
and split up the shares? This
does not mean, however, that
we close our eyes to the impro
prieties of one man just be
cause during the time he lived
impropriety was fashionable.
With his extraordinary powers,
Leopold could easily have set
the native and the Congo well
on the road to meaningful in
dependence. With his vision, he
could have discerned that a
state of exploitation could not
continue for too long without
calling into play violent and ir
repressible forces.
I lis chronicler, perhaps by ac
cident. presented the balance
sheet in the following words:
"If the Belgian capital is the
splendid city we see today, it is
largely thanks to Leopold—and
the Congo."
It is from here the light
shines forth which for mil
lions of men still plunged in
barbarism will be the dawn of
a better era. . . . Our cities
are gorged with the products
of the most diverse indus
tries; nowhere will they find
so great a market to absorb
them. The most intelligent of
our youth demand wider hori
zons oil which to expend their
abounding energy. Our work
ing population will derive
from the virgin regions of Af
rica new sources of prosper
ity and render more in ex

These were 1 he words spoken
by that daring and visionary
adventurer, King Leopold II of
the Belgians, on his acquisition

of the Congo "Free" State as a
personal property. This was to
wards the close of ihe nine
teenth century; the last pieces
of land were being divided up
amongst various European pow

usual genius and dexterity, had
managed to carve out a fairly
extensive and potentially rich
territory for himself. As his
chronicler put it, "for one man
to have acquired all this (the
Congo) without the use of
force, entirely by his own
means, with no support from
his country and in competition
with far more powerful rivals,
was an almost incredible feat,
which only the possession by

The Congo Playground
Thus Leopold did serve some
useful ends in the Congo, even
if indirectly. What if he had
not come to the Congo? Would
other powers not have .seized it
and split up the shares? This
does not mean, however, that
we close our eyes to the impro
prieties of one man just be

impropriety was fashionable.
With his extraordinary powers,
Leopold could easily have set
the native and the Congo well
on the road to meaningful in
dependence. With his vision, he
could have discerned that a
state of exploitation could not
continue for too long without
calling into play violent and ir
repressible forces.

It is from here the light

lions of men still plunged in
barbarism will be the dawn of
a better era. . . . Our cities
are gorged with the products
of the most diverse indus
tries; nowhere will they find
so great a market to absorb
them. The most intelligent of
our youth demand wider hori

abounding energy. Our work

from the virgin regions of Af

These were 1 he words spoken
by that daring and visionary
adventurer, King Leopold II of
the Belgians, on his acquisition

of the Congo "Free" State as a
personal property. This was to
wards the close of ihe nine
teenth century; the last pieces
of land were being divided up
amongst various European pow
ers, and Leopold, through un
usual genius and dexterity, had
managed to carve out a fairly
extensive and potentially rich
territory for himself. As his
chronicler put it, "for one man
to have acquired all this (the
Congo) without the use of
force, entirely by his own
means, with no support from
his country and in competition
with far more powerful rivals,
was an almost incredible feat,
which only the possession by
Leopold of extraordinary quali
ties could explain."
