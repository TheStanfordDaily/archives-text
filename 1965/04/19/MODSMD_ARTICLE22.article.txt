# MOVIE REVIEW
## 'Blood-and-Guts' Formula Produces Another Loser 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
Always one to play it on the safe side, in making "Major Dundee
Hollywood followed its traditional formula for the Adult Western
with Civil War Overtones. That is, take two Strong Men with Dark
Pasts, confront them with assorted Painful Decisions, mix in In
dians, Sex, and Southern Gentlemen, and add blood and liquor in

large quantities. The result will
undoubtedly be a Masterpiece.
The Strong Men in this case are
Charlton Heston as Major Dundee
(for the Union > and Richard Har
ris as a Southern Gentleman (for
the Confederacy). Unfortunately,
their Dark Pasts and Hidden
Problems remain pretty consist-
I ently dark and hidden through
i out. the movie; for nobody, in
i eluding the characters, seems to
I know much about them, except,
; of course, that they are Signifi
j cant.
It is revealed somewhere along
i the line that Heston Goofed at
| Gettysburg, which is why he is
| commanding officer of a prison
| camp, and that Harris, ex-friend
| and present prisoner of Heston, is
an immigrant Irish potato farm
er. For various reasons, they have
combined forces and are heading
into Mexico (with troops) to ex
j terminate a pesky Indian named
i Charriba, who craftily evades
j them but gets it in the end.
Bloody Battles
Along the way, there are four
| tasty battle scenes, filmed in
j bloody color, separated by very
' long pauses. During these lulls,
' to pass the lime Heston and Har
| ris trade insults and Incidents
from the Past. Additional diver
sion is provided by Sex (Senta
! Bergen, who rears her nasty, but
| not ugly, head in the middle of
! nowhere and almost gets Heston
' killed.
While Heston is recovering in
, Durango he falls into the Slough
of Despond (liquor) but is pulled
out just in time by his faithful

troops. Filling in the remaining
pauses are Michael (Bugler-with
a - Diary) Anderson's functional
but uninspiring narration, the
panoramas of Mexico, and the
French.
The French have somehow got
ten mixed up in all this, and are
on hand for the last encounter, a
real killer of a battle right in the
middle of the Rio Grande where
just-deserts awards are handed
out all around, mostly in the form
of a stab in Ihe back.
Deserve Daggers
Among those who deserve a
stab but don't get it are Harry
Fink and Sam Peckinpah. To
Fink, who wrote the story and
collaborated on the screenplay,
goes the dull script and inane dia
logue award one rihbonless type
writer for his next effort. To
Peckinpah, who directed, goes the
prize for the length of this pic
ture- a clock with a 30-second
minute so that the audience won't
have to yawn its way through his
next screen triumph.
Finally, to Charlton Heston,
who returned his salary to the
studio so that all of "Major Dun
dee" could be shot on location in
Mexico, goes the consolation prize
a blank check with the follow
ing printed on its back: "Mexico
was grand, but you should have
taken your money and, to quote
your own advice, 'run like hell.' "
Prospective viewers who aren't
particularly fond of Ihe thunder
and-blood (or is il blunder-and
thud?) school of movie - making
are advised to do likewise.
