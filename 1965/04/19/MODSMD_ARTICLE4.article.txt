### 
Strained relations between the
Stiekney's restaurant ehain and
Peninsula civil rights organiza
tions took a turn for the better
Saturday as a result of a meeting
j held under the auspices of th e
Fair Employment Practices Com
! mission.
j Meeting with representatives
of the Stiekney's restaurants
j were Mid-peninsula CORK, and
! representatives of the Stanford
| Graduate Coordinating Council
: and civil rights groups.
CORE chairman Jack Owens
j stated after the meeing, "We are
! gratified by the very positive re
sponse of the Stiekney repre
sentatives, Mr. Fastiff and Mr.
i Comb, and are looking forward to
| working in close liaison with the
Stiekney's management in helping
them implement their program.
CORE'S objectives in undertak
ing direct action against th e
Stiekney ehain were to sit down
for fruitful discussions and to
develop a positive minority pro
gram. These objectives have been
achieved and picketing at Stiek
ney's has ceased."
CCommunity Problem
While progress was made in
I the recognition of the situation
jas a "community problem," the
J actual working out of the details
of a program will not come until
a meeting to be held either April
30 or May 1.
In an interview with The Daily,
I Stiekney's representative David
Comb said that "Mr. Stiekney rea
lizes that employment opportuni
ties for Negroes is a community
problem, and we have employed
Negroes in our restaurants for.
some time. We have agreed to
work closely with interested civil
rights groups and state officials
in an effort to strengthen o u r
minority placement program in
all our restaurants."
After noting the upcoming
meeting with CORE to work out
further details, Comb continued:
"It is our desire to seek qualified
applicants for jobs without dis
criminating in any way. Selec
tion for jobs is based on merit
and we sincerely hope that dur
ing the course of our recruiting
efforts and work with CORP" in
terested Negroes will apply."
