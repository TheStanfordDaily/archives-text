# Hi Ho Silver Bromide!

### 
The Stanford Art Gallery is now featuring the
Eadeweard MayBridge Photographic Exhibit.
MayBridge's most famous assignment came
from Governor Leland Stanford to photo
graph horses in motion. Stanford backed the

photographic experiment with money as well
as by having railroad engineers devise a fast
camera shutter. The pictures will remain on
display until May 2.

(Lt. McKinley holds degrees in electronics and electri
cal engineering from the Georgia Institute of Tech
nology and the Armed Forces Institute of Technology.
He received the 1963 Air Force Research A. Devel
opment Award for his work with inertial guidance
components. Here he answers some frequently-asked
questions about the place of college-trained men and
women in the U.S. Air Force.)
Is Air Force research really advanced, compared to
what others are doing? It certainly is. As a matter of
fact, much of the work being done right now in uni
versities and industry had its beginnings in Air Force
research and development projects. After all, when
you're involved in the development of guidance sys
tems for spacc vehicles—a current Air Force project
in America's spacc program—you're working on the
frontiers of knowledge.
What areas do Air Force scientists get involved in?
Practically any you can name. Of coursc the principal
aim of Air Forcc research is to expand our aerospace
capability. But in carrying out this general purpose,
individual projects explore an extremely wide range
of topics. "Side cffccts" of Air Forcc research arc
often as important, scientifically, as the main thrust.
How important Is the work a recent graduate can
•\pcct to do? It's just as important and exciting as his
own knowledge and skill can make it. From my own
experience, I can say that right from the start I was
doing vital, absorbing research. That's one of the
things that's so good about an Air Force carecr-i
■ives young people the chance to do meaningful worl
n the areas that really interest them.
vvhat non-scientific jobs docs the Air Force offer?
course the Air Forcc has a continuing need f\
\ ed ofiict rs-p ; 'ots and navigator,. I hen. m .i'sc

many varied and challenging administrativc-manage
rial positions. Remember, the Air Forcc is a vast and
complex organization. It takes a great many different
kinds of people to keep it running. But there arc two
uniform criteria: you've got to be intelligent, and
you've got to be willing to work hard.
What sort of future do I have in the Air Force? Just
as big as you want to make it. In the Air Force, talent
has a way of coming to the top. It has to be that way,
if we're going to have the best people in the right
places, keeping America strong and free.
What's the best way to start an Air Force career? An
excellent way—the way 1 started—is through Air Force
OfTiccr Training School. OTS is a three-month course,
given at Lackland Air Force Base, near San Antonio.
Texas, that's open to both men and women. You can
apply when you're within 210 days of graduation, or
alter you've received your degree.
How long will I be committed to serve? Four years
from the time you graduate from OTS and receive
your commission. If you go on to pilot or navigator
training, the four years starts when you're awarded
your wings.
Are there other ways to become an Air Force ofiifer?
There's Air Force ROTC, active at many colleges
and universities, and the Air Forcc Academy, where
admission is by examination and Congressional ap
pointment. If you'd like more information on any Air
Forcc program, you can get it from the Professor o;
Aerospace Studies (if there's one on your car 1 ■

(Lt. McKinley holds degrees in electronics and electri
cal engineering from the Georgia Institute of Tech
nology and the Armed Forces Institute of Technology.
He received the 1963 Air Force Research A. Devel
opment Award for his work with inertial guidance
components. Here he answers some frequently-asked
questions about the place of college-trained men and
women in the U.S. Air Force.)
Is Air Force research really advanced, compared to
what others are doing? It certainly is. As a matter of
fact, much of the work being done right now in uni
versities and industry had its beginnings in Air Force
research and development projects. After all, when
you're involved in the development of guidance sys
tems for spacc vehicles—a current Air Force project
in America's spacc program—you're working on the
frontiers of knowledge.
What areas do Air Force scientists get involved in?
Practically any you can name. Of coursc the principal
aim of Air Forcc research is to expand our aerospace
capability. But in carrying out this general purpose,
individual projects explore an extremely wide range
of topics. "Side cffccts" of Air Forcc research arc
often as important, scientifically, as the main thrust.
How important Is the work a recent graduate can
•\pcct to do? It's just as important and exciting as his
own knowledge and skill can make it. From my own
experience, I can say that right from the start I was
doing vital, absorbing research. That's one of the
things that's so good about an Air Force carecr-i
■ives young people the chance to do meaningful worl
n the areas that really interest them.
vvhat non-scientific jobs docs the Air Force offer?
course the Air Forcc has a continuing need f\
\ ed ofiict rs-p ; 'ots and navigator,. I hen. m .i'sc

many varied and challenging administrativc-manage
rial positions. Remember, the Air Forcc is a vast and
complex organization. It takes a great many different
kinds of people to keep it running. But there arc two
uniform criteria: you've got to be intelligent, and
you've got to be willing to work hard.
What sort of future do I have in the Air Force? Just
as big as you want to make it. In the Air Force, talent
has a way of coming to the top. It has to be that way,
if we're going to have the best people in the right
places, keeping America strong and free.
What's the best way to start an Air Force career? An
excellent way—the way 1 started—is through Air Force
OfTiccr Training School. OTS is a three-month course,
given at Lackland Air Force Base, near San Antonio.
Texas, that's open to both men and women. You can
apply when you're within 210 days of graduation, or
alter you've received your degree.
How long will I be committed to serve? Four years
from the time you graduate from OTS and receive
your commission. If you go on to pilot or navigator
training, the four years starts when you're awarded
your wings.
Are there other ways to become an Air Force ofiifer?
There's Air Force ROTC, active at many colleges
and universities, and the Air Forcc Academy, where
admission is by examination and Congressional ap
pointment. If you'd like more information on any Air
Forcc program, you can get it from the Professor o;
