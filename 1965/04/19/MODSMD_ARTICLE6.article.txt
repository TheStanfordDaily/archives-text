# Hi Ho Silver Bromide!

The Stanford Art Gallery is now featuring the
Eadeweard MayBridge Photographic Exhibit.
MayBridge's most famous assignment came
from Governor Leland Stanford to photo
graph horses in motion. Stanford backed the

photographic experiment with money as well
as by having railroad engineers devise a fast
camera shutter. The pictures will remain on
display until May 2.
