# GRAD TEAM
## Probing Space for Credit 
### 
Plans to send several unmanned instru
mented space vehicles to Mars in 1971
one to orbit the red planet and one or more
lo land on it - are being worked out by a
task force of 50 Stanford University gradu
ate students.
Project, consultants include some of the
most famous names in space science, among
them Dr. William Pickering of the Jet Pro
pulsion Laboratory, Dr. Howard Seifcrt of
United Technology, and Nobel prize winner
Dr. Joshua Lederberg.
Now in their third month of planning,
the team recently sent twenty-four of its
members to Southern California for a two
day inspection trip and consultations with
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Hughes Aircraft, Northrup Space Labora
tories and North American Aviation.
Special Graduate Course
It is all pari of a special course designed
to give graduate students the "feel" of
working together in a team to plan and
design a major engineering project, ex
plained Prof. Bruce Lusignan. an electrical
engineer and co-director of the program.
"It calls for teamwork among special
ists of many different fields," he said, "and
is an experience few people can ever obtain
in or out of college. Yet it is the kind of
group engineering which is becoming more
common every day with the rapid advance
of our science and technology."
The course was given last year for the
first time under the direction of Prof. Wil
liam Bolluv, an aeronautical engineer who

had previously organized a similar course
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"Last year's learn designed a 'SYVAIMI'
satellite system for world-wide weather
data collection and forecasting," said Dr.
Lusignan. "It won the admiration and close
study of weather and space experts and
parts of it will probably be incorporated
eventually in a global weather forecasting
system."
Profs. Bollay and Lusignan are co-diree
tors of the 1965 project. The 50 participat
ing students represent varied fields from
radar astronomy, computer science and
aeronautieal-ast ronaut ieal engineering to
biology and cost and management analysis.
The group has organized into four sections
-Scientific Experiments, Trajectory and
Control, Spacecraft and Communications,
and Design Coordination and Support.
Typical Decisions
Some of the decisions made so far by the
team sections:
• An orbiter and one or more landers
are required. The orbiter will carry much
of the storage and data reduction equip
ment and will also house several scientific
experiments. The lander will contain scien
tific instruments to perform 1 he life-detec
tion, atmospheric and geological measure
ments.
• In 1971 Mars will be within one AU
(astronomical unit 93 million miles) of
earth from April 9 to Dec. 5. A vehicle
should get near Mars as early in this period
as possible. The earlier it arrives, the longei
lite communication lime available before

Mars passes too far away, but the loss pay
load it can carry. However, a payload of
about 2500 pounds could be delivered some
time before midsummer to arrive any
earlier the payload would have to be drasti
cally reduced."
Export Consultants
In addition to the classroom and labora
tory studies under the project faculty, the
student team is getting top-flight advice
from their expert consultants in a series
of 20 lectures. The subjects include such
exotic titles as "Solid Propellant Rocket
Systems," "Upper Stage an d Braking
Rockets," "Atmospheric Re-entry," "Multi
vator Life Sensors," "Bistatic Radar Mea
surements," "Stellar Stabilization." and
"The Automated Biological Laboratory."
The course project extends over two
quarters. During winter quarter the team
evaluated the mission's characteristics and
determined which of the alternative ap
proaches is best.
Models To Be Constructed
This quarter the students will carry out
detailed design and build models of com
ponents. The best of these designs will be
"fro/en" for the final mission, and a full
report will be made in June to industry and
government representatives.
Besides the directors, other Stanford
faculty contributing to (he course are Profs.
Robert Hemmes, Von R. Eshleman, Owen
K. Garriott. Robert H. Cannon Jr., Peter Z.
Bulkeley, John V. Breakwell. Anthony K.

Deßra, and Lecturer William Lapson.

had previously organized a similar course
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"Last year's learn designed a 'SYVAIMI'
satellite system for world-wide weather
data collection and forecasting," said Dr.
Lusignan. "It won the admiration and close
study of weather and space experts and
parts of it will probably be incorporated
eventually in a global weather forecasting
system."
Profs. Bollay and Lusignan are co-diree
tors of the 1965 project. The 50 participat
ing students represent varied fields from
radar astronomy, computer science and
aeronautieal-ast ronaut ieal engineering to
biology and cost and management analysis.
The group has organized into four sections
-Scientific Experiments, Trajectory and
Control, Spacecraft and Communications,
and Design Coordination and Support.
Typical Decisions
Some of the decisions made so far by the
team sections:
• An orbiter and one or more landers
are required. The orbiter will carry much
of the storage and data reduction equip
ment and will also house several scientific
experiments. The lander will contain scien
tific instruments to perform 1 he life-detec
tion, atmospheric and geological measure
ments.
• In 1971 Mars will be within one AU
(astronomical unit 93 million miles) of
earth from April 9 to Dec. 5. A vehicle
should get near Mars as early in this period
as possible. The earlier it arrives, the longei
lite communication lime available before

Mars passes too far away, but the loss pay
load it can carry. However, a payload of
about 2500 pounds could be delivered some
time before midsummer to arrive any
earlier the payload would have to be drasti
cally reduced."
Export Consultants
In addition to the classroom and labora
tory studies under the project faculty, the
student team is getting top-flight advice
from their expert consultants in a series
of 20 lectures. The subjects include such
exotic titles as "Solid Propellant Rocket
Systems," "Upper Stage an d Braking
Rockets," "Atmospheric Re-entry," "Multi
vator Life Sensors," "Bistatic Radar Mea
surements," "Stellar Stabilization." and
"The Automated Biological Laboratory."
The course project extends over two
quarters. During winter quarter the team
evaluated the mission's characteristics and
determined which of the alternative ap
proaches is best.
Models To Be Constructed
This quarter the students will carry out
detailed design and build models of com
ponents. The best of these designs will be
"fro/en" for the final mission, and a full
report will be made in June to industry and
government representatives.
Besides the directors, other Stanford
faculty contributing to (he course are Profs.

K. Garriott. Robert H. Cannon Jr., Peter Z.
Bulkeley, John V. Breakwell. Anthony K.

Plans to send several unmanned instru

most famous names in space science, among

Special Graduate Course
It is all pari of a special course designed
to give graduate students the "feel" of
working together in a team to plan and
design a major engineering project, ex
plained Prof. Bruce Lusignan. an electrical
engineer and co-director of the program.
"It calls for teamwork among special
ists of many different fields," he said, "and
is an experience few people can ever obtain
in or out of college. Yet it is the kind of
group engineering which is becoming more
common every day with the rapid advance
of our science and technology."

load it can carry. However, a payload of
about 2500 pounds could be delivered some
time before midsummer to arrive any
earlier the payload would have to be drasti

Export Consultants
In addition to the classroom and labora
tory studies under the project faculty, the
student team is getting top-flight advice
from their expert consultants in a series
of 20 lectures. The subjects include such
exotic titles as "Solid Propellant Rocket
Systems," "Upper Stage an d Braking
Rockets," "Atmospheric Re-entry," "Multi
vator Life Sensors," "Bistatic Radar Mea
surements," "Stellar Stabilization." and
"The Automated Biological Laboratory."
The course project extends over two
quarters. During winter quarter the team
evaluated the mission's characteristics and
determined which of the alternative ap
proaches is best.
Models To Be Constructed
This quarter the students will carry out
detailed design and build models of com
ponents. The best of these designs will be
"fro/en" for the final mission, and a full
report will be made in June to industry and
government representatives.
