• Appalachia Bill (wets (Jnick Mobilization
WASHINGTON Governors of the Appalachian states needed
only 20 minutes yesterday to set in motion the unique SI-billion pro
gram of economic aid that grew out of a campaign promise by the
late President John F. Kennedy.
Nine governors and representatives from two other states gave
the quick sendoff in an atmosphere of complete harmony despite
the divergent political alliances represented around the table.
The federal-state program is designed to provide highways, water
and land resources development, vocational schools, and health clinics
among other things for an area stretching from Alabama to Penn
sylvania. The purpose is to upgrade the mountain region's economy.
Although the governors obviously had paved the way at an in
formal session behind closed doors, they said there were no serious
disagreements.
