Oil infamy of infamies!
The Daily lias for the third
lime in three clays fallen vic
tim lo the rambling* of bu
reaucracy. Hold your breath:
tills is a retraction of a re
traction of a retraction.
Remember that one dollar
fee to enter the Con Home
Hydrofollies? Well, it is about
that again. Box 788") has once
again been disowned and the
poor owner of the box, who
had yesterday been coaxed
back onto the campus, has
fled again in terror.
It is all hard to explain but
basically this is the story:
Thursday there was an entry
fee to be sent to Box 7885,
Friday it was revealed the
Committee had no knowledge
of the fee or the box, over the
weekend uninformed mem
bers of the Con Home Hydro
follies Committee unformed
The Daily that there was a
fee and it had been decided to
have them mailed to Box 7885
as originally announced.
Finally yesterday the right
ful members of the Commil
eet came forward and have
made the definitive decision
that there is NO fee and that
NOTHING is to be sent to
Box 7885.
According to Vince Ititchic,
all interested in entering the
Hydrofollies must contact him
at Sigma Chi by Thursday.
The events will be a three
man canoe-joust and a two
man canoe race. The jousting
will be done by I'rosli dollies
with men rowing. The rare
will be for couples. Grand
prize is the King Neptune
Memorial Award.
It is also rumored that the
Phi Kap "A<|iia/.oo" will make
its annual appearance.
Watch The Daily for more
news. Who knows where you
may have to send your en
tries tomorrow? By the way,
conn* home, Box 7885, we love
you!
