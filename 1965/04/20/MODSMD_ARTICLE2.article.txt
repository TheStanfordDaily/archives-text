# Stanford Psychiatrist Sees Need for Rehumanization
## 
### 
"Agitato; ergo sum" (I agitate; therefore, I am). According to
Dr. James Paulson, Chief Psychiatrist for the Stanford Health Ser
vice, this type of reasoning is a "philologic abortion," but often
aptly describes the thinking of modern students.
Speaking without notes last night to a crowd half-filling Tie- ;

sidder large lounge, Paulson dis
cussed "Students' Senility and
Revolution." He called for a "re
humanization of individuals and
a re-focusing of practical an d
technical energies."
Paulson asked that in an "age

of nitpickers,' education should j
j be given another chance to inte- j
• grate the intellectual, the emo-|
i tional, and the behavioral in man. j
! According to Paulson, these
; three spheres have become sepa
j rated at Stanford. "The role of
I the intellect has become lop
i sided," he said.
He talked of "enormous sphe
j roids" of the future, little men
j with huge heads, wobbling weak
| ly about.
Paulson moved from the future
| to the past, and characterized the
j eight millenia of man's recorded
j history as a progression from
I emotionalism to intelleetualism.
| "The Romans added law to the
j Greek culture," he said, "and
after a long period of latency,
Renaissance man re-discovered
man." But he sees increasing se
nility at Stanford since the
I Renaissance.
I"The Fundamental Standard is
I Stanford's greatest contribution
■ to the senility of tradition." Paul
' son commented. He called con
j formity a sign of "intellectual
! and emotional senility."
Paulson argued that the result
, of confronting students with se
nility is a type of revolution. The
alternative to such revolution he'
called "academic depersonaliza
tion."
To add to this unfortunate
I sense of alientation, Paulson saw ;
j a k'reat deal of "on-campus, off-!
campus, and gastrointestinal pres-:
sure."
