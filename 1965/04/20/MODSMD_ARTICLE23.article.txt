"Ah, the final absurdity, hi point of fact,
student government (dare I say if) is hardly
worthwhile at all. It is irrelevant. Irrelevant
to the student's greatest concerns at Stan
ford."
— Robert Naylor
The Stanford Daily
April 15,1965
All, Mr. Naylor, you have (in spite of your
self) made a telling point.
For, in point of fact, if student government is,
as you describe it, a hollow bureaucracy—merely
serving "useful administrative and disciplinary
functions" (even student-created and student
controlled "administrative and disciplinary func
tions") — then it is, indeed, irrelevant to the stu
dent's greatest concerns at Stanford (his educa
tional concerns) and should be denounced from
the red-tile roof-tops—or, failing that, in the pages
of the Daily.
Strong government — including strong student
government — is it means to a social end and not
an end in itself.
The mere transfer of powers from one oxer
burdened bureaucratic structure (the adminis
tration) to another over-burdened bureaucratic
structure (the student government) is, however
desirable as it half-way house, insufficient as a
total justification for a university reform move
ment.
The initial end of structural reform within the

university is (or should ho) the eradication of all
forms of regulation and bureaucracy inessential
to the central educational business of the aca
demic community.
The liberalization ol women's social regula
tions, the passage of the judicial competence bill,
and other such structural transformations, so far
as they accomplish this initial disposal of bureau
cratic dead-wood, hold promise that a genuine
educational reform movement — directed at the
failures and inadequacies of the educational proc
ess itself — is not far away at Stanford.
But immediate structural reforms — however
necessary — are only part of 11 it' kind of change
that must occur, and occur soon, if Stanford is to
become a truly great university.
The question that must be asked — asked soon
and often—is not merely "Power for whom? but
"power for what ends?"
II it is not asked—asked and answered—by the
leaders of student government, in concert with
the faculty, then we, and the University, shall re
vert to the emptiness of President Sterling's oft
quoted "philosophy of education which is: "to
have no philosophy of education."
Yes, Mr. Naylor, "The season is come when
across the campus will echo anew the peculiar
rhetoric of the Campaigning Presidential Candi
date."
But his rhetoric need not be einptj.
Indeed, it must not be.
