# Pelling Withdrawal Statement
## 
### 
Editor's note: The follow
ing is a statement issued by
George Pel ling explaining his
r e a so n s 112 or withdrawing
from the ASSU Presidential
race.
We regret to inform our
countless followers that we
are forced to withdraw from
this campaign. Unavoidable
conflicts have arisen between
the plans of the candidate for
Vice-President and the duties
of that office since the nomi
nation was made. In other
words, the information that
>Ir. Hamlin had been nomi
nated was not greeted by Mr.
Hamlin with glee. However,
our newly won experience in
campaigning and student gov
ernment eminently qualifies
us to offer the following sug
gestions.
First (very seriously): We
are disturbed with the tend
ency exhibited by recent re
form movements to exclude
the faculty from reforms of
university policy. We would
suggest that, ultimately, fac
ulty members must, in some
way, be included within the
ASSU constitution before a
truly legitimate shift of pol
icy-making power can take
place.
Second: We humbly sug

gest ill all good faith and in
the spirit of intelligent criti
cism that the "Electioneering
Rules for ASSU Elections,
Spring, 1965," which have
been drawn up by the ASSU
Elections Commission are an
act of criminal idiocy. They
place restrictions on the cam
paigns of candidates that are
not suffered by the Chron
icle, the Workshop, or the
Let's-Get-Out-of-S o u th Viet
Nam Committee. For ex
ample, our entire funds to
date of $1.43 have been spent
on a poster that is three feet
by twelve feet by two feet;
the maximum size for any
ASSU campaign poster any
where on campus is 11 in. by
11 in.
Thirdly: For the milling
masses who comprise our fol
lowing we honestly cannot
recommend any other candi
dates. However, we do feel
that each has strong charac
teristics which deserve men
tion here and will help you in
your choice. This, then, is our
handy "Pocket Voters' Guide"
for those of you who vote in
your pockets.
Ed "Bimbo" Shaw, whose
record as ASSU financial
manager and as speaker of
I-ASSU will be mentioned

often, which will serve to
point out that it is his great
est has an obscure
running mate.
Sand y MaeKenzie, th e
"Mary Poppins" candidate —
practically perfect in every
way — also has an obscure
running mate.
Dave Rohhins, an obscure
frat man whose running mate
is Frank "I've - been - shot -
down - by - a • Dean" Morse,
heads the sympathy ticket.
They have our sympathy too,
but will not get our votes.
Magnuson and Soule are
RF candidates and may get a
few giggles.
As you call see from this
incisive candidate analysis,
the only thing which the first
three tickets have going for
them is the presence of one
obscure running mate. And,
since it is obvious that ours
was the only halfway serious
ticket which provided two ob
scure running mates, we
would have run with the ut
most optimism. God, the pub
lic and Mr. Hamlin willing,
we would have presented a
great campaign.
We do i'eel, however, that
by withdrawing now we will
he able to say, "Remember,
our group had 47 per cent
fewer banalities."

scure running mates, we
would have run with the ut
most optimism. God, the pub
lic and Mr. Hamlin willing,
we would have presented a
great campaign.
We do i'eel, however, that
by withdrawing now we will
he able to say, "Remember,
our group had 47 per cent
fewer banalities."
Editor's note: The follow
ing is a statement issued by
George Pel ling explaining his
r e a so n s 112 or withdrawing
from the ASSU Presidential
race.
We regret to inform our
countless followers that we
are forced to withdraw from
this campaign. Unavoidable
conflicts have arisen between
the plans of the candidate for
Vice-President and the duties
of that office since the nomi
nation was made. In other
words, the information that
>Ir. Hamlin had been nomi
nated was not greeted by Mr.
Hamlin with glee. However,
our newly won experience in
campaigning and student gov
ernment eminently qualifies
us to offer the following sug
gestions.
First (very seriously): We
are disturbed with the tend
ency exhibited by recent re
form movements to exclude
the faculty from reforms of
university policy. We would
suggest that, ultimately, fac
ulty members must, in some
way, be included within the
ASSU constitution before a
truly legitimate shift of pol
icy-making power can take
place.
Second: We humbly sug

gest ill all good faith and in
the spirit of intelligent criti
cism that the "Electioneering
Rules for ASSU Elections,
Spring, 1965," which have
been drawn up by the ASSU
Elections Commission are an
act of criminal idiocy. They
place restrictions on the cam
paigns of candidates that are
not suffered by the Chron
icle, the Workshop, or the
Let's-Get-Out-of-S o u th Viet
Nam Committee. For ex
ample, our entire funds to
date of $1.43 have been spent
on a poster that is three feet
by twelve feet by two feet;
the maximum size for any
ASSU campaign poster any
where on campus is 11 in. by
11 in.
Thirdly: For the milling
masses who comprise our fol
lowing we honestly cannot
recommend any other candi
dates. However, we do feel
that each has strong charac
teristics which deserve men
tion here and will help you in
your choice. This, then, is our
handy "Pocket Voters' Guide"
for those of you who vote in
your pockets.
Ed "Bimbo" Shaw, whose
record as ASSU financial
manager and as speaker of
I-ASSU will be mentioned

often, which will serve to
point out that it is his great
est has an obscure
running mate.
Sand y MaeKenzie, th e
"Mary Poppins" candidate —
practically perfect in every
way — also has an obscure
running mate.
Dave Rohhins, an obscure
frat man whose running mate
is Frank "I've - been - shot -
down - by - a • Dean" Morse,
heads the sympathy ticket.
They have our sympathy too,
but will not get our votes.
Magnuson and Soule are
RF candidates and may get a
few giggles.
As you call see from this
incisive candidate analysis,
the only thing which the first
three tickets have going for
them is the presence of one
obscure running mate. And,
since it is obvious that ours
was the only halfway serious
ticket which provided two ob
scure running mates, we
would have run with the ut
most optimism. God, the pub
lic and Mr. Hamlin willing,
we would have presented a
great campaign.
