# Lumumbaism States Goals For All African People
## 
### URIAH CHINWAH (Second in a Series 
With the ghost of a benevolent, philanthropic colonist properly
laid, we can more easily follow the inevitable rise of the "Lumum
bists in the Congo and all over Africa. To put the matter briefly,
the scene had been set by the colonist; it was merely a question of
time for the necessan and inevitable response to follow.

The African in the remote viM
lage knew much about the white!
stranger in Africa from rumors;
of his incredible exploits and
great powers. Occasionally he
had personal proof of some of j
these stories in terms of smoking
sticks that killed and giant flying
birds that dropped destructive!
balls of fire on his villages and [
his people. He was a god to be j
feared and, perhaps, worshipped.
The city-living African knew a :
bit more about this white stran-1
ger. He could be the best of
friends when friendly; he could
also be a difficult enemy. The job
this African worked at- usually]
not a high-grade one was pro- j
vided by this white lord, who also ,
happened to be in control of t ho
whole country. It was not clear
to the African, however, if he had
occasion to think about it, why
his country was being run by an
other.
White Magician
With time virtually every At'ri
can began to gain a fair picture
of the situation. Only the very !
i t mote villagers who, to keep 1
their culture intact, or by sheer
force of necessity, preferred to I
remain out; of touch with the
Cities, still knew very little of this
white magician. They feared and !
worshipped him and wondered as '
to exactly what type of god he j
was.
It was into this picture that Lu
mumba and his kind stepped,
holding on to their courage and
convictions with both hands. In
Lumumba's simple words, the Af
rican wanted independence. He
wanted freedom from political
bondage and material want. He
wanted to work out his own des
tiny as speedily as possible. Us
ing the colonial boundaries forced j
upon him as a rough guide, he !
would work with his fellow Afri
can nationalists to promote the
welfare of all within these bound
aries. He knew he was not suffi
ciently prepared to work out his
own salvation, so he would have
all foreign friends stay to help or ;
come in from outside with sincere i
convictions to help, if they desired s
to do so. Such true friends could j
not go unappreciated and unre-!
warded.
Since Belgium happened to be ;
the Congo's initiator into Western
culture, the Congolese people
would enjoy preserving friendly

relations with her, and would look
up to her in this new age of en
lightenment as a big, helping
brother. But and it was a strong
but the rule had to bo African,
meaningfully African; the coun
try had to be run for the good of
all Africans, and also for.the good
of their helping brothers. •
Essential Features
Thus the essential features of
what "Lumumbaism" meant to
all of Africa were as follows:
•An undivided Congo united in
true independence.
• x u.iuamemal social reforms
to eliminate colonial institutions;
economic reforms based on social
ist principles.
• A Pan-African outlook; firm
support for non-alignment.
• Creation of a supra-tribal na
tional state, based on a national
ist (non-tribal) party and a strong
central government; this permits
a limited degree of autonomy for
the provinces, while maintaining
a unitary form of government.
• Vigor o us insistence on a
strictly non - colonialist relation
ship with Belgium.
Enthusiasm ran like circular
ripples from a central point on
the ocean to the farthest possible
reaches. Lumumba was the cen
tral point, and the nation hailed
him as a messiah. The city-dwell
ers had a good idea what the
issues at stake were and quickly
conveyed the message to their
relatives far and near. "We would
govern ourselves; we would be
friends with good Belgians; those
of them desiring—and any other
foreigners could stay and help
us build; we would live in mutual
trust and friendship; but we
would oust all bad and undesir
able elements."
Natives in the far, outlying vil
lages were not to be left out ei
ther; the ripples did reach the
most remote corners. This was a
good time to abandon narrow
tribal jealousies. Lumumba was
a black man, a fellow Congolese,
a fellow African. He would lead
them to meaningful freedom;
they would entrust their destiny
into his hands. The village dwell
er usually desired nothing more
than a simple family life: to
farm, fish, swim, have occasional
moonlit dances, and enjoy mysti
cal communion with spiritual
forces just as his forefathers did.
