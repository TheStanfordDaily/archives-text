# Can One Sargent Be Two Lieutenants?

The Peace Corps, like any four
year-old, suffers from growing
pains.
"I wouldn't say its image is tar
nished, but the luster has dulled a
little," said one Peace Corps official.
"Other people have done it and the
'me alone' feeling is missing."
Age has brought the Peace Corps
the additional problem of trying to
become an institution with a sense
of permanence, while keeping its
youthful spirit and idealism intact.
"I have contemplated the problem
growth could bring to the Peace

Corps," said Warren Wiggins, as
sociate director for Program De
velopment and Operations. "Presi
dent Johnson has said he thought
we should have some 20,000 Volun
teers in the next three or four
years.
"I feel we can have this number
and still retain the highly indi
vidual character of the agency,"
Wiggins said.
Another problem is that Sargent
Shriver now serves the dual role
of directing the Peace Corps and
the War on Poverty.
"Shriver still makes all the pol
icy decisions and keeps his personal
touch on the agency," said an offi
cial. "The main loss is in the time it
takes to get decisions made. Things
can get bogged down in the mean
while."
Another official compared Shriv
er's dual position with that of the
Secretary of State or Defense.
These men have one title but many
jobs. One could consider a man with
Shriver's abilities to have been un
der-employed before his present
load.
Shriver serves as a reminder of
President John Kennedy and per
sonifies the idealism of the Peace
Corps "type."
President Kennedy had gener
ated a particular type of spirit and
sense of living dynamic. This esprit
de corps captured the minds of
many young Americans. Because
President Kennedy originated the
Peace Corps and because of his
youthfulness, there was a unique
identification.
The most recent growing pain
has come from within the Peace
Corps itself. A Peace Corps pro
gram director in Bolivia, Jasin Ed
wards, has complained of the
"blandness" of today's Volunteers.
"The bland Volunteer is one who
doesn't cause trouble, who makes
the necessary friends, adjusts nice
ly to his environment, accepts
things as they are and gets along
beautifully without worrying any
body or wrenching changes in the
environment.
"Anyone approaching the ex
treme such as the quiet guy, the
pretty girl, or the outspoken critic
was selected out somewhere along
the line as a dangerous risk," said
Edwards.
In the critic's opinion, the selec
tion process may eliminate the per
son who would not only understand
and adjust to a new environment,
but also those who would have the
courage and drive to inspire change,
affect attitudes and encourage oth
ers to act for themselves.

director of the Peace Corps Office
of Volunteers, wrote in the Peace
Corps magazine that while the mo
tivations for volunteering might be
the same, there are more people
who view the Peace Corps as a
logical step in their career and few
er of those who think of the Peace
Corps as a risk-taking, way-out
adventure unrelated to their life
plans.
"There is little evidence, how
ever, that this has adversely affect
ed the Volunteer's performance.
The evidence is that Volunteers are
more solid, reliable, and technically
qualified."
Charlie Peters, Director of Eval
uation, pointed out that one element
which has caused a change in the
Volunteers is that now the average
age level is down to 23 or 24 years.
Before there were more 25- and 26-
year-olds, who tended to give it
built-in leadership.
A consensus among Peace Corps
workers and associates is that the
people in it have brought to the
government a sense of enthusiasm
and real commitment which has
been absent from too many govern
ment agencies for too many years.

growing up, the Peace Corps, for a
Washington agency, still retains a
refreshing air.

jobs. One could consider a man with
Shriver's abilities to have been un
der-employed before his present
load.
Shriver serves as a reminder of
President John Kennedy and per
sonifies the idealism of the Peace
Corps "type."
President Kennedy had gener
ated a particular type of spirit and
sense of living dynamic. This esprit
de corps captured the minds of
many young Americans. Because
President Kennedy originated the
Peace Corps and because of his
youthfulness, there was a unique
identification.
The most recent growing pain
has come from within the Peace
Corps itself. A Peace Corps pro
gram director in Bolivia, Jasin Ed
wards, has complained of the
"blandness" of today's Volunteers.
"The bland Volunteer is one who
doesn't cause trouble, who makes
the necessary friends, adjusts nice
ly to his environment, accepts
things as they are and gets along
beautifully without worrying any
body or wrenching changes in the
environment.
"Anyone approaching the ex
treme such as the quiet guy, the
pretty girl, or the outspoken critic
was selected out somewhere along
the line as a dangerous risk," said
Edwards.
In the critic's opinion, the selec
tion process may eliminate the per
son who would not only understand
and adjust to a new environment,
but also those who would have the
courage and drive to inspire change,
affect attitudes and encourage oth
ers to act for themselves.

director of the Peace Corps Office
of Volunteers, wrote in the Peace
Corps magazine that while the mo
tivations for volunteering might be
the same, there are more people
who view the Peace Corps as a
logical step in their career and few

Corps as a risk-taking, way-out
adventure unrelated to their life
plans.
"There is little evidence, how
ever, that this has adversely affect
ed the Volunteer's performance.
The evidence is that Volunteers are
more solid, reliable, and technically
qualified."
Charlie Peters, Director of Eval
uation, pointed out that one element
which has caused a change in the
Volunteers is that now the average
age level is down to 23 or 24 years.
Before there were more 25- and 26-
year-olds, who tended to give it
built-in leadership.
A consensus among Peace Corps
workers and associates is that the
people in it have brought to the
government a sense of enthusiasm
and real commitment which has
been absent from too many govern
ment agencies for too many years.
And despite the usual trials of
growing up, the Peace Corps, for a
Washington agency, still retains a
refreshing air.
It is built upon a foundation of
idealism and practicality and or
iented to making the world a little
bit better.
The Peace Corps, like any four
year-old, suffers from growing
pains.
"I wouldn't say its image is tar
nished, but the luster has dulled a
little," said one Peace Corps official.
"Other people have done it and the
'me alone' feeling is missing."
Age has brought the Peace Corps
the additional problem of trying to
become an institution with a sense
of permanence, while keeping its
youthful spirit and idealism intact.
"I have contemplated the problem
growth could bring to the Peace

Corps," said Warren Wiggins, as
sociate director for Program De
velopment and Operations. "Presi
dent Johnson has said he thought
we should have some 20,000 Volun
teers in the next three or four
years.
"I feel we can have this number
and still retain the highly indi
vidual character of the agency,"
Wiggins said.
Another problem is that Sargent
Shriver now serves the dual role
of directing the Peace Corps and
the War on Poverty.
"Shriver still makes all the pol
icy decisions and keeps his personal
touch on the agency," said an offi
cial. "The main loss is in the time it
takes to get decisions made. Things
can get bogged down in the mean
while."

.said, F. Kingston Berlew, acting


Peace Corps Director Sargent Shriver talks with the late President Kennedy shortly
before the President addressed a group of outgoing Volunteers.
director of the Peace Corps Office
of Volunteers, wrote in the Peace
Corps magazine that while the mo
tivations for volunteering might be
the same, there are more people
who view the Peace Corps as a
logical step in their career and few
er of those who think of the Peace
Corps as a risk-taking, way-out
adventure unrelated to their life
plans.
"There is little evidence, how
ever, that this has adversely affect
ed the Volunteer's performance.
The evidence is that Volunteers are
more solid, reliable, and technically
qualified."
Charlie Peters, Director of Eval
uation, pointed out that one element
which has caused a change in the
Volunteers is that now the average
age level is down to 23 or 24 years.
Before there were more 25- and 26-
year-olds, who tended to give it
built-in leadership.
A consensus among Peace Corps
workers and associates is that the
people in it have brought to the
government a sense of enthusiasm
and real commitment which has
been absent from too many govern
ment agencies for too many years.
And despite the usual trials of
growing up, the Peace Corps, for a
Washington agency, still retains a
refreshing air.
It is built upon a foundation of
idealism and practicality and or
iented to making the world a little
bit better.
