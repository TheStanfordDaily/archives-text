# A 						Story of Opposites: Bias & the Peace Corps
## 
### 
The Peace Corps, in its four years of existence, has
emphasized repeatedly that racial and religious bias
are not tolerated in its selection process.
The Peace Corps rejects bias. But bias has not been
so kind to the Peace Corps.
A major problem in the civil rights movement to
day is finding skilled and well-educated Negroes to
fill jobs now open to them either through reforms
generated by the civil rights bill or the increased
readiness of employers to hire them.
The problem admits to no simple solution, for an
individual coming from a "culturally deprived" en
vironment, who receives sub-standard schooling,
doesn't necessarily "make the grade" even if he is
given the chance.
The issue, not so much racial as socio-economic, is
a very real concern for rights leaders. Tt is also of
concern to the Peace Corps.
The trouble centers in both Peace Corps recruit
ment and selection.
"A lot of Negroes just aren't sure that the Peace
Corps wants them," states Bob Gale, director of
recruiting. "The sign says 'join,' but Negroes think
'they don't mean me.' It's been that way so many
times that some Negroes don't even bother any
more."
Sargent Shriver, director of the Peace Corps, said:
"We haven't waited for colored citizens to seek
jobs in the Peace Corps. We went out and looked for
them.
"We have sent white men into black men's coun
tries and black men to white men's countries and not
once has this policy caused us a single moment of
discontent or created a single incident."
Gale pointed out that letters have been sent to the
presidents of Negro colleges asking for the names
of top students, who were subsequently contacted by
Peace Corps representatives. A "special saturation
effort" is conducted at Negro campuses to get a larger
representation in the Peace Corps.
"The job of the Peace Corps is not civil rights,"
one official points out. "We have our own job to do.
But we'll do anything we can to help qualified Ne
groes get into the Peace Corps."
Thus the articles in Negro publications, photos of
Negroes in Peace Corps advertising literature, Ne
groes placed on as many recruiting teams as possible.
Yet the percentage of Negroes serving as Volun
teers overseas remains low. Although Negro repre
sentation as staff members in Washington and over
seas is high (about 26 per cent), Negro Volunteers
abroad constitute only about 5 to 6 per cent of the
total, based on unofficial estimates. The nationwide
percentage of Negroes is about 11 per cent.
One problem manifests itself in concern over the
"image." George Carter, director of the North Af
rica, Near East and South Asia projects, and a Negro
himself, said:
"There is probably no project in the world without
a Negro connected to it in some way, either as a
staff member or a Volunteer.

"The only place where a preponderance of whites
is a problem is in those countries where we already
have a 'racist image.' Here the lack of Negroes tends
to fix the Peace Corps in the people's minds as a
middle class white organization."
Many bright, socially-oriented Negroes are com
mitted to the civil rights fight at home. Others are
busy looking for good jobs or graduate schools. Com
petition for the educated Negro in business, industry
and education has become fierce today.
But even when a substantial proportion of Negroes
submit Questionnaires, there is still a problem, es
pecially in the case of the Southern Negro.
The Peace Corps relies strongly on the Modern
Language Aptitude Test, which purports to measure
potential ability to learn a language. On this exam,
Negroes, as a group, tend to score lower than other
Volunteers.
The race of an applicant, incidentally, is not known
to Peace Corps personnel before he shows up for
training—in other words, until after the tests have
been taken.
Gale pointed out that "until we raise the level of
teaching in some Southern schools, we won't have
college students who score well on the aptitude
exams."
Dr. Abraham Carp, director of Selection, points to
another difficulty.
"There is a danger," he says, "in using these apti
tude tests for applicants from culturally deprived
environments. The tests may underrate applicants
in terms of their potential." They are not, he main
tains, an absolute index of what their future achieve
ment as Volunteers may be.
Dr. Carp is presently studying whether training
courses could be lengthened for these applicants. He
sees "academically oriented techniques" used in apti
tude testing and training as favoring certain types.
Also under study are more programs where another
language is not required.
The Peace Corps is sensitive, in a meaningful way,
to the problems of discrimination. They will dis
qualify anyone if he shows discriminatory tendencies.
Colleges that are not integrated will not be chosen
as training sites. The representatives of minority
group members on the staff in Washington and over
seas is high compared to other government agencies.
Hut other hazards are operative too—those of "re
verse discrimination" which hampers the organiza
tion that wants to give Negroes a break but can't
because of complex societal factors; those that stop
a Negro from believing that the sign reading "join"
means him; those that deter a Southern Negro from
getting good references because the people he asks
do not know how to write.
The Peace Corps tried to say goodbye to bias a
long time ago. Put it's a stubborn guest.


Volunteer Jamei F. Fiiher, a 19A2 graduate of Princeton Uni
versity who majored in philosophy, was on English teacher at the
demonstration school of Katmandu's only teacher training college.
An Eagle Scout, he was also active with the Nepalese scouting
movement which is just getting underway. Here he helps a young
ster master one of the knots she must learn. He wears the
Nepalese national dress.


Running a school lunch program is one of many things done by
Volunteer Ida Shoatz, a 1963 liberal arts graduate from State
College at Cheyney, Pa., as she works in the Peruvian Andes.
Here she greets a young friend in the market of Pisac where
she has gone to buy food.
