# Common Misconceptions Exploded
## 
### 
The Peace Corps, like many other governmental organizations, is
plagued by a "knowledge problem." Many people, including a large
number of college students, don't know what the Peace Corps is all
about.
The misconceptions cover almost every phase of Peace Corps activity,
but the truth about the work is simple and less menacing than most
suppose. Here are the most commonly offered objections to joining the
Peace Corps:
• I don't speak a foreign language.
Although some knowledge of Spanish or French is desirable, it is
by no means necessary. The Peace Corps teaches you what lingual
skills you'll need.
• I'm not physically strong enough for the training program.
There's a 79-year-old woman serving overseas. She hasn't done a
push-up in years.
• I'm a liberal arts major.
So are 70 per cent of all Volunteers.
• I'm a chemistry Ph.D. I can't afford to spend two years digging
ditches somewhere when I have to advance my career.
How about spending two years teaching chemistry in an overseas
university?
*' I can't afford it.
Although the "hourly pay" is lousy by American standards, Volun
teers receive an allowance to pay for clothing, food, housing, and in
cidental expenses and a readjustment which accrues at the rate of $75
per month for each month of service, including training. You won't
starve, either during service or for sometime after.
• I'll never make it through selection. The requirements are too
tough.
They are. But so are about 45 per cent of those college students who
apply and are accepted.
• I'm a girl.
As are 40 per cent of all Peace Corps Volunteers.
• I'm married.
There are 580 married couples serving overseas. The Peace Corps
just requires that the pair work in the same project and have no de
pendents under 18.
• I don't want to live alone in some remote jungle town.
Don't. You can still join. Volunteers are placed in pairs, unless they
want to be alone. Many work in cities, where they sometimes live
better than they did at home. The mudhut image is just that, real to
only a few.
• I have a girl friend.
Take her with you. You can even serve together, if you can take
it foi two years. (Really.)
• You never hear from the Peace Corps after you apply.
Often a request, sent in, for example, in March, that indicates you'll
be ready in November is put aside while more urgent requests for
June, July or August—are processed. In any event, you'll get a note
within a month telling you what's being done.

• I don't speak a foreign language.
Although some knowledge of Spanish or French is desirable, it is
by no means necessary. The Peace Corps teaches you what lingual
skills you'll need.
• I'm not physically strong enough for the training program.
There's a 79-year-old woman serving overseas. She hasn't done a
push-up in years.
• I'm a liberal arts major.
So are 70 per cent of all Volunteers.
• I'm a chemistry Ph.D. I can't afford to spend two years digging
ditches somewhere when I have to advance my career.
How about spending two years teaching chemistry in an overseas
university?
*' I can't afford it.
Although the "hourly pay" is lousy by American standards, Volun
teers receive an allowance to pay for clothing, food, housing, and in
cidental expenses and a readjustment which accrues at the rate of $75
per month for each month of service, including training. You won't
starve, either during service or for sometime after.
• I'll never make it through selection. The requirements are too
tough.
They are. But so are about 45 per cent of those college students who
apply and are accepted.
• I'm a girl.
As are 40 per cent of all Peace Corps Volunteers.
• I'm married.
There are 580 married couples serving overseas. The Peace Corps
just requires that the pair work in the same project and have no de
pendents under 18.
• I don't want to live alone in some remote jungle town.
Don't. You can still join. Volunteers are placed in pairs, unless they
want to be alone. Many work in cities, where they sometimes live
better than they did at home. The mudhut image is just that, real to
only a few.
• I have a girl friend.
Take her with you. You can even serve together, if you can take
it foi two years. (Really.)
• You never hear from the Peace Corps after you apply.
Often a request, sent in, for example, in March, that indicates you'll
be ready in November is put aside while more urgent requests for
June, July or August—are processed. In any event, you'll get a note
within a month telling you what's being done.

The Peace Corps, like many other governmental organizations, is
plagued by a "knowledge problem." Many people, including a large
number of college students, don't know what the Peace Corps is all
about.
The misconceptions cover almost every phase of Peace Corps activity,
but the truth about the work is simple and less menacing than most
suppose. Here are the most commonly offered objections to joining the
Peace Corps:
• I don't speak a foreign language.
Although some knowledge of Spanish or French is desirable, it is
by no means necessary. The Peace Corps teaches you what lingual
skills you'll need.
