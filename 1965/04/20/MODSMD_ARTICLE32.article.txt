Learning a language in a Peace
Corps training program is a radical
departure from the teaching meth
ods used in most universities.
The entire Peace Corps program
emphasizes a "good grasp" of oral
communication between the Volun
teer and the people he will be work
ing with overseas—and this fluency
must be crammed into a 12-week
training session.
To add to the program's unique
ness, the Peace Corps teaches 20
languages taught nowhere else in
the United States. And, to top it
off, the students realize that the
product is not an abstract grade
but an immediate need to commun
icate with people in that language.
"They learn the languages pri
marily through repetition — and
more repetition," says Miriam
Charnow, who works in Washing
ton on the language program.
The teaching method is called
"intensive." The trainees spend be
tween 290 and 350 hours studying
language in the classroom and the
tape lab during the 12-week session.
The Peace Corps attempts to
have native speakers teaching the
classes whenever possible. In some
languages native speakers try to
be with the trainees constantly—
on field hikes, at meals and during
rest periods. This technique is called
"immersion."
Only when it is absolutely neces
sary does the Peace Corps attempt
to teach the trainees to read and
write a foreign language. The em
phasis is alwavs on direct oral com
munication. The written characters
of the foreign languages are trans
literated into phonetic English.
"We're looking for a fair under
standing and control," says Mrs.
Charnow. "And by control we mean
being able to tell the difference be
tween the various tenses and forms
of nouns. We don't spend any time
teaching grammar itself, but
through repetition a Volunteer
should be able to obtain a struc
tural understanding of grammar."
Of the 12 languages which have

been learned by Peace Corps Volun
teers, 20 have never been taught in
the United States before. These 20,
called exotic languages, have pre
sented unique problems.
In some areas where the lan
guage is unknown to any American,
the Peace Corps sends in a lin
guistic expert, who does not know
the language but is able to inter
pret by inflexions, sounds and pat
terns.
He records representative parts
of the language which are then in
terpreted by persons who have a
general familiarity with that lan
guage group. From these interpre
tations, lab tapes and manuals are
prepared.
The Peace Corps has been de
veloping and intensifying its lan
guage training since the organiza
tion's beginning. The number of
hours spent in language study has
steadily increased until it now fills
• r )0 per cent of the time spent in
training.
The most unusual aspect of the
training is the students themselves.
"The motivation is tremendously
high," says Mrs. Charnow. "It's
something entirely new, the lan
guage itself and the way it is
taught. And it's the one direct
touch with a foreign country they
have while training."
"Excitement is high," Mrs. Char
now' said, "The training does not
have the academic atmosphere. It's
alive. When they leave the language
class, they're still chattering away
in their new language. They sneak
it at dinner, for the fun of it. Most
of all, they realize that within a
few weeks they'll actually be using
this language to communicate with
people."
In those cases where the work
language is English, as it is for
teachers in many of the former
British colonies, the Volunteer is
often taught a local dialect. Where
several major languages are
snoken, as in Nigeria or India, the
Volunteer learns the language
spoken by the people in his area.

have native speakers teaching the
classes whenever possible. In some
languages native speakers try to
be with the trainees constantly—
on field hikes, at meals and during
rest periods. This technique is called
"immersion."
Only when it is absolutely neces
sary does the Peace Corps attempt
to teach the trainees to read and
write a foreign language. The em
phasis is alwavs on direct oral com
munication. The written characters
of the foreign languages are trans
literated into phonetic English.
"We're looking for a fair under
standing and control," says Mrs.
Charnow. "And by control we mean
being able to tell the difference be
tween the various tenses and forms
of nouns. We don't spend any time
teaching grammar itself, but
through repetition a Volunteer
should be able to obtain a struc
tural understanding of grammar."
Of the 12 languages which have

been learned by Peace Corps Volun
teers, 20 have never been taught in
the United States before. These 20,
called exotic languages, have pre
sented unique problems.
In some areas where the lan
guage is unknown to any American,
the Peace Corps sends in a lin
guistic expert, who does not know
the language but is able to inter
pret by inflexions, sounds and pat
terns.
He records representative parts
of the language which are then in
terpreted by persons who have a
general familiarity with that lan
guage group. From these interpre
tations, lab tapes and manuals are
prepared.
The Peace Corps has been de
veloping and intensifying its lan
guage training since the organiza
tion's beginning. The number of
hours spent in language study has
steadily increased until it now fills
• r )0 per cent of the time spent in
training.
The most unusual aspect of the
training is the students themselves.
"The motivation is tremendously
high," says Mrs. Charnow. "It's
something entirely new, the lan
guage itself and the way it is
taught. And it's the one direct
touch with a foreign country they
have while training."
"Excitement is high," Mrs. Char
now' said, "The training does not
have the academic atmosphere. It's
alive. When they leave the language
class, they're still chattering away
in their new language. They sneak
it at dinner, for the fun of it. Most
of all, they realize that within a
few weeks they'll actually be using
this language to communicate with
people."
In those cases where the work
language is English, as it is for
teachers in many of the former
British colonies, the Volunteer is
often taught a local dialect. Where
several major languages are
snoken, as in Nigeria or India, the
Volunteer learns the language
spoken by the people in his area.
Learning a language in a Peace
Corps training program is a radical
departure from the teaching meth
ods used in most universities.
The entire Peace Corps program
emphasizes a "good grasp" of oral
communication between the Volun
teer and the people he will be work
ing with overseas—and this fluency
must be crammed into a 12-week
training session.
To add to the program's unique
ness, the Peace Corps teaches 20
languages taught nowhere else in
the United States. And, to top it
off, the students realize that the
product is not an abstract grade
but an immediate need to commun
icate with people in that language.
"They learn the languages pri
marily through repetition — and
more repetition," says Miriam
Charnow, who works in Washing
ton on the language program.
The teaching method is called
"intensive." The trainees spend be
tween 290 and 350 hours studying
language in the classroom and the
tape lab during the 12-week session.
