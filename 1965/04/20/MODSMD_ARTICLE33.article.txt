# For Trainingâ€” Universities Apply Too
## 
### 
It's not deal' who is following whose lead, but universities as well
as students offer their services to the Peace Corps.
Unlike the students, the universities don't volunteer to go over
seas; they offer to be a training site for those who do.
The process of selecting universities for Peace Corps projects and
helping the schools plan the training program is the job of the University
Relations office of the Peace Corps.
Once a contract has been let to a university and the planning for
a training program begins, the University Relations office works closely
with the school.
"We first select a project director, who is usually a faculty member,"
said Dr. John M. Groebli former Deputy of University Relations. "This
must be someone who is flexible in his approach and is able to draw
from all the resources on a campus."
Because of the relative lack of planning in many developing countries,
the universities are often faced with an abrupt aboutface. A country
that originally requested English teachers suddenly decides that it needs
physical education instructors more desperately. The carefully planned
program has to be adapted to fit the future needs of the Volunteer.
Dr. Groebli believes that the university benefits from the experience,
as does the trainee.
"The trainees are exciting to teach because of their commitment to
what they are doing," he said, "and the faculty is often intrigued
with the exeremely practical aspect of this type of education."
Until recently, the Peace Corps has not been able to select freely
from all the schools in the country when planning training programs.
"We feel that any Volunteer from any place in the country should be
able to use the full resources, not only of the school, but of the town,"
said Dr. Groebli. "We only now feel that the climate is right for using
Southern schools in the training programs.
"This summer, a half a dozen Southern schools will be used as
training centers," said Dr. Groebli.
"In spite of small problems, it is an educational miracle that within
1,450 days, higher education in this country has trained 15,000 people
to go work in 4fi different countries, sneak 42 different languages (many
not regularly taught in the United States) and work at 300 different
jobs," said Dr. Groebli.
