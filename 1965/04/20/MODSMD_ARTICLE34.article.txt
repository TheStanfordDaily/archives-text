# College Juniors Train in Advance
## 
### 
About 800 college juniors will
become the second group to par
ticipate in the Peace Corps' new
Advanced Training Program this
summer.
The new group will be almost
twice as large as the first group,
which is now completing its last
year of college.
Trainees are selected in their
junior year. They go to an eight
week training program that sum
mer then return for their final year
of college during which they're en
couraged to study courses in fields
related to the country where they
will be working.
After graduation, the trainee re
turns for another four or eight
weeks of training, then is sent
overseas.
Last summer's program with 400
students was concentrated into four
main project areas—English and
French-speaking: Africa, and Latin
American rural and urban com
munity projects.
Most of the trainees have en
rolled in classes relating to their
fields of studies.
Of the 134 advanced trainees for
Latin America, 98—80 per cent —
are engaged in Spanish studies.
Over one-half are enrolled in
courses related to Latin American
affairs.
Of the advanced trainees for
French-speaking Africa, 83 per cent
are engaged in continued French
usage at school this year. About a
third of the trainees for all of
Africa are studying courses re
lated to their field.
In the Latin American program
about a third of the trainees are
presently engaged in student teach
ing, social work or some type of
community action project. For those
scheduled to go to Africa, about 40
per cent are now student teaching
or tutoring.
Few of the advanced trainees
have lost interest in the Peace
Corps. Of the 134 who are study
ing for Latin America, seven have
dropped out of the program—six
because they will not graduate in
June and only one because he lost
interest.
Of the 213 in the Africa program
last summer, another seven have
dropped out—one for medical rea
sons, two who will not graduate in
June, three who plan marriage and
one who lost interest.
"We don't really know yet how

many more will drop out before
June. Marriage or scholarships may
come along," Jules Pagano, deputy
director of Training said. "But we
attempted to pickihose who seemed
to have a genuine interest in the
Peace Corps. Their involvement
right now shows us that the pro
gram is in pretty good shape."
The advanced training program
will be expanded next summer to
include Thailand, Iran,' Turkey and
Malaysia.
