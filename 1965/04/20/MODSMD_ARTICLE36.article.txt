# Community Change Goal of Volunteers
## 
### 
Peace Corps community development projects are exactly what the
name implies.
Such projects, concentrated in Latin America, can mean teaching
Peruvians to lay bricks, building an aqueduct in Colombia, or conducting
adult literacy classes in a Brazilian "favella."
One Peace Corps Volunteer working on a community development
project wrote, "I had been sitting on the sidelines for twenty years
watching the world go to pot and nobody asked me to do anything
about it. The Peace Corps did . .
The goals of the community development project are:
• Educating people to work together to define their own goals and
solving the problems necessary to achieve them.
• Getting governments to respond to community needs.
• Achieving material improvement in forms of specific technological
advancement and economic growth.
"The aim of community development is nothing less than a complete
change—reversal or revolution if you wish—in the social, economic,
and political patterns of the country to which we are accredited," said
Frank Mankiewicz, Latin America regional director for the Peace Corps.
The community development project begins with the presence of
the Volunteer in the country.
His first step is getting to know the people—gaining their confidence
This can be done in a variety of ways—organizing baseball teams, teach
ing English classes, visiting, talking or attertding a fiesta.
Next he organizes a community meeting. Volunteers have compared
this to the first day of school—mostly noise and bedlam. Here the
Volunteer tries to get the villagers to discuss their problems. Generally
the most this first meeting can do is arouse in them an interest to meet
again.
Gradually the Volunteer leads the people into discovering their
problems and finding solutions, remembering that some day he won't
be around and they must do it for themselves.
After a problem is recognized and a solution seen, shirt sleeves
are rolled up and the doing begins.
It is in the last stage that the Volunteer sees his success and it may
only be the building of a brick kiln, a chicken coop, or a cleared road.
Community development is hard, mostly because it is like an ice
berg with most of the development remaining beneath the surface.
Mickey Melragon, a returned Peace Corps Volunteer who worked on
the Alto Beni project in Bolivia, wrote about building a brick kiln.
"We realized we needed a project that could be successful, achieved
with a little fun, one which didn't rely on outside assistance, was prac
tical from the colonizers' point of view, and one with an immediate
payoff.
"We started talking it over with people who had experience, how
valuable it could be, how it could be used, etc. This process took a
jittle over a year as the colonizers were busy in their fields.
"But bit by bit they did the work and we were constantly re-defining
and reacting to them. Along the line we had successfully test-fired
and had positive ' 'idence. We then gave everyone two days' experience
with mixing mud and actually making the bricks, cutting wood and
loading the kiln.
Many who objected on the grounds they didn't have the talents
at the end of the day could count 100 real bricks and we could see a
of self confidence, one of the things they lacked.
"Several from this experience continued making bricks which they
could sell.
"This again was a lesson which was hard to bring home. A business
man had to calculate how many days of work it took to make 1,000 crude
bricks, mix mud, gather wood, bum. Many wanted us to hire them as
day laborers, being afraid of assuming responsibility and not having
experience in practical matters."
