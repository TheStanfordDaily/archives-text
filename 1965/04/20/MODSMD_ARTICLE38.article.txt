## Mothers Educated In African Project

Volunteers teaching in the Ivory
Coast "Foyer Feminin" program
may find children attending classes,
but the mothers are the real stu
dents.
The Foyers are special schools,
established by the Ivory Coast gov
ernment, for Ivoirienne women who
have had no previous education.
Directed by the ministry of educa
tion, Foyer classes are concerned
with adult literacy, basic health
and homemaking. At the request of
the government, the Peace Corps
entered this program with seven
Volunteers in 1962. There are now
18 Volunteers working in the Foyer
program, and the government has
requested 15 more.
The Foyers are designed for adult
education, but children are allowed
to tag along as part of a program
to make attendance as easy as

possible for the mothers.
Classrooms are conveniently lo
cated and the women are encour
aged to attend whenever they can,
either in the morning or afternoon
sessions. The schools adjust their
programs to fit the women's needs:
harvesting, daily marketing and
family needs are all considered.
In addition to the basic tools of
reading and writing, meal planning,
child care, sewing instruction and
nutrition are part of the curricu
lum. Some of the Volunteers have
established "causeries culturelles,"
discussion groups in which the
women talk about social and civic
problems.
The Volunteers teach in French,
the national language of the Ivory
Coast, and work under the direction
of an "animatrice," who is an Ivoi
rienne woman who has had a sec
ondary education and some special
training.
Volunteers in the larger, urban
schools have modern equipment to
use in their teaching, but the small

er Foyers do without such things
as electric irons, stoves and sew
ing machines. Sometimes the only
equipment available is chalk and a
blackboard.
In a land where skyscrapers are
visible from small, centuries-old
fishing villages, the Peace Corps
Volunteer is helping the Ivory
Coast fill an educational gap. There
is no American analogy to the Foy
er program, so the Volunteers are
taught the basics of this new ap
proach to education in the training
programs.
A previous knowledge of French
is a great asset for someone apply
ing for the program, but not an
absolute necessity since instruction
in French is a large part of the
training.
The Foyers are informal because
that is the only way they can be
effective, but the rationale behind
the program is a very serious—and
formal—attempt to equip the Ivoi
rienne women for the twentieth
century.
