# Colombia ETV Job Done by Volunteers
## 
### 
Educational television may not be scoring well with all American
teachers, hut pedagogues of the Colombian variety can't get enough of it.
The Peace Corps pilot project in educational TV, which opened up
during 1963 in Colombia, is now reaching about 150,000 students in
Bogota and vicinity, with such subjects as mathematics, natural scien
ces, geography and history.
Two teams of Volunteers inaugurated this mass schooling effort which
will become an integral part of Colombia's national educational system.
The first group of 43 Volunteers, trained at the University of New
Mexico and the University of Nebraska with an equal number of Colom
bians, were television technicians, maintenance and repairmen, pro
grammers, producers, writers and teachers. A second group of 50
Volunteer teachers was assigned to travel to the schools receiving
the broadcasts, acting in general as contacts between the teachers and
the program planners.
More than 800 TV sets supplied by the Agency for International
Development under the Alliance for Progress have been installed
already. By December about 1,400 receivers are expected to be operating,
many in more remote areas.
Volunteer Charles M. Fitch is a director-producer in the program.
His job is to combine the educational concepts delineated by the Colombia
Ministry of Education with modern, lively television-oriented approach to
learning.
"One day we might be filming on the Amazon," he says,"and the
next up in a chilly forest . . . Now, through ETV, the children and
teachers of Colombia are seeing things in their own country which they
never knew were there."
The problems of illiteracy and poor education are so acute in Colombia
that teachers don't look upon the program as an "encroachment." The
program, according to one official, is "remarkable for its acceptance
and the cooperation of the Colombian teachers and students."
