The relationship between service in the Peace Corps and
the draft will remain the same for at least another year.
Although some Congressmen have suggested that Peace
Corps Volunteers should be exempt from military service, no
one plans to introduce a bill to that effect.
A spokesman for the Peace Corps' legal division said, "I
don't think anything will be done on the draft piecemeal.

Congressmen are waiting until the
Pentagon's report is published in
April."
The Pentagon committee is mak
ing a comprehensive investigation
of the draft. Its final report is ex
pected next year. The present se
lective service bill expires in 1967.
Sen. Joseph D. Tydings, (D-Md.)
last October said he would support
legislation changing the draft stat
us of Volunteers who complete two
years of service in the Peace Corps.
"In its own way, the Peace
Corps has contributed as much to
the cause of world peace and na
tional security as has the armed
might of this country. Service in
the Peace Corps and in the domestic
service corps soon to be formed is
considered no less rigorous, arduous
and at times hazardous than is
service in the military," Tydings
said.
However, Tydings said he has no
plans to introduce any legislation

himself.
Presently Peace Corps service
does not fulfill military obligations.
Volunteers have been classified as
being "within the national inter
est," which means that local selec
tive service boards will usually give
deferments.
Like those given to college stu
dents, a deferment does not exempt
the Volunteer from future draft
requirements.
Partly because so many Volun
teers return to school after their
two years of service, few have been
drafted.
Armed forces reservists and Na
tional Guardsmen must complete
their initial period of active duty
before becoming eligible for the
Peace Corps. Those who have week
ly drill or summer camp obliga
tions may have them deferred until
they have returned from the Peace
Corps.
