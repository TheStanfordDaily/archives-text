Peace Corps recruiters are a fun
ny sort.
They'll go to a campus and put
up posters in the library where
those kinds of promotional gim
micks are prohibited. They'll use
two eight-foot tables as a recruit
ing center when restrictions allow
only one four-footer. They'll run
big signs from wall to wall when
the administration limits them to
a three-foot space.
In the words of one Peace Corps
official, "we do as much as they will
let us get away with." They do.
Peace Corps recruiting is not
done by professionals, per se. Every
staff member at Washington head
quarters, in fact, is responsible for
putting in a yearly recruiting stint
of up to four weeks. This includes
Sargent Shriver himself. And bet
ter than 80 per cent of this work
is done at college campuses, the
biggest source of Volunteers.
Peace Corps recruiters like to
have fun and still do a job. "We
try not to take ourselves too seri
ously," one veteran recruiter says.
"This offends some people but it
works, because there is a great
deal of seriousness underneath it
all."
Recruiters stay in their booth all
day long, often on their feet from
8 a.m. to 11 p.m. "This creates a
psychological impact," Recruiting
Director Robert Gale says. "Keep
ing the booths open all the time
gets people to think of the deter
mination these people have. The en
thusiasm is catching."
