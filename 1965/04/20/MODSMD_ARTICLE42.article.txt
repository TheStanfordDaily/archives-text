Dead or alive, sharks can be a
problem.
The dead variety was a problem
for a Volunteer in the Dominican
Republic. With the help of the
Volunteer Support Officer in Wash
ington, he learned that one con
structive means of disposal is to
make walking canes out of the
backbone of the sharks.
The Support Office handles re
quests from Volunteers all over the
world. However, most of these re
quests are a good deal less exotic
than the shark problem.
The requests for visual aids for
teaching, queries about lost mail
or a plea for information are all
forwarded to this office.
One Volunteer wanted a recipe
for cooking cactus. Another wanted
to know how to grow cashew nuts.
The growing procedure was even
tually routed to the Volunteer from
India, rather than from the United
States, because cashew nuts are not
regularly grown here.
A Volunteer in Latin America
stumped the Washington office—
and several other organizations—
with his request for instructions on
how to build a kerosene-run egg
incubator.
Hatchery groups, egg associa
tions and the Department of Agri
culture had no answer to his prob
lem because that particular type
of method had not been used in
the United States for over 50 years.
Eventually a hatchery came up
with an alternate plan for an incu
bator that didn't run on kerosene,
but it produced results—and chick
ens.
