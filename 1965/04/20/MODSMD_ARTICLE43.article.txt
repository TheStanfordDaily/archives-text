# Four Wheels To Two: A Study In Austerity
## 
### 
It was to be Spartan in character,
an organization where service
would replace status, built from top
to bottom on the word "Volunteer."
This was the atmosphere in which
the Peace Corps was born and
through the organization's growing
pains, the staff has worked hard
to maintain the austerity which
made the undertaking something
special. Considering the increasing
size of the Peace Corps, the effort
has required constant evaluation
and adjustment.
One particular area which has
caused a few problems has been
that of vehicles for the Volunteers
working overseas.
As Kevin Delany, project eval
uator, explained the situation, the
guideline of the Peace Corps was
to deal with people, not things. In
spite of this, there was a rush in
the beginning to supply the Volun
teers with essentials, some of which
subsequently proved to be non-es
sential.
"There was a general revulsion
to this type of approach," said De
lany, "not only among the staff,
but the Volunteers."
The provision of vehicles for Vol
unteers was one of the areas which
was reconsidered.
As of Dec. 31, 1963, there were
either on hand or on order 835
four-wheel vehicles overseas, 175
for administrators and 670 for Vol
unteers' use.
These vehicles cost a total of $2.5
million, according to an evaluation
Delany did.
"We decided that this was a lot
of money to spend for something
that was causing us a lot of trou
ble," said Delany. There had been
many accidents involving Volun
teers' vehicles.
Delany explained that the situa
tion was re-evaluated and there was
a cut in the number of vehicles
issued to Volunteers.
"We changed our approach on
the matter," he explained. "Where
as our first question used to be
whether a car or small truck was
needed, we now ask first whether it
is possible for the Volunteer to
walk and still do his job.
"Our entire approach to the mat
ter has changed," he said.
Delany explained that many
times a simple vehicle such as a
bicycle will do an adequate job for
the Volunteer. In Nepal, any ve
hicle is impractical. Volunteers do
all their traveling by foot, some
times walking for days at a time
to reach their destination.
In situations where vehicles are
necessary to a Volunteer's job, they
are provided as a matter of fact.
"If a Volunteer is in an isolated
area and a vehicle is essential to
getting groceries or teaching, then
there is no hesitation," said Delany.
"We have only tried to cut out the
unnecessary expenses."
The number of staff vehicles has
also been cut down where possible.
The Division of Management in
the Washington headquarters es
timated that, although complete fig
ures for the end of 1964 were not
yet available, the number of four
wheel vehicles was about the same
as it was a year ago. Because the
number of Volunteers and projects
has increased in the past year, this
indicated a proportionately smaller
number of vehicles per Volunteer.
The cut-back in the ratio of ve
hicles to Volunteers was not purely
an economic measure. It was an at
tempt to maintain and develop the
original ideals of the Peace Corps
and make the Volunteers work as
efficient as possible.
There were three primary rea
sons along this line for the cut
back, according to Delany.
The most pressing was the dan
ger element involved concerning the
Volunteer.
The second was that the vehicles
sometimes prevented two of the
objectives of the Peace Corps from
being fulfilled. These objectives are:

to help promote a better under
standing of the American people
on the part of the peoples served
and to help promote a better under
standing of other peoples on the
part of the American people.
Delany explained that Volunteers
would sometimes use the vehicles
as props to bring prestige to them
selves and gain a preferred position
in the local community.
"The jeep would give a boss
image to the Volunteer which was
not desirable," said Delany. "This
sometimes tended to create resent
ment toward the Volunteer.
"Because the jeeps were painted
baby-blue, they would be especially
easy to identify," he said.
Having a vehicle also made it
easy for the Volunteer to get away
from the local community when he
was frustrated. This meant that
rather than staying and becoming
involved in local projects and work
ing out the problems, there was a
tendency to escape to the company
of other Volunteers.
In a report on the Dominican
Republic, one evaluator stated that
vehicles created more problems
than they were worth in many
cases.
He wrote that the Volunteers
in the Dominican Republic were
generally unhappy about the ve
hicle situation, although many had

built their programs around them.
Delaney said: "Automobiles are
an extension of the American im
age. As long as a Volunteer drives
a car, it is difficult for him to feel
like a Volunteer. He has a difficult
time acclimating himself to the (
local people.
"We also felt that too many
vehicles would seem like just an
other thing from America. The
Peace Corps isn't interested in
creating that type of feeling."
Vehicles are necessary to many
projects. Teachers and nurses iw
the Peace Corps often find that
their assignments require them to
travel to many villages in a cer
tain area.
The whole process of evaluation
in the Peace Co»*ps is to see that
the job is done most efficiently, and
continuous evaluation is necessary
to keep such a diversified organi
zation effective.
The four-wheel vehicle situation
is only one instance where evalu
ation leads to improvement. The
Peace Corps is dedicated to work
ing with people. As one Volunteer
in Nigeria wrote, "Volunteers who
have cars are the ones who don'..-
know anybody; the ones with bi
cycles are the ones who know more
Nigerians than anyone else."
It's only a small difference—
from four to two wheels—but an
important one.

million, according to an evaluation
Delany did.
"We decided that this was a lot
of money to spend for something
that was causing us a lot of trou
ble," said Delany. There had been
many accidents involving Volun
teers' vehicles.
Delany explained that the situa
tion was re-evaluated and there was
a cut in the number of vehicles
issued to Volunteers.
"We changed our approach on
the matter," he explained. "Where
as our first question used to be
whether a car or small truck was
needed, we now ask first whether it
is possible for the Volunteer to
walk and still do his job.
"Our entire approach to the mat
ter has changed," he said.
Delany explained that many
times a simple vehicle such as a
bicycle will do an adequate job for
the Volunteer. In Nepal, any ve
hicle is impractical. Volunteers do
all their traveling by foot, some
times walking for days at a time
to reach their destination.
In situations where vehicles are
necessary to a Volunteer's job, they
are provided as a matter of fact.
"If a Volunteer is in an isolated
area and a vehicle is essential to
getting groceries or teaching, then
there is no hesitation," said Delany.
"We have only tried to cut out the
unnecessary expenses."
The number of staff vehicles has
also been cut down where possible.
The Division of Management in
the Washington headquarters es
timated that, although complete fig
ures for the end of 1964 were not
yet available, the number of four
wheel vehicles was about the same
as it was a year ago. Because the
number of Volunteers and projects
has increased in the past year, this
indicated a proportionately smaller
number of vehicles per Volunteer.
The cut-back in the ratio of ve
hicles to Volunteers was not purely
an economic measure. It was an at
tempt to maintain and develop the
original ideals of the Peace Corps
and make the Volunteers work as
efficient as possible.
There were three primary rea
sons along this line for the cut
back, according to Delany.
The most pressing was the dan
ger element involved concerning the
Volunteer.
The second was that the vehicles
sometimes prevented two of the
objectives of the Peace Corps from
being fulfilled. These objectives are:

to help promote a better under
standing of the American people
on the part of the peoples served
and to help promote a better under
standing of other peoples on the
part of the American people.
Delany explained that Volunteers
would sometimes use the vehicles
as props to bring prestige to them
selves and gain a preferred position
in the local community.
"The jeep would give a boss
image to the Volunteer which was
not desirable," said Delany. "This
sometimes tended to create resent
ment toward the Volunteer.
"Because the jeeps were painted
baby-blue, they would be especially
easy to identify," he said.
Having a vehicle also made it
easy for the Volunteer to get away
from the local community when he
was frustrated. This meant that
rather than staying and becoming
involved in local projects and work
ing out the problems, there was a
tendency to escape to the company
of other Volunteers.
In a report on the Dominican
Republic, one evaluator stated that
vehicles created more problems
than they were worth in many
cases.
He wrote that the Volunteers
in the Dominican Republic were
generally unhappy about the ve
hicle situation, although many had

built their programs around them.
Delaney said: "Automobiles are
an extension of the American im
age. As long as a Volunteer drives
a car, it is difficult for him to feel
like a Volunteer. He has a difficult
time acclimating himself to the (
local people.
"We also felt that too many
vehicles would seem like just an
other thing from America. The
Peace Corps isn't interested in
creating that type of feeling."
Vehicles are necessary to many
projects. Teachers and nurses iw
the Peace Corps often find that
their assignments require them to
travel to many villages in a cer
tain area.
The whole process of evaluation
in the Peace Co»*ps is to see that
the job is done most efficiently, and
continuous evaluation is necessary
to keep such a diversified organi
zation effective.
The four-wheel vehicle situation
is only one instance where evalu
ation leads to improvement. The
Peace Corps is dedicated to work
ing with people. As one Volunteer
in Nigeria wrote, "Volunteers who
have cars are the ones who don'..-
know anybody; the ones with bi
cycles are the ones who know more
Nigerians than anyone else."
It's only a small difference—
from four to two wheels—but an
important one.


A Peace Corps jeep fords a stream in the Dominican Republic,
It was to be Spartan in character,
an organization where service
would replace status, built from top
to bottom on the word "Volunteer."
This was the atmosphere in which
the Peace Corps was born and
through the organization's growing
pains, the staff has worked hard
to maintain the austerity which
made the undertaking something
special. Considering the increasing
size of the Peace Corps, the effort
has required constant evaluation
and adjustment.
One particular area which has
caused a few problems has been
that of vehicles for the Volunteers
working overseas.
As Kevin Delany, project eval
uator, explained the situation, the
guideline of the Peace Corps was
to deal with people, not things. In
spite of this, there was a rush in
the beginning to supply the Volun
teers with essentials, some of which
subsequently proved to be non-es
sential.
"There was a general revulsion
to this type of approach," said De
lany, "not only among the staff,
but the Volunteers."
The provision of vehicles for Vol
unteers was one of the areas which
was reconsidered.
As of Dec. 31, 1963, there were
either on hand or on order 835
four-wheel vehicles overseas, 175
for administrators and 670 for Vol
unteers' use.
These vehicles cost a total of $2.5
million, according to an evaluation
Delany did.

the Washington headquarters es
timated that, although complete fig
ures for the end of 1964 were not
yet available, the number of four
wheel vehicles was about the same
as it was a year ago. Because the
number of Volunteers and projects
has increased in the past year, this
indicated a proportionately smaller
number of vehicles per Volunteer.
The cut-back in the ratio of ve
hicles to Volunteers was not purely
an economic measure. It was an at
tempt to maintain and develop the
original ideals of the Peace Corps
and make the Volunteers work as
efficient as possible.
There were three primary rea
sons along this line for the cut
back, according to Delany.
The most pressing was the dan
ger element involved concerning the
Volunteer.
The second was that the vehicles
sometimes prevented two of the
objectives of the Peace Corps from
being fulfilled. These objectives are:

to help promote a better under
standing of the American people
on the part of the peoples served
and to help promote a better under
standing of other peoples on the
part of the American people.
Delany explained that Volunteers
would sometimes use the vehicles
as props to bring prestige to them
selves and gain a preferred position
in the local community.
"The jeep would give a boss
image to the Volunteer which was
not desirable," said Delany. "This
sometimes tended to create resent
ment toward the Volunteer.
"Because the jeeps were painted
baby-blue, they would be especially
easy to identify," he said.
Having a vehicle also made it
easy for the Volunteer to get away
from the local community when he
was frustrated. This meant that
rather than staying and becoming
involved in local projects and work
ing out the problems, there was a
tendency to escape to the company
of other Volunteers.
In a report on the Dominican
Republic, one evaluator stated that
vehicles created more problems
than they were worth in many
cases.
He wrote that the Volunteers
in the Dominican Republic were
generally unhappy about the ve
hicle situation, although many had

built their programs around them.
Delaney said: "Automobiles are
an extension of the American im
age. As long as a Volunteer drives
a car, it is difficult for him to feel
like a Volunteer. He has a difficult
time acclimating himself to the (
local people.
"We also felt that too many
vehicles would seem like just an
other thing from America. The
Peace Corps isn't interested in
creating that type of feeling."
Vehicles are necessary to many
projects. Teachers and nurses iw
the Peace Corps often find that
their assignments require them to
travel to many villages in a cer
tain area.
The whole process of evaluation
in the Peace Co»*ps is to see that
the job is done most efficiently, and
continuous evaluation is necessary
to keep such a diversified organi
zation effective.
The four-wheel vehicle situation
is only one instance where evalu
ation leads to improvement. The
Peace Corps is dedicated to work
ing with people. As one Volunteer
in Nigeria wrote, "Volunteers who
have cars are the ones who don'..-
know anybody; the ones with bi
cycles are the ones who know more
Nigerians than anyone else."
It's only a small difference—
from four to two wheels—but an
important one.


A Peace Corps jeep fords a stream in the Dominican Republic,
It was to be Spartan in character,
an organization where service
would replace status, built from top
to bottom on the word "Volunteer."
This was the atmosphere in which
the Peace Corps was born and
through the organization's growing
pains, the staff has worked hard
to maintain the austerity which
made the undertaking something
special. Considering the increasing
size of the Peace Corps, the effort
has required constant evaluation
and adjustment.
One particular area which has
caused a few problems has been
that of vehicles for the Volunteers
working overseas.
As Kevin Delany, project eval
uator, explained the situation, the
guideline of the Peace Corps was
to deal with people, not things. In
spite of this, there was a rush in
the beginning to supply the Volun
teers with essentials, some of which
subsequently proved to be non-es
sential.
"There was a general revulsion
to this type of approach," said De
lany, "not only among the staff,
but the Volunteers."
The provision of vehicles for Vol
unteers was one of the areas which
was reconsidered.
As of Dec. 31, 1963, there were
either on hand or on order 835
four-wheel vehicles overseas, 175
for administrators and 670 for Vol
unteers' use.
These vehicles cost a total of $2.5
million, according to an evaluation
Delany did.
"We decided that this was a lot
of money to spend for something
that was causing us a lot of trou
ble," said Delany. There had been
many accidents involving Volun
teers' vehicles.
Delany explained that the situa
tion was re-evaluated and there was
a cut in the number of vehicles
issued to Volunteers.
"We changed our approach on
the matter," he explained. "Where
as our first question used to be
whether a car or small truck was
needed, we now ask first whether it
is possible for the Volunteer to
walk and still do his job.
"Our entire approach to the mat
ter has changed," he said.
Delany explained that many
times a simple vehicle such as a
bicycle will do an adequate job for
the Volunteer. In Nepal, any ve
hicle is impractical. Volunteers do
all their traveling by foot, some
times walking for days at a time
to reach their destination.
In situations where vehicles are
necessary to a Volunteer's job, they
are provided as a matter of fact.
"If a Volunteer is in an isolated
area and a vehicle is essential to
getting groceries or teaching, then
there is no hesitation," said Delany.
"We have only tried to cut out the
unnecessary expenses."
The number of staff vehicles has
also been cut down where possible.
The Division of Management in
the Washington headquarters es
