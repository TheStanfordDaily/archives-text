# MacKenzie Discusses The Issues
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
"The biggest issue in U.S. higher edu
cation today," Sandy MacKenzie, candi
date for ASSU President, told The Daily,
"is whether universities are going to ad
minister education to passive students or
whether students are going to actively
participate in the decision-making proc
esses of the university community."
MacKenzie, a senior history major,
added, "That's not to say students arc
to make the decisions, . . . but student
opinions must be considered to make
these decisions valid."
No Withering 1 Away
The candidate stressed that this did
not mean he was opposed to the Admin
istration. "It's patently absurd to say
that the Administration will and should
wither away. ... It is up to us, the
faculty and students, to make sure it
does not become a force to preserve the
status quo but only to provide a neces
sary stability and to serve as a basis for
progress."

pendent Executive" to complement the
increasingly powerful student legisla
ture, MacKenzie suggested several ways
in which the ASSU President could serve
as a catalyst to bring about both a
"broad understanding and consensus in
the university community."
• The ASSU President should meet
with the Board of Trustees each quarter
to represent the student body.
• More students should bo placed on
the various President's Committees so as
to play a "creative role" in the decision
making process and not a "carping role"
after the decision is announced. These

students would form a Presidential Ad
visory Council to meet once each month
with the ASSU President. Moreover, he
would like to see the means of choosing
these students revised to reflect the
wishes of the Executive and the Legisla
ture instead of the President of the Uni
versity.
ASSU Special Commissions
• The ASSU President should have
several special commissions to investi
gate complex problems such as utiliza
tion and procedures of the library sys
tem, problems that Legislature commit
tees "have neither the time nor interest
to investigate."
Though he praised the development of
the Legislature, the candidate warned
that more than one "active group" is
needed in that body. It was clear that
he hoped to make the ASSU President a
"more forceful personality" in LASSU,
since that official represents the execu
tive branch of the government as well
as the student contingent on several ad
ministrative committees.

Moreover, MacKenzie said that his run
ning mate, junior Clark Brown, would
use his office as Vice-President to scn*vc
as a liaison between the various ASSU
Boards and Commissions and the Legis
lature.
A "Philosopher-Kin#''
Finally, the candidate joked about the
charge that he was more a "philosopher
king" than an administrative leader. He
noted that he has held various offices in
Stern, that he is currently one of 10 na
tional supervisors of the National Stu
dent Association <NSA>, that he worked
for former ASSU President Bud Wedin
as campaign manager and later as ad
ministrative assistant, that he has been
a member of several Presidential com
mittees such as the Committee on Public
Exercises, and that he spent one sum
mer in Guinea for Crossroads Africa.
Ho also was quick to squelch one of
the first rumors of the campaign. He by
no means advocates a "draw system" for
men's housing. "It's just not feasible
hene."

pendent Executive" to complement the
increasingly powerful student legisla
ture, MacKenzie suggested several ways
in which the ASSU President could serve
as a catalyst to bring about both a
"broad understanding and consensus in
the university community."
• The ASSU President should meet
with the Board of Trustees each quarter
to represent the student body.
• More students should bo placed on
the various President's Committees so as
to play a "creative role" in the decision
making process and not a "carping role"
after the decision is announced. These

students would form a Presidential Ad
visory Council to meet once each month
with the ASSU President. Moreover, he
would like to see the means of choosing
these students revised to reflect the
wishes of the Executive and the Legisla
ture instead of the President of the Uni
versity.
ASSU Special Commissions
• The ASSU President should have
several special commissions to investi
gate complex problems such as utiliza
tion and procedures of the library sys
tem, problems that Legislature commit
tees "have neither the time nor interest
to investigate."
Though he praised the development of
the Legislature, the candidate warned
that more than one "active group" is
needed in that body. It was clear that
he hoped to make the ASSU President a
"more forceful personality" in LASSU,
since that official represents the execu
tive branch of the government as well
as the student contingent on several ad
ministrative committees.

Moreover, MacKenzie said that his run
ning mate, junior Clark Brown, would
use his office as Vice-President to scn*vc
as a liaison between the various ASSU
Boards and Commissions and the Legis
lature.
A "Philosopher-Kin#''
Finally, the candidate joked about the
charge that he was more a "philosopher
king" than an administrative leader. He
noted that he has held various offices in
Stern, that he is currently one of 10 na
tional supervisors of the National Stu
dent Association <NSA>, that he worked
for former ASSU President Bud Wedin
as campaign manager and later as ad
ministrative assistant, that he has been
a member of several Presidential com
mittees such as the Committee on Public
Exercises, and that he spent one sum
mer in Guinea for Crossroads Africa.
Ho also was quick to squelch one of
the first rumors of the campaign. He by
no means advocates a "draw system" for
men's housing. "It's just not feasible
hene."
"The biggest issue in U.S. higher edu
cation today," Sandy MacKenzie, candi
date for ASSU President, told The Daily,
"is whether universities are going to ad
minister education to passive students or
whether students are going to actively
participate in the decision-making proc
esses of the university community."
MacKenzie, a senior history major,
added, "That's not to say students arc
to make the decisions, . . . but student
opinions must be considered to make
these decisions valid."
No Withering 1 Away
The candidate stressed that this did
not mean he was opposed to the Admin
istration. "It's patently absurd to say
that the Administration will and should
wither away. ... It is up to us, the
faculty and students, to make sure it
does not become a force to preserve the
status quo but only to provide a neces
sary stability and to serve as a basis for
