# Student Returns from Czechoslovakian Jail
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS 
"I was just sitting there, meshed up in the gears of Czechoslova
kian law,' said John Bacon of his three months in solitary eonfine
ment in a Czeehoslovakian jail.
Baeon, a junior biology major w ho finished six months at Stan
ford-in-CJermany in December, was released April 10. Ile had been

arrested January 17 for trying to
smuggle an East German student
from Czechoslovakia to West Ger
many.
Baeon mot the 24-year-old Ber
lin College of Music student
whose name he won't reveal in
Berlin. Although the question of
an escape didn't come up at first.
Bacon "decided at ihe first meet
ing that he was the kind of per
son I would want, to help."
They decided to try the escape
from Czechoslovakia rather than
East Germany since it was easier
for Bacon 1o get into Czechoslo
vakia. Bacon rented a car in West
Germany and, after hollowing out
the underneath portion of the
rear seat, met the student in Pil
sen "about 45 miles from the
border."
At the border, two guards!
checked the car. One made a cur
sory inspection, Bacon said, but
the other—feeling the German's
leg under the seat—started yell
ing "something like 'Here's my
Brownie points for the day.' "
Taken first to a military instal
lation and then to Pilsen prison,
Bacon was questioned several
times a week for three to four
hours at a stretch during his first
three weeks there.
He spent almost two months in
jail before coming to trial March
12. Tried in front of a three-judge
panel and defended by a court
appointed attorney, he was sen
tenced to three months in prison.
Mild Sentence
"Actually, I was treated very
mildly," Bacon said. "I could have
received anywhere from six
months to five years."
His high-ceilinged cell, which he
said measured about 7 by 12 feet,
had a frosted glass window (with
bars), a peephole in the door for
the guards, lavatory facilities,
several straw mattresses, chairs,
a table and a bare light bulb that
burned continuously.
The food was "never very ap
petizing," commented Bacon of
his three meals a day, but "it
didn't taste bad, though." The
meals included meat "about two
or three times a week almost in
variably pork."
Walks and Books
He was allowed a daily 15-min
ute exercise walk in the prison
courtyard, and also did calisthen
ics in his cell. He lost "a couple j
of pounds more due to nervous- i
ness" than food. To occupy his j
time he read "books from the!
prison library in German" -rang-1
ing from Walter Ulbricht to a !
short novel by Goethe.
Although he had no touch with j

the outside world, his guards told
him of "three major world
j events:" the death of Winston
. Churchill, the success of the Gem
j ini space shot and the proposed
I visit by President Johnson to the
; Kremlin "sometime this year."
I The guards, who spoke German,
! were "insane" about ice hockey
| and frequently told Bacon the
; results of games.
; His April 10 relase was a week
I short of his sentence expiration
j date as a result of his request
for an expulsion hearing.
Now back attending classes, he
terms his stay " a very visible
demonstration of the Iron Cur
tain," and says of the escape at
tempt "I think I was naive to
| think 1 could get away with it."

JOHN BACON
"I was just sitting there, meshed up in the gears of Czechoslova
kian law,' said John Bacon of his three months in solitary eonfine
ment in a Czeehoslovakian jail.
Baeon, a junior biology major w ho finished six months at Stan
ford-in-CJermany in December, was released April 10. Ile had been

arrested January 17 for trying to
smuggle an East German student
from Czechoslovakia to West Ger
many.
Baeon mot the 24-year-old Ber
lin College of Music student
whose name he won't reveal in
Berlin. Although the question of
an escape didn't come up at first.
Bacon "decided at ihe first meet
ing that he was the kind of per
son I would want, to help."
They decided to try the escape
from Czechoslovakia rather than
East Germany since it was easier
for Bacon 1o get into Czechoslo
vakia. Bacon rented a car in West
Germany and, after hollowing out
the underneath portion of the
rear seat, met the student in Pil
sen "about 45 miles from the
border."
At the border, two guards!
checked the car. One made a cur
sory inspection, Bacon said, but
the other—feeling the German's
leg under the seat—started yell
ing "something like 'Here's my
Brownie points for the day.' "
Taken first to a military instal
lation and then to Pilsen prison,
Bacon was questioned several
times a week for three to four
hours at a stretch during his first
three weeks there.
He spent almost two months in
jail before coming to trial March
12. Tried in front of a three-judge
panel and defended by a court
appointed attorney, he was sen
tenced to three months in prison.
Mild Sentence
"Actually, I was treated very
mildly," Bacon said. "I could have
received anywhere from six
months to five years."
His high-ceilinged cell, which he
said measured about 7 by 12 feet,
had a frosted glass window (with
bars), a peephole in the door for
the guards, lavatory facilities,
several straw mattresses, chairs,
a table and a bare light bulb that
burned continuously.
The food was "never very ap
petizing," commented Bacon of
his three meals a day, but "it
didn't taste bad, though." The
meals included meat "about two
or three times a week almost in
variably pork."
Walks and Books
