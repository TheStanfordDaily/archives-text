# Magnuson: Ambivalent, Ambiguous, Yet Serious
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
"I can't really get too excited about stu
dent government," says Roger Magnuson,
Sports Editor of The Daily and candidate for
the presidency of the ASSU. "I witnessed my
first student council election in ninth grade,
and can't say that the tenor of them has
changed much over the years."
In an interview with The Daily yesterday,
the sophomore General Studies "major" de
tailed the essence of his campaign, which, he
said, is "based on a firm belief that an am
bivalent, ambiguous president is the only hope
for Stanford's deracinated masses."
Sizes Ip Campaign
In sizing up his campaign, Magnuson sees
the student body as being divided into four
elements "transcending all political partisan
ship":
• The "sulk" element, which he subdivides
into the "deep depression wing" and the "brood
wing." The students included in this group,

his appeals for support to this vast, silent
majority.
according to Magnuson, "are kind of self
evident."
• The "rave" element, "marked by un
shakable commitment."
• The "bleeding heart" element, which, he
said, leans toward his philosophy of ambiva
lence.
• The "healthy ambivalent" element, char
acterized by "very insignificant turnouts at
ASSU elections."
Magnuson includes himself in this fourth
division. He rarely votes.
The candidate noted that "whereas the
last group constitutes the majority of the
students at Stanford, the first three contain
almost in entirety the people in student gov
ernment. The ASSU is really too important
to be intrusted to these three philosophical
groups, who represent to me a sort of creep
ing mesocephalism."
Consequently, Magnuson plans to direct

The candidates have announced their meal

"If everyone voted, I would come out far
ahead," he asserted.
Will Run Now, Think Later
Magnuson said that he had not yet given
much thought to the issues, as he has "nine
teen units to attend."
"This is why I am conducting basically a
front porch campaign," he explained. "If I am
elected, I'll think harder about the issues."

He did say that he thought LASSU should
assert itself on off-campus issues. He sug
gested that the Legislature might, for in
stance, pass a resolution condemning neck
ing in moving cars—"but only applying when
those automobiles are off-campus."
As president, the candidate says that he
would advocate, among other things:
• Creating a parking lot under the Quad.
• Raising the age of consent on campus
to 21, but making it mandatory.
• Making Captain Midnight a professor
emeritus of police science, with the provision
that he be buried in the Mausoleum when he
dies, if not before.
Vice-Presidential Compromise
Magnuson has yet to be introduced to his
vice-presidential running mate, junior George
Soule, but he says he plans to meet him next
year if they are elected.
He originally intended to have a fresh
man woman run with him in order to balance
his ticket, but switched to the less glamorous

Soule in exchange for an endorsement from
Steve Gruber, former ASSU presidential can
didate and presently a student at Orange Coast
Junior College, who was on campus last week.
Magnuson stated that he had considered
running on a write-in ticket. "I soon decided,
however, that I ought to meet the apathy of
my supporters half way, realizing that writ
ing in the name of a candidate is quite
essentially nonambivalent."
ASSU "Might Atrophy"
In line with his policy of ambivalence, Mag
nuson refused to comment on the charge that
he is running in serious protest over the popu
lar concept of student government.
The candidate stated that he does not ad
vocate immediate abolition of the ASSU, but
says that he "might let it atrophy."
He said, too, that he is "serious about being
nonserious," and concluded, in answer to an
other charge: "I'm not really sure what "RF"
means, but I feel I'm not that type of candi
date."

In sizing up his campaign, Magnuson sees
the student body as being divided into four
elements "transcending all political partisan
ship":
• The "sulk" element, which he subdivides
into the "deep depression wing" and the "brood
wing." The students included in this group,

his appeals for support to this vast, silent
majority.
according to Magnuson, "are kind of self
evident."
• The "rave" element, "marked by un
shakable commitment."
• The "bleeding heart" element, which, he
said, leans toward his philosophy of ambiva
lence.
• The "healthy ambivalent" element, char
acterized by "very insignificant turnouts at
ASSU elections."
Magnuson includes himself in this fourth
division. He rarely votes.
The candidate noted that "whereas the
last group constitutes the majority of the
students at Stanford, the first three contain
almost in entirety the people in student gov
ernment. The ASSU is really too important
to be intrusted to these three philosophical
groups, who represent to me a sort of creep
ing mesocephalism."
Consequently, Magnuson plans to direct

The candidates have announced their meal

"If everyone voted, I would come out far
ahead," he asserted.
Will Run Now, Think Later
Magnuson said that he had not yet given
much thought to the issues, as he has "nine
teen units to attend."
"This is why I am conducting basically a
front porch campaign," he explained. "If I am
elected, I'll think harder about the issues."

He did say that he thought LASSU should
assert itself on off-campus issues. He sug
gested that the Legislature might, for in
stance, pass a resolution condemning neck
ing in moving cars—"but only applying when
those automobiles are off-campus."
As president, the candidate says that he
would advocate, among other things:
• Creating a parking lot under the Quad.
• Raising the age of consent on campus
to 21, but making it mandatory.
• Making Captain Midnight a professor
emeritus of police science, with the provision
that he be buried in the Mausoleum when he
dies, if not before.
Vice-Presidential Compromise
Magnuson has yet to be introduced to his
vice-presidential running mate, junior George
Soule, but he says he plans to meet him next
year if they are elected.
He originally intended to have a fresh
man woman run with him in order to balance
his ticket, but switched to the less glamorous

Soule in exchange for an endorsement from
Steve Gruber, former ASSU presidential can
didate and presently a student at Orange Coast
Junior College, who was on campus last week.
Magnuson stated that he had considered
running on a write-in ticket. "I soon decided,
however, that I ought to meet the apathy of
my supporters half way, realizing that writ
ing in the name of a candidate is quite
essentially nonambivalent."
ASSU "Might Atrophy"
In line with his policy of ambivalence, Mag
nuson refused to comment on the charge that
he is running in serious protest over the popu
lar concept of student government.
The candidate stated that he does not ad
vocate immediate abolition of the ASSU, but
says that he "might let it atrophy."
He said, too, that he is "serious about being
nonserious," and concluded, in answer to an
other charge: "I'm not really sure what "RF"
means, but I feel I'm not that type of candi
date."
"I can't really get too excited about stu
dent government," says Roger Magnuson,
Sports Editor of The Daily and candidate for
the presidency of the ASSU. "I witnessed my
first student council election in ninth grade,
and can't say that the tenor of them has
changed much over the years."
In an interview with The Daily yesterday,
the sophomore General Studies "major" de
tailed the essence of his campaign, which, he
said, is "based on a firm belief that an am
bivalent, ambiguous president is the only hope
for Stanford's deracinated masses."

acterized by "very insignificant turnouts at
ASSU elections."
Magnuson includes himself in this fourth
division. He rarely votes.
The candidate noted that "whereas the
last group constitutes the majority of the
students at Stanford, the first three contain
almost in entirety the people in student gov
ernment. The ASSU is really too important
to be intrusted to these three philosophical
groups, who represent to me a sort of creep
ing mesocephalism."
Consequently, Magnuson plans to direct

The candidates have announced their meal

"If everyone voted, I would come out far
ahead," he asserted.
Will Run Now, Think Later
Magnuson said that he had not yet given
much thought to the issues, as he has "nine
teen units to attend."
"This is why I am conducting basically a
front porch campaign," he explained. "If I am
elected, I'll think harder about the issues."

He did say that he thought LASSU should
assert itself on off-campus issues. He sug
gested that the Legislature might, for in
stance, pass a resolution condemning neck
ing in moving cars—"but only applying when
those automobiles are off-campus."
As president, the candidate says that he
would advocate, among other things:
• Creating a parking lot under the Quad.
• Raising the age of consent on campus
to 21, but making it mandatory.
• Making Captain Midnight a professor
emeritus of police science, with the provision
that he be buried in the Mausoleum when he
dies, if not before.
Vice-Presidential Compromise
Magnuson has yet to be introduced to his
vice-presidential running mate, junior George
Soule, but he says he plans to meet him next
year if they are elected.
He originally intended to have a fresh
man woman run with him in order to balance
his ticket, but switched to the less glamorous

Soule in exchange for an endorsement from
Steve Gruber, former ASSU presidential can
didate and presently a student at Orange Coast
Junior College, who was on campus last week.
Magnuson stated that he had considered
running on a write-in ticket. "I soon decided,
however, that I ought to meet the apathy of
my supporters half way, realizing that writ
ing in the name of a candidate is quite
essentially nonambivalent."
ASSU "Might Atrophy"
In line with his policy of ambivalence, Mag
nuson refused to comment on the charge that
he is running in serious protest over the popu
lar concept of student government.
The candidate stated that he does not ad
vocate immediate abolition of the ASSU, but
says that he "might let it atrophy."
He said, too, that he is "serious about being
nonserious," and concluded, in answer to an
other charge: "I'm not really sure what "RF"
means, but I feel I'm not that type of candi
date."
