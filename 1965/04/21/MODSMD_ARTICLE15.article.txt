## Conference Football Schedules Masochistic 
### Pete King 
The football schedules for next fall have arrived, and for sheer
[unadulterated masochism, no conference can approach I he, Pacific
i Athletic. California, Oregon State, UCLA, and Washington State all
; have murderous schedules, while Stanford and USC have roamed far
afield for tough opponents, although with less success.
Consider the teeth-gritting fatalism that hangs over the California
! sports publicity department, one of the most red-hot on the coast.
For their opener, the Bears take on Notre Dame, which last year
trampled nine opponents by lopsided scores and most of them could
i have beaten Cal easily.
Assuming the Bears survive that little encounter (and you've got
j to be a first-rate assumer to do that), they travel next to Michigan.
! Now, the Wolverines were 9-1 last year with several young players,
| and they embarrassed Rose Bowl officials by all but ignoring a be
i wildered Oregon State team, crushing them 31-7.
Oh, well, any team can shrug off a couple of lough games. Who's
; next? Kansas. All the Jayhawkers did last year was compile a 6-4
i record and beat Oklahoma with a tremendous backfielcl. They also
j beat Cal four years ago by only 53-7, but nobody's perfect.
Next —A Breather
After those first few games, Cal returns to more comfortable con
j ference action—breathers, if you will. However, the Bears will be
i breathing prelty hard after they play Washington. The schedule
l makers have tossed in Penn State (6-4) later on to avoid being in
! consistent.
Oregon State plays only three of its 10 games at home, which is
J bad enough, but their opening schedule includes Illinois, lowa, USC,
1 and Northwestern. Syracuse, which went to, the Orange Bowl last
year, comes near the end of the season, which is merciful, consider
j ing lhat after Syracuse's 38-0 shellacking of UCLA last season, the
! Bruins had barely enough strength left to score in their next, two
i games.
As for UCLA, you'd think they had had enough, but they're veri
! table gluttons for punishment. Their opening schedule reads—hold
your breath—Michigan State, Penn State, Syracuse, and Missouri.
After that they play Cal (which will have just played Washington),
j and the winner should be the team that can field 11 men.
WSU Schedule Fairly Gruesome
Washington State's schedule is only fairly gruesome, but since
the Cougars are so lousy, it looks like another long winter in the
Palouse country (do they ever have any other kind up there?). WSU
| plays lowa, Minnesota, Villanova <6-2). Arizona (6-3-1), and Arizona
State (8-2).
USC clashes with Minnesota and Wisconsin before getting a
chance to vent its pent-up frustrations on Oregon State, which inno
cently bumped the Trojans out of the Rose Bowl last year. Now, any
team that denies Smogville its constitutional right u> see a local team
: in the Rose Bowl had better expect rough treatment. L.A. sports
: writers are already reserving seats for Oct. 2,when they can gleefully
watch the Beavers «et thrown to the Trojans in the Coliseum. Later
USC opponents are Not lie Dame, Pittsburgh, and Wyoming.
Stanford will be the first college to play all three service acade
mies next year whether that's desirable remains to be seen. The
three schools were scheduled back in 1938, when the old Pacific Coast
: Conference was breaking up, and Stanford wanted some competition
on an intellectual par with the Farm. Ergo, non-league opponents
are Navy, Army. Air Force, Tulane, and whoops San Jose Stale!
Oregon Plays "Terrors"
Too bad Oregon lost quarterback Bob Berry, because with their
schedule, they may lay claim to the Rose Bowl as sole survivors.
' They play such terrors of the gridiron as Utah, Brigham Young, and
I Idaho.

As for the Huskies of Washing
ton, they play seven league games, j
two more than any other team.
Their outside opponents are Idaho. j
Baylor, and Ohio State. Their
fourth game against USC could de- j
cirio the conference champion ear- j
ly in the season.
At this point, 1965 looks like a
merry old season for the P.A.C.
Last year the conference was 4-X
against the Midwest. An inauspi
cious 13 intersectionals are sched
uled this year, after which the
league race w ill merely determine
which team is masochistic enough
to venture forth in the 14th the;
Rose Bowl.
