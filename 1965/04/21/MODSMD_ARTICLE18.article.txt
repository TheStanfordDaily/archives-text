# LASS on Off-Campus Issues
## A 						CONSERVATIVE'S VIEWPOINT 
### ROBERT NAYLOR Editor, Stanford 'Young Republican 
Should the Legislature take political stands?
That question is probably the most important
in the current campaign for ASSU President, for
it potentially affects the whole future climate of
student politics.
The proposal that the Legislature consider
political issues is reckless and ridiculous on sev
eral counts.
One must ask to begin with whether it is the
business of student government to speak out 011
political questions. What have issues such as the
Vietnam war, disarmament, and the House Un-
American Activities Committee to do with gov
erning students or advising on University policy?
What powers of the ASSU would be enhanced by
granting the Legislature this new right? Such
issues are obviously quite irrelevant and are
surely better dealt with by voluntary groups whose
purpose is direct political action.
Inveterate Students
Whatever the final powers, the most funda
mental objection is that LASSU does not accu
rately represent Stanford student opinion. At
most it is a collection of inveterate student gov
ernment types and reluctant volunteers who have
difficulty enough debating issues of only campus
wide (or even LASSU-wide) importance. Legis
lature members are not chosen on the basis of
political opinions, or even student government
opinions, but on the basis of availability for a
generally uninteresting office.
The proponents of a politicized Legislature will
argue that politics will generate interest and that
there will be more competition to sit on the Legis
lature.
I he repeated failure of political forums such
as the Model U.S. Senate and the Stanford Stu
dent Congress to generate even the mildest inter
est is testimony to the contrary.
It is unlikely that living groups will see any
more intensive campaigns fox Legislative .seats
than they do now.
In the unlikely circumstance that legislators
were chosen 011 the basis of their political beliefs,
LASSU would lose most of its members inter

ested mainly in student government and would be
filled, Instead, with students whose primary con
cern is politics. What effectiveness LASSU now
has as an organ of student government would
be shattered, because those who are intensely
interested in politics, whatever their political per
suasion, view student government issues as ab
surdly inconsequential.
The Graduate Co-ordinating Committee
The exception to that rule—the group inter
ested in both student government and political and
social issues—is the Graduate Co-ordinating Com
mittee. The reason that its interest is so all-inclu
sive, if we are to believe the first GCC news
letter, is that GCCers hope to reform American
society by using the University as a center from
which to build a "bridge to political power."
It is enlightening to notice that the GCC is
of all groups the most interested in giving Legis
lature the new power. For the first time, their
quite radical political ideas might be given the j
weight and respectability of being those allegedly j
of "the Associated Students."
And if the average middle-of-the-road student!
did not feel he was being represented properly, if!
he felt that LASSU had no business making broad
pronouncements in his name, he could not, as in
a voluntary organization, withdraw his financial i
support or his membership from the ASSU.
As the campaign progresses, it is only proper j
that those candidates who favor injecting poli-1
tics into student government be grilled on their
political beliefs and on their attitudes toward the j
GCC, the major force behind this move. As it
happens, the pro-politics candidates are highly sym
pathetic with the GCC's "radical student revolt"
and. if elected, would go right along with the bulk
of GCC proposals.
The need for students to take cognizance of
this issue cannot be overemphasized, for as has!
been shown, it is one that could radically change
the nature of student politics as well as the im- j
age Stanford projects to the outside world.
This is an issue which should surely arouse j
even the most apathetic to help defeat those can
didates who would foist such folly upon the Stan-:
ford community.

lature members are not chosen on the basis of
political opinions, or even student government
opinions, but on the basis of availability for a
generally uninteresting office.
The proponents of a politicized Legislature will
argue that politics will generate interest and that
there will be more competition to sit on the Legis

I he repeated failure of political forums such

It is unlikely that living groups will see any

In the unlikely circumstance that legislators
were chosen 011 the basis of their political beliefs,
LASSU would lose most of its members inter

ested mainly in student government and would be
filled, Instead, with students whose primary con

The Graduate Co-ordinating Committee
The exception to that rule—the group inter
ested in both student government and political and
social issues—is the Graduate Co-ordinating Com
mittee. The reason that its interest is so all-inclu
sive, if we are to believe the first GCC news
letter, is that GCCers hope to reform American
society by using the University as a center from
which to build a "bridge to political power."
It is enlightening to notice that the GCC is
of all groups the most interested in giving Legis
lature the new power. For the first time, their
quite radical political ideas might be given the j
weight and respectability of being those allegedly j
of "the Associated Students."
And if the average middle-of-the-road student!
did not feel he was being represented properly, if!
he felt that LASSU had no business making broad
pronouncements in his name, he could not, as in
a voluntary organization, withdraw his financial i
support or his membership from the ASSU.
As the campaign progresses, it is only proper j
that those candidates who favor injecting poli-1
tics into student government be grilled on their
political beliefs and on their attitudes toward the j
GCC, the major force behind this move. As it
happens, the pro-politics candidates are highly sym
pathetic with the GCC's "radical student revolt"
and. if elected, would go right along with the bulk
of GCC proposals.
The need for students to take cognizance of
this issue cannot be overemphasized, for as has!
been shown, it is one that could radically change
the nature of student politics as well as the im- j
age Stanford projects to the outside world.
This is an issue which should surely arouse j
even the most apathetic to help defeat those can
didates who would foist such folly upon the Stan-:
ford community.
Should the Legislature take political stands?
That question is probably the most important
in the current campaign for ASSU President, for
it potentially affects the whole future climate of
student politics.
The proposal that the Legislature consider
political issues is reckless and ridiculous on sev
eral counts.
One must ask to begin with whether it is the
business of student government to speak out 011
political questions. What have issues such as the
Vietnam war, disarmament, and the House Un-
American Activities Committee to do with gov
erning students or advising on University policy?
What powers of the ASSU would be enhanced by
granting the Legislature this new right? Such
issues are obviously quite irrelevant and are
surely better dealt with by voluntary groups whose
purpose is direct political action.
Inveterate Students
Whatever the final powers, the most funda
mental objection is that LASSU does not accu
rately represent Stanford student opinion. At
most it is a collection of inveterate student gov
ernment types and reluctant volunteers who have
difficulty enough debating issues of only campus
wide (or even LASSU-wide) importance. Legis
