# Black Muslims Are Mistaken
## 
### 
Editor, Th<* Daily:
Your issue of 31st March 1965!
carried a photograph and a re-j
port on the lecture given by Mr. j
Cushmir, leader of the so-called
Black Muslims in San Francisco.
It appears to us that here on the
campus, and perhaps off-campus '
too, there is a great deal of con-i
fusion on the subject of Islam!
and Muslims. While it is impos- j
sible to deal with this subject j
in any detail within the confines!
of this column, we feel that the
situation calls for making a few
points crystal clear:
1. As followers of the religion
Islam, we believe in one and only
one God. We do not believe that
God, in the form of any human !
being, ever came to Detroit or
to any other place for that mat
ter. The Holy Quran, which we
believe to be the word of God,
is our only source of information.
We find no mention whatsoever
in the Quran of anyone by the'
name of Fard or Farrard. We I
categorically deny that he is God, j
if indeed he ever existed.
2. We believe that Muhammed,
the son of Abdullah, who lived
and died in Saudi Arabia some I

1400 years ago, is the last
Prophet of God. We do not be
lieve that Mr. Elijah Muhammed
is a Prophet of God.
3. One of the greatest contri
butions of Islam to human civil
ization has been to forcefully
preach and practice the concept
of equality of man and to wipe
out the barriers of race, color
and nationality. The Quran con
tains numerous references to the
belief that mankind is but one
single nation. It is therefore just
as un-Islamic to believe that the
white man is the devil as it is
to maintain that the whites are
superior to the blacks, Islam is
a religion of love and peace
among all men, and not of hatred
and violence. The heterogeneity
and diversity of color, race, cul
ture and language among the
Muslims all over the world is a
clear proof of the emphasis Is
lam places on the oneness and
equality of mankind.
4. All through the ages Islam
has held a great appeal to the
oppressed, to those who were
denied their fundamental rights
and those who were not treated

( on iho basis of equality and fair
play. It is not surprising at all
j that Islam should have such a
tremendous appeal to the Ameri
can Negro. It is a fact that ac
ceptance of Islam, even, as
preached by Elijah Muhammed,
has resulted in a tremendous
progress in the habits, manners,
1 appearance and other ways of
living of his followers. This, how
ever, is a minor and rather in
significant portion of the vast
1 and more important spiritual and
moral benefits that would ac
crue from accepting Islam as
taught in the Holy Quran.
We are in full sympathy with
j the struggle of the American Ne
gro to achieve civil rights and
we believe that the followers of
Elijah Muhammed, and for that
matter, oppressed people any
where, would make great strides
,in the field of civil, social, politi-
I cal and economic rights by fol
lowing true Islam as explained in
the Quran.
