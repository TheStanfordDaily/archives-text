INTERNATIONAL
• Top Officials Confer on Viet Nam
HONOLULU Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and
top U.S. military and civilian officials met behind closed doors yester
day to discuss the 1 United States' next step in Viet Nam.
Among items on the agenda is a proposal for the South Vietna
mese government to increase its forces by about 160,000 men over
the next year.
McNamara said the United States had decided "as a matter of'
principle" to support the increase.
The second day of sessions got under way as Red China announced j
it was preparing to send Chinese troops into the Vietnamese war if
the United States escalates the fighting and the Vietnamese people
ask for assistance.
• Trend Toward Further Escalation Seen
WASHINGTON Sooner or later Red China and Russia will j
have to make good on their threats to send people to fight in the
Vietnamese war unless peace talks bring expansion of the fighting
to a sudden halt.
Intensive efforts to arrange peace talks now appear to have
broken down. The prospect is that instead of being slowed by diplo
acy the conflict will go on several months with Red Chinese and
some Soviet fighters ultimately becoming involved.
These are the major trends on the military and diplomatic fronts
as analyzed and projected by some of the best informed Washing
ton authorities.

• Top Officials Confer on Viet Nam
HONOLULU Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara and
top U.S. military and civilian officials met behind closed doors yester
day to discuss the 1 United States' next step in Viet Nam.
Among items on the agenda is a proposal for the South Vietna
mese government to increase its forces by about 160,000 men over
the next year.
McNamara said the United States had decided "as a matter of'
principle" to support the increase.
The second day of sessions got under way as Red China announced j
it was preparing to send Chinese troops into the Vietnamese war if
the United States escalates the fighting and the Vietnamese people
ask for assistance.
• Trend Toward Further Escalation Seen
WASHINGTON Sooner or later Red China and Russia will j
have to make good on their threats to send people to fight in the
Vietnamese war unless peace talks bring expansion of the fighting
to a sudden halt.
Intensive efforts to arrange peace talks now appear to have
broken down. The prospect is that instead of being slowed by diplo
acy the conflict will go on several months with Red Chinese and
some Soviet fighters ultimately becoming involved.
These are the major trends on the military and diplomatic fronts
as analyzed and projected by some of the best informed Washing
ton authorities.
