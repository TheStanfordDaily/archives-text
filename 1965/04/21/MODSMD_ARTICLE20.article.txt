# Lumumba, Congo, Africa Harmed by Opportunists
## 
### URIAH CHINWAH (Third in a Series 
It is no uncommon human trait that opportunists who are ever
too ready to feather their nests do so in any given situation. The
Congo was not without such men. Given the slightest possible en
couragement, they mushroomed overnight.
Talk to any African, and you will see through his eyes imperial-

ists and big business concerns
who had vested interests in the
Congo cloistered in secret talks
and negotiations with the Moise
Tshombe type of Congolese:
"Our dear friend, Lumumba,
probably considers us tin* unde
sirable elements who deserve
nothing but immediate deporta
tion. We cannot afford to be
ousted; no, not for some time
yet. We know you are far more
capable than Lumumba andean
easily control your Katanga re
gion of the country better than
he can control the whole coun
try. He ruler of your Katanga,
and we shall continue our good
work for you and your people.
All you need tell your people is
the simple "truth," that Lu
mumba, that man from an ob
scure village, intends using
wealth from Katanga, by far
the richest part of the Congo,
for building up his own poorer
villages, leaving you and your
people destitute. There is no
real constitution binding you to
a central government under
anybody. You can si in p I y
choose to secede. We shall of
course, adequatey compensate
you for services rendered."
To every African nationalist,
Tshombeist actions and strategy
at this period were as damning as
if the secret negotiations were
held in an open market place. It
was not difficult for Katanga lo
lie maneuvered into a position of
subservience to the will of the
Tshombeists. Th e argument of
"influential" and financial s u p
port was too great to be resisted.
How was the poor villager to be
lieve that his brother was so soon
selling him back into slavery and
not just quarreling with his dis
tant cousin 011 a question of prin
ciple?
Thus rebellion grew, and with
it. splinter states. Two splinter
states overnight, one in the rich
minefields of Katanga, headed by
Tshombe himself, and the other
in the diamond-rich Kasai prov
ince of the east.
Yes, rebellion grew, fed and pro
moted by sources very far from
paternalistic. The cause of Afri
can nationalism wavered, and ev
ery true African bit deep into the
flesh of his right hand until the
blood spurted out, so deep was
his anguish and frustration, so
total his condemnation of the
Tshombeists and their mercenary
supporters.
Lumumba, direct as ever, and
with implicit faith in the forces
of law and order—at that time he
thought there were some—called
in the United Nations to restore
order and to preserve justice and
peace
The Caudron Boils Over
The work of the United Nations
was simple enough, or so Lu
mumba thought. "Call Tshombe
and his friends to order; ask for
eign dabblers to keep their hands
off the sacred cause of Congolese
emancipation and self-determina
tion, the sacred cause of African
Nationalism."
To Lumumba's complete bewil
derment, matters came to an im
passe in the hands of the United
Nations. To every African, the
picture began to unfold complete
ly. Here was the world's most
powerful combination of "peace
loving" nations, unable to carry
out a simple task in the name of
the central government of a new
born member nation.
"And why," everyone asked.

"was Tshombe that powerful?" It
turned out thai Tshombe was
fighting the central government,
fighting his own country with
arms and other help from some
fellow United Nations members
amongst whom Britain and Bel
gium were not to be excluded.
Another reason, as Africans
later learned, wa* that the United
States, in her unfamiliarity with
the depths and passions of Afri
can naionalism, in her rather su
perficial knowledge of African as
pirations and goals, had dubbed
Lumumba communist. Thus for
her, that was the end of the story;
"Lumumbaism" was "small-scale
communism:" it was easy enough
to wink at the follies of the pow
erful combine behind the puppet
Tshombe. At least, Tshombe was
not communist; that was enough
comfort.
We are all familiar with the
| events which rapidly followed. I
shall briefly comment on one or
1 two significant points that a non
; African may not easily appre-
I ciate.
Cannibalism
The Congo was soon enmeshed
lin chaos. Pent-up feelings were
unleashed in careless abandon.
Soldiers went wild and easily re
sorted to habits picked up from
foreign wars rape, a very un-
African crime, pillage, and mur
der, people of Belgian extraction
i being the heaviest sufferers. In
! the height of the long nightmare,
! stories of cannibalism came filter
ing back to the rest of the world.
I pause here, as an African, to
explain that a handful of remote
villages which had kept very
much out of touch with every
thing could produce savages who
still remembered great stories
told them by their forefathers of
the magical powers possessed by
these white gods from abroad,
stories that it was in the general
interest of these white gods to
promote and perpetuate at Ihc
I time.
Such men could conceivably
; have made "magical brot lis" from
organs of a fallen white man's
body and could have eaten from
such mixtures. But to give the
impression that every Congolese
villager went wild with cannibal
ism overnight was to convey a
picture of the Congo and Africa
I far removed from reality. In this
i sense, the Western press was to
be denounced for sensation-ped
| dling and for lack of sincerity in
| the serious task of giving to the
j world a true image of the upheav
als that were rending the Congo
asunder and of the forces that
were responsible for them.
To any responsible African,
| such men as did revert to canni
balism were not to be excused
just because they were African.
However, they still had a large
measure of African sympathy on
their side, for they were victims
of circumstances and slaves of the
ignorance which had been in
stilled and perpetuated in them
by the skillful maneuvering of
doubtful characters, certain ad
venturers, who had earlier ven
tured into various parts of the
continent.
White Man Stew
On a more general level, there
fore, the city - dwelling African
would hardly have thought that
the flesh of his erstwhile white
boss was a rare delicacy to be
watched out for on the battlefield.
| I daresay there wern't many sto
ries from World War times of Af
riean soldiers feeding on the fall
-1 en whites among their enemies.
Even the less knowledgeable
' Congolese had an idea, though
vague, that they were fighting
against one particular kind of
white man, the bad one who
would not let them alone, the one
who would make a mockery of
their independence and make a
permanent slave of them.

off the sacred cause of Congolese
emancipation and self-determina
tion, the sacred cause of African
Nationalism."
To Lumumba's complete bewil
derment, matters came to an im
passe in the hands of the United
Nations. To every African, the
picture began to unfold complete
ly. Here was the world's most
powerful combination of "peace
loving" nations, unable to carry
out a simple task in the name of
the central government of a new
born member nation.
"And why," everyone asked.

"was Tshombe that powerful?" It
turned out thai Tshombe was
fighting the central government,
fighting his own country with
arms and other help from some
fellow United Nations members
amongst whom Britain and Bel
gium were not to be excluded.
Another reason, as Africans
later learned, wa* that the United
States, in her unfamiliarity with
the depths and passions of Afri
can naionalism, in her rather su
perficial knowledge of African as
pirations and goals, had dubbed
Lumumba communist. Thus for
her, that was the end of the story;
"Lumumbaism" was "small-scale
communism:" it was easy enough
to wink at the follies of the pow
erful combine behind the puppet
Tshombe. At least, Tshombe was
not communist; that was enough
comfort.
We are all familiar with the
| events which rapidly followed. I
shall briefly comment on one or
1 two significant points that a non
; African may not easily appre-
I ciate.
Cannibalism
The Congo was soon enmeshed
lin chaos. Pent-up feelings were
unleashed in careless abandon.
Soldiers went wild and easily re
sorted to habits picked up from
foreign wars rape, a very un-
African crime, pillage, and mur
der, people of Belgian extraction
i being the heaviest sufferers. In
! the height of the long nightmare,
! stories of cannibalism came filter
ing back to the rest of the world.
I pause here, as an African, to
explain that a handful of remote
villages which had kept very
much out of touch with every
thing could produce savages who
still remembered great stories
told them by their forefathers of
the magical powers possessed by
these white gods from abroad,
stories that it was in the general
interest of these white gods to
promote and perpetuate at Ihc
I time.
Such men could conceivably
; have made "magical brot lis" from
organs of a fallen white man's
body and could have eaten from
such mixtures. But to give the
impression that every Congolese
villager went wild with cannibal
ism overnight was to convey a
picture of the Congo and Africa
I far removed from reality. In this
i sense, the Western press was to
be denounced for sensation-ped
| dling and for lack of sincerity in
| the serious task of giving to the
j world a true image of the upheav
als that were rending the Congo
asunder and of the forces that
were responsible for them.
To any responsible African,
| such men as did revert to canni
balism were not to be excused
just because they were African.
However, they still had a large
measure of African sympathy on
their side, for they were victims
of circumstances and slaves of the
ignorance which had been in
stilled and perpetuated in them
by the skillful maneuvering of
doubtful characters, certain ad
venturers, who had earlier ven
tured into various parts of the
continent.
White Man Stew
On a more general level, there
fore, the city - dwelling African
would hardly have thought that
the flesh of his erstwhile white
boss was a rare delicacy to be
watched out for on the battlefield.
| I daresay there wern't many sto
ries from World War times of Af
riean soldiers feeding on the fall
-1 en whites among their enemies.
Even the less knowledgeable
' Congolese had an idea, though
vague, that they were fighting
against one particular kind of
white man, the bad one who
would not let them alone, the one
who would make a mockery of
their independence and make a
permanent slave of them.
It is no uncommon human trait that opportunists who are ever
too ready to feather their nests do so in any given situation. The
Congo was not without such men. Given the slightest possible en
couragement, they mushroomed overnight.
Talk to any African, and you will see through his eyes imperial-

ists and big business concerns
who had vested interests in the
Congo cloistered in secret talks
and negotiations with the Moise
Tshombe type of Congolese:
"Our dear friend, Lumumba,
probably considers us tin* unde
sirable elements who deserve
nothing but immediate deporta
tion. We cannot afford to be
ousted; no, not for some time
yet. We know you are far more
capable than Lumumba andean
easily control your Katanga re
gion of the country better than
he can control the whole coun
try. He ruler of your Katanga,
and we shall continue our good
work for you and your people.
All you need tell your people is
the simple "truth," that Lu
mumba, that man from an ob
scure village, intends using
wealth from Katanga, by far
the richest part of the Congo,
for building up his own poorer
villages, leaving you and your
people destitute. There is no
real constitution binding you to
a central government under
anybody. You can si in p I y
choose to secede. We shall of
course, adequatey compensate
you for services rendered."
To every African nationalist,
Tshombeist actions and strategy
at this period were as damning as
if the secret negotiations were
held in an open market place. It
was not difficult for Katanga lo
lie maneuvered into a position of
subservience to the will of the
Tshombeists. Th e argument of
"influential" and financial s u p
port was too great to be resisted.
How was the poor villager to be
lieve that his brother was so soon
selling him back into slavery and
not just quarreling with his dis
tant cousin 011 a question of prin
ciple?
Thus rebellion grew, and with
it. splinter states. Two splinter
states overnight, one in the rich
minefields of Katanga, headed by
Tshombe himself, and the other
in the diamond-rich Kasai prov
ince of the east.
Yes, rebellion grew, fed and pro
moted by sources very far from
paternalistic. The cause of Afri
can nationalism wavered, and ev
ery true African bit deep into the
flesh of his right hand until the
blood spurted out, so deep was
his anguish and frustration, so
total his condemnation of the
Tshombeists and their mercenary
supporters.
Lumumba, direct as ever, and
with implicit faith in the forces
of law and order—at that time he
thought there were some—called
in the United Nations to restore
order and to preserve justice and
peace
The Caudron Boils Over
The work of the United Nations
was simple enough, or so Lu
mumba thought. "Call Tshombe
and his friends to order; ask for
eign dabblers to keep their hands
off the sacred cause of Congolese
emancipation and self-determina
tion, the sacred cause of African
Nationalism."

would hardly have thought that

vague, that they were fighting
against one particular kind of
white man, the bad one who
would not let them alone, the one
who would make a mockery of

permanent slave of them.
It is no uncommon human trait that opportunists who are ever
too ready to feather their nests do so in any given situation. The
Congo was not without such men. Given the slightest possible en
couragement, they mushroomed overnight.
Talk to any African, and you will see through his eyes imperial-

ists and big business concerns
who had vested interests in the
Congo cloistered in secret talks
and negotiations with the Moise
Tshombe type of Congolese:
"Our dear friend, Lumumba,
probably considers us tin* unde
sirable elements who deserve
nothing but immediate deporta
tion. We cannot afford to be
ousted; no, not for some time
yet. We know you are far more
capable than Lumumba andean
easily control your Katanga re
gion of the country better than
he can control the whole coun
try. He ruler of your Katanga,
and we shall continue our good
work for you and your people.
All you need tell your people is
the simple "truth," that Lu
mumba, that man from an ob
scure village, intends using
wealth from Katanga, by far
the richest part of the Congo,
for building up his own poorer
villages, leaving you and your
people destitute. There is no
real constitution binding you to
a central government under
anybody. You can si in p I y
choose to secede. We shall of
course, adequatey compensate
you for services rendered."
To every African nationalist,
Tshombeist actions and strategy
at this period were as damning as
if the secret negotiations were
held in an open market place. It
was not difficult for Katanga lo
lie maneuvered into a position of
subservience to the will of the
Tshombeists. Th e argument of
"influential" and financial s u p
port was too great to be resisted.
How was the poor villager to be
lieve that his brother was so soon
selling him back into slavery and
not just quarreling with his dis
tant cousin 011 a question of prin
ciple?
Thus rebellion grew, and with
it. splinter states. Two splinter
states overnight, one in the rich
minefields of Katanga, headed by
Tshombe himself, and the other
in the diamond-rich Kasai prov
ince of the east.
Yes, rebellion grew, fed and pro
moted by sources very far from
paternalistic. The cause of Afri
can nationalism wavered, and ev
ery true African bit deep into the
flesh of his right hand until the
blood spurted out, so deep was
his anguish and frustration, so
total his condemnation of the
Tshombeists and their mercenary
supporters.
Lumumba, direct as ever, and
with implicit faith in the forces
of law and order—at that time he
thought there were some—called
in the United Nations to restore
order and to preserve justice and
peace
The Caudron Boils Over
The work of the United Nations
was simple enough, or so Lu
mumba thought. "Call Tshombe
and his friends to order; ask for
eign dabblers to keep their hands
off the sacred cause of Congolese
emancipation and self-determina
tion, the sacred cause of African
Nationalism."
To Lumumba's complete bewil
derment, matters came to an im
passe in the hands of the United
Nations. To every African, the
picture began to unfold complete
ly. Here was the world's most
powerful combination of "peace
loving" nations, unable to carry
out a simple task in the name of
the central government of a new
born member nation.
"And why," everyone asked.

"was Tshombe that powerful?" It
turned out thai Tshombe was
fighting the central government,
fighting his own country with
arms and other help from some
fellow United Nations members
amongst whom Britain and Bel
gium were not to be excluded.
Another reason, as Africans
later learned, wa* that the United
States, in her unfamiliarity with
the depths and passions of Afri
can naionalism, in her rather su
perficial knowledge of African as
pirations and goals, had dubbed
Lumumba communist. Thus for
her, that was the end of the story;
"Lumumbaism" was "small-scale
communism:" it was easy enough
to wink at the follies of the pow
erful combine behind the puppet
Tshombe. At least, Tshombe was
not communist; that was enough
comfort.
We are all familiar with the
| events which rapidly followed. I
shall briefly comment on one or
1 two significant points that a non
; African may not easily appre-
I ciate.
Cannibalism
The Congo was soon enmeshed
lin chaos. Pent-up feelings were
unleashed in careless abandon.
Soldiers went wild and easily re
sorted to habits picked up from
foreign wars rape, a very un-
African crime, pillage, and mur
der, people of Belgian extraction
i being the heaviest sufferers. In
! the height of the long nightmare,
! stories of cannibalism came filter
ing back to the rest of the world.
I pause here, as an African, to
explain that a handful of remote
villages which had kept very
much out of touch with every
thing could produce savages who
still remembered great stories
told them by their forefathers of
the magical powers possessed by
these white gods from abroad,
stories that it was in the general
interest of these white gods to
promote and perpetuate at Ihc
I time.
Such men could conceivably
; have made "magical brot lis" from
organs of a fallen white man's
body and could have eaten from
such mixtures. But to give the
impression that every Congolese
villager went wild with cannibal
ism overnight was to convey a
picture of the Congo and Africa
I far removed from reality. In this
i sense, the Western press was to
be denounced for sensation-ped
| dling and for lack of sincerity in
| the serious task of giving to the
j world a true image of the upheav
als that were rending the Congo
asunder and of the forces that
were responsible for them.
To any responsible African,
| such men as did revert to canni
balism were not to be excused
just because they were African.
However, they still had a large

states overnight, one in the rich
minefields of Katanga, headed by
Tshombe himself, and the other
in the diamond-rich Kasai prov
ince of the east.
Yes, rebellion grew, fed and pro
moted by sources very far from
paternalistic. The cause of Afri
can nationalism wavered, and ev
ery true African bit deep into the
flesh of his right hand until the
blood spurted out, so deep was
his anguish and frustration, so
total his condemnation of the
Tshombeists and their mercenary
supporters.
Lumumba, direct as ever, and
with implicit faith in the forces
of law and order—at that time he
thought there were some—called
in the United Nations to restore
order and to preserve justice and
peace
The Caudron Boils Over
The work of the United Nations
was simple enough, or so Lu
mumba thought. "Call Tshombe
and his friends to order; ask for
eign dabblers to keep their hands
off the sacred cause of Congolese
emancipation and self-determina
tion, the sacred cause of African
Nationalism."
To Lumumba's complete bewil
derment, matters came to an im
passe in the hands of the United
Nations. To every African, the
picture began to unfold complete
ly. Here was the world's most
powerful combination of "peace
loving" nations, unable to carry
out a simple task in the name of
the central government of a new
born member nation.
"And why," everyone asked.

"was Tshombe that powerful?" It
turned out thai Tshombe was
fighting the central government,
fighting his own country with
arms and other help from some
fellow United Nations members
amongst whom Britain and Bel
gium were not to be excluded.
Another reason, as Africans
later learned, wa* that the United
States, in her unfamiliarity with
the depths and passions of Afri
can naionalism, in her rather su
perficial knowledge of African as
pirations and goals, had dubbed
Lumumba communist. Thus for
her, that was the end of the story;
"Lumumbaism" was "small-scale
communism:" it was easy enough
to wink at the follies of the pow
erful combine behind the puppet
Tshombe. At least, Tshombe was
not communist; that was enough
comfort.
We are all familiar with the
| events which rapidly followed. I
shall briefly comment on one or
1 two significant points that a non
; African may not easily appre-
I ciate.
Cannibalism
The Congo was soon enmeshed
lin chaos. Pent-up feelings were
unleashed in careless abandon.
Soldiers went wild and easily re
sorted to habits picked up from
foreign wars rape, a very un-
African crime, pillage, and mur
der, people of Belgian extraction
i being the heaviest sufferers. In
! the height of the long nightmare,
! stories of cannibalism came filter
ing back to the rest of the world.
I pause here, as an African, to
explain that a handful of remote
villages which had kept very
much out of touch with every
thing could produce savages who
still remembered great stories
told them by their forefathers of
the magical powers possessed by
these white gods from abroad,
stories that it was in the general
interest of these white gods to
promote and perpetuate at Ihc
I time.
Such men could conceivably
; have made "magical brot lis" from
organs of a fallen white man's
body and could have eaten from
such mixtures. But to give the
impression that every Congolese
villager went wild with cannibal
ism overnight was to convey a
picture of the Congo and Africa
I far removed from reality. In this
i sense, the Western press was to
be denounced for sensation-ped
| dling and for lack of sincerity in
| the serious task of giving to the
j world a true image of the upheav
als that were rending the Congo
asunder and of the forces that
were responsible for them.
To any responsible African,
| such men as did revert to canni
balism were not to be excused
just because they were African.
However, they still had a large
measure of African sympathy on
their side, for they were victims
of circumstances and slaves of the
ignorance which had been in
stilled and perpetuated in them
by the skillful maneuvering of
doubtful characters, certain ad
venturers, who had earlier ven
tured into various parts of the
continent.
White Man Stew
On a more general level, there
fore, the city - dwelling African
would hardly have thought that
the flesh of his erstwhile white
boss was a rare delicacy to be
watched out for on the battlefield.
| I daresay there wern't many sto
ries from World War times of Af
riean soldiers feeding on the fall
-1 en whites among their enemies.
Even the less knowledgeable
' Congolese had an idea, though
vague, that they were fighting
against one particular kind of
white man, the bad one who
would not let them alone, the one
who would make a mockery of
their independence and make a
permanent slave of them.
It is no uncommon human trait that opportunists who are ever
too ready to feather their nests do so in any given situation. The
Congo was not without such men. Given the slightest possible en
couragement, they mushroomed overnight.
Talk to any African, and you will see through his eyes imperial-

ists and big business concerns
who had vested interests in the
Congo cloistered in secret talks
and negotiations with the Moise
Tshombe type of Congolese:
"Our dear friend, Lumumba,
probably considers us tin* unde
sirable elements who deserve
nothing but immediate deporta
tion. We cannot afford to be
ousted; no, not for some time
yet. We know you are far more
capable than Lumumba andean
easily control your Katanga re
gion of the country better than
he can control the whole coun
try. He ruler of your Katanga,
and we shall continue our good
work for you and your people.
All you need tell your people is
the simple "truth," that Lu
mumba, that man from an ob
scure village, intends using
wealth from Katanga, by far
the richest part of the Congo,
for building up his own poorer
villages, leaving you and your
people destitute. There is no
real constitution binding you to
a central government under
anybody. You can si in p I y
choose to secede. We shall of
course, adequatey compensate
you for services rendered."
To every African nationalist,
Tshombeist actions and strategy
at this period were as damning as
if the secret negotiations were
held in an open market place. It
was not difficult for Katanga lo
lie maneuvered into a position of
subservience to the will of the
Tshombeists. Th e argument of
"influential" and financial s u p
port was too great to be resisted.
How was the poor villager to be
lieve that his brother was so soon
selling him back into slavery and
not just quarreling with his dis
tant cousin 011 a question of prin
ciple?
