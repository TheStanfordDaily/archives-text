# LA 						Times Labels GCC an Important Political Force
## 
### HENRY MULLER 
" The graduate .student lias emerged as a campus political force
at Stanford University. Tliis is the most important development
leading to the current student-administration conflicts.' So writes
William Tromblcy of the Los Angeles Times in the lead of a series
of two articles on this campus* activities.

lie continues by saying that the
pi incipal factor contributing to the
graduates' newly-aroused interest
in student politics is the example
provided by the Free Speech Move
ment in Berkeley, whose leader
ship was largely made up of grad
uate students.
Tromblcy sees the GCC as the
most politically active and impor

| tant force on campus. He claims
that despite the fact that it was or
ganized rather spontaneously, it
i obtained political power rapidly.
At that point, according to Trom
blcy, all it needed was an issue in
I which to exercise its power. One
i was found when the Crow-Halver
| son report was released, he says.
ClCC's Interest Far-Reaching
Although in the last two months
1 "the major concern of 'he activ
ists" has been the University it
self, Tromblcy warns that "the
GCC's concerns extend far beyond
| campus regulations, and it is in
these further interests that the
University may find itself most se
riously challenged."
Trombley remarks that GCC
members do not mind being called
"radicals" and, as a matter of fact,
sometimes glory in that designa
tion. He is quick to point out, how
lever, that they arc not politically
radical in the historical sense.
Instead, he says, they are more
closely related to the "new radical
ism," an attitude placing a greater
emphasis on civil rights than on
class struggle. "Typically," he
i writes, "the 'new radical' greatly
| admires IheSNCC but has little in
! terest in socialism or Commu
nism."
Trombley concludes his series
by claiming that aclivists on this
1 campus, "if they are ever able to
harness their energies and attack
lit'' established academic order,
might be a considerable force
' with which I"Â» contend "
