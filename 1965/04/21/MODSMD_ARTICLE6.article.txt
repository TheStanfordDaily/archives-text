# Steiner Lamblasts US For Welfare Programs

"I find that I have not directed
myself to a cheering subject,"
Professor Gilbert Y. Steiner of
the Institute of Public and Gov
ernment Affairs at the Univer
sity of Illinois cheerlessly ad
dressed his Tuesday Evening
Series audience. t
He said lliat this subject is
"endlessly depressing," and, in
short, "the American public wel
fare program is a mess."
Prof. Steiner blamed the na
tion's unreasonable attitude to
wards public assistance. The So
cial Security Act of 1935 does
not provide social insurance for
the old and poor, young and poor,
or blind and poor.
However, the act assumed that
broader in s u r a n c e coverage

i would lead to less demand for
' public assistance, followed by the
withdrawal of the federal govern
. ment from public welfare, and
i the assumption of the problem
j by the states. Professor Steiner
i cited three unexpected factors
which challenge this reasoning:
inflation, automation, and a more
I casual attitude to family rela
j tionships. The "noninsurable"
I public-assistance group now
I stands at eight million.
This fact, Prof. Steiner said,
points out two things: public as
| sistance is not "withering away"
and it. "lacks the imagination ap
plied to the poverty question."
President Johnson's Poverty Pro
gram, with its subsidized jobs and
training the untrained, only helps
those who can't take advantage of
it.
