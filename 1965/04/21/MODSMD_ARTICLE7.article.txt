# JUDICIAL REFORM
## Bill Forces Definition of Univ. Rules 
### CHARLES FARNSWORTH (First in a Series 
EDITOR'S NOTE: >Ir. Farnswortli is a
second-year Stanford I,aw student and a
member of the ASSU Legislature.
The acceptance by Hie University of the
ASSU judicial competence bill will not onl\
encourage the administration to articulate
its policies, tint will strengthen a student's
procedural rights before a University tribu
nal by guaranteeing him all the safeguards
enacted by LASSU for its own student judi
cial councils.
The University has expressly promised,
under the contract theory of the University
student relationship, not to expel a student
for any reason without first affording him
the procedural rights specified by LASSU.
Until now Hie student has been subject
to the unartieulaled rules of the University,
and the University could . . require with
drawal of any student . . . who fails to abide
by University regulations, or whose social
conduct, personal habits, or moral character
are deemed detrimental by the University"
(Stanford University Bulletin, l!Â»(i.i, p. 3Ki.
No procedural rights were guaranteed in
Univri il v |li tm fi'iliiii;<. although I he ASSU

By-laws assured safeguards before student
judicial councils. The University could make
the rules arbitrarily and execute them sum
marily.
Implied Acceptance
Enrollment, the University declared, im
plied the student's acceptance of these condi
tions. The student, however, even if he
knows of the conditions, has no real bargain
ing power individually. His position is simi
lar to that of a worker in a large factory, a
situation in which courts have required the
factory 1o make their conditions of employ
men! reasonable.
A court might require the same of a uni
versity. But as long as the provisions of the
judicial competence bill remain unrevoked
by the University, the student's rights under
the contract theory are as well protected be
fore a University tribunal (which will try
violations of University policy that are not
violations of ASSU By-laws) as they are be
fore a student judicial council.
Two Theories
There are two other theories of analysis
of the University student relationship, which
coidrl bo invoked if the University ever
lapsed into summary proceedings: the in
iMtvnlis and (iinvfHntfoiiiil riifMs lb**"

rios. The former affords lit Ile shelter and
the latter is difficult to apply.
Under the in loeo parentis theory, the stu
dent has only those rights which the 1 univer
sity, as parent, gives him. The university
may punish and restrict whenever it is bene
ficial to the student. While tht university
provides resident advisers and a health serv
ice, it is hard to see why it is qualified to
stand in the place of a parent.
Parental Duties
If the university seriously intended to
undertake the duties of a parent it would
first contact the individual's parents to de
termine their wishes, instead of imperson
ally applying a universal standard. In the
modern university, with 50 percent graduate
students and an avowed purpose of educa
tion, paternalistic supervision would stem
to obstruct the educational process by con
suming valuable professional time and pro
longing student adolescence.
Most importantly, if the university thinks
of itself as a parent, then expulsion is an in
appropriate punishment in any case, akin to
banishing the prodigal son, because it inflicts
permanent in.iuiA upon him hy hurting his
future economic and educational opporlunl-
I ies.
