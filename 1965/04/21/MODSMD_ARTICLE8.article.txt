# Gov. Sanford Arrives Today
## Wilbur Guest To Discuss Current Southern Issues 
### JOHN BUZAN 
Former Governor Terry Sanford of North Carolina arrives at
Stanford today as guest-in-residence of Wilbur Hall for three days.
Tlie eminent Southern moderate will attend a reception at Wilbur
this afternoon and this evening w ill present an address at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium open to the entire campus.

After the 7:30 speech on "State*
Government Leadership," Gov.
Sanford will attend an all-campus
reception in Madera Lounge.
The topic of his address coin
cides with the work ht has under
taken since leaving the governor
ship earlier this year.
He is directing a two-year study
to find means of strengthening the
position of the state in relation to
the federal government, especially
conee rn in g ed uca ti on.
Gov. Sanford's other special in
terests are the problem of the Ne
gro in Southern society and the
emergence of a "new" South.
Both are related to his great
achievements in educational ad
vancement while go v e r no r of
North Carolina.
When he assumed office, North
Carolina ranked in the lowest per
centiles of state-by-state academic
achievement and of government
concern with the problem, as well
as having the fourth lowest per
capita income in the nation.
He established machinery for a
community college system as well
as three new schools to cope with
elementary educational faults. He
also established a fund to attack
poverty via the channels of the
individual community.
To cope with the civil rights
problem—on which he has strong
opinions- he established the Good
Neighbor Council and the Mayor's
Cooperating Council. North Caro
lina now has virtually full integra
tion.
Gov. Sanford in 1961 wrote an
article for Look magazine, entitled
"The Case for the New South," in
which he expressed his moderatist
views. He called for Southern
moderates 1o "commit themselves
to specific actions," at the same
time that he exhorted civil rights
leaders to reassess their programs
ol mass demonstrations.
"In many instance, as the dem
onstrations deteriorate into vio
lence, civil disobedience or mob ac
tion. they destroy goodwill, create
resentment and lose friends."
But he does not deny that the
demonstrations awoke the South

ern mind to the problem. "Incred
ible as il seems, we Southerners
had to learn." He argues effec
tively that a change in climate of
opinion has overtaken the South,
partly due to the demonstrations
and partly to the emergence of an
attitude he calls the "New South."
His itinerary of topics embraces
nearly all aspects of his thought:
the relation of the state to the fed
eral government, student involve
ment in social issues, the histori
cal changes of the South since the
thirties, race relations and educa
tion.
In addition to his seminars in
Wilbur, Gov. Sanford will appear
be 112 or e campus - wide audiences
twice more and will give two class
lectures.

In addition to his seminars in
Wilbur, Gov. Sanford will appear
be 112 or e campus - wide audiences
twice more and will give two class
lectures.
Former Governor Terry Sanford of North Carolina arrives at
Stanford today as guest-in-residence of Wilbur Hall for three days.
Tlie eminent Southern moderate will attend a reception at Wilbur
this afternoon and this evening w ill present an address at Dinkel
spiel Auditorium open to the entire campus.

After the 7:30 speech on "State*
Government Leadership," Gov.
Sanford will attend an all-campus
reception in Madera Lounge.
The topic of his address coin
cides with the work ht has under
taken since leaving the governor
ship earlier this year.
He is directing a two-year study
to find means of strengthening the
position of the state in relation to
the federal government, especially
conee rn in g ed uca ti on.
Gov. Sanford's other special in
terests are the problem of the Ne
gro in Southern society and the
emergence of a "new" South.
Both are related to his great
achievements in educational ad
vancement while go v e r no r of
North Carolina.
When he assumed office, North
Carolina ranked in the lowest per
centiles of state-by-state academic
achievement and of government
concern with the problem, as well
as having the fourth lowest per
capita income in the nation.
He established machinery for a
community college system as well
as three new schools to cope with
elementary educational faults. He
also established a fund to attack
poverty via the channels of the
individual community.
To cope with the civil rights
problem—on which he has strong
opinions- he established the Good
Neighbor Council and the Mayor's
Cooperating Council. North Caro
lina now has virtually full integra
tion.
Gov. Sanford in 1961 wrote an
article for Look magazine, entitled
"The Case for the New South," in
which he expressed his moderatist
views. He called for Southern
moderates 1o "commit themselves
to specific actions," at the same
time that he exhorted civil rights
leaders to reassess their programs
ol mass demonstrations.
"In many instance, as the dem
onstrations deteriorate into vio
lence, civil disobedience or mob ac
tion. they destroy goodwill, create
resentment and lose friends."
But he does not deny that the
demonstrations awoke the South

ern mind to the problem. "Incred
ible as il seems, we Southerners
had to learn." He argues effec
tively that a change in climate of
opinion has overtaken the South,
partly due to the demonstrations
and partly to the emergence of an
attitude he calls the "New South."
His itinerary of topics embraces
nearly all aspects of his thought:
the relation of the state to the fed
eral government, student involve
ment in social issues, the histori
cal changes of the South since the
thirties, race relations and educa
tion.
