# Robbins: Autonomous, Decentralized Involvement
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Autonomy with decentraliza
tion is the formula ASSU Presi
dential hopeful Dave Robbins
plans to use to revitalize stu
dent government if elected.
Robbins, a junior history ma
jor, is "very much in favor of
the present trend toward more
autonomy and participation in
University decision making," but
he thinks that tho present
ASSU organizational structure
is too monolithic to be truly
representative.

Some Major Changes
Thus, the candidate, a mem
ber of Delta Tau Delta frater
nity, would like to make some
major changes in the present
system.
• Reorganization of the
executive. Robbins would estab
lish a five-man 'Cabinet' to co
ordinate student activity on the
various ASSU boards, commis
sions and committees and to
advise the President. This Cabi
net, whose secretaries would
bear titles such as Secretary of
Academic Affairs and Secretary

of Public Issues, would bo
chosen by the President, but
would represent "a broad spec
trum of campus political opin
ion."
• Revitalization of the role of
the President in LASSU meet
ings. Robbins feels that there
is an "imbalance" in the present
relationship between the Execu
tive and the Legislature. "The
President can be a stronger lead
er in the Legislature . . . We do
not mean that the President
should again have the Legisla
ture as a rubber stamp, but he
should be strong enough to play

an active role."
'Truly Representative' Gov't
• Make student government
"truly representative." The can
didate feels that the Legislature,
as presently constituted, is not
always representative of stu
dent opinion. He pointed out
that members often do not re
port to their constituencies, that
many members are appointed—
not elected, and that their man
date does not necessarily give
them the right toirepresent their
constituencies ofn off-campus
issues.

Robbins told The Daily th a t
two other institutions should
share in these prerogatives.
Me recommends that specific
partisan groups, such as the
YR's and the Peace Caucus,
speak out on off-campus issues
or circulate petitions. In extra
ordinary circumstances, an all
campus referendum may be in
stigated.
Increase Executive's Rolf
The other institution that
should have an increased role
to play is the Executive branch.

"We need fewer Legislative in
vestigations in places where
LASSU is not comi>otent," the
candidate declared. Moreover,
within the executive branch it
self, there is a need for greater
autonomy. "A group such as the
IFC just will not be as effective
under the direction of a depart
ment. of the ASSU."
Finally, Robbins and his run
ning mate, junior Frank Morse,
feel that there is a definite need
for increased communication be
tween the student body as a
whole and their government. Al
though in favor of such groups

as tho Committee of 13, they
felt that the various members
should bo more available to tho
student body for questions and
that their views should receive
more publicity.
Concerning current political
issues, Robbins and Morse fa
vor an increase in tho use of
tho Dean's offices as centers of
student counseling, support tho
now Board of Appeals in th e
judicial field, hope to establish
an alumni mentor program and
would like to see academic
credit given for some field work
projects and special seminars.

relationship between the Execu
tive and the Legislature. "The
President can be a stronger lead
er in the Legislature . . . We do
not mean that the President
should again have the Legisla
ture as a rubber stamp, but he
should be strong enough to play

an active role."
'Truly Representative' Gov't
• Make student government
"truly representative." The can
didate feels that the Legislature,
as presently constituted, is not
always representative of stu
dent opinion. He pointed out
that members often do not re
port to their constituencies, that
many members are appointed—
not elected, and that their man
date does not necessarily give
them the right toirepresent their
constituencies ofn off-campus
issues.

Robbins told The Daily th a t
two other institutions should
share in these prerogatives.
Me recommends that specific
partisan groups, such as the
YR's and the Peace Caucus,
speak out on off-campus issues
or circulate petitions. In extra
ordinary circumstances, an all
campus referendum may be in
stigated.
Increase Executive's Rolf
The other institution that
should have an increased role
to play is the Executive branch.

"We need fewer Legislative in
vestigations in places where
LASSU is not comi>otent," the
candidate declared. Moreover,
within the executive branch it
self, there is a need for greater
autonomy. "A group such as the
IFC just will not be as effective
under the direction of a depart
ment. of the ASSU."
Finally, Robbins and his run
ning mate, junior Frank Morse,
feel that there is a definite need
for increased communication be
tween the student body as a
whole and their government. Al
though in favor of such groups

as tho Committee of 13, they
felt that the various members
should bo more available to tho
student body for questions and
that their views should receive
more publicity.
Concerning current political
issues, Robbins and Morse fa
vor an increase in tho use of
tho Dean's offices as centers of
student counseling, support tho
now Board of Appeals in th e
judicial field, hope to establish
an alumni mentor program and
would like to see academic
credit given for some field work
projects and special seminars.
Autonomy with decentraliza
tion is the formula ASSU Presi
dential hopeful Dave Robbins
plans to use to revitalize stu
dent government if elected.
Robbins, a junior history ma
jor, is "very much in favor of
the present trend toward more
autonomy and participation in
University decision making," but
he thinks that tho present
ASSU organizational structure
is too monolithic to be truly
representative.

Some Major Changes
Thus, the candidate, a mem
ber of Delta Tau Delta frater
nity, would like to make some
major changes in the present
system.
• Reorganization of the
executive. Robbins would estab
lish a five-man 'Cabinet' to co
ordinate student activity on the
various ASSU boards, commis
sions and committees and to
advise the President. This Cabi
net, whose secretaries would
bear titles such as Secretary of
Academic Affairs and Secretary

of Public Issues, would bo
chosen by the President, but
would represent "a broad spec
trum of campus political opin
ion."
• Revitalization of the role of
the President in LASSU meet
ings. Robbins feels that there
is an "imbalance" in the present
relationship between the Execu
tive and the Legislature. "The
President can be a stronger lead
er in the Legislature . . . We do
not mean that the President
should again have the Legisla
ture as a rubber stamp, but he
should be strong enough to play
