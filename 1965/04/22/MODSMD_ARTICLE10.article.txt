# Musical Plans Often Out of Tune
## 
### HOLLY RUST 
A warm spring night . .
with lots of stars . . . and
the music of Henry Man
cini.
All of these arc included
in the May 1 Con Home con
cert "Night Under the Stars'
which will mark the culmina
tion of a number of pro!)
leius confronting the commit
tee since last October.
The biggest problem facing
Coil Home Co-Chairmen Ken
Jernstedt and Judy Sterling
was to get a "top drawer"
entertainer for the concert.
According to Billboard Maga
zine, which lists Mancini a
the number one attraction
on college campuses, th e y
solved that problem.
Next, they had to provide
a dressing room for forty-odd
musicians. Because Mem,
And. was occupied, they con
sidered the Men's Gym. As
sistant; Athletic Director Boh
Young even offered his office
for Mancini's use, but there
was a transportation prob
lem.
Finally they decided to set
up a tent behind the orches
tra shell in Frost. But there
was much more involved
than merely putting up the
tent. It must be provided
with the expected things such
as a floor and a partition to
separate the men and women
and with more unusual
necessities such as chemical
toilets or "client cans."
Adding to the expense of
the concert was the clause in
Mancini's contract requiring
a concert grand piano. First
the music department had to

release it, 1 li«>n it has to be
moved to Frost the day of
the performance and moved
hack that night with the
movers getting overtime pay.
Another clause requires thai
it 1>«- tuned to concert pitch
three hours before the con
cert.
There was also the diffi
culty of setting 1 up the ticket
office. It had to be released
from the athletic department,
moved to Frost and provided
with phone, lighting and wir
ing.
Among the technical prob
lems confronting the concert
committee were the supply
ing of 44 music stands with
individual lights, the erec
tion of three towers for over
head lights, the adjusting of
the timing mechanism in the
sound system to insure every
one of receiving the sounds
at the same time and the ob
struction of the construction
of an orchestra pit for the
Summer Festival's "Mozart
Era."
Having conquered this bar
rage of little known prob
lems, the committee should
be ably to calmly sit back
and await the concert, but
the weather man holds the
ace. According to Co-chair
man Ken Jernstedt, "Six
months work and a sizable
contribution to the Con Home
seem to in' at the mercy of
the weatherman. But we hope
we're keeping a step ahead
of him by including in the
Msmcini contract a provision
for two alternate perform
ances that same night in the
Pavilion in the event of
rain."
