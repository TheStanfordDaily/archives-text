clubs on other campuses."
At present, the lIR is the larg
est. organization of its kind in the

the only organization to have five
over seas campus contacts."
Pillsbury Wishes to make use

West.
"The' Stanford lIR wants to
establish a west coast center in
San Francisco from which the
NSA. the Collegiate Council for
the United Nations and the As
sociation of International Rela
tions Club can operate," he said.
lIR members have already vis
ited New York, United Nations
headquarters, the State Depart
ment, Princeton University, and
Pacific Union College to promote
this new program. This weekend
one vice president goes to Riv
erside to contact NSA.
Previously, these three organi
zations have not been active in
the West, Pillsbury stated. "In the
new membership drive which be
gins next week." he commented,
"we hope to build up the strength
necessary to carry out these pro
grams."
lir redefining lIR goals, Pills
bury states, "The lIR wishes to
stay with student activism. Times
tell us student are more active
in world affairs. The lIR has to
keep up with this thinking."
