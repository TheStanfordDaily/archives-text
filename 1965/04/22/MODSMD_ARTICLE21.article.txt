# When Are Off-Campus Issues Fair Game for the Legislature?
## 
### 
Editor's Note: Mr. Sangster is
a third-year Law student. He is
a member of the Legislature, eo
sponsor of the Judicial Com
petence Bill, and a member of the
Committee of Fifteen on Off-
Campus Issues.
By ROB SANGSTLK
Mr. N'aylor, fittingly modest in
his versatility, has directed him
self to the consideration of two
points with virtual simultaneity.
Beneath the veneer it turns out
that he wanted to speak not only
on Ihe subject of off campus
issues, but also on the ASSU
political process. Since his drama
unfolded a t rifle obscurely, let
us examine his positions.
Unless Mr. Naylor considers all:
issues, to be political issues, and
because of his ultra-conservative
position perhaps at this point he
must, he appears to have inten
tionally misconstrued the LASSU
Resolution, regarding off campus
issues, to serve his own end. To
attribute such evident lack of
comprehension to inadvertence
would bo to insult him.
The Resolution says, and means,
that if there are situations in the
world outside of the Stanford in
cubus about which the student
body feels a "deep concern" and
concerning which we feel that, as
journeymen intellectual leaders,
we have some responsibility, j
then wo must discuss and debate
these issues and, if possible, ex
press our conclusions. Regard
less of the limits of one's orien
tation, Mr. Naylor, I would sup
pose that this might be regarded
as a little broader than your
characterization of a desire to i
take part in political fist-fights I
(putting aside for the momontj
the question of whether the avow-;
edly political organizations at
Stanford have carried their bur
den ).
No Cock-fighting
Now we get to tlie heart of the
question. When is a statement by
the student body appropriate? Mr.
Naylor, using a time-worn debat
ing technique of no utility in a I
well-intentioned discussion, con-l
jures up every spectre with which
his imagination can provide him
—e.g., Viet Nam (inexplicably,
ho omitted cock-fighting).
Had he read past the title, ho
would have discovered that the
Resolution restricts the Legisla
ture to statements about which
the student body feels a "deep!
concern" and - most importantly'

—no statement can bo made
which is not commensurate with
the "nature and extent of t he
qualified information made avail
able to the Legislature." If ho was
aware of this section he either
has chosen to ignore its relevance
or, again, simply does not under
stand it.
Mr. Naylor's political naivete is
shocking albeit documented. This
Resolution was not sponsored by
any or all of the candidates in
the ASSU election. I am a co
sponsor and wrote the draft ac
cepted by the Legislature by a
vote of 66-7.
I am not a member of the GCC,
the YRs, nor of the Minutemen.
I am a representative to the Legis
ture from tlie Law School and
it seemed to me apparent that an
'off-campus issue' proposal in a
very broad form would he made
in the near future and that it
stood a good chance of being ac
cepted. Therefore, I took the re
sponsibility of drafting a pro
posal in a manner which, while
affirming the principle that stu
dents have a responsibility to
exercise a formulative voice in
the community and the country,
limited the Legislature to speak
ing only on the rather narrow
range of issues about which it
could be thoroughly informed and
could speak, representatively to
some purpose.
By-Laws Committee
Furthermore, the Resolution
was brought to the floor of the
Legislature, explained, and — by
its sponsors — sent to the By-
Laws Committee for study. The
text of the Resolution itself —
down near the bottom, Mr. Nay
lor — refers the whole subject,
of speaking on off-campus issues,
to the newly-formed Committee
of 15 for student-faculty-adminis
tration discussion. Did you know
that, presumably to aid LASSU
in "foisting such folly upon the!
Stanford community," (your
words) the Speaker of the Legis-1
lature had appointed you to the]
Committee of 15 and published I
that fact in the Stanford Daily
earlier this week?
In addition, each of the Legis-!
lators was instructed by the!
Speaker to communicate withj
his constituents to ascertain all 1
points of view. If these actions
seem precipitate to you, Mr. Nay
lor, then my suggestion would be
that you participate in the formu-1
lation — or defeat of these!

issues early in their development.
After all, you have described this
question as "the most important"
in the ASSU elections.
Political Thrust
The political thrust of your
statement can, and should be.
dealt with briefly. If anywhere in
the world a political campaign
can be conducted without decep
tion and mudslinging, mightn't
it be in an academic community?
Your attack makes mo wonder, in
light of your contemptuous and
tedious diatribes on the inability
of the Stanford student to gov
ern himself, what your incentive
is.
You may have missed the sali
ent debate in LASSU on the off
campus issue .Resolution because
you were still rattled by attacks
on your alleged partiality on the
Publications Board, but you really
should have attended the KZSU
debate on Tuesday night. After
all, you should have known that
at that meeting each of the four
candidates would express himself
as in favor of the principle that
the Board of Trustees should not
prohibit the Legislature, enlarged
for the express purpose of in
creasing representation, from
speaking on off-campus issues as
qualified by the Resolution. Since
your attack was intended to bo
quite partisan, written as it was
before the KZSU debate, it does
seem to lose a bit of its point
now, doesn't it ?
Distressed that space limita
tions prevent me from answering
your tirade in full, I shall make
the point succinctly: If you do
not, or cannot, participate in the
governing process, fine. But try
not to dirty the floor. Be no more
than a self-appointed gadfly if
you choose, but don't be a horse
fly.
