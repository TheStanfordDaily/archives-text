## But Rules Are Rules 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford cop didn't make
the parking rules; he just en
forces them. And man does he en
force them!
Take the oval and adjacent
parking area in front of the Law '
School. Naturally automobile
drivers must acknowledge the ex
istence of motorcycles and by
cycles. But must cars be ticketed
when parked in the motorcycle
area at night, when no more than I
a few two-wheeled behicles arc in J
sight? Rules are Rules.
Or take the oval parking area
itself. Cars certainly shouldn't be
parked near the oval's ends, for
passage problems, and pedestrian
crossings, are thereby made dis
proportionately difficult. But
when construction obviates both
reasons for the prohibition, and
there is no danger of parked cars
interfering with the construction
or vice versa, must the cars be
ticketed? Rules are Rules.
There is a parking problem, es
pecially for graduate students
who must drive to school. Who- {
ever has decided that the social |

utility of trees, lawn, and sea !
gulls is greater than a big, oval j
parking lot. need hardly have his j
(?) motives questioned. But
mindless bureaucracy is no less i
odious when operating in pleasant !
surroundings. When rules are en- j
forced without discretion, with
out, that is. regard for their rea- i
sons for existence, there are two
solutions: either the rules must
be changed, or those enforcing
them must become more discrimi
nating. Can we hope for the lat
ter? Or are rules really Rules?
