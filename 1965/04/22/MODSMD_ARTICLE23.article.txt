# The
						Candidates Speak On Off-Campus Issues

"Students and orgaizations should be free to discuss all questions
of interest to them and to express opinion publicly or privately
without penalty, and to promote the causes they support by distribut
ing literature, circulating petitions, picketing, or taking any other
peaceful action on or off the campus" (adapted from AAUP).
We believe that Legislature should have the right to decide on
which issues it will speak. The distinction which should be made is
not wheat her an issue is on- or off-campus, but wheather it involves
a legitimate area of student concern.
We believe that if the President of the A.S.S.U. takes specific
stands on very controversial issues he will: (1) convey to the out
side press opinions as representative of the entire student body when
in fact they are not, and (2) alienate large factions within the
University with whom he must be able to work smoothly.
On the other hand, the Vice-President can express controversial
opinions in a "semi-official" context. (Public reaction: "There is ob
viously some support or he wouldn't have spoken, but not all the
students agree or the President would have spoken.")

Being rather genially ambivalent of disposition, I perceive two
sides to the question of "off-campus issues-speaking."
On the one hand, a compelling argument against a legislature
taking a stand on off-campus issues is that student issues are gener
ally of such greater moment than the trivia of the body politic.
On the other hand, I don't see why an ASSU President, represent
ing the general will of the Stanford community and having been
granted an all-encompassing enabling act from the legislature, should I
not articulate positions on non-student issues. What else are student :
leaders for?
But the issues must be relevant ones, like:
• The present hapless state of affairs in Tanzania. 1 would
schedule a "Dump on Tanzania Week" to bring the heavy pressure
of student opinion to bear thereupon.

Stanford students —as students and as citizens- are directly ami
inevitably affected by the actions and attitudes which move to de j
fine the national society.
Students may at times question the advisability of LASSU stat-j
ing a position in the name of the associated students (the Stickney's|
Resolution being a case in point). However, it would seem inevitable
that there would develop some issues upon which students as a group |
would desire to take a stand.
Rather than ban by fiat student government from taking action)
on any issue that does not present itself only within the confines of
the Stanford campus, it would seem more reasonable for those whoj
do not feel that their representatives are capable of reflecting their
opinions or desires not to have an opinion expressed should
1) encourage students who they feel share their views to run for
office and
2) demand that their representatives in LASSU introduce rules:
within that body to restrict its action on types of issues hey
believe to be irrelevant, leaving open the possibility for ex
pression on more valid concerns.
Dave Robbing
We believe that it is the diversity of individual convictions which
concur or conflict to form a true intellectual dialogue on issues of
student concern.
It is in the legislature of the ASSU that the representatives of
Ihese varied interests arrive at discussions affecting members of the 1
Stanford community in their status as stuednts in particular and as
members of the university environment in general. It has been
shown, especially this past year, that LASSU operates at optimum
effectiveness when it legislates on matters affecting the student
in this university environment.
It is the position of this candidate that LASSU does not exercise
its proper representative function when it takes stands on issues
which do not concrn the student as a member of the university
community. We believe that the many students who would in
evitably disagree with the stand taken by the legislature would re
sent the idea of being "spoken for" by LASSU.
But in areas of vital concern to all students, we pi'opose that stu
dent opinion be expressed by the democratic procedure of an all
campus referendum.
