# ASSU Race: Behind the Scene
## 
### JOHN E. BONINE 
There is much more in the
current ASSU rat race than gen
erally meets the eye or the front
pages of the newspaper.
The ASSU campaign is the
scene of a bitter struggle be
tween the first and second gen
erations of student "activists,"
represented in candidates Sandy
Mac Ken/ie and Ed Shaw, and
in turn a united front against a
moderate, Dave Robbins.
MacKenzie
Mackenzie is putting together
a campaign from the remnants
of the Rosencranz-Wedin-Bryson
operation (GRIP) and advocating
the same policies. (At Tuesday
night's public meeting in Tresid
der he admitted having spent a
lot of time last fall "traveling
around with FSM, especially to
Los Angeles.")
MacKenzie has remained aloof
from ASSU activity this year,
and thus can try to lead the radi
cal revolt forward without hav
ing made any enemies. Converse
ly, he cannot claim any credit for
the on-campus reforms. He has
been serving as western regional
supervisor of the National Stu
dent Association.
(In the midst of the controversy
over LASSU involvement in off
campus issues, such as a Stick
ney's boycott, it is interesting to
note that not a single student
bothered to get himself nominated

j for either of the two elective
j NSA delegateships. NSA t a k es
i stands which purport to represent
| American "student opinion" on
i off-campus issues at its national
Congress in August.)
The old-time GRIP activists
are losing their grip on their
movement, meanwhile, as a result
! of last year's ASSU election which
saw their candidate, Bryson, de
feated by a moderate, Scott Mc-
Bride. Into the vacuum has
stepped the Graduate Coordinat
ing Committee.
Shaw
Ed Shaw has taken command
of much of tlie GCC revolt, and
i admitted at Tuesday's public
meeting that he has some GCC
support in his campaign and sup
ports many of their policies.
Shaw's support by the militants
| is not solid, however, because he
is distrusted by some aboul the
way that doctrinaire liberals dis
j trust Lyndon Johnson in prefer
; ence Xor Hubert Humphrey.
Robbjns
On the other side of the coin is
Dave Robbins. chairman of the

Pre-Reg Committee, who is be
ing ardently supported by th e
fraternities. He evidently views
Hie role of activism as primarily
useful for on-campus reforms.
Robbins is handicapped by his
public speaking style, which is
not as smooth as the other can
didates (although, thankfully,
less long-winded), but there is
some feeling that lie is a compe
tent administrator.
In particular, he is citing his
major reforming and overhauling
of the Pre-Reg program this year
as indicative of his talents, and
stressing the role of the ASSU
in the field of educational and on
campus reform.
Finally, there is the gadfly can
didate, Roger Magnuson, who lit
erally stole the show at: Tucs-I
day's meeting of the candidates.!
Magnuson serves the useful pur-!
j pose of deflating self-important j
; "student. leaders" who take stu
dent government too seriously.
He may prove more a threat than
: his opponents figure, although his
, campaign organization consists
|of a few sympathizers but no
real get -out-t he-vote machine.

Shaw
Ed Shaw has taken command
of much of tlie GCC revolt, and
i admitted at Tuesday's public
meeting that he has some GCC
support in his campaign and sup
ports many of their policies.
Shaw's support by the militants

is distrusted by some aboul the
way that doctrinaire liberals dis
j trust Lyndon Johnson in prefer

Robbjns
On the other side of the coin is
Dave Robbins. chairman of the

Pre-Reg Committee, who is be
ing ardently supported by th e
fraternities. He evidently views
Hie role of activism as primarily
useful for on-campus reforms.
Robbins is handicapped by his
public speaking style, which is
not as smooth as the other can
didates (although, thankfully,
less long-winded), but there is
some feeling that lie is a compe
tent administrator.
In particular, he is citing his
major reforming and overhauling
of the Pre-Reg program this year
as indicative of his talents, and
stressing the role of the ASSU
in the field of educational and on
campus reform.
Finally, there is the gadfly can
didate, Roger Magnuson, who lit
erally stole the show at: Tucs-I
day's meeting of the candidates.!
Magnuson serves the useful pur-!
j pose of deflating self-important j
; "student. leaders" who take stu
dent government too seriously.
He may prove more a threat than
: his opponents figure, although his
, campaign organization consists
|of a few sympathizers but no
real get -out-t he-vote machine.
There is much more in the
current ASSU rat race than gen
erally meets the eye or the front
pages of the newspaper.
The ASSU campaign is the
scene of a bitter struggle be
tween the first and second gen
erations of student "activists,"
represented in candidates Sandy
Mac Ken/ie and Ed Shaw, and
in turn a united front against a
moderate, Dave Robbins.
MacKenzie
Mackenzie is putting together
a campaign from the remnants
of the Rosencranz-Wedin-Bryson
operation (GRIP) and advocating
the same policies. (At Tuesday
night's public meeting in Tresid
der he admitted having spent a
lot of time last fall "traveling
around with FSM, especially to
Los Angeles.")
MacKenzie has remained aloof
from ASSU activity this year,
and thus can try to lead the radi
cal revolt forward without hav
ing made any enemies. Converse
ly, he cannot claim any credit for
the on-campus reforms. He has
been serving as western regional
supervisor of the National Stu
dent Association.
