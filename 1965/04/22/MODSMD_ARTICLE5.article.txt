# GOVERNOR SANFORD:
## Build Strength of State Gov't 
### BRUCE BURTON 
Terry San ford, former govern-,
nor of North Carolina, called fori
"a better working relationship";
between federal and state govern
ments last night, in an address
sponsored by the Stanford Young
Democrats.
Speaking before a small crowd |
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, San-i
ford expressed "growing concern" j
about increasing federal power.
The federal government has be
come "to hard to understand."
he said.

Sanford said international prob-j
lems prevent a lessening of fed-!
eral power: "I do not want to di-j
minish the strength of the federal j
/government, but rather to in
crease the relative strength of the!
state governments," he stated.
"Remote" Welfare
The ex-governor charged that j
the federal government, has be-j
come too "remote" and "too fan
away from the people" to effec
tively administer its aid and well
fare programs.
Sanford feels that welfare pro-;

grams especially would be better
left to the individual states. While I
the federal government has main
tained the unemployed, it "has|
failed to put people into a position}
to gain employment," he said.
He cited a growing trend among)
state governments to rely on the
federal government for both fi- !
nancing and administration of |
welfare programs. "The states;
have waited for the national gov-;
ernment to move in with federal
programs."
Sanford traced this trend back;
to the New Deal of the 1930'5,
when federal legislation to les
sen the effects of the Depression
led to a takeover of welfare proj
ects by the national government.
Offers Plans
lie emphasized "the need to find ;
a way to put the rcseponsibility I
on the states" to regain control
of aid programs, and "to do it in
such a way as to avoid their
shirking those responsibilities."
Sanford suggested that govern
ors should be "given more power,
as much as the President of the
United States relatively." Lack of
power prevents state executives
from using imagination in insti
tuting programs, he said.
He also called for better news
coverage of state aid and wel
fare programs, "so the public can
see what's gong on, and so pub
lic officials will serve the public,
not themselves."
Finally Sanford proposed more
efficient state planning offices
and an increase in state taxes.
Increase in state power requires
a strong financial base, he
said, and state legislatures which
refuse to grant money deny in
creased state responsibilities.
