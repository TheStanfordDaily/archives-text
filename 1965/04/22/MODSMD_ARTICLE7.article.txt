### 
The issue of the Legislature
speaking out on off-campus is
sues begun in LASSU last week
moved into the dorms yester
day as students began circulat
ing an initiative petition which
would ban LASSU stands on "off
campus issues."
The petition if signed by five
per cent of the student body and
submitted by ASSU President
Scott McÃŸride to the Legislature
at tonight's meeting would go on
the final spring ballot May 3
and 4.
It states: '"The government of
the Associated Students of Stan
ford University shall not take
position on matters other than
those pertaining to student af
fairs on the Stanford campus."
According to Bob Naylor, one
supporter of the petition, it was
initiated by Jim Greenley, the El
Toro LASSU representative,
Tuesday night.
Greenley was not available for
comment.
The petition has been circu
lating widely around campus. In
Flo Mo. Barbara Herwig, the Pol
oma LASSU representative, esti
mated that during dinner she got
125 signatures on it.
One estimate in .Roble was Ihat
nearly two-thirds of the girls had
signed it. although Annette
Amend who was directing the pe
tition circulation there, did not
know exactly how many signa
tures she had gotten.
Rob Sangster, one of five stu
dents named by Shaw to the Com
mittee of Fifteen discussion it,
indicated yesterday that three ad
ditional proposals would be sub
mitted to the Legislature tonight.
They are (1) to require the re
turn of any "off-campus" reso
lutions to the student body for a
poll and perhaps a 2/3 affirma
tive vote before the Legislature
jean act (2> that the result of the
poll be included in the text of the
; LASSU statement so that dis
senting opinions can be rcpre
| sented (3) that it be agreed not to
| make any statement concerning
j individual enterprises.
The original resolution, approv
ed last week by the Legislature.
' directed the By-Laws Committee
to consider the whole question
j and establish a committee of Fif
' teen to discuss the matter with
faculty and administrators.
