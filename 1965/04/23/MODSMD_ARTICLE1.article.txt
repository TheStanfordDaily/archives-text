# Shaw Would 'Continue Responsible Leadership'
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
A student government that can "effectuate
change, rather than constantly preach," is
the promise of Ed Shaw, candidate for the
pmsidency of the ASSU.
Economics major Shaw, currently Speaker
of LASSU, declared in an interview with The
Daily yesterday that he and his running mate,
junior Doug Sorensen, "propose to continue
the responsible leadership that has been in
evidence this year in accomplishing major
goals of the student body."
Shaw emphasized that under his leadership,
LASSU has finally been able to bring about
"needed changes" by opening up "effective
channels of communication" with the Univer
sity administration.
In the past, he noted, student leaders have
talked about reform, but have accomplished
little "due to their lack of access to those who
ultimately make decisions for change."
He cited the work of the tripartite Commit
tee of Fifteen, which reached a compromise

on LASSU's Judicial Competence Bill and is
now discussing University liquor policy, as
an example of what can be done through the
use of negotation and communication with
the administration and faculty.
Cooperation, Accomplishment
The candidate said that the success of this
cooperation "shows that we can work with the
administration and can accomplish change for
the student body."
"This is a proven fact. The work is going on
now," lie continued.
"We have been effective this year in creat
ing such things as an independent judicial sys
tem and in bringing about new social regul
lations. This is the type of student govern
ment we would like to continue."
Such an approach to student government,
he said, is "more realistic" than that of his
opponents.
Shaw's platform takes as its basis a state
ment of (he Wednesday Evening Discussion
Group (WEDG): "The University is an in
tellectual environment which is the ongoing

creation of its members."
"We emphasize that this means all mem
bers of the University community working to
gether," Shaw elaborated. "All segments of
the campus—students, faculty, and administra
tion must participate in the decision-making
machinery of the University."

The candidate believes that at present there
is need for greater faculty involvement in this
process: "The faculty are the continuous seg
ment of the University, and as such are the
most important part of it."
He added that more effort should be ex
pended toward discussing issues with those
members of t lie faculty and administration
who are less receptive toward student causes,
as little more can be done "by those who are
already convinced."
"These are the people to whom we should
be talking to reach decisions. To accomplish
anything, we have to be able to cooperate with
these people," he said.
Shaw feels that his experience last year as
Student Financial Manager and this year as
Speaker of LASSU has proven his ability to
achieve this sort of cooperation.
Curriculum Reform
The candidate agrees that there is a need
for changes in Stanford's academic curriculum,
especially in the area of General Studies.
"However," he noted, "although these

changes have been suggested for at least three
years now, no ASSU administration has yet
come up with the means through which they
could be effected.
"This year we finally have a framework in
the Committee of Fifteen through which this
work can be done."
Shaw also plans, it' elected, to negotiate with
this group for more student representation
on the various presidential committees of the
University.
Off-Campus Issue*
On the question of LASSU's right to assert
its will on off-campus issues, the candidate
noted that "there is a difficulty in defining
what we mean by 'off-campus'."
He suggested that the Legislature might
more usefully employ as a criterion "whether
or not a particular issue involves a legitimate
area of student concern."
Finally, Shaw reiterated his support of an
independent: Inter-Fraternity Council, citing
his and Sorensen's belief that "fraternities
should be allowed to handle their own affairs."
