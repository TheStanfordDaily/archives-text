## JAZZ TRACK Local Clubs Open to Minors 
### RICK BALE 
There seems to be a general
misconception on the campus that
live jazz in the Bay Area is only
to be had by those over 21. On the
contrary, the two most beautiful
clubs in the San Francisco area
are both open to minors.
Basin Street West, located on
Broadway in North Beach and
the newest of the jazz clubs, is
undoubtedly one of if not the
finest of the world's jazz estab
lishments.
With plush carpeting, wood
paneled walls, an excellent and ex
pensive sound system (even into
the rest rooms), raised decks, com
fortable seating for 350, and a
beautiful view of the skyline,
Basin Street West does much to
dispel the stereotype of the dark,
dingy jazz hangout.
Currently Appearing
Currently appearing there is
jazz singer Francis Faye, who will

be followed by the Bay Area re
turn of the Mastersounds for a
three week engagement begin
ning Wednesday.
The Mastersounds, a quartet
that has grouped and disbanded
several times in recent years, will
be joined by comedian Redd Foxx
April 28-May 2, and jazz singer
Joe Williams May 7 and 8.
On the other side of the Gold
en Gate in Sausalito is the most
beautiful and the most inexpen
sive of all Bay Area clubs, the Tri
dent, which is open to minors
with no cover, door, or minimum.
The club is set over the water on
a pier, and its all glass front pre
sents the finest view of all San
Francisco to be seen anywhere.
Sail-up Service
If you wish, just dock your
yacht at one of the Trident's
berths in front of the club, at no
cost. Simply step onto the sun
porch, grab a martini (or a coke,
if you can take the status let

down) from a passing waitress,
open the huge sliding glass door,
and step inside to some fine jazz
sounds.
On Sunday afternoons, you can
have a marvelous lunch out on
the deck, watch the sail boat raes
on the bay, and hear jazz from 3
o'clock on. If you want excellent
pre-jazz dining, one of San Fran
cisco's finest restaurants (Herb
Caen's favorite), Ondine's, is on
the floor above the Trident. Like
all Sausalito, the Trident could
care less what you wear, and it is
not unusual on a given night to
see attire ranging from sandals
and jeans (the in-crowd) to tuxes
and tails (the yacht-crowd).
Brasil '60, a latin vocal instru
mental group, will close out their
long stay this weekend before
heading over to the El Matador in
San Francisco. Opening at the Tri
dent Tuesday is the great jazz
pianist Bill Evans, back for an ex
tended one month visit.
For the 21 112
Not open to minors, but fea
turing what is probably the finest
jazz programming around is the
Jazz Workshop on Broadway.
Mose Allison is currently appear
ing, and will be joined (on the
same bill!) by Thelonious Monk
for three nights begining this eve
ning. Monk will then stay for a
stint until the arrival of John
Coltrane in early May.
Other establishments featuring
jazz on an occasional basis include
the Hotel Claremont in Berkeley,
Tin Pan Alley in Redwood City,
Hyatt Music Theatre, and the
Circle Star Theatre. So be you
over or under the magic age,
there is plenty of excellent jazz
for all in the Bay Area.

clubs in the San Francisco area
are both open to minors.
Basin Street West, located on
Broadway in North Beach and
the newest of the jazz clubs, is
undoubtedly one of if not the
finest of the world's jazz estab
lishments.
With plush carpeting, wood
paneled walls, an excellent and ex
pensive sound system (even into
the rest rooms), raised decks, com
fortable seating for 350, and a
beautiful view of the skyline,
Basin Street West does much to
dispel the stereotype of the dark,
dingy jazz hangout.
Currently Appearing
Currently appearing there is
jazz singer Francis Faye, who will

be followed by the Bay Area re
turn of the Mastersounds for a
three week engagement begin
ning Wednesday.
The Mastersounds, a quartet
that has grouped and disbanded
several times in recent years, will
be joined by comedian Redd Foxx
April 28-May 2, and jazz singer
Joe Williams May 7 and 8.
On the other side of the Gold
en Gate in Sausalito is the most
beautiful and the most inexpen
sive of all Bay Area clubs, the Tri
dent, which is open to minors
with no cover, door, or minimum.
The club is set over the water on
a pier, and its all glass front pre
sents the finest view of all San
Francisco to be seen anywhere.
Sail-up Service
If you wish, just dock your
yacht at one of the Trident's
berths in front of the club, at no
cost. Simply step onto the sun
porch, grab a martini (or a coke,
if you can take the status let

down) from a passing waitress,
open the huge sliding glass door,
and step inside to some fine jazz
sounds.
On Sunday afternoons, you can
have a marvelous lunch out on
the deck, watch the sail boat raes
on the bay, and hear jazz from 3
o'clock on. If you want excellent
pre-jazz dining, one of San Fran
cisco's finest restaurants (Herb
Caen's favorite), Ondine's, is on
the floor above the Trident. Like
all Sausalito, the Trident could
care less what you wear, and it is
not unusual on a given night to
see attire ranging from sandals
and jeans (the in-crowd) to tuxes
and tails (the yacht-crowd).
Brasil '60, a latin vocal instru
mental group, will close out their
long stay this weekend before
heading over to the El Matador in
San Francisco. Opening at the Tri
dent Tuesday is the great jazz
pianist Bill Evans, back for an ex
tended one month visit.
For the 21 112
Not open to minors, but fea
turing what is probably the finest
jazz programming around is the
Jazz Workshop on Broadway.
Mose Allison is currently appear
ing, and will be joined (on the
same bill!) by Thelonious Monk
for three nights begining this eve
ning. Monk will then stay for a
stint until the arrival of John
Coltrane in early May.
Other establishments featuring
jazz on an occasional basis include
the Hotel Claremont in Berkeley,
Tin Pan Alley in Redwood City,
Hyatt Music Theatre, and the
Circle Star Theatre. So be you
over or under the magic age,
there is plenty of excellent jazz
for all in the Bay Area.


There seems to be a general
misconception on the campus that
live jazz in the Bay Area is only
to be had by those over 21. On the
contrary, the two most beautiful
clubs in the San Francisco area
are both open to minors.
