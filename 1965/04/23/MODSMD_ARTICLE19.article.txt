"The role of the critic is to help
people see what is in the work,
what is in it that shouldn't be,
what is not in it that could be,"
writes Pauline Kael, adding that
"The art of the critic is to trans
mit his knowledge of and enthusi
asm for art to others."
And Miss Kael is certainly a
critic. She writes, bitterly — and
often pungently—about what she
doesn't like. ("One, Two, Three
is overwrought, tasteless, and
offensive — a comedy that pulls
out laughs the way a catheter
draws urine.")
She writes enthusiastically
about what she does like. ("In
The Seven Samurai, the greatest
battle epic since The Birth of a
Nation of 1915, Akira Kurosawa
achieves what modern American
and European epic makers vainly
attempt: the excitement of the
senses.")
Unimpressable
Miss Kael is never impressed
by a film's reputation ("I
wouldn't have thought A View
from the Bridge was worth much
discussion, but it has gotten such
very-important-picture treatment

from the press that I think maybe
I should say a few unkind
words.")
She is a very personal critic,
bringing her own definite and
distinctive prejudices to a film.
("Perhaps the marriage in La,
Notte just lasted too long: I don't
know anybody who has stayed
married for ten years — nobody
except relatives.")
But if I occasionally object to
her personal approach, I must
praise her for avoiding the trap
of a theory of film criticism. In
deed, several of her most vitriolic
essays are devoted to a painstak
ing dismemberment of some cur
rent theories.
And her knowledgeability is
staggering. In her review of Billy
Budd, she refers to Dostoyevsky
(The Brothers Karamazov and
The Idiot), several of Robert
Ryan's films, and Pierre and—of
course—Billy Budd by Melville.
Constant Carping
But I must protest her constant
carping at other critics' reviews.
Her review of Lolita seems as
much an attack on the reviews
of the film in Time, the Observer,
Show, the New Republic and The
New York Times - whose critic
Bosley Crowther is one of her
favorite targets — as it is her
own opinion of the film.
Her reviews are always inter
esting, usually amusing and gen
erally provocative. Even when I
disagree with her — and I fre
quently do — I find her viewpoint
refreshing. She belongs to no
"school" but the school of people
who like movies and want them
to get better.
She combines plain old com
mon sense with a devastating wit
two things noticably lacking in
most film reviews — and uses
both with intelligence in this, a
collection of reviews and essays
that should be required reading
for all cinema addicts.
