### 
BERKELEY (AP) Dismissal
or suspension of four University
of California students for flaunt
ing an obscene four-letter word
on campus prompted a protest
rally Thursday which drew up to
3,000 curious students.
The developments marked a
new crisis in a dispute over
whether free speech is infringed
by banning public use of an ob
scene four-letter word.
"Today is the beginning of a
new and larger student protest
that will perhaps overshadow
those of last term," Michael Ler
ner, an economics graduate stu
dent, told the crowd.
'Quick Dismissal'
Some regents demanded quick
dismissal of the students in
volved. Wednesdaq, on the recom
mendation of a faculty commit
tee, the university dismissed Ar
thur Goldberg, 23, an education
graduate student from Los An
geles. Goldberg had been promi
nent with Mario Savio in the Free
Speech Movement. Dismissal, un
like expulsion, allows possibility
of reinstatement.
Two students, Michael L. Klein,
2." >, an English graduate student
from Minneapolis, Minn., and Ni
cholas Vzegintzov, 2.1, a business
administration graduate student
from London, were suspended un
til the fall semester.
David A. Bills, 19, a freshman
from Belvedere, was suspended
for the remainder of the semes
ter.
Last December, campus tur
moil over free speech brought the
arrest of nearly 800 sit-in demon
strators, many of whom had to
be dragged out of Sproul Hall,
the administration building. Sa
vio, then a student, was one of
them.
New Plan
Meyerson presented the Univer
sity of California Board of Re
gents Thursday with a faculty
supported plan for improving stu
dent disciplinary action at the
demonstration - ridden Berkeley
campus.
The plan reportedly recom
mends simplification of student
disciplinary hearings and su g
gests the possibility of appoint
ing a hearing officer. The regents
took no action on the report,
listed at the top of the agenda
for their current two-day session
on the UCLA campus.
