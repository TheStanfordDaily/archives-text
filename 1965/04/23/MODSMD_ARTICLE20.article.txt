# 'Cheyenne Autumn' a Long Listless, Uninspired Film
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
The most remarkable fact about "Cheyenne Autumn" is that in
its premiere engagements in New York and Los Angeles, it was
shown on a reserved-seat basis with an incredible $2.50 to $4.00
price scale. Make no mistake about it, there is nothing in this long
and uninspired film to warrant such high-class exhibition.

at the end, veteran director John Ford's account of the Cheyenne's
return to their homeland in a listless, ponderous business.
To be sure, there are possibilities in the idea of presenting the
plight of dispossessed Indians pursued by the U.S. Cavalry in their
arduous and courageous homeword trek. But neither the ardor nor
the courage are convincingly depicted, and this potentially engrossing
situation is subverted by a stereotyped conception.
Stereotyped Boles
In order for the experience to be stirring, individual characters
among both the Indians and the Cavalry must be believably realized.
Here, however, the Indians emerge as a mass of impossibly noble
savages, and the Cavalry might have been borrowed from any third
rate Western.
James Webb's screenplay is largely responsible for making the
characters so removed. He does not supply a sufficient amount of
dialogue to let us know the characters well enough to either sym
pathize with or understand them, and what little dialogue there is
sounds flat. Webb has been particularly unkind to the Indians, who
are made to speak in the type of stilted, humiliating phrases which
Hollywood long ago devised for them.
John Ford must also take his share of the blame for his curiously
lackluster direction. He has unaccountably structured his film with
irritating monotony; he shifts the focus back and forth between
the Indians and the Calvary. The constant changes impede char
acter development and Ford compounds the damage by devoting too
much time to static gunplay.
Univolved Actors
Under the circumstances, the actors can hardly be blamed for
their uninvolvement in the goings-on. Surprisingly, considering the
dialogue supplied them, it is the actors playing Indians who fare
best. Dolores Del Rio (remember her?), with her extraordinarily ex
pressive face, gives conviction to an inconsistently written and al
together too brief role, and Ricardo Montalban and Gilbert Roland
work diligently at getting some badly needed emotion into their
roles as opposing Cheyenne chiefs.
On the other team, Richard Widmark plays a stock Cavalry
officer with a total absence of flair, Patrick (son of John) Wayne
is offensive as a vengeful soldier, and poor Carroll Baker struggles
to little purpose in the foolish, unmotivated role of a Quaker school
mistress who is sympathetic to the Indians. Only Edward G. Robin
son, in several brief appearances as the Secretary of the Interior,
manages to have some vitality.
The single point during which the film has energy is a com
pletely irrelevant scene in Dodge City in which James Stewart
has great fun playing Wyatt Earp. Done as parody, however, the
tone of the scene is wildly off-key with the solemnity of the rest
of the proceedings. The presence of the sun merely serves to highlight
the carelessness of the entire film.
