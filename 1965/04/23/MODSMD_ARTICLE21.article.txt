# Indian Oarsmen Seek to Swamp IRA Champs Cal For First Time Since '57
## 
### 
Stanford's unbeaten crew will,
try In swamp California's Golden!
Bears this Saturday for the first!
time in eight years. The "Bigi
How" will begin at 3:30 at the
Oakland Rstuary, preceded by two
frosh races and a JV contest ;
.starting at 2:30.
If statistics mean anything, Cal
will be a slight favorite over
the Tribe. Two weeks ago Cal
beat San Diego State by l'ourl
length at the Long Beach Regatta,
while Stanford later stroked to a|
1 :J 4-length victory over the same]
crew. In addition, the Indian crew,
averaging <>' 1 'a" and 183 is slight- 112
ly smaller and less experienced:
than the Bears.
Cal ( oach Not ( <»i»fi<l<'iit
California Coach Jim Lemmon,
however, is far from confident

that his defending Pacific Coast;
and IRA champions will coast to]
victory. He was clearly noi
pleased with the performance of
his boats in the rough water at
Long Beach.
The biggest problem 1 a e in g
L e m m on th is year is re
placing the seven-stroke comb-!
ination of graduated Steve John
son and (Jus Schilling. At Long
Beach, Lemmon used Mike Page,
number 1 last year, at the stroke
and former JV how man Ron
Sellers at number 7.
The Bears have five veterans!
returning from the IRA eham
pionship boat, in sharp contrast to
Will Condon's crew marie up of |
mores. The only senior in the
Stanford boat is coxwain Rick Ce-i
derwall. Condon does have some
some talented oarsmen nonethe
less. Stroke Steve Parker sat out ;

last season after transferring]
from Cornell, where he stroked
with the lrosh. 2-man Bill Stump
was most valuable oarsman on
last year's freshmen crew, and
Captain Larry Hough is manning
the same number 7 position he
realizes that his crew will have
to row much better than they have!
to win the race, but he feels thai
the task can be done.
.IV and Frosh to Row
The Indian Frosh and JV boats,
who joined with the varsity for a!
clean sweep last week against i
Oregon State, Southern Califor-!
nia, and San Diego State will face'
an unbeaten JV boat and a once
beaten frosh boal.
The Tribe JV, averaging (>'2 1 -".
will include five seniors and will j
be coxed by Charlie Blitzer. The j
frosh, averaging ti'l" and IXI i
pounds, will be guided by Bob
Crane.
