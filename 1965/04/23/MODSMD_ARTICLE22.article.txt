â–  the surprising University of Ore
gon Saturday afternoon at Eu
gene. Oregon is undefeated
against PAC competition so far.!
Oregon has defeated both Wash- ;
ington and California. They have
lost to San Jose.
Webfoot coach Bill Bowerman
expects close races in all the run
ning events, especially the mile
and two-mile. Oregon sophomore
Wade Bell will battle Dave Deub
ner and Harlan Andrews m the:
mile. All three boys are close to!
the 4:09 mark. Bell has run 4:09.9, |
: Deubner, 4:09.2, and Andrews,
4:08.7.
! Schlieke Concentrates on 2-mile
j Stanford's Payton Jordan vv ill!
! not run Paul Schlieke (4:05.7) in j
j order to save him for the two-mile j
j where he is likely to have hi s
: hands full with Ken Moore.
Moore has a besl lime of 8:58.0.
Schlieke has the second best lime;
| in Ihe conference with a timing l
S of 8:51.4.
NCAA finalist in Hie 100 and j
; 220. Dave Blunt, and Jim Wood!
I who has done 9.6 this year should !
give Stanford sprinters Larry i
Questad, Dale Rubin, and Eric I
Frische a bad time.
The Tribe should have no 1

trouble in the 220, however. All
four Stanford men Questad, Ken
Fraser, Rubin, and Frische have
faster times than Wood.
Fraser and Bob Mclntyre have
a definite edge over their rivals,
Gordon Payne and A 1 O'Leary, in
the 440. Fraser has run 47.8 and
Mclntyre, 47.9. Neither of the
Oregon runners has broken 48.5
yet.
Dave Deubner, 1:51.7, and
Brian Clarke, 1:52.6, should have
a good race in the 880.
Hurdles To lie Tiglit
A real battle shapes up in the
hurdles. In the 330 intermediates
Indians Bud Walsh and Greg
Ford have bests of 37.7 and 37.8
while Webfoot John Butler has
a best of 37.7 also.
In the 120 high hurdles 1 hroo
Oregon runners have better times
than Greg Ford's 14.6.
Walsh, Mclntyre, and Jo h n
Goode should pick up nine points
for Stanford in the longjump if
they are around their previous
best performances.
Pole vaulter Chuck Smith did
not make the trip due to an in
jury. therefore Jim Eshelman
must shoulder the load. Eshelman
has a best of lS^ 1 !:". His oppo
nent, Gerry Moro has an identi-

I cal best mark.
GO Foot Shotputter
Oregon has a 60 foot shotputter
in Neal Steinhauer, thus the bat -
J tie will bo between Bruce Wil-j
| helm. Rob Stoecker, and Webfoot j
! Barry McFadden for second place, i
Stanford has a definite edge in
both of the relays. The Indian!
! combination of Frisehe, Rubin,'
jMclntyre, and Questad have out-
I run their opponents 40.9 to 41.6
j in the 440 relay.
In the mile relay Stanford has j
an edge of 2 seconds. Oregon's
best is 3:16.3. and Stanford's is
3:14.5.
