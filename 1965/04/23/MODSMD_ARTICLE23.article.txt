The Stanford Indians wlil ho fighting to main
tain their precai .ous league lead in ih»s weekend's
games with USC and UCLA. As of now the Tribe
is ahead of the Bruins in tho California Intercol
legiate Baseball Association race by a slim 11
percentage points. All three contests arc slated for
Sunken Diamond.
USC and UCLA a e not the only threats, how
ever, a.-- only l 'l> games separate Stanford from

season over, this is one of iho tightest races in
recent years.
Perennial powers USC and Santa Clara are ci.r
■•ently occupying the last two places in the It ague
standings. California and Santa Barbara are tied
for third. Previously lightly-regarded UCSB is no
pushover as both Stanford and USC will attest.

Trojans Need Wins
Friday afternoon at 3 p.m. the Indians will face
USC. Although the Trojans have a 2-4 record
(Stanford's is 5-4), they are still very much in the

running. As far as they are concerned the signifi
cant statistic is the quality in the lost column.
Victories can he added, but defeats cannot be
erased.
At noon Saturday, Stanford and UCLA will
square-off in a very important douhleheader. If
one team can win hoth games, that team will have
taken a large step towards a berth in the NCAA
tournament. ll' the teams split, then any of the
other four contestants could move up in the stand
ings.
This especially holds true for USC. Should
USC beat Stanford and sweep it's douhleheader
with Santa Clara and should Stanford and UCLA
split, the Trojans would occupy first place.
Troy lias Good Opportunity
The Trojans are in a good position to do just
this. They only have one man batting over .400,
but they have seven men hitting between .306 and
.338. They also have a hard throwing pitcher, John
Herbst, who has a 2.83 earned run average and
his struck out 7H batters in 57 innings.
opposing Herbst will be Stanford's ace, Daro
Quiring. Quiring's record is now ti-1 including last
Friday's 15-10 win over the Bruins. Coach Dutch
Fehi'ing is hoping that Quiring can go a full nine
inings again. Feh ring is sure that his sophomore
pitcher will give Trojan batters a much rougher
time than the Bruins had.
John Mason and either Terry Docken or Mike
Connelly will pitch Saturday. Probable starters for

, UCLA will be Rill Brasher and
Ken Gore. The strong point of
the Bruins, though, is their hit
ting.
Bruins Have Strong Hit tors
Second baseman Bill Macri is
eurently the second leading hit
ter in the league. He is hitting
.432. Behind him is hard-hitting
catcher Jim Collet to at .385. Two
other .300 plus hitters are short
stop Johnny Jones, .326 and right
fielder Rich Gagnulin, .317. Third
baseman Fred Dwyer isn't set
ting the rest of the league on
fire, but he blasted two home
runs in last Friday's tilt with
Stanford.
Coach Fehring will start hi s
usual line-up with the exception
of catcher Jim Hibbs. He has
three stitches in one of his throw
ing fingers as a result of a mis
caught foul-tip a week ago.
Sophomore Bill Boles will start
for Ilibbs behind the plate and
Hibbs will start at third base.
The rest of the line-up will bo:
Ron Yett, rightfield; Bob Cox,
centerfield; Ilibbs; Pete Middle
kyuff, first base; Dick Swan,
; shortstop; Steve Hovley, left field;
Bill Boles, catcher.
Next Wednesday the Indians
travel up to Cal to make up a
