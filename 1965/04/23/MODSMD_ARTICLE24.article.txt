HOUSTON — The Houston As
tros tested ihe tinted skylights
of the Astrodome during an after
noon workout yesterday and said
they believe the glare problem
has been solved.
"Only about one-half of the
dome has been painted so far,
but I'm sure afternoon games can
bo played without difficulty,"
said Manager Luman Harris.
Rusty Staub, young fight field
er, agreed.
"You can see the bail now,"
Staub said. "Before they started
painting, vou couldn't see it at
all."
Houston outfielders had diffi
culty following th<> ball because
of the sun glaring through the
1.596 plastic skylights.
