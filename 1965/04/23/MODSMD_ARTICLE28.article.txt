# The 						'Educational Campaign'

Politics' is the art of the possible — plus ten
per cent.
—Professor Otis A. Pease
All candidates for political office have one
over-riding desire in common: to be elected.
And the candidates for ASSU president are
no exception—this year or any other.
With the primary only a few days away, they
are already running hard and fast. They are
garnering supporters. They are wooing the
stereotyped interest groups. They are skillfully
ducking the "hot issues."
In short, they are—like all good politicians—
playing the percentages.
Well, there is more than a little room within
the university community for good politicians—
for men who can reach out for power and w in
power and use power with intelligence and re
straint to move the university nearer Utopia.
But power is not an end in itself, and—here
more than anywhere else—the means in which
power is sought must be able to stand the rigors
of idealistic justification.
Personal attacks, slander, and rumor-monger

ing luive no place in any political contest—and
certainly no place at Stanford. There seem to be
more than enough legitimate issues to go around
without dragging in a plethora of those which
aren't.
But "clean campaigning is in itseli not enough.
Now, more than ever, campaigns must be
truely educational—in their tone and content,
persuasive evidence of the serious worth of stu
dent government.
Unfortunately, the phrase "I'm running an
educational campaign," is, historically, an apolo
getic euphemism for a lost political cause.
Yet, this year, if all campaigns are not in their
main thrust "educational campaigns," then, no
matter who wins, we—the university—will have
lost—lost a rare opportunity to face, in terms of
a real political choice, the very genuine funda
mental issues which this year have plunged the
entire structure of higher education into a state
of crisis.
In short: untrammcled idealism is a luxury
within political arenas. But within the university
community it is a present necessity.
