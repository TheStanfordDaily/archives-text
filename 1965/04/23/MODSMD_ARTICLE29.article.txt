## Once Again, Mr. Naylor 
### 
Editor. The Daily:
Mr. Naylor's article "The Sea
son of ASSU Absurdity" warrants
comment.
Having established the fact that
student (and faculty) apathy to
wards student affairs is prevalent
and predominant (can anyone ef
fectively argue this point'?), he
further establishes that this is
laudable because "students are
just not coequal with the faculty
and administration."
Student government is not
much different than a marriage,
Mr. Naylor; if one puts nothing
in it, then of course it becomes
irrelevant. Nothing profound
about this.
However, if student and faculty
can be roused from a phlegmatic
sleep of the centuries, as seems
to be happening, then it is reason
able to assume that much which
is meaningful in student-faculty
liasons (such as non-academic con
tact, sharing of power and value
development) can occur.
The last sentence in Mr. Nay
lor's article states that it would
be a "mistake to give them (refer
ring to students) any real power."
Of course. It was a mistake to
have "given" certain individuals
on campus the power which they
now possess and have misused.
My dear sir, it has always been
the mistake of mankind to "give
away" power. Doesn't history
past and current make this
blatantly obvious, Mr. Naylor?
Power must be balanced and
eonrtolled, by judicial process and
should involve all eschelons of the
university. If you know of an
alternative, you ought to so state.
To merely mention or indicate
that power should not be given
away is insufficient and inade
quate. in my estimation.

• Conine Irresponsible
Editor, The Daily:
In his article in the April 22
Daily about the ASSU presi
dential race. Mr. John Bonine
demonstrated gross editorial ir

responsibility in his statements
concerning one of the president
ial candidates, Sandy Mackenzie.
Bonine states that Mackenzie
had admitted "traveling around
with FSM, especially to Los An
geles." The statement is incorrect
on three counts.
First, such a statement was
never made either in Tresidder
or anywhere else by Mackenzie.
Second, Mackenzie never
"traveled around with FSM." His
only contact with the FSM was
as an investigator for the Na
tional Student Association which
involved a number of trips to the
Berkeley campus to interview and
observe.
Third, Mackenzie never traveled
to Los Angeles or anywhere else
with FSM. He went to Los An
geles as a representative of NAS
over the spring break to help out
other colleges with their pro
gramming problems. He didn't go
to Los Angeles at any time this
fall.
The misquoting anl inaecurcies
in Bonine's article- and the im
plications he finds in these
"quotes" leads one to question
seriously the motivation and sin
cerity of the article.

• Don't Speak, LASSU
Editor. The Daily:
Sunken beneath the venom in
Mr. Sangster's letter of April 22
are perhaps one or two points
worthy of consideration. Mr.
Sangster states that LASSU will
only speak out on situations
where the student body feels a
"deep concern" and will only make
statements "commensurate with
the nature and extent of the in
formation available."
These arc nice phrases, but the
'lard fact is that if LASSU mem
bers are "deeply concerned" they
will assume the student body is
too. And people who introduce res
olutions, whether about Stiekney's
or Vietnam, will surely claim to
have sufficient "qualified inform

a (ion." In effect LASSU's claim
to speak out on all issues is
qualified only by the will of its
members.
Mr. Sangster seems to believe
that because the Committee of 15
includes Mr. Naylor, be is bound
to support the LASSU resolution
asserting its right to speak out.
Perhaps Mr. Sangster wants
LASSU members of the Commit
tee of 15 to be all partisans of the
GCC, but the Speaker was respon
ible enough to allow two sides of
student opinion to be represented.
Indeed, the Speaker has often
seemed to bo more responsible
than his GCC and crypto-GCC sup
porters. The extent of the inde
pendence he will show next year
from his supporters if elected
ASSU president is an important
campaign issue as is the the con
nection between other candidates
and the fraternities.
Ironically, Mr. Naylor's peti
tion to deny LASSU the right to
speak on non student issues can
only help the present Speaker
and his supporters; if the petition
is approved, voter need only
consider the on-campus record of
the candidates, and the less rad
ical among the students will have
less fear of domination by the
left.
