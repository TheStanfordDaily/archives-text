Presidential unhopeful Rog
er Magnuson, Incognito in
.shades and a black glove,
sauntered up to the door of
the ASSU offices in Tresid
der yestertlay afternoon and
posted his "Nine Ambivalent
Theses."
Informed of the action,
stunned ASSU officials re
mained closed-mouthed, except
one secretary who comment
ed, "This unwarranted action
will no doubt have repercus
sions."
Among' Magnuson's theses
were the following - :
• Ambiguity in the pursuit
of ambivalence is no vice;
clarity in the pursuit of com
mitment is no virtue.
• That student government
governs best which governs
most ambivalently.
• An enlightened student
government is one winch does
not interfere with the stu
dent's legitimate educational
aspirations: namely, the per-

ception of ethical norms by
intellectual means.
• Further, it must be un
derstood that student govern
ment is like a sewer: what
you get out of it depends on
what you put into it.
• The worst onus which
can l»e inflicted upon student
government is to take it ser
iously.
• The correct attitude to
ward it is rather the genial
ambivalence one feels for a
loveable, if somewhat clumsy,
koala bear.
• But it should also be
recognized that student gov.
eminent has some quite san
guinary virtues, especially
with regard to the production
of the parliamentarians, Rob
ert's Rules-wary Rotarians,
and s 111 d e 111 government
leaders of the future.
• No one loses his ambi
valence except that he Im\ as
Udmiind Burke once put it,
"under some delusion."
