# Today and Tomorrow
## The 						Dollar and the Found: Attacking Trade Deficits 
### Walter Lippmann 
There is good reason to think that the President's program for
the defense of the dollar, as laid down in his message of Feb. 6, is
proving to be a notable success. While the reports from the busi
ness corporations participating in the voluntary program will not
be in until the middle of the month, the secretary of commerce is

confident that the corporate pro-"<
gram will be successful: "With
out having any specific figures
we are very much encouraged by
the way in which the program is
being received."
We do know that bank loans
abroad have been greately re
duced. The applications of the in
terest equalization tax to bank
loans, together with the volun
tary cooperation of the banks,
has cut down substantially Ihe
flow of dollars to Europe.
There is objective evidence of
this in the fact that before Presi-!
dent Johnson's message in Feb-;
uary the 90-day rate for "Euro
dollars" (which means the dollars
on deposit in banks overseas that
are held and lent abroad> was!
4.5' A. It is now i.75'7r. This means
that in Europe dollars have be
come scarcer and dearer.
Deficit Not Chronic
The President's program for
the defense of the dollar has been
well conceived and cai lied out;
the business and banking com
munities have shown a high de
gree of public understanding. The
basis of the achievement is the ex
traordinary strength and flexibil
ity of the American economy. It
has been expanding without in
flation, and the surplus of our ex
ports over imports has become
very great indeed. It has been
demonstrated to the world that
ihr American deficit in the bal
ance of payments is not chronic
and structural but controllable
and, if we choose to make it so, I
transient.
It is in the perspective of the)
American program that the Brit
ish problem and the British]
economy differs not only in size j
but in kind from the American.!
The sharpest proof of this is that j
Pr esident Johnson has been able j
to defend the dollar without de I
fating, v. ithoul reducing the pub-j
lie's buying power. Indeed, while
he has been defending the dollar.!
American business has been boom- 1
ing and unemployment has fallen. !
The Wilson government has had j
no such attractive possibility; it !
could not eat its cake and have
it. too, thus defying the financial j
orthodoxy of the 19th century, j
The chancellor of the exchequer j
has had to bring in a budget I

which will appease the bankers
and the speculators and the fi
nance ministries on the continent.
To defend the pound sterling in
the face of their opinion, he tuts
to bear down on the British pub
lic and to risk a slow-down in the
sorely needed modernization and
expansion of British industry.
Defending the Dollar
On the early returns, the fi
nancial augurs seem favorable.
The British budget appears to be
tough enough to ward off specu
lation against the pound and to
| make it likely that, the British
I government will be able to sup
port the pound at its present rate,
i But only a wild optimist would
say that this is more than a
breathing spell or that anything
has been done or is within the
power of the British government
! to do which will solve the sterling
problem soon. 11 does appear, how
ever, that Britain is reasonably
| certain to be allowed to draw
I enough hard international money
j to weather iis immediate difficul
j lies and proceed with the struc
tural adjustment of British in
; dustry.
But we must keep in mind the
I prediction made at the end of the
I President's message lasl Feb
i ruary. He said then that our suc
j cess in defending the dollar would
! confront the rest of the world
| with the problem of finding suffi
i eient international liquidity and
bank reserves. The problem is al
ready presenting itself.
Drying Up Deficits
The solution of this problem is
by no means impossible, and,
though there are important dif
ferences between the United
States and France and some other
continental countries, President
Johnson's successful defense of
the dollar has greatly improved
the American bargaining position
in the coming negotiations. Hav
ing demonstrated that we can
defend the dollar by reducing our
big but not necessary deficit in
the balance of payments, having
demonstrated also that the drying
up of our deficits will create dif
ficulties for the Europeans, we
are in a strong position to argue
for a reform of the international
monetary system which will per
mit an expansion in world trade.

Drying Up Deficits
The solution of this problem is
by no means impossible, and,
though there are important dif
ferences between the United
States and France and some other
continental countries, President
Johnson's successful defense of
the dollar has greatly improved
the American bargaining position
in the coming negotiations. Hav
ing demonstrated that we can
defend the dollar by reducing our
big but not necessary deficit in
the balance of payments, having
demonstrated also that the drying
up of our deficits will create dif
ficulties for the Europeans, we
are in a strong position to argue
for a reform of the international
monetary system which will per
mit an expansion in world trade.
There is good reason to think that the President's program for
the defense of the dollar, as laid down in his message of Feb. 6, is
proving to be a notable success. While the reports from the busi
ness corporations participating in the voluntary program will not
be in until the middle of the month, the secretary of commerce is

confident that the corporate pro-"<
gram will be successful: "With
out having any specific figures
we are very much encouraged by
the way in which the program is
being received."
We do know that bank loans
abroad have been greately re
duced. The applications of the in
terest equalization tax to bank
loans, together with the volun
tary cooperation of the banks,
has cut down substantially Ihe
flow of dollars to Europe.
There is objective evidence of
this in the fact that before Presi-!
dent Johnson's message in Feb-;
uary the 90-day rate for "Euro
dollars" (which means the dollars
on deposit in banks overseas that
are held and lent abroad> was!
4.5' A. It is now i.75'7r. This means
that in Europe dollars have be
come scarcer and dearer.
Deficit Not Chronic
The President's program for
the defense of the dollar has been
well conceived and cai lied out;
the business and banking com
munities have shown a high de
gree of public understanding. The
basis of the achievement is the ex
traordinary strength and flexibil
ity of the American economy. It
has been expanding without in
flation, and the surplus of our ex
ports over imports has become
very great indeed. It has been
demonstrated to the world that
ihr American deficit in the bal
ance of payments is not chronic
and structural but controllable
and, if we choose to make it so, I
transient.
It is in the perspective of the)
American program that the Brit
ish problem and the British]
economy differs not only in size j
but in kind from the American.!
The sharpest proof of this is that j
Pr esident Johnson has been able j
to defend the dollar without de I
fating, v. ithoul reducing the pub-j
lie's buying power. Indeed, while
he has been defending the dollar.!
American business has been boom- 1
ing and unemployment has fallen. !
The Wilson government has had j
no such attractive possibility; it !
could not eat its cake and have
it. too, thus defying the financial j
orthodoxy of the 19th century, j
The chancellor of the exchequer j
has had to bring in a budget I

which will appease the bankers
and the speculators and the fi
nance ministries on the continent.
To defend the pound sterling in
the face of their opinion, he tuts
to bear down on the British pub
lic and to risk a slow-down in the
sorely needed modernization and
expansion of British industry.
Defending the Dollar
On the early returns, the fi
nancial augurs seem favorable.
The British budget appears to be
tough enough to ward off specu
lation against the pound and to
| make it likely that, the British
I government will be able to sup
port the pound at its present rate,
i But only a wild optimist would
say that this is more than a
breathing spell or that anything
has been done or is within the

I enough hard international money

Drying Up Deficits
The solution of this problem is
by no means impossible, and,
though there are important dif
ferences between the United
States and France and some other
continental countries, President
Johnson's successful defense of
the dollar has greatly improved
the American bargaining position
in the coming negotiations. Hav
ing demonstrated that we can
defend the dollar by reducing our
big but not necessary deficit in
the balance of payments, having
demonstrated also that the drying
up of our deficits will create dif
ficulties for the Europeans, we
are in a strong position to argue
for a reform of the international
monetary system which will per
mit an expansion in world trade.
There is good reason to think that the President's program for
the defense of the dollar, as laid down in his message of Feb. 6, is
proving to be a notable success. While the reports from the busi
ness corporations participating in the voluntary program will not
be in until the middle of the month, the secretary of commerce is

confident that the corporate pro-"<
gram will be successful: "With
out having any specific figures
we are very much encouraged by
the way in which the program is
being received."
We do know that bank loans
abroad have been greately re
duced. The applications of the in
terest equalization tax to bank
loans, together with the volun
tary cooperation of the banks,
has cut down substantially Ihe
flow of dollars to Europe.
There is objective evidence of
this in the fact that before Presi-!
dent Johnson's message in Feb-;
uary the 90-day rate for "Euro
dollars" (which means the dollars
on deposit in banks overseas that
are held and lent abroad> was!
4.5' A. It is now i.75'7r. This means
that in Europe dollars have be
come scarcer and dearer.
Deficit Not Chronic
The President's program for
the defense of the dollar has been
well conceived and cai lied out;
the business and banking com
munities have shown a high de
gree of public understanding. The
basis of the achievement is the ex
traordinary strength and flexibil
ity of the American economy. It
has been expanding without in
flation, and the surplus of our ex
ports over imports has become
very great indeed. It has been
demonstrated to the world that
ihr American deficit in the bal
ance of payments is not chronic
and structural but controllable
and, if we choose to make it so, I
transient.
It is in the perspective of the)
American program that the Brit
ish problem and the British]
economy differs not only in size j
but in kind from the American.!
The sharpest proof of this is that j
Pr esident Johnson has been able j
to defend the dollar without de I
fating, v. ithoul reducing the pub-j
lie's buying power. Indeed, while
he has been defending the dollar.!
American business has been boom- 1
ing and unemployment has fallen. !
The Wilson government has had j
no such attractive possibility; it !
could not eat its cake and have
it. too, thus defying the financial j
orthodoxy of the 19th century, j
The chancellor of the exchequer j
has had to bring in a budget I

which will appease the bankers
and the speculators and the fi
nance ministries on the continent.
To defend the pound sterling in
the face of their opinion, he tuts
to bear down on the British pub
lic and to risk a slow-down in the
sorely needed modernization and
expansion of British industry.
Defending the Dollar
On the early returns, the fi
nancial augurs seem favorable.
The British budget appears to be
tough enough to ward off specu
lation against the pound and to
| make it likely that, the British
I government will be able to sup
port the pound at its present rate,
