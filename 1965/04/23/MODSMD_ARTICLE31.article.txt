# Chaos Reigns In Congo
## 
### URIAH CHINWAH 
(Fourth in a Series)
Chaos reigned supreme in t lie
Congo. For some time, the forces
of disorder were in the ascendant.
Brave Lumumba, in spite of U.N.
presence, found himself in the
hands of his enemies. He was
speedily, efficiently, and merci
lessly disposed of. The Congo
and Africa was too shocked to
to know how to react. The schem
ers took the opportunity to con
solidate their gains.
Too Late
Evenutally the U.N. woke up
to certain realities of the situa
tion. Too late, the United States
learned that readiness to accept
communist help in tin 1 cause of
African nationalism when every
other recourse seemed tied up in
comitant with "communism." Too
late the great powers realised that
Africa would fight off commun
ist domination just as readily as
she would fight off Western im
perialism.
The U.N', thus took up the
Tshombe gauntlet in earnest,
with Lumumba's government then
headed by an erstwhile close as
soeiate, Cyrille Adoulla. The pow
crs behind Tshombe, however,
were not to be pressed too hard.
Sincere and conscientious U.N.
men like Conor Cruise O'Brien
were too zealous, they felt;
O'Brien was quickly recalled
from the scene.
Thanks to the United States,
the clear light of dawn now shone
on the unveiled desperation of the
schemers and made clear to what
lengths they would go to gain
their ends. The U.S. and the U.N.,
however, now seemed to be aware
of their responsibility lo the world
at large, and a short military
c a m p a i g n readily brought
Tshombe's puppet regime to an
end, but not before the Secretary-
General, Dag Hammarskjold had
lost his life in the final stages of
the struggle.
Katanga Episode
Let us pause briefly to survey
a crass version of the Katanga
espisode related by a Belgian his
torian. This might throw some
light on the involved nature of the
arguments which lead people to
see the truth upside down, the
way in which it is most con
venient for them.
. . . the savagery of the U.N.
attack, in which (lurklia troops
provided by India played «

leading part, shocked Western
opinion. Notwithstanding the
legalistic arguments — in any
case exremely dubious —which
were advanced to justify it, the
spectacle of an international
police, which was supposed to
he in the Congo to keep order, so
far departing from neutrality
as to take sides in an internal
conflict in defiance of its own
mandate, and to use force to im
pose a political solution, thereby
importing war into the only
peaceful part of the Congo, pro
duced a widespread feeling of
disgust and disillusionment . . .
There is no point arguing against
such a writer so imbued with his
own wisdom and dedication to the
"truth" as to consider the whole
of Africa stpuid and ignorant, and
Tshombe tlie only holy man in it.
The interpretation of the man
dale was to be left entirely in the
hands of the U.N. Secretary-Gen
oral. This was the occasion on
which the U.N. passed a more or
less resounding vote of confidence
in the Secretary-General on the
question as to whether or not
there were neutral men. It was
clear that the U.N., backed by the
U.S., was no longer going to allow
private interference from fellow
members and thereby place the
whole reputation of the U.N', at
stake.
Cauldron Boils Over
The cauldron had boiled over,
and peace was being restored in
the Congo once more. Mot all prob
lems have been solved as yet, bu:
a good start lias been made.
Tshombe, considered by the rest
of Africa as a traitor to the cause
of African nationalism, is still far
from inactive. Today, by clever
maneuvering, he is head of
President Kasavubu's central gov
ernment. His presence in the cen
tral government has immediately
called into l>eing a spring-head of
opposition to his regime. To all
true nationalists lie simply can
not be trusted to pursue the true
cause of African Nationalism.
Mis relations with President Kasa
vubu also cast some heavy doubts
on the aspirations and ideals of
the latter. Kasavubu had not got
ten on too well with the martyred
Lumumba either. To all Africa,
if Lumumba was not a true na
tionalist even if he was an over
ly bold one llien no African ever
was.
