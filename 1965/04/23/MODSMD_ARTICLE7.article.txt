"The petition was discussed at
length by its sponsors and all rep-|
resentatives. In accordance with,
the By-Laws, the Legislature will
submit Ihe petition, in its original|
form, to .the student body within!
25 days. The representatives asked j
that, in the interim, the Commit-!
tee of 15 and the By-Laws Com !
mitjtee examine additional pro
posals limiting student expression
to issues of universal concern and
on which all students were con
sulted and presented with abund
ant authenticated information."

names was 'irrational" to LASSU j
members supposedly responsive toj
the student body. The student
body should be allowed the real
choice offered by the proposed by
law.
By a margin of 615-11, a bill was;
passed to established three new!
polling places—at the? School of|
Education, the School of Law, andl
the northeast corner of Stern:
elections.
A bill criticizing Stickney's hir-1
ing practices was amended toj

The purpose of the letter was to
remove any stigma placed on the!
Stickney chain by last week's Leg
islature action. Due 1o lack of a
