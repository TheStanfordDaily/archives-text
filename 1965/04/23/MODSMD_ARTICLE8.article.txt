# More Taxes, Says Sanford
## 
### JOHN STERLING 
"I say to people: 'Be proud to
state taxes! Insist on paying
them!" declared former Governor
Terry Sanford of North Carolina,
here yesterday. "That's the only
way to keep the Federal govern
ment. from gobbling them up."
Sanford, current guest-in-resi
dencc of Wilbur Hall, met twice
during the day in seminars with
men at Wilbur and answered
questions on their views of the role
of state governments, their prob
lems, and their relations with the
federal government.
He is also concerned with ex
amining the present weaknesses
of state governments and wit h
discovering ways that they can
be strengthened.
The problem with many state
governments, he explained, is
that the governor is hampered
by a system which does not con
centrate executive authority in
the hands of the governor.
"1 think you have a better state
structure," he said, "with the au
thority centered in the office of
the governor, who has been
elected by all of the people of tlie
state and can better represent
them all."
