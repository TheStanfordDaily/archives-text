# OREGON WINS, 83-62
## Duck Trackmen Outrun Cards 
### 
The Oregon Ducks swept two
field events and all hut shut out
Stanford in the distance races,
posting an 83-62 upset track vic
tory over the Tribe at Eugene,
Oregon, Saturday.
Five Stanford trackmen came
through with best-of-life efforts,
but the Ducks were primed for the
meet- Oregon had 16 best of sea
son or best-01-iil'o performances.
Wade Bell, Oregon 880 and mile
runner, won both his specialties
in 1:51.9 and 4:06.3, respectively.
Stanford's Dave Deubner snuck
in for second in the 880 in 1:52.9,
while Paul Schlicke, favored in the

mile, finished third in 4:08.1.
Qucstud Wins Twice
Stanford sprinter Larry Quesad
had his usual brilliant afternoon,
winning the 100-yard dash in 9.5
seconds and the 220 in 21 seconds
| flat. He also anchored the winning
440 relay team. Eric Frische ran
9.7 in the hundred, his best of the
' year, for second.
Other top performers for Stan
ford included Bob Stoecker, who
(flipped the discus 181'8", a per
sonal best and also the second
, best in Stanford history, behind
Dave Weill's 193-2 in 1963. Bud
| Walsh also won, broad jumping
i 24-2 1 this best* for first place,
and finishing second in the inter
, mediate hurdles behind Greg Ford.
Ford blazed through the high
hurdles in 14.4 seconds, his best
! by a full two-tenths of a second,
but had to settle for second place
; behind Oregon's Paul Eliott,
j who ran 14.2.
Sophomore Jim Eshelman won
the pole vault at 15-7, his best
ever. Teammate Dick Barkley
vaulted 14 9 for third.
Ducks Sweep Jumps
One-third of the way through
1 the meet, Oregon clung to a pre
carious 30-29 lead. But then the
Ducks swept the high jump and
triple jump and won the 880 to
! take a commanding 63-41 advant
j age.
The Indians rallied behind
Questad, Ford and Eshelman to
close the gap to 70-63 with only
the two-mile and mile relay re
maining. Stanford's Weym Kirk
land was edged by Oregon's Ken
Moore and Bruce Mortenson in
the two-mile, killing any Indian
comeback hopes. Moore ran
9:00.3, Mortenson 9:02.6, and Kirk

land 9:03.0.
It was the seventh straight
track victory for Oregon over
Stanford. The Ducks had won by
only 74-71 in the previous two
years.
The loss dropped Stanford's dual
meet record to 3-2, with only next
Saturday's Big Meet left before
the invitational meets begin. Stan
ford is highly favored to beat
Cal, having won for the past three
years.
