### J. H P. K 
Stanford increased its narrow
yead in the CIBA baseball race
from 11 percentage points to a
close half-game even though los
ing to Southern California, 5-4,
Friday.
Two exciting wins over UCLA
in Saturday's doubleheader, 1-0
and 8-7, placed the Indians in first,
although part of the credit for
Stanford's lead in the battle for
league supremacy must go to
Santa Clara.
Friday the Broncos knocked off
UCLA and Saturday they split a
doubleheader with USC.
Tribe l/*u<ls US<
The Tribe scored a single run
in each of the first three innings
against USC to lead, 3-0. Stanford
got its first run when Jim Hibbs
hit a long single to left, advanced
to second on a wild pitch, and
scored on a sharp single to left
by Peter Middlekauff.
Second baseman George Thach
er led off the next inning by
reaching second on a double error.
A single by catcher Bill Boles
scored him.
Hibbs started off the third in
ning with a long double which
hit the bank surrounding Sunken
Diamond, lie moved to third on
a ground out and scored when
Trojan catcher Marty Piseovieh

| threw Ihe hall away on an at
tempted pick-off play.
Starting pitcher Daro Quiring
had his troubles the next two j
innings. The Trojans brought two
runs across in both the fifth and j
sixth, throe of them unearned, to I
take a 4-S lead.
Stanford *Jlows Chance
Stanford missed a golden op-'
port unit} to open the game up j
when they loaded the bases with
no outs in the bottom of the!
seventh. Boles singled to left, andj
both Quiring and rightfielder Ron i
Yett beat out bunts.
But Bob Pox hit into a double!
play in which the runner was cm
down at the plate. Hibbs then;
was walked intentionally and Mid-;
dlekauft walked to force in a run
and tie the game. 4-4.
In the 4 top of the eighth Trojan;
; outfielder Bob Johnson tripled and
; scored when shortstop Dick Swan
threw the ball away on a relay
| from the outfield. That was all
that USC needed as the Indians
went down 1. 2, 3 in the eighth
and ninth.
UCLA Games Nail-Biters
The last innings in both UCLA j
games were real nail-biters. A
brilliant pitcher's battle between
Stanford's .John Mason and
UCLA's Jim Arens lasted eight
scoreless innings. Arens was get -;
ting the better of it, having al-j
lowed only a single in the first j
inning and having retired 12 of •
13 Stanford hitters at one point, j
His tricky curve ball completely
baffled most Indian batsmen.
Indian first baseman Pete Mid- i
dlekauf opened the ninth with
a lowering blast down the right j
field line, barely foul. Rightfielder j
Jim Colletto, the object of buck-j
ets-full of abuse from the Stan- j
ford bench throughout the game, j
caught the ball on his back.
Then Steve Hovley drew a walk,
but the pitched ball sailed over
the catcher's head, and Hovley
raced to second. After an inten
tional walk, calcher Bill Boles
earned I lie game's hero honors j
with a sharp single to right that i
i scored Hovley, and Stanford won. j
1-0. The grateful Mason boosted J
his record to 5-1. scattering five j
hits.
Hitters Return to Form
The 10 score was in marked)
contrast to the two earlier UCLA-
Stanford games, which the In-;
dians won, 12-7 and 15-0. However,
in the seven-inning nightcap, the i
hiiters returned to form.
The Cards took a 2-1 lead in the
third inning when pitcher Terry
Doeken uncorked a long triple
and scored on Bob Cox's triple, i
Cox later scored when Middle- •
kauff drew a throw to second j
base on a successful sleal attempt.'
The Bruins bounded back to!
lead. 4-2 going into the bottom of j
the seventh. Lon Raymond, pinch- :
hitting for Docken. singled, but j
then Ron Yett struck out and Cox ;
popped up. After Jim Hibbs drew
a walk. Middlekauff played the 1
role of Casey at the bat, lining a ;
double to right field to score two
runs.
That sent it into extra innings. '
Two triples and a throwing errorl
by Hibbs gave the Bruins a 7-4
lead, and things looked rather)
| dismal for ihe Indians.
However, Boles and George!
Thaeher singled to open the in-:
j ning after Swan had struck out. j
i Marty Erek belled a pinch-hit ;
| triple to right field, scoring twoi
j runs. Yett grounded out, and Boh;
