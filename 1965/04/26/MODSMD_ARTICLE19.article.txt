# What Price Apathy?

### 
ASSU Presidential candidate Roger Magtiu
son, running on a platform of "healthy ambiva
latice," has asserted, "If everyone voted, 1 would
come out far ahead."
Well, everyone won t vote.
Hut if the)* did, we sadly suspect that Magnu
son might ye! become a prophet in his own time.
Not that Magnuson represents any ideology
particular!) congenial to the current temper of
Stanford students.
The point is that he represents—or pretends
to represent—no ideology at all.
Magnuson s appeal to "ambivalance is the
logical—if somewhat more musing—concomitant
to the proposed initiative which would prohibit
LASSU from speaking on so-called "off-campus
issues.
The initiative is the work (not of the apathetic,
who would have lacked the energy to conceive
of it) but rather, of a group of politically com
mitted people who have been repeated!) frus
trated by a student legislature which lias not
always seen things their way.
As such, the initiative is a fraud.
Its ostensible assumption—that the best way to

insure against the possibility of "unrepresenta-J
tive" student government is to destroy the possi-j
bility of meaniful representation—is equivalent
to saying that the best way to arrest a disease;
is to kill the patient.
In fact, "unrepresenative government is al-j
ways the price of apathy in a democratic society,;
And, in fact, the only useful andidote to un-j
representative government is a large application;
of participation by those who feel they are not
being represented. ,
Every Stanford student has—and always has
had—a direct and powerful control over the
actions of all branches of the ASSU: through his
vote, through his living group representative, and,
failing that, through recall. Moreover, every
student has a stake in exercising his civic pre
rogatives—a stake which becomes more direct and
more personal as the ASSU expands its sphere J
of actual control.
It has always been the wistful folly of human
beings to believe that they can somehow retire
from the community in which they live—abdicate
their civ ic responsibilities—and still be free of the
direct consequences of their abdication.
In fact, thev cannot.

who would have lacked the energy to conceive
of it) but rather, of a group of politically com
mitted people who have been repeated!) frus
trated by a student legislature which lias not
always seen things their way.
As such, the initiative is a fraud.
Its ostensible assumption—that the best way to

insure against the possibility of "unrepresenta-J
tive" student government is to destroy the possi-j
bility of meaniful representation—is equivalent
to saying that the best way to arrest a disease;
is to kill the patient.
In fact, "unrepresenative government is al-j
ways the price of apathy in a democratic society,;
And, in fact, the only useful andidote to un-j
representative government is a large application;
of participation by those who feel they are not
being represented. ,
Every Stanford student has—and always has
had—a direct and powerful control over the
actions of all branches of the ASSU: through his
vote, through his living group representative, and,
failing that, through recall. Moreover, every
student has a stake in exercising his civic pre
rogatives—a stake which becomes more direct and
more personal as the ASSU expands its sphere J
of actual control.
It has always been the wistful folly of human
beings to believe that they can somehow retire
from the community in which they live—abdicate
their civ ic responsibilities—and still be free of the
direct consequences of their abdication.
In fact, thev cannot.
