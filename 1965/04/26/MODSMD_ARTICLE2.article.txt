## 
### FRED KOCH 
Con Home Week opened
with a splash yesterday at
Lake Lagunita when "the
best ever" annua! Hydrofol
lies show opened. Superla
tives fell short of describing
the spectacle which featured
daring stunts, thrills and
spills, and constant comedy.
The numerous spectators
who turned out for the affair
were able to save their Man-
Tan for another day as t ii e
perfect weather enabled them
to shed their sweaters and
don their bikinis. Those who
weren't straining their eye
halls looking at the dailies
were able to enjoy the breath
taking show headed by Co
lombian National Men's
Champion Andres Botero.
Botero. and the numerous
Stanford students who made
the show the success that it
was, proved to be crowd
pleasers. The Colombian left
everyone in awe when he took
to the air by hanging onto a
kite being pulled by a speed
boat. As he flew around the
lake several times, the Latin
daredevil performed t 11 r 11 s
and other tricks as well as
swooping down low over the
crowd.
Besides the aerobatics, Bo
tero was .joined by Aubin
Barthold, a freshman product
from Wilbur, and the pair
demonstrated their ability to
woo the spectators with their
barefoot skiing. Besides these
two, others joined in staging
a water ballet and, to put the
frosting on the cake, the
show was ended with a five
skier pyramid act.
When the crowd wasn't
staring in amazement, they
were enjoying the bellylaughs
provided by the various liv
ing groups. Biirhank II o us e

of Stern placed first in the
Kohin Hood-Little John canoe
joust and second in the canoe
race. These victories proved
sufficient to win the First An
nual King Neptune Memorial
Award and, popularly if no t
appropriately enough, a keg
of l>eer.
Throwing open a challenge
to the world, Phi Kappa Sig
ma made a valiant effort to
defend tlie i r "Aqua-Zoo"
against any and all comers.
Responding to the flaunt,
eager denizens of the deep
swarmed over the craft and,
t ) the delight of everyone,
sank the animals.
