# The 						Task of Rebuilding Africa
## 
### URIAH CHINWAR (Last in a series 
So strong a dislike has the rest
of Africa taken to the Kasavubu-
Tshome combine they could feel
insidious and subtle hands at evil
work again that one Somalia
high official blurted out in true
African frankness, "Let us Mhe
O.A.U) give recognition to the
rebel government as the true gov
ernment of the Congo."
B<Mi Bella
Also, in January 19<>1, Premier
Hen Bella of Algeria spoke with
the voice of Africa, when, in oh
iecting to Tshombe's histrionic ef
forts to join in the discussions;
held in Egypt on the Congo situa
tion by African foreign ministers,
he referred to Tshombe in rather|
contemptuous terms as . . that :
traveling museum of imperial
ism."
Only Nigeria, acting strictly on
a question of principles and the
legality of the situation, has so
far refrained from condemning
the Kasavubu-Tshombe combine,j
and looks forward to a happy andj
meaningful solution of the Congoi
problem with a minimum of out-j
side interference European,!
American, African, or otherwise.
Cuban Example
This is not to say that the rest]
of Africa does not look forward 1
to a similarly happy solution. The
disagreement here is solely one
of methods. The rest of Africa
feels that with unlikely characters
of the Tshombe typo ruthlessly;
hoodwinking their innocent and;
politically ignorant brothers, par
ticipation in the Congo (by Af
rica) to bring about a meaningful
solution to these problems be
comes a sacred duly.
Finally, the United States al
most fell into the usual tray of
lapping up wild stories spread!

i around by dubious sources: thc
rebels of Stanleyville, opposed to
the Kasavubu-Tshombe combine,
are none other than communists.
That the Africans involved have
noi bothered much about repudiat
ing this accusation should have
shown anybody thai this is not
; their basic problem. They would
| even allow the world at large to
call them communists.
\'> Ideologies
r n Africa the battle has never
been one of ideologies, commun
ism or capitalism, it has father!
been a simple question of the
African protesting against alii
forms of injustice and abuse heap-!
en oil him. "Let me alone,'' he pro
tests. "If you cannot help me im-j
prove my lot, do not hinder me in
my attempt to do so myself."
This is, in very simple terms, what
the "rebels" of Stanleyville are to
day trying to tell their "brothers"!
of the Kasavubu-Tshombe com -j
bine.
"We are tired of being Im
perialist stooges," they cry.
"Tshombe is a traitor and has
proven himself time and time
again to be such a stooge. If your;
goals are other than purely na-j
tionalistic which they seem to!
be if your interests lie in ce
menting ties with Imperialists,
ties that make a mockery of us
and of our independence, then we
can never really be brothers.
We Shall Fight
"We shall fight the battle to
the bitter end. We shall receive
help from all men of good will and
far-reaching discernment to light
our cause. With faith as steadfast
as that of Lumumba, even in the
face of death, we shall hold on to
the cause of justice convinced that
such a cause, in the final reckon
ing, can never fail."
Happily, the O.A.U. is begin-'

ning to make the U.S. realize that
they are in error if thov believe!
that the Stanleyville rebels are
communists. The "communist"
or the nationalist, to give him his
true name may turn out in the
long run to be the true friend of
the United States. We should not!
be so anxious as to drive our
friends into the hands of our
enemies. We should not forget the
ever present example of Cuba.
There is very little more to tell.
The Congolese and all Africans;
alike have always shown great
hospitality and warmth towards 1
all those who considered them fel
low human beings and who were
genuinely interested in their wel
fare.
African Youth
One such man was the Gov-!
ernor-General of the Congo in
1949. whose very liberal and far-!
sighted speech in those early days;
of unprogressive colonial policies
remains fresh in the minds of!
many Congolese today:
It is not possible to conceive of
a country in which there is no|
social hierachy. But when the
present evolution reaches its full]
development, this hierachy must 1
be based solely < n differences!
of competence, efficiency and
education.
The youths of the Congo, like!
many other African youths, arei
studying at home and abroad. To
them is left the task of rebuilding
Africa and of keeping it in one
piece. For them it is not a question
of ideologies, nor it is a question
of feathering their nests as pup
pets. For them it is a question of
keeping man free and dignified;!
fi ee from external political im-;
positions, free from fears and;
threatenings, and free from dis
eases and want. Their's is a hard
task, but they are and cannot
help but be staunchly unafraid.
