## What Is the Function Of Student Legislature? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The initiative statement will
read:
"The govenunent of the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University shall not take posi
tions on matters other than i
those pertaining: to student af
fairs on the Stanford campus." j
The acute question is, "What
exactly is the function of LASSU?" j
LASSU is now functioning mean
ingfully on issues such as wom
en's social regulations and the'
liquor policy on campus. There j
are those who would have it speak '
for the entire student body on an I
almost unlimited scope.
Their argument is that the stu-j
dent has a responsibility to so
ciety. 1 agree. Support and lead
ership for non-academic issues j
must come from the university j
community, yet is must not come;
in a monotone.
The best ideas must come forth
on all sides of an issue. This hasj
been done through a wide variety:
of socially active voluntary or j
ganizations (IT now exist on cam
pus). The university cannot pro
\ ide the best leadership for our na-j
tion by keeping all ideas from be
ing heard equally.
To throw the weight of the "stu- j
dent body" behind anything from J
withdrawl from from Vietnam to
the impeachment of Earl Warren j
would be disastrous to the many;
sound, well articulated views be-i
ing expressed by voluntary orga
nizations now (one person sup
porting an open mandate for
LASSU suggested that LASSU
should financially support political
candidates).
Issues must gain your support
on their own merits and not be-;
cause LASSU "speaks for you."
In reference to this particular
approach to the problem, "Why
draw the line on LASSU action
where the statement does?" This
is ilio compromise resulting from!
two weeks work, accepted in
preference to giving up in face|
of difficulty. There has been a
long record of flexible interpret a
tions of similar documents. Some!
firmness must be proscribed or!
the statement will have no mean
ing.
Yet tills proposal does not pro

In this respect, Rob Sangster's
proposal does not conflict with
this one at all.
Why Ihe negative" approach?
Any by-law pertaining to the is
sue must be so worde'l it LASSU
is to have guidelines. To assert
only what LASSU can do is to
leave open the question of what
limitation the student body may'
wish to impose on it.
Is this a partisan attempt to]
negate ihe value of Legislature?;
We emphasised that this puts the;
question forward, does not decide;
it. One might view with suspicion;
any group not seeing LASSU asj
responsible to the student body.!
The very persons who want to j
plunge LASSU into off-campus is-j
sues are the ones who have most j
resisted allowing the students to:
decide for themselves by the initia- j
live process.
Discussion pertinent to the is
sue is encouraged.

Editor. Tile Daily:
Dan Schwartz's attack on John
Bonine in Friday's Daily was as
irresponsible as he alleged Mr,
Bonine's column to be.
Mr. Schwartz denies that his |
ASSU candidate, Sandy Macken
zie, said al Tuesday night's public j
meeting thai he had been "travel
ling around with FSM."

Well Mr. Schwartz is correct.
What Mr. Mackenzie really said
was that he had been "travelling
around for FSM." If he meant, as
Mr. Schwartz alleges, that he was
investigating FSM for the Na
tional Student Association, he
should have been more explicit.
In addition, Mr. Mackenzie did
not deny the statement by Jon
Roise of The Daily that his views
were closer to the GCC's than
were Fd Shaw's. His silence on
this statement probably contrib-l
uteri to the confusion.

Editor, The Daily:
If Stanford students arc suc
cessfully to govern their own af
fairs, it is crucial that graduate
students as well as undergrad
uates fulfill their obligation to
participate in the processes of stu
dent government.
As William Trombley of the
Los Angeles Times noted, "The
graduate student has emerged as
a campus political force at Stan
ford University." Graduate stu
dent involvement has already been
of benefit to the University com
munity. Graduates have been in
strumental in social and .judicial
reforms by the Legislature, in the
increase in campus publications,
and in recent rallies, which demon
strate greater campus awareness
of national and international is
sues.
Continued progress demands
continued participation. We there
fore urge that graduate students
inform themselves about the is
sues and candidates in the cur
rent presidential primary and vote
on Monday or Tuesday of next
week.

• Not So Dull
Editor, Th«* Daily:
If I had been asked a year ago.
1 would have said that Stanford
was a pretty dull place. I would
have gone on to draw unfavorable
comparisons between Stanford
and the university I attended in
Australia. Since then things have
begun to jump, an I I'm coming
around 1o seeing the University
as a community of interesting
people.
It may be the the University
is no friskier than it was, but
merely that I'm learning some of
r he tricks of involvement in the
American way. Traditionally, it
seems there? is a big gap between
the graduate and the undergrad
uate worlds. But there is an even
bigger gap between the foreign
student and the rest of the cam
pus.
But talking to the local inhab
itants can be sort of enjoyable I've
found, and so I've been trying to
jump this gap. For instance I dis
covered the other day tirat foreign
students are even welcome to vote
in elections, such as the up
coming one for ASSU President
. . . amazing hospitality!!!
I think it would be a good
thing if other foreign students
who like the growing liberality
and flexibility of this place, were
also to vote next week. If nothing
else, it may make you feel that
you are part of the feud. So try
democracy, it's reputed to be fun.

• Not So Dull
Editor, Th«* Daily:
If I had been asked a year ago.
1 would have said that Stanford
was a pretty dull place. I would
have gone on to draw unfavorable
comparisons between Stanford
and the university I attended in
Australia. Since then things have
begun to jump, an I I'm coming
around 1o seeing the University
as a community of interesting
people.
It may be the the University
is no friskier than it was, but
merely that I'm learning some of
r he tricks of involvement in the
American way. Traditionally, it
seems there? is a big gap between
the graduate and the undergrad
uate worlds. But there is an even
bigger gap between the foreign
student and the rest of the cam
pus.
But talking to the local inhab
itants can be sort of enjoyable I've
found, and so I've been trying to
jump this gap. For instance I dis
covered the other day tirat foreign
students are even welcome to vote
in elections, such as the up
coming one for ASSU President
. . . amazing hospitality!!!
I think it would be a good
thing if other foreign students
who like the growing liberality
and flexibility of this place, were
also to vote next week. If nothing
else, it may make you feel that
you are part of the feud. So try
democracy, it's reputed to be fun.

"The govenunent of the As

University shall not take posi
tions on matters other than i
those pertaining: to student af
fairs on the Stanford campus." j
The acute question is, "What
exactly is the function of LASSU?" j
LASSU is now functioning mean

liquor policy on campus. There j
are those who would have it speak '

almost unlimited scope.
Their argument is that the stu-j

must come from the university j
community, yet is must not come;
in a monotone.
The best ideas must come forth
on all sides of an issue. This hasj
been done through a wide variety:
of socially active voluntary or j
ganizations (IT now exist on cam
pus). The university cannot pro
\ ide the best leadership for our na-j
tion by keeping all ideas from be

To throw the weight of the "stu- j

would be disastrous to the many;
sound, well articulated views be-i

Dan Schwartz's attack on John
Bonine in Friday's Daily was as
irresponsible as he alleged Mr,
Bonine's column to be.
Mr. Schwartz denies that his |
ASSU candidate, Sandy Macken
zie, said al Tuesday night's public j
meeting thai he had been "travel
ling around with FSM."

Well Mr. Schwartz is correct.
What Mr. Mackenzie really said
was that he had been "travelling
around for FSM." If he meant, as
Mr. Schwartz alleges, that he was
investigating FSM for the Na
tional Student Association, he
should have been more explicit.
In addition, Mr. Mackenzie did
not deny the statement by Jon
Roise of The Daily that his views
were closer to the GCC's than
were Fd Shaw's. His silence on
this statement probably contrib-l
uteri to the confusion.

Editor, The Daily:
If Stanford students arc suc
cessfully to govern their own af
fairs, it is crucial that graduate
students as well as undergrad
uates fulfill their obligation to
participate in the processes of stu
dent government.
As William Trombley of the
Los Angeles Times noted, "The
graduate student has emerged as
a campus political force at Stan
ford University." Graduate stu
dent involvement has already been
of benefit to the University com
munity. Graduates have been in
strumental in social and .judicial
reforms by the Legislature, in the
increase in campus publications,
and in recent rallies, which demon
strate greater campus awareness
of national and international is
sues.
Continued progress demands
continued participation. We there
fore urge that graduate students
inform themselves about the is
sues and candidates in the cur
rent presidential primary and vote
on Monday or Tuesday of next

If Stanford students arc suc
cessfully to govern their own af
fairs, it is crucial that graduate
students as well as undergrad
uates fulfill their obligation to
participate in the processes of stu
dent government.
As William Trombley of the
Los Angeles Times noted, "The
graduate student has emerged as
a campus political force at Stan
ford University." Graduate stu
dent involvement has already been
of benefit to the University com
munity. Graduates have been in
strumental in social and .judicial
reforms by the Legislature, in the
increase in campus publications,
and in recent rallies, which demon
strate greater campus awareness
of national and international is
sues.
Continued progress demands
continued participation. We there
fore urge that graduate students
inform themselves about the is
sues and candidates in the cur
rent presidential primary and vote
on Monday or Tuesday of next

• Not So Dull
Editor, Th«* Daily:
If I had been asked a year ago.
1 would have said that Stanford
was a pretty dull place. I would
have gone on to draw unfavorable
comparisons between Stanford
and the university I attended in
Australia. Since then things have
begun to jump, an I I'm coming
around 1o seeing the University
as a community of interesting
people.
It may be the the University
is no friskier than it was, but
merely that I'm learning some of
r he tricks of involvement in the
American way. Traditionally, it
seems there? is a big gap between
the graduate and the undergrad
uate worlds. But there is an even
bigger gap between the foreign
student and the rest of the cam
pus.
But talking to the local inhab
itants can be sort of enjoyable I've
found, and so I've been trying to
jump this gap. For instance I dis
covered the other day tirat foreign
students are even welcome to vote
in elections, such as the up
coming one for ASSU President
. . . amazing hospitality!!!
I think it would be a good
thing if other foreign students
who like the growing liberality
and flexibility of this place, were
also to vote next week. If nothing
else, it may make you feel that
you are part of the feud. So try
democracy, it's reputed to be fun.

In this respect, Rob Sangster's
proposal does not conflict with
this one at all.
Why Ihe negative" approach?
Any by-law pertaining to the is
sue must be so worde'l it LASSU
is to have guidelines. To assert
only what LASSU can do is to
leave open the question of what
limitation the student body may'
wish to impose on it.
Is this a partisan attempt to]
negate ihe value of Legislature?;
We emphasised that this puts the;
question forward, does not decide;
it. One might view with suspicion;
any group not seeing LASSU asj
responsible to the student body.!
The very persons who want to j
plunge LASSU into off-campus is-j
sues are the ones who have most j
resisted allowing the students to:
decide for themselves by the initia- j
live process.
Discussion pertinent to the is
sue is encouraged.

• Hotline Rebuttal
Editor. Tile Daily:
Dan Schwartz's attack on John
Bonine in Friday's Daily was as
irresponsible as he alleged Mr,
Bonine's column to be.
Mr. Schwartz denies that his |
ASSU candidate, Sandy Macken
zie, said al Tuesday night's public j
meeting thai he had been "travel
ling around with FSM."

Well Mr. Schwartz is correct.
What Mr. Mackenzie really said
was that he had been "travelling
around for FSM." If he meant, as
Mr. Schwartz alleges, that he was
investigating FSM for the Na
tional Student Association, he
should have been more explicit.
In addition, Mr. Mackenzie did
not deny the statement by Jon
Roise of The Daily that his views
were closer to the GCC's than
were Fd Shaw's. His silence on
this statement probably contrib-l
uteri to the confusion.

• A Political Force
Editor, The Daily:
If Stanford students arc suc
cessfully to govern their own af
fairs, it is crucial that graduate
students as well as undergrad
uates fulfill their obligation to
participate in the processes of stu
dent government.
As William Trombley of the
Los Angeles Times noted, "The
graduate student has emerged as
a campus political force at Stan
ford University." Graduate stu
dent involvement has already been
of benefit to the University com
munity. Graduates have been in
strumental in social and .judicial
reforms by the Legislature, in the
increase in campus publications,
and in recent rallies, which demon
strate greater campus awareness
of national and international is
sues.
Continued progress demands
continued participation. We there
fore urge that graduate students
inform themselves about the is
sues and candidates in the cur
rent presidential primary and vote
on Monday or Tuesday of next
week.

• Not So Dull
Editor, Th«* Daily:
If I had been asked a year ago.
1 would have said that Stanford
was a pretty dull place. I would
have gone on to draw unfavorable
comparisons between Stanford
and the university I attended in
Australia. Since then things have
begun to jump, an I I'm coming
around 1o seeing the University
as a community of interesting
people.
It may be the the University
is no friskier than it was, but
merely that I'm learning some of
r he tricks of involvement in the
American way. Traditionally, it
seems there? is a big gap between
the graduate and the undergrad
uate worlds. But there is an even
bigger gap between the foreign
student and the rest of the cam
pus.
But talking to the local inhab
itants can be sort of enjoyable I've
found, and so I've been trying to
jump this gap. For instance I dis
covered the other day tirat foreign
students are even welcome to vote
in elections, such as the up
coming one for ASSU President
. . . amazing hospitality!!!
I think it would be a good
thing if other foreign students
who like the growing liberality
and flexibility of this place, were
also to vote next week. If nothing
else, it may make you feel that
you are part of the feud. So try
democracy, it's reputed to be fun.
