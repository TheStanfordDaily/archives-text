PRINCESS AMI) PEA
Familiar Fairy Tale
Makes Happy Musical
In olden days there was an unwed prince whose mother was in
deed particular about who would eventually hook him. This mother
was a slightly bitchy — really, downright nasty — old dame. This
was the original "in loco parentis!" in fact.
Applicant after applicant sought the hand of the charming,
albeit slightly wimpy, prince. Each time, dear mother would cook
up a wicked test of the eligible darnel s "blue-bloodedness." In this
A or l' situation there was no curve, and everybody flunked,
thanks to sneaky old mumsy.
As a historical footnote we should add that there was an edict
loose in the land (another of mom's doings) to the effect that no
one in the kingdom would marry until Prince Dauntless (now
there's a name!) was paired.
Needless to say, such an edict caused just a little consternation
among the locals — and particularly among such as Lady Larkin
who by this time is about to become a "maternal bride-to-be."
Up from her swampy homeland conies Princess Winnifred the
Woebegone (talk about names!) ("Fred" for short) to seek her
chances amidst old Queenies equal opportunity employment inter
view.
All of a sudden, whammmmnimo! Dauntless and Fred hit it off
like Fd Sli aw and the G.C.C., so to speak. \\ ell, sir, things are look
ing good until it comes time for test, which is to be a
lulu of the first water.
Under 20 mattresses there will be one pea. If Miss Fred sleeps
well, obviously she's a phony — or perhaps even a fink. If she tosses
and turns (like on the absurd television commercials), then her
"sensitivity" level is good enough for Dauntless.
Well, to end the suspense, she tosses and turns, all hell breaks
loose in the kingdom, Fred and Dauntless marry, and Queenie gets
hers!
To the old fair)' tale of "The Princess and the Pea," composer
Mary Rodgcrs (her father is the famous Richard) has added a light
hearted musical score liberally laced with hunnnable, happy melo
dies.
Lyrics by Marshall Barer are as witty as the trumped-up version
of the old kids story re-written for the musical stage by Barer, Jay
Thompson and Dean Fuller.
Ram's Head's production of the funny musical during the next
two weekends brings to the campus a handsomely designed and
costumed show featuring a highly talented cast and orchestra.
Liz Kuhn, whose Ram's Head career spans her four years at
Stanford, appears as the last and luckiest in a long line of eligible
(or not-so-eligible) princesses. Freshman Alan Mokler, off his lead
ing roles in the 1964 Gaieties and this winter's One-Acts, plays
Dauntless, the Prince.
The domineering but funny Queen Mother Aggravain is played
by Ruth Hunt, the Adelaide of last spring's "Guys and Dolls," and
featured member of the 1 Stanford Players' company. King Sextimus,
milktoast ruler of the kingdom, is played by David Shookhoff.
Lovers Lady Larkin and Sir Harry are played by Pat Deckert
and J. Karr Wolfe, respectively. The story-telling Minstrel is Jim
Anderson. Peter Sly is the court Jester.
Stanford graduate student in drama, Thomas Bacchetti, is the
show's director; producer is Stanford junior Robert Webster.
Costumes for the lavish medieval production have been de
signed by freshman John Pasqualetti who also designs for the Marin
County Shakespeare Festival. Scenery for "Once Upon A Mattress"
has been created bv T. J. McHose. Assistant Conductor Errol Gay,
of the Stanford Symphony Orchestra, is the production's Musical
Director.
Plan now to see "Once Upon A Mattress" just for fun — it's
all for fun.

Lady Larkin (Pat
Deckert) and Sir Harry

(J. Karr Wolfe) will marry as
soon as the marriage ban is lifted, as
well they must—her condition being delicate.


Prince Dauntless the Drab (Alan AAokler) waits for a wife his
mother will accept, but all is not going smoothly in the king
dom. Mother is anything but cooperative.


TheSpanish
Panic is the
favorite
court
dance.


Minstrel (Jim
Anderson) tells
the story which
happened "Many
Moons Ago.'


Jester (Peter Sly) and Minstrel (Jim Anderson) belong to Came
lot Local No. 6 of the Jesters, Minstrels and Palace Workers'
Union.


This is Princess Winnifred ("Fred" for short) sleep
lessly wandering through the Palace corridors.
Tired after a long, hard day, she wishes that
mattresses were a little more comfortable.


Sir Studley
(Bob S e v r a)

gives the bird to
an unsuccessful can
didate for the Prince's hand.


Shy Dauntless
is slightly
overcome by
lively Fred.
