Wo believe thai the greatness of.
a university is measurer! by the
opportunities which it provides!
for the student to develop as an!
"ndividual Within this framework,
the function of student govern-1
nent becomes that of providing!
he channels for creative activism!
by individuals in areas of student'
concern. To 1 his end, our plat
form stresses:
Executive reorganization: By;
â– stabli.hing a five-man cabinet]
'o meet weekly in an advisory ca-|
>acity to the ASSr president, we
dm to promote
"tonomy within the departments
defined by the cabinet, and ttj im
prove communication between stu-l
dent organizations, the executive.!
and the legislature.
Jitdi c i a 1 reaffirmation: Ry j
granting the power of interpreting
the fundamental standard to the
iudicial councils, we aim to sep-|
arate the legislative and judiciali
functions ol' the government. This
power of interpretation now lies!
with the legislature.
The publication of a book of
precedents of these interpreta
tions would work toward a body;
of Student "law," and would in
sure judicial continuity from year
to year.
Academic improvements: We!
propose the implementation next
year of an alumni mentor pro- j
gram enabling students to confer
with alumni engaged in vocational
practice in the area of their major
field. This would help the student j
in intelligent planning of courses.!
special work, and summer jobs.
We also support investigation of
special programs for academic j
credit, such as seminars and field j
work projects.
Off campus issues: We believe!
that there are so many areas with-;
in the university demanding im-|
mediate attention that .the legis- i
lature most clearly benefits the
student by concentrating on these
areas. Stands on off-campus is- j
sues are best taken by the in- j
dividual student organizations!
most clearly informed about them. l
For a true representation of slu-|
dents on issues demanding the j
expression of collective concern,
we recommend an all-campus vote. 1
