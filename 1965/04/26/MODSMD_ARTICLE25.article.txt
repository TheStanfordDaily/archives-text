Student government, in order to
justify its existence, must be pri
maril.v committed to improving
the nature and content of the in
dividual's total educational ex
perience. As your ASSU Presides
and Vice President, we will worh
to encourage students to beconv
actively concerned with the proc
ess of their own education and \<
create and develop new mean'
by which students may articulate
and act upon their concerns.
Ati area ot student govern men
that has not received enough at
tention is that of academic af
fairs. This is potentially the mos
relevant area of concern for stu
dent government because it is
central to student life at a uni
versity. We propose, through
means similar to those used for
the judicial and social reforms of
this year and with the additional
device of special executive com
missions, to direct the influence
and power of student government
in this area.
In this, as in all areas, we will
not give forceful expression only
to one viewpoint, but will attempt
to involve as many students as
possible along the lines of their
concerns and interests. If our pro
gram is to succeed, the opinions
and talents of people with the
widest possible range of ideas and
experience is necessary.
Student government must not
serve as a regulatory agency or
an arm of administration bureau
cracy. It must he an umbrella or
ganization under which all groups
may find support and encourage
ment. This requires a creative
and knowledgeable executive.
We believe that our ticket fits
these qualifications.
