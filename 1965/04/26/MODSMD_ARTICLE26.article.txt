to change the present liquor reg

Your leaders must work for
you and not for themselves. We
have seen throughout this cam
paign too many promises, but we
can no longer afford ihe luxury of!
one-man student government. We|
must have a strong executive]

work with a strong Legislature, j
The latter must be the policy j
maker.
The emphasis must continue to
be on cooperation and participa
