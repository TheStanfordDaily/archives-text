' The more discerning of the
Stanford cognoscenti have per
haps perceived that the campaigns
of my three opponents differ
somewhat from my own; that they
do, in point of fact, represent an
essentially different attitude to
ward student government.
So ihey do.
They are earnestly committed to
the student government concept;
I am not.
And if they are able to laugh at
some of the enormities present in
student government, they, at least
do not, as their audiences prob
ably will attest; I cannot take it
seriously.
For I cannot detect a change in
the message of student leaders
since junior high school. The
"new" proposals of this year's
candidates sound suspiciously like
those of last year, and the year
before, and all sound like the
product of a fruitful night at the
'O.*
My attitude is one of genial
ambivalence toward the whole
student government concept, an
attitude which leaves no room for
serious commitment, a serious
non-seriousness which recognizes
two functions of ASSU:
• ASSU performs some useful
administrative tasks which, al
though somewhat tedious, are also
somewhat convenient. They take
no special acumen or adroitness
but they will be carried out no
matter who wins.
• It can represent the more
vivid grievances of the student
body, as a short of Scandinavian
type ombudsman.
Outside of these functions I
think it can be lionized, treated as
a novelty, for the good humor of
the body politic.
To mobilize some 1o opt for
ambivalence, to opt for an in
teresting final election, is why I've
conducted my front porch "ser
ious-nonserious" campaign.
