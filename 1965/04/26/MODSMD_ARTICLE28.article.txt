In the final analysis, or even
in the first analysis, Stanford stu
dents can come to but one con
clusion: The ASSU as a whole is
horoughly steeped in apathy. It is
the task of student government to
channel apalhy in some direction
or another. The usual course of
action is to attempt some recon
ciliation with the other world -
the world outside of the student
community. This to me seems
senseless since apathy channeled
is still but apathy. Apathy can sel
dom be turned to any worthwhile
use, and the interested minority
only irritate. If there is an alterna
tive to interested student govern
ment, clearly, it is apathetic stu
dent government, which 1 firmly
advocate, a student go vernment
should be allowed to play the
games of a bureaucracy without
the intrusion of real causes, of
true purposes. I advocate only a
return to apathy: students will
find their own causes whether
they are pointed toward them by
"student leaders" or not. My plat
form, rather separate from Mr.
Magnuson's since I have yet to
meet him. suggests
1. Intensified group study on
the use of boondoggle in 1he Rev
olutionary War (possibly orga
nized as living group exchanges).
The old skills are not to be for
gotten.
2. Lobbying for a physical edu
cation course in dart throwing and
spear hurling. In the present state
of world tension all types of war
fare and revelry may become im
portant.
3. More student-faculty cocktail
parties: to live is to learn.
4. That student government
should be allowed to atrophy if it
will.
5. Make (coerce) female Peace
Caucus members (to) prove that
they really love mankind.
But of course the truth still re
mains: even the useless can be
useful. II has been suggested that
I am not a serious candidate; per
haps I am not. The age-old prob
blem of ihe professed apathelique
(apathizer?) besets me to ap
pear interested in apathy shows
a lack of ihe all important lack of
interest; but I still take my apathy
seriously.
