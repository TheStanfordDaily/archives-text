During the three years I have
been working with the Women's
Recreation Association, there has
been a growing interest within the
WRA to provide a more varied
andl complete recreational pro
gram. While I was Treasurer, the
WRA purchased table tennis
equipment for any women's liv
ing group requesting it. Ihus pro
viding more recreational oppor
tunities, apart from the strictly
"athletic" activities.
As president next year. I would
encourage a continuation of this
trend, specifically with the spon
soring of bridge or pool tourna
ments. I would like the oppor
tunity at president of the WRA
to work energetically on the plan
ning and publicity necessary for
the success of the ARA's activi
ties.

In the past WRA has simply
been a coordinating body for the
activities of the various women's
sports, and has only occasionally
expanded its services by spending
a little money. But each quarter
WRA funds receive an allotment
from every woman student's tui
tion, and the treasury grows but
not participation of activities. This
money can and should be used for
more game equipment for free
time relaxation in individual
houses, more financial support for
intramural and intercollegiate
activities and equipment, and for
sponsoring professional and ama
teur performers to increase ap
preciation and knowledge of mas
ters in athletic fields.
WRA should be planning now
for the office and meeting space
which will be available when the
Health Service moves to its plan
ned building. The gym library
facilities can also be expanded
then. The project of remodeling
the lounge at (he Women's Gym
should be continued and pushed
to completion.
There is much which can be
done to continue and increase
WRA activities and services. I am
an experienced WRA Board mem
ber and sports participant, and
thus have a knowledge of past ac
tivities and present plans. As Pres
ident of WRA I would work so
that more women students feel
WRA exists "especially for their
enjoyment
