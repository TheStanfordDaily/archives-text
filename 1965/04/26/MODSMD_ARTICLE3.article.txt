### JOHN STEEGE 
Stanford's 135-foot schooner Te Vega, on her seventh cruise of I
research and teaching in marine biology, has been out of radio j
contact for about a week, official University sources announced!
yesterday. American and British naval units in the South Pacific;
have begun a search for the ship, and 31 passengers.

University authorities also said
they have ordered the ship's
agents in the area to institute a
search by private planes.
The Te Vega was last reported

J to have left the island of Vanikoro
i in tho Santa Cruz group on Sun
; day morning, April 18.
I, Those aboard include twelve
; graduate students, three faculty
members, a doctor, and captain
I and crew of 14.
"We are taking all precautions!
in view of the loss of radio con j
tact." said Dr. Hubert Hefl'ner, 1
Stanford associate provost for re
| search. "Our lack of radio contact
with the ship is the only indication'
that she might be in difficulty."
Ho said it was possible the ship
was safe at Tikopia, her next is
land destination en route to Suva
in the Fi.jis. Tikopia is about 130
miles southeast of Vanikoro.
Neither island has commercial
radio or cable communications.
Normally, T«* Yej»:i notifies au

'via the ship's radio. Officials said
lone reason for lack of messages!
! may be that the vessel's radio may
have become disabled.
There was no explanation from
Vanikoro of her continued radio
i silence, University authorities re-|
ported, probably because of the
1 difficulties of communication in
• the area. |
