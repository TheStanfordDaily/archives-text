# Brinegar Seeks WRA Sec. Post
## 
### 
The position of WRA secretary
is essentially a non-political one.
therefore the task of writing a
platform is marie that much more
difficult. I could, of course, pro
mise to take neater notes, how
ever, this would imply a deficiency
upon the part of my predecessor
which I most certainly do not
mean to intimate.
I will promise, if eleeted. to try
to further the understanding of
the women students at Stanford of
the purpose and functions of
WRA,and act as one of WRA's
liaisons to the women students in
order that WRA might best em
ploy the funds available to it. In
closing, my one qualification for
this office is my unbounded en
thusiasm for WRA.
