# Leonard, Hall Vie in Race For Senior Class President
## 
### 
Its first year- at Stanford, the
Class of 19C56 excused itself from
the tables of government; it had
no business there. Its second year,
the Class basked in its wisdom
it still had no business. This year.
! still ungoverncd, the Class is still
wise, for it still has not business.
Next year, however, to preserve
| our wisdom we musl revive our
government, for we will have
much business.
I intend to make all that busi
ness pleasurable. I propose that
the social concerns of the Class
Senior Reunions, Flicks, Happy
Hours, Concerts, Think and
Drinks- - should be bigger better
focused, and more exciting. Grad
uation Week, 100, needs more
focus, and certainly a spark of
I something exciting.
A bigger, better-focused, more
[exciting Senior Agenda will be
happily intended to bring the
j Class closer together. But if 1 am
President the Class will have more
than just fun with itself. For I see
the whole purpose of increased
size, focus, and excitement to be
! a stimulus.
Out - Class can perform a sub
stantial service to itself and to
! the University by orienting the
j numerous Senior programs and
activities to the goal of per
sonalizing this community. A big
ger, better-focused, more exciting
! Senior Agenda is a perfect vehicle
; in which to arrive at rewarding
j dialogues between the Class and
; the Unversity, and between the
I Class and the Success and Prom
inence within our Alumni Associa
j tion.
With new ideas for Think and
Drink, Heritage Fund, the Col
j loquia Program, and a Class
; Alumni Structure, I propose new
j forums and new contacts which
will personalize the Stanford Com
| munity, as well as your Senior Ex
| perience.

With new ideas on Senior
Flicks, Happy Hours, Concerts,
Reunions, and Money-Raising, I
propose Class Intimacy a whole
new concept of Senior Together
ness.

Senior class government exists
to make actualities out of the
unique potentialities of the last
year in an undergraduate's career.
So the government must tic aware
of the dimensions of the senior's
uniqueness and be functionally
relevant toward this end.
Socially, being a senior is being
free, mobile, and twenty-one . . .
the end to fake ID's. It can also
mean the beginning of Happy
Hours in varied atmospheres,
Movie Nights that make money
as well as good times, a developed
program of Think and Drinks, and
a Senior Ball that has been con
trived to correspond to the class
real spirit. Tradition is an expres
sion of the senior's uniqueness
Traditional activities will be well
publicized and well-planned, and
starting with the Senior Reunion,
especially emphasised. The thirsts*
shall be satiated.
Benevolently, being a senior is
leaving a gift with the university.
Rather than donating an inocuous
but useless gift, volunteers from
the Sr. Class traditionally raise
money for the Heritage Fund
scholarship program. This policy
should be pursued enthusiast ically.
Reminiscently, being a senior
is making plans for future re
unions. The traditional officers
shall be appointed.
Academically, being a senior is
being immediately concerned with
the question "graduation . . .
then what?" 1 plan lo introduce
a very thorough prospectus of
FORECAST FORUMS which shall
disseminate to seniors a great
wealth of both graduate school
information and occupational out
looks. Class gov't can promote al
realy established programs, such
as the annual Business and Law
school forums, and eliminate ex
pensive duplication. I plan the
initiation of a GRADUATE OUT
LOOK COMMITTEE to work in
conjunction with the University
Career Placement Center.
This committee would have the
capacity to (1) capitalize on some
of the many programs, such as
summer management internships,
and high-risk high-reward pro
grams for graduate school aspir
ants, which the center has already
contrived but remain dormant for
lack of promotion, (2) schedule
house programs and informal
gatherings for the many graduate
school and corporation representa I
tives who visit our campus each
year, and many prominent bay
area Stanford Alumni as well, and
(3) critically review the present!
Job Interview Program which was|
less than 20 per cent efficient thisi
year. These activities can be rea-[
lized with a minimal expense to
the Sr. Class. The career place
merit, center is extremely enthusi-,
astic about the formation of this!
committee.
These directions of Sr. Class I
gov't are functionally relevant to I
the dimensions of senior unique-1
nest*, and can transform its poten '
tial into reality. To do so, however,
will require renewed interest, in
dustrious effort and participation I

from the memhors of our Senior
Class. In thoso and tho Hoot ion
I ask for your support.
