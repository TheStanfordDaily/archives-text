# WRA Vice-Pres. Sought by Keller
## 
### 
The stated purpose of WRA is
. . providing opportunities for
further enjoyment of recreational
activities . . The chief duly of
the vice-president is the coordina
tion of the various VV.RA activities
and the women students. Next
year I would propose the reestab
lishment of a quarterly guide to
the available activities so that a
larger proportion of the women
students would be made aware of
the diverse opportunities that
WRA offers to them.
