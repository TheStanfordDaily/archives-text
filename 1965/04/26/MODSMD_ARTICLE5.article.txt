# RADAR TELESCOPE
## Outer Space On A Platter 
### SUE DAILY 
Contrary to subversive rumors
whispered around campus, th e
"big dish," obsolete in its old age,
is not going to be converted into
a billboard for the; GCC.
Amazingly enough, the "dish"
has been almost continuously in
use since ils completion in 1963
to explore space exactly whal
it was hiull for.

The second largest fully steer
able radar telescope in the world,
the dish sends out a 400,000-watt
probe with which to "touch" the
sun. moon, planets and plasmas
of the solar system.
Contact Via Signals
These signals make direct con
tact with the objects of study and
return to the sender for analysis.

The dish itself has over half an
acre of antenna on ils surface for
transmitting and receiving.
The first important assignment:
which lhe dish tackled was dur
ing the total eclipse of the sun in
1963. Stanford scientists beamed
radar signals at the dark side of
the moon, measuring the electron
content along the eclipse path.
Saturday, Stanford astronomers
released the results of an experi
ment in which the dish measured
the density of electrons in the
earth's wake and in the "shock
wave" formed ahead of the earth.
Moon-bounced signals from the
dish antenna and a nearby 1,100-
foot array of pole-mounted an
tennas made the measurements.
The areas dealt with had less
particles in them than the high
est vacuum yet achiever on earth.
Pioneer Probe
At present, the dish is being
groomed for studies on the NASA
Pioneer Probe into interplanetary i
space to be launched this summer.!
A computer has been installed tc>|
aui omal ically direct the 70-ton an-'
tenna. Previously hand calculated, |
the dish will now bo able to track 1
a celestial object with an accu-1
racy better than one-tenth of a
degree.
On the planned Mariner flight;
to Mars, Stanford engineers hope j
to use radar signals to give them j
a profile of the density and com
position of the planet's atmos
phere.
Peterson feels that for the fu
ture improvements in electronic
equipment will extend the capa
bility of radar astronomy. He i
points out that, compared to na- j
t tire's signal sources, man's at- i
tempt to produce radio frequency ;
power are "really quite insignifi-1
cant.." Radar astronomy can never
advance beyond Ih<> solar system i

Contrary to subversive rumors
whispered around campus, th e
"big dish," obsolete in its old age,
is not going to be converted into
a billboard for the; GCC.
Amazingly enough, the "dish"
has been almost continuously in
use since ils completion in 1963
to explore space exactly whal
it was hiull for.

The second largest fully steer
able radar telescope in the world,
the dish sends out a 400,000-watt
probe with which to "touch" the
sun. moon, planets and plasmas
of the solar system.
Contact Via Signals
These signals make direct con
tact with the objects of study and
return to the sender for analysis.

The dish itself has over half an
acre of antenna on ils surface for
transmitting and receiving.
The first important assignment:
which lhe dish tackled was dur
ing the total eclipse of the sun in
1963. Stanford scientists beamed
radar signals at the dark side of
the moon, measuring the electron
content along the eclipse path.
Saturday, Stanford astronomers
released the results of an experi
ment in which the dish measured
the density of electrons in the
earth's wake and in the "shock
wave" formed ahead of the earth.
Moon-bounced signals from the
dish antenna and a nearby 1,100-
foot array of pole-mounted an
tennas made the measurements.
The areas dealt with had less
particles in them than the high
est vacuum yet achiever on earth.
Pioneer Probe
At present, the dish is being
groomed for studies on the NASA
Pioneer Probe into interplanetary i
space to be launched this summer.!
