## 
### DOUG OHMANS 
Stanford's policy regarding
scholarship gifts restricted to a
particular race or creed was ar
ticulated by the Board of Trustees
in December, 1964, according to
Dnryl Pierson, University General
Secretary.
The Trustees' statement ex
presses the guidelines used in
evaluating fund offers:
"A careful review of the rele
vant factors indicates thai < h e
proper present pulley of I lie Ini
versit.v renders scholarship gills
hearing restrictions us to race
acceptable only if stated in terms
of preference, and renders un
acceptable scholarship gills
which discriminate unfairly
against any group or which bear
direct or indirect restrictions as
to creed,"
Pierson refused to comment on
how strictly the word "prefer
ence" is interpreted. "J think that
the statement should stand as it
is," he said.
He added, however, that i Stan
ford was offered a scholarship re
strioted to white students, "we
certainly would not accept it."
Pierson pointed old that such a

restriction would be very difficult
to administer, because neither
race nor creed must be stated on
Stanford applications.
