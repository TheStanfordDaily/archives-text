## Dean's Offices Will Be Moved 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Union residence will lie closed
I Winter Quarter next year and
j remodelled to serve as an ad
i ministrative office area.
The 80-odd women of Union
' plus 40 other junior and senior
! women will be moved into a new
; high rise apartment building in
I Escondido village. This apartment
will be used as a dorm until 1968,
when the planned Margaret Jacks
and Robert Moore houses are
completed.
The Union residence will become
what John Fosberg, Director of
Residences, called a "Dean of Stu
dents office area." He said that
the Dean of Students, the Deans
of Men and Women "if there is
one" the Registrar, the Office of
Admissions and Placement, and
perhaps the offices for counselling
and testing will all be moved into
the old Union.
Inner Quad Expansion
This move will permit an ex-,
pansion of academic space on |
Inner Quad for the school of
humanities and sciences.
All the new Escondido village!
apartments will be available to
juniors and seniors. They will be!
doubles renting at $180 per quar
ter per student. This is the samcj
figure that: graduate students liv-1
ing in Escondido pay, but $40 morej
than other undergraduates are!
charged.
Each apartment will include a
living room, bedroom, and kitchen.
Students may do their own cook j
ing or buy meal tickets for the!
Encina commons.
Forty of the 120 women that j
will be moved into Escondido will
come from the overcrowded Lag-;
unita Court complex and from a
slight increase in the number of I
women transfer students.
