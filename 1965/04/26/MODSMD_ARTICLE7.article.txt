# Union Dorm Will Close; Escondido To Take 120
## Dean's Offices Will Be Moved 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Union residence will be closed
Winter Quarter next year and
j remodelled to serve as an ad
ministrative office area.
The 80-odd women of Union
plus 40 other junior and senior
women will be moved into a new
high rise apartment building in
Escondido village. This apartment
will be used as a dorm until 1968,
when the planned Margaret Jacks
and Robert Moore houses are
completed.
The Union residence will become
what John Fosberg, Director of
Residences, called a "Dean of Stu
dents office area." He said that
the Dean of Students, the Deans
of Men and Women — "if there is
one" — the Registrar, the Office of
Admissions and Placement, and
perhaps the offices for counselling
and testing will all be moved into
the old Union.
Inner Quad Expansion
This move will permit an ex-
pansion of academic space on
Inner Quad for the school of
humanities and sciences.
All the new Escondido village
apartments will be available to
juniors and seniors. They will be
doubles renting at $180 per quar
ter per student. This is the same
figure that graduate students liv-
ing in Escondido pay, but $40 more
than other undergraduates are
charged.
Each apartment will include a
living room, bedroom, and kitchen.
Students may do their own cook-
ing or buy meal tickets for the
Encina commons.
Forty of the 120 women that
will be moved into Escondido will
come from the overcrowded Lag-
unita Court complex and from a
slight increase in the number of
women transfer students.
Drawing Procedure
Assistant Dean of Women Eliza-
beth Avery said that information
on the drawing procedure to be
used will be distributed to all
women's residences this week.
Senior Donna Shellenberger,
head of the Associated Women
Students housing committee, told
The Daily that there would be a
special draw for the apartments
the week before the regular Fall
Quarter draw next year.
Sophomores in the Union —
freshmen who draw into the dorm
this Spring — will not. be able to
draw for the apartments. Shel-
lenberger said that of the 120 ac
cepted, 60 per cent would be sen-
iors and 40 per cent would be
juniors. She also revealed that the
preference list would be:
1) seniors in Union.
2) juniors in Union.
3) other seniors.
4) other juniors (as defined by
the social regulations).

Students housing committee, told
The Daily that there would be a
special draw for the apartments
the week before the regular Fall
Quarter draw next year.
Sophomores in the Union —
freshmen who draw into the dorm
this Spring — will not. be able to
draw for the apartments. Shel-
lenberger said that of the 120 ac
cepted, 60 per cent would be sen-
iors and 40 per cent would be
juniors. She also revealed that the
preference list would be:
1) seniors in Union.
2) juniors in Union.
3) other seniors.
4) other juniors (as defined by
the social regulations).
Union residence will be closed
Winter Quarter next year and
j remodelled to serve as an ad
ministrative office area.
The 80-odd women of Union
plus 40 other junior and senior
women will be moved into a new
high rise apartment building in
Escondido village. This apartment
will be used as a dorm until 1968,
when the planned Margaret Jacks
and Robert Moore houses are
completed.
The Union residence will become
what John Fosberg, Director of
Residences, called a "Dean of Stu
dents office area." He said that
the Dean of Students, the Deans
of Men and Women — "if there is
one" — the Registrar, the Office of
Admissions and Placement, and
perhaps the offices for counselling
and testing will all be moved into
the old Union.
Inner Quad Expansion
This move will permit an ex-
pansion of academic space on
Inner Quad for the school of
humanities and sciences.
All the new Escondido village
apartments will be available to
juniors and seniors. They will be
doubles renting at $180 per quar
ter per student. This is the same
figure that graduate students liv-
ing in Escondido pay, but $40 more
than other undergraduates are
charged.
Each apartment will include a
living room, bedroom, and kitchen.
Students may do their own cook-
ing or buy meal tickets for the
Encina commons.
Forty of the 120 women that
will be moved into Escondido will
come from the overcrowded Lag-
unita Court complex and from a
slight increase in the number of
women transfer students.

Assistant Dean of Women Eliza-
beth Avery said that information
on the drawing procedure to be
used will be distributed to all
women's residences this week.
