# ASS I Primary Elections Begin Two Day Run Today
## 
### 
For student representatives and officers primary elections be
gin today and continue through tomorrow with competition for
the various positions varying from heated to apathetic. Students
will have plenty of opportunity to voice their opinions since
polling places are to be located throughout the campus.

Heading the slate in the lively
ASSU President election are Dave
Robbing, Sandy MaeKenzie, Ed
Shaw, and Roger Magnuson. Run
ning with them are their respec
tive vice-presidents Frank Morse,
Clark Brown, Doug Sorenson. and
George Soule.
The field in the running for
Senior Class President appears

to he more limited. Stephen Leon
ard and Ira Hall will be tho lone
men on this ticket which only
Juniors may vote on. There are
no formal candidates for Senior
Class Vice-President and the win
ner of this slot will have to bo
written in.
I jack of Competition
Candidates who seem 1o be as
sured of winning because of a
lack of competition are Chick Sul
livan, who is running for the posi
tion of Associated Women Stu
dent President and Judy Bader,
who is seeking the vice-presidency
of the AWS.
Offices of the Women's Recrea
tional Association will be filled
with about the same degree of ex
citement as the AWS positions
will. Though Rae Kanne and Dian
Odd] both are striving for the
WRA President, Carolyn Keller
has no opposition for WRA Vice-
President and Becky Brinegar will
probably be another lone ranger
in her race for WRA Secretary.
Candidates for National Student
Association Representatives will
be selected on the final ballot dur
ing the last election on May 3 and
4. Nominations for these positions
must be in before 4 p.m. tomor
row at the ASSU office in order
to be considered.

Off Campus LASSU Reps
Elections of Undorgraduafe Off-
Campus Legislature Representa
tives should prove to be interest
ing if for no other reason than
tho large number of candidates.
Hoping to be in the winner's cir
cle will be Sylvia Nanney, Chuck
Ludlam, Harrison Brown, Michael
Collins, David Heskett, Charles
Dryden, Martin Kresse, Jerome
Silbergele, Richard Holkar, Rob
ert Tobbins, Linn Asper, Ti m
Haight, tSeven Panics, Roger Mo
Daniel, Jerry Hearn, Cejul Si a,
Barry Ames, Wiley Ramey, Gerry
Davis, Breg Barney, and Ken Ma
lovos. Voters eligible to partici
pate in the election of Off-Campus
Representatives will be given a
white ballot listing these names
in addition to the regular ballot.
This action is being taken because
of a misspelling of some of the
names.
Besides filling offices, voters
will also have the opportunity to
approve or reject a proposed con
stitutional amendment. This
amendment would change Article
111, Section 6, which deals w i th
the Speaker of the Student Legis
lature, to strike the provision that
he lie elected at the beginning of
he academic year.
Polling places spread over the
campus will be: Post Office; Engi
nering Corner; Main Library, all
9 a.m.-4 p.m.; Physics Tank, 9
a.m.-noon; Medical Center, 9 a.m.-
