VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE BARREL
As everyone knows, thirteen-twelfths of the earth's surface is
water. Tims we can see how important it is to know ancl under
stand our oceans. Toward this end American colleges last year
embarked 011 a program to increase enrollment in oceanography.
I am pleased to report that results were nothing short of sped ac
ular: In one single semester the number of students majoring in
oceanography rose by 100% —from one student to two!
But more oceanographers are still needed, and so today this
column, normally a vehicle for slapdash jocularity, will instead
devote itself to a brief course in oceanography. In view of the
solemnity of the subject matter, my sponsors, the Persotma
Stainless Steel Razor Blade Co., makers of Pcrsonna Stainless
Sleel Razor Blades which give you more luxury shaves than
Beep-Beep or any ol her brand you can name —if, by chance, you
don't agree, the makers of Pcrsonna Stainless Steel Razor Blades
Avill buy you n pack of whatever brand you think is better —my
sponsors, I say, the Pcrsonna Stainless Steel Razor Blade Co.
will today, because of the solemnity of this column, forego their
usual commerciid message.
We begin our study of oceans wilh that ever-popular favorite,
the Pacific. Largest of all oceans, the Pacific was discovered by
Balboa, a Spanish explorer of great vision. To give you an idea of
Balboa's vision, he first saw the Pacific while standing on a peak
in Darien, which is in Connecticut.
The Pacific is not only the largest ocean, but Ihe deepest. The

Mindanao Trench, off the Philippine Islands, measures more
than 5,000 fathoms in depth. (II should lx\ pointed out here that
ocean depths are measured in fathoms —lengths of six feet —
after Sir Walter Fathom, a British nobleman of Elizabethan
times who, upon his eighteenth birthday, was given a string six
feet long. Many young men would have sunk in a funk if all they
got for their birthday was a siring six feet long, but not Sir
Walter! String in hand, he scampered around the entire coast of
England measuring sea water until he was arrested for loitering.
Incidentally, a passion for measuring seems to have run in the
family: Fathom's grand nephew, Sir John Furlong, spent all his
waking hours measuring racetracks until Charles il had him be
headed in honor of the opening of 1 he 1 jondon School of Econom
ics.)
Hut I digress. Let us, as the poet Maseficld says, go down to
the sea again. (The sea, incidentally, has ever been a favorite
subject for poets and composers. Who does not know and love
the many robust sea chanties that have enriched our folk music
—songs like "Sailing Through Kansas" and "I'll Swab Your
Deck If You'll Swab Mine" and"The Artificial Respiration
Polka.")
My own favorite sea chanty goes like this: (I'm sure you all
know it. Why don't you sing along as you read?)
O, carry me to the deep blue eca,
Where I can live with honor,
An d every place I'll shove my face
With Stainless Steel Personor.
Sing hi, sing ho, sing mal-de-mer,
Sing hey and nonny-nonny,
Sing Jimmy crack corn and I don't care,
Sing Stainless Steel Pcrsonny.
I'U harpoon whales and jib my soils,
A nd read old Joseph Conrad,
And take my shaves upon the waves,
With Stainless Steel Personrad.
Sing la, sing 10, sing o-lec-a-lay,
Sing night and noon and morning,
Sing salt and spray and curds and whey,
Sing Stainless Steel Persoinivg.
