## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball
team copied the varsity by win
two of three games last weekend
to remain on top in the Bay Area
frosh league. The Papooses are
11-2, closely followed by Santa
Clara, at 7-2.
Thursday the team swept a
doubleheader from San Jose, 4-1
and 5-1. Saturday they lost a cru
cial tilt to Santa Clara, 4-3. All
games were played on The frosh
diamond.
Tribe pitchers effectively throt
tled San Jose bats, as both Spar
tan runs were unearned. Bill Holt
overcame previous arm trouble in
winning Ihe first game, and Hi
Lewis hurled five innings of score
less relief in the second contest.

Lewis' Bat Hot
Lewis did virtually everything
else in the game, also. He had!
three hits in five trips, three I
RBl's, and scored the other two
runs. In the 10th inning, he|
swatted a bases-loaded triple and
later scored for the final 5-1 mar-|
gin. In ihe first game, he was two
for three.
Against arch-rival Santa Clara,
Stanford carried a .'-5-2 lead into i
the eighth inning. The Broncos
took advantage of a routine fly,
hall that was dropped, going for!
a triple. After an intentional
walk, another triple off pitcher
Frank Klinger resulted in the win
ning Bronco runs.
Stanford hit the ball well all
through the game, but always to
ward a Bronco fielder. A 395-foot j
line drive by Klinger with the
bases loaded went for an out, andj
only a single run scored on the I
tag-up.
