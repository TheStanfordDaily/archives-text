## What Is Education? 
### JOHN BRYSON (First in a Series 
Editor's Note: Tills article is the
first in a series oil higher edu
cation. The series, written by a
group of Stanford students who
have heen working all year with
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Education, Dr. Mervin Freedman,
will consider the philosophy, aims,
and ideals of university education
—with particular attention to edu
cational problems at Stanford. The
introductory article which follows
is by John Bryson. ASSU Aca
demic Affairs Chairman —origina-
tor of the academic affairs semi
nar.
The student-powered civil rights
movement and other student
movements across the nation in re
cent months have dramatically
demonstrated that a significant
segment of the American student
population does not fit the tradi
tional "Joe College" stereotype.
That a twenty-year old Aaieri
can youth would risk graduate
school entrance, his professional
career, and even his life in defense
of civil liberties is a shocking fact
a fact incomprehensible to a
complacent American society
which for years has given verbal
affirmation to the slogan: "the
students of today are the leaders
of tomorrow," while, in practice,
it has been thwarting preparation
for responsible leadership by dis
couraging serious student concern
and involvement in major social
problems.
Student Involvement
Failing to understand the new
concern, the American
populace has reacted with appre
hension. The national student
community itself, however, is
slowly responding to the new
theme of student involvement.
Consciously articulated by some
and only vaguely sensed by others,
the general message is clear: "the
leaders of tomorrow" can and
must be vitally concerned with
the problems of today.
The tentative acceptance of this
notion is becoming visible in the
form of student unrest in univer
sities across the nation. At Yale,
at Princeton, at Trinity College,
and at the University of Michigan
students are actively pressing for
changes in university policy. At
Berkeley student protest has in
volved the entire campus so vigor
ously that it has made chaos of
the University. And here at Stan
ford a traditionally mild student
body lias demanded and secured

changes in judicial procedure and,
social regulations.
Dramatic Mailifestations
Pressure for dismissal of ad
ministrators, student ultimatums,
sit-ins, campus strikes—these are
the most dramatic manifestations
of the new student involvement.
But the new concern among stu
dents is more prevasivc than those
is o late d sensational incidents,
taken alone, would indicate.
At Stanford the resignation of
three women Deans, after stu
dents charged an infringement of
academic freedom, made papers
across the nation and was flashed
glaringly on the front page of
the San Francisco Chronicle. But!
these changes were not the result
of agitation by the few, rather
they resulted from general con
cern by the many. And this is only
one dramatic event in a general
surge of student questioning of;
university policy.
The GGC, SAUS, COUP, WEDG
—all are new student organiza
tions which have sprung up this
year out of the new interest from
students in their academic com-1
munity. A recent student publica
tion, The Stanford Challenger, en
titled its first issue: "Toward the
New University." Finally, and
perhaps indicative of the strength
of the new trend, is the present
campus political campaign. Two
of the three serious candidates fori
Student Body President are has-j
ing their platforms almost exclu
sively on the need for student in
volvement in academic affairs.'
Education Seminar
In previous campaigns such
platforms would have been scoffed
at. But today at Stanford the|
tenor of student interest calls j
for purposeful involvement; with
out such an approach a candi-i
date risks missing the general
trend of student concern.
In the flurry of excitement over
the more senational organzationsj
and causes, there has been one
new student group on the Stan-j
ford campus which has been little |
known to the student body at i
large. A small seminar of about!
fifteen students, led by the As-1
sistant Dean of Undergraduate!
Education, Dr. Mervin Freedman,!
has been meeting once a week forj
the entire year to study and dis-j
cuss questions of higher educa j
tion.
What Is Education?
Undergraduates spend at least
sixteen years of their lives study-1
ing in a formal academic strue-J

ture. At Stanford most of them go
on to graduate schools, thereby
using more years for academic
education. And many of them will
become teachers, professors, or
college administrators and thus
spend their entire lives in educa
tion. Yet incredibly few students
have ever seriously concerned
themselves in any way with the
general questions of education!
What is education? What is a
university? How does one best
become "educated"? According to
what general philosophy of educa
tion are the specific programs at
Stanford established?
To give a few students the op
portunity to study these questions
our Seminar on Higher Education
was founded. We felt that such
a seminar could be important for
at least two broad reasons. In
dividually, we felt that a study of
education might aid us in seeking
to become educated persons.
Unique Perspective
Moreover, we are presently liv
ing according to a university sys
tem designed and run by people
for whom undergraduate life is
a dim memory, thirty years past.
Thus, we felt that, as students,
we might be able to offer a unique
perspective and new insights into
the questions of education which
might be of some help in improv
ing the system.
The seminar has progressed,
somewhat fumblingly, through
the year in pursuit of the realiza
tion of these general goals. We
have read about and discussed a
wide variety of topics from the
general philosophy of education
to the more specific questions of
possible improvement of the Stan
ford system. We have invited sev
eral faculty members and outside
experts on education to join us
and present their various points of
view. Now. in a series of essays,
many of which will appear in The
Daily, the students in the seminar
articulate some of the ideas that
we have discussed and developed.
The essays are not meant to rep
resent the consensus of group
opinion, nor do they purport to
offer propsals for the solution of
every campus problem. Rather,
they represent merely the tenta
tive conclusion,s based on the
year's study, of each individual in
the group. It. is hoped that these
essays will offer some insights
and stimulate further study and
discussions among students of the
problems of university education.

the year in pursuit of the realiza
tion of these general goals. We
have read about and discussed a
wide variety of topics from the
general philosophy of education
to the more specific questions of
possible improvement of the Stan
ford system. We have invited sev
eral faculty members and outside
experts on education to join us
and present their various points of
view. Now. in a series of essays,
many of which will appear in The
Daily, the students in the seminar
articulate some of the ideas that
we have discussed and developed.
The essays are not meant to rep
resent the consensus of group
opinion, nor do they purport to
offer propsals for the solution of
every campus problem. Rather,
they represent merely the tenta
tive conclusion,s based on the
year's study, of each individual in
the group. It. is hoped that these
essays will offer some insights
and stimulate further study and
discussions among students of the
problems of university education.
Editor's Note: Tills article is the
first in a series oil higher edu

group of Stanford students who
have heen working all year with
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Education, Dr. Mervin Freedman,
will consider the philosophy, aims,

—with particular attention to edu

The student-powered civil rights
movement and other student
movements across the nation in re
cent months have dramatically
demonstrated that a significant
segment of the American student
population does not fit the tradi
tional "Joe College" stereotype.
That a twenty-year old Aaieri
can youth would risk graduate
school entrance, his professional
career, and even his life in defense
of civil liberties is a shocking fact
a fact incomprehensible to a
complacent American society
which for years has given verbal
affirmation to the slogan: "the
students of today are the leaders
of tomorrow," while, in practice,
it has been thwarting preparation
for responsible leadership by dis
couraging serious student concern
and involvement in major social
problems.
Student Involvement
Failing to understand the new
concern, the American
populace has reacted with appre
hension. The national student
community itself, however, is
slowly responding to the new
theme of student involvement.
Consciously articulated by some
and only vaguely sensed by others,
the general message is clear: "the
leaders of tomorrow" can and
must be vitally concerned with
the problems of today.
The tentative acceptance of this
notion is becoming visible in the
form of student unrest in univer
sities across the nation. At Yale,
at Princeton, at Trinity College,
and at the University of Michigan
students are actively pressing for
changes in university policy. At
Berkeley student protest has in
volved the entire campus so vigor
ously that it has made chaos of
the University. And here at Stan
ford a traditionally mild student
body lias demanded and secured

changes in judicial procedure and,
social regulations.
Dramatic Mailifestations
Pressure for dismissal of ad
ministrators, student ultimatums,
sit-ins, campus strikes—these are
the most dramatic manifestations
of the new student involvement.
But the new concern among stu
dents is more prevasivc than those
is o late d sensational incidents,
taken alone, would indicate.
At Stanford the resignation of
three women Deans, after stu
dents charged an infringement of
academic freedom, made papers
across the nation and was flashed
glaringly on the front page of
the San Francisco Chronicle. But!
these changes were not the result
of agitation by the few, rather
they resulted from general con
cern by the many. And this is only
one dramatic event in a general
surge of student questioning of;
university policy.
The GGC, SAUS, COUP, WEDG
—all are new student organiza
tions which have sprung up this
year out of the new interest from
students in their academic com-1
munity. A recent student publica
tion, The Stanford Challenger, en
titled its first issue: "Toward the
New University." Finally, and
perhaps indicative of the strength
of the new trend, is the present
campus political campaign. Two
of the three serious candidates fori
Student Body President are has-j
ing their platforms almost exclu
sively on the need for student in
volvement in academic affairs.'
Education Seminar
In previous campaigns such
platforms would have been scoffed
at. But today at Stanford the|
tenor of student interest calls j
for purposeful involvement; with
out such an approach a candi-i
date risks missing the general
trend of student concern.
In the flurry of excitement over
the more senational organzationsj
and causes, there has been one
new student group on the Stan-j
ford campus which has been little |
known to the student body at i
large. A small seminar of about!
fifteen students, led by the As-1
sistant Dean of Undergraduate!
Education, Dr. Mervin Freedman,!
has been meeting once a week forj
the entire year to study and dis-j
cuss questions of higher educa j
tion.
What Is Education?
Undergraduates spend at least
sixteen years of their lives study-1
ing in a formal academic strue-J

ture. At Stanford most of them go
on to graduate schools, thereby
using more years for academic
education. And many of them will
become teachers, professors, or
college administrators and thus
spend their entire lives in educa
tion. Yet incredibly few students
have ever seriously concerned
themselves in any way with the
general questions of education!
What is education? What is a
university? How does one best
become "educated"? According to
what general philosophy of educa
tion are the specific programs at
Stanford established?
To give a few students the op
portunity to study these questions
our Seminar on Higher Education
was founded. We felt that such
a seminar could be important for
at least two broad reasons. In
dividually, we felt that a study of
education might aid us in seeking
to become educated persons.
Unique Perspective
Moreover, we are presently liv
ing according to a university sys
tem designed and run by people
for whom undergraduate life is
a dim memory, thirty years past.
Thus, we felt that, as students,
we might be able to offer a unique
perspective and new insights into
the questions of education which
might be of some help in improv
ing the system.
The seminar has progressed,
somewhat fumblingly, through
the year in pursuit of the realiza
tion of these general goals. We
have read about and discussed a
wide variety of topics from the
general philosophy of education
to the more specific questions of
possible improvement of the Stan

What is education? What is a
university? How does one best
become "educated"? According to
what general philosophy of educa
tion are the specific programs at
Stanford established?
To give a few students the op
portunity to study these questions
our Seminar on Higher Education
was founded. We felt that such
a seminar could be important for
at least two broad reasons. In
dividually, we felt that a study of
education might aid us in seeking
to become educated persons.
Unique Perspective
Moreover, we are presently liv
ing according to a university sys
tem designed and run by people
for whom undergraduate life is
a dim memory, thirty years past.
Thus, we felt that, as students,
we might be able to offer a unique
perspective and new insights into
the questions of education which
might be of some help in improv
ing the system.
The seminar has progressed,
somewhat fumblingly, through
the year in pursuit of the realiza
tion of these general goals. We
have read about and discussed a
wide variety of topics from the
general philosophy of education
to the more specific questions of
possible improvement of the Stan
ford system. We have invited sev
eral faculty members and outside
experts on education to join us
and present their various points of
view. Now. in a series of essays,
many of which will appear in The
Daily, the students in the seminar
articulate some of the ideas that
we have discussed and developed.
The essays are not meant to rep
resent the consensus of group
opinion, nor do they purport to
offer propsals for the solution of
every campus problem. Rather,
they represent merely the tenta
tive conclusion,s based on the
year's study, of each individual in
the group. It. is hoped that these
essays will offer some insights
and stimulate further study and
discussions among students of the
problems of university education.
Editor's Note: Tills article is the
first in a series oil higher edu

group of Stanford students who
have heen working all year with
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Education, Dr. Mervin Freedman,
will consider the philosophy, aims,
and ideals of university education
—with particular attention to edu
cational problems at Stanford. The

The student-powered civil rights
movement and other student
movements across the nation in re
cent months have dramatically
demonstrated that a significant
segment of the American student
population does not fit the tradi
tional "Joe College" stereotype.
That a twenty-year old Aaieri
can youth would risk graduate
school entrance, his professional
career, and even his life in defense
of civil liberties is a shocking fact
a fact incomprehensible to a
complacent American society
which for years has given verbal
affirmation to the slogan: "the
students of today are the leaders
of tomorrow," while, in practice,
it has been thwarting preparation
for responsible leadership by dis
couraging serious student concern
and involvement in major social
problems.
Student Involvement
Failing to understand the new
concern, the American
populace has reacted with appre
hension. The national student
community itself, however, is
slowly responding to the new
theme of student involvement.
Consciously articulated by some
and only vaguely sensed by others,
the general message is clear: "the
leaders of tomorrow" can and
must be vitally concerned with
the problems of today.
The tentative acceptance of this
notion is becoming visible in the
form of student unrest in univer
sities across the nation. At Yale,
at Princeton, at Trinity College,
and at the University of Michigan
students are actively pressing for
changes in university policy. At
Berkeley student protest has in
volved the entire campus so vigor
ously that it has made chaos of
the University. And here at Stan
ford a traditionally mild student
body lias demanded and secured

changes in judicial procedure and,
social regulations.
Dramatic Mailifestations
Pressure for dismissal of ad
ministrators, student ultimatums,
sit-ins, campus strikes—these are
the most dramatic manifestations
of the new student involvement.
But the new concern among stu
dents is more prevasivc than those
is o late d sensational incidents,
taken alone, would indicate.
At Stanford the resignation of
three women Deans, after stu
dents charged an infringement of
academic freedom, made papers
across the nation and was flashed
glaringly on the front page of
the San Francisco Chronicle. But!
these changes were not the result
of agitation by the few, rather
they resulted from general con
cern by the many. And this is only
one dramatic event in a general
surge of student questioning of;
university policy.
The GGC, SAUS, COUP, WEDG
—all are new student organiza
tions which have sprung up this
year out of the new interest from
students in their academic com-1
munity. A recent student publica
tion, The Stanford Challenger, en
titled its first issue: "Toward the
New University." Finally, and
perhaps indicative of the strength
of the new trend, is the present

of the three serious candidates fori

ing their platforms almost exclu
sively on the need for student in
volvement in academic affairs.'

In previous campaigns such
platforms would have been scoffed
at. But today at Stanford the|
tenor of student interest calls j
for purposeful involvement; with
out such an approach a candi-i
date risks missing the general
trend of student concern.
In the flurry of excitement over
the more senational organzationsj
and causes, there has been one
new student group on the Stan-j
ford campus which has been little |
known to the student body at i
large. A small seminar of about!
fifteen students, led by the As-1
sistant Dean of Undergraduate!
Education, Dr. Mervin Freedman,!
has been meeting once a week forj
the entire year to study and dis-j
cuss questions of higher educa j
tion.
What Is Education?
Undergraduates spend at least
sixteen years of their lives study-1
ing in a formal academic strue-J

ture. At Stanford most of them go
on to graduate schools, thereby
using more years for academic
education. And many of them will
become teachers, professors, or
college administrators and thus
spend their entire lives in educa
tion. Yet incredibly few students
have ever seriously concerned
themselves in any way with the
general questions of education!
What is education? What is a
university? How does one best
become "educated"? According to
what general philosophy of educa

and causes, there has been one
new student group on the Stan-j
ford campus which has been little |
known to the student body at i
large. A small seminar of about!
fifteen students, led by the As-1
sistant Dean of Undergraduate!
Education, Dr. Mervin Freedman,!
has been meeting once a week forj
the entire year to study and dis-j
cuss questions of higher educa j
tion.
What Is Education?
Undergraduates spend at least
sixteen years of their lives study-1
ing in a formal academic strue-J

ture. At Stanford most of them go
on to graduate schools, thereby
using more years for academic
education. And many of them will
become teachers, professors, or
college administrators and thus
spend their entire lives in educa
tion. Yet incredibly few students
have ever seriously concerned
themselves in any way with the
general questions of education!
What is education? What is a
university? How does one best
become "educated"? According to
what general philosophy of educa
tion are the specific programs at
Stanford established?
To give a few students the op
portunity to study these questions
our Seminar on Higher Education
was founded. We felt that such
a seminar could be important for
at least two broad reasons. In
dividually, we felt that a study of
education might aid us in seeking
to become educated persons.
Unique Perspective
Moreover, we are presently liv
ing according to a university sys
tem designed and run by people
for whom undergraduate life is
a dim memory, thirty years past.
Thus, we felt that, as students,
we might be able to offer a unique
perspective and new insights into
the questions of education which
might be of some help in improv
ing the system.
The seminar has progressed,
somewhat fumblingly, through
the year in pursuit of the realiza
tion of these general goals. We
have read about and discussed a
wide variety of topics from the
general philosophy of education
to the more specific questions of
possible improvement of the Stan
ford system. We have invited sev
eral faculty members and outside
experts on education to join us
and present their various points of
view. Now. in a series of essays,
many of which will appear in The
Daily, the students in the seminar
articulate some of the ideas that
we have discussed and developed.
The essays are not meant to rep
resent the consensus of group
opinion, nor do they purport to
offer propsals for the solution of
every campus problem. Rather,
they represent merely the tenta
tive conclusion,s based on the
year's study, of each individual in
the group. It. is hoped that these
essays will offer some insights
and stimulate further study and
discussions among students of the
problems of university education.
