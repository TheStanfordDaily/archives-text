# Consummate Artistry In 'World Without Sun'
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
"World Without Sun" was re
cently awarded an Oscar, which
normally is not fatal to a film,
but which in this case is grossly!
misleading. It got into the running'
under false pretenses as a color
documentary, mislabeled such by j
some unperceptive member of the!
Academy of Motion Picture Aits;
and Sciences, which august citadel
of commercialism probably would j
not be able to recognize a work of!
art on a museum wall, much less;
on a motion picture screen.
The point of all this being thatj
"World Without Sun" is a work'
of art, combining the virtues of I
prose and painting with the mi-;
racle of animation to produce
more than a mere shadow of re-;
ality, a mere conglomeration of
light and dark on a strip of cellu-l
loid. Its makers have, in fact,!
so skillfully chosen and structured
their material as to give their audi
ence not only a sense of Ihe rich

ness and complexity of existence,!
but also the wonder of it, of all:
that is comprehended in the verb;
"to be."
Original Aqiianuut
But to descend from the realms'
of the metaphysical for a mo
ment, "World Without Sun" is j
ostensibly about something quite j
exciting but, nevertheless essen-j
tially mundane. Jacques-Yves Cou-;
steau, the original aquanaut, has
established a sort of king-size sub
marine airpocket where divers can
live and work without having to
worry about decompression or the
bends.
His buildings are essentially col'-!
fee-cups turned upside down and
thrust into the ocean, except that
the material is steel and the air
pockets are crawling with labora
tories and scientific gadgets. The
air itself is shared by eight divers
and a parrot, who mind the ma
chinery and collect the specimens.
Skilltill Photography
Although there is a lot of loose

talk about scientific research,
photographing the sea and its in
habitants seems to be the all
consuming passion. Cousteau's
narration evokes not the cata
loguing instinct but the marveling
one, aimed as it is at underscoring
the mystery of life's grace and
profusion.
This last is amply displayed by
the photography. An awe-inspir
ing amount of skill must have
gone into it, since the camera had
to both create and direct dramatic
action. However, if the sea life
couldn't be moved around at will,
it didn't throw tantrums either,
so there was some consolation for
the cameramen in the midst of
undoubted frustration.
The finished product, narration
and photography alike, is practi
cally beyond praise. Be not de
ceived: "World Without Sun" is no
celluloid aquarium; it is life
captured with consummate arti
stry, a rara avis in the sea or out
of it.

"World Without Sun" is a work'
of art, combining the virtues of I

But to descend from the realms'
of the metaphysical for a mo
ment, "World Without Sun" is j
ostensibly about something quite j
exciting but, nevertheless essen-j
tially mundane. Jacques-Yves Cou-;
steau, the original aquanaut, has
established a sort of king-size sub
marine airpocket where divers can
live and work without having to
worry about decompression or the
bends.
His buildings are essentially col'-!
fee-cups turned upside down and
thrust into the ocean, except that
the material is steel and the air
pockets are crawling with labora
tories and scientific gadgets. The
air itself is shared by eight divers
and a parrot, who mind the ma
chinery and collect the specimens.
Skilltill Photography
Although there is a lot of loose

talk about scientific research,
photographing the sea and its in
habitants seems to be the all
consuming passion. Cousteau's
narration evokes not the cata
loguing instinct but the marveling
one, aimed as it is at underscoring
the mystery of life's grace and
profusion.
This last is amply displayed by
the photography. An awe-inspir
ing amount of skill must have
gone into it, since the camera had
to both create and direct dramatic
action. However, if the sea life
couldn't be moved around at will,
it didn't throw tantrums either,
so there was some consolation for
the cameramen in the midst of
undoubted frustration.
The finished product, narration
and photography alike, is practi
cally beyond praise. Be not de
ceived: "World Without Sun" is no
celluloid aquarium; it is life
captured with consummate arti
stry, a rara avis in the sea or out
of it.
"World Without Sun" was re
cently awarded an Oscar, which
normally is not fatal to a film,
but which in this case is grossly!
misleading. It got into the running'
under false pretenses as a color
documentary, mislabeled such by j
