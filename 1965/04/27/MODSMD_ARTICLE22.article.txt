## The 						Outside World Waits 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I enjoyed your near endorse
ment of my candidacy yesterday,
but I do wish you wouldn't as
sociate me with the petition to
prevent the legislature from
speaking on off-campus issues.
I have oft averred that students
have a moral obligation to set a
confused community straight on
relevant issues. But they must be
relevant issues. Like the bill be
fore the Minnesota state legisla
ture to prohibit necking in moving
automobiles.
In foreign affairs, student lead
ers must exercise their responsi
bility by commenting 011 such is
sues as the recently aborted Bul
garian coup; although our intelli
gence information on the coup
may not be too copious, why
should this prevent someone so J
representative as an ASSU Presi
dent from shedding whatever light
he can on the subject?
No, the outside world is wait
ing for mature, farsighted student
government to give birth to the
truth. Why should I deny them a
midwife.

• Islamic Piety
Edithor, The Daily:
Mr. Syed Razi's letter in your!
April 21 edition was very in !
teresting. Mr. Razi paints an
idyllic picture of Islam as a re
ligion dedicated to the "concept
of equality of man and to wipe]
out the barriers of race, color and
nationality." He adds that "Islam i
is a religion of love and peace!
among all men, not of hatred
and violence."
It seems to me. however, that'
the historical record of Islam is J
somewhat less impressive. May I!
submit the following points to]
your readers:
a) Islam spread from its Southj
Arabian cradle to the Middle East
and North Africa by means of
wars of conquest, not by friendly
persuasion, during the seventh
and eighth centuries of thej
Christian era.
b 1 Hunting and selling of Af
rican Negro slaves has been, fori
centuries, a specialty of Arab
slave traders. The practice was;
only officially outlawed in Saudi)
Arabia within tlie past year or
two.
0 The fierce tirades and prep-j
arations for war against Israel
hardly reflect the proclaimed
Islamic love of peace.
d) The treatment of Jewish
minority groups in Arab countries'
hardly corresponds to a concept,
of equality. In Yemen, until 1948, j
Jews had to live in sunken dwell
ings, in order that they should
not find themselves living above
an Arab. In Morocco, where I was
last summer, I was shown the
"mellah," or ghetto, in which;
Moroccan Jews arc forced to live;j
they have very little freedom to
travel, and are hated and humil
iated at every opportunity.
Mr. Razi's pious pronounce
ments do not seem to be matched
by reality.

• Draw System
Editor, The Daily:
Several months ago, we — asj
well as hundreds of others —
hauled on sports coats a little be

fore seven p.m. and made ready
for the first fraternity open-house.
Remembering well the frustra
tions of the year before when we
suffered rush as freshmen, we
were determined not to be super
ficial, rather to be as sympathetic
and understanding—and energetic
—as possible.
Three hours later we had failed, I
our house had failed, and twenty
two other houses undoubtedly had
failed also. Indeed, every year the
gladhand, the contrived conversa-j
tion, and the open cry "Super
ficial!" are the hall-marks of
rush.
The irony is that it is not simply
our clumsiness as conversational
ists that has made the six long
evenings a waste of everybody's
lime; it is the rush system itself,
and we as its supporters, who
must take the blame.
For rush sets out two nearly
contradictory goals: on the one
hand, to bring freshmen and
upperelassmen into real communi
cation; on the other hand, to con
vince freshmen to join a particular
house over all the others. Ideally,
the real communication will be
the basis for a freshman's choice.
Actually, the salesmanship de
manded by rush, especially when
compressed into six evenings and
several meals, almost always in
hibits, even prohibits, honest per
sonal exchange.
We assert, then, that the ulti
mate decision should be the fresh
men's; then, in the heat of house
loyalties and interhouse competi
tion, we try to make the fresh
man's decision for him.
There is only one honest resolu
tion of the problem to get rid of
the rush system. Every freshman
ought to have a full opportunity to
decide where he wants to live.
On this basis, we call— and espe
cially to those now living in or
pledged to fraternities and ealing
clubs for a renewed and serious
consideration of a draw system.

• Insulting Turnout
Editor, The Daily:
During the past few years there
have been numerous complaints
that Stanford does not bring in a
sufficient number of important
political figures to speak on this
campus.
This past Wednesday night
Governor Terry San ford of North
Carolina gave his opening address
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium to an
audience of no more than 40 stu
dents. Such a turnout is both in
sulting to a speaker of this stature
and embarrassing to those offic
ials of the University who invited
Governor Sanford to our campus.
In the future it would be hoped
that, students would stop com
plaining about, the number of
speakers the University brings to
the campus, and take those steps
necessary to insure a successful
turnout for those eminent political
guests who do come to speak. This
would be the strongest endorse
ment for an improved program in
the future.
