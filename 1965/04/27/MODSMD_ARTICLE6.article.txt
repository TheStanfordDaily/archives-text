## Open Season on Universities 
### 
"Open season on higher education is about to
begin. Professors and college presidents should
polish their bulletproof vests and prepare to defend
themselves from all sides."
These were the words of Stanford's dean of un
dergraduate education Robert J. Wert before an
honors convocation at Los Angeles Stale College
yesterday.
The critics who once aimed their fire at high
schools are going to bo directing their criticism at
colleges, Wert insisted. This criticism will come
from activist students, as well as from"the coun
terparts of Rickover, Conant, and Bestor."
Wort said that a great "change confronting the
colleges is the growing student drive for self
determination and autonomy."
"Historically, this is a relatively new concept.
College faculties and college presidents heretofore
have tended to be highanded, if not obstreperous,
in dealing with students. But things seem to be
changing."
Wort explained that tho American Civil Liberties
Union, the National Student Association. The
American Association of University Professors,
Students for a Democratic Society, and recent
critics of the colleges such as Paul Goodman, have
all asserted that like other Americans, students
have certain "inalienable rights."
"The more activist American students know
that students in other countries have exerted
powerful Influences. Their own experiences . . .
demonstute tlint American students, if properly
organized, can be a potent social and political
lone."

Wert insisted that "a principal contest ior the
minds of students will bo waged in the colleges.
It will be serious, for keeps, and for high stakes."
He also remarked that students do not think!
much of the legacy which has been left them, nor
do they prize so-called "experience" or "common i
sense."
Some students have decided I hat reading, discus
sion, and learning are not enough. They want di-j
rect experience with the "real world," with import-f
ant problems, Wert explained. Thoy may attempt!
lo reform society's various institutions includingj
colleges.
"The pressure to obtain good grades hiis turned
them into young Scrooges. They consider grades
to be the basic currency of tho college. These stu
dents are the serious generation, as well as the
rest less generation."
Wert also pointed out that the rise of graduate
student enrollment is changing the face of the
university. Research and graduate instruction take
a great deal of faculty time.
But "undergraduates are beginning lo demand|
equal attention," he remarked. They want a "fair,
share of the university's effort."
Many of them thirst for an education which is
more personal than can be actieved in large lee-i
lures, by television, or by teaching machines, Wert
said.
"Undergraduates are insisting that universities!
reorganize themselves so I hat students will no
longer feel isolated or alienated from the univer
sity community."
