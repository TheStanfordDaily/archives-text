# UNIVERSITY REPORT
## Student Survival Rate High 
### 
Stanford has reached a peak
scholastic record of "high sur
vival" over the past five years,
according to a report made re
cently by the University to the
Western Association of Schools
and Colleges.
Stanford informed the associa
tion that its admissions program
"has virtually achieved" its objec
tive of selecting students who can
meet Stanford's "stringent aca
demic requirements." In June of

1964 more than 80 per cent of
tliose who had entered in Sep-j
tember 1960 were either getting
degrees or still working for them.;
The Stanford report was made;
to the association's accrediting
commission as a required prelim
inary to a five-year extension of!
the 1960-65 period of accreditation.
Stanford Successes
The report was enthusiastic in
its description of better salaries.!
high morale, richer academic fare,!

more student-faculty contacts, im- 1
proved facilities, and new levels of!
teaching quality and student abil-i
itics.
II cited the following facts:
• Stanford spent $80,816,288 in,
19G3-64 compared to $10,625 in |
1959-60. Nearly $23 million went
into instruction and departmental;
research, more than twice as much;
as in 1959-60.
• Funds for libraries and for
student aid and services nearly!
doubled. The total for organized I
research rose from $12.7 million;
to $31.1 million.
• Enrollment growth was de
liberately held down.
• Overseas campuses have]
proved "enormously successful."!
The report disclosed that Stan
lord still lags behind comparable
institutions in building area per
student. But, as students may
have noticed, construction under
way or soon to start will help re- 1
licve more of the space shortages.
Emphasis on Undergraduates
Stanford told the association
that undergraduate education is
getting concentrated attention and
claimed that experimental inno
vations are in prospect. These are
to include special courses for un
dergraduates taught by members
of the professional school fac
ulties, sophomore-junior courses:
combining field work with related
seminar work in social sciences,
and a seminar-tutorial program
for selected freshmen "to encour
age creativity and study-in-depth
in varied fields."
The report also explained thai
a Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion and a Committee on Under-!
graduate Education are now con
cerned with all aspects of under
graduate life.
Student services are reportedly
expanding. Ground has been brok
en for a new student health cen
ter, to be staffed by eight physi-l
cians, three psychologists and aj
psychiatric social worker. There:
are eight full-time psychologists in
I he counseling sen ice.
