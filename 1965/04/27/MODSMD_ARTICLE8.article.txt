The record for the highest num

was set in 1962, when 3600 stu
dents cast ballots in a vote that
swept Armin Rozencranz into
the presidency.
Cahill added that as of last night
no ballots had yet been received
from the foreign campuses, and
that those votes will not be count
ed unless they arrive before 4
p.m. today.

vez, opposite Stern; Ba.m.to4p.m.

providing for additional polling
booths specified that the Law As -j
sociation would man the poll. The
Law Association preside nI,
however was not notified of tho I
Legislature's action, and had no
time to make the necessary prep-1
arations.
Victory Claimed
Presidential candidate Magnu-j
son claimed victory yesterday, on!
the basis of the first day's pri
mary voting.
His victory statement read;
"having seen the eonvival if;
deracinated Stanford masses
march with genial insouciance to I
the polls I have waited patiently
for tho concession statements of
my opponents.
"Unfortunately, they have ap
parently elected to wait until the
last moment before throwing in
the proverbial towel. 1 can under-j
stand their hesitation, and 1 would
like to offer each of them a posi
tion as administrative assistant
in my new ambivalent aiiministra
lion next year.' 1
Magnuson based his claim on ;
the projection of selected returns,
from rooms in Donner House,
where he lives. "These figures I
show that I'm carrying 95 per
cent of the committed ambiva-j
lent vote and am making signifi
cant inroads into the uncommitted
ambivalent vote." he said.
"Some may think that this is a
little premature, since none of the)
voles have been counted yet, but
that's merely a formality."
Magnuson told The Daily that
he is planning a hundred-day pro
gram to carry out his campaign
promises. "Tomorrow I shall meet I
my Vice President, as promised. I
was quite interested in the plat
form he had in Monday's Daily."

dents cast ballots in a vote that
swept Armin Rozencranz into

Cahill added that as of last night
no ballots had yet been received

that those votes will not be count

Victory Claimed
Presidential candidate Magnu-j
son claimed victory yesterday, on!
the basis of the first day's pri
mary voting.
His victory statement read;
"having seen the eonvival if;
deracinated Stanford masses
march with genial insouciance to I
the polls I have waited patiently
for tho concession statements of
my opponents.
"Unfortunately, they have ap
parently elected to wait until the
last moment before throwing in
the proverbial towel. 1 can under-j
stand their hesitation, and 1 would
like to offer each of them a posi
tion as administrative assistant
in my new ambivalent aiiministra
lion next year.' 1
Magnuson based his claim on ;
the projection of selected returns,
from rooms in Donner House,
where he lives. "These figures I
show that I'm carrying 95 per
cent of the committed ambiva-j
lent vote and am making signifi
cant inroads into the uncommitted
ambivalent vote." he said.
"Some may think that this is a
little premature, since none of the)
voles have been counted yet, but
that's merely a formality."
Magnuson told The Daily that
he is planning a hundred-day pro
gram to carry out his campaign
promises. "Tomorrow I shall meet I
my Vice President, as promised. I
was quite interested in the plat
form he had in Monday's Daily."

dents cast ballots in a vote that
swept Armin Rozencranz into
the presidency.
Cahill added that as of last night
no ballots had yet been received
from the foreign campuses, and
that those votes will not be count
ed unless they arrive before 4
p.m. today.

arations.
Victory Claimed
Presidential candidate Magnu-j
son claimed victory yesterday, on!
the basis of the first day's pri
mary voting.
His victory statement read;
"having seen the eonvival if;
deracinated Stanford masses
march with genial insouciance to I
the polls I have waited patiently
for tho concession statements of
my opponents.
"Unfortunately, they have ap
parently elected to wait until the
last moment before throwing in
the proverbial towel. 1 can under-j
stand their hesitation, and 1 would
like to offer each of them a posi
tion as administrative assistant
in my new ambivalent aiiministra
lion next year.' 1
Magnuson based his claim on ;
the projection of selected returns,
from rooms in Donner House,
where he lives. "These figures I
show that I'm carrying 95 per
cent of the committed ambiva-j
lent vote and am making signifi
cant inroads into the uncommitted
ambivalent vote." he said.
"Some may think that this is a
little premature, since none of the)
voles have been counted yet, but
that's merely a formality."
Magnuson told The Daily that
he is planning a hundred-day pro
gram to carry out his campaign
promises. "Tomorrow I shall meet I
my Vice President, as promised. I
was quite interested in the plat
form he had in Monday's Daily."
