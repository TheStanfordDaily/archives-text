# TURPIN:
## Compassion Is Solution For Vietnam Necessities Needed Instead of Payments 
### BARB SAVERY 
According to Dr. James Turpin,
Wilbur's guest-in-residence who
spoke to a capacity audience last
nig h t in Tresidder's Largo
Lounge, the solution to the prob
lem ol Vietnam is compassion.
"The Vietnamese do not want
Communism. They went food,
homes, health, and self-suffici
ency.
They are not "bum," in the
American sense, because they are
poor; they simply lack the means
and the resources to be anything
but poor. And the only way to
help them is by dealing with
them where they are, on their
terms, using what is immediately
available to them."
"Whatever we do in Vietnam."
he noted, "must be personal; it
must involve us as individuals."
Suggesting that the U.S. gov
ernment's flat foreign aid pay
ments to Vietnam were not effec
tive in combating Communism
there, Turpin remarked that, "We
are in error in looking to our gov
ernment for the total solution to
Vietnam; we should ask oursel
ves how deeply we have bothered
to personally involve ourselves."
Turpin, who organized and is
currently heading Project Con
cern, a medical aid project that
has operated both in Hong Kong
and in Vietnam, noted that aid to
the Vietnamese should be "per
sonal, practical, well-organized,"
and, "emphatically, now."
