# $80 Transformer Silences Te Vega
## 
### 
A burned-out transformer in
the ship's 400-watt radio transmit
ter was responsible for the long
radio silence of the Te Vega, Stan
ford University's 135-foot schoon
er reported safe at Suva in the
Fijis after an air-and-sea search
for her had begun.
A cable received this morning
from her skipper, Capt. Jack
Thomsen of Carmel Valley, said
the ship would remain at Suva
for about 1.0 days. All 31 aboard
are apparently well and in good
spirits.
A new transformer is being
t sent by air and should arrive in
about three days, according to
an officer of Te Vega Expeditions
at Stanford's Hopkins Marine Sta
tion. The slation operates the ship
from her home port of Monterey
in a teaching and research pro
gram in marine biology under
support from the National Sci
ence Foundation.
The transformer, an $80 item,
"almost never" burns out, accord
ing to Mackay Radio experts
whose company furnished all

the standard ship's radio gear
aboard the Te Vega. Spares are
therefore seldom carried. When a
transformer does burn out, how
ever, there is no way of "by-pass
inf" it to make the radio work.
The weak signal from the ship
heard late Sunday night as she
neared Suva came from her 90-
watt emergency transmitter. It
operates on storage batteries and
has a daytime range of about 75-
80 miles.
Until then authorities had not
heard from the ship's radio since
April 14 when she arrived at
Vanikoro, about 750 miles from
Suva. It was later determined that
the vessel did leave Vanikoro, but
there was no explanation why she
had not radioed authorities of her
departure.
Normally the ship maintains
daily radio contact while at sea,
but keeps radio silence while in
port. In addition to her 400-watt
telephone-telegraph radio and 90-
watt emergency radio, she also
carries 15-watt hand-cranked em
ergency transmitters.
