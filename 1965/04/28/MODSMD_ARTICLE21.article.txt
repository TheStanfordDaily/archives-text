# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## The 						Subtle (and Nearly Lost) Art of Hectoring in the Broncs' Ballpark 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Baseball games last, on the
average, two and one-half hours.
The majority of this time passes
with the players in still life. Their
bemused concentration abruptly
shifts for several seconds at the
crack of a bat to a flurry of feet
then a scooping or reaching out of
a glove, and finally a quick throw.
But the everyone returns to the
status quo, except for minor al
terations depending on the suc
cess of the defense, to await the
next batter's fate.
Both players and spectators
must find ways to overcome the
lack of continuous action. Players
fight nervousness. Their weapons
are on-t he-field and batting man
nerisms, chattering among team
mates. and haranguing the oppo
sition. Spectators fight boredom.
To combat it, they have a choice
of feeding their face, listening to
KYA on a portable radio, engag
ing in mundane conversation with
friends and acquaintances, or
heckling the opposition.

Kabul Baseball Fans
Fans from Santa Clara, a school
noted and proud of its strong
baseball teams, delight in engag
ing in the latter activity. For die
hard Bronco supporters, seeking
out vulnerable aspects of a player
and then capitalizing on them is
second nature. They pull out all
stops except obscenity.
Because of their knowledge of
the opponents that play Santa
Clara, their remarks are some
times of a personal nature and
on numerous occasions obviously
strike home. The effects on tar
gets range from anger to laugh
ter.
Several of the student hecklers
who station themselves along the
third base side near the oppo
nent's dugout are seasoned pro
fessionals who wouldn't hold sec
ond fiddle to even a recognized
master such as Joe Garagiola.
Their method is a constant volley
of stock statements interspaced
with specific comments. The sec
ond-rate hecklers complement the
pros, but are ineffective when
their leaders happen to be absent.
Deep down inside, the hecklers
think their derogatory ranting
will have an effect on the game's
outcome. And indeed it might
have. Witness the proceedings of
the Santa Clara-UCLA game
played at the end of last quarter.
A Case History
For the early pail of the game,
the rooting section was without
its leader, Barry DeVita. His fol
lowers tried hard to muster up a
humorous yet effective attack.
Their efforts were valiant, but not
worthy of praise. Obviously,
something was lacking. He ar
rived midway through the game
when the Broncos were trailing
2-1. As soon as ho learned the
name of the person at bat. he let
fly. First baseman Ted Bayshore
was the quarry.
"Hey, Bayshore, you're brutal.
You're so bush I can't believe it."

I "Did you know you've got rab
i bit ear? Well, you have. Tuck 'em
J in."
"Did you hear me? Tuck those
rabbit ears in."
During the course of the next
few innings, the Bruins unsuccess
-1 fully attempted to bunt runners
into scoring positions. The UCLA
j coach was perfect bait. It must be
explained at this point that he
i has never been liked by the Bron
,co boosters, especially after he
had the umpire move the third
base rooting section to the other
side of the stands during a cru
cial game last year,
"How can you call yourself a
coach when your players can't
even bunt? How can you face
j yourself? You're brutal." Talka-
I tive at the beginning of the game,
! the coach became noticeably si
i lent.
One UCLA ballplayer, a genial
Negro, laughed at much of the
| commentary and he escaped criti
j cism. "You're the only good guy
i on the team. We're going to leave
i you alone." The poor fellow pro
ceeded to strike out.

Players on deck are favorite
targets. If they happen to be tak
ing overly energetic swings with
the weighted bat, several voices
lash out at him until he ultimate
ly stops.
Kabbil Kars Speaks
Bayshore appeared at bat in the
beginning of the eighth inning
with two runners on base and
made the last out. "Basher, you're
brutal. Do you realize what
you've done. You've let down your
team. You made the last out. And
to top that, you still haven't
tucked in those rabbit ears."
Walking back towards the dug
out, he addressed himself softly
but unequivocally to the stands
with the slogan of the four-letter
word controversy. The hecklers,
especially the strong-voiced lead
er, understandably increased their
ranting.
Santa Clara ultimately won the
game, 4-3, in the tenth inning.
The talk from the rooting sec
tion is not entirely directed at the
opponents. When the Broncos are
at bat, it is just as adamant, but
in a constructive manner. Th e i r
knowledge of the idiosyncrasies
of the Santa Clara players makes
for interesting listening. "Dirty
Al." otherwise known as "Pig
pen," Gallagher, sliding hard stole
second base. A voice pipes up,
"Bet he doesn't wipe off his uni
form. Sure enough, he continued
to play without shaking off any

of the dirt on his uniform and
without tucking in his shirttails.
The field is not the only source
of material. A fan with ankle
length black ROTC boots gets the
business as does a fan listening
to an FM radio station and one
dressed in gym clothes and carry
ing a basketball.
The Bronco fans follow their
team with zeal. The leader said
that many fans usually make the
trek to Southern California when
their team plays UCLA and USC.
"The Trojan fans couldn't believe
that we would go all the way
down there to see the game."
A Question of Tactics
One obviously asks whether the
tactics of the Santa Clara fans
have a place in baseball.
Although quick to criticize, they
are just as quick to applaud. A
good play by an opponent is as
appreciated as one by Santa
Clara.
Towards the end of the UCLA
game, the unofficial rooting lead
er was approached by a freshman
foreign exchange student, who
asked him to stop riding the oppo
nents because it was giving Santa
Clara a bad name. He replied
strongly. "What I'm doing is part
of baseball. It is partly what
makes baseball the great game it
is. We are not vulgar, and we
are not shaming our school. If
you don't like what we are doing,
1 hat's too bad."
