# Indifference In Education
## 
### PRESTON COVEY 
There are game books for children- sometimes
the pictures are used for contests which anybody
can enter with a cereal boxtop in which the ob
ject is to identify "what is wrong with this pie
ture?" On the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Survey
there is what is called a picture completion test
which immediately reminds everybody nowadays
of those game books. The subject is asked to iden
tify what important feature is missing from the
picture.
There is an element of irony in any situation in
which a professor speaks of accumulation versus
appropriation of knowledge on the one hand while
the conscientious students assiduously copy his
words into their notebooks on the other: "an ex
ample of objective truth is that everyone in this
room will die; this fact of life becomes subjective
truth when each one realizes for himself that lie
will die." The irony consists in the extent to which
the idea of subjective truth is treated as an ob
jective truth, the extent to which it is received
as one item among many from the grocery coun
ter labeled "existentialism."
James Collins' The Existentialists reads like the
inventory of an intellectual supermarket. First
among the five existential themes in the last
chapter is the Venture of Philosophizing, put for
ward in such a matter-of-fact manner as to create
a tremendous tension between the language and
what it is meant to convey. It is what Heidegger
might call "just talk." The language fails to get to
the bottom of what it is conveying, it is ironically
indifferent to what it "has to say."
Auden's Poetry
In Brueghel's "Icarus," for instance, we notice
how everything turns away quite leisurely from
the disaster. The curious indifference of the land
scape to the remarkable event is what is wrong
with the picture. In Auden's poetry, for instance,
we notice an ironic indifference, as both a major
theme and a device. An excursion into the theme
of ironic indifference in the poetry of W. H. Auden
Will aid our penetration beyond the Gcschreibe
("just talk"), towards the bottom of the idea of
"subjective truth."
Auden conveys the understanding of suffering
which he found in the Old Masters:
While someone els»» is eating or opening a win
dow or just walking dully along . . .
His ediction points out the ironic contrast: "rev
erently," "passionately," "miraculous," "dreadful,"
"martyrdom" versus "skating," "untidy," "doggy
life," "scratches," "innocent behind." Auden is sen
sitive to the discrepancy, the ironic fact that this
or that person walking slowly through an innocent
crowd is exploding inside, athough on the face of it
he is just another face in the crowd.
In the first stanza of "Musee des Beaux Arts"
the contrast between great events, concern, suf
fering and trivia events, abandon, indifference is
presented as a fact of the human condition. The
torturer's horse scratches his "innocent" behind.
No one can be held accountable that they should
be eating while someone else is dying on the oilier
side of the wall or under their "innocent" feet. It
is simply coincidental, ironic, and constitutes a
greater tragedy than would any suffering by itself.
The natural and innocent quality of ibis condition
is illustrated by the natural contrast between the
aged's appreciation of the birth of a child and the
children's indifference: children are not expected to
"specially want it to happen," to specially under
stand or appreciate what is miraculous about it.
Likewise, the flogs and the torturer's horse are in
nocent in their indifference to the moment and
pain of martyrdom.
Innocent Inhabitants
In the second stanza, however, the natural, in
nocent inhabitants of the landscape are held re
sponsible for not confronting the amazing event.
They are not simply unaware; they arc turned
away. It makes no difference whether the ploug
man "may Have heard the splash, the forsaken
cry." The point is that for him the fall of Icarus
was—would be—of no consequence. He had his
field to plow; what could he care of the pain
staking assembly of wax and feathers, the momen
tary triumph of rising body and spirit, of the
nausea of self-defeat, the dread of the fall, and
the overwhelming shock of pain and loss? The ship

calmly sails on to its "somewhere to get to," "ex
pensive," "delicate," with full sails, full hold, while
the boy perishes. The sun which melted the wax
wings shone on his white legs only because "it had
to." There is an added sense of tragedy in this
stanza. Under the seemingly indifferent "for in
stance" account, given in rhythms as leisurely as
the landscape, there is a passionate concern for the
fact that the men, the horse, the furrows, ihe sun,
the entire universe are indifferent to what is iron
ically the most significant event of that moment
of their lives. The calm, smooth flow of the poem,
the lack of a passionate statement, build the tension
and point with greater vigor to "what is wrong
with this picture," to the blatant tragedy and
gross indifference.
Ironic indifference plays a supportive role in "As
I Walked Out One Evening" and "Let Me Tell You
a Little Story." In the former poem the title em
bodies ironic significance. The speaker was taking a
casual stroll one evening when he encountered the
eternal conflict between love and time, between the
human will to eternity, and transcience, when he
encountered the temptation to despair and suicide,
the challenge to confront life's flux and ebbing
hours, its refusal to slow down and stop. The con
frontation took place "late, late in the evening" of
the speaker's life and there was nothing casual
about it. The image of walking out one evening re
calls the "someone . . . just walking dully along"
in "Musee des Beaux Arts" and suggests that in
this case it is the poet who catches himself taking a
casual stroll in that very evening of his life when
ho should hear the harping admonition of the
clocks, "stare, stare," "look, look," "stand, stand,"
"late, late," of the glacier knocking in the cup
board.
Auden tosses out the tale of Miss Edith Gee
with equally ironic indifference: "Let me tell you
a little story." A terse, detached indifferent ac
count is given of the small facts of her small life.
But the irony is again that the very smallness of
Miss Gee's wasted life is of great significance,
and the way in which the poet seems to turn his
back on her tragedy heightens the tension; the
stylistic indifference points emphatically to her
fatal, insignificant splash.
Theme Comes
Finally the theme comes to bear in "For the
Time Being." The title indicates the trivial quality
of the ironically large portion of people's lives spent
turning away from, being indifferent to, the new
life, the cry of Christmas passion. In the Breughel
painting Icarus' plunge into the water occupies a
very small portion of the total land scape. In "For
the Time Being" the Christmas oratorio occupies
almost all of the poem. Yet the world remains in
different for the time being,
When the spirit must practice his scales of
rejoicing
Without even a hostile audience, and the soul
endure
A silence that is neither for nor against her faith.
Auden's Modern Man is a good, common, average,
ordinary fellow who likes to take a drink, and
practice his scales once a year, whose kitchen table
exists because he scrubs it, and who is pretty busy,
after all. plowing his field for the Time Being.
A quaint little story, Christmas.
Well, so that is that. Now we must dismantle
the tree,
Putting decorations hack into their card board
boxes,
turkey scraps in paper bags. What about Hie
Vision? "An agreeable/Possibility." But i1 was a
small splash. Or, should we say, a spit in the ocean.
What Auden exposes in the every day culture
serves well as an illustration of another manifesta
tion of ironic indifference: the ironic indifference
which occurs in so many personal "encounters"
with ideas, with ideas such as existential truth,
with ideas such as education.
But we lx> uncommon, above average, extra
ordinary fellows who like to take a drink, and to
practice philosophical scales once in a while, whose
kitchen tables exist because we scrub them, and
who are pretty busy, after all, plowing our fields
for the Time Being.
What then about Education? "An agreeable/Pos
sibility.
