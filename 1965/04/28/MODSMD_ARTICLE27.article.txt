## Observations Offered On Stanford Activism 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Student activism is currently of I
great interest to administrators, I
teachers and students. With this i
idea in mind. I offer a few obser-;
vations on activism at Stanford. |
As a newcomer in September, I
was unfamiliar with campus or- j
ganizations and their "personali
ties." Not wishing to commit my- j
self lo any group unless it would
contribute to my development as j
a person and I could contribute
something to the group, my first j
quarter here was spent simply;
discovering the various organiza
tions, their purposes, and gener
ally who the members were.
By the beginning of Winter]
Quarter 1 had obtained a fairly j
clear idea of which organizations
interested me most. They had one i
common denominator, activism.
During Winter Quarter I at
tempted to meet many of the ac
tive students in order to ascer
tain, if only indirectly, what their !
attitudes were, why they werej
active on campus, and in general,
the motivation behind student in-1
volvemont in affairs outside the
classroom.
Lot me repeat that I don't pre
tend that these observations are j
statistically verifiable, but only I
j wish to express my reaction to j
I activism at Stanford as it seems I
! to me.
Stanford is composed predomi
nantly of students with middle!
I class backgrounds, and I am no
j exception. I had noticed that!
I many of the people involved in
! campus affairs were like me too, j
j in that they had been active in 1
| school and community affairs be-!
i fore they came here, and that
their extracurricular activities;
were probably a prime factor;
when they were considered for |
admission. The question in my ;
mind was this: Why, if they had
ample previous experiences in j
non-academic activities, had they j
; chosen to become active at Stan- j
J ford?
J My discovery was this: that'
; leaders of active student groups •
! were not working to simply raise
hell for its own sake, to become a ;
j big man on campus, or from j
a vague sense of idealism. < Al-;
though 'hey may have some of j
each of these motivations.)
The force lie hind active stu-i
dents at Stanford is far from
being negative or self-interested. |
| It is founded on a desire to be'
! constructive. Much like middle
! c'n'-s fommunity spirit, it is a
| force that rejects a purely para- j
sitie role in the university com-;
| munity. It is idealistic, the de-1
sire of some members to further j
| edify the institution that is help
ing to build and shape them,
j There is, I believe, a rarely ex
pressed aspect of this situation:
The active student leaders wish
: to constructively influence Stan-j
! ford WHILE THEY ARE HERE, |
I and to see some of the results of |
I their actions.
But when an idea for improve- j
' ment is expressed by active stu
| dents there is, as there always
| has been, administrative delay;
j first in considering the idea, next
j in implementing it. Tension de
velops when this delay becomes |
i excessive. The result, depending
lon communications, is either an
! FSM type demonstration, or a
I crisis, such as over the Judicial
j Competence Bill of LASSU.
The above remarks are not in
! tended to form an accusation or
j to convince anyone that activism j
J is the summum bonum on the
| Stanford campus. The intent is 1o
j clarify somewhat the motives of
student: activism here. With that
t goal in mind, I would address
i this letter to the main groups con
| cerned: administration, faculty,
and students hoping for three
j things:
Initially, that administrators,
more frequently consider, first
1 lie suggestions, then the mo
tivations of active students;
and that they increasingly tap
this resource of ideas. No plan-]
ning committee could have a
more vital concern or more ap
propriate ideas about Stanford
than certain of its students.
Secondly, that faculty members
not only encourage student
thought and activity outside of
the classroom, but contribute
their wisdom and maturity as
stimulating influences.
Thirdly, and perhaps most im
portant, I would hope that stu

dents, who l'or personal or aea- i
domic reasons choose not to he ,
active in the University com
munity outside the classroom,
do not simply ignore their more
active peers, hut be informed i
and critical, giving their sup- \
port as much as [>ossible. Often
the i)est ideas are wasted on a
hull session, without reaching' j
the proper channels. Activism j
alone does not assure the best I
ideas; it requires a broad base j
of student thought to lie really '
effective.
Time and space Limit proper dis
cussion of all the factors involved
ia the motivation behind student
activism. 1 have chosen to men
tion what I believe is a prime mo
tive. Perhaps others would care |
to add their thoughts on the sub-1
ject. I

* Classroom Conditions

Editor, The Daily:
In the April 26th issue of The j
Daily I here was an interesting
and informative paragraph on the
cost per capita of attending Stan
ford: i.e.. $2,850 per year (not in
cluding transportation). This is
quite a sum to spend on one's edu-;
cation, and it seems that for 1 lie i
money, as well as for the ideals |
of good education, each student
should be entitled to optimum'
classroom conditions. Unfonun-,
ately, this is not the case for the!
students of Mr. Harris's 1:15 En- j
glish class.
Continually our class is inter-1
rupted by men cutting the grass
between the Admissions Office
and our room. This has happened j
at least once a week since the be-!
ginning of Spring Quarter. Not;
only does this completely disrupt I
the classroom atmosphere, but
naturally and most understand
ably, it annoys our instructor.
It seems that some other time
could be found for performing;
such noisy operations so close to I
occupied classrooms.

Dear Doug; Olimans, et al.:
Those who would reform th e
! long-established practices of con
servative institutions undertake
great responsibility. First, they
must seriously analyze the faults
of the old order. Then they must
propose a better one and provide
• the active leadership to aecom
j plish it. Continual complaining
I without positive action serves no
! useful purpose.
If you are so convinced of the
| evil of the present rush system,
! why not take action to prove your
; point? Why not apply your pro
posed reform to Beta Chi next
year? Issue no bids and instead
accept as brothers the first twen
ty or twenty-five freshmen who
ask to live with you. Perhaps then
other houses will follow your

J is the summum bonum on the

more frequently consider, first

tivations of active students;
and that they increasingly tap
this resource of ideas. No plan-]
ning committee could have a
more vital concern or more ap
propriate ideas about Stanford
than certain of its students.
Secondly, that faculty members
not only encourage student
thought and activity outside of
the classroom, but contribute
their wisdom and maturity as
stimulating influences.
Thirdly, and perhaps most im
portant, I would hope that stu

dents, who l'or personal or aea- i
domic reasons choose not to he ,
active in the University com
munity outside the classroom,
do not simply ignore their more
active peers, hut be informed i
and critical, giving their sup- \
port as much as [>ossible. Often
the i)est ideas are wasted on a
hull session, without reaching' j
the proper channels. Activism j
alone does not assure the best I
ideas; it requires a broad base j
of student thought to lie really '
effective.
Time and space Limit proper dis

Dear Doug; Olimans, et al.:

self lo any group unless it would
contribute to my development as j
a person and I could contribute

common denominator, activism.

Dear Doug; Olimans, et al.:

must seriously analyze the faults
of the old order. Then they must

If you are so convinced of the

Student activism is currently of I
great interest to administrators, I
teachers and students. With this i
idea in mind. I offer a few obser-;
vations on activism at Stanford. |
As a newcomer in September, I
was unfamiliar with campus or- j
ganizations and their "personali
ties." Not wishing to commit my- j
self lo any group unless it would
contribute to my development as j
a person and I could contribute
something to the group, my first j
quarter here was spent simply;
discovering the various organiza
tions, their purposes, and gener
ally who the members were.
By the beginning of Winter]
Quarter 1 had obtained a fairly j
clear idea of which organizations
interested me most. They had one i
common denominator, activism.
During Winter Quarter I at
tempted to meet many of the ac
tive students in order to ascer
tain, if only indirectly, what their !
attitudes were, why they werej
active on campus, and in general,
the motivation behind student in-1
volvemont in affairs outside the
classroom.
Lot me repeat that I don't pre
tend that these observations are j
statistically verifiable, but only I
j wish to express my reaction to j
I activism at Stanford as it seems I
! to me.
Stanford is composed predomi
nantly of students with middle!
I class backgrounds, and I am no
j exception. I had noticed that!
I many of the people involved in
! campus affairs were like me too, j
j in that they had been active in 1
| school and community affairs be-!
i fore they came here, and that
their extracurricular activities;
were probably a prime factor;
when they were considered for |
admission. The question in my ;
mind was this: Why, if they had
ample previous experiences in j
non-academic activities, had they j
; chosen to become active at Stan- j
J ford?
J My discovery was this: that'
; leaders of active student groups •
! were not working to simply raise
hell for its own sake, to become a ;
j big man on campus, or from j
a vague sense of idealism. < Al-;
though 'hey may have some of j
each of these motivations.)
The force lie hind active stu-i
dents at Stanford is far from
being negative or self-interested. |
| It is founded on a desire to be'

Editor, The Daily:
In the April 26th issue of The j
Daily I here was an interesting
and informative paragraph on the
cost per capita of attending Stan
ford: i.e.. $2,850 per year (not in
cluding transportation). This is
quite a sum to spend on one's edu-;
cation, and it seems that for 1 lie i
money, as well as for the ideals |
of good education, each student
should be entitled to optimum'
classroom conditions. Unfonun-,
ately, this is not the case for the!
students of Mr. Harris's 1:15 En- j
glish class.
Continually our class is inter-1
rupted by men cutting the grass
between the Admissions Office
and our room. This has happened j
at least once a week since the be-!
ginning of Spring Quarter. Not;
only does this completely disrupt I
the classroom atmosphere, but
naturally and most understand
ably, it annoys our instructor.
It seems that some other time
could be found for performing;
such noisy operations so close to I
occupied classrooms.

• Positive Action

Dear Doug; Olimans, et al.:
Those who would reform th e
! long-established practices of con
servative institutions undertake
great responsibility. First, they
must seriously analyze the faults
of the old order. Then they must
propose a better one and provide
• the active leadership to aecom
j plish it. Continual complaining
I without positive action serves no
! useful purpose.
If you are so convinced of the
| evil of the present rush system,
! why not take action to prove your
; point? Why not apply your pro
posed reform to Beta Chi next
year? Issue no bids and instead
accept as brothers the first twen
ty or twenty-five freshmen who
ask to live with you. Perhaps then
other houses will follow your
lead.

Editor, The Daily:
Student activism is currently of I
great interest to administrators, I
teachers and students. With this i
idea in mind. I offer a few obser-;
vations on activism at Stanford. |
As a newcomer in September, I
was unfamiliar with campus or- j
ganizations and their "personali
ties." Not wishing to commit my- j
self lo any group unless it would
contribute to my development as j
a person and I could contribute
something to the group, my first j
quarter here was spent simply;
discovering the various organiza
tions, their purposes, and gener
ally who the members were.
By the beginning of Winter]
Quarter 1 had obtained a fairly j
clear idea of which organizations
interested me most. They had one i
common denominator, activism.
During Winter Quarter I at
tempted to meet many of the ac
tive students in order to ascer
tain, if only indirectly, what their !
attitudes were, why they werej
active on campus, and in general,
the motivation behind student in-1
volvemont in affairs outside the
classroom.
Lot me repeat that I don't pre
tend that these observations are j
statistically verifiable, but only I
j wish to express my reaction to j
I activism at Stanford as it seems I
! to me.
Stanford is composed predomi
nantly of students with middle!
I class backgrounds, and I am no
j exception. I had noticed that!
I many of the people involved in
! campus affairs were like me too, j
j in that they had been active in 1
| school and community affairs be-!
i fore they came here, and that
their extracurricular activities;
were probably a prime factor;
when they were considered for |
admission. The question in my ;
mind was this: Why, if they had
ample previous experiences in j
non-academic activities, had they j
; chosen to become active at Stan- j
J ford?
J My discovery was this: that'
; leaders of active student groups •
! were not working to simply raise
hell for its own sake, to become a ;
j big man on campus, or from j
a vague sense of idealism. < Al-;
though 'hey may have some of j
each of these motivations.)
The force lie hind active stu-i
dents at Stanford is far from
being negative or self-interested. |
| It is founded on a desire to be'
! constructive. Much like middle
! c'n'-s fommunity spirit, it is a
| force that rejects a purely para- j
sitie role in the university com-;
| munity. It is idealistic, the de-1
sire of some members to further j
| edify the institution that is help
ing to build and shape them,
j There is, I believe, a rarely ex
pressed aspect of this situation:
The active student leaders wish
: to constructively influence Stan-j
! ford WHILE THEY ARE HERE, |
I and to see some of the results of |
I their actions.
But when an idea for improve- j
' ment is expressed by active stu
| dents there is, as there always
| has been, administrative delay;
j first in considering the idea, next
j in implementing it. Tension de
velops when this delay becomes |
i excessive. The result, depending
lon communications, is either an
! FSM type demonstration, or a
I crisis, such as over the Judicial
j Competence Bill of LASSU.
The above remarks are not in
! tended to form an accusation or
j to convince anyone that activism j
J is the summum bonum on the
| Stanford campus. The intent is 1o
j clarify somewhat the motives of
student: activism here. With that
t goal in mind, I would address
i this letter to the main groups con
| cerned: administration, faculty,
and students hoping for three
j things:
Initially, that administrators,
more frequently consider, first
1 lie suggestions, then the mo
tivations of active students;
and that they increasingly tap
this resource of ideas. No plan-]
ning committee could have a
more vital concern or more ap
propriate ideas about Stanford
than certain of its students.
Secondly, that faculty members
not only encourage student
thought and activity outside of
the classroom, but contribute
