the record vote in this primary, expressing a gratifying increase

remainder of this week, we will try all the harder to units this
interest behind a meaningful program of action within the various
areas of student concern at Stanford.'
Robbins released the following statement: "This next week
should see a further delineation of the issues separating the two
tickets.
"We must discuss judicial reform, LASSU stands on olf-campus
issues, increased student-alumni contact, and greater integration
of the faculty and the students.

ticket and urge everyone to re-examine the candidates during
the coming week."
Losing candidate Magnuson told The Daily, "I don't want to
sound a sore loser, but there are just too many committed ac
tivists on this campus. Which is why I'm going to Germany next
January.
"With 463 committed ambivalents, and nearly 0,000 genially
apathetic ambivalents leaning toward my point of view, 1 feel
I could justly claim a moral victory, and hope that someday
Inner Quad can be made safe for ambivance."
