# EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
## Goldberg Recalls 'Filthy Speech' Controversy 
### ALBERT STATON 
On Wednesday of last week !
the University of California an
nounced the disciplinary action]
it had taken against four stu
dents involved in the so-called
"dirty word" demonstrations on
campus. Art Goldberg, a graduate |
student in education was dismiss
ed from the University. The others

j were given limited suspensions.
Four days later, on Sunday
' morning, he gave an exclusive in
! terview in which he discussed the
events leading to his dismissal.
In the meantime the FSM, dor
! mailt since semester break, had
rallied and telegramed the Uni
versity Regents that they had un
til Wednesday the 28th to rein

state the four students. The FSM
I reportedly was considering a pro
test if their demands were not
I met. On the surface, the renewed
activity resembled that of last fall.
But University President Clark
Kerr claimed the issues were ac
tually quite different. "1 do not
see and cannot visualize the stu
dents on campus and a number of

non-students off campus consider
ing the defense of obscenity as
they did civil liberties last fall."
Obscenity
Goldberg admitted student sup
port for the FSM on the new issue
might not be as great as it was in
the past, "Because," lie said, "ob
scenity is considered a bad is
use; it's much more unpopular."
But Ik 1 did not share Kerr's opin
ion that the basic issues had
changed. "1 think the issues are
interrelated. Both show the Uni
versity's power to crack down on
us arbitrarily, and. with the help
of the mass media, to win support
for the crackdown. The gains
made last semester were not con
stitutional gains. They were just
gifts from above, the way aristo
crats might give serfs more free
dom. The serfs, though, have no
way to make sure the aristocrats
won't take it away again without
notice . . . It's a battle to guaran
tee students rights, so they don't
always have to have mass dem
onstrations to protect other stu
dents; so that they can have cer
tain basic rights and certain com

mittee rights to prevent the uni
versily from handling them arbi
trarily."
The question arose whether con-.
sideling the tenuous treaty be-j
tween the FSM and the adminis- j
(ration at the time it was wise j
to give the speech that led to his
dismissal. "It wasn't a question of
: being wise or unwise,'' Goldberg
said. "The situation existed and
! something had to be done. It's
been said that the obscenity con
troversy put the FSM in a bid
| fight over a better issue.
"Rut you don't always choose
your issues. Spider magazine was
banned, and the FSM said it
i wanted to wait a little while. But j
j we just can't continue to wait be-j
' cause the administration is slowly 1
whittling away, gaining more and !
j more restrictions, until we will j
end up worse than we were last
■ semester."
Fraternity Muttons
Goldberg pointed out that at.
i the same time John Thompson j
was arrested for putting up a
! sign the size of half a sheet of
notebook paper, fraternities were
selling buttons with 'I like pussy'
and other, more pointed expres
sions on them. No charges were
brought against the fraternities.
"I thought it was unfair," he
said. "So I gave my speech on
that and also on ihe hypocrisy of
society's mores. I asked why
the word 'nigger' isn't consideded
obscene while the four-letter word
meaning sexual intercourse is. I
couldn't understand why society
arbitrarily had decided what is
obscene and what isn't. During the
course of the discussion I used the
word, and it caused the hall to
crumble."
"I don't quite understand this
guarantee of our morality," he
continued. "Usually it's the same
people who try to guarantee our
morality that supposedly have
those wild middle-class parties in
the suburbs."
According to Mr. Goldberg, the
development of the obscenity con
troversy caught the FSM "in a
state of flux. Many of the people
that were originally on the steer
ing committee were no longer on
it; some weren't even in town . . .
the students were tired after last
semester. They wanted to relax,
they wanted to get away from
here. There was no long-term
commitment."
As a result, the FSM did not
officially support Thompson and
his friends in the beginning. "It
just said that the students had a
right to discuss these things and
it thought it was wrong for the
administration to have them ar
rested. The FSM was wholly
against any disciplinary proceed
ings by the University before the
court proceedings took place."
When the administration re
vealed the disciplinary measures it
had taken, however, the FSM be
came more decisive. "I think this
time there will be some action
taken," Goldberg said. "I'm not
sure what yet, but if there isn't
action taken this time, it just
proves the administration's theory
that the FSM is finished."
Little HUAC
Goldberg leveled many criti
cisms at the manner in which the
faculty committee handled his
case. "In fact the committee was
like a little HUCA—House Un-1
1

American Activities Committee.
We didn't even have a chance to
testify because if we testified they
would use this evidence against
us in the court. We weren't given
the right to prepare with counsel
—they wanted to get it over with
; in a hurry so they could get the
j sentences out before the Regent's
meeting. The person who brought
the charges against us in one case
wasn't known (until later)." In
his opinion, Goldberg was given
a heavier sentence than the others,
"because I was a politically active
person, and this is a good way to
get rid of a person who's been
agitating on the Berkeley cam
pus."
Mi'. Goldberg was unsure about
his future plans. "I really haven't
thought too much ahead now
about what I'm going to do. I
think I'd like to go to law school,
but I don't know where. It will
probably be impossible for me to
get a teaching credential in this
state. This was probably one of
the University's purposes in mov
ing on me, and I think they did a
very good .job."
Mi-. Goldberg ended the inter
view by explaining his concept of
the ideal university. "The ideal
university is, to me, a place where
you go to study academically;
you know, you have your classes.
But when you leave the class
room, and if you're not in any
way violating time, place or man
ner—in other words, if you're not
interrupting classes by a speech
or throwing paint on buildings,
then any type of political discus
sion and any type of political ac
tivity should be allowed without
penalty to the student.
"I think if they want to pen
alize a student, the university can
bring charges against them in the
courts, but I don't think they
should jeopardize a student for
discussing absolutely any issue or
planning absolutely any po
litical activity on campus as
long as that discussion and ac
tivity planning in no way hurts
class activity. For example, 1
think it would be wrong to have
the microphone sit right next to a
classroom blasting out during the
noon rally. But in the plaza area
I don't see how it hurts anything.
It's an opportunity to discuss the
very sick society we live in."

tually quite different. "1 do not
see and cannot visualize the stu
dents on campus and a number of

non-students off campus consider
ing the defense of obscenity as
they did civil liberties last fall."
Obscenity
Goldberg admitted student sup
port for the FSM on the new issue
might not be as great as it was in
the past, "Because," lie said, "ob
scenity is considered a bad is
use; it's much more unpopular."
But Ik 1 did not share Kerr's opin
ion that the basic issues had
changed. "1 think the issues are
interrelated. Both show the Uni
versity's power to crack down on
us arbitrarily, and. with the help
of the mass media, to win support
for the crackdown. The gains
made last semester were not con
stitutional gains. They were just
gifts from above, the way aristo
crats might give serfs more free
dom. The serfs, though, have no
way to make sure the aristocrats
won't take it away again without
notice . . . It's a battle to guaran
tee students rights, so they don't
always have to have mass dem
onstrations to protect other stu
dents; so that they can have cer
tain basic rights and certain com

mittee rights to prevent the uni
versily from handling them arbi
trarily."
The question arose whether con-.
sideling the tenuous treaty be-j
tween the FSM and the adminis- j
(ration at the time it was wise j
to give the speech that led to his
dismissal. "It wasn't a question of
: being wise or unwise,'' Goldberg
said. "The situation existed and
! something had to be done. It's
been said that the obscenity con
troversy put the FSM in a bid
| fight over a better issue.
"Rut you don't always choose
your issues. Spider magazine was
banned, and the FSM said it
i wanted to wait a little while. But j
j we just can't continue to wait be-j
' cause the administration is slowly 1
whittling away, gaining more and !
j more restrictions, until we will j
end up worse than we were last
■ semester."
Fraternity Muttons
Goldberg pointed out that at.
i the same time John Thompson j
was arrested for putting up a
! sign the size of half a sheet of
notebook paper, fraternities were
selling buttons with 'I like pussy'
and other, more pointed expres
sions on them. No charges were
brought against the fraternities.
"I thought it was unfair," he
said. "So I gave my speech on
that and also on ihe hypocrisy of
society's mores. I asked why
the word 'nigger' isn't consideded
obscene while the four-letter word
meaning sexual intercourse is. I
couldn't understand why society
arbitrarily had decided what is
obscene and what isn't. During the
course of the discussion I used the
word, and it caused the hall to
crumble."
"I don't quite understand this
guarantee of our morality," he
continued. "Usually it's the same
people who try to guarantee our
morality that supposedly have
those wild middle-class parties in
the suburbs."
According to Mr. Goldberg, the
development of the obscenity con
troversy caught the FSM "in a
state of flux. Many of the people
that were originally on the steer
ing committee were no longer on
it; some weren't even in town . . .
the students were tired after last
semester. They wanted to relax,
they wanted to get away from
here. There was no long-term
commitment."
As a result, the FSM did not
officially support Thompson and
his friends in the beginning. "It
just said that the students had a
right to discuss these things and
it thought it was wrong for the
administration to have them ar
rested. The FSM was wholly
against any disciplinary proceed
ings by the University before the
court proceedings took place."
When the administration re
vealed the disciplinary measures it
had taken, however, the FSM be
came more decisive. "I think this
time there will be some action
taken," Goldberg said. "I'm not
sure what yet, but if there isn't
action taken this time, it just
proves the administration's theory
that the FSM is finished."
Little HUAC
Goldberg leveled many criti
cisms at the manner in which the
faculty committee handled his
case. "In fact the committee was
like a little HUCA—House Un-1
1

American Activities Committee.
We didn't even have a chance to
testify because if we testified they
would use this evidence against
us in the court. We weren't given
the right to prepare with counsel
—they wanted to get it over with
; in a hurry so they could get the
j sentences out before the Regent's
meeting. The person who brought
the charges against us in one case
wasn't known (until later)." In
his opinion, Goldberg was given
a heavier sentence than the others,
"because I was a politically active
person, and this is a good way to
get rid of a person who's been
agitating on the Berkeley cam
pus."
Mi'. Goldberg was unsure about
his future plans. "I really haven't
thought too much ahead now
about what I'm going to do. I
think I'd like to go to law school,
but I don't know where. It will
probably be impossible for me to
get a teaching credential in this
state. This was probably one of
the University's purposes in mov
ing on me, and I think they did a
very good .job."
Mi-. Goldberg ended the inter
view by explaining his concept of
the ideal university. "The ideal
university is, to me, a place where
you go to study academically;
you know, you have your classes.
But when you leave the class
room, and if you're not in any
way violating time, place or man
ner—in other words, if you're not
interrupting classes by a speech
or throwing paint on buildings,
then any type of political discus
sion and any type of political ac
tivity should be allowed without
penalty to the student.
"I think if they want to pen
alize a student, the university can
bring charges against them in the
courts, but I don't think they
should jeopardize a student for
discussing absolutely any issue or
planning absolutely any po
litical activity on campus as
long as that discussion and ac
tivity planning in no way hurts
class activity. For example, 1
think it would be wrong to have
the microphone sit right next to a
classroom blasting out during the
noon rally. But in the plaza area
I don't see how it hurts anything.
It's an opportunity to discuss the
very sick society we live in."
On Wednesday of last week !
the University of California an

it had taken against four stu
dents involved in the so-called
"dirty word" demonstrations on
campus. Art Goldberg, a graduate |
student in education was dismiss

j were given limited suspensions.
Four days later, on Sunday

events leading to his dismissal.
In the meantime the FSM, dor

it had taken against four stu

campus. Art Goldberg, a graduate |
student in education was dismiss
ed from the University. The others

j were given limited suspensions.
Four days later, on Sunday
' morning, he gave an exclusive in
! terview in which he discussed the
events leading to his dismissal.
In the meantime the FSM, dor

rallied and telegramed the Uni

state the four students. The FSM
I reportedly was considering a pro
test if their demands were not
I met. On the surface, the renewed
activity resembled that of last fall.
But University President Clark
Kerr claimed the issues were ac
tually quite different. "1 do not
see and cannot visualize the stu
dents on campus and a number of

non-students off campus consider
ing the defense of obscenity as
they did civil liberties last fall."
Obscenity
Goldberg admitted student sup
port for the FSM on the new issue
might not be as great as it was in
the past, "Because," lie said, "ob
scenity is considered a bad is
use; it's much more unpopular."
But Ik 1 did not share Kerr's opin
ion that the basic issues had
changed. "1 think the issues are
interrelated. Both show the Uni
versity's power to crack down on
us arbitrarily, and. with the help
of the mass media, to win support
for the crackdown. The gains
made last semester were not con
stitutional gains. They were just

Fraternity Muttons
Goldberg pointed out that at.
i the same time John Thompson j
was arrested for putting up a
! sign the size of half a sheet of
notebook paper, fraternities were
selling buttons with 'I like pussy'
and other, more pointed expres
sions on them. No charges were
brought against the fraternities.
"I thought it was unfair," he
said. "So I gave my speech on
that and also on ihe hypocrisy of
society's mores. I asked why
the word 'nigger' isn't consideded
obscene while the four-letter word
meaning sexual intercourse is. I
couldn't understand why society
arbitrarily had decided what is
obscene and what isn't. During the
course of the discussion I used the
word, and it caused the hall to
crumble."
"I don't quite understand this
guarantee of our morality," he
continued. "Usually it's the same
people who try to guarantee our
morality that supposedly have
those wild middle-class parties in
the suburbs."
According to Mr. Goldberg, the
development of the obscenity con
troversy caught the FSM "in a
state of flux. Many of the people
that were originally on the steer
ing committee were no longer on
it; some weren't even in town . . .
the students were tired after last
semester. They wanted to relax,
they wanted to get away from
here. There was no long-term
commitment."
As a result, the FSM did not
officially support Thompson and
his friends in the beginning. "It
just said that the students had a
right to discuss these things and
it thought it was wrong for the
administration to have them ar
rested. The FSM was wholly
against any disciplinary proceed
ings by the University before the
court proceedings took place."
When the administration re
vealed the disciplinary measures it
had taken, however, the FSM be
came more decisive. "I think this
time there will be some action
taken," Goldberg said. "I'm not
sure what yet, but if there isn't
action taken this time, it just
proves the administration's theory
that the FSM is finished."
Little HUAC
Goldberg leveled many criti
cisms at the manner in which the
faculty committee handled his
case. "In fact the committee was
like a little HUCA—House Un-1
1

American Activities Committee.
We didn't even have a chance to
testify because if we testified they
would use this evidence against
us in the court. We weren't given
the right to prepare with counsel
—they wanted to get it over with
; in a hurry so they could get the
j sentences out before the Regent's
meeting. The person who brought
the charges against us in one case
wasn't known (until later)." In
his opinion, Goldberg was given
a heavier sentence than the others,
"because I was a politically active
person, and this is a good way to
get rid of a person who's been
agitating on the Berkeley cam
pus."
Mi'. Goldberg was unsure about
his future plans. "I really haven't
thought too much ahead now
about what I'm going to do. I
think I'd like to go to law school,
but I don't know where. It will
probably be impossible for me to
get a teaching credential in this
state. This was probably one of
the University's purposes in mov
ing on me, and I think they did a
very good .job."
Mi-. Goldberg ended the inter
view by explaining his concept of
the ideal university. "The ideal
university is, to me, a place where
you go to study academically;
you know, you have your classes.
But when you leave the class
room, and if you're not in any
way violating time, place or man
ner—in other words, if you're not
interrupting classes by a speech
or throwing paint on buildings,
then any type of political discus
sion and any type of political ac
tivity should be allowed without
penalty to the student.
"I think if they want to pen
alize a student, the university can
bring charges against them in the
courts, but I don't think they
should jeopardize a student for
discussing absolutely any issue or
planning absolutely any po
litical activity on campus as

tivity planning in no way hurts
class activity. For example, 1

| fight over a better issue.
"Rut you don't always choose
your issues. Spider magazine was
banned, and the FSM said it
i wanted to wait a little while. But j
j we just can't continue to wait be-j
' cause the administration is slowly 1
whittling away, gaining more and !
j more restrictions, until we will j
end up worse than we were last
■ semester."
Fraternity Muttons
Goldberg pointed out that at.
i the same time John Thompson j
was arrested for putting up a
! sign the size of half a sheet of
notebook paper, fraternities were
selling buttons with 'I like pussy'
and other, more pointed expres
sions on them. No charges were
brought against the fraternities.
"I thought it was unfair," he
said. "So I gave my speech on
that and also on ihe hypocrisy of
society's mores. I asked why
the word 'nigger' isn't consideded
obscene while the four-letter word
meaning sexual intercourse is. I
couldn't understand why society
arbitrarily had decided what is
obscene and what isn't. During the
course of the discussion I used the
word, and it caused the hall to
crumble."
"I don't quite understand this
guarantee of our morality," he
continued. "Usually it's the same
people who try to guarantee our
morality that supposedly have
those wild middle-class parties in
the suburbs."
According to Mr. Goldberg, the
development of the obscenity con
troversy caught the FSM "in a
state of flux. Many of the people
that were originally on the steer
ing committee were no longer on
it; some weren't even in town . . .
the students were tired after last
semester. They wanted to relax,
they wanted to get away from
here. There was no long-term
commitment."
As a result, the FSM did not
officially support Thompson and
his friends in the beginning. "It
just said that the students had a
right to discuss these things and
it thought it was wrong for the
administration to have them ar
rested. The FSM was wholly
against any disciplinary proceed
ings by the University before the
court proceedings took place."
When the administration re
vealed the disciplinary measures it
had taken, however, the FSM be
came more decisive. "I think this
time there will be some action
taken," Goldberg said. "I'm not
sure what yet, but if there isn't
action taken this time, it just
proves the administration's theory
that the FSM is finished."
Little HUAC
Goldberg leveled many criti
cisms at the manner in which the
faculty committee handled his
case. "In fact the committee was
like a little HUCA—House Un-1
1

American Activities Committee.
We didn't even have a chance to
testify because if we testified they
would use this evidence against
us in the court. We weren't given
the right to prepare with counsel
—they wanted to get it over with
; in a hurry so they could get the
j sentences out before the Regent's
meeting. The person who brought
the charges against us in one case
wasn't known (until later)." In
his opinion, Goldberg was given
a heavier sentence than the others,
"because I was a politically active
person, and this is a good way to
get rid of a person who's been
agitating on the Berkeley cam
pus."
Mi'. Goldberg was unsure about
his future plans. "I really haven't
thought too much ahead now
about what I'm going to do. I
think I'd like to go to law school,
but I don't know where. It will
probably be impossible for me to
get a teaching credential in this
state. This was probably one of
the University's purposes in mov
ing on me, and I think they did a
very good .job."
Mi-. Goldberg ended the inter
view by explaining his concept of
the ideal university. "The ideal
university is, to me, a place where
you go to study academically;
you know, you have your classes.
But when you leave the class
room, and if you're not in any
way violating time, place or man
ner—in other words, if you're not
interrupting classes by a speech
or throwing paint on buildings,
then any type of political discus
sion and any type of political ac
tivity should be allowed without
penalty to the student.
"I think if they want to pen
alize a student, the university can
bring charges against them in the
courts, but I don't think they
should jeopardize a student for
discussing absolutely any issue or
planning absolutely any po
litical activity on campus as
long as that discussion and ac
tivity planning in no way hurts
class activity. For example, 1
think it would be wrong to have
the microphone sit right next to a
classroom blasting out during the
noon rally. But in the plaza area
I don't see how it hurts anything.
It's an opportunity to discuss the
very sick society we live in."
On Wednesday of last week !
the University of California an
nounced the disciplinary action]
it had taken against four stu
dents involved in the so-called
"dirty word" demonstrations on
campus. Art Goldberg, a graduate |
student in education was dismiss
ed from the University. The others

j were given limited suspensions.
Four days later, on Sunday
' morning, he gave an exclusive in
! terview in which he discussed the
events leading to his dismissal.
In the meantime the FSM, dor
! mailt since semester break, had
rallied and telegramed the Uni
versity Regents that they had un
til Wednesday the 28th to rein

state the four students. The FSM
I reportedly was considering a pro
test if their demands were not
I met. On the surface, the renewed
activity resembled that of last fall.
But University President Clark
Kerr claimed the issues were ac
tually quite different. "1 do not
see and cannot visualize the stu
dents on campus and a number of

non-students off campus consider
ing the defense of obscenity as
they did civil liberties last fall."
Obscenity
Goldberg admitted student sup
port for the FSM on the new issue
might not be as great as it was in
the past, "Because," lie said, "ob
scenity is considered a bad is
use; it's much more unpopular."
But Ik 1 did not share Kerr's opin
ion that the basic issues had
changed. "1 think the issues are
interrelated. Both show the Uni
versity's power to crack down on
us arbitrarily, and. with the help
of the mass media, to win support
for the crackdown. The gains
made last semester were not con
stitutional gains. They were just
gifts from above, the way aristo
crats might give serfs more free
dom. The serfs, though, have no
way to make sure the aristocrats
won't take it away again without
notice . . . It's a battle to guaran
tee students rights, so they don't
always have to have mass dem
onstrations to protect other stu
dents; so that they can have cer
tain basic rights and certain com

mittee rights to prevent the uni
versily from handling them arbi
trarily."
The question arose whether con-.
sideling the tenuous treaty be-j
tween the FSM and the adminis- j
(ration at the time it was wise j
to give the speech that led to his
dismissal. "It wasn't a question of
: being wise or unwise,'' Goldberg
said. "The situation existed and
! something had to be done. It's

troversy put the FSM in a bid
