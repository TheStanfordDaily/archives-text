# EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
## Goldberg Recalls 'Filthy Speech' Controversy 
### ALBERT STATON 
On Wednesday of last week !
the University of California an
nounced the disciplinary action]
it had taken against four stu
dents involved in the so-called
"dirty word" demonstrations on
campus. Art Goldberg, a graduate |
student in education was dismiss
ed from the University. The others

j were given limited suspensions.
Four days later, on Sunday
' morning, he gave an exclusive in
! terview in which he discussed the
events leading to his dismissal.
In the meantime the FSM, dor
! mailt since semester break, had
rallied and telegramed the Uni
versity Regents that they had un
til Wednesday the 28th to rein

state the four students. The FSM
I reportedly was considering a pro
test if their demands were not
I met. On the surface, the renewed
activity resembled that of last fall.
But University President Clark
Kerr claimed the issues were ac
tually quite different. "1 do not
see and cannot visualize the stu
dents on campus and a number of

non-students off campus consider
ing the defense of obscenity as
they did civil liberties last fall."
Obscenity
Goldberg admitted student sup
port for the FSM on the new issue
might not be as great as it was in
the past, "Because," lie said, "ob
scenity is considered a bad is
use; it's much more unpopular."
But Ik 1 did not share Kerr's opin
ion that the basic issues had
changed. "1 think the issues are
interrelated. Both show the Uni
versity's power to crack down on
us arbitrarily, and. with the help
of the mass media, to win support
for the crackdown. The gains
made last semester were not con
stitutional gains. They were just
gifts from above, the way aristo
crats might give serfs more free
dom. The serfs, though, have no
way to make sure the aristocrats
won't take it away again without
notice . . . It's a battle to guaran
tee students rights, so they don't
always have to have mass dem
onstrations to protect other stu
dents; so that they can have cer
tain basic rights and certain com

mittee rights to prevent the uni
versily from handling them arbi
trarily."
The question arose whether con-.
sideling the tenuous treaty be-j
tween the FSM and the adminis- j
(ration at the time it was wise j
to give the speech that led to his
dismissal. "It wasn't a question of
: being wise or unwise,'' Goldberg
said. "The situation existed and
! something had to be done. It's
been said that the obscenity con
troversy put the FSM in a bid
| fight over a better issue.
"Rut you don't always choose
your issues. Spider magazine was
banned, and the FSM said it
i wanted to wait a little while. But j
j we just can't continue to wait be-j
' cause the administration is slowly 1
whittling away, gaining more and !
j more restrictions, until we will j
end up worse than we were last
■ semester."
Fraternity Muttons
Goldberg pointed out that at.
i the same time John Thompson j
was arrested for putting up a
! sign the size of half a sheet of
