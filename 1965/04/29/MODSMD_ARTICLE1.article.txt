• Senate Leaders Dispute Poll Tax Issue
WASHINGTON Senate leaders sought yesterday a compromise;
course to settle a dispute over a provision in the Negro voting rights
bill that would outlaw poll taxes.
Sen. Jacob K. Javits, R-N.Y., rejected the leadership move and in- _
sisted Congress should flatly ban poll taxes as a voting requirement
in state and local elections.
President Johnson, the Senate's Republican and Democratic lead-'
ers, and Atty. Gen. Nicholas kat/.enbach all have said the ban would!
create a constitutional problem.
When Congress moved to eliminate poll taxes in federal elections,,
it did so through a constitutional amendment, not with a statute.
