# Freedom Topic Of Discussions
## 
### 
Dr. Christian Bay, a political lib
eral, will initiate a series of lec
ture-discussions on "Freedom and
Responsibility" today at 4:15 in
room 275 of Tresidder.
The purpose of the new series
is threefold: (1Â» to point out some
of the differences between various
philosophical and political under
standings of the term freedom;
(2) to get beyond an understand
ing of freedom as license and see
what the companion term respon
sibility would be from each of the
perspectives which will be pre
sented; and (3) to raise the ques
tion of the personal and social
implications which follow these
various interpretations.
The series will operate in the
form of a lecture, a brief critique
by a faculty member, and then
open discussion from the floor.
This series is co sponsored by
The Political Union and the Grad
uate Coordinating Committee.
