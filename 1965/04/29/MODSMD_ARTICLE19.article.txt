# INSIDE STORY
## Sports, Frats, Apathy 
### HUGH WEST 
Although athletics al Stanford
: never seem to cease, the rest of
1 the University is on the quarter
system, including ihe intrepid
DAILY. Therefore, it is Ihe duly
of each sports reporter to visit the
| premises of iho organization at
the beginning of each quarter to
i be assigned his beat.
To this ritual this quarter, how
| ever, was added 1 he phenomenon
known as fraternity rush, which
! has more than its share of con
sequences for the fledging report*
| er. In the first place, the mara
thon of parties and open houses
J prevents the rising journalist
I from seeing the inside of the
i DAILY'S spanklingly sanitary
| quarters during tho first week of
I the quarter.
So, fresh from a weekend of
sleep, 1 decided to sneak a first
quick look at ihe sports desk for
this quarter to see what sports
editor Roger Magnuson had in
store for mo.
Magnuson was there to greet
me at tho desk, but: at first he
: did not acknowledge me. He was
i staring at the ceiling, a puckish
J grin on his face, obviously plan
: ning one of his unsportmanlike
j columns designed to undermine
| whatever is on the editorial page.
He chortled, and began to write
something down. 1 cleared my
throat. "You went Beta Chi, didn't
you," Rog commented, still writ
ing.

I swelled with pride. "Yeah." 1
answered, thrusting my hand me
chanically in his direction to be
pumped.
"You're covering crew." He
chortled, ambivalently.
I was not sure of any intended
connection between these prelim
inary comments, but I began to
suspect method in his madness.
"For God's sake," 1 pouted,
"first soccer, then gymnastics,
then crew. What are you guys tey
ing to do to me, prepare me for
a job with Spoils Illustrated? I'll
end up doing ski fashions and
'enigma articles' for that God
awful magazine. I can see it now:
'Will Marriage Ruin the Stan
ford Crew?' "
"West," explained Roger mag
nanimously, "you've got to learn
that you're no longer in high
school. You're at a University now
- a free University and you've
got to specialize. Now Oxford,
Cambridge, Rhodes Scholars, Beta
Chi, crew they all will go to
gether, don't you think?"
1 stammered, "B-B-But, B-Bill
B-Bradley, b-basketball."
"The exception that proves the
rule," Magnuson declared. I could
not dispute his position, tor never
in my life have I been able to
figure out what that phrase
means.
So I resigned myself to my fate,
reasoning that writing for Sports
Illustrated could not be that bad.
"This is ging to be the pits, Rog,"
I sulked.
"What was that?" He looked
stallled.
I shouted. "I'm not going to like
this beat."
No, No," he corrected me,
"what was that about ditches or
underarms or whatever ii was?"
"The pits," 1 replied.
"Yes, 'the Pits'- there just may
be some Lacrosse games to cov
er."
"Bitchin'!"
"Bitchin'?"
"Yeah, bitchin'."
"You know, you may get a
chance to cover baseball too "
