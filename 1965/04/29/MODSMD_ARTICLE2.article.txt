# Dempster Dumpsters Frustrating Residents
## 
### MARSHA COOK 
There has been a crack in Stan
ford's famed screen on apathy.
Escondido Village has actually
tried to stop an administrative
directive concerning Dempster
Dumpsters, which of course will
be installed anyway.
If the interested student fights
the cloud of ambivalence for a
moment to inquire as to exactly
what are these Dempster Dump
sters ho will find that they are
mechanical garbage disposal
units.
Increment 1 in the Village spear
headed a campaign last Decem
ber to have them removed. They
were "abominably ugly, fit only
for industrial use, unsafe, and un
healthy." People joined the cause
enthusiastically.
After petitions and council
meetings, the Dumpsters were
placed on a one month trial period,
from March 24 to April 21.
Questionnaires will be returned
Friday which will determine the
fate of these disposal units.
Unfortunately, the original

vigor has died from the campaign.
Residents, most of whom are
transitory, are willing to part
with ihcir aesthetic values and
convictions and vote the Dump
sters in without a battle. The rea
son is that they are convenient,
if nothing else.
The interested student might
want to see these "monsters" in
action. They are everywhere - in
back of all dormitories, eating
clubs, the union, the bookstore,
and just recently in unit 3 of the
Village.
But in all these places they are
conveniently hidden from view,
and that is a great factor in their
acceptance. But their heavy lids
are not a safety factor for chil
dren.
