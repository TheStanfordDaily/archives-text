# Existentialism in the Classroom
## 
### PRESTON COVEY (Third in a Series 
As an exemplary case, the element of irony in
the common classroom "encounter" with existen
tialism is especially a propos because the indif
ference to the encounter at hand is diametrically
opposed to the very possibility of encounter, to the
very possibility of education.
Indifference stands on the same side as accumu
lation as opposed to appropriation, as the knowing
which is having as opposed to the knowing which
is becoming. The matter-of-fact knowledge that a
boy just fell out of the sky into the sea is Indif
ferent to the full and actual significance of the
event.
The element of irony in the classroom "encount
er" with existentialism consists in the extent to
which existentialism consists in the extent to
says it is, rather than to be what is pointed to,
subsequently to be lived and thereby understood
by each for himself. The greatest irony of all is
the acquisition of the idea of subjective truth as
an objective matter-of-fact proposition of "a par
ticular" philosophy, namely existentialism.
The discrepancy between my articulate grasp <»112
subjective truth and what actually lies within truth
qua lived truth is as great as the discrepancy be
tween the fall of Icarus as an observed fact and
what actually lies within the event. Brughel's land
scape graphically illustrates by analogy my inner
poverty as I look upon existential truth and yet
remain indifferent to what lies within.
Culture, "philosophy," "education" indulge us
excessively in Gerede, "the kind of talk which
hears, i.e. understands what is said, and passes on
(says on) what has been learned by hearing with
out 'getting to bottom* of what the talk is about,"
(M. King, Heidegger's Pholosophy, p 118) and
Gesehreibe, "a bottomless scribbling which is not
so much a 'hear-say' as a 'read-say,' feeding itself •
on what has already been written and passing it on
as a supposed contribution toward keeping the dis
closedness of world open." (King. p. 118).
In the symposium "Behaviorism and Phenome
nology" Sigmund Koch's paper levels a highly
polemical attack against the "obscurantism" and

dubitable worth of existentialism (including "phe
nomenology"), though he is, in his words, "limited
by very slight contact with existentialist litera
tures," (T. Warm, ed., Behaviorism and Phenome
nology, p. 37). To back up his position Dr. Koch
quotes Merleau-Ponty for authority on the basis
of the latter's acceptance among existentialists
themselves "as one of the most technically com
petent philosophers among the French existential
ists":
What is phenomenology? It may seem strange
that this question lias still to he asked haJf a cen
tury after the works of Husserl. Tlx' fact re
mains that it has by no means been answered.
(Wann. p. 3(5).
This practice demonstrates the grossest indif
ference to authentic philosophy. The point is, of
course, that one cannot evaluate the status of
phenomenology as if it were an objective situation
upon the basis of hear-say (Gerede) or "read-say"
(Ciescreide). One cannot evaluate it even by read
ing phenomenology. One cannot in fact evaluate
it without being a phenomenologist. without "see
ing" for himself.
However, we students of education, we students
of existentialism, wo students of philosophy, are
only too often guilty of indulging in "just talk,"
enough so as to justify such laments as Koch's:
I have tended to note with true dismay that stu
dents with existentialist identifications (and one
sees not a few these days), though often sensitive
people with the best possible impulses, seem pos
sessed of the same habit of thought and com
munication that I have tried to reconstruct re
Sartre [a fluidity of discourse, a tendency to be
only partially and variably constrained by the
terms of posed problems, a love of paradox and
of cryptic yet somehow pregnant slogans].
They simply are off in some realm of epigram
matic nuance, of ardent association chasing . . .
They do not seem to think like scientists, how
ever Dionysian one's concept thereof, nor do
they, in my estimation, think like effective or
able humanists. I think this unfortunate: they
are often talented young men who bold values
desperately needed . . . (Wann, p. 37).
