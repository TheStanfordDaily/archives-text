## I Dreamt I Was Patriotic In My Bircherform Bra 
### 
Editor, Tin* Daily:
I had the neatest dream the
other night.
1 dreamed I walked thru the
plaza and saw a huge demonstra
tion. The first thing I saw was a
big American flag, the backdrop
for a speaker's rostrum. There
were two large signs: "Support
American Imperialism; May the
Sun Never Set on the Stars and
Stripes," and "Take Up the White
Man's Burden: Asia for the Asi
atics Is a Communist Plot."
A smaller sign said, "It is our
sacred duty to defend others
against Communism, even if they
don't want to be defended against
Communism." Someone in the
audience shouted, "Would you
want Ho Chi Minh to marry your
sister?" I thought to myself:
"Those sure are catchy slogans.
Then began the program. The
first speaker, a Mr. Henry, made
a very brief speech. He said, "Re
garding the people of Vietnam,
give them liberty, or give them
death." Everyone cheered. The
next speaker said, "We seek no
wider war; we just want to give
our pilots combat experience."
After the speakers, the pom pon
girls loci a couple of yells. They
were dressed, naturally, in red,
white and blue. They did two old
favorites: "Go get 'em Lyndon"
and "Hit 'em again, hit 'em again,
harder, harder." I was stirred. J
anxiously sought the boy hand
ing out little flags. 1 look mine
: and started waving it and running
j around.
Shucks, then 1 woke up.
j Dreams always end just when
they're getting good.

• More oil Islam
Editor, The Daily:
Allowing a false accusation to
remain unanswered is like allow
ing a thief to steal. Mr. Diament's
: letter in the April 271 h issue states
| that Islam, while proclaiming
j piety, love and peace, is a religion
that "spread . . . by wars of con
quest rather than by friendly per-1
| suasion."
He goes on to say that "Hunt
i ing and selling of African slaves
I has been a speciality of Arab
traders" thus implying Moslems
j and he saves no effort in throw
ing the blame on Islam for the
i Arab-Israeli conflict.
it is not very difficult to show
i that the above statements are at
best unqualified and mostly
wrong:
One the Koran states 'Thou
shall not promote thy religion by j
force." Islam has no missionary
system built into it, yet at present
there are nine Africans converting
to Islam for every one convert
j ing to Christianity and without
! force. The moguls who devastated
; the Moslems countries during tlie
| twelfth and thirteenth centuries
| became themselves Moslems after
I their conquest.
Two — Islam, while intolerant
(about paganism teaches Moslems
] to respect Christians and Jews for
their faiths and demands no inter
ference with their religious prac
tices in Moslem countries. Jewish
people have been known for cen
turies to live well and in peace
among the Moslems in Arab as i
well as non-Arab countries.
Israel and the Arab conflict j
was created by Zionists who used j
the Jewish faith to promote their!
j own political ambitions and there- i
; by caused the plighi of one million i
I refugees outside their country. It j

is a political rather than a relig
ious conflict.
Three Slavery is prohibited by
Islam. While it is true that Arab
traders did handle the buying and
selling of slaves, many of these
traders were Christian Arabs and
Jewish Arabs. Business has often
induced immorality among dif
ferent men.
It is unfortunate to see that
people still use religion to down
grade others .One might expect
more respect towards the same
one God.

• Fraternity Reforms
Editor, The Daily:
"Long established practices of
conservative institutions'- such
as fraternity rush and initiation
can be questioned by individuals
but only changed by group dissat
isfaction. Roily and Norm's as
sertion that "20,000 fraternity
brothers can't be wrong" is not
gospel.
Due to alumni financial sup
port of fraternities, there is little
possibility of a draw system in the
near future. But fraternity men
should attempt to incorporate the
advantages of such a system into•,
their living groups.
Fraternities should officially
! abolish i ho one-ding system. Many
I fraternities already simply ac
| cept ru.shoes by consensus until
their quota is reached rather than
vote on every freshman. A fresh
man's desire to bo in the house
should be considered.
Once accepted, the pledge class}
should realize its power, and act j
! as a bloc to influence their own
j initiation procedures. The threat;
of a mass depledging will always
. be heeded by the act ivies.
Psychological devices such as;
| Hell Weeks and non-functional j
i pledge/active distinctions have no;
I place in Stanford fraternities. Fra-;
. ternity men should discuss and:
j evaluate their rituals.
In rush as well as during the!
rest of the year, fraternities!
should self-consciously attempt to;
j encourage individualism and di
i versity. An homogeneous group is
; only good insofar as it discourages
small cliques from forming. It is
bad if it results in pressure to con-,
form.
Such changes might weaken
fraternities as emotional refer
ence points. Perhaps fraternity
men would compensate for this by
participating more fully in aca
demic programs and extracurricu
lar activities.
I If fraternities do not take ac-I
tivc steps to improve themselves,
t hoy may suffer in the near fu
ture when the physical facilities
of the independent houses are
improved. The present lack of a j
satisfactory option gives fra
ternities a false sense of secur
ity.
