# MORE VARIETY, CONTROL
## Workshop Much Improved 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
The Workshop, oui again today, may be a dis
appointment to those looking for further lurid talcs
of the tribulations of identity-seeking Stanford
students.
It will not disappoint those who agree with
Workshop editor Henry Alley that "the writer at
■ Stanford is not simply satisfied with the voicing of
his ideas ... he tries to cast his thoughts in the
proper form whether metered lines or dramatic
dialogue so that there is no distance between
writing and personality."
Distance or not, it is certainly a greater evenness
j of style and control of form thai make the two
short stories in 1 his issue probably the best and
the most objective yet to appear in I he Workshop.
Iti "The Town That Learned to Love." by Joe
Max shark, the world of a shcllshocked war veteran
is contrasted to that of a group of young people
who call him "the Mumbler" and amuse themselves
by planning an imaginary soap opera around him.
But how docs one react to such a character when
lie fails to follow the script? llhcre is a slight prob
lem with confusion of tense in following the old
man's first Ihoughts but there is also a good
I moment, of man-with-the-golden-arm suspense; in
general, the story raises some interesting questions
about sympathy and communication.
I Mitchell Miller's "Getting On" describes a scene
( between n compulsive racetrack-betler and his
alcoholic wife, whose marriage seems to be held

together as haphazardly and precariously as the
pieces of plaster in their ceiling; it effectively con
veys the weariness and staleness of their day-to
day existence.
The three poems are of more varied quality.
"Pastoral Reflection," a sort of sustained haiku by
Bruce Block, is a nice piece of description; parts
of his other poem strike more deeply but it is
hard to say how since the meaning as a whole is
somewhat obscure.
The effort to fit form to meaning in the third
poem, Patt McDermid's "Upon Reading a Letter
From a Girl in China," is perhaps overdone. H
leaves the impression of a self-conscious river soul
fully sighing metaphors as ii slips softly by. One
cannot be sure what is behind such lines as "the
brown-eyed flood following far behind the blue
green, Prelude that wet the rough paper of God's
eyes."
On the whole, however, the third issue shows
greater variety and higher critical standards, which
may reflect the Workshop's decision to evaluate
an<i comment on each piece of work submitted, sug
gesting possible further rev ision.
No longer fearful of a dearth of creative writers
about K'<» pages of copy was submitted for this
issue the journal has, as Alley comments in his
editorial, "become a platform for the rehearsing as
well as the delivery of the writer's speeches." Such
an effort deserves applause and encouragement
for stimulating the growth of the talent which
most contributors clearly have.

poem, Patt McDermid's "Upon Reading a Letter
