# Storm And Strife Daunt Doll Houses

"Bang!" popped the gun of the Ad
ministration. "Splat!" went Stanford
sororities, mortally wounded "Oh, my
goodness," chorused the surprised stu
dents at the death of the fifty-year old
Greek monument to campus life
It was twenty years ago that the
Trustees and the President of the Uni
versity, Donald B. Tresidder, found the
"sorority system was not suitable to
our campus" and abruptly put an end to
the dollies' houses on campus.
The history of the events behind their
decision describe a university in the
process of becoming "great."
Two sororities were established on
campus one year after the university's
founding in 1891. Officials welcomed
them with open arms, viewing them as a
solution to the housing shortage on
campus. In fact, approval was almost un
animous not to mention inspiring, for the

new "fraternal" organizations.
University Approval
David Starr Jordon, first university
president, stated "that the chapter
houses added much to the appearance of
the campus and have constituted an im
portant factor in Stanford social life."
The Daily Palo Alto, ancestor to the
present Daily, observed that the row of
sorority and fraternity houses is "now
one of the chief objects of interest to
visitors at the university because of
the different styles of architecture and
the picturesque effect that the new
homes make."
Not to be left out in the rush, a Palo
Alto newspaper complimented the two
Stanford sororities on the friendliness
they showed in welcoming a third so
rority on campus.
But even in 1908 there were traces of
a liberal, independent spirit on campus.
During that year the freshman girls,
seeing how rush was effecting their

friends who were not sure of being
pledged to the house of their choice,
voted to refuse all bids. The revolt, alas,
was unsuccessful as the girls reversed
their decisions the night bids were issued.
The fatal conflict between row girls
and dorm girls began in 1933 when the
quota on women enrollment was lifted
and femmes fatales flooded the campus,
all potential sisters.
Enrollment Problem
Before this time, women's enrollment
had been limited to 500, and the nine
Greek houses on campus, termed by one
newspaper as "the most exclusive in
the Panhellenic," were forced to ac
tively solicit members.
In the late thirties, sheer arithmetic
emphasized what had only been lurk
ing in the background before. The num
ber of women students had been steadily
increasing on campus until it approached
1500. But due to a quota system began in

'33 by the administration, each sorority
membership was limited to the number
of girls who could live in a house ap
proximately thirty. Now able to bid only
one-sixth of the women students, the
sororities emphasized the social aristoc
rary.
Headaches began for the administra
tion as more daughters of sorority alum
nae than the sororities could accomodate
became Stanford women. Pressure was
applied by the mothers to get their
protege pledged, and donations to the
university were in peril.
Student Complaints
Students, especially women, had more
than one complaint, however. Because
the sororities attracted the women lead
ers on campus, organizations were ham
pered by a house monopoly of power
or, worse yet, a lack of good leadership
resulting from non-competitive agree
ments within the houses.
