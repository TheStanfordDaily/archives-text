# He-Cat Queen?
## 
### HOLLY RUST 
Leading nominee for the
title of Con Home Queen is
10. Q. Kimball.
E.Q. is a Aery unusual
queen candidate. In the first
place, she is a he. And in the
second, he is a cat.
But E.Q. is more than a cat.
He is a psychotic cat. Hi s
short life has been full of
traumatic experiences.
In his childhood, lie had the
unfortunate luck to fall off
the third deck sun porch of
the Delta Chi house onto an
asphalt volleyball court. Un
like most cats, E.Q. decided
to assert his indivduality and
lit on his back rather than
his feet. After this shattering
experience, it is only iwuiral
that he would develop mental
problems.
But perhaps all tlicy really
needed to do was to warn E.Q.
about the consequences of
drinking in excess. It seems
that in a recent chugging' con
test, E.Q. came in a close
third.
EQ. is a beautiful gray and
black tiger with a perfect o(>
figure. His measurements

run 12-12*12, and his main
beauty spot is a gopher bite
behind his right ear. As a
night prowler, he is very
much in favor of the 11 e w
siH-ial regulations.
Jon Calhoun, E.Q.'s trusted
retainer, says that he is a
clean red-blooded type Ameri
can who loves children and
who would revere his parents
if he knew who they were.
..E.Q.'s one campaign prom- '
ise is that if elected, he'll
"show more hair than most
Stanford girls."
E.Q. has amassed a total of
3,150 votes. His nearest com
petitor is Fabulous Elo Sil
verstein, a secretary of the
Merry Marvel Marching: So
ciety, with 1,413 votes.
Wallaman alias Les Mar
tin, English TA, is leading the
field for Con Home King with
3,857 votes. In a close race
for second arc Larry Dough
arty, Graduate School of
Business, with 1,558 votes and
Dick Enersen, Chappie editor,
with 1,542 votes.
Today is the last <lay of
voting" and winners will he
crowned at the earival Friday
