# Letters Flying On Sigma Chi
## Senator Metcalf Expects National Repercussions to Suspension 
### 
Stanford students seeking to eliminate do facto discrimination
within Sigma Chi fraternity have ' acted in good faith, with com
mendable motives, and with a sincere desire to work out this prob
lem within the fraternity. according to University President Wal
lace Sterling.

Sterling's views were stated in*
answer to a letter from National!
Fraternity President Harry V.
Wade of Indianapolis, who de-1
scribed the attitude of the Stan
ford chapter as "supercilious."
In response to numerous in- \
qnines from other institutions,
University Relations Director Lyle
M. Nelson has sent a four-page
letter to the presidents of 135 col
leges and universities with Sigma
Clii chapters noting thai the Stan-1
ford students' action has been
"wholly voluntary," in accord with j
a 1957 trustee resolution opposing j
discriminatory clauses and prac- j
tices.
The letter notes that the na-i
tional executive committee's one-j
year suspension of the Stanford
chapter "was taken without a
hearing and without the local
group having any opportunity of
any kind to answer charges!
against them." Lawyers retained;
by the chapter say this violates
the fraternity's own constitutional
provisions.
April 2 Suspension
On Jan. 28. 1965. Wade stated in
writing that the national "has no
grounds" for suspending the!
Stanford chapter. On Feb. 4. the
chapter notified Wade that it had
"long been concerned over the de
facto discriminatory policy" of|
Sigma Chi and announced its in
tention to rush on a nondiscrimi-i
natory basis, in accord with the j
fraternity's constitution.
The Stanford chapter extended
bids on a nondiscriminatory basis
and pledged a Negro student April
3. One week later, it received a j
letter from Wade announcing the
temporary suspension of its chap
ter by the national executive com
mittee April 2.
.
National Significant*'
"We sincerely believe that the
issue (of de facto discrimination) j
has more than local significance," j
Nelson's letter observes. Sen. Lee'
Met calf (D-Mont.i. a chapter alum
nus, has noted that the executive;
committee's action "may en
danger Sigma Chi on every cam
pus in America." His concern isj
based upon provisions of Title VI of ;

the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which
bars federal support to any in
stitution which practices or sup
ports racial discrimination. Sigma
Chi has no racial clause in its con
stitution. but does have a so
called social acceptability clause
that no chapter propose anyone
"who for any reason is likely to bo
considered personally unaccept
able as a brother by any chapter
or any member anywhere."
Institutions which already have
requested further information
from Stanford include Colorado,
Utah, Michigan, Michigan State,
Brown. Wisconsin, San Jose State,
Willamette, Whitman, Rip on.
Idaho, Cornell, Union, lowa, and
Cincinnati.
