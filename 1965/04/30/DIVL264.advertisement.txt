You'll obtain valuable junior management experience ... a fuller and richer
campus life .. . extra spending money ($4O per month during your junior
% lijl: and senior school years, and even more during Summer training) .. . and,
mk■ when you graduate, an Army Officer's commission as Second Lieutenant.
Then you'll normally spend two interesting years on active duty, often
IB!' * ' abroad with opportunities for travel.

opportunity. Ask him to describe this new short program in detail.

A message of importance to sophomore men
Sf you've got what ittakes
to be an Army Officer;
you may qualify for this new
on campus training program
A new Army ROTC program starts this
coming Summer for sophomore men who apply
prior to May 1-—only 3,000 applicants to be accepted
If you're a sophomore now attending one of the 247 colleges and universities that
offer Army Officer training—or you plan to transfer to one of these schools next
sc Fall—you may qualify for the new two-year Army ROTC program.
This new program—designed especially for college men who have not taken
Army ROTC during their first two years—will commence with six weeks of
field training this coming Summer, beginning June 14. Then you'll have
on-campus training during your junior year ... six additional weeks at camp
during the following Summer .. . and more on-campus training during your
senior year. Even flight training is offered at some schools.
ROTC training is really a process of learning to organize and direct others—
to be a leader. Consider how important this ability can be to you throughout life;
yet, to acquire it you will spend relatively little time in the ROTC classroom.
You'll obtain valuable junior management experience ... a fuller and richer
campus life .. . extra spending money ($4O per month during your junior
% lijl: and senior school years, and even more during Summer training) .. . and,
mk■ when you graduate, an Army Officer's commission as Second Lieutenant.
Then you'll normally spend two interesting years on active duty, often
IB!' * ' abroad with opportunities for travel.
Talk to the Professor of Military Science on your campus about this
opportunity. Ask him to describe this new short program in detail.
Or send in the coupon below for complete information. There's no obligation
involved, and you'll not be subjected to any "hard sell" recruiting effort.
The kind of men the Army wants can decide for themselves if this new
opportunity is right for them.
Mk ||k If you're good enough to be an Army Officer,
don't settle for less. Sign up now for Army ROTC.
