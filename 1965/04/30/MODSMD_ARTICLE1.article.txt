# Late-Date Social Regs Take Effect Today
## Fundamental Standard Still Governs Discipline 
### SUE HEILAN 
Tlu- wonderful clay litis come. Tonight Stanford upperclass i
women will begin to enjoy the heretofore unheard of freedom of j
staying-out till whenever they please.
However, as members of the Social Regs Committee have been !
patiently explaining for the past two weeks, the new regs still;

'entail certain requirements. When
a woman wishes to stay out until
6 a.m., she must indicate 6:00 on
the "special information" section
of her sign-out card as well as
using a yellow (actually orange)
tag.
Overnight Regulations
When a woman wishes to sign
out for an overnight, she must
have a definite address and tele
phone number. It is not possible
to blissfully indicate no more than
"San Gregorio Beach."
Nor is it possible to sign out
for an overnight because a fresh
man or sophomore dolly wants to
stay out for an all-night party.
If a r<>ed forgets to sign-out for
a late leave, she may call her resi
dence before midnight without in
curring a violation. Between mid
night and 2:30 she is still re
quested to call in to report her
failure to sign-out but she will be
given a violation.
A coed may sign-out from with
in her residence any time up to
her maximum sign-in time (2:30
for underelasswomen and 6:00 for
juniors and seniors.)
It is not possible to sign-out
for an overnight, after midnight.
Violations Still Prosecuted
All violations such as forgetting
to sign-out or sign-in and 1a t e
minutes and fundamental stan
dard violations (poor judgment,
intent to deceive, deliberate dis
regard, negligence or conduct un
becoming a Stanford woman) will
be prosecuted under the new regs.
The ability to sign-out for un
limited overnights does not ne
gate the concept of a residence
university, and cases of women
students who fail to honor the
residency concept will be treated
as violations of the fundamental
standard.
All questions concerning inter
pretation of the regs should be
directed to members of auxiliary
councils or the social regulations
commit tee.
