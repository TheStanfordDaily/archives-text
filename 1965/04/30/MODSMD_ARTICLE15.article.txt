# Baseball Team Seeks to Regain League Lead Against California
## 
### 
After leading the CIBA for the
first half of the season, Stanford
slipped into second place, 7 per
centage points behind Cal, thanks
to an 8-0 loss to the Bears Wednes
day at Berkeley.
Today and tomorrow Stanford
gets its third and fourth shots at
the Bears. In their first contest,
the Indians edged Cal, 2-1.
Because there are no "weak
sisters" in the league and since the
race is so close, no game should
assume more importance than an
other. But the fact that it is Cal
that Stanford is playing, and the
fact that Cal just two days ago
took over first place from the
Indians puts some extra luster on
an already important game.
Stanford now has six losses in
league play while Cal has only
five, so it is almost imperative
that someone give Cal more losses

while Stanford doesn't get any
more.
If the teams split and USC
sweeps two from UCLA mean
while, Stanford and Cal could be
looking at Trojan dust-trails.
Messersmith Masterly
Cal's sophomore pitcher, Andy
Messersmith, did his job superbly
Wednesday as he mesmerized In
dian hitters. Stanford sluggers
managed 5 hits and 12 strike-outs
for the day.
It was only the second time
since 1916 that someone has been
shutout in the Big Game baseball
series. The other time was last
year when Cal pitcher Bill Har
rison threw a blanket over the In
dians.
John Mason turned in a fine
performance against UCLA but
he didn't stay around too long
against Cal. Bear batters tallied 7
runs in the second inning, five off
Mason.
Three walks, a bunt-single by
third baseman Tom Cooper, an
error, and singles by Mike Taylor,
John Shaw, and Rick Brown did
the damage.
Terry Docken, Don Cook, and
Jim Blaschke held the Bears in
check from the third inning on.
One run and one hit is all that
Cal got after the second inning.
Threat Fizzles
Stanford looked like it was go
ing to mount an attack in the
eighth when two walks and an in
field single loaded the bases with
two outs. But Messersmith bore
down and struck out leftfielder
Steve Hovley on a 3-2 pitch.
Daro Quiring and Mike Con
nelly are the probable pitchers for
the two games this weekend. Fri

clay, Stanford will be at home.
Saturday, they travel to Berkeley.
Quiring, who has a 7 2 record,
pitched 2/3 of the second inning
Wednesday and will most likely
pitch Saturday. That leaves Mike
Connelly for Friday. Connelly has
a 3-2 record.
One bad note for the games is
Pete Middlekauff's finger injury.
He hurt it in the game against
Cal. Middlekauff is currently lead
ing the circuit in hitting and is
one of the better fielding first
basemen in the league.
A bright note, though, is the
hitting of catcher Bill Boles. Boles
took over for Jim Hibbs, who
had three stitches in his throw
ing hand. Boles is now hitting .304.
Hibbs is playing third base while
he is convalescing.
Tuesday afternoon the Indians
lost to San Jose ,9-4, at San Jose.
The loss was a non-league loss.
Frosli Play Cal
The Stanford Frosh will also
play two games with Cal this
weekend. They face the Cal Frosh
at Berkeley Friday and are at
home Saturday.
Presently, the Frosh are lead
ing the Bay Area Freshman Base
ball League with an 13-2 record.
The only competition that the
Frosh have is from Santa Clara.
Last night the Frosh beat Santa
Clara, 8-1.
Santa Clara has three losses
but they only have ten wins and
are two games behind Stanford.
