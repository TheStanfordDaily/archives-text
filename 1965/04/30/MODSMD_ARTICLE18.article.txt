# Injured Spikers Barely Favored in Big Meet
## 
### PETE KING 
Although riddled by injuries to
key men, Stanford is still a slight
favorite over Cal in the 70th Big
Meet at Berkeley Saturday. Field
events will begin at 1 p.m., with
running events at 1:30.
Stanford's freshmen are health
ier than the varsity, and rate the
role of solid favorites over the
Bear frosh. The frosh meet be
gins at 11:30 a.m. in Cal's stadium.
Four men who have scored a
large share of the Tribe points this
year will either be out of the meet
or much below par. Bob Mc-
Intyre, second-best man in the
broad jump and a member of the
unbeaten 440-yard relay team, is
definitely out with a pulled mus
cle. Chuck Smith, top conference
pole vaulter, has been injured for
four weeks, and yesterday was
gamely trying to get off the
ground on his approaches.
Schlicke, Deubner Hurt
Worse yet, Stanford's two best
distance runners are ailing. Paul
Schlicke, with bests of 4:05.7 in
the mile and 8:51.4 in the two
mile, Iws tendon trouble, and
could run only three laps in prac
tice Wednesday. The team's best
880 man, Dave Deubner, has a sore
arch and will be forced to run in
the two-mile, an unfamiliar event
for him.
In other strategic shuffles,
coach Payton Jordan will run
Schlicke and Kirkland in the mile,
and Harlan Andrews and Randy
Hyvonen in the 880.
Whereas the Tribe was figured
to walk away with the meet by as
much as 25 points, the margin
now looks more like 6-8 points.
Even in a sport of relative cer
tainty like track, that isn't a com
fortable edge, especially consider
ing that the Bears have dedi
cated the meet to coach Brutus
Hamilton, retiring after 33 years
at Cal.
Stanford will have to double
up several men in the meet, and
Cal's extra psychological edge
plus Indian weariness could re
sult in some upsets.
Cal Lacks Depth
But. Stanford has been a solid
team all year, whereas Cal has
lost seven of nine dual meets be

cause of a woeful lack of depth.
The Indians are favored in five of
the seven field events and should
win five other running events.
Sprinter Larry Questad is a
sure bet for a double win in the
100 and 220. The great Bear sprint
crew of Bob Brinkworth, Forest
Beaty, and Dave Archibald will
probably take the remaining
places, although Stanford's Eric
Frische could break through for
second in the 100.
Archibald is unbeatable in the
440, having clocked 46.4 this sea
son. He will undoubtedly double
in the 880, where he has run in
the low l:so's. Since he will run
on both relay teams, also, Cal up
set hopes depend on him. Stan
ford has no chance in the mile re
lay, and are underdogs in the 440,
but flawless Card baton passing
(as occurred in the USC meet)
can beat the Bear sprint team.
Cards Hurdles Favorites
The distance races are a toss
up, because of Stanford injuries.
However, the Cards are strong
favorites in both hurdles races,
with Greg Ford (14.4 and 37.5)
and Bud Walsh 115.0 and 37.7) en
tered. Rick Scherer (14.7) will run
after a two-week layoff from an
injury.
In the field events, Cal will
probably sweep the high jump.
That, however, may be it for the
Bears. Standford's Bruce Wilhelm
is the choice over Cal's Matt Dag
gett in the shot put, Bob Stoecker
has a nine-foot best-throw ad
vantage in the discus, Jim Eshel
man and Dick Barkley should go
1-2 in the pole vault, and Walsh is
favored in the broad jump. In ad
dition, George Porter, recently re
covered from an elbow inflamma
tion, is back in winning form in
the javelin.
Stanford will be aiming for its
fourth straight Big Meet win. The
Tribe won last year, 80-65, and
leads the series, 35-32.
