Savio, who withdrew from th e
FSM Tuesday, was one of the
first members of the FSU, along
with other FSM leaders.
"The campus must organize
itself," Savio counseled in a front
page letter in Wednesday's Daily
( alifornian. "1 am confident that
this community is entirely cap
able of organizing itself into the
powerful trade union form of
organization which this 'knowl
edge factory' calls for."

The "strike," not the "sit-in." •
will be the "more politically
sophisticated" weapon of the
FSU. Weinberg explained. The
new organization set. up a card
table to solicit members Wednes
day without a campus permit and
announced that it would not seek
a permit.
Savio explained in his letter to
the Daily Califoraian that he had
resigned from FSM because "I
should do a great disservice to
our community if I were to make
myself indispensable; and in re
cent weeks I have become very
nearly indispensable."
He said. "If the student rights
movement at Berkeley must in
evitably fail without my leader
ship, then it were best that it
fail."
