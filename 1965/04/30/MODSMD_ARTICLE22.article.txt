# 'Pickwick' Both Very Good And Pretty Terrible Show
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
The British musical "Pickwick" is like the girl in the nursery
j ihyme; when it's good, it's very good indeed; hut when it's bad, it's
! pretty terrible.
"Pickwick" is, really, more in the British music hall tradition than
in the musical comedy tradition to which Americans are accustomed.
The script, which is frequently dull and tedious, is filled with one
and two-line gags and puns, often with no relation whatsoever to the
scene in which they appear; lines like "all of you —to name hut a
I few" and "Britannia waives the rules" are common.
Plot Minor
The plot, which in "Pickwick" seems to be a minor consideration,
starts with Pickwick in prison, and most of the play is a flashback
showing the events leading up to and including the breach of promise
suit that brought him there. In the final scenes lie is back in the
prison where ihe play started, with just enough time to right all the
j wrongs before the final curtain.
' Fortunately, "Pickwick" is directed by Peter Coe—an old hand al
this sort of thing (he did "Oliver"), and he is able to display "Pick
wick's" considerable merits to advantage. First, Coe himself has a
fine sense of Dickensian London, and his staging of the numerous
crowd scenes is especially imaginative.
Second, Coe has Sean Kenny as his set designer- as he did in
"Oliver." Kenny's use of component rolling units moved by the actors
combined with flown pieces defies description; he even has real
ice for skating (which Pickwick falls through). When I saw "Oliver"
1 wrote in The Daily that its sets were the best I had ever seen.
! "Pickwick's" are better.
Cast .lust Itight
Third, Coe's cast is just right. Harry Secombe's fine tenor and care
: ful mannerisms provide a perfect Pickwick. But for me it was Anton
! Rodgers as the con-man Jingle and David Jones (another holdover
| from "Oliver" ) as Pickwick's loyal valet Sam Weller who very nearly
: walked away with the show. Their enthusiasm, which luckily carries
1 over to virtually everyone in the huge supporting cast, is infectious.
Regrettably, however, "Pickwick" is burdened with a musical score
! that is almost totally undistinguished. "If I Ruled the World," the one
song with any real merit, seems almost stuck in to provide a hit song.
In spite of Leslie Bricusse's clever lyrics, the score sounds like a
pale imitation of—you guessed it "Oliver."
"Pickwick," then, isn't really a bad show; it just isn't a really good
show, either. It's a pleasant evening's entertainment I just can't
\ help wishing it were more than that.
