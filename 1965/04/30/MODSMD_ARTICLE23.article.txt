Surprising Hospitality
If there is a unifying factor, it
is Beagle's almost guilty surprise
at the hospitality of the people he
■' and his companion encounter. It <
makes him feel small, sometimes,
almost unreal, transient blurs
across a country of solidity and
security. When the scooters break
down, or the weather threatens,
; the author is glad about the re
! sultant paranoia: at least Some
■ thing is being cruel to him, and
that's better than Nothing being
nothing to him.
He understands the smallness,'
the comparative insignificance of
tIk 1 lives of some of those he
meets. Yet he understands, too,
the appeal of that kind of life;
to the security hunter in us all:
"... there is something sad and
frightening ... in watching the;
day waitresses at the Dairy Queen
i going home. We would marry i
; them right now, just to have a ;
(place to go. Other people have J
their own scary times of day and
get married then."

family life with her solicitor and

the lighted house, whistling Bras

kept bringing his girl gifts she
couldn't use . . . with my song,
the man says, with my little bunch

which, politely, is a fool, a
schmuck. Well, there are worse
things to be. Better loo, God
