Editor, The Daily:
Re: the letter by Gary Drennen,
headlined "I Dreamt 1 Was Pa
triotic In My Bircherform Bra."
Really. Mr. Drennen, if you are
going to attempt a smear, at least
make it credible. Jerry Jackson,
Activities Chairman of the Viet-
Nam Defense Committee, former
President of the Stanford Area
Young Democrats and former
State Treasurer of the California
YD's, resents the implication that
he is a Bircher because he sup
ports U.S. policy in Viet-Nam.
Charles Countee, member of the
Executive Board of the VDC, a
Democrat and a member of
SNCC, resents the implication
that he is a Bircher. Doug Ray
her and Glen Moreno, members of
the Executive Board of the VDC
and both Democrats, resent the
implication that they are Birch
ers because they support the pol
icy of the Democratic administra
tion.
Carey Coulter, Frank Verlot,
and Carl Anderson, Republicans
who worked hard and successfully
three weeks ago to defeat every
Bircher running for state office
at the convention of the Califor
nia Young Republican College
Federation, and all officers of the

VDC, resent the implication that
they are Birchers simply because
they are not willing to abandon
the peoples of Asia in the face of
Communist aggression.
The classic tactic of the right
wing demagogue has been to call
all those who disagree with him
Communists; The Daily, in its
headline for Mr. Drennen's let
ter, demonstrates the standard
tactic of the demagogues on the
radical left: if you don't agree
with them, you are a Bircher.
Come on, Nancy, you can do
better than that.

Editor, The Daily:
We are afraid that the student
body elections have left us. on
the whole, with a nagging sense
of how irrelevant student govern
ment is. At least one of the presi
dential candidates seemed aware
of this fact, but it is not the kind
of platform on which a presiden
tial campaign can be based. The
serious candidates, instead, talked
about university reform, making
sanity seem Utopian by vague af
firmations and hints of influence
with People in Administration
and Friends on the Faculty.
The point is that students have
no direct voice in those areas of
decision-making which are closest
to the real functions of the Uni
versity.
We would like to suggest,
therefore, since the administra
tion and faculty arc not yet ready
to extend the franchise 1o the
students, that the students extend
the franchise to the faculty and
administration, allowing and en
couraging them to vote in stu
dent elections. If, as some people
have recently and rather sudden
ly claimed, "student affairs" af
fect the whole community, it is
only reasonable that the whole
community should vote in student
elections. Whether this right to

vote is used will, of course, like
many other matters, be one ol'
conscience.

• Dr. Turpin
Editor, The Daily:
I first learnt of Project Concern
about a year ago, so 1 was na
turally very excited to have an
opportunity to hear from the
Founder himself, with the hope of
understanding something about
tho man.
Last night, I came to know how
a boy who dreamed of mission
ary work in China grew up to
find happiness in the slums of
Hong Kong. I also learnt that
Dr. Turpin gave up a lucrative
medical practice and his Sunday
school in Southern California to
do service to the underprivileged
and the heathens of the world.
Ho considered American involve
ment in Viet Nam a defense of
the Free World, which is made up
of Americans and their friends,
and that to war against the Viet
Cong is a necessary, though evil,
task. He gave the impression that
Christians are good, because they
believe in God and that the com
munists are bad, because they do
not. The U.S. Armed Forces are
therefore there doing a necessary
job and Dr. Turpin and his
team are contributing toward the
success of this venture.
Dr. Turpin gave grudging ad
mission of the good health service
provided by the Viet Cong to the
people bui he refused to admit
that the heathens in Viet Nam
may not really care for the Chris
tian ways as practiced there. It
is certainly naive of him to think
that a Christian regime is neces
sarily more desired by the people
there than a communist govern
ment.
Dr. Turpin's work among th e
people of Hong Kong calls for
the greatest admiration, but his
"American conscience" towards
Viet Nam is so unfortunately
marred by political motives and
narrow religious zeal.

no direct voice in those areas of
decision-making which are closest
to the real functions of the Uni

We would like to suggest,
therefore, since the administra

to extend the franchise 1o the
students, that the students extend
the franchise to the faculty and
administration, allowing and en
couraging them to vote in stu

Editor, The Daily:
I first learnt of Project Concern
about a year ago, so 1 was na
turally very excited to have an
opportunity to hear from the
Founder himself, with the hope of
understanding something about

Last night, I came to know how
a boy who dreamed of mission
ary work in China grew up to
find happiness in the slums of
Hong Kong. I also learnt that
Dr. Turpin gave up a lucrative
medical practice and his Sunday
school in Southern California to
do service to the underprivileged
and the heathens of the world.
Ho considered American involve
ment in Viet Nam a defense of
the Free World, which is made up
of Americans and their friends,
and that to war against the Viet
Cong is a necessary, though evil,
task. He gave the impression that
Christians are good, because they
believe in God and that the com
munists are bad, because they do
not. The U.S. Armed Forces are
therefore there doing a necessary
job and Dr. Turpin and his
team are contributing toward the
success of this venture.
Dr. Turpin gave grudging ad
mission of the good health service
provided by the Viet Cong to the
people bui he refused to admit
that the heathens in Viet Nam
may not really care for the Chris
tian ways as practiced there. It
is certainly naive of him to think
that a Christian regime is neces
sarily more desired by the people
there than a communist govern
ment.
Dr. Turpin's work among th e
people of Hong Kong calls for
the greatest admiration, but his
"American conscience" towards
Viet Nam is so unfortunately
marred by political motives and
narrow religious zeal.

Really. Mr. Drennen, if you are
going to attempt a smear, at least
make it credible. Jerry Jackson,
Activities Chairman of the Viet-
Nam Defense Committee, former
President of the Stanford Area
Young Democrats and former
State Treasurer of the California
YD's, resents the implication that
he is a Bircher because he sup
ports U.S. policy in Viet-Nam.
Charles Countee, member of the
Executive Board of the VDC, a
Democrat and a member of
SNCC, resents the implication
that he is a Bircher. Doug Ray
her and Glen Moreno, members of
the Executive Board of the VDC
and both Democrats, resent the
implication that they are Birch
ers because they support the pol
icy of the Democratic administra
tion.
Carey Coulter, Frank Verlot,
and Carl Anderson, Republicans
who worked hard and successfully
three weeks ago to defeat every
Bircher running for state office
at the convention of the Califor
nia Young Republican College
Federation, and all officers of the

VDC, resent the implication that
they are Birchers simply because
they are not willing to abandon
the peoples of Asia in the face of
Communist aggression.
The classic tactic of the right
wing demagogue has been to call
all those who disagree with him
Communists; The Daily, in its
headline for Mr. Drennen's let

tactic of the demagogues on the

Dr. Turpin's work among th e
people of Hong Kong calls for
the greatest admiration, but his
"American conscience" towards
Viet Nam is so unfortunately
marred by political motives and
narrow religious zeal.

Really. Mr. Drennen, if you are
going to attempt a smear, at least
make it credible. Jerry Jackson,
Activities Chairman of the Viet-
Nam Defense Committee, former
President of the Stanford Area
Young Democrats and former
State Treasurer of the California
YD's, resents the implication that
he is a Bircher because he sup
ports U.S. policy in Viet-Nam.
Charles Countee, member of the
Executive Board of the VDC, a
Democrat and a member of
SNCC, resents the implication
that he is a Bircher. Doug Ray
her and Glen Moreno, members of
the Executive Board of the VDC
and both Democrats, resent the
implication that they are Birch
ers because they support the pol
icy of the Democratic administra
tion.
Carey Coulter, Frank Verlot,
and Carl Anderson, Republicans
who worked hard and successfully
three weeks ago to defeat every
Bircher running for state office
at the convention of the Califor
nia Young Republican College
Federation, and all officers of the

VDC, resent the implication that
they are Birchers simply because
they are not willing to abandon
the peoples of Asia in the face of
Communist aggression.
The classic tactic of the right
wing demagogue has been to call
all those who disagree with him
Communists; The Daily, in its
headline for Mr. Drennen's let
ter, demonstrates the standard
tactic of the demagogues on the
radical left: if you don't agree
with them, you are a Bircher.
Come on, Nancy, you can do
better than that.

Editor, The Daily:
We are afraid that the student
body elections have left us. on
the whole, with a nagging sense
of how irrelevant student govern
ment is. At least one of the presi
dential candidates seemed aware
of this fact, but it is not the kind
of platform on which a presiden
tial campaign can be based. The
serious candidates, instead, talked
about university reform, making
sanity seem Utopian by vague af
firmations and hints of influence
with People in Administration
and Friends on the Faculty.
The point is that students have
no direct voice in those areas of
decision-making which are closest
to the real functions of the Uni
versity.
We would like to suggest,
therefore, since the administra
tion and faculty arc not yet ready
to extend the franchise 1o the
students, that the students extend
the franchise to the faculty and
administration, allowing and en
couraging them to vote in stu
dent elections. If, as some people
have recently and rather sudden
ly claimed, "student affairs" af
fect the whole community, it is
only reasonable that the whole
community should vote in student
elections. Whether this right to

vote is used will, of course, like
many other matters, be one ol'
conscience.

Editor, The Daily:
I first learnt of Project Concern
about a year ago, so 1 was na
turally very excited to have an
opportunity to hear from the
Founder himself, with the hope of
understanding something about
tho man.
Last night, I came to know how
a boy who dreamed of mission
ary work in China grew up to
find happiness in the slums of
Hong Kong. I also learnt that
Dr. Turpin gave up a lucrative
medical practice and his Sunday
school in Southern California to
do service to the underprivileged
and the heathens of the world.
Ho considered American involve
ment in Viet Nam a defense of
the Free World, which is made up
of Americans and their friends,
and that to war against the Viet
Cong is a necessary, though evil,
task. He gave the impression that
Christians are good, because they
believe in God and that the com
munists are bad, because they do
not. The U.S. Armed Forces are
therefore there doing a necessary
job and Dr. Turpin and his
team are contributing toward the
success of this venture.
Dr. Turpin gave grudging ad
mission of the good health service
provided by the Viet Cong to the
people bui he refused to admit
that the heathens in Viet Nam
may not really care for the Chris
tian ways as practiced there. It
is certainly naive of him to think
that a Christian regime is neces
sarily more desired by the people
there than a communist govern
ment.
