## The 						Student's Role 
### SHARON PERCY (Fourth in a Series 
As Disraeli loosely divided the world into two nations, the rich
and the poor, so may i( be divided into two classes, the old and the
young.
The isolation of the university from its immediate community has
historical origins. Since the eleventh century, the European university

has been a political and social"
sanctuary, an independent, self
governing state within the state.
The student of the Middle Ages
was trained in a guild school, as
exemplified by the professional
school of Bologna. Only later, in
1257, was a school of liberal arts
established in Paris. Whether in
the guild or liberal arts schools,
the students were sell' governed.
Correspondingly, in the Parisian
master guilds, the students gov
erned themselves socially and po
litically. Only when the imposi
tion of controls was necessary
were these universities invaded by
outside administrators. European
and Latin American universities,
then, have been traditionally self
sufficient and autonomous. In ad
dition, they have been active po
litically, whether the university
was close to the seat of power or
in opposition to it. Within this
community, the role of the stu
dent, who was allowed a major
voice in some sensitive areas of
universitiy policy, is to he com
pared with tiie role of the con
temporary American student.
America Myth
In America, the situation of a
community within a community is
not so clearly defined: nor, con
sequently, is the student's position
so explicitly delineated. The notion
of the American university as an
isolated world is a myth.
Not only is the American uni
versity interrelated to its com
munity, but il has come to serve
the immediate needs of contemp
orary society by rendering itself
subservient to research, business,
industry and bureaucratic com
plexities. It is far from concerning
itself solely with the search for
absolute academic truths: it is
equally far from being the pri
mary source of social criticism of
our culture.
Most American colleges do not
yet embody the characteristics of
the multiuniversity: nevertheless,
They are undergoing the process
of redefinition. The fate of the
student and his role is dependent
upon this re-evaluation.
No Norm
Reasons for attending college
are as divergent as the myriad
personalities who compose the stu
dent role. Although there is a
student role or subculture, il is
evident that there is no student
norm.
The American student may be
the intellectual; he may he psycho
logically and economically depend
ent upon or independent from his
parents; he may be ambitious for
grades, status and a salary or
pledged to the principles of the
liberal education; he may concern
himself with sports, clothes, cars
and the Top Forty or with ending
the war in Viet Nam; he may be a
conformist , he may be a dissent or
and protestor; he may regard col
lege as a training school and be
there simply for its utilitarian
value or he may be releasing his
"free spirit" in intellectual pur
suits. All of these characteristics
typify the student and, combined,
they formulate the student cul
ture.
Magic Key
The student personality is
uniquely expressed by the glow
ing expectations brought to the
university by the student. He has
been taught from the earliest age
to see "education" as the magic
key to success and happiness. As
Paul Goodman states: "They (stu
dents) come to college in search,
not merely of knowledge, but sal
vation."
Tn the Metzschian sense, the
young are lively and beautiful:
their energy and vigor, often un
restrained. must find an academic
or social expression. Students who
consider college to be a transi
tional or trial period believe ex
posure to new possibilities to be of
utmost importance. Nevertheless,

Ihe student vitality so notice
able in freshmen, often results
in a confused and searching state
of mind. A restive and insecure
mentality is just as important
an aspect of the student per
sonality, then, as is exuberant en
thusiasm.
The university, therefore, offers
not only the opportunity to ma
| ture intellectually, but the oppor
tunity to achieve identity, to ex
| plore, discover and accept one's
self. Being a student involves an
I introspection which may confirm
lan original role or give cause
; to the donning of a new one. In
! telleetually and emotionally, the
student must find himself: that is,
I essentially, the responsibility of
! being a student.
Role Redefined
The classical image of the care-
I free student is being transformed
!by the increasingly serious stu
dent for whom freedom of
I I bought and action is a psycholog-
I ical responsability. Carrying rela
j tively few domestic or economic
| burdens, collegians desire and
| need to govern themselves. The
j student intensely desires auton
omy.
As the role of the American uni-;
i versity is being redefined, so we
i see a similar transition in the
role of the student. The contemp
orary student is not the student |
of the Middle Ages who possessed
; bargaining powers in such mat
ters as educational policy or fac
ulty appointments. He is not the
; Parisian scholar for whom thea
| ter discounts and street protest
1 riots are commonplace. Nor is he
the apathetic, apolitical student
of the 1350's who rejected shar
ing "the passion and action of his
lime" (Oliver Wendell Holmes).
S The mood created by post-
J World War II students provoked
i Governor Edmund Brown, ironic
j ally enough, to state in his Com
mencement Address at ihe Uni
i versity of Santa Clara in June,
| 1964:
If America is still on her way
up, it will welcome this new, im
patient, critical crop of young
gadflies. It will he fearful only
of the complacent and passive.
It is my contention that the
j "impatient and critical" genera
tion of students has arrived. In
; the past, American students who
I picketed, edited radical student
, papers or wer "angry youngment"
were rare. Granted, they are still
in the minority, but the motto
j Novus Ordo Seelomni (The New
Order of the World) and a pas-1
sion for social justice are prized
now as never before.
Protest
In opposition to deciding which
band will play at the next dance, |
, students now find more value in;
j working for the civil rights move-;
ment. The primary goal of the I
student is still, fortunately, in-!
I tellectual maturity. Nevertheless,
'social and political causes as well
i as an unprecedented concern for
educational reform are occupying
much of the contemporary stu
dent's thought and time. Probing,
sharing and hypothesizing still!
characterize the student mentality
but these inquiries are being ex
tended from their purely intellec
tual realm and are adopting a so
cial and political significance.
With the advent of the Berke
ley crisis, the role of the Ameri
can student approaches the role
of ihe foreign student. He is rest
less, and this restlessness is being j
expressed in the form of pro- j
test -educational protest, political
protest and social protest. As a !
social class, students do not have j
the power to create reforms, but j
they, graduates and undergrad- j
uates alike, do have the respon
sibility to criticize the older order
of society, thus allowing the
New Order to evolve and social
progress to be achieved.
