### JON ROISE JUSTIN BECK 
Presidential aspirants Sanely j
MaeKenzie and Dave Robbins,
squared off in the first, of two
scheduled debates last night in
Serra House. The next debate will
be held Sunday night in Branner j
at 7 p.m.
Robbins and his running mate:
stressed a "lack of eommunica- •
lion" in the University and aimed :
most of their remarks at combat-1
ing this. They proposed a Presi
dential cabinet of five members i
who would be special advisors
to the President in their fields; !
a bi-monthly newsletter to im-1
prove student awareness ot what
the student government is doing,
in their behalf; and an alumni;
mentor program in which each [
student would have an alumni ad
visor in his field of study.
MaeKenzie and vice-presidchtial
candidate Clark Brown stressed 1

; the idea of getting more people
j involved in the various activities
■ fostered by the ASSU. Mac Ke
n zie emphasized that he saw his
job as not doing everything him
self but "getting the correct
people involved." He also stated
1 that he would give "leadership be
yond simply giving out activity
j credits," if his ticket won in the
; May 2-4 election.
The candidates differed on the
1 question of LASSU speaking on
: off-campus issues. MaeKenzie
i held that while it "was not the
• primary responsibility" of LASSU
! to speak on off-campus issues, it
I would be "unnecessary and unde
: sirable" to deny the student body
j any voice with which to speak
; on off-campus issues.
.Robbins and Morse supported
a student referendum to express
j opinions of the student body on
I issues of concern. They oppose the
' idea of the Leigslature represent-

I ing the students on off-campus
! issues.
The two candidates differed on
the types of people whom they
would have in their respective
cabinets.
MacKcnzic said his cabinet, to
meet monthly, would be composed
i of various student leaders, includ
ing chairmen of boards, commis-
I sions, and other organizations.
Robbins stated that unaffiliated
individuals, "selected on their
I competence and merit," would be
j chosen to advise him.
A potential new issue was un
; covered in the area of interpreta
tion of the Fundamental Stan
dard and Honor Code. Robbins
would move the interpretive pow-
I er from LASSU to the judicial
I councils.
MacKen/.ie said he thought the
! idea revealed "a lack of knowl
; edge," on Robbins part, of the
1 ASSU structure.
