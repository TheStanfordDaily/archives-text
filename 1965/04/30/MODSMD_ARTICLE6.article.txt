# Students To Vote On Amendments
## By-Laws Holds Open Hearings 
### JOEL KUGELMASS 
The By-Laws Committee hold !
open hearings for three hours
; Wednesday night, taking testi
| mony from supporters of the
original initiative petition, the
GCC, which opposed it and th e
I Committee of Five.
It sent to LASSU the Commit
j tee of Five's compromise recom
! mendation that student govern
, ment be prohibited from taking
off-campus stands, but that it be
empowered to call a "plebiscite"
on such issues. The compromise
had been reached by Tom Rado
of the GCC. Bob Naylor, a sup
porter of the original petition and
Clyde Christ off orson.
The Committee also forwarded
th e original proposal which
LASSU representative Jam e s
Greenley had drawn up an d
! which received over 1,300 signa- ,
; lures.
No Quorum
Because the last meeting of the :
i lcgislaure did not have a quorum, I
explained Scott Mc√üride, the mat
tor will not appear on the presi-;
j dentiaJ ballot next Monday.
He continued to say that if the j
Legislature does not decide on '
any of ihree alternatives proposed i
, by the By-Laws committee with-J
in ten days, the student body will ;
; vote in a special election on '
i only whether: "The government
of the Associated Students of
! Stanford . . . shall not take posi
tions on matters other than those
j pertaining to student affairs on
. . . campus."
j Students may vote to imple
! ment one of three other choices,
if LASSU meets. Either the Leg
islature may express consensus J
! on "any issue of deep concern to !
students," or only if there is a:
| quorum of two-thirds of the rep-,
j resentatives, or finally refer the,
; matter to general student body
l vote. The second and third alterna
tives emphasize formal procedure
and limit iniative by the Legis-j
lature. The third possibility does;
not permit legislative consensus,!
but does allow a general student
body poll through a vote.
