# DOLL HOUSE ROCKED
## Sorority Circuit: Tea and Baloney 
### SUE WICKIZER (Second in a Scries 
Dorm ladies continued their mild tirade
at sororities, and for one brief, inspiring
moment, it looked like Stanford might
have an issue to discuss.
The feeling became more predominate
that the houses were casting themselves
in the role of the socially elite. Dorm
women raged that sororities were "un
democratic" since the row could not
handle more than twice the number of
girls who wanted to pledge. With a sud
dent emphasis on academics, women also
objected to rushing parties which in
terfered with scholastic work during
finals.
In 1943. the Freshmen women voiced
their opinion on the conflict in another
apparent revolt against the system.
During winter rush, a group of frosh
dollies in Roble called a meeting of all
girls urging them to refuse to rush. But
the majority of the women preferred to
go through rush even though it was
obvious that most could not be accepted.
Dorm Opinion
Undaunted by this revolt, the upper
class dorm girls voiced their opinion in
The Daily. Sororities were eritized as
"superfluous," the pledge system "un
democratic," and the (Jreck atmosphere
"social rather than academic "

Debate raged for about two weeks. The
Daily published a paragraph edged in
black, mourning J hose who were "going
around to the houses drinking the tea
and eating the balooney." "God help those
who pledge," it ended.
In ;i response the sororities admitted
their deficiencies, but proudly pointed out
that "in the sorority, based on the goal
of unity, one feels a responsibility and
consideration for each other ... a respon
sibility which makes one subjugate one's
self interests to preserve the unity of the
group."
False Calm
In a strategic maneuver, the row made
an effort that year to alter many of the
complaints on rushing by shortening and
infoirnali/ing the rush period.
As the rush for 1943 ended, calm
descended on the campus. The Daily, in
an editorial, summed up campus feeling,
stating, "We don't propose to fight the
hall-row question in this column. Each
hits its real advantages . .
Few people on campus expected tiic
debate to be resurrected until the next
year, and no one, except perhaps a few
Roble sponsors, cherished any intentions
of altering the situation.
But crusading for their cause, a group
of thirteen Roble sponsors submitted a
letter to the Board of Trustees requesting
in enmnlete seriousness that sororities

examine their "superfluous role; on cam
pus and voluntarily abolish themselves."
Campus Aroused
The campus was aroused from their
lethargy to continue discussing the issue
for one week. The anti-sorority motto
was "The winds of freedom do not blow
here," the opposite of the Stanford motto,
"Die Luft der Freieheit weht."
All efforls to entice both Row and
dorm women to work on the same in
vestigating committee to study the issue
failed because no spirit of cooperation
could be maintained on either side.
A non-partisan committee was set up
to study the situation in cooperation
with the Panhellenic council. True to its
principles, one of the members of the
committee commented, "We are not
here to deny the advantages of sororities
in other places, but we do not believe
the system is suitable to our campus."
The Panhellenic Commit te considered
two possibilities in their discussion: to
place Stanford entirely on a dorm basis
or to better the sorority system.
Solution
In eailv March sororities submitted
their answer to the Trustees, proposing
the establishment of new houses, the
pledging of more girls and housing the
overflow in residence halls, postponing of
rush until spring, and postponing of
pledging until junior year.
Though their original complaints nl

"undemocratic' and too social" had boon
satisfied, dorm women opposed the pro
posals on (he grounds that hall and row
women could not live side by side in
the same community.
Even though compromise was a method
to ho reserved for the activist govern
ments of the future, both sides hoped a
decision would be made on the problem
by a vote of the women students.
Alumnae Opinion
Not cjuite as confident of student intel
ligence, the alumnate objected to a cam
pus plebiscite. They felt students did not
realize the procedure involved in with
drawing a sorority charter and moreover
did not have the authority to voice their
opinion on the question.
"How students live should be an ad
ministration policy," one alumna stated.
"College community living depends on
university plans."
The shouting died away in late March,
and (lie question of voting was never
â– solved. In fact, the sorority question
seemed insignificant compared to Spring
Sing, the issue of whether or not men
were required to buy corsages for dances,
and the ASSU election.
For the ne\t fourteen months pledge
lists were published, rushing dates were
printed, and the sorority war effort was
commended without any black criticism.
Behind the scones, however, the Trus
tees crept quietly, preparing In spring.
