# Sororities Been Abolished, You Say? Oh...
## 
### SUE DALEY (Last in a Series 
True to the Stanford spirit, when the elite
necks of the sorority socialites "got the axe"
in a most positive sense from the Trustees,
the students responded with heart-felt apa
thetic ambivalence. It was the outside world,
strangely enough, that clamored for revenge
or cheered for democracy.
The Trustees' action followed 11 months of
study undertaken in response to a student
petition submitted by 13 Roble sponsors. The
sponsors criticized the sororities as "super
fluous" and requested that "they voluntarily
abolish themselves."
One Week Debate
Students were aroused from their lethargy
long enough to debate the pros and cons of the
request for one week. Student committees
were formed to study the issue, but no spirit
of cooperation could be maintained long
enough betwen dorm girls and row girls to
establish one single committee.
The sorority question soon dropped out of

sight in campus politics. Most students con
sidered the problem either unsolvable or ir
relevant to the more important events on
campus, like spring sing.
Fourteen months later, on April 20, 1941,
Donald B. Tresidder, then President of the
University, called a mass meeting of the wom
en students with the ominous comment, "I
would rather be anywhere else than here to
night."
Before a packed audience in Cubberley Aud
itorium, the president announced that "in the
interests of campus unity" the Trustees had
authorized the discontinuance of sororities and
the unification of women's housing under Uni
versity ownership.
But Not Here
The advantages of a sorority system in other
colleges were not in question, the president:
carefully noted, bvit it had been found that the
system was not one that was suitable to he
Sanford campus.
"The Trustees concluded," Tresidder said,
"that the duel system of responsibility for the

housing and social programs had become a
source of disunity in the educational process
and were not in the best interests of women
students."
"The proopsed remedies such as the addition
of new sororities on campus would not elimi
nate the fundamental cause of disunity," he
concluded.
Arcepted lihMl ferently
The president's surprise announcement was
accepted with a revealing spirit of indifference
among sorority and dorm coeds. No one ques
tioned what the "fundamental cause of dis
unity" was, or why the problem could not
have ben remedied if sororities were to in
crease their membership and add additional
houses on campus, or why fraternities were
excluded from the report.
"President Tresidder is right," one girl
gushed patriotically. "Membership in a soror
ity may be one of the dearer things in col
lege life, but, above all, we are Stanford
women."
Another Stanfordite characteristically re

marked, "It was such a beautiful speech, and
we have decided that Dr. Tresidder indeed is
'the man of the year'."
But perhaps the most telling reaction was
from the sorority girls themselves. Oik; soror
ity president declared, "The president's an
nouncement has left quite a few of us upset.
But 1 guess there is no point in trying to
take any action in combating he order inas
much as the decision already is final. It hap
pened so suddenly."
Patriotic Reactions
The president of the Panhellenic League at
Stanford agreed, saying that even though the
sororities had not supported the petition to the
Trustees, "we are now 100 per cent behind Dr.
Tresidder. We are proud to be known as
Stanford women."
Ironically enough, the outside world reacted
much more violently to the Trustees decision.
Time accused Stanford of committing "sorori
cide."
One sorority alumna accused the Trustees
themselves of acting in an undemocratic fash

ion. "The Panhellenie has done all they could
to cooperate in finding a solution to the prob
lem, but the University authorities have re
fused all suggestions and have banned the
sororities without giving other measures a
trial," she charged.
A national Panhellenic officer raged, "This
is just another example of the leveling pro
cess. You take away from the priviledged, but
you don't distribute evenly among the many."
Despite outside reaction, the sororities
promptly disbanded. National charters were
revoked on July 1, and the University pur
chased the houses and magnanimously re
named them for men and women who had
helped build sororities from the days of the
first charters.
Thus, Stanford women bravely turned their
backs on snobbishnish, in-groupism and other
endearing aspects of sorority life. "The row"
replaced the Greek houses on campus, and
the social butterfly nevermore returned to
threatened the unity of the female portion of
the student body.

much more violently to the Trustees decision.
Time accused Stanford of committing "sorori
cide."
One sorority alumna accused the Trustees
themselves of acting in an undemocratic fash

ion. "The Panhellenie has done all they could
to cooperate in finding a solution to the prob
lem, but the University authorities have re
fused all suggestions and have banned the
sororities without giving other measures a
trial," she charged.
A national Panhellenic officer raged, "This
is just another example of the leveling pro
cess. You take away from the priviledged, but
you don't distribute evenly among the many."
Despite outside reaction, the sororities
promptly disbanded. National charters were
revoked on July 1, and the University pur
chased the houses and magnanimously re
named them for men and women who had
helped build sororities from the days of the
first charters.
Thus, Stanford women bravely turned their
backs on snobbishnish, in-groupism and other
endearing aspects of sorority life. "The row"
replaced the Greek houses on campus, and
the social butterfly nevermore returned to
threatened the unity of the female portion of
the student body.
True to the Stanford spirit, when the elite
necks of the sorority socialites "got the axe"
in a most positive sense from the Trustees,
the students responded with heart-felt apa
thetic ambivalence. It was the outside world,
strangely enough, that clamored for revenge
or cheered for democracy.
The Trustees' action followed 11 months of
study undertaken in response to a student
petition submitted by 13 Roble sponsors. The
sponsors criticized the sororities as "super
fluous" and requested that "they voluntarily
abolish themselves."
One Week Debate
Students were aroused from their lethargy
long enough to debate the pros and cons of the
request for one week. Student committees
were formed to study the issue, but no spirit
of cooperation could be maintained long
enough betwen dorm girls and row girls to
establish one single committee.
The sorority question soon dropped out of

sight in campus politics. Most students con
sidered the problem either unsolvable or ir
relevant to the more important events on
campus, like spring sing.
Fourteen months later, on April 20, 1941,
Donald B. Tresidder, then President of the
University, called a mass meeting of the wom
en students with the ominous comment, "I
would rather be anywhere else than here to
night."
Before a packed audience in Cubberley Aud
itorium, the president announced that "in the
interests of campus unity" the Trustees had
authorized the discontinuance of sororities and
the unification of women's housing under Uni
versity ownership.
But Not Here
The advantages of a sorority system in other
colleges were not in question, the president:
carefully noted, bvit it had been found that the
system was not one that was suitable to he
Sanford campus.
"The Trustees concluded," Tresidder said,
"that the duel system of responsibility for the

housing and social programs had become a
source of disunity in the educational process
and were not in the best interests of women
students."
"The proopsed remedies such as the addition
of new sororities on campus would not elimi
nate the fundamental cause of disunity," he
concluded.
Arcepted lihMl ferently
The president's surprise announcement was
accepted with a revealing spirit of indifference
among sorority and dorm coeds. No one ques
tioned what the "fundamental cause of dis
unity" was, or why the problem could not
have ben remedied if sororities were to in
crease their membership and add additional
houses on campus, or why fraternities were
excluded from the report.
"President Tresidder is right," one girl
gushed patriotically. "Membership in a soror
ity may be one of the dearer things in col
lege life, but, above all, we are Stanford
women."
Another Stanfordite characteristically re

marked, "It was such a beautiful speech, and
we have decided that Dr. Tresidder indeed is
'the man of the year'."
But perhaps the most telling reaction was
from the sorority girls themselves. Oik; soror
ity president declared, "The president's an
nouncement has left quite a few of us upset.
But 1 guess there is no point in trying to
take any action in combating he order inas
much as the decision already is final. It hap
pened so suddenly."
Patriotic Reactions
The president of the Panhellenic League at
Stanford agreed, saying that even though the
sororities had not supported the petition to the
Trustees, "we are now 100 per cent behind Dr.
Tresidder. We are proud to be known as
Stanford women."

excluded from the report.
"President Tresidder is right," one girl
gushed patriotically. "Membership in a soror
ity may be one of the dearer things in col
lege life, but, above all, we are Stanford
women."
Another Stanfordite characteristically re

marked, "It was such a beautiful speech, and
we have decided that Dr. Tresidder indeed is
'the man of the year'."
But perhaps the most telling reaction was
from the sorority girls themselves. Oik; soror
ity president declared, "The president's an
nouncement has left quite a few of us upset.
But 1 guess there is no point in trying to
take any action in combating he order inas
much as the decision already is final. It hap
pened so suddenly."
Patriotic Reactions
The president of the Panhellenic League at
Stanford agreed, saying that even though the
sororities had not supported the petition to the
Trustees, "we are now 100 per cent behind Dr.
Tresidder. We are proud to be known as
Stanford women."
Ironically enough, the outside world reacted
much more violently to the Trustees decision.
Time accused Stanford of committing "sorori
cide."
One sorority alumna accused the Trustees
themselves of acting in an undemocratic fash

ion. "The Panhellenie has done all they could
to cooperate in finding a solution to the prob
lem, but the University authorities have re
fused all suggestions and have banned the
sororities without giving other measures a
trial," she charged.
A national Panhellenic officer raged, "This
is just another example of the leveling pro
cess. You take away from the priviledged, but
you don't distribute evenly among the many."
Despite outside reaction, the sororities
promptly disbanded. National charters were
revoked on July 1, and the University pur
chased the houses and magnanimously re
named them for men and women who had
helped build sororities from the days of the
first charters.
Thus, Stanford women bravely turned their
backs on snobbishnish, in-groupism and other
endearing aspects of sorority life. "The row"
replaced the Greek houses on campus, and
the social butterfly nevermore returned to
threatened the unity of the female portion of
the student body.
True to the Stanford spirit, when the elite
necks of the sorority socialites "got the axe"
in a most positive sense from the Trustees,
the students responded with heart-felt apa
thetic ambivalence. It was the outside world,
strangely enough, that clamored for revenge
or cheered for democracy.
The Trustees' action followed 11 months of
study undertaken in response to a student
petition submitted by 13 Roble sponsors. The
sponsors criticized the sororities as "super
fluous" and requested that "they voluntarily
abolish themselves."
One Week Debate
Students were aroused from their lethargy
long enough to debate the pros and cons of the
request for one week. Student committees
were formed to study the issue, but no spirit
of cooperation could be maintained long
enough betwen dorm girls and row girls to
establish one single committee.
The sorority question soon dropped out of

sight in campus politics. Most students con
sidered the problem either unsolvable or ir
relevant to the more important events on
campus, like spring sing.
Fourteen months later, on April 20, 1941,
Donald B. Tresidder, then President of the
University, called a mass meeting of the wom
en students with the ominous comment, "I
would rather be anywhere else than here to
night."
Before a packed audience in Cubberley Aud
itorium, the president announced that "in the
interests of campus unity" the Trustees had
authorized the discontinuance of sororities and
the unification of women's housing under Uni
versity ownership.
But Not Here
The advantages of a sorority system in other
colleges were not in question, the president:
carefully noted, bvit it had been found that the
system was not one that was suitable to he
Sanford campus.
"The Trustees concluded," Tresidder said,
"that the duel system of responsibility for the

housing and social programs had become a
source of disunity in the educational process
and were not in the best interests of women
students."
"The proopsed remedies such as the addition
of new sororities on campus would not elimi
nate the fundamental cause of disunity," he
concluded.
Arcepted lihMl ferently
The president's surprise announcement was
accepted with a revealing spirit of indifference
among sorority and dorm coeds. No one ques
tioned what the "fundamental cause of dis
unity" was, or why the problem could not
have ben remedied if sororities were to in
crease their membership and add additional
houses on campus, or why fraternities were
excluded from the report.
