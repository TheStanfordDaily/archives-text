the Huskies. It may even be-*
longer than that, but records go
back only that far. Together with
Cal, Washington has perennially
been the scourge of Coast crew.
As Stanford's race began, it
looked like the same old story.
Stanford fell back to third place
during the first 500 meters of the
2000-meter race. But the reason
was that the Indians had dropped

Stanford pulled off one of the biggest shockers in West Coast
crew racing Saturday as it soundly defeated the powerful University
of Washington crew on the Willamette River in Corvallis, Oregon.
The host Oregon State crew was third.
It was the first time since 1918 that an Indian crew had beaten

thoir early sprint of 38 strokes
per minute down to 34, while
Washington and OSU kept up the
killing pace.
Indians Gain Fast
By the 750-meter point, the
other crews were tiring, and Ihe
Indians rapidly caught up, gain
ing on the Huskies at the rate of
a boat seat every two strokes. By
the halfway mark, the two crews
were dead even.
Stanford coxswain Gene Her
mitte kept up the steady pace,
and with just 500 meters to go,
Stanford led by nearly a boat
length.
Then the Huskies started then
famed closing sprint, and sudden
ly were only half a boat length
behind. But Hermitte signalled for
an Indian sprint, and Stanford
pulled away to win in 5 minutes,
58.6 seconds. Washington was
timed in 6:01.6, and Oregon State
in 6:08.0.
In the JV race, OSU beat Stan
ford by nearly six seconds. Stan
ford's freshman boat finished a
close second to the Huskies, but
were disqualified when a strong
headwind and the tricky river cur-
J rent carried their shell out of its
i lane.
In the winning varsity boat
| were Leeds Disston, Bill Stump,
I Dick Herzog, Larry Mc√üride, Tim
I Cowles, Dave Robbins, Lar r y
Hough, stroke Steve Parker, and
coxswain Hermitte. Six of the
nine are juniors, and three are
sophomores.
