# Walsh, Questad Lead Stanford To 87-58 Big Meet Victory
## 
### PETER KING 
Hud Walsh and Larry Questad led Stanford to a surprisingly easy
87-58 track victory over Cal in the 70th Big Meet Saturday at Berke
ley. It was Stanford's fourth straight track win over the Bears.
The Indian freshmen gave promise of more of the same in the
future, as they walloped the Bear yearlings, 100-45, bv sweeping all

sprints and piling up a huge mar-*
gin in the field events.
Walsh, a sophomore, entered
and won three events. He took
first in the broad jump, with a
23'5'L>" leap, led a Stanford sweep
in the high hurdles in his best
lime ever, 14.8 seconds, and then
captured I he intermediate hurdles j
in 38.2.
()uestad Wins Dashes
Quasi ad won both the 100 and |
220-yard dashes for the fourth
straight week. He led teammates
Eric Frische and Dale Rubin
across the finish line in the 100,
winning in 9.5 seconds, which tied
tlit meet record. He also edged!
two Cal runners in the 220, in 21.2 !
seconds, also a meet record.
Stanford's unbeaten 440 relay j
team was the underdog to Cal's '
fine speedsters, but a brilliant 1
pass from Frische to Rubin j
sprung the Tribe into a three-yard I
lead halfway through. However,
Donn Forbes, running the third
leg, started his sprint too late,
and Cal took advantage of the
bungled pass, zipped into a large
lead.
Questad turned on all his steam j
in the final leg and closed the
margin 1o a yard at the finish, j
His effort enable the team to j
break the 15-year-old school rec
ord of 40.9 seconds by a tenth of j
a second.
Injuries Didn't Hurt
It had been feared that injuries
to key Stanford men would cut
I he point margin below 10. How
ever, Paul Schlieke ran hard on a
sore leg, winning the mile in
4:13.1. He opened a huge early
lead by running the first half
mile in 2:04. Tiring toward tht
end, he summoned just enough
energy to hold off fast-closing Ly
man Shaffer of Cal, who ran

4:14.6. Stanford's YVeym Kirkland
took third in 4:16.4.
Indian half-milor Davo Deubner
was l'orcod to run the two-mile
due to a sore arch. The switch
paid off, as he romped to a 16-
second victory in 9:13.1.
Sophomore Jim Eshelman con
tinued his amazing improvement
in the pole vault, winning it for
the fifth straight meet. Afier pass
ing until the bar reached 14-7, he
then missed his first two tries.
Then, however, lie easily cleared
his final attempt, plus two more
at 15-1 and lfw'4. Teammate Dick
Barkley took second place, while
Stanford record-holder C h u c k
Smith did not compote because of
a pulled muscle.
Indians Top Field Events
Bruce Wilhelm won the shot
put for the first time since the
middle of March with a 54-10
throw. Bob Stoecker placed sec
ond, and also won the discus with
a fine 180-6 flip. George Porter
and Art Miller won two more field
events. Porter threw the javelin
210-9 and Miller triple-jumped
44-6!i.
Things looked grim for Stan
ford early in the meet. The Bears
swept the high .jump behind Bill
Cartel's meet-record 6-10 :i + jump,
won the 440 relay, and placed 1-2
in the 440 as Cal's Forrest Beaty
upset teammate Dave Archibald
in 47.6 seconds. That gave Cal a

30 20 lead, as the Straw Hat Band
whooped it up.
Then Walsh and Questad took
over. Walsh won the broad jump
and led a blanket finish Stanford
sweep in the high hurdles, with
Greg Ford and Rick Scherer fol
lowing. A Tribe sweep in the 100
plus Eshelman's victory boosted
Stanford back into a 52-34 advant
age, and the Indians gradually
pulled away.
The team victory accomplished
two things. It broke a two meet
losing streak for Stanford, and it
killed the melodrama which would
have surrounded an upset vic
tory by outgoing Cal Coach Bru
tus Hamilton, After 33 years at
Berkeley, Hamilton was eulogized
in pre-meet ceremonies, and the
Bears had vowed a "win one for
the C.ipper" pledge.
At first il appeared that psy
chology might win the meet for
Cal, as five Bears posted best-of
life performances. However, for
tunately for the Tribe, the race is
to the swift and the mighty, and
ai least in this case, class told.
Frosli Sweep 5 Events
It probably will next year, also.
Stanford's freshman won the
most lopsided Little Big Meet in
recent memory. The frosh swept

elin. The seven field events were
held first, and the frosh won six
of the seven, piling up a 48-15
lead. The Papooses won the
sprints, 32-5, for a massive 80-20
lead.

many points as the whole Cal
team. Chuck Schembra won the
shot put by a half-inch on his last

seconds. Ed Hanks, who holds the
varsity high jump record of 6-10,
leaped (i-8 to win that ovent. Then,
the team needed some depth in the
pole vault, so Hanks went 10-6

sweep in the high hurdles, with
Greg Ford and Rick Scherer fol
lowing. A Tribe sweep in the 100
plus Eshelman's victory boosted
Stanford back into a 52-34 advant
age, and the Indians gradually
pulled away.
The team victory accomplished
two things. It broke a two meet
losing streak for Stanford, and it
killed the melodrama which would
have surrounded an upset vic
tory by outgoing Cal Coach Bru
tus Hamilton, After 33 years at
Berkeley, Hamilton was eulogized
in pre-meet ceremonies, and the
Bears had vowed a "win one for
the C.ipper" pledge.
At first il appeared that psy
chology might win the meet for
Cal, as five Bears posted best-of
life performances. However, for
tunately for the Tribe, the race is
to the swift and the mighty, and
ai least in this case, class told.
Frosli Sweep 5 Events
It probably will next year, also.
Stanford's freshman won the
most lopsided Little Big Meet in
recent memory. The frosh swept
the 100, 220, 440, discus, and jav
elin. The seven field events were
held first, and the frosh won six
of the seven, piling up a 48-15
lead. The Papooses won the
sprints, 32-5, for a massive 80-20
lead.
Five freshmen scored nearly as
many points as the whole Cal
team. Chuck Schembra won the
shot put by a half-inch on his last
throw, at 49-4'-, and also cap

lured the discus at 150-4, Craig
Vaughn won both the broad jump
and triple jump, with leaps of
22-1 Hand 42-4',.
Martin. Ward Win
Del Martin took tho 220 in 22
seconds flat, placed second in the
440, and ran on the winning 440
relay team. Jim Ward was also on
that team; he won the 410 in 48.5
seconds. Ed Hanks, who holds the
varsity high jump record of 6-10,
leaped (i-8 to win that ovent. Then,
the team needed some depth in the
pole vault, so Hanks went 10-6
for third place.
Roger Cox bolstered the hopes
foi next year's sprint squad when
he won the 100 in 9.7, tying the
meet record. Other winners were
Carter Newton in the javelin
( i, Jim Letterer in the mile
(4:24.0), and Bob Kelley in the
two-mile (9:43.0).
Hud Walsh and Larry Questad led Stanford to a surprisingly easy
87-58 track victory over Cal in the 70th Big Meet Saturday at Berke
ley. It was Stanford's fourth straight track win over the Bears.
The Indian freshmen gave promise of more of the same in the
future, as they walloped the Bear yearlings, 100-45, bv sweeping all

sprints and piling up a huge mar-*
gin in the field events.
Walsh, a sophomore, entered
and won three events. He took
first in the broad jump, with a
23'5'L>" leap, led a Stanford sweep
in the high hurdles in his best
lime ever, 14.8 seconds, and then
captured I he intermediate hurdles j
in 38.2.
()uestad Wins Dashes
Quasi ad won both the 100 and |
220-yard dashes for the fourth
straight week. He led teammates
Eric Frische and Dale Rubin
across the finish line in the 100,
winning in 9.5 seconds, which tied
tlit meet record. He also edged!
two Cal runners in the 220, in 21.2 !
seconds, also a meet record.
Stanford's unbeaten 440 relay j
team was the underdog to Cal's '
fine speedsters, but a brilliant 1
pass from Frische to Rubin j
sprung the Tribe into a three-yard I
lead halfway through. However,
Donn Forbes, running the third
leg, started his sprint too late,
and Cal took advantage of the
bungled pass, zipped into a large
lead.
Questad turned on all his steam j
in the final leg and closed the
margin 1o a yard at the finish, j
His effort enable the team to j
break the 15-year-old school rec
ord of 40.9 seconds by a tenth of j
a second.
Injuries Didn't Hurt
It had been feared that injuries
to key Stanford men would cut
I he point margin below 10. How
ever, Paul Schlieke ran hard on a
sore leg, winning the mile in
4:13.1. He opened a huge early
lead by running the first half
mile in 2:04. Tiring toward tht
end, he summoned just enough
energy to hold off fast-closing Ly
man Shaffer of Cal, who ran

4:14.6. Stanford's YVeym Kirkland
took third in 4:16.4.
Indian half-milor Davo Deubner
was l'orcod to run the two-mile
due to a sore arch. The switch
paid off, as he romped to a 16-
second victory in 9:13.1.
Sophomore Jim Eshelman con
tinued his amazing improvement
in the pole vault, winning it for
the fifth straight meet. Afier pass
ing until the bar reached 14-7, he
then missed his first two tries.
Then, however, lie easily cleared
his final attempt, plus two more
at 15-1 and lfw'4. Teammate Dick
Barkley took second place, while
Stanford record-holder C h u c k
Smith did not compote because of
a pulled muscle.

Bruce Wilhelm won the shot
put for the first time since the
middle of March with a 54-10

a fine 180-6 flip. George Porter
and Art Miller won two more field
events. Porter threw the javelin
210-9 and Miller triple-jumped
44-6!i.
Things looked grim for Stan
ford early in the meet. The Bears
swept the high .jump behind Bill
Cartel's meet-record 6-10 :i + jump,
won the 440 relay, and placed 1-2
in the 440 as Cal's Forrest Beaty
upset teammate Dave Archibald

bungled pass, zipped into a large

in the final leg and closed the
margin 1o a yard at the finish, j
His effort enable the team to j
break the 15-year-old school rec
ord of 40.9 seconds by a tenth of j
a second.
Injuries Didn't Hurt
It had been feared that injuries
to key Stanford men would cut
I he point margin below 10. How
ever, Paul Schlieke ran hard on a
sore leg, winning the mile in
4:13.1. He opened a huge early
lead by running the first half
mile in 2:04. Tiring toward tht
end, he summoned just enough
energy to hold off fast-closing Ly
man Shaffer of Cal, who ran

4:14.6. Stanford's YVeym Kirkland
took third in 4:16.4.
Indian half-milor Davo Deubner
was l'orcod to run the two-mile
due to a sore arch. The switch
paid off, as he romped to a 16-
second victory in 9:13.1.
Sophomore Jim Eshelman con
tinued his amazing improvement
in the pole vault, winning it for
the fifth straight meet. Afier pass
ing until the bar reached 14-7, he
then missed his first two tries.
Then, however, lie easily cleared
his final attempt, plus two more
at 15-1 and lfw'4. Teammate Dick
Barkley took second place, while
Stanford record-holder C h u c k
Smith did not compote because of
a pulled muscle.
Indians Top Field Events
Bruce Wilhelm won the shot
put for the first time since the
middle of March with a 54-10
throw. Bob Stoecker placed sec
ond, and also won the discus with
a fine 180-6 flip. George Porter
and Art Miller won two more field
events. Porter threw the javelin
210-9 and Miller triple-jumped
44-6!i.
Things looked grim for Stan
ford early in the meet. The Bears
swept the high .jump behind Bill
Cartel's meet-record 6-10 :i + jump,
won the 440 relay, and placed 1-2
in the 440 as Cal's Forrest Beaty
upset teammate Dave Archibald
in 47.6 seconds. That gave Cal a

30 20 lead, as the Straw Hat Band
whooped it up.
Then Walsh and Questad took
over. Walsh won the broad jump
and led a blanket finish Stanford
sweep in the high hurdles, with
Greg Ford and Rick Scherer fol
lowing. A Tribe sweep in the 100
plus Eshelman's victory boosted
Stanford back into a 52-34 advant
age, and the Indians gradually
pulled away.
The team victory accomplished
two things. It broke a two meet
losing streak for Stanford, and it
killed the melodrama which would
have surrounded an upset vic
tory by outgoing Cal Coach Bru
tus Hamilton, After 33 years at
Berkeley, Hamilton was eulogized
in pre-meet ceremonies, and the
Bears had vowed a "win one for
the C.ipper" pledge.
At first il appeared that psy
chology might win the meet for
Cal, as five Bears posted best-of
life performances. However, for
tunately for the Tribe, the race is
to the swift and the mighty, and
ai least in this case, class told.

shot put by a half-inch on his last
throw, at 49-4'-, and also cap

lured the discus at 150-4, Craig
Vaughn won both the broad jump
and triple jump, with leaps of
22-1 Hand 42-4',.
Martin. Ward Win
Del Martin took tho 220 in 22
seconds flat, placed second in the
440, and ran on the winning 440
relay team. Jim Ward was also on
that team; he won the 410 in 48.5
seconds. Ed Hanks, who holds the
varsity high jump record of 6-10,
leaped (i-8 to win that ovent. Then,
the team needed some depth in the
pole vault, so Hanks went 10-6
for third place.
Roger Cox bolstered the hopes
foi next year's sprint squad when
he won the 100 in 9.7, tying the
meet record. Other winners were
Carter Newton in the javelin
( i, Jim Letterer in the mile
(4:24.0), and Bob Kelley in the
two-mile (9:43.0).
Hud Walsh and Larry Questad led Stanford to a surprisingly easy
87-58 track victory over Cal in the 70th Big Meet Saturday at Berke
ley. It was Stanford's fourth straight track win over the Bears.
The Indian freshmen gave promise of more of the same in the
future, as they walloped the Bear yearlings, 100-45, bv sweeping all

sprints and piling up a huge mar-*
gin in the field events.
Walsh, a sophomore, entered
and won three events. He took
first in the broad jump, with a
23'5'L>" leap, led a Stanford sweep
in the high hurdles in his best
lime ever, 14.8 seconds, and then
captured I he intermediate hurdles j
in 38.2.
()uestad Wins Dashes
Quasi ad won both the 100 and |
220-yard dashes for the fourth
straight week. He led teammates
Eric Frische and Dale Rubin
across the finish line in the 100,
winning in 9.5 seconds, which tied
tlit meet record. He also edged!
two Cal runners in the 220, in 21.2 !
seconds, also a meet record.
Stanford's unbeaten 440 relay j
team was the underdog to Cal's '
fine speedsters, but a brilliant 1
pass from Frische to Rubin j
sprung the Tribe into a three-yard I
lead halfway through. However,
Donn Forbes, running the third
leg, started his sprint too late,
and Cal took advantage of the
bungled pass, zipped into a large
lead.
Questad turned on all his steam j
in the final leg and closed the
margin 1o a yard at the finish, j
His effort enable the team to j
break the 15-year-old school rec
ord of 40.9 seconds by a tenth of j
a second.
Injuries Didn't Hurt
It had been feared that injuries
to key Stanford men would cut
I he point margin below 10. How
ever, Paul Schlieke ran hard on a
sore leg, winning the mile in
4:13.1. He opened a huge early
lead by running the first half
mile in 2:04. Tiring toward tht
end, he summoned just enough
energy to hold off fast-closing Ly
man Shaffer of Cal, who ran

4:14.6. Stanford's YVeym Kirkland
took third in 4:16.4.
Indian half-milor Davo Deubner
was l'orcod to run the two-mile
due to a sore arch. The switch
paid off, as he romped to a 16-
second victory in 9:13.1.
Sophomore Jim Eshelman con
tinued his amazing improvement
in the pole vault, winning it for
the fifth straight meet. Afier pass
ing until the bar reached 14-7, he
then missed his first two tries.
Then, however, lie easily cleared
his final attempt, plus two more
at 15-1 and lfw'4. Teammate Dick
Barkley took second place, while
Stanford record-holder C h u c k
Smith did not compote because of
a pulled muscle.
Indians Top Field Events
Bruce Wilhelm won the shot
put for the first time since the
middle of March with a 54-10
throw. Bob Stoecker placed sec
ond, and also won the discus with
a fine 180-6 flip. George Porter
and Art Miller won two more field
events. Porter threw the javelin
210-9 and Miller triple-jumped
44-6!i.
Things looked grim for Stan
ford early in the meet. The Bears
swept the high .jump behind Bill
Cartel's meet-record 6-10 :i + jump,
won the 440 relay, and placed 1-2
in the 440 as Cal's Forrest Beaty
upset teammate Dave Archibald
in 47.6 seconds. That gave Cal a

30 20 lead, as the Straw Hat Band
whooped it up.
Then Walsh and Questad took
over. Walsh won the broad jump
and led a blanket finish Stanford
sweep in the high hurdles, with
Greg Ford and Rick Scherer fol
lowing. A Tribe sweep in the 100
plus Eshelman's victory boosted
Stanford back into a 52-34 advant
age, and the Indians gradually
pulled away.
The team victory accomplished
two things. It broke a two meet
losing streak for Stanford, and it
killed the melodrama which would
have surrounded an upset vic
tory by outgoing Cal Coach Bru
tus Hamilton, After 33 years at
Berkeley, Hamilton was eulogized
in pre-meet ceremonies, and the
Bears had vowed a "win one for
the C.ipper" pledge.
At first il appeared that psy
chology might win the meet for
Cal, as five Bears posted best-of
life performances. However, for
tunately for the Tribe, the race is
to the swift and the mighty, and
ai least in this case, class told.
Frosli Sweep 5 Events
It probably will next year, also.
Stanford's freshman won the
most lopsided Little Big Meet in
recent memory. The frosh swept

elin. The seven field events were
held first, and the frosh won six
of the seven, piling up a 48-15
lead. The Papooses won the
sprints, 32-5, for a massive 80-20
lead.
Five freshmen scored nearly as
many points as the whole Cal
team. Chuck Schembra won the
shot put by a half-inch on his last
throw, at 49-4'-, and also cap

lured the discus at 150-4, Craig
Vaughn won both the broad jump
and triple jump, with leaps of
22-1 Hand 42-4',.
Martin. Ward Win
