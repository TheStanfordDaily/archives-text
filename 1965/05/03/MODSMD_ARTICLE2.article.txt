# Con Home Campaign Cleans Up
## Doda, Wilde Child Aid Charity Drive 
### 
Dog biscuits, cold porridge,
pickles, Carol Doda, and an un
identified Palo Alto High School
girl all contributed to what Mr.
James 11. McCracken. in charge
of fund-raising for tho Stanford
Convalescent Home, called '"the
best Con Home drive in 41 years."
Dr. Douglass Wilde. "Red Hot
Prof" of last fall, crowned the
Phi Delt's dog, Gretchen, with a
dog biscuit crown and dubbed
Les "YVallaman'' Martin, new Con
Home King, "Clark Bent" in view
of his "supernatural ability," at
the Con Home Carnival at Sears
ville Lake last Friday. "The wild
child," Dr. Wilde's blond one-year
old son Nick, led the crowd in a
nursery rhyme cheer of "Peas
porridge hot, jK'as porridge cold,"
etc., which was followed by cries
of "food service!"
Doda's Dance
The most popular part of the
Carnival was the exhibition of
modern dance put on by attractive
San Francisco night club enter
tainer Carol Doda.
Her act was followed by a vol
unteer rendition of the same
dance by a girl from Palo Alto
High School, although this second
act drew somewhat less enthusi
astic response from the crowd. A
beer chugging eonlest, won by
the Theta Xi's, and a car bash
that ended in flames rounded out
the days activities.
The Henry Mancini Concert at
Frost Amphitheater Saturday
night drew a large crowd and
netted some $2,000 for the Con
Home. Early pessimism was re
lieved by heavy sales at the ticket
office just before show time.
Profitable Booth
In the contest for the most
money raised by on-eampus proj
ects. Adclpha's ice cream booth
was the most profitable. Coming
in behind Adelpha were such ef
forts as Stern Hall men selling
"Wo Try Harder" buttons. Roble
girls selling fortune cookies, a
house in Lagunita selling bal
loons, and other living groups
offering such things as cotton
candy and pickles.
The Carnival sold $."500 worth
of tickets and $1,800 in pennies
were collected in the voting for
the Con Home King and Queen, at
a penny a vote. The proceeds of
last Sunday's Hydrofollies have
not yet been tabulated.
