## The 						Liberal Education 
### 
"Seek to be educated not trained"
John F. Kennedy
DONALD If. HEKMANN
The word education is derived
from the Latin educere meaning)
"to bring or draw forth." This
meaning of the word makes it j
plain that education is not to be!
confused with a garment to be
put on whenever it is expedient j
or profitable. Always the point of j
critical concern must be the ef
fectiveness with which the in-1
dividual draws forth his utmost !
potential.
Education today is commonly
defined in terms of professional!
preparation and program comple- j
tion. The undergraduate student
too often measures his educa-1
tional advancement in terms of
fulfilled General Studies require
ments, degree programs, or pre-1
professional training. It is only j
with great effort that many stu-l
dents overcome the struggle be
tween training and education, and j
overcome the restrictive conceptj
of education enforced by institu-!
tional prescriptions. Education be-;
gins with an awareness Ihat neith
er the acquisition of a profess
ional skill nor the mere posses
sion of a vast knowledge by it-j
self guarantees a liberal education.!
There is today a frightening de
gree of homogeneity and uniform-1
ity among students in their out
look, attitudes, and values. Siu
dents bear the imprint of ihe
mold of standardization which is
a consequence of their succumb-J
ing to institutional restrictions
and prefabricated programs. Only
a small deviant group mars the!
homogenization of student so
ciety.
Student's themselves bear much
of the responsibility for their con
dition for they are all too ready j
to succumb to peer norms. Ma
turation and self-confidence are I
the natural enemies of this group i
conformity. The real peril of the j
present system of "Liberal Edu-:
cation" is its standardization as a
component of higher education.
Programs such as the present
General Studies simply confirm j
oven more the standardization of
values and outlook that is occur
ing among students as a result of
the social pressures which oper- j
ate upon them.
Liberal Kducution
The original meaning of liberal
as used in the phrase liberal edu
cation meant "to be fitting orj
worthy of free birth." free not i
servile. In short! then, a liberal
education is one in which the in-;
dividual student is not pressed
into a mold, but enjoys the free
dom of growth in all possible
ways to the realizaton of his max
imum potential. For truly liberal
education, there is a need to in
dividualize and diversify pro- j
grams to meet individual student
nods and desires. Liberal educa
tion cannot be conceived in terms
of administration with the case of

punch cards; it must be conside
red in terms of the individual's
development. The student has not
become educated say in science
and its method by the completion
of seventeen units of specified
sciences or the filling in of four
punch card boxes, but rather
when he and a competent and in
terested adviser have surveyed
his appreciation of the scientific
method and the areas of scientific
development.
The whole problem of liberal
education rests upon a conception
of education itself. An educated
person is not one who has
amassed a large number of facts
which he has at his recall, nor is
he one who has completed a num
ber of course units. An educated
person is an interested person.
He is concerned with his society,
he wonders at the phenomena
which surround him, he is a per
son consumed in giving meaning
to his life. A liberally educated
person is one who has developed
a perspective or system, a way
of viewing life.
This system of education must
be chosen and defined by the in
dividual. The importance of de
cision making in curriculum se
lection cannot be over estimated.
The responsibility of the school
lies in the fostering of a free but
informed choice of courses and
program. Not by professional re
quirements, not by institutional
programs, but by a delineation of
course choices and areas of de
sired competence can the institu
tion foster this responsibility and
decision on the part of the stu
dent.
Four Year Program
The four year undergraduate
experience should be a time of
widening interests and deepening
concerns. A program such as the
undergraduate engineering major
which consumes so much of the
students academic load that many
are found to plan a five year un
dergraduate program in order to
achieve the breadth they desire
has no place in undergraduate ed
ucation. The post graduate pro
gram in law offers a more de
sirable arrangement. As a pre
paratory program it recommends
a liberal education upon which
the Law School bases its three
year professional training. A pro
fessional program should follow
and build upon undergraduate lib
eral education, not obstruct it.
Perhaps an optimal arrange
ment in undergraduate work is
offered by the history major
which has but one specific re
quirement but recommends a
breadth and depth of experience
in history as well as in other
areas while permitting individual
discretion in choice of electives,
permitting a broad educational
experience. The Humanities Hon
ors Program is another fine ex
ample of a structure conducive
lo liberal education. Through a
variety of lecture courses and

seminars, the student is exposed
both generally and in depth to a
variety of problems in literature
and philosophy, in the arts and
sciences. In his senior year, the
student chooses an area to ex
plore in depth; this exploration
serves as the basis for an essay
utilizing all the tools of critical
thought and experessive writing
which he has acquired during his
undergraduate experience.
An educated person is one who
is not. satisfied with the passive
acquisition of knowledge. Me
must constantly want to know
more. We truly learn only when
we want to know. This quality of
continually wanting to know is
essential to the broadening of the
base of knowledge on which the
liberal educated person tests the
values he lias established by his
study and upon which he bases
the judgments at which he ar
rives by disciplined reasoning. If
liberal education has any meaning
beyond the acquisition of skills or
the attainment of cultural ac
complishments, it is that the lib
erally educated person has been
taught to think, lo relate, to ra
tionalize, and to evaluate on the
basis of personal and cultural
standards of conduct, discipline,
and values. Education today re
quires a delicate balance between
learning in order to live and liv
ing in order to learn. A true
equilibrium is dependent upon the
individual's honest assessment of
his educational objectives and the
perseverance to achieve them de
spile institutional obstacle and
personal indolence.

liberal education has any meaning
beyond the acquisition of skills or

"Seek to be educated not trained"
John F. Kennedy
DONALD If. HEKMANN
The word education is derived
from the Latin educere meaning)
"to bring or draw forth." This
meaning of the word makes it j
plain that education is not to be!
confused with a garment to be
put on whenever it is expedient j
or profitable. Always the point of j
critical concern must be the ef
fectiveness with which the in-1
dividual draws forth his utmost !
potential.
Education today is commonly
defined in terms of professional!
preparation and program comple- j
tion. The undergraduate student
too often measures his educa-1
tional advancement in terms of
fulfilled General Studies require
ments, degree programs, or pre-1
professional training. It is only j
with great effort that many stu-l
dents overcome the struggle be
tween training and education, and j
overcome the restrictive conceptj
of education enforced by institu-!
tional prescriptions. Education be-;
gins with an awareness Ihat neith
er the acquisition of a profess
ional skill nor the mere posses
sion of a vast knowledge by it-j
self guarantees a liberal education.!
There is today a frightening de
gree of homogeneity and uniform-1
ity among students in their out
look, attitudes, and values. Siu
dents bear the imprint of ihe
mold of standardization which is
a consequence of their succumb-J
ing to institutional restrictions
and prefabricated programs. Only
a small deviant group mars the!
homogenization of student so
ciety.
Student's themselves bear much
of the responsibility for their con
dition for they are all too ready j
to succumb to peer norms. Ma
turation and self-confidence are I
the natural enemies of this group i
conformity. The real peril of the j
present system of "Liberal Edu-:
cation" is its standardization as a
component of higher education.
Programs such as the present
General Studies simply confirm j
oven more the standardization of
values and outlook that is occur
ing among students as a result of
the social pressures which oper- j
ate upon them.
Liberal Kducution
The original meaning of liberal
as used in the phrase liberal edu
cation meant "to be fitting orj
worthy of free birth." free not i
servile. In short! then, a liberal
education is one in which the in-;
dividual student is not pressed
into a mold, but enjoys the free
dom of growth in all possible
ways to the realizaton of his max
imum potential. For truly liberal
education, there is a need to in
dividualize and diversify pro- j
grams to meet individual student
nods and desires. Liberal educa
tion cannot be conceived in terms
of administration with the case of

punch cards; it must be conside
red in terms of the individual's
development. The student has not
become educated say in science
and its method by the completion
of seventeen units of specified
sciences or the filling in of four
punch card boxes, but rather
when he and a competent and in
terested adviser have surveyed
his appreciation of the scientific
method and the areas of scientific
development.
The whole problem of liberal
education rests upon a conception
of education itself. An educated
person is not one who has
amassed a large number of facts
which he has at his recall, nor is
he one who has completed a num
ber of course units. An educated
person is an interested person.
He is concerned with his society,
he wonders at the phenomena
which surround him, he is a per
son consumed in giving meaning
to his life. A liberally educated
person is one who has developed
a perspective or system, a way
of viewing life.
This system of education must
be chosen and defined by the in
dividual. The importance of de
cision making in curriculum se
lection cannot be over estimated.
The responsibility of the school
lies in the fostering of a free but
informed choice of courses and
program. Not by professional re
quirements, not by institutional
programs, but by a delineation of
course choices and areas of de
sired competence can the institu
tion foster this responsibility and
decision on the part of the stu
dent.
Four Year Program
The four year undergraduate
experience should be a time of
widening interests and deepening
concerns. A program such as the
undergraduate engineering major
which consumes so much of the
students academic load that many
are found to plan a five year un
dergraduate program in order to
achieve the breadth they desire
has no place in undergraduate ed
ucation. The post graduate pro
gram in law offers a more de
sirable arrangement. As a pre
paratory program it recommends
a liberal education upon which
the Law School bases its three
year professional training. A pro
fessional program should follow
and build upon undergraduate lib
eral education, not obstruct it.
Perhaps an optimal arrange
ment in undergraduate work is
offered by the history major
which has but one specific re
quirement but recommends a
breadth and depth of experience
in history as well as in other
areas while permitting individual
discretion in choice of electives,
permitting a broad educational
experience. The Humanities Hon
ors Program is another fine ex
ample of a structure conducive
lo liberal education. Through a
variety of lecture courses and

seminars, the student is exposed
both generally and in depth to a
variety of problems in literature
and philosophy, in the arts and
sciences. In his senior year, the
student chooses an area to ex

serves as the basis for an essay

Four Year Program
The four year undergraduate
experience should be a time of
widening interests and deepening
concerns. A program such as the
undergraduate engineering major
which consumes so much of the
students academic load that many
are found to plan a five year un
dergraduate program in order to
achieve the breadth they desire
has no place in undergraduate ed
ucation. The post graduate pro
gram in law offers a more de
sirable arrangement. As a pre
paratory program it recommends
a liberal education upon which
the Law School bases its three
year professional training. A pro
fessional program should follow
and build upon undergraduate lib
eral education, not obstruct it.
Perhaps an optimal arrange
ment in undergraduate work is
offered by the history major
which has but one specific re
quirement but recommends a
breadth and depth of experience
in history as well as in other
areas while permitting individual
discretion in choice of electives,
permitting a broad educational
experience. The Humanities Hon
ors Program is another fine ex
ample of a structure conducive
lo liberal education. Through a
variety of lecture courses and

seminars, the student is exposed
both generally and in depth to a
variety of problems in literature
and philosophy, in the arts and
sciences. In his senior year, the
student chooses an area to ex
plore in depth; this exploration
serves as the basis for an essay
utilizing all the tools of critical
thought and experessive writing
which he has acquired during his
undergraduate experience.
An educated person is one who
is not. satisfied with the passive
acquisition of knowledge. Me
must constantly want to know
more. We truly learn only when
we want to know. This quality of
continually wanting to know is
essential to the broadening of the
base of knowledge on which the
liberal educated person tests the
values he lias established by his
study and upon which he bases
the judgments at which he ar
rives by disciplined reasoning. If
liberal education has any meaning
beyond the acquisition of skills or
the attainment of cultural ac
complishments, it is that the lib
erally educated person has been
taught to think, lo relate, to ra
tionalize, and to evaluate on the
basis of personal and cultural
standards of conduct, discipline,
and values. Education today re
quires a delicate balance between
learning in order to live and liv
ing in order to learn. A true
equilibrium is dependent upon the
individual's honest assessment of
his educational objectives and the
perseverance to achieve them de
spile institutional obstacle and
personal indolence.
"Seek to be educated not trained"
John F. Kennedy
DONALD If. HEKMANN
The word education is derived
from the Latin educere meaning)
"to bring or draw forth." This
meaning of the word makes it j
plain that education is not to be!
confused with a garment to be
put on whenever it is expedient j
or profitable. Always the point of j
critical concern must be the ef
fectiveness with which the in-1
dividual draws forth his utmost !
potential.
Education today is commonly
defined in terms of professional!
preparation and program comple- j
tion. The undergraduate student
too often measures his educa-1
tional advancement in terms of
fulfilled General Studies require
ments, degree programs, or pre-1
professional training. It is only j
with great effort that many stu-l
dents overcome the struggle be
tween training and education, and j
overcome the restrictive conceptj
of education enforced by institu-!
tional prescriptions. Education be-;
gins with an awareness Ihat neith
er the acquisition of a profess
ional skill nor the mere posses
sion of a vast knowledge by it-j
self guarantees a liberal education.!
There is today a frightening de
gree of homogeneity and uniform-1
ity among students in their out
look, attitudes, and values. Siu
dents bear the imprint of ihe
mold of standardization which is
a consequence of their succumb-J
ing to institutional restrictions
and prefabricated programs. Only
a small deviant group mars the!
homogenization of student so
ciety.
Student's themselves bear much
of the responsibility for their con
dition for they are all too ready j
to succumb to peer norms. Ma
turation and self-confidence are I
the natural enemies of this group i
conformity. The real peril of the j
present system of "Liberal Edu-:
cation" is its standardization as a
component of higher education.
Programs such as the present
General Studies simply confirm j
oven more the standardization of
values and outlook that is occur
ing among students as a result of
the social pressures which oper- j
ate upon them.
Liberal Kducution
The original meaning of liberal
as used in the phrase liberal edu
cation meant "to be fitting orj
worthy of free birth." free not i
servile. In short! then, a liberal
education is one in which the in-;
dividual student is not pressed
into a mold, but enjoys the free
dom of growth in all possible
ways to the realizaton of his max
imum potential. For truly liberal
education, there is a need to in
dividualize and diversify pro- j
grams to meet individual student
nods and desires. Liberal educa
tion cannot be conceived in terms
of administration with the case of

punch cards; it must be conside
red in terms of the individual's
development. The student has not
become educated say in science
and its method by the completion
of seventeen units of specified
sciences or the filling in of four
punch card boxes, but rather
when he and a competent and in
terested adviser have surveyed
his appreciation of the scientific
method and the areas of scientific
development.
The whole problem of liberal
education rests upon a conception
of education itself. An educated
person is not one who has
amassed a large number of facts
which he has at his recall, nor is
he one who has completed a num
ber of course units. An educated
person is an interested person.
He is concerned with his society,
he wonders at the phenomena
which surround him, he is a per
son consumed in giving meaning
to his life. A liberally educated
person is one who has developed
a perspective or system, a way
of viewing life.
This system of education must
be chosen and defined by the in
dividual. The importance of de
cision making in curriculum se
lection cannot be over estimated.
The responsibility of the school
lies in the fostering of a free but
informed choice of courses and
program. Not by professional re
quirements, not by institutional
programs, but by a delineation of
course choices and areas of de
sired competence can the institu

development. The student has not
become educated say in science
and its method by the completion
of seventeen units of specified
sciences or the filling in of four
punch card boxes, but rather
when he and a competent and in
terested adviser have surveyed
his appreciation of the scientific
method and the areas of scientific
development.
The whole problem of liberal
education rests upon a conception
of education itself. An educated
person is not one who has
amassed a large number of facts
which he has at his recall, nor is
he one who has completed a num
ber of course units. An educated
person is an interested person.
He is concerned with his society,
he wonders at the phenomena
which surround him, he is a per
son consumed in giving meaning
to his life. A liberally educated
person is one who has developed
a perspective or system, a way
of viewing life.
This system of education must
be chosen and defined by the in
dividual. The importance of de
cision making in curriculum se
lection cannot be over estimated.
The responsibility of the school
lies in the fostering of a free but
informed choice of courses and
program. Not by professional re
quirements, not by institutional
programs, but by a delineation of
course choices and areas of de
sired competence can the institu
tion foster this responsibility and
decision on the part of the stu
dent.
Four Year Program
The four year undergraduate
experience should be a time of
widening interests and deepening
concerns. A program such as the
undergraduate engineering major
which consumes so much of the
students academic load that many
are found to plan a five year un
dergraduate program in order to
achieve the breadth they desire
has no place in undergraduate ed
ucation. The post graduate pro
gram in law offers a more de
sirable arrangement. As a pre
paratory program it recommends
a liberal education upon which
the Law School bases its three
year professional training. A pro
fessional program should follow
and build upon undergraduate lib
eral education, not obstruct it.
Perhaps an optimal arrange
ment in undergraduate work is
offered by the history major
which has but one specific re
quirement but recommends a
breadth and depth of experience
in history as well as in other
areas while permitting individual
discretion in choice of electives,
permitting a broad educational
experience. The Humanities Hon
ors Program is another fine ex
ample of a structure conducive
lo liberal education. Through a
variety of lecture courses and

seminars, the student is exposed
both generally and in depth to a
variety of problems in literature
and philosophy, in the arts and
sciences. In his senior year, the
student chooses an area to ex
plore in depth; this exploration
serves as the basis for an essay
utilizing all the tools of critical
thought and experessive writing
which he has acquired during his
undergraduate experience.
An educated person is one who
is not. satisfied with the passive
acquisition of knowledge. Me
must constantly want to know
more. We truly learn only when
we want to know. This quality of
continually wanting to know is
essential to the broadening of the
base of knowledge on which the
liberal educated person tests the
values he lias established by his
study and upon which he bases
the judgments at which he ar
rives by disciplined reasoning. If
liberal education has any meaning
beyond the acquisition of skills or
the attainment of cultural ac
complishments, it is that the lib
erally educated person has been
taught to think, lo relate, to ra
tionalize, and to evaluate on the
basis of personal and cultural
standards of conduct, discipline,
and values. Education today re
quires a delicate balance between
learning in order to live and liv
ing in order to learn. A true
equilibrium is dependent upon the
individual's honest assessment of
his educational objectives and the
perseverance to achieve them de
spile institutional obstacle and
personal indolence.
