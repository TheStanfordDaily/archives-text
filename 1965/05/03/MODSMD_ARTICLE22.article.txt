## Purpose of Constitutional Amendment 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The purpose of the Constitu
tional Amendment to be voted on
today and tomorrow is simply
flexibility, i.e., to clear from the
formal structure of the Constitu
tion the encumbering demand of
determining the time of the Elec
tion of the Speaker of LASSU.
By deleting the words ". . . at
the beginning of the school year,"
we leave to our By-Laws, the de
termination of this time. If this
Constitutional Amendment
passes, the present By-Laws spe
cify that the Speaker be elected
during tlie Fall. Thus, nothing in
effect changes.
It is my intention to introduce
By-Laws that will change this
election to Spring of the previous
year. However, if these fail or if
in the future we decide to change
Ihese new By-Laws, we can
merely change the By-Laws and
not bother with another Consti
tutional change.

This amendment has the ap
proval of the Dean of the Law
School and Acting head of the
Political Science department fori
"form and style." Further it
passed LASSU unanimously, The
Election Reforms Committee
unanimously, and has the com
plete endorsement of the present
Speaker of the LASSU, Ed Shaw. !

• Sorry, iMr. Liu
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Liu (April 30*, I'm sorry
you are mistaken about Dr. Tur- |
pin and his Project Concern. Hav- |
ing talked personally and frankly
with him, I believe his speech on
"American Conscience in Viel
Nam" has misled you. First, let
me say thai Dr. Turpin is a doctor I
and a social workers not a for- j
eign affairs expert or a public
speaker. What is important about t
Project Concern has obviously i
not come through the doctor's'
speech. Let mo try to clear the air.
Dr. Turpin is the agent of no
one: church. State Department.
Medico, nor American Legion. He i
is in SE Asia for what he can do
for the sick and the destitute and
for the personal satisfaction it
provides him. He admits this "self
ish" motive. He passes out no
pamphlets, makes no sermons, |
shoots no Viet. Cong. He heals, i
That's a full-time job.
Dr. Turpin's religious beliefs
are no longer affiliated with any

church. His concepts of love and I
char i I y arc practiced, not!
preached, for the good of Vietna-!
mese, Vict Cong, Buddhist—Avho- i
ever comes to him for help. Com-i
muninities not only welcome him, !
they invite him.
Judging from your name, I j
would guess you have a more
than passing interest in Asian
affairs. Therefore, it is all the!
more unfortunate that you mis
understand the Project Concern, j
Had you heard Dr. Turpin's hon- i
estv and sincerity in a less formal !
atmosphere, I'm sure your opin- j
ion would be different. No Chris-1
tian Regime, nor "Free World"
propaganda Mr. Liu; just a little i
medical care and Concern here i
and there.

With regard to Friday's letter j
to Hie editor from the Executive
Board of the Viet-Nam Defense !
Committee I would like to make:
a small correction. Charles Conn
tee. a member of the Executive
Board of the VDC, is not a mem
ber of SNCC since SNCC is not
a membership organization. It is
equally true that he is not a.
SNCC staff worker. This should
be obvious if only for his views
on the situation in Viet-Nam.

• Sorry, iMr. Liu
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Liu (April 30*, I'm sorry
you are mistaken about Dr. Tur- |
pin and his Project Concern. Hav- |
ing talked personally and frankly
with him, I believe his speech on
"American Conscience in Viel
Nam" has misled you. First, let
me say thai Dr. Turpin is a doctor I
and a social workers not a for- j
eign affairs expert or a public
speaker. What is important about t
Project Concern has obviously i
not come through the doctor's'
speech. Let mo try to clear the air.
Dr. Turpin is the agent of no
one: church. State Department.
Medico, nor American Legion. He i
is in SE Asia for what he can do
for the sick and the destitute and
for the personal satisfaction it
provides him. He admits this "self
ish" motive. He passes out no
pamphlets, makes no sermons, |
shoots no Viet. Cong. He heals, i
That's a full-time job.
Dr. Turpin's religious beliefs
are no longer affiliated with any

church. His concepts of love and I
char i I y arc practiced, not!
preached, for the good of Vietna-!
mese, Vict Cong, Buddhist—Avho- i
ever comes to him for help. Com-i
muninities not only welcome him, !
they invite him.
Judging from your name, I j
would guess you have a more
than passing interest in Asian
affairs. Therefore, it is all the!
more unfortunate that you mis
understand the Project Concern, j
Had you heard Dr. Turpin's hon- i
estv and sincerity in a less formal !
atmosphere, I'm sure your opin- j
ion would be different. No Chris-1
tian Regime, nor "Free World"
propaganda Mr. Liu; just a little i
medical care and Concern here i
and there.

With regard to Friday's letter j
to Hie editor from the Executive
Board of the Viet-Nam Defense !
Committee I would like to make:
a small correction. Charles Conn
tee. a member of the Executive
Board of the VDC, is not a mem
ber of SNCC since SNCC is not
a membership organization. It is
equally true that he is not a.
SNCC staff worker. This should
be obvious if only for his views
on the situation in Viet-Nam.
RONALD KAUFMAN,

Editor, The Daily:
The purpose of the Constitu
tional Amendment to be voted on
today and tomorrow is simply
flexibility, i.e., to clear from the
formal structure of the Constitu
tion the encumbering demand of
determining the time of the Elec
tion of the Speaker of LASSU.
By deleting the words ". . . at
the beginning of the school year,"
we leave to our By-Laws, the de
termination of this time. If this
Constitutional Amendment
passes, the present By-Laws spe
cify that the Speaker be elected
during tlie Fall. Thus, nothing in
effect changes.
It is my intention to introduce
By-Laws that will change this
election to Spring of the previous
year. However, if these fail or if
in the future we decide to change
Ihese new By-Laws, we can
merely change the By-Laws and
not bother with another Consti
tutional change.

This amendment has the ap
proval of the Dean of the Law
School and Acting head of the
Political Science department fori
"form and style." Further it
passed LASSU unanimously, The
Election Reforms Committee
unanimously, and has the com
plete endorsement of the present
Speaker of the LASSU, Ed Shaw. !
