## 'Once Upon A Mattress’: Two Views 
### FOSTER HIRSCH JOHN THAYER 
"Once Upon a Mattress' is a very slight musical conieck nn 1 »icl 1
borrows its story from the fairy tale of "The Princess and the Pea.'
! With two or three exceptions, the songs are talky rather than tune
i ful, and the main plot line is so thin that the show has been padded
1 with several irrelevant sub-plots.

The deficiencies of the show it *
self, however, can be circum
vented by a east which inundates
its audience with charm and by
tight direction which drives the
pace forward at such a rate that
there is no time to fret about the
numerous inanities.
The Ilam's Head people, in their
present production, have camou
flaged the weaknesses of their
material in a ratio of about 51 per
cent success to 19 per cent failure, j
Handsome Production
High on the credit side are the
handsome pr o d u c t i on values |
which provide such an appro- j
priate atmosphere for a fable: the 1
imaginatively medieval sets of T.
J. McHose which manage to
create an illusion of dimension, i
the vivid costumes designed by'
John Pasqualetti, and the evoca
tive purples, yellows, and blues of
M. Edouard Chambreau's lighting.
Unfortunately, what transpires
in and around these accessories is
not always so bright as the acces
sories themselves. The show's
uneven quality is due largely to
Thomas Baechetti's d i r e e t i on j
which, most of the way, lacks pre- j
eision. This is particularly evident
in group scenes, where the timing j
lags and the movement is blurred, i
The courtiers and damsels are an •'
attractive bunch, but they have j
not been taught how to move as i
an ensemble.
The generally fuzzy direction is
also responsible for the overall,
lack of verve and sparkle, though
it may well be because of the
woefully poor acoustics of Me
morial Auditorium (an inhospit-1
able theatre if ever there was
one) that it appears no one on
stage is quite forceful enough. (
Throughout, the actors' voices
seem to be inadequate to the size
of the theatre.
Timing Off
At any rate, the director has |
not seen to it that the liming of j
his actors is unerringly split-sec-'
ond. There are too many holes,
too many dead spaces, and in thai j
barn of a theatre, these moments j
of uncertainty are magnified.
Aside from acoustical problems, j
there are some thoroughly agree-1

able performances. As the nasty,
domineering, chatterbox Queen,
Ruth Hunt takes full command of
the stage every time she appears.
She plays for all its worth the
acid wit and high-flown bitchiness
supplied to her by the dialogue,
and, as always, her skill is a
pleasure to watch.
Li/. Kuhn is completely at ease
in the role of Princess No. 13. Her
performance is derivative in bor
rowing heavily from the clownish,
mock-masculine mannerisms of
Carol Burnett (who created the
role), but this is exactly what the
part calls for. Miss Kuhn obvi
ously enjoys what she is doing
and she transmits her zany en
thusiasm to (he audience.
Put-l'pon Players
David Shookhoff is delightfully
animated as the mute, put-upon
King. Alan Mokler, who plays the
equally put-upon, spineless Prince
Dauntless, exudes an abundance
of natural charm, but his con
stant fidgeting, though apro
priate for his character, needs
some trimming.
The supporting roles are filled
by people who sing well but who
do not know how to stand still
on stage; the shuffling of feet and
the unspecified gestures become
quite distracting. Pat Deckert and
Karr Wolfe, stuck with the tedi
ous roles of the secondary lovers,
are particularly unsatisfactory.
Miss Deckert is a pretty girl with
a clear singing voice, but she is a
vapid actress, and Mr. Wolfe's
stiff artificiality is straight out of
the high school senior musical.
So that this reviewer may not
be accused of being altogether un
charitable as well as unappreeia
tive, let it be added that the show
as a whole will most likely be
more assured for tho remaining
performances. <As a matter of
fact, a friend of mine who saw
the show Saturday and whose
opinion I respect very much in
formed me irately that I was com
pletely wrong-headed: he said the
direction and the performances
were extremely spirited and that
the audience loved every minute
of it.)

Laments the chorus in "Once Upon a Mattress," "\\ eve an open
ing for a princess, for a genuine certified princess." Well, weep no
more, my ladies and gentlemen of the theater-going public: there
are definitely no openings for genuine, certified, A-nmnl>er-onc
musical productions around here anymore, because Ham's 1 lead luus

pulverized the competition ancM
emerged triumphant.
To get back to the poor chorus,
they're lamenting because they
can't get married until Prince
Dauntless gets married, a step
which his ever-lovin' mother,
Queen Aggravain, is hell-bent on
preventing. She welcomes each
prospective recipient of Daunt
less' hand with all the sweetness i
of a cat about to scratch, and de- j
lights in devising impossible suit- j
ability tests for them which even'
she couldn't pass.
Naturally, they can't either, so
Danuiless, who if not physically,
then mentally and emotionally, is
definitely prepuberty, spends i
most of his time crying on Moth-!
er's ample, and willing, bosom.
Delicate Conditions
Now all this wouldn't be so bad
were it not for a slight complica
tion. If Dauntless is not exactly
Casanova, then neither are his fel
low nobles at court exactly celi
bates; and unless some
fast acting is done, too many deli
cate conditions are going to be
come indecorously obvious for
comfort. So, Sir Harry, whose
Lady Larken is in a bad way,
rushes off and returns with Fred,
short for Princess Winnifred the
Woebegone, who swims the moat
and emerges, dripping, to an
nounce, "I'm shy!"
Queen Aggravain is not fooled
for a minute, however, and de
vises, with Wizard, a sensitivity
test guaranteed to succeed. Under
icath not one, but twenty, mat
tresses, she will place a single pea.
If Winnifred cannot sleep on ac
count of the ensuing annoyance,
then she is indeed a princess fit
for a Dauntless.
To make absolutely certain
Winnifred won't possibly wake,
devoted Mother runs the whole
court through something called
the "Spanish Panic," which only
by stretching a point could be
called a dance, and in comparison
with which the jerk positively
pales.
And Happily Ever After
Unfortunately, Jester and Min
strel, unbeknownst to all, have
conned the secret out of Wizard
and evened the odds by slipping,
among other things, a violin and a
battle-axe under the topmost mat
t ress.

Next morning, Fred is still
counting sheep, the Queen is sud
denly stricken with laryngitis,
and finally everybody can get
married, not a moment too soon,
either. The show itself ends more
than a moment too soon for the
audience, time for once having
slipped by almost too fast.
Congratulations upon this feat
are due first of all to Elizabeth
i Kuhn as Winnifred, who is equal
| ly adept at belting out "I'm shy!"
j and crooning "The Swamps of
Home." She occasionally sinks
into the foggy (and inaudible)
l)ottom of her voice, but that is a
miniscule flaw in the best per
formance of the entire show.
Professional Cast
And that is no mean achieve
' ment, for hot on her heels are the
rest of the cast, on masse and
; without doubt a professional
j bunch if ever there was one. In
j no particular order, Ruth Hunt is
! impeccably bitchy as Queen Ag
; gravain, and David Shoofhoff is
I eloquently silent as her bottom
| pinching King (don't ask why he
1 can't talk; go see the play). Alan
| Mokler, Dauntless, naive, sings
| well, and his foolishness has a
| startling amount of subtlety to it.
As Lady Larken, Pat ricia Dedt
! ert is pretty elegant, but it's her
! wonderfully clear, sweet voice
that upstages Sir Harry (J. Karr
i Wolfe) every time. In fact, her
"In a Little While" comes close
j to stealing the show.
Finally, Jim Anderson (Min
strel) and Peter Sly (Jester) are
las sneaky as their fine tenor
! voices are scarce that is, some
j where in the vicinity of hen's
teeth. Oh yes, and to Richard
l Grant, who trained the chorus, T.
: J. McHose, who designed the sets,
j Errol Gay, who conducted the ex*
■ pert orchestra, and Thomas Bac
i chetti, who directed, go more than
; a few verbal handclaps and this
| parting thought:
j Who needs an expensive reper
; tory theater when Ram's Head
: can produce a smash hit like
I "Once Upon a Mattress?" And
; will this imported talent be able
| to stand the local competition?
J Maybe, but it's going to take
j some doing.

Li/. Kuhn is completely at ease
in the role of Princess No. 13. Her
performance is derivative in bor
rowing heavily from the clownish,
mock-masculine mannerisms of
Carol Burnett (who created the
role), but this is exactly what the
part calls for. Miss Kuhn obvi
ously enjoys what she is doing
and she transmits her zany en
thusiasm to (he audience.
Put-l'pon Players
David Shookhoff is delightfully
animated as the mute, put-upon
King. Alan Mokler, who plays the
equally put-upon, spineless Prince
Dauntless, exudes an abundance
of natural charm, but his con
stant fidgeting, though apro
priate for his character, needs
some trimming.
The supporting roles are filled
by people who sing well but who
do not know how to stand still
on stage; the shuffling of feet and
the unspecified gestures become
quite distracting. Pat Deckert and
Karr Wolfe, stuck with the tedi
ous roles of the secondary lovers,
are particularly unsatisfactory.
Miss Deckert is a pretty girl with
a clear singing voice, but she is a
vapid actress, and Mr. Wolfe's
stiff artificiality is straight out of
the high school senior musical.
So that this reviewer may not
be accused of being altogether un
charitable as well as unappreeia
tive, let it be added that the show
as a whole will most likely be
more assured for tho remaining
performances. <As a matter of
fact, a friend of mine who saw
the show Saturday and whose
opinion I respect very much in
formed me irately that I was com
pletely wrong-headed: he said the
direction and the performances
were extremely spirited and that
the audience loved every minute
of it.)

Laments the chorus in "Once Upon a Mattress," "\\ eve an open
ing for a princess, for a genuine certified princess." Well, weep no
more, my ladies and gentlemen of the theater-going public: there
are definitely no openings for genuine, certified, A-nmnl>er-onc
musical productions around here anymore, because Ham's 1 lead luus

pulverized the competition ancM
emerged triumphant.
To get back to the poor chorus,
they're lamenting because they
can't get married until Prince
Dauntless gets married, a step
which his ever-lovin' mother,
Queen Aggravain, is hell-bent on
preventing. She welcomes each
prospective recipient of Daunt
less' hand with all the sweetness i
of a cat about to scratch, and de- j
lights in devising impossible suit- j
ability tests for them which even'
she couldn't pass.
Naturally, they can't either, so
Danuiless, who if not physically,
then mentally and emotionally, is
definitely prepuberty, spends i
most of his time crying on Moth-!
er's ample, and willing, bosom.
Delicate Conditions
Now all this wouldn't be so bad
were it not for a slight complica
tion. If Dauntless is not exactly
Casanova, then neither are his fel
low nobles at court exactly celi
bates; and unless some
fast acting is done, too many deli
cate conditions are going to be
come indecorously obvious for
comfort. So, Sir Harry, whose
Lady Larken is in a bad way,
rushes off and returns with Fred,
short for Princess Winnifred the
Woebegone, who swims the moat
and emerges, dripping, to an
nounce, "I'm shy!"
Queen Aggravain is not fooled
for a minute, however, and de
vises, with Wizard, a sensitivity
test guaranteed to succeed. Under
icath not one, but twenty, mat
tresses, she will place a single pea.
If Winnifred cannot sleep on ac
count of the ensuing annoyance,
then she is indeed a princess fit
for a Dauntless.
To make absolutely certain
Winnifred won't possibly wake,
devoted Mother runs the whole
court through something called
the "Spanish Panic," which only
by stretching a point could be
called a dance, and in comparison
with which the jerk positively
pales.
And Happily Ever After
Unfortunately, Jester and Min
strel, unbeknownst to all, have
conned the secret out of Wizard
and evened the odds by slipping,
among other things, a violin and a
battle-axe under the topmost mat
t ress.

Next morning, Fred is still
counting sheep, the Queen is sud
denly stricken with laryngitis,
and finally everybody can get
married, not a moment too soon,
either. The show itself ends more
than a moment too soon for the
audience, time for once having
slipped by almost too fast.
Congratulations upon this feat
are due first of all to Elizabeth
i Kuhn as Winnifred, who is equal
| ly adept at belting out "I'm shy!"
j and crooning "The Swamps of
Home." She occasionally sinks
into the foggy (and inaudible)
l)ottom of her voice, but that is a
miniscule flaw in the best per
formance of the entire show.
Professional Cast
And that is no mean achieve
' ment, for hot on her heels are the
rest of the cast, on masse and
; without doubt a professional
j bunch if ever there was one. In
j no particular order, Ruth Hunt is
! impeccably bitchy as Queen Ag
; gravain, and David Shoofhoff is
I eloquently silent as her bottom
| pinching King (don't ask why he
1 can't talk; go see the play). Alan
| Mokler, Dauntless, naive, sings
| well, and his foolishness has a
| startling amount of subtlety to it.
As Lady Larken, Pat ricia Dedt
! ert is pretty elegant, but it's her
! wonderfully clear, sweet voice
that upstages Sir Harry (J. Karr
i Wolfe) every time. In fact, her
"In a Little While" comes close
j to stealing the show.
Finally, Jim Anderson (Min
strel) and Peter Sly (Jester) are
las sneaky as their fine tenor
! voices are scarce that is, some
j where in the vicinity of hen's
teeth. Oh yes, and to Richard
l Grant, who trained the chorus, T.
: J. McHose, who designed the sets,
j Errol Gay, who conducted the ex*
■ pert orchestra, and Thomas Bac
i chetti, who directed, go more than
; a few verbal handclaps and this

j Who needs an expensive reper

: can produce a smash hit like
I "Once Upon a Mattress?" And
; will this imported talent be able
| to stand the local competition?
J Maybe, but it's going to take
j some doing.
"Once Upon a Mattress' is a very slight musical conieck nn 1 »icl 1
borrows its story from the fairy tale of "The Princess and the Pea.'
! With two or three exceptions, the songs are talky rather than tune
i ful, and the main plot line is so thin that the show has been padded
1 with several irrelevant sub-plots.

The deficiencies of the show it *
self, however, can be circum
vented by a east which inundates
its audience with charm and by
tight direction which drives the
pace forward at such a rate that
there is no time to fret about the
numerous inanities.
The Ilam's Head people, in their
present production, have camou
flaged the weaknesses of their
material in a ratio of about 51 per
cent success to 19 per cent failure, j
Handsome Production
High on the credit side are the
handsome pr o d u c t i on values |
which provide such an appro- j
priate atmosphere for a fable: the 1
imaginatively medieval sets of T.
J. McHose which manage to
create an illusion of dimension, i
the vivid costumes designed by'
John Pasqualetti, and the evoca
tive purples, yellows, and blues of
M. Edouard Chambreau's lighting.
Unfortunately, what transpires
in and around these accessories is
not always so bright as the acces
sories themselves. The show's
uneven quality is due largely to
Thomas Baechetti's d i r e e t i on j
which, most of the way, lacks pre- j
eision. This is particularly evident
in group scenes, where the timing j
lags and the movement is blurred, i
The courtiers and damsels are an •'
attractive bunch, but they have j
not been taught how to move as i
an ensemble.
The generally fuzzy direction is
also responsible for the overall,
lack of verve and sparkle, though
it may well be because of the
woefully poor acoustics of Me
morial Auditorium (an inhospit-1
able theatre if ever there was
one) that it appears no one on
stage is quite forceful enough. (
Throughout, the actors' voices
seem to be inadequate to the size
of the theatre.
Timing Off
At any rate, the director has |
not seen to it that the liming of j
his actors is unerringly split-sec-'
ond. There are too many holes,
too many dead spaces, and in thai j
barn of a theatre, these moments j
of uncertainty are magnified.
Aside from acoustical problems, j
there are some thoroughly agree-1

able performances. As the nasty,
domineering, chatterbox Queen,
Ruth Hunt takes full command of
the stage every time she appears.
She plays for all its worth the

most of his time crying on Moth-!
er's ample, and willing, bosom.
Delicate Conditions
Now all this wouldn't be so bad
were it not for a slight complica
tion. If Dauntless is not exactly
Casanova, then neither are his fel
low nobles at court exactly celi
bates; and unless some
fast acting is done, too many deli
cate conditions are going to be
come indecorously obvious for
comfort. So, Sir Harry, whose
Lady Larken is in a bad way,
rushes off and returns with Fred,
short for Princess Winnifred the
Woebegone, who swims the moat
and emerges, dripping, to an
nounce, "I'm shy!"
Queen Aggravain is not fooled
for a minute, however, and de
vises, with Wizard, a sensitivity
test guaranteed to succeed. Under
icath not one, but twenty, mat
tresses, she will place a single pea.
If Winnifred cannot sleep on ac
count of the ensuing annoyance,
then she is indeed a princess fit
for a Dauntless.
To make absolutely certain
Winnifred won't possibly wake,
devoted Mother runs the whole
court through something called
the "Spanish Panic," which only
by stretching a point could be
called a dance, and in comparison
with which the jerk positively
pales.
And Happily Ever After
Unfortunately, Jester and Min
strel, unbeknownst to all, have
conned the secret out of Wizard
and evened the odds by slipping,
among other things, a violin and a
battle-axe under the topmost mat
t ress.

Next morning, Fred is still
counting sheep, the Queen is sud
denly stricken with laryngitis,
and finally everybody can get
married, not a moment too soon,
either. The show itself ends more
than a moment too soon for the
audience, time for once having
slipped by almost too fast.
Congratulations upon this feat
are due first of all to Elizabeth
i Kuhn as Winnifred, who is equal
| ly adept at belting out "I'm shy!"
j and crooning "The Swamps of
Home." She occasionally sinks
into the foggy (and inaudible)
l)ottom of her voice, but that is a
miniscule flaw in the best per
formance of the entire show.
Professional Cast
And that is no mean achieve
' ment, for hot on her heels are the
rest of the cast, on masse and
; without doubt a professional
j bunch if ever there was one. In
j no particular order, Ruth Hunt is
! impeccably bitchy as Queen Ag
; gravain, and David Shoofhoff is
I eloquently silent as her bottom
| pinching King (don't ask why he
1 can't talk; go see the play). Alan
| Mokler, Dauntless, naive, sings
| well, and his foolishness has a
| startling amount of subtlety to it.
As Lady Larken, Pat ricia Dedt
! ert is pretty elegant, but it's her
! wonderfully clear, sweet voice
that upstages Sir Harry (J. Karr
i Wolfe) every time. In fact, her
"In a Little While" comes close
j to stealing the show.
Finally, Jim Anderson (Min
strel) and Peter Sly (Jester) are
las sneaky as their fine tenor
! voices are scarce that is, some
j where in the vicinity of hen's
teeth. Oh yes, and to Richard
l Grant, who trained the chorus, T.
: J. McHose, who designed the sets,
j Errol Gay, who conducted the ex*
■ pert orchestra, and Thomas Bac
i chetti, who directed, go more than
; a few verbal handclaps and this

j Who needs an expensive reper
; tory theater when Ram's Head
: can produce a smash hit like
I "Once Upon a Mattress?" And
; will this imported talent be able
| to stand the local competition?
J Maybe, but it's going to take
j some doing.
"Once Upon a Mattress' is a very slight musical conieck nn 1 »icl 1
borrows its story from the fairy tale of "The Princess and the Pea.'
! With two or three exceptions, the songs are talky rather than tune
i ful, and the main plot line is so thin that the show has been padded
1 with several irrelevant sub-plots.

The deficiencies of the show it *
self, however, can be circum
vented by a east which inundates
its audience with charm and by
tight direction which drives the
pace forward at such a rate that
there is no time to fret about the
numerous inanities.
The Ilam's Head people, in their
present production, have camou
flaged the weaknesses of their
material in a ratio of about 51 per
cent success to 19 per cent failure, j
Handsome Production
High on the credit side are the
handsome pr o d u c t i on values |
which provide such an appro- j
priate atmosphere for a fable: the 1
imaginatively medieval sets of T.
J. McHose which manage to
create an illusion of dimension, i
the vivid costumes designed by'
John Pasqualetti, and the evoca
tive purples, yellows, and blues of
M. Edouard Chambreau's lighting.
Unfortunately, what transpires
in and around these accessories is
not always so bright as the acces
sories themselves. The show's
uneven quality is due largely to
Thomas Baechetti's d i r e e t i on j
which, most of the way, lacks pre- j
eision. This is particularly evident
in group scenes, where the timing j
lags and the movement is blurred, i
The courtiers and damsels are an •'
attractive bunch, but they have j
not been taught how to move as i
an ensemble.
The generally fuzzy direction is
also responsible for the overall,
lack of verve and sparkle, though
it may well be because of the
woefully poor acoustics of Me
morial Auditorium (an inhospit-1
able theatre if ever there was
one) that it appears no one on
stage is quite forceful enough. (
Throughout, the actors' voices
seem to be inadequate to the size
of the theatre.
Timing Off
At any rate, the director has |
not seen to it that the liming of j
his actors is unerringly split-sec-'
ond. There are too many holes,
too many dead spaces, and in thai j
barn of a theatre, these moments j
of uncertainty are magnified.
Aside from acoustical problems, j
there are some thoroughly agree-1

able performances. As the nasty,
domineering, chatterbox Queen,
Ruth Hunt takes full command of
the stage every time she appears.
She plays for all its worth the
acid wit and high-flown bitchiness
supplied to her by the dialogue,
and, as always, her skill is a
pleasure to watch.
Li/. Kuhn is completely at ease
in the role of Princess No. 13. Her
performance is derivative in bor
rowing heavily from the clownish,
mock-masculine mannerisms of
Carol Burnett (who created the
role), but this is exactly what the
part calls for. Miss Kuhn obvi
ously enjoys what she is doing
and she transmits her zany en
thusiasm to (he audience.
Put-l'pon Players
David Shookhoff is delightfully
animated as the mute, put-upon
King. Alan Mokler, who plays the
equally put-upon, spineless Prince
Dauntless, exudes an abundance
of natural charm, but his con
stant fidgeting, though apro
priate for his character, needs
some trimming.
The supporting roles are filled
by people who sing well but who
do not know how to stand still
on stage; the shuffling of feet and
the unspecified gestures become
quite distracting. Pat Deckert and
Karr Wolfe, stuck with the tedi
ous roles of the secondary lovers,
are particularly unsatisfactory.
Miss Deckert is a pretty girl with
a clear singing voice, but she is a
vapid actress, and Mr. Wolfe's
stiff artificiality is straight out of
the high school senior musical.
So that this reviewer may not
be accused of being altogether un
charitable as well as unappreeia
tive, let it be added that the show
as a whole will most likely be
more assured for tho remaining
performances. <As a matter of
fact, a friend of mine who saw
the show Saturday and whose
opinion I respect very much in
formed me irately that I was com
pletely wrong-headed: he said the
direction and the performances
were extremely spirited and that
the audience loved every minute
of it.)

Laments the chorus in "Once Upon a Mattress," "\\ eve an open

are definitely no openings for genuine, certified, A-nmnl>er-onc
musical productions around here anymore, because Ham's 1 lead luus

pulverized the competition ancM
emerged triumphant.
To get back to the poor chorus,
they're lamenting because they
can't get married until Prince
Dauntless gets married, a step
which his ever-lovin' mother,
Queen Aggravain, is hell-bent on
preventing. She welcomes each
prospective recipient of Daunt
less' hand with all the sweetness i
of a cat about to scratch, and de- j
lights in devising impossible suit- j
ability tests for them which even'
she couldn't pass.
Naturally, they can't either, so
Danuiless, who if not physically,
then mentally and emotionally, is
definitely prepuberty, spends i
most of his time crying on Moth-!

Handsome Production
High on the credit side are the
handsome pr o d u c t i on values |
which provide such an appro- j
priate atmosphere for a fable: the 1
imaginatively medieval sets of T.
J. McHose which manage to
create an illusion of dimension, i
the vivid costumes designed by'
John Pasqualetti, and the evoca
tive purples, yellows, and blues of
M. Edouard Chambreau's lighting.
Unfortunately, what transpires
in and around these accessories is
not always so bright as the acces
sories themselves. The show's
uneven quality is due largely to
Thomas Baechetti's d i r e e t i on j
which, most of the way, lacks pre- j
eision. This is particularly evident
in group scenes, where the timing j
lags and the movement is blurred, i
The courtiers and damsels are an •'
attractive bunch, but they have j
not been taught how to move as i
an ensemble.
The generally fuzzy direction is
also responsible for the overall,
lack of verve and sparkle, though
it may well be because of the
woefully poor acoustics of Me
morial Auditorium (an inhospit-1
able theatre if ever there was
one) that it appears no one on
stage is quite forceful enough. (
Throughout, the actors' voices
seem to be inadequate to the size
of the theatre.
Timing Off
At any rate, the director has |
not seen to it that the liming of j
his actors is unerringly split-sec-'
ond. There are too many holes,
too many dead spaces, and in thai j
barn of a theatre, these moments j
of uncertainty are magnified.
Aside from acoustical problems, j
there are some thoroughly agree-1

able performances. As the nasty,
domineering, chatterbox Queen,
Ruth Hunt takes full command of
the stage every time she appears.
She plays for all its worth the
acid wit and high-flown bitchiness
supplied to her by the dialogue,
and, as always, her skill is a
pleasure to watch.
Li/. Kuhn is completely at ease
in the role of Princess No. 13. Her
performance is derivative in bor
rowing heavily from the clownish,
mock-masculine mannerisms of
Carol Burnett (who created the
role), but this is exactly what the
part calls for. Miss Kuhn obvi
ously enjoys what she is doing
and she transmits her zany en
thusiasm to (he audience.
Put-l'pon Players
David Shookhoff is delightfully
animated as the mute, put-upon
King. Alan Mokler, who plays the
equally put-upon, spineless Prince
Dauntless, exudes an abundance
of natural charm, but his con
stant fidgeting, though apro
priate for his character, needs
some trimming.
The supporting roles are filled
by people who sing well but who
do not know how to stand still
on stage; the shuffling of feet and
the unspecified gestures become
quite distracting. Pat Deckert and
Karr Wolfe, stuck with the tedi
ous roles of the secondary lovers,
are particularly unsatisfactory.
Miss Deckert is a pretty girl with
a clear singing voice, but she is a
vapid actress, and Mr. Wolfe's
stiff artificiality is straight out of
the high school senior musical.
So that this reviewer may not
be accused of being altogether un
charitable as well as unappreeia
tive, let it be added that the show
as a whole will most likely be
more assured for tho remaining
performances. <As a matter of
fact, a friend of mine who saw
the show Saturday and whose
opinion I respect very much in
formed me irately that I was com
pletely wrong-headed: he said the
direction and the performances
were extremely spirited and that
the audience loved every minute
of it.)

Laments the chorus in "Once Upon a Mattress," "\\ eve an open
ing for a princess, for a genuine certified princess." Well, weep no
more, my ladies and gentlemen of the theater-going public: there
are definitely no openings for genuine, certified, A-nmnl>er-onc
musical productions around here anymore, because Ham's 1 lead luus

pulverized the competition ancM
emerged triumphant.
To get back to the poor chorus,
they're lamenting because they
can't get married until Prince
Dauntless gets married, a step
which his ever-lovin' mother,
Queen Aggravain, is hell-bent on
preventing. She welcomes each
prospective recipient of Daunt
less' hand with all the sweetness i
of a cat about to scratch, and de- j
lights in devising impossible suit- j
ability tests for them which even'
she couldn't pass.
Naturally, they can't either, so
Danuiless, who if not physically,
then mentally and emotionally, is
definitely prepuberty, spends i
most of his time crying on Moth-!
er's ample, and willing, bosom.
Delicate Conditions
Now all this wouldn't be so bad
were it not for a slight complica
tion. If Dauntless is not exactly
Casanova, then neither are his fel
low nobles at court exactly celi
bates; and unless some
fast acting is done, too many deli
cate conditions are going to be
come indecorously obvious for
comfort. So, Sir Harry, whose
Lady Larken is in a bad way,
rushes off and returns with Fred,
short for Princess Winnifred the
Woebegone, who swims the moat
and emerges, dripping, to an
nounce, "I'm shy!"
Queen Aggravain is not fooled
for a minute, however, and de
vises, with Wizard, a sensitivity
test guaranteed to succeed. Under
icath not one, but twenty, mat
tresses, she will place a single pea.
If Winnifred cannot sleep on ac
count of the ensuing annoyance,
then she is indeed a princess fit
for a Dauntless.
To make absolutely certain
Winnifred won't possibly wake,
devoted Mother runs the whole
court through something called
the "Spanish Panic," which only
by stretching a point could be
called a dance, and in comparison
with which the jerk positively
pales.
And Happily Ever After
Unfortunately, Jester and Min
strel, unbeknownst to all, have
conned the secret out of Wizard
and evened the odds by slipping,
among other things, a violin and a
battle-axe under the topmost mat
t ress.

Next morning, Fred is still
counting sheep, the Queen is sud
denly stricken with laryngitis,
and finally everybody can get
married, not a moment too soon,
either. The show itself ends more
than a moment too soon for the
audience, time for once having
slipped by almost too fast.
Congratulations upon this feat
are due first of all to Elizabeth
i Kuhn as Winnifred, who is equal
| ly adept at belting out "I'm shy!"
j and crooning "The Swamps of
Home." She occasionally sinks
into the foggy (and inaudible)
l)ottom of her voice, but that is a
miniscule flaw in the best per
formance of the entire show.
Professional Cast
And that is no mean achieve
' ment, for hot on her heels are the
rest of the cast, on masse and
; without doubt a professional
j bunch if ever there was one. In
j no particular order, Ruth Hunt is
! impeccably bitchy as Queen Ag
; gravain, and David Shoofhoff is

an ensemble.
The generally fuzzy direction is
also responsible for the overall,
lack of verve and sparkle, though
it may well be because of the
woefully poor acoustics of Me
morial Auditorium (an inhospit-1
able theatre if ever there was
one) that it appears no one on
stage is quite forceful enough. (
Throughout, the actors' voices
seem to be inadequate to the size
of the theatre.
Timing Off
At any rate, the director has |
not seen to it that the liming of j
his actors is unerringly split-sec-'
ond. There are too many holes,
too many dead spaces, and in thai j
barn of a theatre, these moments j
of uncertainty are magnified.
Aside from acoustical problems, j
there are some thoroughly agree-1

able performances. As the nasty,
domineering, chatterbox Queen,
Ruth Hunt takes full command of
the stage every time she appears.
She plays for all its worth the
acid wit and high-flown bitchiness
supplied to her by the dialogue,
and, as always, her skill is a
pleasure to watch.
Li/. Kuhn is completely at ease
in the role of Princess No. 13. Her
performance is derivative in bor
rowing heavily from the clownish,
mock-masculine mannerisms of
Carol Burnett (who created the
role), but this is exactly what the
part calls for. Miss Kuhn obvi
ously enjoys what she is doing
and she transmits her zany en
thusiasm to (he audience.
Put-l'pon Players
David Shookhoff is delightfully
animated as the mute, put-upon
King. Alan Mokler, who plays the
equally put-upon, spineless Prince
Dauntless, exudes an abundance
of natural charm, but his con
stant fidgeting, though apro
priate for his character, needs
some trimming.
The supporting roles are filled
by people who sing well but who
do not know how to stand still
on stage; the shuffling of feet and
the unspecified gestures become
quite distracting. Pat Deckert and
Karr Wolfe, stuck with the tedi
ous roles of the secondary lovers,
are particularly unsatisfactory.
Miss Deckert is a pretty girl with
a clear singing voice, but she is a
vapid actress, and Mr. Wolfe's
stiff artificiality is straight out of
the high school senior musical.
So that this reviewer may not
be accused of being altogether un
charitable as well as unappreeia
tive, let it be added that the show
as a whole will most likely be
more assured for tho remaining
performances. <As a matter of
fact, a friend of mine who saw
the show Saturday and whose
opinion I respect very much in
formed me irately that I was com
pletely wrong-headed: he said the
direction and the performances
were extremely spirited and that
the audience loved every minute
of it.)

Laments the chorus in "Once Upon a Mattress," "\\ eve an open
ing for a princess, for a genuine certified princess." Well, weep no
more, my ladies and gentlemen of the theater-going public: there
are definitely no openings for genuine, certified, A-nmnl>er-onc
musical productions around here anymore, because Ham's 1 lead luus

pulverized the competition ancM
emerged triumphant.
To get back to the poor chorus,
they're lamenting because they
can't get married until Prince
Dauntless gets married, a step
which his ever-lovin' mother,
Queen Aggravain, is hell-bent on
preventing. She welcomes each
prospective recipient of Daunt
less' hand with all the sweetness i
of a cat about to scratch, and de- j
lights in devising impossible suit- j
ability tests for them which even'
she couldn't pass.
Naturally, they can't either, so
Danuiless, who if not physically,
then mentally and emotionally, is
definitely prepuberty, spends i
most of his time crying on Moth-!
er's ample, and willing, bosom.
Delicate Conditions
Now all this wouldn't be so bad
were it not for a slight complica
tion. If Dauntless is not exactly
Casanova, then neither are his fel
low nobles at court exactly celi
bates; and unless some
fast acting is done, too many deli
cate conditions are going to be
come indecorously obvious for
comfort. So, Sir Harry, whose
Lady Larken is in a bad way,
rushes off and returns with Fred,
short for Princess Winnifred the
Woebegone, who swims the moat
and emerges, dripping, to an
nounce, "I'm shy!"
Queen Aggravain is not fooled
for a minute, however, and de
vises, with Wizard, a sensitivity
test guaranteed to succeed. Under
icath not one, but twenty, mat
tresses, she will place a single pea.
If Winnifred cannot sleep on ac
count of the ensuing annoyance,
then she is indeed a princess fit
for a Dauntless.
To make absolutely certain
Winnifred won't possibly wake,
devoted Mother runs the whole
court through something called
the "Spanish Panic," which only
by stretching a point could be
called a dance, and in comparison
with which the jerk positively
pales.
And Happily Ever After
Unfortunately, Jester and Min
strel, unbeknownst to all, have
conned the secret out of Wizard
and evened the odds by slipping,
among other things, a violin and a
battle-axe under the topmost mat
t ress.

Next morning, Fred is still
counting sheep, the Queen is sud
denly stricken with laryngitis,
and finally everybody can get
married, not a moment too soon,
either. The show itself ends more
than a moment too soon for the
audience, time for once having
slipped by almost too fast.
Congratulations upon this feat
are due first of all to Elizabeth
i Kuhn as Winnifred, who is equal
| ly adept at belting out "I'm shy!"
j and crooning "The Swamps of
Home." She occasionally sinks
into the foggy (and inaudible)
l)ottom of her voice, but that is a
miniscule flaw in the best per
formance of the entire show.
Professional Cast
And that is no mean achieve
' ment, for hot on her heels are the
rest of the cast, on masse and
; without doubt a professional
j bunch if ever there was one. In
j no particular order, Ruth Hunt is
! impeccably bitchy as Queen Ag
; gravain, and David Shoofhoff is
I eloquently silent as her bottom
| pinching King (don't ask why he
1 can't talk; go see the play). Alan
| Mokler, Dauntless, naive, sings
| well, and his foolishness has a
| startling amount of subtlety to it.
As Lady Larken, Pat ricia Dedt
! ert is pretty elegant, but it's her
! wonderfully clear, sweet voice
that upstages Sir Harry (J. Karr
i Wolfe) every time. In fact, her
"In a Little While" comes close
j to stealing the show.
Finally, Jim Anderson (Min
strel) and Peter Sly (Jester) are
las sneaky as their fine tenor
! voices are scarce that is, some
j where in the vicinity of hen's
teeth. Oh yes, and to Richard
l Grant, who trained the chorus, T.
: J. McHose, who designed the sets,
j Errol Gay, who conducted the ex*
■ pert orchestra, and Thomas Bac
i chetti, who directed, go more than
; a few verbal handclaps and this
| parting thought:
j Who needs an expensive reper
; tory theater when Ram's Head
: can produce a smash hit like
I "Once Upon a Mattress?" And
; will this imported talent be able
| to stand the local competition?
J Maybe, but it's going to take
j some doing.
"Once Upon a Mattress' is a very slight musical conieck nn 1 »icl 1
borrows its story from the fairy tale of "The Princess and the Pea.'
! With two or three exceptions, the songs are talky rather than tune
i ful, and the main plot line is so thin that the show has been padded
1 with several irrelevant sub-plots.

The deficiencies of the show it *
self, however, can be circum
vented by a east which inundates
its audience with charm and by
tight direction which drives the
pace forward at such a rate that
there is no time to fret about the
numerous inanities.
The Ilam's Head people, in their
present production, have camou
flaged the weaknesses of their
material in a ratio of about 51 per
cent success to 19 per cent failure, j
Handsome Production
High on the credit side are the
handsome pr o d u c t i on values |
which provide such an appro- j
priate atmosphere for a fable: the 1
imaginatively medieval sets of T.
J. McHose which manage to
create an illusion of dimension, i
the vivid costumes designed by'
John Pasqualetti, and the evoca
tive purples, yellows, and blues of
M. Edouard Chambreau's lighting.
Unfortunately, what transpires
in and around these accessories is
not always so bright as the acces
sories themselves. The show's
uneven quality is due largely to
Thomas Baechetti's d i r e e t i on j
which, most of the way, lacks pre- j
eision. This is particularly evident
in group scenes, where the timing j
lags and the movement is blurred, i
The courtiers and damsels are an •'
attractive bunch, but they have j
not been taught how to move as i
an ensemble.
The generally fuzzy direction is
also responsible for the overall,
lack of verve and sparkle, though
it may well be because of the
