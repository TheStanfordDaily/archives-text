TOURS, France - Criticism of
United States policy in Vietnam, j
now a hi mode in France, has i

reached the front door of Stan
ford in France in a rather messy
form.
Vandals early Tuesday morn

. ing defaced the facade of the
overseas campus building here
| with swastikas and critical re
! marks.

Picluicd above is one of fhc walls of the
Stanford Oversea*.. StuHy Centet it) Tou's,

Franco. The centn wui vandalized by oppo
nents ol American Vietnam policy.

The tar-inscribed comments in
clude "Vive Le Viet-Cong So
cialiste," "U.S. â€” 5.5.." and "U.S.
Assassins." The incident was
the first of its kind at the cam
pus, according to Director Paul Le
Moal.
The protest was not, however,
directed entirely at the Stanford
community, if at all, Le Moal
said. Other buildings in the area
were similarly defaced although
the brunt of the vandalism foil on
Stanford.
Vietnam Policy Opposed
The scarred sandstone walls
stand in sharp contrast to the
otherwise congenial reception ex
tended to Stanford students study
ing in Tours a small city some
150 miles southwest of Paris.
"Stanford has been extremely
well accepted by the entire popu
lation here," Le Moal stated.
Yet the protest was in line with
the predominant political senti
ment in France where, according
to Le Moal. "there is certainly a
majority opposed t<j the U.S. ac
tions in Vietnam."
I)<' (iuilllc Critical
In addition, both President
Charles de Gaulle and the French
press, has been highly critical of
American policy there.
Although the director doubts
either communists or students
are responsible for the vandalism,
leaflets published by the Cercles
Marxistes-Leninistes and circu
lated at the local university, con
tain many of the same remarks.
Police arc presently investigat
ing the incident but, as yet have
made no arrests. The marrings
will be removed by Le Centre Na
tional des Oeuvres Universitaircs
tie France, owner of Ihe building,
Le Mom J vaid.
