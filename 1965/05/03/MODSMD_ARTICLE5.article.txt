# Balloting Begins Today In Presidential Run-Offs
## 
### JIM HAUSER 
William "Sandy" MacKenzie and Dave liobbins, candidates
for ASSU President, are expected to draw a record turn-out today
and tomorrow as polls open for the ASSU election finals.
Last week's primary election brought a new high of 3641 votes.
John Caln'l], Chairman of the Elections Commission, said, "There

is usually a drop from primary to
final, bul it is hoped that such
apathy will not prevail today and
tomorrow."
Carl Schmidt, assistant cam
paign manager for MacKenzie,
said the most importance issue of
the election was the academic
question.
"This is the first time students
have had the chance to determine
academic affairs in the Univer
sity," Schmidt said. He believes
MacKenzie's record qualifies him
to represent students in academic
questions.
Morse Replies
On the other side of the fence,
Frank Morse, Vice-Presidential
running mate of Robbins, said the
"most important issue of this
campaign is the direction of stu
dent government."
Morse said that Robbins differs
most from MacKenzie in ability
to implement programs. Morse
described Robbins's plans as "con
crete" while MacKenzie's, he said,
were "vague commitments."
Schmidt, disagreeing, said Mac-
Kenzie's experience qualifies him
as a "constructive executive"
while Robbins, he said, "is a pas
sive administrator."
Whole Campus Candidate
Doth sides believe they will re
ceive support from all areas of

the campus. Schmidt said Mac-
Kenzie, who led Rohbins by about
250 votes in the primary, is a
"candidate of the whole campus."
Morse, speaking for Robbins,
I said, "I think our support is fairly
j widespread. We have good sup-

port from the freshmen and the
1 fraternities."
Students will also vote on a con
stitutional amendment whi c h
would allow the Legislature to
; choose the Speaker at a time
! "other than at the beginning of
I the acamedic year." This amend
ment has been passed unani
mously by LASSU and enjoys the
support of Speaker Ed Shaw and
1 the Election .Reform Committee.
