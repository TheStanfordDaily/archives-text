## 
### 
Dean of Students H. Donald
Winbigler has recently mailed an
I explanation of Stanford's new so
( cial regulations to the parents of
all Stanford women.
Each parent has received a four
page summary of the new regu
lations similar to the one recently
distributed to all undergraduate
women.
In addition, the mailing included
a two page letter from Dean
Winbigler explaining both the
new procedures themselves and
the reasons for their adoption.
After praising the research of
the AWS Social Regulations Com
mittee, Dean Winbigler's letter
discusses the extension of the
regular sign-in time to 12:00 p.m.
for freshman women and the
new (5 a.m. late leave option for
juniors and seniors. The letter
does not mention overnight poli
cies.
The letter explains that the
12:00 sign-in for freshman women
will allow them to study until the
library closes without using up
laic leaves.
With regard to the present 2:30
a.m. sign-in for juniors and sen
iors hp writes: "the present 2:.')0
a.m. deadline induces too m a ny
students to race back to the cam
pus from social and cultural
events some distance away. It
seems very doubtful, <>112 course,
thai many students actually will
remain out until the Â»> a.m. dead
line."
