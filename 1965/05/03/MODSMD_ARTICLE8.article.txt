# ASSU Candidates Debate in Branner
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD 
Sharp exchanges on the issues ol judicial interpretation and the ,
proposed "cabinet system enlivened the last debate ol this year's!
ASSU Presidential race between William "Sandy Mackenzie and .
Dave Robbins.
Over 100 students attended the debate which was held in Bran
.l.

nor Lounge last" night at 7 p.m:
MacKenzie and his running
mate, Clark Brown, attacked the
section of Robbins' platform urg
ing the "judicial councils them
selves" to interpret, the Funda
mental Standard and Honor Code.
MacKenzie said that the Legisla
ture, as representative of the stu
dent body, should do the inter
preting.
On Judicial Interpretation
Frank Morse, Robbins' running
mate, noted that "no country I
have ever heard of" allows its
Legislative branch to interpret
its own policy. Robbins added that
another of his proposals - - the
publication of a book of 'prece
dences' — would insure judicial
continuity and prevent constant
and revolutionary reinterpret a

tions.
Earlier, MacKenzie had ques-1
tioned the efficacy of Robbins'
proposal for a five-man 'cabinet'
to inform and advise the Presi
dent. He said that only one of the
five proposed offices — that of
Secretary of Legislative Affairs;
was of any value.
MacKenzie said that he would;
leave such duties to his adminis
trative assistants and spend his!
time meeting with various stu-J
dent groups instead of one set ad- '
; visory board.
Robbins defended his proposal,
claiming that this advisory body
would be chosen on "merit" as
| well as "interest" and would "rep
resent a broad cross-section of the
'student body."
