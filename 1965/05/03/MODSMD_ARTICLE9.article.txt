# Peace Caucus Vigil Today
## 
### 
The Peace Caucus will hold a vigil today from 11:45 to 1:15 in
protest of American policy in Vietnam and the Caribbean, and cir
culate a petition to be sent to President Johnson.
The petition reads in part: "We protest the U.S. policy to make
the world safe for America by military might, the escalation of mass
murder to even more massive murder in Vietnam, and the attempt
to draw China into a war that may yet make the Asian conflict the
war to end all warsâ€”by reducing civilization to rubble.
"What will the Great Society gobble up next? What will be the
next Now Frontier? Will it be the only democratic regime, (hat of
Juan Bosch, which has graced the Dominican Republic in half a
century?
"We no longer expect the United States to behave like a peace
loving democracy. We no longer expect the United States to behave
at all. but we still hope .however futilly, that American troops will
be withdrawn from the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, and from all
of our other colonial outposts around the world."
