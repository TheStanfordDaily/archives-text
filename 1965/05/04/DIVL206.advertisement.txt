you should make it a point to know at least one of
them really well. And Paris — well, it may not be
Senator Fulbright's favorite and we understand the
"in" people are going to Oslo this year — but Paris
is still more things to more men than any place else
on earth. William Davenport's pocket-sized guide
book will take you to see practically everything worth
seeing and will show you where you can do practically
everything worth doing. It includes an astonishing
amount of off-beat information on such things as
laundry and drug stores, and still manages to be as
delightfully sophisticated as the city it celebrates.
For some with less escapist plans for June, The
Checklist For A Perfect Wedding (Dolphin, 9■">v) is
recommended as a cure for frayed nerves, as a mediator
between emotional brides-to-be and their, emotional ■
mothers, and as an accurate, sanity-saving guide to the
innumerable details that go into planning a wedding.
Mrs. Follett's book is correct, complete, and in chrono
logical order, and neither the future bride nor her
mother should have to struggle along without it. For
future bridegrooms, we advance two suggestions.
First, if you get a copy, you'll at least know why you
never get to see the girl you are about to marry.
Second, despite all evidence to the contrary, you will
play a fairly important supporting role at your wed
ding, and you will find the checklists helpful too.
Our final choice for pre-graduation reading is a
recognized classic. In fact, the title of William H.
!Hf White's book, The Organization Man (Anchor, $1.45),
h.;s'so firm a place in our language that it may come
as a surprise to be reminded that it was first published
less than 10 years ago. In the intervening years, the
M way of life Mr. Whyte describes has become the way
m| of life for most middle-class Americans. Going to
graduate school instead of directly into industry?
1 S "Blood brother to the business trainee off to join
Du Pont," Mr. Whyte writes, "is the seminary student
who will end up in the church hierarchy, the doctor
headed for the corporate clinic, the physics Ph.D. in
P a government laboratory, the intellectual on the foun
dation-sponsored team project, the engineering gradu
al ate in the huge drafting room at Lockheed, the young
!8 j apprentice in a Wall Street law factory."
8 j Whether or not The Organization Man describes
! J the kind of life you want to lend, it is absorbing, im-
Sportant reading for anyone interested in American
society as it is today.
