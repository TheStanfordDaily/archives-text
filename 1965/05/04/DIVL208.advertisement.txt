You can stand on your head ||9KI looking for a place
lo park on most campuses. S|l|v And all you end
up with is a headache. But not if you ride a
Honda. It needs only as much elbow room as you with
an armload of books. So you can squeeze in a little closer
to that 8 o'clock class than your 4-wheel competition.
A Honda helps keep you solvent as well as sane. Prices
start about $215*. You'll get up to 200 mpg, depending on
the model. And practically never need service. The
star performer above is the CB-160. Just one of the 15
Honda models. With its 4-stroke, twin cylinder engine
and 16.5 HP, this showoff does better than 80 mph. 1 ,ook
into a Honda soon. No more headaches.
