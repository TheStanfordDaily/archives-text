# Winbigler Plays Difficult Role to Hostile Audience

### CYRIL SIA DON NEWTON 
Deans arc usually not popular with students.
H. Donald Winbigler, who has been an un
dergraduate, a graduate student, a teaching
assistant and a full professor, is fully aware
of this disadvantage and has actively worked
against the typical image of a harsh, stern
administrator.
He is a man whose senses are tuned strongly
outward in a social situation and who is cap
able of guiding a conversation subtly. In fact,
there are quite a few students, leaders, and
committee workers who claim personal ac
quaintance with Winbigler.
He is oflcn described as "really a nice guy
stuck with a lousy job." One naturally asks,
"Why does he keep the job then. Why did he
become an administrator in the first place?"
Position Taken in 1950
Winbigler assumed the position of Dean of
Students on July 1, 1950. The University was
smaller than, the problems to be dealt with were
less complex, and it was easier to maintain
the image of a popular Dean.
About ten years ago. the ladies of Jordan
house decided to hold a dinner party, including
on the invitation list the most influential mem
bers of the faculty and administration.
Unfortunately, few of the guests responded,
and in fact most of those invited failed to
even reply to the R.S.V.P. Not, however, Dean
Winbigler. Although he had a previous en
gagement, an apologetic note was duly sent,
along with a green bouquet of crisp roses. The
story was discovered by a crusading colum
nist, for The Daily who printed it under the
heading "Good-Guy Department."
He took the episode to illustrate how the
"ever-popular congenial Dean" was always
sensitive and considerate to students. Even the
Crow-Halverson report, remembered primar

ily for its criticism of the Dean's office, pre
faced its remarks about Winbigler by stating
that he "has demonstrated again and again and
again his good judgment in Honor Code cases.
He seems to understand the problems in
volved without ignoring the peculiarities of an
individual case."
No Cliange in Image
Winbigler flatly denies that his public image
has changed since. He does feel that he is
somewhat more distant from the individual
student. He laments that his schedule gets out
of hand, and that he has to leave many de
tails to his secretaries: "The problem is the
increasing size and complexity of ihe Uni
versity ...
During the exclusive interview with The
Daily, Winbigler repeatedly lit his cigar. Once
an actor, he still subscribes to the American
Educational Theatre Journal, is a member of
the National Thespians and the National Col
lege Players, and used to be a Professor of
Speech and Drama.
He is currently playing a very difficult role
to a rather hostile audience. He has said that
all drama is based upon a struggle, and such a
philosophy about the stage needs only a well
known line from Shakespeare to indicate its
true scope of application.
In his "Last Lecture," Winbigler pointed
out that all of us actively cultivate social tech
nique, which "at its highest level is an art."
Elaborating, he explained that "the art of in
terpersonal relationships" consists of playing
the counselor, the actor, the speaker, the con
versationalist, the friend and companion, and
"even the art of conjugal living."
Winbigler was born in 1909 "on a farm" in
Alexis, Illinois. He has eight brothers and
sisters, all of whom either married or holding
professional positions. One, for instance, is
an administrator for the CIA. His father was

a County Superintendent of Schools.
His dedication to his own position prevents
him from taking political stands, but if pinned
down, he will admit to being "a moderate Re
publican."
Little Leisure Time
He has little leisure time. When he does have
a free hour, he is liable to be found in the
garden around the Winbiglers' Los Altos home.
Winbigler says he first became an adminis
trater because it was an area in which he was
needed. He became director of placement serv

ices for the Registrar's Office in 1912, shortly
afier Pearl Harbor, while at the same lime
being an assistant professor. In 1943 he be
came Associate Registrar and associate pro
fessor, and in 1945, the Registrar.
Although he spent a full ten years as an in
structor before becoming even a part-time ad
ministrator, he denies that he was ever dis
appointed with teaching. He pointed out that
the biographies of noted artists and scientists
showed that they frequently changed direction
before finally deciding what to do.
He speculated, "We are always reformu
lating our objectives because of circum
stances." He finds, however, that it is the kind
of work he enjoys most, "The human pro
lems the Dean's office deals with," he con
eludes, "are fascinating."
Between Two Forces
Circumstance frequently places Winbigler be
tween two forces: first, the Board of Trustees
and alumni and parents; second, the stu
dent body. His strongest criticism has come
from the latter; "... his desire for expediting a
decision may take precedence over his careful
regard for procedure," concluded the Crow-
Halverson report.
It is now treated as a matter of fact that
pressure was brought to bear in the Frank
Morse case. Also, according to some, the strug
gles within the Dean's office are among the
bloodiest that this campus has (or has not)
seen.
An ex-member of the Dean's staff points out
that while faces come and go (Craig, Lowcn
stein, Strogan, Larimer, etc.), Winbigler abides
forever. He is "elusive, efficient, pragmatic,
the Achilles of the internecine struggle in t ho
administrative bureaucracy."
Ethical Relativism
The Dean argues relativisticall.v on ques
tions of eithics: "There is room for a reason

ably wide spectrum in people's views." The
limitations are, for example, "the principle of
honesty," which he believes a solid foundation
for anybody's formulation.
He is alarmed by the increasing restrictive
ness of law upon behavior: "There are hun
dreds of people in prison today for breaking
laws that did not exist twenty-five years ago."
It is an Individual's personal decision as to
whether or not a law should be obeyed, he
says, but the individual must recognize that
he has assumed the responsibility.
Surprisingly, or perhaps not, Winbigler's
statements about the role of the university
seem in general congruence, at least philosoph
ically, with the credo of an organization as
fur left as the Students for a Democratic So
ciety.
An Increase in Size
The size of the university has increased by
a factor of three since Winbigler came to
Stanford, and he senses also a change in the
calibre of the student, beginning with the
enormous influx after World War II: "There
was a sense of urgency to get back to their
studies."
The trend has continued in response to in
creasing pressures, as more recently, "the post
sputnik pressures." Students are much more
serious today, "and there is increasing concern
for reform." The role of the university in so
ciety is to foster research, to train and de
velop professional people, and to act as a
major cultural and intellectural respository,
"like a library or a museum." he states. In
addition to these roles, Winbigler says that
for the first time the university can become "an
agent in cultural evolution." According to the
Port Huron statement (the bible of SDS), the
university should "serve as a significant source
of social criticism and an initiator of new
modes and molders of attitudes."

nist, for The Daily who printed it under the
heading "Good-Guy Department."
He took the episode to illustrate how the
"ever-popular congenial Dean" was always
sensitive and considerate to students. Even the
Crow-Halverson report, remembered primar

ily for its criticism of the Dean's office, pre
faced its remarks about Winbigler by stating
that he "has demonstrated again and again and
again his good judgment in Honor Code cases.
He seems to understand the problems in
volved without ignoring the peculiarities of an
individual case."
No Cliange in Image
Winbigler flatly denies that his public image
has changed since. He does feel that he is
somewhat more distant from the individual
student. He laments that his schedule gets out
of hand, and that he has to leave many de
tails to his secretaries: "The problem is the
increasing size and complexity of ihe Uni
versity ...
During the exclusive interview with The
Daily, Winbigler repeatedly lit his cigar. Once
an actor, he still subscribes to the American
Educational Theatre Journal, is a member of
the National Thespians and the National Col
lege Players, and used to be a Professor of
Speech and Drama.
He is currently playing a very difficult role
to a rather hostile audience. He has said that
all drama is based upon a struggle, and such a
philosophy about the stage needs only a well
known line from Shakespeare to indicate its
true scope of application.
In his "Last Lecture," Winbigler pointed
out that all of us actively cultivate social tech
nique, which "at its highest level is an art."
Elaborating, he explained that "the art of in
terpersonal relationships" consists of playing
the counselor, the actor, the speaker, the con
versationalist, the friend and companion, and
"even the art of conjugal living."
Winbigler was born in 1909 "on a farm" in
Alexis, Illinois. He has eight brothers and
sisters, all of whom either married or holding
professional positions. One, for instance, is
an administrator for the CIA. His father was

a County Superintendent of Schools.
His dedication to his own position prevents
him from taking political stands, but if pinned
down, he will admit to being "a moderate Re
publican."
Little Leisure Time
He has little leisure time. When he does have
a free hour, he is liable to be found in the
garden around the Winbiglers' Los Altos home.
Winbigler says he first became an adminis
trater because it was an area in which he was
needed. He became director of placement serv

ices for the Registrar's Office in 1912, shortly
afier Pearl Harbor, while at the same lime
being an assistant professor. In 1943 he be
came Associate Registrar and associate pro
fessor, and in 1945, the Registrar.
Although he spent a full ten years as an in
structor before becoming even a part-time ad
ministrator, he denies that he was ever dis
appointed with teaching. He pointed out that
the biographies of noted artists and scientists
showed that they frequently changed direction
before finally deciding what to do.
He speculated, "We are always reformu
lating our objectives because of circum
stances." He finds, however, that it is the kind
of work he enjoys most, "The human pro
lems the Dean's office deals with," he con
eludes, "are fascinating."
Between Two Forces
Circumstance frequently places Winbigler be
tween two forces: first, the Board of Trustees
and alumni and parents; second, the stu
dent body. His strongest criticism has come
from the latter; "... his desire for expediting a
decision may take precedence over his careful
regard for procedure," concluded the Crow-
Halverson report.
It is now treated as a matter of fact that
pressure was brought to bear in the Frank
Morse case. Also, according to some, the strug
gles within the Dean's office are among the
bloodiest that this campus has (or has not)
seen.
An ex-member of the Dean's staff points out
that while faces come and go (Craig, Lowcn
stein, Strogan, Larimer, etc.), Winbigler abides
forever. He is "elusive, efficient, pragmatic,
the Achilles of the internecine struggle in t ho
administrative bureaucracy."
Ethical Relativism
The Dean argues relativisticall.v on ques
tions of eithics: "There is room for a reason

ably wide spectrum in people's views." The
limitations are, for example, "the principle of
honesty," which he believes a solid foundation
for anybody's formulation.
He is alarmed by the increasing restrictive
ness of law upon behavior: "There are hun
dreds of people in prison today for breaking
laws that did not exist twenty-five years ago."
It is an Individual's personal decision as to
whether or not a law should be obeyed, he
says, but the individual must recognize that
he has assumed the responsibility.
Surprisingly, or perhaps not, Winbigler's
statements about the role of the university
seem in general congruence, at least philosoph
ically, with the credo of an organization as
fur left as the Students for a Democratic So
ciety.
An Increase in Size
The size of the university has increased by
a factor of three since Winbigler came to
Stanford, and he senses also a change in the
calibre of the student, beginning with the
enormous influx after World War II: "There
was a sense of urgency to get back to their
studies."
The trend has continued in response to in
creasing pressures, as more recently, "the post
sputnik pressures." Students are much more
serious today, "and there is increasing concern
for reform." The role of the university in so
ciety is to foster research, to train and de
velop professional people, and to act as a
major cultural and intellectural respository,
"like a library or a museum." he states. In
addition to these roles, Winbigler says that
for the first time the university can become "an
agent in cultural evolution." According to the
Port Huron statement (the bible of SDS), the
university should "serve as a significant source
of social criticism and an initiator of new
modes and molders of attitudes."


H. DONALD WINBIGLER
Deans arc usually not popular with students.
H. Donald Winbigler, who has been an un
dergraduate, a graduate student, a teaching
assistant and a full professor, is fully aware
of this disadvantage and has actively worked
against the typical image of a harsh, stern
administrator.
He is a man whose senses are tuned strongly
outward in a social situation and who is cap
able of guiding a conversation subtly. In fact,
there are quite a few students, leaders, and
committee workers who claim personal ac
quaintance with Winbigler.
He is oflcn described as "really a nice guy
stuck with a lousy job." One naturally asks,
"Why does he keep the job then. Why did he
become an administrator in the first place?"
Position Taken in 1950
Winbigler assumed the position of Dean of
Students on July 1, 1950. The University was
smaller than, the problems to be dealt with were
less complex, and it was easier to maintain
the image of a popular Dean.
About ten years ago. the ladies of Jordan
house decided to hold a dinner party, including
on the invitation list the most influential mem
bers of the faculty and administration.
Unfortunately, few of the guests responded,
and in fact most of those invited failed to
even reply to the R.S.V.P. Not, however, Dean
Winbigler. Although he had a previous en
gagement, an apologetic note was duly sent,
along with a green bouquet of crisp roses. The

nique, which "at its highest level is an art."
Elaborating, he explained that "the art of in
terpersonal relationships" consists of playing
the counselor, the actor, the speaker, the con
versationalist, the friend and companion, and
"even the art of conjugal living."
Winbigler was born in 1909 "on a farm" in
Alexis, Illinois. He has eight brothers and
sisters, all of whom either married or holding
professional positions. One, for instance, is
an administrator for the CIA. His father was

a County Superintendent of Schools.
His dedication to his own position prevents
him from taking political stands, but if pinned
down, he will admit to being "a moderate Re
publican."
Little Leisure Time
He has little leisure time. When he does have
a free hour, he is liable to be found in the
garden around the Winbiglers' Los Altos home.
Winbigler says he first became an adminis
trater because it was an area in which he was
needed. He became director of placement serv

ices for the Registrar's Office in 1912, shortly
afier Pearl Harbor, while at the same lime
being an assistant professor. In 1943 he be
came Associate Registrar and associate pro
fessor, and in 1945, the Registrar.
Although he spent a full ten years as an in
structor before becoming even a part-time ad
ministrator, he denies that he was ever dis
appointed with teaching. He pointed out that
the biographies of noted artists and scientists
showed that they frequently changed direction
before finally deciding what to do.
He speculated, "We are always reformu
lating our objectives because of circum
stances." He finds, however, that it is the kind
of work he enjoys most, "The human pro
lems the Dean's office deals with," he con
eludes, "are fascinating."
Between Two Forces
Circumstance frequently places Winbigler be
tween two forces: first, the Board of Trustees
and alumni and parents; second, the stu
dent body. His strongest criticism has come
from the latter; "... his desire for expediting a
decision may take precedence over his careful
regard for procedure," concluded the Crow-
Halverson report.
It is now treated as a matter of fact that
pressure was brought to bear in the Frank
Morse case. Also, according to some, the strug
gles within the Dean's office are among the
bloodiest that this campus has (or has not)
seen.
An ex-member of the Dean's staff points out
that while faces come and go (Craig, Lowcn
stein, Strogan, Larimer, etc.), Winbigler abides
forever. He is "elusive, efficient, pragmatic,
the Achilles of the internecine struggle in t ho
administrative bureaucracy."
Ethical Relativism
The Dean argues relativisticall.v on ques
tions of eithics: "There is room for a reason

ably wide spectrum in people's views." The
limitations are, for example, "the principle of
honesty," which he believes a solid foundation
for anybody's formulation.
He is alarmed by the increasing restrictive
ness of law upon behavior: "There are hun
dreds of people in prison today for breaking
laws that did not exist twenty-five years ago."
It is an Individual's personal decision as to
whether or not a law should be obeyed, he
says, but the individual must recognize that
he has assumed the responsibility.
Surprisingly, or perhaps not, Winbigler's
statements about the role of the university
seem in general congruence, at least philosoph
ically, with the credo of an organization as
fur left as the Students for a Democratic So
ciety.
An Increase in Size
The size of the university has increased by
a factor of three since Winbigler came to
Stanford, and he senses also a change in the
calibre of the student, beginning with the
enormous influx after World War II: "There
was a sense of urgency to get back to their
studies."
The trend has continued in response to in
creasing pressures, as more recently, "the post
sputnik pressures." Students are much more
serious today, "and there is increasing concern
for reform." The role of the university in so
ciety is to foster research, to train and de
velop professional people, and to act as a
major cultural and intellectural respository,
"like a library or a museum." he states. In
addition to these roles, Winbigler says that
for the first time the university can become "an
agent in cultural evolution." According to the
Port Huron statement (the bible of SDS), the
university should "serve as a significant source
of social criticism and an initiator of new
modes and molders of attitudes."


H. DONALD WINBIGLER
Deans arc usually not popular with students.
H. Donald Winbigler, who has been an un
dergraduate, a graduate student, a teaching
assistant and a full professor, is fully aware
of this disadvantage and has actively worked
against the typical image of a harsh, stern
administrator.
He is a man whose senses are tuned strongly
outward in a social situation and who is cap
able of guiding a conversation subtly. In fact,
there are quite a few students, leaders, and
committee workers who claim personal ac
quaintance with Winbigler.
He is oflcn described as "really a nice guy
stuck with a lousy job." One naturally asks,
"Why does he keep the job then. Why did he
become an administrator in the first place?"
Position Taken in 1950
Winbigler assumed the position of Dean of
Students on July 1, 1950. The University was
smaller than, the problems to be dealt with were
less complex, and it was easier to maintain
the image of a popular Dean.
About ten years ago. the ladies of Jordan
house decided to hold a dinner party, including
on the invitation list the most influential mem
bers of the faculty and administration.
Unfortunately, few of the guests responded,
and in fact most of those invited failed to
even reply to the R.S.V.P. Not, however, Dean
Winbigler. Although he had a previous en
gagement, an apologetic note was duly sent,
along with a green bouquet of crisp roses. The
story was discovered by a crusading colum
nist, for The Daily who printed it under the
heading "Good-Guy Department."
He took the episode to illustrate how the
"ever-popular congenial Dean" was always
sensitive and considerate to students. Even the
Crow-Halverson report, remembered primar

ily for its criticism of the Dean's office, pre
faced its remarks about Winbigler by stating
that he "has demonstrated again and again and
again his good judgment in Honor Code cases.
He seems to understand the problems in
volved without ignoring the peculiarities of an
individual case."
No Cliange in Image
Winbigler flatly denies that his public image
has changed since. He does feel that he is
somewhat more distant from the individual
student. He laments that his schedule gets out
of hand, and that he has to leave many de
tails to his secretaries: "The problem is the
increasing size and complexity of ihe Uni
versity ...
During the exclusive interview with The
Daily, Winbigler repeatedly lit his cigar. Once
an actor, he still subscribes to the American
Educational Theatre Journal, is a member of
the National Thespians and the National Col
lege Players, and used to be a Professor of
Speech and Drama.
He is currently playing a very difficult role
to a rather hostile audience. He has said that
all drama is based upon a struggle, and such a
philosophy about the stage needs only a well
known line from Shakespeare to indicate its
true scope of application.

showed that they frequently changed direction
before finally deciding what to do.
He speculated, "We are always reformu
lating our objectives because of circum
stances." He finds, however, that it is the kind
of work he enjoys most, "The human pro
lems the Dean's office deals with," he con
eludes, "are fascinating."
Between Two Forces
Circumstance frequently places Winbigler be
tween two forces: first, the Board of Trustees
and alumni and parents; second, the stu
dent body. His strongest criticism has come
from the latter; "... his desire for expediting a
decision may take precedence over his careful
regard for procedure," concluded the Crow-
Halverson report.
It is now treated as a matter of fact that
pressure was brought to bear in the Frank
Morse case. Also, according to some, the strug
gles within the Dean's office are among the
bloodiest that this campus has (or has not)
seen.
An ex-member of the Dean's staff points out
that while faces come and go (Craig, Lowcn
stein, Strogan, Larimer, etc.), Winbigler abides
forever. He is "elusive, efficient, pragmatic,
the Achilles of the internecine struggle in t ho
administrative bureaucracy."
Ethical Relativism
The Dean argues relativisticall.v on ques
tions of eithics: "There is room for a reason

ably wide spectrum in people's views." The
limitations are, for example, "the principle of
honesty," which he believes a solid foundation
for anybody's formulation.
He is alarmed by the increasing restrictive
ness of law upon behavior: "There are hun
dreds of people in prison today for breaking
laws that did not exist twenty-five years ago."
It is an Individual's personal decision as to
whether or not a law should be obeyed, he
says, but the individual must recognize that
he has assumed the responsibility.
Surprisingly, or perhaps not, Winbigler's
statements about the role of the university
seem in general congruence, at least philosoph
ically, with the credo of an organization as
fur left as the Students for a Democratic So
ciety.
An Increase in Size
The size of the university has increased by
a factor of three since Winbigler came to
Stanford, and he senses also a change in the
calibre of the student, beginning with the
enormous influx after World War II: "There
was a sense of urgency to get back to their
studies."
The trend has continued in response to in
creasing pressures, as more recently, "the post
sputnik pressures." Students are much more
serious today, "and there is increasing concern
for reform." The role of the university in so
ciety is to foster research, to train and de
velop professional people, and to act as a
major cultural and intellectural respository,
"like a library or a museum." he states. In
addition to these roles, Winbigler says that
for the first time the university can become "an
agent in cultural evolution." According to the
Port Huron statement (the bible of SDS), the
university should "serve as a significant source
of social criticism and an initiator of new
modes and molders of attitudes."


H. DONALD WINBIGLER
Deans arc usually not popular with students.
H. Donald Winbigler, who has been an un
dergraduate, a graduate student, a teaching
assistant and a full professor, is fully aware
of this disadvantage and has actively worked
against the typical image of a harsh, stern
administrator.
He is a man whose senses are tuned strongly
outward in a social situation and who is cap
able of guiding a conversation subtly. In fact,
there are quite a few students, leaders, and
committee workers who claim personal ac
quaintance with Winbigler.
He is oflcn described as "really a nice guy
stuck with a lousy job." One naturally asks,
"Why does he keep the job then. Why did he
become an administrator in the first place?"
Position Taken in 1950
Winbigler assumed the position of Dean of
Students on July 1, 1950. The University was
smaller than, the problems to be dealt with were
less complex, and it was easier to maintain
the image of a popular Dean.
About ten years ago. the ladies of Jordan
house decided to hold a dinner party, including
on the invitation list the most influential mem
bers of the faculty and administration.
Unfortunately, few of the guests responded,
and in fact most of those invited failed to
even reply to the R.S.V.P. Not, however, Dean
Winbigler. Although he had a previous en
gagement, an apologetic note was duly sent,
along with a green bouquet of crisp roses. The
story was discovered by a crusading colum
nist, for The Daily who printed it under the
heading "Good-Guy Department."
He took the episode to illustrate how the
"ever-popular congenial Dean" was always
sensitive and considerate to students. Even the
Crow-Halverson report, remembered primar

ily for its criticism of the Dean's office, pre
faced its remarks about Winbigler by stating
that he "has demonstrated again and again and
again his good judgment in Honor Code cases.
He seems to understand the problems in
volved without ignoring the peculiarities of an
individual case."
No Cliange in Image
Winbigler flatly denies that his public image
has changed since. He does feel that he is
somewhat more distant from the individual
student. He laments that his schedule gets out
of hand, and that he has to leave many de
tails to his secretaries: "The problem is the
increasing size and complexity of ihe Uni
versity ...
During the exclusive interview with The
Daily, Winbigler repeatedly lit his cigar. Once
an actor, he still subscribes to the American
Educational Theatre Journal, is a member of
the National Thespians and the National Col
lege Players, and used to be a Professor of
Speech and Drama.
He is currently playing a very difficult role
to a rather hostile audience. He has said that
all drama is based upon a struggle, and such a
philosophy about the stage needs only a well
known line from Shakespeare to indicate its
true scope of application.
In his "Last Lecture," Winbigler pointed
out that all of us actively cultivate social tech
nique, which "at its highest level is an art."
Elaborating, he explained that "the art of in
terpersonal relationships" consists of playing
the counselor, the actor, the speaker, the con
versationalist, the friend and companion, and
"even the art of conjugal living."
Winbigler was born in 1909 "on a farm" in
Alexis, Illinois. He has eight brothers and
sisters, all of whom either married or holding
professional positions. One, for instance, is
an administrator for the CIA. His father was

a County Superintendent of Schools.
His dedication to his own position prevents
him from taking political stands, but if pinned
down, he will admit to being "a moderate Re
publican."
Little Leisure Time
He has little leisure time. When he does have
a free hour, he is liable to be found in the
garden around the Winbiglers' Los Altos home.
Winbigler says he first became an adminis
trater because it was an area in which he was
needed. He became director of placement serv

ices for the Registrar's Office in 1912, shortly
afier Pearl Harbor, while at the same lime
being an assistant professor. In 1943 he be
came Associate Registrar and associate pro
fessor, and in 1945, the Registrar.
Although he spent a full ten years as an in
structor before becoming even a part-time ad
ministrator, he denies that he was ever dis
appointed with teaching. He pointed out that
the biographies of noted artists and scientists
showed that they frequently changed direction
before finally deciding what to do.
He speculated, "We are always reformu
lating our objectives because of circum
stances." He finds, however, that it is the kind
