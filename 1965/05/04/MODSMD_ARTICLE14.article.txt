# AAWU Passes New Rule; Letter of Intent Regulation
## 
### 
A new program designed to
lessen the pressures of recruit
ing on both athletes and coaches
has been put inlo effect both at
Stanford and all the other mem
ber schools of the AAWU.
Under t he new plan, statements
regarding prospective athletes
were sent to the conference office
before April 15. Then the con
ference office sent ihese state
ments of commitment-to-attend to
all the student-athletes that had
been nominaed by the various
schools.
Then the high school seniors
returned the letters to the AAWU
office, and Director Tom Hamil
ton notified all the schools of the
students' choices. Once a student
has signed a statement, the rep
resentatives of another member
school cannot contact him.

'No Contact' Period
An important provision of the
I program is th;it all staff and
alumni of a university may not
'contact high school seniors from
April 25 to May 3. If a student
enrolls at another member instnu
i tion than the one to which he
I signed the letter of intend he
could subject himself to a penalty
■ of loss of eligibility for freshman
I competition and practice, and loss
| of eligibility for financial aid
1 during his freshman year.
The student is in no way ob
ligated to sign the letter of in
tent and if he declines, he may still
go to any school in the confer
ence without penalty. If the ath-
I lete chooses to do this, he may
i be contacted by both staff and
alumni up until September 10,
when the Statement of Intent pro
| grams concludes.
According to Ihe Executive Di
-1 rector of the AAWU, Tom Hamil-
I ton, "The Statement of Intent
: program merely offers an op
, portunity to any student being
' recruited to free himself from
recruiting pressures during the

spring and summer preceding his
initial enrollment in an AAWU
member institution."
Coaches Favor Plan
Most of the coaches and ad
ministrators of Ihe AAWU are
wholeheartedly in favor of the
plan. The program should ease
the heavy travel burdens which
; many coaches are forced to under
go to see prospective students.
The plan should also give the
coaching staffs more time to
pursue the technical aspect of
their jobs rather than spend
so much of their time on re
cruiting trips.
Chuck Taylor, Stanford Athletic
Director, is very much enthused
I about the new program and feels
that the "early deadline" will be
j of special benefit in allowing the
| coaches more time for coaching.

The student is in no way ob

tent and if he declines, he may still
go to any school in the confer
ence without penalty. If the ath-
I lete chooses to do this, he may
i be contacted by both staff and
alumni up until September 10,
when the Statement of Intent pro

According to Ihe Executive Di
-1 rector of the AAWU, Tom Hamil-
I ton, "The Statement of Intent
: program merely offers an op
, portunity to any student being
' recruited to free himself from
recruiting pressures during the

spring and summer preceding his
initial enrollment in an AAWU
member institution."
Coaches Favor Plan
Most of the coaches and ad
ministrators of Ihe AAWU are
wholeheartedly in favor of the
plan. The program should ease
the heavy travel burdens which
; many coaches are forced to under
go to see prospective students.
The plan should also give the
coaching staffs more time to
pursue the technical aspect of
their jobs rather than spend
so much of their time on re
cruiting trips.
Chuck Taylor, Stanford Athletic
Director, is very much enthused
I about the new program and feels
that the "early deadline" will be
j of special benefit in allowing the
| coaches more time for coaching.
A new program designed to
lessen the pressures of recruit
ing on both athletes and coaches
has been put inlo effect both at
Stanford and all the other mem
ber schools of the AAWU.
Under t he new plan, statements
regarding prospective athletes
were sent to the conference office
before April 15. Then the con
ference office sent ihese state
ments of commitment-to-attend to
all the student-athletes that had
been nominaed by the various
schools.
Then the high school seniors
returned the letters to the AAWU
office, and Director Tom Hamil
ton notified all the schools of the
students' choices. Once a student
has signed a statement, the rep
resentatives of another member
school cannot contact him.

'No Contact' Period
An important provision of the
I program is th;it all staff and
alumni of a university may not
'contact high school seniors from
April 25 to May 3. If a student
enrolls at another member instnu
i tion than the one to which he
I signed the letter of intend he
could subject himself to a penalty
■ of loss of eligibility for freshman
I competition and practice, and loss
| of eligibility for financial aid
