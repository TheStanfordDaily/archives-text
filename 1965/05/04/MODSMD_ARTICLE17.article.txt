# Indian Baseballers on Rebound; Face San Diego Marines Today
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford finally regained iis
pre season form over the weekend I
Ito retake ihe load in the tense!
I battle for tho CIBA title, with j
two impressive victories over;
' archrival California. Tho Indians;
j thus won tho season's series bo
lt ween tho two schools 3-1.
But more important Stanford'
! has edged closer to the title. In j
'years gone by Stanford would]
have such pitching groats as Bill j
Wakefield and Darrell Sutherland,
i but still finish among the tail-!
! enders. But. this season they were j
I able to combine both consistent
I pitching and timely hitting.
Mason and Quiring
The pitching centers around
! Daro Quiring and John Mason,
j Without oil her of those hurlers
| the Indians would be in a sorry
l position in the CIBA. Quiring's
rise to sudden fame was some
j what unexpected. lie is only a
sophomore. Though he was the
ace of the Frosh staff last year, he
was not expected to step in and
i take over the number one spot
on the staff.
John Mason makes up the sec
ond component of the two man
rotation. John is steady, though
1 not as flashy or colorful as Quir
ing. But he gets the job done,
jand he is exceptionally depend
able. After those two the pitching
I staff drifts into the class of also
rans and question marks.
Tho only other man who has
■ seen much action is Mike Con
nolly who fills in as spot starter
and ace numoro-uno relief man.
j But ho is spotty. When he is
"on" he is unbeatable, but when
he is having a bad day, ho is
absolutely atrocious.
Middlekauff »*t a I
Led by Pete Middlekauff the
hitters have provided the hurl
ers with ample runs to work with.
During the letdown the past few
Weeks, the Indians had neither
hitting nor pitching. They lost by
j such scores as 10-1 and 8-0. But
I the season can be envisioned in
Friday's game when light hitting
Tom Melzer came up twice early
i in the game. The first time ho
drove in a run with a single and
the second time drove in another
; tally with a booming triple. Stan
ford has been getting the big hit
and the big out.
It seems that when the Indians
go bad they go all out. They sure
haven't wasted any hits or runs
in games which they had al
ready lost, by the fifth inning.
I "Why lo?o 10 8, when it's much
easier to lose 10-1," seems to be
, ihe motto. Also there doesn't seem
to be much point in winning by
more than two or three runs. But
this didn't hold against St. Mary's
when tho Indians had their finest
day at the plate scoring 21 runs.
But no one can knock a win
ner and the Indians are in reality
winners this season. It would
have been nice if they hadn t
lost those last couple of games so
as to remain high in the national
rankings. But they yet may he
j off to Omaha and won't that just
surprise everyone. But as I said
| you can't knock a winner . . .

-1 ion Tuesday afternoon against
the San Diego Marines. This will
