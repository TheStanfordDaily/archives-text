# ACADEMIC AFFAIRS
## Curriculum in the Multiversity 
### ROGER DANKERT (Sixth in a Series 
(Editor's Note) When Stanford students com
plain about the university, they usually talk about
one of two things. The first is university regula
tion of their "private" lives; the second is their
contact with the academic side of the university
through their classes. This latter subject, cur
riculum, is the top of this discussion. Curriculum
implies structure, and structure unfortunately has
not been the focus of much thought. Inflexibilities
are built into the curriculum structure, and they
need to be evaluated with a lull view of the
various possibilities around which academic course
work can be shaped.
What do students say about the curriculum?
Some say it is worthless; some say it is too super
ficial; others say it is too rigorous. Some say it is
just a front organization—for the Establishment.
In fact, the diversity of student comments on
the curriculum probably is matched only by the
diversity of reports made by those blind men feel
ing different parts of that proverbial elephant.
But what is its real nature? And how can one find
its head in order to talk to it?
Multiversity
The university, historically, has grown a great
deal as the care and management of ideas de
manded more and more sophistication. The term
multiversity—has been used to describe the spraw
ling "service" industry which the university has
become.
Leland Stanford Junior multiversity has in fact,
a highly differentiated output, and certain struc
tural provisions for obtaining that output. Our
multiversity produces at least three distinct things:
one is knowledge through research, one is profes
sionally-trained graduate students ,and one is edu
cated undergraduates. Our curriculum elephant
is then a part of this much bigger animal.
In spite of this increasing differentiation, there
is still only one set of faculty to do all three jobs.
The only divisions of faculty labor are along de
partmental linos rather than cutting along the line
of the three main enterprises of the multiversity.
There is no one that specializes in the problems of
education exclusive of the problems of research
and training.
Inevitably, this profession-oriented faculty has
given much of the course structure a certain style
and tone. Their disciplinary courses carry the sub
stantial weight of the precise or rigorous transfer
of knowledge. But they are very much organized
around the fields in which research is done, and
they are taught as one would teach professionals
simply because these jobs are also parts of the
faculty's function.
The undergraduate then is forced to gain his
education by exploring, one at a time, long splinters
of knowledge running the depth of particular
aspects of particular disciplines and ending with
current research problems.
Professional Course
The model professional course seems tu come
uniformly in dimensions of five units by one
quarter by three lectures per week. The measure
of achievement is the ability to round that long
splinter into a readable toothpick of knowledge
whose dimensions are approximately one paper
by one four-hour final. Education is measured by
the number of toothpicks one has.
This kind of homogeneity of course structure
runs throughout the discipline-oriented courses.
Now, reforms in curriculum have generally not
come through geunine evaluation of the existing
curriculum, but through a pasting on of new
courses or new programs. The haphazard attention
paid to the organization and evaluation of these
courses has often left them lacking in structure
and direction from the student point of view.
The main change has been the addition of the

seminar course as a stopgap to fill the most
obvious holes left by the departmental courses.
The seminar course saws knowledge into big i-ough
planks which are then open to general student
discussion. But the tool of general discussion fits
very loosely the scope of the problem. Thus many
seminar courses end up to be somewhat barren
academic enterprises, and student achievement
usually Is measured by the number of verbal knot
holes one is able to synthesize.
It is not desirable to oversimplify curriculum
structure or to underestimate the changes that
have been made, but it seems clear that our ways
of looking at education have come to be limiled
by this course structure. Undergraduates tend to
look at courses in terms of what is customary and
not in terms of what is possible.
• Spreading Tr<**
Yet, students need to understand and relate to
the human beings living under the spreading
tree of knowledge which they are studying
through the curriculum. They also want to admire
the leaves or appreciate the fruit of the tree. They
would like to rigorously examine the whole root
system. These are particular educational goals
in themselves.
Splinters and knotholes do not add up to all
these. Nor will they begin to until our focus
changes to the real problem: how can curriculum
be responsive to the problems and needs of stu
dents.
Consideration of the problems of the administra
tion or teaching of a curriculum does not .justify
lack of consideration of the problems of the
learners.
What is the best way to understand a tree? How
does one reform an elephant? These questions
have no ready-made answers. There is a crying
need in the field of higher education for evalua
tion of both the old departmental courses and the
new general seminar courses. However, there is a
reluctance even to start this evaluation because of
the concepts of professional autonomy and aca
demic freedom.
But the freedom to learn also is in question here,
and students ought to be thinking about what
they want out. of their education, and how the
curriculum could provide it.
Feedback
As a start they might think about asking for
solid curriculum courses in the philosophy and
practice of higher education. They might think
about setting up informal or formal evaluation
committees —in each course, each discipline, or
across disciplinary lines—to talk about particulars
and to meet with the people involved.
Students need to be providing reasoned feedback.
A faculty with only sporadic and ill-considered
complaints, or encouragements, has few guidelines
for course change. An academic administration
with no idea of what students are getting out of
their courses, or of what they want, can have no
real program of reform.
There is a whole field of human problems which
are skirted by a curriculum set up for faculty
needs and administration needs more than student
needs. What makes life worthwhile? How does one
love? What does technology really mean? How
does one preserve human dignity in an age of
bureaucracy? What is the relation between knowl
edge and action? These are all questions one has
to come to grips with; why shouldn't one bring
them structurally into the community of scholars.
Broad humanities-sciences studies, off-campus
field projects, interdisciplinary programs, supra
disciplinary programs, extradisciplinary programs,
problem-oriented seminars -all have a place in an
educational multi vers i t y.
But to make and hold a place, any course or
program needs people 1o fill it—people who are
willing to ask for, to volunteer for, to pressure
for, anrl to evaluate experimental curriculum
reforms.
