## John Thayer, Go Home!

Kditor, The Daily:
The "review" by John Thayer
in yesterday's Daily was an in
sult to the intelligence and taste of
the Stanford community. I have
lived in New York and Philadel
phia and, consequently, have had
the opportunity to compare the
reviews of collegiate critics with
the professionals' in those towns.
In no other college paper have I
ever read reviews more amatuer
ish than those thrown together by
Mr. Thayer. Happily, your lay-out
staff finally enabled readers to
compare and contrast his poor
efforts with the preceptive crit
icisms of Mr. Hirsch. Although I
have disagreed with some of his
past reviews, I have never read
anything by Foster Hirsch that
was less than commendable and
fair.
In his piece on Once Upon a
Mattress, Thayer demonstrated
once again that he hasn't the
faintest idea what a review is. His
ignorance of the whole concept
of drama is demonstrated in his
last paragraph: "Who needs an
expensive repertory theater . . ."
Assuming the play is well acted
and staged. I have no doubt that
il and other Stanford dramatic
productions could benefit (even if
only in a small way) from sugges
tions based upon the extensive
professional experience this rep
ertory troop will have at their
disposal.
Unless Mr. Thayer learns the
tricks of the reviewing trade (ana
lyzing the technical aspects, the
general performance of the whole
cast, the staging, and the direc
tion, as well as the plot and in
dividual performances), I would
strongly urge that he be given
another assignment on the Daily
staff.

MR. THAYER REPLIES:
Rhetorical questions ought, al
ways to be considered in context,
which in this case were mock
serious. The answer obviously is,
yes, we do need a rej>ertory thea
ter, but not if it means getting rid
of Ram's Head.
As to the rest of my review, I
thought I might, for a change,
concentrate on plot (I) because
the overall production, technical
and otherwise, was excellent, and
(2) because an amusing plot
summary is often very effective
in subtly conveying the general
tone of a show as well as the re
viewer's attitude toward per
formers and technical staff alik<>.

• Obscenity Deplored
Editor, The Daily:
Having worked closely with the
Robbins - Morse campaign, we
would like to express our distaste
of the obscenity painted on the
Stanford Bookstore Monday, May
3. The political implications of this
action do not reflect the spirit of
the campaign to this time. No
one associated with the Robbins-
Morse campaign was responsible
or aware of this offense, and it is
our hope that those who were re
sponsible will recognize the seri
ousness of such an incident.

• Dark Little Grotto
Editor, The Daily:
At first I did not think it would '
do any good to write about this I
matter, but as this is the third
quarter in a row that I've been
stuck with a class meeting in the
Little Theatre of Mem Aud, the
matter no longer seems so petty.
It's this: I'm practically going;
blind from having to take notes ;
in that dim, poorly lit little grot-i
to. I figure that when going out'
into daylight after class makes
me blink as my eyes struggle to
accustom themselves to such
bright light, the light in the Little
Theatre must be pretty poor. Now
I am well aware of the shortage
of classroom space at Stanford,
and I would not mind at all sitting ;
in those comfortable auditorium j
seats and taking notes, if only j
the place were better lighted. |
Would the rest of you read in a i
movie theatre before the film be-!
gan? That's about how bright the j
Little Theatre is during lectures.:
And what irks me most is that
the place could be brightened up, i
.just by using all the ceiling lights ;
that are up there: on Monday I
counted only 26 out of 43 lights I
functioning. Of course the teach- J
cr's podium has a fluorescent light
attached to it. so he has no prob- j
lem, and probably isn't even |
aware of the rest of us straining j
our eyes there in the dimness:
(perhaps he can't even see us for j
the dimness). In all seriousness,!
though, if Stanford is going to use
theatres for classrooms, the light-1
ing in them just has to be im- j
proved to classroom level.
