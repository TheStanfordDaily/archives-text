# Marcuse Speaks Tonight On Society, Social Change
## 
### DOUG OHMANS 
According to 1 Icrbcrt Marcuse, "The containment of social
change is perhaps the most singular achievement of advanced in
dustrial society."' Marcuse, a former professor of politics and
philosophy at Brandcis, will discuss this topic tonight at 7:45
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

Marcuse argues that "the gen-'
oral acceptance of the National
Purpose, bipartisan policy, the
decline of pluralism, the collusion
of Business and Labor within the
strong State, testify to the inte
gration of opposites which is tho
result as well as the prerequisite
of this achievement."
Professor Marcuse arrives this
morning and will be a Guest-in-
Residenec at Toyon on Wednes
day.
He was born in Berlin and came
to the U.S. in 1934, shortly after
receiving his doctorate from the
University of Freiburg.
He lias taught at Columbia,
Harvard, and Yale as well as
Brandcis. He served as a war-time
Senior Analyst for the Office
of Strategic Services.
Now semi-retired, Mareuse will
be a professor of philosophy at
the new University of California
campus in La Jolla.
Marcuse writes in French. Ger
man, and English. Among his
books are "Reason and Revolu
tion," "Eros and Civilization," "So
viet Marxism," and "One-Dimen
sional Man."
Marcuse writes, "The subject
that has conquered matter suf
fers under the dead weight of his
conquest. Those who enforce and

direct this conquest have used it
to create a world . . . which keeps
man enslaved to the prevailing
state of affairs."
"Our society distinguishes itself
by conquering the centrifugal so
cial forces with Technology
rather than Terror," he says.
"This society is irrational as a
whole. Its productivity is destruc
tive of the free development of
human needs and faculties, its
peace maintained by the constant
threat of war, its growth depend
ent on the repression of the real
possibilities for pacifying the
struggle for existenceâ€”individual,
national, and international."
