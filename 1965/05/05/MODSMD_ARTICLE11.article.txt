## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford, the nation's top-rated
college baseball learn according
to Baseball Magazine, got a rest
from the tense CIBA race yester
day, leisurely trouncing the San
Diego Marines, 11-3, at Sunken
i )iamond.

The Marines made four errors,,
and their pitchers hit four Stan
ford batters and walked eight.
Strangely enough, they are the
same team that beat the Indians,
13-12, in a tournament last March.
Centerfielder Bob Cox batted
in four runs wilh a single and!
double to lead the hitters. George
Thacher also had a pair of hits. :
Jim Hibbs hit a single, walked
I twice, and drove in two runs.
Cards Now 25-8
Stanford now has a 25-8 season !
record, and is 23-i> in collegiate i
play. Second-rated USC comes to
the Farm Friday for a game that !
could virtually decide the CIBA
championship.
Four early runs clinched the j
San Diego game. Steve Hovley!
and Thacher singled, with Hovley I
scoring when the Marine short-!
stop threw a Terry Docken i
ground ball into right field on a j
botched-up force play.
â€¢ After Ron Yett walked to load
the bases, Cox cleaned them off
again with a long double.
The Tribe struck again in the
fourth inning. Melzer walked,

Docken singled, Votl forced Mel
zer at third base, and Cox singled
to seore Docken. Hibbs then
whacked a single to center that
plated two more runs. That made
the lead 7-1.
.Marines Yank Pitchers
Then the Marines yanked pitch
er Jerry Potter, whose slow curve
ball and assorted junk pitches
had proved fat targets. The next
two hurlers weren't much better;
Jerry Mortowski walked four In
dian batters in the eighth inning,
two of whom Mike Ottmar batted
in with a single.
Docken went the first three inn
ings for Stanford on the mound.
He allowed an earned run on two
hits. Mike Connolly relieved him
for the next four innings, walk
ing four and striking out four.
Don Cook hurled the final two
stanzas, retiring six in a row.
Stanford has an excellent chance
for its hest won-loss record in 34
years. Six games remain, with the
team now at 25-8. The Indians
were 24-]0 in 1956, and 29-15 in
1953, when they won the CIBA
title.
