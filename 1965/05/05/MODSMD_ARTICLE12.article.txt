# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## UCLA Lands Alcindor 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Not many high school athletes
j Ret so much attention that their
| name is known to the average
i sports fan in every part of the
I country. Low Aleindor, the 7-foot
! 1 Negro basketball star from New
York City, is one of the few. Yes
terday, he held a press conference
(he instantly was one up on most
17 years olds) and announced his
; choice of a college.
Disappointed People
His choice disappointed his par
: ents who wanted him to stay close
! to home and go to St. John's. His
: choice also disappointed his high

school coach, Jack Donahue, who
wanted Lew to follow him to Holy ;
Cross. But most important to the i
local scene, Lew Alcindor's de- j
cision put the Avis label on Stan- j
ford's basketball team for prob \
ably four more years. Yes, UCLA j
has Lew Aleindor (sigh). All i
2,067 points and 2,002 rebounds;
of him.
UCLA has been the scourge of ;
national competition for the last
two years by relying on speed,
agility, and shooting. The Bruins
had to look up at their opponents
almost every game. But at game's
end, the opponent invariably has
been looking up to the Bruins.
Sophomores Mike Lynn and Ed
gar Lacey have given ULCA board
strength, and now they have Al- i
cindor. That's like using a de-'
stroyer as a lifeboat for the S.S.
United States.
Next year will be Stanford's j
year to aim for the title. Aleindor
will be grazing on the freshman
team, waiting for his chance to
join the varsity stampede. Stan
ford has two high-scorers return
ing plus several talented reserves
and a host of promising fresh
men. Led by guards Art Harris !
and Gary Petersmeyer, the Pa j
pooses this past winter played a {
fast, exciting brand of ball high-j
lighted by good ball-handling and >
accurate shooting.
The Cards appear to be able to j
handle Ihe rest of the league ex-1
cept the Bruins. The year after
despite Stanford's potential the j
Cards will be relegated to second j
place, a niche they have occupied '
for the last two years.
•It's What I Want '
In announcing his decision, Al
eindor made the following thought
ful statement. "It was simply
where 4 1 wanted to go. I chose j
UCLA because it has the atmo-!
sphere 1 wanted and because the j
people out there are very nice." In '
saying he likes the atmosphere, I j
hope he doesn't mean he likes |
smog. It would destroy my faith j
in basketball players. And oh, j
yes, even Scrooge would get on '
his knees and purrr if he knew he j
h;td a chance of landing a three- !
time high school All Amereian.

•It's What I Want '
In announcing his decision, Al
eindor made the following thought
ful statement. "It was simply
where 4 1 wanted to go. I chose j
UCLA because it has the atmo-!
sphere 1 wanted and because the j
people out there are very nice." In '
saying he likes the atmosphere, I j
hope he doesn't mean he likes |
smog. It would destroy my faith j
in basketball players. And oh, j
yes, even Scrooge would get on '
his knees and purrr if he knew he j
h;td a chance of landing a three- !
time high school All Amereian.
Not many high school athletes
j Ret so much attention that their
| name is known to the average
i sports fan in every part of the
I country. Low Aleindor, the 7-foot
! 1 Negro basketball star from New
York City, is one of the few. Yes
terday, he held a press conference
(he instantly was one up on most
17 years olds) and announced his
; choice of a college.
Disappointed People
His choice disappointed his par
: ents who wanted him to stay close
! to home and go to St. John's. His
: choice also disappointed his high

school coach, Jack Donahue, who
wanted Lew to follow him to Holy ;
Cross. But most important to the i
local scene, Lew Alcindor's de- j
cision put the Avis label on Stan- j
ford's basketball team for prob \
ably four more years. Yes, UCLA j
has Lew Aleindor (sigh). All i
2,067 points and 2,002 rebounds;
of him.
UCLA has been the scourge of ;
national competition for the last
two years by relying on speed,
agility, and shooting. The Bruins
had to look up at their opponents
almost every game. But at game's
end, the opponent invariably has
been looking up to the Bruins.
Sophomores Mike Lynn and Ed
gar Lacey have given ULCA board
strength, and now they have Al- i
cindor. That's like using a de-'
stroyer as a lifeboat for the S.S.
United States.
Next year will be Stanford's j
year to aim for the title. Aleindor
will be grazing on the freshman
team, waiting for his chance to
join the varsity stampede. Stan
ford has two high-scorers return
ing plus several talented reserves
and a host of promising fresh
men. Led by guards Art Harris !
and Gary Petersmeyer, the Pa j
pooses this past winter played a {
fast, exciting brand of ball high-j
lighted by good ball-handling and >
accurate shooting.
The Cards appear to be able to j
handle Ihe rest of the league ex-1
cept the Bruins. The year after
despite Stanford's potential the j
Cards will be relegated to second j
place, a niche they have occupied '
for the last two years.
