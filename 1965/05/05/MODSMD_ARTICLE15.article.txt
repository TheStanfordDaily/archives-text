# ACADEMIC AFFAIRS
## 'An Agreeable Possibility' 
### PRES PATTY COVEY JOHANNES CLIMACUS (Seventh in a Series 
In his preface to Father Richardson's Iwok,
Heidegger, Through Phenomenology to Thought,
Heidegger demonstrates an acute awareness of the
so-called bane of authentic philosophy and educa
tion, ironic indifference- "an almost insurmount
able difficulty in making oneself understood:"
It is with some hestiatation that I attempt
to answer the two principal questions you posed
... I hesitate with my answers, for they are nec
essarily no more than indications of much more to
Im> said. The lesson of long experience leads me to
surmise that such indications will not be taken
as directions for the road of independent reflec
tion on the matter pointed out which each must
travel for himself. Instead they will gain notice
a.s though they were an opinion I had expressed,
and will be propagated as such.
Heidegger's opinion all to the good, in this day
and age of busy people of many affairs we can't
all afford the luxury of leisurely philosophizing.
Therefore, we practically-minded authors, equally
sincere and animated in our search for truth and
education as the so-called authentic philosophers—
we practically-minded authors care to take this oc
casion to speak to the practically-minded student,
to provide that student not with a life-time exercise
in thought, but with the kind of ideas a person can
get his teeth into and digest over a harried break
fast, with grist for the mill, so to speak.
Intellectual Ruminations
We agree with a philosophy of education which
has gained increasing stature among students and
professors the nation over, that of Intellectual
Ruminations (cuds). Recent proponents of this up
to-date approach to education include the distin
guished Professor Mortimer J. Adler (Great
Rooks) and more recently the learned Frank N.
Magill, a Columbia Ph.D., originator and editor of
Masterplots, Digests of World Literature:
It would literally take a lifetime to read 3000
years of great literature and the investment and
storage space needed would stagger the most
prosperous citizen. That's why Editor Frank N.
Magill began MASTEPLOTS in 1946. His aim
was to popularize the "classics" so that, busy
people could absorb the works of great men in
a short time. Ilis MASTERPLOTS does just that!
With its 1510 quick-reference digests you can
easily sample any of the World's Finest Classics
in 5 minutes. Here is perhaps the quickest way to
taste as many of the classics as possible without
becoming engulfed in the details . . . The most
profound thoughts, ideas ands tatements ever writ
ten during the past 3000 years are here condensed
ami summarized so that you will have them at
your fingertips for instant reference.
In this spirit we offer not a high-density treatise
but some provocative selections from an exem
plary study in philosophy and education, Soren Kier

kegaard, tailored to the needs of the present-day
intellectual and educational reformer:
Difficulties Everywhere
". . . Wherever you look, in literature and In
life, you see the admired names and figures . . .
tiie benefactors of the age who know how to make
themselves useful to mankind by making life easier
and easier for people . . . Out of love for mankind,
and in desperation at my embarrassing position,
seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was
unable to make anything easier than it had been
made, and with a true interest in those who make
everything easy, I conceived it to bo my task to
create difficulties everywhere."
Said Loudly
"And let it be said as loudly as possible, and
would that it might be heard everywhere, and
would to God that wherever it is heard it might be
heeded: the evil in our day is not the Establish
ment with its may faults; no, the evil in our day
is just this evil inclination, this flirting with re
form, this forgery of wanting to refrom without
once having a conception, not to say a lofty con
ception, of how exceedingly lofty the thought of 're
formation' is; this hypocrisy of escaping from the
consciousness of one's own incapacity by busying
oneself with the diversion of wanting to reform ...
a thing which our age has not the least capacity
for."
Too Near
"Yet all too near lies the way of error, the will
to reform and awaken the whole world . . . instead
of oneself—and this is .just the path for restless
heads with much imagination."
A Sad Reflection
"In one place in a Psalm it is said of the rich
man that he heaps up treasures with great toil 'and
knoweth not who shall inherit them.' So shall I
leave behind me, in an intellectual sense, a capital
by no means insignificant—and, alas, I know also
who will be my heir. It is he, that figure so exceed
ingly distasteful to me, he that till now has in
herited all that is best and will continue to do so:
the Docent, the Professor.
"Note. And even if the 'Professor' should chance
to read this, it will not give him pause, will not
cause his conscience to smite him; no, this too will
be made the subject of a lecture. And again this ob
servation, if the Professor should chance to read it,
will not give him pause; no, this too will be made
the subject of a lecture. For longer even that the
tape-worm which was extracted from a woman
(according to a recent advertisement in which the
husband expresses his gratitude and gives the
length as 100 yards)—even longer is the Pro
fessor ..."
A Disagreeable Possibility
And even longer are we, authors and readers—
the Student —as we daily strike his posture of
ironic indifference, as we daily grow more com
fortably into his image. (Equally sincere and
animated in our search for truth and education.)

formation' is; this hypocrisy of escaping from the
consciousness of one's own incapacity by busying
oneself with the diversion of wanting to reform ...
a thing which our age has not the least capacity
for."
Too Near
"Yet all too near lies the way of error, the will
to reform and awaken the whole world . . . instead
of oneself—and this is .just the path for restless
heads with much imagination."
A Sad Reflection
"In one place in a Psalm it is said of the rich
man that he heaps up treasures with great toil 'and
knoweth not who shall inherit them.' So shall I
leave behind me, in an intellectual sense, a capital
by no means insignificant—and, alas, I know also
who will be my heir. It is he, that figure so exceed
ingly distasteful to me, he that till now has in
herited all that is best and will continue to do so:
the Docent, the Professor.
"Note. And even if the 'Professor' should chance
to read this, it will not give him pause, will not
cause his conscience to smite him; no, this too will
be made the subject of a lecture. And again this ob
servation, if the Professor should chance to read it,
will not give him pause; no, this too will be made
the subject of a lecture. For longer even that the
tape-worm which was extracted from a woman
(according to a recent advertisement in which the
husband expresses his gratitude and gives the
length as 100 yards)—even longer is the Pro
fessor ..."
A Disagreeable Possibility
And even longer are we, authors and readers—
the Student —as we daily strike his posture of
ironic indifference, as we daily grow more com
fortably into his image. (Equally sincere and
animated in our search for truth and education.)
In his preface to Father Richardson's Iwok,
Heidegger, Through Phenomenology to Thought,
Heidegger demonstrates an acute awareness of the
so-called bane of authentic philosophy and educa
tion, ironic indifference- "an almost insurmount
able difficulty in making oneself understood:"
It is with some hestiatation that I attempt
to answer the two principal questions you posed
... I hesitate with my answers, for they are nec
essarily no more than indications of much more to
Im> said. The lesson of long experience leads me to
surmise that such indications will not be taken
as directions for the road of independent reflec
tion on the matter pointed out which each must
travel for himself. Instead they will gain notice
a.s though they were an opinion I had expressed,
and will be propagated as such.
Heidegger's opinion all to the good, in this day
and age of busy people of many affairs we can't
all afford the luxury of leisurely philosophizing.
Therefore, we practically-minded authors, equally
sincere and animated in our search for truth and
education as the so-called authentic philosophers—
we practically-minded authors care to take this oc
casion to speak to the practically-minded student,
to provide that student not with a life-time exercise
in thought, but with the kind of ideas a person can
get his teeth into and digest over a harried break
fast, with grist for the mill, so to speak.
Intellectual Ruminations
We agree with a philosophy of education which
has gained increasing stature among students and
professors the nation over, that of Intellectual
Ruminations (cuds). Recent proponents of this up
to-date approach to education include the distin
guished Professor Mortimer J. Adler (Great
Rooks) and more recently the learned Frank N.
Magill, a Columbia Ph.D., originator and editor of
Masterplots, Digests of World Literature:
It would literally take a lifetime to read 3000
years of great literature and the investment and
storage space needed would stagger the most
prosperous citizen. That's why Editor Frank N.
Magill began MASTEPLOTS in 1946. His aim
was to popularize the "classics" so that, busy
people could absorb the works of great men in
a short time. Ilis MASTERPLOTS does just that!
With its 1510 quick-reference digests you can
easily sample any of the World's Finest Classics
in 5 minutes. Here is perhaps the quickest way to
taste as many of the classics as possible without
becoming engulfed in the details . . . The most
profound thoughts, ideas ands tatements ever writ
ten during the past 3000 years are here condensed
ami summarized so that you will have them at
your fingertips for instant reference.
In this spirit we offer not a high-density treatise
but some provocative selections from an exem
plary study in philosophy and education, Soren Kier

kegaard, tailored to the needs of the present-day
intellectual and educational reformer:
Difficulties Everywhere
". . . Wherever you look, in literature and In
life, you see the admired names and figures . . .
tiie benefactors of the age who know how to make
themselves useful to mankind by making life easier
and easier for people . . . Out of love for mankind,
and in desperation at my embarrassing position,
seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was
unable to make anything easier than it had been
made, and with a true interest in those who make
everything easy, I conceived it to bo my task to
create difficulties everywhere."

"And let it be said as loudly as possible, and
would that it might be heard everywhere, and
would to God that wherever it is heard it might be
heeded: the evil in our day is not the Establish
ment with its may faults; no, the evil in our day
is just this evil inclination, this flirting with re
form, this forgery of wanting to refrom without

a short time. Ilis MASTERPLOTS does just that!
With its 1510 quick-reference digests you can
easily sample any of the World's Finest Classics
in 5 minutes. Here is perhaps the quickest way to
taste as many of the classics as possible without
becoming engulfed in the details . . . The most
profound thoughts, ideas ands tatements ever writ
ten during the past 3000 years are here condensed
ami summarized so that you will have them at
your fingertips for instant reference.
In this spirit we offer not a high-density treatise
but some provocative selections from an exem
plary study in philosophy and education, Soren Kier

kegaard, tailored to the needs of the present-day
intellectual and educational reformer:
Difficulties Everywhere
". . . Wherever you look, in literature and In
life, you see the admired names and figures . . .
tiie benefactors of the age who know how to make
themselves useful to mankind by making life easier
and easier for people . . . Out of love for mankind,
and in desperation at my embarrassing position,
seeing that I had accomplished nothing and was
unable to make anything easier than it had been
made, and with a true interest in those who make
everything easy, I conceived it to bo my task to
create difficulties everywhere."
Said Loudly
"And let it be said as loudly as possible, and
would that it might be heard everywhere, and
would to God that wherever it is heard it might be
heeded: the evil in our day is not the Establish
ment with its may faults; no, the evil in our day
is just this evil inclination, this flirting with re
form, this forgery of wanting to refrom without
once having a conception, not to say a lofty con
ception, of how exceedingly lofty the thought of 're
formation' is; this hypocrisy of escaping from the
consciousness of one's own incapacity by busying
oneself with the diversion of wanting to reform ...
a thing which our age has not the least capacity
for."
Too Near
"Yet all too near lies the way of error, the will
to reform and awaken the whole world . . . instead
of oneself—and this is .just the path for restless
heads with much imagination."
A Sad Reflection
"In one place in a Psalm it is said of the rich
man that he heaps up treasures with great toil 'and
knoweth not who shall inherit them.' So shall I
leave behind me, in an intellectual sense, a capital
by no means insignificant—and, alas, I know also
who will be my heir. It is he, that figure so exceed
ingly distasteful to me, he that till now has in
herited all that is best and will continue to do so:
the Docent, the Professor.
"Note. And even if the 'Professor' should chance
to read this, it will not give him pause, will not
cause his conscience to smite him; no, this too will
be made the subject of a lecture. And again this ob
servation, if the Professor should chance to read it,
will not give him pause; no, this too will be made
the subject of a lecture. For longer even that the
tape-worm which was extracted from a woman
(according to a recent advertisement in which the
husband expresses his gratitude and gives the
length as 100 yards)—even longer is the Pro
fessor ..."
A Disagreeable Possibility
And even longer are we, authors and readers—
the Student —as we daily strike his posture of
ironic indifference, as we daily grow more com
fortably into his image. (Equally sincere and
animated in our search for truth and education.)
In his preface to Father Richardson's Iwok,
Heidegger, Through Phenomenology to Thought,
Heidegger demonstrates an acute awareness of the
so-called bane of authentic philosophy and educa
tion, ironic indifference- "an almost insurmount
able difficulty in making oneself understood:"
It is with some hestiatation that I attempt
to answer the two principal questions you posed
... I hesitate with my answers, for they are nec
essarily no more than indications of much more to
Im> said. The lesson of long experience leads me to
surmise that such indications will not be taken
as directions for the road of independent reflec
tion on the matter pointed out which each must
travel for himself. Instead they will gain notice
a.s though they were an opinion I had expressed,
and will be propagated as such.
Heidegger's opinion all to the good, in this day
and age of busy people of many affairs we can't
all afford the luxury of leisurely philosophizing.
Therefore, we practically-minded authors, equally
sincere and animated in our search for truth and
education as the so-called authentic philosophers—
we practically-minded authors care to take this oc
casion to speak to the practically-minded student,
to provide that student not with a life-time exercise
in thought, but with the kind of ideas a person can
get his teeth into and digest over a harried break
fast, with grist for the mill, so to speak.
Intellectual Ruminations
We agree with a philosophy of education which
has gained increasing stature among students and
professors the nation over, that of Intellectual
Ruminations (cuds). Recent proponents of this up
to-date approach to education include the distin
guished Professor Mortimer J. Adler (Great
Rooks) and more recently the learned Frank N.
Magill, a Columbia Ph.D., originator and editor of
Masterplots, Digests of World Literature:
It would literally take a lifetime to read 3000
years of great literature and the investment and
storage space needed would stagger the most
prosperous citizen. That's why Editor Frank N.
Magill began MASTEPLOTS in 1946. His aim
was to popularize the "classics" so that, busy
people could absorb the works of great men in
a short time. Ilis MASTERPLOTS does just that!
