## Pontius No Ranter 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
1 found particularly offensive
tiie bit of editorializing in the
headline of the report on the ar
rest of Professor Dale Pontius in
San Francisco in today's l>ailv:
•PONTIUS RANTS ON VIET
policy:
A tone of sarcasm gratuitously!
expressed in a news story would
be regrettable in any situation, but
is especially disheartening in light
of the courage and integrity dis- i
played in Dr. Pontius' gesture, j
In his fervent desire to raise con J
corn about the immoral and self j
defeating U.S. foreign policy in j
Vietnam, Dr. Pontius broke no law
nor infringed upon anyone' free
dom, but acted fully within his
constitutional rights. His case is
being defended by the American
Civil Liberties Union.
At a time when faculties and I
students all over the nation -in
cluding at Stanford are uniling
the academic community in pro
test against Iho disastrous course
of America's present foreign pol
icy, it would seem that Profes
sor Pontius' action should elicit
our res poet and admiration rather
than our contempt.

• SNCC and Vietnam
Editor, The Daily:
Donald Kaufman's letter to the
editor on Monday in reference to
Charles Countee's reputed activity
in SNCC contained a somewhat
distressing statement. Ho states
that it should be "obvious" that

Mr. Countee was not a staff
worker for SNCC "if only for his
views on the situation in Viet-1
Nam."
Does Mr. Kaul'man really moan i
to imply that a person sympathiz
ing with SNCC and the civil rights
work in the U.S. must automatic
ally come to the conclusion that
President Johnson's present pol
icies in South Viet-Nam are un-,
supportable? Mr. Kaufman may
not mean to make this implica
tion, hut it is certainly the one 1
infer from reading his letter.
This indiscriminate mixing of
the civil rights problems of the
U.S. Negro and the U.S. foreign I
policy problems of the Viet-Nam
war is visible in several other
places. For instance, at the April I
2."j benefit for SNCC in San Fran-1
cisco there were several groups j
handing out literature against ;
Johnson's Viet-Nam policy.
Now of course this doesn't im-<
ply that the SNCC itself is in
volved in trying to end the Viet-
Nam war; but I think it does
show that there are people who
are trying to simultaneously solve
two very complex problems. At
tempts to draw meaningful paral
lels between the civil rights prob
lems and the Viet-Nam conflict
problems when deciding a course
of action can in the end only con
fuse both problems. Each of the
situations is in itself worthy of
undivided attention, and a con
clusion of what is best in one
case says nothing about what is
best in the other.
