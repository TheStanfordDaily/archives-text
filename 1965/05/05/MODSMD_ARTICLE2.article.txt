# Donner Men Fight Imposed Club Dues
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
The Administration has rejected an appeal by three students
in Donner House, Stern Hall, who have sought to avoid paying
their 'club dues' for this quarter.
Hob Suffle, spokesman for the group, told Tlic Daily that the
issue was whether 'club dues'—an assessment Un cled each quarter

by the houses for various house
functions—should be compulsory
and part of each student's room
and board bill.
Club dues in Donner this quar
ter are $14.
Suffle presented Donner House
President Barry Wilder with a pe
tition earlier this quarter which
stated in part that "whereas the
principle of an independent house
is that each member may decide
those activities in which he
wishes or does not wish to par
ticipate," the aforementioned stu
dents should be excluded from
paying house dues "as we do not
wish to participate in any house
112 u net ions whatsoever."
The three who signed the peti
tion were Suffle, .Ronald Brick
man. and Howard Hoffman.
Payment N<>( Compulsory?
Suffle made the move in part
because John Forsberg, Director
of Residences, had told him that
as far as he knew the University
would not and could not compel
payment. Suffle also discovered
that the Donner House Constitu
tion has no provision that re
quires all house members to pay
the dues.
After his request was refused

by Wilder and William Belvins,
Director of Stern Hall, Suffle pe
titioned the Administrative Com
mittee on Residences and Food
Services.
This petition noted that the Uni
versity, in enforcing the payment
of club dues" which arc used in
part to finance parties where al
coholic beverages are served . . .
is hypocritically forcing financial
support for functions which it
says are in violation of the Fund
mental Standard."
Moreover, the petition also
charged that "minorities in inde
pendent houses have no moans of
working within their house gov
ernment structures to change
such assessments" and urged that
payment of such dues should be
placed on a voluntary basis.
