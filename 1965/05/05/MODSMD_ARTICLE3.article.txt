### JOEL KUGELMASS DOUG OILMAN'S 
Herbert Marcuse, the eminent philosopher from Hrandeis, sal
: yesterday in Conner house's ehilly guest room and discussed topics
j ranging from Jean-Paul Sartre to the underdeveloped nations.
In student activism Marcuse saw a movement which "may be the
j first step away from an uncritical acceptance of the world.' In

the last two years, he said, stu-*
dents have begun to experience
the "confrontation of ideology
and actuality."
Marcuse voiced the need foi
st udents not to confine their
throughts and acts to the univer
sity. "Education is political educa
tion," he said. Ho cites the fact
that the student civil rights move
ment can continue in the face of
Viet Nam as evidence of the per
manence of the student revolu
tion.
Viet Policy Fatal
"Our policy in Viet Nam is j
fatal," said Marcuse. "Their war
is a civil war, and we cannot I
justify our intervention in it." j
Marcuse attacked the argument
based on our national interest.
"Where do we ever draw the
line?" he asked.
He cited the dilema by which
both East and West are forced
to compete for underdeveloped
nations. He deplored imposing
modern industrial techniques on
countries not ready for them.
Professor Marcuse studied for
four years with Heidigger, and
admits that it took him that long
to discover "the dangers of ex
istentialism." "It was no accident
that Heidigger became a Nazi," he
said.
Ambivalent on Sartre
He admires Sartre most of the
existentialists, but disagrees with
Sartre on Sartre's high evalua
tion of "Saint Genet." "I cannot
read the man," he said. Marcuse
prefers Beckett and Frisch.

He called literature a "meta
language capable of revealing
truths not expressable in other
forms." He criticized the trentd
toward empiricism and away
from historical explanations. "We
are experiencing not only a rio
emphasis but a depression of
history," he said. "We fear the
past because it exposes the con
nections of the present."
