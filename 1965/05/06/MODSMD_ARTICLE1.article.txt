• (-mi fire Shatters New Dominican Accord
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic—Gunfire wounded four
U.S. troops in a violent new outburst here yesterday after the sign
ing of an amplified cease-fire agreement in the Dominican civil war.
And a U.S. official charged that the rebel movement is Red-con
trolled and its provisional president is "moving closer to the Com
munists."
There were unconfirmed reports that at least four American
soldiers were captured by the rebels in clashes after the insurgents
and the rival military junta signed a document expanding and
ratifying the cease-fire they agreed on last week.
The latest casualties brought to 56 the number of U.S. battle
wounded. Seven Americans have died since President Johnson or
dered U.S. forces into Santo Domingo a week ago to protect U.S.
lives and prevent a Communist takeover.
The ceasefire agreement has the immediate aim of ending hos
tilities between the rival Dominicans until a political settlement can
be reached on the issues that caused bloody civil war to break out 12
days ago. It does not affect U.S. military positions.

forces to Santo Domingo as necessary to halt a Communist take
over.
He declared pro-Castro leaders were in the streets of Santo Do
mingo providing military and political leadership to the rebels within
an hour or two after the revolt started.
He read out the names of nine Communist leaders he said were
actively involved in Communist attempts to seize control. Heading
the list was Manuel Gonzalez Gonzalez, described by Stevenson as a
Spanish Communist and "a reported Cuban intelligence agent."

capital of Hanoi.
