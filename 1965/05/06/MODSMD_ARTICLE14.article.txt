## 
### TOM EDISON 
Stupid and costly errors lost
j tho first of Uvo games in a four
j team tournament last weekend for
Stanford's lacrosse team perform
ing in the air that surrounds Los
| Angeles.
Stanford was beaten in tho first
game at Claremont College 8-5 to
! undefeated and eventual tourney
| champion Arizona. The Indians
| won their second game 10-4
| against the University of Utah
| to take third place behind Arizona
iand Claremont.
Arizona, in compiling a perfect
, 10-0 season record, may have been
j a slightly superior team, but their
play, nonetheless, was not hin
| dered when Stanford began mak
: ing poor passes and started hand
ling out scoring opportunities.
J Arizona won the game in the sec
ond half.
Arizona Scores First
Arizona scored first and .before
; Glenn Thomas fired in Stanford's
| first point, Arizona had scored
j twice more.
The Indians seemed to adjust
to the smog and thin air scoring
two goals in the second quarter,
I pulling up to Arizona 4-3 with
! Thomas throwing in another. Con
sistent Doug Ramsey, a freshman,
I rammed in Stanford's other score.

Then came the disastrous sec-;
ond half. The squad had been |
; playing even with Arizona but un- 1
! even became Stanford's play in
| the final two periods. A pair of
bounce scores by Sandy Saxton
were the only high points of Stan- 1
i ford's play.
Cards Defeat Utah
The following day Stanford
jumped off to a early 4-0 lead
against Utah and finished easily |
with a 10-4 victory.
Stanford played a different
game not only in perfecting their
passing and scoring but also in
their tactics. The Indians used
i speed to break. Utah.
Chip Greening led a defensive
unit that, was very successful in
holding Utah's pentration.
Stanford's Bob Murphy's effect!
almost wrecked Utah's net. He
scored four goals. Tuck Peterson
made several assists with aid also
coming from mid-fielders Bob
I Hawkins and Jim Wood roe.
