### PETE DOLAN 
A proposed anti-poverty "sister city" plan between Palo Alto and i
South Dos Palos, Merced County, has caused mixed reaction in the j
Palo Alto City Council. Official approval ol" the project was withheld |
pending submission of more specific plans to the council.
Raymond H. Mcßcdmond, spokesman for the group of businessmen i

and industrialists who are iniliat--*
ing the program, explained its |
goals Tuesday evening in a tele-;
phone interview with The Daily.
South Dos Palos, a small unin-1
corporated community near Dos i
Palos, has a neighborhood of I
about 240 families of Mexican and '
Negro field hands. There is no j
business in the community, and j
the only employment is during the j
summer months. Wages of three
months work must feed the fam
ilies for the entire year.
As a result, according to Mc-
Redmond, "There are 210 families
without running water or sewers,
and a general housing shortage.
They are paid good wages for {
three months oul of a year, and
the rest of the time they are vir-j
tually starving."

Mcßedmond sought the city
council's sanction an as aid in
seeking the support of Palo Altans |
for the project. Mcßedmond j
stated that the group, with thcj
council's sanction would attempt
"to use latent talent in Palo
Alto to advise and help build bet
ter housing and sewers in South ;
Dos Palos."
A set of plans for developing the |
program has been unofficially!
submitted to the mayor and coun-1
cilmen of Palo Alto. The plans
will again be considered at the
next meeting of the council.
