## Theory of Structure Chaos 
### MARK R. LOHMAN 
This is a theory which is related in an import
ant way to the concept of "commitment to educa
tion." Therefore underlying this presentation is
the assumption that commitment is an essential
part of the genuine intellectual and that the de
velopment of the intellect is the main business of
undergraduate education at Stanford.
Structure refers to those "elements" in a social
system which are consciously created by men.
These elements exist for the purpose of either re
straining an individual's behavior (i.e. Fundamental
Stanford) or directing an individual's energy in
a specific direction (i.e. course requirements for
a major). Behavior which follows the lines es
tablished by a structure shall be called "congru
ent."
Chaos refers to behavior that is not "congruent"
â€”at least it does not follow the lines that are pre
scribed by a particular social structure. Chaos may
be of two kinds either in the form of freedom or
rebellion. The distinction between the two is that
freedom, as a form of behavior, takes place within
tiie constraints set by the structure whereas re
bellion takes place outside the structure.
The .Middle Ground
In building a structure, care must be taken to
construct the lines appropriately. If the lines are
drawn too rigidly and the individual student is un
able to pursue a satisfactory arrangement of
courses, then he is either forced into a quiet sub
mission or else he becomes rebellious. On tlie
other hand, if the structure is much too loose,
then many students will be unable to channel their
energies into appropriate fields that can meet the
demands of a complex society. Both of these condi
tions, extreme rigidity or extreme chaos, create
many obstacles for the student who is seeking a
true sense of commitment.
For example, many students would argue that
structural lines are much too rigid in the engineer
ing field.
On alternative for students who face a rigid
structure is to rebel. But rebellion carries along
with it may problems which are not necessarily
beneficial for a student who is seeking genuine
commitment.
Freedom is the middle ground between conform

ity and rebellion. It represents the unique way in
which a student chooses to find his own sense of
commitment and carry out the demands of real
inquiry. At Stanford, freedom involves a choice
of major and within that major a choice of op
tional courses. Freedom is behavior that tries out
courses in other departments or pursues the ideas
of a particular man from many different points of
view. It is the unique way in which the self can
bend reality to its own interests.
Inter-discipli nary 31 ajor s
Given this model of structural-chaos and in light
of the new conditions of social reality in our so
ciety, I am suggesting that the structural lines
must lie re-drawn at Stanford in a more flexible
fashion such that more of today's students will
be able to discover a meaningful commitment.
Of major importance the Academic Council
should consider the possibility of offering a non
major academic program at Stanford. The student
would be required to fulfill a general studies pro
gram (although much re-thinking is needed here,
tool and the usual 180 units of academic work in
order to graduate. There should be some evidence
by the junior year that the student, is working
closely with a faculty member and as a require
ment some faculty member should approve of hjs
study plan.
Also, immediate consideration should be given
toward interdisciplinary majors. This implies that
departments must be able to do more communi
cating with one another than is now apparent.
Such communication and attempts to work out a
joint academic program might be the beginnings
of some healthy interaction between the depart
ments.
The enactment of some of these proposals would
constitute a real re-structuring of the available
paths of study at Stanford. The appropriateness
of the word 'chaos' as a generalized means of de
scribing the intellectual process for discovering
commitment can best be understood by the archaic
definition of the word. 'Chaos' was often used to
describe the formless state of the universe prior
to the creation of an ordered solar system. In a
similar sense, the first two or three years at Stan
lord should permit and encourage a healthy chaos
for the student who is honestly seeking a lifelong
commitment to inquiry.
