## Female Voting: Too Many Dollies Spoil the Broth 
### Justin Beck 
In 1920, with tin* 19tli amendment women received the right to
vote in national elections. The error has never been rectified.
At Stanford women also have the right to vote in ASSU
elections, a right accepted with unrestrained glee in such places
as Roble and Brainier.

Of course their glee is nof
matched among campus politi
cians who know what motivates
our ballot box bound dollies. And
usually it is issues that are last
in any young girl's mind when she
thinks about candidates.
A few examples of the Future
Mothers of America minds in ac
tion might demonstrate what the
candidates are up against in try
ing to pierce the curtain of ignor
ance that surrounds the frosh
dollies' dorms.
The prime example is, of course,
the recent petition on off-campus
issues that swept Roble faster
than an epidemic of Asian flu.
No one, especially the girls pass
ing out the petition, had any real
idea of what was involved in the
petition, or what the facts were.
The Herd Instinct
Not that that bothered them.
Like last year's crop of lemmings
they all saw where the crowd
was heading, and rather than get
trampled they joined in. If im
morality could be put on a peti-j
tion and passed through Roble
Hall, there'd probably be enough
action to make the San Fran
cisco police forget North Beach.
It's not that the frosh are
stupid, for according to Time
they aren't, but rather that they
are sadly uninformed. So unin
formed that they didn't even
know where to begin to acquire
I the facts to make any intelligent
I decisions.
One pretty blue-eyed, blonde
j freshman from the prairies of
I Kansas typifies the naivete of
jour dollies when it comes to stu
| dent politics. She freely admits
that she worked hard for one
j of the candidates. In almost the
same breath she admits that she
I didn't know what the issues were,
! or where her candidate stood,
j on the issues, but, as she says,"I
|"I know he had some."
She says,"I worked for him j
| because I was asked to. In
high school I worked on student
campaigns and am used to that
j kind of work." She also admits
| that the only reason that she was
committed t<> vote for her can
i didate was because she was work
j ing on his campaign.
'Rule Ambivalence'
Oh yes, during the primary she j
was for Magnuson, or at least she j
signed his petition. But she does-j
n't know w hat ambivalence
I means.
Of course not all the girls are
as enthusiastically uninformed
as our Kansan. Some of them ae-
I tually take the time to study the
i issues and hear the candidates
| before — or on occasion after —
i committing themselves.
Unfortunately those are a mi
' nority. The rest reach their de
cision on the flimsiest of reasons,
lacking the interest or perhaps
the common sense to probe any
deeper. One result of such action,
by no means limited to frosh dol-;
lies, is that no ASSU campaign j
ever evolves above the most su-;
perficial discussion of the most j
superficial issues.
A post-election story about an
other frosh girl is going around.
! She voted for Robbins because a
; football player told her that if
! Robbins won Stanford would go
I to the Rose Bowl next year. Foot
; ball coach John Ralston apparent
: ly wasn't aware that the fate of
! next year's football team hung

on the ASSU elections — or at
least he hasn't demanded a re
count yet.
One frosh dollie went through
this breathtaking process before
casting her ballot: She was pro
fraternity because she wanted to
live in a sorority. She liked soror
ities because she didn't like some
of the girls in her dorm and didn't
think that people should have to
live with people that they didn't
like. Robbins didn't think so
either. Therefore, one vote for
Robbins. Q.E.D.
Another frosh dollie voted for
Mackenzie because "he's the sec
ond greatest guy in the world."
And who's the greatest? Her boy
friend, of course. Sorry Cassius,
but you only think you're the
greatest. You're actually third
greatest, at best.
It's all very entertaining to see
the feminine mind at work in
such matters. It adds humor to an
otherwise dull campaign. Wash
ing dishes and keeping house, one
lias to admit, are well within
female capabilities but student
politics evidently is not. While the
women of this campus supply
campaign secretaries and ardent
workers, their intellectual contri
butions to the campaign are al
most nil, as is their ability to
deal in any but the most im
mature manner with the issues
raised by the candidates.
One solution to this problem of
uninformed women in politics
might be a return to the system
used here many years ago when
women took little part in the
ASSU elections but merely con
cerned themselves with the AWS
contest, a more fitting field for
the rather limited political skill of
Stanford women. At least then
their ignorance would only affect
themselves.
It is true that without the eager
labor of enthusiastic frosh much
of the horsepower that drives a
successful campaign would bo
lacking. Rut aside from secre
tarial work, those girls perform
no useful function in the cam
paign, except attempting to per
suade other equally ignorant girls
to vote for their candidate. They,
of course, have no ability to con
vince members of the other sex
of anything political.
So, aside from losing a few of
fice workers, the campaign ap
partatus would be unimpared.
And as a bonus the candidates
would have more time to devote
to that part of the electorate
which votes on the issues, not on
the intangibles that seem to cloud
the female intellect. The elimina
tion of the politically ignorant
and absurd from the campaign
may very well be worth the price
of a few typists.

No one, especially the girls pass
ing out the petition, had any real
idea of what was involved in the
petition, or what the facts were.
The Herd Instinct
Not that that bothered them.
Like last year's crop of lemmings
they all saw where the crowd
was heading, and rather than get
trampled they joined in. If im
morality could be put on a peti-j
tion and passed through Roble
Hall, there'd probably be enough
action to make the San Fran
cisco police forget North Beach.
It's not that the frosh are
stupid, for according to Time
they aren't, but rather that they
are sadly uninformed. So unin
formed that they didn't even
know where to begin to acquire
I the facts to make any intelligent
I decisions.
One pretty blue-eyed, blonde
j freshman from the prairies of
I Kansas typifies the naivete of
jour dollies when it comes to stu

that she worked hard for one
j of the candidates. In almost the
same breath she admits that she
I didn't know what the issues were,
! or where her candidate stood,
j on the issues, but, as she says,"I
|"I know he had some."
She says,"I worked for him j
| because I was asked to. In
high school I worked on student
campaigns and am used to that
j kind of work." She also admits
| that the only reason that she was
committed t<> vote for her can
i didate was because she was work
j ing on his campaign.
'Rule Ambivalence'
Oh yes, during the primary she j
was for Magnuson, or at least she j
signed his petition. But she does-j
n't know w hat ambivalence
I means.
Of course not all the girls are
as enthusiastically uninformed
as our Kansan. Some of them ae-
I tually take the time to study the
i issues and hear the candidates
| before — or on occasion after —
i committing themselves.
Unfortunately those are a mi
' nority. The rest reach their de
cision on the flimsiest of reasons,
lacking the interest or perhaps
the common sense to probe any
deeper. One result of such action,
by no means limited to frosh dol-;
lies, is that no ASSU campaign j
ever evolves above the most su-;
perficial discussion of the most j
superficial issues.
A post-election story about an
other frosh girl is going around.
! She voted for Robbins because a
; football player told her that if
! Robbins won Stanford would go
I to the Rose Bowl next year. Foot
; ball coach John Ralston apparent
: ly wasn't aware that the fate of
! next year's football team hung

on the ASSU elections — or at
least he hasn't demanded a re
count yet.
One frosh dollie went through
this breathtaking process before
casting her ballot: She was pro
fraternity because she wanted to
live in a sorority. She liked soror
ities because she didn't like some
of the girls in her dorm and didn't
think that people should have to
live with people that they didn't
like. Robbins didn't think so
either. Therefore, one vote for
Robbins. Q.E.D.
Another frosh dollie voted for
Mackenzie because "he's the sec
ond greatest guy in the world."
And who's the greatest? Her boy
friend, of course. Sorry Cassius,
but you only think you're the
greatest. You're actually third
greatest, at best.
It's all very entertaining to see
the feminine mind at work in
such matters. It adds humor to an
otherwise dull campaign. Wash
ing dishes and keeping house, one
lias to admit, are well within
female capabilities but student
politics evidently is not. While the
women of this campus supply
campaign secretaries and ardent
workers, their intellectual contri
butions to the campaign are al
most nil, as is their ability to
deal in any but the most im
mature manner with the issues
raised by the candidates.
One solution to this problem of
uninformed women in politics
might be a return to the system
used here many years ago when
women took little part in the
ASSU elections but merely con
cerned themselves with the AWS
contest, a more fitting field for
the rather limited political skill of
Stanford women. At least then
their ignorance would only affect
themselves.
It is true that without the eager
labor of enthusiastic frosh much
of the horsepower that drives a
successful campaign would bo
lacking. Rut aside from secre
tarial work, those girls perform
no useful function in the cam
paign, except attempting to per
suade other equally ignorant girls
to vote for their candidate. They,
of course, have no ability to con
vince members of the other sex
of anything political.
So, aside from losing a few of
fice workers, the campaign ap
partatus would be unimpared.
And as a bonus the candidates
would have more time to devote
to that part of the electorate
which votes on the issues, not on
the intangibles that seem to cloud
the female intellect. The elimina
tion of the politically ignorant
and absurd from the campaign
may very well be worth the price
of a few typists.
In 1920, with tin* 19tli amendment women received the right to
vote in national elections. The error has never been rectified.
At Stanford women also have the right to vote in ASSU
elections, a right accepted with unrestrained glee in such places
as Roble and Brainier.

Of course their glee is nof
matched among campus politi
cians who know what motivates
our ballot box bound dollies. And
usually it is issues that are last
in any young girl's mind when she
thinks about candidates.
A few examples of the Future
Mothers of America minds in ac
tion might demonstrate what the
candidates are up against in try
ing to pierce the curtain of ignor
ance that surrounds the frosh

The prime example is, of course,
the recent petition on off-campus

that she worked hard for one
j of the candidates. In almost the

I didn't know what the issues were,
! or where her candidate stood,
j on the issues, but, as she says,"I
|"I know he had some."
She says,"I worked for him j

high school I worked on student
campaigns and am used to that
j kind of work." She also admits

committed t<> vote for her can

j ing on his campaign.
'Rule Ambivalence'
Oh yes, during the primary she j
was for Magnuson, or at least she j
signed his petition. But she does-j
n't know w hat ambivalence
I means.
Of course not all the girls are
as enthusiastically uninformed
as our Kansan. Some of them ae-
I tually take the time to study the
i issues and hear the candidates
| before — or on occasion after —
i committing themselves.
Unfortunately those are a mi
' nority. The rest reach their de
cision on the flimsiest of reasons,
lacking the interest or perhaps
the common sense to probe any
deeper. One result of such action,
by no means limited to frosh dol-;
lies, is that no ASSU campaign j
ever evolves above the most su-;
perficial discussion of the most j
superficial issues.
A post-election story about an
other frosh girl is going around.
! She voted for Robbins because a
; football player told her that if
! Robbins won Stanford would go
I to the Rose Bowl next year. Foot
; ball coach John Ralston apparent
: ly wasn't aware that the fate of
! next year's football team hung

on the ASSU elections — or at
least he hasn't demanded a re
count yet.
One frosh dollie went through
this breathtaking process before
casting her ballot: She was pro
fraternity because she wanted to
live in a sorority. She liked soror
ities because she didn't like some
of the girls in her dorm and didn't
think that people should have to
live with people that they didn't
like. Robbins didn't think so
either. Therefore, one vote for
Robbins. Q.E.D.
Another frosh dollie voted for
Mackenzie because "he's the sec
ond greatest guy in the world."
And who's the greatest? Her boy
friend, of course. Sorry Cassius,
but you only think you're the
greatest. You're actually third
greatest, at best.
It's all very entertaining to see
the feminine mind at work in
such matters. It adds humor to an
otherwise dull campaign. Wash
ing dishes and keeping house, one
lias to admit, are well within
female capabilities but student
politics evidently is not. While the
women of this campus supply
campaign secretaries and ardent
workers, their intellectual contri
butions to the campaign are al
most nil, as is their ability to
deal in any but the most im
mature manner with the issues
raised by the candidates.
One solution to this problem of
uninformed women in politics
might be a return to the system
used here many years ago when
women took little part in the
ASSU elections but merely con
cerned themselves with the AWS
contest, a more fitting field for
the rather limited political skill of
Stanford women. At least then
their ignorance would only affect
themselves.
It is true that without the eager
labor of enthusiastic frosh much
of the horsepower that drives a
successful campaign would bo
lacking. Rut aside from secre
tarial work, those girls perform
no useful function in the cam
paign, except attempting to per
suade other equally ignorant girls
to vote for their candidate. They,
of course, have no ability to con
vince members of the other sex
of anything political.
So, aside from losing a few of
fice workers, the campaign ap
partatus would be unimpared.
And as a bonus the candidates
would have more time to devote
to that part of the electorate
which votes on the issues, not on
the intangibles that seem to cloud
the female intellect. The elimina
tion of the politically ignorant
and absurd from the campaign
may very well be worth the price
of a few typists.
In 1920, with tin* 19tli amendment women received the right to
vote in national elections. The error has never been rectified.
At Stanford women also have the right to vote in ASSU
elections, a right accepted with unrestrained glee in such places
as Roble and Brainier.

Of course their glee is nof
matched among campus politi
cians who know what motivates
our ballot box bound dollies. And
usually it is issues that are last
in any young girl's mind when she
thinks about candidates.
A few examples of the Future
Mothers of America minds in ac
tion might demonstrate what the
candidates are up against in try
ing to pierce the curtain of ignor
ance that surrounds the frosh
dollies' dorms.
The prime example is, of course,
the recent petition on off-campus
issues that swept Roble faster
than an epidemic of Asian flu.
No one, especially the girls pass
ing out the petition, had any real
idea of what was involved in the
petition, or what the facts were.
The Herd Instinct
Not that that bothered them.
Like last year's crop of lemmings
they all saw where the crowd
was heading, and rather than get
trampled they joined in. If im
morality could be put on a peti-j
tion and passed through Roble
Hall, there'd probably be enough
action to make the San Fran
cisco police forget North Beach.
It's not that the frosh are
stupid, for according to Time
they aren't, but rather that they
are sadly uninformed. So unin
formed that they didn't even
know where to begin to acquire
I the facts to make any intelligent
I decisions.
