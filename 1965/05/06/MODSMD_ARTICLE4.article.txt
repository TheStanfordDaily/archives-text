# Sigma Chi—'Too Small for Britches'
## 
### JOHN BUZAN 
Stanford's local chapter of Sigma Chi
received notification last month of a one
year's suspension from the national or
ganization.
A contested suspension of national im
portance has developed from what had
begun as a general complaint by na
tional Grand Consul Harry V. Wade
that the Alpha Omega chapter here had
been exhibiting "flagrant disregard for
the fraternity's ritual."
Charges for Suspension
Sigma Chi's national president based
suspension upon the following charges:
• The local chapter traditionally has
not conformed lo formal ritual in chap
ter meetings.
• Stanford University has exhibited
a strong dislike for national fraternities,
as evidenced by the renunciation of soror
ities in 1944.
• "The local chapter house is one of the
dirtiest in the country."
• The Alpha Omega chapter had no

formal Housing Corporation.
On the twentieth of March, several of
of the officers met with Wade in San
Francisco. According to AO's Frank
Olrich, he definitely "encouraged going
local," explaining four ways for the
chapter to do so.
No Mention of Negroes
Until then, no specific mention of Neg
roes in the fraternity had been made,
although Wade had noted previously
that Japanese and Chinese students
would be unacceptable to the national,
which reserves the right to turn down
initiates.
Sigma Chi several years ago dropped
the discrimination clause from its char
ter, but maintained its attitude through
a statute requiring all applicants to be
acceptable to all members of the na
tional. They required a picture to ac
company all applications.
Thus, according to the local chapter,
the real issue was racial discrimination.
Wade was against the local chapter, and

all other issues were and are, according
to member Pat Forster, "trumped-up
charges to hide the real issue."
The local chapter prepared for fire,
soliciting support of the rushing pro
cedure it planned to initiate this spring.
From the Berkeley and San Jose chap
ters they received mixed indications of
support.
Fresno State Opposed
Fresno State came out definitely
against Stanford's proposed action.
The chapter received clear indications
in communications from national officers
prior to the suspension that there was
no reason to suspend the charter other
than the chapter's announced views re
garding membership policies.
Sigma Chi pledged a Negro on April
3. On April 10, they received notice of
suspension.
In letters to other chapters Wade com
mented ". . . The young men ... at Stan
ford . . . are a little bit too small for the
size of their pants. They have long been

strong advocates ol' local autonomy.
They now have it!"
Remedies Not Ivvluiiistvd
The house has not exhausted remedies,
according to Olrich and Forster although
the national committee refused to re
view the case and to hear the story from
the AO point of view.
In June they will have recourse to the
national meeting of the fraternity, at
which time they expect either to be rein
stated or to take the case to court.
They mentioned the distinct possibility
that, pursuant to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act, any university with such a
discriminatory living group on campus
will not be eligible for federal aid.
More immediate recourse for the mem
hers of Alpha Omega has been to try to
drum up support for amendments pro
posed by other sympathetic chapters to
the Sigma Chi constitution, which pro
pose to abolish national discrimination
by giving chapters local autonomy in
their rush policies.

Sigma Chi several years ago dropped
the discrimination clause from its char
ter, but maintained its attitude through
a statute requiring all applicants to be
acceptable to all members of the na
tional. They required a picture to ac
company all applications.
Thus, according to the local chapter,
the real issue was racial discrimination.
Wade was against the local chapter, and

all other issues were and are, according
to member Pat Forster, "trumped-up
charges to hide the real issue."
The local chapter prepared for fire,
soliciting support of the rushing pro
cedure it planned to initiate this spring.
From the Berkeley and San Jose chap
ters they received mixed indications of
support.
Fresno State Opposed
Fresno State came out definitely
against Stanford's proposed action.
The chapter received clear indications
in communications from national officers
prior to the suspension that there was
no reason to suspend the charter other
than the chapter's announced views re
garding membership policies.
Sigma Chi pledged a Negro on April
3. On April 10, they received notice of
suspension.
In letters to other chapters Wade com
mented ". . . The young men ... at Stan
ford . . . are a little bit too small for the
size of their pants. They have long been

strong advocates ol' local autonomy.
They now have it!"
Remedies Not Ivvluiiistvd
The house has not exhausted remedies,
according to Olrich and Forster although
the national committee refused to re
view the case and to hear the story from
the AO point of view.
In June they will have recourse to the
national meeting of the fraternity, at
which time they expect either to be rein
stated or to take the case to court.
They mentioned the distinct possibility
that, pursuant to Title VI of the Civil
Rights Act, any university with such a
discriminatory living group on campus
will not be eligible for federal aid.
More immediate recourse for the mem
hers of Alpha Omega has been to try to
drum up support for amendments pro
posed by other sympathetic chapters to
the Sigma Chi constitution, which pro
pose to abolish national discrimination
by giving chapters local autonomy in
their rush policies.
Stanford's local chapter of Sigma Chi
received notification last month of a one
year's suspension from the national or
ganization.
A contested suspension of national im
portance has developed from what had
begun as a general complaint by na
tional Grand Consul Harry V. Wade
that the Alpha Omega chapter here had
been exhibiting "flagrant disregard for
the fraternity's ritual."
Charges for Suspension
Sigma Chi's national president based
suspension upon the following charges:
• The local chapter traditionally has
not conformed lo formal ritual in chap
ter meetings.
• Stanford University has exhibited
a strong dislike for national fraternities,
as evidenced by the renunciation of soror
ities in 1944.
• "The local chapter house is one of the
dirtiest in the country."
• The Alpha Omega chapter had no

formal Housing Corporation.
On the twentieth of March, several of
of the officers met with Wade in San
Francisco. According to AO's Frank
Olrich, he definitely "encouraged going
local," explaining four ways for the
chapter to do so.
No Mention of Negroes
Until then, no specific mention of Neg
roes in the fraternity had been made,
although Wade had noted previously
that Japanese and Chinese students
would be unacceptable to the national,
which reserves the right to turn down
initiates.
