## Current Session To Be 'Different' 
### CY KAUSMEYER 
"1 think this is going to be
recognized as the most different
kind ot Congress it has been rnv
experience to serve in," stated
Senator Lee Me tea If concerning
the 89th Congress.
The Senator gave his speech
yesterday afternoon in Tresidder's
large lounge. The talk was spon
sored by Stanford's Young Demo
crats.
Senator Metealf presented a
brief outline of what he thought
were the three most important
areas of change in Congress, and
then answered questions on for
eign and domestic policy.
Areas of Change
The first area of improvement
was a change in the Rules Com
mittee. Now it is no longer pos
sible for a few men to prevent
congressional debate on a bill.
Improvements of this type in
parliamentary procedure allowed
certain bills to pass Congress, and
this constitutes the second area
of change.
"We have for the first time in
the history of this country a gen
eralized aid to education. Always
before, any aid has been spec
ialized aid." Senator Metealf was
referring to the Federal Aid to
Education Bill.
He said that specialized aid
given before tended to distort the
educational process emphasizing
one aspect too much. The Senator
also cited the Voting Rights and
Medicare Bills as very important
accomplishments of Congress.
Domestic Improvements
Domestic improvement projects
constitute the third area of im
portant legislation. Instead of giv
ing aid to countries or states, the
Senator said, the Government aids
whole areas with a common prob
lem. A well known example of
this is the Appalachia Project.
Other areas to be aided in this
way are the Northern Plains,
Great Lakes, and Pacific North
west.
