# THE 						STANFORD RATIO
## 1.41 Cars Per Space 
### BOB EGELKO 
Dispersion of lots, greater on
j campus residency, purging of cars
j from campus core— herein lie solu
tions to Stanford's parking prob- j
' lem in the foreseeable future, ac-1
; cording to Planning Office spokes-!
I man Oscar Nelson.
The problem is a simple one: i
(how to fit 12,000 cars registered;
I to students, faculty and staff into j
j 8500 parking spaces, or however
| fewer there will be as new build
j ings wipe out old lots.
' The numbers game is not un
beatable, Nelson declared. Many
of ihe 12.000 are second cars,;
registered but rarely driven on
j campus.
For the rest of the overflow,
; there is no space provided, a con-j
I clit ion less drastic than it sounds;;
i Efscondicfa Villagers, unable to 1
drive to classes, have taken to
bicycles, a move the Planning Of
fice is encouraging with the con
st ruction of an 8-foot, lighted bi
cycle path along a new extension
of Sena Street.
Library Replaces Lot
Construction presents a knot
tier problem. The new undergrad-1
j uate library replaces a 400-space |
j lot, and the parking area be-;
i hind the main library will suffer j
the same fate within a few years, j
A new Minerals Science build ;
ing will herald the conversion of
Lomita Drive north of Serra into
a pedestrian mall (eliminating
street parking' by 1967, and park
-1 ing strips along the oval north of
Quad are likewise doomed.
N'ew lots, of course, arc being i
built. An area behind the Arguello :
Street tennis courts and another)
on i|jc extension «»( Panama Street 1

near the Women's Gym have been
converted, relieving the pressure!
somewhat.
Behind Stern llall
I Foremost among proposed lot i
sites is a three-block stretch be-!
I hind Stern Hall now occupied by j
I white-frame academic buildings i
i which are to be centralized. The j
■ lot would hold 700 cars.
But the new lots are increasing-1
ly farther from the university's
academic heart, making the Plan- 1
ning Office a target of widespread j
criticism with each new construe-'
tion.
• Most of the critics, said Nel-.
| son, are faculty and staff mem- j
! hers. "We have little trouble with |
! students." he revealed, "but many j
j men who have been here a long
j time -some of the higherups are j
j used to parking right under their i
i offices, and are so set in their!
ways that they resent any
: change. .
"Also, a number of secretaries ■
; don't want to walk a few extra I
j blocks."
Less ( entraj Lots
Despite complaints, lots will get ,
no nearer to Quad, Nelson stated. I
j Each lot removed by a building i
! will be replaced by a less central |
; area "so that we can continue to 1
! provide free parking on campus j
1 for all who need it."
Long-range plans are in bar- j
J mony with the University's goal,
! of controlled expansion. The rise l
in enrollment to an expected 11,-
000 by 1985 is to be accompanied j
by an increase in campus resi
deney, from the presenl 50 peri
I cent to (>5 per cent, made possible!
I by an acceleration in dormitory
I construction.
Proposed structures include uti

i dergraduate men's dorms between
| the present fraternity clusters, a
, dormitory complex west of Flo
I Mo (likely to be coed), a series
| of new living units west of Bran
j nor, and possibly an expansion of
j the high-rise apartment system
' recently inaugurated in Escondido
I Village.
The effect of this campus liv
ing boom would be to cut down
the number of cars needed by off
! campus residents, while aceom
; modating the new influx in dorm
j itory lots.
Bikes Encouraged
Meanwhile, 8-foot-wide, lighted
' bicycle paths and motorcycle
parking facilities would encour
age the new residences to go the
way of Escondido Village. A path
j around Lagunita would avoid (he
steep grades of the south end of
campus and hopefully cut into
' the present fraternity man-car
ratio of virtually 1-1.
The Planning Officc eventually
hopes to free the central aca
demic area (not including the
; Medical School and other outlying
! structures) of automobile traffic.
' limiting cars to outside and periphery
| riphery travel.
However, declared Nelson, there
| is no move afoot to have Stanford
1 follow other major universities
and restrict or eliminate car
i ownership.
Barring unlimited population
, expansion, it is also doubtful that
. such measures as a 2000-space lot
under the Oval (cost: $10 million)
I and a yearly parking fee will have
j to be resorted to. But the plan
ners have a provisional map onl
lining three underground sites in
brown- just in case.
