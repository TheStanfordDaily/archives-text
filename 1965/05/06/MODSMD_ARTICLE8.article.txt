# LASSU To Debate Off-Campus Issue; Four Plans Offered
## 
### 
According to LASSU Speaker Ed Shaw, the most important
issue facing the Legislature tonight is the off-campus issues con
troversy. The meeting will be at 7:30 p.m. in room 320.
The off-campus issues controversy began with the approval of
the new constitution and subsequent ruling to the Hoard of Trus-

tees that the Legislature couldn't"
take a position on "off-campus"
affairs. The Legislature decided
it wanted the student body to
make this decision instead of the
Board of Trustees and asked to
have the ban removed.
A group of students started a
petition to force a general refer
endum before the student body
which would limit the Legisla
ture to student affairs on campus.
The Legislature voted to work
out alternatives to the petition
and offer them to the student
body before May 21. Four possi
bilities will be considered tonight.
The original petition stated
that the student government may
not take any position on "off
campus" affairs.
• A petition stating that no one
can categorize t he issues on
which the Legislature may take
a position.
• A proposal that the Legisla
ture may take a position only if
a week passes between its intro
duction and voting on it, and
then it must pas by a 2/3 roll call
vote.
• A proposal that student gov
ernment can't take a stand, but
can submit the issue to plebicites.
These possibilities should have
been voted on last week, but a
quorum wasn't present. The orig
inal petition must come before the

► -
| student body for a vote. According
to Shaw, the alternative proposal
j which will also come before the
j student body will probably be a
combination of the last two pos
sibilities.
The Legislature must also ap
! prove the results of the recent
I presidential election which is not
i legal until it is approved.
The elections reform committee
| will begin work on changing the
i present outdated electioneering
| rules to something more func
tional.
