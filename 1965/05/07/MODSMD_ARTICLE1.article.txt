• Dominican Summary
WASHINGTON The Organization of
American States committed itself early yester
day to a military role in the Dominican Re
public but the how and when of this historic
step remained obscure.
Opposition within the OAS was led by Mex
ico, Uruguay, Chile, Peru and Ecuador. Brazil,
Costa Rica. Haiti and Colombia were ihe most
active supporters of the resolution originally
offered by the United States.
A motion by Venezuela to have the Latin
American forces replace all the U.S. troops,
now numbering over 19,000, was defeated. It is
expected that as units from other countries
arrive some U.S. detachments will be moved
out.
The Soviet Union charged yesterday that
the Organization of American States had chal
lenged the authority of the U.N. Security
Council by approving an inter-American peace

force for use in the Dominican Republic.
In a speech to the U.N. Security Council,
Nikolai T. Fedorenko, the Soviet chief dele
gate, also accused President Johnson of trying
to take over the council's peace keeping au
thority.
Because several delegates wanted more time
to study the OAS decision, the council decided
to put off until today any vote on a Soviet res
olution calling for condemnation of the United
States for sending armed forces to the Domini
can Republic and demanding their immediate
withdrawal.
The Soviet resolution has no chance of
council approval. Its defeat would leave the
Dominican issue in the hands of the OAS,
which is what the United States wants.
President Charles de Gaulle yesterday
moved his vaunted "independent diplomacy"
to a new front by condemning American in
tervention in the Dominican Republic.
"France disapproves the American inter
vention and wants the withdrawal of troops
who have landed in Santo Domingo," a spokes

man said in recounting De Gaulle's attitude.
About a fourth of these French nationals chose
to take advantage of the evacuation organized
by the United States, he said.
In condemning American action in Santo
Domingo, De Gaulle evidently was trying to
emphasize his independent role in world af
fairs a role often described as anti-Ameri
can.
• J ietnam War Hill Passes
WASHINGTON' Propejled by the top lead
ers in both parties, President Johnson's $700-
million Viet Nam war fund bill crashed
through the Senate yesterday amid cries of
blackjack tactics.

The Senate passed the bill by a roll-call
vote of 88-3 after a fixed five-hour period of
furious debate.
Senate approval of the measure came 21
hours after the House whipped it through by
a vote of 408-7, and a little over 48 hours after
Johnson asked for its passage "at the earliest
possible moment."
STATE AND LOCAL
• Drunk Driver Hill Fails
SACRAMENTO- Legislation aimed at mak
ing persons accused of drunk driving take
chemical blood tests was killed yesterday
by the Senate Finance Committee.
The bill would have assumed the "implied
consent" of persons arrested on drunk driv
ing charges to submit to such tests.
Legislation allowing the California Highway
Patrol to use a limited number of specially
marked cars for traffic enforcement was re
jected by an Assembly committee yesterday.

The Ways and Means committee refused to
send to the lower house floor a bill that would
have permitted the CHP to paint five per cent
of its cars in colors other than the standard
black and white.

"The act involved lewd motions of the

WASHINGTON The Organization of
American States committed itself early yester
day to a military role in the Dominican Re
public but the how and when of this historic
step remained obscure.
Opposition within the OAS was led by Mex

Costa Rica. Haiti and Colombia were ihe most
active supporters of the resolution originally
offered by the United States.
A motion by Venezuela to have the Latin
American forces replace all the U.S. troops,
now numbering over 19,000, was defeated. It is
expected that as units from other countries
arrive some U.S. detachments will be moved
out.
The Soviet Union charged yesterday that
the Organization of American States had chal
lenged the authority of the U.N. Security
Council by approving an inter-American peace

force for use in the Dominican Republic.
In a speech to the U.N. Security Council,
Nikolai T. Fedorenko, the Soviet chief dele
