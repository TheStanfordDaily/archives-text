# Godard, Bardot, Palance Film Worthy of 'Contempt'
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
"Contempt" is a movie about
people who are making a movie,
and both of them are just awful.
Plot-wise, love is currently a
many-sided triangle on the rocks
of Capri, where Brigitte Bardot
and her husband are engaged in
the pleasant pastime of mutual
reproach: he thinks she has been
unfaithful; she knows he has. In
between spats they do a power
ful lot of undressing; however,
instead of getting down to busi
ness, they just change clothes
and go right on fighting.
Meanwhile, hubby is working
for lecherous Jack Palance, an
American producer engaged in
fliming liis version of Homer's
"Odyssey." Palance has decided
that Ulysses ran off to the Tro
jan War because of matrimonial
troubles. Otherwise, why did he
take ten years to get back?
Into Bed
Further, upon his return he
didn't drive off Penelope's suitors

because he trusted her to be
faithful. However, when he had
second thoughts, she, insulted,
justified his second thoughts by
popping into bed with a few of
said suitors. And so, obviously,
Ulysses had to kill them off.
Just as obviously, the viewer is
supposed to pop the contemporary
pegs (Palance, Bardot) into the
ancient holes (suitor, Penelope)
and find symbolic meanings a 11
over the place. It matters little
that the pegs don't fit; for in a
movie whose philosophy is that
life goes on, and on, and on, sym
bol-hunting staves off boredom as
well as anything.
Besides, most of the time Capri
and the Mediterranean provide an
awesomely beautiful backdrop for
"Contempt." Apparently more im
portant, though, at least for the
director, statuesque Athena (with
terra cotta red eyes) and Poseidon
(with robin's egg blue eyes) gaze
stonily but approvingly upon the
fate of ancients and moderns
alike.
Multi-Lingual
"Contempt" features four lan
guages, subtitles, and an inter
preter, and whatever isn't lost in
the translation suffers irrepar
ably at the hands of all concerned.
Jack Palance gives unquestion
ably the worst performance in
movie history. He looks (and
acts) like a fifth-rate imitation of
Marcello Mastroianni.
Bardot is self-explanatory. How
ever, she would be much better
if she opened her dress more and
her mouth less. The other roles
are fairly well acted, but the di
rection, by Jean-luc Godard, is in
credibly inept.
His characters stroll on and off
the screen, talking away, while
the camera doggedly focuses on
a vast, empty sea. Moreover,
when a character's expression
matters, the camera is too far
away to catch it; but when his
glance would be at best crudely
suggestive, trust the camera to
be staring down his throat.
The pace is worse than fu
nereal; it crawls on interminably,
as if trying to prove that practi
cally nothing can be stretched
out into a very long picture in
deed.
It can, but it's still practically
nothing.
