## JAZZ TRACK The 						Story of Thelonious Monk 
### RICK BALE 
To the millions of Americans
who saw him on a '&4 cover of
Time magazine, and even more to
those who went on to read the
now infamous article, Thelonious
Sphere Monk is the prototype of
the weird, secluded, mysterious,
and unpredictable jazzman.
Many artists have certainly
gone through hard years of public
misunderstanding and rejection,
but it seems strange that Monk,
who is now universally accepted
as one of a handful of jazz mas
ters, should have been neglected
so long by critics, jazz fans, and
fellow musicians. Though more
than half the life of this 45 year
old musician has been spent in
the highest circles of modern jazz,
it is only since the late '50's that
Monk began to acquire any semb
lance of popularity.
Monk was part of a clique of
visionary jazzmen including Dizzy
Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud
Powell, and Kenny Clarke, who
in the years before World War II
worked together informally on the
harmonic and rhythmic innova
tions that were to lead to the
establishment of bop as a new jazz
style.
Harlem Years
Those years in Harlem, at Min
ton's, the Uptown and other clubs
were the beginnings of what the
layman would describe as "mod
ern jazz"—and with its subtler
implied rhythms and unconven
tional progressions, quite distinct
from the sounds of the Swing Era
in which it was born.
Aside from stints with Lucky
Millinder's band in '42 and Hamp
ton Hawes in *44, Monk worked
alone or with a small combo until
February '59, when he appeared
leading a large orchestra in a con
cert at Town Hall in New York
City.
His gradual rise in popularity
actually began in '57 when he
worked a stint at the Five Spot
Cafe in New York with John
Coltrane as a sideman. An ap
pearance on CBS-TV's "The Sound
of Jazz" followed, and Monk has
worked steadily since, principally
at the Five Spot.
Monk at Workshop
Monk's current stint at the Jazz
Workshop in San Francisco I en
thusiastically recommend to

everyone, regradless of your jazz
ear or interest. It has been my ex
perience that Monk, similar to Ro
land Kirk and Sonny Rollins, is
one of those rare jazzmen whose
sound is able to reach the initiated
and those who "never seemed to
iike jazz before."
This quality in his music has
moved many critics to describe
his work as "primitive" or "sim
plistic," but I have yet to see a
description of his sound that
would solve for me the perplexity

of this mystical communication.
It is at this point that the writing
must stop and tho listening must
start.
Elsewhere, Vince Guar aid! and
8010 Sete, fresh from their very
successful eastern swing are back
in town at El Matador. The Mas
tt'rsounds have regrouped after an
absence of five years and are fea
tured at Basin Street West. Singer
Toni Lee Sc*>tt has replaced the
ailing Bill Evans at the Trident in
Sausalito.

than half the life of this 45 year
old musician has been spent in
the highest circles of modern jazz,
it is only since the late '50's that
Monk began to acquire any semb
lance of popularity.
Monk was part of a clique of
visionary jazzmen including Dizzy
Gillespie, Charlie Parker, Bud
Powell, and Kenny Clarke, who
in the years before World War II
worked together informally on the
harmonic and rhythmic innova
tions that were to lead to the
establishment of bop as a new jazz
style.
Harlem Years
Those years in Harlem, at Min
ton's, the Uptown and other clubs
were the beginnings of what the
layman would describe as "mod
ern jazz"—and with its subtler
implied rhythms and unconven
tional progressions, quite distinct
from the sounds of the Swing Era
in which it was born.
Aside from stints with Lucky
Millinder's band in '42 and Hamp
ton Hawes in *44, Monk worked
alone or with a small combo until
February '59, when he appeared
leading a large orchestra in a con
cert at Town Hall in New York
City.
His gradual rise in popularity
actually began in '57 when he
worked a stint at the Five Spot
Cafe in New York with John
Coltrane as a sideman. An ap
pearance on CBS-TV's "The Sound
of Jazz" followed, and Monk has
worked steadily since, principally
at the Five Spot.
Monk at Workshop
Monk's current stint at the Jazz
Workshop in San Francisco I en
thusiastically recommend to

everyone, regradless of your jazz
ear or interest. It has been my ex
perience that Monk, similar to Ro
land Kirk and Sonny Rollins, is
one of those rare jazzmen whose
sound is able to reach the initiated
and those who "never seemed to
iike jazz before."
This quality in his music has
moved many critics to describe
his work as "primitive" or "sim
plistic," but I have yet to see a
description of his sound that
would solve for me the perplexity

of this mystical communication.
It is at this point that the writing
must stop and tho listening must
start.
Elsewhere, Vince Guar aid! and
8010 Sete, fresh from their very
successful eastern swing are back
in town at El Matador. The Mas
tt'rsounds have regrouped after an
absence of five years and are fea
tured at Basin Street West. Singer
Toni Lee Sc*>tt has replaced the
ailing Bill Evans at the Trident in
Sausalito.
To the millions of Americans
who saw him on a '&4 cover of
Time magazine, and even more to
those who went on to read the
now infamous article, Thelonious
Sphere Monk is the prototype of
the weird, secluded, mysterious,
and unpredictable jazzman.
Many artists have certainly
gone through hard years of public
misunderstanding and rejection,
but it seems strange that Monk,
who is now universally accepted
as one of a handful of jazz mas
ters, should have been neglected
so long by critics, jazz fans, and
fellow musicians. Though more
