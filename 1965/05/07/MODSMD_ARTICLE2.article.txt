# UC Moderates Win In Senate Election
## 
### 
The three top candidates of SLATE, the University of Califor
nia's liberal political organization, were defeated in student body
elections held in Berkeley earlier this week.
Jerry Goldstein, regarded as a campus moderate, defeated
Sandor Fuehs, the SLATE candidate, 3970 to 2078 votes, for ASt'C
president. SLATE candidate for first vice president, Marston
Schult/, was beaten by Tim Lyons, 3686 to 2100, and SLATE sec
ond vice presidential candidate Shirley Arimoto was defeated by
Nancy Tyson, 3578 to 2381. â™¦

In a statement following his
election, Goldstein staled that his
Victory was one "for the mod
erate. a believer in the conference
table rather than ilie sit-in, in
morality rather than obscenity."
Goldstein 'Libera!'
Goldstein's victory cannot be
considered one for conservatism,
though, for he is participating in
establishing the Free Student
Union, an organization aimed at
replacing the dying FSM.
Although the President-elect
had not participated in the Free
Speech Movement's demonstra
tions last year, he promised that
he was liberal enough not to be
a "tool of the administration."
Despite SLATE's failure to win
the three top offices, the organiza
tion still scored a few victories.
One representative-at large, the
Women's Co-op representative,
and tiie commuter-independent
representative were elected from
among SLATE candidates.
There will be a runoff election
for two representative-at-large
candidates today. Control of the
Associated Student Senate will de
pend largely on the outcome of
these two races between two can
didates of the liberal organiza
tion, Val Mitchel and Joe Hacker,
and two non-SLATE candidates,
Bob Archibald and John Roberts.
This weeks' election results left
SLATE with nine members on the
Student Senate, the same as be
fore. If (he SLATE candidates
both win in the runoff election,
the organization will have a slim
majority of 11 out of 21 Senate
seats.
