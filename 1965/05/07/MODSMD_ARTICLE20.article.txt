THEATER
ONCE UPON A MATTRESS, Ram's Head's excellent production of
the musical updating of "The Princess and the Pea," ends its run
with performances tonight and tomorrow night in Memorial Audi
torium.
LIGHTS AND SHADOWS is being presented free of charge Mon
day nights at Comedia in Palo Alto (see review on page 5), where
Shaw's MAJOR BARBARA plays Fridays and the British musical
STOP THE WORLD—I WANT TO GET OFF plays Saturdays.
EN LA RED is a drama by Alfonso Sastre that will be presented
in Spanish twice tomorrow at the Women's Clubhouse—once at 3 and
again at 8.
THE SIGN IN SIDNEY BRUSTEIN'S WINDOW is Lorraine ("A
Raisin in the Sun") Hansborry's comedy-drama about a group of
Greenwich Villagers that recently appeared on Broadway. Opening
Monday night at the Geary in San Francisco, it has much of its
New York cast intact.
PICKWICK is the British musical at the Curran in San Francisco
as the first show of this year's Civic Light Opera series.
FILMS
THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI, a classic horror film, and
THE WHITE SHEIK are the bill for today's Tresidder movies.
LE MILLION, an early talkie directed by Rene Clair, and tho
Parisian documentary CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER are paired on
tomorrow's Tresidder program.
SOME LIKE IT HOT, one of Billy Wilder's best—and funniest
—comedies stars Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as a pair of mu
sicians who witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre and hide by
dressing up and joining an all-girl band. Marilyn Monroe gives
perhaps her best performance as the band's singer in Sunday's flick.
FANNY HILL is at the Fine Arts (see review on page 5).
CONTEMPT is at the Paris (see review on this page), where it is
paired with BOCCACCIO 70, a three-part movie with Anita Ekberg
directed by Fellini, Romy Schneider directed by Visconti and Sophia
Loren directed by De Siea.
BECKET is the lavishly produced movie based on the friendship
and later falling-out of England's King Henry and his Archbishop
of Canterbury Thomas Becket. Richard Burton, as Becket, and Peter
O'Toole, as Henry, are superb. Also on the bill at the Park is the
morbidly funny DR. STRANGELOVE, with a virtuoso performance
by Peter Sellers in three different roles.
The Varsity, presumably trying to keep the audience it gained
with "Mary Poppins," is showing a Hayley Mills movie THE TRUTH
ABOUT SPRING. Also starring John Mills—Hayley's father—and
James Mac Arthur, its cofeature is THE NIGHT WALKER with
Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck.
WORLD WITHOUT SUN is Jacques-Yves Cousteau's exquisitely
photographed Oscar winning documentary of six men who live for
a month entirely underwater. Although the narration is occasionally
a bit pretentious, the aquatic scenery is unbelievably beautiful and
awesome. Rounding out the bill at the Bijou are Peter Sellers,
David Niven, Capucine, Claudia Cardinale and a huge jewel called
THE PINK PANTHER.
ZORBA THE GREEK stars Anthony Quinn in the title role of this
film about a man who lives life to the fullest. Alan Bates, as tho
young man Zorba makes wise in the ways of the world, Irene Papas
and Oscar winner Lila Kedrova head the supporting cast. Written
and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, it is at the Guild.
JOHN GOLDFARB, PLEASE COME HOME is the Shirley Mac-
Laine-Peter Ustinov-Richard Crenna comedy about U-2 pilots, harems
and football teams that was sued by Notre Dame for supposedly ridi
culing that august institution. Also at the Stanford is BUS RILEY'S
BACK IN TOWN, with Michael Parks in the title role of a young man
just released from the service and Ann-Margaret as an old flame who
can still kindle quite a fire.
OTHER
THE TANGENT in Palo Alto is still featuring ex-Limeliter Lou
Gottlieb and permanent wandering minstrel Buddy Bohn.
THE I CLUB BALL tonight at the Cabana will have Johnny
Vaughn's orchestra providing music for dancing.
Guitarist BUNYAN WEBB, a former Stanford student, will give
a concert at Palo Alto's Manhattan Playhouse Sunday night.
COUNT BASII'] and TONY BENNETT close out their engagement
at the Circle Star Sunday night. PEGGY LEE and BENNY' GOOD
MAN will open at this arena theater in San Carlos on Tuesday.
RUDOLF SERKIN will give a concert Monday night in Memorial
Auditorium. Although tickets are sold out, there may be some last
minute cancellations available at the door.

Parisian documentary CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER are paired on
tomorrow's Tresidder program.
SOME LIKE IT HOT, one of Billy Wilder's best—and funniest
—comedies stars Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis as a pair of mu
sicians who witness the St. Valentine's Day massacre and hide by
dressing up and joining an all-girl band. Marilyn Monroe gives
perhaps her best performance as the band's singer in Sunday's flick.
FANNY HILL is at the Fine Arts (see review on page 5).
CONTEMPT is at the Paris (see review on this page), where it is
paired with BOCCACCIO 70, a three-part movie with Anita Ekberg
directed by Fellini, Romy Schneider directed by Visconti and Sophia
Loren directed by De Siea.
BECKET is the lavishly produced movie based on the friendship
and later falling-out of England's King Henry and his Archbishop
of Canterbury Thomas Becket. Richard Burton, as Becket, and Peter
O'Toole, as Henry, are superb. Also on the bill at the Park is the
morbidly funny DR. STRANGELOVE, with a virtuoso performance
by Peter Sellers in three different roles.
The Varsity, presumably trying to keep the audience it gained
with "Mary Poppins," is showing a Hayley Mills movie THE TRUTH
ABOUT SPRING. Also starring John Mills—Hayley's father—and
James Mac Arthur, its cofeature is THE NIGHT WALKER with
Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck.
WORLD WITHOUT SUN is Jacques-Yves Cousteau's exquisitely
photographed Oscar winning documentary of six men who live for
a month entirely underwater. Although the narration is occasionally
a bit pretentious, the aquatic scenery is unbelievably beautiful and
awesome. Rounding out the bill at the Bijou are Peter Sellers,
David Niven, Capucine, Claudia Cardinale and a huge jewel called
THE PINK PANTHER.
ZORBA THE GREEK stars Anthony Quinn in the title role of this
film about a man who lives life to the fullest. Alan Bates, as tho
young man Zorba makes wise in the ways of the world, Irene Papas
and Oscar winner Lila Kedrova head the supporting cast. Written
and directed by Michael Cacoyannis, it is at the Guild.
JOHN GOLDFARB, PLEASE COME HOME is the Shirley Mac-
Laine-Peter Ustinov-Richard Crenna comedy about U-2 pilots, harems
and football teams that was sued by Notre Dame for supposedly ridi
culing that august institution. Also at the Stanford is BUS RILEY'S
BACK IN TOWN, with Michael Parks in the title role of a young man
just released from the service and Ann-Margaret as an old flame who
can still kindle quite a fire.
