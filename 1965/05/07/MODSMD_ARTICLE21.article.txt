# ‘Lights and Shadows’ a Failure
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
Reviewers try to he kind to
young and si rugg 1 in g play
wrights, feeling that with time
and encouragement they may
turn into diamatists of some sta
ture. Thus when Frank Gilroy's
'Who'll Save the Plovvhoy?" open
ed off-Broadway a few years back,
reviewers were lenient in their
criticism; Gilroy's second play, the
surprisingly successful "The Sub
ject Was Hoses," was far better
than "Plowboy," and was just
awarded the Pulitzer Prize.
But a reviewer must also be

, honest with his readers, and as
, much as 1 admire what Bill Ilitel
senkamp tries in do with his play
"Lights and Shadows," he fails so
i completely that 1 can not honest
ly recommend it.
"Lights and Shadows" is a one |
] act play about two soldiers in a
hospital room: Josh, a Negro from
Berkeley, has had several toes
i amputated; Ben, a Caucasian
from the South, was rescued
blinded and half fro/en by Josh,
but has never seen him.
The action occurs during the
day in which Josh is to be re
leased and Ben is to have his band
ages removed. The play builds to
the moment when Ben will realize,
for the first time in the six months j
j they have been together, that i
j Josh is a Negro.

i This is, obviously, an intensely |
j dramatic situation. IVfortunately,
Huelsenkamp avoids it by ending
the play when Ben leaves to have
the bandages remov ed th us
.cheating the audience of the cli
i matic scene which it lias been led
to expect.
This would be enough, 1 sup
pose, if the play were filled with
real characters about whom one
could care. But here again Huel
senkamp fails his audience by peo
i pling his play with four stereo
types who deliver slock speeches
in an almost lifeless fashion.
They are the same at the end j
of the play as lliev are at the be
j ginning there is virtually noth
ing said in the last 33 minutes
that isn't said in the first ten,
and there is nothing said in those I

first ten minutes that is worth
while.
Given dialogue like "You do
what you think is best, son; thiit's
all a man can ever do in this life,"
the actors struggle manfully. In
spite ill some uncertainty about
his lines (a problem afflicting all
four cast members) and a slipshod
southern accent, George Hodges
manages to invest Hen with a cer
tain warmth and humanity far
above and beyond the call of duty.
Jon Austin's Josh is monoton
ously unemotional; Cecil Taylor
as his father, and Dick Anton, as
a < orpsman with the subtlety of a
sledgehammer, are adequate.
Iluelsenkamp's direction is gen
erally aimless, but the set
which he and Carl Rccktenwald
designed is nice.
