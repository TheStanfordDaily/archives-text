# 'Fanny Hill’ a Two Faced, Cheap and Innocuous Bore
## 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
The film version of "Fanny j
I Hill" has to cater to two types |
: of audiences and fails to satisfy ;
| either.
Producer Albert Zugsmith. who i
is notorious foi making quickie i
exploitation films, was obviously j
alert lo the sensational aspects
of the story of an innocent young j
: gi.T aclrift in a house of prostitu- i
tion. To insure that his film re-1
tained a good measure of the!
novel's shock values, he hired as
; director Russ Meyer, who has
had considerable experience with
; nudie films; "Fanny Hill," in fact, |
lis his first effort outside the
! skin trade.
To appease the thrill-seeking
| patron with whom he is so fa-J
miliar. Meyer has decked out ;
the film with a number of amply
. endowed females, self-conscious-;
! ly racy dialogue, and some po
tentially torrid incidents in which
Fannv's virtue is in the balance.
;
A Isid For Culture
But Zugsmith and Meyer
wanted their film to make a bid
for culture i indeed, Zugsmith!
j refuses to allow "Fanny Hill" to
; be shown in any theatre w hi c h
normally presents nudie-cuties), j
and therefore they had to exer- !
j cise some restraint. What they
| were trying for was some of tht
qualities w hi c h characterized '
"Tom Jones": robust warmth
and good-hearted rowdiness, an
: insight into character, and a fccl
\ .ng for period and place.
j But in such unscrupulous hands, :
i rhe double aim of making a cheap
sexy film and a distinctive earthy j
one an i totally incompatible. The
i result of I heir compromise is an
innocuous bore with furtive pre
cisions to charm and spotty con- j
essions to the peeping toms.
As sexploitation, the film falls!
j flat because nothing really hap !
1 pens. Ridiculously. Fanny k e e ps j
I her virtue throughout, the girls!
(at least in Ihe American ver-j
| sion) dress quite modestly, t he,
unsubtle vulgarity of the dialogue
is ludicrous rather than titiUat-j
ing, and there is no suggestion
that there is anything more to j
j sex than a leering glance or a I
casual kiss. The only shock ele-1
men! is the tasteless exploitation
•>f physical deformities (dwarves,;
i woman with a moustache, an j
enormously fat woman who sells
; fish).
No "Tom Jones"
The film is even less rewarding
as a female "Tom Jones" because j
there is no understanding of the
people involved. To Zugsmith and j
Meyer, the characters are merely !
ibsesserl with sex. Shallow and;
altogether lacking in warmth, the
people do noi even have enough
substance to be stereotypes.
The film's structure is a series i
if unimaginative variations on ;
ihe single refrain of Fanny's in- ;
tocence in a corrupt world. The i
ironic contrast between what :
Fanny thinks she sees and the
reality which we see is the only I
source of humor and it soon be- j
comes tiresome.
The inexpensive budget is blat
antly apparent in the paper-thin

sots (which visibly rattle once or
twice), the flat, badly dubbed
sound, the wobbly camera work,
and the virtual tbsence of out
door scenes. To conserve money,
the film is actually little more
than a series of long-winded tete
a-tetes.
Inexplicable Casting
Miriam Hopkins, who was quite
a distinguished actress many
years ago, has inexplicably been
resurrected to play the Madame,
and she acquits her chores with
understandable embarrassment.
Letitia Roman, ino 1 very inno
cent-looking young women, is
Fanny. The careless synchroniza

tion makes it appear that some
one else is speaking her lines,
which is probably the case. At
any rate, the actress who speaks
Miss Roman's lines lends the only
no:e of charm to the film; she
has a high-pitched, little girl
voice which sounds very m u c h
like what the good-hearted, hope
lessly naive Fanny ought to be.
As for the models who have
been recruited to portray the
prostitutes, their ineptitude eludes
definition.
The music, a disturbing mix
ture of harpsichord and raucous
jay/., supplies an insight into the
film's dual conception.
