# CIBA LEAD AT STAKE
## Indian Nine in Crucial Series 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's hopes for a berth in
the NCAA baseball tournament
face a crucial test this weekend.
The Indians meel USC today and
Santa Barbara tomorrow.
Both games are set for Sunken
Diamond. Today's contest will
start at 3 p.m. Saturday's double
header against Santa Barbara will
start at noon.
The Indians are currently carry
ing a 25-8 record. Stanford is
ranked number one in the nation.
Six of their losses have come in
league play. The CIBA race is
close and tense as only 2V-± games
separate first place Stanford
from last place UCLA. USC is in
the number two spot in both the
league and thr national standings.
Precarious Lead
As of now Stanford holds a very
precarious one game lead over
I lie Tro jans and a one and a half
game lead over the Gauehos. Sig
nificantly, Stanford's lead is in
the win column. They have 9
wins to the Trojans 7 wins and
the Bauchos 6 wins. All Ihree
teams have 6 losses.
If ihe Indians can take a 1 1
three games and if USC loses one
of its games with Cal Saturday,

then the Indians will have
linched at least a tie for the
lampionship.
It is quite probable that USC
•ill lose one of the games to Cal
nee Boar ace Andy Messcrsmith,
ho shutout Stanford 8-0 last
eok, will pitch one of the games.
After this weekend the Indians
ve only two league games re
naming both with Santa Clara,
hould Stanford win their three
•lines today and tomorrow and
plit with Santa Clara, the In
lians will have won their first
TBA championship since 1953
vhen they shared it with the Tro
jans.
14 Championships in 15 Years
Coach Rod Dedeaux is seeking
'lis fourteenth CIBA title in his
last 15 years as head coach for
• he Trojans. Oddly enough, the
earn that beat the Trojans was
Stanford. The Indians won th e
CIBA crown outright in 1950.
USC will send its top pitcher,
righthander Tom Seaver, to t he
mound today. Seaver's record is
J 1. In his last outing Seaver put
UCLA down, 0-1, with a five-hit
ler. Earlier in the year he threw
a 10-3 win over Stanford.
Opposing him will be Stanford
sophomore Daro Quiring. Quiring
has an 8-2 record. Against Cal
last Friday he was superb as he
shutout the Bears 2-0.
Same Lineup
Coach Dutch Fehring plans to
j stay with the line-up which de
feated Cal twice last weekend.
Hard-hitting Jim Hibbs is recov
ered from the finger injury which
slowed him down in previous
weeks.
The starters are: Ron Yett

(.302>, l ight field; Bob Cox (.315),
:enter field; Hibbs (.265). catch*
er; Pete Middlekauff (.391), first
3ase; Dick Swan (.333), short
stop; Steve Hovley (.267), left
field; George Thaeher (.233), sec
~>nd base; Tom Me'zer (.172)
third base; Quiring (.129), pitcher.
Leading the '1 rojans will be
outfielder Mike Garrett (.333),
third baseman Daryl Wilkins
(.333), and second baseman Jus
tin Dedeaux (.303).
A few weeks ago USC had
eight men hitting over .300, but
ifter a cool series with the Bruins
only ihe aforementioned three are
j hitting consistently.
Stanford hitters, on the other
hand, are on the upswing. Having
scored zero and two runs last
Wednesday and Friday against
Cal, they opened up and pounced
upon Bear hurlers for 14 runs
| Saturday,
Indians S»'rk To Turn Tables
Tomorrow the Indians are hop
ing to avenge the loss of mid
season doubleheader to Santa
Barbara. The Gauehos downed
Stanford 1-2 and 2-0 three weeks
ago.

John Mason and Terry Dockon
will pitch against (lie GauehoF
Mason has a 0-2 record and a 2 5?
earned run average. Docken who
has been quite effective lately
has a 2-0 record and a low 1.88
e.r.a.
Ray Ford, Dave Rankin, and
Mike Foster will probably be the
trio which will throw in the Gau
chos three weekend games. Coach
Dave Gorrie has not definitely
said who will pitch. However, all
three have an e.r.a. of under 2.97
so the difference isn't that great
from one to the other.
Tony Goehring, who got nine
hits in 15 at bats last week, is
the top Santa Barbara hitter with
a .313 average He also has eight
homeruns to his credit to lead
the Gauchos in a second depart
ment.
