# Spikers In Relay Meet
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford takes a 27-man track ,
contingent to Fresno this week
end in an effort to end two years '
of frustration at the Fresno Re
lays.
Two years ago Stanford lost
the Relays to USC, 56-53. Last
year the Indians were second to
San Jose State by a thin 34-33. '
This year's team is as power- j
l'ul as any Stanford has had, but
the competition promises to be
intense. Five other PAC teams,
plus Arizona Stale, Arizona, and i
this year's probable NCAA c-ham-1
pion. New Mexico, will be entered
in the meet.
The Tribe will be strongest in
the sprints. Larry Questad, Dale
Rubin, and Eric Frische are en- j
tcred in the 100-yard dash, and!
will also run the 140 and 8&0 re- ;
lays, aided by Bob Mclntyre and
Ken Fraser.
Distance Medley Strong;
Stanford's strongest relay event
over th > past years has been the
medley relay. Froser, Dave Deub
ner, Harlan Andrews, and Paul
Schlicke will try to uphold the
winning tradition. USC will be
heavily favored in the two-mile ,
relay, having four 880 men under
1:51.
Bob Stoccker and Jim Eshel
man could score heavily in the
field events. Sloecker. who has a
best discus throw of IXI-8 this
season, will be in tough competi
tion against five men who have I
thrown better than 180 feet. .
Eshelman continued his steady
improvement in the pole vault ;
last Saturday, going 15-7U, and
could be ready for 16 feet.
