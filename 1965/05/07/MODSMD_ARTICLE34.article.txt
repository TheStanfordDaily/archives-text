## US-Latin American Policy; 'An Accumulation of Errorsâ€™ 
### MARIO RIETTI Graduate Student Economics Department 
The historical analysis of the United Slates
policy toward Latin American countries reflects
an accumulation of political errors. From the be
ginning years of this century to the 30's U.S. inter
vention in ihe internal affairs of some Latin Amer
ican countries contributed greatly to developing
"anti-imperialism" as an effective political ideology
in these countries.
As Robert Alexander has pointed out, "Latin
American nationalism has been largely anti-im
perialism." The "Good Neighbor Policy" has been
constructed in violation of the basic principles of
sovereignty by invading countries such as: Mexico,
Nicaragua. Guatemala, Haiti, The Dominican Re
public, etc.
These U.S. government interferences, together
with American business practices in Latin Ameri
ca. have created a bad image of the United States
in these countries. At the same time, it is neces
sary to point out that this erroneous U.S. foreign
policy has played directly into the hands of Com
munist propagandists.
During the Administration of President Ken
nedy, this situation tended to change. The Pro
gram of the Alliance for Progress created by Presi
dent Kennedy in his address to the Latin American
diplomatic corps on March 13, 1961, had a favor
aide impact on Latin American people. As an
example, trips by President Kennedy to Mexico
and Central America received a different welcome
than those of Vice-President Nix son in 1958 to Co
lombia, Venezuela, and Central America.
Cuban Revolution
Under the impact of the Cuban revolution and
conversion of this island into a socialistic country,
the American policy toward Latin America has
undergone some basic changes. It was my under
standing that those changes would be continued
by the present administration. Now we see an in
credible revision to the ear of the Big Stick and
Gunboat Diplomacy with the large scale invation of
ihe Dominican Republic by American Marines.
According to President Johnson, at the begin
ning. they were sent there to protect the American

citizens who live in that country, but now, they
are here not only with this purpose. U.S. marines
are in the Dominican Republic "to prevent the
establishment of another Cuba in this hemi
sphere."
On this point, as a Latin American, I would say
that ihe revolution to return lawful President Juan
Bosch to power is not a Communist one. The prin
cipal goal of the revolutionary movement is to
bring democracy in the Dominican Republic. The
revolution was won until the United States inter
vened.
It is necessary to be Latin American in order to
understand the psychological and political be
havior of students and young leaders in Latin
America countries. I believe that only a small per
centage of the present Dominican rebels are Com
munists or extreme left wing agitators. The ma
jority are people who do not want U.S. interven
tion in their internal affairs.
Thei Shores of Tripoli
For instance, 1 consider myself an admirer of
the United States of America, but if U.S. Marines
will intrude upon my country. I will fight against
them, because that is a violation of the inter-
American System ami the principle of sovereignty.
The genesis of this problem needs more analysis
but, it seems to me, that the fact that President
Johnson sent Marines without consulting the Or
ganization of American States is a fragrant viola
tion of O.A.S. charter.
Finally, it is important for American political
leaders to understand that it is not possible to
export democracy by sending U.S. Marines or by
military AID. If the United States does not want
another Cuba in this hemisphere, it is indispens
able to improve the social and economic conditions
of the majority of the people in Latin America. It
is necessary to improve the existent pattern of
income and wealth distribution.
It is essential to make structural changes in
the majority of Latin American countries by un
dertaking real programs of land reform, public
administration reform and taxation reform. The
United States would not forget that hunger, gov
ernment corruption and high degree of social and
economic inequality are the best alliance for the
method of Communist propaganda.

American nationalism has been largely anti-im
perialism." The "Good Neighbor Policy" has been
constructed in violation of the basic principles of
sovereignty by invading countries such as: Mexico,
Nicaragua. Guatemala, Haiti, The Dominican Re
public, etc.
These U.S. government interferences, together
with American business practices in Latin Ameri
ca. have created a bad image of the United States
in these countries. At the same time, it is neces
sary to point out that this erroneous U.S. foreign
policy has played directly into the hands of Com
munist propagandists.
During the Administration of President Ken
nedy, this situation tended to change. The Pro
gram of the Alliance for Progress created by Presi
dent Kennedy in his address to the Latin American
diplomatic corps on March 13, 1961, had a favor
aide impact on Latin American people. As an
example, trips by President Kennedy to Mexico
and Central America received a different welcome
than those of Vice-President Nix son in 1958 to Co
lombia, Venezuela, and Central America.
Cuban Revolution
Under the impact of the Cuban revolution and
conversion of this island into a socialistic country,
the American policy toward Latin America has
undergone some basic changes. It was my under
standing that those changes would be continued
by the present administration. Now we see an in
credible revision to the ear of the Big Stick and
Gunboat Diplomacy with the large scale invation of
ihe Dominican Republic by American Marines.
According to President Johnson, at the begin
ning. they were sent there to protect the American

citizens who live in that country, but now, they
are here not only with this purpose. U.S. marines
are in the Dominican Republic "to prevent the
establishment of another Cuba in this hemi
sphere."
On this point, as a Latin American, I would say
that ihe revolution to return lawful President Juan
Bosch to power is not a Communist one. The prin
cipal goal of the revolutionary movement is to
bring democracy in the Dominican Republic. The
revolution was won until the United States inter
vened.
It is necessary to be Latin American in order to
understand the psychological and political be
havior of students and young leaders in Latin
America countries. I believe that only a small per
centage of the present Dominican rebels are Com
munists or extreme left wing agitators. The ma
jority are people who do not want U.S. interven
tion in their internal affairs.
Thei Shores of Tripoli
For instance, 1 consider myself an admirer of
the United States of America, but if U.S. Marines
will intrude upon my country. I will fight against
them, because that is a violation of the inter-
American System ami the principle of sovereignty.
The genesis of this problem needs more analysis
but, it seems to me, that the fact that President
Johnson sent Marines without consulting the Or
ganization of American States is a fragrant viola
tion of O.A.S. charter.
Finally, it is important for American political
leaders to understand that it is not possible to
export democracy by sending U.S. Marines or by
military AID. If the United States does not want
another Cuba in this hemisphere, it is indispens
able to improve the social and economic conditions
of the majority of the people in Latin America. It
is necessary to improve the existent pattern of
income and wealth distribution.
It is essential to make structural changes in
the majority of Latin American countries by un
dertaking real programs of land reform, public
administration reform and taxation reform. The
United States would not forget that hunger, gov
ernment corruption and high degree of social and
economic inequality are the best alliance for the
method of Communist propaganda.
The historical analysis of the United Slates
policy toward Latin American countries reflects
an accumulation of political errors. From the be
ginning years of this century to the 30's U.S. inter
vention in ihe internal affairs of some Latin Amer
ican countries contributed greatly to developing
"anti-imperialism" as an effective political ideology
in these countries.
