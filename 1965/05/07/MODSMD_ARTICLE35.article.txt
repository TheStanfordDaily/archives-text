The agony which the Dominican
country suffers is today the same
of all the Americas. What is tak
ing place there now is another
frustrated attempt by the Domin
ican people to liberate themselves
from the military forces. The
struggle pertains not only to the
Dominican Republic but to all
South America.
Today history is repeating it

self. Santo Domingo was occupied j
militaristically by the U.S. in 1921.
II was occupied because the Do- j
minican Republic could not pay a
pecuniary debt to this country, j
Nevertheless, this lasted very
shortly. But before leaving Do
minican soil, the U.S. left in power
a young militarist - Rafael L. j
Trujillo. This man does not need |
description for those who are in-j
terested in world situations.
He terrorized this island with I
one of history's most beastly die- >
tatorships. In his thirty-two years
in power he left 50,000 Dominicans
in their graves and 20,000 Haitians
to the same fate.
I'illar ol" An(i-( omnuinism
Trujillo was Washington's pet ;

because he was a pillar of anti-
Communist in the Americas.
There was no Communists in San
to Domingo during 32 years—
but also there was no liberty. The
least criticism of his regime was
paid by death. There was peace —
peace of the dead.
On May 30, 1962, the dictator
was at last murdered. Free elec
tions took place under the pro
tection of the O.A.S. and Juan
Bosch was elected. These were the
first free elections the country
has had in this century.
Bosch eliminated administra
tive corruption in less than seven
months. But the discontentment
among the military -— because
their old privileges were not "rec

| ognized" or facilitated by Bosch's
i presidency—gave the final blow
.to his government and ho was
forced to exile again.
Today the Dominican people
| have risen again to put back what
| has been taken away (he legiti
i mate ruler to their government.
I Hours before this would have
; taken place, their hopes were ban
| ished by the American presence.
The outcome is known to all
j American Marines and (he Do
; miniean Air Force are fighting
j against two million helpless hu
man beings whose only yearn
! ings are liberty, democracy, and
j social justice.
No Consultation
The U.S. sent these marines
without any consultation whatso
ever with the O.A.S.—violating
the most elementary principles of
the interameriean system of non
intervention in the internal af
fairs of a sovereign state.
The reason Washington gave
for its action was that they were
protecting American citizens
there. Today a lot of them have
been evacuated but the number of
Marines is steadily increasing.
There is no moral, legal, or hu
manitarian justification for this
occupation; there were many
ways these citizens could have
been evacuated.
In the eyes of Latin Americans
the U.S. policy for their countries
is similar to the policy of the Ro
man Empire for its possessions:
"Law and order" that were ac
complished by Roman legions, to
day are accomplished by the Ma
rines not taking into considera
tion that by these means, as in the
past, human misery is augmented.
Law and Order
It may be that this order and
this law are established. Order
and law exist also in Tahti, Nic
aragua, Guatemala, Paraguay —
and these are the implements of
the military to suppress the voices
of millions whose only wish is to
live a decent, dignified life with
out hunger.
This order and law is the same
that Governor Wallace wants for
the Negroes in Alabama.
The U.S. has taken a negative
step today. The hopes of South
American people are in mourning,
! as are those of all genuine demo
{ crats in this western hemisphere.
Today my people suffers in de
! spair. And it is inconceivable that
| this country, where justice was
' born and so diffused, should be
the same to promote injustice, as
far as Latin American policy is
concerned

The agony which the Dominican
country suffers is today the same
of all the Americas. What is tak
ing place there now is another
frustrated attempt by the Domin
ican people to liberate themselves
from the military forces. The
struggle pertains not only to the
Dominican Republic but to all
South America.
Today history is repeating it

self. Santo Domingo was occupied j
militaristically by the U.S. in 1921.
II was occupied because the Do- j
minican Republic could not pay a
pecuniary debt to this country, j
Nevertheless, this lasted very
shortly. But before leaving Do
minican soil, the U.S. left in power
a young militarist - Rafael L. j
Trujillo. This man does not need |
description for those who are in-j
terested in world situations.
He terrorized this island with I
one of history's most beastly die- >
tatorships. In his thirty-two years
in power he left 50,000 Dominicans
in their graves and 20,000 Haitians
to the same fate.
I'illar ol" An(i-( omnuinism
Trujillo was Washington's pet ;

because he was a pillar of anti-
Communist in the Americas.
There was no Communists in San
to Domingo during 32 years—
but also there was no liberty. The
least criticism of his regime was
paid by death. There was peace —
peace of the dead.
On May 30, 1962, the dictator
was at last murdered. Free elec
tions took place under the pro
tection of the O.A.S. and Juan
Bosch was elected. These were the
first free elections the country
has had in this century.
Bosch eliminated administra
tive corruption in less than seven
months. But the discontentment
among the military -— because
their old privileges were not "rec

| ognized" or facilitated by Bosch's
i presidency—gave the final blow
.to his government and ho was
forced to exile again.
Today the Dominican people
| have risen again to put back what
| has been taken away (he legiti
i mate ruler to their government.
I Hours before this would have
; taken place, their hopes were ban
| ished by the American presence.
The outcome is known to all
j American Marines and (he Do
; miniean Air Force are fighting
j against two million helpless hu
man beings whose only yearn
! ings are liberty, democracy, and
j social justice.
No Consultation
The U.S. sent these marines
without any consultation whatso
ever with the O.A.S.—violating
the most elementary principles of
the interameriean system of non
intervention in the internal af
fairs of a sovereign state.
The reason Washington gave
for its action was that they were
protecting American citizens
there. Today a lot of them have
been evacuated but the number of
Marines is steadily increasing.
There is no moral, legal, or hu
manitarian justification for this
occupation; there were many
ways these citizens could have
been evacuated.
In the eyes of Latin Americans
the U.S. policy for their countries
is similar to the policy of the Ro
man Empire for its possessions:
"Law and order" that were ac
complished by Roman legions, to
day are accomplished by the Ma
rines not taking into considera
tion that by these means, as in the
past, human misery is augmented.
Law and Order
It may be that this order and
this law are established. Order
and law exist also in Tahti, Nic
aragua, Guatemala, Paraguay —
and these are the implements of
the military to suppress the voices
of millions whose only wish is to
live a decent, dignified life with
out hunger.
This order and law is the same
that Governor Wallace wants for
the Negroes in Alabama.
The U.S. has taken a negative
step today. The hopes of South
American people are in mourning,
! as are those of all genuine demo
{ crats in this western hemisphere.
Today my people suffers in de
! spair. And it is inconceivable that
| this country, where justice was
' born and so diffused, should be
the same to promote injustice, as
far as Latin American policy is
concerned

The agony which the Dominican
country suffers is today the same
of all the Americas. What is tak
ing place there now is another
frustrated attempt by the Domin
ican people to liberate themselves
from the military forces. The
struggle pertains not only to the
Dominican Republic but to all
South America.
Today history is repeating it

self. Santo Domingo was occupied j
militaristically by the U.S. in 1921.
II was occupied because the Do- j
minican Republic could not pay a
pecuniary debt to this country, j
Nevertheless, this lasted very
shortly. But before leaving Do
minican soil, the U.S. left in power
a young militarist - Rafael L. j
Trujillo. This man does not need |
description for those who are in-j
terested in world situations.
He terrorized this island with I
one of history's most beastly die- >
tatorships. In his thirty-two years
in power he left 50,000 Dominicans
in their graves and 20,000 Haitians
to the same fate.
I'illar ol" An(i-( omnuinism
Trujillo was Washington's pet ;

because he was a pillar of anti-
Communist in the Americas.
There was no Communists in San
to Domingo during 32 years—
but also there was no liberty. The
least criticism of his regime was
paid by death. There was peace —
peace of the dead.
On May 30, 1962, the dictator
was at last murdered. Free elec
tions took place under the pro
tection of the O.A.S. and Juan
Bosch was elected. These were the
first free elections the country
has had in this century.
Bosch eliminated administra
tive corruption in less than seven
months. But the discontentment
among the military -— because
their old privileges were not "rec

| ognized" or facilitated by Bosch's
i presidency—gave the final blow
.to his government and ho was
forced to exile again.
Today the Dominican people
| have risen again to put back what
| has been taken away (he legiti
i mate ruler to their government.
I Hours before this would have
; taken place, their hopes were ban
| ished by the American presence.
The outcome is known to all
j American Marines and (he Do
; miniean Air Force are fighting
j against two million helpless hu
man beings whose only yearn
! ings are liberty, democracy, and
j social justice.
No Consultation
The U.S. sent these marines
without any consultation whatso
ever with the O.A.S.—violating
the most elementary principles of
the interameriean system of non
intervention in the internal af
fairs of a sovereign state.
The reason Washington gave
for its action was that they were
protecting American citizens
there. Today a lot of them have
been evacuated but the number of
Marines is steadily increasing.
There is no moral, legal, or hu
manitarian justification for this
occupation; there were many
ways these citizens could have
been evacuated.
In the eyes of Latin Americans
the U.S. policy for their countries
is similar to the policy of the Ro
man Empire for its possessions:
"Law and order" that were ac
complished by Roman legions, to
day are accomplished by the Ma
rines not taking into considera
tion that by these means, as in the
past, human misery is augmented.
Law and Order
It may be that this order and
this law are established. Order
and law exist also in Tahti, Nic
aragua, Guatemala, Paraguay —
and these are the implements of
the military to suppress the voices
of millions whose only wish is to
live a decent, dignified life with
out hunger.
This order and law is the same
that Governor Wallace wants for
the Negroes in Alabama.
The U.S. has taken a negative
step today. The hopes of South
American people are in mourning,
! as are those of all genuine demo
{ crats in this western hemisphere.
Today my people suffers in de
! spair. And it is inconceivable that
| this country, where justice was
' born and so diffused, should be
the same to promote injustice, as
far as Latin American policy is
concerned
