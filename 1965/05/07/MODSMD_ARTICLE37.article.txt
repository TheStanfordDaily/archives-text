"Agitators. That's fill those peo
ple from Berkeley were last fall."
It was a middle-aged business
man from Ft. Wayne, Indiana
speaking. And it was 1 aboard a
creaky, clattering railroad dining
car—who was listening one eve
ning last March. As the train
snaked its way into the dusk, the
distinguished, grey-haired gentle
man waxed on and on about the
inequities of student rebels.
'What in hell do they want?"
he finally asked, slamming his
big fist on the table. "Nothing but
trouble. That's what."
His wife, a demure little lady,
nodded her head in agreement.
And so, in effect, have countless
Americans who have been reading
about the unrest on college cam
puses across the nation. It is re
markable how misunderstood cur
rent student protest is. Even the
press, that arch defender of civil
liberties, has been negligent in its
responsibilities to probe ihese is
sues and explain them to the pub
lie.
I*'an of Women
Coverage last February of the
student furor over Stanford's dean
of women provides a good illus

tration. Although it was disclosed
that the dean had told certain
co-eds to report to her any "ob
scene references" made by Eng
lish instructors so she in turn
could have the instructor disci
plined- despite this glaring in
fringement on academic freedom,
not one newspaper (not even the
New York Times! nor one wire
service treated it as such. Instead
they chose to play up the charges
of lewdness in the classroom,
when in fact the controversy on
campus dealt chiefly with what
was considered an administrator's
attempt to overstep her preroga
tives.
And at Berkeley last fall the
press was quick to report on the
highly questionable tactics of
some FSMers. But there was little
attempt to explain the causes,
both immediate and underlying,
of the protest. Instead, the press
contented itself in describing stu
dent rallies as mobs, student lead
ers as beatniks; a drive for basic
liberties became a criminal orgy.
It was largely because of this
coverage, I am convinced, that the
protest fell into such public dis
repute. According to the Cali
fornia Poll in January 74 per cent
of the state's adults disapproved
of the movement, 55 per cent
"strongly."
Contrast to FKM
This is in stark contrast to opin
ion on the Berkeley campus,
where FSM earned wide support,
including the formal approval of
23 student political groups (span
ning the spectrum from left to
right>, the Academic Senate
(comprised of faculty members)
the Student Senate and the Grad
uate Coordinating Committee
This discrepancy in opinion be
tween on- and off-campus observ
ers indicates that some were bet
ter informed on the concomitants
of academic freedom than others.
But I think it also indicates that
those close to the scene were bet
ter informed them those viewing
it from afar, through the eyes
of the press.
Mervin Field of the California
Poll wrote that many interviewees
recalled hearing about the dem
onstrations "as 'riots,' •mobs,'
'strikes,' and a significant num
ber spontaneously mentioned that
they believe the whole thing was
Communist-backed or influenced
by outside sources."
The prototype of press bias peh
excellence was a headline that ap
pearred in one Southern Califor
nia newspaper covering the
crisis: "MORE BERKELEY
TRIVIA." Hardly a suitable de
secription for a protest that near
ly brought a major university to a
halt. A protest with goals widely
shared on American campuses —
especially at Stanford.
