## Interdisciplinary Approach 
### LAURA GELLMAN (Last in a Series 
At Stanford, as at most universities, the minds of students are
compartmentalized.
The division into humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences
is not simply a way to introduce students to several fields of knowl
edge. Rather, it reflects a more or less explicit assumption that

knowledge may be divided and<
that different approaches and
techniques are required in its ac
quisition.
It is clear that one does not
write a poem in the same manner
that one conducts a sociological
experiment. There are different
techniques and bodies of informa
tion and mastery of them neces
sitates a degree of concentration
with a field.
However the relationships be
tween the different techniques,
the insights one field can give into
another field, and the ways in
which an interdisciplinary ap
proach may be utilized to clarify
a given discipline and to under
stand a particular subject are gen
erallv unrecognized or disregard
ed.
Interdisciplinary Approach
The problem is rooted in the
belief that specialization, or the
mastery of a particular discipline,
even if it were considered the
aim of education, would be best
achieved by limiting t he field of
inquiry to that discipline.
The plea for an interdiscipli
nary approach to education rests
not only on the belief that it
will foster a liberal education but
also that it will provide the most
effective way to master a specific
area.
The General Studies divisions
and requirements may be sup
ported or criticized on many
grounds. The concern here is that
requiring a biology major to take
an introductory course in polit
ical science too often leaves the
student with the impression Ihat
he has been introduced to an
other "field of knowledge," inter
esting perhaps but irrelevant to
his own area of concentration.
Having fulfilled his obligation
to expose himself to a strange and
different discipline, he tends to re
turn to the fold, unaware of the
potential relationships between
the field to which he has just
been introduced and his own
major.
Relationship
Of course, the interdisciplinary
approach has not been totally
ignored at Stanford. There are
professors who bring psychology
into their courses in literature
or history, who deal with the re
lationship of the history of sci
ence to economics or sociology.
However to derive the maximum
benefit from such exposure, stu
dents must recognize the concept
of a relationship between disci
plines.
If the teacher is to be an ef
fective model of the inquiring
mind at work, the abstract and in
terdisciplinary frame of reference
on which he draws must be ex
plicitly understood. Furthermore,
the student must have sufficient
experience with various fields to
give meaning to interdisciplinary
investigations.
It is not enough, for example,
to borrow the concept of equi
librium from physics and toss it
into a discussion about socializa
tion. Relationships must be made
clear and concept utilized in their
totality.
Thus there is the dual prob
lem of providing students with 1)
an understanding of the related
ness of knowledge and the possi
bilities of an interdisciplinary ap
proach and 2) with the necessary
experience in different fields.
Le Prof Universal
Both students and faculty must
be attuned to the potential rela
tionships between disciplines. The
problem may be handled within
the individual class, although a
professor cannot of course, be
expected to be equally well versed
in all fields.
He must feel free, as does one pro
fessor of French conversation, to
relate subject matter to individ
uals as well as to other discipines.

Student discussions in French ol
their pers on a 1 philosophies,
though difficult, is meaningful
both in terms of education and
the creation of the feeling of a
close academic community.
Courses within different depart
ments could also be correlated
with one another and relation
ships that currently exist could be
made more explicit for the stu
dents who might not otherwise
recognize them.
It is also possible to approach
the problem through a reorgani
zation of requirements within a
major, allowing for more courses
within other fields.
Such reorganization might in
volve raising the number of units
constituting a particular major by
permitting choice among a num
ber of additional courses from
other areas. The philosophy be
hind this program would differ
markely from that of the cur
rent General Studies require
ments.
Area Requirements
Whereas, for example, a hu
manities major must now take
courses in the natural and social
sciences, under the new system
these same courses would be seen
as in integral part of his major
in the humanities as well as an
integral part of a liberal educa
tion.
Certain programs are now at
tempting to integrate various
fields. Some 1 of the proposed
Freshman Seminars will focus
on a problem rather than as a
given discipline. The Honors Pro
gram in Social Thought:
Aims at a cleared understand
social sciences are able to make
to one another and t*> a specific
problem, an awerness of dif
ferences and agreements in
their theoretical assumptions
and facilitation of communica
tions among these disciplines. It
seeks to combine rigorous train
ing with the breadth of knowl
edge interdisciplinary study pro
vides. (Courses and Degrees,
1964-65)
The Honors Program in humani
ties shares similar interdiscipli
nary aims. It is unfortunate that
such programs are oases in a com
partmentalized system instead of
examples of a general trend.
A successful interdisciplinary
approach also demands the mas
tery of various techniques and
abilities such as composition, ex
position. empirical experimenta
tion, logical thinking, analogical
thinking, analytical thinking, etc.
Too often these techniques are re
quired as the by-product of the
study of a particular field.
Although it is not suggested
that mastery may be achieved
apart from a consideration of con
tent, more emphasis should be
placed on the acquisition and po
tentialities of these and other tech
niques during the early phases of
a university education. Such tech
niques would permit the student
to glean far more from a particu
lar course or field than would the
use of only those techniques com
monly associated with it.
The distinction has been made
between intelligence, excellence of
mind employed within a limited
sphere, and intellect, the critical,
creative, and contemplative side
of mind. "Whereas intelligence
seeks to grasp, manipulate, re
order, adjust, intellect examines,
ponders, wonders, theorizes, crit
icizes, and imagines.
Education must be primarily
concerned with the development
and stimulation of intellect.
Through mastery of techniques
and an understanding of the re
latedness of knowledge in terms
of an interdisciplinary approach
tho student may be provided with
the raw materials necessary to do
velope his intellect and obtain the
utmost from his education.

Although it is not suggested
that mastery may be achieved

to glean far more from a particu

At Stanford, as at most universities, the minds of students are
compartmentalized.
The division into humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences
is not simply a way to introduce students to several fields of knowl

knowledge may be divided and<
that different approaches and
techniques are required in its ac
quisition.
It is clear that one does not
write a poem in the same manner
that one conducts a sociological
experiment. There are different
techniques and bodies of informa
tion and mastery of them neces
sitates a degree of concentration
with a field.
However the relationships be

the insights one field can give into
another field, and the ways in
which an interdisciplinary ap

Interdisciplinary Approach
The problem is rooted in the
belief that specialization, or the
mastery of a particular discipline,
even if it were considered the
aim of education, would be best
achieved by limiting t he field of
inquiry to that discipline.
The plea for an interdiscipli
nary approach to education rests
not only on the belief that it
will foster a liberal education but
also that it will provide the most
effective way to master a specific
area.
The General Studies divisions
and requirements may be sup
ported or criticized on many
grounds. The concern here is that
requiring a biology major to take
an introductory course in polit
ical science too often leaves the
student with the impression Ihat
he has been introduced to an
other "field of knowledge," inter
esting perhaps but irrelevant to
his own area of concentration.
Having fulfilled his obligation
to expose himself to a strange and
different discipline, he tends to re
turn to the fold, unaware of the
potential relationships between
the field to which he has just
been introduced and his own
major.
Relationship
Of course, the interdisciplinary
approach has not been totally
ignored at Stanford. There are
professors who bring psychology
into their courses in literature
or history, who deal with the re
lationship of the history of sci
ence to economics or sociology.
However to derive the maximum
benefit from such exposure, stu
dents must recognize the concept
of a relationship between disci
plines.
If the teacher is to be an ef
fective model of the inquiring
mind at work, the abstract and in
terdisciplinary frame of reference
on which he draws must be ex
plicitly understood. Furthermore,
the student must have sufficient
experience with various fields to
give meaning to interdisciplinary
investigations.
It is not enough, for example,
to borrow the concept of equi
librium from physics and toss it
into a discussion about socializa
tion. Relationships must be made
clear and concept utilized in their
totality.
Thus there is the dual prob
lem of providing students with 1)
an understanding of the related
ness of knowledge and the possi
bilities of an interdisciplinary ap
proach and 2) with the necessary
experience in different fields.
Le Prof Universal
Both students and faculty must
be attuned to the potential rela
tionships between disciplines. The
problem may be handled within
the individual class, although a
professor cannot of course, be
expected to be equally well versed
in all fields.
He must feel free, as does one pro
fessor of French conversation, to
relate subject matter to individ
uals as well as to other discipines.

Student discussions in French ol
their pers on a 1 philosophies,
though difficult, is meaningful
both in terms of education and
the creation of the feeling of a
close academic community.
Courses within different depart
ments could also be correlated
with one another and relation
ships that currently exist could be
made more explicit for the stu
dents who might not otherwise
recognize them.
It is also possible to approach
the problem through a reorgani
zation of requirements within a
major, allowing for more courses
within other fields.
Such reorganization might in
volve raising the number of units
constituting a particular major by
permitting choice among a num
ber of additional courses from
other areas. The philosophy be
hind this program would differ
markely from that of the cur
rent General Studies require
ments.

experience with various fields to
give meaning to interdisciplinary
investigations.
It is not enough, for example,
to borrow the concept of equi
librium from physics and toss it
into a discussion about socializa
tion. Relationships must be made
clear and concept utilized in their
totality.
Thus there is the dual prob

an understanding of the related
ness of knowledge and the possi
bilities of an interdisciplinary ap
proach and 2) with the necessary
experience in different fields.
Le Prof Universal
Both students and faculty must
be attuned to the potential rela
tionships between disciplines. The
problem may be handled within
the individual class, although a
professor cannot of course, be
expected to be equally well versed
in all fields.
He must feel free, as does one pro
fessor of French conversation, to
relate subject matter to individ
uals as well as to other discipines.

Student discussions in French ol
their pers on a 1 philosophies,
though difficult, is meaningful
both in terms of education and
the creation of the feeling of a
close academic community.
Courses within different depart

with one another and relation
ships that currently exist could be
made more explicit for the stu
dents who might not otherwise
recognize them.
It is also possible to approach
the problem through a reorgani
zation of requirements within a
major, allowing for more courses
within other fields.
Such reorganization might in
volve raising the number of units
constituting a particular major by
permitting choice among a num
ber of additional courses from
other areas. The philosophy be
hind this program would differ
markely from that of the cur
rent General Studies require
ments.
Area Requirements
Whereas, for example, a hu
manities major must now take
courses in the natural and social
sciences, under the new system
these same courses would be seen
as in integral part of his major
in the humanities as well as an
integral part of a liberal educa
tion.
Certain programs are now at
tempting to integrate various
fields. Some 1 of the proposed
Freshman Seminars will focus
on a problem rather than as a
given discipline. The Honors Pro
gram in Social Thought:
Aims at a cleared understand
social sciences are able to make
to one another and t*> a specific
problem, an awerness of dif
ferences and agreements in
their theoretical assumptions
and facilitation of communica
tions among these disciplines. It
seeks to combine rigorous train
ing with the breadth of knowl
edge interdisciplinary study pro
vides. (Courses and Degrees,
1964-65)
The Honors Program in humani
ties shares similar interdiscipli
nary aims. It is unfortunate that
such programs are oases in a com
partmentalized system instead of
examples of a general trend.
A successful interdisciplinary
approach also demands the mas
tery of various techniques and
abilities such as composition, ex
position. empirical experimenta
tion, logical thinking, analogical
thinking, analytical thinking, etc.
Too often these techniques are re
quired as the by-product of the
study of a particular field.
Although it is not suggested
that mastery may be achieved
apart from a consideration of con
tent, more emphasis should be
placed on the acquisition and po
tentialities of these and other tech
niques during the early phases of
a university education. Such tech
niques would permit the student
to glean far more from a particu
lar course or field than would the
use of only those techniques com
monly associated with it.
The distinction has been made
between intelligence, excellence of
mind employed within a limited
sphere, and intellect, the critical,
creative, and contemplative side
of mind. "Whereas intelligence
seeks to grasp, manipulate, re

ponders, wonders, theorizes, crit
icizes, and imagines.
Education must be primarily
concerned with the development
and stimulation of intellect.
Through mastery of techniques
and an understanding of the re

the raw materials necessary to do
velope his intellect and obtain the
utmost from his education.
At Stanford, as at most universities, the minds of students are
compartmentalized.
The division into humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences
is not simply a way to introduce students to several fields of knowl
edge. Rather, it reflects a more or less explicit assumption that

knowledge may be divided and<
that different approaches and
techniques are required in its ac
quisition.
It is clear that one does not
write a poem in the same manner
that one conducts a sociological
experiment. There are different
techniques and bodies of informa
tion and mastery of them neces
sitates a degree of concentration
with a field.
However the relationships be
tween the different techniques,
the insights one field can give into
another field, and the ways in
which an interdisciplinary ap
proach may be utilized to clarify
a given discipline and to under
stand a particular subject are gen
erallv unrecognized or disregard
ed.
Interdisciplinary Approach
The problem is rooted in the
belief that specialization, or the
mastery of a particular discipline,
even if it were considered the
aim of education, would be best
achieved by limiting t he field of
inquiry to that discipline.
The plea for an interdiscipli
nary approach to education rests
not only on the belief that it
will foster a liberal education but
also that it will provide the most
effective way to master a specific
area.
The General Studies divisions
and requirements may be sup
ported or criticized on many
grounds. The concern here is that
requiring a biology major to take
an introductory course in polit
ical science too often leaves the
student with the impression Ihat
he has been introduced to an
other "field of knowledge," inter
esting perhaps but irrelevant to
his own area of concentration.
Having fulfilled his obligation
to expose himself to a strange and
different discipline, he tends to re
turn to the fold, unaware of the
potential relationships between
the field to which he has just
been introduced and his own
major.
Relationship
Of course, the interdisciplinary
approach has not been totally
ignored at Stanford. There are
professors who bring psychology
into their courses in literature
or history, who deal with the re
lationship of the history of sci
ence to economics or sociology.
However to derive the maximum
benefit from such exposure, stu
dents must recognize the concept
of a relationship between disci
plines.
If the teacher is to be an ef
fective model of the inquiring
mind at work, the abstract and in
terdisciplinary frame of reference
on which he draws must be ex
plicitly understood. Furthermore,
the student must have sufficient
experience with various fields to
give meaning to interdisciplinary
investigations.

techniques and bodies of informa
tion and mastery of them neces
sitates a degree of concentration
with a field.
However the relationships be
tween the different techniques,
the insights one field can give into
another field, and the ways in
which an interdisciplinary ap
proach may be utilized to clarify
a given discipline and to under
stand a particular subject are gen
erallv unrecognized or disregard
ed.
Interdisciplinary Approach
The problem is rooted in the
belief that specialization, or the
mastery of a particular discipline,
even if it were considered the
aim of education, would be best
achieved by limiting t he field of
inquiry to that discipline.
The plea for an interdiscipli
nary approach to education rests
not only on the belief that it
will foster a liberal education but
also that it will provide the most
effective way to master a specific
area.
The General Studies divisions
and requirements may be sup
ported or criticized on many
grounds. The concern here is that
requiring a biology major to take
an introductory course in polit
ical science too often leaves the
student with the impression Ihat
he has been introduced to an
other "field of knowledge," inter
esting perhaps but irrelevant to
his own area of concentration.
Having fulfilled his obligation
to expose himself to a strange and
different discipline, he tends to re
turn to the fold, unaware of the
potential relationships between
the field to which he has just
been introduced and his own
major.
Relationship
Of course, the interdisciplinary
approach has not been totally
ignored at Stanford. There are
professors who bring psychology
into their courses in literature
or history, who deal with the re
lationship of the history of sci
ence to economics or sociology.
However to derive the maximum
benefit from such exposure, stu
dents must recognize the concept
of a relationship between disci
plines.
If the teacher is to be an ef
fective model of the inquiring
mind at work, the abstract and in
terdisciplinary frame of reference
on which he draws must be ex
plicitly understood. Furthermore,
the student must have sufficient
experience with various fields to
give meaning to interdisciplinary
investigations.
It is not enough, for example,
to borrow the concept of equi
librium from physics and toss it
into a discussion about socializa
tion. Relationships must be made
clear and concept utilized in their
totality.
Thus there is the dual prob
lem of providing students with 1)
an understanding of the related
ness of knowledge and the possi
bilities of an interdisciplinary ap
proach and 2) with the necessary
experience in different fields.
Le Prof Universal
Both students and faculty must
be attuned to the potential rela
tionships between disciplines. The
problem may be handled within
the individual class, although a
professor cannot of course, be
expected to be equally well versed
in all fields.
He must feel free, as does one pro
fessor of French conversation, to
relate subject matter to individ
uals as well as to other discipines.

Student discussions in French ol
their pers on a 1 philosophies,
though difficult, is meaningful
both in terms of education and
the creation of the feeling of a
close academic community.
Courses within different depart
ments could also be correlated
with one another and relation
ships that currently exist could be
made more explicit for the stu
dents who might not otherwise
recognize them.
It is also possible to approach
the problem through a reorgani
zation of requirements within a
major, allowing for more courses
within other fields.
Such reorganization might in
volve raising the number of units
constituting a particular major by
permitting choice among a num
ber of additional courses from
other areas. The philosophy be
hind this program would differ
markely from that of the cur
rent General Studies require
ments.
Area Requirements
Whereas, for example, a hu
manities major must now take
courses in the natural and social
sciences, under the new system
these same courses would be seen
as in integral part of his major
in the humanities as well as an
integral part of a liberal educa
tion.
Certain programs are now at
tempting to integrate various
fields. Some 1 of the proposed
Freshman Seminars will focus
on a problem rather than as a
given discipline. The Honors Pro
gram in Social Thought:
Aims at a cleared understand
social sciences are able to make
to one another and t*> a specific
problem, an awerness of dif
ferences and agreements in
their theoretical assumptions
and facilitation of communica
tions among these disciplines. It
seeks to combine rigorous train
ing with the breadth of knowl
edge interdisciplinary study pro
vides. (Courses and Degrees,
1964-65)
The Honors Program in humani
ties shares similar interdiscipli
nary aims. It is unfortunate that
such programs are oases in a com
partmentalized system instead of
examples of a general trend.
A successful interdisciplinary
approach also demands the mas
tery of various techniques and
abilities such as composition, ex
position. empirical experimenta
tion, logical thinking, analogical
thinking, analytical thinking, etc.
Too often these techniques are re
quired as the by-product of the
study of a particular field.
Although it is not suggested
that mastery may be achieved
apart from a consideration of con
tent, more emphasis should be
placed on the acquisition and po
tentialities of these and other tech
niques during the early phases of
a university education. Such tech
niques would permit the student
to glean far more from a particu
lar course or field than would the
use of only those techniques com
monly associated with it.
The distinction has been made
between intelligence, excellence of
mind employed within a limited
sphere, and intellect, the critical,
creative, and contemplative side
of mind. "Whereas intelligence
seeks to grasp, manipulate, re
order, adjust, intellect examines,
ponders, wonders, theorizes, crit
icizes, and imagines.
Education must be primarily
concerned with the development
and stimulation of intellect.
Through mastery of techniques
and an understanding of the re
latedness of knowledge in terms
of an interdisciplinary approach
tho student may be provided with
the raw materials necessary to do
velope his intellect and obtain the
utmost from his education.
