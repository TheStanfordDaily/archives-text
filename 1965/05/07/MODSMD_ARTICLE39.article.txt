## Justin Beck vs. the Stanford Coed 
### 
Dear Mr. Berk:
Do you really think all women
should bo automatically excluded
from voting in ASSU elections?
That's a bit unsubtle. How about
a rule under which all persons
who didn't just look qualified to
vote would have to interpret the
ASSU Constitution.
If that is unfeasible we could
post Stanford police at the polls
to take names of women au
dacious enough to vote. These
names could be turned over to
professors and the 'uppity' dollies
would receive straight F's.
Or the polls might be placed up
stairs in men's dorms and open
from, say 2:30 to *5:00 a.m. I
hope these suggestions prove help
ful.
By the way, what's your home
address? It's only fair to tell us
where we can hold the sit-in.

Dear Mr. Berk:
Do you really think all women
should bo automatically excluded
from voting in ASSU elections?
That's a bit unsubtle. How about
a rule under which all persons
who didn't just look qualified to
vote would have to interpret the
ASSU Constitution.
If that is unfeasible we could
post Stanford police at the polls
to take names of women au
dacious enough to vote. These
names could be turned over to
professors and the 'uppity' dollies
would receive straight F's.
Or the polls might be placed up
stairs in men's dorms and open
from, say 2:30 to *5:00 a.m. I
hope these suggestions prove help
ful.
By the way, what's your home
address? It's only fair to tell us
where we can hold the sit-in.
