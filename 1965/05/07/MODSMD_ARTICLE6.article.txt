# Dominican Intervention Called â€˜Reversion To the Big Stick'
## 
### KIRK HANSON 
The United States has made a
"reversion to the era of the big
stick," according to Mario Rietti
of Honduras, one of several Latin
American students who held a
discussion yesterday at the I Cen
ter on U.S. Dominican interven
tion.

| He continued his introductory
j statement: "If the U.S. Marines
landed in my country, I would
| fight against them." As the dis
i cussion progressed, U.S. action in j
! the Dominican Republic was also ;
termed part of the "Johnson Doc
trine" and action "against the'
charter of the OAS."

Following Reitti's introductory
statement, Peruvian graduate stu
dent Carlos Del Rio pointed out
that as far as the Latin Ameri
cans were concerned, Juan Bosch
was ihe "hope" of the Dominicans
after thirty years of dictatorship.
Any action against the return of
Bosch to power would naturally
be opposed.
Del Rio said U.S. efforts should
not be 10 protect investments, but
rather toward a "concern for hu
man problems. We arc struggling
for life." The Latin Americans
are concerned over food, housing,!
and education first, then type of,
government second.
He said the United States
should concern itself with "land!
reform, public administration re
form, and taxation reform."
Communist Revolt
The discussion was highlighted '
by a confrontation over the ques
tion of Communists in the Domin
ican revolt. According to Rietti.
Communists are present, but this
does not mean they are a big fac
tor.
Herman Syaira pointed out that
communism is a 'very dynamic
doctrine," and as such supports
the leftists in all Latin American
countries. Communists fight with
them, but this fact "does not
mean the revolutions are guided
by the communists."
Del Rio suggested that a prac
tical lesson of the Dominican in
cident may be that the Latin
American nations will have to
equip themselves not only to pre
vent the takeover by Communists
but also to protect themselves
from the landing of the Marines."
