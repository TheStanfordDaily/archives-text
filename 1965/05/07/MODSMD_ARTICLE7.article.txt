# MEL Students To Open Sastre Play
## 
### 
The Stanford Spanish Theatre;
Group will present "En la red," j
by Spanish dramatist Alfonso
Sastre, tomorrow at 3 and S p.m. i
at the Women's Clubhouse.
The play, to be performed in j
Spanish, is a recreation of t he,
atmosphere of courage, fear, and
violence that existed in a North
African country during the fight '
for liberation from a colonial j
power.
Sastre uses hidden cells, clande- (
stine meetings, and guerrilla ac
tion in i lie desert as a background
for the agony of five members of
the underground movement, hid- ;
ing in an empty apartment wait- ;
ing for the end of a raid by the
police and the army.

Sastre goes beyond the specific
problem of a historical situation.,
lie works with the more univer-1
sal problem of a group of people I
sacrificing their comfort and, if i
necessary, their lives in a fight!
for their ideals.
Part of the price they pay is :
the lack of trust which they are!
forced to exhibit, for fear of infil- j
(ration.
The actors in "En la red," all
students of the Spanish Drama
tics course in the Modern Euro
pean Languages Department, are
Anthony Andrews, George Ca
brera, Mary Cachu, Art Fisher,
Sonja Hoskanson, and Warren
Lyons.
The play will be directed by j
Luis S. Ponce de Loon.
