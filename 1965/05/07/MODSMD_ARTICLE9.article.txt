# Quorum Calls Thwart Action By Legislature
## 
### 
The Legislature adjourned lust night at 11:20 p.m. still unable
to resolve the question of how to present the question of LASSU
speaking out on olf-campus issues to the student body for a vote.
Speaker Ed Shaw aequieseed to a call lor a quorum for the
fourth time; 69 members were needed, far fewer were present.

Shaw told The Daily that there*
would be a meeting of the Rules
Committee at 1 p.m. Sunday after
noon in the LASSU Office in Tre
sidder to hear any and all sug
gestions. The Legislature will
meet next Monday night at 8 p.m.
to reach a final decision on how
many of the four proposed al
ternatives would Ik? placed on the
ballot for consideration.
The initial petition would limit
â€¢ the ASSU to speaking out solely
! on matters that pertain to on-cam-
I pus affairs.
Two other proposals would re
quire either a two-thirds roll call
j vote in the Legislature or make
;an all-campus plebiscite manda
tory.
The final proposal would assert j
that the ASSU "shall have the!
right to express its consensus on !
any issue which is of deep con-1
cern to the student body."
Before the major business of
the meeting, the off-campus issue,
was brought before the Legisla
ture, there were three separate
quorum calls from the floor.
Barry Flachsbart, a graduate
representative, called for the first
count. Seventy-four members
were present, the exact number|
for a legal quorum.
After the count, Flachsbart and
{one other LASSU representative
! walked out.
: Five minutes later Roy Hem
mingway, substitute representa
tive for Mike Tobin, called a point !
of order so that he might re
quest a second quorum count.'
1 His request, however, was out of
j order.
'This call for a quorum is fri
volous, dilatory and absurd," the'
Chair commented.
The third call for a quorum was ;
made soon afterward by Jim;
Greenley, representative from F1 !
! Toro. Before the count was taken,
Shaw called for a ten minute re
cess in order that the official rec
ords could be checked.
"We have business to take care
of," Shaw stated, "and we have
not gotten to it. If we do not have
a quorum present, I intend to eall
a special meeting."
During the recess the official j
records would be checked, he said, !
and a count would be taken of I
the representatives who had j
missed three meetings in a row. j
According to the ASSU Constitu
tion, this disqualifies them as j
representatives.

Eleven people were stricken
from the roll, which dropped the
legal number needed for a quroum
to 69. After the recess, 71 mem
bers were counted for the third
quorum call.
"We have a legal quorum,"
Shaw stated, "but it is unfortu
nate that we had to go about it
in this way."
In ot her business, LASSU
unanimous passed a resolution
supporting the recent action of
the Sigma Chi fraternity in oppose
I ing discrimination.
A bill altering the status of the
Speaker and the time and method
of his election was also passed
I with four dissenting votes.
The bill provided for the nomi
| nations the week following the
! final spring ASSU election, a n d
J the election of the Speaker the
j week after that.
