SAN JUAN, Pureto Rico- The former elect
ed president of the Dominican Republic con
tended yesterday that U.S. military interven
tion there had created more Latin-American
Communists in a week than the Russians, Red
Chinese and Cubans could make in five years.
Bosch said in an interview that what hap
pened in the Dominican Republic since the U.S.
forces landed late last month would have
"tremendous impact" throughout Latin Amer
ica.

Bosch was bitterly critical oi U.S. Ambassa
dor W. Tapley Bennett in Santo Domingo and
of reports that the revolt staged by supporters
of Bosch's Dominican Revolutionary Party had
been infilitrated by known Communists.
He charged that the U.S. government received
"false information from Mr. Bennett and thus
committed its mistakes." He also charged that
the ambassador, after pro-Bosch army forces
revolted April 24, called the civilian and mili
tary leaders of the revolt and threatened them
with the U.S. military machine unless they
surrendered to the counter-revolutionary forces
of Brig. Gen. Elias Wessin.

The star attraction was a pair of 110-foot,
three-stage rockets which the Soviet news

Tass said their range was "unlimited" and
that "they are similar" to the rockets that
launched the Vostok and Voskhod manned

SAN JUAN, Pureto Rico- The former elect

tended yesterday that U.S. military interven

Communists in a week than the Russians, Red
Chinese and Cubans could make in five years.
Bosch said in an interview that what hap

forces landed late last month would have
"tremendous impact" throughout Latin Amer
ica.

Bosch was bitterly critical oi U.S. Ambassa
dor W. Tapley Bennett in Santo Domingo and
of reports that the revolt staged by supporters
of Bosch's Dominican Revolutionary Party had
been infilitrated by known Communists.
He charged that the U.S. government received
"false information from Mr. Bennett and thus
committed its mistakes." He also charged that
the ambassador, after pro-Bosch army forces
revolted April 24, called the civilian and mili
tary leaders of the revolt and threatened them
with the U.S. military machine unless they
surrendered to the counter-revolutionary forces
of Brig. Gen. Elias Wessin.
