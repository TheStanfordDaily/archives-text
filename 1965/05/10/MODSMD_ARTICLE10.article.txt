# Deans: Counseling or Discipline?
## 
### KIRK HANSON (First of a Series 
With the publication of Iho Crow-Halver
son Report Winter quarter, serious ques
tions were asked concerning the function of
the Deans at Stanford. These questions have
been asked before, but with the passage of
the Judicial Competence Bill by the Legisla
ture and the subseqent approval of a related
resolution by an Administration - Faculty
Committee, these questions demand immed
iate answers.
The basic issue is the apparent conflict be
tween the counseling and disciplinary func
tions of the deans. Can a dean who has the
power to report and prosecute a student for
improper actions be effective in counseling
that student?
Fear of ilic Dean
Wouldn't it be natural for the student to
fear going to the dean with his problem?
The student would only be subjecting him
self to punishment by the judicial process.
Anything he might say could be held against
him.
But if tho dean was just a counselor, sep
arated from the judicial process, might he
be more effective? Is it feasible to separate
the deans entirely from the disciplinary
function?
This problem was taken to three men in
volved with student problems: Dr. John D.
Black. Director of the Counseling and Test
ing Center. Dr. IJ. Nevitt Sanford, Director

of I ho Institute for the Study of Human
Problems, and Dr. James A. Paulsen, Staff
Psychiatrist.
Insufficient Aid
Dr. Black stated he felt that "the adminis
trative personnel should serve more as coun
selors and less as disciplinarians." He saw
the difficulty that "the student don't get suf
ficient aid in working out a set of moral
values under the present University cirrieu
lum and organization."
The effect of this conflict on other stu
dents problems was pointed out by Dr. Black
when he said: "If there were someone to
whom they could go regularly for advice,
someone they didn't have to fear, then it
might have good results in such problem
areas as sex and drinking."
When interviewed, Dr. Sanford stated he
would agree with the general principle that
"persons who will be counselors cannot be
in a position of authority." He further said
that it the deans had tho power to report
and discipline the students, "there would
not be the mutual trust needed for psy
chotherapeutic counseling."
A Changing Image
Dr. Sanford saw the current problem as
more than just a conflict between the coun
seling and disciplinary functions of the
deans. He saw this as evidence of a chang
ing image of the ideal dean. He said: "Stu
dents want to get rid of the parent type."
According to Dr. Sanford: "The old
fashioned dean eared a lot about the stu
dents" lie cited Dean Winbi√üler as this

type of dean who had been very successful
in gelling to know thousands of students
through communicating with them and
their parents.
Student dissatisfaction with the "parent
figure" was seen as having to do with their
feelings that the college, through the deans,
has done little on the positive side, all on
the negative side. The negative of course
was the disciplinary, while the positive was
the help given through counseling.
Not Drum roiiiKlinu
Dr. Paulsen has spoken out many times
concerning the Judicial Reform movement
and the proposed student bill of rights. He
said he "would welcome a change" in the
fuction of the deans. He stated that the
conflict existing today "makes the deans
functionally ineffective."
While he did not support a complete re
moval of the deans from the disciplinary
function, he said the system "has been ob
viously unjust as it has been." He said
the old system would work if you had an
"unhappy, disappointed, and prejudiced per
son" as dean.
"Unfortunately, we have had more of the
latter than of the former in recent years,"
stated Paulsen.
Dr. Black was optimistic about adminis
trative support for a proposal dividing the
counseling and disciplinary functions. He
said: "I think most of 4he deans would sup
port such an idea. Dean Allen often said she
would like to be removed from disciplinary
obligations.
