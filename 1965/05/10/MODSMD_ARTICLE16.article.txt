## United States Policy in Viet Nam Inconsistent with American Principles 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The present military conflict in
Viet Nam has led us tu serious
thought concerning our relation
ship to our Government's objec
tives and actions there. Our par
ticipation in the war in Viet Nam
has antagonized peoples around
the world and failed to enlist the
sympathy of those most affected
by it—the citizens of South Viet
Nam. Consideration of the history
of our intervention in Viet Nam,
and especially the course of events
of recent months, forces us to con
clude that our Government's pol
icies in Viet Nam are inconsistant
with the most honored principles
and ideals of the American peo
ple and are against their best in
terests.
We do not feel that we can in
good conscience serve in any mil
itary capacity in Viet Nam which
would perpetuate the present
armed conflict. We strongly urge
President Johnson to discontinue
our military offensive in Viet
Nam and enter into negotiations
with all concerned parties for a
non-military settlement. We ap
plaud the President's recently an
nounced plan to aid in the de
velopment of the Mekong River
Delta as a recognition of our Gov
ernment's deep responsibility for
the peaceful reconstruction of
Viet Nam.

• Pacifist Confusion
Editor, Til** Daily:
Discussions with several read
ers of my letter of April 7 on
pacifism made me aware that
some readers had a misunder
standing of the views of Mr. Sand
perl and Mr. Kepler.
Although I stated that it is
dangerous to rely on merely uni
lateral disarmament, and that
some nations will respect only a
forceful deterrent to lawbreak
ing, I would like to make clear
that they do not advocate the
"alweary-go limp" kind of pac
ifism.
In his pamphlet, "Nonviolent
Defense," Mr. Kepler was care
ful to distinguish between "non
resistance" and "active but non
violent resistance" to aggression.
They suggest that under some
conditions there might be a need
for such means as strikes, dis
orienting gases, and an interna
tional policing system to strength
en a system of peace through
world law.

• Viet Debate Origins
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to point out an
error in fact which appeared in
the May 7 article entitled "Stu
dent, Faculty Hold Vietnam De
bate Today. The Student-Facu
lty Committee for an Open For
um was not organized by mem
bers (if the V.D..C. and members
of the Peace Caucus.
Although both organizations
were represented on the Forum
Committee, it was initially orga
nized by a group of faculty mem
bers which met on Thursday,
April 29, at. 821 Santa Fe.
The April 29 meeting was called
by a group of professors who had
invited the entire faculty to par
ticipate in the planning of a Stan
ford Teach-in. At that time is

was decided that an open debate
of the issues preceding the Teach-
In was a worthwhile project.
As a result of this decision an
autonomous group representing
all points of view was formu
lated (i.e. The Open Forum Com
i mittee). The main body of the
j initial faculty group is concen
i trating its efforts on the May 17,
Stanford Vietnam Day.

• Sailing Boats Gone
Editor, The Daily:
The sailing club ruling junta
has gone too far ... 30 miles too
far. All the sail boats have been
moved t?o Vasona Reservoir in
San Jose for the convenience of
everybody. I understand that a big
reason for the move is that boats
need a lot of work on them. That
will be easier now that they are
closer. I suppose that Lake Lag
was getting too much water in it
to be able to sail.
The move was kept pretty quiet
to obtain popular support. Well,
I hope the wheels have fun in
their private little club.

• Parking Fee
Editor, The Daily:
In his article on parking in
Thursday's Daily, the author says
that "it is also doubtful that . . .
yearly parking fee will have to be
resorted to." If the $10 1 paid last
j September for a sticker permit
ting me to park on campus wasn't
la parking fee, what was it?

• 'Contempt' Defended
Editor, The Daily:
In his adversely critical review
I of Contempt, Mr. John Thayer rec
ognizes several levels of symbo
lism in the film and the fact that
Brigitte Bardot opens her mouth
and not her dress. Apparently he
disapproves of both. Far be it for
me to alter Mr. Thayer's condi
tioning in respect to Miss Bardot,
a conditioning shared by most
American middle-brow a d o 1 e s
cents. As for symbolism, I per
sonally approve of it. I should hate
j to sacrifice so much of the mod
ern theater (Giraudox, Coctez,
! Anouilh, Sartre, etc.> which ex
ploits the heritage of Classical
Greece.
Mr. Thayer fails to recognize
the following:
(1) The theme of alienation in
I marriage. The issue between hus
band and wife in Contempt, is not
one of presumed infidelity or
j jealousy. It concerns the con
tempt, the nausea, the total lack
i of communication that can arise
j quite suddenly between two in
j dividuals who, up to then, love
each other very much.
(2) The element ol' humor. The
confrontation between husband
j and wife is delightfully comic, a
parody on all such confrontations
i in New Wave films. One of Miss
Bardot's great contributions is her
mastery of the comic retort, the
contemptuous gesture, the m»ue
of reproach.
(3) The theme of alienation in
society. The husband is in spiri
tual not physical exile because of
his association with the film pro
ducer. His struggle to find him
self, to bo authentic in an unau
thentic world, provides the chief
parallelism (and antithesis) with
the story of Odysseus.
(4) The total esthetic effect.
George Delerue's score and the
I panoramic shot s of the Capri area

provide a visual and auditive syn
thesis by not means inferior to
that of Last Year in Marienbad.
Stendhal wrote his novels "for
the happy few." I suspect Jean-
Luc Godard had some such idea
in mind filming his masterpiece
Contempt. He evidently did not
have in mind the Stanford Daily
reviewer.

•IN ticlear War Games
Editor, The Daily:
Whoever is responsible for the
" 'Nuclear War* is inevitable" ad
next to the"Letters" section of
the May 5 Daily is, in my opinion,
guilty of tragically poor taste, to
say the least.
If there actually is a Nuclear
War Games Company, as the ad
implies, I'm curious as to why no
address is given. (Incidentally, do
you have any criteria of accept
ability for advertising matter?)
The presence of such an ad
arouses my suspicions regarding
the sanity of those responsible for
its appearance.

• Hole of Religion
Editor, The Stanford Daily:
In the debate on Vietnam
among four professors during the
lunch hour last Friday, the sig
nificance of one professor's posi
tion was somewhat symbolic. The
moderator of the program was
Robert McAfee Brown, one of the
better known Christian theolo
gians in the country. Whatever
Dr. Brown's personal feelings may
have been regarding the United
States' policy in Vietnam, we did
not learn.
This was necessarily due to his
role as a moderator, an intermed
iary. However, his position did
call to mind a situation which
exists in our country today: the
Christian churches, silent, reluc
tant to alienate their members,
caught in the middle of a contro
versy.
With the notable exception of
the Society of Friends, the ina
bility of the churches today to
take a stand on issues both for
eign or domestic arises from age
old and unavoidable problems of
defining church - state relation
ships. And. being human institu
tions, the churches find widely
divergent attitudes within them
selves.
Admitting these difficulties and
hindrances to formulating a posi
tion on any particular issue, we
still think it relevant to pose this
question which Friday's debate
made poignant to us: do the
churches remain a voice of so
ciety, reflecting the morals and
values of a culture or a particular
segment of it; or, do they consti
tute a creative force, recognizing
the need for and initiating change
regardless of pressures from the
status quo and business ethics?
The churches were for years
absent in the civil right struggle;
will Ihey desist from any state
ment or united stand and action
on a specific issue such as Airier
ican policy in Vietnam? Will the
churches remain divided, equivo
cating, stymied, and accused by
what C. Wright Mills calls ". . .
a general lack of effective opposi
tion, of participation in the fact
of moral insensibility . . . ," fail
ing to use . . religious imagina
tion to envision another kind of
basis for policies governing how
men should treat one another?"
