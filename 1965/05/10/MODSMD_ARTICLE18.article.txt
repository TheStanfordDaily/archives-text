## The 						Causes of Student Unrest 
### BILL MOORE (Second in a Series 
Current student protest, like a
vast panopoly, covers two broad
areas.
The first is an appeal for basic
civil liberties on tiie campus, the
same as those guaranteed to any
citizen under the Constitution.
The second is resentment toward
the multiversity, or factory con
cept of education.
As FSM spokesman Mario Savin
told Life a few months ago, "the
issue of tho multiversity and the
issue of free speech can't lie sep
arated. There is a need for the
students to express their resent
ment . . . against having to sub
mit to tho administration's arbi
trary exercise of power."
It was such an "arbitrary ex
ercise of power" that touched off
the storm last fall. For 30 years
political fund raising, recruit
ment of volunteers and campaign
ing had l)ecn prohibited on the
Berkeley campus. The university
had, however, permitted students
to pursue such activity on a 26
foot strip just outside Sat her
Gate. Until, that is, September 14,
1964. At that time—ten days after
students had been recruited there
to picket William F. Knowland's
Oakland Tribune - the Berkeley
dean of students banned politick
ing on the strip. So began tho
tempest. And for the next throe
months the fundamental issue be
tween administration and stu
dents was the right to unfettered
political activity at Berkeley.
Free Speech Issue
Clearly it was a free speech is
sue. Tho right to solicit funds
and recruit volunteers can cer
tainly be inferred from the first
amendment of the Constitution.
And one would think that a uni
versity, that supposed bastion of
liberty, would be willing to honor
such in its own bailiwick.
Fortunately, Stanford last May
explicated a policy which would
permit demonstrations and re
lated activities on assigned sec
tions of the campus. But Stanford
is not. exempt from certain heavy
strains of Berkeley-fashioned pro
vincialism. Two years ago the
Board of Trustees decreed that
the student legislature could not
deal with "off-campus" issues.
And this raises a prickly question:
How can a university differentiate
between on- and off-campus is
sues? The university, after all, is
supposed to bo a cosmopolitan
center. If a university is worth its
name, its concern and its province
should be the world.
The trustees, under pressure
from a particularly adament stu

dent body president, did grant one
concession in 1963: Voluntary po
litical groups would be allowed
for the first time on campus, with
| the right to take stands. But
those groups were then required
to register their constitutions,
their membership lists, their of
ficer lists and their annual re
ports. It was readily apparent to
even the most myopic that, like
the sword of Damocles, the threat
of censorship hung constantly
overhead.
Judicial Rights
Another major issue has been
the denial of fundamental ju
dicial rights to students. The prob
lem was underscored at Stanford
last year when an undergraduate
l named Frank Morse was suspend
ed without a written statement of
I charges, a fair hearing or fair
i appeal procedures. Morse had
i been accused of knocking in a
! door panel at the Florence cam
pus. The student judicial council
there had recommended he be
sentenced to five Corp Yard hours.
He was informed of his suspen
sion only after he returned to
Stanford. In making the decision,
the administration had not con
sulted Men's Council on the home
campus—bypassing normal chan
nels. At first the dean of students
intimated that Morse was being
suspended for psychological rea
! sons. Morse then proceeded to
| get a clean bill of fare from two
pyschiatrists, and the dean drop
ped that approach. Morse still did
not know, nor was he ever to
find out, exactly why he had been
suspended. Two other students at
Florence had also punched out
door panels on the same day of
Morse's caper, but they were not
suspended. To add to the confu
sion, the dean had said that the
Florence faculty review board had
been unanimous in recommending
that Morse be suspended, but one
member vehemently denied this
later.
And so a student — someone
who had put in several years of
hard work, as well as money- was
to have his record tarnished with
out any recourse to fair judicial
procedure. The trustees' position
has heen that "attendance at the
university is a privilege and not
a right." But justice would be far
better served if this were changed
to state that entrance is a priv
ilege and that once matriculated
a student should have certain
rights. He is making a consider
able investment, an investment
that should bo protected from
capricious and arbitrary acts.
'In Loco Parentis'
In recent years the university's
in loco parentis doctrine has also
come under heavy fire. In the past
several months there has been a
strong movement to liberalize
women's social regulations. (For
tunately, the university recently
decided to put some of the pro
posed reforms into effect.) And
resentment has been mounting
over Stanford's handling of sex
cases, especially since it has been
brought to light that a number of
students have been expelled for
having relationships off campus.
When similar rumblings were
heard about in loco parentis at

Harvard a year and a half ago, i
John Kenneth Galbraith made!
scathing reference to that kind
of institution that has "to as
sure parents (hat their more re
tarded offspring would have the
supervision of men of the scout
master type who, however inef
fectually, would try to protect
them from the natural penalties
of indulgence, alcohol or lust." j
Good universities, he argued, had ]
more important things to concern j
themselves with.
Tomorrow: Resentment against
the multiversity.
