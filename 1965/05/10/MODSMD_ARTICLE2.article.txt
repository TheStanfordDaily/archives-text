## Indian Relay Team Sets World Record 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's 440-yard relay team smashed the world record with a
time of 39.7 seconds Saturday at the Fresno Relays, in a race that
Stanford track coach Payton Jordan called "one of the greatest
athletic eflorts in Stanford history.
The team broke the old record of 39.9, set last year by an

Australian national team. It was
the first time in recent years that
a team from one college had held
the world record.
Larry Questad, who anchored
the record run, also came from
behind to win the 100-yard dash
in a sparkling 9.3 seconds. Some
of the timers clocked him in 9.2.
The 44() team, composed of Eric
Frische, Dale Rubin, Bob Mcln
tyre, and Questad, had previously
run under 41 seconds only twice,
with a best of 40.8. According to
Jordan, a "sensational" pass from
Frische to Rubin gave Stanford
a chance ai the record, then
Questad poured it on at the finish
to beat a San Jose State team by
four yards.
Compares Questad To Hayes
Jordan compared Questad's
final relay leg to the one world
record holder Bob Hayes made at
the 1964 Olympics for the victor
ious U.S. team. "I've never seen
any two men run faster at the end
of a race. Both men are sim
ilarly built, big and muscular.
Larry ran a tremendous final
leg."
