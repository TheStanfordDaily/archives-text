# QUESTAD SUPERB
## Indian Relay Team Sets World Record 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's 440-yard relay team smashed the world record with a
time of 39.7 seconds Saturday at the Fresno Relays, in a race that
Stanford track coach Payton Jordan called "one of the greatest
athletic eflorts in Stanford history.
The team broke the old record of 39.9, set last year by an

Australian national team. It was
the first time in recent years that
a team from one college had held
the world record.
Larry Questad, who anchored
the record run, also came from
behind to win the 100-yard dash
in a sparkling 9.3 seconds. Some
of the timers clocked him in 9.2.
The 44() team, composed of Eric
Frische, Dale Rubin, Bob Mcln
tyre, and Questad, had previously
run under 41 seconds only twice,
with a best of 40.8. According to
Jordan, a "sensational" pass from
Frische to Rubin gave Stanford
a chance ai the record, then
Questad poured it on at the finish
to beat a San Jose State team by
four yards.
Compares Questad To Hayes
Jordan compared Questad's
final relay leg to the one world
record holder Bob Hayes made at
the 1964 Olympics for the victor
ious U.S. team. "I've never seen
any two men run faster at the end
of a race. Both men are sim
ilarly built, big and muscular.
Larry ran a tremendous final
leg."
Stanford finished sixth in the
j relay meet, with 22 points. Brig
ham Young won it with 32, and
i USC and San Jose were second
with 31 apiece.
The Tribe might have won the
j meet, but for one mishap and de
! cisions to hold out slightly ailing
runners from some events. A
dropped baton pass from Rubin
to Ken Fraser in the 880 relay
eliminated Stanford, after the
team was running third by half a
yard. Jordan pulled the two-mile
relay team out because anchor
man Paul Schlicke had a cold,
and hold out hurdler and broad
jumper Bud Walsh because of a
muscle spasm in his back.
B<'st -Ever Performances
Otherwise, Stanford athletes
came through with several best
ever performances. Bruce Wil
helm tossed the shot 56-B*2, his
best, but failed to place. Tyler Wil-

I kins flipped the discus 169-11 and
J Mickey Wood hit 160-9, both best
| oflife efforts, but they also failed
to place. Bob Stoecker threw 181-6
for third place in the discus.
The distance medley team of
I Fraser, Dave Deubner, Harlan
Andrews, and Schlicke ran 9:44.6,
[ and were edged by Oregon for
j third place. UCLA sot an Amer-
I ican record of 9:33.9 in that race.
Stanford's freshman 440 team
set a school record with a fast
41.6 clocking. Andy Sears, Russ
! Taplin, Dell Martin, and Roger
| Cox composed the team, which
placed second to UCLA's frosh.
Ward Runs 47.8
Freshman Jim Ward ran the
i last lap of the frosh mile relay
in a blazing 47.3 to overhaul a San
! Jose runner and win the race for
' Stanford in 3:17.6. Taplin, Sears,
! and Cox ran the first three laps.
Frosh high jumper Ed Hanks
' cleared 6-6 and tied for third.
The world record performance
was particularly amazing, since
national teams, composed of col
lege and post-graduate stars, have
dominated relay records for years.
For four top sprinters to be found
at one school is quite rare. The
I 39.7 time averages out to about
9.9 seconds per man for each 110-
yard leg. The world record for 110
•yards (100 meters> is 10 seconds
flat.

Stanford's 440-yard relay team smashed the world record with a
time of 39.7 seconds Saturday at the Fresno Relays, in a race that
Stanford track coach Payton Jordan called "one of the greatest
athletic eflorts in Stanford history.
The team broke the old record of 39.9, set last year by an

Australian national team. It was
the first time in recent years that
a team from one college had held
the world record.
Larry Questad, who anchored
the record run, also came from
behind to win the 100-yard dash
in a sparkling 9.3 seconds. Some
of the timers clocked him in 9.2.
The 44() team, composed of Eric
Frische, Dale Rubin, Bob Mcln
tyre, and Questad, had previously
run under 41 seconds only twice,
with a best of 40.8. According to
Jordan, a "sensational" pass from
Frische to Rubin gave Stanford
a chance ai the record, then
Questad poured it on at the finish
to beat a San Jose State team by
four yards.
Compares Questad To Hayes
Jordan compared Questad's
final relay leg to the one world
record holder Bob Hayes made at
the 1964 Olympics for the victor
ious U.S. team. "I've never seen
any two men run faster at the end
of a race. Both men are sim
ilarly built, big and muscular.

leg."
