# US Policy In Vietnam Challenged
## 
### BILL WERTZ 
More than 1000 people crowded
I into White Memorial Plaza Fri
, day to hear Stanford professors
: debate current U.S. policy in Viet
nam.
Professor Gordon Craig of the
history department and Profes
sor Almond, head of the
political science department and
director of the Stanford Insti
tute for Political Studies, defended
the administration's position.
Almond said that U.S. policy in
Vietnam must be considered in a
; broader context of time. "Com
munist China must be persuaded,"
he said, "that its overt, explicit
policy of sponsoring wars of na
tional liberation can no longer
be tolerated."
Dangers of Weakness
| Almond warned that a weak
i U.S. stand or withdrawal from
| Vietnam would encourage gue
! rilla wars in Asia, Africa and
Latin America and would inten
sify those already in progress.
Criticism of U.S. policy came
from Professor Leopold Haimson,
professor of political theory at
Harvard and now at Stanford's
Center for Advanced Study in the
I Behavioral Sciences, and from As
sociate Professor Christian Bay
of the Stanford Institute for the
Study of Human problems.
According to Bay, the U.S.
j should abide by the 1954 Geneva
i agreement, and accept neutrally-
I supervised free elections in Viet
; nam no matter what the outcome.
'Desperate Act'
Bay called U.S. bombing of
Viet Cong supply lines a "desper
ate act," Bay said U.S. negotia
tions in Vietnam amounted to dic
tation. "This is the first time in
history that a great power has
' used bombing to bring about tie-
I gotiation," he said.
