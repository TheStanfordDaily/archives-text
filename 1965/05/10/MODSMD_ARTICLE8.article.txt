# Sailors Flee Lag

### MARSHA COOK 
The beautiful white sail
boats drifting: across Lake
Lag are there no more. Weeds
have driven them to other
shores, and now the Sailing*
Club has a new location 25
miles away.
Several scientists and 45b
club members admit defeat
by the annual apjiearance of
the "bastard weeds," as they
are termed by the club seere -
ta ry.
It all began when the weeds
popped up along the shore
line of the lake. President
Bruce Wright foresaw trouble
and began looking for a solu
tion.
An ex|>ert at the Univer
sity of California at Davis
specializing in killing weeds
and aquatic plants was called
in 011 the vase.
But, to everyone's dismay,
the Davis man rejMvrted that
the weeds were extremely
hardy, and that two years of
direct potent poisoning might
kill 90 per cent (the lake
would have to be empty).
The first Stanford profes
sor consulted couldn't even
identify the weed. The. second
became very upset at th e
thought of poison in the lake,
for it seems a rare and valu
able fern grows only — in all
of the Northern Hemisphere
—in Lake Lagunita.
It was either the weeds or
the boats, because the weeds
made it impossible to steer
and sometimes halted for
ward progress completely.
Lake Vasona on the Santa
Cruz .Freeway near San Jose
is the new home of the Sail
ing Club. It is twice as large
as Lake Lag and can be used
year-round.
All that is left is a sea of
green, where students can go
canoeing or swimming in the
clear, fresh water.
