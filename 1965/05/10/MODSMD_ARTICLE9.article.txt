# LASSU To Face Off-Campus Issue
## 
### 
The Legislature, its ranks trimmed by sixteen, will meet tonight
in special session to decide on final submission of the off-campus
question to the Associated Students.
The meeting will be held at 8:00 in Room 320.
Key item on the agenda is a block of three proposals, the result
of yesterday's Rules Commit loot

hearing. Tho three will ho voted
on by LASSU as a group, and, if
approved, will he submitted to an
all-campus plehiscito where they
will he presented individually.
According to Speaker Ed Shaw,
one of the Rules Committee's
three members, the proposals rep
sent a petition submitted to
LASSU recommending that stu
dent government refrain from ox
pressing an opinion on off-cam
pus matters, another rocommon-!
dation advocating exactly tho op
posite, and a compromise worked j
out by the executive branch.
The petition, drafted by El Toro
representative Jim Greenley, was
submitted to ASSU President
Scott Mcßride with more than
1,200 signatures April 22.
As Proposal 1. it states that the
ASSU government (including
both executive and Legislature)
shall not take stands on matters
"other than those pertaining to i
student affairs on the Stanford I
campus."
Regardless of Passage
Shaw emphasized that this pro-!
posal will he submitted to the)
students, under the ASSU Consti-1
tution, regardless of its passage j
tonight. "If we fail to get a quor
um again, or the proposals are!
voted down, the original petition
will be the only one on the bal
lot," he said.
"This meeting is the Legisla-i
ture's opportunity to come up
with alternatives to the petition," |
the Speaker declared.
One alternative "at the opposite |
pole," as Shaw put it. is Propo
sal 3, that student government
may express "its consensus on
any issue which is of deep con
cern to the tudent body."
Issues of Deep Concern
The most moderate of the three .
proposals would empower LASSU i
alone to express positions on off
campus issues "of deep concern j
to the student body and within :
tho knowledge and competence of;
the Legislature."
The "knowledge, and compe
tence" clause, Shaw explained,

would preclude official stands on
issues such as Vietnam, "or any
other area in which the Legisla
ture cannot possibly bo compe
tent."
Under the proposal, a two-thirds
vote of the members present,
after a week's advance notice to
consult with their constituencies,
would lie required for any expres
sion of Legislative opinion.
All-Campus Vote
In addition, a petition for a Uni
versity plebiscite on each off-cam
pus issue dealt with by Legisla
furc would be made available in
White Memorial Plaza for two
days. Signature by 10 per cent of
the Associated Students wou Id
negate LASSU action as "not . . .
reflecting the views of tho stu
dent body" and submit the issue
to an all-campus vote.
Shaw also expects a fourth pro
posal, rejected by Rules Commit
tee but supported by LASSU's
Committee of Five, Greenley and
others to he heard tonight in the
form of an amendment. It would
permit a "silenced" LASSU to
submit off-campus issues to a stu
dent vote.
Gieonley, who authored the first
proposal, opined that 'factional
rivalries" may have caused th o
omission of the fourth alternative
from the Rules Committee report,
and expressed the hope that
LASSU would vote to include it
on the ballot.
Block Proposals
If the block of proposals is ac
cepted tonight, a student referen
dum will be held next week. Vot
ers may accept or reject any or
all of the proposals on the ballot.
In case more than one proposal
receives a majority of "yes"
votes, the proposal with the high
est plurality will become law.
Quorum will be 68 tonight as
the result of sixteen representa
tives' having missed three con
secutive meetings, disqualifying
them under the ASSU Constitu
tion. Living groups whose rep
resentatives have been disquali
fied must hold new elections (al
though the same members may
re-elected); new off-campus rep
resentatives will bo appointed by
the ASSU president.
Speaker candidates will also be
nominated tonight. Under Rules
Commit toe provisions, nomina
tion speeches( two minutes) and
candidates' addresses (eight min
utes) will not be given until
Thursday, May 20.

though the same members may
re-elected); new off-campus rep
resentatives will bo appointed by
the ASSU president.
Speaker candidates will also be
nominated tonight. Under Rules
Commit toe provisions, nomina
tion speeches( two minutes) and
candidates' addresses (eight min
utes) will not be given until
Thursday, May 20.
The Legislature, its ranks trimmed by sixteen, will meet tonight
in special session to decide on final submission of the off-campus
question to the Associated Students.
The meeting will be held at 8:00 in Room 320.
Key item on the agenda is a block of three proposals, the result
of yesterday's Rules Commit loot

hearing. Tho three will ho voted
on by LASSU as a group, and, if
approved, will he submitted to an
all-campus plehiscito where they
will he presented individually.
According to Speaker Ed Shaw,
one of the Rules Committee's
three members, the proposals rep
sent a petition submitted to
LASSU recommending that stu
dent government refrain from ox
pressing an opinion on off-cam
pus matters, another rocommon-!
dation advocating exactly tho op
posite, and a compromise worked j
out by the executive branch.
The petition, drafted by El Toro
representative Jim Greenley, was
submitted to ASSU President
Scott Mcßride with more than
1,200 signatures April 22.
As Proposal 1. it states that the
ASSU government (including
both executive and Legislature)
shall not take stands on matters
"other than those pertaining to i
student affairs on the Stanford I
campus."
Regardless of Passage
Shaw emphasized that this pro-!
posal will he submitted to the)
students, under the ASSU Consti-1
tution, regardless of its passage j
tonight. "If we fail to get a quor
um again, or the proposals are!
voted down, the original petition
will be the only one on the bal
lot," he said.
"This meeting is the Legisla-i
ture's opportunity to come up
with alternatives to the petition," |
the Speaker declared.
One alternative "at the opposite |
pole," as Shaw put it. is Propo
sal 3, that student government
may express "its consensus on
any issue which is of deep con
cern to the tudent body."
Issues of Deep Concern
The most moderate of the three .
proposals would empower LASSU i
alone to express positions on off
campus issues "of deep concern j
to the student body and within :
tho knowledge and competence of;
the Legislature."
The "knowledge, and compe
tence" clause, Shaw explained,

would preclude official stands on
issues such as Vietnam, "or any
other area in which the Legisla
ture cannot possibly bo compe
tent."
Under the proposal, a two-thirds
vote of the members present,
after a week's advance notice to
consult with their constituencies,
would lie required for any expres
sion of Legislative opinion.
All-Campus Vote
In addition, a petition for a Uni
versity plebiscite on each off-cam
pus issue dealt with by Legisla
furc would be made available in
White Memorial Plaza for two
days. Signature by 10 per cent of
the Associated Students wou Id
negate LASSU action as "not . . .
reflecting the views of tho stu
dent body" and submit the issue
to an all-campus vote.
Shaw also expects a fourth pro
posal, rejected by Rules Commit
tee but supported by LASSU's
Committee of Five, Greenley and
others to he heard tonight in the
form of an amendment. It would
permit a "silenced" LASSU to
submit off-campus issues to a stu
dent vote.
Gieonley, who authored the first
proposal, opined that 'factional
rivalries" may have caused th o
omission of the fourth alternative
from the Rules Committee report,
and expressed the hope that
LASSU would vote to include it
on the ballot.
Block Proposals
If the block of proposals is ac
cepted tonight, a student referen
dum will be held next week. Vot
ers may accept or reject any or
all of the proposals on the ballot.
In case more than one proposal
receives a majority of "yes"
votes, the proposal with the high
est plurality will become law.
Quorum will be 68 tonight as
the result of sixteen representa
tives' having missed three con
secutive meetings, disqualifying
them under the ASSU Constitu
tion. Living groups whose rep
resentatives have been disquali
fied must hold new elections (al
though the same members may
re-elected); new off-campus rep
resentatives will bo appointed by
the ASSU president.

The Legislature, its ranks trimmed by sixteen, will meet tonight
in special session to decide on final submission of the off-campus
question to the Associated Students.
The meeting will be held at 8:00 in Room 320.
Key item on the agenda is a block of three proposals, the result
of yesterday's Rules Commit loot

hearing. Tho three will ho voted
on by LASSU as a group, and, if
approved, will he submitted to an
all-campus plehiscito where they
will he presented individually.
According to Speaker Ed Shaw,
one of the Rules Committee's
three members, the proposals rep
sent a petition submitted to
LASSU recommending that stu
dent government refrain from ox
pressing an opinion on off-cam
pus matters, another rocommon-!
dation advocating exactly tho op
posite, and a compromise worked j
out by the executive branch.
The petition, drafted by El Toro
representative Jim Greenley, was
submitted to ASSU President
Scott Mcßride with more than
1,200 signatures April 22.
As Proposal 1. it states that the
ASSU government (including
both executive and Legislature)
shall not take stands on matters
"other than those pertaining to i
student affairs on the Stanford I
campus."
Regardless of Passage
Shaw emphasized that this pro-!
posal will he submitted to the)
students, under the ASSU Consti-1
tution, regardless of its passage j
tonight. "If we fail to get a quor
um again, or the proposals are!
voted down, the original petition
will be the only one on the bal
lot," he said.
"This meeting is the Legisla-i
ture's opportunity to come up
with alternatives to the petition," |
the Speaker declared.
One alternative "at the opposite |
pole," as Shaw put it. is Propo
sal 3, that student government
may express "its consensus on
any issue which is of deep con
cern to the tudent body."
Issues of Deep Concern
The most moderate of the three .
proposals would empower LASSU i
alone to express positions on off
campus issues "of deep concern j
to the student body and within :
tho knowledge and competence of;
the Legislature."
The "knowledge, and compe
tence" clause, Shaw explained,

would preclude official stands on
issues such as Vietnam, "or any
other area in which the Legisla
ture cannot possibly bo compe
tent."
Under the proposal, a two-thirds
vote of the members present,
after a week's advance notice to
consult with their constituencies,
would lie required for any expres
sion of Legislative opinion.
All-Campus Vote
In addition, a petition for a Uni
versity plebiscite on each off-cam
pus issue dealt with by Legisla
furc would be made available in
White Memorial Plaza for two
days. Signature by 10 per cent of
the Associated Students wou Id
negate LASSU action as "not . . .
reflecting the views of tho stu
dent body" and submit the issue
to an all-campus vote.
Shaw also expects a fourth pro
posal, rejected by Rules Commit
tee but supported by LASSU's
Committee of Five, Greenley and
others to he heard tonight in the
form of an amendment. It would
permit a "silenced" LASSU to
submit off-campus issues to a stu
dent vote.
Gieonley, who authored the first
proposal, opined that 'factional
rivalries" may have caused th o
omission of the fourth alternative
from the Rules Committee report,
and expressed the hope that
LASSU would vote to include it
on the ballot.
Block Proposals
If the block of proposals is ac
cepted tonight, a student referen
dum will be held next week. Vot
ers may accept or reject any or
all of the proposals on the ballot.
In case more than one proposal
receives a majority of "yes"
votes, the proposal with the high
est plurality will become law.
Quorum will be 68 tonight as
the result of sixteen representa
tives' having missed three con
secutive meetings, disqualifying
them under the ASSU Constitu
tion. Living groups whose rep
resentatives have been disquali
fied must hold new elections (al
though the same members may
re-elected); new off-campus rep
resentatives will bo appointed by
the ASSU president.
Speaker candidates will also be
nominated tonight. Under Rules
Commit toe provisions, nomina
tion speeches( two minutes) and
