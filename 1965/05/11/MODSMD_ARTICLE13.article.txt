Potent were the sticks of the
Stanford lacrosse club Saturday
as they defeated the United States
Air Force Academy, 9 5. Together
the entire Indian squad produced
their best effort of the season, ex
panding their season record to 3-4.
The game began with action
that was to continue throughout
ihe contest. With only two min
utes of play gone, Stanford got
off to a quick one point lead on
a goal by Glenn Thomas, a lead
which the Indians never lost.
Thomas scored again in the sec
ond period, but the leading scorer

l for Stanford was Doug Ramsay
| with three points.
Stanford led 5-2 at the end of
i the first halt' on a variety of shots
I by Thomas, Ramsey, Sandy Sax
! ton, and Bob Murphy in the sec
ond quarter.
Air Force Scoreless
The Indians were able to hold
; the Air Force scoreless in the first
1 period of action; however, in the
'second half the Air Force made
!a gallant challenge for the lead.
Air Force's defense, although
| possibly too eager at times, was
i able to hold Stanford to only one
i point in the third period while
| the Cadets' offense flung in three
goals. The score was 6-5 at the
end of the first half.
Stanford's goalie, Mel Ellis, who
1 made innumerable saves through

the third period as the Air Force
scored from several different
{angles on the field.

I straight out on a long shot by
Tom Guekert. Gukert, obtaining
possession of the ball at mid-field,

field for the score. One from the
side and a partially blocked shot
ended the Air Force's scoring as
Stanford controlled the play in
the last quarter.
Pete Eakland scored Stanford's
initial goal in the final period on
an assist from Tuck Peterson
from behind the goal. The Air
Force was unable to get by Stan

from Doug Ramsay and Sandy
Saxton. Ramsay scored on a so
