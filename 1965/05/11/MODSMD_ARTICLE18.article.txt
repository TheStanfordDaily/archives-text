# Alienation in Multiversity
## 
### BILL MOORE (Third in a Series 
Perhaps on the surface it seems
difficult to reconcile student an
tipathy for both in the loco par
entis and the impcrsonalization of
the multiversity. But only on the
surface.
Students are not asking for
someone to hold their hands when
they criticize the great university
bureaucracies, the overabundance
of teaching assistants and the
emphasis on research over teach
ing. On the contrary, such crit
icism reflects a maturity that
merits corresponding considera
tion — and respect - - from uni
versity officialdom.
More than a half century ago
in The Higher Learning; in Ameri
ca Thorstein Veblen warned of
the incompatibility of a d mini s
trators and the concept of the
university — the former, bless
them, with their eternally cau
tious natures and the latter with
its emphasis on free and objec
tive inquiry. Veblen was an
astitue, if not sympathetic, observ
er of administrations. His own
life, part of which was spent at
Stanford .involved many scrapes
with them.
Shocked he would have been if
he had known that 50 years later
they were to have exercised so
much control.
According to Harvard econom
ist Seymour Harris, quoted in the
February 20 New Republic, "What
is especially striking is the large
proportion of the increased costs
(of higher education) to be
charged to non-academic salaries;
though non-academic employees
were only two-thirds as numerous
as faculty members, their pay
rose so much more that they con

tributed one-third more to the in
flation of outlays for institutions
of higher learning."
I'ower Structure
This growth has had a stifling
effect on many faculty members,
who anxious to rise in the insti
tution's power structure—decide
to go along with the "conventional
wisdom" rather than criticize it. A
sad fate usually awaits those who
rock the boat too frequently.
Most campuses, including Stan
ford, have had their cases of con
troversial professors who, strange
ly, never got tenure.
Those who insist that the top
heavy structures of universities
are necessary need only look at
European universities. Which
have managed very well, thank
you, without them—and without,
for that matter, even presidents.
It was Veblen again who 50
years ago noted a trend that to
day is closely coupled with uni
versity bureaucracy — "conspicu
ous consumption" in aeademia,
too much expenditure on the edu
cationally irrelevant. Many Stan
ford students, for instance, have
been highly critical of what they
consider unnecessary building
projects on campus (e.g., a fancy
bowling alley, a plush student
publications building, $1,000
kiosks scattered around for the
sole purpose of hanging posters).
TA Problem
This money could be put to
much better use by hiring reg
ular faculty members, who could,
among other things, ease the load
now placed on teaching assistants.
There are 260 TA's at Stanford.
Although most schools have many
more, this number is still too
high. And although most TA's
are conscientious, their first re
sponsibility is to their doctorates.
In the majority of cases, they can
not devote the time necessary to

do a good teaching job, nor do
they have the breadth of experi
ence necessary.
Another deep-seated, and justi
fied, student grievance is the em
phasis on faculty research and
the de-emphasis on faculty teach
ing at many American campuses
and again Stanford is no excep
tion. "Publish or perish" evokes a
near Pavlovian response, usually
a snarl, in student circles. Too
many professors are simply too
inaccessible to their pupils.
It is true that at Stanford most
professors make an effort to hold
office hours, but the classroom it
self usually plays second fiddle to
the •professor's research. In the
sciences, much of this can be at
tributed to the staggering sums
of government money bei n g
pumped into defense research.
(Fifty per cent of Berkeley's and
about 10 per cent of Stanford's an
nual budgets now come from the
Atomic Energy Commission
alone.)
Tomorrow: "What motivates
the student critics?
