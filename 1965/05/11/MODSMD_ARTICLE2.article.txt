• Dominican Military Leader Steps Down
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic—Brig. Gen. Elias Wesson
y Wessin, whose planes and tanks beat off rebels in the bloody first
days of the Dominican revolt, resigned from the armed forces yester
day under reported U.S. pressure. His retirement appears to have
removed a major obstacle toward settling the crisis.
Holed up in a maze of crowded apartment houses and business
buildings, the rebels showed no tendency yesterday to capitulate to
a tank and howitzer-backed force of U.S. and Dominican troops
surrounding them.
Scoffing at an invitation to quit the revolt, Camaano's insurgents
appeared to be organizing their stronghold in Ciudad Neuva, a low
income residential and business section in southeast Santo Domingo.

STATE AND LOCAL
• Senate Approves Reapportionment I*lan
SACRAMENTO- California's State Senate reluctantly passed a
historic reapportionment bill yesterday that would wrest control of
the upper house from rural areas and place it in the hands of urban
residents.
The 21 to 13 vote three more than the bare 21 votes required for a
majority moved the measure to the Assembly where it faces
an uncertain fate.
Thus, after five months of often anguished debate, the upper house
of legislature of the nation's most populous state obeyed a federal'
court order to adopt a redisr icting plan by July 1.
For the bill by Sen. Stephen P. Teale, a Democrat from the sparsely
settled mountain hamlet of West Point in Calaveras County, to be
come effective, the Assembly and Senate would have to agree to the
same version, Gov. Brown would have to sign it and the courts
would have to assent.

ment of Colored People, supported by the Harris County Council of

• Senate Approves Reapportionment I*lan
SACRAMENTO- California's State Senate reluctantly passed a
historic reapportionment bill yesterday that would wrest control of
the upper house from rural areas and place it in the hands of urban
residents.
The 21 to 13 vote three more than the bare 21 votes required for a
majority moved the measure to the Assembly where it faces
an uncertain fate.
Thus, after five months of often anguished debate, the upper house
of legislature of the nation's most populous state obeyed a federal'
court order to adopt a redisr icting plan by July 1.
For the bill by Sen. Stephen P. Teale, a Democrat from the sparsely
settled mountain hamlet of West Point in Calaveras County, to be
come effective, the Assembly and Senate would have to agree to the
same version, Gov. Brown would have to sign it and the courts
would have to assent.

• Dominican Military Leader Steps Down
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic—Brig. Gen. Elias Wesson
y Wessin, whose planes and tanks beat off rebels in the bloody first
days of the Dominican revolt, resigned from the armed forces yester
day under reported U.S. pressure. His retirement appears to have
removed a major obstacle toward settling the crisis.
Holed up in a maze of crowded apartment houses and business
buildings, the rebels showed no tendency yesterday to capitulate to
a tank and howitzer-backed force of U.S. and Dominican troops
surrounding them.
Scoffing at an invitation to quit the revolt, Camaano's insurgents
appeared to be organizing their stronghold in Ciudad Neuva, a low
income residential and business section in southeast Santo Domingo.
