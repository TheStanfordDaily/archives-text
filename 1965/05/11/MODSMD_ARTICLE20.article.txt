# LASS 'Procrastinating' On Off-Campus Question
## 
### JOHN E. BONINE (First of 2 Articles 
signatures, but ii did its best to*
delay the issue and to confuse it.
(Conceded, however, that some of
the delay is due to the normal!
functioning of the body.)
The actions and speeches in •
LASSU bear little resemblance to
most published accounts of them,
such as the article last Thursday
about the original actions by
LASSU:
"The Legislature decided it J
wanted the student body to;
make this decision instead of
the Board of Trustees and asked
to have the ban [on off-campus
stands | removed."
What lically Happened . . .
What really happened is that j
the GCC-activist elements in the.
Legislature wanted to speak in
tiie name of the student body on
such issues as boycotting Stick
ney's and getting out of Vietnam.
Thus they started to work at
getting the current ban removed.
Only the outside action of the
initiative petition forced the issue
to a vote of tlie entire student
body, something which the activ
ists had no desire to see happen.
The Palo Alto Times had the
most complete story on the |
LASSU meeting two weeks ago I
but the minutes of that meeting j
are even more enlightening.
After Scott McBride presented
the petition with its 1137 signa
tures and moved that it be placed
on the ballot, Rob Sangster and I
GCCer Jay Kadane (candidate for I
LASSU Speaker) suggested that j
other proposals be placed on the
ballot with it, and that By Laws
Committee be charged with look
ing for some.
Against Student Wishes
An unidentified representative
challenged the motives of sending
the petition to By Laws:
"It seems to me that a large
part, 10 per cent, of the student
body feels pretty strongly about;
this. Sending it to By Laws
seems to be against the student
body's wishes."
Ed Shaw (also a candidate for
Speaker again), without yielding:
the gavel, took off on an eloquent
and revealing defense of the side-j
tracking move:
"The circulation of this peti-!
tion, in the Chair's opinion, in;
some manner circumvents ihe

Like a well-oiled piston, Rob
Sangster bounced back up and
urged that everything be scuttled

were worried lest the matter give
the ASSU election its first real

signatures, but ii did its best to*
delay the issue and to confuse it.
(Conceded, however, that some of
the delay is due to the normal!
functioning of the body.)
The actions and speeches in •
LASSU bear little resemblance to
most published accounts of them,
such as the article last Thursday
about the original actions by
LASSU:
"The Legislature decided it J
wanted the student body to;
make this decision instead of
the Board of Trustees and asked
to have the ban [on off-campus
stands | removed."
What lically Happened . . .
What really happened is that j
the GCC-activist elements in the.
Legislature wanted to speak in
tiie name of the student body on
such issues as boycotting Stick
ney's and getting out of Vietnam.
Thus they started to work at
getting the current ban removed.
Only the outside action of the
initiative petition forced the issue
to a vote of tlie entire student
body, something which the activ
ists had no desire to see happen.
The Palo Alto Times had the
most complete story on the |
LASSU meeting two weeks ago I
but the minutes of that meeting j
are even more enlightening.
After Scott McBride presented
the petition with its 1137 signa
tures and moved that it be placed
on the ballot, Rob Sangster and I
GCCer Jay Kadane (candidate for I
LASSU Speaker) suggested that j
other proposals be placed on the
ballot with it, and that By Laws
Committee be charged with look
ing for some.
Against Student Wishes
An unidentified representative
challenged the motives of sending
the petition to By Laws:
"It seems to me that a large
part, 10 per cent, of the student
body feels pretty strongly about;
this. Sending it to By Laws
seems to be against the student
body's wishes."
Ed Shaw (also a candidate for
Speaker again), without yielding:
the gavel, took off on an eloquent
and revealing defense of the side-j
tracking move:
"The circulation of this peti-!
tion, in the Chair's opinion, in;
some manner circumvents ihe
purpose of this body. No at
tempt was made by any lcgis-
I lator to have the Legislature

LASSU lias squirmed and procrastinated; tiually it has put be
fore the student body the question of its power to speak for the
students on off-campus issues.
The Legislature had 110 choice because oi the initiative petition
