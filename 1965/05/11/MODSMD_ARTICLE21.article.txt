## Bay, Craig Assailed for Viet Nam Speeches 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Last fall it was my privilege to j
endorse Sen. Thomas Dodd's can- j
didacy for re-election to the U.S. j
Senate. As a Republican I en-;
dorsed a Democrat because ot his;
impressive record as one of the!
country's most foresighted ex
perts in international relations."
I was, therefore, greatly
shocked when in a public debate
on U.S. Viet Nam policy. Mr.
Christian Bay, on May 7, 1965, in
Cubberley Hall, twice treated the!
Senator as "paranoid." There was
no doubt in my mind that the
epithet really was addressed to
the President of the United States.

Since the times of Aristotle,
I name calling has had no place in
| logic. It surely has no place in a
' debate between scholars. More
over, defamation is a totalitarian,
not a democratic technique. A
1 member of the academic commun
ity who, without reason and with
out proof, alleges that a meritori
ous public servant is mentally
sick, sets a bad example to stu
dents and shows lack of manners
and tact. Scholars arc expected to
! be gentlemen.
Mr. Bay's remarks were flowing
over with moral indignation. Since
smear tactics are immoral. I find
it difficult to believe that Mr.

i Bay is a qualified judge of
morality.
Just like charity should start at
home, the morality of those aca
demics who would criticize the
ethics of U.S. foreign policy
should start on the campus.

â€¢ Craig Questioned
Editor, The Daily:
Professor Craig on Friday in
I White Memorial Plaza stated
j quite l ightly that we must not
I become "lost in history." But
I neither should we wander too far

from it. In this respect I found
much of his analysis misleading.
For example:
First, the Truman Doctrine
and the Marshall Plan did not stop
the guerrillas in Greece. As prof
fessor R. L. Wolff has written
the crucial factors were the purg
ing of the guerrilla leaders and
the closing of the borders by Tito.
The analogy to Viet Nam is
i strained.
Second, the Truman Doctrine I
did not contain Communism in
areas where circumstances made
this doctrine inapplicable. Thus in
China neither guns nor money
could prop up Chiang Kai-shek.
Asian problems are not solved by
European answers.
Third, aid in the manner of the
Marshall Plan will not save us in
Southeast Asia. The Marshall
Plan was designed to "assist in
Ihc return of normal economic
health" in well organized societies
whose traditions, economies, and
politics were basically harmoni
ous with our own. In Asia mere
"reconstruction" and limited as
sistance is not enough. An infi
nitely more massive and sophisti
cated program must be developed
if we are to provide the rudi

. ments of stability in even the
I "safe" areas. Years of negligence
j are not so easily redeemed.
Fourth, we cannot simply
"draw a line" and declare the
Vietcong "contained" as profes
, sor Craig suggests. We find our
\ selves fighting a people who be
lieve lliey are only re-uniting a
country which was unfairly trun
cated by a French pupet re
gime in Cochin China and again
I after the failure of the 19.34
| Geneva accords calling for the
j unification of the nation. Further
more in the military sense it is
| pointless to construct a Hadrian's
wall when the barbarians are al
; ready on both sides.
The cost in Southeast Asia is
j going to be great, but we will not
i gain any "repute" by sticking
! fingers in dykes after the dykes
| have burst. The real question is
how we are going to aequite our
! selves with honor, and what steps
are we going to take to prevent
j repeat performances in Asia, La
tin America and Africa. Rather
that losing ourselves in Ihe his
j tory of the Marshall Plan we
I should begin to look at the prob
lems in Asia -now.
