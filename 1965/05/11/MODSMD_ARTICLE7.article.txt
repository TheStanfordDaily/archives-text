# Beye Hits Success Impulse

### TERRY COXON 
"The prospects for thehumani
ties are grim," declared Charles
Beye, ebullient professor of
classics, last night in the Tresid
der large lounge. He spoke on "A
Last Chance for the Humanities."
The reason humanities are be
ing discarded, he explained, is that
"the university has been seduced
by the success-oriented society.
The university today is interested
in producing a product, in show
ing visible results.
"Its goal is the government
grant and the corporation con
tract. It acts as though it were it
self a corporation that had to
report to its stockholders."
The obsession with tangible
success, he stated, results in "the
urgency for graduate school and
the mania for grades." The out
come of this is that "(lie Ameri
can university is hardly a place
for contemplation."
"To promote creativity the grad
ing system must go," Beye de
clared. He suggested that a sys
tem of plus or minus grades, i.e.,
failing or passing, be adopted as a
substitute for the present letter
grades.
Beye cited "the current fad for
overseas campuses" as a stympton
of "the failure of the university
to provide an opportunity for
discovery and intellectual life."
