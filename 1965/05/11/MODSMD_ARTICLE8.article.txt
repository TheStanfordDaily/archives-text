# AFTER THE COMPETENCE BILL
## The 						Judicial Process and the Dean 
### KIRK HANSON 
(Second of Two Articles)
Several changes have been made recently
in the role of deans at Stanford. They have
been the result of a recognition of the basic
conflict between the counseling and disci
plinary functions traditionally given the
deans.
Before the passage of the Judicial Com
petence Bill, cases were handled in one of
two ways: 1 » decisions of the Men's or
Women's Councils were sent as recom
mendations to the President of the Uni
versity in his representative the dean, who
made the final judgment; 2) or the decision
was made by the dean without referral to
the student councils.
Original Jurisdiction
However, with the passage of the bill,
the student councils have original jurisdic
tion and the deans are no longer able to
handle cases entirely by themselves. The
deans can only do this if the student in
volvcd specifically requests it and then the
dean must notify the Men's or Women's
Council that he is dealing with the case.
This part of the Judicial Competence Bill
affecting the role of the deans was but one
segment. Its primary aim affected tin 1 in
tegrity of the student in all areas of the
judicial process.
The President's representative in judicial
matters has remained the dean. However, in
prosecuting the students, the dean now has
the same position as any student, faculty,
01 administration membei Thev ail have

the right tu bring a person before the Men's
or Women's Councils.
Student Integrity Insured
According to LA.SSU Speaker Ed Shaw,
"the dean has been moved as far out of the
judicial process as possible now." However,
ho cited the proposed constitutional amend
ment establishing the Appeals Board as
one more effort to insure the integrity of
the student.
Under the proposed amendment, the stu
dent, the prosecutor, or the administra
tion could appeal the decision of the stu
dent council to an Appeals Board com
posed of students and faculty members.
This board would then make the final rec
ommendation to the President of the Uni
versity.
The President would again be represent
ed by the dean, but both Shaw and Rob
Sangster, one of the authors of the Judicial
Competence Bill agreed that ,in practice,
the dean would never change the decision
of the Appeals Board, because of its faculty
support.
The specialists interviewed for the first
part of this article noted certain considera
tions that must be involved when altering
the function of the deans.
Specialists Note Problems
Dr. James A. Paulsen, Staff Psychiatrist,
opposed complete removal of the deans
from the judicial process. He said "this
seems to be a transfer of power rather
tban an alternation of it."
Dr. Paulsen warned that "Despotism is
not a monopoly of any one group on this
campus. The • tudcnlv can exercise it too."

For the dean he sought a "balanced and
rational power." He said "the deans can eon
tribute something important to the disci
plinary function."
Dr. R. Nevitt San ford, Director of the In
stitute for the Study of Human Problems,
was more explicit in his evaluation of deans
within the judicial process. He saw the
dean's counseling as necessarily involved
with the disciplinary problems.
"The counseling done by the dean is dif
ferent," he said. "Ii requires judgment and
action. He bails many students out of dif
ficult situations." He further elaborated on
this aspect of the dean's counseling and
described it as a sort of "welfare function."
Drills' Importance
He said it would be "quite conceivable"
that the dean might be removed from di
rect enforcement or final judgment on disci
plinary decisions, but that he should noi be
entirely eliminated from the judicial pro
cess. "The dean has to deal with the stu
dent as a whole person," he said.
Dr. Sanford saw the possibility of hav
ing a Warden or some other executive of
ficial carry out the decisions of the judicial
cou mils.
Whether the dean is to be removed from
his position as the President's representa
tive in the judicial process is still to be
seen. Likewise, the fate of the Appeals
Board is still pending.
It appears that no matter what the re
sult of these plans is, the deans at Stanford
will continue to he recognized as the pri
mary agent of counseling and concrete ac
tion for the student in trouble.
