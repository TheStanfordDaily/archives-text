# Sweeney Discovers 'Real job' in South
## 
### NANCY L. STEFFEN Editor (First in a Series 
"1 feel that 1 have a real job now—that I'm not just on sabbatical
leave," Dennis Sweeney explained.
Sweeney is a civil rights worker. A SNCC staff member. A com
munity organizer. And for nearly a year, since lie left Stanford as a
junior, he has been working at his chosen profession in McComb,
Mississippi.
Sweeney's work (developing a freedom school program with
Negro high school children, first in McComb and now in rural Klan*
dominated Amite County) has rarely been glamorous.
It has often been dangerous: since he went south with some forty
Stanford students and faculty last summer to work in the Mississippi
Summer Project, he has been injured once in a bombing and ar
rested more than five times on charges ranging from "criminal
syndicalism" to "trespassing on public property."
"I guess the one thing that keeps me going," he said, "is a kind
of religious faith that people can and do want to make the important
decision affecting their lives. Maybe 1 hat's naive. I don't know."
Naive or not, Sweeney's belief in the possibility of a kind of rein
vigorated, truly "grass roots" democracy is indicative of the new
mood of SNCC and the Mississippi movement.
"One man; One vote" has become increasingly insufficient as a
slogan. "Does voting make a man truly free?" Sweeney asked.
"Clearly, it doesn't," lie answered.
"I don't think that anyone will say that the new voting bill
shouldn't be passed," he continued, "but the movement has deepened
in the last few years. Now it goes into people's feelings about other
people . . . The vote alone is only one step in freeing pople, and it's
no more important than any other step."
For Sweeney, and for many others in SNCC. the traditional system
of American consensus politics (and in particular, the democratic
party) no longer presents itself as a possible means for affecting
the kind of broad social, indeed, psychological, change which has
become SNCC's goal.
"In what sense does the vote help if you can't get people in who
truly represent those who are poor and ignorant and angry?"
Sweeney asked.
"The first thing to do to change the society is to organize the
people who are outside of it the people who are voiceless, who
don't share in the decision-making, who don't share in the abund
ance. What you have to do first, is build a really democratic orga
nization outside the existing society."
Tt is to that end or that beginning -that Sweeney has been work
ing in Mississippi this past year.
"All I'm trying to do is to convince these local people that they are
going to replace me with themselves."

rested more than five times on charges ranging from "criminal
syndicalism" to "trespassing on public property."
"I guess the one thing that keeps me going," he said, "is a kind
of religious faith that people can and do want to make the important
decision affecting their lives. Maybe 1 hat's naive. I don't know."
Naive or not, Sweeney's belief in the possibility of a kind of rein
vigorated, truly "grass roots" democracy is indicative of the new
mood of SNCC and the Mississippi movement.
"One man; One vote" has become increasingly insufficient as a
slogan. "Does voting make a man truly free?" Sweeney asked.
"Clearly, it doesn't," lie answered.
"I don't think that anyone will say that the new voting bill
shouldn't be passed," he continued, "but the movement has deepened
in the last few years. Now it goes into people's feelings about other
people . . . The vote alone is only one step in freeing pople, and it's
no more important than any other step."
For Sweeney, and for many others in SNCC. the traditional system
of American consensus politics (and in particular, the democratic
party) no longer presents itself as a possible means for affecting
the kind of broad social, indeed, psychological, change which has
become SNCC's goal.
"In what sense does the vote help if you can't get people in who
truly represent those who are poor and ignorant and angry?"
Sweeney asked.
"The first thing to do to change the society is to organize the
people who are outside of it the people who are voiceless, who
don't share in the decision-making, who don't share in the abund
ance. What you have to do first, is build a really democratic orga
nization outside the existing society."
Tt is to that end or that beginning -that Sweeney has been work
ing in Mississippi this past year.
"All I'm trying to do is to convince these local people that they are
going to replace me with themselves."
"1 feel that 1 have a real job now—that I'm not just on sabbatical
leave," Dennis Sweeney explained.
Sweeney is a civil rights worker. A SNCC staff member. A com
munity organizer. And for nearly a year, since lie left Stanford as a
junior, he has been working at his chosen profession in McComb,
Mississippi.
Sweeney's work (developing a freedom school program with
Negro high school children, first in McComb and now in rural Klan*
dominated Amite County) has rarely been glamorous.
It has often been dangerous: since he went south with some forty
Stanford students and faculty last summer to work in the Mississippi
Summer Project, he has been injured once in a bombing and ar
rested more than five times on charges ranging from "criminal
syndicalism" to "trespassing on public property."
