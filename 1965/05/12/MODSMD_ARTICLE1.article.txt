# New Pavilion Moves Closer to Ground Breaking
## Construction Awaits Remainder of Funds 
### 
A pavilion long-needed for bas-1
ketball, other indoor sports and
major campus events al Stanford j
moved $1.2 million closer to j-oal- j
ity last week.
The University has earmarked i
this sum for the project from the j
Roscoe W. Maples bequest.
Ground will be broken w hen :
gifts and pledges now being so-j
licited from Stanford alumni and 1
friends assure financing for the
$2.16 million structure.
About $700 thousand is still re- i
quired to build the steel and con- (
crete building seating 6.000. If
II million can be raised, seating
capacity can be increased at the
outset to 8,000. Ultimate expan
sion to this size is provided for
in the architectural design.
South of the Stadium
The new Roscoe W. Maples Pa
vilion will be built off Campus

Drive south of the football sta
dium. It will free the existing 44-
year-old Basketball Pavilion for
such indoor sports as fencing,
wreslling and gymnastics, now
severely cramped for space.
With greater receipts from bas
ketball. Stanford can attract the
top teams in the country, includ
ing those which have heavy costs
in travel from the East Coast and
Midwest, Athletic Director Chuck
Taylor points out, and the new
building will benefit both inter
collegiate and intramural pro
grams.
The Maples Pavilion also will
provide adequate seating for ma
jor cultural events of campus
wide and community appeal. Mem
Aud â€” the largest auditorium,
seating about 1,700 has turned
away as many as 1,500 from lec
tures and other cultural events
featuring outstanding public fig
ures.
Architect John Carl Warnecke
designed the building with end
cantilevered seating sections to
accommodate an additional 2,000
spectators. These were to be
added in a second stage of con
struction.
Roscoe W. Maples
Roscoe W. Maples, the Califor
nia lumberman and philanthro
pist, left the residue of an estate
appraised at $1.7 million to the
University upon his death in San

i Francisco January IT, 1963.
j A Stanford alumnus of the
: class of 1904 and an active sup-
I porter of his alma mater, he im
posed no conditions as to the
j eventual use of- his gift,
i Besides tlie $1.2 million for the
Pavilion, tho bequest ultimately
will endow a professorship and a
scholarship fund. All three will
! be named for the donor.
I Dr. Sterling said that Mrs.
i Maples, who is now living in Palo
t Alto, has assured him she is
| "much pleased" with the decision.
Alumni Sentiment
j Stanford Trustee David Pack
} ard, who heads the University's
j national major gifts committee,
said there is strong alumni senti
ment for achieving the 8,000 seat
ing capacity in a single $2.33 mil
lion construction job. He reported
ja general "feeling of urgency" to
get construction underway,
i About $300 thousand has been
contributed so far by alumni and
! other Stanford friends. A special
I committee for the pavilion has
been at work for some time on
! the project. Nearly 70 volunteer
' members are now serving on it.
Versatility a Keynote
Tennis is one indoor sport that
can be played in the new pavilion.
And when the front bleachers are
; retracted for storage, the big cen
i tral court will convert to three
full-size basketball cross-courts.

Roscoe W. Maples Pavilion. An extra 2,000
seats will be provided by a cantilevered end
section, increasing capacity to 8,000. Team

rooms and public facilities will be under the
bleachers. Spectators will enter on the second
level via stairways above the lower level
rooms.
