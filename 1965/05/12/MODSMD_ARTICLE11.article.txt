# Students Study University Policy
## 
### BOB DAVIS BILL RORABAUGH 
The administration and students held an informal discussion
of University problems last night at the Eating Club "L"—the
result of which turned out to be a learning session for both sides.
In a "Meet the Administrators" program, twelve prominent
i Stanford administrators opened themselves to questions from

the student body.
Robert Gordon, Dean of Men,
speaking informally in Iho El
Campo clu broom insisted that
"there is not a need today for a
special advocate for students.
Every member of the Dean's staff
is called upon to serve in this
capacity."
Taking a general view of the
role the Deans play, Gordon said
that they are "service stations,"
and not administrators.
He remarked that there are few
situations in American univer
sities like Stanford's in which the
Dean's Office is perceived as hav
ing such an extensive discipli
nary role.
He indicated that his office ex
ists for the students in a counsel
ing capacity. "The Dean's offices
should help students get on the
track."
When questioned about the
Fundamental Standard and Uni
versity policy, Gordon remarked
that Stanford probably has "less
specific codification of rules and
regulations than any other simi
lar university in the country."
He said that in discussions like
those at the eating clubs, both
students and administrators are
coming to realize that the values
of today's students are different
from those of yesterday.
Concerning student govern
ments in general, Gordon believes
that the governments haven't
been well integrated with univer
sity communities. "Student gov
ernments should strive for inte
gration with the communities
and not autonomy."
Gordon also expressed sur
prise at the extent of essential
student conservatism among stu
dents on American campuses.
At El Tigre, where Kenneth
Cuthbertson, Vice-President of Fi
nance, and Jack Shepard, Direc
tor of Development, spoke, dis
cussion stemmed from student
questions and criticism concern
ing the university expansion pro
gram.

Cuthbertson forecast ton more
: years of building before ihc pro
grain could near its goals of ade
quate facilities for each univer
i sity department.
According to Cuthbertson, a tui
'1ion increase will help pay for a
! portion of the increased expendi
| ture, and tuition will continue to
j rise "as long as the traffic will
bear."
However, he stated that al
j though Stanford leads the West
; in tuition increases, it is still
j $300 a year behind the prestige
: Eastern schools.
Many of the ideas for the ex
pansion program and university
policy, Cuthbertson commented,
are controlled "in a very real
sense by faculty consensus."
Discussing Stanford problems
i in Los Arcos, Dr. John Black,
| head of the Counseling and Test-
I ing Service, suggested more in-
I dependent study as the answer to
| grade pressures.
Someone noted that only one
| out of six applicants were ac
i cepted for next year's freshman
class. Increased selectivity, stated
Black, means an "increasingly
j homogeneous group for certain
| variables," but "personality dif
! ferences are as broad as ever."
One student termed Stanford a
! "closed community," with a pre-
I scribed pattern of conduct. Black
j acknowledged that more freedom
! to choose "your own way" exists
I elsewhere, and suggested some
j one in t he administration should
I be concerned with student moral
j ethical questions.
"Today, everyone is more so
; phisticated," said Black, "includ
; ing administration and students."
| Some years ago a group of stu-
I dents went to a Dean to protest
! the dismissal of a professor. They
j were told it was "none of their
! business what the administra
' tion does."
Today, administrators are likely
! to take students "more seriously,"
he stated.

When questioned about the
Fundamental Standard and Uni

that Stanford probably has "less

He said that in discussions like
those at the eating clubs, both
students and administrators are
coming to realize that the values
of today's students are different
from those of yesterday.
Concerning student govern
ments in general, Gordon believes
that the governments haven't
been well integrated with univer
sity communities. "Student gov
ernments should strive for inte
gration with the communities
and not autonomy."
Gordon also expressed sur
prise at the extent of essential
student conservatism among stu
dents on American campuses.

Cuthbertson, Vice-President of Fi

According to Cuthbertson, a tui

However, he stated that al

Many of the ideas for the ex

Discussing Stanford problems

Black, means an "increasingly

I scribed pattern of conduct. Black
j acknowledged that more freedom

The administration and students held an informal discussion

In a "Meet the Administrators" program, twelve prominent

the student body.
Robert Gordon, Dean of Men,
speaking informally in Iho El

"there is not a need today for a

Taking a general view of the
role the Deans play, Gordon said
that they are "service stations,"
and not administrators.
He remarked that there are few
