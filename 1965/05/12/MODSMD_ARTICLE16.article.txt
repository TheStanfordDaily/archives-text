# Is Boycott the Answer to Apartheid?
## 
### HENRY MULLER 
In March, 1960, Africans demonstrating against pass-laws (laws
j providing that all non-Europeans carry identification cards) in
1 Sharpeville and Langa, South Africa, were shot at and imprisoned.
I he policy of apartheid, which was responsible for the incident,
, was shortly thereafter denounced by many o! the world's nations,

among them the United States'*
and the United Kingdom.
In that same year, a large num
ber of new African countries
joined the United Nations. They
maintained that denunciation of
apartheid without some definite
| action was equivalent to hypoc-
I risy. This was the beginning of
a period of difficult international
I relations for South Africa which
I still exists.
On August 7, 1963, the United
j Nations Security Council, by 106
, votes to South Africa's one, called
on the latter's government to re-
I lease all those imprisoned or re
stricted for "having opposed the
I policy of apartheid," at Sharpe
; ville for instance. The U.N.'s Gen
| eral Assembly meanwhile urged
| member states not 1o supply
j petroleum to South Africa in or
| der to force it to abandon its dis
criminatory policies.

Besides South Africa, five coun
tries voted against this resolu
tion: Great Britain, the United
States, and France, the three larg
est investors in South Africa, and
Spain and Portugal, both of which
still have colonies in Africa.
Prime Minister Like Luther
Dr. H. F. Vervvoerd. Prime Min
ister and leader of the Afrikaner
Nationalist Party, reacted to the
United Nation's action by stat
ing: "We will never give in. If
we weaken we are lost . . . Here
I stand . . . Like Luther, we too
say that we cannot do otherwise.
Our conscience shows us th e
road . . ."
Since that time, there has been
much serious discussion of an eco
nomic boycott of South Africa.
By the beginning of 1964, almost
all the independent nations of
Africa had placed an embargo on
trade with South Africa, while
outside Africa such trade has
been stopped by India, Malaya,
Jamaica, British Guiana, Burma.
Kuwait, Iran, the Philippines, and
the entire Sino-Soviet bloc.
In order for a boycott to suc
ceed in forcing the South African
government to alter its policy of
separating the races, it is neces
sary that more countries partici
pate, particularly such influen
tial ones as Britain and the United
States. Two effective types of em
bargoes exist: one being imposed
only on certain key commodities
and the other involving a cessa
tion of all trade.
Economic C'liaos
The advantage of an embargo
in which only certain products
would not be made available to
the South African government
would be that it would produce
considerable economic chaos with
in Soulh Africa without affecting
the remainder of world trade too
much. It would, moreover, have
the same effect as a complete
boycott in forcing the government
to negotiate with the United Na
tions. Also, the fact that the em
bargo was limited to certain com
modities would make for a bet
ter atmosphere in which negotia
tions could begin.
Some of South Africa's neigh
boring countries could not be
counted on to participate in an
international boycott of South
Africa. Being highly dependent
upon South Africa for their eco
nomic welfare, such nations as
Mozambique, Northern and South
ern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and
Mauritius would suffer an appre
ciable loss and would probably
not comply with a United Nations
request for sanctions against the
government of South Africa.
Portugal Wouldn't Boycott
Portugal, at least under its
present regime, is probably th e
only European country which
would continue trade with South
Africa.
Many arguments have been
raised in favor of an independent
boycott of South Africa by the
United States. One point raised is
that currently the American im
age is being damaged, particular
ly toward the many new African
nations. United Nations delegates
from such countries have accused
the United States of being "soft"
on apartheid in order to protect
its business interests.
Americans Manage Apartheid
They mention that Americans
have become deeply involved in
the management of apartheid it
self. They point to Ihe directors
of various semi-official bodies,
such as the Chamber of Mines,
which decides the wages and liv
ing conditions of its Negro em
ployees.
South Africa obtains from the
United States many commodities
which it critically needs. Among
these are machinery, parts, oil,
and ocean transportation. In ex
change, South Africa is able to
sell to the U.S. uranium and agri
cultural products.
It is claimed in the United
States that this country could eas
ily dispense with, or obtain at a

J competitive price from other
; sources, every item which now
| comes from South Africa. Presi
| dent Johnson, as a matter of fact,
| recently revealed that the uran
ium obtained from South Africa
| is actually surplus to American
I needs.
Ifurt Negroes More?
One reason commonly given in
this country for refusal to put
economic pressure on South
Africa is that it would probably
hurt, the Negroes more than the
whites in South Africa and put
them in even greater poverty
than that in which they are now
living. Spokesmen for the black
Africans, however, say that out
side economic pressure is the only
5 weapon left and are strongly in
j favor of a boycott of their own
. country. They maintain that
{ bloodshed will result if a peace
j ful alternative is not found
| quickly.
Right now the decision is up to
the United States. If it were fin
ally to take action to abolish
apartheid by applying economic
pressure to South Africa then
there is a strong chance that
Great Britain, particularly now
with a Labor government, would
follow her example.
Such a boycott would be much
I more effective than the current
one being imposed against Cuba
because it would have the sup
port of not only the United Na
tions, but; also the Soviet Union
and almost every country in Asia
and Africa.


"The true patriots of South Africa, for whom I
speak, will be satisfied with nothing less than
full democratic rights. We do not demand

these for people of African descent alone. We
demand them for all South Africans, white and
black."â€”Chief Luthuli in his Nobel lecture.
