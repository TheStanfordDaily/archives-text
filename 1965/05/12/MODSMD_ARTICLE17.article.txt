# Attractive Opportunities Tempt American Business Leaders
## 
### HENRY MULLER 
Foreign trade has played a ma
jor role in the economic growth of
South Africa, particularly by pro
viding many of the industrial ma
! terials necessary to that country.
The United States is the second
j largest investor in South Africa,
being responsible for about 20 per
cent of its imports. The United
Kingdom ranks first.
There is presently considerable
discussion to the effect that apart
heid is in great part responsible
for attracting United States busi
nessmen to South Africa. The
apartheid system is claimed to
offer the best of two worlds: a
modern, developed, industrial so
ciety with three million white
customers and a labor supply of
eleven million black Africans pro
hibited by law from organizing
! unions, bargaining collectively,
! striking, moving without permis
j sion, or voting.
Whether this be true or not, it
j is a fact that more than 160 Amer
j ican companies, of which 85 are
I on the New York Stock Exchange,
are now in South Africa with an

investment near a half-billion
dollars. These companies include
Coca-Cola, the Ford Motor Com
pany, General Motors, Interna
tional Business Machines, and the
Standard Oil Company of Cali
fornia.
U.S. Help
The United States is given
credit for saving the South Afri
can economy from panic in 1961.
For a variety of reasons, invest
ors had withdrawn capital from

! South Africa and as a result its
| gold and foreign exchange hold
i ings dropped to a critical low. In
I that year, it contributed almost
the entire amount of foreign ex
change necessary to bring the
South African economy out. of
this crisis. By June, 1963. South
Africa's gold and foreign ex
change reserves had tripled.
The United States government
has constantly been under fire
for its support of the South Afri
can economy. It succumbed to
this pressure for the first time
when it banned the sale of arms
and ammunitions to that country
as of January 1, 1964. The United
Kingdom has imposed a some
what similar restriction banning
arms that are to be used in fur

thering apartheid.
These two countries have ap-:
parently become frightened by
the spectacular increase in t h e i
amount of money spent by t h e ;
South African government for j
arms manufacture. Between 1961 j
and 1964, this sum had increased j
by a factor of 66. The amount
spent on Defense and Police had
increased from $112 to $291 mil-j
lion, according to budget esti-;
mates revealed by the South
African government.
Uranium
The abundance of uranium de
posits in South Africa is another
reason for the United States' fa
| vorable position toward that coun
j try. In 1957, the United States
I agred to help South Africa be
j come a "nuclear nation" and an
i American company, Allis Chalm
ers, began building South Africa's
j first atomic reactor. Since that!
I time, it has received hundreds of;
I millions of dollars and much close |
' technical cooperation from the!
j United States.
There are numerous reasons
for the interest of American busi
! nesses in South Africa. One of the
more prominent is the fact that;
j the rates of taxation in South]
1 Africa are considerably lower
! than those in most of the ad-,
| vanced industrial countries, in- '
eluding the United States. The;
| South African government also ;
j never places restrictions on the
; payment of dividends to foreign
shareholders.
Another factor is that I he gov- i
eminent, in trying to encourage j
overseas investment, repeatedly |
states that it has no intention of 1
entering any field of activity
where private enterprise shows |
itself willing and able.
The United States is not the;
only major investor in South
Africa. Britain, the leader, had in-
I terests totaling over $2Va billion
! in 1960. France and Switzerland
had about $231 and $172 million
respectively invested. Other na
tions include West Germany,
Japan, Italy, the Netherlands,]
Belgium, and Canada, as well as
a number of African neighbors.

There is presently considerable

! nesses in South Africa. One of the
more prominent is the fact that;
j the rates of taxation in South]
1 Africa are considerably lower
! than those in most of the ad-,
| vanced industrial countries, in- '
eluding the United States. The;
| South African government also ;
j never places restrictions on the
; payment of dividends to foreign
shareholders.
Another factor is that I he gov- i
eminent, in trying to encourage j
overseas investment, repeatedly |
states that it has no intention of 1
entering any field of activity
where private enterprise shows |
itself willing and able.
The United States is not the;
only major investor in South
Africa. Britain, the leader, had in-
I terests totaling over $2Va billion
! in 1960. France and Switzerland
had about $231 and $172 million
respectively invested. Other na
tions include West Germany,
Japan, Italy, the Netherlands,]
Belgium, and Canada, as well as
a number of African neighbors.
