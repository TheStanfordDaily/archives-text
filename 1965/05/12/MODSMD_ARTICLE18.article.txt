# Racial Strife Deep in South African Past
## 
### BRUCE BURTON 
White. Black. Colored.
These three groups comprise
the population ol' the Republic
of South Africa, a nation econom
ically progressive hut politically
attempting to maintain a govern
ment based on policies abandoned
by a majority of countries of the
Western world.
The whites, primarily Euro
peans of English and Dutch de
scent, control the government
and maintain "apartheid," a pol

icy of complete social, economic
and political separation among
the races.
The second group, the
; "coloreds," are Indians and Ma
lays who have migrated to South
Africa and form a link between
the white and black populations.
The third faction is the black
peoples, descendants of tribes
which occupied South Africa
about the same time as the early
Dutch settlers, make up about 50
per cent of the population of
South Africa.

Situation Precarious
The situation in South Africa is
precarious. Opposition to apart
heid has increased, not only with
in the country but without. A
i special United Nations report is
sued in 1963 has condemned al
legedly repressive measures of
1 the white government and its "in
creased military preparation."
Despite international criticism,
! the government maintains it is
working for preservation of na
tional peace through "no domina
tion of any one race by anolher."
"To achieve this, our policy is
aimed at the creation of separate
states for the national groups
which originally settled in South
I Africa," South African Ambas-
I sador to the U.S. H. L. T. Taswell
i has said.
As evidence, the ambassador
! cited the National Council of the
black population and the National
Indian Council for South Afri
cans of Asian descent.
"Race relations are improving,
harmony is increasing in South
Africa. Internally, our country is
one of the most peaceful in the
world," he said.
Yet strife is there. According
to the UN report, "repressive ac
tion and legislation" has left
"many South Africans with the
conviction that they have no
means of resistance other than
violence."
The struggle between the races
goes back three hundred years,
to the settling of South Africa,
and it is a history of strife not
only among the whites and the
colored peoples, but between the
Europeans themselves.
Turbulent History
The first Europeans to settle
in South Africa were the Dutch,
who established in 1962 a "re
freshment station" on the Cape of
Good Hope, for ships travelling to
India and the Far East. Within 80
years, the Dutch called Boers—
had moved far into the interior
but were stopped at the Fish
River by Xosa and Zulu tribes
men.
Between 1793 and 1820, control
of the Cape Colony wavered be
tween British and the Dutch due
to the wars in Europe. When the
British took permanent control
in 1820, they began to change the
government structure of the col
ony. Slavery was abolished in
1833, and three years later the
! Boers- heavily dependent of the
sal very introduced nearly 200

I years before began the Great
Trek, a mass migration into the
! interior.
The Trek destroyed white unity
in the colony.
The Dutch descendants who
i moved inland formed a "poor
white" class, but the British who
! remained on the coast kepi a
busy commercial interest with
1 Europe. Rivalry built up between
I the two people: The Boers not
only resented the superior eco
nomic status of the English, but
i they also protested abolition of
| slavery, which put the natives
! "on an equal fooling with Chris
tians, contrary to the laws of God,
and the natural distinctions of
: race and colour," as one Boer
wrote during the Trek.
Dutch States
j The Dutch established separate
I but weak states in the interior,
I most notable of which was the
| Transvaal. In 1880, the British
attempted to annex this state and
fighting lasted less than a year
with ultimate Boer victory; an
armistice was signed giving the
I Transvaal complete self-govern
ment, except in foreign policy,
and granting equal rights to all
Europeans.
Agitation continued with the
discovery of the Kimberly mines
and the landing of 10,000 British
troops in South Africa. Rebellion
once more broke out in 1889, con
tinuing for over a decade. The
Boers led a bitter guerrilla war,
resulting in widespread destruc
tion of property. But the Boer
republics were forced to give up
thir independence in the Treaty
of Vereeniging in 1902, followed
! seven years later by unification
j of all the states, Boer and British.
! of South Africa.
Racial Fear Continues
Even then, the racial problem
which today confronts the Re
; public of South Africa was form
| ing. The Dutch restricted the
i franchise to the white popula
| tion, the British let natives vote
! in predominately English states.
I British liberalism led to Boer fear
of loss of their political suprem
acy. And the British were chiefly
I concerned with reconciliation of
| the two white factions of the
! South African population, not ex
pansion of rights for the natives.
This fear led to establishment
!of the Boer — also called Afri
kaner—Nationalist Party. Taking
! advantage oft he British trend
toward reconciliation, Ihe Boers
wrangled concessions from the

British to maintain their super
iority to the native populace, de
spite a liberal movement in Eng
land favoring racial equality.
By 1918, the Nationalist Party
had gained control of the country.
In the three subsequent govern
ments of D. F. Malan, Strijdom
and H. F. Verwoerd, legislation
was passed to maintain white
supremacy. Parliamentary repre
sentation for Indians was repeal
ed, a number of cities were
closed to Africans seeking jobs,
stiff penalties were imposed for
defiance of racial barriers, eco
nomic segregation bills were
passed, and separate secondary
schools and universities were set
up for the black population.
Opposition Parties
These acts created an opposi
tion. both black and white, which
still operate despite heavy gov
ernment restrictions: The Liberal
Party, formed in 1935 and by
now predominantly non-whites,
supports a non-racial South Afri
ca; the African National Con
gress, a mixture of "colored" and
black members, has worked for
equal political and social rights
for all South Africans; and the
PAC, a militant group at times
labeled as a black racist party.
In addition, there are at least
three terrorist organizations in
South Africa which have caused
the government to increase de
fense spending in recent years.
Despite mutual resistance
against the present government's
policies, the South African op
position has not united. Attempts
to unify the different groups
have failed because of racial dis
trust, discrepancies in ideology,
goals, tactics, and the efforts each
party takes to gain support
among the population.
Government restrictions on dis
senting political factions have al
so prevented unification of the
opposition. According to a report
issued by a special committee of
the United Nations, the South
African government has intesi
fied repressive measures: "In
spite of Security Council and
General Assembly resolutions
calling for amnesty for oppon
ents of the policy of apartheid,
death sentences have been exe
cuted. other death sentences have
recently been passed, and trials
are now proceeding against prom
inent national leaders on charges
which carry the death sentence

Yet the opposition remains ac
tive. One member, Chief Luthuli,
who won the Nobel Peace pr ize in
1962, has demanded "abolition of
all racial bars," not only for peo
ple of African descent, "but for 1
all South Africans, white and
black."
Despite the denials of white
leaders in South Africa, the rac
ial situation in South Africa re-

I mains explosive. According to 1 ho
I UN report, "a political, economic
| and social system built on the
j domination of one race by .in
other cannot survive.
"What is now at issue is not
1 1lie final outcome, but the ques
tion of whether, on the way, the
I people of South Africa are to go
' through a long ordeal of blood
I and hate."
