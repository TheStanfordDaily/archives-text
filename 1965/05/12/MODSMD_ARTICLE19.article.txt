# Apartheid to Stay In South Africa
## 
### JIM HAUSER 
"Apartheicl is a policy which cannot he carried to its logical
extreme in South Africa," David Abernethy, student of African
Affairs at Harvard University, said in a recent interview.
Its logical conclusion is the separation by race of the three groups
of inhabitants of South Africa, the whites, the colonreds (Indians

and Mulattoes) and blacks, each
to live in his own culture and own
j traditions within one political sys
tem headed by whites.
Apartheid.cannot ho carried to
; its extreme because, Abernethy
j said. "The maintenance of th e
J economy from the white man's
poinl of view, demands that Afri
can labor liYe in a non-traditional
(i.e., urban) setting and that Afri
| cans work in physical proximity
J to whites (i.e., under them.)"
Military Power
To say that its logical extreme
is impracticable is not to say that
apartheid is on the verge of ex
j tinction, Abernethy said.
The South African white wants
to continue apartheid. "The South
! African government is impervious
to outside criticism. It has, by
African standards, enormous mili
j tary stocks at its disposal, a n d
would not find it difficult to re
pulse any invasion from the rest
of Africa, unless the military
capacity of ihe latter is greatly
reinforced."
The only alternatives to apart
heid, Abernethy believes, are at
least partial integration and
armed conflict.
Abernethy stressed the impor
tance of the "coloureds" in South
Africa. "They are half African
and half white. The coloured popu
lation is crucial in linking black
and white."
U.S. Supports Whites
In the event of armed conflict,
however, Abernethy said the
South African government could
probably count on support or neu
trality from the United States.
"The United States, with over
90 per cent of its African invest
ments in the Republic of South
i Africa, is unlikely to support
I either armed invasion or civil
; war unless it foresees the pos
sibility of stable government at
, tho other end. and given the back
ward state in which Africans
have been kept it is unlikely that
; political stability can be quickly
restored following the overthrow
of the National government."
Several observers have pre
dicted that unless the white gov
ernment stops oppressing (he
Africans in the name of apartheid,

violence will break out. Abernethy
| believes the oppression will not
; stop. "I don't really know how
I the government cou Id back
j down."
No Exit
Backing down on apartheid
! would involve consequences the
I government could not allow. The
. minimum demand of the Africans
' would be the light to form trade
| unions. Abernethy pointed out
! that unions would be more politi-
I cal than economic instruments.
! South African natives already re
' ceive higher wages than those to
; the north.
"Economic concessions are not
! the answer." Abernethy said,
j "They want the political right to
establish themselves."
If political rights, now non-ex
istent, were to be granted the
Africans, Abernethy believes the
result would be insupportable to
the present government.
One Man, One Vote
"I don't see how anyone can set
j tie for anything less than 'One
man, one vote,'" he said. That
would mean "nothing less than a
complete reversal of the present
situation."
To keep the Africans in I heir
present position, the primary con
cern of the white government
must be "building up the military
capacity while pressing ahead
with the "Bantustans," (tribal
government units in which na
tives participate), to give the ap
pearance of self-government."
Because the military capacity
! of the white government is cru
cial to maintaining white suprem
acy, the government may remain
"impervious to world opinion, but 1
not; impervious to withdrawal of
| U.S. support."
The communist countries have i
sided with the Africans againstl
| the government. This, coupled:
:with "the United States' instine-j
I tive support of law and order" |
I make it unlikely that Africans â– 
i can count on United States sup-1
i port should they revolt.
Obviously I don't support apart
heid," Abernethy said, "but I
think realism suggests that it;
may be here to stay for longer
than we think."
