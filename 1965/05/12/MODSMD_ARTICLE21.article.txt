# Stanford Baseballers Win 30 Games by Downing UOP, 12-1
## 
### PETE KING 
Stanford baseballers won their
30th game of tlie season yester
day in Sunken Diamond, bomb
ing hapless University ol' Pacific,
12-1, in a non-league game.
This is the first time in 74
years of Stanford baseball t hat
the Cards have won as many as
30 games. The team was 29-15 in
1953. Of course, it wasn't until
1947 that Stanford even played
30 games in a season, but that
doesn't detract from the team's j
fine 30-8 record, which is a .789 |
percentage, the best since 1893. i
The Indians got their 12 runs I
against UOP in various and sun-1

dry ways, namely on 12 hits,
seven walks, three UOP errors,
two wild pitches, three stolen
bases, two passed balls, and one
hit batter.
Steve Hovley, Bill Boles, George j
Thaeher, and Jim Hibbs each had
two hits, but the big blow was'
I John Propstra's Bth inning triple j
| to center, which scored two runs, j
| Propstra later scored on a wild j
i pitch.
Tribe <i<>ts Revenge
The Tribe gained revenge for
last year's 6-3 loss to the Tigers,
and their overall record against
Pacific is now 16-3.
Leading 2-0 after three innings,
Stanford scored three unearned
runs in the fourth. Right fielder
I Karl Neilsen dropped a fly ball |
; hit by Hibbs for a three-base er-j
! ror, Tom Melzer and Bob Cox
j scoring on the play. Hibbs raced ;
| home when the UOP first base
man took the cut-off throw from
j right field and threw it over th<>
third baseman's head.
In the fifth inning, a two-run
single by* Hovley, a sacrifice fly
by Cox. and a single by Hibbs
brought across four more runs.
CIBA Hopes Soar
i Stanford's hopes for the CIBA j
title received a boost yesterday I

! when Santa Clara beat Cal, 6-3.
I The Bears are 10-8, while Santa
i Clara is 7-8. Stanford, at 12-6,
| thus has clinched a tic for th e
! title, with two contests with San
j ta Clara left. Should the Broncos
I sweep those two games and also
! win their remaining three, they
I would tie the Indians at 12-8.
j However, the real plum of the
season is a berth in the NCAA
I tournament, and Santa Clara
: would get the nod, having won
I three of four games from Stan
ford.
All the Indians need is one vic
tory or one Santa Clara loss, and
the title is theirs alone.
