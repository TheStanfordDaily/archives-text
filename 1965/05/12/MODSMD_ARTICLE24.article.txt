## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
The frosh baseball team has
ended their first year of participa
tion in the new Bay Area Fresh
man Baseball League by tying for j
the top spot with rival Santa
Clara. The Frosh had to beat USF
8-3 Monday to move into the
deadlock.
The Frosh led the lea g u e
throughout most of the year until
they ran into the Cal Cubs who
threw a wrench in ihe Papooses'
pennant plans by handing Stan- 1
ford two late season setbacks. Be
sides the two losses to California, i
the Frosh also dropped two to co
winner Santa Clara.
Good pitching was the main
stay of the team as Frank Klin
ger and Bill Holt won 9 games be
tween them. Klinger boasted a
miscroscopic ERA of 1.55 while
Holt's wasn't anymore visible at
1.88. Klinger averaged more than ,
a strikeout per inning as he whif
fed 63 batters in only 58 innings. 1
Hitter's Team
Surely the pretense of great J
pitching does not overshadow the I
steady hitting which the team got. j
Bill Holt also was the team leader ;
in hitting with an average of .351. [
When not pitching Bill held down j
first base or one of the outfield j
spots.
Mike Schomaker followed with I
an average of .347. but ,iust as im
portant is the fact that he had 17
stolen bases. Hi Lewis led the
team in RBl's with 16. He also
picked up a win as a hurler. In a
doubleheader with San Jose he
drove in the winning run in both ;
games with triples and won the!
second in relief of starter Charlie j
Ryan.

The team won a total of 18
games for the year, two of them
non-league contests with Menlo
College. In the frosh league the
California Cubs came in third
four games behind the leaders.
USF" trailed by S games, and San
Jose and S.F. State tied for last
12 games to the rear.
The Stanford squad had some
very impressive team statistics.
The team FRA was a fine 1.68. but
does not reflect the number of

runs actually given up. Errors
drop the ERA as last as a lack
of runs does. In league competi
tion the learn hatted over .300.
Although the teams finished in
a dead heat, there will be no play
oft for the freshman champion
ship between Santa Clara and
Stanford. Coach Ray Young of
Stanford was hoping for such a
game, but the Broncos turned it
down, being pleased with iheir
come from-behind tie.
