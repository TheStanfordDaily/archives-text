## Indians Win Letter-of-Intent Battle, 101-46 
### Joe Hernandez 
The Stanford recruiting team, alias the Coaching Staff, headed j
by football mentor John Ralston, made off with a lion's share of
the spoils as the newly instigated letter-of-intent ended ihe annual
battle over the nation's top athletes.
The letter-of-intent is beneficial to both the school and the athlete,
and it will hopefully spread to the other conferences in the country.,
; The first benefit for the school will be in time. Last year at this time j
Coach Ralston was dividing his time between spring football and I
| worrying about the next year's frosh team.
This spring his problem is more akin to that of Dodger Coach Walt j
: Alston. When Los Angeles has a doubleheader he has to decide in |
which order to pitch Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax.
Athletes Benefit
The prospective athletes will benefit by having the multi-lateral j
i pressure removed and by having the heavy demands on their time!
; alleviated. The recruiting whirl of dinners, baseball games, and;
weekend trip to various schools often relegates studies to a "Well, I
I guess I'm not doing anything else next Wednesday night" position, j
And with finals approaching in late May and early June many !
: athletes could profitably spend a few hours booking.
The letter-in-intent was recently started by the PAC and has no j
binding effect outside the conference. The way it works is that ;
Tom Hamilton, the conference commissioner, sends the letter-of
| intent to any boy who appears on one of the lists of prospective ath
letes turned in by each of the schools. The athlete is then free to dei
' clare his choice any time up until school begins, or he can do nothing ;
if he wishes.
If the eight conference schools follow the letter-of-intent policy, as
soon as an athlete signs the letter everyone except the school which
he wants to attend will stop recruiting him. Ideally, if an athlete goes
to a school different from the one named on his letter-of-intent he
will lose his freshman eligibility and also any financial aid he is
receiving as an athlete.
60 IVr Cent Return
So far 326 of the commitments have been returned to Hamilton's of-j
fice. This represents about 60 per cent of the letters originally sent j
out. Of these 326 boys Stanford got 101 of them. Washington was
a distant second with 46. Cal was next with 38. USC was fourth but :
certainly not a distant fourth. The Trojans had 37 signees.
USC has been upgrading its admissions standards lately and has ,
to farm out many of its athletes to bring up their grades. So two j
Septembers from now the Trojans will have quite a few additions to
1 he class of '69.
Nine sports are represented by the 101: football, 47; basketball, IS; j
baseball, 18; track, 11; swimming, 7; tennis. 3; golf, 3; gymnastics
and wrestling 1 each. Thirteen of the athletes are two-sporters with j
football and baseball being the pair chosen by eight of them.
Last year eight members of the North-South Shrine football team
said they would go to Stanford. This year eleven say they are com
ing here. A few of the outstanding players are George Buehler, Phil |
Messer, Nate Kirtman, Gene Washington, and Mark Marquess.
Agile 235 Pounders
Buehler and Messer are both agile 235 pounders. Buehler was an !
end-linebacker on the Whittier team which won the large schools'
division of the C.I.F. He has also won the C.I.F. heavyweight j
wrestling title twice. Messer, from Servitc High School in Orange j
County, was one of the outstanding tackles in the area.
Kirtman is a local boy from Washington High School in San Fran
cisco. Ho was the top back in the City last season. After the season
his name was often mentioned in connection with the Naval Academy
by the San Francisco papers, but they were erroneous in sending
him across the country.
In Marquess and Washington, Stanford is getting the quarter
backs from both sides in the Shrine game. Marquess, from Stock
ton. is on the North team. He was named the number one back in
Northern California by the Examiner last season. He is a baseball
player, 100.
Poly Star
Washington is from Long Beach Poly, which in the past has been ,
the source of quite a few USC stars, for instance, Willie Brown, j
Washington, who will quarterback the South team, was one of the
most sought after players in the Southland. He was courted by
every school in the West, from Washington to Arizona and by some I
schools who were not, such as Princeton. He also played on the
Poly team which won the C.I.F. AAA crown.
Among the basketball prospects is guard Bill Halligan of Servite
High in Orange County. He led his team to the C.I.F. AA champion-1
ship. In a poll compiled by a local paper, the coaches named him
the college prospect in the country. Don Griffin from Fremont High
in Oakland is another top prospect.
Mike Ryan from Wilcox High in Santa Clara, who was the state |
champ in the mile last year, is one of the future members of the
track team. He has a best of 1:10.1 in the mile and an 8:57.7 clocking j
in the 2 mile.
Olympic gold medalist Dick Roth of Atherton heads the swimming )
contingent. Luis Nicolao, from Argentina bv way of Los Altos, is the
world record holder in the 100 butterfly.
