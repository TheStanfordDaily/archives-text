# A 						Confrontation of Races; Understanding and Suicide

Ninety per cent of the people in the world are
either non-Christian, non-white, or non-democratic\
For those who believe Christianity, whiteness,
and democracy are the pillars of western civiliza
tion, this century has posed horrible questions.
Christian theologians have admitted more openly
the authenticity of Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, and
Confucian religions. Existential stoicism has ques
tioned the need for any formal religion at all.
Whiteness Out
Whiteness is, in African and Asiatic countries,
more often associated with imperalism than eman
cipation. In many parts of Africa and Asia, people
utter "European" with the same ugliness thai
Americans utter "Nigger,"
Democracy can no longer be simply the greatest
good for the greatest number. If elections can put
Hitler in power, what safeguards are necessary to
prevent Ihe manipulation of the unconscious and
the emotional?
The inertia of the larger nations to change
increases the chances that new answers to the
problems of politics and economics must come
from the countries willing to experiment with new
systems. The newness of the African nations leaves
them very open to experiment.
Peak of Power
It is possible that the white nations are near the
peak of their power. China has 150,000,000 children
in elementary school. Africa has 26 nations shoving
clumsily but enthusiastically for independence and
automony. And it is shallow of the white man to
see India's and South America's demands for neu
trality as a device to play off one large power
against the other. Inside neutrality is the demand
for national equality, independence, and dignity.
The rising colored nations have a voice, and it
is demanding. The voices of the rising colored na
tions are eloquent and demanding. Chief Luthuli,
of the South African Bantus, spoke to the world in
his Nobel lecture of 1961.
"In government, we will not be satisfied with
anything less than direct individual adult suffrage.
In economic matters, we will be satisfied with
nothing less than equality of opportunity in every
sphere. In culture, we will be satisfied with nothing
less than the opening ot' all doors of learning to
non-segregatory institutions on the sole criterion
of ability. In the social sphere, we will be satisfied
with nothing less than the abolition of all racial
bars. We do not demand these things for people
of African descent alone. We demand them for all
South Africans, white and black."
Apartheid
The white government in South Africa, now
solidly in power since only whites can vole, prac
tices apartheid, a policy designed to separate the
races of the Republic of South Africa from one
another in all spheres but the economic. One may
view apartheid generally as one method of hand
ling the confrontation of races or cultures.
But one cannot understand the problem in gen
eral terms only. The government of South Africa
correctly claims its troubles and solutions are
unique.
The population of the Republic of South Africa
is 17,065,000. 11,900,000 of those are black Africans,
called by the government Bantus. These are the
African tribes who have migrated down from
the North attracted by the white man's factory.
Whites Outnumbered
South Africa has 3,250,000 whites. Of these,
about 60 per cent are of Dutch descent, calling
themselves Africaaners and speaking Africaans.
These were the earliest settlers to the tip of the
dark continent. While their ancestors in the Dutch
East India Company established the first white
colony at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, only a
handful of natives was to be found in all of what
is now the Republic. The situation is closely analog
ous to that of the English settlors landing about
the same year in Massachusetts, half way around
the world.
Whereas in Massachusetts the whites eventually
outnumbered and overpowered the Indians, in
South Africa, the Dutch held one area, maintained
domination, and employed increasing numbers of
Bantus in factories.
Between 1806 and 1910 the British had control of
the Cape, and it is from this period that the pres
ent British whites in the South descend.

Hottentots
Besides the Bantus and the whites, the third
large race is the coloreds, descendents of the in
digenous Hottentots, Maylays, and the people of
mixed blood. The coloreds, who number 1,648,000,
speak either English or Africaans.
In addition, some 522,000 Asians inhabit tlie
South. Most are descendents of Indians brought
in by the British to work on sugar plantations.
Today in South Africa the white minority -is
fighting for its existence. The means it has em
ployed to realize even the first stages of the apart
heid policy have inflamed native resentment.
Best for Blacks
The South African government says apartheid
is the only way to preserve the white man's
achievement. It is also, it claims, the best policy
for the non-white. Apartheid promises self-govern
ment and a higher than average living standard
forthe Bantus.
The Bantus, however, want more than a higher
than average living standard. They want total in
tegration, One Man, One Vote. So far they have
neither the vote, nor much hope of getting it. The
South African government is racing black resent
ment. The whites say that once the non-white sees
how good apartheid is, he will be content. The
problem is keeping him in line until he sees how
happy he will he.
In 1962 the parliament, by passing the General
Law Amendment Act, authorized the Minister of
Justice to "list as a communist" any person whom
he considers working toward any of the aims of
communism (no evidence is required) or toward
any social and economic change contrary to gov
ernment policy.
Oeatli Penalty
One of the stricter paragraphs of the law de
clares that the penalty for writing a political
slogan on a wall which is public property is, at
minimum, five years in prison, and at maximum,
death.
In spite of these laws the government professes
not to understand non-white resentment. The
government points out correctly that non-whites
in South Africa are more highly paid, hold better
jobs, and enjoy higher living standards than non
whites anywhere else in Africa.
But the difference between the whites and the
non-whites in South Africa is the greatest on the
continent. Though the non-white may be absolutely
better off, relatively he is farther from the top.
Apartheid False
Nonwhites in the other nations of Africa look
forward to independence whiJe those in the South
look forward to apartheid. And for the non-white,
apartheid is a false doctrine. It promises self
government in the traditions of the race. But it also
necessitates continuing the present economic re
lationship. It was this relationship cheap black,
unskilled labor working for white factory owners
which destroyed the black man's traditional, agrar
ian life. The black man needs new roots and he
does not believe he can find them in apartheid.
Arms Stopped
Though the United States and United Kingdom
stopped shipping arms to South Africa in January,
1964, they remain the country's main suppliers of
strategic materials. The United States bases its
support of the South African regime on two points.
One, the present government is the only possible
stable one, and two, an embargo would hurt the
blacks it intends to help.
The black leaders themselves have said they pre
fer not to be protected from embargo by the
United States. Their lot, they say, is already bad
enough. However there is some truth to the U.S.
assertion that the blacks, if they took over, could
not maintain order. Their leaders spend most of
their time in jail for past offenses or "communist"
activities.
In June, 1963, President Kennedy said, "Is peace
not in the last analysis a matter of human rights?"
This seems to be the core of the problem. The
white demands the right to maintain his achieve
ment as it is. The black man demands the opening
of the market to competition so that the black I
can share in the country's wealth, not according to |
what the white man would like to allow him.
but according to how much his energy can develop.
The energy of the black is what the white man
fears most.

Whiteness Out
Whiteness is, in African and Asiatic countries,
more often associated with imperalism than eman
cipation. In many parts of Africa and Asia, people
utter "European" with the same ugliness thai
Americans utter "Nigger,"
Democracy can no longer be simply the greatest

The inertia of the larger nations to change

problems of politics and economics must come

Peak of Power
It is possible that the white nations are near the
peak of their power. China has 150,000,000 children
in elementary school. Africa has 26 nations shoving
clumsily but enthusiastically for independence and
automony. And it is shallow of the white man to
see India's and South America's demands for neu
trality as a device to play off one large power
against the other. Inside neutrality is the demand
for national equality, independence, and dignity.
The rising colored nations have a voice, and it
is demanding. The voices of the rising colored na
tions are eloquent and demanding. Chief Luthuli,
of the South African Bantus, spoke to the world in
his Nobel lecture of 1961.
"In government, we will not be satisfied with
anything less than direct individual adult suffrage.
In economic matters, we will be satisfied with
nothing less than equality of opportunity in every
sphere. In culture, we will be satisfied with nothing
less than the opening ot' all doors of learning to
non-segregatory institutions on the sole criterion
of ability. In the social sphere, we will be satisfied
with nothing less than the abolition of all racial
bars. We do not demand these things for people
of African descent alone. We demand them for all
South Africans, white and black."
Apartheid
The white government in South Africa, now
solidly in power since only whites can vole, prac
tices apartheid, a policy designed to separate the
races of the Republic of South Africa from one
another in all spheres but the economic. One may
view apartheid generally as one method of hand
ling the confrontation of races or cultures.
But one cannot understand the problem in gen
eral terms only. The government of South Africa
correctly claims its troubles and solutions are
unique.
The population of the Republic of South Africa
is 17,065,000. 11,900,000 of those are black Africans,
called by the government Bantus. These are the
African tribes who have migrated down from
the North attracted by the white man's factory.
Whites Outnumbered
South Africa has 3,250,000 whites. Of these,
about 60 per cent are of Dutch descent, calling
themselves Africaaners and speaking Africaans.
These were the earliest settlers to the tip of the
dark continent. While their ancestors in the Dutch
East India Company established the first white
colony at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, only a
handful of natives was to be found in all of what
is now the Republic. The situation is closely analog
ous to that of the English settlors landing about
the same year in Massachusetts, half way around
the world.
Whereas in Massachusetts the whites eventually
outnumbered and overpowered the Indians, in
South Africa, the Dutch held one area, maintained
domination, and employed increasing numbers of
Bantus in factories.
Between 1806 and 1910 the British had control of
the Cape, and it is from this period that the pres
ent British whites in the South descend.

Hottentots
Besides the Bantus and the whites, the third
large race is the coloreds, descendents of the in
digenous Hottentots, Maylays, and the people of
mixed blood. The coloreds, who number 1,648,000,
speak either English or Africaans.
In addition, some 522,000 Asians inhabit tlie
South. Most are descendents of Indians brought
in by the British to work on sugar plantations.
Today in South Africa the white minority -is
fighting for its existence. The means it has em
ployed to realize even the first stages of the apart
heid policy have inflamed native resentment.
Best for Blacks
The South African government says apartheid
is the only way to preserve the white man's
achievement. It is also, it claims, the best policy
for the non-white. Apartheid promises self-govern
ment and a higher than average living standard
forthe Bantus.
The Bantus, however, want more than a higher
than average living standard. They want total in
tegration, One Man, One Vote. So far they have
neither the vote, nor much hope of getting it. The
South African government is racing black resent
ment. The whites say that once the non-white sees
how good apartheid is, he will be content. The
problem is keeping him in line until he sees how
happy he will he.
In 1962 the parliament, by passing the General
Law Amendment Act, authorized the Minister of
Justice to "list as a communist" any person whom
he considers working toward any of the aims of
communism (no evidence is required) or toward
any social and economic change contrary to gov
ernment policy.
Oeatli Penalty
One of the stricter paragraphs of the law de
clares that the penalty for writing a political
slogan on a wall which is public property is, at
minimum, five years in prison, and at maximum,
death.
In spite of these laws the government professes
not to understand non-white resentment. The
government points out correctly that non-whites
in South Africa are more highly paid, hold better
jobs, and enjoy higher living standards than non
whites anywhere else in Africa.
But the difference between the whites and the
non-whites in South Africa is the greatest on the
continent. Though the non-white may be absolutely
better off, relatively he is farther from the top.
Apartheid False
Nonwhites in the other nations of Africa look
forward to independence whiJe those in the South
look forward to apartheid. And for the non-white,
apartheid is a false doctrine. It promises self
government in the traditions of the race. But it also
necessitates continuing the present economic re
lationship. It was this relationship cheap black,
unskilled labor working for white factory owners
which destroyed the black man's traditional, agrar
ian life. The black man needs new roots and he
does not believe he can find them in apartheid.
Arms Stopped
Though the United States and United Kingdom
stopped shipping arms to South Africa in January,
1964, they remain the country's main suppliers of
strategic materials. The United States bases its
support of the South African regime on two points.
One, the present government is the only possible
stable one, and two, an embargo would hurt the
blacks it intends to help.
The black leaders themselves have said they pre
fer not to be protected from embargo by the
United States. Their lot, they say, is already bad
enough. However there is some truth to the U.S.
assertion that the blacks, if they took over, could
not maintain order. Their leaders spend most of
their time in jail for past offenses or "communist"
activities.

Whiteness Out
Whiteness is, in African and Asiatic countries,
more often associated with imperalism than eman
cipation. In many parts of Africa and Asia, people
utter "European" with the same ugliness thai
Americans utter "Nigger,"
Democracy can no longer be simply the greatest

The inertia of the larger nations to change
increases the chances that new answers to the
problems of politics and economics must come
from the countries willing to experiment with new
systems. The newness of the African nations leaves
them very open to experiment.
Peak of Power
It is possible that the white nations are near the
peak of their power. China has 150,000,000 children
in elementary school. Africa has 26 nations shoving
clumsily but enthusiastically for independence and
automony. And it is shallow of the white man to
see India's and South America's demands for neu
trality as a device to play off one large power
against the other. Inside neutrality is the demand
for national equality, independence, and dignity.
The rising colored nations have a voice, and it
is demanding. The voices of the rising colored na
tions are eloquent and demanding. Chief Luthuli,
of the South African Bantus, spoke to the world in
his Nobel lecture of 1961.
"In government, we will not be satisfied with
anything less than direct individual adult suffrage.
In economic matters, we will be satisfied with
nothing less than equality of opportunity in every
sphere. In culture, we will be satisfied with nothing
less than the opening ot' all doors of learning to
non-segregatory institutions on the sole criterion
of ability. In the social sphere, we will be satisfied
with nothing less than the abolition of all racial
bars. We do not demand these things for people
of African descent alone. We demand them for all
South Africans, white and black."
Apartheid
The white government in South Africa, now
solidly in power since only whites can vole, prac
tices apartheid, a policy designed to separate the
races of the Republic of South Africa from one
another in all spheres but the economic. One may
view apartheid generally as one method of hand
ling the confrontation of races or cultures.
But one cannot understand the problem in gen
eral terms only. The government of South Africa
correctly claims its troubles and solutions are
unique.
The population of the Republic of South Africa
is 17,065,000. 11,900,000 of those are black Africans,
called by the government Bantus. These are the
African tribes who have migrated down from
the North attracted by the white man's factory.
Whites Outnumbered
South Africa has 3,250,000 whites. Of these,
about 60 per cent are of Dutch descent, calling
themselves Africaaners and speaking Africaans.
These were the earliest settlers to the tip of the
dark continent. While their ancestors in the Dutch
East India Company established the first white
colony at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, only a
handful of natives was to be found in all of what
is now the Republic. The situation is closely analog
ous to that of the English settlors landing about
the same year in Massachusetts, half way around
the world.
Whereas in Massachusetts the whites eventually
outnumbered and overpowered the Indians, in
South Africa, the Dutch held one area, maintained
domination, and employed increasing numbers of
Bantus in factories.
Between 1806 and 1910 the British had control of
the Cape, and it is from this period that the pres
ent British whites in the South descend.

Hottentots
Besides the Bantus and the whites, the third
large race is the coloreds, descendents of the in
digenous Hottentots, Maylays, and the people of
mixed blood. The coloreds, who number 1,648,000,
speak either English or Africaans.
In addition, some 522,000 Asians inhabit tlie
South. Most are descendents of Indians brought
in by the British to work on sugar plantations.
Today in South Africa the white minority -is
fighting for its existence. The means it has em
ployed to realize even the first stages of the apart
heid policy have inflamed native resentment.
Best for Blacks
The South African government says apartheid
is the only way to preserve the white man's
achievement. It is also, it claims, the best policy
for the non-white. Apartheid promises self-govern
ment and a higher than average living standard
forthe Bantus.
The Bantus, however, want more than a higher
than average living standard. They want total in
tegration, One Man, One Vote. So far they have
neither the vote, nor much hope of getting it. The
South African government is racing black resent
ment. The whites say that once the non-white sees
how good apartheid is, he will be content. The
problem is keeping him in line until he sees how
happy he will he.
In 1962 the parliament, by passing the General
Law Amendment Act, authorized the Minister of
Justice to "list as a communist" any person whom
he considers working toward any of the aims of
communism (no evidence is required) or toward
any social and economic change contrary to gov
ernment policy.
Oeatli Penalty
One of the stricter paragraphs of the law de
clares that the penalty for writing a political
slogan on a wall which is public property is, at
minimum, five years in prison, and at maximum,
death.
In spite of these laws the government professes
not to understand non-white resentment. The
government points out correctly that non-whites
in South Africa are more highly paid, hold better
jobs, and enjoy higher living standards than non
whites anywhere else in Africa.
But the difference between the whites and the
non-whites in South Africa is the greatest on the
continent. Though the non-white may be absolutely
better off, relatively he is farther from the top.
Apartheid False
Nonwhites in the other nations of Africa look
forward to independence whiJe those in the South
look forward to apartheid. And for the non-white,
apartheid is a false doctrine. It promises self
government in the traditions of the race. But it also
necessitates continuing the present economic re
lationship. It was this relationship cheap black,
unskilled labor working for white factory owners
which destroyed the black man's traditional, agrar
ian life. The black man needs new roots and he
does not believe he can find them in apartheid.

forward to independence whiJe those in the South
look forward to apartheid. And for the non-white,
apartheid is a false doctrine. It promises self
government in the traditions of the race. But it also
necessitates continuing the present economic re
lationship. It was this relationship cheap black,
unskilled labor working for white factory owners
which destroyed the black man's traditional, agrar
ian life. The black man needs new roots and he
does not believe he can find them in apartheid.
Arms Stopped
Though the United States and United Kingdom
stopped shipping arms to South Africa in January,
1964, they remain the country's main suppliers of
strategic materials. The United States bases its
support of the South African regime on two points.
One, the present government is the only possible
stable one, and two, an embargo would hurt the
blacks it intends to help.
The black leaders themselves have said they pre
fer not to be protected from embargo by the
United States. Their lot, they say, is already bad
enough. However there is some truth to the U.S.
assertion that the blacks, if they took over, could
not maintain order. Their leaders spend most of
their time in jail for past offenses or "communist"
activities.
In June, 1963, President Kennedy said, "Is peace
not in the last analysis a matter of human rights?"
This seems to be the core of the problem. The
white demands the right to maintain his achieve
ment as it is. The black man demands the opening
of the market to competition so that the black I
can share in the country's wealth, not according to |
what the white man would like to allow him.
but according to how much his energy can develop.
The energy of the black is what the white man
fears most.
Ninety per cent of the people in the world are
either non-Christian, non-white, or non-democratic\
For those who believe Christianity, whiteness,
and democracy are the pillars of western civiliza
tion, this century has posed horrible questions.
Christian theologians have admitted more openly
the authenticity of Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, and
Confucian religions. Existential stoicism has ques
tioned the need for any formal religion at all.
Whiteness Out
Whiteness is, in African and Asiatic countries,
more often associated with imperalism than eman
cipation. In many parts of Africa and Asia, people
utter "European" with the same ugliness thai
Americans utter "Nigger,"
Democracy can no longer be simply the greatest
good for the greatest number. If elections can put
Hitler in power, what safeguards are necessary to
prevent Ihe manipulation of the unconscious and
the emotional?
The inertia of the larger nations to change
increases the chances that new answers to the
problems of politics and economics must come
from the countries willing to experiment with new
systems. The newness of the African nations leaves
them very open to experiment.
Peak of Power
It is possible that the white nations are near the
peak of their power. China has 150,000,000 children
in elementary school. Africa has 26 nations shoving
clumsily but enthusiastically for independence and
automony. And it is shallow of the white man to
see India's and South America's demands for neu
trality as a device to play off one large power
against the other. Inside neutrality is the demand
for national equality, independence, and dignity.
The rising colored nations have a voice, and it
is demanding. The voices of the rising colored na
tions are eloquent and demanding. Chief Luthuli,
of the South African Bantus, spoke to the world in
his Nobel lecture of 1961.
"In government, we will not be satisfied with
anything less than direct individual adult suffrage.
In economic matters, we will be satisfied with
nothing less than equality of opportunity in every
sphere. In culture, we will be satisfied with nothing
less than the opening ot' all doors of learning to
non-segregatory institutions on the sole criterion
of ability. In the social sphere, we will be satisfied
with nothing less than the abolition of all racial
bars. We do not demand these things for people
of African descent alone. We demand them for all
South Africans, white and black."
Apartheid
The white government in South Africa, now
solidly in power since only whites can vole, prac
tices apartheid, a policy designed to separate the
races of the Republic of South Africa from one
another in all spheres but the economic. One may
view apartheid generally as one method of hand
ling the confrontation of races or cultures.
But one cannot understand the problem in gen
eral terms only. The government of South Africa
correctly claims its troubles and solutions are
unique.
The population of the Republic of South Africa
is 17,065,000. 11,900,000 of those are black Africans,
called by the government Bantus. These are the
African tribes who have migrated down from
the North attracted by the white man's factory.
Whites Outnumbered
South Africa has 3,250,000 whites. Of these,
about 60 per cent are of Dutch descent, calling
themselves Africaaners and speaking Africaans.
These were the earliest settlers to the tip of the
dark continent. While their ancestors in the Dutch
East India Company established the first white
colony at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652, only a
handful of natives was to be found in all of what
is now the Republic. The situation is closely analog
ous to that of the English settlors landing about
the same year in Massachusetts, half way around
the world.
Whereas in Massachusetts the whites eventually
outnumbered and overpowered the Indians, in
South Africa, the Dutch held one area, maintained
domination, and employed increasing numbers of
Bantus in factories.
Between 1806 and 1910 the British had control of
the Cape, and it is from this period that the pres
ent British whites in the South descend.

Hottentots
Besides the Bantus and the whites, the third
large race is the coloreds, descendents of the in
digenous Hottentots, Maylays, and the people of
mixed blood. The coloreds, who number 1,648,000,
speak either English or Africaans.
In addition, some 522,000 Asians inhabit tlie
South. Most are descendents of Indians brought
in by the British to work on sugar plantations.
Today in South Africa the white minority -is
fighting for its existence. The means it has em
ployed to realize even the first stages of the apart
heid policy have inflamed native resentment.
Best for Blacks
The South African government says apartheid
is the only way to preserve the white man's
achievement. It is also, it claims, the best policy
for the non-white. Apartheid promises self-govern
ment and a higher than average living standard
forthe Bantus.
The Bantus, however, want more than a higher
than average living standard. They want total in
tegration, One Man, One Vote. So far they have
neither the vote, nor much hope of getting it. The
South African government is racing black resent
ment. The whites say that once the non-white sees
how good apartheid is, he will be content. The
problem is keeping him in line until he sees how
happy he will he.
In 1962 the parliament, by passing the General
Law Amendment Act, authorized the Minister of
Justice to "list as a communist" any person whom
he considers working toward any of the aims of
communism (no evidence is required) or toward
any social and economic change contrary to gov
ernment policy.
Oeatli Penalty
One of the stricter paragraphs of the law de
clares that the penalty for writing a political
slogan on a wall which is public property is, at
minimum, five years in prison, and at maximum,
death.
In spite of these laws the government professes
not to understand non-white resentment. The
government points out correctly that non-whites
in South Africa are more highly paid, hold better
jobs, and enjoy higher living standards than non
whites anywhere else in Africa.
But the difference between the whites and the
non-whites in South Africa is the greatest on the
continent. Though the non-white may be absolutely
better off, relatively he is farther from the top.
