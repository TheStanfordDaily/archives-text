# The 						Controversy On Apartheid
## Inevitable Doctrine 
### 
The source of apartheid was
the confrontation of white and
black at the southern tip of Afri
ca more than 300 years ago.
At the same time settlers in Mas
sachusetts were breaking the new
world soil, the Dutch established !
a supply station at the Cape of j
Good Hope. Both areas were j
sparsely inhabited by uncivilized j
natives, in Massachusetts by the,
Indians, in South Africa by the
Bushmen and the Hottentots.
In the new world the w hi te j
wave pushed the Indian west and j
south finally isolating him on
patches of unused government j
land. Today he is encouraged to|
Americanize.
On the dark continent t here
was no white wave. The Dutch j
settlers secured only the tip of
Africa, cultivated it, industrial-j
ized, civilized it. The wave in j
Africa was black, sweeping from
north to south when the crops
1 failed, or the land dried up.
The Black's Role
The black could always find
work in the white man's factory,
and land on which to live near
! the white man's city. He came to j
the south as freely as man ever |
leaves his home and his roots.
With time the blacks outnum
; bered the whites. The ratio today
is four to one. The blacks, now
swept up in the general African
tide for independence, are de-j
manding political lights. What is
to become of the white man who;
! built the cities to which the Afri-;
leans swarmed?
Dr. Hilgard Muller, foreign min- 1
ister for the Republic of South i
Africa, has described apartheid
as "in accordance with the funda
mental philosophies of the West.
We do not deny the individuality
I and dignity of man. What we do
say — what our unique situation
has taught us to say — is that
each man has his dignity and his
individuality within the society
that he understands, which is his
own."
Apartheid is the struggle for
existence of the Dutch whites in I
South Africa. Dr. H. F. Verwoerd,!
Prime Minister has posed the j
question most bluntly, "Cannot j
you understand us fighting to the
j death for our existence?"
Argument for Apartheid
The argument for apartheid
goes farther than the preserva
tion of the whites. It argues for
maximum progress of coloureds j
and blacks alike.
i he liuai result of apartheid is!
Uul uncertain. It aims at some
thing like a commonwealth of na- ,
tions or an economic common
market in South Africa. Blacks
will rule their prescribed sectors :
autonomously as will the col-;
oureds and whites. The separate j
nations will cooperate economi- 1
cally. but each will be free to
live in its own culture, its own
society.
The South African government
emphasizes that apartheid is nol
synonomous with the now d i s
credited United States policy of j
"separate but equal." That policy
assumes equal political rights un- 1
der the same constitution for'
black and white. Apartheid re-i
quires separate constitutions and
therefore different political rights.
The white man is not to be equal
to the black, he is to be respon- '
sible for him.
The world outside South Africa j
has almost unanimously con
demned apartheid as an oppres- i
sive policy, conducted brutally, to |
preserve white supremacy in a ;
black land.
Government 's Answer
To these arguments the govern- i
ment of South Africa answers!
first that the situation is such
that no policy the government !
could adopt would win world ap-!
proval. Unless t he blacks are
tightly controlled they will de-!
stroy the white man and his prog-1
ress.
The irresponsible outsider can-1
not suggest any "less immoral"
approach to black encroachment
on white ground.
The white government is the;
last African outpost of anti-corn- j
munism. M. L. T. Taswell, South !

African Ambassador to the United
States, warns that "Roughly one
third of Peking's foreign diplo
matic missions are in African i
countries."
Black Reds
The government points to the
number of communists in the
black opposition parties, and Tas
vvcll adds thai "The Chinese pol
icy is based on color. It is anti
white."
Not only is South Africa safely
anti-communist, it is also capi
talist. Ambassador Taswell points j
out that, South Africa is the con-j
tinent's most prosperous country.
"In many newly independent
African states, the story has been i
one of the establishment of one-1
party dictatorships, of the sup-1
pression on justice and freedom
of the press, of falling standards)
of living, health, and education, i
of collapsing economies.
"Striking proof of how favor- 1
'ib!e conditions are in South Afri-i
ca is given by the fact that thou-!
sands of Africans are constantly !
streaming illegally across our
borders in order to seek the su- 1
perior benefits which South i
Africa can offer. Over one mil-1
lion foreign Africans are in our j
country that is 10 per cent of!
the Bantu population."
Some critics have proposed that
the South African government
follow the lead of other white
governments in Africa and edu
cate the blacks to political liberty j
and the vote.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The follow
ing; is a summary, to,the best
of the writer's ability, of the
arguments for and against
apartheid. It does not reflect the
personal views of the writer
but is printed first of all to air
points on both sides. More im
portant, however, are the as
sumptions on both sides con
cerning- the nature of democ-

mo.st. The whites expect no quar
t er.
To the Dutch of South Africa,
the land is as much their home,
their nation, their culture, as
Massachusetts is the home, state,
and culture of its long-time white
inhabitants.
The notion of collective selfish
ness does not seem Christian.
Charles A. W. Manning, pro- j
fessor emeritus of International!
Relations at the London School of j
Economics and a supporter ofj
apartheid, has said, "Not only is
it difficult to conceive of a Chris-1
tion nation, in the sense of a na-!
tion capable of giving its all for)
others; it is even difficult 1o ar
gue that the democratic system !
of government is a Christian svs-1
tern. For here, too, collective sel-;
fishness is enthroned; it is as
sumed, correctly of course, that j
men in general, when given a i
vote, will use it to suit their
group, thei)- section of society; |
they will not use it to manifest j
sacrificial love."
From the white man's point of'
view, apartheid is, Manning says,
"in part dictated by a passionate
concern for the future of a Euro
pean-type white society, and no
doubt that society's right to self
preservation is itself a matter for
debate. But it is this, not the prin
ciple of apartheid, which thus is
the matter for debate. Concede
to the white man a right to pre
serve his achievement, and some
such policy as partheid may well
appear as an inevitable corollary."
In summing up apartheid for!
the government, Manning says,
"The philosophy of apartheid is!
the standpoint of politicians who, I
having no mandate for effecting
the liquidation of so-called white j
supremacy, must do the best they
can, in circumstances where
nothing they may realistically!
contemplate can be expected to (
win them the approval of the
world."

racy, the right of the white man
tt> preserve his achievement un
changed, asid the solutions pro
posed to the problems which
always arise when races and
cultures collide. Consideration
of these assumptions is as im
portant for America confront
ing: the Negro and the Chinese
as they are for South African
whites confronting- Africans.
