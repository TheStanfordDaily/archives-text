South Africa has three mil
lion whites and 11 milion blacks.
The per capita income of the
whites is $1,819 a year. The per
capita income of the blacks $109
a year. Whites are subject to
taxation between the ages of 21
and 60. Blacks are taxed from
18 to 65. Whites earning less than
840 dollars a year are exempt
from taxes. All black income is
taxed.
White men occupy exclusively
87 per cent of the land. 340,000
whites are registered in trade
unions. Blacks are not allowed to
organize.
Apartheid Helps All
The arguments against apart
heid fall into three groups; the na
ture of the policy, the means used
to implement it, and danger of
mass revolt to which those means
have contributed.
Apartheid, though it claims to
benefit the black man as well as
the white, leaves no choice to the
black but to live a life alien to
his agrarian and tribal condi
tions. Completed apartheid will
find thousands of blacks living in
their own segregated sectors,
commuting to white sectors to
work in factories owned by white
men. Apartheid will preserve the
white man's culture and tradi
tions. It will convert black Afri
can life into segrated and under
privileged suburbianism, com
pletely dependent upon the white
man's wages. The black man will
have no bargaining power.
If the result or apartheid is un
desirable, the means the govern
ment employs to effect it are in
sufferable.
The legislation begins in 1950

with the "Group Areas Act" re
quiring separation of racial
groups to designated areas of the
republic. The whites are required
to move the least.
Race Classification
To ensure each person getting
into the proper area, the govern
ment has classified citizens ac
cording to race. Sometimes mem
bers of the same family will be
classified to different races.
In 1963, the government ex
tended to women the requirement
to carry identification booklets
at all times. Penalties for either
not carrying booklets or being in
an area not authorized by the
booklet draws fines, imprison
ment, or whippings.
The system becomes frustrat
ingly illogical at the lower levels.
One case history tells of two
young boys whose parents were
working in the city to make ends
meet. The boys were sent, to live
with their grandparents in the
country.
No Place to Go
When the children were old
enough to work they returned
to the city where the police dis
covered them and endorsed them
out because they had not lived
there long enough. When they re
turned to Ihe country they were
endorsed out again because they
had spent their childhood in the
city. They have no legal place to
live and they may not leave the
country without government per
mission.
In 1956 the parliament passed
ihe "Industrial Conciliation Act"
restricting certain occupations to
members of certain races. Blacks
are confined to unskilled labor.
!H> Ihiys Without Charge
To keep possible agitators in
line, the government passed in
1963 the "General Law Amend
ment Act." It enables any police
officer to hold for 90 days with
out charge and without trial any
person ho suspects to have infor

mation connected with political
offenses.
Political prisoners are kept in
j solitary confinement and allowed
to speak to no one.
Numerous political offenses
which were lawful at the time of
| their commission have, since 1963,
become retrospectively punishable
; by death or long terms of im
; prisonment.
A harsh example is the stipula
■ tion that any person who. after
1950 has undergone in a foreign
I country any training (military or
I otherwise) which could be used
for the subversion of the State
can be hanged unless he can prove
I that he did not undergo such
| training or obtain the informa
! tion for furthering the aims of
communism. The aims of corn-
I munism are defined by the State.
Torture
Arrest is not only frequent, it
is painful. In a recent case involv
ing an alleged murder of an Afri
! can prisoner by a white police
man, a white police constable
I said, "I don't think there is a
I police station in the country that
! does not use violence during ques
tioning."
The opposition groups in South
I Africa, all of which have been
j banned as official parties by the
government, have come to feel
that no legal means now exist
by which blacks can speak.
The first opposition group is
the Liberal Party, whose presi
' dent is Alan Pat on, author of Cry.
the Beloved Country. Though the
party has not been banned out
i right, its membership is predom
i inantly black, and blacks cannot
! vote. Non-white elements have
j had to turn to illegal opposition.
Passive Resistance
The second major group is the
j African National Congress. The
I party was dedicated to passive re-
J sistence on the Indian model, but
I frustration split its forces. The
j splinter group is called the Pan
j African Congress.
Both the Pan-African Congress
' (PAC) and the African National
Congress (ANC) practice non
| violent resistence. PAC, however,
| sees non-violence as a convenient
; tactic and is not opposed in prin
j ciple to violent action. ANC is
! non-violent in principle, hut the
l government is straining its mem
■ bcrs' patience.
The third group of reformist
j forces are the terrorist organiza
! tions; the National liberation
j Committee, the Spear of the Na
tion, and Poqo. The last is the
I most dramatic and draws the
! greatest number to its activities.
!It also serves the government's
I purposes. Any Poqo members
! found at rallies or demonstrations
automatically label the activity
terrorist, and the government
troops surpress it.
There is no legal means of
bringing pressure on the govern
ment from the inside. Blacks have
; two courses open to them, out
; side intervention and internal
! revolution.
i The white government is pre
| pared for both eventualities.
The Military
The defense expenditures have
tripled since 1961. The permanent
j army has almost doubled. J. J.
• Fouche, Minister of Defense, has
| said that South Africa had 140,-
j 000 men in uniform at the end
! of 1964. "Our aim." he said, "is to
; train every young man for mili
tary service whether he is flat
i footed or not."
The memory of that force will
haunt the black man even if the
| government should succeed in
| establishing apartheid complete
j ly. The memory will breed resent
i ment which will require continued
; oppression of black by white for
as long as the two are on oppos
; ing sides of apartheid's wall,
j Oppression should stop. The cor
| rect reason for letting up is com
1 passion for fellow human beings.
| No other should be necessary.
A more immediate reason is
; that oppression is forcing the
; blacks into a revolution which
; will destroy Hie white man.
In his effort to preserve his
achievement unchanged in South
Africa, the white man is commit
ting suicide.

lion whites and 11 milion blacks.

One case history tells of two
young boys whose parents were
working in the city to make ends

with their grandparents in the
country.
No Place to Go
When the children were old
enough to work they returned
to the city where the police dis
covered them and endorsed them
out because they had not lived
there long enough. When they re
turned to Ihe country they were
endorsed out again because they
had spent their childhood in the
city. They have no legal place to
live and they may not leave the
country without government per
mission.
In 1956 the parliament passed
ihe "Industrial Conciliation Act"
restricting certain occupations to
members of certain races. Blacks
are confined to unskilled labor.

To keep possible agitators in

1963 the "General Law Amend

officer to hold for 90 days with

person ho suspects to have infor

offenses.
Political prisoners are kept in

Torture
Arrest is not only frequent, it
is painful. In a recent case involv
ing an alleged murder of an Afri
! can prisoner by a white police
man, a white police constable
I said, "I don't think there is a
I police station in the country that
! does not use violence during ques
tioning."
The opposition groups in South
I Africa, all of which have been
j banned as official parties by the
government, have come to feel
that no legal means now exist
by which blacks can speak.
The first opposition group is
the Liberal Party, whose presi
' dent is Alan Pat on, author of Cry.
the Beloved Country. Though the
party has not been banned out
i right, its membership is predom
i inantly black, and blacks cannot
! vote. Non-white elements have
j had to turn to illegal opposition.
Passive Resistance
The second major group is the
j African National Congress. The
I party was dedicated to passive re-
J sistence on the Indian model, but
I frustration split its forces. The
j splinter group is called the Pan
j African Congress.
Both the Pan-African Congress
' (PAC) and the African National
Congress (ANC) practice non
| violent resistence. PAC, however,
| sees non-violence as a convenient
; tactic and is not opposed in prin
j ciple to violent action. ANC is
! non-violent in principle, hut the
l government is straining its mem
■ bcrs' patience.
The third group of reformist
j forces are the terrorist organiza
! tions; the National liberation
j Committee, the Spear of the Na
tion, and Poqo. The last is the
I most dramatic and draws the
! greatest number to its activities.
!It also serves the government's
I purposes. Any Poqo members
! found at rallies or demonstrations
automatically label the activity
terrorist, and the government
troops surpress it.
There is no legal means of
bringing pressure on the govern
ment from the inside. Blacks have
; two courses open to them, out
; side intervention and internal
! revolution.
i The white government is pre
| pared for both eventualities.
The Military
The defense expenditures have
tripled since 1961. The permanent
j army has almost doubled. J. J.
• Fouche, Minister of Defense, has
| said that South Africa had 140,-
j 000 men in uniform at the end
! of 1964. "Our aim." he said, "is to
; train every young man for mili
tary service whether he is flat
i footed or not."
The memory of that force will
haunt the black man even if the
| government should succeed in
| establishing apartheid complete
j ly. The memory will breed resent
i ment which will require continued
; oppression of black by white for
as long as the two are on oppos
; ing sides of apartheid's wall,
j Oppression should stop. The cor

1 passion for fellow human beings.
| No other should be necessary.
A more immediate reason is
; that oppression is forcing the
; blacks into a revolution which
; will destroy Hie white man.
In his effort to preserve his
achievement unchanged in South
Africa, the white man is commit
ting suicide.
South Africa has three mil
lion whites and 11 milion blacks.
The per capita income of the
whites is $1,819 a year. The per
capita income of the blacks $109
a year. Whites are subject to
taxation between the ages of 21
and 60. Blacks are taxed from
18 to 65. Whites earning less than
840 dollars a year are exempt
from taxes. All black income is
taxed.
White men occupy exclusively
87 per cent of the land. 340,000
whites are registered in trade
unions. Blacks are not allowed to
organize.
Apartheid Helps All
The arguments against apart
heid fall into three groups; the na
ture of the policy, the means used
to implement it, and danger of
mass revolt to which those means
have contributed.
Apartheid, though it claims to
benefit the black man as well as
the white, leaves no choice to the
black but to live a life alien to
his agrarian and tribal condi
tions. Completed apartheid will
find thousands of blacks living in
their own segregated sectors,
commuting to white sectors to
work in factories owned by white
men. Apartheid will preserve the
white man's culture and tradi
tions. It will convert black Afri
can life into segrated and under
privileged suburbianism, com
pletely dependent upon the white
man's wages. The black man will
have no bargaining power.
If the result or apartheid is un
desirable, the means the govern
ment employs to effect it are in
sufferable.
The legislation begins in 1950

with the "Group Areas Act" re
quiring separation of racial
groups to designated areas of the
republic. The whites are required
to move the least.
Race Classification
To ensure each person getting
into the proper area, the govern
ment has classified citizens ac
cording to race. Sometimes mem
bers of the same family will be
classified to different races.
In 1963, the government ex
tended to women the requirement
to carry identification booklets
at all times. Penalties for either
not carrying booklets or being in
an area not authorized by the
booklet draws fines, imprison
ment, or whippings.

government, have come to feel
that no legal means now exist
by which blacks can speak.
The first opposition group is
the Liberal Party, whose presi

the Beloved Country. Though the
party has not been banned out
i right, its membership is predom
i inantly black, and blacks cannot
! vote. Non-white elements have
j had to turn to illegal opposition.
Passive Resistance
The second major group is the
j African National Congress. The
I party was dedicated to passive re-
J sistence on the Indian model, but
I frustration split its forces. The
j splinter group is called the Pan
j African Congress.
Both the Pan-African Congress
' (PAC) and the African National
Congress (ANC) practice non
| violent resistence. PAC, however,
| sees non-violence as a convenient

j ciple to violent action. ANC is

■ bcrs' patience.
The third group of reformist
j forces are the terrorist organiza

I most dramatic and draws the

!It also serves the government's
I purposes. Any Poqo members
! found at rallies or demonstrations
automatically label the activity
terrorist, and the government
troops surpress it.
There is no legal means of
bringing pressure on the govern

; two courses open to them, out
; side intervention and internal
! revolution.
i The white government is pre
| pared for both eventualities.
The Military
The defense expenditures have
tripled since 1961. The permanent
j army has almost doubled. J. J.
• Fouche, Minister of Defense, has
| said that South Africa had 140,-
j 000 men in uniform at the end
! of 1964. "Our aim." he said, "is to
; train every young man for mili
tary service whether he is flat
i footed or not."
The memory of that force will
haunt the black man even if the
| government should succeed in
| establishing apartheid complete
j ly. The memory will breed resent
i ment which will require continued
; oppression of black by white for
as long as the two are on oppos
; ing sides of apartheid's wall,
j Oppression should stop. The cor

1 passion for fellow human beings.
| No other should be necessary.
A more immediate reason is
; that oppression is forcing the
; blacks into a revolution which
; will destroy Hie white man.
In his effort to preserve his
achievement unchanged in South
Africa, the white man is commit
ting suicide.
South Africa has three mil
lion whites and 11 milion blacks.
The per capita income of the
whites is $1,819 a year. The per
capita income of the blacks $109
a year. Whites are subject to
taxation between the ages of 21
and 60. Blacks are taxed from
18 to 65. Whites earning less than
840 dollars a year are exempt
from taxes. All black income is
taxed.
White men occupy exclusively
87 per cent of the land. 340,000
whites are registered in trade
unions. Blacks are not allowed to
organize.
Apartheid Helps All
The arguments against apart
heid fall into three groups; the na
ture of the policy, the means used
to implement it, and danger of
mass revolt to which those means
have contributed.
Apartheid, though it claims to
benefit the black man as well as
the white, leaves no choice to the
black but to live a life alien to
his agrarian and tribal condi
tions. Completed apartheid will
find thousands of blacks living in
their own segregated sectors,
commuting to white sectors to
work in factories owned by white
men. Apartheid will preserve the
white man's culture and tradi
tions. It will convert black Afri
can life into segrated and under
privileged suburbianism, com
pletely dependent upon the white
man's wages. The black man will
have no bargaining power.
If the result or apartheid is un
desirable, the means the govern
ment employs to effect it are in
sufferable.
The legislation begins in 1950

with the "Group Areas Act" re
quiring separation of racial
groups to designated areas of the
republic. The whites are required
to move the least.
Race Classification
To ensure each person getting
into the proper area, the govern
ment has classified citizens ac
cording to race. Sometimes mem
bers of the same family will be
classified to different races.
In 1963, the government ex
tended to women the requirement
to carry identification booklets
at all times. Penalties for either
not carrying booklets or being in
an area not authorized by the
booklet draws fines, imprison
ment, or whippings.
The system becomes frustrat
ingly illogical at the lower levels.
One case history tells of two
young boys whose parents were
working in the city to make ends
meet. The boys were sent, to live
with their grandparents in the
country.
No Place to Go
When the children were old
enough to work they returned
to the city where the police dis
covered them and endorsed them
out because they had not lived
there long enough. When they re
turned to Ihe country they were
endorsed out again because they
had spent their childhood in the
city. They have no legal place to
live and they may not leave the
country without government per
mission.
In 1956 the parliament passed
ihe "Industrial Conciliation Act"
restricting certain occupations to
members of certain races. Blacks
are confined to unskilled labor.
!H> Ihiys Without Charge
To keep possible agitators in
line, the government passed in
1963 the "General Law Amend
ment Act." It enables any police
officer to hold for 90 days with
out charge and without trial any
person ho suspects to have infor

mation connected with political
offenses.
Political prisoners are kept in
j solitary confinement and allowed
to speak to no one.
Numerous political offenses
which were lawful at the time of
| their commission have, since 1963,
become retrospectively punishable
; by death or long terms of im
; prisonment.
A harsh example is the stipula
■ tion that any person who. after
1950 has undergone in a foreign
I country any training (military or
I otherwise) which could be used
for the subversion of the State
can be hanged unless he can prove
I that he did not undergo such
| training or obtain the informa
! tion for furthering the aims of
communism. The aims of corn-
I munism are defined by the State.
Torture
Arrest is not only frequent, it
is painful. In a recent case involv
ing an alleged murder of an Afri
! can prisoner by a white police
man, a white police constable
I said, "I don't think there is a
I police station in the country that

A more immediate reason is
; that oppression is forcing the
; blacks into a revolution which
; will destroy Hie white man.
In his effort to preserve his
achievement unchanged in South
Africa, the white man is commit
ting suicide.
South Africa has three mil
lion whites and 11 milion blacks.
The per capita income of the
whites is $1,819 a year. The per
capita income of the blacks $109
a year. Whites are subject to
taxation between the ages of 21
and 60. Blacks are taxed from
18 to 65. Whites earning less than
840 dollars a year are exempt
from taxes. All black income is
taxed.
White men occupy exclusively
87 per cent of the land. 340,000
whites are registered in trade
unions. Blacks are not allowed to
organize.
Apartheid Helps All
The arguments against apart
heid fall into three groups; the na
ture of the policy, the means used
to implement it, and danger of
mass revolt to which those means
have contributed.
Apartheid, though it claims to
benefit the black man as well as
the white, leaves no choice to the
black but to live a life alien to
his agrarian and tribal condi
tions. Completed apartheid will
find thousands of blacks living in
their own segregated sectors,
commuting to white sectors to
work in factories owned by white
men. Apartheid will preserve the
white man's culture and tradi
tions. It will convert black Afri
can life into segrated and under
privileged suburbianism, com
pletely dependent upon the white
man's wages. The black man will
have no bargaining power.
If the result or apartheid is un
desirable, the means the govern
ment employs to effect it are in
sufferable.
The legislation begins in 1950

with the "Group Areas Act" re
quiring separation of racial
groups to designated areas of the
republic. The whites are required
to move the least.
Race Classification
To ensure each person getting
into the proper area, the govern
ment has classified citizens ac
cording to race. Sometimes mem
bers of the same family will be
classified to different races.
In 1963, the government ex
tended to women the requirement
to carry identification booklets
at all times. Penalties for either
not carrying booklets or being in
an area not authorized by the
booklet draws fines, imprison
ment, or whippings.
The system becomes frustrat
ingly illogical at the lower levels.
One case history tells of two
young boys whose parents were
working in the city to make ends
meet. The boys were sent, to live
with their grandparents in the
country.
No Place to Go
When the children were old
enough to work they returned
to the city where the police dis
covered them and endorsed them
out because they had not lived
there long enough. When they re
turned to Ihe country they were
endorsed out again because they
had spent their childhood in the
city. They have no legal place to
live and they may not leave the
country without government per
mission.
In 1956 the parliament passed
ihe "Industrial Conciliation Act"
restricting certain occupations to
members of certain races. Blacks
are confined to unskilled labor.
!H> Ihiys Without Charge
To keep possible agitators in
line, the government passed in
1963 the "General Law Amend
ment Act." It enables any police
officer to hold for 90 days with
out charge and without trial any
person ho suspects to have infor

mation connected with political
offenses.
Political prisoners are kept in
j solitary confinement and allowed
to speak to no one.
Numerous political offenses
which were lawful at the time of
| their commission have, since 1963,
become retrospectively punishable
; by death or long terms of im
; prisonment.
A harsh example is the stipula
■ tion that any person who. after
1950 has undergone in a foreign
I country any training (military or
I otherwise) which could be used
for the subversion of the State
can be hanged unless he can prove
I that he did not undergo such
| training or obtain the informa
! tion for furthering the aims of
communism. The aims of corn-
I munism are defined by the State.
Torture
Arrest is not only frequent, it
is painful. In a recent case involv
ing an alleged murder of an Afri
! can prisoner by a white police
man, a white police constable
I said, "I don't think there is a
I police station in the country that
! does not use violence during ques
tioning."
The opposition groups in South
I Africa, all of which have been
j banned as official parties by the
government, have come to feel
that no legal means now exist
by which blacks can speak.
The first opposition group is
the Liberal Party, whose presi
' dent is Alan Pat on, author of Cry.
the Beloved Country. Though the
party has not been banned out
i right, its membership is predom
i inantly black, and blacks cannot
! vote. Non-white elements have
j had to turn to illegal opposition.
Passive Resistance
The second major group is the
j African National Congress. The
I party was dedicated to passive re-
J sistence on the Indian model, but
I frustration split its forces. The
j splinter group is called the Pan
j African Congress.
Both the Pan-African Congress
' (PAC) and the African National
Congress (ANC) practice non
| violent resistence. PAC, however,
| sees non-violence as a convenient
; tactic and is not opposed in prin
j ciple to violent action. ANC is
! non-violent in principle, hut the
l government is straining its mem
■ bcrs' patience.
The third group of reformist
j forces are the terrorist organiza
! tions; the National liberation
j Committee, the Spear of the Na
tion, and Poqo. The last is the
I most dramatic and draws the
! greatest number to its activities.
!It also serves the government's
I purposes. Any Poqo members
! found at rallies or demonstrations
automatically label the activity
terrorist, and the government
troops surpress it.
There is no legal means of
bringing pressure on the govern
ment from the inside. Blacks have
; two courses open to them, out
; side intervention and internal
! revolution.
i The white government is pre
| pared for both eventualities.
The Military
The defense expenditures have
tripled since 1961. The permanent
j army has almost doubled. J. J.
• Fouche, Minister of Defense, has
| said that South Africa had 140,-
j 000 men in uniform at the end
! of 1964. "Our aim." he said, "is to
; train every young man for mili
tary service whether he is flat
i footed or not."
The memory of that force will
haunt the black man even if the
| government should succeed in
| establishing apartheid complete
j ly. The memory will breed resent
i ment which will require continued
; oppression of black by white for
as long as the two are on oppos
