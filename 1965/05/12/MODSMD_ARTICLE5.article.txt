# Sweeney Defines Social Freedom

### NANCY L. STEFFEN Editor (Second in a Series 
"There are a lot of angry people in SNCC," Dennis Sweeney ex
plained, "People who want to tear down the system that has denied
them so much for so long."
"But then there are people like Bob (Moses)," he continued,
"who see the problem as a question of freedom and who want to
find new models and systems which allow people to articulate their
anger . . . These are people who are interested in the content of the
word freedom and want it means for our society."
In the course of nearly a year of service as a civil lights worker
in Mississippi, this "interest in the content of the word freedom" has
become Sweeney's own.
In defining freedom -or the lack of it. in our society—Sweeney
emphasized the psyhcological barriers—the fear and reticence
which, lie said, too often prevent an individual from being "truly
free" though he is in full possession of his constitutional "civil
rights."
"Democratic politics relies on people who are not only informed
but unafraid," he explained, "and not just unafraid of physical
threats, but truly unafraid because they have a kind of self-knowl
edge . . . The whole question of intimiation and fear goes much
deeper than it seems to at first."
"For example," he continued, "what does it mean for a demo
cratic society when people don't speak out in public meetings or
when people don't ask questions in class? . . . Maybe we've reached
the point when we can no longer criticize our society."
Sweeney and many others in SNCC see Mississippi as a misroeosm
of the larger American society: "Its policies, its racism, its religion
are only exaggerations of the way things are everywhere else."
Concomitantly, SNCC sees its work in Mississippi as a pioneer
effort to reform American society along what < it» would regard
as more humanly viable and more fundamentally democratic lines.
In this effort, SNCC seems to work from the belief that the major
flaw in the existing American political system is that the great
majority of decisions affecting the lives of the great majority of
people are made not by the many but by the powerful and unrep
resentative few. "People are no longer involved in shaping their own
lives," Sweeney said.
This apparent discovery oJ the "uni'eprcsentativencss" of the
ostensibly representative American political system, was, according
to Sweeney, the disillusioning lesson that SNCC and the MFDP took
away from their "confrontations with the white power structure,"
first at the democratic convention at Atlantic City and later during
the MFDP's congressional challenge.
"The one thing we really learned ;il Atlantic City," Sweeney said,
"is that politics isn't ;ill it's cracked up 1r» be."
