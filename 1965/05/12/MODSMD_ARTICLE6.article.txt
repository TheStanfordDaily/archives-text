# Trustees Will Consider New Co-ed Housing Units
## Wert Announces Moore-Jacks Halls 
### MICHAEL COHEN 
The Hoard of Trustees will consider a proposal lor two coedu
cational dormitories at its meeting May 20, Dean of Undergraduate
Education Robert J. Wert announced yesterday.
In an interview with The Daily Dean Wert said that the sub
committee on housing of the Committee on Undergraduate Edti-

: cation presented a proposal lory
the two dormitories to the Aca
demic Affairs Committee of tlie >
S Board last month.
j If the Academic Affairs Com-1
mittee approves, then subsequent I
I approvals must be sought from [
the Building and Grounds a n d
Finance Committees as well as
the full Board.
Two Innovations
Dean Wert felt that the entire}
i approval process might be com
pleted as early as the Trustees'!
i June meeting. The University j
would then be empowered to ap-'
propriate funds, seek federal;
help in the financing of the proj
ect, and appoint an architect.
The two dormitories, to bej
called Robert Moore and Mar-!
garet Jacks Halls, would embody'
two revolutionary innovations in i
Stanford's undergraduate hous- j
ing program. Not only would the ;
j dormitories have coeducational
! dining, recreation and study fa-1
I cilities, but they would also par- j
ticipate in ihe most extensive i
academic program ever imple- j
merited in a Stanford living I
group.
The two dormitories would be
J identical. Each would consist of
four separate living units two |
I for men and two for women
'connected U> a central unit hous-,
ing dining facilities, recreational
facilities, a lounge, study and a 1
guest-in-residenee apartment.
280 Students per Hall
Each of the four separate liv- ,
ing units would contain its own !
! lounge and seminar room, as well
as two tutor's suites, a faculty
; residence, and rooms for seventy
j students.
Student rooms will resemble
{ those of Fraternity Cluster 11.
: There will be singles, two-room .
suites for two persons, and three-!
I room suites for four persons ac-j
; cording to the plan under consid
eration.

In addition to four faculty resi
dents (one in each of the four
living units), each hall would also
have a faculty master, who would
be a senior faculty member with
full control over the dormitory
and its academic program.
Classes in the Dorms
Dean Wert foresees the pos
sibility of teaching senior collo
quia and other small seminar
courses in the seminar rooms
which are planned for each liv
ing unit.
He pointed out that the idea of
fusing education with housing
has been growing since the first
faculty apartments were added
during the construction of Wilbur
Hall.
"This program seems to be a
culmination, a logical conclusion,
in the development of Ihe inte
gration of academic affairs and
housing," he said.
Total cost for the two dormi
tories, if approved as proposed,
would be $8,500,000. They would
be by far the most, expensive
dormitories ever built at Stan
ford. but the 560 students they
would house would not live in
luxury any greater than that af
forded present residents of the
fraternity clusters.
The great increase in cost is
flue almost completely to the ad
flit ion of academic space and liv
ing space for the tutors, faculty
residents and masters who form
Ihe nucleus of the proposed aca
demic programs.

help in the financing of the proj

The two dormitories, to bej
called Robert Moore and Mar-!
garet Jacks Halls, would embody'
two revolutionary innovations in i
Stanford's undergraduate hous- j
ing program. Not only would the ;
j dormitories have coeducational
! dining, recreation and study fa-1
I cilities, but they would also par- j
ticipate in ihe most extensive i
academic program ever imple- j
merited in a Stanford living I
group.
The two dormitories would be
J identical. Each would consist of
four separate living units two |
I for men and two for women
'connected U> a central unit hous-,
ing dining facilities, recreational
facilities, a lounge, study and a 1
guest-in-residenee apartment.
280 Students per Hall
Each of the four separate liv- ,
ing units would contain its own !
! lounge and seminar room, as well
as two tutor's suites, a faculty
; residence, and rooms for seventy
j students.
Student rooms will resemble
{ those of Fraternity Cluster 11.
: There will be singles, two-room .
suites for two persons, and three-!
I room suites for four persons ac-j
; cording to the plan under consid
eration.

In addition to four faculty resi
dents (one in each of the four
living units), each hall would also
have a faculty master, who would
be a senior faculty member with
full control over the dormitory
and its academic program.
Classes in the Dorms
Dean Wert foresees the pos
sibility of teaching senior collo
quia and other small seminar
courses in the seminar rooms
which are planned for each liv
ing unit.
He pointed out that the idea of
fusing education with housing
has been growing since the first
faculty apartments were added
during the construction of Wilbur
Hall.
"This program seems to be a
culmination, a logical conclusion,
in the development of Ihe inte
gration of academic affairs and
housing," he said.
Total cost for the two dormi
tories, if approved as proposed,
would be $8,500,000. They would
be by far the most, expensive
dormitories ever built at Stan
ford. but the 560 students they
would house would not live in
luxury any greater than that af
forded present residents of the
fraternity clusters.
The great increase in cost is
flue almost completely to the ad
flit ion of academic space and liv
ing space for the tutors, faculty
residents and masters who form
Ihe nucleus of the proposed aca
demic programs.
The Hoard of Trustees will consider a proposal lor two coedu
cational dormitories at its meeting May 20, Dean of Undergraduate
Education Robert J. Wert announced yesterday.
In an interview with The Daily Dean Wert said that the sub
committee on housing of the Committee on Undergraduate Edti-

: cation presented a proposal lory
the two dormitories to the Aca
demic Affairs Committee of tlie >
S Board last month.
j If the Academic Affairs Com-1
mittee approves, then subsequent I
