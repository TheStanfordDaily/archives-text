### ANNETTE AMEND 
"Africa is a riven continent—torn in many ways—black against
white, tribe against tribe, old values against new.
Dr. Walter Goldsehmidt, professor of anthropology at U.C.L.A..
in a speech at Dinkclspicl last night presented the basic prob
lems of being an ordinary African today.

Dr. Goldschmidt, originator of"
the "Ways of Mankind" record
series and associate editor of the
American Anthropologist, spent
three years in Africa, mainly with
the Sebei tribe of Uganda, an
Afrean nation that received its
independence in 1962.
He emphasized the alienation
of the young African from his
traditional tribal mores and cul
tural values. The basic need of
an individual to "internalize" the
values of his society is extremely
difficult for the African, for ho
is forced to choose between old
and new values that cannot be
reconcilialed.
A young Masai wrote in the
New Yorker that when he went
home his people could not toler
ate his Western clothes and mod
ern attitudes. He said that he
could understand their pride for
it was his pride too, but when he
returned to the modern world he
was forced to adopt its values.
Thus as a young African he was
constantly torn between two
world and he could only think
that it would be that way always.
"It is as if the African were
set ripped of cultural meaning,"
Dr. Goldschmidt remarked. "Even
the traditional tribal sysmbols
are manipulated by modern Afri
can politicians for their own per
sonal advantage."
In closing he offered no "happy
ending." hut stated thai African

problems were real and needed to
be appreciated and undestood.
"There is a new set of cultures
emerging among the African
elite" . . . they wait no more, it is
they who are awaited.
