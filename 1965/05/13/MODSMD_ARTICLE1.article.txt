# Wilbur 'Faculty Master' Proposed
## 
### STEVE LEOPOLD Associate Editor 
Administrative responsibility for the Wilbur Hall system may
undergo a deeided ehange next year.
The Committee on Undergraduate Education lias aeeepted
tlie proposed "faculty-master" concept and, according to Kobert
Wert, Dean of Undergraduate Education, "there is a rather good
possibility of having one in Wil *

bur next year."
Wort also told The Daily that
the? job has beon offered to an
unidentified member of the fac-J
ulty, but that so far no final de-j
eision has been made.
The concept patterned after,
similar programs at Harvard and I
Yale would produce three in no- \
vat ions:
• It would both increase and!
concentrate the authority and
prestige of the person in charge
of Wilbur.
• It would shift responsibility
from a member of the administra- j
tion to a member of the faculty, j
• It would be a major step in
what Wert called a "move to j
blend the social and academic as
pects of residence living."
Seek Senior Faculty
The criteria for selection as fac
ulty-master are that he bo a sen
ior member of the faculty prob
ably a full professor, "a person of
some status in the community,"
someone interested in both edu
cation and students, and a person
willing to reduce his depart
mental commitment by one-half
and move his family into Wilbur.
The faculty-master will have
great authority, but the specifics
of his task are not yet clear, and
according to Wert, the guide
lines" laid down by the commit
tee probably will not be very
specific."
"We are aiming for a decentral
ized system," he continued, "a
system which will give the fac
ulty-master the freedom to ex
plore the whole Wilbur system
and appraise what is going on
there."
He acknowledged that the fac
ulty-master would have a domi
nant role in doterming who would
fill the new posts of Business
Manager and Counsellor and that
he would have the deciding voice
in choosing the six now faculty
resident associates in Wilbur next
year.
Sponsors To Stay
Wert did not think that the
sponsor system would necessar
ily come into review, nor did
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Education Robert Hind when he
was interviewed by The Daily.

However, Wert said that the fac
ulty-master would have the free
dom "to experiment with RA's,
TA's or anybody else to make the
system work."
At Ihc present time, according
to Doug Davis, Director of Wil
bur. "the focus is on the man;
the details of his various func
tions can wait."
The idea of a faculty-master
system has been under considera
tion most of the year. Wort said,
particularly in connection with
the proposed Robert Moore and
Margaret Jacks coeducational
residences. But the current effort
to install such a system in Wil
bur next year did not begin until,
recently.
A memo from Davis suggesting
that the present system where
by the director must spend ap
proximately half his time on busi
ness details should bo modified
collided with an exploratory
memo going down the adminis
trative chain which wanted to
know if Davis was interested in
the faculty-master program for
Wilbur.
Wert said that he was moved
to consider the change on such
short notice because 1) Davis had
informed the Administration that
he would not be director at Wil
bur next year, and 2) six faculty
residents would also not 100 re
turning. The subcommittee on Un
dergraduate Education — consist
ing of Deans Wert and Hind and
faculty members Eric Hutchin
son, Donald Kennedy and David
Tuttle—agreed, and Wert began
consulting with various members
of the Administration and faculty
on the question.
Students Not Consulted
Ho told The Daily that he did
not consult with any students di
rectly, although both Davis and
Dean of Men Robert Gordon did
talk to the present sponsors about
the proposal, and later relayed
their suggestions to Wert. "I
would like to have done more con
sulting, but there was the prob
lem of time."
Wert would not say to whom
he has offered the job; presently,
not even the members of the sub
committee know the man's name.
