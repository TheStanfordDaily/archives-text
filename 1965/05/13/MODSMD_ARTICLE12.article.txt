## 
### 
The Peruvian American Coun
cil for Educational Exchange is
again sponsoring a summer proj
ect in Peru. A meeting for all in
terested students will be held
at 8 p.m. tonight in the Fremont
Lounge, Stern.
Participants in the program
will assist in constructing schools,
clinics, recreation and commun
ity centers, and homes for the un
derprivileged children. They will
be working with blind and handi
capped children, teaching in
schools for the underprivileged,
doing social work in the slums,
and assisting at hospitals, clinics,
and social centers. Those with ex
perience in radio and T.V. will
have the opportunity to initiate
new educational and artistic pro
grams.
Student cost for participation
in the program is $289 from Miami.
There are departures also from
New York and Mexico City. Five
departure dates have been set in
late May, June, and early July.
Participants are required to work
at least seven weeks. A knowl
edge of Spanish is very useful
but not essential in all projects.
Bill Chandler, a senior in In
ternational Relations, has been
selected Group Leader for the
Stanford contingent. For furth
or information call him at 854-
