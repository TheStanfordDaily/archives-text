# Spring 'Ballers Climax Season Against Alums
## 
### 
Five weeks of sweat and jolts
j will come to a climax this Satur
day when Stanford's expectant
! spring footballers take on the
< Alumni. Game time is slated for
1:30 p.m. at Stanford Stadium.
Coach John Ralston, pleased
with a "real good spring," held a
j Red vs. White session in the
i Stadium last Saturday in prepara
i tion for this weekend's fray.
Wispy reserve quarterback Terry
DeSylvia once again led his much
larger charges to victory over the
mythical "first unit." DeSylvia,
who started seven games last
year for the Tribe, has had a fine
; spring, and will be giving All
i American candidate Dave Lewis
| a battle as top signal-caller.
The Alumni, generously sprin
! kled with ball players from the
: professional ranks, will be out to
| stop a four game varsity streak.
The Alumni won the first two
games in 19.19 and 1960, but have
failed to win since.
DeSylvia Lecl
It was a year ago that Terry
I DeSylvia capped another fine
spring season by leading tlie Var
j sity to a 38-19 victory over the
| old veterans. DeSylvia completed
| eight of ten aerials in that game
j for 122 yards and one touchdown
and gained an additional 26 yards
net on the ground and another
touchdown.
The Alums most effective weap
; on last year was the arm of qua-
I terback Dick Norman, who tossed
I thirteen completions in 18 at
i tempts for 169 yards. Norman
! will be back this year, and will be
joined by San Francisco 49er
j John Brodie and Dick Berg. On
, the receiving end of these bombs,
; will be such stars as ends Sam
j Morley and Gary Van Galder, and
| backs Dick Ragsdale and Jack
i Taylor.
Busy Defense
It will be a busy afternoon for
the Indian defensive secondary,

I made up of two veterans and a
i rookie. The vets are John Guil
j lory and Craig Ritchey, who
I snatched their share of enemy
passes last year and the rookie
is Dave Nelson, last year's frosh
I quarterback.
Leading the defensive charge
j for the Alums will be ex-AU-Amer
! ican Paul Wiggin, tackle at pres-
I ent for the NFL Champion Cieve
: land Browns. Along with Wiggin
will be Bob Nichols, Pittsburgh
draftee; Marvy Harris, Los An
geles Rams; Bob Howard, Kansas
City draftee; and Jack Chappie, a
49er pick.
Wiggin and his boys will have
; a strong, veteran backfield to
contend with. Lewis <6-2, 198) will
start at quarterback; Ray Hand-
I ley (6-1, 198) and Bob Blunt <;>
11, 184) will be at the halfback
slots; and John Read (6-0, 209)
will be ramming from the full
back position. All but Blunt start
ed last year, and Blunt saw
plenty of action.
Handley Seventh
Handley was seventh in the na
tion last year in rushing, netting
936 yards, while Read was num
ber-two ball carrier with 301 net
yards.
Clearing the way for the hack
field will be lettermen tackles
Fergus Flanagan and John Wil
bur and guard Bruce Kehrli.
Ends Blaine Nye and Donn Ren
wick are up from the Frosh, cen
ter Jim Mills is a red shirt, and
guard Rick Derby is a junior col
lege transfer.
Eight lettermen will start on
defense for the Indians. They in
clude tackles Gary Pettigrew and
Tom Ross, guards Mike Hibler
and Bill Ogle, and A1 Wilburn,
linebacker Bob Rath, and deep
backs Ritchey and Guillory. New
comers are end Roger Clay, line
backer Mike Pavko, and Nelson.
