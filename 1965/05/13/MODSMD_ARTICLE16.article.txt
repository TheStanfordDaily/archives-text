# AAWU Tennis This Weekend
## 
### 
The sixth annual AAVVU Ten
: nis Championships will begin to
' day at ]() a.m. in Los Angeles,
j The host school is USC, and
' matches will lie played on the Los
; Angeles Tennis Club courts. Two
! rounds of singles and two rounds
i of doubles matches are slated for
i today, with the finals to bo held
| Saturday afternoon.
Meanwhile, the women will be
separated from the men about as
far as possible, as they travel
north to the other extremity of
' the conference for the Second An
! nual Women's Championships.
The two-day affair will be held
| Friday and Saturday at the Uni
j versity of Washington.
The southerners, UCLA and
I USC, will probably be playing
j their perennial champion and
j contender roles, respectively. The
Uclan netmen are undefeated in
dual-meet competition this year,
but USC has still showed some
signs of the championship ways
which led them to the AAVVU and
NCAA championships last year.
Indians Spoliers
Stanford has been cast in the
j spoiler role. The Indians were
shut out by the Uclans earlier in
| the season, but have been playing
; good tennis since. If all goes well,
I the Tribe can possibly break the
| domination of conference tennis
which UCLA and USC have main
tained for the last eighteen years.
UCLA's Arthur Ashe, who lost
the title yast year to sometimes-
Davis-cupper Dennis Ralston, is
seeded first in the singles and
first in the doubles along with
teammate lan Crookenden. USC's
Tom Edlef.son, however, beat
Ashe last week and teamed with
Jerry Cromwell to upset the
Bruin's doubles combo.
The meet should be a real
scramble, but UCLA's depth is
expected to prevail.
