# A 						Clear Choice
## 
### 
Though one suspects it was not his intention,
Scott Mcßride, in his strange, eleventh-hour
veto of LASSU's proposed alternatives on the off
campus issues question, has set up a very clear
case for the defeat of what's left of this Friday's
referendum.
The initial petition, which now stands as the
sole proposition on the referendum ballot, would
summarily and without qualification prohibit the
government of the ASSU from taking "positions
on matters other than those pertaining to student
affairs on the Stanford campus."
It was produced in extreme haste in the heat
of an already hot political battle—produced, one
suspects, not so much to remedy a flaw in the
structure of the ASSU as to ereate a neat
partisan campaign issue.
II passed as is, the referendum would not
only effectively muzzle the ASSU on so-called
"off-campus issues" (issues which despite their
misnomer may often effect the freedom and
education of Stanford students in a very direct
manner), but moreover, in its limitation of ASSU
action to the ambiguously defined area of "stu
dent affairs," might possibly stiffle the expres
sion of student concern within the Stanford com
munity as well. (For example, did the makers
of the petition conceive of academic reform as
within the scope of "student affairs'?)

It is a thoroughly negative proposal.
Whatever the legality of its methods, last
Monday LASSU acted to provide tin* student
body with a considered and reasonable range
of choices on the off-campus issues question.
Particularly interesting—because it preserved
the representative integrity of LASSU while at
the same time allowing the student body oppor
tunity for dissent—was LASSUs second pro
posed alternative. This alternative would have
empowered LASSU to take stands on off-campus
issues which are of "deep concern" to 11 ic stu
dent body and "within the knowledge and com
petence of the legislature." However, it would
also have provided that if 10 per cent of the
student body signs petitions opposing a LASSU
off-campus issues stand, the question must be
submitted to a plebiscite.
This, quite obviously, is not the only viable al
ternative.
The arguments for and against allowing the
ASSU lattitude to debate and take a stand upon
off-campus issues are many and various.
But the choice this Friday is now clear beyond
any debate.
The referendum must be defeated this time
around if only to allow the debate to continue
on what has proved to be a very complex ques
tion.

tion.
Though one suspects it was not his intention,
Scott Mcßride, in his strange, eleventh-hour
veto of LASSU's proposed alternatives on the off
campus issues question, has set up a very clear
case for the defeat of what's left of this Friday's
referendum.
The initial petition, which now stands as the
sole proposition on the referendum ballot, would
summarily and without qualification prohibit the
government of the ASSU from taking "positions
on matters other than those pertaining to student
affairs on the Stanford campus."
It was produced in extreme haste in the heat
of an already hot political battle—produced, one
suspects, not so much to remedy a flaw in the
structure of the ASSU as to ereate a neat
partisan campaign issue.
II passed as is, the referendum would not
only effectively muzzle the ASSU on so-called
"off-campus issues" (issues which despite their
misnomer may often effect the freedom and
education of Stanford students in a very direct
manner), but moreover, in its limitation of ASSU
action to the ambiguously defined area of "stu
dent affairs," might possibly stiffle the expres
sion of student concern within the Stanford com
munity as well. (For example, did the makers
of the petition conceive of academic reform as
within the scope of "student affairs'?)

It is a thoroughly negative proposal.
Whatever the legality of its methods, last
Monday LASSU acted to provide tin* student
body with a considered and reasonable range
of choices on the off-campus issues question.
Particularly interesting—because it preserved
the representative integrity of LASSU while at
the same time allowing the student body oppor
tunity for dissent—was LASSUs second pro
posed alternative. This alternative would have
empowered LASSU to take stands on off-campus
issues which are of "deep concern" to 11 ic stu
dent body and "within the knowledge and com
petence of the legislature." However, it would
also have provided that if 10 per cent of the
student body signs petitions opposing a LASSU
off-campus issues stand, the question must be
submitted to a plebiscite.
This, quite obviously, is not the only viable al
ternative.
The arguments for and against allowing the
ASSU lattitude to debate and take a stand upon
off-campus issues are many and various.
But the choice this Friday is now clear beyond
any debate.
The referendum must be defeated this time
around if only to allow the debate to continue
on what has proved to be a very complex ques
tion.
