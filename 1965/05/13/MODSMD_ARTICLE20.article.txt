# OFF CAMPUS BALLOT
## LASSU: Illegal Ballot-Packing 
### JOHN E. BONINE (Second of Two Parts 
There were a few dissenting
voices on the LASSU Railroad
Monday night; in flashes of hon
esty they exposed the real pur
pose of LASSU's move to add
"alternatives" to the ballot on off
campus stands: namely, to defeat
the original petition, not truly to
give the voters a range of choices.
Because what they were trying
to do was unconstitutional in the
first place the student body will
retain unimpaired its right to use
the initiative process without be
ing frustrated by ASSU. But the
maneuverings at the Monday
meeting are still worth looking
into.

LASSU Representative Chuck
Ludlam circulated a flyer at the
! meeting summarizing the issues
as he saw them:
If we were in favor of the
petition, as it seems that we are
not, would we consider fairness
to the voter as quite as import
ant —would we l»e so anxious to
present alternatives?
In other words, are we more
concerned with getting- the elec
tion to swing our way than to
give the fairest, due process
to the petition?
But LASSU turned a deaf ear
to all such arguments and re
fused even to discuss the Com
mittee of Five proposal. It pro

ceeded to devise a ballot con
taining the original petition
which restricts LASSU's power, a
different proposal which gives
LASSU absolutely unlimited
power, and a so-called "compro
mise" which places no limits on
LASSU's power except that of a
2 a vote and a second-reading.
% Vote Worthless
GCC-membcr Gary Feldman in
advertently revealed the worth
lessness of such a "restriction"
last Thursday night when he was
arguing against having the
Speaker of LASSU removable by
only a % vote:
"Anybody can muster up a -V.
vote on anything," Feldman told
the assembled representatives. lie
and the GCC ought to know.
But with ASSU President Scott
Mcßride's veto of the LASSU al
ternatives yesterday as unconsti
tutional only the original peti
tion will be on the ballot, unless
LASSU tonight finds some way
around the veto, such as "creative
interpretation" of the ASSU con
stitution.
The initiative proposition would
prohibit the student government
from taking stands on off-campus
issues such as Stickney's boycott
and with drawal from Vict Nam.
Petition Allows Plebiscites
It would .however, not prohibit
currently - legal campus wide
plebiscites to sample student sen
timent on issues. The advantage
of plebiscites is that the vote
total will reflect the people on
both sides of the issue and its
size will show the interest or lack
of interest in the particular off
campus issue being discussed.
Those who are irritated by
LASSU's presumptuousness in
seeking to speak for tho whole
student body on everything from
the Cold War to the fitness of
local restaurants should remem
ber to vote Friday —"yes" on the
initiative proposition.
