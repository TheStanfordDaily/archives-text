## Purpose of the Teach-In 
### 
Lditor, The Daily:
Your May 6th story on the
Stanford Vict Nam "teach-in"
(Monday, May 17th) stated that
it was intended "to provide in
formation and background on
United States military involve
ment in Southeast Asia and to
serve as a focus of study, criti
cism and protest of current
American policy by the academic
community." To prevent any mis
understanding, the committee
planning this function reempha
sizes that it invites expression of
fact and opinion from diverse
viewpoints, whether pro-neutral,
or anti-administ rat ion.
The reemphasis is particularly
in order because of the fact that I
was incorrectly quoted in yester
day' Daily as saying that the
teach-in "would be mainly a pro
test" against current policy. In
fact, its purpose, as formulated

by the Committee on Stanford
Viet Nam Day, is to focus the at
tention of the academic commun
ity on present U.S. policy in
Southeast Asia, to provide back
ground information and the latest
news about occurences in this
troubled part of the world, to
establish a forum for the expres
sion of opinions in regard to this
• policy, and to display to the Na
tion and to its leaders the active
interest and concern which we,
the academic community, feel in
regard to the course which our
government is taking.
Faculty or students wishing to
present their views during the
Viet Nam Day meetings are re
quested to get in touch with Mr.
Charles Drekmeier (Political Sci
ence* or Mr. Paul Wallin (So
ciology*. PALI. WALLIN
