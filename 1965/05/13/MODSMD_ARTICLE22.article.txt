# THE 						UNIVERSITY TODAY
## Motives of Student Critics Probed 
### BILL MOORE (Second of Two Parts 
What motivates the student
critics of today's university?
At Stanford the terms involve
ment and commitment are fre
quently used to explain the con
cern, a concern which applies to
the entire society as well. Ten
years ago professors around the
country were bemoaning student
apathy. No longer. Today's stu
dents care, and they are not re
ticent about proving it. Activism
is especially rampant at Stanford.
Items:
• Fifty students, the largest
group from any American uni
versity, participated in the Mis
sissippi Voter Registration Proj
ect last summer. Stanford was
the Western States coordinator
for the operation. Earlier the stu
dent body raised five thousand
dollars to finance the Negro mock
vote campaign in Mississippi.
• Two-hundred and fifty stu- j
dents are now tutoring under-1
privileged children in the Bay
Area.
• Seventy five graduates cn-1
tercd (lie Peace Corps last year.
• And many others have par
ticipated in such similiar activi
ties as Crossroads Africa, the
Hong Kong Project and Project
Amigos in Mexico.
Some disturbing tendencies, j
however, have arisen with this j
new direction. Both ai Stanford j
and Berkeley the more zealous!
have made the dangerous mis- j
take of trying to apply the con
cept of involvement and com- >
mitment to the university as aj
whole rather than to its in- ;
dividual members.
A university should certainly 1
encourage its members to take up ,
activism, but the university itself;
must always remain a neutral
forum for all manner of ideas
and activity.
GCC Newsletter
The February 24 issue of the j
Newsletter, published by Stan- I
ford's FSM - oriented Graduate i
Coordinating Committee (GCC),
said the university "must succeed
in imparting to that society a
sense of direction, a sense of pur
pose." In the February 2 issue !

a statement appeared exhorting
universities to begin "the process
towards peace, civil rights and
labor struggles, reinsert theory
and idealism where too o 11 en
reign confusion and political
barter."
The underlying assumption of
this attitude is that there is an
absolute truth. And these people
obviously think they have a mo
nopoly on it. How antithetical all
of this is to the historical ideal
of the university — that place
where there is free exchange of
contradictory philosophies and
ideas. If some members of the
GCC and the FSM had their way,
universities would be taking def
inite political and economic
stands. Exit the free forum.
Another disturbing tendency
is the disdain for compromise
among some elements of the GCC
and the FSM. One member of the
latter was quoted in the March
13 New Yorker; "Liberal is a
dirty word here. Liberalism is a
trap. It's the impotence of having
principles that make you opposed
to something and other principles j
that keep you from doing any- j
thing about it."
Anti-In tellectualism
Closely related to this is what
appears to be an anti-intellectual
ism of sorts among these FSM ;
and GCC elements. Their insis
tence upon explaining themselves
in moral rather than intellectual
terms and their emphasis on ac
tion rather than theory are, to
say the least, revealing.
A most incisive observation j
was made by Professor John
Searle of the Berkeley Philosophy i
Department. "Of course these
people are absolutists," lie told
the New Yorker (March 13K ■
"They are radicals. They perform !
a useful function in society as
gadflies, but they have no loyalty ;
to the structure, and once you've
forced t he population to adopt:
them as leaders, you have,
trouble. The problem is not how i
to handle them. The problem is ,
how not to get in a position
where a mass movement has to j
turn to them for leadership."
How can this be done?
Education critic Paul Goodman
has suggested that students or

ganize into a union to bargain
collectively with administrators.
The Goodman Approach
"At present in the United
States, students — middle-class
youth—are the major exploited
class. (Negroes, small farmers,
the aged are rather out-cast
groups; their labor is not needed
and they are not wanted.) The
labor of intelligent youth is need
ed and they are accordingly sub
jeeted to tight scheduling, speed
up and other factory methods.
Then it is not surprising if they
organize their CIO. It is frivolous
to tell them to go elsewhere if
they don't like the rules, for
they have no choice but to go to
college and one factory is like
another."
But even the Goodman ap
proach could be avoided if the
university were willing to re
spond to the grievances. Students i
want more of a voice Jn the opera |
tion of the university. Certainly ;
they have a right to have some
say-so about their education. Un- 1
fortunately, on most campuses
and particularly ut Stanford the i
lines of real communication are !
threadlike, indeed. The univer
sity's recent liberalization of so-1
cial regulations, however, is an I

.excellent sign that it is willing to
begin the dialogue. The univer
sity worked closely with students
in hammering out the new policy.
But if Stanford wants to avoid
an FSM-styled confrontation, it
i had better keep its ears close
to the ground, as it did with the
social regulations issue. For we
are witnessing the opening
rounds of a student revolution.
If both sides keep good faith, is
can be a peaceful revolution—a
peaceful revolution in the finest
American tradition.

"They are radicals. They perform !
a useful function in society as
gadflies, but they have no loyalty ;
to the structure, and once you've
forced t he population to adopt:
them as leaders, you have,
trouble. The problem is not how i
to handle them. The problem is ,
how not to get in a position
where a mass movement has to j
turn to them for leadership."
How can this be done?
Education critic Paul Goodman
has suggested that students or

ganize into a union to bargain
collectively with administrators.
The Goodman Approach
"At present in the United
States, students — middle-class
youth—are the major exploited
class. (Negroes, small farmers,
the aged are rather out-cast
groups; their labor is not needed
and they are not wanted.) The
labor of intelligent youth is need
ed and they are accordingly sub
jeeted to tight scheduling, speed
up and other factory methods.
Then it is not surprising if they
organize their CIO. It is frivolous
to tell them to go elsewhere if
they don't like the rules, for
they have no choice but to go to
college and one factory is like
another."
But even the Goodman ap
proach could be avoided if the
university were willing to re
spond to the grievances. Students i
want more of a voice Jn the opera |
tion of the university. Certainly ;
they have a right to have some
say-so about their education. Un- 1
fortunately, on most campuses
and particularly ut Stanford the i
lines of real communication are !
threadlike, indeed. The univer
sity's recent liberalization of so-1
cial regulations, however, is an I

.excellent sign that it is willing to
begin the dialogue. The univer
sity worked closely with students
in hammering out the new policy.
But if Stanford wants to avoid
an FSM-styled confrontation, it
i had better keep its ears close
to the ground, as it did with the
social regulations issue. For we
are witnessing the opening
rounds of a student revolution.
If both sides keep good faith, is
can be a peaceful revolution—a
peaceful revolution in the finest
American tradition.
What motivates the student
critics of today's university?
At Stanford the terms involve
ment and commitment are fre
quently used to explain the con
cern, a concern which applies to
the entire society as well. Ten
years ago professors around the
country were bemoaning student
apathy. No longer. Today's stu
dents care, and they are not re
ticent about proving it. Activism
is especially rampant at Stanford.
Items:
• Fifty students, the largest
group from any American uni
versity, participated in the Mis
sissippi Voter Registration Proj

the Western States coordinator
for the operation. Earlier the stu

dollars to finance the Negro mock
vote campaign in Mississippi.
• Two-hundred and fifty stu- j
dents are now tutoring under-1
privileged children in the Bay
Area.
• Seventy five graduates cn-1

• And many others have par
ticipated in such similiar activi

Hong Kong Project and Project
Amigos in Mexico.
Some disturbing tendencies, j
however, have arisen with this j
new direction. Both ai Stanford j
and Berkeley the more zealous!
have made the dangerous mis- j
take of trying to apply the con
cept of involvement and com- >
mitment to the university as aj

GCC Newsletter
The February 24 issue of the j
Newsletter, published by Stan- I
ford's FSM - oriented Graduate i
Coordinating Committee (GCC),
said the university "must succeed
in imparting to that society a
sense of direction, a sense of pur
pose." In the February 2 issue !

a statement appeared exhorting
universities to begin "the process
towards peace, civil rights and
labor struggles, reinsert theory
and idealism where too o 11 en
reign confusion and political
barter."
The underlying assumption of
this attitude is that there is an
absolute truth. And these people
obviously think they have a mo
nopoly on it. How antithetical all
of this is to the historical ideal
of the university — that place
where there is free exchange of
contradictory philosophies and
ideas. If some members of the
GCC and the FSM had their way,
universities would be taking def
inite political and economic
stands. Exit the free forum.
Another disturbing tendency
is the disdain for compromise
among some elements of the GCC
and the FSM. One member of the
latter was quoted in the March
13 New Yorker; "Liberal is a
dirty word here. Liberalism is a
trap. It's the impotence of having
principles that make you opposed
to something and other principles j
that keep you from doing any- j
thing about it."
Anti-In tellectualism
Closely related to this is what
appears to be an anti-intellectual
ism of sorts among these FSM ;
and GCC elements. Their insis
tence upon explaining themselves
in moral rather than intellectual
terms and their emphasis on ac
tion rather than theory are, to

GCC Newsletter
The February 24 issue of the j
Newsletter, published by Stan- I
ford's FSM - oriented Graduate i
Coordinating Committee (GCC),
said the university "must succeed
in imparting to that society a
sense of direction, a sense of pur
pose." In the February 2 issue !

a statement appeared exhorting
universities to begin "the process
towards peace, civil rights and
labor struggles, reinsert theory
and idealism where too o 11 en
reign confusion and political
barter."
The underlying assumption of
this attitude is that there is an
absolute truth. And these people
obviously think they have a mo
nopoly on it. How antithetical all
of this is to the historical ideal
of the university — that place
where there is free exchange of
contradictory philosophies and
ideas. If some members of the
GCC and the FSM had their way,
universities would be taking def
inite political and economic
stands. Exit the free forum.
Another disturbing tendency
is the disdain for compromise
among some elements of the GCC
and the FSM. One member of the
latter was quoted in the March
13 New Yorker; "Liberal is a
dirty word here. Liberalism is a
trap. It's the impotence of having
principles that make you opposed
to something and other principles j
that keep you from doing any- j
thing about it."
Anti-In tellectualism
Closely related to this is what
appears to be an anti-intellectual
ism of sorts among these FSM ;
and GCC elements. Their insis
tence upon explaining themselves
in moral rather than intellectual
terms and their emphasis on ac
tion rather than theory are, to
say the least, revealing.
A most incisive observation j
was made by Professor John
Searle of the Berkeley Philosophy i
Department. "Of course these
people are absolutists," lie told
the New Yorker (March 13K ■
"They are radicals. They perform !
a useful function in society as
gadflies, but they have no loyalty ;
to the structure, and once you've
forced t he population to adopt:
them as leaders, you have,
trouble. The problem is not how i
to handle them. The problem is ,
how not to get in a position
where a mass movement has to j
turn to them for leadership."
How can this be done?
Education critic Paul Goodman
has suggested that students or

ganize into a union to bargain
collectively with administrators.
The Goodman Approach
"At present in the United
States, students — middle-class
youth—are the major exploited
class. (Negroes, small farmers,
the aged are rather out-cast
groups; their labor is not needed
and they are not wanted.) The
labor of intelligent youth is need
ed and they are accordingly sub
jeeted to tight scheduling, speed
up and other factory methods.
Then it is not surprising if they
organize their CIO. It is frivolous
to tell them to go elsewhere if
they don't like the rules, for
they have no choice but to go to
college and one factory is like
another."
But even the Goodman ap
proach could be avoided if the
university were willing to re
spond to the grievances. Students i
want more of a voice Jn the opera |
tion of the university. Certainly ;
they have a right to have some
say-so about their education. Un- 1
fortunately, on most campuses
and particularly ut Stanford the i
lines of real communication are !
threadlike, indeed. The univer
sity's recent liberalization of so-1
cial regulations, however, is an I

.excellent sign that it is willing to
begin the dialogue. The univer
sity worked closely with students
in hammering out the new policy.
But if Stanford wants to avoid
an FSM-styled confrontation, it
i had better keep its ears close
to the ground, as it did with the
social regulations issue. For we
are witnessing the opening
rounds of a student revolution.
If both sides keep good faith, is
can be a peaceful revolution—a
peaceful revolution in the finest
American tradition.
What motivates the student
critics of today's university?
At Stanford the terms involve
ment and commitment are fre
quently used to explain the con
cern, a concern which applies to
the entire society as well. Ten
years ago professors around the
country were bemoaning student
apathy. No longer. Today's stu
dents care, and they are not re
ticent about proving it. Activism
is especially rampant at Stanford.
Items:
• Fifty students, the largest
group from any American uni
versity, participated in the Mis
sissippi Voter Registration Proj
ect last summer. Stanford was
the Western States coordinator
for the operation. Earlier the stu
dent body raised five thousand
dollars to finance the Negro mock
vote campaign in Mississippi.
• Two-hundred and fifty stu- j
dents are now tutoring under-1
privileged children in the Bay
Area.
• Seventy five graduates cn-1
tercd (lie Peace Corps last year.
• And many others have par
ticipated in such similiar activi
ties as Crossroads Africa, the
Hong Kong Project and Project
Amigos in Mexico.
Some disturbing tendencies, j
however, have arisen with this j
new direction. Both ai Stanford j
and Berkeley the more zealous!
have made the dangerous mis- j
take of trying to apply the con
cept of involvement and com- >
mitment to the university as aj
