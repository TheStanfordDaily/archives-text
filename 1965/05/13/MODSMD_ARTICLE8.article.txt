# MCBRIDE VETOES LASSU ACTION
## Alternatives Eliminated; Legislature Meets Tonight 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
ASSU President Scott Mcßride yesterday vetoed, on constitu
tional grounds, the two additional propositions on off-campus
issues approved by LASSU to appear on the ballot to be voted
upon by the student body tomorrow.
Late last night Speaker of LASSU Ed Shaw called an emergency

meeting of the Legislature, tcH
meet tonight at 7:30 in Room 320
of Goelogy corner, to consider
McBride's veto.
Unless LASSU can muster a
two-thirds vote to override Mc-
Bride's action, the electorate will
be given the choice tomorrow
of voting "yes" or "no" only
on the proposition originally sub
mitted to the Legislature by peti
tion, that:
"The government of the As
sociated Students of Stanford
University shall not take posi
tions on matters other than
those pertaining to student af
fairs on the Stanford campus."
Const itutioiuil Question
Originally the electorate was
to vote upon three propositions
placing various degrees of re- j
strict ion upon LASSU's right to
express itself on off-campus is
sues. The proposition receiving
the greatest number of "yes" j
votes over "no" votes was to be- j
come part of the ASSU By Laws, j
McBride's action was based up-1
on that part of the ASSU Consti- j
tution pertaining to the creation !
of By Laws, according to a state- j
ment released by him.
According to the Constitution, j
By Laws "may be made, amend- i
ed, or repealed" in only two !
ways:
• By a two-thirds vote of Legis-;
lature.
• By petition signed by five
per cent of the student body, and j
subsequently approved by Legis
lature by a two-thirds vote. If
LASSU does not take such action
within fifteen days the Legisla
ture is constitutionally required
to submit the proposed change to
the student body for a vote with
in twenty-five days.
Original Petition
The original petition, signed by
over 1000 students, went through
the latter procedure. The Legis
lature took no action within
fifteen days, and thus was obli
gated to submit it to a vote
of the student body.
LASSU added the two addi
tional propositions to the ballot
at its meeting Monday.
McBride said in his statement
that lie consulted with three pro
fessors in the School of Law,
who "confirmed my belief that
the Legislature docs not have this
power."
One of LASSU's proposals
would have limited the Legisla
ture to speaking only on issues

which were "within its knowl
edge and competence." Resolu
tions proposed under this proposi
tion would require a two-thirds
vote of LASSU after a delay of
one week after proposal. The stu
dent body could reconsider such
action by referendum if ten per
cent of the electorate signed a
petition calling for a campus vote.
The other proposal would have
allowed LASSU to express itself
on any issue "of deep concern to
the student body."
Judicial Review
According to Shaw, the Legis
lature, in reviewing McBride's
veto, will in effect be sitting in
judicial review of its own action
at tonight meeting, since, under
I he ASSU Constitution, LASSU is
given the right to interpret the
.document.
McBride last night concurred
with Shaw's observation, agree
ing that "the Legislature is fully
empowered to sit as a body to
interpret the Constitution."
The Presidential veto is the
second in the history of the As
sociated Students.
•Best Interests'
In vetoing the two proposals,
McBride stated:
"Careful consideration a n d
many hours of consultation with
students and legal authorities pre
ceded my decision to veto the
Legislature's proposals. However,
as the executive officer of the As
sociate Students, I definitely feel
that I am acting in the best in
terests of oui- Association in veto
ing this action of the Legislature
which clearly violates our own
Constitution."
Shaw, in calling the emergency
LASSU meeting, said:
"While the veto of Legis
ture's action was procedurally in
accord with the Constitution, it
is unfortunate that it came at a
time when the Legislature could
not act upon it at a regular
meeting. The instructions by the
President to hold the election Fri
day necessitates either acquies
cence to the concept that the
President may decide Constitu
tional questions, or the convening
of the proper authority as pro
vided for in the Constitution to
rule on this constitutional ques
tion."
Shaw also called for a special
meeting of LASSU's Rules Com
mittee, to meet at I p.m. in the
Legislature's office in Tresidder.
