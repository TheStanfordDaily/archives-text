We can and will provide the Stanford stu dent the new Ford model of his choice, in
cluding the exciting Mustang, at a price as close to our cost as economic good sense
will permit.
We can and will extend special financing arrangements where necessary to permit
delivery of your new Ford without delay.
We do perform pre-sale service far beyond that usually found in dealerships, with
the result the new Ford you buy from TOWNE is ready now for any trip you may
take.
We are justifiably proud of our reputation for fine after-sale service—a reputation
which has gained for us a vertiable army of loyal customers over a span of 39 years.
We are proud, too, of our mounting sales records, which have made us the sel I ing
est Ford dealer on the Peninsula—by actual count—not by claim alone.
. . . And, we protect our reputation, along with our customers' investment, with
our policy of honest mileage used car merchandising. We no not "REPAIR," "AD
JUST," or otherwise "TAMPER" with the odometers on our trade-ins.
NOTE: You can rent a new Mustang, Galaxie, or Wagon by the
Day, Weekend, or Week. Low, Low Rates.
