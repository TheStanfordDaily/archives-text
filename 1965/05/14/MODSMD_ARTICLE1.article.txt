WINNEBA, Ghana—The 300 delegates at
the fourth Afro Asian people's solidarity or

day smashed the inside of a Negro Methodist

wrecked the sanctuary of Pine Church Chris
tian Methodist Episcopal Church, and rocked
homes in a two-mile area of the Friendship

Mayor James Striplin of Hobson City, an

aii-Negio community nearby, could give 110

• Young Negroes Demonstrate
DEMOPOLIS, Ala. —A band of young Nej<ro
demonstrators took to the streets again yes
terday in another chapter of the confusing
Marengo County racial story.
James Wilson of Chicago, one of six South
ern Christian Leadership Conference field
workers in the county, said the original goal
was voter rights for Negroes.
He said this has since been expanded to
include an end "to the discriminatory policy
the city has against employing Negros" and

• Statue of Liberty I'lot
NEW YORK — A French-Canadian blonde
pleaded guilty in federal court yesterday to

man, Raymond Wood, who infiltrated an ex
tremist organization known as the Black

linked to Red China and Castro Cuba.
