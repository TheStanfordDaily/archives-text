# CIBA SHOWDOWN
## Baseballers Face Santa Clara 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
In quest of their first unshared
baseball championship in 15
years, Stanford will play Santa
Clara in a two game series this
weekend.

- The Tribe invades Buck Shaw
Stadium on the Bronco campus
for today's 3:00 p.m. game. To
morrow, Stanford will host Santa
Clara in Sunken Diamond at 3:00
p.m. These are the last two con
tests of the regular season for
Stanford.
Santa Clara is still nursing its
hopes for the CIBA championship
even though they have a losing
league record, 7-8, to date. Stan
ford's record is 12-6.
Broncos Must Win 5
If the Broncos can win all five
of their remaining games they
will have tied Stanford for first
in the league, but they will have a
3-1 bulge for the season series
with Stanford. This will be good
enough to send them into the
regional play-offs.
All that Stanford has to do to
cinch a play-off spot is win one
more game. Santa Clara has eight
losses; one more loss will elim
inate them from the race.
Presuming that Santa Clara
beats Stanford twice, the Broncos
would have to play USC Tues
day and Santa Barbara in a
doubleheader Wednesday. All of
the games would be away.
Cal Has Dun Hopes
Cal has only seven losses, but
they will not even bother to play
their last three games, two of
: them against USC at Los Angeles,
! because Stanford beat: them, 3-1,
I in the season series. But if Santa
! Clara defeats Stanford twice and
; Cal wins the rest of their games,
; which is unlikely, Cal will win
; the title.
But the magic number for the
' Indians is still one. John Mason
! will probably be coach Dutch

Fehring's choice to pitch against
the Broncos Friday.
Mason, a strong-armed right
hander, has a 7-2 record with a
creditable 2.10 earned-run-aver
age. In 68 innings pitcher he has
struck out 65 batters.
If Mason throws Friday, then
sophomore ace Daro Quiring will
take the mound Saturday. Quir
ing's record is the best of the
staff with 9 wins against 2 losses.
His e.r.a. is 2.35.
Mason and Quiring To Pitch
The odds are that Mason and
then Quiring will be the order for
two reasons.
One, Mason keeps the ball
lower and forces the batters to hit
ground balls which is important
in the cozy confines of Buck
Shaw Stadium.
Two, Quiring has 83 strike outs
in 88 innings, but the batters who
didn't whiff have hit many long
flies to the outfield. And in Sun
ken Diamond even a 450 foot blast
can be an out as Jim Hibbs found
out in last week's game with USC.
Mason and Quiring plus Terry
Docken have been extremely ef
fective lately. They have allowed
only two earned runs in the last
five games.
Kronen Trio
Gary Shara, Rich Robertson, and
Roger .Ruth will be the group
from which the Santa Clara
coach will pick his pitcher. The
decision will not be revealed un
til game time Friday.
Shara is 2-1 in league. Robert

son is 3-4, but his record includes
two wins over Cal including Tues
day's clutch 6-3 victory. Ruth has
only appeared briefly and has no
record in league.
Fehring will probably stick
with his usual line-up of Ron Yett,
Bob Cox, Jim Hibbs, Pete Middle
kauff, Dick Swan, Stove Hoviey,
George Thacher, Tom Melzer, and
the pitcher. The hot bat of sopho
more catcher Bill Boles could
change it, though.
Boles Wields Hot Bat
Boles is the one who smashed
the ball into deep center to win
the game against USC last week
end. And in Tuesday's contest
against University of Pacific he
went 3 for 4.
Ho is now hitting a sizzling .371.
In order to get his hot streak into
the batting order Fehring might
move Boles into the catcher's spot
and relocate Hibbs in rightfield.
Boles would probably bat third
with centerfielder Cox taking
Yett.
The first three men in the
Santa Clara order are all hitting
an identical .346.
The first three are Howard
Martin, centerfielder; Ray Hen
ningson, second base; and Tom
Brogan, first base, Henningson
also has 5 homers and 14 r.b.i.'s.
The fourth hitters is league
leader A 1 Gallagher. The hard
hitting third baseman has a .418
batting average. Following him is
left fielder Rod Austin. He is hit
ting .333 with 15 r.b.i.'s.
