# ACCENT ON SPORTS
## Football Squad Ready For Annual Alum Tilt 
### PETE EAKLAND 
Intensive Football Preparations (20 labs) has just ended classes
i for the quarter, and although the final is not until Saturday after
; noon, teacher John Ralston has indicated the spring session this
i year has been "extremely gratifying."
; "The spirit and general attitude has been outstanding. All of the
I players are anxious to improve."
Third Time a I'harin
During the last, five weeks, Coach Ralston, who recently was
■ named an assistant coach for next year's East-West Shrine game,
i has been preparing his football charges for his third season at the
Farm. He hopes the "third time is a charm" addage holds next fall,
i After two mixed-emotion seasons that had sprinklings of both
; heartbreak and pubilation, Stanford desperately wants to prove its
; full potential.
1965 might be the year that the Stanford axe is used to gather
roses in the AAWU garden. The raw material is present, and unlike
; the last, two seasons, very little shifting of personnel has been nec
! essary or seem likely in the fall.
Eight lettermen boster the defense. "Rust's Raiders," the for
; ward wall, remains intact except for new comers Roger Clay (end )
land Mike Palko (linebacker). Transfer lineman Tim Sheehan, Rick
| Derby, and Bill James are valuable line additions. Monty Morman,
j who did not play last year, has shown great progress and could
push aside one of the present defensive starters.
Interceptor Backfield
In the defensive backfield are two returnees from the interceptor

unit of last fall. Joining Craig
"Redstone" Ritchey and "Honest
John" Guillory is freshman Dave
"Nike" Nelson, who has won the
baltlc for safety despite his in
experience.
Standing out on offense this
spring have been quarterbacks
Dave Lewis and Terry DeSylvia
and last year's running mates
Ruy Handley and John Read.
Several young backs have pleas
antly surprised the coaches. They
include fullback Jack Root and
halfback Tim Abena and end
Donn Rcnwick.
The primary objectives of

spring practice are to find weak
nesses so that they might lie corrected as much as possible before
fall and to introduce the players to any changes in offensive or de
fensive patterns.
Ralston said that the spring practices brought out some weak
nesses the coaching staff was not aware of and also confirmed some
that we suspected would be present. "There's still lots of work to
do. The offense moved much too easily on the defense during the
Red-White game last Saturday. The defensive secondary is still not
as solid as I would lik to see it."
Several changes have been made in the offense. Some are minor
such as the change in cadence used in calling signals. The major
change, Ralston says, is the bringing in of Ihe fiankerback to in
crease the number of running backs to three. Last year, when Bob
j Blunt blossomed into a sturdy, dependable runner, Ralston had no
place to put him and had to alternate him with Handley. This year,
they bolh will play.
Alumni Will Test Varsity
Ralston thinks the Alumni game Saturday will be a strong test
for the Indians. Fielding what he considers their strongest team in
recent years, the Alumni have been seriously practicing for some
time and hope to end a varsity winning streak.
Concerning next year's slate of opponents, Ralston calls it a "good
schedule, certain to be challenging." Playing all three service aca
demies next year poses a unique problem. Because they come from
different areas of the country, and because the Indians have not
played any of them recently, Stanford is not familiar with their
! style of play.
I Also, a look at Stanford's record against the service academies
since World War II is not encouraging. It has lost five times in as
; many tries, Stanford was held scoreless four times, at least once
by each of the academies.
Injuries which might limit a player's availability in the fall are
always possible, but the Indians have escaped the trials and tribula
tions of spring practice in good shape. Defensive lineman Gary Petti
' grew is in the hospital with a pinched nerve and will miss Saturday's
1 game, but his injury is not considered serious.

JOHN RALSTON
Intensive Football Preparations (20 labs) has just ended classes
i for the quarter, and although the final is not until Saturday after
; noon, teacher John Ralston has indicated the spring session this
i year has been "extremely gratifying."
; "The spirit and general attitude has been outstanding. All of the
I players are anxious to improve."
Third Time a I'harin
During the last, five weeks, Coach Ralston, who recently was
■ named an assistant coach for next year's East-West Shrine game,
i has been preparing his football charges for his third season at the
Farm. He hopes the "third time is a charm" addage holds next fall,
i After two mixed-emotion seasons that had sprinklings of both
; heartbreak and pubilation, Stanford desperately wants to prove its
; full potential.
1965 might be the year that the Stanford axe is used to gather
roses in the AAWU garden. The raw material is present, and unlike
; the last, two seasons, very little shifting of personnel has been nec
! essary or seem likely in the fall.
Eight lettermen boster the defense. "Rust's Raiders," the for
; ward wall, remains intact except for new comers Roger Clay (end )
land Mike Palko (linebacker). Transfer lineman Tim Sheehan, Rick
| Derby, and Bill James are valuable line additions. Monty Morman,
j who did not play last year, has shown great progress and could
push aside one of the present defensive starters.
Interceptor Backfield
In the defensive backfield are two returnees from the interceptor

unit of last fall. Joining Craig
"Redstone" Ritchey and "Honest
John" Guillory is freshman Dave
"Nike" Nelson, who has won the
baltlc for safety despite his in
experience.
Standing out on offense this
spring have been quarterbacks
Dave Lewis and Terry DeSylvia
and last year's running mates
Ruy Handley and John Read.
Several young backs have pleas
antly surprised the coaches. They
include fullback Jack Root and
halfback Tim Abena and end
Donn Rcnwick.
The primary objectives of

spring practice are to find weak
nesses so that they might lie corrected as much as possible before
fall and to introduce the players to any changes in offensive or de
fensive patterns.
Ralston said that the spring practices brought out some weak
nesses the coaching staff was not aware of and also confirmed some
that we suspected would be present. "There's still lots of work to
do. The offense moved much too easily on the defense during the
Red-White game last Saturday. The defensive secondary is still not
as solid as I would lik to see it."
Several changes have been made in the offense. Some are minor
such as the change in cadence used in calling signals. The major
change, Ralston says, is the bringing in of Ihe fiankerback to in
crease the number of running backs to three. Last year, when Bob
j Blunt blossomed into a sturdy, dependable runner, Ralston had no
place to put him and had to alternate him with Handley. This year,
they bolh will play.
Alumni Will Test Varsity
Ralston thinks the Alumni game Saturday will be a strong test
for the Indians. Fielding what he considers their strongest team in
recent years, the Alumni have been seriously practicing for some
time and hope to end a varsity winning streak.
Concerning next year's slate of opponents, Ralston calls it a "good
schedule, certain to be challenging." Playing all three service aca
demies next year poses a unique problem. Because they come from
different areas of the country, and because the Indians have not
played any of them recently, Stanford is not familiar with their
! style of play.
I Also, a look at Stanford's record against the service academies
