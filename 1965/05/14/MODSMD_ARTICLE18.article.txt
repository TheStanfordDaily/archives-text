! will open in Little Theatre on Wednesday (see article on page 5).

J There will be performances through ihe end of this month.
FILMS
BALLAD OF A SOLDIER, an excellent Russian movie about a
young private on leave, is today's Tresidder offering.
PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, the classic horror film starring
Lon Chaney, and I MARRIED A MONSTER, about, you guessed it,
a woman who marries a monster, are Saturday's Tresidder offerings.
I A first aid station has been set up to handle casualties—another
service from the Friendly Health Service,
MASQUERADE, in which Cliff Robertson runs all over Spain
! trying to protect a child prince from his relatives, is at the Park
with NONE BUT THE BRAVE, featuring Frank Sinatra in uniform.
FANNY HILL, which, it is generally conceded, is something less
i than fine art, is at the Fine Arts. With it is TO BED OR NOT TO
BED, a question which, reportedly, Fanny asks herself much too
often, and which, hopefully, this movie answers more conclusively
than she does.
ZORBA THE GREEK, which, in contrast to "The Bacehae," is a
sort of comedy about wine, women, and song, and which won three
Gscars (that may or may not be a recommendation), is at the
Guild. Its most prominent feature, next to Alan Bates' fine acting,
i is The Dancing Anthony Quinn.
THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM and THE MOON IS
BLUE, both of which were originally denied the producers' code Seal
!of Approval, ought to make a very interesting evening indeed,
j They are at the Paris.
HARLOW, the Electronovision version of Jean Harlow's life, is
| now at the Varsity (see review on this page), and it's a long way
from "Mary Poppins," that's for sure. With it is THE OUTRAGE,
1 starring Paul Newman land his slipshod Mexican accent) in the
old, old story of love, rape, and murder in the desert.
GIRLS ON THE BEACH and YOUNG FURY are the Stanford's
latest attractions. As usual, they sound provocatively erotic; how
ever, they will probably turn out not to be. (Incidentally, "Young
Fury" is a western, and not about the colt hood days of Fury the
: horse.)
WORLD WITHOUT SUN, Jacques-Yves Cousteau's beautiful film
j about undersea life, is at the Bijou, hopefully to stay. With it is
THE PINK PANTHER, a Peter Sellers comedy featuring a number
j of very funny people and one enormous diamond.
OTHER
SPRING SING, Stanford's annual night of amateur song, will be
j in Frost Amphitheater this Sunday. The Mendicants will entertain
| during intermission, and there will be folksinging in sing-along style
| during the judging. And remember, this festival of golden voices
replaces the flicks.
MEN'S GLEE CLUB and RED VEST BAND will present a con
cert this evening in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The program is entitled
"This Night for Song," and features arrangements of songs from
"Hello. Dolly!" and other Broadway musicals. The concert will open
| with classical choral works, continue with a group of folk songs and
j spirituals, and close with the show tunes.
DEPARTMENT OF MUSIC will present another in its continuing
! series of chamber music concerts on Sunday afternoon in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium.
THE STAN GETZ QUARTET is at Basin Stveet West in San Fran
' clsco (see article on page 5).
THE TANGENT is featuring the Gateway Trio and Buddy Bohn,
i who, by the way, is its resident wandering minstrel. Rumor has it
! that the reason he doesn't travel anymore has something to do with
j a cancelled airline credit card.
THE FULL MOON is happening on Saturday about midnight in
I Inner Quad. There will be free kisses for all Stanford girls who
haven't yet become Stanford women.
