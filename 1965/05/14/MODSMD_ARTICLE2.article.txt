### JANIE DOTSON 
A false alarm at Guthrie
House last night summoned
four fire trucks, including a
hook and ladder, and two
|>olice cars to the up|»erclass
women's residence.
When the fire squad
reached the scene of th« al
leged tir<> the found that a
tradition of the Delta Upsilon
fraternity was in progress.
The D.U.'s were serenading
Jo Silverstein, a sophomore
in Guthrie, in honor of her
recent pinning to D.U. social
chairman Rick llarriman.
They had fashioned the fra
ternity emblem in plywood
and garlanded it with crepe
paper flowers which we r e
supposed to be fireproof.
The flowers wt re doused
with gasoline and at a pre
arranged signal George Twist
set I hem afire, producing a
flaming D.U. on the Guthrie,
lawn. According to the D.U.'s
Tom Putnam fiddled as
flames enveloped the em
blem.
After the serenade was
over, tiie flaming D.U. was
lowered to the ground, burn
ing the letters into the lawn
as a souvenir for the Guthrie

girls.
Guthrieites viewed the pro
ceedinifs from (lie I'ronl bal
<•011 ii*s of the house, ennha
sizing their approval <»!' the
D.U. action with cheers aiul
hissing the firemen upon
their arrival.
Firemen who "chased the
wild goose" to Guthrie were
not exaetly pleased with the
sight of the frolicking" fra
ternity men and their fire.
The trip was fruitless in all
respects, for the blaze was
finally extinguished by D.U.
Ted Thayer, who gallantly
beat out the flames with his
coat, and the firemen beat a
sheepish retreat.
Delta t r psilon President
Seott McGllvray, when asked
to comment on the unusual
serenade, stated, "This was a
disguised attempt to set the
hearts of the Guthrie girls
ablaze."
lie also admitted that set
ting similar fires was com
mon procedure at pinning
celebrations in this house on
campus, and that in the fu
ture the D.U.'s will be re
quired to register their <er
senude with the fire depart
ment.
