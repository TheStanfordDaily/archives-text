# MOVIE REVIEW
## "Harlow'â€”Haste Makes Waste 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
The Electronovision "Harlow"
with Carol Lynley (not to be con
fused with the unreleased Joseph
Levine "Harlow" with Carroll
Baker) is not as bad as it might
have been, considering its source
was the sordid record of Jean
Harlow's public career and pri
vate life.
In view of the material at hand,
in fact, the film is remarkable
for its restraint. Cutting away al
most all the expose aspects of
Irving Shumlin's alleged biog
raphy, the film merely glosses
over Harlow's alcoholism and
nymphomania, substituting for
the former a mild fondness for
cocoanut water and for the latter
an unclear relation with a male
prostitute. The agonies of her
first marriage, which are given
such specific atteniion in the biog
raphy, are reduced here to her
amazed disappointment at discov
ering her husband's impotence.
Further, there is no mention of
her mother's belief in Christian
Science, and there are no explana
tions for her sudden death be
yond the suggestion that she has
"a pain."
In either minimizing or avoid
ing those colorful details, the
film gains a woman's magazine
respectability at the same time
that it loses excitement. As it is
here presented, Harlow's life
lacks that legendary wildness and
becomes instead a sincere, small
sized portrait of .just another
blonde bombshell's meteoric and
unhappy rise to stardom.

Ivynley's Harlow
Despite the film's modest con
ception, Carol Lynley does sur
prisingly well as Harlow. Wit h
only occasional lapses, she con
vincingly affects a manner of
flat, nasal speech and hip-swaying
movement very similar to Har
low's. Miss Lynley, who has ob
viously been very carefully di
rect ori and who has the best writ
ten role in the film, has great
variety in her performance. She
presents Harlow very much as
Harlow must have been: child
like, determined but basically un
intelligent. dissatisfied with play
ing tarts and searching for fulfil
ment as an actress, caustic, de
fensive, independent but needing
affection, flaunting her sexual
ity but at the same time despis
ing it, disconnected, and ultimate
ly defeated.
In portraying a character who
has star quality, Miss Lynley is
confronted with the problem of
embodying that special appeal
herself. Her success in capturing
that intangible something which
made Harlow such a celebrity is
in large measure responsible for
the caliber of her acting. Indeed,
Miss Lynley's firm grasp of her
role sustains interest" and pro
vides a focus even when what
happens around her begins to fal
ter because of evasive writing or
careless characterization s.
Hastily Filmed
The general quality of the sup
porting performances testifies 1o
the haste of the record eight-day
filming schedule.
Ginger Rogers returns to t he
screen to portray Mama Jean.

Unfortunately her ambiguous and
uninvolved style of playing helps
little in explaining Ihc motiva
tions of Harlow's mother.
Barry Sullivan, whose appear
ance is also a comeback of sorts,
has thrown together a caricature
of an Italian gigolo for his per
formance as Harlow's stepfather.
His Italian accent is prominent
as the only overacting in an un
derstated film.
Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is offen
sive as a pompous actor who
initially spurns Harlow only to
end up as her most ardent lover.
His work in 110 way differs from
his pallid character on "77 Sun
set Strip," and the scenes with
him smack of an artificial, wom
an's picture sentimentality.
Embarrassing" Hole
Hurd Hatfield is stuck with the
embarrassing role of the intel
lectual, impotent producer who
married Harlow. He has been
given some unintentionally comic
dialogue and in one painfully
self-conscious speech he is forced
to state the philosophical prem
ises underlying Harlow's image
as a sex symbol.
The strictly low-budget produc
tion also betrays the rushed
shooting schedule with the occa
sionally choppy editing and awk
ward camera placements. But
the unfinished quality has its
virtues in giving the film a sense
of candidness. This realism is
heightened by the Eleetronovision
process which gives to the
photography a grainy, soft-focus
effect, thereby making the film
look like it was actually made
back in the 30's.

prostitute. The agonies of her
first marriage, which are given
such specific atteniion in the biog
raphy, are reduced here to her
amazed disappointment at discov
ering her husband's impotence.
Further, there is no mention of
her mother's belief in Christian
Science, and there are no explana
tions for her sudden death be
yond the suggestion that she has
"a pain."
In either minimizing or avoid
ing those colorful details, the
film gains a woman's magazine
respectability at the same time
that it loses excitement. As it is
here presented, Harlow's life
lacks that legendary wildness and
becomes instead a sincere, small
sized portrait of .just another
blonde bombshell's meteoric and
unhappy rise to stardom.

Ivynley's Harlow
Despite the film's modest con
ception, Carol Lynley does sur
prisingly well as Harlow. Wit h
only occasional lapses, she con
vincingly affects a manner of
flat, nasal speech and hip-swaying
movement very similar to Har
low's. Miss Lynley, who has ob
viously been very carefully di
rect ori and who has the best writ
ten role in the film, has great
variety in her performance. She
presents Harlow very much as
Harlow must have been: child
like, determined but basically un
intelligent. dissatisfied with play
ing tarts and searching for fulfil
ment as an actress, caustic, de
fensive, independent but needing
affection, flaunting her sexual
ity but at the same time despis
ing it, disconnected, and ultimate
ly defeated.
In portraying a character who
has star quality, Miss Lynley is
confronted with the problem of
embodying that special appeal
herself. Her success in capturing
that intangible something which
made Harlow such a celebrity is
in large measure responsible for
the caliber of her acting. Indeed,
Miss Lynley's firm grasp of her
role sustains interest" and pro
vides a focus even when what
happens around her begins to fal
ter because of evasive writing or
careless characterization s.
Hastily Filmed
The general quality of the sup
porting performances testifies 1o
the haste of the record eight-day
filming schedule.
Ginger Rogers returns to t he
screen to portray Mama Jean.

Unfortunately her ambiguous and
uninvolved style of playing helps
little in explaining Ihc motiva
tions of Harlow's mother.
Barry Sullivan, whose appear
ance is also a comeback of sorts,
has thrown together a caricature
of an Italian gigolo for his per
formance as Harlow's stepfather.
His Italian accent is prominent
as the only overacting in an un
derstated film.
Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is offen
sive as a pompous actor who
initially spurns Harlow only to
end up as her most ardent lover.
His work in 110 way differs from
his pallid character on "77 Sun
set Strip," and the scenes with
him smack of an artificial, wom
an's picture sentimentality.
Embarrassing" Hole
Hurd Hatfield is stuck with the
embarrassing role of the intel
lectual, impotent producer who
married Harlow. He has been
given some unintentionally comic
dialogue and in one painfully
self-conscious speech he is forced
to state the philosophical prem
ises underlying Harlow's image
as a sex symbol.
The strictly low-budget produc
tion also betrays the rushed
shooting schedule with the occa
sionally choppy editing and awk
ward camera placements. But
the unfinished quality has its
virtues in giving the film a sense
of candidness. This realism is
heightened by the Eleetronovision
process which gives to the
photography a grainy, soft-focus
effect, thereby making the film
look like it was actually made
back in the 30's.
The Electronovision "Harlow"
with Carol Lynley (not to be con
fused with the unreleased Joseph
Levine "Harlow" with Carroll
Baker) is not as bad as it might
have been, considering its source
was the sordid record of Jean
Harlow's public career and pri
vate life.
In view of the material at hand,
in fact, the film is remarkable
for its restraint. Cutting away al
most all the expose aspects of
Irving Shumlin's alleged biog
raphy, the film merely glosses
over Harlow's alcoholism and
nymphomania, substituting for
the former a mild fondness for
cocoanut water and for the latter
an unclear relation with a male
prostitute. The agonies of her
first marriage, which are given
such specific atteniion in the biog

blonde bombshell's meteoric and
unhappy rise to stardom.

Ivynley's Harlow
Despite the film's modest con
ception, Carol Lynley does sur
prisingly well as Harlow. Wit h
only occasional lapses, she con
vincingly affects a manner of
flat, nasal speech and hip-swaying
movement very similar to Har
low's. Miss Lynley, who has ob
viously been very carefully di
rect ori and who has the best writ
ten role in the film, has great
variety in her performance. She
presents Harlow very much as
Harlow must have been: child
like, determined but basically un
intelligent. dissatisfied with play
ing tarts and searching for fulfil
ment as an actress, caustic, de
fensive, independent but needing
affection, flaunting her sexual
ity but at the same time despis
ing it, disconnected, and ultimate
ly defeated.
In portraying a character who
has star quality, Miss Lynley is
confronted with the problem of
embodying that special appeal
herself. Her success in capturing
that intangible something which
made Harlow such a celebrity is
in large measure responsible for
the caliber of her acting. Indeed,
Miss Lynley's firm grasp of her
role sustains interest" and pro
vides a focus even when what
happens around her begins to fal
ter because of evasive writing or
careless characterization s.
Hastily Filmed
The general quality of the sup
porting performances testifies 1o
the haste of the record eight-day
filming schedule.
Ginger Rogers returns to t he
screen to portray Mama Jean.

Unfortunately her ambiguous and
uninvolved style of playing helps
little in explaining Ihc motiva
tions of Harlow's mother.
Barry Sullivan, whose appear
ance is also a comeback of sorts,
has thrown together a caricature
of an Italian gigolo for his per
formance as Harlow's stepfather.
His Italian accent is prominent
as the only overacting in an un
derstated film.
Efrem Zimbalist Jr. is offen
sive as a pompous actor who
initially spurns Harlow only to
end up as her most ardent lover.
His work in 110 way differs from
his pallid character on "77 Sun
set Strip," and the scenes with
him smack of an artificial, wom
an's picture sentimentality.
Embarrassing" Hole
Hurd Hatfield is stuck with the
embarrassing role of the intel
lectual, impotent producer who
married Harlow. He has been
given some unintentionally comic
dialogue and in one painfully
self-conscious speech he is forced
to state the philosophical prem
ises underlying Harlow's image
as a sex symbol.
The strictly low-budget produc
tion also betrays the rushed
shooting schedule with the occa
sionally choppy editing and awk
ward camera placements. But
the unfinished quality has its
virtues in giving the film a sense
of candidness. This realism is
heightened by the Eleetronovision
process which gives to the
photography a grainy, soft-focus
effect, thereby making the film
look like it was actually made
back in the 30's.
