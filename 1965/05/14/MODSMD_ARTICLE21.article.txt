## PLAY REVIEW Don't Miss 'Sidney Brustein' 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
Lorraine Hansberry was liter-'
ally dying of cancer when she
wrote "The Sign in Sidney Bru- j
stein's Window," and apparently !
she wanted to get all she had to,
say into it.
And although in a season
known largely for lightweight
comedies and undistinguished ;
musicals it seems a shame to com- J
plain 1 hat a new play has too 1
many ideas for its own good, i
such a complaint must be lodged i
against "Sidney Brustein."
However, its faults arc those of
excessive concern, not of a lack i
of concern, and in spite of these j
faults which — considering the!
entire theatrical experience that j
is "Sidney Brustein" are min
or, this is a play that must not j
be missed.
Humor and Compassion
Miss Hansberry has written, !
with humor and compassion,
about Sidney Brustein a young
Greenwich Villager who, after an
abortive attempt to run a "sort
of nightclub," is now editor of a
local weekly newspaper.
Surrounding Sidney are hi s 1
wife, Iris, an untalented actress
who has been under analysis for ;
two years; Iris' older sister Ma- j
vis, seemingly a happily and sue-1
cessfully married suburban ma- j
tron; Iris' younger sister Gloria, j
a high-priced prostitute; David, aj
young homosexual playwright j
who lives upstairs; Alton, an ex
tremely light-skinned and leftist
Negro who falls in love w i th
Gloria; Wally, a lawyer; and Max,
an artist.

Political Campaigning
At great financial risk Sidney
supports Wally's campaign for
political office on a "reform";
ticket. Iris leaves him, declaring
that it's "you and the causes all
the time; it's phony as hell." j
When Wally surprisingly wins, |
Sidney discovers that many of the ;
things he had been crusading for :
were merely empty campaign :
promises. By this time Alton has
discovered Gloria's profession and >
leaves her. David comes in and 1
invites her upstairs to watch him
make love to another man, where- J
upon she kills herself.
The play's melodramatic final
scene, in which Sidney turns'
against Wally and reconciles with •
Iris, is lhe only possible ending, ,
but one can't help wishing that j
Miss Hansberry had been less
critically ill and had been able
to rewrite and improve the scene, j
Great Drama
Although the play's structure is !
somewhat weak, Miss Hansberry j
has written many individual |
scenes which are brilliant. Thei
scene where Mavis reveals some I

unexpected details of her life to
Sidney, telling him that "There
are no squares, Sidney - every
body is his own hipster." and
the strange but totally believable
scene in which David issues his
"invitation" to Gloria, provide the
kind of intensity that makes
great drama.
Peter Kass' sensitive direction
never lets the play become static
and, with Jack Blackman's prop
erly cluttered set and Jules Fish
er's magnificently evocative light
ing, is a major force in sustaining
the mood of the play.
The cast — many of them still
in their original Broadway roles
of last fall — is of course respon
sible for much of this mood.
Superb Sidney
In the title role. Gabriel Dell
almost never leaves the stage. He
has some of the play's best lines
and many of its worst; it is to his
credit that he makes the bad lines
seem much better than they
really are. He argues with Iris,
laughs at "this gigantic absurd
ity" of life, insults almost every
one around, and does them all
superbly.
Alice Ghostley's Mavis, al
though she only appears twice, is
a beautifully realized character.
Wise under her superficial hu
mor, she is sympathetic an d
touching.
As Iris, Carolan Daniels is also
excellent, effectively capturing
the agony of an insecure girl who
doesn't know what she wants or
what is wanted of her.
Outstanding Support
Wisely, John Alderman plays
David without the usual effem
inate gestures and Ann Wedge
worth plays Gloria as a miserable
girl whose one chance for happi
ness fails. They, along with Ben
Aliza as Alton, head the out
standing supporting cast.
Miss Hansberry, although com
passionate, realizes her char
acters' faults. As Max says, "You
revolutionaries are all alike; you
start out full of fire and end up
full of shit."
Miss Hansberry does not ro
manticize her characters; she
does not make them stereotypes.
Although "Sidney Brustein" is by
no means a flawless or a "nice"
play, it is an exciting and honest
one. As Iris says, there is one
"trouble with looking at yourself
honestly - you come up with
the truth, and maybe the truth is
a bitch."

Although the play's structure is !
somewhat weak, Miss Hansberry j
has written many individual |
scenes which are brilliant. Thei
scene where Mavis reveals some I

unexpected details of her life to
Sidney, telling him that "There
are no squares, Sidney - every
body is his own hipster." and
the strange but totally believable
scene in which David issues his
"invitation" to Gloria, provide the
kind of intensity that makes
great drama.
Peter Kass' sensitive direction
never lets the play become static
and, with Jack Blackman's prop
erly cluttered set and Jules Fish
er's magnificently evocative light
ing, is a major force in sustaining
the mood of the play.
The cast — many of them still
in their original Broadway roles
of last fall — is of course respon
sible for much of this mood.
Superb Sidney
In the title role. Gabriel Dell
almost never leaves the stage. He
has some of the play's best lines
and many of its worst; it is to his
credit that he makes the bad lines
seem much better than they
really are. He argues with Iris,
laughs at "this gigantic absurd
ity" of life, insults almost every
one around, and does them all
superbly.
Alice Ghostley's Mavis, al
though she only appears twice, is
a beautifully realized character.
Wise under her superficial hu
mor, she is sympathetic an d
touching.
As Iris, Carolan Daniels is also
excellent, effectively capturing
the agony of an insecure girl who
doesn't know what she wants or
what is wanted of her.
Outstanding Support
Wisely, John Alderman plays
David without the usual effem
inate gestures and Ann Wedge
worth plays Gloria as a miserable
girl whose one chance for happi
ness fails. They, along with Ben
Aliza as Alton, head the out
standing supporting cast.
Miss Hansberry, although com
passionate, realizes her char
acters' faults. As Max says, "You
revolutionaries are all alike; you
start out full of fire and end up
full of shit."
Miss Hansberry does not ro
manticize her characters; she
does not make them stereotypes.
Although "Sidney Brustein" is by
no means a flawless or a "nice"
play, it is an exciting and honest
one. As Iris says, there is one
"trouble with looking at yourself
honestly - you come up with
the truth, and maybe the truth is
a bitch."
Lorraine Hansberry was liter-'
ally dying of cancer when she
wrote "The Sign in Sidney Bru- j
stein's Window," and apparently !
she wanted to get all she had to,
say into it.
And although in a season
known largely for lightweight
comedies and undistinguished ;
musicals it seems a shame to com- J
plain 1 hat a new play has too 1
many ideas for its own good, i
such a complaint must be lodged i
against "Sidney Brustein."
However, its faults arc those of
excessive concern, not of a lack i
of concern, and in spite of these j
faults which — considering the!
entire theatrical experience that j
is "Sidney Brustein" are min
or, this is a play that must not j
be missed.
Humor and Compassion
Miss Hansberry has written, !
with humor and compassion,
about Sidney Brustein a young
Greenwich Villager who, after an
abortive attempt to run a "sort
of nightclub," is now editor of a
local weekly newspaper.
Surrounding Sidney are hi s 1
wife, Iris, an untalented actress
who has been under analysis for ;
two years; Iris' older sister Ma- j
vis, seemingly a happily and sue-1
cessfully married suburban ma- j
tron; Iris' younger sister Gloria, j
a high-priced prostitute; David, aj
young homosexual playwright j
who lives upstairs; Alton, an ex
tremely light-skinned and leftist
Negro who falls in love w i th
Gloria; Wally, a lawyer; and Max,
an artist.

Political Campaigning
At great financial risk Sidney
supports Wally's campaign for
political office on a "reform";
ticket. Iris leaves him, declaring
that it's "you and the causes all
the time; it's phony as hell." j
When Wally surprisingly wins, |
Sidney discovers that many of the ;
things he had been crusading for :
were merely empty campaign :
promises. By this time Alton has
discovered Gloria's profession and >
leaves her. David comes in and 1
invites her upstairs to watch him
make love to another man, where- J
upon she kills herself.
The play's melodramatic final
scene, in which Sidney turns'
against Wally and reconciles with •
Iris, is lhe only possible ending, ,
but one can't help wishing that j
Miss Hansberry had been less
critically ill and had been able
to rewrite and improve the scene, j

wrote "The Sign in Sidney Bru- j
stein's Window," and apparently !
she wanted to get all she had to,
say into it.
And although in a season
known largely for lightweight
comedies and undistinguished ;
musicals it seems a shame to com- J
plain 1 hat a new play has too 1
many ideas for its own good, i
such a complaint must be lodged i
against "Sidney Brustein."
However, its faults arc those of
excessive concern, not of a lack i
of concern, and in spite of these j
faults which — considering the!
entire theatrical experience that j
is "Sidney Brustein" are min
or, this is a play that must not j
be missed.
Humor and Compassion
Miss Hansberry has written, !
with humor and compassion,
about Sidney Brustein a young
Greenwich Villager who, after an
abortive attempt to run a "sort
of nightclub," is now editor of a
local weekly newspaper.
Surrounding Sidney are hi s 1
wife, Iris, an untalented actress
who has been under analysis for ;
two years; Iris' older sister Ma- j
vis, seemingly a happily and sue-1
cessfully married suburban ma- j
tron; Iris' younger sister Gloria, j
a high-priced prostitute; David, aj
young homosexual playwright j
who lives upstairs; Alton, an ex
tremely light-skinned and leftist
Negro who falls in love w i th
Gloria; Wally, a lawyer; and Max,
an artist.

Political Campaigning
At great financial risk Sidney
supports Wally's campaign for
political office on a "reform";
ticket. Iris leaves him, declaring
that it's "you and the causes all
the time; it's phony as hell." j
When Wally surprisingly wins, |
Sidney discovers that many of the ;
things he had been crusading for :
were merely empty campaign :
promises. By this time Alton has
discovered Gloria's profession and >
leaves her. David comes in and 1
invites her upstairs to watch him
make love to another man, where- J
upon she kills herself.
The play's melodramatic final
scene, in which Sidney turns'
against Wally and reconciles with •
Iris, is lhe only possible ending, ,
but one can't help wishing that j
Miss Hansberry had been less
critically ill and had been able
to rewrite and improve the scene, j
Great Drama
Although the play's structure is !
somewhat weak, Miss Hansberry j
has written many individual |
scenes which are brilliant. Thei
scene where Mavis reveals some I

unexpected details of her life to
Sidney, telling him that "There
are no squares, Sidney - every
body is his own hipster." and
the strange but totally believable
scene in which David issues his
"invitation" to Gloria, provide the
kind of intensity that makes
great drama.
Peter Kass' sensitive direction
never lets the play become static
and, with Jack Blackman's prop
erly cluttered set and Jules Fish
er's magnificently evocative light
ing, is a major force in sustaining
the mood of the play.
The cast — many of them still
in their original Broadway roles
of last fall — is of course respon
sible for much of this mood.
Superb Sidney
In the title role. Gabriel Dell
almost never leaves the stage. He
has some of the play's best lines
and many of its worst; it is to his
credit that he makes the bad lines
seem much better than they
really are. He argues with Iris,
laughs at "this gigantic absurd
ity" of life, insults almost every
one around, and does them all
superbly.
Alice Ghostley's Mavis, al
though she only appears twice, is
a beautifully realized character.
Wise under her superficial hu
mor, she is sympathetic an d
touching.
As Iris, Carolan Daniels is also
excellent, effectively capturing
the agony of an insecure girl who
doesn't know what she wants or
what is wanted of her.
Outstanding Support
Wisely, John Alderman plays
David without the usual effem
inate gestures and Ann Wedge
worth plays Gloria as a miserable
girl whose one chance for happi
ness fails. They, along with Ben
Aliza as Alton, head the out
standing supporting cast.
Miss Hansberry, although com
passionate, realizes her char
acters' faults. As Max says, "You
revolutionaries are all alike; you
start out full of fire and end up
full of shit."
Miss Hansberry does not ro
manticize her characters; she
does not make them stereotypes.
Although "Sidney Brustein" is by
no means a flawless or a "nice"
play, it is an exciting and honest
one. As Iris says, there is one
"trouble with looking at yourself
honestly - you come up with
the truth, and maybe the truth is
a bitch."
