## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
When the Stanford Players'
production of Euripides' tragedy
"The Bacchae" opens in Little
Theatre next Wednesday night,
Stanford senior Susan Leich will
be leading the chorus.
This may not sound like much
until one listens to director Wil
liam Sharp: "What a chorus does
is to increase the power of an
attitude, multiplying it by the
number of actors in the chorus."
Sharp adds that, this demands
great, skill in direction and act
ing, since "it is difficult to get
seven bodies to move and speak
in identical attitudes with an in
tense conviction."
To perfect the chorus Miss
Leich — who is also choreograph
er for the production — began
work with Sharp and composer
John Chowning early in January.
Miss Leich made her dramatic
debut at Stanford with two tot
ally different parts in Ram's
Head's Winter One Acts her
freshman year, followed the fol
lowing fall by featured roles in
"Gaieties" and the Stanford Play
ers' "Macbeth."
That winter she costarred as
Mrs. Molloy in Thornton Wilder's
farce "The Matchmaker" for the
Stanford Players and also was
asked to do a role in Ram's
Head's one act, "The Phormio."
Overseas for two quarters, she
returned and was immediately
cast as the Player Queen in
"Hamlet" for the Stanford Play
ers and again was featured in
"Gaieties."
That winter she played the ex
traordinarily demanding role of
the Queen in Cocteau's "Eagle
With Two Heads"—a role that
at one point called for a 15-m.in
ute monologue — and followed
it with a part in Strindberg's
"The Creditors."
In the spring she appeared as
the missionary girl Sarah Brown
in "Guys and Dolls," going on de
spite mononucleosis and laryngit
is. Last summer she worker! with
a professional stock company at
The Playhouse in Eagles' Mere,
Pennsylvania.
This year she was seen as
Amanda in "Time Remembered"
in the fall and as Dasha in "The
Possessed" last quarter.
After graduation she will re
turn to Stanford for the newly
inaugurated M.F.A. program next
fall.
