## Getz at Basin Street West 
### RICK BALK 
i The line between critical aceep- j
i lance and commercial success has
: always been drawn sharply in the
I jazz world, as it certainly is in
many artistic fields. The produc
tion of a hit record means almost
certain ex-communication to i he
jazz artist, and it is depressing to
see how ruthlessly and unjustly |
i this edict is leveled much of the
time.
One of a few jazzmen who have
managed to hold down places in
both worlds is tenor saxophonist
Stan Getz, who began a two week 1
engagement at Basin Street West
in San Francisco on Wednesday.
Though Get/, has made it finan
j dally (principally through hisj
I place as spearhead of the Bossa i
; Nova movement in the U.S.), he'
I still commands wide critical ac
j claim, both as the master techni-1

Getz Quartet
i • The current Getz-quartet, with:
the exception of drummer Edie
Marshall, has worked together
for over a year. Gene Chorion, a
j Harvard graduate in biology, is i
i featured on bass, and Gary Bur
ton, who - at 2.1 is the*talk of the
! jazz scene, is on vibes.
Burton fits beautifully into the
j Getz sound. One of the few vibra-!
■ phonists who have mastered the
I very difficult four-mallet tech- j
j nique, he excels in Getz's trade- j
mark—the retention of lyricism'
and emphasis on the melodic line
rather than concentration on har-{
monic development.
It is exciting to watch the!
musical interplay between Burton ;
and Getz during a set one com- i
plementing, then questioning, the
(other, then joining in harmonic
i excursions. In fact, the principal
j criticism that could be leveled at
the group would be that Cherico
! and Marshall tend to be dei
j emphasized. However, I tend to I
i think lhat opening night aeons
j tical and organizational problems
j could have caused the duet na
! lure of the Wednesday sets.
I
Exeit ing - and Worthwhile
. !
In any case, the group is excit-'
j ing and well-worthwhile; sets con
j tinue over the weekend at Basin J
I Street West, which admits min- 1
: ors, and a presentation of your
i student body card will get you by
the door charge.
Elsewhere in the Bay Area, a !
saxophonist of a different school,
Sonny Stiff, is at the Jazz Work
! shop, Brasil '65 is at FJI Matador,
i and singer Toni Scott is at
the Trident. Peggy Lee and Ben
ny Goodman finish their week's
; stay at the Circle Star in San Car
! Los Sunday.

This Sunday afternoon from 3
to 5 at the Tangent in Palo Alto
will appear an excellent jazz
quartet of Stanford freshmen.
The group is composed of Kenny
Washington on tenor sax, John
I lank in on drums, Bob Ire son on
bass, and Ted l.au on piano. The
group, which played at the Straw
berry Brunch two weeks ago. has
been working together through
out the year, and it will bo inter
esting to follow the progress of
this very talented quartet.

quartet of Stanford freshmen.
The group is composed of Kenny
Washington on tenor sax, John

group, which played at the Straw

been working together through

this very talented quartet.

One of a few jazzmen who have
managed to hold down places in
