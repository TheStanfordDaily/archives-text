# Heinar Tamme— Master of a Dying Art
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
"Hand engraving is a dying'
art," according to Heinar Tamme. |
one of the few hand engravers i
left in the United States.
Tamme was speaking in 1 ho i
small shop on El Camino in i
Menlo Park where he does en- j
graving, designs and executes |
jewelry, and paints the pictures!
that hang on the walls.
Tamme, born in Estonia, has
been painting since he was five, j
Although lie wanted to be an en- |
graver, his father insisted he find
a "safe" trade and sent him to j
automotive mechanics' school.
During the early years of.
World War 11, he fought in the ,
Underground — first against the!
Germans, later against th<> Rus-1
sians. But he realized "it was
hopeless" and fled by skiing j
across the frozen Baltic Sea to;
Finland.
He spent almost two years in
Finland, working in an auto fac
tory by day while an apprentice i
to "the best engraver in Hel-;
sinki." When the Russians in- j
vaded Finland Tamme and "a
couple of others" fled to Sweden
rowing the 6ft miles in about 21 |
hours.
In Sweden he worked for four
years as an engraver before leav
ing for Denmark where he "got a ;
place on a boat" to Venezuela. He
became ill on the return trip and i

was put ashore in Now York j
where he had an operation.
Out of the hospital, he had $10
in his pocket and knew no En
glish but "apple pie and coffee."
He found an engraving job and ;
discovered the automat and,
stayed in New York until he left
for Miami in 1951.
In Miami he opened his own
sitorq for. the first .time, leaving
it last August'to move to Califor
nia.
Tamme, whose oil and water!
color paintings have won many j
awards, says ho prefers working
on heraldic crests on rings: "it
takes more skill than any other'i
type of engraving."
While in Miami (where he be-!
came a citizen in 1955), he made
a signet ring for the Joseph Ken-1
nedy family on order from a
Palm Beach store. He has also!
engraved crests on antique car j
hubcaps.
Now working on some engrav-!
ing on a 350 pound bell for Mof-1
fett Field, he also engraves on j
leather and glass, and would j
probably try engraving in just
about any medium a client could |
dream up.

a "safe" trade and sent him to j
automotive mechanics' school.
During the early years of.
World War 11, he fought in the ,
Underground — first against the!
Germans, later against th<> Rus-1
sians. But he realized "it was
hopeless" and fled by skiing j
across the frozen Baltic Sea to;
Finland.

vaded Finland Tamme and "a
couple of others" fled to Sweden
rowing the 6ft miles in about 21 |
hours.
In Sweden he worked for four
years as an engraver before leav
ing for Denmark where he "got a ;
place on a boat" to Venezuela. He
became ill on the return trip and i

was put ashore in Now York j
where he had an operation.
Out of the hospital, he had $10
in his pocket and knew no En
glish but "apple pie and coffee."
He found an engraving job and ;
discovered the automat and,
stayed in New York until he left
for Miami in 1951.
In Miami he opened his own
sitorq for. the first .time, leaving
it last August'to move to Califor

color paintings have won many j

a signet ring for the Joseph Ken-1

Palm Beach store. He has also!
engraved crests on antique car j
hubcaps.
Now working on some engrav-!
