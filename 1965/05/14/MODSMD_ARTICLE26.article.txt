## Defeat Urged For Prop. 1 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Because we believe that the
legislature of the ASSU is a
legitimate, responsible, and rep
resentative means through which
Stanford students may express
their opinions on any issues of
deep concern, we support the posi
tion stated in today's Daily by
Sandy Mackenzie and Ed Shaw.
We join with them in urging
Stanford students to defeat any
proposal which would summarily
prohibit the legislature from tak
ing stands on so-called "off-cam
pus issues."

• U.S. Intervention
Editor, The Daily:
An historical analogy will in
dicate the progress we have made
in the techniques of Dominican in
tervention, for the purpose of
suppressing democratic aspira
tions. In 1917 a large military
force ("Army of the Liberation of
the Caribbean"), led by a Do
minican millionaire exile, was or
ganized on Cayo Confites for the
purpose of overthrowing Trujillo,
and for the restoration of true
constitutional government. The
State Department thwarted this;
invading force after ii bad already !
put to sea, but did so by using
a most reluctant Cuba as its po-j
licing instrument. In 1939, when

I was in Cuba, Haiti and the Do
minican Republic (at the moment
of another unsuccessful inva
sion), this episode was well and
bitterly remembered. Our insis
tence on the policy of non-inter
vention was clearly seen as a
form of intervention on behalf of
a police state.
Since then our methods have
become more forthright. I quote
with a shock of recognition and
dismay a paragraph I wrote after
returning from this Caribbean
trip in 1959:
"Three alternatives would seem
to exist for the United States. The
i first is to cling to ils present neg
ative policy of supporting mili-
I tary dictatorships as a bulwark
| against communism. The second
would be to provide a dynamic
leadership in the struggle against
j poverty and oppression, and lo
I give active support to the liberal
democratic forces hostile both to
| the Trujillos and to communism;
! the second would he to bet frank
ly on ihe "Caracas group." But
in the realities of our time (when
I so many senators identify all political
|litical agitation with communism l
1 this alternative may be out of
! Ihe question. The third and it is
| perhaps all Latin-American lib
erals can hope for is for the
1 United States to practice as well
I as preach non-interference, and to
I show some forbearance in manip
! u la ting the Organization of
American States. The third al
tentative is, simply' to allow the
i remaining dictatorships to die.
i Will the United States have the
moral courage to withdraw at
j long last from the indecencies of
Trujillo? So much distrust
i throughout Latin - America >
would seem too high a price to
pay for Santo Domingo's deathly
stability (where I found my sell'
breaking the law by carrying my
coat over my arm, where even
wealthy people leaving the Ca-
I thedral slunk to their cars with
only silent glances of recogni
; tion, where lulling music is piped
i over empty streets and parks,
j where the whole city seems a si
| lence) . . . and even too high a
j price to pay for a well-run missile
tracking station."
As 1959, so 1965. The "Caracas
group" here referred to was com
posed of former President Jose
Figueres of Costa Rica, the then
president Romulo Betancourt of
i Venezuela and Governor Luis
j Munoz-Morin of Puerto Rico. A
: few days ago their names appear
| ed in O.A.S. discussions as pos
isible mediators in the present
[crisis. The momentous question
today is whether President John
i son will now allow them to pro
! vide active leadership in working
! out a compromise? Or will their
non-communist democratic liberal
ism - which may be associated
roughly, in Washington terms,
with that of Arthur Schlesinger
Jr. and John Kenneth Galbraith,
seem too wildly dangerous to
those who, in this affair, have
found the President's ear?

• Viet Nam
Editor, The Daily:
A letter in Monday's Daily takes ]
issue with American action in

j Viet Nam, largely on the grounds
that "our pari icipation in the
war in Viei Nam has antagonized
I peoples around the world and
failed lo enlist the sympathy of
. . . the citizens of South Viet
! Nam." I am amazed. A state
! ment so basic to the argument of
[that letter should be substant
iated, and yet tho five cosigners
offer no evidence in its support.
It occurs to me, on examining the
situation, that the facts cannot
justify their hypothesis.
Aside from the France of
Charles de Gaulle, who currently
is making a policy of opposing al
most everything the United
States does, the only "peoples
around the world" who have
shown evidence of being "antago
nized" by U.S. policy in Viet Nam
are the Communist bloc nations
and certain neutralist nations of
Asia and Africa; and a look at
the United Nations voting record
indicates that most of these
"neutralist" nations have general
policies much more sympathetic
to Russian interests than to ours.
More important, practically the
entire Western bloc either sup
ports or does not oppose our pol
icy in Viet Nam.
I would also point <>ui that we
do have the sympathy of the
South Vietnamese. Two of the
three Vietnamese students at
Stanford have signed the V.D.C.
petition in support of firm U.S.
policy in their country: from
speaking with Air Force- men who
have been there, our military lias
been very well received by the
people of South Viet Nam; and
the morale of that nation, which
was slipping during American
election year hesitation, has now
risen so that even the Buddhist
leaders have called off all agita
tion .reportedly because they are
at last convinced that we intend
to win.
What, then, do Mr. Goff and
his friends consider to be "the
most honored principles and
ideals of the American people"
with which our Viet Nam policy
is "inconsistent"? I can think
of none.

force ("Army of the Liberation of

ganized on Cayo Confites for the
purpose of overthrowing Trujillo,
and for the restoration of true

State Department thwarted this;
invading force after ii bad already !
put to sea, but did so by using
a most reluctant Cuba as its po-j

I was in Cuba, Haiti and the Do

of another unsuccessful inva

bitterly remembered. Our insis

a police state.
Since then our methods have
become more forthright. I quote
with a shock of recognition and

returning from this Caribbean
trip in 1959:
"Three alternatives would seem

• U.S. Intervention
Editor, The Daily:
An historical analogy will in
dicate the progress we have made
in the techniques of Dominican in
tervention, for the purpose of
suppressing democratic aspira
tions. In 1917 a large military
force ("Army of the Liberation of
the Caribbean"), led by a Do
minican millionaire exile, was or
ganized on Cayo Confites for the
purpose of overthrowing Trujillo,
and for the restoration of true
constitutional government. The
State Department thwarted this;
invading force after ii bad already !
put to sea, but did so by using
a most reluctant Cuba as its po-j
licing instrument. In 1939, when

I was in Cuba, Haiti and the Do
minican Republic (at the moment
of another unsuccessful inva
sion), this episode was well and
bitterly remembered. Our insis
tence on the policy of non-inter
vention was clearly seen as a
form of intervention on behalf of
a police state.
Since then our methods have
become more forthright. I quote
with a shock of recognition and
dismay a paragraph I wrote after
returning from this Caribbean
trip in 1959:
"Three alternatives would seem
to exist for the United States. The
i first is to cling to ils present neg
ative policy of supporting mili-
I tary dictatorships as a bulwark
| against communism. The second
would be to provide a dynamic
leadership in the struggle against
j poverty and oppression, and lo
I give active support to the liberal

in the realities of our time (when

Editor, The Daily:
An historical analogy will in
dicate the progress we have made
in the techniques of Dominican in
tervention, for the purpose of
suppressing democratic aspira
tions. In 1917 a large military
force ("Army of the Liberation of
the Caribbean"), led by a Do
minican millionaire exile, was or
ganized on Cayo Confites for the
purpose of overthrowing Trujillo,
and for the restoration of true
constitutional government. The
State Department thwarted this;
invading force after ii bad already !
put to sea, but did so by using
a most reluctant Cuba as its po-j

I was in Cuba, Haiti and the Do

bitterly remembered. Our insis

a police state.
Since then our methods have
become more forthright. I quote
with a shock of recognition and
dismay a paragraph I wrote after
returning from this Caribbean
trip in 1959:
"Three alternatives would seem

Editor, The Daily:
A letter in Monday's Daily takes ]
issue with American action in

j Viet Nam, largely on the grounds
that "our pari icipation in the
war in Viei Nam has antagonized
I peoples around the world and
failed lo enlist the sympathy of
. . . the citizens of South Viet
! Nam." I am amazed. A state
! ment so basic to the argument of
[that letter should be substant
iated, and yet tho five cosigners
offer no evidence in its support.
It occurs to me, on examining the
situation, that the facts cannot
justify their hypothesis.
Aside from the France of
Charles de Gaulle, who currently
is making a policy of opposing al
most everything the United
States does, the only "peoples
around the world" who have
shown evidence of being "antago
nized" by U.S. policy in Viet Nam
are the Communist bloc nations
and certain neutralist nations of
Asia and Africa; and a look at
the United Nations voting record
indicates that most of these
"neutralist" nations have general
policies much more sympathetic
to Russian interests than to ours.
More important, practically the
entire Western bloc either sup
ports or does not oppose our pol
icy in Viet Nam.
I would also point <>ui that we
do have the sympathy of the
South Vietnamese. Two of the
three Vietnamese students at
Stanford have signed the V.D.C.
petition in support of firm U.S.
policy in their country: from
speaking with Air Force- men who
have been there, our military lias
been very well received by the
people of South Viet Nam; and
the morale of that nation, which
was slipping during American
election year hesitation, has now
risen so that even the Buddhist
leaders have called off all agita

at last convinced that we intend

What, then, do Mr. Goff and
