# OFF CAMPUS ISSUES
## Mackenzie, Shaw Support 'Prop. 2' 
### SANDY MACKENZIE ED SHAW 
Editor's note: The following is a joint
statement issued by ASSU President-Elect
Sandy Mackenzie and Speaker of Legisla
ture Ed Shaw explaining their stand* on
the "off-campus issues" controversy.
We believe that the student body should
defeat the proposition which would make
it impossible for LASSU to take any posi
tion on so-called "off-campus issues."
We strongly support the proposition that,
given certain important limitations, LASSU
should be able to represent student opinion
on any matter of deep concern to students.
Those who would constrict the powers of
the student legislature indefensibly main
tain that LASSU is neither responsible nor
representative and that such matters as
civil rights are not relevant to the the prop
er deliberations of student government.
We emphatically disagree. LASSU is, we
believe, both responsible and representative.
Matters of concern to the community and
the country are as relevant to students and
to student government as are matters of
campus concern alone.
LASSU Responsible
During the past few months, LASSU has
repeatedly demonstrated its ability to rec
ognize its obligations to the University com
munity and to act responsibly on those obli
gations. When inequities in the student ju
dicial system were revealed, LASSU intelli
gently investigated and debated and pro
mulgated changes in the judicial process.
When women's social regulations were
shown to be juvenile and unnecessarily
restrictive, LASSU, after considerable con
sultation, passed new regulations which
were praised by Dean Winbigler and ap
proved by the Committee on Student Af
fairs and Services, by President Sterling,
and by the Board of Trustees. When the
processes of student government were
threatened at Cal, LASSU endorsed the ef
forts of the ASUC to include graduate stu
dent representatives. When Sigma Chi sus
pended the Stanford chapter because ii had
pledged a Negro, LASSU joined with Presi
dent Sterling and numerous alumni in com
mending the local chapter and censuring
the national fraternity. Although the de
liberations of LASSU are sometimes tedi
ous, they are without doubt responsible.

Representative O|>inion
Not only are the actions of LASSU re
sponsible, they also accurately represent
student opinion. On any given action of the
legislature, students either approve, disap
prove, or have no opinion. Those without
any opinions can hardly argue that LASSU
misrepresents them. Those with an opinion
have an equal opportunity to demonstrate
that their opinion is that of the large ma
jority of the student body.
At present it is impossible for any mi
nority to manipulate the legislature;
LASSU has one representative for every 75
students, and only those students whose
representative fails to attend meetings can
complain that they are not adequately
represented. But the proposition which we
favor, generally known as "Proposition 2,"
officially and now called "alternative A,"
would provide additional limitations to in
sure fair representation. Under its provi
sions, LASSU could take a stand only on
issues "within its knowledge and compe
tence." In addition, such resolutions would
require a two-thirds roll call vote of the
legislature and could be considered only
after a week's delay following introduc
tion to permit legislators to consult with
their constituents. Moreover, the legisla
ture would be required to make petitions
available in White Memorial Plaza for those
who disagree with its stand; a referendum
would be mandatory if 10 per cent of the
student body signed such petitions.
Given these restrictions, successfully in
practice at Oberlin and the University of
Chicago, it is certain that LASSU's actions
would necessarily be representative.
Right to Represent
Since the students' legislature will be
both responsible and representative, it is
imperative that students do not deny their
legislators the right to represent them.
Stanford students, including legislators, are
not children; we are intelligent, well-edu
cated and able to make decision. We sup
port the legislature when it censures a na
tional fraternity for its racial bigotry.
Should we not also support the legislature
in censuring bigotry wherever it has been
proved to exist?
If we believe that the University should
not discriminate against minority groups in
its admission policy and hiring practices,
should we not also protest against discrim
ination elsewhere?

If we take a stand on federal aid to edu
cation at Stanford, on academic freedom
at Stanford, on students' rights at Stan
ford, on tenure policies at Stanford, on cur
riculum and grading practices at Stan
ford, should we not explicitly take similar
stands on these issues in the national aca
demic community?
Specious Distinct ion
In fact, the distinction between "on-cam
pus" and "off-campus" issues is often a
specious one. Students, like other citizens,
axe affected by events in Alabama and by
decisions in Washington. As students it is
our responsibility to make known our opin
ion on such events and actions.
For, as participants in the process of
education, we must not only learn from
society, we must be prepared to criticize
and educate society. We already do so
through our involvement in various po
litical organizations, through our support
of civil rights groups, through our partici
pation in the Peace Corps.
There is no adequate reason why we
should not also use the means offered by
student government, as long as student
government represents our views fairly.
Those who disagree, far from meaning that
LASSU will not represent them fairly, are
in fact afraid that their opinion will be
fairly represented. They must fear that
they are in the minority. Why else would
they be so reluctant to permit their legis
lature to take stands on such issues as
civil rights?
Model U.N.
No one wants LASSU to become a model
United Nations. The proposal which we
favor would prevent such a possibility. But
it would permit the legislature to make
public declarations of student opinion in
those crucial situations which deeply af
fect us all. Stanford is not, after all, an
ivory tower.
Recognizing our obligation to the com
munity and to ourselves, we must defeat
that proposal which would encourage ir
responsible citizenship. Recognizing that
LASSU must be responsible and represen
tative, we must defeat that proposal which
would encourage our governing legislature
body to ignore the opinions of many of its
constituents. Recognizing that students
need a ballot which presents a choice, we
must defeat that proposal which offers
none.
