# ORIGINAL PETITION SUPPORTED
## 'The Compromise' No Compromise 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR 
Three weeks of legislative bed
lam will finilly roach a climax
Monday who's students will vote
to decide wheiher LASSU shall
bo empowered to speak for
! iiom (hi off-campus political is
sues.
At the time of this writing
(Thursday evening), tho final bal
lot may include not only the orig
inal petition limiting LASSU, but
an additional proposal submitted
by a petition circulated Thurs
day.
That proposal, which was the
second proposition placed on the
ballot, last Monday by the Legis
lature and subsequently vetoed by
ASSU President Scott Mcßride,
deserves careful scrutiny.
This so-called "compromise"
proposition, which is supposed to
limit the Legislature in taking
stands on off-campus issues,
would provide little limitation at
all and would make any grass
roots resourse partieally imposs
sible.
A Bad Kill
In this respect it stands either
as tho most incompetently draft
ed measure to come out of LASSU
in a long time, or as a clever last
minute scheme to mislead the
electorate.
Tho proposition states that the
Legislature may express opinions
only on those issues "which are of
deep concern to the student body
and within the knowledge and
compctence of Legislature." But
LASSU has never been particular
ly modest in judging what lies
within its competence, and it
alone would be left to interprel
t he By-Law.
Further "limitations" in this
proposal are a required two-thirds
vote and a second reading, but
both of these can be overriden
under the rules of procedure by a
two-thirds vote. The worthless
noss of these "restrictions" was
revealed by the oft-quoted GCC

leader Gary Fcldman while argu
ing in LASSU last week against
having the Speaker of Legislature
I removable by only a two-thirds
| vote. Said Feldman: "Anybody
j can muster up a two-thirds vote
on anything."
The most absurd portion of
this proposal is the requirement
that, if students disagree with a
Legislature stand, they must
gather signatures from 10 per
cent or over 1000 of the students
on a petition in White Memorial
IN a/a within two days.
Impossible Requirement
No petition on any issue circu
lated in White Plaza for two days
has ever approached even 500
signatures, lot along 1000. Peti
tions supporting and opposing the
U.S. policy in Viet Nam barely
totaled 1000 signatures combined,
and then only after several days.
In short, this requirement makes
effective disagreement with Leg
islature impossible.
Furthermore, the purpose of
such a petition, if it ever did got
the required signatures, would
be to place the Legislature's stand
before the students. But under
the Constitution students can
place other proposals (including
Constitutional amendments) on
tho ballot by means of an initia
tive petit ion with about 500 signa
tures.
Tho final outrage of this "com
promise" proposition is the state
ment that if the 1000 signaures
are obtained, "(he position taken
by the Legislature may not be
represented as reflecting the
views of the student body." But of
course as soon as the Legislature
takes a stand, especially if it mails
its letters off to those world
leaders anxiously awaiting its
verdict, its stand is automatically
taken as representing tho stu
dents, particularly by the press
(including tho Palo Alto Times),
which can hardly bo barred from
the meetings.

After the Fact
Surely such stands should be
submitted to tho students before
the fact and not after. That is
precisely what the rejected Com
mittee of Five proposal would
have done, but the Legislature re
fused to place it on the ballot
or even to debate it.
Instead of filling the gaping
holes in the logic of their own
proposal, the LASSU activists
have resorted to a frantic attack
on tho original initiative proposi
tion and a general attempt to ob
scure the issue.
The original petition's oppon
ents have charged, for example,
that it prohibits any collective
student stand on political issues.
This is blatantly false. The peti
tion does not mention plebiscites,
and opinion polls and mock elec
tions can be hold at any time by
When a stand is so taken it be
comes not the position of the "As
sociated Students" but an expres
sion of the opinions of those who
vote. Representing the minority
as well as the majority, it cannot
be misconstrued and is much
more likely than LASSU to rep
resent an accurate division of
feeling on the campus.
Baseless Charge
A second, more serious—and
more baseless charge is that tho
proposal would also prohibit
many stands concerning on-cam
pus issues such as "academic re
form." But educational reform,
TA salaries, housing policy, etc.,
are all issues "pertaining to stu
dent affairs on the Stanford cam
pus." The proposal quite obvious
ly allows such stands.
Another charge is that the lan

gtiage of the original petition is
imprecise, Ihat it was drawn up
"in extreme haste," etc. But the
language has met all require
ments of legal precision for By-
Laws amendments and is in fact
unmistakeably elear. This clarity
I is a major reason for LASSU's at
i tempts to becloud the issue.
Finally, it is charged that the
j proposal 'strikes at the very
; foundations of representative gov
| ernment." But if this is true, the
i same charge applies to documents
I such as the U.S. Constitution and
the Bill of Rights, both of which
limit the powers of representa
! tivc government with "negative"
j language.
Students Speak for Themselves
The proposal merely limits the
} Legislature and leaves the expres
sion of political opinions entirely
to students - as individuals, in
i their separate voluntary organiza
tions. or in campus-wide mock
! elections.
i Those who wish to see the Leg
islature limited to issues truly
j within its competence, and who
I want to avoid being represented
[ on political matters by an orga-
I nidation which has been and can
i still be controlled by strictly mi
i nority factions, will vote a re
sounding "YES" on the original
initiative proposal.
But even if this initiative wins,
LASSU may have its way. Speak
er of LASSU Ed Shaw, who has
objected most vocally to this
"slap in the face of student gov
ernment,'' lias said that if the
original petition is passed, he will
i ask the Legislature to repeal it.
"Representative government," Ed?

Students Speak for Themselves
The proposal merely limits the
} Legislature and leaves the expres
sion of political opinions entirely
to students - as individuals, in
i their separate voluntary organiza
tions. or in campus-wide mock
! elections.
i Those who wish to see the Leg
islature limited to issues truly
j within its competence, and who
I want to avoid being represented
[ on political matters by an orga-
I nidation which has been and can
i still be controlled by strictly mi
i nority factions, will vote a re
sounding "YES" on the original
initiative proposal.
But even if this initiative wins,
LASSU may have its way. Speak
er of LASSU Ed Shaw, who has
objected most vocally to this
"slap in the face of student gov
ernment,'' lias said that if the
original petition is passed, he will
i ask the Legislature to repeal it.
"Representative government," Ed?
Three weeks of legislative bed
lam will finilly roach a climax
Monday who's students will vote
to decide wheiher LASSU shall
bo empowered to speak for
! iiom (hi off-campus political is
sues.
At the time of this writing
(Thursday evening), tho final bal
lot may include not only the orig
inal petition limiting LASSU, but
an additional proposal submitted
by a petition circulated Thurs
day.
That proposal, which was the
second proposition placed on the
ballot, last Monday by the Legis
lature and subsequently vetoed by
ASSU President Scott Mcßride,
deserves careful scrutiny.
This so-called "compromise"
proposition, which is supposed to
limit the Legislature in taking
stands on off-campus issues,
would provide little limitation at
all and would make any grass
roots resourse partieally imposs
sible.
A Bad Kill
In this respect it stands either
as tho most incompetently draft
ed measure to come out of LASSU
in a long time, or as a clever last
minute scheme to mislead the
electorate.
Tho proposition states that the
Legislature may express opinions
only on those issues "which are of
deep concern to the student body
and within the knowledge and
compctence of Legislature." But
LASSU has never been particular
ly modest in judging what lies
within its competence, and it
alone would be left to interprel
t he By-Law.
Further "limitations" in this
proposal are a required two-thirds
vote and a second reading, but
both of these can be overriden
under the rules of procedure by a
two-thirds vote. The worthless
noss of these "restrictions" was
revealed by the oft-quoted GCC

leader Gary Fcldman while argu
ing in LASSU last week against
having the Speaker of Legislature
I removable by only a two-thirds
| vote. Said Feldman: "Anybody
j can muster up a two-thirds vote
on anything."
The most absurd portion of
this proposal is the requirement
that, if students disagree with a
Legislature stand, they must
gather signatures from 10 per
cent or over 1000 of the students
on a petition in White Memorial
IN a/a within two days.
Impossible Requirement
No petition on any issue circu
lated in White Plaza for two days
has ever approached even 500
signatures, lot along 1000. Peti
tions supporting and opposing the
U.S. policy in Viet Nam barely
totaled 1000 signatures combined,
and then only after several days.
In short, this requirement makes
effective disagreement with Leg
islature impossible.
Furthermore, the purpose of
such a petition, if it ever did got
the required signatures, would
be to place the Legislature's stand
before the students. But under
the Constitution students can
place other proposals (including
Constitutional amendments) on
tho ballot by means of an initia
tive petit ion with about 500 signa
tures.
Tho final outrage of this "com
promise" proposition is the state
ment that if the 1000 signaures
are obtained, "(he position taken
by the Legislature may not be
represented as reflecting the
views of the student body." But of
course as soon as the Legislature
takes a stand, especially if it mails
its letters off to those world
leaders anxiously awaiting its
verdict, its stand is automatically
taken as representing tho stu
dents, particularly by the press
(including tho Palo Alto Times),
which can hardly bo barred from
the meetings.

After the Fact
Surely such stands should be
submitted to tho students before
the fact and not after. That is
precisely what the rejected Com
mittee of Five proposal would
have done, but the Legislature re
fused to place it on the ballot
or even to debate it.
Instead of filling the gaping
holes in the logic of their own
proposal, the LASSU activists
have resorted to a frantic attack
on tho original initiative proposi
tion and a general attempt to ob
scure the issue.
The original petition's oppon
ents have charged, for example,
that it prohibits any collective
student stand on political issues.
This is blatantly false. The peti
tion does not mention plebiscites,
and opinion polls and mock elec
tions can be hold at any time by
When a stand is so taken it be
comes not the position of the "As
sociated Students" but an expres
sion of the opinions of those who
vote. Representing the minority
as well as the majority, it cannot
be misconstrued and is much
more likely than LASSU to rep
resent an accurate division of
feeling on the campus.
Baseless Charge
A second, more serious—and
more baseless charge is that tho
proposal would also prohibit
many stands concerning on-cam
pus issues such as "academic re
form." But educational reform,
TA salaries, housing policy, etc.,
are all issues "pertaining to stu
dent affairs on the Stanford cam
pus." The proposal quite obvious
ly allows such stands.
Another charge is that the lan

(including tho Palo Alto Times),
which can hardly bo barred from
the meetings.

After the Fact
Surely such stands should be
submitted to tho students before
the fact and not after. That is
precisely what the rejected Com
mittee of Five proposal would
have done, but the Legislature re
fused to place it on the ballot
or even to debate it.
Instead of filling the gaping
holes in the logic of their own
proposal, the LASSU activists
have resorted to a frantic attack
on tho original initiative proposi
tion and a general attempt to ob
scure the issue.
The original petition's oppon
ents have charged, for example,
that it prohibits any collective
student stand on political issues.
This is blatantly false. The peti
tion does not mention plebiscites,
and opinion polls and mock elec
tions can be hold at any time by
When a stand is so taken it be
comes not the position of the "As
sociated Students" but an expres
sion of the opinions of those who
vote. Representing the minority
as well as the majority, it cannot
be misconstrued and is much
more likely than LASSU to rep
resent an accurate division of
feeling on the campus.
Baseless Charge
A second, more serious—and
more baseless charge is that tho
proposal would also prohibit
many stands concerning on-cam
pus issues such as "academic re
form." But educational reform,
TA salaries, housing policy, etc.,
are all issues "pertaining to stu
dent affairs on the Stanford cam
pus." The proposal quite obvious
ly allows such stands.
Another charge is that the lan

gtiage of the original petition is
imprecise, Ihat it was drawn up
"in extreme haste," etc. But the
language has met all require
ments of legal precision for By-
Laws amendments and is in fact
unmistakeably elear. This clarity
I is a major reason for LASSU's at
i tempts to becloud the issue.
Finally, it is charged that the
j proposal 'strikes at the very
; foundations of representative gov
| ernment." But if this is true, the
i same charge applies to documents
I such as the U.S. Constitution and
the Bill of Rights, both of which
limit the powers of representa
! tivc government with "negative"
j language.
Students Speak for Themselves
The proposal merely limits the
} Legislature and leaves the expres
sion of political opinions entirely
to students - as individuals, in
i their separate voluntary organiza
tions. or in campus-wide mock
! elections.
i Those who wish to see the Leg
islature limited to issues truly
j within its competence, and who
I want to avoid being represented
[ on political matters by an orga-
I nidation which has been and can
i still be controlled by strictly mi
i nority factions, will vote a re
sounding "YES" on the original
initiative proposal.
But even if this initiative wins,
LASSU may have its way. Speak
er of LASSU Ed Shaw, who has
objected most vocally to this
"slap in the face of student gov
ernment,'' lias said that if the
original petition is passed, he will
i ask the Legislature to repeal it.
"Representative government," Ed?
Three weeks of legislative bed
lam will finilly roach a climax
Monday who's students will vote
to decide wheiher LASSU shall
bo empowered to speak for
! iiom (hi off-campus political is
sues.
At the time of this writing
(Thursday evening), tho final bal
lot may include not only the orig
inal petition limiting LASSU, but
an additional proposal submitted
by a petition circulated Thurs
day.
That proposal, which was the
second proposition placed on the
ballot, last Monday by the Legis
lature and subsequently vetoed by
ASSU President Scott Mcßride,
deserves careful scrutiny.
This so-called "compromise"
proposition, which is supposed to
limit the Legislature in taking
stands on off-campus issues,
would provide little limitation at
all and would make any grass
roots resourse partieally imposs
sible.
A Bad Kill
In this respect it stands either
as tho most incompetently draft
ed measure to come out of LASSU
in a long time, or as a clever last
minute scheme to mislead the
electorate.
Tho proposition states that the
Legislature may express opinions
only on those issues "which are of
deep concern to the student body
and within the knowledge and
compctence of Legislature." But
LASSU has never been particular
ly modest in judging what lies
within its competence, and it
alone would be left to interprel
t he By-Law.
Further "limitations" in this
proposal are a required two-thirds
vote and a second reading, but
both of these can be overriden
under the rules of procedure by a
two-thirds vote. The worthless
noss of these "restrictions" was
revealed by the oft-quoted GCC

leader Gary Fcldman while argu
ing in LASSU last week against
having the Speaker of Legislature
I removable by only a two-thirds
| vote. Said Feldman: "Anybody
j can muster up a two-thirds vote
on anything."
The most absurd portion of
this proposal is the requirement
that, if students disagree with a
Legislature stand, they must
gather signatures from 10 per
cent or over 1000 of the students
on a petition in White Memorial
IN a/a within two days.
Impossible Requirement
No petition on any issue circu
lated in White Plaza for two days
has ever approached even 500
signatures, lot along 1000. Peti
tions supporting and opposing the
U.S. policy in Viet Nam barely
totaled 1000 signatures combined,
and then only after several days.
In short, this requirement makes
effective disagreement with Leg
islature impossible.
Furthermore, the purpose of
such a petition, if it ever did got
the required signatures, would
be to place the Legislature's stand
before the students. But under
the Constitution students can
place other proposals (including
Constitutional amendments) on
tho ballot by means of an initia
tive petit ion with about 500 signa
tures.
Tho final outrage of this "com
promise" proposition is the state
ment that if the 1000 signaures
are obtained, "(he position taken
by the Legislature may not be
represented as reflecting the
views of the student body." But of
course as soon as the Legislature
takes a stand, especially if it mails
its letters off to those world
leaders anxiously awaiting its
verdict, its stand is automatically
taken as representing tho stu
dents, particularly by the press
(including tho Palo Alto Times),
which can hardly bo barred from

| vote. Said Feldman: "Anybody
j can muster up a two-thirds vote
on anything."
The most absurd portion of
this proposal is the requirement
that, if students disagree with a
Legislature stand, they must
gather signatures from 10 per
cent or over 1000 of the students
on a petition in White Memorial
IN a/a within two days.
Impossible Requirement
No petition on any issue circu
lated in White Plaza for two days
has ever approached even 500
signatures, lot along 1000. Peti
tions supporting and opposing the
U.S. policy in Viet Nam barely
totaled 1000 signatures combined,
and then only after several days.
In short, this requirement makes
effective disagreement with Leg
islature impossible.
Furthermore, the purpose of
such a petition, if it ever did got
the required signatures, would
be to place the Legislature's stand
before the students. But under
the Constitution students can
place other proposals (including
Constitutional amendments) on
tho ballot by means of an initia
tive petit ion with about 500 signa
tures.
Tho final outrage of this "com
promise" proposition is the state
ment that if the 1000 signaures
are obtained, "(he position taken
by the Legislature may not be
represented as reflecting the
views of the student body." But of
course as soon as the Legislature
takes a stand, especially if it mails
its letters off to those world
leaders anxiously awaiting its
verdict, its stand is automatically
taken as representing tho stu
dents, particularly by the press
(including tho Palo Alto Times),
which can hardly bo barred from
the meetings.

After the Fact
Surely such stands should be
submitted to tho students before
the fact and not after. That is
precisely what the rejected Com
mittee of Five proposal would
have done, but the Legislature re
fused to place it on the ballot
or even to debate it.
Instead of filling the gaping
holes in the logic of their own
proposal, the LASSU activists
have resorted to a frantic attack
on tho original initiative proposi
tion and a general attempt to ob
scure the issue.
The original petition's oppon
ents have charged, for example,
that it prohibits any collective
student stand on political issues.
This is blatantly false. The peti
tion does not mention plebiscites,
and opinion polls and mock elec
tions can be hold at any time by
When a stand is so taken it be
comes not the position of the "As
sociated Students" but an expres
sion of the opinions of those who
vote. Representing the minority
as well as the majority, it cannot
be misconstrued and is much
more likely than LASSU to rep
resent an accurate division of
feeling on the campus.
Baseless Charge
A second, more serious—and
more baseless charge is that tho
proposal would also prohibit
many stands concerning on-cam
pus issues such as "academic re
form." But educational reform,
TA salaries, housing policy, etc.,
are all issues "pertaining to stu
dent affairs on the Stanford cam
pus." The proposal quite obvious
ly allows such stands.
Another charge is that the lan

gtiage of the original petition is
imprecise, Ihat it was drawn up
"in extreme haste," etc. But the
language has met all require
ments of legal precision for By-
Laws amendments and is in fact
unmistakeably elear. This clarity
I is a major reason for LASSU's at
i tempts to becloud the issue.
Finally, it is charged that the
j proposal 'strikes at the very
; foundations of representative gov
| ernment." But if this is true, the
i same charge applies to documents
I such as the U.S. Constitution and
the Bill of Rights, both of which
limit the powers of representa
! tivc government with "negative"
j language.
Students Speak for Themselves
The proposal merely limits the
} Legislature and leaves the expres
sion of political opinions entirely
to students - as individuals, in
i their separate voluntary organiza
tions. or in campus-wide mock
! elections.
i Those who wish to see the Leg
islature limited to issues truly
j within its competence, and who
I want to avoid being represented
[ on political matters by an orga-
I nidation which has been and can
i still be controlled by strictly mi
i nority factions, will vote a re
sounding "YES" on the original
initiative proposal.
But even if this initiative wins,
LASSU may have its way. Speak
er of LASSU Ed Shaw, who has
objected most vocally to this
"slap in the face of student gov
ernment,'' lias said that if the
original petition is passed, he will
i ask the Legislature to repeal it.
"Representative government," Ed?
