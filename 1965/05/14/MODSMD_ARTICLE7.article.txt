# CHAPPIE REVIEW
## Obscenity Unlimited 
### JAMES BRISCOE 
The latest issue of the Chaparral, on sale today,
purports to be a satire on the recent Free Speech
Movement at Berkeley.
However, on reading it, one suspects that the
tenets of the so-called "Filthy Speech Movement"
were much closer to the Chappies' minds. For, in
sexual and obscene overtones, this issue goes well
beyond what even former Chappie editors have
considered "the edge of grossness."
But, as the recent bare-bosom trials in San Fran
cisco have made abundantly clear, any such
limits of decency and morality must be determined
by the standards of the community aland and
we suspect that few Stanford students indeed will
be genuinely shocked by the contents of this issue.
At times. however, the presentation does seem
a little unnecessarily crude. A slightly more subtle
approach in a few instances would seem to be
called for.
Much more appalling is the steorot.yped and
shopworn image of activists which pops up again
and again in the magazine.
The "Complete Beat" feature which starts off
the magazine more or less typifies this concept
that activists arc usually "Beatniks" interested
only in free love and "pot."
It features two rather neartly drawn figures
which presume to represent the "typical" male and
female activist. Explicitly labeled in the man
ner <>t Chester Gould are such things as ' Mutt for
sit-ins." "marijuana cigarettes," "withered free
love mind." and with an arrow pointing toward the
female's pelvic region, again, "withered by free
love."
This general theme is repeated, again and again
i hroughout the issue.
Elsewhere, with what max or may not be qurs
t ionablr content programming, the; Chappie con

tains one of its better features a parody of The
Daily.
The parody is thoroughly gross, but in general,
quite clever.
Outstanding features are the "News in Brief"
section with such stories as "Linda Bird Goes to
the Toilet," and the top right story about a "sleep
out" staged by Stanford coeds in protest of so
cial regs.
Major disappointments are the weather which
is neither as obscene nor as funny as many which
have actually appeared in The Daily, and the
rumors column b\ Just Beckon, which is simply
a toned down, and not very clever imitation of the
original.
Other features in the magazine include Tim
Haight's brief essay on the world as seen through
a hot dog. and a very interesting although some
what obscure play by Don Hendrie entitled "Ye
Lumpwoods and ye Foxes."
There is also a solid little blurb entitled "Bo
hemia Lost" written by one Svelton Svetos pre
suming to describe a beat-type party. The editor's
note says that the manuscript was found in an
alley in San Francisco which seems to us the very
best place for it.
In a very welcome depature from t h<« tradtional
"Old Boy's Queen" feature, Li/. Kulin, the star of
"Once Upon a Mattress," appears as Euglena Hay
dork in an amusing parody of a past "Playboy of
the Year" spread. The purpose is presumably to
publicize the Chappies' upcoming "Layboy Revisit
ed" issue although one severely doubts that it
needs further publicity beyond the eyecatching
preview of it elsewhere in the magazine.
Highlighting the numerous cartoon panels is a
new rendition by Paul Mcrta of the old story of
the Chicken and the Egg.
All in all it is a very interesting issue, admir

The latest issue of the Chaparral, on sale today,
purports to be a satire on the recent Free Speech
Movement at Berkeley.
However, on reading it, one suspects that the
tenets of the so-called "Filthy Speech Movement"
were much closer to the Chappies' minds. For, in
sexual and obscene overtones, this issue goes well
beyond what even former Chappie editors have
considered "the edge of grossness."
But, as the recent bare-bosom trials in San Fran
cisco have made abundantly clear, any such
limits of decency and morality must be determined
by the standards of the community aland and
we suspect that few Stanford students indeed will
be genuinely shocked by the contents of this issue.
At times. however, the presentation does seem
a little unnecessarily crude. A slightly more subtle
approach in a few instances would seem to be
called for.
Much more appalling is the steorot.yped and
shopworn image of activists which pops up again
and again in the magazine.
The "Complete Beat" feature which starts off
the magazine more or less typifies this concept
that activists arc usually "Beatniks" interested
only in free love and "pot."
It features two rather neartly drawn figures
which presume to represent the "typical" male and
female activist. Explicitly labeled in the man
ner <>t Chester Gould are such things as ' Mutt for
sit-ins." "marijuana cigarettes," "withered free
love mind." and with an arrow pointing toward the
female's pelvic region, again, "withered by free
love."
This general theme is repeated, again and again
i hroughout the issue.
Elsewhere, with what max or may not be qurs
t ionablr content programming, the; Chappie con

tains one of its better features a parody of The
Daily.
The parody is thoroughly gross, but in general,
quite clever.
Outstanding features are the "News in Brief"
section with such stories as "Linda Bird Goes to
the Toilet," and the top right story about a "sleep
out" staged by Stanford coeds in protest of so
cial regs.
Major disappointments are the weather which
is neither as obscene nor as funny as many which
have actually appeared in The Daily, and the
rumors column b\ Just Beckon, which is simply
a toned down, and not very clever imitation of the
original.
