# Legislature Upholds Veto; Vote Postponed to Monday
## Regret Expressed At President' Action 
### 
A resolution expressing disapproval ol ASSI President Scott
Mcßride's veto of the Legislature s action on the oil-campus issue
ballot was passed, 47-37, at last night's special meeting of LASS I'
after it became apparent that the body would not override the veto.
The resolution, proposed by Tim llaight, read:

"The Legislature upholds the
action of the President of the
ASSU in exercising his right to
veto, but regrets that he chose to
exercise this power rattier than
call a meeting of this body the!
duly constituted interpreter of
the Constitution -and it hopes
that no president in the future
will feel forced to take similar
action."
Original Proposition Only
Thus, the only official question 1
put on the ballot for Monday's ;
vote will be the original proposi
; lion submitted to LASSU by peti
tion thai "the government of the j
: ASSU shall not take positions on
matters other than those pertain
| ing to student affairs on the Stan- j
j ford campus."
However, under a proposal
; passed by the Legislature which
I Meßride accepted as const it u- i
| tional the two additional pro
posals would be placed on the;
I ballot as part of a "sample poll" |
ito solicit student opinion.
| The Legislature can still over !
j ride the student body by a two
thirds vote even if tiie student
| body passes t.he official proposi
■ tion.
Although a petition embodying
the principles of the compromise
i proposition number 2 is present
ily being circulated, it cannot go
on the ballot Monday since an in
! terlude of six days is mandatory
between the submission of such
'a petition and its resolution by
! the voters.
Compromise Proposition
This compromise proposition
I would allow LASSU to speak out
on off-campus issues which were
"within its knowledge and eompe
tence" only if two-thirds of the
1 membership agreed. Such action
would be subject to an all-campus
referendum if ten per cent of the
j electorate signed a petition call
j ing for a vote.
I The decision not to override
i was reached only after along de
bate on the constitutionality, pro
cedure and motives involved in
i Mcßride's action.
Meßride explained that he had
vetoed the addition of the two al
tentative by-law proposals "solely
on constitutional grounds."
President's Veto Power
The question of whether the
i President is empowered thus to
interpret the constitution is ir
relevant, since the President may
[veto any action of LASSU for
any reason whatsoever, he said.
The addition of the two altern
ative proposals was not criticized
earlier because, until yesterday,
no one had sufficient legal in
formation to determine the consti
tutionality of the action.
The action proposed by the
| Rules Committee was that
| LASSU first override Mcßride's
veto and then declare its own ac
tion of Monday night unconstitu
tional.

override was a section in the
Constitution whi eh explicitly
gives the Legislature the power
of constitutional interpretation.
The effect would havq been e.\-
pJicitly to prohibit the ASSU
President from vetoing an action
on constitutional grounds with
out first consulting Ihe Legisla
ture.
Meßride stated after the meet
ing, "I am pleased that the Leg
islature saw fit to sustain my
veto."
"Once again I want to empha
size that my decision to veto the
Legislature's action on Monday.
May 10, was not predicated on a
personal proclivity for any pro
posal, but rather was based on
the constitutional question of the
Legislature's power to take such
act ion.
"1 am grieved that the Legis
lature did not feel that I pro
ceeded in a proper manner in ex
ercising the veto," he contonued.
"I considered calling a meeting
of the Legislature Thursday
night, and thereby not exercising
my power.
"However, 1 was fully con
vinced that a quorum could not be
achieved under these conditions.
Had this occurred, the constitu
tional question could never have
been properly considered."
Mike Matheson. chairman of
the Rules Committee, which
urged that Meßride lie overruled,
was accused of carrying out a
"personal vendetta" by one mem
ber.
Tim Haight defended Mathe
son. Uo pointed out that although
lie personally agreed with Mr-
Bride's veto, he disagreed with
his procedure. "If the Speaker
had not been able to convene the
Legislature tonight, then a vote
would have been held Friday be
cause of one man's decision."
