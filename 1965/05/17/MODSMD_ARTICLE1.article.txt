## 
### JOEL KUGELMASS 
Today 40,000 American soldiers are fighting
in Viet Nam.
Students and faculty have responded to the
urgency of this situation by arranging a
"Teach-In," the eightieth such program in the
nation. The fourteen-hour marathon is in
tended to both emphasize the significance of
the Viet Nam conflict and to provide a divers
ity of opinion and basic information. The
Teach-In hopes to stimulate the highest possi
ble quality of student thinking and discussion.
John Horner and Hans Morgenthau are the
principle speakers; Horner, director of the
Public Affairs Bureau in the Department of
State, will argue the Administration's position

by Leopold Haimson, professor of Russian his
tory at the University of Chicago, and Fran/.
Schurmann, Director of the Institute of Chi
nese Studies at Berkeley, will confront Mr.
Horner, Gordon Craig, Stanford professor of
history, and Milorad Drachkoviteh of the
Hoover Institute. The panel will offer the
gamut of criticisms and defenses of United
States policy in Viet Nam.
Stanford's Teach-In has attracted acclaimed
specialists who will apply their particular
studies to the Viet Nam crisis. Erik Erikson,
noted pyschologist from Harvard analyzes
aggression at 7:00 p.m. tonight; at noon, the
"Committee" from San Francisco satrizes "the
contemporary scene." At 11:00 p.m. the San
Francisco Mime Troupe presents The Exeep

tion and the Rule, Bertold Brecht's attack on
mass morality.
The program will start at Memorial Audi
torium and move to Tresidder Union at 1:00
p.m.; at 3:45 p.m. the Teach-in continues in
Memorial Auditorium at least until to 3:00

a.m. Tuesday morning. There will be free ad
mission, KZSU will broadcast the Teach-In live
starting at 3:45 p.m. except from 11:00 p.m.
to 1:00 a.m. when the Tresidder Union portion
will be rebroadcast.
Viet Nam Day has been nationally common

place since the University ol Michigan held
the original Teach-In in March; however, to
day's Teach-in marks the first time Stanford
faculty and students have coordinated a pro
gram on an off-campus issue. In late April a
letter signed by several professors was sent

to the entire Stanford faculty asking for fi
nancial and organizational assistance. One
hundred and thirty faculty members initially
answered; shortly thereafter sixty more re
sponded. Over $1,000 was raised in this way,
as well as contacts for the Vict Nam Day
speakers.
The following professors were particularly
active in Viet Nam Day planning: Charles
Drekmeier, Political Science; Karel DeLeeuw,
Mathematics; Charles Stein, Statistics; Paul
Wallin, Sociology; Claude Buss, History; A 1
belt Gucrard, English; Wilfred Stone, Eng
lish; Lincoln Moses, Statistics; Thomas Plaut,
Human Problems Institute; Robert Loper,
Speech and Drama; Kenneth Mills, Philoso
phy; and Ray Bacchetti, Assistant Dean of the
Humanities and Science.
Many students were innvolved, especially
Mare Sapir, Keith Lowe, Steve Marx, Sandra
Drake, David Fra/.er, Tom Cook, and Mike
Pillsbury.

An intensive campaign of doorbell ringing
and public speaking highlights the plan of an
ad hoe student committee to extend tonight's
Teach-in to Palo Alto on Tuesday.
Designed primarily to promote discussion
about United States policy in Viet Nam, the
committee will also circulate petitions oppos
ing present policy.
Stephen Smith, committee spokesman, ex
plained that "by engaging Palo Allans in dis
cussion on Tuesday, we will definitely further
our own education, hopefully that of the com
munity, and will indicate that we are suf
ficiently disturbed about U.S. policy in Viet
Nam to try to alter it."

Students and faculty have responded to the
