# Ralston 'Dissappointedâ€™ But . . .
## Lewis Sparkles in Win 
### JOHN MERRILL 
Stanford Alumni returned to
Stanford Stadium Saturday to be
greeted by 3,200 sun-baked fans
and a varsity team that seemed
content to let the grads tire them
selves out before launching a 34
point second half to win, 41 10.
Coach John Ralston was "great
ly disappointed with the entire
performance, especially with the
intensity and the hitting." One
bright spot was the fine play of
quarterback Dave Lewis. Lewis
took up where he left off in last
year's Big Game, passing for two
touchdowns and running for two
more, though he played only half
t he game.
The varsity opened the scoring,
taking an Alumni punt and go
ing 57 yards in 12 plays, with
Lewis passing to Donn Renwick
for the score. The Alumni came
back with Dick Norman riddling
the varsity pass defense for the
second straight year.
Norman Leads Alumni Attack
Norman repeatedly hit Dick
Ragsdale, Jack Taylor, and Gary
Van Galder with short swing

passes. The grads scored on a
short pass from Norman to Rags
dale with 12:09 left in the sec
ond quarter. Braden Beck added
a field goal from 27 yards and
the Alums led at half 10-7.
In the second half, the varsity
concentrated on Dave Lewis' op
tion plays and the hard running
of fullgack John Read. Read led
all rushers with 76 yards gained
for the day and scored once.
The varsity took the second
half kickoff and marched 03
yards in 9 plays with Lewis going
over on a keeper. John Brodie of
the 49er's came in to lead the
Alums, but was welcomed by the
first concerted Stanford rush of
the day.
Brodie completed two of five
passes and had one intercepted
I that led to a Stanford touchdown.
One one play Brodie was chased
back 25 yards into his end zone
by a strong rush led by sopho
more Phil Schneider before he
was able to get his pass away.

Stanford Alumni returned to

and a varsity team that seemed
content to let the grads tire them
selves out before launching a 34
point second half to win, 41 10.
Coach John Ralston was "great
ly disappointed with the entire
performance, especially with the
intensity and the hitting." One
bright spot was the fine play of

touchdowns and running for two
more, though he played only half
t he game.
The varsity opened the scoring,
taking an Alumni punt and go
ing 57 yards in 12 plays, with

dale with 12:09 left in the sec

a field goal from 27 yards and
the Alums led at half 10-7.
In the second half, the varsity
concentrated on Dave Lewis' op
tion plays and the hard running
of fullgack John Read. Read led
all rushers with 76 yards gained
for the day and scored once.

half kickoff and marched 03
yards in 9 plays with Lewis going
over on a keeper. John Brodie of
