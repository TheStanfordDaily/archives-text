# Of Lotus Pads and Teach-Ins
## 
### 
Not too many springtimes ago, a somewhat
embittered San Francisco Examiner reporter
toured our "lotus pad of academe" and ob
served, with some sure justice, that "the explod
ing outside world luis not yet pushed Stanford
out of its comfortable self-made shape.'
Well, a lot's happened at Stanford since the
Examiner chose to chide us for our bourgeois
complacency.
Forty Stanford students and faculty have
lell the shade of the Stanford palm fronds to
risk their lives under the Mississippi sun. In a
less dramatic gesture, many dozens of students
have given of their school year time to partici
pate iu work projects and to tutor in East Palo
Alto.
And now, today, over 150 members of the
faeulty and many more hundreds of students
are expected to participate in a fourteen-hour
Viet Nam "Teach-In."
U.S. involvement in Viet Nam—the folly of our
policy and the supression of criticism which has
rendered that folly almost sinister—lias aroused
the national academic community like no other
issue since civil rights.
At a time when our statesmen and politicians

have become suddenly mute and our magazines
and newspapers have learned anew to cower
before presidential "sensitivity," only the aca
demic community has stood firm in its dissent.
Our national conduct in Viet Nam (and more
recently, and more blatantly, in the Dominican
Republic) may move us to extremes of dis
pleasure—even shame. But the response of the
academic community to that conduct need not.
Indeed, it should rather give us a certain
sense of pride and a sure suggestion of hope
hope that American universities, and Stanford
not the least among these—have come to recog
nize that their role is not merely to preserve and
promote what is best in our society but also to
criticize and condemn that which is worst.
Public debate of public issues is essential to
the health of a democratic society. Todays
Viet Nam "Teach-In" provides an open oppor
tunity for such debate, and in so doing gives some
real measure of meaning to our rather pompons
motto "Die Luff dcr Freihcit Welti"
Now, in this springtime, the "exploding out
side world" has touched us at last. And we it.
And Stanford, one hopes, will not soon or easily
return to the "somewhat warm and protective co
coon' that has been our home for all too long.

Viet Nam "Teach-In" provides an open oppor
tunity for such debate, and in so doing gives some
real measure of meaning to our rather pompons
motto "Die Luff dcr Freihcit Welti"
Now, in this springtime, the "exploding out
side world" has touched us at last. And we it.
And Stanford, one hopes, will not soon or easily
return to the "somewhat warm and protective co
coon' that has been our home for all too long.
Not too many springtimes ago, a somewhat
embittered San Francisco Examiner reporter
toured our "lotus pad of academe" and ob
served, with some sure justice, that "the explod
ing outside world luis not yet pushed Stanford
out of its comfortable self-made shape.'
Well, a lot's happened at Stanford since the
Examiner chose to chide us for our bourgeois
complacency.
Forty Stanford students and faculty have
lell the shade of the Stanford palm fronds to
risk their lives under the Mississippi sun. In a
less dramatic gesture, many dozens of students
have given of their school year time to partici
pate iu work projects and to tutor in East Palo
Alto.
And now, today, over 150 members of the
faeulty and many more hundreds of students
are expected to participate in a fourteen-hour
Viet Nam "Teach-In."
U.S. involvement in Viet Nam—the folly of our
policy and the supression of criticism which has
rendered that folly almost sinister—lias aroused
the national academic community like no other
issue since civil rights.
At a time when our statesmen and politicians

have become suddenly mute and our magazines
and newspapers have learned anew to cower
before presidential "sensitivity," only the aca
demic community has stood firm in its dissent.
Our national conduct in Viet Nam (and more
recently, and more blatantly, in the Dominican
Republic) may move us to extremes of dis
pleasure—even shame. But the response of the
academic community to that conduct need not.
Indeed, it should rather give us a certain
sense of pride and a sure suggestion of hope
hope that American universities, and Stanford
not the least among these—have come to recog
nize that their role is not merely to preserve and
promote what is best in our society but also to
criticize and condemn that which is worst.
Public debate of public issues is essential to
the health of a democratic society. Todays
