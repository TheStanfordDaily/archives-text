# No on Proposition 1

### 
l'oday the Stanford student body will go to
the polls and vote on whether or not to allow
the ASSU to demand the withdrawal of U.S.
troops from Viet Nam.
You see, it seems there's this super-radical ac
tivist organization called the Legislature which
is just dying to misrepresent the students on all
sorts of issues like that.
Or so we gather, at least, from many of the
statements we have seen and heard this past
week concerning the vote today on the so
called "off-campus issues" question.
Its funny, though; we thought the vote was
on something quite different.
Or perhaps not so much funny as a little
sinister—as all cynical distortion is sinister.

For, in fact (which means Mr. Naylor and
Mr. Bonine aside) the "off-campus issues" ques
tion involves nothing more radical or contro
versial than a logical fulfillment of representa
tion democracy on the Stanford campus.
A "no" vote today hardly implies the gift of
an all-encompassing mandate for action. It
would merely suggest a minimum vote of con
fidence.
"Proposition One"—the only official alternative
on the ballot—would, summarily prohibit LASSU
from representing the opinion of Stanford stu
dents on any "off-campus issues."
It is a un-compromising, un-thinking, ill-con
ceived, and entirely negative proposal and
should be resoundingly defeated.
