## Arguments Against Prop. 2 Just Don't Hold Water 
### Justin Beck 
For the past few weeks faithful readers of The Daily editorial
page have undergone the one-two punch of John Bonine and Bob
Naylor, the Mantle and Maris of the local Young Republican
chapter, urging a "resounding YES" 011 the proposition barring stu
dent government from representing students 011 off-campus issues.

Ever since LASSU Rep. Jim"
Greenley, a former YR himself,
drew up the petition on off-cam
pus issues, both Naylor and
Bonine have busied themselves at
tacking alternatives to the pro
posed strict ban and blasting the
liberals, like ASSU President
elect Sandy Mackenzie and
LASSU speaker Ed Shaw, who op
pose Greenley's petition.
Some of their arguments are
worth looking into.
First it is charged that the
whole idea of have the Legislature
speak on off-campus issues is a
Graduate Coordinating Commit
tee project, and that the GCC con
trols the Legislature. This ignores
a few facts—first, student gov
ernment has been interested in
off-campus issues since 1962 when
the Legislature urged that radio
station KPFA have its FCC li
cense renewed. Also in that year
LASSU took stands on two prop
ositions on the California ballot.
When the new constitution was
being written in 1961-62 the ma
jor reason for enlarging the Leg
islature was to make it more rep
resentative, in order that it be
able to take such stands while
representing the student body.
Berkeley Stands
This year too, the Legislature
has twice taken stands on events
in Berkeley, once supporting the
principle of free speech on col
lege campuses and the other time
supporting the principle of grad
uate representation in student
government.
Neither time did the student
body protest that the Legislature
was misrepresenting them. And
the first off-campus resolution
was passed long before the GCC
had seats on the Legislature, in
dicating at least that student con
cern for off-campus issues is not
limited to GCC members, and
that with or without the GCC,
a good number of Legislature
members feel that there are some
off-campus issues on w hi c h
LASSU can and should speak for
the student body.
The most interesting argument
made in favor of the proposition
is that unless the Legislature is
stopped it will start taking stands
on Viet Nam and other political
issues. In fact, that charge is
baseless.
No one, including the GCC has
ever mentioned Viet Nam in the
Legislature, and 110 resolution on
the issue has ever been intro
duced or even drafter.
Barry Goklwater
But Bonine and Naylor have re
peatedly dragged this "issue" out
as an example of what the Legis
lature wants to consider. Not
since the pre-election predictions
of a Barry Goklwater victory
have conservatives shown so
much imagination based on such
little fact.
Next it is argued that rather
than have the Legislature repre

►
sent the student body, it is far
better to have mock elections in
order to show that not everyone
agrees on each issue.
While it is tine that passage of
the proposition would not pre
vent mock elections and opinion
polls, it would prevent the Legis
lature from drawing any con
clusions from them, or even from
taking any action once it found
out what the students' opinions
were.
If LASSU felt that academic
freedom, for example, was being
abridged somewhere, the ASSU
could hold a mock election on
the subject of academic freedom
—but nothing more.
Even if the mock election
showed 90 per cent of the stu
dentry opposed this abridgement,
no official statement of protest
could be made.
It. is also argued that the com
promise proposal (Alternative A)
is worthless; that it is no com
promise and that it wouldn't
work. This ignores the fact that it
has been used successfully at both
the University of Chicago and at
Oberlin.
No Limitations
They argue that the limitations
set by the proposal on the Legis
lature are not really limitations
at all, and they conjure up a most
fearsome spectacle of the Legis
lature on a rampage virtually ig
noring every provision of the pro
posed by-law while overriding its
own rules of procedure.
And yet on this mythical issue
about which the Legislature feels
so strongly, the rest of the stu
dent body is so apathetic that it is
impossible to get ten per cent of
the students to sign a petition ob
jecting to the Legislature's stand,
even though a majority are op
posed to it.
It makes interesting reading,
but for fiction, James Bond is
bet ter.
Finally they present the cur
rent issue as a struggle between
a radical power mad Legislature
and the student body, hinting that
there is a great deal of difference
between the opinions of students
on the Legislature and the rest
of the students. It is true that
the Legislature is much more lib
eral in its views than either Nay
lor or Bonine, or even the two
put together, but then aren't
most of us.
It is scarcely the case that the
fate of Stanford or even of the
ASSU hinges on the passage or
defeat: of the proposition today.
Whether it passes or fails, stu
dent government will continue the
same course next year that it has
for tho past year.
But if the student body acts to
day to silence the Legislature on
off-campus issues, they should re
member that the only people that
they will be silencing is them
selves.
