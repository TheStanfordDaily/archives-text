# SOUTH AFRICAN CONFERENCE
## U.S. Position in S. Africa 
### BOB EGELKO 
The United States' failure to
impose economic sanctions on the
Union of South Africa is based
on no desire to preserve the sta
tus quo, but rather on the belief
that such sanction would not
solve the apartheid problem, State
Department official Waldermar
Campbell told a South Africa Con
ference gathering Saturday.
"America does not have the nec
essary economic or political in flu

ence to make unilateral sanctions
practical," Campbell, officer-in
charge of East and South African
Affairs for the State Department,
| explained.
"We are neither the leading in
| vestors nor the leading traders
in South Africa. American capital
in all types of investment only
accounted for 3.5 per ccnt of
total capital in South Africa be
tween 1950 and 19G3 . . . our eco
nomic sanctions probably would
not affect the other leading inves
tors."
U.S. Condemn Apartheid
Campbell, who earned his Ph.D.
at Berkeley, emphasized that the
I States joins the majority of the
United Nations in morally con
deming apartheid, the official
South African policy of "separate
: development."
He cited U.N. Ambassador
Stevenson's comment that the
white South Africans, or Afrikan
ers, "see the disease as the
remedy," that "for the malady of
racism they prescribe the bitter
| toxic of apartheid."
More programatieally said
[Campbell, "Our government does
not believe that the policy of sep-
I arate devolpment . . . will work.
IWe see apartheid antagonizing
! groups, rather than avoiding fric
tion through racial separation, as
j the South Africans claim."
Campbell denied that economic
pressure from South African in
terests had influenced the State
Department's position.
South African l-'ro^surc
"A: for youth Ain ,; Jii pre*
sure, the U.S. does not regard as

essential anything that it gets in
South Africa. The NASA tracking
station, the many good ports, the
gold outflow all these are con
venient but not essential. They
could not influence our policy."
J This country regards South
I Africa as primarily a political
| problem, Campbell said. And po
litically, Washington's concern is
with the representativeness and
[.stability of the Verwoerd govern
| ment, a matter in which Campbell
I echoes his department's pessi
I mism.
"People in South Africa have
stopped hoping for gradual im
provement," he observed. There
were hopes that the economic
I boom would lessen the tension. It
! has not and probably will not.
Minority Itule
"The only trend is toward more
repressive minority rule, as great
er numbers of Africans flow into
the cities in the south. The histor
ical decline in political rights for
(the non-whites is continuing, and
| the influence of the white minor-
I ity is increasing proportionally."
Campbell reiterated, however,
I that economic sanctions were not
jt he answer. Even multilateral
sanctions would fall, he said,
without the support of the key in-
I vestors the implication being
[that this support is lacking,
i Present hope for change I torn
j the outside lies in a case now be
fore the World Court at The
Hague, in which South Africa is
accused of misusing its U.N.
Trusteeship in Southwest Africa.
"The decision," declared Camp
bell, "must be accepted and en
forced."
