# Tribe Loss 'Ends' Year
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The race for the CIBA baseball
championship which has been
close all year is coming to a nail
biting conclusion this week.
Stanford missed its opportunity
I to take the crown last weekend
!by losing two games to Santa
Clara, 10-7 and,"5-4.
As it stands now Stanford and
j Cal are tied for first with identi
| cal 12-8 records. Santa Clara is in
j third with a 9-8 record. But if the
I Broncos can win their next three
games, there will be a three way
tie for first. The Broncos have a
game with USC Tuesday and a
t doubleheader with Santa Barbara
I Wednesday. All the games are
j away.

lost 5-4 Saturday to set up the
possibility of a three-way tie for
the CIBA pennant.
These are make-up games and
Stanford and Cal can only sit by
and watch since their schedules
are completed. If Santa Clara
loses once they would be elimi
nated from the race with nine
losses. It would also hand Stan
ford the trip to the play-offs since
Stanford beat Cal 3 out of 4 times
this year.
Should Santa Clara emerge vic
torious from their road trip there
will be a complicated three way
tie for first. The difficulty is in
who should go into the play-offs.
Santa Clara has beat Stanford
3 out of four times, while Cal and
Santa Clara split 2 and 2.
Stanford coach Dutch Fehring
said that if the league ended in
a three-way tie there would be a
play-off. How and where it will be
held is very undecided at this
point.
17-Hit Barrage
In Friday's game at Santa
Clara, Bronco second baseman
Ray Henningson went 5 for 5 in
cluding two homers to lead a 17
hit attack which did the Indians
under.
Although the Indians had 11
hits they couldn't quite muster
enough hits at any one time and
as a result left 9 men on base.
Saturday, an error and a bad
bounce led to Stanford's 5-4 loss.
After a one out triple in the
fourth by Bronco pitcher Gary
Shara, a ground ball slid under
second baseman George Thach
er's glove to let the run score.
Bad Hop Single
In the next inning with one out,
a sure double play ball hit a rock
and kangarooerl over Thacher's

head. The runner who had been
on first advanced to third and
scored when the next batter flier!
out deep to lefi.
Bob Cox, Bill Boles, and Jim
Hibbs all hit triples for Stanford,
but they weren't enough to over
come the Broncos.
With one of the better defens
ive plays of the day, center fielder
Cox choked off a would be second
inning Santa Clara rally at two
runs when he made a running,
leaping catch of a hard line drive
which appeared 10 be headed for
deepest center field. There were
two men on base at the time.
The closeness of the CIBA race
is evidenced by the fact that Santa
Clara was last for a good part
of the season and still hasn't
been higher than third.
Stanford has been first for
most of the season. Cal slipped
into first the day prior to their
double loss to Stanford three
weekends ago.

out deep to lefi.
Bob Cox, Bill Boles, and Jim
Hibbs all hit triples for Stanford,
but they weren't enough to over
come the Broncos.
With one of the better defens
ive plays of the day, center fielder
Cox choked off a would be second
inning Santa Clara rally at two
runs when he made a running,
leaping catch of a hard line drive
which appeared 10 be headed for
deepest center field. There were
two men on base at the time.
The closeness of the CIBA race
is evidenced by the fact that Santa
Clara was last for a good part
of the season and still hasn't
been higher than third.
Stanford has been first for
most of the season. Cal slipped
into first the day prior to their
double loss to Stanford three
weekends ago.
These are make-up games and
Stanford and Cal can only sit by
and watch since their schedules
are completed. If Santa Clara
loses once they would be elimi
nated from the race with nine
losses. It would also hand Stan
ford the trip to the play-offs since
Stanford beat Cal 3 out of 4 times
this year.
Should Santa Clara emerge vic
torious from their road trip there
will be a complicated three way
tie for first. The difficulty is in
who should go into the play-offs.
Santa Clara has beat Stanford
3 out of four times, while Cal and
Santa Clara split 2 and 2.
Stanford coach Dutch Fehring
said that if the league ended in
a three-way tie there would be a
play-off. How and where it will be
held is very undecided at this
point.
