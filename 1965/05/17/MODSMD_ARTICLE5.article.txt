### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The race for the CIBA baseball
championship which has been
close all year is coming to a nail
biting conclusion this week.
Stanford missed its opportunity
I to take the crown last weekend
!by losing two games to Santa
Clara, 10-7 and,"5-4.
As it stands now Stanford and
j Cal are tied for first with identi
| cal 12-8 records. Santa Clara is in
j third with a 9-8 record. But if the
I Broncos can win their next three
games, there will be a three way
tie for first. The Broncos have a
game with USC Tuesday and a
t doubleheader with Santa Barbara
I Wednesday. All the games are
j away.
