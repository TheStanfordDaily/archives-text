I proposition barring the Legis- j
laturc from representing the stu- :
i dent body on off-campus issues'
: will be held today from 9-."> at!
three polling places.
Students will be asked to mark;
j two ballots, one containing the l
| proposition, the other containing
two alternative proposals which i
I LASSU has submitted as an opin
ion poll.
The polling places will be at the

field.

The proposition which was;
[placed on the ballot two weeks j
i ago by a petition containing over!
one thousand signatures, reads
"The government of the Associ-!
a tod Students of Stanford Univer-,
sity shall not take positions on •
matters other than those pertain
ing to student affairs on the Stan
ford campus."
The opinion poll consists of two ;
proposals which the Legislature)
| had originally submitted to the}
student body as propositions, an
| action that was vetoed by ASSU j
President Scott Mcßride on con
i stitutional grounds.
j The first alternative limits the
i Legislature to "only those olf
; campus issues which are of deep
: concern to the student body and
! within the knowledge and compe
tence of Legislature . . ." It furth
er requires a two-thirds roll call
vote and a second reading, and
provides that if ten per cent of
j the student body signs a petition
objecting to the Legislature's
'stand that the issue be submit

ted to a vote of the student body.
The second alternative gives the
Legislature the right to "express
its consensus on any issue which
is of deep concern to the student
body" without any limitations.
The first alternative is en
dorsed by ASSIJ President-elect
Sandy Mackenzie and LASSU
Speaker Ed Shaw. Mcßride has
not supported any of the three.
The issue was an area of con
troversy during the recent ASSU
election. Mackenzie's opponent,
Dave Robbins, opposed the Legis
lature taking off-campus stands,
and Mackenzie supported the
right of Legislature to represent
the opinions of the student body.
The controversy began when
the Legislature considered taking

a stand on possible discriminatory
hiring by a local restaurant chain.
However the resolution was
tabled when the business agreed
to negotiate with civil rights
groups.
According to the Constitution
tho Legislature had to place tho
proposition on the ballot within
25 days. Today is tho 25th since
the Legislature received the peti
tion.

i Balloting on the controversial I
I proposition barring the Legis- j
laturc from representing the stu- :
i dent body on off-campus issues'
: will be held today from 9-."> at!
three polling places.
Students will be asked to mark;
j two ballots, one containing the l
| proposition, the other containing
two alternative proposals which i
I LASSU has submitted as an opin
ion poll.
The polling places will be at the
i Post Office, Engineering Corner,
and between the Business and
the Law School and will be open
only today, according to acting i
Elections Chairman Glen Scho
field.

The proposition which was;
[placed on the ballot two weeks j
i ago by a petition containing over!
one thousand signatures, reads
"The government of the Associ-!
a tod Students of Stanford Univer-,
sity shall not take positions on •
matters other than those pertain
ing to student affairs on the Stan
ford campus."
The opinion poll consists of two ;
proposals which the Legislature)
| had originally submitted to the}
student body as propositions, an
| action that was vetoed by ASSU j
President Scott Mcßride on con
i stitutional grounds.
j The first alternative limits the
i Legislature to "only those olf
; campus issues which are of deep
: concern to the student body and
! within the knowledge and compe
tence of Legislature . . ." It furth
er requires a two-thirds roll call
vote and a second reading, and
provides that if ten per cent of
j the student body signs a petition
objecting to the Legislature's
'stand that the issue be submit

ted to a vote of the student body.
The second alternative gives the
Legislature the right to "express
its consensus on any issue which
is of deep concern to the student
body" without any limitations.
The first alternative is en
dorsed by ASSIJ President-elect
Sandy Mackenzie and LASSU
Speaker Ed Shaw. Mcßride has
not supported any of the three.
The issue was an area of con
troversy during the recent ASSU
election. Mackenzie's opponent,
Dave Robbins, opposed the Legis
lature taking off-campus stands,
and Mackenzie supported the
right of Legislature to represent
the opinions of the student body.
The controversy began when
the Legislature considered taking

a stand on possible discriminatory
hiring by a local restaurant chain.
However the resolution was
tabled when the business agreed
to negotiate with civil rights
groups.
According to the Constitution
tho Legislature had to place tho
proposition on the ballot within
25 days. Today is tho 25th since
the Legislature received the peti
tion.
