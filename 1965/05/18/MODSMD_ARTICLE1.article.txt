# Large Crowds Hear Pro-Con Viet Nam 'Teach-in'
## 
### JIM HAUSER, SUE MEYER SUE COWAN 
The Stanford "Teach-In," discussing the
pros and cons of United States policy in Viet
Nam, attracted overflow crowds to Tresidder
Memorial Union and Memorial Auditorium
yesterday afternoon and evening.
The Teach-in, according to Professor
Charles Drekmeier, an active organizer of the
Teach-In, "is the major opportunity we have
to get experts and newspapermen together to
talk to the community."
The purpose of the Teach-In, Drekmeier
said, "is to get as much expert opinion as pos
sible to the students and to the community.
This is the educational role of the University."
Stanford 'Teach-In' Different
The Stanford "Teach-In" differed from
others already held at some SO universities by
its attempt to present both sides of the Viet
Nam question.
"This is not a protest," Drekmeier said.
"This is an information panel."

Professor Gordon Craig, said it was about
time people found out that some academicians
supported the administration's position. Craig
said that as far as he knew this was the first
time that professors had come out in favor
of the administration.
Hans Morgenthau Speaks
In speeches yesterday evening in Memo
rial Auditorium, the principle speaker against
the United States policy was Hans Morgen
thau..
Morgenthau, professor at the University
of Chicago and advisor to the State Depart
ment who "has not been very active of late,"
criticized tlie United States for its policy of
"delusions and illusions."
Morgenthau did not deny the "obvious"
connection between Hanoi and the Viet Cong,
but. said the Viet Cong could operate inde
pendently, they are not merely an extension
of the Hanoi regime. Unfortunately, Morgen
thau said, those who try to point this out are
immediately branded as enemies.
The United States, Morgenthau said, pur

ports to be doing two things in Viet Nam;
stopping communism and honoring a solemn
commitment to the Vietnamese government.
Commitment to Ourselves
The latter reason, Morgenthau argued as
sumes the existence of two sovereign states,
one in the North and one in the South, and
this is no longer true. The Diem regime, Mor
genthau said, was the "creation of the United
States." "We have thus made a commitment
to ourselves."
In placing Diem on the throne, Morgen
thau said, we have had to "invent an entirely
new set of facts in order to be able to back
up our new policy."
Morgenthau, who received a standing ova
tion at the end of his speech, said there is
"not enough political substance" to form a
stable government in the South.
"We cannot win short of exterminating
the entire Vietnamese people," he concluded.
U.S. Defence
In the principal speech defending the
American position in Viet Nam, John Horner,

Director of tlie State Department Public Af
fairs Bui'eau, called ours a "policy of negotia
tion" which has been "clear and consistent"
and received the continuing support of Con
gress."
Horner briefly recounted the history of
Viet Nam since the second World War, and
then went on to the major reasons behind the
U.S. commitment.
The war in Viet Nam, he said, "is not a
civil war in any normal sense of the word."
Rather, it is directed politically and militarily
by the regime in Hanoi.
Horner cited 39,517 infiltrations from
North Viet Nam as proof of the North Vietna
mese involvement, in "this war of aggression
of a new type."
Ready to Negotiate
Horner said that the U.S. is ready to ne
gotiate, but will stand firm in defending the
right, of the South Vietnamese to determine
their own form of government.
Earlier in the evening, the Teach-in fea
tured a panel on "The Psychology of Aggres

sion and Face-Saving."
The first speaker was Dr. Lewis West from
the University of Oklahoma, a member of the
Air Force Reserve and an active fighter for
Civil Rights and the cessation of capital pun
ishment.
Our big problem in Vietnam, said Dr.
Lewis, has been our failure to export the
American Revolution. Americans do not guar
antee for others what we demanded for our
selves, although ours was part of the one
human revolution that is still continuing.
Dr. Erik Erikson of the Harvard Center for
Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences
stated that new studies of social animals re
vealed that man is more irrational than ani
mals: "Animals might do well to claim ex
emption from the human kingdom instead of
the other way around."
Dr. Erikson hoped that someday people
may learn to form more "inclusive identi
ties" than the "pseudo-species" to which they
are now attached, and he viewed Teach-ins
as a step in the right direction.

the University of Oklahoma, a member of the
Air Force Reserve and an active fighter for
Civil Rights and the cessation of capital pun
ishment.
Our big problem in Vietnam, said Dr.
Lewis, has been our failure to export the
American Revolution. Americans do not guar
antee for others what we demanded for our
selves, although ours was part of the one
human revolution that is still continuing.
Dr. Erik Erikson of the Harvard Center for
Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences
stated that new studies of social animals re
vealed that man is more irrational than ani
mals: "Animals might do well to claim ex
emption from the human kingdom instead of
the other way around."
Dr. Erikson hoped that someday people
may learn to form more "inclusive identi
ties" than the "pseudo-species" to which they
are now attached, and he viewed Teach-ins
as a step in the right direction.
The Stanford "Teach-In," discussing the
pros and cons of United States policy in Viet
Nam, attracted overflow crowds to Tresidder
Memorial Union and Memorial Auditorium
yesterday afternoon and evening.
The Teach-in, according to Professor
Charles Drekmeier, an active organizer of the
Teach-In, "is the major opportunity we have
to get experts and newspapermen together to
talk to the community."
The purpose of the Teach-In, Drekmeier
said, "is to get as much expert opinion as pos
sible to the students and to the community.
This is the educational role of the University."
Stanford 'Teach-In' Different
The Stanford "Teach-In" differed from
others already held at some SO universities by
its attempt to present both sides of the Viet
Nam question.
"This is not a protest," Drekmeier said.
"This is an information panel."

Professor Gordon Craig, said it was about
time people found out that some academicians
supported the administration's position. Craig
said that as far as he knew this was the first
time that professors had come out in favor
of the administration.
Hans Morgenthau Speaks
In speeches yesterday evening in Memo
rial Auditorium, the principle speaker against
the United States policy was Hans Morgen
thau..
Morgenthau, professor at the University
of Chicago and advisor to the State Depart
ment who "has not been very active of late,"
criticized tlie United States for its policy of
"delusions and illusions."
Morgenthau did not deny the "obvious"
connection between Hanoi and the Viet Cong,
but. said the Viet Cong could operate inde
pendently, they are not merely an extension
of the Hanoi regime. Unfortunately, Morgen
thau said, those who try to point this out are
immediately branded as enemies.
The United States, Morgenthau said, pur

ports to be doing two things in Viet Nam;
stopping communism and honoring a solemn
commitment to the Vietnamese government.
Commitment to Ourselves
The latter reason, Morgenthau argued as
sumes the existence of two sovereign states,
one in the North and one in the South, and
this is no longer true. The Diem regime, Mor
genthau said, was the "creation of the United
States." "We have thus made a commitment
to ourselves."
In placing Diem on the throne, Morgen
thau said, we have had to "invent an entirely
new set of facts in order to be able to back
up our new policy."
Morgenthau, who received a standing ova
tion at the end of his speech, said there is
"not enough political substance" to form a
stable government in the South.
"We cannot win short of exterminating
the entire Vietnamese people," he concluded.
U.S. Defence
In the principal speech defending the
American position in Viet Nam, John Horner,

Director of tlie State Department Public Af
fairs Bui'eau, called ours a "policy of negotia
tion" which has been "clear and consistent"
and received the continuing support of Con
gress."
Horner briefly recounted the history of
Viet Nam since the second World War, and
then went on to the major reasons behind the
U.S. commitment.
The war in Viet Nam, he said, "is not a
civil war in any normal sense of the word."
Rather, it is directed politically and militarily
by the regime in Hanoi.
Horner cited 39,517 infiltrations from
North Viet Nam as proof of the North Vietna
mese involvement, in "this war of aggression
of a new type."
Ready to Negotiate
Horner said that the U.S. is ready to ne
gotiate, but will stand firm in defending the
right, of the South Vietnamese to determine
their own form of government.
Earlier in the evening, the Teach-in fea
tured a panel on "The Psychology of Aggres

sion and Face-Saving."

Viet Nam since the second World War, and
then went on to the major reasons behind the
U.S. commitment.
The war in Viet Nam, he said, "is not a
civil war in any normal sense of the word."
Rather, it is directed politically and militarily
by the regime in Hanoi.
Horner cited 39,517 infiltrations from
North Viet Nam as proof of the North Vietna
mese involvement, in "this war of aggression
of a new type."
Ready to Negotiate
Horner said that the U.S. is ready to ne
gotiate, but will stand firm in defending the
right, of the South Vietnamese to determine
their own form of government.
Earlier in the evening, the Teach-in fea
tured a panel on "The Psychology of Aggres

sion and Face-Saving."
The first speaker was Dr. Lewis West from
the University of Oklahoma, a member of the
Air Force Reserve and an active fighter for
Civil Rights and the cessation of capital pun
ishment.
Our big problem in Vietnam, said Dr.
Lewis, has been our failure to export the
American Revolution. Americans do not guar
antee for others what we demanded for our
selves, although ours was part of the one
human revolution that is still continuing.
Dr. Erik Erikson of the Harvard Center for
Advanced Study of the Behavioral Sciences
stated that new studies of social animals re
vealed that man is more irrational than ani
mals: "Animals might do well to claim ex
emption from the human kingdom instead of
the other way around."
Dr. Erikson hoped that someday people
may learn to form more "inclusive identi
ties" than the "pseudo-species" to which they
are now attached, and he viewed Teach-ins
as a step in the right direction.
The Stanford "Teach-In," discussing the
pros and cons of United States policy in Viet
Nam, attracted overflow crowds to Tresidder
Memorial Union and Memorial Auditorium
yesterday afternoon and evening.
The Teach-in, according to Professor
Charles Drekmeier, an active organizer of the
Teach-In, "is the major opportunity we have
to get experts and newspapermen together to
talk to the community."
The purpose of the Teach-In, Drekmeier
said, "is to get as much expert opinion as pos
sible to the students and to the community.
This is the educational role of the University."
Stanford 'Teach-In' Different
The Stanford "Teach-In" differed from
others already held at some SO universities by
its attempt to present both sides of the Viet
Nam question.
"This is not a protest," Drekmeier said.
"This is an information panel."

Professor Gordon Craig, said it was about
time people found out that some academicians
supported the administration's position. Craig
said that as far as he knew this was the first
time that professors had come out in favor
of the administration.
Hans Morgenthau Speaks
In speeches yesterday evening in Memo
rial Auditorium, the principle speaker against
the United States policy was Hans Morgen
thau..
Morgenthau, professor at the University
of Chicago and advisor to the State Depart
ment who "has not been very active of late,"
criticized tlie United States for its policy of
"delusions and illusions."
Morgenthau did not deny the "obvious"
connection between Hanoi and the Viet Cong,
but. said the Viet Cong could operate inde
pendently, they are not merely an extension
of the Hanoi regime. Unfortunately, Morgen
thau said, those who try to point this out are
immediately branded as enemies.
The United States, Morgenthau said, pur

ports to be doing two things in Viet Nam;
stopping communism and honoring a solemn
commitment to the Vietnamese government.
Commitment to Ourselves
The latter reason, Morgenthau argued as
sumes the existence of two sovereign states,
one in the North and one in the South, and
this is no longer true. The Diem regime, Mor
genthau said, was the "creation of the United
States." "We have thus made a commitment
to ourselves."
In placing Diem on the throne, Morgen
thau said, we have had to "invent an entirely
new set of facts in order to be able to back
up our new policy."
Morgenthau, who received a standing ova
tion at the end of his speech, said there is
"not enough political substance" to form a
stable government in the South.
"We cannot win short of exterminating
the entire Vietnamese people," he concluded.
U.S. Defence
In the principal speech defending the
American position in Viet Nam, John Horner,

Director of tlie State Department Public Af
fairs Bui'eau, called ours a "policy of negotia
tion" which has been "clear and consistent"
and received the continuing support of Con
gress."
Horner briefly recounted the history of
Viet Nam since the second World War, and
then went on to the major reasons behind the
U.S. commitment.
