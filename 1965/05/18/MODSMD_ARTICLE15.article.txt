# Lacrosse Drops Big Game Cup To Cal Bears
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Discouragement meant defeat
| for the Stanford lacrosse team
I Saturday as it lost to the Uni
versity of California 5-2 in the
final game of a two-game series
with the Bears the final game
of the season for the Indians.
Stanford finished the season
with a 3-5 record.
Cal's goalie successfully defend
ed 25 Stanford shots. This not
only kept the Indians from scor
ing but caused considerable dis
couragement with the Indians.
Cal's goalie made many amaz
ing saves, blocking shots with
not only his stick but bouncing
shots off his chest and using his
arms and feet to stave off po
tential Stanford goals.
Just like a child who has been
continually caught by his mother
trying to steal cookies and finally
gives up trying, the Indians
seemed to lose their spirit in the
second half of the contest.
Hawkins Scores for Tribe
Bob Hawkins started the scor
ing for Stanford in the first half
on a bounce shot, but the Indians
were unable to forge the barrier
installed by the stick of Cal's
goalie. The Indians didn't score
j again until the last quarter on a
] high shot by Sandy Saxton.
Cal's scoring was evenly spread
I throughout the tilt, getting the
| quick initial score and then scor
; ing twice in the second period
and one each in the last two
j quarters.

i With this victory Cal obtained
! possession of the "Big Game" la
; crosse trophy which is presented
| annually to the winner of the
