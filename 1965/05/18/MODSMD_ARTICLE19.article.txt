## Indians Hope Gauchos, Trojans Open Doors 
### PETE EAKLAND 
The regular season chores are over for Stanford's baseball team, j
and the result of their labor is a slice of the CIBA pennant. How
big a slice depends upon the outcome of three rescheduled games
that Sauta Clara must play this week.
Currently, the Indians have a 12-8 record as does Cal. 11 Santa

Clara loses any one of its up-+
coming games, it will be elimi
nated from the race. Stanford will
then have one-half title to the
first place. More importantly ■
since it won the series between
the two schools, Stanford would
have the coveted NCAA berth.
On the other hand hand, if the j
Broncos will all three games, the ;
top spot will be a triumvirate. No
deciding factor will then be avail- j
able to choose the NCAA repre- j
senative, and a playoff will be nec-1
essary.
Indians Have Back Door
The Indians had their chance ,
last weekend to gain entrance
into the NCAA tourney outright
via the front door, but the Bron
cos,, backed into a corner, de
fended it admirably. The Cards i
are now looking for an open back
door. The passing through will
not be as glorious, but it will be !
just as effective.
Both the Trojans of USC and I
the Gouchos of UCSB, who play 1
Santa Clara this week, have an j
opportunity to escort the Indians '
to the NCAA berth. The Trojans'
position is a unique one. The Tro- i
jans, who call themselves "The!
Yankees of College Baseball," j
have won the CIBA pennant 14 of
the last 15 years. But. this year, '
they befell the fictional fate of j
the Yankees they have emulated.
The book title, The Year the
Yankees Lost the Pennant, in its;
new form would read, The Year
the Trojans Took (ias. One of the !
necessary ingredients is present. I
The Indians last year were dead
last in the CIBA. If one could!
only find a player who had sold '
his soul to the devil, the compari-1
son would be leakproof, but pub-!
licity releases rarely reveal such 1
data.
One Likely Candidate
One likely candidate would be
Bill Boles, who won several key
games with pinch hits. It turns I
out that Boles has sold his soul, |
but only to the Navy for four'
years after graduation. And j
Uncle Sam, despite devilish tend-!
encies, cares little about baseball.!
The trail ends, but perhaps this
is for the best. The Ilaily would
certainly lose advertising from
the Contemporary Christians if a i
soul-selling incident turned up.
For all the Indians good for-!
tune in the early and middle
phases of the season, the last two
games were bereft of any grace
from Lady Luck.

The first contest, held at a con- j
temptible place called appropri-j
ately Buck Pshaw Stadium, was a
nightmare for Stanford fans.
Tribe pitchers, like a Blackjack
player, taunted the Broncos with i
cries of "Hit Me!" But the dealer i
won each important deal. i.e. the j
Stanford pitchers were hit too
hard.
Bronco Hits
The Bronco swatters scattered
17 hits all over the park, five of
which were round-trippers. Four
Stanford pitchers tired their luck,
but none could find the right
formula.
But nobody wins in Pshaw, ex
cept the San Francisco Giants,
whom the Broncos play once a
year. Stanford patriots figured
the game the next day would
be different. And well it might
have except for a crucial error
and a ball that took a bad hop
over second-sacker George Thach
er's head.
Santa Clara, due to an explosive
hitting attack, of late, has won
3 games in a row and has mo
mentum. Pitching only adequate j
except for flashes of inspiration, i
mainly in the person of Rich
Robertson, Cal has come up with
two fine pitchers, Andy Messer
smith and Rich Nye, and also has
a winning stretch going. Credit Cal
with a bit of momentum.
Stanford, although it has lost two j
in a row, looks like the evenutal
representative no matter what
happens. Indian pitching is ;
strong, almost as strong as Cal's, ;
and hitting is strong, almost as
strong as Santa Clara's.
Through a combination of the
two factors, the Indians have
better overall strength and will
have to be the favorities if a
playoff becomes necessary.
But the Indian's medicine men
will be working overtime trying i
to prevent such a circumstance, j

Indians Have Back Door
The Indians had their chance ,
last weekend to gain entrance
into the NCAA tourney outright
via the front door, but the Bron
cos,, backed into a corner, de
fended it admirably. The Cards i
are now looking for an open back
door. The passing through will
not be as glorious, but it will be !
just as effective.
Both the Trojans of USC and I
the Gouchos of UCSB, who play 1
Santa Clara this week, have an j
opportunity to escort the Indians '
to the NCAA berth. The Trojans'
position is a unique one. The Tro- i
jans, who call themselves "The!
Yankees of College Baseball," j
have won the CIBA pennant 14 of
the last 15 years. But. this year, '
they befell the fictional fate of j
the Yankees they have emulated.
The book title, The Year the
Yankees Lost the Pennant, in its;
new form would read, The Year
the Trojans Took (ias. One of the !
necessary ingredients is present. I
The Indians last year were dead
last in the CIBA. If one could!
only find a player who had sold '
his soul to the devil, the compari-1
son would be leakproof, but pub-!
licity releases rarely reveal such 1
data.
One Likely Candidate
One likely candidate would be
Bill Boles, who won several key
games with pinch hits. It turns I
out that Boles has sold his soul, |
but only to the Navy for four'
years after graduation. And j
Uncle Sam, despite devilish tend-!
encies, cares little about baseball.!
The trail ends, but perhaps this
is for the best. The Ilaily would
certainly lose advertising from
the Contemporary Christians if a i
soul-selling incident turned up.
For all the Indians good for-!
tune in the early and middle
phases of the season, the last two
games were bereft of any grace
from Lady Luck.

The first contest, held at a con- j
temptible place called appropri-j
ately Buck Pshaw Stadium, was a
nightmare for Stanford fans.
Tribe pitchers, like a Blackjack
player, taunted the Broncos with i
cries of "Hit Me!" But the dealer i
won each important deal. i.e. the j
Stanford pitchers were hit too
hard.
Bronco Hits
The Bronco swatters scattered
17 hits all over the park, five of
which were round-trippers. Four
Stanford pitchers tired their luck,
but none could find the right
formula.
But nobody wins in Pshaw, ex
cept the San Francisco Giants,
whom the Broncos play once a
year. Stanford patriots figured
the game the next day would
be different. And well it might
have except for a crucial error
and a ball that took a bad hop
over second-sacker George Thach
er's head.
Santa Clara, due to an explosive
hitting attack, of late, has won
3 games in a row and has mo
mentum. Pitching only adequate j

17 hits all over the park, five of
which were round-trippers. Four
Stanford pitchers tired their luck,
but none could find the right
formula.
But nobody wins in Pshaw, ex
cept the San Francisco Giants,
whom the Broncos play once a
year. Stanford patriots figured
the game the next day would
be different. And well it might
have except for a crucial error
and a ball that took a bad hop
over second-sacker George Thach
er's head.
Santa Clara, due to an explosive
hitting attack, of late, has won
3 games in a row and has mo
mentum. Pitching only adequate j
except for flashes of inspiration, i
mainly in the person of Rich
Robertson, Cal has come up with
two fine pitchers, Andy Messer
smith and Rich Nye, and also has
a winning stretch going. Credit Cal
with a bit of momentum.
Stanford, although it has lost two j
in a row, looks like the evenutal
representative no matter what
happens. Indian pitching is ;
strong, almost as strong as Cal's, ;
and hitting is strong, almost as
strong as Santa Clara's.
Through a combination of the
two factors, the Indians have
better overall strength and will
have to be the favorities if a
playoff becomes necessary.
But the Indian's medicine men
will be working overtime trying i
to prevent such a circumstance, j
The regular season chores are over for Stanford's baseball team, j
and the result of their labor is a slice of the CIBA pennant. How
big a slice depends upon the outcome of three rescheduled games
that Sauta Clara must play this week.
Currently, the Indians have a 12-8 record as does Cal. 11 Santa

Clara loses any one of its up-+
coming games, it will be elimi
nated from the race. Stanford will
then have one-half title to the
first place. More importantly ■
since it won the series between
the two schools, Stanford would
have the coveted NCAA berth.
On the other hand hand, if the j
Broncos will all three games, the ;
top spot will be a triumvirate. No
deciding factor will then be avail- j
able to choose the NCAA repre- j
senative, and a playoff will be nec-1
essary.
Indians Have Back Door
The Indians had their chance ,
last weekend to gain entrance
into the NCAA tourney outright
via the front door, but the Bron
cos,, backed into a corner, de
fended it admirably. The Cards i
are now looking for an open back
door. The passing through will
not be as glorious, but it will be !
just as effective.
Both the Trojans of USC and I
the Gouchos of UCSB, who play 1
Santa Clara this week, have an j
opportunity to escort the Indians '
to the NCAA berth. The Trojans'
position is a unique one. The Tro- i
jans, who call themselves "The!
Yankees of College Baseball," j
have won the CIBA pennant 14 of
the last 15 years. But. this year, '
they befell the fictional fate of j
the Yankees they have emulated.
The book title, The Year the
Yankees Lost the Pennant, in its;
new form would read, The Year
the Trojans Took (ias. One of the !
necessary ingredients is present. I
The Indians last year were dead
last in the CIBA. If one could!
only find a player who had sold '
his soul to the devil, the compari-1
son would be leakproof, but pub-!
licity releases rarely reveal such 1
data.
One Likely Candidate
One likely candidate would be
Bill Boles, who won several key
games with pinch hits. It turns I
out that Boles has sold his soul, |
but only to the Navy for four'
years after graduation. And j
Uncle Sam, despite devilish tend-!
encies, cares little about baseball.!
The trail ends, but perhaps this
is for the best. The Ilaily would
certainly lose advertising from
the Contemporary Christians if a i
soul-selling incident turned up.
For all the Indians good for-!
tune in the early and middle
phases of the season, the last two
games were bereft of any grace
from Lady Luck.

The first contest, held at a con- j
temptible place called appropri-j
ately Buck Pshaw Stadium, was a
nightmare for Stanford fans.
Tribe pitchers, like a Blackjack
player, taunted the Broncos with i
cries of "Hit Me!" But the dealer i
won each important deal. i.e. the j
Stanford pitchers were hit too
hard.
