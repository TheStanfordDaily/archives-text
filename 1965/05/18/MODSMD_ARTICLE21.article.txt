'When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said, 'in a
rather scornful tone, it means just what I choose
it to mean —neither more nor less.'
'The question is,' said Alice, 'whether you can
make words mean so many different tilings.'
•The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, 'which
is to In* master —that's all."

Alice's Adventurees in Wonderland
On the night of April 30, just three days before
the final ASSU presidential elections, the house of
ficers of one Stanford fraternity met for dinner at
the home of Alumni Association Director Bob
Pierce to discuss choosing an RA for next year.
Also present at the gathering were Dean of Men
Robert Gordon and professor of political science
James T. Watkins IV.
During the course of the initial conversation,
one student who was present reported, Dean Gor
don repeated a story that he had heard to the
effect that ASSU presidential candidate Sandy
Mackenzie planned, if elected, to misappropriate
$15,000 of ASSU money to hire a professional ad
ministrator to act as a coordinator for student
affairs.
Gordon apparently did not question the veracity
of the story, the student reported, and condemned
Mackenzie's supposed plan as a repudiation of
faith in students. (Later, when questioned by a stu
dent about his knowledge of the report, Gordon
said that he had heard the rumor but was not
spreading it.)
At this point, professor Watkins came in and
"corrected" Gordon's version of the story. He said
that the salary figure was $20,000, not $15,000. He,
too, apparently believed the report and roundly
condemned the idea.
Watkins continued further to castigate Macken
zie and to support the candidacy of Dave Robbins.
"He was just irrational and emotional about how
Robbins had to win," a student present reported.
"He seemed to think that Mackenzie was involved
in some sort of plot . . . He kept saying over and
over again that Robbins must be elected."
This was not the first nor the last time that
Professor Watkins charged pell-mell into the po
litical arena on candidate Robbins' behalf.
(During the primary both Robbins and Mac
kenzie spoke at an IFC meeting. After the candi
dates had left, Watkins said that he didn't know
where support for fraternities now lay because the
administration was on the run and the faculty
was anti-fraternity. He continued that two of the
candidates were questionable and one was in full
support of the system—that despite what Macken
zie had said, there was no guarantee he would not
work against the fraternities and as such fratern
ity men had certain obligations to uphold.)
Nor was it the first, nor, unhappily, the last
time that the "Mackenzie rumor" (a rumor totally
false in its every word) was given currency.
Both during and after the campaign, Watkins
acknowledged, with what one can only term in

credible audacity, his partisanship toward Robbins
and the means with which he had sought to in
sure Robbin's election (chiefly rumor-mongering).
In the last days of the campaign, at a time when
the "Mackenzie rumors" (which included a totally
false rendition of how Maekenizie had been "im
peached" from several offices during his Stanford
career) were wide-spread, on the fraternity row
in particular, Mackenzie's Vice Presidential run
ning-mate, Clark Brown, went to see Professor
Wat kins.
When questioned about, his visit later by The
Daily, Brown said that he had told Watkins that
there was absolutely no truth in the report that
Mackenzie was planning to hire a "professional
coordinator." He said that Watkins replied by toll
ing him that he had heard the report from ' a high
source."
The rumor continued to be spread.
After the campaign and his election, Mackenzie
went to see Watkins himself (on Monday, May 10).
When asked about his conversation by the Daily,
Mackenzie said that Watkins readily admitted hav
ing spread the report to several other people, and
said that "it made good sense to him." He said
he had first heard the Mackenzie rumor from"the
highest administrative authority," but hastened to
add that lie did not mean President Sterling.
The account of Professor Watkins' politicking
ends here—this year at least.
But before one dismisses the incident as so
much spilt milk and not worthy of further at
tention (as one has been wont to do with too
many other incidents for too many years), a few
editorial comments seem in order.
The "Mackenzie rumor," which the Robbins
camp did so much to foster, is false in fact and
detrimental in effect. To the degree that his active
advocacy of the story gave it some measure of
"respectability," surely Professor Watkins is
guilty of no small ethical lapse.
Apparently, at no time did Professor Watkins
ever attempt to check the accuracy of the story
with Mackenzie. His referral of the rumor to a
mysterious "high source," is at once inadequate and
curious. Surely, if Watkins believed the story, as
lie said he did. ho should have been most willing to
disclose his reasons for so doing, including the
original source of his information.
Moreover, after he had been told by Clark Brown
that the story had no basis in fact, Watkins ap
parently made no effort to correct the misimpres
sion he had formerly helped to create.
(In fairness, it should be added that Professor
Watkins does teach a colloquium in Mystics and
Mysticism and thus may be possessed of means of
communication that are beyond the rest of us.)
We believe, and have always believed, that in an
ideal university community faculty and students
will work together as scholars to solve their com
mon problems.
But Professor Watkins' "contribution" was not
of this order. It was divisive rather than construc
tive—mean and petty in its intent and effect, and
ultimately degrading (in its misuse of authority)
to the academic profession.
This is not the first time that Professor Watkins
has played fast and loose with the truth —making
words mean what he wants them to.
We sincerely hope, however, that it will be the
last.
