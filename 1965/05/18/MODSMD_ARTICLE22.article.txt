## Senator Dodd Attacked On Charge of 'Paranoid' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Few persons should know Sen
ator Dodd's motives bettor than
Dr. Possony; why, then, should
the doctor blink when "paranoil"
is applied to Dodd?
The senator, once Connecticut
chairman of the United World
Federalists, has swung to skep
ticism of survival except by
"shooting through." Economy-sen
sitive on small change, he never
shudders at billions for war.
When the overfed Pentagon
whimpers about its stai-vation,
Dodd springs to man the appro
priations steam-roller. This is not
just a new role. A decade ago ho
got the House to raise the muni
tions tab for a Guatemalan dic
tatorship from five to ten and
finally to fifteen million. The next
year, 1957, that government paid
his $24,999.96 as its "legal coun
sel." The following year it paid
him $41,666.62. Just a little regis
tered lobbying between terms in
Congress.
As chairman of the Senate In
ternal Security subcommittee,
Dodd gave all comfort to Michel
Struelens, front man for Union
Miniere domination of Katanga,
and undercut the work of Ed
mond Gullion, American ambas
sador to the Congo. The mining
company made $47 million profit
in 1960 while the Congo went to
pieces.
In the Foreign Relations com
mittee, Dodd kept the brakes on
nuclear test-ban policies of the
Eisenhower administration. He
opposed the Antarctic Treaty, but
commended neo-Nazis on their
Sudeten German Day.
In my view the word was well
chosen.

Editor, The Daily:
We would like to express regret
that our telegram to the Presi
dent of the United States concern
ing policy in Viet Nam was
printed inaccurately in yester
day's Daily. As dispatched to the
President and released to the
press, the telegram expressed the
view that QUOTE We all beileve
that a U.S. withdrawal before we
have achieved a viable agreement
guaranteeing the freedom of the
people of south Viet Nam would
encourage the aggressiveness of
the most militant branch of Com
munism throughout the world.

• Viet Double Standard
Editor, Tlie Daily:
Saturday morning an elderly lady
from Palo Alto approached me in
front of Cubberley Auditorium
handing out dittoed sheets' which
urged that we write our Senator
asking him to vote against Presi
dent Johnson's military appropria
tions for Vict: Nam. I took one of
these sheets and then asked her if
she was going to do anything
about Red China's second Atom
bomb test. She was not going to
ditto out sheets urging that we
write to Ambassador Stevenson to
get him to protest Rod China's ac
tion.
While I find the wars in Viet
Nam and the Dominican Republic
repugnant, I also find the incon
sistency of "Peace Marchers" to
bo repugnant. The American em
bassy in Siagon was bombed and
innocent Vietnamese, who were so
unlucky as to be in the area, were
killed; but there was no protest.
Bridges are bombed in North Viet
Nam and there is a rally in White
Plaza. Communist infiltrated
anarchy reigns in Santo Domingo
as people are hauled out and "ex
cuted" in the streets. Not a word
from the righteous. American

Marines land and another rally
takes place. Why was there no sit
in at the Russian embassy when
Missionary Carlson was killed by
"Simbas" using Russian weapons,
when there was a protest when
American planes flew in troops to
rescue those held captive in the
Congo.
If you plan on "Teaching-in"
this evening, then at least have
the intellectual honesty to put
the blame for senseless killing on
the shoulders of both sides. If it is
wrong for us to kill, then it is
wrong for them to kill and they
also should be condemned pub
licly.

apathy, red tape, and lack of co

the dearth of popular entertain- !

Yesterday's telegram to Presi-;

it enlisted faculty support for;
something, is regrettable because j
it clouded and confused the is-1

let us debate the real issues, not I

The telegram's studied ambig
uity was an attempt to mislead

For criticism has not centered on
the administration policy as pro
claimed in Baltimore, but rather
on the actual policy as it has been
carried out in Viet Nam. The

The discrepancy between the

To affirm the administration's

• Viet Double Standard
Editor, Tlie Daily:
Saturday morning an elderly lady
from Palo Alto approached me in
front of Cubberley Auditorium
handing out dittoed sheets' which
urged that we write our Senator
asking him to vote against Presi
dent Johnson's military appropria
tions for Vict: Nam. I took one of
these sheets and then asked her if
she was going to do anything
about Red China's second Atom
bomb test. She was not going to
ditto out sheets urging that we
write to Ambassador Stevenson to
get him to protest Rod China's ac
tion.
While I find the wars in Viet
Nam and the Dominican Republic
repugnant, I also find the incon
sistency of "Peace Marchers" to
bo repugnant. The American em
bassy in Siagon was bombed and
innocent Vietnamese, who were so
unlucky as to be in the area, were
killed; but there was no protest.
Bridges are bombed in North Viet
Nam and there is a rally in White
Plaza. Communist infiltrated
anarchy reigns in Santo Domingo
as people are hauled out and "ex
cuted" in the streets. Not a word
from the righteous. American

Marines land and another rally
takes place. Why was there no sit
in at the Russian embassy when
Missionary Carlson was killed by
"Simbas" using Russian weapons,
when there was a protest when
American planes flew in troops to
rescue those held captive in the
Congo.
If you plan on "Teaching-in"

the intellectual honesty to put
the blame for senseless killing on
the shoulders of both sides. If it is
wrong for us to kill, then it is
wrong for them to kill and they

• Viet Double Standard
Editor, Tlie Daily:
Saturday morning an elderly lady
from Palo Alto approached me in
front of Cubberley Auditorium
handing out dittoed sheets' which
urged that we write our Senator
asking him to vote against Presi
dent Johnson's military appropria
tions for Vict: Nam. I took one of
these sheets and then asked her if
she was going to do anything
about Red China's second Atom
bomb test. She was not going to
ditto out sheets urging that we
write to Ambassador Stevenson to
get him to protest Rod China's ac
tion.
While I find the wars in Viet
Nam and the Dominican Republic
repugnant, I also find the incon
sistency of "Peace Marchers" to
bo repugnant. The American em
bassy in Siagon was bombed and
innocent Vietnamese, who were so
unlucky as to be in the area, were
killed; but there was no protest.
Bridges are bombed in North Viet
Nam and there is a rally in White
Plaza. Communist infiltrated
anarchy reigns in Santo Domingo
as people are hauled out and "ex
cuted" in the streets. Not a word
from the righteous. American

Marines land and another rally
takes place. Why was there no sit
in at the Russian embassy when
Missionary Carlson was killed by
"Simbas" using Russian weapons,
when there was a protest when
American planes flew in troops to
rescue those held captive in the
Congo.
If you plan on "Teaching-in"
this evening, then at least have
the intellectual honesty to put
the blame for senseless killing on
the shoulders of both sides. If it is
wrong for us to kill, then it is
wrong for them to kill and they
also should be condemned pub

year, 1957, that government paid
his $24,999.96 as its "legal coun

him $41,666.62. Just a little regis

Congress.
As chairman of the Senate In
