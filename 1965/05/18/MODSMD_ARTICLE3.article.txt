# Negro Fights For Legal Recognition

"The one thing we really learned at Atlantic City," Sweeney said,
"is that politics isn't all it's cracked up to bo."
"Atlantic City was the first time in ihese people's lives (the Mis
sissippi Negroes) that they confronted the white power structure,
and it had a tremendously disillusioning effect on them," Sweeney
said. "They came there asking for nothing more than the very basic
thing that they needed the recognition that they were legal. And
they were told that they weren't."
"And then during the congressional challenge," he continued.
"And again they said we weren't, legal. But what does that word
legal mean? If our (the MFDP) elections .. ren't legal, then are
theirs (the "regular" Mississippi elections)?"
"The ultimate exaggeration of this problem," Sweeney added, "is
in Nashoba County where the shriff who is accused of murder
is still 'legally' in charge of summoning the jury that's going to try
him."
Defining Problem
"But people don't want to talk about those kind of questions," ho
observed. "For example, the way the press deals with the Klan,
like the Saturday Evening Post saying that Klan members are the
kooks and crooks in the community . . . Well, that just isn't, true;
some of the most influential people are members of the Klan. But
by calling them crooks and kooks you can define them out of the
society so you don't have to deal with the real problem, so you
don't have to look at yourself. The North defines the South out of
the national society in the same way."
Sweeney continually emphasized the importance of recognizing
that the Movement must find ways of dealing with the psychological
as well as the legal barriers to freedom. This attitude underlies
SNCC's often articulated position that it doesn't want to "integrate"
the Negro into white middle class society.
"The Movement has many faces and operates on many different
fronts," lie said. "And there has to be room for people who want
to be integrated. But there has to be room, too, for those who don't
want to be integrated into a society that they don't respect ... I
don't think that's racism, but rather, just an understanding of how
deep the problem goes and an effort to meet it in a constructive
way."
