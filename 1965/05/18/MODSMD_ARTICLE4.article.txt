# Election Approves Proposition; Off-Campus Stands Prohibited
## 
### JUSTIN BECK Executive Editor 
Off-campus issues are now out
of bounds for the Legislature,
jas the proposition barring stu
i dent government from taking
i stands on such issues passed by a
96 vote margin in a heavy turn
i out yesterday.
j Both alternatives to the strict
ban, presented to the voters as
i a Legislative opinion poll, failed,
alternative A by a razor slim 15
j votes.
The turnout for the one day
i election was 179cS, so heavy that
; acting election chairman Glenn
1 Schofiekl was forced to print
j four hundred additional ballots in
j the late afternoon.
The total vote on the proposi
: tion, which now becomes a by-law
j amending article 11, was 947 to
! 851 against.
Alternatives Defeated
i Alternative A which would
j have permitted the Legislature to
j take stands on issues of "deep
j concern" to the student body,
! on subjects which were within the
j "knowledge and competence of
i the Legislature" was turned down
! 867-Bri2.
The second alternative, which
would have permitted the Legis
lature to speak without any limi
! tation was overwhelmingly re
jected 1186-505, more than two
• thirds.

The initiative proposition car
ried 52.7 per cent of the vote. A 1
ternative A, which was supported
by ASSU President-elect Sandy
Mackinzie and LASSU Speaker Ed
Shaw, received 49.6 per cent.
John Bonine, Young Republi
can county treasurer and one of
the original supporters of the pe
tition, said Ihe vote showed that
"the 'activist' or liberal element
which controls the student gov
ernment is obviously not in step
with the student body on some
important issues.
"The overwhelming defeat of
'alternative B\ which would have
place no restrictions at all on
I LASSU, most emphatically ex
presses this feeling."
• The proposition reads. "The
'.government of the Associated
J Students of Stanford University
I shall not lake positions on mat-
It ers other than those pertaining
ito student affairs on the Stan
| ford campus."
McßrkUi Commeuts
Scott Mcßride, ASSU President,
commented, "I was extremely
j pleased to see the large voter
| turnout after three previous elec
j tions this quarter. This large vote
j—a near record for a one day elec
i tion—demonstrates the interest of
! the student body in this vital is
| sue.
"A final decision on this ques
: tion by a direct vote of the stu
-1 dents was long overdue. The elec
torate has clearly prescribed the
| guidelines that the government
'of the Associated Students is to
follow. I intend to remain within
these guidelines and I am con
j fident that the Legislature will
| proceed in a similar manner."

The off-campus issue had been
hotly debated in the ASSU Presi
dential election held earlier this
spring. Mackenzie had favored
the Legislature speaking out on
issues of concern to the student
body, and his opponent, Dave Rob
bins, o]) posed it.
The issue came up when the
Legisuature considered a resolu
tion condemning a local restau
rant chain for alledgedly descrim
inatory hiring practices. The reso
lution was tabled after the chain
entered into negotiations with
civil rights groups.
Jim Greenley, El Toro LASSU
representative, began the drive to
get the proposition on the ballot.
In one and a half days the peti
tion gathered_ 1137 signatures.
Greenley sairl of the election:
"I trust LASSU will keep this
moderate sentiment in mind dur
ing future action. Instead of re
signing itself to inaction I expect
it to act positively on on-campus
issues such as liquor policy."
Mcßride's Veto
The Legislature attempted to
put two other propositions on the
ballot with the petition but that
action was vetoed last week by
Mcßride on constitutional
grounds. LASSU then submitted
the other two proposals as an
"opinion poll."
The first, alternative A, was
proposed by LASSU Rep. Maury
j Stearns. It required that if ten
per cent of the student body
I signed a petition objecting to a
i stand of the Legislature, the issue
; would be put up before the stu
; dent body in an election. It has
j been used at Oberlin and the Uni
versity of Chicago.

Mcßride's Veto
The Legislature attempted to
put two other propositions on the
ballot with the petition but that
action was vetoed last week by
Mcßride on constitutional
grounds. LASSU then submitted
the other two proposals as an
"opinion poll."
The first, alternative A, was
proposed by LASSU Rep. Maury
j Stearns. It required that if ten
per cent of the student body
I signed a petition objecting to a
i stand of the Legislature, the issue
; would be put up before the stu
; dent body in an election. It has
j been used at Oberlin and the Uni
versity of Chicago.

j fident that the Legislature will

The off-campus issue had been
hotly debated in the ASSU Presi
dential election held earlier this
spring. Mackenzie had favored
the Legislature speaking out on
issues of concern to the student
body, and his opponent, Dave Rob
bins, o]) posed it.
The issue came up when the
Legisuature considered a resolu
tion condemning a local restau
rant chain for alledgedly descrim
inatory hiring practices. The reso
lution was tabled after the chain
entered into negotiations with
civil rights groups.
Jim Greenley, El Toro LASSU
representative, began the drive to
get the proposition on the ballot.
In one and a half days the peti
tion gathered_ 1137 signatures.
Greenley sairl of the election:
"I trust LASSU will keep this
moderate sentiment in mind dur
ing future action. Instead of re
signing itself to inaction I expect
it to act positively on on-campus
issues such as liquor policy."
Mcßride's Veto
The Legislature attempted to
put two other propositions on the
ballot with the petition but that
action was vetoed last week by
Mcßride on constitutional
grounds. LASSU then submitted
the other two proposals as an
"opinion poll."
The first, alternative A, was
proposed by LASSU Rep. Maury
j Stearns. It required that if ten
per cent of the student body
I signed a petition objecting to a
i stand of the Legislature, the issue
; would be put up before the stu
; dent body in an election. It has
j been used at Oberlin and the Uni
versity of Chicago.

Off-campus issues are now out
of bounds for the Legislature,
jas the proposition barring stu
i dent government from taking
i stands on such issues passed by a
96 vote margin in a heavy turn
i out yesterday.
j Both alternatives to the strict
ban, presented to the voters as
i a Legislative opinion poll, failed,
alternative A by a razor slim 15
j votes.
The turnout for the one day
i election was 179cS, so heavy that
; acting election chairman Glenn
1 Schofiekl was forced to print
j four hundred additional ballots in
j the late afternoon.
The total vote on the proposi
: tion, which now becomes a by-law
j amending article 11, was 947 to
! 851 against.
Alternatives Defeated
i Alternative A which would
j have permitted the Legislature to
j take stands on issues of "deep
j concern" to the student body,
! on subjects which were within the
j "knowledge and competence of
i the Legislature" was turned down
! 867-Bri2.
The second alternative, which
would have permitted the Legis
lature to speak without any limi
! tation was overwhelmingly re
jected 1186-505, more than two
• thirds.

The initiative proposition car
ried 52.7 per cent of the vote. A 1
ternative A, which was supported
by ASSU President-elect Sandy
Mackinzie and LASSU Speaker Ed
Shaw, received 49.6 per cent.
John Bonine, Young Republi
can county treasurer and one of
the original supporters of the pe
tition, said Ihe vote showed that
"the 'activist' or liberal element
which controls the student gov
ernment is obviously not in step
with the student body on some
important issues.
"The overwhelming defeat of
'alternative B\ which would have
place no restrictions at all on
I LASSU, most emphatically ex
presses this feeling."
• The proposition reads. "The
'.government of the Associated
J Students of Stanford University
I shall not lake positions on mat-
It ers other than those pertaining
ito student affairs on the Stan
| ford campus."
McßrkUi Commeuts
Scott Mcßride, ASSU President,
commented, "I was extremely
j pleased to see the large voter
| turnout after three previous elec
j tions this quarter. This large vote
j—a near record for a one day elec
i tion—demonstrates the interest of
! the student body in this vital is
| sue.
"A final decision on this ques
: tion by a direct vote of the stu
-1 dents was long overdue. The elec
torate has clearly prescribed the
| guidelines that the government
'of the Associated Students is to
follow. I intend to remain within
these guidelines and I am con
j fident that the Legislature will
| proceed in a similar manner."
