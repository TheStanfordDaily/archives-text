# Carnegie Fellowships To Develop Art Program
## 
### 
Stanford plans to develop a co
herent program in art history
and in studio work which will give
to students specializing in history
a sense of the place of art in con
temporary society, and studio
workers an acquiantance with the
traditions of art.
The pr o g r a m announcement
came in conjunction wilh a Gar
neige Corporation of New York
grant of $150,000 to strengthen
the art program, primarily at
the graduate level.
The grant will be used for grad
uate fellowships in both art his
tory and in the practice of art;
and for travels and funds in aid
of research and creative work by
students and faculty.
The intention is that this train
ing will be something more seri
ously professional than that
which can he provided in more
heavily populated art depart
ments.
Kast Dominates Competition
Dr. Eitner pointed out that
most graduate programs in art
history are now found in the
eastern United States. "A very
few schools," he says, "located be
tween Boston and Philadelphia,
now turn out nearly 85 per cent
of the highly trained professional
art historians, for whose services
uiversities and museums
throughout the country must
compete.
"Most of these art historians,"
ho claims, "prefer to remain in
the region where they were train
ed, leaving institutions through
out the country understaffed. The
consequence of the shortage of
trained art historians, aggravated
by their tight concentration in a
small area of this country, has
been the 'provincialization' of the
art departments, museums, and
other institutions in the arts
throughout the country at large.
Only the development of vigorous
regional centers of scholarship
and teaching in the history of
are will remedy this situation."
Definite Areas of Study
Stanford's program in art his
tory will not compete in the com
prehensive spread of its offering
(with the much larged depart
ments in the East, but will con
centrate on well-defined areas of
specialization, in particular on

European art of 1750 to 1950, and
on Oriental art.
It is not intended to increase
the enrollment beyond 15 grad
uate students. It is the expecta
tion that the Art Department
will soon reach the point at which
it will award an average of three
Ph.D.'s in Art History each year.
Dr. Eitner concluded, "If we
can give three good art historians
to the profession every year, then
our contribution will be a con
siderable one within the total na
tional picture.
