## Clarification on Report 
### 
Editor, Tin* Daily:
J would like to clarify several
minor inaccuracies in yesterday's
editorial report, part of which
discussed a meeting of "one Stan
ford fraternity."
The meeting took place on
April 28. The purpose of the
meeting was to allow the house
executive committee a chance to
meet informally with an advisory
hoard of faculty and administra
tors to discuss house activities.
The HA candidates were to be
interviewed only incidentally. The
remarks alluded to in yesterday's
Daily were not part of the meet
ing. They occui*ed in conversation
before dinner.
Bob Pierce, Director of the
Alumni Association, was not in
volved in the pre-dinner conver
sation. Mr. Pierce has always
been diligent in maintaining his
neutrality in student affairs. He
had graciously volunteered hi s
home and hospitality and his
presence reflected only his inter
est in the fraternity.
On all other accounts, the re
port in The Daily yesterday was
faithful to the substance of the
remarks made by Dean Gordon
and Professor Wat kins on that
occasion.
I .KI TII ANDERSON
Editor's note: Yesterday's Edi
torial Report made reference to
Director of the Alumni Associa
tion Bob Pierce only to establish
the location of the fraternity
meeting in question. The Daily
in no way intended to imply that
Mr. Pierce had any part in the
discussion of student politics.
• Onesided Report
Editor, The Daily:
I have been a strong admirer
of the Steffen era at The Daily,
and am therefore doubly dis
turbed at the apparent onesided
ness of ihe editorial report in yes
terday's edition dealing with Pro
fessor Watkins. 112 know nothing
about the events of which the
editorial speaks, and am not now |
entering into the merits of th e j
case. But 1 musl record my im- 1
pression that while the students
involved were permitted to give
their views directly, no compar
able effort was marie to let Pro
fessor Watkins give his side of
the story directly. On four occa
sions the word "apparently" is
used to describe comments and
reactions of Dean Gordon and
Professor Watkins, and there is
no indication that an attempt was
made to discover whether these I
"apparent" conclusions were cor-i
reel or not.
I suggest that not only journa-i
listic honesty, but simple journa
listic courtesy, require that Pro
fessor Watkins be given an equal
ly direct hearing, rather than be-1
ing interpreted only at second or 1
third hand. Since you did not do
this in yesterday's article, I hope
you will redress the imbalance
in an early issue, so that those
of us who have admired your:
fort brightness and fairness on \
other issues will have that faith i
fully restored in relation to this ■
one.

Professor of Religion
EDITOR'S NOTE: The Daily,
too, regrets that we did not in
clude a direct statement from
Professor Watkins in yester-

day's report, in an effort to cor
rect the error, we contacted
Professor Watkins today by
phone, but he declined to com
ment. (See page 1 ).
• Clarification Asked
Editor, The Daily:
I am grateful, as is, no doubt,
j Professor Watkins that the ru
' mors he has been spreading in
I his classroom and through hi s
| position as faculty advisor to fra
ternities, have at last been held
j up to the light of day for the en
: tire campus to view. I have been
troubled that in the past weeks
innocent students have been dis
persing these rumors with knowl
edge neither of their source nor
authenticity. Perhaps now that
The Daily has opened the issue
to consideration by the entire
public, ihe university community
can judge for itself the content,
of the rumors and the motives of
their creator. In any event, there
are many of us who eagerly
await Dr. Watkins' clarification.
DAVE HARRIS
• Vicious Attack
Editor, The Daily:
Your vicious attack on Dr. Wat
kins displays more innuendo and
name-calling than proof or logic.
When added to such articles as
Justin Beck's "Rumours and
Rumblings" it displays an edi
torial policy for this volume of
Th." Daily that is less than jour
nalistically responsible.
You might better devote your
limited non-advertising space to
reporting of significant news de
velopments. You have made no
mention of the knifing of Stan
ford Sigma Chi's at their party
Saturday night. Your reportage
of Viet Nam was incredibly thin
for an event which drew larger
student audiences than any cam
pus event in the last four years.
May I humbly suggest that you
spend some time contemplating
the words of Mr. Storke, em
bossed in brass on one of the
columns of The Daily's new
home?

• I( !< ] irregularities
Editor, The Daily:
If there were difficulties with!
the ASSU elections Monday, they!
were minor compared to the!
gross mishandling of the Inter!
Club Council presidential elec
tions held on the same day.
The problem centered around
the listing of one candidate's!
name on the ballot. Jon Kooiker I
who has been running an active;
e a m p a i g n under the name ]
"Earth," was told last week that
he would have to be listed by his :
legal name on the ballot. Mon-J
day, at the polls, it was clear
that many voters did not know!
who Jon C. Kooiker was. That
night the ICC proceeded to count [
the ballots and then decided that j
they would void the elections.
There are several points about '
the affair which are irregular:
1. Since Kooiker was informed
last Monday that he would not
be listed as "Earth," he had more
than enough time to inform the
voters of his real name. Identifi

cation of the candidate is always j
j part of the political process.
2. Electioneering at the single !
i polling place was quite flagrant.
3. The ICC Vice President
! and person responsible for con
j ducting the elections was very
j uncertain about the proper pro
i cedures and did not consult the
ASSU Elections Commission.
4. The ICC should have re
solved the whole business last
I week; at that point it was simply
a question of whether or not
I pseudonyms were to be per
! mitted.
The ICC's action is particular
ly unfortunate because it comes
: at a time when there is a ques
i tion as to whether certain clubs
I will open next year. It has less
ened confidence in a body which
I has seldom demonstrated any
j leadership capability. Hopefully
l the new elections Wednesday will
; be conducted in a strict and open
! manner.

• Vicious Attack
Editor, The Daily:
Your vicious attack on Dr. Wat
kins displays more innuendo and
name-calling than proof or logic.
When added to such articles as
Justin Beck's "Rumours and
Rumblings" it displays an edi
torial policy for this volume of
Th." Daily that is less than jour
nalistically responsible.
You might better devote your
limited non-advertising space to
reporting of significant news de
velopments. You have made no
mention of the knifing of Stan
ford Sigma Chi's at their party
Saturday night. Your reportage
of Viet Nam was incredibly thin
for an event which drew larger
student audiences than any cam
pus event in the last four years.
May I humbly suggest that you
spend some time contemplating
the words of Mr. Storke, em
bossed in brass on one of the
columns of The Daily's new
home?

Editor, The Daily:
If there were difficulties with!
the ASSU elections Monday, they!
were minor compared to the!
gross mishandling of the Inter!
Club Council presidential elec
tions held on the same day.
The problem centered around
the listing of one candidate's!
name on the ballot. Jon Kooiker I
who has been running an active;
e a m p a i g n under the name ]
"Earth," was told last week that
he would have to be listed by his :
legal name on the ballot. Mon-J
day, at the polls, it was clear
that many voters did not know!
who Jon C. Kooiker was. That
night the ICC proceeded to count [
the ballots and then decided that j
they would void the elections.
There are several points about '
the affair which are irregular:
1. Since Kooiker was informed
last Monday that he would not
be listed as "Earth," he had more
than enough time to inform the
voters of his real name. Identifi

cation of the candidate is always j
j part of the political process.
2. Electioneering at the single !
i polling place was quite flagrant.
3. The ICC Vice President
! and person responsible for con
j ducting the elections was very
j uncertain about the proper pro
i cedures and did not consult the
ASSU Elections Commission.
4. The ICC should have re
solved the whole business last
I week; at that point it was simply
a question of whether or not
I pseudonyms were to be per
! mitted.
The ICC's action is particular
ly unfortunate because it comes
: at a time when there is a ques
i tion as to whether certain clubs
I will open next year. It has less
ened confidence in a body which
I has seldom demonstrated any
j leadership capability. Hopefully
l the new elections Wednesday will
; be conducted in a strict and open
! manner.

Editor, Tin* Daily:
J would like to clarify several
minor inaccuracies in yesterday's
editorial report, part of which
discussed a meeting of "one Stan
ford fraternity."
The meeting took place on
April 28. The purpose of the
meeting was to allow the house
executive committee a chance to
meet informally with an advisory
hoard of faculty and administra
tors to discuss house activities.
The HA candidates were to be
interviewed only incidentally. The
remarks alluded to in yesterday's
Daily were not part of the meet
ing. They occui*ed in conversation
before dinner.
Bob Pierce, Director of the
Alumni Association, was not in
volved in the pre-dinner conver
sation. Mr. Pierce has always
been diligent in maintaining his
neutrality in student affairs. He
had graciously volunteered hi s
home and hospitality and his
presence reflected only his inter
est in the fraternity.
On all other accounts, the re
port in The Daily yesterday was
faithful to the substance of the
remarks made by Dean Gordon
and Professor Wat kins on that
occasion.
I .KI TII ANDERSON
Editor's note: Yesterday's Edi
torial Report made reference to
Director of the Alumni Associa
tion Bob Pierce only to establish
the location of the fraternity
meeting in question. The Daily
in no way intended to imply that
Mr. Pierce had any part in the
discussion of student politics.
• Onesided Report
Editor, The Daily:
I have been a strong admirer
of the Steffen era at The Daily,
and am therefore doubly dis
turbed at the apparent onesided
ness of ihe editorial report in yes
terday's edition dealing with Pro
fessor Watkins. 112 know nothing
about the events of which the
editorial speaks, and am not now |
entering into the merits of th e j
case. But 1 musl record my im- 1
pression that while the students
involved were permitted to give
their views directly, no compar
able effort was marie to let Pro
fessor Watkins give his side of
the story directly. On four occa
sions the word "apparently" is
used to describe comments and
reactions of Dean Gordon and
Professor Watkins, and there is
no indication that an attempt was
made to discover whether these I
"apparent" conclusions were cor-i
reel or not.
I suggest that not only journa-i
listic honesty, but simple journa
listic courtesy, require that Pro
fessor Watkins be given an equal
ly direct hearing, rather than be-1
ing interpreted only at second or 1
third hand. Since you did not do
this in yesterday's article, I hope
you will redress the imbalance
in an early issue, so that those
of us who have admired your:
fort brightness and fairness on \
other issues will have that faith i
fully restored in relation to this ■
one.

ternities, have at last been held
j up to the light of day for the en
: tire campus to view. I have been
troubled that in the past weeks
innocent students have been dis
persing these rumors with knowl
edge neither of their source nor
authenticity. Perhaps now that
The Daily has opened the issue
to consideration by the entire

can judge for itself the content,

their creator. In any event, there

• Onesided Report
Editor, The Daily:
I have been a strong admirer
of the Steffen era at The Daily,
and am therefore doubly dis
turbed at the apparent onesided
ness of ihe editorial report in yes
terday's edition dealing with Pro
fessor Watkins. 112 know nothing
about the events of which the
editorial speaks, and am not now |
entering into the merits of th e j
case. But 1 musl record my im- 1
pression that while the students
involved were permitted to give
their views directly, no compar
able effort was marie to let Pro
fessor Watkins give his side of
the story directly. On four occa
sions the word "apparently" is
used to describe comments and
reactions of Dean Gordon and
Professor Watkins, and there is
no indication that an attempt was
made to discover whether these I
"apparent" conclusions were cor-i
reel or not.
I suggest that not only journa-i
listic honesty, but simple journa
listic courtesy, require that Pro
fessor Watkins be given an equal
ly direct hearing, rather than be-1
ing interpreted only at second or 1
third hand. Since you did not do
this in yesterday's article, I hope
you will redress the imbalance
in an early issue, so that those
of us who have admired your:
fort brightness and fairness on \
other issues will have that faith i
fully restored in relation to this ■
one.

EDITOR'S NOTE: The Daily,
too, regrets that we did not in
clude a direct statement from
Professor Watkins in yester-

day's report, in an effort to cor
rect the error, we contacted
Professor Watkins today by
phone, but he declined to com
ment. (See page 1 ).
• Clarification Asked
Editor, The Daily:
I am grateful, as is, no doubt,
j Professor Watkins that the ru
' mors he has been spreading in
I his classroom and through hi s
| position as faculty advisor to fra
ternities, have at last been held
j up to the light of day for the en
: tire campus to view. I have been
troubled that in the past weeks
innocent students have been dis
persing these rumors with knowl
edge neither of their source nor
authenticity. Perhaps now that
The Daily has opened the issue
to consideration by the entire
public, ihe university community
can judge for itself the content,
of the rumors and the motives of
their creator. In any event, there
are many of us who eagerly
await Dr. Watkins' clarification.
DAVE HARRIS
• Vicious Attack
Editor, The Daily:
Your vicious attack on Dr. Wat
kins displays more innuendo and
name-calling than proof or logic.
When added to such articles as
Justin Beck's "Rumours and
Rumblings" it displays an edi
torial policy for this volume of
Th." Daily that is less than jour
nalistically responsible.
You might better devote your
limited non-advertising space to
reporting of significant news de
velopments. You have made no
mention of the knifing of Stan
ford Sigma Chi's at their party
Saturday night. Your reportage
of Viet Nam was incredibly thin
for an event which drew larger
student audiences than any cam
pus event in the last four years.
May I humbly suggest that you
spend some time contemplating
the words of Mr. Storke, em
bossed in brass on one of the
columns of The Daily's new
home?

• I( !< ] irregularities
Editor, The Daily:
If there were difficulties with!
the ASSU elections Monday, they!
were minor compared to the!
gross mishandling of the Inter!
Club Council presidential elec
tions held on the same day.
The problem centered around
the listing of one candidate's!
name on the ballot. Jon Kooiker I
who has been running an active;
e a m p a i g n under the name ]
"Earth," was told last week that
he would have to be listed by his :
legal name on the ballot. Mon-J
day, at the polls, it was clear
that many voters did not know!
who Jon C. Kooiker was. That
night the ICC proceeded to count [
the ballots and then decided that j
they would void the elections.
There are several points about '
the affair which are irregular:
1. Since Kooiker was informed
last Monday that he would not
be listed as "Earth," he had more
than enough time to inform the
voters of his real name. Identifi

cation of the candidate is always j
j part of the political process.
2. Electioneering at the single !
i polling place was quite flagrant.
3. The ICC Vice President
! and person responsible for con
j ducting the elections was very
j uncertain about the proper pro
i cedures and did not consult the
ASSU Elections Commission.
4. The ICC should have re
solved the whole business last
I week; at that point it was simply
a question of whether or not
I pseudonyms were to be per
! mitted.
The ICC's action is particular
ly unfortunate because it comes
: at a time when there is a ques
i tion as to whether certain clubs
I will open next year. It has less
ened confidence in a body which
I has seldom demonstrated any
j leadership capability. Hopefully
l the new elections Wednesday will
; be conducted in a strict and open

Editor, Tin* Daily:
J would like to clarify several
minor inaccuracies in yesterday's
editorial report, part of which
discussed a meeting of "one Stan
ford fraternity."
The meeting took place on
April 28. The purpose of the
meeting was to allow the house
executive committee a chance to
meet informally with an advisory
hoard of faculty and administra
tors to discuss house activities.
The HA candidates were to be
interviewed only incidentally. The
remarks alluded to in yesterday's
Daily were not part of the meet
ing. They occui*ed in conversation
before dinner.
Bob Pierce, Director of the
Alumni Association, was not in
volved in the pre-dinner conver
sation. Mr. Pierce has always
been diligent in maintaining his
neutrality in student affairs. He
had graciously volunteered hi s
home and hospitality and his
presence reflected only his inter
est in the fraternity.

• I( !< ] irregularities
Editor, The Daily:
If there were difficulties with!
the ASSU elections Monday, they!
were minor compared to the!
gross mishandling of the Inter!
Club Council presidential elec
tions held on the same day.
The problem centered around
the listing of one candidate's!
name on the ballot. Jon Kooiker I
who has been running an active;
e a m p a i g n under the name ]
"Earth," was told last week that
he would have to be listed by his :
legal name on the ballot. Mon-J
day, at the polls, it was clear
that many voters did not know!
who Jon C. Kooiker was. That
night the ICC proceeded to count [
the ballots and then decided that j
they would void the elections.
There are several points about '
the affair which are irregular:
1. Since Kooiker was informed
last Monday that he would not
be listed as "Earth," he had more
than enough time to inform the
voters of his real name. Identifi

cation of the candidate is always j
j part of the political process.
2. Electioneering at the single !
i polling place was quite flagrant.
3. The ICC Vice President
! and person responsible for con
j ducting the elections was very
j uncertain about the proper pro
i cedures and did not consult the
ASSU Elections Commission.
4. The ICC should have re
solved the whole business last
I week; at that point it was simply
a question of whether or not
I pseudonyms were to be per
! mitted.
The ICC's action is particular
ly unfortunate because it comes
: at a time when there is a ques
i tion as to whether certain clubs
I will open next year. It has less
ened confidence in a body which
I has seldom demonstrated any
j leadership capability. Hopefully
l the new elections Wednesday will
; be conducted in a strict and open
! manner.

Editor, Tin* Daily:
J would like to clarify several
minor inaccuracies in yesterday's
editorial report, part of which
discussed a meeting of "one Stan
ford fraternity."
The meeting took place on
April 28. The purpose of the
meeting was to allow the house
executive committee a chance to
meet informally with an advisory
hoard of faculty and administra
tors to discuss house activities.
The HA candidates were to be
interviewed only incidentally. The
remarks alluded to in yesterday's
Daily were not part of the meet
ing. They occui*ed in conversation
before dinner.
Bob Pierce, Director of the
Alumni Association, was not in
volved in the pre-dinner conver
sation. Mr. Pierce has always
been diligent in maintaining his
neutrality in student affairs. He
had graciously volunteered hi s
home and hospitality and his
presence reflected only his inter
est in the fraternity.
On all other accounts, the re
port in The Daily yesterday was
faithful to the substance of the
remarks made by Dean Gordon
and Professor Wat kins on that
occasion.
I .KI TII ANDERSON
Editor's note: Yesterday's Edi
torial Report made reference to
Director of the Alumni Associa
tion Bob Pierce only to establish
the location of the fraternity
meeting in question. The Daily
in no way intended to imply that
Mr. Pierce had any part in the
discussion of student politics.
• Onesided Report
Editor, The Daily:
I have been a strong admirer
of the Steffen era at The Daily,
and am therefore doubly dis
turbed at the apparent onesided
ness of ihe editorial report in yes
terday's edition dealing with Pro
fessor Watkins. 112 know nothing
about the events of which the
editorial speaks, and am not now |
entering into the merits of th e j
case. But 1 musl record my im- 1
pression that while the students
involved were permitted to give
their views directly, no compar
able effort was marie to let Pro
fessor Watkins give his side of
the story directly. On four occa
sions the word "apparently" is
used to describe comments and
reactions of Dean Gordon and
Professor Watkins, and there is
no indication that an attempt was
made to discover whether these I
"apparent" conclusions were cor-i
reel or not.
I suggest that not only journa-i
listic honesty, but simple journa
listic courtesy, require that Pro
fessor Watkins be given an equal
ly direct hearing, rather than be-1
ing interpreted only at second or 1
third hand. Since you did not do
this in yesterday's article, I hope
you will redress the imbalance
in an early issue, so that those
of us who have admired your:
fort brightness and fairness on \
other issues will have that faith i
fully restored in relation to this ■
one.
ROBERT McAFEE BROWN
Professor of Religion
EDITOR'S NOTE: The Daily,
too, regrets that we did not in
clude a direct statement from
Professor Watkins in yester-

day's report, in an effort to cor
rect the error, we contacted
Professor Watkins today by
phone, but he declined to com
ment. (See page 1 ).
• Clarification Asked
Editor, The Daily:
I am grateful, as is, no doubt,
j Professor Watkins that the ru
' mors he has been spreading in
I his classroom and through hi s
| position as faculty advisor to fra
ternities, have at last been held
j up to the light of day for the en
: tire campus to view. I have been
troubled that in the past weeks
innocent students have been dis
persing these rumors with knowl
edge neither of their source nor
authenticity. Perhaps now that
The Daily has opened the issue
to consideration by the entire
public, ihe university community
can judge for itself the content,
of the rumors and the motives of
their creator. In any event, there
are many of us who eagerly
await Dr. Watkins' clarification.

• Vicious Attack
Editor, The Daily:
Your vicious attack on Dr. Wat
kins displays more innuendo and
name-calling than proof or logic.
When added to such articles as
Justin Beck's "Rumours and
Rumblings" it displays an edi
torial policy for this volume of
Th." Daily that is less than jour
nalistically responsible.
You might better devote your
limited non-advertising space to
reporting of significant news de
velopments. You have made no
mention of the knifing of Stan
ford Sigma Chi's at their party
Saturday night. Your reportage
of Viet Nam was incredibly thin
for an event which drew larger
student audiences than any cam
pus event in the last four years.
May I humbly suggest that you
spend some time contemplating
the words of Mr. Storke, em
bossed in brass on one of the
columns of The Daily's new
home?
