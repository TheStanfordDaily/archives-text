j The United Slates of America
j is facing one of its most critical
periods in this year of 1965. As
i American troops die in Viet Nam
; and the Dominican Republic, the
i home front is afire with accusa-
I (ions and counter accusations.
. Surveys and opinion polls, such
! as the Harris Survey of May 3,
i indicate such figures as 40 per
j cent in favor of U.S. involve-
I ment, 3S per cent opposed, 22 per
| cent undecided. Such divisions on
what should be a clear issue indi
cates either ignorance of the
j situation or true division as to
j the foreign policy of the United
i States.
From the voluminous amount
of information available 1o the
public, it seems only natural to
conclude that there is indeed a
deep and serious division among
the people. The opinion must!
swing one way or the other if any ,
foreign policy is to be effective, j
High political offices balance on j
this issue, and both sides will
readily agi*ee that some decisive j
foreign policy is needed.
However, the issue has become!
almost too emotional for both
sides. What is at stake is the en
tire basis of the American Ideal.
If support for withdrawal from
Viet Nam is successful, American
troops would withdraw from all
countries of the world in which
there is active involvement by
Americans, and future countries
would bo left to their own devices
in future incidents. The implica
tions of such withdrawal is the
prime source of disagreement.
For the past 60 years, the United
States has used troops, money
and even subversive involvement
in an effort to contain Commit-1
nist governments whether by
the choice of the people involved
or not. And unless drastic

changes are made in the voting
public, the United States will con
tinue to do just that.
Moral Implications
But suddenly the American
public has awakened to the moral
and legi'l implications of such
involvement. Much of this sup
port is fou.id in the University
and college communities as well
as foreign opinion. The students,
as well as their professors, are
finding that the American ideal
of freedom of choice is often not
present when the United States
deals with foreign countries. And
further, through success in civil
rights movements, they are dis
covering that they can indeed do
something about it. Rallies,
marches, petitions, and campaign
ing by students are fast becom
ing powerful forces in American
opinion.
The question now becomes, are
our means worth the end. Appar
ently many do not think they are.
Students are rebelling as much
against the hyprorisy of foreign
policy as they arc against the
methods of foreign policy. W i th
the development and refinment
of ultra-destructive weapons, the
need for peace is foremost in
many minds. The emotional ap
peal of this peace cry cannot be
ignored. But what also must not
be ignored is the political situa
tion of the world. As the situa
tion exisls today, the world is
divided between the forces of
Communism who advocate com
plete domination of the world,
through force or subversion
and those of the so-called "West
ern Nations" who are deter
mined to stop this domination
through the use of the same
means. This is an obvious situa
tion-which no one can deny.
What the American public
must decide is whether the con
tainment of Communism is worth
the price we are now paying,
and must continue to pay in the
future. The emotions and desires
for peace have cut the issue down
to too narrow a field. The issue

, seems to be the choice between
! war or peace. It is not. Instead,
}it is a choice between continued
'efforts to contain Communism —i
| and risk war both large and J
small, or complete surrender in j
hopes that the Communists will
I forget their pledges for world
1 domination.
What the American public
j must decide is whether they be
; lieve democracy a better way of
! life and a more acceptable way
of life than Communism. If they
| do, than we must continue to use
force, economic aid, and even sub
version in countries that do or
do not want us in the faith that
better living conditions and edu
cation will eventually bring a
stable democracy. The past years
have shown that it can be done.
If we believe in democracy, we
must risk war for a belter world.
If we do not believe it is worth
the risk, then we must resign
ourselves to the eventual imposi
tion of world Communism.
A F»ng Hard Battle
There will always he the risk,
lit cannot be ignored. But there
will also be the large chance of '
j success, but only after a long, !
| hard battle. If reform is needed, j
jit is needed in a clearer definition i
! and refinement of our purpose, j
j It is needed in an effort to elimi-1
| nate corruption and waste in the
j administration of our aid, both
j economic and military. It is J
needed in a clearer definition |
within our own minds. There will j
be mistakes, both moral and poli- j
i tical. There will be innocent |
j people killed, unwilling people j
1 imposed upon. We must accept;
' the evil with the good.
We cannot speak of peace i

; ni/ing the obvious implications of ;
I complete eventual destruction of
democracy. It is useless for us i
I to backdown now if we intend to !
I draw the line elsewhere. Wei

For the past 60 years, the United
States has used troops, money
and even subversive involvement
in an effort to contain Commit-1
nist governments whether by
the choice of the people involved
or not. And unless drastic

changes are made in the voting
public, the United States will con
tinue to do just that.
Moral Implications
But suddenly the American
public has awakened to the moral
and legi'l implications of such
involvement. Much of this sup
port is fou.id in the University
and college communities as well
as foreign opinion. The students,
as well as their professors, are
finding that the American ideal
of freedom of choice is often not
present when the United States
deals with foreign countries. And
further, through success in civil
rights movements, they are dis
covering that they can indeed do
something about it. Rallies,
marches, petitions, and campaign
ing by students are fast becom
ing powerful forces in American
opinion.
The question now becomes, are
our means worth the end. Appar
ently many do not think they are.
Students are rebelling as much
against the hyprorisy of foreign
policy as they arc against the
methods of foreign policy. W i th
the development and refinment
of ultra-destructive weapons, the
need for peace is foremost in
many minds. The emotional ap
peal of this peace cry cannot be
ignored. But what also must not
be ignored is the political situa
tion of the world. As the situa
tion exisls today, the world is
divided between the forces of
Communism who advocate com
plete domination of the world,
through force or subversion
and those of the so-called "West
ern Nations" who are deter
mined to stop this domination
through the use of the same
means. This is an obvious situa
tion-which no one can deny.
What the American public
must decide is whether the con
tainment of Communism is worth
the price we are now paying,
and must continue to pay in the
future. The emotions and desires
for peace have cut the issue down
to too narrow a field. The issue

, seems to be the choice between
! war or peace. It is not. Instead,
}it is a choice between continued
'efforts to contain Communism —i
| and risk war both large and J
small, or complete surrender in j
hopes that the Communists will
I forget their pledges for world
1 domination.
What the American public
j must decide is whether they be
; lieve democracy a better way of

of life than Communism. If they

force, economic aid, and even sub
version in countries that do or
do not want us in the faith that
better living conditions and edu
cation will eventually bring a
stable democracy. The past years
have shown that it can be done.
If we believe in democracy, we
must risk war for a belter world.
If we do not believe it is worth
the risk, then we must resign
ourselves to the eventual imposi

j The United Slates of America
j is facing one of its most critical
periods in this year of 1965. As
i American troops die in Viet Nam
; and the Dominican Republic, the
i home front is afire with accusa-
I (ions and counter accusations.
. Surveys and opinion polls, such
! as the Harris Survey of May 3,
i indicate such figures as 40 per
j cent in favor of U.S. involve-
I ment, 3S per cent opposed, 22 per

what should be a clear issue indi
cates either ignorance of the
j situation or true division as to
j the foreign policy of the United
i States.
From the voluminous amount
of information available 1o the
public, it seems only natural to
conclude that there is indeed a
deep and serious division among
the people. The opinion must!
swing one way or the other if any ,
foreign policy is to be effective, j
High political offices balance on j
this issue, and both sides will
readily agi*ee that some decisive j
foreign policy is needed.
However, the issue has become!
almost too emotional for both
sides. What is at stake is the en
tire basis of the American Ideal.
If support for withdrawal from
Viet Nam is successful, American
troops would withdraw from all
countries of the world in which
there is active involvement by
Americans, and future countries
would bo left to their own devices
in future incidents. The implica
tions of such withdrawal is the
prime source of disagreement.
For the past 60 years, the United
States has used troops, money
and even subversive involvement
in an effort to contain Commit-1
nist governments whether by
the choice of the people involved
or not. And unless drastic

changes are made in the voting
public, the United States will con
tinue to do just that.
Moral Implications
But suddenly the American
public has awakened to the moral
and legi'l implications of such
involvement. Much of this sup
port is fou.id in the University
and college communities as well
as foreign opinion. The students,
as well as their professors, are
finding that the American ideal
of freedom of choice is often not
present when the United States
deals with foreign countries. And
further, through success in civil
rights movements, they are dis
covering that they can indeed do
something about it. Rallies,
marches, petitions, and campaign
ing by students are fast becom
ing powerful forces in American
opinion.
The question now becomes, are
our means worth the end. Appar
ently many do not think they are.
Students are rebelling as much
against the hyprorisy of foreign
policy as they arc against the
methods of foreign policy. W i th
the development and refinment
of ultra-destructive weapons, the
need for peace is foremost in
many minds. The emotional ap
peal of this peace cry cannot be
ignored. But what also must not
be ignored is the political situa
tion of the world. As the situa
tion exisls today, the world is
divided between the forces of
Communism who advocate com
