## 'Faculty-Master Plan' Questioned 
### Steve Leopold 
Questions about both the ef
ficacy and timing of the proposal
to install a "faculty master" in
Wilbur next year have come from
many sources, particularly from
the sponsors.
All parties would probably
agree with Dean of Undergradu
ate Education Robert Wert's
statement that "there has been
more rush than we like," but a

division exists on the question
of whether urgency should have
taken precedence over thorough
consultation and discussion in
the decision-making process.
According to Wert and Assis
tant Dean of Undergraduate Ed
ucation Robert Hind, the proposed
faculty-master will "provide the
leadership in blending the social
and academic aspects of residence

living." There will be lew "guide
lines" from the Administration, |
thus leaving the faculty-master
with such prerogatives as:
• Full participation in the nam
ing of the two additional adminis- j
j trators at Wilbur- the Counsellor j
land the Business Manager. Pres
ently, it is assumed that both
| men will be responsible to the
faculty-master.
• The major say in ehosing the
j six new faculty resident associ
j ates in Wilbur next year.
• The right to appraise all
j aspects of the Wilbur system and
| the "freedom to explore with
| RA's, TA's or anybody else to
I make it work."
• Membership on such impor
tant committees as Admissions
and Undergraduate Educat ion.
• Primary responsibility for
the academic and cultural pro-1
grams pursued in Wilbur itself i
and a dominant role in reforming !
freshman curriculum.
The master, then, represents a I
major innovation in what Direc
tor of Wilbur Douglas Davis
called " a trend toward using the
residence program as a part of
the teaching program." Few have j
argued with the concept, though >
there is some question of how
a "senior faculty member" can bo I
persuaded to give up his research, j
departmental politics, his home!
and half his academic commit-j
merits to move into Wilbur.
Faculty-Master's Hole
As sponsor Larry Spears point- j
ed out, the faculty-master wilJ be j
relieved of his work on his do-:
partmental committees, yet in his
i new job he will serve on several
| new administrative committees
| such as Wert's committee on Un-1
! dorgraduate Education and the!
Admissions Committee. Moreover,)
as Wert acknowledged, the first I
i faculty-master at Stanford will i
undoubtedly have to take to the
: hustings to explain the program •
to the alumni at their 20-odd con- j
j ferences next year across the
j country.
On the whole, however, the sys-!
j tem is probably sound; it has been j
; iii use at Harvard and Yale since
| the 2()'s with excellent results. j
If the exact nature of the fac-1
ulty-master's job is still unclear
tlue to lack of precedent - just
i how much autonomy and how

much experimentation will the
first one exercise? the compan
ion job of Councellor is even
more nebulous at this time.
Hind explained that the Ad
ministration is waiting until a
1 acuity-master has been chosen,
before discussing the post and
what function its occupant will
have. Davis said that ideally this
job would be used for "affirma
tive counselling" and not just
"crisis counselling."
Reference Service
However, head sponsor Fred
Golf noted that if the Counsellor
is to be "more than a reference
service for freshmen referring
them to tlie Health Service or
Counselling and Testing he must
be someone whom the deans, the
sponsors and the freshmen trust
arifl respect."
Most of the criticism, though,
has been directed toward the tim
ing of the move. The concept has
been discussed most of this year
in conjunction with the proposed
Moore and Jacks coe*! dorms;
however, as Wert told The Daily,
the idea of installing this system
in Wilbur next year originated
only a few months ago.
Since then, the discussion and
consultation both on the program
and on which faculty member
would best fill the post has been
carried only solely among ad
mindistrators and a few members
of the faculty.
Sponsors' Part
The sponsors were notified ear
lier this quarter that a faculty
master might be placed in charge
next year, but their opinion, as
Wert acknowledges, was not so
licited by the committee except
in an indirect manner through
Davis.
Recently, Wert asked an un
identified member of the faculty
to become the first Wilbur mas
ter. Even Ihe members of his com
mittee are unaware of just who
was asked.
Thus, a post of as yet unde
fined authority and unlimited
duration Wert said that Stan
ford's program would parallel
Harvard's and Yale's in that the
master would probably have the
job "as long as he wants it"—has
been created and offered with
only a minimal amount of con
sultation with the student body
and specifically those students
who have had the most contact
with the freshmen and the Wil
bur system.
