# Indians Back Into CIBA Title As USC Beats Santa Clara, 6-5
## First Card Baseball Crown in 12 Years 
### PETE KING 
Stanford's baseball team won its first California Intercollegiate i
I
Baseball Association championship in 12 years yesterday, as USC i
pushed tin* Cards through the back door to the title by beating i
contender Santa Clara, 6-5.
Stanford had already completed the CIBA season with a 12-S!

record by dropping two games to-
Santa Clara, and if the Broncos
could have won three more games,
they would also have a 12-8 rec
ord, as would Cal. TJie three-team
tie would have necessitated a
playoff.
But help from an unexpected
source—USC evened the Santa
Clara record at 9 9 and squelched
their chances to tie.
Cal Series Crucial
Stanford beat Cal in three of
the four games between the
schools, and thus gets the nod to
enter the playoffs for a berth in
the College World Series at Oma

Where Stanford goes from here
;is uncertain. Four teams from
! District Eight must play off to
: determine the representative to
I Omaha. They are Stanford, Wash-
I ington State, Cal Poly of Po
; monoa, and San Fernando Valley
i State College.
Stanford coach Dutch Fehring
expects word from the NCAA se
lection committee soon on the
procedure for the district playoff.
Right now there are two probable
decisions: 1) Cal Poly and San
! Fernando will play a game, the

winner will play Stanford at
Sunken Diamond this weekend,
and that winner will play Wash
ington State at Pullman next
weekend, two out of three games;
or 2> there will be a four-team
double - elimination tournament
held May 27-29 at either Pullman
or Stanford.

Luck Strikes Twice

Whatever the decision, Stanford
has won its first CIBA cham
pionship since 1953, when the
team lied with USC at 10-6. Luck
was with the Tribe then, too, for
Stanford won a coin flip for the
Omaha tournament berth. In the
World Series, Stanford lost to
Michigan, 4-0, beat Houston, 7-6,

I and losl to Lafayette, 4-3, to go !
unplaced.
The Cards are currently ranked
eighth in the nation by ihe news
| paper Collegiate Baseball. Wash
' ington State, with a 25-6 record,
is third, and Santa Clara is ninth.
Stanford led tne league for all I
! but one day, although it was the
cloest CIBA race in years. After
!an 8-0 loss to Cal, the Tribe's
i pitching staff put on an amazing
I demonstration of firepower as I
I Stanford won its next five league
i games.
Pitching Streak
During that streak the pitchers
| yielded just two earned runs in 43
j innings. Daro Quiring and John
i Mason each won two of the
games, and Terry Doeken won
the other.
Then disaster struck, with two
losses to Santa Clara, to set up
ihe possibility of a three-way tie.
I But USC, which plummeted from
the championship last year to a
9-11 league record this season,
graciously beat the Broncos on
USC's home field.
A pair of two-run homers by
Darrell Wilkins and Mike Gar
rett paced the Trojan attack,
j Bronco Ray Henningson clubbed a
three-run homer with two out in
J the ninth inning to close the gap
| to 6-5. It was Hcnningson's eighth
CIBA homer, a league reocrd.
