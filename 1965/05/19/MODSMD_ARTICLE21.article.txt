## From Cellar to 1st Place: Story of Stanford Baseball 
### Pete King 
A rags-to-riches saga that Ho
ratio Alger in his most glorious
bursts of inspiration could not
have conceived has just happened
at Stanford.
A baseball team that was the
New York Mets of the CIBA con
ference last year now sits regally,
if somewhat shakily, at the top.
A team which suffered through
a sickly, 4-16 CIBA season with a
sophomore-studded lineup used
six of those players plus practi
cally the identical pitching staff
to go 12-S the next season and
take it all.
The team is Stanford, a name
that people familiar with colle
giate champions don't hear very
often. For Stanford, with nearly
always fairly good material, al
ways seems to wind up somehow
below where the "experts" picked
them to finish.
Last week, Stanford was lead
ing the CIBA by two full games
with only two games left to play.
Then, an all too-familiar pattern
struck. The team blew a pair of

| games to Santa Clara and once j
again, Stanford had seemingly
snatched defeat from the jaws of
certain victory.
Unexpected Help
But then came help from unex
pected quarters. USC, a team
which had lost eight of 11 league
games by one run .beat the high
flying Santa Clara Broncos, 6-5.
Stanford's amazing resurgence
in one season can be attributed to
many people. First baseman Pete I
Middlekauff raised his batting i
average from .242 to .385 in one j
year. Sophomore pitcher Daro |
Quiring proved a pleasant sur- j
prise, winning nine of 12 games.
Sophomore Dick Swan filled in
brilliantly at shortstop for the
graduated Gary Smith. Swan hit
.323, about the same as Smith, but j
was less error-prone.
Terry Docken, the most improv
ed pitcher on the team, went from
a 1-3 record and a 4.95 earned run
average to 4-0 and 2.25 (1.65 in
the CIBA i. Centerfielder Bob
Cox, one of only two seniors
among the 14 regulars, had his
best year, batting .303, but more
importantly, leading the team in
runs batted in, with 32. Sopho
more catcher Bill Boles won three
clutch games with ninth inning i
j hits, batting .378, and covering
I home plate so well that 1961 all
j CIBA catcher Jim Hibbs found
! himself playing third base occa
sionally.

Dick Kovacevich, Stanford's

which limited his duties to being
third base coach.

which had lost eight of 11 league
games by one run .beat the high
flying Santa Clara Broncos, 6-5.
Stanford's amazing resurgence
in one season can be attributed to
many people. First baseman Pete I
Middlekauff raised his batting i
average from .242 to .385 in one j
year. Sophomore pitcher Daro |
Quiring proved a pleasant sur- j
prise, winning nine of 12 games.
Sophomore Dick Swan filled in
brilliantly at shortstop for the
graduated Gary Smith. Swan hit
.323, about the same as Smith, but j
was less error-prone.
Terry Docken, the most improv
ed pitcher on the team, went from
a 1-3 record and a 4.95 earned run
average to 4-0 and 2.25 (1.65 in
the CIBA i. Centerfielder Bob
Cox, one of only two seniors
among the 14 regulars, had his
best year, batting .303, but more
importantly, leading the team in
runs batted in, with 32. Sopho
more catcher Bill Boles won three
clutch games with ninth inning i
j hits, batting .378, and covering

j CIBA catcher Jim Hibbs found

Coach Dutch Fehring, who in

gives substantial praise to a new i
i pitching coach, Eddie Allen. Allen, 1
a former USC player who man
| aged the 1955 Armed Forces All
! Star Team, worked with Docken,
: John Mason, and Mike Connelly
three losers last year — and
and turned them into winners.
Under his guidance, the pitch- j
I ers gave up 27 fewer runs in the |
i CIBA than last year and compiled
an ERA a full one run under
1964'5. This, despite a sore arm by
Dick Kovacevich, Stanford's
mound workhorse last season,
which limited his duties to being
third base coach.
A rags-to-riches saga that Ho
ratio Alger in his most glorious
bursts of inspiration could not
have conceived has just happened
at Stanford.
A baseball team that was the
New York Mets of the CIBA con
ference last year now sits regally,
if somewhat shakily, at the top.
A team which suffered through
a sickly, 4-16 CIBA season with a
sophomore-studded lineup used
six of those players plus practi
cally the identical pitching staff
to go 12-S the next season and
take it all.
The team is Stanford, a name
that people familiar with colle
giate champions don't hear very
often. For Stanford, with nearly
always fairly good material, al
ways seems to wind up somehow
below where the "experts" picked
them to finish.
Last week, Stanford was lead
ing the CIBA by two full games
with only two games left to play.
Then, an all too-familiar pattern
struck. The team blew a pair of

| games to Santa Clara and once j
again, Stanford had seemingly
snatched defeat from the jaws of
certain victory.
