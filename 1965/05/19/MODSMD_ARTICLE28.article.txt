## Stanford's Second-Place Syndrome Maintains Egghead-Jock Equilibrium 
### Roger Magnuson 
The two denim clad lads being
taught-in for a fifth consecutive
hour were apparently finding the
aggregate effect of tlie program
temporarily fatiguing.
They turned their flagging vo
tarian interest into some specu
lations about Stanford sports.
"Boy, it's really a bad break
that the baseball team didn't beat
Santa Clara Friday. 1 think they'd
a had a fairly good chance in
the NCAA," the one muttered.
The other was sulking. "Well,
they still have a chance, of
course. But I don't know about
how bad a break it was to lose,
after all. What if they had won,
and eventually gone all the way?
As, of course, they still could."
Effghead or Jock?
"How can you say that?" ob

jurated the first, speaking some
what loudly to be heard over
the State Department official in
the background.
"Well, it's obvious," the other
replied, "that no University can
serve two masters. What has
Forum to do with the Coliseum?
We must either be egghead or
jock."
"I think that's a little extreme.
Although a friend of mine from
Oberlin did ask me the other day
when the baseball ratings were
published where I was a PE ma
jor."
The thudding of applause sig
nailed the end of another speech
and the two students returned
their attention to the podium. But
the question of choosing between
the two extremes they raised is

really quite legitimate.
How good in intercollegiate
sports dare we get?
The gurgling excitement of the
student body when one of its ath
letic teams appears on the verge
of a championship is an emotion
not strange to even the "prestige
schools."
Certainly it is not strange to
Stanford.
But to these schools, such
championships are confronted
with highly ambivalent feelings,
and a rather sticky question: Can
an academic school do well
enough in sports to attract the
satisfying donations of its ath
letically inclined alumni, while
doing poorly enough to retain its
intellectual papers?
The Eastern Synthesis
The caster n schools have
reached a synthesis of a sort by
playing within the cozy confines
of a conference consisting only
of respectable academic- institu
tions.
Winning Ihc Ivy League Con
ference championship is a savory
enough feat to moisten the eye of
an old grad, and yet does not, in
any sense, threaten the school's
image.
For, after all, everyone knows
that Princeton's Tigers definitely
are not. (Although Harvard's
Crimson sometimes aie.>
Thus a tenuous balance exists,
and the athletes and academicians
coexist in an essentially un
strained tandem.
Which is not to say that there
are not some concomitant frus
trations and disutility suffered.
Since their football involves no
intense recruiting (and hence
their games no intense action) a
lot of money is sacrificed in tele
vision revenues, and. to be sure,
in game attendance.
Tile Stanford Equilibrium
Stanford, also, has achieved
some manner of equilibrium sit
uation.
Since it has no small coterie of
schools in tho vicinity willing or
able to unite into a monolithic
conference (the prospect of play
ing Cal Tech and Pomona is
simply too sanguinary) Stanford
must virtually give up the game
or compete on a level with the
other schools in ihe conference, to
most of whom athletics is slightly
more than a useful diversion for
Saturday afternoons.
Giving up the game is too ex
pensive.
Becoming a greal power (ex
cept in sports such as lacrosse,
rugby, swimming, crew, and the
like in which such aspirations
are justifiable for a "prestige"
school) in sports is too embar
rassing.
Healthy minds in healthy bodies
is a great slogan for Bob Rich
ards. but after a while it is easy
to become skeptical over the aca
demic standards of a perennial
powerhouse.
So, Stanford has settled for the
second place syndrome, a syn
drome which allows, with varying
degrees of fluidity, finishes lower
than second, hut which forbids
all hut transitory ventures above
that level.
Unlike our eastern brethern,
Stanford plays well enough to
merit an occasional national tele
vision spot and draws fairly well,
especially away from home.
While our recruiting is fairly
heavy, it is not so heavy as to
raise serious protest from aca
demic circles.
Whither Stanford Atheltics?
But what about the future?
It is boggling to consider where
Stanford could go from here. As

competition for admission be
comes more intense, admissions
officials will be taxing longei and
longer looks at marginal athletic
prospects. As more and more
money is needed for the operation
of the institution itself, revenue
from sports events will look more
and more inviting.
Perhaps, lacking other schools
with similar academic aspirations
and unwilling to forego major
sports, Stanford will continue to
settle for the second place syn
drome. Which is, perhaps the best
synthesis possible of diverging
interests.
For it, unlike its sister syn
thesis in the 1 Ivy League, permits
one of its teams, now and then,
to win something of value.
