# CHAPPIE BRA SALESMAN
## Wilbur Wonder Warren G. Missing 
### SHERRY ROSEN 
Where is Warren G. Wonka? The
whereabouts of that wily, worldly, well
known Wilbur wonder who popped up
again in last week's Daily under the
simple guise of Heaven forbid a typi
cal student are still unknown.
The elusive Warren G. has haunted the
campus and conscience of Stanford since
his 1948 debut as a Chappie bra sales
man. Instantly revered by all as a
kindred Stanford spirit, Warren has
since chalked up an amazing history of
scholarship, activity, and prowess.
In between his multifarious adventures
around the world, Wan en has managed
to sign blue cards and register for nearly
every University course offered. Quite a
whiz at taking exams, he pulled a B in
a Western Civ final. lie is also an old
hand at graduating, having been listed
in commencement programs several
times.
Indeed, it is no wonder that in 1 f),~> 1
the Registrar's Office when outlining
study plans chose Warren as the typical
lower division student. However, in rec
ognition of the high caliber of Warren's
successors at Wilbur today, Dr. Harvey
Hall was obliged to confess that Wonka
would never be admitted to Stanford
today with the qualifications that ad
mit tod him in 19.~>0

Culture Vulture
Warren's cultural and intellectual en
deavors are by no means limited to the
campus. He keeps in touch with the out
side world via an as-yet unpaid subscrip
tion to Time magazaine, which is de
live red weekly to The Daily Post Office
box.
Devoutly eager to serve his country,
Warren registered for the draft in 1948.
lit was perhaps his disappointment at
being rejected that led Warren to vent
his spleen by stulifying th<* campus one
October morning with the mysterious ap
pearance of hug black footsteps march
ing up the side of Hoover Tower.)
Among Wonka's extra-curricular ae
tivilies is a deeply-rooted love of music,
as witnessed by the staff writeup in the
19i>9 Stanford Band handbook: "Warren
G. MacWonka: head Scotch bass section;
holder of Shuchat Legion of Merit
Award; professor of triangle, tissue pa
per and comb, kazoo, and sex."
The First Ambivalent
Also an ace politico, Warren has bat
fled observers of (Ik* political scene with
his ambiguous ambivalence. During the
195fi presidential race, a letter thanking
WGW for his suport and signed by the
late Senator Estes Kefauver was re
ceived at Toyon Hall. Apparently still
seeking his ideological identity. Warren

later enrolled as a member of the "Nixon
in '60" club.
In between quarters at Stanford, War
ren enjoys a life of service to humanity
in under-developed parts of the world.
An airmail postcard sent from Timbuktu
in 19(50 attested to the discovery by three
Stanford students of the whereabouts of
the missing Professor W. (J. Wonka.
This ad hoc "Stanford-on-Safari" over
seas program found the African natives'
Great White Father "busily engaged in
his spiritual and healing work among
ihe population." To date The Daily is
still waiting for promised photographs of
that historic reunion in the heart of
darkness.
Wonka on lee
N'o matter how far from home, War
ren never forgets his alma mater. Dur
ing his 1961 participation in the U.S.
Navy Operation Deepfreeze, Warren got
wind of the rapid PACE of Stanford
life and was moved to join the fund
raising campaign. Accordingly, a let to
postmarked "Byrd Station, Antarctica"
enclosed the first donation toward the
Ford Foundation matching grant.
Accompanying the $5 bill was a heart
warming note from Wonka apologizing
for not have sent the contribution sooner,
since, "duo to our isolation IMorseton is
situated ,it X'.? degrees S, 1'?f) decree W,

population 3, elevation 2,220 loot), news
is shomevvhat slow in arriving here."
Farsighted and responsible, our hero
was careful to apply for student in
surance long before embarking upon this
most recent adventure. (This action was
no doubt spurred on by his brush with
death in a 1951 ear accident, as reported
by I lie Associated Press, involving six
members of the Stanford Band traveling
to the University of Washington.)
Insurance Prohs
According to E. Thomas Grimes, man
ager of the brokerage service depart
ment of the Continental-National Group
Life Insurance Co., Wonka's application
was received and approved; however, his
policy will not begin until the company
can locate him to collect $21 for his first
premium. Grimes' letter to Wonka was
received at Hoover Library, where some
one readdressed it "Misaddressed Mem
ber of Stanford Daily Staff."
And here is the crux of the matter
Although Warren doc s not know if, lie
is not insured. Therefore, for the sake of
his anxious parents, Mr. and Mrs. Won
ka, Senior, of Walla Walla, Wash., his
former professors, and all of his many
campus fans, we urge anyone who has
heard from Wonka to relay this mes
sage:
"WARREN COME HOME!"
