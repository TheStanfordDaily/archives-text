The Humour
! The report charged that Wat-

j ordinator for student affairs.
Also present on the latter occa

Late yesterday, MacKenzie

I account of his conversation with
Watkins. "I had heard during the
campaign that Dr. Watkins was
giving currency to a rumour that
had no basis in fact, he said. "So
after the campaign, I went to see
him to clear up any misunder
standing. . . .
"I was a little upset to .see
I quote marks used in The Daily's
' account of our conversation
! because it was not an interview
