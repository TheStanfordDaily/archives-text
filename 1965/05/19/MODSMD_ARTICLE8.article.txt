alleged involvement in the recent
ASSU presidential campaign.

The Humour

I kins had. on one occasion, given

given currency to a rumour that

Mackenzie Concurs
Late yesterday, MacKenzie
j again substantiated The Daily's
I account of his conversation with
Watkins. "I had heard during the
campaign that Dr. Watkins was
giving currency to a rumour that
had no basis in fact, he said. "So
after the campaign, I went to see
him to clear up any misunder
standing. . . .
"I was a little upset to .see
I quote marks used in The Daily's
' account of our conversation
! because it was not an interview
but merely a personal conversa
tion —- but the particulars re
ferred to in The Daily's story
were perfectly correct."
In reference to The Daily's re
port and YVatkin's attribution of
the rumour, Frederic O. Glover,
executive assistant to the Presi
dent, yesterday commented, "I
don't think any of us |in the ad
ministration) know the source of
the story ... I know it was
picked up all over the campus.
. . . It came to us from at least
three different sources .... None
of us know where it started, but
I think we'd be greatly interested
in finding out."
Lyle M. Nelson, Director of
University Relations, who had
also heard the rumour, added to
Glover's comments: "I did hear
the rumour. ... I believe I heard
it from another member of the
staff —not the president's staff.
. . . So far as I know, Watkins
didn't get it from any source
around here."

Mackenzie Concurs
Late yesterday, MacKenzie
j again substantiated The Daily's
I account of his conversation with
Watkins. "I had heard during the
campaign that Dr. Watkins was
giving currency to a rumour that
had no basis in fact, he said. "So
after the campaign, I went to see
him to clear up any misunder
standing. . . .
"I was a little upset to .see
I quote marks used in The Daily's
' account of our conversation
! because it was not an interview
but merely a personal conversa
tion —- but the particulars re
ferred to in The Daily's story
were perfectly correct."
In reference to The Daily's re
port and YVatkin's attribution of
the rumour, Frederic O. Glover,
executive assistant to the Presi
dent, yesterday commented, "I
don't think any of us |in the ad
ministration) know the source of
the story ... I know it was
picked up all over the campus.
. . . It came to us from at least
three different sources .... None
of us know where it started, but
I think we'd be greatly interested
in finding out."
Lyle M. Nelson, Director of
University Relations, who had
also heard the rumour, added to
Glover's comments: "I did hear
the rumour. ... I believe I heard
it from another member of the
staff —not the president's staff.
. . . So far as I know, Watkins
didn't get it from any source
around here."
