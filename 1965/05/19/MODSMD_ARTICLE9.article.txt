Contact with (lie Trustees
In regard to the Board of Trus
tees, Sterling said that he had
been in contact with them on
several recent issues. lie ex
plained that it is part of his duty
to keep the Trustees informed.
"The more informed they are, the
better Trustees they will be," he
said. "That applies to the rest of
the University community, too.
The meat of the coconut is that
we try to keep in close communi
cation with each other."
The process of upgrading Stan
ford-now a $100 million-a-year
complex has brought increasing
demands on his time. Consequent

j ly. Sterling is no longer able to
spend "as much time with stu
j dents as I used to, or as I would
like. Even so, I manage to spend
considerable time with them in
my office, in my home, and in
student residences."
'Another Fence to Mend'
The size of his immediate staff,
including secretaries, has grown
from six when he took office
in 1949 to more than twenty to
day, he noted. Yet, in spite of
this, he feels that the President's
office is understaffed.
A growing University and na
tional developments in education
have extended the range of the
presidency, he explained, pointing
out, "There was more opportunity
when I took office to be directly

and personally involved with (he
educational work of the Univer
sity than there is today."
The deeply lined face and
drooping eyes of the President
express the physical toll that six
teen years at the University's
helm have taken on his hulking
frame. Still on a somewhat re
stricted schedule as a result of
illness last year, Sterling divides
his time among the various re
sponsibilities of his office.
Portions of his time devoted
to these responsibilities "vary,"
he said, but include the equivalent
of at least a week out of every
month away from his office, in
cluding two days monthly at the
Board of Trustees meeting in San
Francisco.
He estimates that he spends
the equivalent of a day or a day
and a half per week in what he
terms "handling the papers" —
keeping up with correspondence
and the affairs of the day—and at
least an equivalent amount of
time on student affairs.
In addition, he carries a fairly
heavy reading load of reports
both typewritten and mimeo
graphed--and still manages to
find time to read some history,
mostly biography.
Rut all the same, he seems to
enjoy his work, and receives a
great deal of satisfaction from it.
"It's a fascinating job," he con
cluded. "I'm a country boy, and
it reminds me of a farmer's work
it's never done. There's always
another fence to mend."

Contact with (lie Trustees
In regard to the Board of Trus
tees, Sterling said that he had
been in contact with them on
several recent issues. lie ex
plained that it is part of his duty
to keep the Trustees informed.
"The more informed they are, the
better Trustees they will be," he
said. "That applies to the rest of
the University community, too.
The meat of the coconut is that
we try to keep in close communi
cation with each other."
The process of upgrading Stan
ford-now a $100 million-a-year
complex has brought increasing
demands on his time. Consequent

j ly. Sterling is no longer able to
spend "as much time with stu
j dents as I used to, or as I would
like. Even so, I manage to spend
considerable time with them in
my office, in my home, and in
student residences."
'Another Fence to Mend'
The size of his immediate staff,
including secretaries, has grown
from six when he took office
in 1949 to more than twenty to
day, he noted. Yet, in spite of
this, he feels that the President's
office is understaffed.
A growing University and na
tional developments in education
have extended the range of the
presidency, he explained, pointing
out, "There was more opportunity
when I took office to be directly

and personally involved with (he
educational work of the Univer
sity than there is today."
The deeply lined face and
drooping eyes of the President
express the physical toll that six
teen years at the University's
helm have taken on his hulking
frame. Still on a somewhat re
stricted schedule as a result of
illness last year, Sterling divides
his time among the various re
sponsibilities of his office.
Portions of his time devoted
to these responsibilities "vary,"
he said, but include the equivalent
of at least a week out of every
month away from his office, in
cluding two days monthly at the
Board of Trustees meeting in San
Francisco.
He estimates that he spends
the equivalent of a day or a day
and a half per week in what he
terms "handling the papers" —
keeping up with correspondence
and the affairs of the day—and at
least an equivalent amount of
time on student affairs.
In addition, he carries a fairly
heavy reading load of reports
both typewritten and mimeo
graphed--and still manages to
find time to read some history,
mostly biography.
Rut all the same, he seems to
enjoy his work, and receives a
great deal of satisfaction from it.
"It's a fascinating job," he con
cluded. "I'm a country boy, and
it reminds me of a farmer's work
it's never done. There's always
another fence to mend."
