• Junta Claims Total Control
SANTO DOMINGO. Dominican Republic
The junta president, Brig. Gen. Antonio Im
bort Barrera, told a cheering rally of about
1,000 followers yesterday, "we have absolute
control of the Dominican Republic."
The crowd shouted back:
"Wo don't wont a truce. Out with com
munism."
Imbcrt spoke from a second floor balcony at
his headquarters in the National Palace of
Congress, inside the U.S.-occupied interna

The rally came after junta troops had over
run the rebel radio station and most of north
ern Santo Domingo where rebel resistance col
lapsed.
Imbert told an interviewer later that a com
promise with the rebel forces of Col. Francisco
Caamano Deno was out of the question. He
said his five-man junta was pushing for an

unconditional surrender by the rebels, holed
up in their downtown enclave, and would talk
with Caamano only to discuss surrender terms.
