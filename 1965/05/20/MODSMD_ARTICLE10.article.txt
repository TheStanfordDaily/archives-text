# Craps And Crayons At Minnesota

MINNEAPOLIS (CPS) — Stu
dents at the University of Minne
sota recent ly ran a nursery school
—for college students.
Students — college students
attending the school, which met
in the university's student union,
busily played with building blocks,
modeling clay, crayons, board
games, and jigsaw puzzles. Cray
on drawings lined the wall be
hind them.
The school was presided over
by Betsy Luck, a sophomore edu
cation major, and was promptly
named "Mother Luck's Nurserj-
School."
Mother Luck's charges were
not going through a second child
hood brought on by the pressures
of final examinations—as the cas
ual observer might have deduced
—but were actually staging a pro
test demonstration against a deci
sion by the student union's Board
of Governors to ban card playing
in the building's grill area.
The Board decided that card
playing cannot be controlled there
and could spread into gambling.
Card games are permitted in the
union's gameroom, but the stu
dents say that the room is too
small to accommodate everyone
who wants to play, and that eating
is not permitted there.
So Mother Luck's Nursery
School was born as a "spontane
ous group action" to protest the
situation. One enrollce said most
of the students involved in th e
protest preferred to "work
through channels." But, he added,
"we intend to push this thing all
the way."
