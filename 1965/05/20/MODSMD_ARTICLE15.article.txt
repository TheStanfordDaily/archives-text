# W.G. Wonka Meets University Murals
## 
### HUGH WEST 
The story has been told and documented many times about how
the übiquitous Mr. Warren G. Wonka has at various times and
j places invaded the Stanford campus. But the story has only been
half-told. For some strange reason the mosi exciting of his en
counters has only recently been uncovered in his letters home: The
Strange Encounter With Stanford Intramurals.
Warren was a jock in High School. He lettered in football, basket- j
ball, and baseball three years running. He also was president of i
the Letterman's Club because he had a Straight-A average. Quite
obviously he was well-rounded.
But when Warren came to Stanford he decided that the character
building involved in Intercollegiate Athletic Competition With Some
of the Nation's Finest Teams, played in a campus Blessed With Un
usually Spacious and Fine Athletic Facilities were not exactly his!
cup of tea.
No Job Offer
There was no real reason for this decision on Warren's part, but
j the fact that he had not signed a letter of intent, nor been offered a
job with the food service, nor knew what the word BAC meant
j just made him wonder whether he was a "Deserving athlete who
; satisfied the University's requirements for admission."
But on to the story. Warren (his jock friends in High School 1
| called him "the Wonka") decided that if he was to remain well-;
i rounded and worthy of the name Stanford Man he should try Stan-;
ford's intramural program.
So the Wonka found his way down to the Intramural Office and 1
secured a copy of the Intramural Handbook.
The handbook featured a picture of Chuck Taylor. Warren re- I
| membered that as the name he found written on the back of his 1
tennis shoes. His excitement mounted.
Warren read the list of offerings: Bowling, Pocket Billiards, Bas
ketball Free Throws, Table Tennis, Horseshoes. Such things as Touch
j Football and Basketball were thrown in just in case someone might
I want them.
You can imagine how excited Warren was then. He didn't want to '
case aspersion on anybody or anything, but he did wonder a bit
i whether this fare might just make him a little more "well-rounded" I
: than he was wanting to be.
Warren Reflects
Warren reflected for a while and decided that perhaps these
activities reflected the claim that the booklet made that "It is the
primary purpose of the Intramural program to provide every
student in Stanford University the opportunity to compete and par-
I ticipate in an athletic or recreational activity of his desire."
But Warren rejected a little more and decided that what he ob-:
served empirically during Pie-Reg was that this list did not include'
that activity which for most students was the "Activity of his de-1
sire." Warren wondered if the athletic department wasn't subtley re- I
ferring to the most desirable Stanford Activity when the Handbook
i claimed "We have attempted to make all activities so appealing and
desirable that participation is desired" and "Many of the activities
carry over skills which cannot be found in any other part of the
Physical Education Program."
Warren finally became adjusted to University life and the initial
shock which college provided after high school, and he thought he
would find his niche in softball. He was beginning to relate.
The day of the big first game came, and Warren didn't want to
get up. It was nine o'clock Saturday morning. He managed to crawl
out of bed and mount his bike and headed in the general direction
of the Stadium where field swg-58 was supposed to be.
Warren Lost
Warren was d —— d if he could find that field. It took him two
hours. Luckily, the umpire was just showing up and he showed War- j
ren the way. The umpire had no shirt on, and had such a headache i
he could hardly speak. Ho was what the Handbook called "competent
' supervision."
The umpire took down everybody's name to make sure no one was i
playing under an assumed name or was a professional and made
; sure neither learn was late.
Warren was the first to the plate. The pitcher look a slow motion :
! and lobbed the ball in a soaring parbola. Warren was patiently
counting to ten when he suddenly discovered that it was not a j
; softball at all that was coming at him but a huge 8 inch cantaloupe!
It was a shocking experience for Warren. He couldn't relate for |
i weeks. The only therapy he found for feeling at home again in his i
Living Group was to organize wrestling matches in the hallway at 1
; Wilbur. He became the Wilbur Champ.

The handbook featured a picture of Chuck Taylor. Warren re- I
| membered that as the name he found written on the back of his 1
tennis shoes. His excitement mounted.
Warren read the list of offerings: Bowling, Pocket Billiards, Bas
ketball Free Throws, Table Tennis, Horseshoes. Such things as Touch
j Football and Basketball were thrown in just in case someone might
I want them.
You can imagine how excited Warren was then. He didn't want to '
case aspersion on anybody or anything, but he did wonder a bit
i whether this fare might just make him a little more "well-rounded" I
: than he was wanting to be.
Warren Reflects
Warren reflected for a while and decided that perhaps these
activities reflected the claim that the booklet made that "It is the
primary purpose of the Intramural program to provide every
student in Stanford University the opportunity to compete and par-
I ticipate in an athletic or recreational activity of his desire."
But Warren rejected a little more and decided that what he ob-:
served empirically during Pie-Reg was that this list did not include'
that activity which for most students was the "Activity of his de-1
sire." Warren wondered if the athletic department wasn't subtley re- I
ferring to the most desirable Stanford Activity when the Handbook
i claimed "We have attempted to make all activities so appealing and
desirable that participation is desired" and "Many of the activities
carry over skills which cannot be found in any other part of the
Physical Education Program."
Warren finally became adjusted to University life and the initial
shock which college provided after high school, and he thought he
would find his niche in softball. He was beginning to relate.
The day of the big first game came, and Warren didn't want to
get up. It was nine o'clock Saturday morning. He managed to crawl
out of bed and mount his bike and headed in the general direction
of the Stadium where field swg-58 was supposed to be.
Warren Lost
Warren was d —— d if he could find that field. It took him two
hours. Luckily, the umpire was just showing up and he showed War- j
ren the way. The umpire had no shirt on, and had such a headache i
he could hardly speak. Ho was what the Handbook called "competent
' supervision."
The umpire took down everybody's name to make sure no one was i
playing under an assumed name or was a professional and made
; sure neither learn was late.
Warren was the first to the plate. The pitcher look a slow motion :
! and lobbed the ball in a soaring parbola. Warren was patiently
counting to ten when he suddenly discovered that it was not a j
; softball at all that was coming at him but a huge 8 inch cantaloupe!
It was a shocking experience for Warren. He couldn't relate for |
i weeks. The only therapy he found for feeling at home again in his i
Living Group was to organize wrestling matches in the hallway at 1
; Wilbur. He became the Wilbur Champ.
The story has been told and documented many times about how

Warren was a jock in High School. He lettered in football, basket- j

would find his niche in softball. He was beginning to relate.
The day of the big first game came, and Warren didn't want to
get up. It was nine o'clock Saturday morning. He managed to crawl
out of bed and mount his bike and headed in the general direction
of the Stadium where field swg-58 was supposed to be.
Warren Lost
Warren was d —— d if he could find that field. It took him two
hours. Luckily, the umpire was just showing up and he showed War- j
ren the way. The umpire had no shirt on, and had such a headache i
he could hardly speak. Ho was what the Handbook called "competent
' supervision."
The umpire took down everybody's name to make sure no one was i
playing under an assumed name or was a professional and made
; sure neither learn was late.
Warren was the first to the plate. The pitcher look a slow motion :
! and lobbed the ball in a soaring parbola. Warren was patiently
counting to ten when he suddenly discovered that it was not a j
; softball at all that was coming at him but a huge 8 inch cantaloupe!
It was a shocking experience for Warren. He couldn't relate for |
i weeks. The only therapy he found for feeling at home again in his i
Living Group was to organize wrestling matches in the hallway at 1
; Wilbur. He became the Wilbur Champ.
