## Watkins Report: Cheers and Jeers 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The most honored and respected
Mr. Suffel seems to place himself
on a mysterious pedestal. For
who is he to judge the "vicious
attack on Dr. Watkins" as "more
innuendo and name-calling than
proof or logic?"
It seems that Mr. Suffel is
merely acting—to a degree—in
the same vein as was Dr. Watkins
- criticism and attack from a
somewhat narrow-minded, distort
ed perspective—followed by ab
solutely no supporting facts for
his rebuttal.
The source of the "alleged"
rumors have not yet been veri
fied; but if Mr. Suffel possesses
powers by which to ascertain the
source, I am sure the campus
would find it most interesting.
Furthermore, it is impossible
for Professor Watkins to remain
"out of it from here on." since it
was liis self-authorized participa
tion in the recent elections which
initiated this sorrowful contro
versy. He is very much in it
whether aware of it or not.
And if The Daily coverage
seems "one-sided" to Dr. McAfee
Brown, it is only because Dr.
Watkins remains mute, offering
"no comment"; his side seems to
come from naive fans that ap
parently know nothing or very
little about the situation.
In addition, a comparable of-1
fort has been made to let Dr. !
Watkins "give his side of the;
story directly"; yet he declines! j
Why? |
I, too, await Dr. Watkins' clari 112
fication.

• New Low
Editor, Tlie Daily:
Your "editorial" of May 18 \
represented a new low in Daily
journalism. It appears that this;
mileposl was made possible only
by you and your echo, Mr. Bris-1
coe, combining your talents to the |
end of more perverse "rumor- :
mongering, and obfuscation of j
facts."
I was present when one of Dave 1
Bobbins' supporters came into
Dave's campaign headquarters j
with a hazy report of a Mackenzie- j
Lowenstein deal. I replied that it ,
sounded ridiculous. Robbins was
present and immediately and cate
gorically forbid his supporters to
spread the story pending its verifi
cation. Since verification was not
forthcoming, this edict stood
throughout the campaign. No one
that I know of in the Robbins
camp gave the story any real
credulity.

In your editorial you state that
Dr. James T. Watkins spread
the Lowenstein rumor, but with
one exception you fail to mention ,
when or to whom. He never men- j
tloned this matter in the class
room, at the I.F.C. meeting refer
red to in your article, or at any
other time 1 know of. The only
place you note Dr. Watkins* hav
ing referred to the rumor is at a
small gathering at the home of
Mr. Pierce. Is a person of Dr.
Watkins* stature, or for that mat
ter any member of the Stanford
community, to be so viciously
condemned for casually discussing
among friends (Mr. Anderson ex
cluded) a story he has heard?
Miss Stel'fen, your approach to
this matter wreaks of McCarthy
ism. From now on are all Stanford
students and faculty members to
speak guardedly at all times for
fear a Daily informer may be
listening, waiting for some slip
which can be smeared across the
so-called editorial page? Are we
to be cowed from taking stands
not favorable to The Daily staff
for fear of being irresponsibly
slandered? If such is to be the
case, Stanford has reached a low
point in its history.

Editor's Note: The Daily Report
! made no mention of the rumor
being spread either in the IPC
1 meeting or in the classroom.
• Inept
"Editor, The Daily:
Coming at a time when pro-j
; posals to allow faculty members j
to vote in students elections are
circulating, your editorial on Pro
| fessor Watkins' role in there- j
| cent student elections was, as a|
piece of political commentary,j
certainly inept. As a personal at- j
■ tack on Watkins, it was revenge-1
ful, flimsy and short-sighted.
Of all the members on the fac-;
I ulty I can hardly think of one
| who has consistently, diligently I
| and responsibly given more of his
| time, advice and energies to as j
1 many individual students and stu- j
dent organizations as Watkins j
j has. He has become an expert
j on Stanford's student affairs,
j These personal efforts have be
i come legendary. There is no rea
son why he, or any other faculty
member, should not participate in
the electoral process; we are all
part of the same community.
Those students who wish to play
at student government and pol
itics must learn that all sources
of political power are equally legit- j
imate. Those who wish to attack '

Watkins personally must learn
that innuendo won't do the trick.

• Guilty
Editor, The Daily:
Isn't it a bit ironical that some
of those who seem to he the most
concerned with the individual
rights of the Negro in Mississippi
or of the student on the Stanford
campus apparently feel free to
trample on the human rights of a
member of the Stanford faculty?
The sweeping charges of Tues
day's editorial amount to little
more than guilt by insinuation.
Perhaps it is The Daily and not
Professor Watkins who is the
most guilty of toying with the
truth.

• Horner Speech
Editor, The Daily:
One wonders if Mr. Horner of
the State department understands
why his speech on Monday drew
so little applause, whereas Pro
fessor Morgenthau got a standing
ovation for his. I doubt there can
be much meaningful communica
tion between university commun
ities and Washington if the State :
department shrugs this sort of I
thing off as a rigged job, a one-1
sided public.
Doubtless, some in the audience
had come to jeer Mr. Horner and
cheer his critics regardless of;
what they might say. Also. 11
should not doubt that in that j
huge hall overflowing with people l
there may have been a "leftist" or |
two. Perhaps even worse. I can't [
speak for the whole crowd, but Ii
do think Mr. Rusk should know
that a good many of us rose to j
cheei' Mr. Morgenthau as a tribute i
to a display of scholarly compe-:
tenee, intelligence, and. above all. j
perhaps, in appreciation of his in-;
tellectual integrity, the total ab-1
sence of condescension in his I
manner, in a word, his good faith j
all qualities we have some ac i
quaintance with and some compe-;
tence to recognize.
The applause was also implicit-1
ly a reproach to Mi-. Horner.:
whose incredible little script j
lacked all those qualities most
conspicuouly and enabled many
to see all too clearly how much
Mr. Rusk really does believe in
our gullibility. One is, I think,
entitled to question the intelli
gence and capacity of judgment
of the leadership of the State de
partment when they seriously
imagine that they are effectively
defending their policies with a!

presentation that would insult the
intelligence of a child.
Professor Scalapino did not
make that mistake; neither did
Chalmers Johnson. Their public
heard their remarks critically, but
respected them and did not boo
or laugh.. Mr. Horner alone seems
to have visited some thirty-odd
campuses and there may be many
more ahead of him. Can one cal
culate the damage these visits are
inflicting on the already tottering
prestige of the State Department?
Were I an academic defender of
the government's policy, I should
be begging Mr. Rusk on bended
knees not to help me this way any
more. Need I also say that, if
State is capable of underestimat
ing so seriously the level of intel
lectual discourse at Stanford, it
may well be misjudging the situa
tion elsewhere, to put things very
mildly indeed?
Or, to put things bluntly, I be
lieve we have witnessed a char
acteristic example of State De
partment blundering. Is there
time for the State Department to
acquire the wisdom of which, in
my opinion, at least, they are
truly desperately in need?

• Hardly Academic
Editor, The Daily:
Despite the accolades for Mr.
Horner and more particularly for
Professor Morgenthau during
their debate in Mem. Aud. Mon
day evening, I believe it con
structive to suggest that neither
speaker confronted three aspects
of the Viet Nam situation which
surely arc central to it.
1. The implications for UJ3. pol
icy of a revolutionary movement
that combines both the legitimate
nationalist aspirations of a poo
pie seeking a better life and the
strong likelihood of a Commu
nist conclusion should that rev
olution triumph;
2. The implications of a Com
munist victory in South Viet Nam
for the security and independence
of other non-Communist coun
tries from Cambodia and Laos to
Burma and Nepal and from
Thailand down the peninsula to
Malaysia and extending even to
the Philippines;
3. The value or credibility of
American commitments to the de
fense of other exposed countries
(for example Thailand) should
we prove ourselves unable or un
willing to contend wilh the sub
version and terrorism plaguing
Viet Nam.
These questions are hardly aca
demic. They lie at the heart of
any U.S. decision to continue or
changc the nature of its involve
ment in Viet Nam. One wonders
why it is that learned specialists
passed over them with such
abandon.

• Teach-in
Editor, The Daily:
Wo would like to offer a vote
of thanks to the Stanford faculty,
the students, and the speakers
who made possible the Stanford
Viet Nam "Teach-In." Although
we ourselves have many criti
cisms of our country's present
policies, we were espec i a 11 y
pleased by the good job done in
presenting speakers who covered
a wide range of thought and opin
ion on the subject, making possi
ble a genuine "Teach-In" instead
of just another anti-government
panegyric.

We were also pleased to note !
that, on the whole, the deport
ment of the students in atten
dance spoke well for a truly dem
ocratic willingness to listen to
and to consider the merits of all
points of view—something which
cannot be said of the hysteria
generated at similar programs in
other institutions.
In short, we were proud of Stan
ford, and we sincerely hope that
the interest and concern demon
strated on Monday will be a last
ing phenomenon on this campus.

• If Not Us, Who >
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Williamson seems to com
pletely miss the point of the
teach-in in his criticism of our
examination of our government's
actions. He seems to believe that
if we criticize our government !
for acts of violence, we must
actively deplore every aggressive
act. The point missed is that first,
its our government that is doing |
the questionable things this time, i
and second, our government is
quite adequate at pointing out the
sins of others.
But who will criticize Washing- \
ton if we don't, when the dif
ference between our acts and the
acts of those Washington critics
become less and less apparent?
Should we abdicate our duty
as citizens under a system that
preaches participation to Charles!
de Gaulle or some other foreign
leader, who in his position can
criticize us and still be patriotic?

• ICC Dispute
Editor, The. Daily:
Having served as an appointed
officer of ihe Inter-Club Coun
cil for the past two years, I find
the comments of Messrs. Snively
and Smith disheartening and in
correct. 11l feelings at the out
come of any election are under
standable. However, public airing
of grievances without sufficient
information for enlightened com- j
ment is unjustified—especially as
the matter does not concern the
university at large. The simple;
truth is that the I.C.C. did dis
cover a technical irregularity j
after the election, and, in the in |
terest of justice to all the candi- j
dates, decided that the election I
should be re-run.
As to the other allegations
against the 1.C.C., I would recom-|
mend that Messrs. Snively and
Smith: (1) read the I.C.C. consti
tution and, (2> discuss its function
with our President, Jan Peterson,
or with myself.
Further, as the officer charged
with supervising the financial and
legal affairs of the clubs and of
formulating any and all recom
mendations to the I.C.C. for inter
vention in the affairs of any club,
I am deeply disturbed th a t
Messrs. Snively and Smith have
felt impelled to give credence to
an UNFOUNDED rumor about
the "closing of certain clubs." I
have made no such decision. When
and if such a decision EVER is
made, I am confident that I. ;
or whoever holds my office, will
be competent to speak for him
self.
