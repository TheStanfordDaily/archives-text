# Student Editors To Publish Civil Rights Paper in South
## 
### 
A group of student editors in
the Harvard University commun
ity plans to establish an inde
pendent newspaper to report
civil rights activities in the
South, according to the New
York Times.
The nucleus of the group is
from Harvard, but volunteers

i from Smith, Amherst and Brown
have also applied.
The paper, "The Southern Cour
ier," will begin operations in June.
The Times said there will he five
weekly editions, one each in Ala
bama, Georgia, South Carolina,
Mississippi and Louisiana.
The project has the support of
two Harvard faculty advisers.
Richard Cotton, a former presi
dent of Harvard Crimson, the
i university newspaper, will man
age the paper, and other staff
members, states The Times, "have
!wor k e d in voter-registration
! drives in Mississippi and as report
crs for The Crimson in the recent
crisis in Alabama."
Peter Cummings, a staff mem
ber, said, "We would like to see
some veteran newspaper people
j come down to help us. We can't
afford to pay them anything like
what they make now. of course,
but it would be a sort of Peace
Corps idea, with these people giv
! ing up. say, a year."
'The Courier' will'be particular-
I ly interested in students who are
(willing to give up a year of col
lege to work on the paper," Cum
| mings added.
A prospectus mailed to possible
, sources of support says,"It is our
hope that we can have more thor
ough coverage and wider eircula
tion than the few Southern papers
1 which now report racial news ac-
I euratelv. Of course, we will also
[carry local news, national and in
ternational reports, sports, and
J other features ol a regular news
