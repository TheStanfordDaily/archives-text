# TEACH AND ACT PROGRAM
## Theater Troupe in Residence 
### JAN IE ARIES 
For Stephen Baffrey, Director
of the Summer Festivals at Stan
ford, the establishment here next
fall of a professional repertory
theatre to present plays and
teach is still a dream which it is
hard to believe came true.
The company, consisting of di
rector Peter Vos and nine profes
sional actors, will participate in
a new graduate program leading
to a Master of Fine Arts degree
in Drama.
The company will be teaching
in the Socratic method by giving
classes and having students act
in its plays. "If the students
couldn't work in the company,
we would have no business start-!
ing it here," Baffrey commented.;
"This is the first place this kind:
of program has been done, t h'e
first professional acting company
on a campus where there is a (
direct tie between teaching and

[ performing."
The program came about "since i
Suptnik went up, there was a
a monterous change to the sci
ences. Humanities began to take
a back seat."
Rockefeller Grants
The inspiration for a profes-1
sional theatre on campus came!
from Dr. Robert Lopez of the
Drama Department to "allow the
department to do a better job."
The company is being estab
lished by a $300,000 grant from
the Rockefeller Foundation, giv
en over three years, which will
pay for the director and nine
professional actors.
Stanford is contributing an ad-
J ditional $120,000 a year for ad- !
| ministrative expenses. The prof
its at the box office will help de
i fray some of the costs, but the
! theatre is not expected to become
I self supporting. Because of this, |
it will "never have to adjust its!
I artistic level to the box office."
! according to Baffrey, which is}
the problem with commercial J
theatre.
"Eventually there is to come a
I new theatre," stated Baffrey.!
I "Now, however, th e r e is a
i squeeze on space in Mem Aud." 1
J and Rams Head's use of it will j
| thus be restricted.
"To force the professional com
: pany into a screwy schedule" in >
order lo work around Rams Head 1
means the company "could be'
seriously hampered at the out-1
set," he believes.
Spring Show
The only conflict between the
schedules of Ram's Head and the!
j professional company is at the;
time of Spring Show, which can-1
not be given in Mem Aud. Hence,
' next year it will not be a big!
j musical, but possibly an original j
| production, according to Ed Blair,
| head of Ram's Head this year.
"Ram's Head felt, at one time
it had been delivered an ultima-1
j turn to get out," observed Baffrey.;
j "They have been asked to step j
aside in some respects to help us. 1
; but. we all feel very close to]
; Ram's Head. The benefits are so
; obvious, though, that Ram's Head
j can't help but gain." he added.
! Ed Blair agreed that "a general
advance of drama at Stanford)
I would help Ram's Head. Ram's |
i Head next year is of its own ac-
I cord giving up Mem Aud to help
the repertory theatre establish
! itself. In future years, however,
Ram's Head will l>c able to move
j back to the main stage. We have
i no intention of changing."
Ham's Head will remain the
main independent undergraduale
drama group and the Stanford
I Players will remain the produc
ing arm of the Drama Depart
ment.
"If the professional theatre sue
rrorl* here," concluded Baffrey, I

"you will find it happening across
the country. The company on
campus serves the Drama De
partment, but it is an expensive
teaching device alone. We should
be important in that larger con
centric circle which is the outside
world."
