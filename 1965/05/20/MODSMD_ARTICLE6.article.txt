# Mem Mess
## 
### 
No, this isn't North Viet Nam.
Actually located on our beloved
campus next to Mem Aud, fac
ing Mem Claw, and across the
street from Mem Tow sprawls
this latest addition to the me
morial fellowship â€” affection
ately labeled Mem Mess. When
completed sometime in the
twentieth century, Mem Mess
can be expected to equal, and
even surpass, the architectural
splendor of such monuments as
Stern, Wilbur, and the Lake Lag
Boathouse. At that moment in
history the sign outside Mem
Mess will read, "Graduate
School of Business."
