The internationally famous Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute stands un
equivocally behind this offer. We want to make it clear, however that this is our
minimum expectation. Most graduates far exceed 3 times their starting rate. The
best way to prove to yourself that you, too, can at least triple your reading speed
is to see an actual demonstration.
• You will see a Reading Dynamics graduate read from a book he has never seen
before ... at a rate far exceeding 1000 words per minute . . . and then tell in
detail what he has read.
• You will see a documented film that includes actual interviews with Washington
Senators who have taken the course.
• You will learn how Reading Dynamics can show you the way to faster reading,
improved comprehension, greater recall.
• You will have a chance to win a full scholarship, absolutely free .
HOW IS Tim POSSIBLE?
Eighteen years ago Evelyn Wood, a Utah schoolteacher, made a startling discovery
that led to the founding of Reading Dynamics. While working toward master's
degree, she handed a term paper to a professor and watched him read the 80
pages at 6,000 words per minute—with outstanding recall and comprehension.
Determined lo find the secret behind such rapid reading, she spent the next two
years tracking down 50 people who could read faster than 1,500 words per minute.
She studied their techniques, taught herself to read at these faster rates. Now,
after years of experience in public schools and universities, she has made it possible
for you to benefit from this great discovery.
IS IT SIMPLY A PROMOTION STSSKT?
About Reading Dynamics' impact on our nation's legislators, Time Magazine said
"Washington has seen nothing like it since the days when Teddy Roosevelt read
three books a day and ran the country at the same time."

KOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER COURSES?
Conventional rapid reading courses aspire to 450-600 words per minute. Most
Reading Dynamics graduates can read between 1,500 and 3,000 words per minute,
and many go even higher.
