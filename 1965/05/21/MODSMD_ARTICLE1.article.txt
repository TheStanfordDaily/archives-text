South Viet Nam" or face more disastrous consequences.
• Junta Position Outlined
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic—Gen. An
tonio Imbert Barrera, head of the civilian-military
junta, said yesterday a permanent cease-fire is out of
the question and his troops soon will attack the rebels'
stronghold in downtown Santo Domingo.
Imbert's declaration was the junta's first public

statement of its plan of action to end the Dominican
rebellion.
Imbert hinted that the attack would come next
week, as soon as Dominican tanks and troops take the
northern sections of the capital.
The official U.S. position is one of neutrality in the
struggle between the junta and the rebels.
The rebels, however, charge that U.S. troops have
been helping junta forces in the bloody house-to-house
battle for the northern part of the city. U.S. military
spokesmen say that 14 paratroopers have been as
signed to the junta army to prevent tanks and light
artillery from firing into nearby U.S. lines. They say
there has been no other cooperation.

• Junta Position Outlined
SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic—Gen. An
tonio Imbert Barrera, head of the civilian-military
junta, said yesterday a permanent cease-fire is out of
the question and his troops soon will attack the rebels'
stronghold in downtown Santo Domingo.
Imbert's declaration was the junta's first public

statement of its plan of action to end the Dominican
rebellion.
Imbert hinted that the attack would come next
week, as soon as Dominican tanks and troops take the
northern sections of the capital.
The official U.S. position is one of neutrality in the
struggle between the junta and the rebels.
The rebels, however, charge that U.S. troops have
been helping junta forces in the bloody house-to-house
battle for the northern part of the city. U.S. military
spokesmen say that 14 paratroopers have been as
signed to the junta army to prevent tanks and light
artillery from firing into nearby U.S. lines. They say
there has been no other cooperation.
