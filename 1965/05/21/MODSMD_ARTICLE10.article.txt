"Were bringing up larger and larger numbers of children con
vinced that the United States has adversaries willing to destroy us.
declared Dr. Benjamin Spock, well-known author of The Common
Sense Hook of Baby and Child Care, in a speech in Memorial Audi
torium last night.
"These children are going to be capable of turning against their

fellow men to an ox tent that'
would make McCarthyism look
minor."
Spook, addressing a largo, at
tentat ivo audience on 'Our Youth
in a Nuclear Age," explained
that, as a psychiatrist and pedia
trician. he feels American par
ents today are filling their chil
dren with anxieties that are
detrimental both to their well
being and to their future effec
tiveness as members of society.
To stem this trend, Spook sug
gested that parents:
® "Give their children a bal
•ineed view of what's going on in
the world" by presenting the in
ternational situation "in the least
alarmist way possible";
o Explain the operations of the
United Nations to their children;
• Explain to their children "the
difference between firmness and
belligerence," both in their own
re! tionships and in the conduct
of U.S. foreign policy. "Friendli
ness generates friendliness,t rust
generates trust, belligerence al
wa y s provokes belligerence,"
