TESTS, AND HOW THEY GREW
Just the other night I was saying to the little woman, "Do
you think the importance of tests in American colleges is
being overemphasized?". (Incidentally, the little woman is
not, as you might think, my wife. My wife is far from a lit
tle woman. She is, in fact, nearly seven feet high and man
tled with rippling muscles. She is a full-blooded Ogallala
Sioux and holds the world's shot put record. The little
woman 1 referred to is someone we found crouching under
the sofa when we moved into our apartment back in 1928,
and there she has remained ever since. She never speaks
except to make a kind of guttural clicking sound when she
is hungry. To tell you the truth, she's not too much fun to
have around t he house, but with my wife away at track meets
most of the time, at least it gives me someone to talk to.)
But I digress. "Do you think the importance of tests in
American colleges is being overemphasized?" I said the
other night to the little woman, and then I said, "Yes,
Max, 1 do think the importance of tests in American col
leges is being overemphasized." (As 1 explained, the little
woman does not speak, so when we have conversations, I
am forced to do both parts.)
But 1 digress. To get back to tests —sure, they're impor
tant, but let's not allow them to get too important. There
are, after all, many talents which simply can't be measured
by quizzes. Is it right to penalize a gifted student whose
gifts don't happen to fall into an academic category? Like,
for instance, Finster Sigafoos?
r

Finster, a freshman at the Wyoming College of Belles
Lettres and Fingerprint Identification, has never passed a
single test ; yet all who know him agree he is studded with
talent like a ham with cloves. He can, for example, sleep
standing up. He can do a perfect imitation of a scarlet tan
ager. (1 don't mean just the bird calls; I mean he can fly
south in the winter.) He can pick up BB's with his toes. He
can say "toy boat" three times fast. He can build a rude
telephone out of 100 yards of string and two empty Person
na Stainless Steel Razor Blade packages. (This last accom
plishment is the one Finster is proudest of—not building
the telephone but emptying the Personna packs. To empty
a Personna pack is not easily accomplished, believe you me,
not if you're a person who likes to get full value out of his
razor blades. And full value is just what Personnas deliver.
They last and last and keep on lasting; luxury shave follows
luxury shave in numbers that make the mind boggle. Why
don't you see for yourself? Personnas are now available in
two varieties: a brand-new stainless steel injector blade for
users of injector razors—and the familiar double-edge stain
less steel blade so dear to the hearts and kind to the kissers
of so many happy Americans, blades so smooth-shaving, so
long-lasting that the Personna Co. makes the following
guarantee: If you don't agree Personna gives you more lux
ury shaves than Beep-Beep or any other brand you might
name, Personna will buy you a pack of whatever kind you
think is better.)
But I digress. Back to Finster Sigafoos—artist, humanist,
philosopher, and freshman since 1939. Will the world ever
benefit from Finster's great gifts? Alas, no. He is in college
to stay.
But even more tragic for mankind is the case of Clare de
Loon. Clare, a classmate of Finster's, had no talent, no
gifts, no brains, no personality. All she had was a knack for
taking tests. She would cram like mad before a test, always
get a perfect score, and then promptly forget everything
she had learned. Naturally, she graduated with highest
honors and degrees by the dozen, but the sad fact is that
she left college no more educated and no more prepared to
cope with the world than she was when she entered. Today,
a broken woman, she crouches under my sofa.

Speaking of tests, ive, the makers of Personna*, put
our blades through an impressive number before ice
send them to market. We also make—and thoroughly
test—an aerosol shave that soaks rings around any
other lather: liurma Shave' , regular and menthol.

But 1 digress. To get back to tests —sure, they're impor

are, after all, many talents which simply can't be measured
by quizzes. Is it right to penalize a gifted student whose

for instance, Finster Sigafoos?
r

Finster, a freshman at the Wyoming College of Belles
Lettres and Fingerprint Identification, has never passed a
single test ; yet all who know him agree he is studded with
talent like a ham with cloves. He can, for example, sleep
standing up. He can do a perfect imitation of a scarlet tan
ager. (1 don't mean just the bird calls; I mean he can fly
south in the winter.) He can pick up BB's with his toes. He
can say "toy boat" three times fast. He can build a rude
telephone out of 100 yards of string and two empty Person
na Stainless Steel Razor Blade packages. (This last accom
plishment is the one Finster is proudest of—not building
the telephone but emptying the Personna packs. To empty
a Personna pack is not easily accomplished, believe you me,
not if you're a person who likes to get full value out of his
razor blades. And full value is just what Personnas deliver.
They last and last and keep on lasting; luxury shave follows
luxury shave in numbers that make the mind boggle. Why
don't you see for yourself? Personnas are now available in
two varieties: a brand-new stainless steel injector blade for
users of injector razors—and the familiar double-edge stain
less steel blade so dear to the hearts and kind to the kissers
of so many happy Americans, blades so smooth-shaving, so
long-lasting that the Personna Co. makes the following
guarantee: If you don't agree Personna gives you more lux
ury shaves than Beep-Beep or any other brand you might
name, Personna will buy you a pack of whatever kind you
think is better.)
But I digress. Back to Finster Sigafoos—artist, humanist,
philosopher, and freshman since 1939. Will the world ever
benefit from Finster's great gifts? Alas, no. He is in college
to stay.
But even more tragic for mankind is the case of Clare de
Loon. Clare, a classmate of Finster's, had no talent, no
gifts, no brains, no personality. All she had was a knack for
taking tests. She would cram like mad before a test, always
get a perfect score, and then promptly forget everything
she had learned. Naturally, she graduated with highest
honors and degrees by the dozen, but the sad fact is that
she left college no more educated and no more prepared to
cope with the world than she was when she entered. Today,
a broken woman, she crouches under my sofa.

Speaking of tests, ive, the makers of Personna*, put
our blades through an impressive number before ice
send them to market. We also make—and thoroughly
test—an aerosol shave that soaks rings around any
other lather: liurma Shave' , regular and menthol.

TESTS, AND HOW THEY GREW
Just the other night I was saying to the little woman, "Do
you think the importance of tests in American colleges is
being overemphasized?". (Incidentally, the little woman is
not, as you might think, my wife. My wife is far from a lit
tle woman. She is, in fact, nearly seven feet high and man
tled with rippling muscles. She is a full-blooded Ogallala
Sioux and holds the world's shot put record. The little
woman 1 referred to is someone we found crouching under
the sofa when we moved into our apartment back in 1928,
and there she has remained ever since. She never speaks
except to make a kind of guttural clicking sound when she
is hungry. To tell you the truth, she's not too much fun to
have around t he house, but with my wife away at track meets
most of the time, at least it gives me someone to talk to.)
But I digress. "Do you think the importance of tests in
American colleges is being overemphasized?" I said the

They last and last and keep on lasting; luxury shave follows
luxury shave in numbers that make the mind boggle. Why
don't you see for yourself? Personnas are now available in
two varieties: a brand-new stainless steel injector blade for
users of injector razors—and the familiar double-edge stain
less steel blade so dear to the hearts and kind to the kissers
of so many happy Americans, blades so smooth-shaving, so
long-lasting that the Personna Co. makes the following
guarantee: If you don't agree Personna gives you more lux
ury shaves than Beep-Beep or any other brand you might
name, Personna will buy you a pack of whatever kind you
think is better.)
But I digress. Back to Finster Sigafoos—artist, humanist,
philosopher, and freshman since 1939. Will the world ever
benefit from Finster's great gifts? Alas, no. He is in college
to stay.
But even more tragic for mankind is the case of Clare de
Loon. Clare, a classmate of Finster's, had no talent, no
gifts, no brains, no personality. All she had was a knack for
taking tests. She would cram like mad before a test, always
get a perfect score, and then promptly forget everything
she had learned. Naturally, she graduated with highest
honors and degrees by the dozen, but the sad fact is that
she left college no more educated and no more prepared to
cope with the world than she was when she entered. Today,
a broken woman, she crouches under my sofa.

Speaking of tests, ive, the makers of Personna*, put
our blades through an impressive number before ice
send them to market. We also make—and thoroughly
test—an aerosol shave that soaks rings around any
other lather: liurma Shave' , regular and menthol.
