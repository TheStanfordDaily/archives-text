# 'The Americanization of Emily' A Unique and Provocative Film
## 
### JOSEPH JACOBS Fine Arts Editor 
In spite of what the recorded
voice over the Paris' telephone
says,"The Americanization of
Emily" is NOT "the warm and
tender story of an American
officer and a British girl."
And it is not, as one might as
sume from its title, the story of
a girl named Emily who comes
to the United States and learns
American ways.
It is, rather, a very funny and
yet very serious film about war,
heroism, principle, love, cowardice
and morality. It is not a comedy,
a love story or a war story and
yet it includes all of these.
Extremely Good
It is, most importantly, a
uniquely satiric and extremely
good film; if it must be compared
with another film, one could say
it is similar to "Dr. Strangelove."
"Emily" is the story of Charlie
Madison, dog-robber for an Amer
ican admiral in England in the

spring of 1944. (It is a dog-rob
ber's job to "keep his general or
admiral well-fed, well-clothed and
well-loved." Charlie, whose "ad
miral sets the best table in the
European theater of operations,"
is renowned for the clothes, li
quor, perfume, candy and other
luxuries he stores in his room—
"the swankiest shop in town.")
Charlie's driver is Emily, an
aloof young British widow whose
husband went off to war three
days after their marriage and
never returned. "I don't want to
feel tender toward anyone," she
claims. "I don't want any more
doomed meii."
Instant Dislike
She and Charlie dislike each
other immediately. "You Ameri
cans are really enjoying this war,
aren't you?" she asks bitterly
after seeing some of his supplies.
He replies by telling her to stop
blaming everything on the Ameri
cans: "Europe was a going brothel
long before we got here."
But Emily finds Charlie's charm
irresistible and, after pleading
that he not "show me how profit
able it would be to fall in love
with you—don't Americanize me,"
she promptly does fall in love.
Through an extremely complex
series of events Charlie winds up
a hero in the invasion of Norm
andy and, on his return, finds
Emily completely "Americanized."
This sketchy plot summary can
not possibly capture the wit and
style with which Paddy Cheyef
sky has written his screenplay,
nor can it give any indication of
the excellent work of director
Arthur Hiller, composer Johnny

Mandcl and cameraman Phillip
Lathrop.
Splendid Cast
In addition, their work has
been bolstered by a truly splendid
cast.
As Charlie, who preaches that
"cowardice will save the world,"
James Garner is the archtypical
conman. Whether explaining his
philosophy of living only for the
present—"l don't want to know
what's good or bad or true; I let
God worry about the truth"—or
looking up at the moon that, by
its failure to appear the night be
fore, has made him an unwilling
part of the Normandy invasion
and bellowing "How could you do
this to me?" he gives the best
performance of his career.
Julie Andrews, in the first non
musical role of her life as the
"grotesquely sentimental" Emily,
proves conclusively that she can
do far more than play governesses
who go around singing all the
time. She manages to make
Emily's "Americanization" totally
believable, which is no mean ac
complishment.
The supporting cast, headed by
Melvin Douglas as a mentally
unbalanced admiral and James
Coburn as Charlie's high-living,
Annapolis graduate cohort, is out
standing. Especially notable also
is Joyce Grenfell as Emily's moth
er—her scene with Garner and
Miss Andrews is tremendously
touching.
"The Americanization of Emily"
—although at times inconsistent
in its point of view—is a fre
quently sentimental, often hilari
ous and ironic but continually
provocative movie.
