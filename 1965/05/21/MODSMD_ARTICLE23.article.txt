Graduation time is fast ap
proaching, and with it frequently
j come requests from friends and
j relatives for gift suggestions.
I Since records are easily obtain
| able and not too expensive, they
i make ideal gifts.
Here, then, are some comments
on current records all somehow
; related to the entertainment field
which would make worthwhile
additions to anyone's record li
j brary:
The Sound of Music, the last
Rodgers and Hammerstein musi
cal, is available on several rec
ords. The best of these to my taste
is the sound track album (RCA
Victor). Its main advantage is the
voice of Hollywood's brightest
young star, Julie Andrews (see
review on page 4), in the lead
; role of Maria. Her pure soprano
! is unfailingly beautiful, and her
1 high B at the end of "Do Re Mi"
is breathtaking. Irwin Kostal's ar
rangements, particularly on the
Overture, are extremely good.
The Trapp Family Singers,
| about whom "The Sound of Mu
sic" was written, have come out
with their own arrangement (by
Franz Wasner) of songs from the
show (Warner Bros.). Many of
the songs sound like carols and
hymns, but there is enough
bounce and charm to make this
album a happy and refreshing ad
j dition.
My Name is Barbra is Barbra
Streisand's most recent album
(Columbia). Most of the songs,
arranged and conducted by Peter
I Matz, are from her recent—and
j superb—television show. Especial
! ly outstanding are a pair of num
bers she sings while acting like
i a child "I'm Five" and "Sweet
j Zoo." Interesting are a pair of
numbers "My Pa" and "Why Did
| I Choose You?" from the forth
coming musical based on Marjorie
| Kinnan Rawlings' "The Yearling."
The album's high point, however,
is Miss Streisand's rendition of
My Man," which was Fanny
Brice's theme song. Since "Funny
, Girl," Miss Streisand's current
Broadway hit, is based on the
life of Fanny Briee, this should
please all those who complained
when the song was left out of the
i show .
Mary Pippins is. like 'The
Sound of Music," available in sev
■ eral versions. Here again the best
! is easily the sound track album
(Vista), again because it features
Julie Andrews (in her Oscar win
ning performance). Irwin Kostal's
i arrangements of this score are
i (again) outstanding; among the
I numbers many of them satrixed
in last Sunday's Spring Sing are
; Oscar winning Best Song "Chim
Chim Cheree" and. of course, "Su
; percalifragilisticexpialidocious."
t The Fantasticks is the off-
Broadway show now in its sixth
i year in New York (MGM). This
enchanting score includes such
songs as "Soon It's Gonna Rain,"
! "Much More" and"I Can See It"
(all of which have been recorded
by Barbra Streisand) and "Try to
Remember," which has been sung
i by almost everyone from Harry
Belnfonle to the Kingston Trio.
My Fair Lady is still the cham
| pion of all musicals in almost
every respect (Columbia). Both
the stereo and the mono have Rex
1 Harrison, Stanley Holloway, Rob
ert Coote and the übiquitous Julie
j Andrews in the leads, but the
stereo was made with the British
cast in London almost three years
later, and there are distinct dif
ferences. On either one, however,
j you won't lose. Forget the sound
; track album unless you're a great
I Marni Nixon fan.
