## STANFORD PLAYERS Flawed 'Bacchae' Is Worth It 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
"The Bacchae" was Euripides'
last play, and is probably his
greatest tragedy, mainly because
it deals with Dionysus, the most
J significant figure in all Greek
[mythology. Dionysus, or Bacchus,
lis the god of wine wine which
' makes men mad as well as merry.
But more important, he is the
Christ of the Greek myths. The
I son of Zeus and a mortal, he
j clothes the godhead In a human
j form ("And the Word was mode
flesh, and dwelt among us"). He
| comforts his people, yet lie also
sets father against son, mother
I against daughter.
He enters into the bodies of
those iiis frenzied followers kill
i and devour ("Take, eat: tlr .is my
body"), a living and perpetual
j sacrifice. And he always rises
again, no matter how many times
he is torn, .just as the dead vine
(sends forth new shoots. Through
| him, the Greeks conceived of the
I immortality of the soul.
The Action
Now none of this is really ox
i plicit in the play; bui a knowl
-1 edge of it immeasurably enhances
| one's appreciation of what ac
tually happens, which is this:
I Dionysus, son of Zeus and the
I Theban princess Sernele, comes to
i Thebes to establish his rites, iiis
j aunts have blasphemed him by
saying that Sernele lied about
i Zeus' being his father.
His cousin. Pentheus, now
. King of Thebes, not only refuses
| to recognize him, but trios to im
prison and kill him and his I I
! lowers. However, the fetters come
unloosed and the doors of the
cells are opened in a striking
parallel to God's freeing of St.
Paul ("And suddenly there was a
I great earthquake, so that the
| foundations of the pri-on wore
j shaken: and immediately all the
doors were opened, and everyone's
j bands were loosed").

As a judgment upon them, Di
onysus drives Agave, Pentheus'
mother, and her sisters into a
I drunken frenzy, and then sends
Pentheus (disquised as a woman)
1 to spy on them. Needless to say,
Agave discovers Pentheus, but
| recognizes him only as an in
truder; and so she and her 1 sis
ters tear him limb from limb and
strip the flesh from his body.
lVn( liens' Head
Agave returns to Thebes, brand
i ishing aloft her son's bead, which
she believes is that of a lion.
When she discoveres it is really
her son, she is heartbroken and
j begs forgiveness. Here, however,
| Christ and Bacchus part company;
I for Bacchus, inexorable as Ihe
Fates themselves, sentences them
i all to an awful doom.
They must accept his decree;
■ they can do nothing else. And
the play closes with a gold-
I masked, gold-skinned Dionysus,
°
i stony-eyed and implacable, mag
| nificently glittering even after
the last lay of light has faded
! from the stage.
It is an awesome moment,
i the summit of the tragedy. Un
fortunately, the road leading there
'is a bit uneven, mostly because
I of William Arrowsmith. His
i translation is practically unplay
' able; it does have its moments of
j bitter comedy and virile dialogue,
I but on the whole it is woefully far
j from matching in its language the
grandly austere struggle between
i more-than-human man and lcss
than-human god. What cries for a
j Shakespeare, or at least an Edith
i Hamilton, has not gotten much at
; all.
i nderstatenient
William Sharp's directing is
most effective in the group scenes,
1 where proper arrangement and
i movement are crucial. However,
| the understated rendering for
which he strives is not very exeit
ing and tends to deteriorate into
woodenness.
The rest of the trouble lies
with actors who are forgivably

unequal to their monumental
tasks. The messengers and chorus
report all the action, since none of
it lakes place on stage. Naturally,
then, they must be consummate
masters of their craft, in order to
create between them a compelling
image of what has happened.
Lawrence Madison and John
Wright, the messengers, are just
plain bad. Susan Leich, the chorus
leader, is impressively frenzied
when she speaks alone; but her
followers are awkward and their
words are often lost amid the din
of tambourines and bongo drums.
Bungling Senility
William Louis is too much the
sweet, senile Grandpa Cadmus;
his important speeches get lost
amid his bungling. Faced with an
impossible job, Donald Patterson
as Dionysus nevertheless is often
close to success, but he doesn't
ever quite capture that soft yet
electric sensuousness that is the
god.
Conrad Bishop (Teiresias, the
blind seer i and John Hellweg
(Pentheus) also do quite well; but
it is Norma Edwards as Agave
who gives the most nearly perfect
performance. The play, which has
been fitfully smoldering up until
her entrance near the end, cratches
fire with her first line and burns
brilliantly light through the
moment of aw 112 u 1, implacable
! judgment.
And. in spite of the flaws, it is
a moment well worth waiting for.

Bungling Senility
William Louis is too much the
sweet, senile Grandpa Cadmus;
his important speeches get lost
amid his bungling. Faced with an
impossible job, Donald Patterson
as Dionysus nevertheless is often
close to success, but he doesn't
ever quite capture that soft yet
electric sensuousness that is the
god.
Conrad Bishop (Teiresias, the
blind seer i and John Hellweg
(Pentheus) also do quite well; but
it is Norma Edwards as Agave
who gives the most nearly perfect
performance. The play, which has
been fitfully smoldering up until
her entrance near the end, cratches
fire with her first line and burns
brilliantly light through the
moment of aw 112 u 1, implacable
! judgment.
And. in spite of the flaws, it is
a moment well worth waiting for.
"The Bacchae" was Euripides'
last play, and is probably his
greatest tragedy, mainly because
it deals with Dionysus, the most
J significant figure in all Greek
[mythology. Dionysus, or Bacchus,
lis the god of wine wine which
' makes men mad as well as merry.
But more important, he is the
Christ of the Greek myths. The
I son of Zeus and a mortal, he
j clothes the godhead In a human
j form ("And the Word was mode
flesh, and dwelt among us"). He
| comforts his people, yet lie also
sets father against son, mother
I against daughter.
He enters into the bodies of
those iiis frenzied followers kill
i and devour ("Take, eat: tlr .is my
body"), a living and perpetual
j sacrifice. And he always rises
again, no matter how many times
he is torn, .just as the dead vine
(sends forth new shoots. Through
| him, the Greeks conceived of the
I immortality of the soul.
The Action
Now none of this is really ox
i plicit in the play; bui a knowl
-1 edge of it immeasurably enhances
| one's appreciation of what ac
tually happens, which is this:
I Dionysus, son of Zeus and the
I Theban princess Sernele, comes to
i Thebes to establish his rites, iiis
j aunts have blasphemed him by
saying that Sernele lied about
i Zeus' being his father.
His cousin. Pentheus, now
. King of Thebes, not only refuses
| to recognize him, but trios to im
prison and kill him and his I I
! lowers. However, the fetters come
unloosed and the doors of the
cells are opened in a striking
parallel to God's freeing of St.
Paul ("And suddenly there was a
I great earthquake, so that the
| foundations of the pri-on wore
j shaken: and immediately all the
doors were opened, and everyone's
j bands were loosed").

As a judgment upon them, Di
onysus drives Agave, Pentheus'
mother, and her sisters into a
I drunken frenzy, and then sends
Pentheus (disquised as a woman)
1 to spy on them. Needless to say,
Agave discovers Pentheus, but
| recognizes him only as an in
truder; and so she and her 1 sis
ters tear him limb from limb and
strip the flesh from his body.
lVn( liens' Head
Agave returns to Thebes, brand
i ishing aloft her son's bead, which
she believes is that of a lion.
When she discoveres it is really
her son, she is heartbroken and
j begs forgiveness. Here, however,
| Christ and Bacchus part company;
I for Bacchus, inexorable as Ihe
Fates themselves, sentences them
i all to an awful doom.
They must accept his decree;
■ they can do nothing else. And
the play closes with a gold-
I masked, gold-skinned Dionysus,
°
i stony-eyed and implacable, mag
| nificently glittering even after
the last lay of light has faded
! from the stage.
It is an awesome moment,
i the summit of the tragedy. Un
fortunately, the road leading there
'is a bit uneven, mostly because
I of William Arrowsmith. His
i translation is practically unplay
' able; it does have its moments of
j bitter comedy and virile dialogue,
I but on the whole it is woefully far
j from matching in its language the
grandly austere struggle between
i more-than-human man and lcss
than-human god. What cries for a
j Shakespeare, or at least an Edith
i Hamilton, has not gotten much at
; all.
i nderstatenient
William Sharp's directing is
most effective in the group scenes,
1 where proper arrangement and
i movement are crucial. However,
| the understated rendering for
which he strives is not very exeit
ing and tends to deteriorate into
woodenness.
The rest of the trouble lies
with actors who are forgivably

unequal to their monumental
tasks. The messengers and chorus
report all the action, since none of
it lakes place on stage. Naturally,
then, they must be consummate
masters of their craft, in order to
create between them a compelling
image of what has happened.
Lawrence Madison and John
Wright, the messengers, are just
plain bad. Susan Leich, the chorus
leader, is impressively frenzied
when she speaks alone; but her
followers are awkward and their
words are often lost amid the din
of tambourines and bongo drums.

most effective in the group scenes,
1 where proper arrangement and
i movement are crucial. However,
| the understated rendering for
which he strives is not very exeit
ing and tends to deteriorate into
woodenness.
The rest of the trouble lies
with actors who are forgivably

unequal to their monumental
tasks. The messengers and chorus
report all the action, since none of
it lakes place on stage. Naturally,
then, they must be consummate
masters of their craft, in order to
create between them a compelling
image of what has happened.
Lawrence Madison and John
Wright, the messengers, are just
plain bad. Susan Leich, the chorus
leader, is impressively frenzied
when she speaks alone; but her
followers are awkward and their
words are often lost amid the din
of tambourines and bongo drums.
Bungling Senility
William Louis is too much the
sweet, senile Grandpa Cadmus;
his important speeches get lost
amid his bungling. Faced with an
impossible job, Donald Patterson
as Dionysus nevertheless is often
close to success, but he doesn't
ever quite capture that soft yet
electric sensuousness that is the
god.
Conrad Bishop (Teiresias, the
blind seer i and John Hellweg
(Pentheus) also do quite well; but
it is Norma Edwards as Agave
who gives the most nearly perfect
performance. The play, which has
been fitfully smoldering up until
her entrance near the end, cratches
fire with her first line and burns
brilliantly light through the
moment of aw 112 u 1, implacable
! judgment.
And. in spite of the flaws, it is
a moment well worth waiting for.
"The Bacchae" was Euripides'
last play, and is probably his
greatest tragedy, mainly because
it deals with Dionysus, the most
J significant figure in all Greek
[mythology. Dionysus, or Bacchus,
lis the god of wine wine which
' makes men mad as well as merry.
But more important, he is the
Christ of the Greek myths. The
I son of Zeus and a mortal, he
j clothes the godhead In a human
j form ("And the Word was mode
flesh, and dwelt among us"). He
| comforts his people, yet lie also
sets father against son, mother
I against daughter.
He enters into the bodies of
those iiis frenzied followers kill
i and devour ("Take, eat: tlr .is my
body"), a living and perpetual
j sacrifice. And he always rises
again, no matter how many times
he is torn, .just as the dead vine
(sends forth new shoots. Through
| him, the Greeks conceived of the
I immortality of the soul.
The Action
Now none of this is really ox
i plicit in the play; bui a knowl
-1 edge of it immeasurably enhances
| one's appreciation of what ac
tually happens, which is this:
I Dionysus, son of Zeus and the
I Theban princess Sernele, comes to
i Thebes to establish his rites, iiis
j aunts have blasphemed him by
saying that Sernele lied about
i Zeus' being his father.
His cousin. Pentheus, now
. King of Thebes, not only refuses
| to recognize him, but trios to im
prison and kill him and his I I
! lowers. However, the fetters come
unloosed and the doors of the
cells are opened in a striking
parallel to God's freeing of St.
Paul ("And suddenly there was a
I great earthquake, so that the
| foundations of the pri-on wore
j shaken: and immediately all the
doors were opened, and everyone's
j bands were loosed").

As a judgment upon them, Di
onysus drives Agave, Pentheus'
mother, and her sisters into a
I drunken frenzy, and then sends
Pentheus (disquised as a woman)
1 to spy on them. Needless to say,
Agave discovers Pentheus, but
| recognizes him only as an in
truder; and so she and her 1 sis
ters tear him limb from limb and
strip the flesh from his body.
lVn( liens' Head
Agave returns to Thebes, brand
i ishing aloft her son's bead, which
she believes is that of a lion.
When she discoveres it is really
her son, she is heartbroken and
j begs forgiveness. Here, however,
| Christ and Bacchus part company;
I for Bacchus, inexorable as Ihe
Fates themselves, sentences them
i all to an awful doom.
They must accept his decree;
■ they can do nothing else. And
the play closes with a gold-
I masked, gold-skinned Dionysus,
°
i stony-eyed and implacable, mag
| nificently glittering even after
the last lay of light has faded
! from the stage.
It is an awesome moment,
i the summit of the tragedy. Un
fortunately, the road leading there
'is a bit uneven, mostly because
I of William Arrowsmith. His
i translation is practically unplay
' able; it does have its moments of
j bitter comedy and virile dialogue,
I but on the whole it is woefully far
j from matching in its language the
grandly austere struggle between
i more-than-human man and lcss
than-human god. What cries for a
j Shakespeare, or at least an Edith
i Hamilton, has not gotten much at
; all.
