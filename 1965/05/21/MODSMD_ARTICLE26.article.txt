## 
### PETE KING 
Jt will be 1 he North vs. the
South today and tomorrow in the
AAWU Conference Track Meet
ii Pullman, Wash.
Stanford and USC will lead the
California thinclads, while Ore
gon and Washington State will
be try>ng to end a two-decade
California domination of West
Coast track.
The Trojans have won 13 of
the past 11 conference titles, and
eight of those times have also
won tho NCAA meet. But this is
. )iv:7on's first year in the eonfer
since he.oming a major
track power. The Ducks won The
riCAA meei overwhelmingly last
year, and also in 19(!2. In confer
ee dv.a' •(•• compeljiion they
nro 5-0.
Talent Spread" Around
Stanford's chances for a victory
are fairly good, but ihe talent is
spread around the conference so
evenly that for the first time in
years, one team isn't an odds-on

favorite.
in an eight-team meel, individ
ual brilliance is more important
han icm depth. However, Ore
gon has at least one man in
nearly ( very event who is among
lie ton five in performances this
year. LTSC's squad is equally as
deep. The meet is scored 5-4-3-2-1,
he team with two outstand
ing men can score high in a ny
event.
Stanford's hopes will ride on
he three sprint races, the mile,
discus, and pole vault. The 440-
elay team should win handily,
and Larry Questad is the big fa
,'ori'e in the lot) and 220, where
'•is only competition will be Ore-
Ton's Dave Blun!, a 9.5 man re
en My recovered from an injury-
Stanford's Eric Frische has
lone 9.6 along with four others
in the conference and will also
be counted on for points.
Wind Preserves Records
The conference records are
only 9.(5 and 21.0 in both races
Questad could top those easily
but the wind at Pullman's sta
dium is something fierce, and the
times may not count as records
Burly Bob Stoecker has throwr
the discus 183-IOVa, and is im
proving each week. He barely
lost to USC's Gary Carlsen ir
an earlier dual meet, and is fig
ured for first or second tomor
row.
Paul Sehlieke has the nation's
second-best mile and two-mile col
legiate times, but the number one
man is UCLA's Bob Day. Sch
licke will run only the mile,
where his best is 4:04.4.
Chuck Smith pole vaulted 15-
S'i in late March, but an injury
has sidelined him since. He ap
pears ready this week, and with
teammate Jim Eshelman could go
1-2 in the event. Bill Fosdick of
HSC has cleared 1(5 feet, but is
inconsistent.
Elsewhere the Tribe will have
to scramble hard for points.
George Porter is sixth best in
the javelin, while Greg Ford and
Bud Walsh are fifth in the inter
mediate hurdles and broad jump,
respectively.
Deiibner a Contender
Dave Deubner is a strong con
tender in tbe three-mile, having
run 13:57.7, Ihe Stanford record.
Weym Kirkland and Harlan An
drews are the other distance race
hopes for the Cards.
Washington State, with a home
field advantage, could surprise
everyone. Buck Kipe has thrown
the javelin 246-84 and Bill Bleak
ney has a 14.0 high hurdles best.
WSU also has a 15-8 pole vaulter.
a 57-foot shot putter, a 9.6 sprin
ter, a 6-9 high jumper, and a
50-foot triple jumper.
USC men have the best marks
in six events, plus great depth
in the shot put, 880, and broad
jump. But the Trojans have been

plagued by injuries iliis year, and
several ath'etes won't be at iheir
jest-
Oregon is led by (53-foot shot
putter Neil Steinhauer, a pair of
14.1 hurdlers, two fine sprinters,
and all-around strength in the
field events.
With such talent on three other
teams, Stanford may finish as
low as fourth, as they did last
year. A higher finish will depend
on good efforts by the Tribe's
second and third men in each
event.


808 STOECKER, Stanford d iscus
thrower, currently has the second
longest throw in the conference,
183 feet 10 '/ 2 inches.
