# Indian Trackmen Rank High in '65 Performances
## 
### 
Stanford ranks high in individ
ual collegiate track and field
marks this season, according to
IVCAA statistics.
The Tribe's world-record 440 re
lay team naturally holds the best
college mark of 39.7 seconds.
Larry Questad's 9.3 clocking in
the 100-yard dash has been
equalled by two and bettered only
by Dick Stebbins' 9.2. His 20.7
time in the 220 also ranks second.
Nobody has yet run a better
mile race this year than UCLA's
Bob Day and Stanford's Paul
Schlicke. Schlicke ran second to
Day in an earlier dual meet, and
currently has the second-best
time, 4:04.4. His 8:51.4 two-mile is
also bettered only by Day.
Ktoecker Third
Bob Stoecker is third in the dis
cus, at 183-10%, but could likely
move higher at his present rate
of improvement.
Chuck Smith and Jim Eshel
man are fourth and sixth, respec
tively, in the pole vault. Smith
vaulted 15-8 la Iwo months ago
and has been injured since. Eshel
man's best height is 15-714.
The muscle injury to Questad
in last week's Coliseum Relays
was not severe enough to keep
him out of the AAWU cham
pionships nt Pullman this Satur
day.
