# Tribe Encounters Valley State In initial Step Toward Omaha
## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
The Stanford Indians, after a
hair-raising victory in the CIBA,
encounter the challenge of San
Fernando Valley State College,
today and tomorrow, for this
state's collegiate baseball suprem
acy.
Cal actually tied Stanford for
$he league championship on the
basis of won-lost records, 12-S, but
the Indians defeated Cal three
out of four times to put the Bears
in hibernation for another year.
Meanwhile, Santa Clara vv ho
posed the only real threat to Stan
ford was eliminated by their 6-5
loss to USC Tuesday.
Another Close Kace
Valley State was also involved
in a tense battle for their league's
crown. In order to win the Cen
tral California Athletic Associa
tion title, they had to heat Cal

Poly in the final game of the sea
j son for both teams last Saturday.
Valley State won and with a shut
! out to boot.
Whichever team can win this
weekend's two out of three series
will travel to Pullman next week
i to play Washington State for the
Western Region championship
! and the coveted trip to the base
| ball world series in Omaha, Ne-
I braska.
Valley State coach Stan Char
nofsky plans to throw his late
j blossoming ace Paul Edmondson
| in Friday's game, which is sched
uled for 3 p.m. Dutch Fehring
will counter with sophomore star
Daro Quiring.
slow Starter
j Edmondson is only 5-4 overall,
! but he is 4-1 in league including
the recent shutout of Cal Poly.
Most of his 3.59 earned-run-aver

age can be attributed to early
season arm trouble which slowed
him considerably from his previ
ous year's all-CCAA pace.
Quiring is now 9-3 on the sea
son. He pitched five innings
against Santa Clara until he was
tnken out for a pinch-hiiter. He
allowed four runs, one of which
wa let in through an error. An
other run had to depend on a bad
bounce to score.

Another Close Kace

Valley State coach Stan Char
nofsky plans to throw his late
j blossoming ace Paul Edmondson
| in Friday's game, which is sched
uled for 3 p.m. Dutch Fehring
will counter with sophomore star
Daro Quiring.
slow Starter
j Edmondson is only 5-4 overall,
! but he is 4-1 in league including
the recent shutout of Cal Poly.
Most of his 3.59 earned-run-aver

age can be attributed to early
season arm trouble which slowed
him considerably from his previ
ous year's all-CCAA pace.
Quiring is now 9-3 on the sea
son. He pitched five innings
against Santa Clara until he was
tnken out for a pinch-hiiter. He
allowed four runs, one of which
wa let in through an error. An
other run had to depend on a bad
bounce to score.
