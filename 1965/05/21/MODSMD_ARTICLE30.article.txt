pionships.
So far Stanford I:as compiled

The Indians will at tempi to
I erase the two length lead by
which Cal defeated them earlier
! in the year. UCLA won by a
single length.
Usually, the contest boils down
to a Cal-Washington race, b u t
this year Stanford should be in
ihe thick of it. The Indians beat

Washington i'<>r the first lime in •
17 years this season, and they
are confident that with a smooth
.. rtormance they can beat Cal.
The last time that Stanford
won the West Coast champion
ship was .">() years ago. The In-,
dians place second nationally that
year, also.
Almost in
In 19.">5, Stanford had a good
chance to take the national iitle.
nut they mei the usual resistance
from Cal and Washington.
Coach Condon will take Dave
Bobbins, Larry Muff, Larry Me-
Bride, Leeds Disston, Bill Stump.
Dick I-lerzog, Carl Mundt, V. T.
