### OLASOPE OYELARAN 
KDITOK'S NOTE: Mr. Oyelaran is a gradual',
student in linguistics from Nigeria.

It is the fashion these days not to credit the
Johnson A with any originality in
the major poncies that have been executed at
home and abroad. Both friends and foes of the
administration are equally vocal about this point.
The former want to portray President Johnson as
the "good man," the proponent of the "Great So
ciety" and "peaceful, free world," who is being
hampered by the mess he has inherited from the
Kennedy Administration. The latter set; all the
good things that have been happening since John
son took over as either the consummation of
trends initiated in the "New Deal" era, or as the
fruits of policies conceived and formulated by the
Kennedy Administration.
Both attitudes, if taken seriously, give us a
picture of poor, innocent President Johnson, only
potentially great, potentially self-assertive, but
evidently weak and dependent on the patronage
which he had amassed during his Senatorial years.
The fact is that Lyndon B. Johnson is a shrewd,
proud, and effective statesman who happens to
have decided to be President of the United States
on his own terms, and to rule only according to his
own convictions. And here lies the tragedy of the
whole situation. He is shrewd enough to exploit
to the last the potentiality of certain ideas of
which he may not have been the originator, and to
make use of their inherent possibilities of which
their authors may have been ignorant.
Harvard Dons
The late President Kennedy did show the way by
making Harvard dons the font of most of his
ideas. But President Johnson goes one better. With
his base at Princeton, to placate tiie Ivy-League
snobs, he draws his academic "advisers" from all
over the country. The subtlety of this step lies
in that Lyndon Johnson has never indicated any
inclination to be as dependent on theve characters
in the formulation of his policies as his predecessor
was.
President Johnson on the other hand, merely gets
them together, sells them his own ideas and leaves
them to defend the ideas throughout the length
and breadth of the nation. How he does il is a
vast subject, which. 1 think, we had better not
broached here. But let us look at an example.
For months, President Johnson had been justify
ing the war in Viet Nam on the basis of the
American principles of Freedom and Self-deter
mination. The United States, in other words, was
fighting to secure for the people of South Viet Nam
Freedom from self-styled dictators, and from Com
munism. This policy was echoed in every corner
of the country, and it disarmed the arguments of
the "peace-mongers" in a way.
But soon t lie President realized the inconsistency
in preaching "Self-determination" on one hand,
and imposing an unwanted, economically ruinous
way on an innocent people on the other. About a
month ago, he struck a new tune. And now, the
United States is fighting only to contain Con
munism within its present limits in the "Free
World."
The results are many and visible:
(1Â» The war in South Viet Nam escalated more
than ever; and henceforth, there shall be no in
formation about the movement of the U.S. marine
in and out of the Pacific bases.
(2) In the Dominican Republic the Administra
tion had to act; first, to protect the 3,000 Ameri
cans in that country. But again as this reason be
came stale and unconvincing, we are given the
truth: to forestall a communist take-over, because
it would have been too late to act as is constitution
ally set down and agreed to by the Organization oi
American States.
(3) The Congress rushed through a $700,000,000
bill to "fight Communism in Viet Nam" (and.
though not stated, in the Dominican Republic).

That this latest brain-child of President John
son, a result of irrational "ideo-phobia," has found
efficient salesmen in his academic "mentors" was
demonstrated here last Friday, May 5, at the White
Memorial Plaza. During his speech, Professor
Gabriel Almond of the Political Science Depart
ment, whose opinion cannot be shunned in the
Presidential quarters, chanted succintly, in refrain,
the new Johnson tune:
il ) that the United States is determined to show
China that there is a power strong enough to
counter her revolutionary policy;
(2) that the United States is determined to con
vince the people of South Viet Nam that Commu
nism is evil, and is only after their life and blood.
In the meantime both President and, of course,
Professor Almond (after a long process of soul
searching!) are convinced that the only way to
achieve these goals is by fighting in South Viet
Nam. They believe that all other alternatives, if
there is any, will be ignoring "facts of life." Now.
if we agree with them that China is the source of
all current evils, we cannot but be distressed at
what seems like unlimited alternatives that have
been, and are being overlooked.
The tragedy of the Johnson genius and, conse
quently, of the American policy will then strike
us full force.
China Analogy
It is the assumption of the present policy, and of
ihis Professor Almond is quite convinced, that in
a debate you can convince your opponents as well
as the judges by shutting off all channels of
communication. Without carrying this analogy
luriher, ihe United States wants to convince China
of her own strength, and of the folly in China's
revolutionary policy.
The United States sincerely believes that the
only way to do that is to fight in Viet Nam. as
stated above. In other words, the United States
has decided that the only alternative means to
get rid of the flea is by killing its victim.
While (he fighting is going on in Viet Nam
economic productivity is at a stand still, peasants,
civilians are dying by the thousands every week;
China is prospering, and is carefully, and diligently
nurturing her "nuclear baby."
But there are other absurdities which the pres
ent policy of the United has produced. First, it
keeps on admitting that about two-thirds of South
Vict Nam is organized and controlled by the Viet
Cong. Yet it hopes to negotiate Viet Nam only on
the condition that the Viet Cong do not appear
at the negotiating table, and that the new govern
ment comes from the other one-third of the country
that is controlled by the U.S. Army.
Second, the reality which the United States re
fuses to admil under certain conditions, she is em
bracing under a different set of circumstances.
Ideological War
The United States now speaks of and wages an
ideological war with the sovereign nation of
China, but otherwise denies the existence of that
. lion. This absurdity shuts out the many alterna
tives which would have been open for the negotia
tion of Viet Nam, and of other issues that may
occur hereafter. If China were recognized in in
ternational diplomacy, I submit that, it would not
lake a show of force to convince her whether or
not there is a counter force to Communism. After
ail the United States had never had to fight the
Soviet Union to convince her of that fact. This
point refers to the analogy of winning a debate
mentioned above.
In short, the United States of America needs a
thorough soul-searching and a re-appraisal of the
principles, past and present, on which her foreign
policy is now based. She needs to be aware of
changing trends in the world of men of of ideas,
and adapt to them, or else become obsolete.
Democracy has a great potentiality, but it will
do no good to commit the intellectual crime of
stiffling the budding ideas among the academi
cians. But these dons themselves are to blame.
They will be judged by history for their laziness
and servile gullibility.

in that Lyndon Johnson has never indicated any
inclination to be as dependent on theve characters
in the formulation of his policies as his predecessor
was.
President Johnson on the other hand, merely gets
them together, sells them his own ideas and leaves
them to defend the ideas throughout the length
and breadth of the nation. How he does il is a
vast subject, which. 1 think, we had better not
broached here. But let us look at an example.
For months, President Johnson had been justify
ing the war in Viet Nam on the basis of the
American principles of Freedom and Self-deter
mination. The United States, in other words, was
fighting to secure for the people of South Viet Nam
Freedom from self-styled dictators, and from Com
munism. This policy was echoed in every corner
of the country, and it disarmed the arguments of
the "peace-mongers" in a way.
But soon t lie President realized the inconsistency
in preaching "Self-determination" on one hand,
and imposing an unwanted, economically ruinous
way on an innocent people on the other. About a
month ago, he struck a new tune. And now, the
United States is fighting only to contain Con
munism within its present limits in the "Free
World."
The results are many and visible:
(1Â» The war in South Viet Nam escalated more
than ever; and henceforth, there shall be no in
formation about the movement of the U.S. marine
in and out of the Pacific bases.
(2) In the Dominican Republic the Administra
tion had to act; first, to protect the 3,000 Ameri
cans in that country. But again as this reason be
came stale and unconvincing, we are given the
truth: to forestall a communist take-over, because
it would have been too late to act as is constitution
ally set down and agreed to by the Organization oi
American States.
(3) The Congress rushed through a $700,000,000
bill to "fight Communism in Viet Nam" (and.
though not stated, in the Dominican Republic).

That this latest brain-child of President John
son, a result of irrational "ideo-phobia," has found
efficient salesmen in his academic "mentors" was
demonstrated here last Friday, May 5, at the White
Memorial Plaza. During his speech, Professor
Gabriel Almond of the Political Science Depart
ment, whose opinion cannot be shunned in the
Presidential quarters, chanted succintly, in refrain,
the new Johnson tune:
il ) that the United States is determined to show
China that there is a power strong enough to
counter her revolutionary policy;
(2) that the United States is determined to con
vince the people of South Viet Nam that Commu
nism is evil, and is only after their life and blood.
In the meantime both President and, of course,
Professor Almond (after a long process of soul
searching!) are convinced that the only way to
achieve these goals is by fighting in South Viet
Nam. They believe that all other alternatives, if
there is any, will be ignoring "facts of life." Now.
if we agree with them that China is the source of
all current evils, we cannot but be distressed at
what seems like unlimited alternatives that have
been, and are being overlooked.
The tragedy of the Johnson genius and, conse
quently, of the American policy will then strike
us full force.
China Analogy
It is the assumption of the present policy, and of
ihis Professor Almond is quite convinced, that in
a debate you can convince your opponents as well
as the judges by shutting off all channels of
communication. Without carrying this analogy
luriher, ihe United States wants to convince China
of her own strength, and of the folly in China's
revolutionary policy.
The United States sincerely believes that the
only way to do that is to fight in Viet Nam. as
stated above. In other words, the United States
has decided that the only alternative means to
get rid of the flea is by killing its victim.
While (he fighting is going on in Viet Nam
economic productivity is at a stand still, peasants,
civilians are dying by the thousands every week;
China is prospering, and is carefully, and diligently
nurturing her "nuclear baby."
But there are other absurdities which the pres
ent policy of the United has produced. First, it
keeps on admitting that about two-thirds of South
Vict Nam is organized and controlled by the Viet
Cong. Yet it hopes to negotiate Viet Nam only on
the condition that the Viet Cong do not appear
at the negotiating table, and that the new govern
ment comes from the other one-third of the country
that is controlled by the U.S. Army.
Second, the reality which the United States re
fuses to admil under certain conditions, she is em
bracing under a different set of circumstances.
Ideological War
The United States now speaks of and wages an
ideological war with the sovereign nation of
China, but otherwise denies the existence of that
. lion. This absurdity shuts out the many alterna
tives which would have been open for the negotia
tion of Viet Nam, and of other issues that may
occur hereafter. If China were recognized in in
ternational diplomacy, I submit that, it would not
lake a show of force to convince her whether or
not there is a counter force to Communism. After
ail the United States had never had to fight the
Soviet Union to convince her of that fact. This
point refers to the analogy of winning a debate
mentioned above.
In short, the United States of America needs a
thorough soul-searching and a re-appraisal of the
principles, past and present, on which her foreign
policy is now based. She needs to be aware of
changing trends in the world of men of of ideas,
and adapt to them, or else become obsolete.
Democracy has a great potentiality, but it will
do no good to commit the intellectual crime of
stiffling the budding ideas among the academi
cians. But these dons themselves are to blame.
They will be judged by history for their laziness
and servile gullibility.

It is the fashion these days not to credit the
Johnson A with any originality in
the major poncies that have been executed at
home and abroad. Both friends and foes of the
administration are equally vocal about this point.
The former want to portray President Johnson as
the "good man," the proponent of the "Great So
ciety" and "peaceful, free world," who is being
hampered by the mess he has inherited from the
Kennedy Administration. The latter set; all the
good things that have been happening since John
son took over as either the consummation of
trends initiated in the "New Deal" era, or as the
fruits of policies conceived and formulated by the
Kennedy Administration.
Both attitudes, if taken seriously, give us a
picture of poor, innocent President Johnson, only
potentially great, potentially self-assertive, but
evidently weak and dependent on the patronage
which he had amassed during his Senatorial years.
The fact is that Lyndon B. Johnson is a shrewd,
proud, and effective statesman who happens to
have decided to be President of the United States
on his own terms, and to rule only according to his
own convictions. And here lies the tragedy of the
whole situation. He is shrewd enough to exploit
to the last the potentiality of certain ideas of
which he may not have been the originator, and to
make use of their inherent possibilities of which
their authors may have been ignorant.
Harvard Dons
The late President Kennedy did show the way by
making Harvard dons the font of most of his
ideas. But President Johnson goes one better. With
his base at Princeton, to placate tiie Ivy-League
snobs, he draws his academic "advisers" from all

it would have been too late to act as is constitution
ally set down and agreed to by the Organization oi
American States.
(3) The Congress rushed through a $700,000,000
bill to "fight Communism in Viet Nam" (and.
though not stated, in the Dominican Republic).

That this latest brain-child of President John
son, a result of irrational "ideo-phobia," has found
efficient salesmen in his academic "mentors" was
demonstrated here last Friday, May 5, at the White
Memorial Plaza. During his speech, Professor
Gabriel Almond of the Political Science Depart
ment, whose opinion cannot be shunned in the
Presidential quarters, chanted succintly, in refrain,
the new Johnson tune:
il ) that the United States is determined to show
China that there is a power strong enough to
counter her revolutionary policy;
(2) that the United States is determined to con
vince the people of South Viet Nam that Commu
nism is evil, and is only after their life and blood.
In the meantime both President and, of course,
Professor Almond (after a long process of soul
searching!) are convinced that the only way to
achieve these goals is by fighting in South Viet
Nam. They believe that all other alternatives, if
there is any, will be ignoring "facts of life." Now.
if we agree with them that China is the source of
all current evils, we cannot but be distressed at
what seems like unlimited alternatives that have
been, and are being overlooked.
The tragedy of the Johnson genius and, conse
quently, of the American policy will then strike
us full force.
China Analogy
It is the assumption of the present policy, and of
ihis Professor Almond is quite convinced, that in
a debate you can convince your opponents as well
as the judges by shutting off all channels of
communication. Without carrying this analogy
luriher, ihe United States wants to convince China
of her own strength, and of the folly in China's
revolutionary policy.
The United States sincerely believes that the
only way to do that is to fight in Viet Nam. as
stated above. In other words, the United States
has decided that the only alternative means to
get rid of the flea is by killing its victim.
While (he fighting is going on in Viet Nam
economic productivity is at a stand still, peasants,
civilians are dying by the thousands every week;
China is prospering, and is carefully, and diligently
nurturing her "nuclear baby."
But there are other absurdities which the pres
ent policy of the United has produced. First, it
keeps on admitting that about two-thirds of South
Vict Nam is organized and controlled by the Viet
Cong. Yet it hopes to negotiate Viet Nam only on
the condition that the Viet Cong do not appear
at the negotiating table, and that the new govern
ment comes from the other one-third of the country
that is controlled by the U.S. Army.
Second, the reality which the United States re
fuses to admil under certain conditions, she is em
bracing under a different set of circumstances.
Ideological War
The United States now speaks of and wages an
ideological war with the sovereign nation of
China, but otherwise denies the existence of that
. lion. This absurdity shuts out the many alterna
tives which would have been open for the negotia
tion of Viet Nam, and of other issues that may
occur hereafter. If China were recognized in in
ternational diplomacy, I submit that, it would not
lake a show of force to convince her whether or
not there is a counter force to Communism. After
ail the United States had never had to fight the
Soviet Union to convince her of that fact. This
point refers to the analogy of winning a debate
mentioned above.
In short, the United States of America needs a
thorough soul-searching and a re-appraisal of the
principles, past and present, on which her foreign
policy is now based. She needs to be aware of
changing trends in the world of men of of ideas,
and adapt to them, or else become obsolete.
Democracy has a great potentiality, but it will
do no good to commit the intellectual crime of
stiffling the budding ideas among the academi
cians. But these dons themselves are to blame.
They will be judged by history for their laziness
and servile gullibility.

It is the fashion these days not to credit the
Johnson A with any originality in
the major poncies that have been executed at
home and abroad. Both friends and foes of the
administration are equally vocal about this point.
The former want to portray President Johnson as
the "good man," the proponent of the "Great So
ciety" and "peaceful, free world," who is being
hampered by the mess he has inherited from the
Kennedy Administration. The latter set; all the
good things that have been happening since John
son took over as either the consummation of
trends initiated in the "New Deal" era, or as the
fruits of policies conceived and formulated by the
Kennedy Administration.
Both attitudes, if taken seriously, give us a
picture of poor, innocent President Johnson, only
potentially great, potentially self-assertive, but
evidently weak and dependent on the patronage
which he had amassed during his Senatorial years.
The fact is that Lyndon B. Johnson is a shrewd,
proud, and effective statesman who happens to
have decided to be President of the United States
on his own terms, and to rule only according to his
own convictions. And here lies the tragedy of the
whole situation. He is shrewd enough to exploit
to the last the potentiality of certain ideas of
which he may not have been the originator, and to
make use of their inherent possibilities of which
their authors may have been ignorant.
Harvard Dons
The late President Kennedy did show the way by
making Harvard dons the font of most of his
ideas. But President Johnson goes one better. With
his base at Princeton, to placate tiie Ivy-League
snobs, he draws his academic "advisers" from all
over the country. The subtlety of this step lies
in that Lyndon Johnson has never indicated any
inclination to be as dependent on theve characters
in the formulation of his policies as his predecessor
was.
President Johnson on the other hand, merely gets
them together, sells them his own ideas and leaves
them to defend the ideas throughout the length
and breadth of the nation. How he does il is a
vast subject, which. 1 think, we had better not
broached here. But let us look at an example.
For months, President Johnson had been justify
ing the war in Viet Nam on the basis of the
American principles of Freedom and Self-deter
mination. The United States, in other words, was
fighting to secure for the people of South Viet Nam
Freedom from self-styled dictators, and from Com
munism. This policy was echoed in every corner
of the country, and it disarmed the arguments of
the "peace-mongers" in a way.
But soon t lie President realized the inconsistency
in preaching "Self-determination" on one hand,
and imposing an unwanted, economically ruinous
way on an innocent people on the other. About a
month ago, he struck a new tune. And now, the
United States is fighting only to contain Con
munism within its present limits in the "Free
World."
The results are many and visible:
(1Â» The war in South Viet Nam escalated more
than ever; and henceforth, there shall be no in
formation about the movement of the U.S. marine
in and out of the Pacific bases.
(2) In the Dominican Republic the Administra
tion had to act; first, to protect the 3,000 Ameri
cans in that country. But again as this reason be
came stale and unconvincing, we are given the
truth: to forestall a communist take-over, because
it would have been too late to act as is constitution

as the judges by shutting off all channels of
communication. Without carrying this analogy
luriher, ihe United States wants to convince China
of her own strength, and of the folly in China's
revolutionary policy.
The United States sincerely believes that the
only way to do that is to fight in Viet Nam. as
stated above. In other words, the United States
has decided that the only alternative means to
get rid of the flea is by killing its victim.
While (he fighting is going on in Viet Nam
economic productivity is at a stand still, peasants,
civilians are dying by the thousands every week;
China is prospering, and is carefully, and diligently
nurturing her "nuclear baby."
But there are other absurdities which the pres
ent policy of the United has produced. First, it
keeps on admitting that about two-thirds of South
Vict Nam is organized and controlled by the Viet
Cong. Yet it hopes to negotiate Viet Nam only on
the condition that the Viet Cong do not appear
at the negotiating table, and that the new govern
ment comes from the other one-third of the country
that is controlled by the U.S. Army.
Second, the reality which the United States re
fuses to admil under certain conditions, she is em
bracing under a different set of circumstances.
Ideological War
The United States now speaks of and wages an
ideological war with the sovereign nation of
China, but otherwise denies the existence of that
. lion. This absurdity shuts out the many alterna
tives which would have been open for the negotia
tion of Viet Nam, and of other issues that may
occur hereafter. If China were recognized in in
ternational diplomacy, I submit that, it would not
lake a show of force to convince her whether or
not there is a counter force to Communism. After
ail the United States had never had to fight the
Soviet Union to convince her of that fact. This
point refers to the analogy of winning a debate
mentioned above.
In short, the United States of America needs a
thorough soul-searching and a re-appraisal of the
principles, past and present, on which her foreign
policy is now based. She needs to be aware of
changing trends in the world of men of of ideas,
and adapt to them, or else become obsolete.
Democracy has a great potentiality, but it will
do no good to commit the intellectual crime of
stiffling the budding ideas among the academi
cians. But these dons themselves are to blame.
They will be judged by history for their laziness
and servile gullibility.

It is the fashion these days not to credit the
Johnson A with any originality in
the major poncies that have been executed at
home and abroad. Both friends and foes of the
administration are equally vocal about this point.
The former want to portray President Johnson as
the "good man," the proponent of the "Great So
ciety" and "peaceful, free world," who is being
hampered by the mess he has inherited from the
Kennedy Administration. The latter set; all the
good things that have been happening since John
son took over as either the consummation of
trends initiated in the "New Deal" era, or as the
fruits of policies conceived and formulated by the
Kennedy Administration.
Both attitudes, if taken seriously, give us a
picture of poor, innocent President Johnson, only
potentially great, potentially self-assertive, but
evidently weak and dependent on the patronage
which he had amassed during his Senatorial years.
The fact is that Lyndon B. Johnson is a shrewd,
proud, and effective statesman who happens to
have decided to be President of the United States
on his own terms, and to rule only according to his
own convictions. And here lies the tragedy of the
whole situation. He is shrewd enough to exploit
to the last the potentiality of certain ideas of
which he may not have been the originator, and to
make use of their inherent possibilities of which
their authors may have been ignorant.
Harvard Dons
The late President Kennedy did show the way by
making Harvard dons the font of most of his
ideas. But President Johnson goes one better. With
his base at Princeton, to placate tiie Ivy-League
snobs, he draws his academic "advisers" from all
over the country. The subtlety of this step lies
in that Lyndon Johnson has never indicated any
inclination to be as dependent on theve characters
in the formulation of his policies as his predecessor
was.
President Johnson on the other hand, merely gets
them together, sells them his own ideas and leaves
them to defend the ideas throughout the length
and breadth of the nation. How he does il is a
vast subject, which. 1 think, we had better not
broached here. But let us look at an example.
For months, President Johnson had been justify
ing the war in Viet Nam on the basis of the
American principles of Freedom and Self-deter
mination. The United States, in other words, was
fighting to secure for the people of South Viet Nam
Freedom from self-styled dictators, and from Com
munism. This policy was echoed in every corner
of the country, and it disarmed the arguments of
the "peace-mongers" in a way.
But soon t lie President realized the inconsistency
in preaching "Self-determination" on one hand,
and imposing an unwanted, economically ruinous
way on an innocent people on the other. About a
month ago, he struck a new tune. And now, the
United States is fighting only to contain Con
munism within its present limits in the "Free
World."
The results are many and visible:
(1Â» The war in South Viet Nam escalated more
than ever; and henceforth, there shall be no in
formation about the movement of the U.S. marine
in and out of the Pacific bases.
(2) In the Dominican Republic the Administra
tion had to act; first, to protect the 3,000 Ameri
cans in that country. But again as this reason be
came stale and unconvincing, we are given the
truth: to forestall a communist take-over, because
it would have been too late to act as is constitution
ally set down and agreed to by the Organization oi
American States.
(3) The Congress rushed through a $700,000,000
bill to "fight Communism in Viet Nam" (and.
though not stated, in the Dominican Republic).

That this latest brain-child of President John
son, a result of irrational "ideo-phobia," has found
efficient salesmen in his academic "mentors" was
demonstrated here last Friday, May 5, at the White
Memorial Plaza. During his speech, Professor
Gabriel Almond of the Political Science Depart
ment, whose opinion cannot be shunned in the
Presidential quarters, chanted succintly, in refrain,
the new Johnson tune:
il ) that the United States is determined to show
China that there is a power strong enough to
counter her revolutionary policy;
(2) that the United States is determined to con
vince the people of South Viet Nam that Commu
nism is evil, and is only after their life and blood.
In the meantime both President and, of course,
Professor Almond (after a long process of soul
searching!) are convinced that the only way to
achieve these goals is by fighting in South Viet
Nam. They believe that all other alternatives, if
there is any, will be ignoring "facts of life." Now.
if we agree with them that China is the source of
all current evils, we cannot but be distressed at
what seems like unlimited alternatives that have
been, and are being overlooked.
The tragedy of the Johnson genius and, conse
quently, of the American policy will then strike
us full force.
