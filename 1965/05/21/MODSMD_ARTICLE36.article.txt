## LASSU Is Representative 
### MICK LERNER 
Once again the Legislature of the Associated Students of Stan
ford University' is confronted with a hostile constituency. Antag
onism against LASSU has existed for many years. In the past,
destructive criticism might have been warranted, but 1 urge the
student body to objectively consider the present.

The false image of the present 1
Legislature ma\ he attributed to ;
a number of things. First and
foremost, however, is the old
myth that LASSU represents!
LASSU and no one else. Critics j
complain that the general will of j
the student body is not represent-1
ed, that members of LASSU are|
either extremely idealistic about i
the role of student government or J
extremely thoughtless a b outl
spending four hours every Thurs-!
day night on sheer folly.
Individual segments of the stu
dent body grumble about the
incompetence of their own rep-1
reseiitatives. And outspoken in
dividuals, many of whom are mo
tivated by selfish interests, con-:
tinually editorialize about the;
"squirming and procrastinating j

The as c; .-•ui.»ns made by these j
people mi be n wored. Their
m':; epic at ions, their t ren- j
'Vint corr'vients, their baseless I
and destructive criticism, their'
lack of constructive action and I
their ignorance of the entire sit
uation must be exposed. I speak
only as a member of LASSU who j
has observed the efforts of the
speaker and the representatives J
during the past year. Weaknesses,
and problems do exist. Hut the j
strengths and the potential of this j
body have been proven this year,
as never before.
The hours and days spent by
selfless individuals who sacrificed
their personal needs for the needs
of their constituencies, their fel
low students, and their university
have produced tangible results. !
LASSU sought out the problem j
areas in the fields of judicial com- i
petencc, women's social regula
tions, student-faculty-administra
tion committees, executive orga
nization, student organization fi-;
nances, elections, voluntary orga j
nidations, ASSU boards and com
mission, publications, and others.!
In most cases, positive action
was taken after all arguments
were made available and were
thoroughly discussed. The Legis
lature asserted the right 112 Stan
ford students to govern them-1
selves. We no longer submit to
the imposition of policy by Trus-j
tees or members of the adminis
tration.
We expressed our desire and,
ability to work WITH these of
ficials in the formulation of pol-j
icy. We directed their attention to
LASSU, the responsibile mannei
in which it deliberated on the i
problems of the student commun
ity and the way in which it rep
resented the views of all aspects 1
of this community, as only it can. |

We gained the necessary respect
from both the faculty and admin
ist ration.
Arbitrary Restrictions
Yet the students still do not
trust LASSU. We worked all year
to remove the arbitrary restric
tions placed on students by other
branches of the university. But
if the students do not support us,
our efforts were in vain and our
present authority is hypocritical.
Neither should one hundred and
forty students sacrifice their
time serving constituencies which
repeatedly mistrust them and de
grade their work. If anyone feels
that LASSU is acting contrary to
the wishes of the students, it is
his duty to acquire the proper
information on the matter.
If lie doubts whether his rep
resentative is adequately repre
senting him or his side of a con
troversial issue, he MUST take
steps to protect himself. If he
does nothing, or if he reverts to
general antagonism against
LASSU. he is failing himself.
For without the support, con
fidence and active participation of
the student body, we will have no
effective means to "enhance our
educational, social, and cultural
opportunities, and further ideals
for ourselves, our University and
our community." The Legislature
is constituted for this purpose,
and has finally fulfilled its respon
sibility. In the future, LASSU
will look to the student body for
support.
If students question the ade
quacy of their representation in
student government, now is the
time to do something about it,
not then.

Arbitrary Restrictions
Yet the students still do not
trust LASSU. We worked all year
to remove the arbitrary restric
tions placed on students by other
branches of the university. But
if the students do not support us,
our efforts were in vain and our
present authority is hypocritical.
Neither should one hundred and
forty students sacrifice their

repeatedly mistrust them and de
grade their work. If anyone feels
that LASSU is acting contrary to
the wishes of the students, it is
his duty to acquire the proper
information on the matter.
If lie doubts whether his rep

steps to protect himself. If he
does nothing, or if he reverts to
general antagonism against
LASSU. he is failing himself.
For without the support, con
fidence and active participation of
the student body, we will have no
effective means to "enhance our
educational, social, and cultural
opportunities, and further ideals
for ourselves, our University and
our community." The Legislature
is constituted for this purpose,
and has finally fulfilled its respon
sibility. In the future, LASSU
will look to the student body for
support.
If students question the ade

and problems do exist. Hut the j
strengths and the potential of this j
body have been proven this year,
as never before.
The hours and days spent by
selfless individuals who sacrificed
their personal needs for the needs
of their constituencies, their fel
low students, and their university
have produced tangible results. !
LASSU sought out the problem j
areas in the fields of judicial com- i
petencc, women's social regula
tions, student-faculty-administra
tion committees, executive orga
nization, student organization fi-;
nances, elections, voluntary orga j
nidations, ASSU boards and com
mission, publications, and others.!
In most cases, positive action
was taken after all arguments
were made available and were
thoroughly discussed. The Legis
lature asserted the right 112 Stan
ford students to govern them-1
selves. We no longer submit to
the imposition of policy by Trus-j
tees or members of the adminis
tration.
We expressed our desire and,
ability to work WITH these of
ficials in the formulation of pol-j
icy. We directed their attention to
LASSU, the responsibile mannei
in which it deliberated on the i
problems of the student commun
ity and the way in which it rep
resented the views of all aspects 1
of this community, as only it can. |

We gained the necessary respect
from both the faculty and admin
ist ration.
Arbitrary Restrictions
Yet the students still do not
trust LASSU. We worked all year
to remove the arbitrary restric
tions placed on students by other
branches of the university. But
if the students do not support us,
our efforts were in vain and our
present authority is hypocritical.
Neither should one hundred and
forty students sacrifice their
time serving constituencies which
repeatedly mistrust them and de
grade their work. If anyone feels
that LASSU is acting contrary to
the wishes of the students, it is
his duty to acquire the proper
information on the matter.
If lie doubts whether his rep
resentative is adequately repre
senting him or his side of a con
troversial issue, he MUST take
steps to protect himself. If he
does nothing, or if he reverts to
general antagonism against
LASSU. he is failing himself.
For without the support, con
fidence and active participation of
the student body, we will have no
effective means to "enhance our
educational, social, and cultural
opportunities, and further ideals
for ourselves, our University and
our community." The Legislature
is constituted for this purpose,
and has finally fulfilled its respon
sibility. In the future, LASSU
will look to the student body for
support.
If students question the ade
quacy of their representation in
student government, now is the
time to do something about it,
not then.
