## Sciamachy and Geophagy 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The sciamachy and the seman
tic geophagy in Donald 11. Piatt's
"Look At American Ideals" bog
gle one's mind.
1) "40 per cent in favor of U.S.
involvement, 38 per cent op
posed . . ." What sort of involve
ment? Doing what, specifically?
Where? With whom?
2) Even granting the dubious
assertion that a "voluminous
amount of information | is] avail
able to the public," such an hypo
thesis does not logically imply
that individuals are well-informed
nor does empirical evidence
point to a well-informed public.
3) "What the American public
must decide is whether they be
lieve democracy a better way of
life and a more acceptable way
of life than Communism." We
like democracy; it's 99.44 per
| cent pure. We're sure that Ig
j natius Q. Public likes it, too. Let's
! all sign up and do a maypole
j dance, waving little flags that say
"Peace Withdrawal" a sort of
Dadaist commemoration of th e
hitherto unheard of efforts "GO
years" ago to "contain Commu
nism," "contain Communism"
—"contain Communism!"
Mr. Piatt's contribution to
"clearer definition and refinement
of . . . purpose" is such moist,
steaming political prose as has
seldom been rivalled in flavor and
texture since the days of War
ren G. Harding.

Dear Mr. Glover:
Perhaps you know the answer,
j Why does a university about to
; spend $S'L- million on dorms for
' several hundred students, a few
; million for a new pavilion, etc.,
I etc., find if necessary to econo
j mi/.e by maintaining in Mem Libe
| the most thoroughly disgusting
and totally inadequate rest room
' facilities since the days of 1 he
I 'little-house-out-back.' Is no one
| else tired of buckling on his hip
! boots to wade in? Does everyone
get some kick out of drying his
! hands either on his trousers or
| handkerchief because the rest
; room is devoid of handtowels?
'■ Has no one else olfactory organs
I which are offended by that tiny,
j squalid room?
I think it only fair that people
; be required to shout loudly and
clearly "Apres m<>i, 1c deluge"
before flushing. And I think it
j only decent that more numerous
and clean restroom facilities be
offered in Memorial Library.

Editor, The Daily:
Until we read about it in the
Examiner Tuesday night, we
j hadn't realized that "the radicali
| zation of our youth is proceeding
j beyond the wildest expectations
of the Communists." Luckily, Dr.

Possony has discovered the trend
j and disclosed it to a Congressional
j Subcommittee. Holy, Moly! We
were really hoodwinked. Before
our student body cards are re
i garded as interchangeable with
: membership cards in the Com
! munist Party, perhaps Dr. Pos
! Sony would tell us at what time
so we can be in on it"the com
i munists will attempt to gain con
trol of the campus movement
and channel it to their purposes."
In view of the various recent
manifestations at Stanford of this
radicalization process, aren't we
all lucky that as a result of Mon
day's vote such dangerous non
sense is hereafter to be ploughed
j under on the Farm.
But the senior class is about
i to graduate.

Editor, The Daily
As a faculty wife I have learned
to wince whenever college profes
sors are accused of being "ideal
istic," but the advertisement
signed by 137 members of the fac
; ulty, which appeared in Monday's
Daily, seemed about as starry
| eyed as anything I have read in
recent years. The message urged
that U.S. troops be kept in Viet
! Nam until "a viable agreement
i guaranteeing the freedom of the
J people of Viet Nam" is achieved.
The assumption is that the
presence of soldiers and Marines
in the midst of a civil war 8,000
miles from the United States
will lead, somehow," to a guaran
tee of '•freedom" to a people who
have been oppressed for genera
j tions. This assumption seems far
I fetched in view of the fact that
the United States opposed free
elections in that country eight
year l ago. and has since used its
! troops to put down internal up
• risings again I a series of cor
rupt and totalitarian govern
| ments. But what makes the mes
sage seem even more remote
' from reality is the fact that to
! day's newspapers carried ac:-
i counts of a race riot among U.S.
! Marines near Da Nang air base.
As far as I know,(he Vietnamese
people have suffered many trials
bui race riots haven't been
among them. Our troops are in
deed guaranteeing something in
Indochina, but it takes a stretch
jof the imagination to call it
"freedom."

As a faculty wife I have learned
to wince whenever college profes
sors are accused of being "ideal
istic," but the advertisement
signed by 137 members of the fac
; ulty, which appeared in Monday's
Daily, seemed about as starry
| eyed as anything I have read in
recent years. The message urged
that U.S. troops be kept in Viet
! Nam until "a viable agreement
i guaranteeing the freedom of the
J people of Viet Nam" is achieved.
The assumption is that the
presence of soldiers and Marines
in the midst of a civil war 8,000
miles from the United States
will lead, somehow," to a guaran
tee of '•freedom" to a people who
have been oppressed for genera
j tions. This assumption seems far
I fetched in view of the fact that
the United States opposed free
elections in that country eight
year l ago. and has since used its
! troops to put down internal up
• risings again I a series of cor
rupt and totalitarian govern
| ments. But what makes the mes
sage seem even more remote
' from reality is the fact that to
! day's newspapers carried ac:-
i counts of a race riot among U.S.
! Marines near Da Nang air base.
As far as I know,(he Vietnamese
people have suffered many trials
bui race riots haven't been
among them. Our troops are in
deed guaranteeing something in
Indochina, but it takes a stretch
jof the imagination to call it
"freedom."

The sciamachy and the seman
tic geophagy in Donald 11. Piatt's
"Look At American Ideals" bog
gle one's mind.
1) "40 per cent in favor of U.S.
involvement, 38 per cent op
posed . . ." What sort of involve
ment? Doing what, specifically?
Where? With whom?
2) Even granting the dubious
assertion that a "voluminous
amount of information | is] avail
able to the public," such an hypo
thesis does not logically imply
that individuals are well-informed
nor does empirical evidence
point to a well-informed public.
3) "What the American public
must decide is whether they be
lieve democracy a better way of
life and a more acceptable way
of life than Communism." We
like democracy; it's 99.44 per
| cent pure. We're sure that Ig
j natius Q. Public likes it, too. Let's
! all sign up and do a maypole
j dance, waving little flags that say
"Peace Withdrawal" a sort of
Dadaist commemoration of th e
hitherto unheard of efforts "GO
years" ago to "contain Commu
nism," "contain Communism"
—"contain Communism!"
Mr. Piatt's contribution to
"clearer definition and refinement
of . . . purpose" is such moist,
steaming political prose as has
seldom been rivalled in flavor and
texture since the days of War
ren G. Harding.

Dear Mr. Glover:
Perhaps you know the answer,
j Why does a university about to
; spend $S'L- million on dorms for
' several hundred students, a few
; million for a new pavilion, etc.,
I etc., find if necessary to econo
j mi/.e by maintaining in Mem Libe
| the most thoroughly disgusting
and totally inadequate rest room
' facilities since the days of 1 he
I 'little-house-out-back.' Is no one
| else tired of buckling on his hip
! boots to wade in? Does everyone
get some kick out of drying his
! hands either on his trousers or
| handkerchief because the rest
; room is devoid of handtowels?
'■ Has no one else olfactory organs
I which are offended by that tiny,
j squalid room?
I think it only fair that people
; be required to shout loudly and
clearly "Apres m<>i, 1c deluge"
before flushing. And I think it
j only decent that more numerous
and clean restroom facilities be
offered in Memorial Library.
