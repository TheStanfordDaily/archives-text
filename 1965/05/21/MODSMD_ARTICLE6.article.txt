# Native Huts? No, It's The New Con Home

### 

A mixture of Foothill Junior College end Leisure World (popu
lar alternate for "retirement address"), this is the model for
the proposed Con Home. Its architectural purpose is probably

Stanford's trend toward integration of the real world into
pueblodom: This apparently accounts for the oriental theme
accented in the pagoda-like arrangement of the buildings.
