# THREE YEARS AGO
## Liquor Revolution Floods the Farm 
### TOM BOWEN 
More than three years ago, as
the Stanford Student Body was
gripping Armin Rosencranz into
ASSU power, another issue
arose through petition which has
caused the University and t he
ASSU to be at least at silent con
flict ever since. This was the
now famous liquor referendum
which took the campus in a
storm of signatures during the
last weeks of April. 1962.
The petition calling for LASSU
to hold a referendum on liquor
policy hit the pages of The Daily
with over 1,000 signatures on
April 19, 1962. The essence of its
complaints and suggestions to
both the A SSI and the University
was a change in the University
liquor policy which would allow
students over 21 years of age to
possess, consume and transport
intoxicating liquors on campus
without University action. The
effect of this change Would be to
bring University policy in line
with the California State law
which allows persons over 21 to
possess and consume liquor in
any public or private place.
The University policy, then and
now, prohibits any student re
gardless of age from possessing
or consuming alcoholic beverages
on the campus.
Concerned With Drinking
Joel Meister. one of the peti
tion's organizers said that the
change was concerned with drink
ing, not with its legal effects, and
thai if the referendum were
called and passed students could
be expected to act in a mature
manner, lie further charged Ihe
University's policy with b< ing un
enforcable in practice.
Repercussions from the peti
tion, which had rolled up 1,625
names by the following after
noon, were soon 101 l from the ad
ministration Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler told 1 hat
morning's Daily that he was skep
tical about any < hange in the Uni
versity liquor policy. He further
offered three objections to t he
proposed new polir\ He objected

that the proposed change would
require a court conviction before
the judicial council could act. He
also complained that the change
was an "abdication of authority
and responsibility by student gov
vernment" and that the revised
policy was "primarily restrictive
or negative in its nature."
Sensing a degree of hostility
from the administration, the lead
ers of the petition suggested the
following Monday that the Uni
versity institute their proposals
on a trial basis and "that t he
University's resources be used to
study intensively the results."
Whisp of Support
The following day a whisp of
supporting smoke appeared from
Dean of Men William G. Craig
who called the petition "timely"
and told The Daily that six weeks
earlier he had recommended to
the Committee on Student Af
fairs "a change in present regula
tions which would require less
University policing and more re
sponsibility on Ihe part of the
students and their government."
LASSU came through as ex
pected and approved the policy
for a referendum vote in the fol
lowing week's ASSU final elec
tions. A weekend passed, and ihe
pel it ion gained more and more
support as such campus figures
as Dean of Freshman Men
Dwight Clark, and Assistant
Deans of Men David Larimer and
Allard K. Lowenstein.
However, the following day
President Sterling's office re
minded students that the Trus
ees of Stanford University retain
final control over campus regula
tions concerning alcoholic bever
ages. The stalement however de
clared that the results of the ref
erendum would lx- considered by
Ihe Trustees and the President as
'an expression of student opin
ion."
Legal Backing Gather*
Meanwhile, the supporters of
the petition, led by Jim Stewart,
a law student, gathered legal sup
port I'oi their position. Stewart
told The Daily that after a Ihor

ougli search of the California
Penal Code and ihe Alcoholic
Beverage Control Act, he found
"no statute which would make
possession and consumption of
alcoholic beverages by an adult
in University residences a viola
tion of the state law."
More and more legal backing
began to form for the petition as
Assistant Professor of Law and
Philosophy Richard Wasserman
told The Daily that he could see
no law which would invalidate
the referendum's prop os e d
change. But Wasserman carried
the argument one step further
and declared "it is not, apparent
ly, illegal for a minor to consume
or possess alcoholic beverages in
any non-public place" (Stanford
is a non-public place).
The same day Chaparral ap
peared on campus with an issue
devoted entirely to "Beer, Beer,
Beer,"and ran a lead article
titled "Beer Belongs Enjoy It"
which could be construed as sup
port if not for the referendum,
for alcohol in general.
Referendum Scores Victory
Then on May 1, as the then
largest vote in history put Armin
Rosencranz' GRIP on ASSU gov
ernment. an even larger majority
of 2,716 to 7-11 affirmed the pro
posals of the liquor petition and
made it ASSU policy for persons
over 21 years of age to possess
and consume alcoholic beverages
without fear of prosecution by
student judicial councils.
, The same night at LASSU meet
ing the petitions initiators, Joel
Meister and Jim Stewart joined
ASSU president Bob Savior in en
couraging "all students to be cog
nizant of the additional respon
sibilities this change places on
them."
ASSU President-elect Rosen
cranz commented on May 11 after
a relative liquor calm that since
President Sterling did not appear
receptive to changes in ihe liquor
policy, students might attempt to
enforce the change to demon
strate their sincerity.

However, a week later, th e
Board ol' Trustes tacitly delayed
any change in official University
policy by referring the proposals
of the recently passed referen
dum hack to President Sterling
for "further study."

Sensing a degree of hostility
from the administration, the lead
ers of the petition suggested the
following Monday that the Uni

on a trial basis and "that t he
University's resources be used to
study intensively the results."
Whisp of Support
The following day a whisp of
supporting smoke appeared from
Dean of Men William G. Craig
who called the petition "timely"
and told The Daily that six weeks
earlier he had recommended to
the Committee on Student Af
fairs "a change in present regula
tions which would require less
University policing and more re
sponsibility on Ihe part of the
students and their government."
LASSU came through as ex
pected and approved the policy
for a referendum vote in the fol
lowing week's ASSU final elec

pel it ion gained more and more
support as such campus figures
as Dean of Freshman Men
Dwight Clark, and Assistant
Deans of Men David Larimer and
Allard K. Lowenstein.
However, the following day
President Sterling's office re
minded students that the Trus

final control over campus regula

ages. The stalement however de
clared that the results of the ref
erendum would lx- considered by
Ihe Trustees and the President as
'an expression of student opin

Legal Backing Gather*
Meanwhile, the supporters of
the petition, led by Jim Stewart,
a law student, gathered legal sup
port I'oi their position. Stewart
told The Daily that after a Ihor

ougli search of the California
Penal Code and ihe Alcoholic
Beverage Control Act, he found
"no statute which would make
possession and consumption of
alcoholic beverages by an adult
in University residences a viola
tion of the state law."
More and more legal backing
began to form for the petition as
Assistant Professor of Law and
Philosophy Richard Wasserman
told The Daily that he could see
no law which would invalidate
the referendum's prop os e d
change. But Wasserman carried
the argument one step further
and declared "it is not, apparent
ly, illegal for a minor to consume
or possess alcoholic beverages in
any non-public place" (Stanford
is a non-public place).
The same day Chaparral ap
peared on campus with an issue
devoted entirely to "Beer, Beer,
Beer,"and ran a lead article
titled "Beer Belongs Enjoy It"
which could be construed as sup
port if not for the referendum,
for alcohol in general.
Referendum Scores Victory
Then on May 1, as the then
largest vote in history put Armin
Rosencranz' GRIP on ASSU gov
ernment. an even larger majority
of 2,716 to 7-11 affirmed the pro
posals of the liquor petition and
made it ASSU policy for persons
over 21 years of age to possess
and consume alcoholic beverages
without fear of prosecution by
student judicial councils.

Meister and Jim Stewart joined
ASSU president Bob Savior in en

ASSU President-elect Rosen

a relative liquor calm that since

policy, students might attempt to

However, a week later, th e
Board ol' Trustes tacitly delayed
any change in official University
policy by referring the proposals
of the recently passed referen

for "further study."
More than three years ago, as
the Stanford Student Body was
gripping Armin Rosencranz into
ASSU power, another issue
arose through petition which has
caused the University and t he
ASSU to be at least at silent con

now famous liquor referendum
which took the campus in a
storm of signatures during the
last weeks of April. 1962.
The petition calling for LASSU

policy hit the pages of The Daily
with over 1,000 signatures on
April 19, 1962. The essence of its
complaints and suggestions to
both the A SSI and the University
was a change in the University
liquor policy which would allow

The same day Chaparral ap

devoted entirely to "Beer, Beer,

which could be construed as sup

for alcohol in general.
Referendum Scores Victory
Then on May 1, as the then
largest vote in history put Armin
Rosencranz' GRIP on ASSU gov
ernment. an even larger majority
of 2,716 to 7-11 affirmed the pro
posals of the liquor petition and
made it ASSU policy for persons
over 21 years of age to possess
and consume alcoholic beverages
without fear of prosecution by
student judicial councils.
, The same night at LASSU meet
ing the petitions initiators, Joel
Meister and Jim Stewart joined
ASSU president Bob Savior in en
couraging "all students to be cog

them."
ASSU President-elect Rosen
cranz commented on May 11 after
a relative liquor calm that since
President Sterling did not appear
receptive to changes in ihe liquor
policy, students might attempt to
enforce the change to demon
strate their sincerity.

However, a week later, th e
Board ol' Trustes tacitly delayed
any change in official University
policy by referring the proposals
of the recently passed referen
dum hack to President Sterling
for "further study."
More than three years ago, as
the Stanford Student Body was
gripping Armin Rosencranz into
ASSU power, another issue
arose through petition which has
caused the University and t he
ASSU to be at least at silent con
flict ever since. This was the
now famous liquor referendum
which took the campus in a
storm of signatures during the
last weeks of April. 1962.
The petition calling for LASSU
to hold a referendum on liquor
policy hit the pages of The Daily
with over 1,000 signatures on
April 19, 1962. The essence of its
complaints and suggestions to
both the A SSI and the University
was a change in the University
liquor policy which would allow
students over 21 years of age to
possess, consume and transport
intoxicating liquors on campus
without University action. The
effect of this change Would be to
bring University policy in line
with the California State law
which allows persons over 21 to
possess and consume liquor in
any public or private place.
The University policy, then and
now, prohibits any student re
gardless of age from possessing
or consuming alcoholic beverages
on the campus.
Concerned With Drinking
Joel Meister. one of the peti
tion's organizers said that the
change was concerned with drink
ing, not with its legal effects, and
thai if the referendum were
called and passed students could
be expected to act in a mature
manner, lie further charged Ihe
University's policy with b< ing un
enforcable in practice.
Repercussions from the peti
tion, which had rolled up 1,625
names by the following after
noon, were soon 101 l from the ad
ministration Dean of Students
H. Donald Winbigler told 1 hat
morning's Daily that he was skep
tical about any < hange in the Uni
versity liquor policy. He further
offered three objections to t he
proposed new polir\ He objected

that the proposed change would
require a court conviction before
the judicial council could act. He
also complained that the change
was an "abdication of authority
and responsibility by student gov
vernment" and that the revised
policy was "primarily restrictive
or negative in its nature."
Sensing a degree of hostility
from the administration, the lead
ers of the petition suggested the
following Monday that the Uni
versity institute their proposals
on a trial basis and "that t he
University's resources be used to
study intensively the results."
Whisp of Support
The following day a whisp of
supporting smoke appeared from
Dean of Men William G. Craig
who called the petition "timely"
and told The Daily that six weeks
earlier he had recommended to
the Committee on Student Af
fairs "a change in present regula
tions which would require less
University policing and more re
sponsibility on Ihe part of the
students and their government."
LASSU came through as ex
pected and approved the policy
for a referendum vote in the fol
lowing week's ASSU final elec
tions. A weekend passed, and ihe
pel it ion gained more and more
support as such campus figures
as Dean of Freshman Men
Dwight Clark, and Assistant
Deans of Men David Larimer and
Allard K. Lowenstein.
However, the following day
President Sterling's office re
minded students that the Trus
ees of Stanford University retain
final control over campus regula
tions concerning alcoholic bever
ages. The stalement however de
clared that the results of the ref
erendum would lx- considered by
Ihe Trustees and the President as
'an expression of student opin
ion."
Legal Backing Gather*
Meanwhile, the supporters of
the petition, led by Jim Stewart,
a law student, gathered legal sup
port I'oi their position. Stewart
told The Daily that after a Ihor

ougli search of the California
Penal Code and ihe Alcoholic
Beverage Control Act, he found
"no statute which would make
possession and consumption of
alcoholic beverages by an adult
in University residences a viola
tion of the state law."
More and more legal backing
began to form for the petition as
Assistant Professor of Law and
Philosophy Richard Wasserman
told The Daily that he could see
no law which would invalidate
the referendum's prop os e d
change. But Wasserman carried
the argument one step further
and declared "it is not, apparent
ly, illegal for a minor to consume
or possess alcoholic beverages in
any non-public place" (Stanford
is a non-public place).
