## 
### 
Compiled
The United States Court ol Appeals in San Francisco ruled
yesterday that the Atomie Energy Commission eould not string
j overhead power lines earrying two 220,(MX) volt cables to Stau
j lord's linear aecelator through the town of Woodside,
The court thereby reversed an earlier decision giving the AEC

permission to violate two locaH
ordinances â€¢ one of Woodside
and the other of San Mateo
County requiring that all pow-!
er lines be underground.
Judge Frederick G. Hanley j
said that these ordinances dated
back to 1950 and that their pur
pose was to preserve the integrity
of a scenic part of the country.
AEC' Forbids Violation
The opinion written by Judge
Hanley said that a provision in !
the AEC Act specifically forbids j
the commission from transmit
ting electricity in violation of fed
eral, state, or local regulations.
It could not be learned immedi
ately whether the government
would appeal the decision to the

U.S. Supreme Court or ask Con
gress to give ii the power to over
ride local ordinances.
Attorney Paul N. McCloskey,
Jr., who represented the city in
the long legal battle, proclaimed
the decision a "great victory for
conservation."
Officials at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center could not be
reached for comment.
