Attempts to supplant present
American society with a new so
cial order of complete individual
I freedom actually attack the foun
dation of all existing freedoms,
l declared Allard K. Lowenstein
yesterday in a "Freedom and Re
sponsibility" speech at Tresidder.
The series ol lectures, conclud
ing with Lowenstein's talk was
sponsored by the Graduate Coor
dinating Committee and the Poli
tical Union.
Lowenstein, former lecturer
and Assistant Dean of Men at
Stanford, described freedom as
"existing only in limitations."
Society Preserves Freedom
"Society is the guarant or
j and purveyor of freedom," he
! said. "A push for complete free-
I dom, with no limitations, would
! destroy society. And without so
| ciety there can bo no freedom."
American society has a two
fold problem regarding freedom,
i Lowenstein noted. Having largely
i rid itself of external restraints,
i it is confronted with both inter
' nal compulsions and self-image
I destruction; Lowenstein observed
that "society presents no roots
! that people can grab onto in the
I great flux around them. Thus
' people are unhappy in spite of
external freedoms and material
I prosperity."
The second part of the problem,
according to Lowenstein, stems
from the failure of American de
mocracy to remove some social
I injustices. "This failure has
j necessitated other methods," he
| said, "some of which — sit-ins,
I mass marches - are considered
[ improper by traditional stan
' dards.
Improprieties Bring I{<Niilts
"But these methods have
brought results; this may enamor
people procedures, to
the extenfNjiat they say the old
restrictions nKjonger have a ny
value."
Lowenstein contrasted Martin
Luther King, who, he said, advo
cates improper procedures only
within the framework of present
society, to improve that society,
and SNCC, "which, although we
owe it a lot, does not believe in
the viability and salvageability
of American society."
