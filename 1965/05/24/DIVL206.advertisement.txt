Many UC law students can. More than 150 of them have completed the
course in rapid and perceptive reading given by the internationally fam
ous Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute. Some are reading faster
than 1,500 words per minute.
Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute stands unquivocally behind
this offer. We want to make it clear, however that this is our minimum ex
pectation. Most graduates far exceed 3 times their starting rate.
The best way to prove to yourself that you, too, can at least triple your
reading speed is to SEE AN ACTUAL DEMONSTRATION.
• You will see a Reading Dynamics graduate read from a book he has never seen
before ... at a rate far exceeding 1000 words per minute , . . and then tell m
detail what he has read.
• You wifl see a documented film that includes actual interviews with Washington
Senators who have taken the course.
• You will learn how Reading Dynamics can show you the way to faster reading,
Improved comprehension, greater recall.
• You will hove a chance to win a full scholarship, absolutely free .
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
Eighteen years ago Evelyn Wood, a Utah schoolteacher, made a startling discovery
that led to the founding of Reading Dynamics. While working toward master's
degree, she handed a term paper to a professor and watched him read the 80
pages at 6,000 words per minute —with outstanding recall and comprehension.
Determined to find the secret behind such rapid reading, she spent the next two
years tracking down 50 people who could read faster than 1,500 words per minute.
She studied their techniques, taught herself to read at these faster rates. Now,
after years of experience in public schools and universities, she has made it possible
for you to benefit from this great discovery.
IS IT SIMPLY A PROMOTION STUNT?
About Reading Dynamics' impact on our nation's legislators, Time Magazine said
"Washington has seen nothing like it since the days when Teddy Roosevelt read
three books a day and ran the country at the same time.*

1000 Words Per Minute j
Many UC law students can. More than 150 of them have completed the
course in rapid and perceptive reading given by the internationally fam
ous Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute. Some are reading faster
than 1,500 words per minute.
Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute stands unquivocally behind
this offer. We want to make it clear, however that this is our minimum ex
pectation. Most graduates far exceed 3 times their starting rate.
The best way to prove to yourself that you, too, can at least triple your
reading speed is to SEE AN ACTUAL DEMONSTRATION.
• You will see a Reading Dynamics graduate read from a book he has never seen
before ... at a rate far exceeding 1000 words per minute , . . and then tell m
detail what he has read.
• You wifl see a documented film that includes actual interviews with Washington
Senators who have taken the course.
• You will learn how Reading Dynamics can show you the way to faster reading,
Improved comprehension, greater recall.
• You will hove a chance to win a full scholarship, absolutely free .
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?
Eighteen years ago Evelyn Wood, a Utah schoolteacher, made a startling discovery
that led to the founding of Reading Dynamics. While working toward master's
degree, she handed a term paper to a professor and watched him read the 80
pages at 6,000 words per minute —with outstanding recall and comprehension.
Determined to find the secret behind such rapid reading, she spent the next two
years tracking down 50 people who could read faster than 1,500 words per minute.
She studied their techniques, taught herself to read at these faster rates. Now,
after years of experience in public schools and universities, she has made it possible
for you to benefit from this great discovery.
IS IT SIMPLY A PROMOTION STUNT?
About Reading Dynamics' impact on our nation's legislators, Time Magazine said
"Washington has seen nothing like it since the days when Teddy Roosevelt read
three books a day and ran the country at the same time.*
