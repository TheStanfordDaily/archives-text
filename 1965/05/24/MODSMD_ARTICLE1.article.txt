# Plant-Secretion-Eating Butterflies Praised For Multiplying Mutation

Next time; you deliver 1 a lecture on the birds and the bees,
Daddy-O, why not throw in something about the butterflies?' Like
why there are so many different kinds, for instance? -»•
Without doubt it's because of "secondary" chemical substances in
the plants that butter-flies cat, according to new research studies by

Stanford Profs. Paul R. Ehrlich
and Peter H. Raven.
What's more, say the two biolo
gists. the same pattern of inter
action that is. plants and butter
flies affecting each others' evolu
tion is probably a major reason
why there are so many different
plants and animals of all kinds.
At the very least it is an evolu
tionary factor that has been
greatly neglected.
The scientists base their butter
fly-versus-plant evolution ideas on
a vast survey of the eating habits
of 132 butterfly groups (genera. 1
likely a majority of the 730-930
groups that comprise the 12.000-
15,000 known species of butterfly.
Their research, reported in a re
cent issue of the scientific jour
nal. Evolution, was partially sup
ported by grants from the Na
tional Science Foundation.
The chemical compounds se
creted by the plants, probably de
veloped by a chance mutation or
recombination of a plant's genes,
make them "unpalatable" to cer
tain butterfly larvae. In effect
they are built-in "insecticides"
that defend the plant against its
predators, the larvae.
"Plant-eating insect's, however,
can evolve in response to physio
logical obstacles," say the two sci
entists. "as shown by man's re
cent experience with insecticides.
"If a mutation appeared in a
population of insects that enabled
individuals to feed on some previ
ously protected plant group, se
lection iby survival) could carry
the insect line into a new adap
tive /one."
"What began as ;i chance muta
tion or gene recombination might
characterize an entire family or
group of related families," said
the Stanford biologists. "In the
occupation of any adaptive /.one,
(he firs! organisms to enter it
have a tremendous advantage
and are apt to become exceed
ingly diverse before evolution in
other organisms sharply restricts
their initial advantage."
Thus the interaction between
the plants and the animals which
feed on them tends to promote
the evolution of both into many
different forms.


BUTTERFLY STUDIES are a specialty with
Stanford Prof. Paul Ehrlich, shown with grad
uate student Susan Davidson at work in tin-
University's unique 750-acre Jasper Ridge "lab
oratory." The rooky, tree-studded campus pro-

serve has been continuously used for plant anil
animal research since Stanford opened in ISfM,
making- it one of the most valuable biological
research areas in the world.
