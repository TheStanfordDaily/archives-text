# Haavad Is Creamed In Rose Bowl
## 
### Willie Maker, Midas Wells 
PASADENA â€” Jan. 2, 1966
The mighty Stanford Red wa- j
tered down the most potent foot-:
ball power of the Eastern United
States, Haavad College, 112-6, in
Ihe Rose Bowl classic yesterday.;
The Indians, working off a;
T(Rancos)-formation, could find '
naughl hut holes in the Crimson
line. Powerful fullback surges. 1
dazzling end receivership, defl
quarterback delivery, coupled
with astute animalistic blocking ,
brought Ihe Camebrudge men to {
their knees.
Tim Abcna, Don Rennwick,
Gene Moffett, and John Kidde
were the stirring, sterling, sopho- ,
more stars. An unknown Daily
reporter also starred, soaking
strategic straps with concen-1
trated silver nitrate.
Haavad's sole score came after
28:00 in the second period as a
sympathetically righteous Stan
ford safety man delivered a down
field block at the 50 yard line.
The impact carried a flimsy!
Crimson across the Stanford goal, j
A lone Haavad man who ven-1
tured into the Indian lockerroom
following the slaughter criticized ,
the rude aesthetic indifference of
Ihe Stanford linemen.
An elated Indian ejaculated in
response, "We have beaten you
before, we beat you now. and we
shall forever overcome. And
we'll beat you worse next time, if
Radcliffe doesn't gel there first." ;
