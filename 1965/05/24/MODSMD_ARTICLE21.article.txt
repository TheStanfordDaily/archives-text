"Freshmen arc considered adult."—Stanford
University Bulletin.
Being a freshman, or a frosh dollie, or a
fresh(?) dollie, at Stanford is a little like start
ing out a Daily editorial—we're all loose in Won
derland.
Still, we marvel at how masterful]) the writers
of the Bulletin, that first glimpse a prospective
freshman gets at the school, accurately described
the University for us tyros at higher education.
Take, for instance, social regulations. This
was the year of the liberation of Stanford
women. That is why, in keeping with the Bul
letins statement that "a student is preparing to
take his place in an adult world and should be
treated as a mature individual," only junior and
senior women's regulations were markedlv lib
eralized.
To paraphrase the description of another
Farm, everyone is adult only some are more
adult than others.
It was a year, too, where student publications
"edited, managed, and produced" by the stu
dents sure showed it. Presidents of all kinds
were lambasted. In the Autumn Quarter, Mr.
Nay lor dumped on President Johnson and was
promptly dumped on by his editorial board.
Later on. Miss Steffen hurled a few brickbats
closer to home, accusing both the presidents of
the University and the ASSU of not setting
enough precedents. And now even the faculty

apparently got into the act, as witnessed within
the last week, only they set their sights a little
lower and allegedly maligned a mere ASSU pres
idential nominee.
Campus polities were also intriguing to the
( 'lass of '68—unfathomable, but nonetheless fas
cinating. The GCC arose from a stormy protest
to the north and ever since has efficiently and
vocerilously protested something or other. The
( row-I lalverson report halved the staff over in
the 100 Building of the Inner Quad, adequately
proving the Bulletin's insistence that there are
"no faculty advisers to thrust University policy
across editor's desks." And the off-campus issue
controversy wound up where it started—off
campus and, as lar as LASSU is concerned,
off-limits.
There was the social life featuring an "abun
dance of all-campus get fogethcrs . . . on a
"there s room for everybody' basis. Typical of
this sort of function was the Stillman Open
House, open strangely enough to upperclassman
and frosh dollies, but not frosh males—or at
least we weren't included in the Stillman invi
tation. And if a majority of student (social)
activities occur on the campus," we suspect that
a lot of us were left dry but not high if and
when we found them—on campus, that is.
l inally. the Bulletin states quite profoundly
that Stanford is "independent, coeducational . . .
and residential." Well, at least we can't fault it
on that.
