• Dump on FReditorial
Editor, The Daily:
I was deeply concerned when I
read the views expressed in this
morning's editorial. This is but one

i more in a long line of incompetent
I editorials by a long line of incom
i petents, The Daily Editors.
Do the Frosh portend no more
hope for the three years ahead?
This is my own class but I must

disagree with its quasispokesman.
Doesn't the editor realize: that
tho freshman girls ai*e mere
"babes-in-the-woods" and need the
j protection of the wise social regu
, lations; that Mr. Naylor was
really expressing the wish, even
j though repressed, of the Stanford
; community; that Miss Stephen's
antics might have a logical explan
ation, say like indigestion; that
| the GCC was obviously formed
: primarly to help those Farmers,
whoever they were; that off
campus issues are off-campus
issues; and that frosh males
• should be studying and not so
: cializing anyway.
■ Finally, the editor fails to rec
| ognize the real issues: Senior
I class campus domination, token
; coeducation, and off-cam p us
| frosh apartments.
Sincerely,
F. K. Eslnnan

Dear 3liss(?) Editor:
Who does F. R. Eshman think
he is kidding? Anybody knows
that he couldn't have read this
morning's editorial in time to get
a letter in for publication, partic*
j ularly since it is common knowl
edge that all'letters to the editor
must be in to the Daily office by
four a.m. the day after publica
! tions.
And further what does he mean
; the frosh dollies arc just "babes
; in the woods"? Anybody in his
i right mind knows that no Stan
ford woman does anything at all
i in the woods, social regulation or
| not. Moreover, has he ever con
sidered that the campus might
have its own reaction to Miss
Steffen's indigested editorship,
like nausea?
Even without Eshman's ridicu
lous criticisms the editorial leaves
quite a bit to be desired. What
does he 1 mean "We're all loose in
Wonderland"? It is quite common
knowledge among all Stanford
men that whatever the Frosh Dol
lies may be—intelligent, talented,
modest, ugly—they are not loose,
whether in Wonderland or Oak
land or even Disneyland. How
lacking in perception can you be.
On the whole, I found the fresh
man editor's editorial rather
sophomorie in its outlook. Per
haps if he would respect the views
of some of his seniors (and per
haps even his juniors), he might
graduate from the level of under
classed opinions expressed in this
morning's editorial.
Punsively,
it. F. Esciimaim

Editor, the Daily:
We think that this edition of
the Stanford Daily is probably
the finest piece of journalism the
West Coast has ever seen —
mainly because it looks like it
came from the East Coast!
