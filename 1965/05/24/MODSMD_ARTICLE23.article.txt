## SEX and the Wilbur Parking Lot

It takes the average Freshman
male about three or four weeks
I to adjust to the lull significance
of Stanford's most outstanding
| social phenomena- the fantastic
j Stanford Ratio. Fantastic if you
1 happen to be one of the Frosh
i dollies • hustled - by - all • the -
studs • from - the - row. or one
, of a growing phenomena known
rather imprecisely as the Paly
! High Girl.
Actually a very small percent
i age of these creamy complexioned
j beauties come from Palo Alto
High. Many represent such insti
tutions as Belmont, San Carlos,
j Los Altos, Crystal Springs, Notre
j Dame, Horny Cross and others.
However, they all have one thing
in common every last one
; cruises into the Wilbur parking
lot, accompanied by two or three
| friends and inquires of the three
or four freshmen who are stand
ing around like long-horned eat
! tie, if there is a party here to
; night.
Always a Party
Invariably there is, in either
I Arroyo or Junipero—but even if
i there isn't somebody can always
; put on the Beatles and then there
! is. Once the music starts the gum
j chewing lovelies all hug the walls
; and quickly can he divided into
three groups, all of which bear
deeper study.
First, there is the PHG who sits
j there with her tongue hanging
out and her purse full of quar-
I ters and cigarettes (the latter of
i which she coughs on), waiting to
j dance with anything in trousers,
j or even to go out to her mother's
| station wagon in the lot and dis
! cuss politics with this entity in
, pants after a couple dances of
j warming up.
The second type of PHG is the
most common and the most dif
j ficult to understand and tolerate
particularly after having been
away from the affection of the
I "Girl-Back-Home" for about a
I month. This individual stations
herself along the wall and looks
as inviting in her green stockings
as Irma la Douce. She too will
i dance with almost anything in
trousers, although it helps if the
j anything looks rather studly.
However, she will dance only two
or three times at the most with
; one person obviously desiring to
j spread herself around. Moreover,
any mention of her mother's sta-
S tion wagon and political discus
i sions brings about a change in
j climate, usually condusive to a
; polar bear.
Oscar Meyer Fan
The third variety of PHG is
perhaps the least common and
naturally the best looking. She
comes into the room, finds a seat
on the couch and just sits there.
If someone asks her to dance,
she impolitely refuses from her
throne; if someone gets tired of
this routine and tells her to go
somewhere, she is grossly in
sulted at his audacity to speak
to someone so "class" as she, who
condescends to raise herself to
I lie same level as a well-bred
streetwalker. No one really knows
why she comes or what she does
over in the dark corner, but ru-1
mor has it that Oscar Meyer is j
using it for a promotional gim
mick.
Eventually, by the end of win
ter quarter the fascination that
freshmen males have for these
PHG's and there dehorning abili
ties wears off with the wonders
of Rush and Fraternities and
Liquor. Then another phenomena
manifests itself.
This is the innocent little dar
ling, affectionately nick-named
"Tree Stump" or some other des
criptive title, who comes around
on weekends and literally begs
innocent men who are watching
the "War of the World's" on the
tube, or booking in the House Li
brary for their math mid-term
again to come out to her mother's
station wagon to discuss politics.
I »ut since the guys have generally
had enough run-ins with Univer
sity regulations regarding such
actions between unmarried stu
dents on campus, the poor little j
PHG's must retreat to "no-class"
PHB's or into the dark corners
until Fall springs up another rich
harvest of horns, I
