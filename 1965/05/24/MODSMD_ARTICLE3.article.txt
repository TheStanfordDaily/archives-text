### BRUCE BURTON 
Special to The Stanford Daily
Increased student aelivism does
not mean that today's generation
is "croing to the dogs." President
J. Wallace Sterling told a day
long alumni conference Saturday.
Speaking on the theme, "A New-
Look at 1081 forces and ideas
shaping the future," Sterling said
that some students "may appear
pretentious or very impatient
with the processes of change, but
1 do not worry about their qual
ity and their basic integrity."
Sterling defended student activ
ism which, he said, questions
basic American problems: "The
students see behind the prosper
ity and find materialism, poverty
amidst plenty, military spending
and unfilled pledges of equal op
portunity, and challenge the sys
tem that maintains it."
He thought it a welcome sign
thai students "question the moral
values of why these conditions
are permitted to exisl.
"Most believe in the need of
moral commitments" and when
they speak out they do so "in
language that speaks of values."
he said.
Students are "activists but no
agitators." and they are "not just
agitating for the sake of agita
tion."
Sterling lcels that the present
generation "is not going to the
flogs." but that it is "an exciting
cross section of our best young
men and women.
"1 am not worried about the
quality and integrity of today's
students. I worry about what to
do about their education how to
provide it and improve it."
