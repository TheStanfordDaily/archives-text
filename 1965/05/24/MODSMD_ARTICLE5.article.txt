VISTA, Volunteers in Service
to America, has been called the
domestic Peace Corps. II is one
of I lie three major programs on
the War on Poverty. Volunteers
live and work in city slums, de
pressed areas, migrant worker
camps and Indian reservations to
bridge what the government Of
fice of Economics calls the "wid
ening gulf between the haves and
the have-nots."
Anyone over the age of 18 may
volunteer for ;i term of one year.
Volunteers are trained for six
weeks before going into the field
by living and working in com
munities like those they will be
serving. Volunteers are paid a
subsistence wage, and live under
the same conditions as the poor
they are helping. After the train
ing program, they are expected to
continue learning about the life
of tho poor by being part of it.
VISTA representatives will lie
here today, tomorrow and Wed
nesday to discuss what VISTA is
doing and what still needs to be
done. People able to begin train
ing in June or July and who file
applications while the VISTA rep
resentatives are on campus will
be notified in two weeks whether
they have been accepted. A fif
teen minute VISTA film will be
shown continuously in room 274
at Tresideer from 1-6 p.m. all
three days.
Said President Johnson to the
first twenty VISTA volunteers,
"Your pay will be low and the
conditions of your labor will
often be difficult. But you will
have the satisfaction of leading a
great national effort, and you will
have the ultimate reward which
comes 1o those who serve their
nation and who serve their fellow
man."
Ivxtenl of Poverty
According to the government
office of Economic Opportunity
there are 35 million Americans,
one fifth of the population, living
in poverty. Communities of or
ganizations which have projects
to strike at the toots of poverty,
may request VISTA volunters to
carry out their projects. There
are 142 volunteers in the field
now, and will be 2,000 by the end
of the summer. The projects vary
from a community development
project in rural Kentucky to help
ing narcotics addicts and alco
holics in Harlem.
The material advances may be
small, but the intangible rewards
are significant. One volunteers in
a depressed Appalacian area
writes the experience is "most
frustrating. People think I am
here to get them a blacktopped
road and a graded school. They
are disappointed a bit when I try
to substitute a less important
project like new outhouses and
the roestablishment of 4-H and
PTA."
To the question of what mi
grant farm workers can do with
their children all day. another
VISTA volunteer provided an
answer. Meeting with the mother,
she registered ."59 Mexican-Ameri
can children in English classes
and recruited fifteen high school
girls to help teach the classes.
Volunteers are expected to find
new ways to help the poor fight
poverty. Depending on where he
is serving, the volunteer may
have great individual freedom.
The director of the organization,
either public or private, who re
quested the volunteer also super
vises his activities. Thus, the de
gree of supervision varies from
project to project.
