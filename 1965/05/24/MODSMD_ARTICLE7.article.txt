# CARRIAGES REFURBISHED
## Do-Anything Man Restores Antique 1890 No-Motor Cars Owned by Leland Stanford 
### HENRY FORD 
Special to The Stanford
Some of the horseless carriages
which formerly belonged to Sen
ator and Mrs. Lelanrl Stanford
will be restored this year by a
master craftsman.
Joe Mankin, senior lab tech
nician in the Department of Phar
macology has been loaned the
four carriages in order to rebuild
them for use in historical occa
sions throughout the state. They
will probably be returned perma
nently to become a part of Stan
ford's historical collections.
The first carriage to be re
stored will be the one in which
President and Mrs. Benjamin Har
rison rode when they visited the
campus in 1891. This was six
months before the opening of the
University on October 1.
Mankin, whose work consists
largely of building that equip
ment and those lab accessories
(metaJ, wood, glass, plastic)
which cannot be bought, is re
ferred to as "the man who can do
anything . . . and usually does."
He heard about the carriages
which have been stored on cam
pus for a number of years, and
interested in anything relating to
the "Gold Rush" period in Cali
fornia. worked out an agreement
with the University. Pieces and
parts of the four carriages will
probably be combined into three
complete rest Orations.
Mankin developed his taste for
early California history in Tuolu
mne County where he has main
tained a retreat near the restored
"Gold Rush" town of Columbia.
