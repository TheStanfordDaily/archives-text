# Stanford Jazz Year To Open in October
## 
### 
Jazz —
—in quantity and quality—will invade the
campus next year as the "Stanford Jazz Year
(>">-66" gets underway with nine months of
concerts, lectures, films and exhibits.
Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, and Duke
Ellington will headline the fall concert pro
gram beginning in October. More than 50
other jazz artists, critics, and scholars are
scheduled to appear during the school year.
The project, the first major Stanford pro
gram to be originated and developed entirely
by students, is headed by junior Rick Bale
and a committee of students working with the
Board of Tresidder Union.
Ralph J. Gleason, jazz expert and columnist
with the San Francisco Chronicle, is a con
sultant.
Big, Thorough and Broad
"Nothing as big, as thorough, and as broad
as this project has ever been undertaken in
any academic community across the country,"
Gleason commented.
"The entire project will be aimed at a lay

audience and not the jazz fan," Bale empha
sized. "We hope to draw many students who
are curious and have not been exposed to jazz
before."
Six concerts, scheduled throughout the year,
will feature today's finest jazz artists repre
senting a variety of school and styles.
Presented on Sunday afternoons, the fall
and spring concerts will be held in Frost
Amphitheater. During the winter, concerts will
be presented in Memorial Auditorium.
"We hope to establish an informal festival
type of atmosphere during the concerts," Bale
explained. "The Sunday afternoon timing
should lend itself well to this objective."
"The educational side to jazz," according to
Bale, "will bo presented in a lecture series
which will trace the history and evolution
of jazz and discuss additional topics from tech
niques and musical structure to economic and
racial problems."
Hentoff, Gleason, Feather
Such well-known jazz experts as Nat Hent
off, Gleason and Leonard Feather are sched

uled for the planned talks, workshops, lecture
concerts and panel discussions.
Aimed primarily at the Stanford community
and not the outside public, the lectures will
Jhave an informal format. One suggested
method of presentation, which Billy Taylor
will use, is a lecture-concert, duiing which
time he will both speak and play the piano.
During the fall the project will concentrate
on the evolution and development of jazz
through the 3930\s as follows:

The lecturer series will include such names
as Ira Gilter, former New York editor of

Theory and Exploration
Spring will take the project into a more
theoretical and exploratory realm. Renowned

movement. Ralph Gleason will discuss the role
of the jazz critic.
Students are presently negotiating with such
artists as Stan Gctz, Dave Brubeck and Miles
Davis for the spring concerts.
The exhibit series will feature jazz influ
ences in painting and poetry, and films and
jazz scores will be shown.
"I'm convinced if this project is not a crash
ing success there is absolutely no hope for
the American way of life," Gleason jokingly
commented.

with the San Francisco Chronicle, is a con

Big, Thorough and Broad
"Nothing as big, as thorough, and as broad
as this project has ever been undertaken in
any academic community across the country,"
Gleason commented.
"The entire project will be aimed at a lay

audience and not the jazz fan," Bale empha
sized. "We hope to draw many students who
are curious and have not been exposed to jazz
before."
Six concerts, scheduled throughout the year,
will feature today's finest jazz artists repre
senting a variety of school and styles.
Presented on Sunday afternoons, the fall
and spring concerts will be held in Frost
Amphitheater. During the winter, concerts will
be presented in Memorial Auditorium.
"We hope to establish an informal festival
type of atmosphere during the concerts," Bale
explained. "The Sunday afternoon timing
should lend itself well to this objective."
"The educational side to jazz," according to
Bale, "will bo presented in a lecture series
which will trace the history and evolution
of jazz and discuss additional topics from tech
niques and musical structure to economic and
racial problems."
Hentoff, Gleason, Feather
Such well-known jazz experts as Nat Hent
off, Gleason and Leonard Feather are sched

uled for the planned talks, workshops, lecture
concerts and panel discussions.
Aimed primarily at the Stanford community
and not the outside public, the lectures will
Jhave an informal format. One suggested
method of presentation, which Billy Taylor
will use, is a lecture-concert, duiing which
time he will both speak and play the piano.
During the fall the project will concentrate
on the evolution and development of jazz
through the 3930\s as follows:
During the fall the project will concentrate

through the 1930's as follows:
• Oct. 4—"Jazz and American Society,"
Ralph Gleason.
• Oct. 10—Louis Armstrong performance in
Frost Amphitheater.
• Oct. 11—"Origins and Definitions," Mar
shall Stearns, director of the New York Insti
tute of Jazz Studies.
• Oct. 18—"Jazz in the Twenties: New Or

leans," Phil Elwood, director of KPFA jazz
programming.
• Oct. 25—'"Tile Swing Era," John Ham
mond, Columbia Records executive.
• Oct. 31—Double Concert in Frost featur
ing Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington.
• Nov. 8- "Jazz Techniques," Bill Taylor,
jazz pianist, writer and disc jockey.
The exhibits during the fall will trace the
history of jazz from Africa through the Swing
Era. Four films on early jazz themes will
also be shown.
Winter Program Schedule
During the winter months, jazz history will
be traced from 1940 to the present, and nego
tiations are underway for the appearance of
such artists as John Coltrane, Thelonius
Monk and the Modern Jazz Quartet.
The lecturer series will include such names
as Ira Gilter, former New York editor of
Downbeat; John Lewis, leader of the Modern
Jazz Quartet; Jon Hendricks, jazz singer and

former member of the famous jazz trio, "Lam
bert, Hendricks, and Ross."
The exhibit and film series will again com
plement the concerts and lectures with themes
of modern jazz.
Theory and Exploration
Spring will take the project into a more
theoretical and exploratory realm. Renowned
author and critic Nat Hentoff will lead panels
on the economics of jazz and the avant-garde
movement. Ralph Gleason will discuss the role
of the jazz critic.
Students are presently negotiating with such
artists as Stan Gctz, Dave Brubeck and Miles
Davis for the spring concerts.
The exhibit series will feature jazz influ
ences in painting and poetry, and films and
jazz scores will be shown.
"I'm convinced if this project is not a crash
ing success there is absolutely no hope for
the American way of life," Gleason jokingly
commented.
Jazz —
—in quantity and quality—will invade the
campus next year as the "Stanford Jazz Year
(>">-66" gets underway with nine months of
concerts, lectures, films and exhibits.
Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, and Duke
Ellington will headline the fall concert pro
gram beginning in October. More than 50
other jazz artists, critics, and scholars are
scheduled to appear during the school year.

audience and not the jazz fan," Bale empha
sized. "We hope to draw many students who
are curious and have not been exposed to jazz
before."
Six concerts, scheduled throughout the year,
will feature today's finest jazz artists repre
senting a variety of school and styles.
Presented on Sunday afternoons, the fall
and spring concerts will be held in Frost
Amphitheater. During the winter, concerts will
be presented in Memorial Auditorium.
"We hope to establish an informal festival
type of atmosphere during the concerts," Bale
explained. "The Sunday afternoon timing
should lend itself well to this objective."
"The educational side to jazz," according to
Bale, "will bo presented in a lecture series
which will trace the history and evolution
of jazz and discuss additional topics from tech
niques and musical structure to economic and
racial problems."
Hentoff, Gleason, Feather
Such well-known jazz experts as Nat Hent
off, Gleason and Leonard Feather are sched

uled for the planned talks, workshops, lecture
concerts and panel discussions.
Aimed primarily at the Stanford community
and not the outside public, the lectures will
Jhave an informal format. One suggested
method of presentation, which Billy Taylor
will use, is a lecture-concert, duiing which
time he will both speak and play the piano.
During the fall the project will concentrate
on the evolution and development of jazz
through the 3930\s as follows:

movement. Ralph Gleason will discuss the role

Students are presently negotiating with such
artists as Stan Gctz, Dave Brubeck and Miles
Davis for the spring concerts.
The exhibit series will feature jazz influ

"I'm convinced if this project is not a crash
ing success there is absolutely no hope for
the American way of life," Gleason jokingly
commented.
