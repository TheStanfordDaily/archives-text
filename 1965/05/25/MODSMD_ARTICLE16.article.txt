The acrid and somewhat redundant logomachy lhat always seems
I to follow a skirmish between Stern residents and campus greeks
! really does not do Stanford justice.
A free university in a free society, after all, demands impec-;
! cable scholarship, and ils sense of mission is only diverted by irra
tional, emotional reactions to sensitive issues.
I-Icnce, I would like to make public a hitherto private interview
with Prof. J. T. Fullblight, XIV, chief fraternity strategist on the
campus and learned Stemologist, whose famous pamphlet "Myths
and Banalities: A Third Look" is already considered a classic in
conflict analysis.
QUESTION: Dr. Fullblight, what do you see as being at stake in
the continued Cold War between Stern and the fraternities?
FULLBLIGHT: One cannot be too careful in defining the enemy
which fraternities face on campus. It is more, to be sure, than a
simple matter of turning back what I like to call the "Bodies, Ata- 1
I vistic, Turkeyist Conspiracy."
j We must look deeper into the methodology of conflict and dis-
Ipense with the facile answers of the past; we must understand!
! the enemy in a sophisticated, modern sense -disposing of old myths. ,
QUESTION: What are the myths to which you refer?
FULLBLIGHT: First of all, of course, there is a tendency on our
side to look at the enemy as a vastmonoliih, and not recognize
i the subtle nuances and differences of opinion which have developed
! in his own camp during the last few years due to a new maturity
' in his ideology.
For instance, it would be a mistake to deal with the Fremont, Tito
ist-jock in the same way as the Donner hard-liner.
QUESTION: What are the main divisions in opinion in Stern
i Hall.
FULLBLIGHT: First, there is the hard-line. "Vanguard of the
! Stern proletariat" segment, which seeks through revolutionary vio
| lence to dissolve our elite fraternity system, and which is best
i symbolized perhaps by Lassen's House President reportedly pointing
toward the new clusters at an IHC meeting and shouting "We will l
bury you."
Second, there is the soft-line, "peaceful coexistence" group, which
is attempting to achieve temporary detente, and which has intro-;
| duced some fraternity-like social incentives into their House organ
izations. It cautions Stern patiently wait until fraternities "drop, like
' a ripe fruit, into our hands."
Last there is the middle of the road, "Frankly, I'm ambivalent" j
sector. It seeks no wider war.

QUESTION: Aren't there cracks within your bloc, as well?
FULLBLIGHT: Certainly. But we've always had our problems in
that regard. The Beta Chi-Fabians boring from within are
only one manifestation.
We also have a hard-line, namely the "One man—one ding" people,
and a sofi line. "Give me your tired and your poor" element. More
over, we periodically uncover some insurgents and policy saboteurs
who do us great harm.
QUESTION: Who are these infiltrators? What do they do?
FULLBLIGHT: Mostly they're dedicated, conscious agents of the
Turkeyist conspiracy. They amble up innocently from Stern, get a
bid, take a so-called second look (after they've swiped some of our
secrets) and«depledge.
As you know. I am also chairman of the IFC Secrets Committee;
let me tell you, there were some songs and handshakes we thought
Stern wouldn't get for 30 years. They got them in a quarter!
QUESTION 1 : What role do the so-called "noncommitted" groups
play on this campus: namely, the eating clubs.
FULLBLIGHT: Well, from my point of view, they too often take
a pro-Turkeyist view, although they would seem to have a lot to
gain by aligning with us.
The fraternities, in this battle for men's minds, must now and
then offer assistance to such underdeveloped parts of the campus.
Turkeyism is foreign to their nature, but unless we give them
assistance they might drift slowly and ineluctably into its clutches.
QUESTION: Finally, sir, what are the chances, as you view them,
of achieving some viable detente, a general lessening of tensions
throughout the campus?
FULLBLIGHT: VVe must never give up seeking routes to lasting
peace. As long, of course, as they do not jeopardize our privileged
elite status.
There exist hopeful signs for us, both in the revisionist-deviation
ist inter-Turkey squabble, and the new maturity which has informed
the dormitories on campus!
A most important one has to be the beating down of the old-line,
hard-line Turkevics who tried to get out of paying their House dues
in Donnor House this quarter. This is a very encouraging overture.
Also, there's the sign, in many Houses, of adopting more and
more practices alien to pure Turkeyist theory; i.e., beer parties,
crude movies, and so forth. Blue jackets are even beginning to
flourish in some of the more progressive corners of Stern Hall.
QUESTION: Is, then, the fraternity system past the crisis point
in tiie conflict?
FULLBLIGHT: No one can say for sure. But, aware that the rest
of the campus continues to be out after us, we can never be too
careful.
With luck, we can yet save this campus from a disastrous con
clamation.
Or from something even worse: the slavery of atavistic Turkeyism.
