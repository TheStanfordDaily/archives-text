Klan likes to claim it dominates. He also promised to open all pub

• Unsealed Communist Mail Permitted
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court struck down yesterday a law
permitting the government to intercept and destroy unsealed Com
munist mail from abroad unless the addressee asked in writing to
receive it.
Justice William O. Douglas, speaking for an 8-0 court, said this
law placed on the addressee an unconstitutional "affirmative burden
which we do not think the government can impose."
"The regime of this act," Douglas added, "is at war with the 'un
inhibited, robust, and wide-open' debate and discussions that are
contemplated by the first amendment."
