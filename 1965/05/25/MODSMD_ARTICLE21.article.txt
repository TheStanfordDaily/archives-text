# A 						Long Way from L.A.
## 
### 
Two months ago, in an address to the L.A.
alumni, President Sterling complained, "Even
though one may have sympathy for the ideals
of these (student) activists, it is not always easy
to comprehend them . .
it may not be easy, indeed, but President Ster
ling has obviously made an concerted effort to
do so; and three days ago, in a speech to the Bay
Area alumni, he demonstrated a new and posi
tive understanding of "these activists" and a
perceptive and appreciative grasp of the ideal
istic and moral sources of their dissent.
We've come a long way from L.A. — and the
journey, thus far, has been most heartening.
Among the most welcome additions to Ster
ling's Saturday address—his finest, in our mem
ory—was a passage in which he corrected, with
admirable candor, some misrepresentations of
the position of Stanford's GCC which he made
in his L.A. speech—and which the Daily had chal
lenged in a March 4 editorial ("On To Tippe
rary.")
The President told the Bay Area alums, "When
1 spoke ut the Alumni Conference in Orange
County and in Los Angeles ... I cited some
statements attributed to various spokesmen of
the Graduate Coordinating Committee as to
the Committee's philosophy and goals. 1 cited
these in good faith, believing them to be based
on accurate reports.
"Since then, he continued, "in not less than
four hours conversation with a representative of
the (GCC), I have been advised that the report
was not accurate and that, therefore, the state
ments I cited constituted misrepresentation. In

these same conversations I have attempted to
acquire information wliich would enable me to
correct misrepresentations. 1 now attempt to
make that correction."
The president continued to make a scrupulous
point by point correction of each questionable
attribution contained in his L.A. speech. He con
cluded by saying, "I appreciate having this op
portunity to correct in public such misrepresenta
tions as I made in public."
This last line is pjirticularly welcome in that it
reveals the essential understanding that where
distortion is public (as it was in the Presidents
L.A. speech) private apology is insufficient.
In this instance, too, the GCC and its spokes
man are also to be commended for their re
straint in the midst of an unpleasant situation
and their willingness to maintain discussions
without show of bitterness.
For bitterness—particularly the bitterness that
misrepresentation promotes— is one commodity j
which the university can ill afford. It was for this
reason that we so profoundly regretted the Presi
dent's comments in L.A. And it is for this reason
that we so happily note his correction of those
comments this Saturday.
Students and administrators have too long
labored under the onus ol misrepresentation and
mutual mistrust—and there yet exist many long
lived distortions that must be publically de
stroyed before a true entente is possible.
We sincerely hope, therefore, that President
Sterling's recently demonstrated willingness to
correct—where correction is demanded—will
stand as an example for future conduct within
this University community.

ments I cited constituted misrepresentation. In

these same conversations I have attempted to
acquire information wliich would enable me to
correct misrepresentations. 1 now attempt to
make that correction."
The president continued to make a scrupulous
point by point correction of each questionable
attribution contained in his L.A. speech. He con
cluded by saying, "I appreciate having this op
portunity to correct in public such misrepresenta
tions as I made in public."
This last line is pjirticularly welcome in that it
reveals the essential understanding that where
distortion is public (as it was in the Presidents
L.A. speech) private apology is insufficient.
In this instance, too, the GCC and its spokes
man are also to be commended for their re
straint in the midst of an unpleasant situation
and their willingness to maintain discussions
without show of bitterness.
For bitterness—particularly the bitterness that
misrepresentation promotes— is one commodity j
which the university can ill afford. It was for this
reason that we so profoundly regretted the Presi
dent's comments in L.A. And it is for this reason
that we so happily note his correction of those
comments this Saturday.
Students and administrators have too long
labored under the onus ol misrepresentation and
mutual mistrust—and there yet exist many long
lived distortions that must be publically de
stroyed before a true entente is possible.
We sincerely hope, therefore, that President
Sterling's recently demonstrated willingness to
correct—where correction is demanded—will
stand as an example for future conduct within
this University community.
Two months ago, in an address to the L.A.
alumni, President Sterling complained, "Even
though one may have sympathy for the ideals
of these (student) activists, it is not always easy
to comprehend them . .
it may not be easy, indeed, but President Ster
ling has obviously made an concerted effort to
do so; and three days ago, in a speech to the Bay
Area alumni, he demonstrated a new and posi
tive understanding of "these activists" and a
perceptive and appreciative grasp of the ideal
istic and moral sources of their dissent.
We've come a long way from L.A. — and the
journey, thus far, has been most heartening.
Among the most welcome additions to Ster
ling's Saturday address—his finest, in our mem
ory—was a passage in which he corrected, with
admirable candor, some misrepresentations of
the position of Stanford's GCC which he made
in his L.A. speech—and which the Daily had chal
lenged in a March 4 editorial ("On To Tippe
rary.")
The President told the Bay Area alums, "When
1 spoke ut the Alumni Conference in Orange
County and in Los Angeles ... I cited some
statements attributed to various spokesmen of
the Graduate Coordinating Committee as to
the Committee's philosophy and goals. 1 cited
these in good faith, believing them to be based
on accurate reports.
"Since then, he continued, "in not less than
four hours conversation with a representative of
the (GCC), I have been advised that the report
was not accurate and that, therefore, the state
ments I cited constituted misrepresentation. In

these same conversations I have attempted to
acquire information wliich would enable me to
correct misrepresentations. 1 now attempt to
