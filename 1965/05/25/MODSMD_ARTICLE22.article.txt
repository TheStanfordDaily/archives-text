# A 						PARTING SHOT
## Stanford: Policy by Default 
### DANIEL SCHWARTZ 
Editor's note: The following is
the first of a series of "Parting
Shots" written by graduating Sen
iors who have spent much of their
last four years working with and
criticizing the University. These
articles are being written to pass
on some of the problems they still
see to th«' people who will be at
Stanford next year.
These are independent articles
and no one article is necessarily
the opinion of the other writers.
Also, these are in 110 way all the
appropriate articles that could be
written nor all the appropriate
people who could write them.

There has been at Stanford for
the last four years, a groat deal
of difficulty in determining ex
actly how policies are made and
who makes them. Partly because
of the specific individuals in
volved, and partly because of the
structure of the hierarchy, deci
sions seem to be made in a nebu
lous cloud of committees, admin
istrators and faculty. Only with
the recent establishment of the
office of a Dean of Undergraduate
Education has it been at all pos
sible to tell where "the buck
stops" ---- and then only in some
cases.
In fact, many decisions are
made almost unconsciously, with
out the real intent of making a j
policy decision. This widely used j
method can be called a kind of j
"policy by default" a decision |
being made because no one is |
making the decision.
This can best be exemplified in 1
the case of undergraduate resi j
dence policy, with particular con-1
corn for Freshman housing. When ;
an over-admittance of Freshmen
necessitated the placing of Fresh
man men in Stern, it was gen
erally assumed such an arrange
ment would bo only temporary.
Plans wore outlined for the fu-1
ture construction of a new addi-1
tion near Roble for the Branner |
surplus of Freshman women, and
Branner would be reconverted to
a Freshman men's residence.
Freshman Living
This was a kind of policy by
default. No attempt has been
made to measure tho respective
advantages or disadvantages be-:
tween the Wilbur and the Stern |
mode of Freshman living; no at-j
tempt has boon made to deter '

mine if it might bo better for
Freshmen women to all live in the
Branner rather than the Roble
area, if, in fact, they had to live
together.
The ideal characteristics of a
decision making process include
a determination of goals, a weigh
ing of different alternatives, and
a final and conscious choice of
those methods which will most
feasibly produce the desired re
sult. Most importantly, it includes
a constant rechecking of the ef
fectiveness of the decisions al
ready made. But this process is
time and again not followed here.
Decisions (such as where to put an
excess of Freshmen) are deter
mined by necessity and chance;
little attempt is made to relate
them to the general goals and
little attempt is made to mea
sure their effectiveness versus the
already existing programs.
The now faculty master plan
for Wilbur Hall seems to have
evolved in much the same man
ner. Neither the involved spon
sors nor faculty residents were
consulted in the hasty decision.
This is not to question the faculty
master plan but to ask that the
decision to initiate the program,
and the policies of the program
itself, be made carefully and con
sciously.
Faculty Committee
There has been a great deal of
improvement in this process in
tho last four years. Inclusion of
students on faculty committees
has added new viewpoints and
perspective. Hopefully, the pro
posed reorganization of the Dean's
office will lead to a greater abil
ity to get at the decision making
process and bring it out into the
open. But even the reorganization
of the Deans' office has been pro
posed without a properly careful
consideration of all alternatives or
an attempt to determine its ef
fectiveness in achieving tho goals
desired (if, in fact, the goals
have been defined). Neither were
concerned students or faculty
committees contacted.
Again this is not to criticize the
specific proposals, as such, sim
ply because they were made in a
haphazard and not altogether con
scious manner. This is to say that
decisions made incorrectly—often
by the very default to the deci
sion-have a greater chance of
being incorrect.
