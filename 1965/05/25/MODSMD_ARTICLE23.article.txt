## The
						Background of the Arab-Israeli Question 
### LAWRENCE de BIVORT 
In the late 19th century an
Austrian journalist, disturbed by
the anti-Semitic implications of
the Dreyfus Affair, developed his
thesis for the protection of the
Jewish people from persecution.
Theodore Herzl proposed that a
Jewish state be established with
legal rights over, and responsibil
ity for Jews the world over. They
would acquire, then, the same po
litical and diplomatic status and
protection as other 'foreign na
tionals'.
A new dimension was brought
to Herzl's thesis by a young Rus

sian-born Zionist, Chaim VVoiz
mann. Where Herzl believed that
ANY piece of land could effec
tively provide the Jewish home
land Weizmann claimed that
Zionism could only succeed in
getting the support of world
Jewry if the spiritual claims of
Judaism were employed in the
political task. According to Weiz
mann the spiritual could best be
harnessed if the projected home
land were Palestine. The rather
tenuous 'historical connection of
the Jews to Palestine, in fact lim
ited to a few ancient Hebrew
kingdoms of short duration, could

[ be parlayed into considerable po
j litical and emotional assets. The
j showdown on this inter-Zionist
controversy came when the Brit
ish offered the World Zionist Or
ganization the territory of Uganda
I (1909.). Weizmann won, the offer
i was rejected, and Zionism set
tled it's sights on Palestine where,
unsuspecting, the Arab inhabi
tants, mostly Muslims, some
Christion or Jewish, lived under
the Ottoman Empire.
Suez 'Wind-Pipe'
As World War I broke the Brit
ish cast about for allies against
their Ottoman enemies, and their

choice fell upon the Sharif Hus
sein, of Mecca — the Holy City of
Islam. A Holy War (Jihad), com
mitting all Muslims from Mor
rocco to the Phillippines to action
against the British, could hardly
be called by the Ottoman Sultan
if the Sharif opposed it, and if
he were to side against the Brit
tish the Suez Canal—the 'wind
pipe of the British Empire'—
would lie endangered.
With the full support of Fertile
Crescent Arabs Hussein de
manded, in return for his co
operation with, the British, full
independence for the Arab lands.
The final 'Pledge' (October 1915)
of full independence made by the
British contained a number of
exceptions, the most important be
ing the areas west of Aleppo,
Homs, Hana and Damascus or
which were not fully Arab, Pal
estine did not fall into this area,
or those areas in which Brit
ain's ally France had historical
claims of her own.
Sykes-Picot Treaty
A third committment: was un
dertaken in the form of the secret
Sykes-Pieot Treaty (1917") be
tween France and Britain. France
joined Britain in guaranteeing to
tal autonomy. The treaty would
have provided for the division of
the Middle East into French and
British spheres of interest.
Hussein and the other Arab
leaders, accustomed to the no
madic concepts of honor, gener
ally confined to trust the British
'Pledge/ The Zionists, well aware
of the nature of politics, under
stood the significance of the
Treaty and adjusted their tactics

i accordingly.
At San Remo (1920) the Middle
l East was mandated to France and
[ Britain. The Arabs began to pre
| pare for the independence that
was promised them in the Man
date and the Zionists began the
de facto build-up of their home
land by seeking political influ
| ence in Palestine, which was now
under British rule, and by en
j couraging as many Jews to im
migrate to Palestine as possible.
Jewish Immigration
As the Zionist pressures grew
| in Palestine the consequences and
| nature of the Zionist plans be
came increasingly apparent to
the Arab leaders and British au
thorities in Palestine. As the cri
sis developed through 1923-1938
I the British sought unsuccessfully
! to either provide a political solu
tion, or limit further Jewish im
migration.
A new and decisive factor was
injected into the Palestine prob
lem in 1938—when Hitler initia
ated his policies of Jewish exter
mination. The mass exodus of
European Jews forced the issue
of Jewish immigration into Pal
estine. The British authorities'
warnings that further immigra
tions would be disasterous went
unheeded in the wave of sympa
thy that went out to the Jewish
victims and refugees.
At the conclusion of World War
II the British announced that
they would relinquish their man
date in 1948, and that the future
of Palestine would be submitted
to the United Nations. In 1947 Ihe
United Nations adopted the reso
lution partitioning Palestine be
tween the Arabs and Zionists de
spite the de facto war being waged
between the two.
In this atmosphere of terror
and indecision the Zionists in Pal
estine declared themselves the
independent State of Israel (May
15th 1948 >. The Arab countries
responded by declaring war on
'Israel' and the new nation, which
was to survive the war, got off
to a start in the midst of sus
picion, bitterness and hatred. The
State had been established, but
at an extravagant cost. The cost
could well go higher.
