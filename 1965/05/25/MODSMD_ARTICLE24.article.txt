# Letters To The Editor
## Clarification of Evidence Asked 
### 
Editor, the Daily:
Your May 18 editorial stated
that Dr. James T. Watkins IV, a
professor of political science,
spread false rumors in the recent
student elections. The next day
a letter to the editor from a wit
ness, Lcith Anderson, confirmed
Ihe substance of your report. In
the same issue, Dr. Robert McAfee
Brown expressed his disapproval,
which I share, of the quality of
journalism in that editorial, and
requested that Dr. Watkins' side
of the story be presented. An
other letter in the same issue
also requested that Dr. Watkins
clarify his position.

Thus far, neither Dr. Watkins
nor any of his defenders have re
plied to the specific evidence
which you cited in support of your
charges, and which Mr. Ander
son's testimony appears to verify.
Although partisans of either
side may wish to express their
personal displeasure, and al
though some objections to the
Daily's manner of presentation are
in order, the subject matter of the
editorial certainly deserve pri
mary consideration. It all appears
so simple: Dr. Watkins can be
defended by a refutation of the
evidence and the presentation of
an as yet unprovided rationale for

his conduct. Arguments focused
on other aspects of the problem
can only be tangential. I too, look
for a clarification which deals
with the evidence.

Editor, The Daily:
Thanks for offering Professor
Watkins the opportunity of ans
wering your charges after they
had been printed. But isn't this a
case of shooting first and asking
questions later? How can Watkins
answer? He's already been assas
sinated! Michael H. Walsh
