# 'Debate' On Middle East Problems
## Israeli Calls For Peace Negotiation 
### 
Gideon Saguy, San Francisco
Consul for Israel, repeatedly
urged last night that the Arabs
and the Israelis "come down to
the peace negotiating table' for
discussion of the Arab-Israeli con
flict.
Saguy represented tlie point of
view of the state of Israel in the
first part of a two-day "debate" on
this unsolved problem of the Mid
dle East.
As a preface to his speech, he
pointed out that the program
would not be a real debate, since
he would not bo able to meet face
to face with the spokesman for
the Arab point of view.
Still at War
For political and diplomatic rea
sons, the lIR was unable to ar
range a meeting of the two men.
This is principally because the
two nations are officially still at
war.
Saguy began his speech by giv
ing a brief historical survey of the
conflict, which began in 1948 after
the United Nations resolved that
Palestine be divided into two
states, one for Jewish people and
the other for Arabs. In May of
1948 the state of Israel was born,
but the Arab state still does not
exist.
Disappointed at the fact that
a solution to the problem had not
been found so far, the Consul
added, "Here we are, 17 years
later without the peace that Israel
needs and that, I am sure, the
Arabs need."
Saguy spoke briefly on the Arab
refugee problem and on the Jor
dan River water project. Refer
ring to the former, he pointed out
that "the Arab nations around
Israel can easily absorb the ref
ugees."
Farouk Mawlawi, Director of
the Arab Information Bureau,
will present the views of the
Arab people tonight at 8 p.m. in
Trcsidder.
