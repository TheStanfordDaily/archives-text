# Scratch Sheet For 1965 Only Mildly Critical
## 
### DOUG OHMANS 
Bambi's mother once told him,!
j "If you can't say something nice,
j don't say anything at all." Edi
tor Doug Cushing and the ten j
' writers of .Scratch Short, 1965
; may have taken this approach J
too much to heart, but there are!
| some useful facts buried in the
ambiguous praise.
The Scratch Sheet is on sale j
(for forty cents at Engineering i
; Corner today and tomorrow.
According to Cushing, Scratch
Sheet, 1965 is an improvement
! over last year's because it "hon
estly evaluates courses instead
' of simply describing or sarcastic- (
j ally condemning them."
The selection often seems ran-:
jdom: the Scratch Sheet considers j
i seven economics courses and only j
one mathematics course; several)
very popular courses are over- !

looked entirely.
About 20of the people taking
each course were polled, and the
discussions are highly structured
by the questions asked. Many
courses are called "clear" and
"well organized," "worth recom
mending to a good friend." Most
are "stimulating" enough to cause
"intellectual growth." In one
course, "students are stimulated
an average amount."
Another criterion for evalua
tion occasionally shines through.
The Scratch Sheet analyzes one
course as follows: "The work
load is considered less than aver
age for the number of units. The
textbook is also rated highly."
The most popular courses are
apparently those which are well
organized and interesting. Popular
teachers are well-prepared and
interested. After painful criticism

of a course which lacks some of
these elements, the Scratch Sheet
adds reassuringly. "A few of I lie
students would recommend the
| course."
Scratch Sheet, 1965 is a collee
! tion of opinions on a random selec
tion of Stanford's most pleasant
i courses. And, it is mild.
