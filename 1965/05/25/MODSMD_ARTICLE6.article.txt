# THE 						MOST DANGEROUS GAME
## Osborne Cites LSD Dangers 
### 
For students fascinated with the phe
nomenon of consciousness-expansion, self
conducted experimentation with psyche
delic drugs like LSD, morning glory seeds
and mescaline would seem to be the latest
parlor game. But, according to Dr. Maurice
Osborne of the Stanford student health
service, when persons untrained in the use
of psychedelic drugs decide to conduct their
own research, the "game" they play is a
type of Russian roulette.
Because so much is still unknown about
the effect of LSD and other drugs on spec
ial individuals under special circumstances,
the outcome of a dosage can never be pre
dicted. Some individuals do indeed experi
ence the exhilarating "consciousness expan
sion" of a totally new and different level of
existence.
Others do not. It they are lucky, those
who fail merely get violently nauseated.
The unlucky ones go through horrible per
iods of anxiety and depression. Sometimes
the after effects last for months and even
years. Certain individuals may never re
cover.
These are the risks of LSD.
Of course, when research and experimen
tation is conducted under carefully con
trolled conditions by competent personnel,
the risks involved are greatly reduced. But.
as T>r. Osborne points out. the type of LSD
u.c thai Stanford tudenti are most lik'"'v
to come in contact \utli the amateur,
semi-secret variety.

Although LSD may not legally be sold in
ihe United States except through approved
channels, and although law enforcement
agents have recently cracked down on the
sale of LSD, it is still relatively easy I<>
obtain supplies of psychadelic drugs. Berke
ley is probably the main supply source.
Use of drugs is usually in a group situa
tion. Many persons are introduced to psy
chadelic drugs via a friend who glibly hands
out samples 1o everyone he knows. Several
instances are known at Stanford where
members of a fraternity joined in a type
of group experimentation. Usually at least
some of the "newcomers" become violently
ill. Sometimes students become scared by
unexpected results and go to ihe Health
Sendee for help.
Numbers Unknown
When asked about the per cent of Stan
ford students who now use or have tried
consciousness expanding drugs. Dr. Os
borne pointed out that since the Health
Service only has contact with students who
come to it voluntarily, it is impossible for
the University to make a valid estimate.
He states that in some circles of students
the use is no doubt very high and may
even form a basis of group acceptance. In
other groups of students, the use is nil
Pr. Osborne did. however, quest ioji tlw
|.iteni"nt on the u.'' of 'h 11 ;'. b,\ Stanford
:-tudeuU which appeared in the March 12
1965 issue of Time magazine.

Gerald L. Klerman, Clinical Associate in
Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School,
was quoted as saying that "10 per cent of
the students at such large urban universi
ties as Harvard. Stanford, California's
Berkeley campus are chronic users." Since
no type of campus-wide survey on the use
of drugs has ever been made at Stanford,
Dr. Osborne feels that it would be extreme
ly difficult for anyone to estimate the num
ber of users.
Klerman Agrees
Evidently Dr. Klerman himself agrees.
Shortly after the article a pea red in Time,
he sent a note to President Sterling apol
ogizing for the statement accredited to him
and explaining that a reporter who had in
terviewed him had misrepresented his
views.
According In Dr. Klerman, "1 feel th.it the
estimate of 10 per cent of students at Stan
ford being chronic users is a gross exag
geration. My own personal opinion is that
although there are indications that there
has been an increase in experimentation by
students with various drugs, including
marijuana, in recent years, the extent of
such use is very small and is being grossly
exaggerated by the press and other
groups."
