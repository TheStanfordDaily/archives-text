# Winbigler Discusses Reforms
## ‘Vested Interest’ Acknowledged 
### 
Prospects for more liberal Ad
ministration-Trustee action in ac
cordance with student demands
depend largely on the Board's con
sideration of Stanford's "other cli
entele,'' Dean of Students H. Don
ald Winbigler told a Tresidder
Union audience last night.
By "other clientele," Winbigler
1 continued, he meant "parents, fac
ulty, alumni, community — any
lof the vested interests that might
be affected by a decision."
The Dean's scheduled lecture on
"The Role of the Student in the
; Stanford Community" in Tresid
ider's large lounge became, at his
request, a quest ion-and-answer
j session with the audience of about
fifteen students.
Liquor and Open House
Winbigler was immediately
I challenged on alleged injustices
in the administration's liquor and
j open house policies.
Answering charges that the pol
| icy of twiee-a-week open houses in
jail men's residences was both an
(anachronism and an unjustifiable
restriction, the Dean emphasized
[the progress that had been made:
"Ten years ago we didn't even
i have open houses." He added, "The
; matter is not that simple. We have
j minority rights (i.e. students
against liberalization) and vested
interests to consider.
"Social change is a slow, pains
taking process," he added, "often
I much slower-moving than indi
viduals who favor change would
like."
Legality and Enforcement
Winbigler replied to criticism
iof liquor prohibition in university
residences by citing problems of
legality and enforcement.
|
"It's unreasonable," he said, "to
expect that a policy of limiting
student drinking to those over
21, who are living side by side
with minors in th<* dorms, would
be feasible."
