• Clay M ins in One Hound
LEWISTON, Mo. — Heavyweight champion
Cassius Clay retained his title tonight by
knocking out Sonny Liston with a short right
to the jaw in the first round of their 15-
rounder last night.
There was confusion in the ring and boos
rang out.
The short right dropped List on on his back.
He was there for several seconds and tried to
rise. He got partially up and then fell fully
to the canvas again.
Joe Walcott, the referee, could not hear the
timekeeper's count. So when Liston arose the
two fighters went at each other. Then there
was signalling from the timekeeper. Walcott
rushed to the fighters, separated them and de
clared Clay the knockout winner. Boos rang
out in the arena.
