Irving Grossmami, somewhat depressed and with an expression
! of gossamer indifference, slowly maneuvered his sandals over to
the sports desk and sat down.
"What's the matter, Irving?" [ asked, "You haven't displayed
I such a sulking visage since we first began to defoliate the VC."

"Well," Irving sighed heavily,<
j "this might be my last visit for a 1
while. The "Don't Count To Ten
—OBJURGATE!" Society, of
i which I must say I'm the most tal
ented raver or rather was—the'
; most talented raver— elected a
I new head."
"A little bad luck for your side,
i Irving?" 1 said.
"Tubed!" Irving exclaimed, j
j "Also purged."
"Why would someone purge a 1
i lovable fellow like you, Irving?
i And such a talented raver."
The Great Purge
"Mostly politics. Also since I've
I concentrated mostly on peace-j
i marching, the leader being mostly j
a vocal raver, though my back-'
I ground too limited. Bui the real
I reason I stopped in was to ask
I you, now that you've finished
| quite a few issues as Sports Edi
! tor, whether you've been able to
' develop a viable philosophy of
j sport."
"Frankly, Irving," I had to ad
: mit, "my philosophy of sports is
1 not to have a philosophy of,
sports; some of the most succu
lent pleasures of life," I added in
a somewhat profound tone, "are j
perceived by experience and not
by analylical thought, are enjoyed
rather than studied."
Irving appeared boggled.
"That sounds somewhat anti
intellectual to mo." Irving re
torted, "give me an example."
"Oh, a football game, a con
frontation with the supernatural,
a Daily editorial, a good peace!
march," I improvised.
"Some of our best peace mar
ches have been pretty spontane
ous," Superactivist admitted. "Bui
isn't sports and sportswriting
mostly ihe collection of statistics
and analysis to be printed in the
i sports pages of newspapers?"
Sports Is Not a PE Course
"Too often, I fear, too often.
But sports is not a one unit PE
course on the rules and regula
tions of official Water Polo, nor
a six point summary of averages,
and records, and prospects for the
future."
"What is it then? Irving loyally!
asked, in order that our Socratic
dialogue might continue.
"At best, it is played and en-;
joyed; at worst ii is analyzed,

thereby*raping it of its spontane
ity and vigor by facile analyses
and many limes a faulty diagno
i sis of strategy.
"Mens sana in corpore sano
a sound mind in a sound body—
hoary old Latin aphorism that it.
is, expresses the legitimate pur
pose of a collegiate athletic pro
gram. Playing something, espe-
I cially willi sumeone of approxi
mately equal ability, contesting
with all powers of mind, fabric,
and coordination. Sans only moral
i indignation."
"Sounds rather extreme," he
I said, stroking his beard pen
j sively."
"You mean leaving out moral
indignation?" I asked.
"Well, that, and also just gen
erally extreme. Isn't there any
! middle ground?" I mean, every-
I one isn't a jock."
'.. "Certainly, Irving. Which is
the main reason we have high
powered intercollegiate competi
tion. The main reason, that is,
; save admissions receipts. Best,
athletics is played. Next best, it
is spectated upon. Its enjoyment
! becomes vicarious "but still not
I intellectually."
Experiential, Si.; Intellectual, No!
"Still not intellectual?" Irving's
j face brightened.
"No. Irving," I said, "mostly ex
periential."
"But doesn't every sportswriter
have a license to analyze at will;
! for what else is he a sports
! writer?"
"In some cases, Irving," I said,
; "should be revoked. The best
sportswriter is one who is more
worried about entertaining his
audience, about conveying to
them a slice of amusement and
excitement of a. game, and about
opportunities for best — play
ing, and - next best spectating
at various sports than one, than
i one. ..."
"Than one who gets bogged
down in a maze of sports jargon
land thoughtless analysis?" Irv
-1 ing veritably beamed with under
! standing.
"Irving," I said, "I think you're
becoming ambivalent."
Irving smiled and got up to
! leave. "If only Ihe new head of
1 the "Don't Count To Ten OB
| JURGATE" society were."
"Well, take heart. Irving," I
counselled in summation, "even
ambivalents can't win them all."
"Not even embivalents," he
i averred.

a somewhat profound tone, "are j

"Well," Irving sighed heavily,<

"A little bad luck for your side,

"Tubed!" Irving exclaimed, j
j "Also purged."
"Why would someone purge a 1

The Great Purge

"Frankly, Irving," I had to ad

1 not to have a philosophy of,
sports; some of the most succu
lent pleasures of life," I added in
a somewhat profound tone, "are j
perceived by experience and not
by analylical thought, are enjoyed
rather than studied."
Irving appeared boggled.
"That sounds somewhat anti
intellectual to mo." Irving re
torted, "give me an example."

Sports Is Not a PE Course
"Too often, I fear, too often.
But sports is not a one unit PE
course on the rules and regula
tions of official Water Polo, nor
a six point summary of averages,
and records, and prospects for the
future."
"What is it then? Irving loyally!
asked, in order that our Socratic
dialogue might continue.
"At best, it is played and en-;
joyed; at worst ii is analyzed,

thereby*raping it of its spontane
ity and vigor by facile analyses
and many limes a faulty diagno
i sis of strategy.

pose of a collegiate athletic pro
gram. Playing something, espe-
I cially willi sumeone of approxi
mately equal ability, contesting
with all powers of mind, fabric,
and coordination. Sans only moral
i indignation."
"Sounds rather extreme," he
I said, stroking his beard pen
j sively."
"You mean leaving out moral
indignation?" I asked.
"Well, that, and also just gen
erally extreme. Isn't there any
! middle ground?" I mean, every-
I one isn't a jock."
'.. "Certainly, Irving. Which is
the main reason we have high
powered intercollegiate competi

is spectated upon. Its enjoyment
! becomes vicarious "but still not
I intellectually."
Experiential, Si.; Intellectual, No!
"Still not intellectual?" Irving's
j face brightened.
"No. Irving," I said, "mostly ex
periential."
"But doesn't every sportswriter
have a license to analyze at will;
! for what else is he a sports
! writer?"
"In some cases, Irving," I said,
; "should be revoked. The best
sportswriter is one who is more
worried about entertaining his
audience, about conveying to
them a slice of amusement and
excitement of a. game, and about
opportunities for best — play

"Than one who gets bogged
down in a maze of sports jargon
land thoughtless analysis?" Irv
-1 ing veritably beamed with under
! standing.
"Irving," I said, "I think you're
becoming ambivalent."
Irving smiled and got up to
! leave. "If only Ihe new head of
1 the "Don't Count To Ten OB
| JURGATE" society were."
"Well, take heart. Irving," I
counselled in summation, "even
ambivalents can't win them all."
"Not even embivalents," he
i averred.

To sp»'uk of mauy things,
Of Shoes, and Ships, and Scaling wax,
