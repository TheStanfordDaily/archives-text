# The 						Death of Student Drama
## 
### 
Amid all the fanfare surrounding the an
nouncement of the professional repertory thea
ter to be established at Stanford next fall, one
very important point has been conveniently tor
gotten:
Very simply, the repertoiy theater will quite
probably mean the death of student drama—
specifically undergraduate drama—at Stanford.
Let us examine the facts:
The repertory theater will present five pro
ductions in Memorial Auditorium—three on Main
Stage (one each quarter) and two in Little
Theatre (one at the end of fall quarter and one
at the start of spring).
These productions will use a company of ten
professional senior actors plus graduate students
who are in their final year of preparation for
their Master of Fine Arts.
To compensate for this casting, Robert Loper
—executive head of the Speech and Drama De
partment—has promised three productions a year
which will cast only undergraduates.
This sounds fine, until one realizes that these
three productions will be in the Niterv, a large
room in the Old Union that—equipped with fifty
chairs and a few lights—is jokingly referred to as
a theater. It is indeed a challenge for any stu
dent to work in the Nitery, but the experience
one can gain there is minimal at best.
But the main victim of the repertoiy theater
will be Ram's Head, Stanford's entirely student
run dramatic organization. Ram's Head will still
do "Gaieties" each fall; "Gaieties' is too much
of a tradition to dare try to change. This fall the
repertory theater, after four and a half weeks of
rehearsal on Main Stage, will debut its initial
production October 27. Ram's Head, which will
rehearse wherever it can find space, will move in
November 7—the day after the repertory pro
duction closes—and will have nine days of re
hearsal onstage before opening November 16.
(This, however, is better than this past year
m hen the Stanford Players' production of "The
Sea Gull" ran through November 13 in Little
Theatre and "Gaieties * opened November 17 on
Main Stage. Due to the layout of Memorial Au
ditorium, it was impossible to rehearse "Gaieties"
while "The Sea Gull was in performance, and
thus on all but the last three days during the
two weeks before its opening, all of "Gaieties'"
onstage rehearsals had to be over by 8:30 p.m.)
Winter One Acts, the one consistent sourse of
original student drama, seems hopelessly lost.
Shunted from its traditional home in Little The
atre to the Nitery this year as a result of the
Stanford Players' "The Possessed," even the Nit
en will apparently be denied it next year in order
to accomodate the promised undergraduate
shows. (It is possible, of course, that the Speech
and Drama Department will simply consider
\\ inter One Acts one of its undergraduate shows;
such a "generous" concession—letting Ram's
Head do Winter One Acts—would relieve the

Department of the burdens of one production.)
Spring Show will become a thing of the past.
Stephen Baffrey, producer of the repertory the
ater, said in a Daily interview last week that
Ram's Head has "been asked to step aside in
some respects to help us, but we all feel very
close to Ram's Head. The benefits are so obvious,
though, that Ram's Head can't help but gain."'
Exactly what benefits Ram's Ilead will gain
from not being able to do a Spring Show ou
Main Stage are dubious. Frost has been sug
gested as an alternative but, due to the repertory
theater's schedule, the only possible time would
be the first weekend in May, and anyone who
went to the Henry Mancini concert a few weeks
ago knows that Frost can get pretty chilly for
the darling buds of May.
Thus Ram's Head will find itself producing
only one show—"Gaieties "—each year. YVhen one
realizes that Richard Hay, who will bo the reper
tory theater's designer, first got experience de
signing Ram's Head shows as an undergratuate;
when one realizes that Warner Leßoy, who pro
duced "Tchin-Tchin" on Broadway, gained ex
perience directing three consecutive Spring
Shows, one understands the importance of Ram's
Head as a training ground.
In a sense, this is only a part of Stanford's
traditional problem of whether to emphasize
graduate or undergraduate education. The
Speech and Drama Department, with its estab
lishment of the repertory theater and the MFA
program, lias obviously chosen the latter. And
there is no doubt but that the few students work
ing for their MFA will gain immensely from the
repertory 11 leater.
But what of the Department's undergradu
ates, who have always been able to work with
graduate students in Stanford Players produc
tions? Indeed, working only in undergraduate
productions in the Niterv, will they be prepared
upon graduation to enter a program like Stan
fords?
What of the students (often IN the Speech
and Drama Department) for whom Ram's Head
has provided their only chance to direct, write
and design while undergraduates?
And what of the students who just came
down to the shop to help paint sets one night a
week for Ram's Head—just to be a part of the
show, any show?
Students can not learn drama simply by read
ing plays or by performing scenes in class or
by watching professionals rehearse and perform.
Students must have the chance to act, direct,
write and design for a live audience; they must
have the chance to make their own mistakes—to
try—and to learn even when they fail.
It the repertoiy theater, in spite of all its noble
aims, denies this opportunity to Stanford stu
dents, it will be too bad—too bad for the students
and, ultimately, too bad for drama.

theater's schedule, the only possible time would
be the first weekend in May, and anyone who
went to the Henry Mancini concert a few weeks

the darling buds of May.
Thus Ram's Head will find itself producing
only one show—"Gaieties "—each year. YVhen one
realizes that Richard Hay, who will bo the reper
tory theater's designer, first got experience de
signing Ram's Head shows as an undergratuate;
when one realizes that Warner Leßoy, who pro
duced "Tchin-Tchin" on Broadway, gained ex
perience directing three consecutive Spring
Shows, one understands the importance of Ram's
Head as a training ground.
In a sense, this is only a part of Stanford's
traditional problem of whether to emphasize
graduate or undergraduate education. The
Speech and Drama Department, with its estab
lishment of the repertory theater and the MFA
program, lias obviously chosen the latter. And
there is no doubt but that the few students work
ing for their MFA will gain immensely from the
repertory 11 leater.
But what of the Department's undergradu
ates, who have always been able to work with
graduate students in Stanford Players produc
tions? Indeed, working only in undergraduate
productions in the Niterv, will they be prepared
upon graduation to enter a program like Stan
fords?
What of the students (often IN the Speech
and Drama Department) for whom Ram's Head
has provided their only chance to direct, write
and design while undergraduates?
And what of the students who just came
down to the shop to help paint sets one night a
week for Ram's Head—just to be a part of the
show, any show?
Students can not learn drama simply by read
ing plays or by performing scenes in class or
by watching professionals rehearse and perform.
Students must have the chance to act, direct,
write and design for a live audience; they must
have the chance to make their own mistakes—to
try—and to learn even when they fail.
It the repertoiy theater, in spite of all its noble
aims, denies this opportunity to Stanford stu
dents, it will be too bad—too bad for the students
and, ultimately, too bad for drama.

Amid all the fanfare surrounding the an
nouncement of the professional repertory thea
ter to be established at Stanford next fall, one
very important point has been conveniently tor
gotten:
Very simply, the repertoiy theater will quite
probably mean the death of student drama—
specifically undergraduate drama—at Stanford.
Let us examine the facts:
The repertory theater will present five pro
ductions in Memorial Auditorium—three on Main
Stage (one each quarter) and two in Little
Theatre (one at the end of fall quarter and one
at the start of spring).
These productions will use a company of ten
professional senior actors plus graduate students
who are in their final year of preparation for
their Master of Fine Arts.
To compensate for this casting, Robert Loper
—executive head of the Speech and Drama De
partment—has promised three productions a year
which will cast only undergraduates.
This sounds fine, until one realizes that these
three productions will be in the Niterv, a large
room in the Old Union that—equipped with fifty
chairs and a few lights—is jokingly referred to as
a theater. It is indeed a challenge for any stu
dent to work in the Nitery, but the experience
one can gain there is minimal at best.
But the main victim of the repertoiy theater
will be Ram's Head, Stanford's entirely student
run dramatic organization. Ram's Head will still
do "Gaieties" each fall; "Gaieties' is too much
of a tradition to dare try to change. This fall the
repertory theater, after four and a half weeks of
rehearsal on Main Stage, will debut its initial
production October 27. Ram's Head, which will
rehearse wherever it can find space, will move in
November 7—the day after the repertory pro
duction closes—and will have nine days of re
hearsal onstage before opening November 16.
(This, however, is better than this past year
m hen the Stanford Players' production of "The
Sea Gull" ran through November 13 in Little
Theatre and "Gaieties * opened November 17 on
Main Stage. Due to the layout of Memorial Au
ditorium, it was impossible to rehearse "Gaieties"
while "The Sea Gull was in performance, and
thus on all but the last three days during the
two weeks before its opening, all of "Gaieties'"
onstage rehearsals had to be over by 8:30 p.m.)
Winter One Acts, the one consistent sourse of
original student drama, seems hopelessly lost.
Shunted from its traditional home in Little The
atre to the Nitery this year as a result of the
Stanford Players' "The Possessed," even the Nit
en will apparently be denied it next year in order
to accomodate the promised undergraduate
shows. (It is possible, of course, that the Speech
and Drama Department will simply consider
\\ inter One Acts one of its undergraduate shows;
such a "generous" concession—letting Ram's
Head do Winter One Acts—would relieve the

Department of the burdens of one production.)
Spring Show will become a thing of the past.
Stephen Baffrey, producer of the repertory the
ater, said in a Daily interview last week that
Ram's Head has "been asked to step aside in
some respects to help us, but we all feel very
close to Ram's Head. The benefits are so obvious,
though, that Ram's Head can't help but gain."'
Exactly what benefits Ram's Ilead will gain
from not being able to do a Spring Show ou
Main Stage are dubious. Frost has been sug
gested as an alternative but, due to the repertory
theater's schedule, the only possible time would

will be Ram's Head, Stanford's entirely student
run dramatic organization. Ram's Head will still
do "Gaieties" each fall; "Gaieties' is too much
of a tradition to dare try to change. This fall the
repertory theater, after four and a half weeks of
rehearsal on Main Stage, will debut its initial
production October 27. Ram's Head, which will
rehearse wherever it can find space, will move in
November 7—the day after the repertory pro
duction closes—and will have nine days of re
hearsal onstage before opening November 16.
(This, however, is better than this past year
m hen the Stanford Players' production of "The
Sea Gull" ran through November 13 in Little
Theatre and "Gaieties * opened November 17 on
Main Stage. Due to the layout of Memorial Au
ditorium, it was impossible to rehearse "Gaieties"
while "The Sea Gull was in performance, and
thus on all but the last three days during the
two weeks before its opening, all of "Gaieties'"
onstage rehearsals had to be over by 8:30 p.m.)
Winter One Acts, the one consistent sourse of
original student drama, seems hopelessly lost.
Shunted from its traditional home in Little The
atre to the Nitery this year as a result of the
Stanford Players' "The Possessed," even the Nit
en will apparently be denied it next year in order
to accomodate the promised undergraduate
shows. (It is possible, of course, that the Speech
and Drama Department will simply consider
\\ inter One Acts one of its undergraduate shows;
such a "generous" concession—letting Ram's
Head do Winter One Acts—would relieve the

Department of the burdens of one production.)
Spring Show will become a thing of the past.
Stephen Baffrey, producer of the repertory the
ater, said in a Daily interview last week that
Ram's Head has "been asked to step aside in
some respects to help us, but we all feel very
close to Ram's Head. The benefits are so obvious,
though, that Ram's Head can't help but gain."'
Exactly what benefits Ram's Ilead will gain
from not being able to do a Spring Show ou
Main Stage are dubious. Frost has been sug
gested as an alternative but, due to the repertory
theater's schedule, the only possible time would
be the first weekend in May, and anyone who
went to the Henry Mancini concert a few weeks
ago knows that Frost can get pretty chilly for
the darling buds of May.
Thus Ram's Head will find itself producing
only one show—"Gaieties "—each year. YVhen one
realizes that Richard Hay, who will bo the reper
tory theater's designer, first got experience de
signing Ram's Head shows as an undergratuate;
when one realizes that Warner Leßoy, who pro
duced "Tchin-Tchin" on Broadway, gained ex
perience directing three consecutive Spring
Shows, one understands the importance of Ram's
Head as a training ground.
In a sense, this is only a part of Stanford's
traditional problem of whether to emphasize
graduate or undergraduate education. The
Speech and Drama Department, with its estab
lishment of the repertory theater and the MFA
program, lias obviously chosen the latter. And
there is no doubt but that the few students work
ing for their MFA will gain immensely from the
repertory 11 leater.
But what of the Department's undergradu
ates, who have always been able to work with
graduate students in Stanford Players produc
tions? Indeed, working only in undergraduate
productions in the Niterv, will they be prepared
upon graduation to enter a program like Stan
fords?
What of the students (often IN the Speech
and Drama Department) for whom Ram's Head
has provided their only chance to direct, write
and design while undergraduates?
And what of the students who just came
down to the shop to help paint sets one night a
week for Ram's Head—just to be a part of the
show, any show?
Students can not learn drama simply by read
ing plays or by performing scenes in class or
by watching professionals rehearse and perform.
Students must have the chance to act, direct,
write and design for a live audience; they must
have the chance to make their own mistakes—to
try—and to learn even when they fail.
It the repertoiy theater, in spite of all its noble
aims, denies this opportunity to Stanford stu
dents, it will be too bad—too bad for the students
and, ultimately, too bad for drama.
—Joseph Jacobs
Amid all the fanfare surrounding the an
nouncement of the professional repertory thea
ter to be established at Stanford next fall, one
very important point has been conveniently tor
gotten:
Very simply, the repertoiy theater will quite
probably mean the death of student drama—
specifically undergraduate drama—at Stanford.
Let us examine the facts:
The repertory theater will present five pro
ductions in Memorial Auditorium—three on Main
Stage (one each quarter) and two in Little
Theatre (one at the end of fall quarter and one
at the start of spring).
These productions will use a company of ten
professional senior actors plus graduate students
who are in their final year of preparation for
their Master of Fine Arts.
To compensate for this casting, Robert Loper
—executive head of the Speech and Drama De
partment—has promised three productions a year
which will cast only undergraduates.
This sounds fine, until one realizes that these
three productions will be in the Niterv, a large
room in the Old Union that—equipped with fifty
chairs and a few lights—is jokingly referred to as
a theater. It is indeed a challenge for any stu
dent to work in the Nitery, but the experience
one can gain there is minimal at best.
But the main victim of the repertoiy theater
will be Ram's Head, Stanford's entirely student
run dramatic organization. Ram's Head will still
