## Cal Teach-In: 'Bundying' Out? 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
In case Professors Burdiek and
Scalopino think that they have
added anything to their statures
by "Bundying" out of the Cal
Teach-In because the cards are
numerically stacked against
them, the positions of Morse and
Gruening in the U.S. Senate
should be called to their atten
tion.
Preceding the recent $700 mil
lion "confidence" vote on Presi
dent Johnson's Vietnam policies,

the following words rang out on
the Senate floor: "In my judge
ment, the vote the Senate will
cast tomorrow can he described
as a vote of destiny for the United
States; but it will be a vote of
destiny that will start the decline
of this Republic, as great powers
before us in the history of man
kind declined after they too be
came drunk with military
power."
The speaker of these prophetic
words, Wayne Morse, also had

the numerical cards stacked
against him. The Senate vote was
88-3 to escalate the war in Viet
nam. Senator Morse's lesson for
Professors Burdick and Scalopino
is that a confident intellectual
understanding buttressed by
moral conviction does not cause
one to duck out, it causes one to
fight all the harder.

Somehow The Daily managed
to completely ignore an event |
which, as KZSU advertised, in i
volved over 1000 members of the '
Stanford Community: Spring
Sing. While I can understand the
absence of any mention of Spring
Sing in Monday's paper due to ;
press deadline, certainly the tini-j
est mention should have appeared
in Tuesday's.
Similarly, other important
events, vis. the South Africa Con- j
fercnce and the Teach-in received;
barely adequate coverage at the j
expense of the overworkd come- j
dy of W. Wonka, etc. Either ex j
pand the newspaper (and your|

Editor, The Daily,
Somehow The Daily managed
to completely ignore an event |
which, as KZSU advertised, in i
volved over 1000 members of the '
Stanford Community: Spring
Sing. While I can understand the
absence of any mention of Spring
Sing in Monday's paper due to ;
press deadline, certainly the tini-j
est mention should have appeared
in Tuesday's.
Similarly, other important
events, vis. the South Africa Con- j
fercnce and the Teach-in received;
barely adequate coverage at the j
expense of the overworkd come- j
dy of W. Wonka, etc. Either ex j
pand the newspaper (and your|
advertising and quality generally j
warrant this) or be more discrim-;
inatc in your choice of "news." i
