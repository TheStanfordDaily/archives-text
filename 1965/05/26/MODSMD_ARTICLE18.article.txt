# A 						PARTING SHOT
## Mediocre Student's Plight 
### MARY WOHLFORD HELEN POWE (Second in a Series 
A lost and lonely freshman stood looking at the imposing edifice
of Stanford University. With an idealistic devotion to the pursuit
of knowledge, she thought that soon doors would be opened unto
her. With the persistence of a Joseph K., a senior now stands
looking at the same edifice, still waiting for the door to open. I low-

ever Kafkaesque, this is the plight-f
of the mediocre student. What
special section for a class in which
she has a particular interest has a
place for her? What honors pro
gram is broad enough to allow
her to make her contribution in ,
a specific field? None.
Not even attempting to describe :
the many factors that any good
counselor at Counseling and Test
ing can cite as contributing to a
mediocre gradepoint while assur
ing you that you really are an in
telligent and contributing part
of the University, the one factor
remains that unless you have a
3.0 grade point average you are
out of luck as far as special pro
grams or independent study are
concerned. Never letting that
daunt a strong will, the next
time you knock on a professor's
office door with a request that
he sponsor a pet project of yours,
you are almost certain to meet
this question. "What's your
G.P.A.?" Response. "2.7." Re
sponse. "I'm sorry, 1 don't give di
rected reading to anyone with
under a three point." Exit. Etc.
What Criteria?
Often an overall gradepoint is
not a valid assessment of the stu
dent's ability. Practically never
is it an indication of his interest.
Why shouldn't the mediocre stu
dent be allowed to develop his abil
ities in terms of interest rather
than in terms of a rigid system?
It is bad enough that every stu
dent, regardless of inclination,
should have to live through the
mass-produced, educational set
up of the freshman year and gen
eral studies program without hav
ing his individual outlets cut off
by G.P.A. alone. Why should this
keep a student from being accept
ed into special sections in even ele
mentary courses such as Pysch 1
and Anthro 1? If the student is 1
willing to do the extra work and

has enough interest to apply ser
iously, why should G.P.A. be the
deciding factor?
Many potentially good students
i have their creativity stifled by the
i present system. In the History
Dept., for example, the non-hon
| ors student can anticipate a fairly
i routine program of large imper
sonal courses with little to tie
them together in any kind of co
hesive program. In addition there
is little opportunity to participate
in any kind of interdiciplinary
project. Why is there, nothing in
either the political science depart
ment or the history department
dealing with African studies?
Why isn't there at least one pro
fessor who will give it as direct
ed reading? Such opportunities
would laopefully produce an at
mosphere in which multitudes of
interested mediocre students —
who are convinced that the Uni
versity can't be bothered—might
lead a more rewarding academic
life.
English Program
This is not to slight the work
that is being done. It merely asks
again when the door will be open
ed. The undergraduate history eol
loqs and the education seminar
are steps in the right direction.
So is the program Mr. Guerard
of the English Dept. is developing
to provide creative outlets for
freshmen who feel stifled by their
programs. English T.A.'s this year
have also been helpful in the
freshman situation.
Let this good will pervade all
classes. Let all gate keepers open
all gates and let the Joseph K.'s
pass through. After all. even some
of the mediocre students will be
graduated and can't wait forever
j for justice to decree t ho right of
! interest over system.

mediocre gradepoint while assur
ing you that you really are an in
telligent and contributing part
of the University, the one factor
remains that unless you have a
3.0 grade point average you are
out of luck as far as special pro
grams or independent study are
concerned. Never letting that
daunt a strong will, the next
time you knock on a professor's
office door with a request that
he sponsor a pet project of yours,
you are almost certain to meet
this question. "What's your
G.P.A.?" Response. "2.7." Re
sponse. "I'm sorry, 1 don't give di
rected reading to anyone with
under a three point." Exit. Etc.
What Criteria?
Often an overall gradepoint is
not a valid assessment of the stu
dent's ability. Practically never
is it an indication of his interest.
Why shouldn't the mediocre stu
dent be allowed to develop his abil
ities in terms of interest rather
than in terms of a rigid system?
It is bad enough that every stu
dent, regardless of inclination,
should have to live through the
mass-produced, educational set
up of the freshman year and gen
eral studies program without hav
ing his individual outlets cut off
by G.P.A. alone. Why should this
keep a student from being accept
ed into special sections in even ele
mentary courses such as Pysch 1
and Anthro 1? If the student is 1
willing to do the extra work and

has enough interest to apply ser
iously, why should G.P.A. be the
deciding factor?
Many potentially good students
i have their creativity stifled by the
i present system. In the History
Dept., for example, the non-hon
| ors student can anticipate a fairly
i routine program of large imper
sonal courses with little to tie
them together in any kind of co
hesive program. In addition there
is little opportunity to participate
in any kind of interdiciplinary
project. Why is there, nothing in
either the political science depart
ment or the history department
dealing with African studies?
Why isn't there at least one pro
fessor who will give it as direct
ed reading? Such opportunities
would laopefully produce an at
mosphere in which multitudes of
interested mediocre students —
who are convinced that the Uni
versity can't be bothered—might
lead a more rewarding academic
life.

A lost and lonely freshman stood looking at the imposing edifice
of Stanford University. With an idealistic devotion to the pursuit
of knowledge, she thought that soon doors would be opened unto
her. With the persistence of a Joseph K., a senior now stands
looking at the same edifice, still waiting for the door to open. I low-

ever Kafkaesque, this is the plight-f
of the mediocre student. What
special section for a class in which
she has a particular interest has a

a specific field? None.
