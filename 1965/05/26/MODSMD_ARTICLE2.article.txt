# KZSU Research Team Heads South
## 
### HAL WILLIAMS 
As the school year draws to a
close, KZSU Project South is set
1o swing into full operation. An
eight-man research broadcast
team will leave on June 10 for
Mississippi and Louisiana to ini
tiate a three month study on stu
dents involved in civil rights.
Through interviews and survey
data the project will attempt to
obtain documented information
about the northern students who
become involved in social change.
Who are these students? What
colleges do they come from? Why
do they go to the South? How do
they view their participation and
its effectiveness? The results will
bo aired in a series of nationwide
radio programs to be released late
next fall.
The project began as an at
tempt to focus more meaningful
attention on the college student
communities. KZSU feels that
since the California-Berkeley ac
tivism, students have received a
great deal of attention, and yet
have been treated with very little
responsibility.
Professors and administrators
are asked by newsmen to answer
the question why students become
involved in such issues.
Their responses are generally
only individual opinions, and not
even representative ones at that.
Project Goal
One goal of our project is to
develop documented comment and
conclusions, thus providing a
more solid basis for persons to
view and discuss the phenomena
of student involvement.

Another goal of the project is
to turn the research — which
might normally end up in a so
ciological journal — into inter
esting, lively radio broadcasts.
By recording all material on
tape (approximately two thou
sand hours) the material will be
presented in the words and voices
of the students themselves.
A final goal is to discuss
method and procedure as well.
The broadcasts will attempt to
explain what is involved in the
research process. In this respect,
KZSU feels that the project can
help to realize the potential of
radio as a means of social respon
sibility.
Research Plan
The research plan has been de
veloped this quarter within a So
ciology course. Planning and pro
duction are under the direction of
Dr. Paul Wallin and Dan Garvey,
Department of Communications.
Members of the team include
Penny Niland, Station Manager

Public Affairs Director, KZSU,

conclusions, thus providing a
more solid basis for persons to
view and discuss the phenomena
of student involvement.

Another goal of the project is
to turn the research — which
might normally end up in a so
ciological journal — into inter
esting, lively radio broadcasts.
By recording all material on
tape (approximately two thou
sand hours) the material will be
presented in the words and voices
of the students themselves.
A final goal is to discuss
method and procedure as well.
The broadcasts will attempt to
explain what is involved in the
research process. In this respect,
KZSU feels that the project can
help to realize the potential of
radio as a means of social respon
sibility.
Research Plan
The research plan has been de
veloped this quarter within a So
ciology course. Planning and pro
duction are under the direction of
Dr. Paul Wallin and Dan Garvey,
Department of Communications.
Members of the team include
Penny Niland, Station Manager
elect, KZSU, Mare Dalyrimple,
Public Affairs Director, KZSU,
Mary Kay Becker, Feature Edi
tor Stanford Daily. Roger Dan
kert. Documentary Research,
KZSU, Julie Wells, Office Direc
tor. KZSU, Kim Mcßae, Chief En
gineer, KZSU, Ralph Peer, Sta
tion Manager KZSU. and Hal Wil
liams, Director of Station Rela
tions and West Coast Director of
the Intercollegiate Broadcasting
System.
The project was originated and
organized by KZSU. A grant from
the Kaltneborn Foundation, New
York, is providing partial subsidy.
As the school year draws to a
close, KZSU Project South is set
1o swing into full operation. An
eight-man research broadcast
team will leave on June 10 for
Mississippi and Louisiana to ini
tiate a three month study on stu
dents involved in civil rights.
Through interviews and survey
data the project will attempt to
obtain documented information
about the northern students who
become involved in social change.
Who are these students? What
colleges do they come from? Why
do they go to the South? How do
they view their participation and
its effectiveness? The results will
bo aired in a series of nationwide
radio programs to be released late
next fall.
The project began as an at
tempt to focus more meaningful
attention on the college student
communities. KZSU feels that
since the California-Berkeley ac
tivism, students have received a
great deal of attention, and yet
have been treated with very little
responsibility.
Professors and administrators
are asked by newsmen to answer
the question why students become
involved in such issues.
Their responses are generally
only individual opinions, and not
even representative ones at that.
