## Quad Captures Campus Color

Workshop comes out, Scratch

and, of course, tin* Quad's are

Making its annual end-01-t he
year appearance, this year's Quad
' proves worthy of year-long antici

i tion. the 1965 Quad is no doubt

j Quad Ever."
Dramatic Photography
The photography, produced un
-1 der the direction of Photo Editor
j Bruce Wilcox, is truly something
I to talk about. From the cover
- a dramatic night light shot of
Mem Claw which seems It) elicit
"ooh's" and "all's" from everyone
who sees it to the editor's sign
• off—Emmy Lou Randol's immor
tal cowboy boots the camera
j man-ship is superb.
There is lots of color and lots
! of mood. There are night shots of
quad; night shots of Lake Lag;
night shots of San Francisco.
There is an almost nostalgic
double page spread on the now
disappeared sailboats.
As always, of course, there is
an ample helping of candids and
ingenious informals. But it is the
big, flashy color spreads which
separate the "fun" photographers
from the polished ones. This
year's Quad has once again
dramatized how photogenic the
Stanford campus really is, espec
ially when viewed with imagina
| tion and in glorious color.

The Quad has also tried some-
I thing new by replacing pages tra
! ditionally devoted to Quad queens
I to a photo essay on some of the
notable Stanford professors. The
feature is both eye-catching and
fraught with mood, but will, no
doubt, fail to please that seg
ment of the student body who
buy a Quad with date rating in
mind.
Another innovation is a return
J to the practice of allowing living
I groups and organizations to write
their own captions sometimes
I they are funny, sometimes indu
bitably gross. Mostly, however,
the blurbs will prove hilariously

clever to those who belong and
practically meaningless to the
casual reader.
The 1963 Quad is pleasing both
to the eye and the sense of humor.
Nothing radically new in format,
but very competently done. And
its photography brings it close
to a work of real artistic merit.

There is an almost nostalgic

disappeared sailboats.
As always, of course, there is
an ample helping of candids and
ingenious informals. But it is the
big, flashy color spreads which
separate the "fun" photographers
from the polished ones. This
year's Quad has once again
dramatized how photogenic the
Stanford campus really is, espec
ially when viewed with imagina
