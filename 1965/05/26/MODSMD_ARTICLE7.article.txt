# National Review Editor Backs Viet Nam Policy
## 
### THERY COXON 
"Do what, we're doing," is the
recommendation of William
Rusher, current Stern Hall Guest-
I In Residence, for American policy
j in Viet-Nam.
Rusher, publisher of the con
servative journal "National Re
view," said in an interview with
the Daily that American policy
has hardened under President
Johnson and that this strategy of
strength is the one needed to pre
vent a Communist takeover in
South Viet-Nam.
"Whether the revision in Amer
ican policy i smerely a modifica
tion of past strategy or a com
plete change in viewpoint is un
certain. If the current strengthen
ing of American determination to
; oppose Communism is to be more
. than a temporary aberration,
1 Johnson must see through the
! underlying assumptions of the
| liberals."
Containment Inadequate
Such a change, Rusher ex
! plained, would involve a rejee
-1 tion of the containment of Com
j munism as the ultimate goal of
foreign policy. "Containment in
i and of itself is not an adequate
strategy but is only a first step,
i Beyond containment must be a
j step forward. We should probe
I for weak spots in the Communist
! structure."
.Rusher recommended the Afri
-1 can state of Ghana as a target
for American anti-Communist
| strategy. "Ghana is run by
Kwame Nkrumah, a Marxist to
talitarian. We could lend support
: to Bousia, a democrat and the
! leader of the parliamentary oppo
sition to Nkrumah's dictatorship.
But we haven't."
Turning to the problem of the
i Dominican Republic, Rusher said
1 he believes that American inter
vention to prevent Communist
domination of that country can
be successful "if domestic pres
sures do not force Johnson to
accept some spongy neutral re
gime. We went into Korea and
into Cuba at the Bay of Pigs, but
| we only got in half way and then
I were talked out. This may hap
pen in the Dominican Republic."
Asked his opinion of Juan
Bouche's ability as the leader of
! a free government, Rusher com

pared him to Alexander Keren
sky, "the last fall guy before the
Communist takeover."
Presidential Prospects
Rusher has been deeply in
volved in the politics of the Re
publican party during recent
years as a promoter of conserva
tive candidates. He expressed
pessimism about his party's im
mediate electoral prospects, say
ing that "Republican chances for
the Presidency in 1968 are slim.
The party has deep internal dif
ficulties because it cannot make
up its mind what it wants to do
and what it wants to be."
Asked for a prediction as to
whom his party would nominate
for that election, he stated that
the tendency among Republican
leaders will be to select someone
who will not emphasize the dif
ferences within the party. "The
obvious choice and the front-run
ner is Nixon. But front-runners
two years before a convention
are rarely heard of when the ac
tual nomination is made."
"There is as yet no apparent
successor to Barry Goldwater as
the central conservative leader,"
Rusher said. "Senator Peter Dom
inic of Colorado or Senator
Hrushka of Nebraska may fill
the role, as could Ronald Reagan i
or Max Rafferty if either were I

elected Governor of California.
But so far there has been no jell
ing of support around any one
person."
A former Young Republican,
Rusher believes that that organi
zation has an important function
in his party. "Since the Second
World War, the YR's have pro
vided invaluable training to thou
sands of members and have pro
duced many important Republi
can leaders. The Draft Goldwater
Committee, which provided the
important early support for the
Senator's Presidential campaign,
was composed of former Young
Republicans."
William Rusher came into na
tional prominence in 1957 when he
accepted William Buckely's invi
tation to serve as publisher of
"National Review." Since then,
the publication, always in the hot
center of controversy, has grown
into a national institution which
is read as holy writ by the na
tion's conservatives and as docu
mentary evidence of right-wing
depravity by the nation's liberals.
Rusher's publication serves as the
conservative counterpart to the
liberal "New Republic," "Nation,"
and"The Reporter," and has the
largest circulation (100,000) of
any journal of opinion in the
United States.
