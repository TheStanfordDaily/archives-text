## Workshop Makes Its Own Rules 
### BOB BJORINNG 
A carefree and casual attitude
towards situations and people,
one which is carefully observant
yet reserving judgment, is cer
tainly admirable; perhaps this is
The Workshop's virtue.
Being rather less imposingly
i literary than Sequoia, it has the
j opportunity to acccpt and print
pieces which do not fit into an
j ordinary category.
The first story, Joel Kugel
j mass' "The Auction" exemplifies
'the magazine as a whole in its
I total abeyance of all the "rules."
A middle-class man, who shares
, a middle-class house in a middle
; class neighborhood with a middle
j class wife, is becoming bored by
I it all.
He does not. however, stifle in
■ his plight. Instead, he buys him
self an outrageously expensive
' table. His wife quite properly de
i mands it be returned, but before
jit goes, we are treated to the
| sight of that table sitting in their
front yard, a ballerina at the city
J dump.
Prank on Qu«Vns
There are dates to the city, and
j there are dates to the city. Ar
: thur Look, in a story by Marshall
John Cook, is all set for one of
i the latter. CINDY, the queen of
the classics class, has agreed to
go with him. We struggle
through Arthur's sun filled fra
ternity afternoon to find, not dis
illusionment. not true love, but a
surprise ending. Mr. Cook seems
to have played the final prank on
the campus queens, and most of
us can share in his satisfaction.
"Two Roads Home," a short
story by Patt Craig McDermid
seems of a more serious nature
[than the others. Two men, frus
trated by the tedious rhythm of
! their lives, fight out an evening
with themselves and commit sui
cide in the bay. We arc left in
| very little doubt as to their rea
sons, and jet there is the tiniest
element of the bizarre in the end
i ings, since one is a successful
doctor, the other a poor receiving
j clerk.
This last issue of Workshop for
i !h* quarter contains ;i good deal
i more poetry than former num
bers The indefatigable Elizabeth

jYount has written a short poem
"To Icarus" on the tragedy of
impossible idealism seeking an
expression in words. Yet she, and
her poem, do not give up as they
begin (o perceive the whole being
scoreed by the sun. "But what
are wings for, but flying?"
John Wagner commits the
nearly unpardonable sin of mak
ing his "Two Poems" vivid repre
sentations in ordinary language
of a death at the beach and a
i pause after "a hard day at the
i office." Even without Words
| worth's Preface on his side, the
' two come off very nicely.
"To Gaea" by Robert Isaak and
Gary Schoolnik's untitled poem
I are more difficult, though eer
; tainly not "obscure." I will has
j ten to add that I did not under
stand them. However, Chris
i Weber's long poem "On Words"
' seems to hold the final judgment
I for these, as well as the other
pieces in Workshop. "'I am all
I ears," 1 say, laughing./ And 1
hold open my soul/ Thai he may
get better aim/ With his beauti
i ful sounds."

"To Gaea" by Robert Isaak and

I are more difficult, though eer

i Weber's long poem "On Words"
' seems to hold the final judgment
I for these, as well as the other
pieces in Workshop. "'I am all
I ears," 1 say, laughing./ And 1
hold open my soul/ Thai he may
get better aim/ With his beauti
i ful sounds."
A carefree and casual attitude
towards situations and people,
one which is carefully observant
yet reserving judgment, is cer
tainly admirable; perhaps this is
The Workshop's virtue.
Being rather less imposingly
i literary than Sequoia, it has the
j opportunity to acccpt and print
pieces which do not fit into an

The first story, Joel Kugel

A middle-class man, who shares

I it all.
He does not. however, stifle in
