Underdeveloped Area Needs You
If you would like to contribute either time, money or energy to the develop
ment of a virgin area, and yet remain within an hour s drive from North
Beach, we would like to hear from you.
The area we're talking about is along Tomales Bay, bounded by the new
Pt. Reyes Seashore National Park. It is one of the most beautiful places
in the world. The land has been almost exclusively used for dairying and
sheep grazing for the past 100 years, and so is totally undeveloped in any
other way. The advent of the National Park and consequent rise in land
values and taxes make it impossible for this heretofore unchanged way of
life to contiune.
The next stage of development will have to be directed almost completely
from the outside—capital is needed, as well as people.
If you are already established in a career elsewhere, but would like to
invest in waterfront and water-view property which land economists feel
is a "sleeper," please contact us for further information. We will supply
it with no obligation.
But more importantly, we need people—people of adventuresome spirit
who prefer rural to urban living, and who have some investment capital
or the capability of being subsidized for a period. The opportunities are
here —regardless of what your background is in. We ourselves are Stanford
people who have settled here and wouldn't go anywhere else,- we'd like
to hear from other Stanford non-conformists. We II be happy to send full
information to you.
