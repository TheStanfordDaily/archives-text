has something for you.
Do the college students you've dated possess some
but not all of the qualifications that appeal to you? :
Enjoy this summer dating those students who meet
your specifications and share your interests. If you
can describe your ideal date, we think we can find
| them.
In the first experiment of its size, students from
i almost 100 New England colleges were matched
through our Quantitative Personality Projection Test.
What's more, the knowledge gained this spring has
enabled us to refine our questionnaire and expect
even better results. We've taken the blindness out i
| of a blind date.
