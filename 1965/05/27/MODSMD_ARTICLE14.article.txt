# Skyrocketing College Costs: Familiar Problem for Students
## 
### 
Compiled from CPS
Although recent months have
i added new dimensions to student
unrest —to Dean or not to Dean,
win or lose in Vietnam, porno
j graphic pickets—many conserva
tive college agitators concern
I themselves with the traditional
gadfly, the rising costs of higher
education.
And with good reason. Average
1 tuition at 99 private institutions
t according to the American Coun
! cil on Education's Fact Book on
[ Higher Education, is currently
over $1200. Nationally, average
college tuition is $859, according
j to tiie U.S. Department of Health,
! Education and Welfare.
Constant. Tuition Hikes
At both public and private in
stitutions. tuition is rising stead
-1 ily. Seniors at private colleges
; and universities last year paid a
I whopping $311, or about 2.1 per
! cent, more than when they en
tered. Going back a decade, tui
i tion at a number of institutions
' was less than half its current
| rate.
No immediate respite is in sight

for students at either public or
private institutions. Predictions
i of $2000 a year tuition at private
institutions are not rare, and may
' soon come true. Columbia Univer
j sity will be only $100 shy of this
goal next fall, when a $200 tui
tion increase goes into effect and
i tuition becomes $1900. P'inch and
i Sarah Lawrence Colleges, per
i haps the nation's most expensive,
: had surpassed $2000 tuitions two
| years ago.
Tuition increases have been re
j ported for next year from all
parts of the country. Among the
j institutions raising their prices
j will be Syracuse ($l2O increase to
j $1620 tuition), Catholic Univer
| sity ($lOO increase to $1300), and
the University of Florida ($34 in
crease for resident students to
$260).
Living Costs lip
The student's financial prob
lems do not end with tuition,
i however. He must also deal with
room and board costs, which, ac
cording to the U.S. Office of Edu
cation, average about $700 in both
j public and private institutions. At
many institutions, if tuition costs
| remain stable for one year, room
j and board costs rise in their place.
Clothing, transportation, text
; books, and recreation must also be
included in the student's budget.
The Office of Education reports
that these run between $300 and
$1000.
| What can be done about rising
; costs? In many instances, noth
| ing. As John Millet, Director of
I the Ohio Board of Regents, com

mented in an address to the Na
tional Conference on Higher Edu
cation:
"Institutions of higher learning
are subject to three principal
forces making for a necessary
increase in .operating costs. In
creasing enrollments, the -need
for higher faculty salaries, and
necessary instructional improve
ments are demands which cannot
be ignored."
Millet did note that there are
counterpressures, such as the re
sistenee of taxpayers and the
limits of students' funds. Another
counterpressure is the limit of
student patience.
Student Protests
Texas students have banded to
gether to oppose tuition raises on
22 of their state college campuses.
The Texas Intercollegiate Student
Association passed a bill opposing
changes and favoring a state-sup
ported loan and scholarship sys
tem. Tlie bill also calls for an
extension of graduate tuition re
bates. The university legislative
committee plans to attend the
state committee hearings and con
tact individual legislators.
At California's University of
Redlands, tuition has recently
been raised to $1350, following an
earlier increase by just one year.
Dissatisfied students objected that
the additional expenses were un
justified. "We agree that teach
ers' salaries should be higher,"
stated one, "but we should be get
ting our money's worth. For
many of us, this increase means
extra jobs and a plea for aid from
our parents."
Students at many schools ex
press the hope that scholarships
will be increased proportionally
to new tuition rates. Experience,
however, has frequently shown
this not to be the case.
Others have expressed a fear
that income rather than ability
level will become an entrance test
for many institutions, even public
colleges.
Tuition Contracts
It may prove impossible to stop
tuition hikes, but perhaps stu
dents' peace of mind can at least
be preserved by wider adoption
of a plan used at St . Olaf College
in Northfield, Minnesota. Students
at St. Olaf's contract with the
college on what their tuition will
be for four years.
While the tuition is usually
higher than usual during fresh
man and sophomore years, a stu
dent signing a contract is assured
that his tuition will be less, not
more, during his final two years.
The program allows the student
to plan his college finances very
closely and protects the school
against large numbers of trans
ferring students in the final two
years.

for higher faculty salaries, and

Millet did note that there are

Student Protests
Texas students have banded to
gether to oppose tuition raises on
22 of their state college campuses.
The Texas Intercollegiate Student
Association passed a bill opposing
changes and favoring a state-sup
ported loan and scholarship sys
tem. Tlie bill also calls for an
extension of graduate tuition re
bates. The university legislative
committee plans to attend the
state committee hearings and con
tact individual legislators.
At California's University of
Redlands, tuition has recently
been raised to $1350, following an
earlier increase by just one year.
Dissatisfied students objected that
the additional expenses were un
justified. "We agree that teach
ers' salaries should be higher,"
stated one, "but we should be get
ting our money's worth. For
many of us, this increase means
extra jobs and a plea for aid from
our parents."
Students at many schools ex
press the hope that scholarships
will be increased proportionally
to new tuition rates. Experience,
however, has frequently shown
this not to be the case.
Others have expressed a fear
that income rather than ability
level will become an entrance test
for many institutions, even public
colleges.
Tuition Contracts
It may prove impossible to stop
tuition hikes, but perhaps stu
dents' peace of mind can at least
be preserved by wider adoption
of a plan used at St . Olaf College
in Northfield, Minnesota. Students
at St. Olaf's contract with the
college on what their tuition will
be for four years.
While the tuition is usually
higher than usual during fresh
man and sophomore years, a stu
dent signing a contract is assured
that his tuition will be less, not
more, during his final two years.
The program allows the student
to plan his college finances very
closely and protects the school
against large numbers of trans
ferring students in the final two
years.

parts of the country. Among the
j institutions raising their prices
j will be Syracuse ($l2O increase to
j $1620 tuition), Catholic Univer

the University of Florida ($34 in
crease for resident students to
$260).
Living Costs lip
The student's financial prob
lems do not end with tuition,
i however. He must also deal with
room and board costs, which, ac
cording to the U.S. Office of Edu
cation, average about $700 in both
j public and private institutions. At
many institutions, if tuition costs
| remain stable for one year, room
j and board costs rise in their place.
Clothing, transportation, text
; books, and recreation must also be
included in the student's budget.
The Office of Education reports
that these run between $300 and
$1000.
| What can be done about rising
; costs? In many instances, noth
| ing. As John Millet, Director of
I the Ohio Board of Regents, com

mented in an address to the Na
tional Conference on Higher Edu
cation:
"Institutions of higher learning
are subject to three principal
forces making for a necessary
increase in .operating costs. In
creasing enrollments, the -need
for higher faculty salaries, and
necessary instructional improve
ments are demands which cannot
be ignored."
Millet did note that there are
counterpressures, such as the re
sistenee of taxpayers and the
limits of students' funds. Another
counterpressure is the limit of
student patience.
Student Protests
Texas students have banded to
gether to oppose tuition raises on
22 of their state college campuses.
The Texas Intercollegiate Student
Association passed a bill opposing
changes and favoring a state-sup
ported loan and scholarship sys
tem. Tlie bill also calls for an
extension of graduate tuition re
bates. The university legislative
committee plans to attend the
state committee hearings and con
tact individual legislators.
At California's University of
Redlands, tuition has recently
been raised to $1350, following an
earlier increase by just one year.
Dissatisfied students objected that
the additional expenses were un
justified. "We agree that teach
ers' salaries should be higher,"
stated one, "but we should be get
ting our money's worth. For
many of us, this increase means
extra jobs and a plea for aid from
our parents."
Students at many schools ex
press the hope that scholarships
will be increased proportionally
to new tuition rates. Experience,
however, has frequently shown
this not to be the case.
Others have expressed a fear
that income rather than ability
level will become an entrance test
for many institutions, even public
colleges.
Tuition Contracts
It may prove impossible to stop
tuition hikes, but perhaps stu
dents' peace of mind can at least
be preserved by wider adoption
of a plan used at St . Olaf College
in Northfield, Minnesota. Students
at St. Olaf's contract with the
college on what their tuition will
be for four years.
While the tuition is usually
higher than usual during fresh
man and sophomore years, a stu
dent signing a contract is assured
that his tuition will be less, not
more, during his final two years.
The program allows the student
to plan his college finances very
closely and protects the school
against large numbers of trans
ferring students in the final two
years.
