# Group Needs Books For Africa, Asia
## 
### 
The ambitious Overseas Books
Project, or OBP, has as its aim
the provision of desperately need
ed books and magazines to schools
and libraries in Asia and Africa.
"The plight of the schools in
the underdeveloped countries is
deplorable," Pa t Jack so n,
chairman of the Project, point
ed out. 'Many schools have
little or no library, and frequently
have only three or four textbooks
—often outdated for a class of
thirty. The lack of magazines
also severely limits the stimula
tion of contact wit h the ideas and
events of the rest of the world."
The Overseas Books Project has
been carefully planned as a perm
anent program in coordination
with the Stale Dept. and the AID.
among others, and has received
the encouragement of many
groups, including UNESCO and
the British Embassy. The OBP
plans to limit operations to the
Stanford campus for the present.
The books collected will be
catalogued; lists will lx» sent to in
terested schools and libraries, and
the books and magazines ordered
will be shipped.
There will be two book drives
a year. The first one will take
place during exam week, June 2-9,
and will be in coordination with
NSA's Books for Equal Oppor
tunity, which sends books to N'e
gro colleges. There will be boxes
for the deposit of books and mag
azines in each living group and
also in front of the Union, the
Bookstore, and the main Library.
"All types of books are needed,"
Pat Jackson commented, "—books
on science, goverment, religion,

history, literature, etc., including
good fiction ,and even a few West
-1 erns, will be much appreciated by
J the students of Africa and Asia."
j A wide variety of magazines is
i also needed. There is also a need
for people able to man the three
main stations for a short period
■ during exam week.
"As our emblem says, we ask all
people on the Stanford campus to
• 'give a hand' and donate what
I they can of books, lime, and.
! money to helping the peoples of
! Africa and Asia to attain
; their just aspirations."
