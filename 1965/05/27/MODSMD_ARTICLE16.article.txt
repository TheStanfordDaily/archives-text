# Village Idiots Ace League
## 
### 
The Village Idiots proved yes
terday that brains (or lack of
them) are better than brawn,
edging past the Nutrinos in the
intramural Softball finals. 6-4.
The Idiots got their first runs
early, striking for three in the
top of the first frame. With two
out, Bob Landes singled and John
Olin followed up by poling a long
towering homer to left field. Brian
Jones then stepped to the plate
and retraced the path of Olin's
hit for another round-tripper.
The score remained 3-0 until the
third inning when the Imbeciles
pushed across another tally. Bob
Dressier trotted home after Jim
Hirst's sacrifice fly for the run.
Outstanding Idiotic fielding
plays were turned in by Bob
Roemer and Dressier. In a great
effort Olin threw a perfect strike
to double a man from his left
field position. Marshall Silvin
pitched his usual strong game for
the Idiots.
