THEATER
THE BACCHAE, Euripides' greatest tragedy, will run in Little
Theatre through this Saturday evening. In spite of flaws in both the
translation and the acting, it is well worth seeing.
THE DWARFS, by Harold Pinter, who is Britain's Absurdist play
wright par excellence, is in the Nitery and will stay there through
Saturday evening. With it is THE KAZOO MAN, another Manny
Freedman original. Admission is free, but tickets may bo picked up |
in advance at Tresidder.
THE EXCEPTION AND THE RULE, Bertolt Brecht's one-acl
morality play, will come to Palo Alto High School this Saturday and
Sunday evenings. The San Francisco Mime Troupe will perform it;
and foreign correspondent Robert Scheer will round out the evening
with a talk on Viel Nam.
FILMS
A SUMMER PLACE, at the Flicks Sunday, will be the last of
ficially-sponsored kissoff of the year. It stars Troy Donahue and
Sandra Deo in another one of those stories about pure, virginal, and
beautiful adolescent sex. Troy gets Sandra pregnant, but she's still
pure, virginal, and beautiful; or, in any case, if she isn't, he is. Ob
viously it's going to be good for nothing but a whole raft of gross
comments.

A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, which is deafening but hilariously in
sane, is now at the Park. This spontaneous, unrehearsed day in the
life of the Beatles has as a partner A SHOT IN THE DARK, which
is also spontaneous and unrehearsed, often to its detriment. It stars
Peter Sellers as the bumbling detective who wanders in and out of
everywhere, including a nudist camp, leaving bodies and chaos behind
in his wake.
ZORBA THE GREEK, which everybody raved about, but which
only proves that you can fool all the people some of the time, is at
the Guild. The Nude Anthony Quinn is not one of its greatest assets,
but Alan Bates and Lila Kedrova are, struggling as they do against
an overwhelmingly bad script.
Fanny Hill and her unanswered question (to bed or not to bed)
have apparently departed from the Fine Arts, taking with them am
bivalence. but leaving behind Rita Tushingham as THE GIRL WITH
THE GREEN EYES, in a bittersweet lyric about love in Ireland. It
is not true that she will settle for NOTHING Bl'T A MAN; that is a
very fine film about the Negro's problems in contemporary society.
THE AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY, starring, of course, Julie
Andrews, but not singing this time, is here to stay at ihe Paris. Ac
companying her is Margaret Rutherford in MURDER AIIOY, orig
inally an Agatha Christie mystery. "Emily" deals with love in war
time France; "Ahoy" can't help being wildly comic, even if a few
corpses do turn up in ihe wrong places. After all, Margaret Ruther
ford can make anything funny.
HUSH, HUSH, SWEET CHARLOTTE, at the Varsity, is another
one of those grim Bette Davis pictures about senility and insanity.
Its one big asset is a beautiful plantation house beautifully photo
graphed. Everything else about it â€”decayed Southern traditions,
ghoulish murders, and all is pretty much of a liability. Gregory
Peck and Diane Baker star in the co-feature, MIRAGE, in which love,
violence, and terror get hopelessly mixed up.
The Stanford has two Cinemascope adventure dramas this week:
A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, starring Anthony Quinn, and RIO
CONCHOS, starring Richard Boone. They will certainly be wide
screened and adventurous, but how good they will be is another
mat ter entirely.
I>R NO and FROM RUSSIA, WITH LOVE, two more installments
in the continuing life of James Bond Connery, are at the Bijou (see
review on this page).
OTHER
THE STANFORD SYMPHONY AND CHORUS will combine on
Friday evening for the Stravinsky "Symphony of Psalms." On Sun
day afternoon, as a part of the Chamber Music concert, the chorus
and orchestra will perform Brahms' "Two-part Songs" and the
Stravinsky Mass. The Wind Ensemble will complete the program.
THE KING AND I, the Rogers and Hammerstein operetta in
which an English governess and the King of Siam get entangled,
will open at the Curran in San Francisco on June 8. This Civic-
Light Opera production will follow "Pickwick," a musical version of
Charles Dickens, which closes June 6.
LA BOHEME, starring Lucia Albanese, is at the Circle Star in San
Carlos tonight and Saturday. On June 1, the San Francisco Ballet
will open there for a week's run.
LAYBOY, the Chappie staff's effort at unmitigated grossness,
is coming out Friday. The last "Layboy" was immediately confiscated
and its editor suspended, and back then they didn't even have Carol
Doda to work with. Clearly this time horniness will be cured or
your money will be refunded.
