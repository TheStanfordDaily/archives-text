## DEAD WEEK SPECIAL â€˜Russia,' 'No,' Bond: Si, Si, Si! 
### PETER KING 
Tho lonely figure darts help
lessly over the barren hillsides,
ducking a low-flying helicopter
whose pilots are trying to blow
him up with hand grenades. Trap
pod, he cowers behind a rock,
desperately tilting together his
collapsible rifle as the helicopter
hovers overhead lo drop the final,
fatal grenade.
Just in time, he assembles Iho
rifle and shoots the pilol. whose
grenade explodes in the helicop
ter, sending it twisting crazily to
the ground in a mass of flames.
Unfazed, the man runs to con
sole his frightened, curvaceous fe
male companion, who molts in his
arms as the helicopter explodes in
gorgeous sheets of orange flame
in the background.
The man? Who else but thai
hero of the British Secret Serv
ice, arch-enemy of all arch-fiends,
and conqueror of all voluptuous
women, James Bond?
Currently at Ihe Bijou Theatre
are the first two Bond movies,
"Dr. No " and"From Russia, With
Love." For those who enjoyed the
third Bond thriller, "Goidfinger,"
these two flicks are a must, in
addition to being a delightful
dead week study break.
Conncry, the Perfect Bond
The ingredients for Bond's
screen success are lan Fleming's
13 Bond classics, director Terence
Young's ability to improvise
imaginatively on the Fleming
plots, and Sean Connery. Connery
is the perfect Bond, exuding rug
ged, dark-eyed Irish virility, with
a powerful body and a face that
can change in an instant from
passionate tenderness to the cold
steel brutality which he needs to
survive as Agent 007.
In his business, that isn't easy.
Dr. No is a cruel Oriental master
criminal, who seeks to wreck the
U.S. space program from his base

on an exotic Caribbean island.
Bond is dispatched by his tough
superior, M, to investigate. Be
fore he arrives, ho is nearly bit
ten by a tarantula, shot at. pur
sued by gunmen in a hearse, and
nearly roasted by a flame-throw
ing tank.
En route he meets a girl (Ur
sula Andress), whose acting defi
| oiencies are lusciously made up
! for with a well-cant.ilevered body.
With her to look forward to. Bond
has more than enough incentive
to foil the diabolical doctor's
schemes in spectacular fashion
and wind up alone with Ursula at

the finish.
Whereas "Dr. No" sometime:
drags interminably, direct o:
Young has done a brilliant job .1
"From Russia." Bond is subjects
to every conceivable danger
from being blown up by gunboat;
to being poisoned by Rosa Klebb'j
foot-dagger to being strangled bj
the coldly efficient murderer, Rer
Grant.
"Russia" is the best Bond fiin
to date, in large part because it
plays thp occasionally ridiculous
Fleming plots for numerous off
color jokes and spares no expenst
for spectacle.

In his business, that isn't easy.
Dr. No is a cruel Oriental master
criminal, who seeks to wreck the
U.S. space program from his base

on an exotic Caribbean island.
Bond is dispatched by his tough
superior, M, to investigate. Be
fore he arrives, ho is nearly bit
ten by a tarantula, shot at. pur
sued by gunmen in a hearse, and
nearly roasted by a flame-throw
ing tank.
En route he meets a girl (Ur
sula Andress), whose acting defi
| oiencies are lusciously made up
! for with a well-cant.ilevered body.
With her to look forward to. Bond
has more than enough incentive
to foil the diabolical doctor's
schemes in spectacular fashion
and wind up alone with Ursula at

the finish.
Whereas "Dr. No" sometime:
drags interminably, direct o:

"From Russia." Bond is subjects
to every conceivable danger
from being blown up by gunboat;
to being poisoned by Rosa Klebb'j
foot-dagger to being strangled bj
the coldly efficient murderer, Rer
Grant.
"Russia" is the best Bond fiin
to date, in large part because it
plays thp occasionally ridiculous
Fleming plots for numerous off
color jokes and spares no expenst
for spectacle.
Tho lonely figure darts help
lessly over the barren hillsides,
ducking a low-flying helicopter
whose pilots are trying to blow
him up with hand grenades. Trap
pod, he cowers behind a rock,
desperately tilting together his
collapsible rifle as the helicopter
hovers overhead lo drop the final,
fatal grenade.
Just in time, he assembles Iho
rifle and shoots the pilol. whose
grenade explodes in the helicop
ter, sending it twisting crazily to
the ground in a mass of flames.
Unfazed, the man runs to con
sole his frightened, curvaceous fe
male companion, who molts in his
arms as the helicopter explodes in
gorgeous sheets of orange flame
in the background.
The man? Who else but thai
hero of the British Secret Serv
ice, arch-enemy of all arch-fiends,
and conqueror of all voluptuous
women, James Bond?
Currently at Ihe Bijou Theatre
are the first two Bond movies,
"Dr. No " and"From Russia, With
Love." For those who enjoyed the
third Bond thriller, "Goidfinger,"
these two flicks are a must, in
addition to being a delightful
dead week study break.
Conncry, the Perfect Bond
The ingredients for Bond's
screen success are lan Fleming's
13 Bond classics, director Terence
Young's ability to improvise
imaginatively on the Fleming
plots, and Sean Connery. Connery
is the perfect Bond, exuding rug
ged, dark-eyed Irish virility, with
a powerful body and a face that
can change in an instant from
passionate tenderness to the cold
steel brutality which he needs to
survive as Agent 007.
