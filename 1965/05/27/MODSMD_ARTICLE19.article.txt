# MOVIE REVIEW
## ‘Lord Jim’ Total Disaster 
### FOSTER HIRSCH Drama Editor 
Richard Brooks has spent two
years writing and directing a
film version of "Lord Jim," and,
not to mince words, his efforts
have resulted in a spectacularly
dull and ragged picture.
The difficulties which Brooks
encountered in reworking for the
screen Conrad's intricately struc
tured novel suggest the problem
of adaptation. To transplant a
story from one medium to an
other necessitates some reorder
ing; a film, which is a visual ex
perience, obviously cannot be an
exact duplicate of a novel, but
rather must be an equivalent, an
interpretation.
Since he is working with dif
ferent materials, the adapter
should have some flexibility for
experimentation. Indeed, some of
the most successful adaptations
have expanded considerably on
their sources, and some of the

loudest failures have remained,
I too close to the original.
Lost Meaning
\ The failure of Brooks' film,
! therefore, is not that he has de
| parted from the novel in numer
i ous particulars; it is, rather, that
' he has lost every ounce of its
j meaning. In trying to deal with
j the novel at all, in fact, Brooks
I set for himself an all but: impos
! siblo task, since "Lord Jim" is a
! work of introspection. The core of
; the story, after all, is not in out-
I ward events, but in what tran
j spires in Jim's mind.
Given the visual nature of film,
| it takes a self-assured master to
convey the inner life of a char
i actor: Bergman has done it time
1 and again, Fellini did it splendidly
i in "BVa," but Brooks cannot do it.
j In his hands, the delicate, com
-1 plex psychology of Conrad's Jim |
!is vulgarized to a Walter Mitty
! character who dreams of per-'
i forming heroic deeds, is con
| fronted with failure, runs away
I to some exotic jungle, and gets in
; volved in a native uprising.
Unable to achieve any depth'
I in the portrayal of Jim's char-j
j acter, all that is left is a vapid,
I overblown Far East adventure
j story. But Brooks has not even j
i succeeded on this level. Badly |
1 edited, the chronology is incom- j
prehensible, and, inexcusably, a
1 good half of the film is devoted
i to the tedious details of the war
i between the natives of Patusan.
Simplisl ic Philosophy
There are some snatches of sim-1
; plistic philosophizing which are I
i offered in a miscalculated effort;
to add intellectual vigor, but the!
! didactic element is utterly incon- j
I gruous within the context of a,
i third-rate action film.
A great part of the film's fail-
I ure is Peter O'Toole. With no j
j sense of timing or economy, and
I with no variety whatsoever, ho in-
I vests every line with portentous
1 pauses, his voice trembles pseudo
dramaticaily, his baby-blue eyes
i flash self-consciously, his lips
I twitch as though he is continually
j on the verge of tears, and his
! whole face assumes throughout an
irritating, unmotivated expres
i sion of reverence.
It is all mannerism and artifice;
stylized and pretentious, he feels
nothing and consequently lie tells
us nothing about Jim.
Everyone else is almost equally |
i incompetent. For his role as an!

Oriental chieftain, Eli Wallach af
fects an accent which surely no
human being ever had; Dahlia
Lavi is totally inexpressive as the
girl; James Mason fumbles with
Gentleman Brown; Paul Lukas is
repulsively pious as Stein; and
Jack Hawkins, as Marlow, who is
supposed to be the narrator, in
explicably disappears a quarter of;
the way through.
To complete matters, the heavy. I
characterless music does not pro- j
vide a bit of atmosphere; the i
bland color photography has no
inventiveness or mood; and the
scenery, though filmed on loca
tion, looks altogether artificial.
