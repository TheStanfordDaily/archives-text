# Last-Second Football Victory Voted Sports Thrill of the Year
## 
### PETE KING 
The final, desperate seconds of
the Stanford - Oregon football
game, in which the Tribe pulled
out a 10-8 victory in the last 13
seconds, has been voted the Sports
Thrill of tlu> Year by the Daih
sports staff.
Those final moments: a) upset a
strongly favored Oregon team
which Stanford had last beaten in
1956, b> started coach John Ral
ston's winning ways with a re
vitalized team that won three of
its last four games, and c) pro
vided a heartening exception to
tho frequent tendency of Stanford
athletes to "choke up" in tense
moments.

Going into those last seconds,
Stanford had piled up a huge lead
in yardage, 34;>69, but trailer! 8-7
on the scorcboai i due to a 10-yard
Oregon pass interception, touch
down. and two-point conversion.
61-Yard Punt
Stanford had to surrender the
ball with less than three minutes
left in the game. Sophomore Dave
Lewis came through with a pic
ture-perfect. 61-yard punt that
rolled dead on the Oregon one
yard line.
After three plays had gained
only four yards, the Ducks punted
to their own 39-yard line.
Wit It less than a minute re
maining, quarterback Lewis lofted
a pass to the right sideline which
Bob Blunt caught on a dead run at
the 12-yard line before being
nudged out of bounds. One play
later, Braden Beck's accurate toe
booted the ball between the goal
posts for three points anrl victory.
Thirteen seconds were left.
Deafening Silence
The game was played in Port
land so the crowd was rleafeningly
silent, but the few Indian loyal
ists present and the many radio
listeners back at Stanford who
sweated out those final 'seconds
broke into unbelieving cheers at
the thrilling comeback.
Fortunately. football didn't
hold a monopoly on sports thrills
this past year. Last fall the cross
country team put on a closing!

four years.
In basketball, the Pavilion was
rocking as Stanford blit/ed na
tional champ UCLA in the sec
ond half, 49-37. which wasn't
enough to win the game, but made

the IJclans look ordinary. Most j
Isaiisfving victory was probably I
'the 87-61 win over USC, achieved
despite a game-delaying bomb
scare, flickering lights, and poor j
j officiating.
Other thrills included a 1-0 j
j wrestling win by Bruce Wilhelm |
thai gave Stanford second place in I
the conference, an SI track
win over San Jose State, a startl
ing upset of Washington's crew,
and a ninth-inning, 2-1 victory over
USC's baseball team. That win
contributed the most to Stanford's
first-place finish in the CIBA.
