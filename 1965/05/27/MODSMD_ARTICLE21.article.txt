### 
Stanford cricketers won the
Price Trophy in the play-off,
against Cal in the knock-out com- i
petition of the Northern Califor
nia Cricket Association at Berk-1
eley on Sunday. This marks Stan |
ford's first capturing of the 25- '
year-old trophy, and the first j
time one of the university teams,
including Cal and Davis, has
emerged champions in the North-!
ern California league.
The match was extremely tense, I
as four previous play-offs had |
each ended in a draw. Winning j
the loss, Stanford's captain I
Trevor Brown, a grad student in i
Communications, sent Cal in to!
bat. With accurate bowling by j
himself and Tutti Faber, who j
took five wickets each, Cal was |
all out for their lowest total, 111 [
runs.
The Stanford batting replied
solidly, given a good start by!
opening batsman Danjoo Ghista i
who scored an aggressive 30. The |
other opener, Keith Lowe, grad
student in English, scored 25. |
Trevor Brown, hitting three sixes i
which fell far out of the ballpark, i
brought the team total lo 105. j
making a personal total of 47.
Stanford then lost four wickets
without the addition of a single
run, but ihe winning runs came. |
climaxed by a beautiful sweep to
'he square-leg boundary by Ray j
