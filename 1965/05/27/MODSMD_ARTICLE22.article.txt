# ESTABLISHES STANFORD FOOTBALL
## Ralston: Coach of Year 
### PETE EAKLAND 
1965 has generally seen a rise
in athletic success at Stanford,
j Nothing remarkable, mind you,
but a potent of things to conic
| in the next few years since under-
I classmen have provided a signi
ficantly large part of ihc varsity
I talent. Stanford coaches share in
I the success and it can be to a
[great degree attributed to Ihem.
j Several coaches have especially
I distinguished themselves this
| year. The Stanford Daily salutes
I ihc entire coaching staff and
names football coach John Ral
ston as "Coach of the Year."
The baseball team, unheralded
early in the season, piied up vic
tories at a last rate and towards
the end of the season was ack
nowledged as the country's top
collegiate nine. Coach Dutch Feh
ring. head coach since 1956,
achieved his best season ever
with a 30-10 record. Thirty wins
is an all-time record for wins in
regular season play by Stanford.
Wrestling, a chronic loser for
many years, bailed itself out last
year and this year Coach Bill Le
land directed his mat men to a
strong second place finish in the
AAYVU championship meet.
Hard-nosed Tat ties
John Ralston, in his second
year of coaching at Stanford, fin
ished the year with a ">-5 record
which easily could have been 9-1.
His hard-nose tactics but pleasing
manner have earned him respect
of his players. He seeks to de
velop a football player who will
not let up but will continually
press his opponent and strike at
every opportunity. He gives an
example from boxing. "The great
boxer is not the one who throws
the knockout punch but the one
who has the instinct which en
ables him to hit his opponent
eight times on the way to the
canvas!!
Despite Ralston's weekly com
ments about lack of consistency,
this year's football team outward
ly appeared consistent, incapable |
of a total letdown such as the one

which tho Indians experienced
last year against Washington St.
Good
The defense was one of the
better units in the conference.
The secondary, which has been
a shaky pari of the defense, so
much so that it sometimes ap
peared that a quarterback could
launch a dirigible and complete
it, has improved steadily. The de
fensive line has few, if any, equiv
alents in the conference.
After a series of deliverances
from victory by the fates, the
Indians found themselves with a
losing 2-4 record. The margin be-
I tween victory and defeat is often
a small one. One referee's ill
conceived drop of a handkerchief
or a missed first down can be
the difference. All of a sudden,
| Si an ford was back on the win
ning beam. Ii toppled title con
lenders Oregon and Oregon State
in convincing fashion then over
turned Cal's "Big Game" hopes
after a close defeat to SC.
The Rebound
The rebound during the sea
| son's late stages is a credit to
Ralston. II was due in large pari
lo the emergence of Dave Lewis.
In direct contrasi to the Tommy
i Prothro "(Jet in there and stay in
there. You'll eventually gel the
job done" philosophy used with
Paul Brothers, Ralston brought
Lewis along slowly. Perhaps too
cautious and too conservative in
appraisal of his talent, Ralston
did not give Lewis chance to play
qb until after mid-season. One
can speculate about how Lewis
j would have performed if used
; earlier, but no one can argue with
the late-season results.
Success is a stimulus to fur
ther success. Ralston's football
| program at Stanford has pro
gressed like a series of Salk injec
tions. The first innoculation of
! victory serum whetted the team's
appetite. This year, the taste was
great, perhaps even to the point
! of being habit-forming. Watch out
< for the booster shot.
