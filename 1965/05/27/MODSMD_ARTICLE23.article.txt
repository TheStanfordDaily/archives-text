# Soto Freshman Threaten Elders In Intramural Race
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
â€¢ For the first time in recent
| years a freshmen team has been j
making serious inroads on upper
class domination of the intra j
mural leagues.
In the past three quarters Soto!
House of Wilbur Hall has com-'
: piled 7 league championships and
2 all-university titles. One of the'
i chief reasons for the athletic up
surge of Soto has been House
Jock Chairman, John Anderson.
Anderson personally quarter-j
backed the Soto touch football j
team to the league first place fin
ish, throwing 24 touchdown passes
during the season. The team j
reached the all-university quarter j
finals before being eliminated.
Wrestling Team Effort
Led by Andy Holmes, the Soto |
basketball team came out on top!
in league play, while the house!
grapplers took third place in the
university wrestling standings
with a fine general team effort.
Spring, supposedly the time of
apathy in Wilbur Houses, found
Soto taking an almost unprece
dented, two all-university cham
pionships. The track team, led by
John Luber's two sprint victories.

Chi 33-29 l L>.
The upset intramural victory of
the year came as Soto swam past
such favored teams as Sigma Chi.
j Cro Mem. D.IJ., and the Betas to
win the water polo tit le. The final
j victory was secured in a triple
: overtime, sudden death defeat of
1 the Cro Mem team.
Strong House Participation
Chairman Anderson credits
over all house enthusiasm for the
Soto success, noting that 69 of
the 9(5 house members had partici
pated on one or more of the Soto
House Intramural Teams this
year.
Strong volleyball teams and
general diversity has placed Soto
currently third in the 1M stand
ings for the year. In contrast,
last year's top frosh house fin
ished a dismal fourteenth at the
year's end. No freshman team won
an all-university championship
last year.
Even at this late date Soto con
tinues to move in on intramural
customs traditionally reserved
for their elders. Past victories
have been duly celebrated and
rumor has it that Soto is even
now assembling a team to chal
lenge the frisbee superiority of
the D.U.'s.
