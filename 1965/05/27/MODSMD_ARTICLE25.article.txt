# A 						PARTING SHOT
## Two More Seniors Examine Stanford 
### TOM COTTON (Fourth in a Series ANNE OSBORN (Third in a Series 
Although Stanford University has recently been brought to the
"edge of greatness" by the combination of an excellent faculty,
student body, and physical plant, the full realization of the poten
tial of that combination is being seriously hindered by several
elements which have become deeply imbedded in the academic

program. The first and most ob-*
vious of those is the grading sys-!
tern; the second is the "super-;
market theory" of education.
The system of grading on the
basis of quarterly examinations
in each course is usually justified
as providing a necessary incen
tive for. and objective measure
of. academic achievement. It is
clear, however, that the type of
"achievement" stimulated and
measured by such a system is
not necessarily related to the J
quality and depth of education, j
Unfortunately it is equally j
clear that grades do in fact pro-j
vide the primary academic moti- j
vat ion for many Stanford stu- '
dents. This dependence upon an
external incentive for academic!
performance (i.e. the need to ob-:
tain a high GPA in order to be [
admitted to a good graduate;
school) is in a sense both a symp-,
torn and a cause of the most seri- i
ous problem facing Stanford: its j
general failure to produce in its j
students that Lifetime commit-;
ment to learning per so which
should bo the primary goal of a
liberal education.
"Supermarket Theory"
The "supermarket theory" is
equally, if less obviously, a cause
of this failure. This approach,;
based on the questionable assump-,
tion that a liberal education can
be produced by exposure to aj
large and varied assortment of j
neatly packaged quarter-long j
courses, is dangerous in that it !
institutionalizes an undesirable!
fragmentation of the educational I
process.
There is unquestionably great
value in providing opportunities
for study in a broad range of
subjects. But completion of a sc
ries of required courses, no mat
ter how carefully selected, can '
guarantee only technical
competence and a command of
facts, not education. Ironically
the pressures of completing
course requirements often pre
vent the student from spending
the time necessary to relate dif
ferent areas of study to each i
other and to himself. A premium is
placed upon the compartmcntali
zation and regurgitation of facts j
rather than upon the synthesis i
and internalization of knowledge, i
These problems are not unique !
to Stanford, but are symptomatic '
of a widespread malaise in Amer
ican higher education. It. is par-1
tieularlv frustrating that they ,
exist here, however, since the'
quality )f the faculty and student |
body would make their solution '

j feasible. To list a few suggestions
! which could improve the aca
demic atmosphere at Stanford:
(1> Grades should bo based only
upon a student's performance
in his major field, as measured
by comprehensive examinations
i and assigned papers.
(21 More emphasis should be
placed on small seminars and
independent study. The faculty
time necessary for this could be
provided by eliminating those
numerous lecture courses which
are little more than audio-visual
| aids to difficult textbooks, and
which provide little significant
intellectual confrontation be
tween professor and student.
| (3) Those General Studies re
j quirements which provide only
breadth of factual information
I should be eliminated. For ex
ample, liberal arts majors
should be given the option of
taking a course in History and
Philosophy of Science to ful
i fill their Science requirement.
In addition, Senior Colloquia
should be improved, made op
tional. and not restricted to
seniors.
These changes would be an im
provement over the existing situ
ation; but their adoption would
' not necessarily solve the basic
■ problem of the failure of t lie
j academic program to provide the
intellectual stimulation necessary
! to give students a lasting per
' sonal commitment to education.
! Until this problem has been faced
and a solution found, Stanford
will have to be content to remain
teetering on the brink of great
ness.

. . . unci it's still a long way to Tipperary for us, too. Despite the
fact that this has been The Year of Liberation for the Stanford
Woman, the distaff side of the campus has somehow managed to
lag behind other—namely the male—segments of the University.
Stern lias its guest-in-residence program, Wilbur has its faculty

residents, guests-in-residence, its-*
Great Professor series, and now
the Faculty Master. Such intellec
tual intercourse is notably and ap
j pallingly lacking in the women's
residences. In fact, we almost live
j in isolation and a splendid isola-
I tion at that (the possible excep
tion being Union, which will join
| the curlew, Tyrannosaurus, and
| the dodo bird come next winter
! quarter).
And speaking of things extinct
'and extant . . . what about AWS'
. "Womens' Week," which habitu
ally concentrated on such things
i as "women in the world today,"
"women's role," and other such
fairly nauseating topics? No
longer with us dead for lack of
; interest.
The programs that have
thrived and grown are those sim
ilar to Roble's old Thursday Eve
-1 ning Series: lectures and discus-
I sions centered around intellectu-
I ally exciting topics. It is an Lnter-
I esting—and perhaps sad —com-
i mentary that our "liberation"
! has been social in character.
liitellcctiiul Shortcomings
Yet perhaps the greatest area
of need is not social, but intellec
; tual. Programs such as Roble's
j are all too few. An effort by worn
; en sponsors to set up a co op liv
ing group in Huston House this
I spring ( with an emphasis on fac
ulty contacts) met with the most
I discouraging of all answers: no
j answer at all.
Two years ago the old Faculty
Associate program in Roble and
i Branner was discarded in favor of
the so-called "Adviser Associate''
program where faculty and ad
ministrators serve as both ad

4
visers and faculty associates to a
corridor in one of the residences.
Fine in principle. But some of
the best-liked and most respected
professors in the old program
were forced to quit because of
the double load. For reasons of j
time or lack of inclination, many
of those left have done more ad
vising and less associating.
Why Frosh Dorms
But why should there be a |
i Roble or a Branner in the first |
I place or at least separate resi- \
; derices for freshman women?
Perhaps by reason of default
! we have failed to provide even the
barest semblance of a consistent
philosophical basis for the segre-!
! gation. When appropriate people i
1 are asked, something is mumbled 1
! about "developing class spirit." j
j By vote of Ihe student body itself,
| class government was abolished |
i two years ago. Perhaps the intel-1
J lectual results of this forced sep-:
aration are even more pathetic j
. . . everyone else in the dorm is
i taking civ, English, and bio, too. ;
! Students working on topics such j
as the sociology of knowledge are
all living in Flo Mo, Lag, or thej
Row. And with a scant three meal :
transfers available only on Tues
days arid Wednesdays? Ridicu
lous.
The in .c' c via I integrat ion of
; women students niij women into
ihe Univer ity Community has
I barely begun. Student Associates
!'or Branner and Roble is a step
in the right direction. So is coed
| housing. So is Mr. Guerard's
: freshman seminar program. We
can only hope this is just the be
i ginning.

in each course is usually justified
as providing a necessary incen

of. academic achievement. It is
clear, however, that the type of

not necessarily related to the J
quality and depth of education, j

dents. This dependence upon an
external incentive for academic!
performance (i.e. the need to ob-:

general failure to produce in its j
students that Lifetime commit-;

"Supermarket Theory"
The "supermarket theory" is
equally, if less obviously, a cause
of this failure. This approach,;

tion that a liberal education can
be produced by exposure to aj
large and varied assortment of j
neatly packaged quarter-long j
courses, is dangerous in that it !
institutionalizes an undesirable!
fragmentation of the educational I
process.
There is unquestionably great
value in providing opportunities
for study in a broad range of
subjects. But completion of a sc
ries of required courses, no mat
ter how carefully selected, can '
guarantee only technical
competence and a command of
facts, not education. Ironically
the pressures of completing
course requirements often pre
vent the student from spending
the time necessary to relate dif

other and to himself. A premium is
placed upon the compartmcntali

by comprehensive examinations
i and assigned papers.
(21 More emphasis should be
placed on small seminars and
independent study. The faculty
time necessary for this could be
provided by eliminating those
numerous lecture courses which
are little more than audio-visual

which provide little significant
intellectual confrontation be

There is unquestionably great

(21 More emphasis should be
placed on small seminars and
independent study. The faculty
time necessary for this could be
provided by eliminating those
numerous lecture courses which
are little more than audio-visual
| aids to difficult textbooks, and
which provide little significant
intellectual confrontation be
tween professor and student.
| (3) Those General Studies re
j quirements which provide only
breadth of factual information
I should be eliminated. For ex
ample, liberal arts majors
should be given the option of
taking a course in History and
Philosophy of Science to ful
i fill their Science requirement.
In addition, Senior Colloquia
should be improved, made op
tional. and not restricted to
seniors.
These changes would be an im
provement over the existing situ
ation; but their adoption would
' not necessarily solve the basic

j academic program to provide the
intellectual stimulation necessary

will have to be content to remain
teetering on the brink of great

the best-liked and most respected

were forced to quit because of

Although Stanford University has recently been brought to the
"edge of greatness" by the combination of an excellent faculty,
student body, and physical plant, the full realization of the poten
tial of that combination is being seriously hindered by several
elements which have become deeply imbedded in the academic

program. The first and most ob-*
vious of those is the grading sys-!
tern; the second is the "super-;
market theory" of education.
The system of grading on the
basis of quarterly examinations
in each course is usually justified
as providing a necessary incen
tive for. and objective measure
of. academic achievement. It is
clear, however, that the type of
"achievement" stimulated and
measured by such a system is
not necessarily related to the J
quality and depth of education, j
Unfortunately it is equally j
clear that grades do in fact pro-j
vide the primary academic moti- j
vat ion for many Stanford stu- '
dents. This dependence upon an
external incentive for academic!
performance (i.e. the need to ob-:
tain a high GPA in order to be [
admitted to a good graduate;
school) is in a sense both a symp-,
torn and a cause of the most seri- i
ous problem facing Stanford: its j
general failure to produce in its j
students that Lifetime commit-;
ment to learning per so which
should bo the primary goal of a
liberal education.
"Supermarket Theory"
The "supermarket theory" is
equally, if less obviously, a cause
of this failure. This approach,;
based on the questionable assump-,
tion that a liberal education can
be produced by exposure to aj
large and varied assortment of j
neatly packaged quarter-long j
