# One Speech Almost Made a Speaker
## 
### JUSTIN BECK 
The election of Jay Kadane as;
Speaker of the Legislature pro- j
duced some interesting sidelights!
on student politics in action.
Probably ihe most interesting!
was the success 1 of one speech, by j
Mike Cou/ens, who finished sec
ond in the balloting. Couzens
went into the meeting with very I
little support Kadane having!
sewed tip a sizable percentage
with a number of other candidates
including Couzens lagging far be
hind. His position was not altered
when the only definite conserva-1

live among the group, Bill Tif-i
j fany, withdrew, supporting Mike
j Collins.
But after giving his speech on
| the first ballot he came within
five votes of winning a majority,
with, only Kadane's sizeable bloc
I holding firm.
On the second Indlot he re
ceived only four more votes and
Kadane won, mainly because of
Kadane's well-known accomplish
ments and hard work this year.
Couzens, as parliamentarian, had
been politically neutral this year,
at the request of Ed Shaw, the
Speaker.
One of Kadane's aecomplish
, ments that his supporters were

quick to bring up was his bring-,
ing the graduate students into j
the Legislature. Several had. of!
course, been active before Kadane |
entered LASSU, but it was he who j
convinced the GCC that it could <
effectively work through student ;
government.
One of the fatalities of Cou- ;
zens' Thursday night speech was j
WEDGE's chairman Mike Collins. j
Collins, a liberal, had worked hard ;
to get the support of Tiffany and 1
others of the conservative Row, j
while keeping, at the same time, J
his liberal supporters. But Tif- i
fany and most of the conserva
tives, not really too happy with
the liberal Collins, jumped the
Couzens bandwagon as quickly

as possible, and Kadane was too
strong elsewhere for any other
candidate to have a chance.
One of the most important
things to note about the election
of Kadane is that most legislature
members are willing to work with
the GCC, and seem to lack the
fear of the liberal grads that
much of the rest of the campus
showed in the Presidential elec
tions 1h is spring.
One YR commented privately
after the meeting, "I voted for Ka
dane because I thought that he
was the best candidate but don't
lell Bob Naylor." Naylor, recently
elected YR President, feels that
the GCC is an FSM-type "radi
cal" organization.

been politically neutral this year,
at the request of Ed Shaw, the
Speaker.
One of Kadane's aecomplish
, ments that his supporters were

quick to bring up was his bring-,
ing the graduate students into j
the Legislature. Several had. of!
course, been active before Kadane |
entered LASSU, but it was he who j
convinced the GCC that it could <
effectively work through student ;
government.
One of the fatalities of Cou- ;
zens' Thursday night speech was j
WEDGE's chairman Mike Collins. j
Collins, a liberal, had worked hard ;
to get the support of Tiffany and 1
others of the conservative Row, j
while keeping, at the same time, J
his liberal supporters. But Tif- i
fany and most of the conserva
tives, not really too happy with
the liberal Collins, jumped the
Couzens bandwagon as quickly

as possible, and Kadane was too
strong elsewhere for any other
candidate to have a chance.
One of the most important
things to note about the election
of Kadane is that most legislature
members are willing to work with
the GCC, and seem to lack the
fear of the liberal grads that
much of the rest of the campus
showed in the Presidential elec
tions 1h is spring.
One YR commented privately
after the meeting, "I voted for Ka
dane because I thought that he
was the best candidate but don't
lell Bob Naylor." Naylor, recently
elected YR President, feels that
the GCC is an FSM-type "radi
cal" organization.
The election of Jay Kadane as;
Speaker of the Legislature pro- j
duced some interesting sidelights!
on student politics in action.
Probably ihe most interesting!
was the success 1 of one speech, by j
Mike Cou/ens, who finished sec
ond in the balloting. Couzens
went into the meeting with very I
little support Kadane having!
sewed tip a sizable percentage
with a number of other candidates
including Couzens lagging far be
hind. His position was not altered
when the only definite conserva-1

live among the group, Bill Tif-i
j fany, withdrew, supporting Mike
j Collins.
But after giving his speech on
| the first ballot he came within
five votes of winning a majority,
with, only Kadane's sizeable bloc
I holding firm.
On the second Indlot he re
ceived only four more votes and
Kadane won, mainly because of
Kadane's well-known accomplish
ments and hard work this year.
