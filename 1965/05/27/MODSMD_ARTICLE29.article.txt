This is even more true of the
Multiversity Stanford is becom

the facilities for higher education
increases, bigness and a certain
amount of depersonalization must
be the result. Limited amounts of
money and talented people must
be the foremost factors in any
administrative decision. The con
cerns of the student are often

The nature of the Multiversity,
at best, must be continuing con
