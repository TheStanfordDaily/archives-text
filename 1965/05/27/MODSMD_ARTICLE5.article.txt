# CHAPPIE PARODY
## Layboy II; an Issue To Be Remembered 
### ELLINGTON K. FARTHINGALE 
"Well, here we are again,
you hairy, suave, afflu
ent, intellectually aware, and
generally studly guys," reads
the introduction of the latest
issue of the Chaparral. And
so indeed they are with their
second issue in three weeks.
Put together with a veritable
orgasm of creative out pout
ing, this long-awaited Playhoy
parody is by far the l>est issue
put out by the Chappies all
year, and may well be the
most memorable since the
last Layboy issue four years
ago.
(For the uninitiated, that is
sue resulted in the magazine
being ordered to cease publi
cation until further notice,
and the editor being sus
pended from school. The chief
cause of the uproar was an
allegedly sacrilegious "ribald
classic" parody.)
We won't venture any opin
ions regarding sacrilegious
jokes, but as a parody, this
Layboy is far superior to its
predecessor, and indeed, to
any Chaparral parody in re
cent, memory.
Although unable to match
the expensive layout and num
erous color sections of the
authentic Playboy, Layboy,
Revisited, never-the-less dupli
cates Hugh Heffner's format
very accurately and includes
almost all of the regular Play
boy features.
Bouquets for the outstand
ing stories, in our opinion, go
equally to the lan Fleming
parody written by Have Har
ris, and the take-off on the
Playboy Philosophy written
by editor Hugh Betcha alias
Old Boy Dick Knersen.
The Fleming story, in addi
tion to being a very good par
ody of the Bond adventures,
is a mercilessly incisive but
never-t he-less funny lampoon
of the controversy earlier this
year over teaching methods in

the Hnglish Department.
ft relates the adventures of
special agent James Bong of
the espionage wing of the
Mothers for a Moral America
(MAMA) in his light to
th w art th e p Inns of
LKTCHKL, the organization
of salacious Fnglish T.A.'s,
to wipe out virginity at Stan
ford.
The. Layboy Philosophy is
equally funny, taking as a
basis the book "Sex, the Con
stitution and You, Friend,"
by Dr. Kalston Pfeen, "Dis
tinguished Harvard political
scientist," and proceeding
with typically Heffnerish se
mantic prestidigitations, to
belabor the question well be
yond the point of absurdity.
A hot contender for runner
up honors is "A Bod In The
Hand," a short story written
by "an anonymous former
editor," which deals with that
well known situation, the
botched seduction.
The story is written in dia
logue form with stream-of
consciousness interludes rep
resenting the thoughts of the
would-be seducer.
The magazine also includes
a "Cliche Field!rip" which is
a good imitation, though by
no means a parody, of a sim
ilar Playboy feature.
Rounding out the issue are
two rather blah photo fea
tures, "The Girls of Stan
ford," and "Layboy at his
Leisure," plus one of the l>est
collections of cartoons ever
featured in the Chappie. Out
standing among the cartoons
is a "Little Orfan Fanny"
strip which more than makes
up for its poor dialogue and
lack of substance with amaz
ingly good artwork.
And of course, not to he
overlooked is the center fold
out (that doesn't really fold
out) of Carol Doda, which, in
itself, would be enough to as
sure that this is an issue of
the Chappie that will not
soon be forgotten.

ford.
The. Layboy Philosophy is
equally funny, taking as a
basis the book "Sex, the Con
stitution and You, Friend,"
by Dr. Kalston Pfeen, "Dis

scientist," and proceeding
with typically Heffnerish se
mantic prestidigitations, to
belabor the question well be
yond the point of absurdity.
A hot contender for runner
up honors is "A Bod In The
Hand," a short story written
by "an anonymous former
editor," which deals with that
well known situation, the
botched seduction.
The story is written in dia
logue form with stream-of
consciousness interludes rep
resenting the thoughts of the
would-be seducer.
The magazine also includes
a "Cliche Field!rip" which is
a good imitation, though by
no means a parody, of a sim
ilar Playboy feature.
Rounding out the issue are
two rather blah photo fea
tures, "The Girls of Stan
ford," and "Layboy at his
Leisure," plus one of the l>est
collections of cartoons ever
featured in the Chappie. Out
standing among the cartoons
is a "Little Orfan Fanny"
strip which more than makes
up for its poor dialogue and
lack of substance with amaz
ingly good artwork.
And of course, not to he
overlooked is the center fold
out (that doesn't really fold
out) of Carol Doda, which, in
itself, would be enough to as
sure that this is an issue of
the Chappie that will not
soon be forgotten.
"Well, here we are again,
you hairy, suave, afflu
ent, intellectually aware, and
generally studly guys," reads
the introduction of the latest
issue of the Chaparral. And
so indeed they are with their
second issue in three weeks.
Put together with a veritable
orgasm of creative out pout
ing, this long-awaited Playhoy
parody is by far the l>est issue
put out by the Chappies all
year, and may well be the
most memorable since the
last Layboy issue four years
ago.
(For the uninitiated, that is
sue resulted in the magazine
being ordered to cease publi
cation until further notice,
and the editor being sus
pended from school. The chief
cause of the uproar was an
allegedly sacrilegious "ribald
classic" parody.)
We won't venture any opin
ions regarding sacrilegious
jokes, but as a parody, this
Layboy is far superior to its
predecessor, and indeed, to
any Chaparral parody in re
cent, memory.
Although unable to match
the expensive layout and num

authentic Playboy, Layboy,
Revisited, never-the-less dupli
cates Hugh Heffner's format
very accurately and includes
almost all of the regular Play

Bouquets for the outstand
