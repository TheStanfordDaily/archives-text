# Electric Lines Generate Feud
## 
### 
Another chapter unfolded yes
terday in the SLAC power line
controversy. Identical bills have
been introduced in both houses of
Congress to reverse the effect of
Federal District Court Judge
Frederick G. Hanley's order that
the Woodside power 1 lines must go
underground.
The original regulation under
which the court suit was brought
had stated the AEC could not
transmit electricity in violation
of federal, state, or local law.
AFC had interpreted "transmis
sion" as applying only to pow
er carried to customers, but the
court ruled "Electricity is elec
tricity," and forced the AFC wires
underground.
Tlit" proposed 220.000 volt trans
mission line would carry power to
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
on triple wires through Woodside.
In his ruling. Judge Hartley had
said the ordinances requiring
underground wiring dated back
to 1950 and that their purpose
was to preserve the natural beau
ty of the country.
Congressional action came just
as the two-day White House Con
ference on Natural Beauty was
breaking up, and a $200 million
conservation bill was introduced
in the House.
Congress Acts
Bills to remove the restriction
of the court ruling were intro
duced in the Senate by lowa Re
publican Bourke Hickenlooper
and Rhode Island Democrat John
Pastore, and in the House by two
Californians. Chat Ilolifield,
Democrat from Montebello. and
Craig Hosmer, Republican from
Long Beach.
Pastore and Ilolifield are co
chairmen of the joint atomic en
ergy committee. Pastore an
nounced a subcommittee will hold
hearings on Thursday.
Rep. J. Arthur Younger of San
Mateo has announced he will lead
the fight against the AEC in the
subcommittee hearing. Austin
Clapp. president of Save our Sky
line, lamented the 48-hour notice,
but said Woodside would be rep
resented.
History of Dispute
: The dispute erupted more than
J a year ago, when the San Mateo
! Planning Commission turned
1 down a request from Pacific Gas
and Electric to allow the overhead
lines to be built. Originally, tow
ers were to be 130 feet, but a
"compromise" trimmed the height
to 08 feet.
The AEC objected to the in
creased cost ($2.6 million against
$1 million per circuit), the extra
| time, and the inability to expand
i the lines, if wires went under
i ground.
Split the Cost
Another proposal was to split
the extra cost between AEC, Stan
ford. Woodside, PG&E, and San
Mateo County, but the AEC indi
; catecl it would be willing only to
support half the compromise fig
ure furnished by Save Our Sky
line's Robert McClosky. The Stan
ford trustees also rejected the
compromise.
Woodside Mayor Donald J.
Graham appealed to President
Johnson. The SOS then presented
a study showing land condomna
! tion costs at between $7.50.000 and
$1,300,000. PG&F had estimated
the coat ;it $137,000. The differ*
; once was attributed to damages
; for lost views due to the overhead
lines.
Just before construction was to
begin, in March 10(51, Dr. O. G.
Villard, Professor of Radio Sci
ence, revealed that overhead Lines
might cause short wave inter
ference with t;idio telescope sci
; once experiments.
The Green !•*< »f»f Ii i 11«- Committee

meanwhile, tried to collect. 10,000
signatures to send to Congress to
protest the overhead wires. An
other compromise, to route the
lines along the Junipero Serra
Freeway, was also rejected by the
San Mateo Planning Commission.
LASSU rejected both under
ground lines and (lie Junipero Ser
i'o compromise. Menlo Park con
demned the University for refus
ing the McClosky offer, and Sen
atorial candidate Pierre Salinger
announced AEC had agreed to
re-examine their position.
AEC threatened to condemn
land and install 130 foot poles it
San Mateo and Woodside would
not voluntarily ugive to 65 foot
poles. Then, AEC Chairman Glenn
T. Scaborg toured SLAC and
ruled AEC would build overhead
lines.
AKC- in ('(iiirt
Citizens then petitioned the
Public Utilities Commission to
prevent PG&E from installing the
lines. Eventually, PG&E was
prevented from constructing the
lines, and AEC took over the job
itself through condemnation.
The AEC's power to condemn,
in conflict with a 1950 Woodside
ordinance against overhead power
lines, was taken 1o court. The cit
izen's group won that battle, and
the war has now shifted to Con
gress.

The AEC's power to condemn,

Proposed Powerlines
Another chapter unfolded yes
terday in the SLAC power line
controversy. Identical bills have
been introduced in both houses of
Congress to reverse the effect of
Federal District Court Judge
Frederick G. Hanley's order that
the Woodside power 1 lines must go
underground.
The original regulation under
which the court suit was brought
had stated the AEC could not
transmit electricity in violation
of federal, state, or local law.
AFC had interpreted "transmis
sion" as applying only to pow
er carried to customers, but the
court ruled "Electricity is elec
tricity," and forced the AFC wires
underground.

the Stanford Linear Accelerator
on triple wires through Woodside.
In his ruling. Judge Hartley had
said the ordinances requiring
underground wiring dated back
to 1950 and that their purpose
was to preserve the natural beau
ty of the country.
Congressional action came just
as the two-day White House Con
ference on Natural Beauty was
breaking up, and a $200 million
conservation bill was introduced
in the House.

Bills to remove the restriction
of the court ruling were intro

History of Dispute

the Woodside power 1 lines must go
underground.
The original regulation under
which the court suit was brought
had stated the AEC could not
transmit electricity in violation
of federal, state, or local law.
AFC had interpreted "transmis
sion" as applying only to pow
er carried to customers, but the
court ruled "Electricity is elec
tricity," and forced the AFC wires
underground.
Tlit" proposed 220.000 volt trans
mission line would carry power to
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
on triple wires through Woodside.
In his ruling. Judge Hartley had
said the ordinances requiring
underground wiring dated back
to 1950 and that their purpose
was to preserve the natural beau
ty of the country.
Congressional action came just
as the two-day White House Con
ference on Natural Beauty was
breaking up, and a $200 million
conservation bill was introduced
in the House.
Congress Acts
Bills to remove the restriction
of the court ruling were intro
duced in the Senate by lowa Re
publican Bourke Hickenlooper
and Rhode Island Democrat John
Pastore, and in the House by two
Californians. Chat Ilolifield,
Democrat from Montebello. and
Craig Hosmer, Republican from
Long Beach.
Pastore and Ilolifield are co
chairmen of the joint atomic en
ergy committee. Pastore an
nounced a subcommittee will hold
hearings on Thursday.
Rep. J. Arthur Younger of San
Mateo has announced he will lead
the fight against the AEC in the
subcommittee hearing. Austin
Clapp. president of Save our Sky
line, lamented the 48-hour notice,
but said Woodside would be rep
resented.
History of Dispute
: The dispute erupted more than
J a year ago, when the San Mateo
! Planning Commission turned
1 down a request from Pacific Gas
and Electric to allow the overhead
lines to be built. Originally, tow
ers were to be 130 feet, but a
"compromise" trimmed the height
to 08 feet.
The AEC objected to the in
creased cost ($2.6 million against
$1 million per circuit), the extra
| time, and the inability to expand
i the lines, if wires went under
i ground.
Split the Cost
Another proposal was to split
the extra cost between AEC, Stan
ford. Woodside, PG&E, and San
Mateo County, but the AEC indi
; catecl it would be willing only to
support half the compromise fig
ure furnished by Save Our Sky
line's Robert McClosky. The Stan
ford trustees also rejected the
compromise.
Woodside Mayor Donald J.
Graham appealed to President
Johnson. The SOS then presented
a study showing land condomna
! tion costs at between $7.50.000 and
$1,300,000. PG&F had estimated
the coat ;it $137,000. The differ*
; once was attributed to damages
; for lost views due to the overhead
lines.
Just before construction was to
begin, in March 10(51, Dr. O. G.
Villard, Professor of Radio Sci
ence, revealed that overhead Lines
might cause short wave inter
ference with t;idio telescope sci
; once experiments.
The Green !•*< »f»f Ii i 11«- Committee

meanwhile, tried to collect. 10,000
signatures to send to Congress to
protest the overhead wires. An
other compromise, to route the
lines along the Junipero Serra
Freeway, was also rejected by the
San Mateo Planning Commission.
LASSU rejected both under
ground lines and (lie Junipero Ser
i'o compromise. Menlo Park con
demned the University for refus
ing the McClosky offer, and Sen
atorial candidate Pierre Salinger
announced AEC had agreed to
re-examine their position.
AEC threatened to condemn
land and install 130 foot poles it
San Mateo and Woodside would
not voluntarily ugive to 65 foot
poles. Then, AEC Chairman Glenn
T. Scaborg toured SLAC and
ruled AEC would build overhead
lines.
AKC- in ('(iiirt
Citizens then petitioned the
Public Utilities Commission to
prevent PG&E from installing the
lines. Eventually, PG&E was
prevented from constructing the
lines, and AEC took over the job
itself through condemnation.
The AEC's power to condemn,
in conflict with a 1950 Woodside
ordinance against overhead power
lines, was taken 1o court. The cit
izen's group won that battle, and
the war has now shifted to Con
gress.


Proposed Powerlines
Another chapter unfolded yes
terday in the SLAC power line
controversy. Identical bills have
been introduced in both houses of
Congress to reverse the effect of
Federal District Court Judge
Frederick G. Hanley's order that
the Woodside power 1 lines must go
underground.
