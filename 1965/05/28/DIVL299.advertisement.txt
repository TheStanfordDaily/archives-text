WE'RE STILL FOR FAIR HOUSING- I
ARE YOU?
Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair Housing is a non-profit, non-partisan organization
working to secure equal housing for all citizens, regardless of race, creed or color.
Many members of the Stanford community have joined our organization, which is
an outgrowth of the vigorous area campaign against Proposition 14. We are working
in support of fair housing legislation, to encourage realtors to adopt and observe codes
of oil-discrimination, to pin-point those areas where minority groups would be wel
comed as residents.
Our emphasis is 011 voluntary solutions to local housing discrimination; our goal
is to build an organization which can be a model of its kind or similar work through
out California.
To do so, we urgently need your support — moral, physical and financial. We
want to increase our membership to 5000 by July 4th to give us greater leverage, man
power and strength.
