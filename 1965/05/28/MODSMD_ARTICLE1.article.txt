• digarelic Health Warnings Struck
WASHINGTON A House committee approved Thursday a bill
that would require health warnings on cigarette packages but would

bar the Federal Trade Commission from requiring similar warnings
in advertising. The House bill is similar to a measure approved by a
Senate committee. The Senate version, however, would only suspend
for three years the FTC authority to require health warnings in
cigarette advertising.

• "Ombudsman" Hill Passes Committee
SACRAMENTO -- A bill to create an office of eitWens' represen
tative, or "ombudsman," was approved Thursday by the Assembly
Government Organization Committee.
"The bill's purpose is to establish an officer to work as an agent
or advocate for persons looking for aid from a stats agency," cx

i plained Larry Murgolis, administrative assistant to Assembly Speaker .
Jesse M. Unruh, D-Los Angeles, who sponsored the measure.
The term "ombudsman" comes from a similar office already in
existence in Sweden. The state needs to provide a means by which
a citizen "can effectively have his complaint heard about tlie actions
or inactions of a state administrative structure which often seems
to be impenetrable, amorphous, slow, and occasionally unjust,"
Unruh said in a prepared statement.

• Sonny "Too Slow To He a Fixer'
IVEW YORK "Sonny is too dull and too slow to be a fixer in a
fight," said Cassius Clay yesterday."He would have waited more
than one round to make it look good. 1 hit him flush with all of my
206 pounds, and they hated to give me credit."
Liston was home in Denver, complaining mildly about getting a
"fast shuffle" in the fight. "I thought maybe I didn't hear the bell
or something," he said.
A showing of the official fight movie in New York revealed that
Clay definitely did land a right hand to Liston's head, but it did not
appear to be a heavy blow. Clay was up on his toes, ready to move
back, when he threw the punch.
