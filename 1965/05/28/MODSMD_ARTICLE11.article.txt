# Union Protests Closing
## 
### HOLLY RUST 
Dean Donald Winbigler will
meet today with several giils from
Union Residence to discuss a peti
tion for delaying the closing of
Union until June 1966.
The petition, which was signed
' by 69 girls and several hashers,
was drawn up by Irene Mangold
and Linda Wheeler. It acknowl
edges Ihe inevitability of the clos
ing of Union but asks for the
delay out of consideration for the
| presenl residents.
According to Miss Wheeler, the
Union girls would like to know
| lluve things:
• Why the dorm has to close at
! all;
• Why, if the dorm must close, it
has to bo at ihc end of Autumn
i Quarter;
• Why, if it must close at the
end of Autumn Quarter, can't the
remodeling bo done a floor at a
lime, allowing the seniors to stay
; there for the lvst of the year.
She said that the announcement
early this spring that the dorm
would be closed in order to con
; vert it to administrative office
; came as a great surprise to the
' residents.

The girls were upset that no
one had consulted them about
closing the Union, she said. The
juniors, especially, felt il was not
fail- to make them move in the
middle of their senior year.
Many do not. want to go to the
High Rises as they see these as
breaking up dorm living alto
gether. Others object to the extra
expense involved.
They also wish not to be scat
tered among the various dorms.

i They fool, according to Miss
Wheeler, that such things about
' Union as its Monday teas and
faculty guest programs distin
■: guish it from other dorms.
A few months ago, (he idea of
1 closing the Union dining hall and
transferring meals to Stern was
i proposed. It was rejected after
' discussion with the Union girls
for reasons similar to those be
hind the current petition, Miss
Wheeler said.
