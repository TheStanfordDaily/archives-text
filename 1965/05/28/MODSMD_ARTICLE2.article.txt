The Legislature approved an
amendment by Speaker Ed Shaw
to a hill redefining Ihe member
ship and powers of Ihe Rules Com
mittee. Speaker-elect Jay Kadane
jopposed the amendment in vain,
| as ii easily passed by more than
j the two-thirds majority needed,
j The amendment severely cur
; tailed the present appointive pow
' er of the Speaker in two ways.
• It gave the Committee the
I power to appoint the members "of
• the other standing committees,
' temporary and special commit

tees, and representatives ol' ihe
Legislature required on various
boards and selection panels with
| in the Association."
• ll "obligated" the Speaker to
! appoint members of the Rules
I Committee "whose views reflect
I those of lite main body, such
| membership shall be on a propor-
I tional basis."
Shaw noted that the present
| "benevolent dictatorship" was det
! rimental to the ideal of a repre
sentative democratic assembly
and that the factions in LASSU
should be guaranteed represen
tation.
Kadane argued that ihe Rules
Committee must be administra
tive rather than political and that
it would be "impossible" to make
appointments on a proportional
i basis.
The Legislature also passed,
with one dissenting vote, the
j $114,400 196.1-66 master budget of
j the ASSU. An attempt by mem
j hers of the Political Union to add
• $2000 to that organization's
speakers' fund was voted down.
Earlier, LASSU had dealt with
two issues of overriding import
in a decisive manner. The price of
admission to the Sunday flicks
was raised to 2.1 cents. Then, Tim
Haight asked if there would be
police protection for topless swim
mer Carol Doda when she auto
graphs copies of "Layboy" in
front, of Tresidder today between
11 and 12.
