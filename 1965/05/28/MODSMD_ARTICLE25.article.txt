have qualified for Ihe NCAA

With so much talent on hand

place finish in 1963, and maybe
win it.

Quest ad, Hob Stoecker, and Jim
Fshelman. Questad has run 9.3
and 20.7 in both sprints this year
and has already beaten most of
his probable opposition at Berk

footer Gary Carlson and come
within three feet of Texas A&M's
powerful Randy Mat son.
Eshelman last week pole
vaulted 16- a .i, the best collegiate
efforl of 1965. He is capable of
much higher, barely missing 16-5
in the same meet.

the two relay teams. Eric Frische.

Questad have a world's best of
39.7 seconds in the HO relay. Tot
