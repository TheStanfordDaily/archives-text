###

a 4-1 victory over the New York
Yankees Thursday night.
The Yankees were held with
out a hit until Mickey Mantle and
Joe Pepitone hit consecutive
singles opening the fifth inning.
Sparma quickly pitched out of
the jam by striking out Tom
Thresh and getting Clete JBoyer
to hit into a double play.

The Washington Senators
handed Dean Chance his worst
pummeling in two seasons Thurs
day night, knocking out the Cy
Young Award Winner in the third
inning en route to a 9-6 victory
over the Los Angeles Angels.
It was Chance's fourth straight
defeat. He has won three games.
Chance was tagged for eight
hits and seven runs and walked
two in 2 2-3 innings.

ford Stadium's high jump pit,
which is the same one Valery
Brumel jumped 7-5 in three years
ago in the U.S.-Russia track meet
to sot a world record. In short,
it's a pretty fine jumping pit.
But Hanks had to use Angell
Field's much poorer high jump
pit for the rest of the season. He
went 6-8 four times, but those
performances occurred mostly on
opponents' fields.
Next year Hanks will be able
to use Stanford's main high jump
area for every meet, and a seven
foot jump is quite probable. Had
Ed used it more this season, tho
national freshman record of 7-1
would have been in danger.
A versatile athlete. Hanks also
pole-vaulted for Ihe Card frosh
team, taking a few seconds and
thirds with vaults as high as 11-6.
."Many Outstanding Frosh
The race for top frosh athlete
Was extremely close. Guard Art
Harris led the freshmen basket
bailors wilh fancy shooting and
some unbelievable ball handling.
He'll undoubtedly !>e a varsity
regular next season.
Four frosh swimmers broke
NCAA freshman or Stanford rec
ords. They are Gary Sheerer, Mike
Wall, Bob Momsen, and Mark
Parmcly. Donn Rennwick was a
fine football end. while Blaine
Ny<> provided beef in the lino. Hi
Lewis was the top slugger for
the frosh baseball team.

DETROIT i Al'i —Jw Sparma
scattered five hits and added to
his cause with a two-run double
in leading the Detroit Tigers to
a 4-1 victory over the New York
Yankees Thursday night.
The Yankees were held with
out a hit until Mickey Mantle and
Joe Pepitone hit consecutive
singles opening the fifth inning.
Sparma quickly pitched out of
the jam by striking out Tom
Thresh and getting Clete JBoyer
to hit into a double play.
Sparma's shutout, bid was
ruined with two out in the ninth
when Roger Maris homered.

The Washington Senators
handed Dean Chance his worst
pummeling in two seasons Thurs
day night, knocking out the Cy
Young Award Winner in the third
inning en route to a 9-6 victory
over the Los Angeles Angels.
It was Chance's fourth straight
defeat. He has won three games.
Chance was tagged for eight
hits and seven runs and walked
two in 2 2-3 innings.

ford Stadium's high jump pit,
which is the same one Valery
Brumel jumped 7-5 in three years
ago in the U.S.-Russia track meet
to sot a world record. In short,
it's a pretty fine jumping pit.
But Hanks had to use Angell
Field's much poorer high jump
pit for the rest of the season. He
went 6-8 four times, but those
performances occurred mostly on
opponents' fields.
Next year Hanks will be able
to use Stanford's main high jump
area for every meet, and a seven
foot jump is quite probable. Had
Ed used it more this season, tho
national freshman record of 7-1
would have been in danger.
A versatile athlete. Hanks also
pole-vaulted for Ihe Card frosh
team, taking a few seconds and
thirds with vaults as high as 11-6.
."Many Outstanding Frosh
The race for top frosh athlete
Was extremely close. Guard Art
Harris led the freshmen basket
bailors wilh fancy shooting and
some unbelievable ball handling.
He'll undoubtedly !>e a varsity
regular next season.
