# Some Random Reiterations
## 
### 
We have rarely hesitated, 011 this editorial
page, in this volume of The Daily, to speak w hen
we thought there were a few words to be said.
We have not always said all that needed to
be said. We have sometimes erred.
But we have rarely been reticent.
Thus we stand now, not on any grand final
proclamation, but merely on what we've said
in the some 65 issues of The Daily that have gone
before. And as we began with "Some Random
Thoughts," so we conclude with "Some Random
Reiterations."
We believe
That the life of the University community
and its members in inextricably involved in the
life of the total society.
Tliat the University must not only preserve
and promote that which is best in our society,
but must also criticize and condemn—and try
to change—that which is worst.
That scholarship, divorced from the active im
plications of scholarship, is sterile.
That the student is at once both learner unci
citizen.
That the student in his relation to student gov -
ernment has the same prerogative and responsi
bilities as the citizen in relation to his local
government.
That it is not possible to ignore these preroga
tives and responsibilities of societal existence
but only to abuse them.
That a student, or any other citizen, may, by
failing to care and failing to act, abdicate his re
sponsibility; but that he cannot abrogate the con
sequences of his abdication.
That the University should be governed in a

truly tripartite fashion with students and faculty
having a voice in the decision-making process
commesurate with their collective and individual
importance to the University community.
That the University can maintain intellectual
integrity without maintaining an ivory tower.
That, within the University community, 1111-
trammelcd idealism is a necessity, not a luxury,
of life.
That the end of structural reform within the
University should be the eradication of all forms
of regulation and restriction which hinder the
essential and broadly-defined educational busi
ness of the academic community.
That "getting the best students, the best fac
ulty. and the best physical plant and throwing
them together and seeing what happens" is no
substitute for a philosophy of education.
That the kind of bureaucracy which seeks to
manipulate situations and people for its own
structural comfort lias no place in the uni
versity community.
That structural reform (as of the Dean's of
fice), however necessary and good, w ill have no
salutary effect unless the men who "fill out the
new structure can command tlio mature respect
of those whom they are supposed to lead.
That students are not commodities to be ma
nipulated and processed.
That universities are not factories to be man
aged with efficienciency and without purpose.
That true communication exists only where
there is mutual respect.
That communication per sc is nothing unless
there is a possibility for affecting change.
That an individual, by acting up his beliefs,
can change the direction of human events.

That universities are not factories to be man
aged with efficienciency and without purpose.
That true communication exists only where
there is mutual respect.

That an individual, by acting up his beliefs,

We have rarely hesitated, 011 this editorial
page, in this volume of The Daily, to speak w hen
we thought there were a few words to be said.
We have not always said all that needed to
be said. We have sometimes erred.
But we have rarely been reticent.
Thus we stand now, not on any grand final
proclamation, but merely on what we've said
in the some 65 issues of The Daily that have gone
before. And as we began with "Some Random
Thoughts," so we conclude with "Some Random
Reiterations."
We believe
That the life of the University community
and its members in inextricably involved in the
life of the total society.
Tliat the University must not only preserve
and promote that which is best in our society,
but must also criticize and condemn—and try
to change—that which is worst.
That scholarship, divorced from the active im
plications of scholarship, is sterile.
That the student is at once both learner unci
citizen.
That the student in his relation to student gov -
ernment has the same prerogative and responsi
bilities as the citizen in relation to his local
government.
That it is not possible to ignore these preroga
tives and responsibilities of societal existence
but only to abuse them.
That a student, or any other citizen, may, by
failing to care and failing to act, abdicate his re
sponsibility; but that he cannot abrogate the con
sequences of his abdication.
That the University should be governed in a

truly tripartite fashion with students and faculty
having a voice in the decision-making process
commesurate with their collective and individual
importance to the University community.
That the University can maintain intellectual
integrity without maintaining an ivory tower.
That, within the University community, 1111-
trammelcd idealism is a necessity, not a luxury,
of life.
That the end of structural reform within the
University should be the eradication of all forms
of regulation and restriction which hinder the
essential and broadly-defined educational busi
ness of the academic community.
That "getting the best students, the best fac
ulty. and the best physical plant and throwing
them together and seeing what happens" is no
substitute for a philosophy of education.
That the kind of bureaucracy which seeks to
manipulate situations and people for its own
structural comfort lias no place in the uni
versity community.
That structural reform (as of the Dean's of
fice), however necessary and good, w ill have no
salutary effect unless the men who "fill out the
new structure can command tlio mature respect
of those whom they are supposed to lead.
That students are not commodities to be ma
nipulated and processed.
That universities are not factories to be man
aged with efficienciency and without purpose.
That true communication exists only where
there is mutual respect.
That communication per sc is nothing unless
there is a possibility for affecting change.
