# A 						PARTING SHOT
## Will Stanford Change? It's Doubtful 
### PAT STELL (Last in a Series 
If any changes arc to take
place in this university, Parting
Shots will not accomplish them.
We need, instead, a parting bar
rage to dent the solid sandstone
structure of Stanford U.
Administrators and faculty
members have encouraged stu
dent "concern" and "interest" in
the university system. They have
even gone so far as to welcome
suggestions. They have told many
"concerned" students that their
proposals would bo listened to if
they were will thought out, clear
ly presented, and if they had con
sidered possible and practical ob
jections.
Students, of course, must work
"responsibly," through university
channels. They must realize above
all that the university faces fi
nancial complications in effecting
many of its desired changes. In
four years, I have seen many stu
dents expend much with little
result.
Channels Created
Finally, some of us have under
stood. As Harold Taylor, former
president of Sarah Lawrence,
calmly explained, university ad
ministrations can create channels
as fast as students use them up.
Stanford, with its already notice
able lack of channels, has not

: bothered to open new ones. It
prefers the more discreet method
! of committee referral. If student
pressure is insistent, well, rea
sons can always be found for de
i cisions.
Recent developments have al
,tercd the administration's atti
tude somewhat. They're listening
I now, because they're scared
but the basic power structure has
not changed. Structurally, stu-
Idents still have nothing. Token
reprscntation on committees is
| impressive: those committees
dealing most directly with educa
tion still have no student mem
bers, nor have they any plans of
! admitting them. As one adminis
tration official phrased it. they
! are simply not willing to be com-
I pletely honest with students
about their own education.
Any student who has tried to
j institute the tiniest curricular
| change realizes the pervasiveness
j of structural inefficiency. He
must not only fight petitions and
(constant referral to "the next of
! lice" as in the past. lie must now
| contend with a choice between the
Offices of General Studies and
{Undergraduate Education which
; haven't yet managed to choose be
tween themselves. Duplication of
I administrative offices, confusion
! of duties, and indecision as to
1 where decisions are made are

only part of the "policy by de
fault" ethos. These failings are
balanced on the opposite end by
glaring gaps in the structure:
who on the vice-presidential level
; is responsible for education? And.
i all too often, responsibility is del
egated without the authority to
enforce the program.
Responsible Action
A student confronting the sys
tem has no power but that given
i by the presence of hope. Ineffec
| tive "responsible" action, if en-
I gaged in for long enough periods,
| eventually destroys that power,
i With no procedures available, he
gives up in disgust, disillusion
ment, or despair. One can under
stand administrative reactions in
! many situations but somehow,
one expects that a university will
j be different. One would like to
believe that in a community os
tensibly dedicated to learning,
that experimentation would be
. encouraged literally, as well as
j verbally.
Perhaps, however, parting shots
should not be fired at all. Par
ticipation in the university Sys
j tern lias, after all, been an adu-
I cational experience. I have
; learned that without institution-
I alized channels and designated
I procedures that there is very lit

tie communication. I have learned
to accept defeat (after defeat, |
after . . J, to experience frustra-1
tion in a mature way.
I have learned that idealism, |
even when coupled with pragma- i
tism, has little chance of success J
unless institutions are open to i
suggestion. 1 have learned that :
students are not expected to he
concerned with their own educa
tion. that student needs come last.
Valuable experience with "closed j
societies" might come in handy, I
should my idealism ever wander !
South.
Above all. 1 have learned that
the earthquake-proof structures'
i of Inner Quad will require more •
| than a few Parting Shots to |
I shake them.
If any changes arc to take
place in this university, Parting
Shots will not accomplish them.

I now, because they're scared
but the basic power structure has
not changed. Structurally, stu-
Idents still have nothing. Token
reprscntation on committees is

about their own education.
Any student who has tried to
j institute the tiniest curricular

j of structural inefficiency. He
must not only fight petitions and

balanced on the opposite end by
glaring gaps in the structure:
who on the vice-presidential level

i all too often, responsibility is del

Responsible Action
A student confronting the sys
tem has no power but that given
i by the presence of hope. Ineffec

I gaged in for long enough periods,
| eventually destroys that power,
i With no procedures available, he
gives up in disgust, disillusion

one expects that a university will

believe that in a community os
tensibly dedicated to learning,
that experimentation would be
. encouraged literally, as well as
j verbally.
Perhaps, however, parting shots
should not be fired at all. Par
ticipation in the university Sys
j tern lias, after all, been an adu-
I cational experience. I have
; learned that without institution-
I alized channels and designated
I procedures that there is very lit

tie communication. I have learned
to accept defeat (after defeat, |
after . . J, to experience frustra-1
tion in a mature way.
I have learned that idealism, |
even when coupled with pragma- i
tism, has little chance of success J
unless institutions are open to i
suggestion. 1 have learned that :
students are not expected to he
concerned with their own educa
tion. that student needs come last.
Valuable experience with "closed j
societies" might come in handy, I
should my idealism ever wander !
South.
Above all. 1 have learned that
the earthquake-proof structures'
i of Inner Quad will require more •
| than a few Parting Shots to |
I shake them.
If any changes arc to take
place in this university, Parting
Shots will not accomplish them.
We need, instead, a parting bar
rage to dent the solid sandstone
structure of Stanford U.
Administrators and faculty
members have encouraged stu
dent "concern" and "interest" in
the university system. They have
even gone so far as to welcome
suggestions. They have told many
"concerned" students that their
proposals would bo listened to if
they were will thought out, clear
ly presented, and if they had con
sidered possible and practical ob
jections.
Students, of course, must work
"responsibly," through university
channels. They must realize above
all that the university faces fi
nancial complications in effecting
many of its desired changes. In
four years, I have seen many stu
dents expend much with little
result.
Channels Created
Finally, some of us have under
stood. As Harold Taylor, former
president of Sarah Lawrence,
calmly explained, university ad
ministrations can create channels
as fast as students use them up.
Stanford, with its already notice
able lack of channels, has not

: bothered to open new ones. It
prefers the more discreet method
! of committee referral. If student
pressure is insistent, well, rea
sons can always be found for de
i cisions.

Responsible Action
A student confronting the sys
tem has no power but that given
i by the presence of hope. Ineffec
| tive "responsible" action, if en-
I gaged in for long enough periods,
| eventually destroys that power,
i With no procedures available, he
gives up in disgust, disillusion
ment, or despair. One can under
stand administrative reactions in
! many situations but somehow,
one expects that a university will
j be different. One would like to
believe that in a community os
tensibly dedicated to learning,
that experimentation would be
. encouraged literally, as well as
j verbally.
Perhaps, however, parting shots
should not be fired at all. Par
ticipation in the university Sys
j tern lias, after all, been an adu-
I cational experience. I have
; learned that without institution-
I alized channels and designated
I procedures that there is very lit

tie communication. I have learned
to accept defeat (after defeat, |
after . . J, to experience frustra-1
tion in a mature way.
I have learned that idealism, |
even when coupled with pragma- i
tism, has little chance of success J
unless institutions are open to i
suggestion. 1 have learned that :
students are not expected to he
concerned with their own educa
tion. that student needs come last.
Valuable experience with "closed j
societies" might come in handy, I
should my idealism ever wander !
South.
Above all. 1 have learned that
the earthquake-proof structures'
i of Inner Quad will require more •
| than a few Parting Shots to |
I shake them.
