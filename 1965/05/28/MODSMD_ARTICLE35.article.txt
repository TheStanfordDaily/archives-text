## Union Girls Protest Evictions 
### 
Editor. the Daily:
We object tthe sudden and
; arbitrary decision to close Union
Residence in December 1965. Such
1 a measure would result in com
plete dissolution of the only un
usual dorm on campus. We are
| sorry that its members will be:
: scattered among the vast num
ber of houses available to Stan
ford women. We do not condemn ;
other residences, but we regret j
the loss of our unique way of i
life and our corporate identity.
As consolation we have been 1
| offered first priority in a distant !
and highly sanitary high-rise ■
j apartment building with higher
| rent than any dormitory on cam
\ pus. It possesses, we understand.
1 no laundry service, no washing
; mechanism and no kitchen uten
sils. There is no dining room, no
lounge, not even a central meet
j ing place where we could assem
j ble or hold the teas which have
become a Union tradition. Wei
; eat alone in our rooms or be
i forced to buy meal tickets at En- j
j cina, some distance away. In
| short, the high-rise environment
■ would contribute as much as dis
; persion to the breakdown of an
extraordinary way of life. No
j more could we have faculty
guests. Or our courtyard. Or birds.
It would be the nadir of misery.
Besides the obvious suggestion !
— why not build a new office j
building? we have several al j
ternative plans.
1> A petition urging the admin
istration to consider- postpone- j
' ment of the closing date to June
1968 has been signed by (i(> Union
! girls and 4 hashers.
2) When we are forced to move, i
! we are willing to trade our prior-1
| ity with a majority of girls in one 1
I of the larger row houses, as it
j appears that a si/.eable proportion j
i of non-Union girls are interested J
! in moving to the high-rise apart
merits.
3> We would be willing to draw
in groups of 25-30 in the regular:
drawing.
4) We would consider a last j
resort the reservation of the;
ground floor of Union as a lounge ,
in which we could hold teas and i
have a piano.
As long as this University is a
residence university, we feel lhat
we should be allowed to partake
of its advantages as well as its
disadvantages. As it is now, we'
have been offered none but its
disadvar'rges including some of j
the disadvantages of one-choice J
off-campus living. Union women

ire not satisfied with this ar
rangement. So fai' wo have been
able lo manifest our dissa:isfnc
lion only by way >112 the aforemen
tioned petition urging postpone
ment.

* Lowenstein Praised
Editor, The Daily:
As seniors who knew Mr. Al
ia rd Lowenstein when he served
here during our freshman year.
v\ o would like to acknowledge his
contribution to Stanford. As an
instructor in political science, Mr.
Lowenstein aroused student inter
c i in African problems and par
ticularly those pertaining to the
Apartheid government of the Un
ion of South Africa. His personal
involvement during the previous
summer in opposing Apartheid
demonstrated by personal exam
ple that the individual can be ef
fective in combatting injustice
abroad.
As Director of Stern Hall and
Assistant Dean of Men, Mr. Low
enstein did much lo strengthen
the independent men's program.
More important, however, he
made himself available to ihe en
tire student body both as coun
selor and friend.
During the past two years Mr.
Lowcnstein's concern for civil
rights in America and his encour
agement of student participation
in this movement prompted many
Stanford sludents to become in
volved in Mississippi and else
where in the civil rights struggle.
Mr. Lowcnstein's friendship and
his personal commitment to stu
dents and social justice have been
a great influence on us.

• De Bivort Attacked
Editor, The Daily
I would like to recommend Mr.
Lawrence de Bivort's article on
Arab-Israeli tensions in today's
Daily to all Freshmen students of
History, Philosophy, Journalism,
etc. This article is an excellent
example of really BIASED report
ing. disguised as historical and
factual treatment of a rather corn

uliea ed subject. Mr. de I'.ivort is
lavish with his facts, his infor
mation; and he is more generous
about his omissions ... a fine
technique when you want to
prove your own point of view.
For instance. Mr. dp Vivort out
lines the recent history of the
Middle East by stressing the pacts
made between Britain and the
Arab States guaranteeing them
their independence . . . but very
conveniently forgets to mention
the Balfour Declaration of 1917
in which Britain also "looks fa
vorably on the creation of a Jew
ish homeland in Palestine." Nor
does he remind his readers that
Britain did not fulfill this promise
to the Jews either.
Mr. de Bivort seems to think
that the British governors stood
patiently but warily on the side
lines while millions of Jewish ref
ugees poured into Palestine from
Europe's DP camps; but he fails
to mention that only a small pro
portion were allowed to enter BE
FORE the creation of the State of
Israel. . . . because these same
British author ities sent them back
quite unceremoniously.
Finally, Mr. de Bivort again
implies that a true war situation
existed before the U.N. resolution
to partition Palestine, and he ex
plains I lie Arab Nations invasion
of Israel as a retaliatory measure
. . . to what? To its declaring it
self a STATE!!!!
The entire article very subtley
places all blame for Middle East
ern tensions squarely on the
shoulder of the Israelis (or as
Mr. de Bivort prefers to call
them: . . . "the Zionists" <?). He
ends with Ihe warning that then
tensions will grow.
Actually, a more just and truth
ful report of the Background to
the Arab-Israel Question would
indicate that there were extrem
ists on both sides and foolish, in
humane and unjust acts were
committed by both in the name
of patriotism and nationalism.
But since there is no turning any
clocks back, a Jewish State of
Israel is a reality today whether
its neighbors want it or not.
I agree that many Arabs have
been ihe most innocent and unfor
tunate victims of Ihese tensions
and warfare, but unless Ven
geance is an acceptable form of
justice today, the answer of
"greater tensions" . . . like "driv
ing the Jews into the sea" ... is

irmlly a wholesome solution for
any past injustices against their
Arab neighbors.
Mr. de Bivort could have con
cluded on a more hopeful note if
he had wanted to: that there is
an alternative, that peaceful co
existance is a phrase that could
mean something in the Middle
East, and that Arab and Jew have
much to give each other as neigh
bors. and perhaps, friends.

Editor's Note: Due to editing re
quirenients, two important points
were omitted from Mr. de Vivorts
I article on the ralestine problem.
The first was the lialfour Dec
| laration (1 i) 17), which states that
the British government would
| view with favor the establish
ment in Palestine of a Jewish
I Homeland, provided that the
j rights of the non-Jewish inliabi
| tants were not prejudiced, nor
the status of Jews living else
; where affected
..The second ommission was the
; Hussein • MeMahon ('orrespon-
I danee (1015) which pledged Brit
i ish efforts to Arab independence.
• Unfair (irilicism
I Editor, The Daily:
I Last fall a few of lis Stanford
I men expressed unfair criticism
, >112 Stanford women, and I wish
; to apologize for my participation
I and to state that I am aware of
i the women's predicament here,
i Having entered Stanford to pre
pare for a challenging career, a
! woman is besieged by men who
seem unable to appreciate her
| dedication to her studies and the
I overriding importance of her pro
' fessional goals. She must be for
j ever on guard against those who
j would intrude upon her scarce
I time, deceive her, and lure her
into involvement. It is a tribute
i to the perseverance of Stanford
: women that so few are diverted
from their careers, their purity,
or their spinsterhood while attend
ing this university.
However, female readers, have
compassion on the weaker sex, af
flicted with a whole range of emo
tions and baser instincts. All
would be well if only there were
a nearby supply of lesser women
to date the men as equals, leaving
Stanford's feminine elite free to
J pursue its exalted destiny.
