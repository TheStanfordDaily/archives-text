# SNCC: New Directions, New Problems
## 
### 
Editor's note: The following ar
ticle is a discussion of the na
ture and history of the split that
has developed in the civil rights
movement between the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Com
mittee (SNCC) and the so-called
"liberal establishment." It is
based on an interview with Alia id
K. Lowenstein, Assistant Dean of
Men at Stanford from 1961-62.
Lowenstein, as the article in
dicates, has been active, in one
capacity or another, in the civil
rights movement ever since his
undergraduate years at the Uni
versity of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. He is a former presi
dent of NSA. has worked on the
staffs of Hubert Humphrey and
Frank Graham, has written a
book, "Brutal Mandate," based
on his trip to South West Africa
(which lie recounted in testimony
before the United Nations), and
has worked with the non-commu
nist Opposition Forces in Spain.
He is both a lawyer and a teacher
ami has taught in llie Political Sci
ence departments at Stanford and
North Carolina State University
at Raleigh.
This year, he was, for a brief
time, a "Writer-inßesidenee" in
Vale's Stiles College and later
worked with the Ford Foundation
on problems of higher education.
He is now Director of the Encamp
ment for citizenship.

A year and a half ago, in Novem
ber of 1963, Bob Moses of SNCC,
addressing the Aaron Henry for
Governor Campaign victory rally,
spoke in praise of Professor Allard
K. Lowenstein and the contribu
tion he had made to the civil rights
struggle in Mississippi.
"He's a man who transcends a
lot of situations," Moses said. "He
was very deeply involved in this
campaign and while he wasn't suf
ficient, he was certainly necessary
to bring it off, and without him it
would never have come off as it
did."
Several months ago. words of
praise were once again raised for
Lowenstein ("who has as much a
claim as anyone to be called the
founder of the Mississippi Free

dom Democratic Party"), but this
time not by Moses or SNCC but by
Norman Thomas speaking in
angry defense of Lowenstein
against SNCC and its supporters
who, in some strange migration of
attitude and logic, have come to
regard, not only Lowenstein, but
the whole spectrum of "Liberals"
as "sellouts" and "traitors."
No ".Sellout"
In fact, there has been no "trea
son," no "sellout." by Lowenstein
or any other of the accused "Es
tablishment Liberals," but, rath
er, merely a perseverance in the
attitudes and aims which had once
been SNCC's own, and are no
more.
Most simply, the split between
SNCC and non-SNCC liberals can
be described in the following
terms: Lowenstein recognizes, and
has always recognized, that the
vote is only one step in a process
of attaining true freedom but
also recognizes that it is a nec
essary step indeed, a precondi
tion to other liberation.
"Obviously, the problem isn't
finished when we get the vote,"
he has said, "If when we get the
vote, we sink back into sloth, then
we've abandoned the field . . . The
vote only makes fundamental so
cial change possible; it does not
guarantee it."
SNCC. on the other hand, while
accepting with full vigor the no
tion that the vote doesn't guaran
tee social change, has apparently
rejected the concomitant belief
that the vote makes social change
possible.
The old slogan "One Man, One
Vote" the slogan under which
"liberals" and SNCC fought for
so long, together has become an
insufficient banner for SNCC's
new and vaguely defined "revo
lution."
Rallying < ry
"Docs voting make a man
free?" SNCC staff member (and
former Stanford student) Dennis
Sweeney asks. "Clearly it doesn't,"
he answers.
SNCC's new ralh ing cry (in the
words of Bob Moses) is this:
"The best way to keep a man a
slave is to give him a vote and
call him free."
Or, in lli»- more punrenl phrase

ology of SNCC's Stokley Char
miehael (speaking at a recent SOC
conference): "I don't believe in
majority vote; I thing majority
rule stinks."
Not too many years ago, how
ever. the idea of true "majority
rule" for Mississippi looked like
Utopia.
•The Whites Had Won'
"When I first got to Mississippi
(in July of 1963)," Lowenstein
remembered, "everything was
finished. The whites had won.
There were a few SNCC kids hold
ing out . . . but the people literally
had no hope l . . . They were so
scared . . . What could you do?"
What Lowenstein did was to
stay in Mississippi.
lie had gone to Mississippi that
year as a lawyer "because the only
white lawyer handling civil rights
cases had just been forced to leave
the state." He planned to stay a
couple of days no more."
"But then, he recalled, "it got
hard to leave ... I was only going
to stay for a short time . . . But
people were being beaten and ar
rested and terrorized and nobody
seemed to know or care . . .
"So I stayed."
Stone Wall
Lowenstein realized at once that
traditional procedures had run up
against a stone wall in Mississippi.
"What we had to do," he explain
ed; "was to figure out new tactics
. . . It seemed then that you
couldn't appeal to Washington, be
cause 1 nobody knew or cared . . .
We had to shake people on the
outside out of thinking that Mis
sissippi was just another state . .
Then, when all seemed hope
less, Lowenstein came up with the
idea for a Mock Vote drive
(eventually, "The Aaron Henry
for Governor Campaign") an
idea that proved to be the progen
itor of both the Mississippi Sum
mer Project and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
This is what Norman Thomas
and others mean when they say
that Lowenstein has as good a
claim as any to he called the
founder of the MFDP.
Lowenstein first thought that
perhaps Mississippi N eg rocs
should hold a "day of mourning"
as disenfranchi/ed South African

blacks had done at the time of the
Sharpesville Massacre.
"But then I thought," Lowen
stein recalled, "that it shouldn't
be a 'day of mourning'; it must be
a day of voting."
Protest Vote
The idea at first a "protest
vote"- was tried in Greenwood in
the state democratic primary
that summer, "but it didn't make
any headway."
Then, Bob Moses translated the
"protest vote" concept into a
"Mock Election" and shifted the
context from the primary election
to the general state election. Thus,
the "Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign," with Lowenstein as
chairman of the Campaign Advis
ory Committee, began 10 take
shape.
In retrospect, it seems clear
that the "Aaron Henry Compaign
was the turning point of the Mis
sissippi Movement the one tactic
that, after long years of failure,
finally showed the way to suc
cess.
The "Mock Vote' was aimed at
demonstrating both the desire of
the Mississippi Negro to vote and
the political inequities of the
state system which prevent him
from fulfilling that desire. It
succeeded, not only in that aim,
but in involving large numbers
of college students (particularly
students from Yale and Stan
ford) for the first time in the
harsh realities of Mississippi life.
This initial involvement paved the
way for the Mississippi Summer
Project and much of the rapid
progess that Mississippi lias wit
nessed to date.
The "Mock Election." conduct
ed concurrently with the official
state election, ran Aaron Henry,
a Negro pharmacist from Ciarks
dale, Mississippi, for governor and
the Reverend Edward King, Tuga
loo Chaplain, for Lieutenant gov
ernor.
The Mock Vote workers regis
tered Mississippi Negroes on their
own forms and conducted a free
dom election based on that regis
tration which drew over 100,000
local participants despite gross
intimidation from the white com
munity.
As election day neared and the
mock vote approached real suc
cess, harrassment of the voter reg
istration workers became so se-
as to effectively stall the
project.
At one of the lowest points in
the campaign, after his release
from jail, Lowenstein contacted
several students at Stanford and
told them how bad the situation
had become.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney,
immediately left for Mississippi to
help. Another cadre on the Stan
ford campus itself began to con
duct an informal fund-raising
drive.
Drive Know-Balled
As word of the Mock Vote
spread through the community,
the drive snow-balled. The peak
of interest was reached just be
fore the election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day for five
straight days to the state, turning
the tide for the Mock Vote —and,
in another sense, for Stanford it
self.
The Aaron Henry Campaign set
the stage for the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party (which
would challenge the seating of the
white Mississippi delegation at
the democratic convention in the
summer) and the Mississippi Sum
mer Project, which would bring
nearly 1,000 college students,
and clergymen to
work in the state.
The progress in Mississippi

hrough the Aaron Henry period
had been accomplished by work
ing coalitions of groups and view
points. But as the prospect of a
massive summer project loomed
large on the horizon, there were
signs that this coalition had be
gun to crack.
"The SNCC people were al
ready showing resentment," Low
enstein explained. "They acted as
if they should have a monopoly
on decision-making . . . we dis
agreed with some of the decisions,
but we accepted them."
Convention Challenge
By the end of the summer, how
ever, after the Atlantic City Con
vention challenge, the cracks in
the coalition had developed into
an irreparable schism—largely at
SNCC's own insistence.
SNCC had come to regard the
Atlantic City Convention as a
time of great dissilutionment —
proof, in the words of Denis
Sweeney, that democratic "politics
isn't all it's cracked up to be."
Far From Betrayal
Lowenstein (Adviser to the
MFDP delegation), on the other
hand, takes a very different
view. "Far from being a 'betrayal'
or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was
one of the greatest proofs of the
vitality of American democracy—
when the President of the United
States, at the height of his
power, was forced—forced by the
aroused conscience of the nation—
to move, to compromise."

After the convention, Lowen
stein, who, in fact, had spoken
agaist accepting the compromise
on MFDP seating (not because he
was against compromise, but be
cause he thought they could get
a better one), and other so-called
"middle-class liberals," were cas
tigated by SNCC as "traitors"
and "sellouts." The name-calling
continued through the period of
the MFDP Congressional chal
lenge (for which Lowenstein,
nevertheless, worked) and, in
fact, has deepened rather than
abated with time as the SNCC ide
ology has hardened. (Paradox
ically, Lowenstein has been al
most simultaneously attacked by
both the far left and the far
right—by the one for being "a
red-baiter" and by the other for
being "dangerously radical."
Vicious Circle
"The abuse of the far left and
far right came through in a really
vicious circle," he commented.
"The issue now is," Lowenstein
said, "do you use Mississippi as a
hook on which to hang a na
tional revolution, or do you try to
bring Mississippi first into keep
ing with the national norm."
"What we're trying to do is to
get the Mississippi Negroes the
opportunity to decide their own
future as free men."
The People
So, ostensibly, is SNCC. Indeed,
no group has talked more about
"letting the people make the ic
portant decisions."
"But look what they mean by

"the people,' " an observer com
mented. "First, it's not all of the
people, but only the Negro people.
But it's not all of the Negro peo
ple either. It's the "proletarian"
Negro people. And it's not even
all the "proletarian" Negro peo
ple. It's just those who haven't
been "hopelessly brainwashed" by
middle class values."
Negro Proli lariat
"It's a great mistake to seek to
enlarge class consciousness in the
United States. We're Interested in
everybody getting freedom,"
added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC
movement has lon gsince abandon
ed the concept of a Civil Rights
movement per se and has (in
theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple
with the internal "hang-up" that
are the true blocks to human
freedom.
Moreover, SNCC, in its pursuit
of true revolution, seems to have
rejected traditional political
means of refrom (including the
structure of the democratic par
ty) in disgust as one of the more
bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and
"sick" society.
Proper Procedures
Martin Luther King, of course,
has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein
emphasizes, "he abandoned proper
procedures in order to make them
work and to finally return to
them."
SNCC, on the other hand, .shows
no desire to return to proper pro
cedures or channels once they
have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis
sippi in the past year and a half
toward "removing the external
blocks to freedom" has been im
mense, in Lowenstein's view. But
there is a danger now, that lib

orals, in false satisfaction, or ig
norance, will abandon the field
before fundamental change can be
accomplished.
Monolithic View
"SNCC's '100 per cent' approach
is dangerous," Lowenstein said.
"You're either a 'true believer' or
a 'sell-out.'"
The true hope for change, Low
enstein stressed, is not in ideolog
ical purity, but in coalition.
"The concerned middle class
should be engaged," he said. "You
can be militant and still be ra
tional—you can be militant for
democracy as well as for anarchy
It
Ureal Opportunity
"I see a great opportunity now,"
he continued, "for awakened lib
erals (a very proud term) —for a
vaste coalition of conscience . . .
We won't get everything we want
all at once . . . but we're not in a
revolutionary situation . . . There
are pockets of injustice that can,
and must, be wiped out.
"The crux of the matter is this:
unless "you get the conscience
aroused of the people who are con
tent, you can't get the changes
for the people who aren't."
"What we're going to have to
learn now (in the Civil Rights
Movement ILowenstein con
cluded, is to work out our prob
lems with a sense of mutual re
spect . . . "If finding common
ground is betrayal of principles,
then we certainly don't want to
ask them (SNCC) to betray their
principles . . . It's their decision."

A year and a half ago, in Novem
ber of 1963, Bob Moses of SNCC,
addressing the Aaron Henry for
Governor Campaign victory rally,
spoke in praise of Professor Allard
K. Lowenstein and the contribu
tion he had made to the civil rights
struggle in Mississippi.
"He's a man who transcends a
lot of situations," Moses said. "He
was very deeply involved in this
campaign and while he wasn't suf
ficient, he was certainly necessary
to bring it off, and without him it
would never have come off as it
did."
Several months ago. words of
praise were once again raised for
Lowenstein ("who has as much a
claim as anyone to be called the
founder of the Mississippi Free

dom Democratic Party"), but this
time not by Moses or SNCC but by
Norman Thomas speaking in
angry defense of Lowenstein
against SNCC and its supporters
who, in some strange migration of
attitude and logic, have come to
regard, not only Lowenstein, but
the whole spectrum of "Liberals"
as "sellouts" and "traitors."
No ".Sellout"
In fact, there has been no "trea
son," no "sellout." by Lowenstein
or any other of the accused "Es
tablishment Liberals," but, rath
er, merely a perseverance in the
attitudes and aims which had once
been SNCC's own, and are no
more.
Most simply, the split between
SNCC and non-SNCC liberals can
be described in the following
terms: Lowenstein recognizes, and
has always recognized, that the
vote is only one step in a process
of attaining true freedom but
also recognizes that it is a nec
essary step indeed, a precondi
tion to other liberation.
"Obviously, the problem isn't
finished when we get the vote,"
he has said, "If when we get the
vote, we sink back into sloth, then
we've abandoned the field . . . The
vote only makes fundamental so
cial change possible; it does not
guarantee it."
SNCC. on the other hand, while
accepting with full vigor the no
tion that the vote doesn't guaran
tee social change, has apparently
rejected the concomitant belief
that the vote makes social change
possible.
The old slogan "One Man, One
Vote" the slogan under which
"liberals" and SNCC fought for
so long, together has become an
insufficient banner for SNCC's
new and vaguely defined "revo
lution."
Rallying < ry
"Docs voting make a man
free?" SNCC staff member (and
former Stanford student) Dennis
Sweeney asks. "Clearly it doesn't,"
he answers.
SNCC's new ralh ing cry (in the
words of Bob Moses) is this:
"The best way to keep a man a
slave is to give him a vote and
call him free."
Or, in lli»- more punrenl phrase

ology of SNCC's Stokley Char
miehael (speaking at a recent SOC
conference): "I don't believe in
majority vote; I thing majority
rule stinks."
Not too many years ago, how
ever. the idea of true "majority
rule" for Mississippi looked like
Utopia.
•The Whites Had Won'
"When I first got to Mississippi
(in July of 1963)," Lowenstein
remembered, "everything was
finished. The whites had won.
There were a few SNCC kids hold
ing out . . . but the people literally
had no hope l . . . They were so
scared . . . What could you do?"
What Lowenstein did was to
stay in Mississippi.
lie had gone to Mississippi that
year as a lawyer "because the only
white lawyer handling civil rights
cases had just been forced to leave
the state." He planned to stay a
couple of days no more."
"But then, he recalled, "it got
hard to leave ... I was only going
to stay for a short time . . . But
people were being beaten and ar
rested and terrorized and nobody
seemed to know or care . . .
"So I stayed."
Stone Wall
Lowenstein realized at once that
traditional procedures had run up
against a stone wall in Mississippi.
"What we had to do," he explain
ed; "was to figure out new tactics
. . . It seemed then that you
couldn't appeal to Washington, be
cause 1 nobody knew or cared . . .
We had to shake people on the
outside out of thinking that Mis
sissippi was just another state . .
Then, when all seemed hope
less, Lowenstein came up with the
idea for a Mock Vote drive
(eventually, "The Aaron Henry
for Governor Campaign") an
idea that proved to be the progen
itor of both the Mississippi Sum
mer Project and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
This is what Norman Thomas
and others mean when they say
that Lowenstein has as good a
claim as any to he called the
founder of the MFDP.
Lowenstein first thought that
perhaps Mississippi N eg rocs
should hold a "day of mourning"
as disenfranchi/ed South African

blacks had done at the time of the
Sharpesville Massacre.
"But then I thought," Lowen
stein recalled, "that it shouldn't
be a 'day of mourning'; it must be
a day of voting."
Protest Vote
The idea at first a "protest
vote"- was tried in Greenwood in
the state democratic primary
that summer, "but it didn't make
any headway."
Then, Bob Moses translated the
"protest vote" concept into a
"Mock Election" and shifted the
context from the primary election
to the general state election. Thus,
the "Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign," with Lowenstein as
chairman of the Campaign Advis
ory Committee, began 10 take
shape.
In retrospect, it seems clear
that the "Aaron Henry Compaign
was the turning point of the Mis
sissippi Movement the one tactic
that, after long years of failure,
finally showed the way to suc
cess.
The "Mock Vote' was aimed at
demonstrating both the desire of
the Mississippi Negro to vote and
the political inequities of the
state system which prevent him
from fulfilling that desire. It
succeeded, not only in that aim,
but in involving large numbers
of college students (particularly
students from Yale and Stan
ford) for the first time in the
harsh realities of Mississippi life.
This initial involvement paved the
way for the Mississippi Summer
Project and much of the rapid
progess that Mississippi lias wit
nessed to date.
The "Mock Election." conduct
ed concurrently with the official
state election, ran Aaron Henry,
a Negro pharmacist from Ciarks
dale, Mississippi, for governor and
the Reverend Edward King, Tuga
loo Chaplain, for Lieutenant gov
ernor.
The Mock Vote workers regis
tered Mississippi Negroes on their
own forms and conducted a free
dom election based on that regis
tration which drew over 100,000
local participants despite gross
intimidation from the white com
munity.
As election day neared and the
mock vote approached real suc
cess, harrassment of the voter reg
istration workers became so se-
as to effectively stall the
project.
At one of the lowest points in
the campaign, after his release
from jail, Lowenstein contacted
several students at Stanford and
told them how bad the situation
had become.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney,
immediately left for Mississippi to
help. Another cadre on the Stan
ford campus itself began to con
duct an informal fund-raising
drive.
Drive Know-Balled
As word of the Mock Vote
spread through the community,
the drive snow-balled. The peak
of interest was reached just be
fore the election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day for five
straight days to the state, turning
the tide for the Mock Vote —and,
in another sense, for Stanford it
self.
The Aaron Henry Campaign set
the stage for the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party (which
would challenge the seating of the
white Mississippi delegation at
the democratic convention in the
summer) and the Mississippi Sum
mer Project, which would bring
nearly 1,000 college students,
and clergymen to
work in the state.
The progress in Mississippi

hrough the Aaron Henry period
had been accomplished by work
ing coalitions of groups and view
points. But as the prospect of a
massive summer project loomed
large on the horizon, there were
signs that this coalition had be
gun to crack.
"The SNCC people were al
ready showing resentment," Low
enstein explained. "They acted as
if they should have a monopoly
on decision-making . . . we dis
agreed with some of the decisions,
but we accepted them."
Convention Challenge
By the end of the summer, how
ever, after the Atlantic City Con
vention challenge, the cracks in
the coalition had developed into
an irreparable schism—largely at
SNCC's own insistence.
SNCC had come to regard the
Atlantic City Convention as a
time of great dissilutionment —
proof, in the words of Denis
Sweeney, that democratic "politics
isn't all it's cracked up to be."
Far From Betrayal
Lowenstein (Adviser to the
MFDP delegation), on the other
hand, takes a very different
view. "Far from being a 'betrayal'
or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was
one of the greatest proofs of the
vitality of American democracy—
when the President of the United
States, at the height of his
power, was forced—forced by the
aroused conscience of the nation—
to move, to compromise."

After the convention, Lowen
stein, who, in fact, had spoken
agaist accepting the compromise
on MFDP seating (not because he
was against compromise, but be
cause he thought they could get
a better one), and other so-called
"middle-class liberals," were cas
tigated by SNCC as "traitors"
and "sellouts." The name-calling
continued through the period of
the MFDP Congressional chal
lenge (for which Lowenstein,
nevertheless, worked) and, in
fact, has deepened rather than
abated with time as the SNCC ide
ology has hardened. (Paradox
ically, Lowenstein has been al
most simultaneously attacked by
both the far left and the far
right—by the one for being "a
red-baiter" and by the other for
being "dangerously radical."
Vicious Circle
"The abuse of the far left and
far right came through in a really
vicious circle," he commented.
"The issue now is," Lowenstein
said, "do you use Mississippi as a
hook on which to hang a na
tional revolution, or do you try to
bring Mississippi first into keep
ing with the national norm."
"What we're trying to do is to
get the Mississippi Negroes the
opportunity to decide their own
future as free men."
The People
So, ostensibly, is SNCC. Indeed,
no group has talked more about
"letting the people make the ic
portant decisions."
"But look what they mean by

"the people,' " an observer com
mented. "First, it's not all of the
people, but only the Negro people.
But it's not all of the Negro peo
ple either. It's the "proletarian"
Negro people. And it's not even
all the "proletarian" Negro peo
ple. It's just those who haven't
been "hopelessly brainwashed" by
middle class values."
Negro Proli lariat
"It's a great mistake to seek to
enlarge class consciousness in the
United States. We're Interested in
everybody getting freedom,"
added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC
movement has lon gsince abandon
ed the concept of a Civil Rights
movement per se and has (in
theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple
with the internal "hang-up" that
are the true blocks to human
freedom.
Moreover, SNCC, in its pursuit
of true revolution, seems to have
rejected traditional political
means of refrom (including the
structure of the democratic par
ty) in disgust as one of the more
bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and
"sick" society.
Proper Procedures
Martin Luther King, of course,
has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein
emphasizes, "he abandoned proper
procedures in order to make them
work and to finally return to
them."
SNCC, on the other hand, .shows
no desire to return to proper pro
cedures or channels once they
have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis
sippi in the past year and a half
toward "removing the external
blocks to freedom" has been im
mense, in Lowenstein's view. But
there is a danger now, that lib

orals, in false satisfaction, or ig
norance, will abandon the field
before fundamental change can be
accomplished.
Monolithic View
"SNCC's '100 per cent' approach
is dangerous," Lowenstein said.
"You're either a 'true believer' or
a 'sell-out.'"
The true hope for change, Low
enstein stressed, is not in ideolog
ical purity, but in coalition.
"The concerned middle class
should be engaged," he said. "You
can be militant and still be ra
tional—you can be militant for
democracy as well as for anarchy
It
Ureal Opportunity
"I see a great opportunity now,"
he continued, "for awakened lib
erals (a very proud term) —for a
vaste coalition of conscience . . .
We won't get everything we want
all at once . . . but we're not in a
revolutionary situation . . . There
are pockets of injustice that can,

"The crux of the matter is this:

have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis
sippi in the past year and a half
toward "removing the external
blocks to freedom" has been im
mense, in Lowenstein's view. But
there is a danger now, that lib

orals, in false satisfaction, or ig
norance, will abandon the field
before fundamental change can be
accomplished.
Monolithic View
"SNCC's '100 per cent' approach
is dangerous," Lowenstein said.
"You're either a 'true believer' or
a 'sell-out.'"
The true hope for change, Low
enstein stressed, is not in ideolog
ical purity, but in coalition.
"The concerned middle class
should be engaged," he said. "You
can be militant and still be ra
tional—you can be militant for
democracy as well as for anarchy
It
Ureal Opportunity
"I see a great opportunity now,"
he continued, "for awakened lib
erals (a very proud term) —for a
vaste coalition of conscience . . .
We won't get everything we want
all at once . . . but we're not in a
revolutionary situation . . . There
are pockets of injustice that can,
and must, be wiped out.
"The crux of the matter is this:
unless "you get the conscience
aroused of the people who are con
tent, you can't get the changes
for the people who aren't."
"What we're going to have to
learn now (in the Civil Rights
Movement ILowenstein con
cluded, is to work out our prob
lems with a sense of mutual re
spect . . . "If finding common
ground is betrayal of principles,
then we certainly don't want to
ask them (SNCC) to betray their
principles . . . It's their decision."

A year and a half ago, in Novem
ber of 1963, Bob Moses of SNCC,
addressing the Aaron Henry for
Governor Campaign victory rally,
spoke in praise of Professor Allard
K. Lowenstein and the contribu
tion he had made to the civil rights
struggle in Mississippi.
"He's a man who transcends a
lot of situations," Moses said. "He
was very deeply involved in this
campaign and while he wasn't suf
ficient, he was certainly necessary
to bring it off, and without him it
would never have come off as it
did."
Several months ago. words of
praise were once again raised for
Lowenstein ("who has as much a
claim as anyone to be called the
founder of the Mississippi Free

dom Democratic Party"), but this
time not by Moses or SNCC but by
Norman Thomas speaking in
angry defense of Lowenstein
against SNCC and its supporters
who, in some strange migration of
attitude and logic, have come to
regard, not only Lowenstein, but
the whole spectrum of "Liberals"
as "sellouts" and "traitors."
No ".Sellout"
In fact, there has been no "trea
son," no "sellout." by Lowenstein
or any other of the accused "Es
tablishment Liberals," but, rath
er, merely a perseverance in the
attitudes and aims which had once
been SNCC's own, and are no
more.
Most simply, the split between
SNCC and non-SNCC liberals can
be described in the following
terms: Lowenstein recognizes, and
has always recognized, that the
vote is only one step in a process
of attaining true freedom but
also recognizes that it is a nec
essary step indeed, a precondi
tion to other liberation.
"Obviously, the problem isn't
finished when we get the vote,"
he has said, "If when we get the
vote, we sink back into sloth, then
we've abandoned the field . . . The
vote only makes fundamental so
cial change possible; it does not
guarantee it."
SNCC. on the other hand, while
accepting with full vigor the no
tion that the vote doesn't guaran
tee social change, has apparently
rejected the concomitant belief
that the vote makes social change
possible.
The old slogan "One Man, One
Vote" the slogan under which
"liberals" and SNCC fought for
so long, together has become an
insufficient banner for SNCC's
new and vaguely defined "revo
lution."
Rallying < ry
"Docs voting make a man
free?" SNCC staff member (and
former Stanford student) Dennis
Sweeney asks. "Clearly it doesn't,"
he answers.
SNCC's new ralh ing cry (in the
words of Bob Moses) is this:
"The best way to keep a man a
slave is to give him a vote and
call him free."
Or, in lli»- more punrenl phrase

ology of SNCC's Stokley Char
miehael (speaking at a recent SOC
conference): "I don't believe in
majority vote; I thing majority
rule stinks."
Not too many years ago, how
ever. the idea of true "majority
rule" for Mississippi looked like
Utopia.
•The Whites Had Won'
"When I first got to Mississippi
(in July of 1963)," Lowenstein
remembered, "everything was
finished. The whites had won.
There were a few SNCC kids hold
ing out . . . but the people literally
had no hope l . . . They were so
scared . . . What could you do?"
What Lowenstein did was to
stay in Mississippi.
lie had gone to Mississippi that
year as a lawyer "because the only
white lawyer handling civil rights
cases had just been forced to leave
the state." He planned to stay a
couple of days no more."
"But then, he recalled, "it got
hard to leave ... I was only going
to stay for a short time . . . But
people were being beaten and ar
rested and terrorized and nobody
seemed to know or care . . .
"So I stayed."
Stone Wall
Lowenstein realized at once that
traditional procedures had run up
against a stone wall in Mississippi.
"What we had to do," he explain
ed; "was to figure out new tactics
. . . It seemed then that you
couldn't appeal to Washington, be
cause 1 nobody knew or cared . . .
We had to shake people on the
outside out of thinking that Mis
sissippi was just another state . .
Then, when all seemed hope
less, Lowenstein came up with the
idea for a Mock Vote drive
(eventually, "The Aaron Henry
for Governor Campaign") an
idea that proved to be the progen
itor of both the Mississippi Sum
mer Project and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
This is what Norman Thomas
and others mean when they say
that Lowenstein has as good a
claim as any to he called the
founder of the MFDP.
Lowenstein first thought that
perhaps Mississippi N eg rocs
should hold a "day of mourning"
as disenfranchi/ed South African

blacks had done at the time of the
Sharpesville Massacre.
"But then I thought," Lowen
stein recalled, "that it shouldn't
be a 'day of mourning'; it must be
a day of voting."
Protest Vote
The idea at first a "protest
vote"- was tried in Greenwood in
the state democratic primary
that summer, "but it didn't make
any headway."
Then, Bob Moses translated the
"protest vote" concept into a
"Mock Election" and shifted the
context from the primary election
to the general state election. Thus,
the "Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign," with Lowenstein as
chairman of the Campaign Advis
ory Committee, began 10 take
shape.
In retrospect, it seems clear
that the "Aaron Henry Compaign
was the turning point of the Mis
sissippi Movement the one tactic
that, after long years of failure,
finally showed the way to suc
cess.
The "Mock Vote' was aimed at
demonstrating both the desire of
the Mississippi Negro to vote and
the political inequities of the
state system which prevent him
from fulfilling that desire. It
succeeded, not only in that aim,
but in involving large numbers
of college students (particularly
students from Yale and Stan
ford) for the first time in the
harsh realities of Mississippi life.
This initial involvement paved the
way for the Mississippi Summer
Project and much of the rapid
progess that Mississippi lias wit
nessed to date.
The "Mock Election." conduct
ed concurrently with the official
state election, ran Aaron Henry,
a Negro pharmacist from Ciarks
dale, Mississippi, for governor and
the Reverend Edward King, Tuga
loo Chaplain, for Lieutenant gov
ernor.
The Mock Vote workers regis
tered Mississippi Negroes on their
own forms and conducted a free
dom election based on that regis
tration which drew over 100,000
local participants despite gross
intimidation from the white com
munity.
As election day neared and the
mock vote approached real suc
cess, harrassment of the voter reg
istration workers became so se-
as to effectively stall the
project.
At one of the lowest points in
the campaign, after his release
from jail, Lowenstein contacted
several students at Stanford and
told them how bad the situation
had become.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney,
immediately left for Mississippi to
help. Another cadre on the Stan
ford campus itself began to con
duct an informal fund-raising
drive.
Drive Know-Balled
As word of the Mock Vote
spread through the community,
the drive snow-balled. The peak
of interest was reached just be
fore the election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day for five
straight days to the state, turning
the tide for the Mock Vote —and,
in another sense, for Stanford it
self.
The Aaron Henry Campaign set
the stage for the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party (which
would challenge the seating of the
white Mississippi delegation at
the democratic convention in the
summer) and the Mississippi Sum
mer Project, which would bring
nearly 1,000 college students,
and clergymen to
work in the state.
The progress in Mississippi

hrough the Aaron Henry period
had been accomplished by work
ing coalitions of groups and view
points. But as the prospect of a
massive summer project loomed
large on the horizon, there were
signs that this coalition had be
gun to crack.
"The SNCC people were al
ready showing resentment," Low
enstein explained. "They acted as
if they should have a monopoly
on decision-making . . . we dis
agreed with some of the decisions,
but we accepted them."
Convention Challenge
By the end of the summer, how
ever, after the Atlantic City Con
vention challenge, the cracks in
the coalition had developed into
an irreparable schism—largely at
SNCC's own insistence.
SNCC had come to regard the
Atlantic City Convention as a
time of great dissilutionment —
proof, in the words of Denis
Sweeney, that democratic "politics
isn't all it's cracked up to be."
Far From Betrayal
Lowenstein (Adviser to the
MFDP delegation), on the other
hand, takes a very different
view. "Far from being a 'betrayal'
or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was
one of the greatest proofs of the
vitality of American democracy—
when the President of the United
States, at the height of his
power, was forced—forced by the
aroused conscience of the nation—
to move, to compromise."

After the convention, Lowen
stein, who, in fact, had spoken
agaist accepting the compromise
on MFDP seating (not because he
was against compromise, but be
cause he thought they could get
a better one), and other so-called
"middle-class liberals," were cas
tigated by SNCC as "traitors"
and "sellouts." The name-calling
continued through the period of
the MFDP Congressional chal
lenge (for which Lowenstein,
nevertheless, worked) and, in
fact, has deepened rather than
abated with time as the SNCC ide
ology has hardened. (Paradox
ically, Lowenstein has been al
most simultaneously attacked by
both the far left and the far
right—by the one for being "a
red-baiter" and by the other for
being "dangerously radical."
Vicious Circle
"The abuse of the far left and
far right came through in a really
vicious circle," he commented.
"The issue now is," Lowenstein
said, "do you use Mississippi as a
hook on which to hang a na
tional revolution, or do you try to
bring Mississippi first into keep
ing with the national norm."
"What we're trying to do is to
get the Mississippi Negroes the
opportunity to decide their own
future as free men."
The People
So, ostensibly, is SNCC. Indeed,
no group has talked more about
"letting the people make the ic
portant decisions."
"But look what they mean by

"the people,' " an observer com
mented. "First, it's not all of the
people, but only the Negro people.
But it's not all of the Negro peo
ple either. It's the "proletarian"
Negro people. And it's not even
all the "proletarian" Negro peo
ple. It's just those who haven't
been "hopelessly brainwashed" by
middle class values."
Negro Proli lariat
"It's a great mistake to seek to
enlarge class consciousness in the
United States. We're Interested in
everybody getting freedom,"
added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC
movement has lon gsince abandon
ed the concept of a Civil Rights
movement per se and has (in
theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple
with the internal "hang-up" that
are the true blocks to human
freedom.
Moreover, SNCC, in its pursuit
of true revolution, seems to have
rejected traditional political
means of refrom (including the
structure of the democratic par
ty) in disgust as one of the more
bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and
"sick" society.
Proper Procedures
Martin Luther King, of course,
has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein
emphasizes, "he abandoned proper
procedures in order to make them
work and to finally return to
them."
SNCC, on the other hand, .shows
no desire to return to proper pro
cedures or channels once they
have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis
sippi in the past year and a half
toward "removing the external
blocks to freedom" has been im
mense, in Lowenstein's view. But
there is a danger now, that lib

orals, in false satisfaction, or ig
norance, will abandon the field
before fundamental change can be
accomplished.

ical purity, but in coalition.
"The concerned middle class

tional—you can be militant for

It

enlarge class consciousness in the
United States. We're Interested in
everybody getting freedom,"
added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC
movement has lon gsince abandon
ed the concept of a Civil Rights
movement per se and has (in
theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple
with the internal "hang-up" that
are the true blocks to human
freedom.
Moreover, SNCC, in its pursuit
of true revolution, seems to have
rejected traditional political
means of refrom (including the
structure of the democratic par
ty) in disgust as one of the more
bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and
"sick" society.
Proper Procedures
Martin Luther King, of course,
has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein
emphasizes, "he abandoned proper
procedures in order to make them
work and to finally return to
them."
SNCC, on the other hand, .shows
no desire to return to proper pro
cedures or channels once they
have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis
sippi in the past year and a half
toward "removing the external
blocks to freedom" has been im
mense, in Lowenstein's view. But
there is a danger now, that lib

orals, in false satisfaction, or ig
norance, will abandon the field
before fundamental change can be
accomplished.
Monolithic View
"SNCC's '100 per cent' approach
is dangerous," Lowenstein said.
"You're either a 'true believer' or
a 'sell-out.'"
The true hope for change, Low
enstein stressed, is not in ideolog
ical purity, but in coalition.
"The concerned middle class
should be engaged," he said. "You
can be militant and still be ra
tional—you can be militant for
democracy as well as for anarchy
It
Ureal Opportunity
"I see a great opportunity now,"
he continued, "for awakened lib
erals (a very proud term) —for a
vaste coalition of conscience . . .
We won't get everything we want
all at once . . . but we're not in a
revolutionary situation . . . There
are pockets of injustice that can,
and must, be wiped out.
"The crux of the matter is this:
unless "you get the conscience
aroused of the people who are con
tent, you can't get the changes
for the people who aren't."
"What we're going to have to
learn now (in the Civil Rights
Movement ILowenstein con
cluded, is to work out our prob
lems with a sense of mutual re
spect . . . "If finding common
ground is betrayal of principles,
then we certainly don't want to
ask them (SNCC) to betray their
principles . . . It's their decision."

A year and a half ago, in Novem
ber of 1963, Bob Moses of SNCC,
addressing the Aaron Henry for
Governor Campaign victory rally,
spoke in praise of Professor Allard
K. Lowenstein and the contribu
tion he had made to the civil rights
struggle in Mississippi.
"He's a man who transcends a
lot of situations," Moses said. "He
was very deeply involved in this
campaign and while he wasn't suf
ficient, he was certainly necessary
to bring it off, and without him it
would never have come off as it
did."
Several months ago. words of
praise were once again raised for
Lowenstein ("who has as much a
claim as anyone to be called the
founder of the Mississippi Free

dom Democratic Party"), but this
time not by Moses or SNCC but by
Norman Thomas speaking in
angry defense of Lowenstein
against SNCC and its supporters
who, in some strange migration of
attitude and logic, have come to
regard, not only Lowenstein, but
the whole spectrum of "Liberals"
as "sellouts" and "traitors."
No ".Sellout"
In fact, there has been no "trea
son," no "sellout." by Lowenstein
or any other of the accused "Es
tablishment Liberals," but, rath
er, merely a perseverance in the
attitudes and aims which had once
been SNCC's own, and are no
more.
Most simply, the split between
SNCC and non-SNCC liberals can
be described in the following
terms: Lowenstein recognizes, and
has always recognized, that the
vote is only one step in a process
of attaining true freedom but
also recognizes that it is a nec
essary step indeed, a precondi
tion to other liberation.
"Obviously, the problem isn't
finished when we get the vote,"
he has said, "If when we get the
vote, we sink back into sloth, then
we've abandoned the field . . . The
vote only makes fundamental so
cial change possible; it does not
guarantee it."
SNCC. on the other hand, while
accepting with full vigor the no
tion that the vote doesn't guaran
tee social change, has apparently
rejected the concomitant belief
that the vote makes social change
possible.
The old slogan "One Man, One
Vote" the slogan under which
"liberals" and SNCC fought for
so long, together has become an
insufficient banner for SNCC's
new and vaguely defined "revo
lution."
Rallying < ry
"Docs voting make a man
free?" SNCC staff member (and
former Stanford student) Dennis
Sweeney asks. "Clearly it doesn't,"
he answers.
SNCC's new ralh ing cry (in the
words of Bob Moses) is this:
"The best way to keep a man a
slave is to give him a vote and
call him free."
Or, in lli»- more punrenl phrase

ology of SNCC's Stokley Char
miehael (speaking at a recent SOC
conference): "I don't believe in
majority vote; I thing majority
rule stinks."
Not too many years ago, how
ever. the idea of true "majority
rule" for Mississippi looked like
Utopia.
•The Whites Had Won'
"When I first got to Mississippi
(in July of 1963)," Lowenstein
remembered, "everything was
finished. The whites had won.
There were a few SNCC kids hold
ing out . . . but the people literally
had no hope l . . . They were so
scared . . . What could you do?"
What Lowenstein did was to
stay in Mississippi.
lie had gone to Mississippi that
year as a lawyer "because the only
white lawyer handling civil rights
cases had just been forced to leave
the state." He planned to stay a
couple of days no more."
"But then, he recalled, "it got
hard to leave ... I was only going
to stay for a short time . . . But
people were being beaten and ar
rested and terrorized and nobody
seemed to know or care . . .
"So I stayed."
Stone Wall
Lowenstein realized at once that
traditional procedures had run up
against a stone wall in Mississippi.
"What we had to do," he explain
ed; "was to figure out new tactics
. . . It seemed then that you
couldn't appeal to Washington, be
cause 1 nobody knew or cared . . .
We had to shake people on the
outside out of thinking that Mis
sissippi was just another state . .
Then, when all seemed hope
less, Lowenstein came up with the
idea for a Mock Vote drive
(eventually, "The Aaron Henry
for Governor Campaign") an
idea that proved to be the progen
itor of both the Mississippi Sum
mer Project and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
This is what Norman Thomas
and others mean when they say
that Lowenstein has as good a
claim as any to he called the
founder of the MFDP.
Lowenstein first thought that
perhaps Mississippi N eg rocs
should hold a "day of mourning"
as disenfranchi/ed South African

blacks had done at the time of the
Sharpesville Massacre.
"But then I thought," Lowen
stein recalled, "that it shouldn't
be a 'day of mourning'; it must be
a day of voting."
Protest Vote
The idea at first a "protest
vote"- was tried in Greenwood in
the state democratic primary
that summer, "but it didn't make
any headway."
Then, Bob Moses translated the
"protest vote" concept into a
"Mock Election" and shifted the
context from the primary election
to the general state election. Thus,
the "Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign," with Lowenstein as
chairman of the Campaign Advis
ory Committee, began 10 take
shape.
In retrospect, it seems clear
that the "Aaron Henry Compaign
was the turning point of the Mis
sissippi Movement the one tactic
that, after long years of failure,
finally showed the way to suc
cess.
The "Mock Vote' was aimed at
demonstrating both the desire of
the Mississippi Negro to vote and
the political inequities of the
state system which prevent him
from fulfilling that desire. It
succeeded, not only in that aim,
but in involving large numbers
of college students (particularly
students from Yale and Stan
ford) for the first time in the
harsh realities of Mississippi life.
This initial involvement paved the
way for the Mississippi Summer
Project and much of the rapid
progess that Mississippi lias wit
nessed to date.
The "Mock Election." conduct
ed concurrently with the official
state election, ran Aaron Henry,
a Negro pharmacist from Ciarks
dale, Mississippi, for governor and
the Reverend Edward King, Tuga
loo Chaplain, for Lieutenant gov
ernor.
The Mock Vote workers regis
tered Mississippi Negroes on their
own forms and conducted a free
dom election based on that regis
tration which drew over 100,000
local participants despite gross
intimidation from the white com
munity.
As election day neared and the
mock vote approached real suc
cess, harrassment of the voter reg
istration workers became so se-
as to effectively stall the
project.
At one of the lowest points in
the campaign, after his release
from jail, Lowenstein contacted
several students at Stanford and
told them how bad the situation
had become.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney,
immediately left for Mississippi to
help. Another cadre on the Stan
ford campus itself began to con
duct an informal fund-raising
drive.
Drive Know-Balled
As word of the Mock Vote
spread through the community,
the drive snow-balled. The peak
of interest was reached just be
fore the election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day for five
straight days to the state, turning
the tide for the Mock Vote —and,
in another sense, for Stanford it
self.
The Aaron Henry Campaign set
the stage for the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party (which
would challenge the seating of the
white Mississippi delegation at
the democratic convention in the
summer) and the Mississippi Sum
mer Project, which would bring
nearly 1,000 college students,
and clergymen to
work in the state.
The progress in Mississippi

hrough the Aaron Henry period
had been accomplished by work
ing coalitions of groups and view
points. But as the prospect of a
massive summer project loomed
large on the horizon, there were
signs that this coalition had be
gun to crack.
"The SNCC people were al
ready showing resentment," Low
enstein explained. "They acted as
if they should have a monopoly
on decision-making . . . we dis
agreed with some of the decisions,
but we accepted them."
Convention Challenge
By the end of the summer, how
ever, after the Atlantic City Con
vention challenge, the cracks in
the coalition had developed into
an irreparable schism—largely at
SNCC's own insistence.
SNCC had come to regard the
Atlantic City Convention as a
time of great dissilutionment —
proof, in the words of Denis
Sweeney, that democratic "politics
isn't all it's cracked up to be."
Far From Betrayal
Lowenstein (Adviser to the
MFDP delegation), on the other
hand, takes a very different
view. "Far from being a 'betrayal'
or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was
one of the greatest proofs of the
vitality of American democracy—
when the President of the United
States, at the height of his
power, was forced—forced by the
aroused conscience of the nation—
to move, to compromise."

After the convention, Lowen
stein, who, in fact, had spoken
agaist accepting the compromise
on MFDP seating (not because he
was against compromise, but be
cause he thought they could get
a better one), and other so-called
"middle-class liberals," were cas
tigated by SNCC as "traitors"
and "sellouts." The name-calling
continued through the period of
the MFDP Congressional chal
lenge (for which Lowenstein,
nevertheless, worked) and, in
fact, has deepened rather than
abated with time as the SNCC ide
ology has hardened. (Paradox
ically, Lowenstein has been al
most simultaneously attacked by
both the far left and the far
right—by the one for being "a
red-baiter" and by the other for
being "dangerously radical."
Vicious Circle
"The abuse of the far left and
far right came through in a really
vicious circle," he commented.
"The issue now is," Lowenstein
said, "do you use Mississippi as a
hook on which to hang a na
tional revolution, or do you try to
bring Mississippi first into keep
ing with the national norm."
"What we're trying to do is to
get the Mississippi Negroes the
opportunity to decide their own
future as free men."
The People
So, ostensibly, is SNCC. Indeed,
no group has talked more about
"letting the people make the ic
portant decisions."
"But look what they mean by

"the people,' " an observer com
mented. "First, it's not all of the
people, but only the Negro people.
But it's not all of the Negro peo
ple either. It's the "proletarian"
Negro people. And it's not even
all the "proletarian" Negro peo
ple. It's just those who haven't
been "hopelessly brainwashed" by
middle class values."
Negro Proli lariat
"It's a great mistake to seek to
enlarge class consciousness in the
United States. We're Interested in
everybody getting freedom,"
added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC
movement has lon gsince abandon
ed the concept of a Civil Rights
movement per se and has (in
theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple
with the internal "hang-up" that
are the true blocks to human
freedom.

of true revolution, seems to have
rejected traditional political
means of refrom (including the
structure of the democratic par

bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and

has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein

procedures in order to make them

"The abuse of the far left and
far right came through in a really
vicious circle," he commented.
"The issue now is," Lowenstein
said, "do you use Mississippi as a
hook on which to hang a na
tional revolution, or do you try to
bring Mississippi first into keep
ing with the national norm."
"What we're trying to do is to
get the Mississippi Negroes the
opportunity to decide their own
future as free men."
The People
So, ostensibly, is SNCC. Indeed,
no group has talked more about
"letting the people make the ic
portant decisions."
"But look what they mean by

"the people,' " an observer com
mented. "First, it's not all of the
people, but only the Negro people.
But it's not all of the Negro peo
ple either. It's the "proletarian"
Negro people. And it's not even
all the "proletarian" Negro peo
ple. It's just those who haven't
been "hopelessly brainwashed" by
middle class values."
Negro Proli lariat
"It's a great mistake to seek to
enlarge class consciousness in the
United States. We're Interested in
everybody getting freedom,"
added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC
movement has lon gsince abandon
ed the concept of a Civil Rights
movement per se and has (in
theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple
with the internal "hang-up" that
are the true blocks to human
freedom.
Moreover, SNCC, in its pursuit
of true revolution, seems to have
rejected traditional political
means of refrom (including the
structure of the democratic par
ty) in disgust as one of the more
bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and
"sick" society.
Proper Procedures
Martin Luther King, of course,
has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein
emphasizes, "he abandoned proper
procedures in order to make them
work and to finally return to
them."
SNCC, on the other hand, .shows
no desire to return to proper pro
cedures or channels once they
have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis
sippi in the past year and a half
toward "removing the external
blocks to freedom" has been im
mense, in Lowenstein's view. But
there is a danger now, that lib

orals, in false satisfaction, or ig
norance, will abandon the field
before fundamental change can be
accomplished.
Monolithic View
"SNCC's '100 per cent' approach
is dangerous," Lowenstein said.
"You're either a 'true believer' or
a 'sell-out.'"
The true hope for change, Low
enstein stressed, is not in ideolog
ical purity, but in coalition.
"The concerned middle class
should be engaged," he said. "You
can be militant and still be ra
tional—you can be militant for
democracy as well as for anarchy
It
Ureal Opportunity
"I see a great opportunity now,"
he continued, "for awakened lib
erals (a very proud term) —for a
vaste coalition of conscience . . .
We won't get everything we want
all at once . . . but we're not in a
revolutionary situation . . . There
are pockets of injustice that can,
and must, be wiped out.
"The crux of the matter is this:
unless "you get the conscience
aroused of the people who are con
tent, you can't get the changes
for the people who aren't."
"What we're going to have to
learn now (in the Civil Rights
Movement ILowenstein con
cluded, is to work out our prob
lems with a sense of mutual re
spect . . . "If finding common
ground is betrayal of principles,
then we certainly don't want to
ask them (SNCC) to betray their
principles . . . It's their decision."

A year and a half ago, in Novem
ber of 1963, Bob Moses of SNCC,
addressing the Aaron Henry for
Governor Campaign victory rally,
spoke in praise of Professor Allard
K. Lowenstein and the contribu
tion he had made to the civil rights
struggle in Mississippi.
"He's a man who transcends a
lot of situations," Moses said. "He
was very deeply involved in this
campaign and while he wasn't suf
ficient, he was certainly necessary
to bring it off, and without him it
would never have come off as it
did."
Several months ago. words of
praise were once again raised for
Lowenstein ("who has as much a
claim as anyone to be called the
founder of the Mississippi Free

dom Democratic Party"), but this
time not by Moses or SNCC but by
Norman Thomas speaking in
angry defense of Lowenstein
against SNCC and its supporters
who, in some strange migration of
attitude and logic, have come to
regard, not only Lowenstein, but
the whole spectrum of "Liberals"
as "sellouts" and "traitors."
No ".Sellout"
In fact, there has been no "trea
son," no "sellout." by Lowenstein
or any other of the accused "Es
tablishment Liberals," but, rath
er, merely a perseverance in the
attitudes and aims which had once
been SNCC's own, and are no
more.
Most simply, the split between
SNCC and non-SNCC liberals can
be described in the following
terms: Lowenstein recognizes, and
has always recognized, that the
vote is only one step in a process
of attaining true freedom but
also recognizes that it is a nec
essary step indeed, a precondi
tion to other liberation.
"Obviously, the problem isn't
finished when we get the vote,"
he has said, "If when we get the
vote, we sink back into sloth, then
we've abandoned the field . . . The
vote only makes fundamental so
cial change possible; it does not
guarantee it."
SNCC. on the other hand, while
accepting with full vigor the no
tion that the vote doesn't guaran
tee social change, has apparently
rejected the concomitant belief
that the vote makes social change
possible.
The old slogan "One Man, One
Vote" the slogan under which
"liberals" and SNCC fought for
so long, together has become an
insufficient banner for SNCC's
new and vaguely defined "revo
lution."
Rallying < ry
"Docs voting make a man
free?" SNCC staff member (and
former Stanford student) Dennis
Sweeney asks. "Clearly it doesn't,"
he answers.
SNCC's new ralh ing cry (in the
words of Bob Moses) is this:
"The best way to keep a man a
slave is to give him a vote and
call him free."
Or, in lli»- more punrenl phrase

ology of SNCC's Stokley Char
miehael (speaking at a recent SOC
conference): "I don't believe in
majority vote; I thing majority
rule stinks."
Not too many years ago, how
ever. the idea of true "majority
rule" for Mississippi looked like
Utopia.
•The Whites Had Won'
"When I first got to Mississippi
(in July of 1963)," Lowenstein
remembered, "everything was
finished. The whites had won.
There were a few SNCC kids hold
ing out . . . but the people literally
had no hope l . . . They were so
scared . . . What could you do?"
What Lowenstein did was to
stay in Mississippi.
lie had gone to Mississippi that
year as a lawyer "because the only
white lawyer handling civil rights
cases had just been forced to leave
the state." He planned to stay a
couple of days no more."
"But then, he recalled, "it got
hard to leave ... I was only going
to stay for a short time . . . But
people were being beaten and ar
rested and terrorized and nobody
seemed to know or care . . .
"So I stayed."
Stone Wall
Lowenstein realized at once that
traditional procedures had run up
against a stone wall in Mississippi.
"What we had to do," he explain
ed; "was to figure out new tactics
. . . It seemed then that you
couldn't appeal to Washington, be
cause 1 nobody knew or cared . . .
We had to shake people on the
outside out of thinking that Mis
sissippi was just another state . .
Then, when all seemed hope
less, Lowenstein came up with the
idea for a Mock Vote drive
(eventually, "The Aaron Henry
for Governor Campaign") an
idea that proved to be the progen
itor of both the Mississippi Sum
mer Project and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
This is what Norman Thomas
and others mean when they say
that Lowenstein has as good a
claim as any to he called the
founder of the MFDP.
Lowenstein first thought that
perhaps Mississippi N eg rocs
should hold a "day of mourning"
as disenfranchi/ed South African

blacks had done at the time of the
Sharpesville Massacre.
"But then I thought," Lowen
stein recalled, "that it shouldn't
be a 'day of mourning'; it must be
a day of voting."
Protest Vote
The idea at first a "protest
vote"- was tried in Greenwood in
the state democratic primary
that summer, "but it didn't make
any headway."
Then, Bob Moses translated the
"protest vote" concept into a
"Mock Election" and shifted the
context from the primary election
to the general state election. Thus,
the "Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign," with Lowenstein as
chairman of the Campaign Advis
ory Committee, began 10 take
shape.
In retrospect, it seems clear
that the "Aaron Henry Compaign
was the turning point of the Mis
sissippi Movement the one tactic
that, after long years of failure,
finally showed the way to suc
cess.
The "Mock Vote' was aimed at
demonstrating both the desire of
the Mississippi Negro to vote and
the political inequities of the
state system which prevent him
from fulfilling that desire. It
succeeded, not only in that aim,
but in involving large numbers
of college students (particularly
students from Yale and Stan
ford) for the first time in the
harsh realities of Mississippi life.
This initial involvement paved the
way for the Mississippi Summer
Project and much of the rapid
progess that Mississippi lias wit
nessed to date.
The "Mock Election." conduct
ed concurrently with the official
state election, ran Aaron Henry,
a Negro pharmacist from Ciarks
dale, Mississippi, for governor and
the Reverend Edward King, Tuga
loo Chaplain, for Lieutenant gov
ernor.
The Mock Vote workers regis
tered Mississippi Negroes on their
own forms and conducted a free
dom election based on that regis
tration which drew over 100,000
local participants despite gross
intimidation from the white com
munity.

istration workers became so se-
as to effectively stall the
project.
At one of the lowest points in
the campaign, after his release
from jail, Lowenstein contacted
several students at Stanford and
told them how bad the situation
had become.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney,
immediately left for Mississippi to
help. Another cadre on the Stan
ford campus itself began to con
duct an informal fund-raising
drive.
Drive Know-Balled
As word of the Mock Vote
spread through the community,
the drive snow-balled. The peak
of interest was reached just be
fore the election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day for five
straight days to the state, turning
the tide for the Mock Vote —and,
in another sense, for Stanford it
self.
The Aaron Henry Campaign set
the stage for the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party (which
would challenge the seating of the
white Mississippi delegation at
the democratic convention in the
summer) and the Mississippi Sum
mer Project, which would bring
nearly 1,000 college students,
and clergymen to
work in the state.
The progress in Mississippi

hrough the Aaron Henry period
had been accomplished by work
ing coalitions of groups and view
points. But as the prospect of a
massive summer project loomed
large on the horizon, there were
signs that this coalition had be
gun to crack.
"The SNCC people were al
ready showing resentment," Low
enstein explained. "They acted as
if they should have a monopoly
on decision-making . . . we dis
agreed with some of the decisions,
but we accepted them."
Convention Challenge
By the end of the summer, how
ever, after the Atlantic City Con
vention challenge, the cracks in
the coalition had developed into
an irreparable schism—largely at
SNCC's own insistence.
SNCC had come to regard the
Atlantic City Convention as a
time of great dissilutionment —
proof, in the words of Denis
Sweeney, that democratic "politics
isn't all it's cracked up to be."
Far From Betrayal
Lowenstein (Adviser to the
MFDP delegation), on the other
hand, takes a very different
view. "Far from being a 'betrayal'
or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was
one of the greatest proofs of the
vitality of American democracy—
when the President of the United
States, at the height of his
power, was forced—forced by the
aroused conscience of the nation—
to move, to compromise."

After the convention, Lowen
stein, who, in fact, had spoken
agaist accepting the compromise
on MFDP seating (not because he
was against compromise, but be
cause he thought they could get
a better one), and other so-called
"middle-class liberals," were cas
tigated by SNCC as "traitors"
and "sellouts." The name-calling
continued through the period of
the MFDP Congressional chal
lenge (for which Lowenstein,
nevertheless, worked) and, in
fact, has deepened rather than
abated with time as the SNCC ide
ology has hardened. (Paradox
ically, Lowenstein has been al
most simultaneously attacked by
both the far left and the far
right—by the one for being "a
red-baiter" and by the other for
being "dangerously radical."
Vicious Circle
"The abuse of the far left and
far right came through in a really
vicious circle," he commented.
"The issue now is," Lowenstein
said, "do you use Mississippi as a
hook on which to hang a na
tional revolution, or do you try to
bring Mississippi first into keep
ing with the national norm."
"What we're trying to do is to
get the Mississippi Negroes the
opportunity to decide their own
future as free men."

no group has talked more about
"letting the people make the ic

"But look what they mean by

been "hopelessly brainwashed" by

"It's a great mistake to seek to

United States. We're Interested in

added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC

theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple

of true revolution, seems to have

means of refrom (including the

bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and

Proper Procedures
Martin Luther King, of course,
has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein
emphasizes, "he abandoned proper
procedures in order to make them
work and to finally return to
them."
SNCC, on the other hand, .shows
no desire to return to proper pro
cedures or channels once they
have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis

or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was
one of the greatest proofs of the
vitality of American democracy—
when the President of the United
States, at the height of his
power, was forced—forced by the
aroused conscience of the nation—
to move, to compromise."

After the convention, Lowen
stein, who, in fact, had spoken
agaist accepting the compromise
on MFDP seating (not because he
was against compromise, but be
cause he thought they could get
a better one), and other so-called
"middle-class liberals," were cas
tigated by SNCC as "traitors"
and "sellouts." The name-calling
continued through the period of
the MFDP Congressional chal
lenge (for which Lowenstein,
nevertheless, worked) and, in
fact, has deepened rather than
abated with time as the SNCC ide
ology has hardened. (Paradox
ically, Lowenstein has been al
most simultaneously attacked by
both the far left and the far
right—by the one for being "a
red-baiter" and by the other for
being "dangerously radical."
Vicious Circle
"The abuse of the far left and
far right came through in a really
vicious circle," he commented.
"The issue now is," Lowenstein
said, "do you use Mississippi as a
hook on which to hang a na
tional revolution, or do you try to
bring Mississippi first into keep
ing with the national norm."
"What we're trying to do is to
get the Mississippi Negroes the
opportunity to decide their own
future as free men."
The People
So, ostensibly, is SNCC. Indeed,
no group has talked more about
"letting the people make the ic
portant decisions."
"But look what they mean by

"the people,' " an observer com
mented. "First, it's not all of the
people, but only the Negro people.
But it's not all of the Negro peo
ple either. It's the "proletarian"
Negro people. And it's not even
all the "proletarian" Negro peo
ple. It's just those who haven't
been "hopelessly brainwashed" by
middle class values."
Negro Proli lariat
"It's a great mistake to seek to
enlarge class consciousness in the
United States. We're Interested in
everybody getting freedom,"
added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC
movement has lon gsince abandon
ed the concept of a Civil Rights
movement per se and has (in
theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple
with the internal "hang-up" that
are the true blocks to human
freedom.
Moreover, SNCC, in its pursuit
of true revolution, seems to have
rejected traditional political
means of refrom (including the
structure of the democratic par
ty) in disgust as one of the more
bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and
"sick" society.
Proper Procedures
Martin Luther King, of course,
has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein
emphasizes, "he abandoned proper
procedures in order to make them
work and to finally return to
them."
SNCC, on the other hand, .shows
no desire to return to proper pro
cedures or channels once they
have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis
sippi in the past year and a half
toward "removing the external
blocks to freedom" has been im
mense, in Lowenstein's view. But
there is a danger now, that lib

orals, in false satisfaction, or ig
norance, will abandon the field
before fundamental change can be
accomplished.
Monolithic View
"SNCC's '100 per cent' approach
is dangerous," Lowenstein said.
"You're either a 'true believer' or
a 'sell-out.'"
The true hope for change, Low
enstein stressed, is not in ideolog
ical purity, but in coalition.
"The concerned middle class
should be engaged," he said. "You
can be militant and still be ra
tional—you can be militant for
democracy as well as for anarchy
It
Ureal Opportunity
"I see a great opportunity now,"
he continued, "for awakened lib
erals (a very proud term) —for a
vaste coalition of conscience . . .
We won't get everything we want
all at once . . . but we're not in a
revolutionary situation . . . There
are pockets of injustice that can,
and must, be wiped out.
"The crux of the matter is this:
unless "you get the conscience
aroused of the people who are con
tent, you can't get the changes
for the people who aren't."
"What we're going to have to
learn now (in the Civil Rights
Movement ILowenstein con
cluded, is to work out our prob
lems with a sense of mutual re
spect . . . "If finding common
ground is betrayal of principles,
then we certainly don't want to
ask them (SNCC) to betray their
principles . . . It's their decision."

A year and a half ago, in Novem
ber of 1963, Bob Moses of SNCC,
addressing the Aaron Henry for
Governor Campaign victory rally,
spoke in praise of Professor Allard
K. Lowenstein and the contribu
tion he had made to the civil rights
struggle in Mississippi.
"He's a man who transcends a
lot of situations," Moses said. "He
was very deeply involved in this
campaign and while he wasn't suf
ficient, he was certainly necessary
to bring it off, and without him it
would never have come off as it
did."
Several months ago. words of
praise were once again raised for
Lowenstein ("who has as much a
claim as anyone to be called the
founder of the Mississippi Free

dom Democratic Party"), but this
time not by Moses or SNCC but by
Norman Thomas speaking in
angry defense of Lowenstein
against SNCC and its supporters
who, in some strange migration of
attitude and logic, have come to
regard, not only Lowenstein, but
the whole spectrum of "Liberals"
as "sellouts" and "traitors."
No ".Sellout"
In fact, there has been no "trea
son," no "sellout." by Lowenstein
or any other of the accused "Es
tablishment Liberals," but, rath
er, merely a perseverance in the
attitudes and aims which had once
been SNCC's own, and are no
more.
Most simply, the split between
SNCC and non-SNCC liberals can
be described in the following
terms: Lowenstein recognizes, and
has always recognized, that the
vote is only one step in a process
of attaining true freedom but
also recognizes that it is a nec
essary step indeed, a precondi
tion to other liberation.
"Obviously, the problem isn't
finished when we get the vote,"
he has said, "If when we get the
vote, we sink back into sloth, then
we've abandoned the field . . . The
vote only makes fundamental so
cial change possible; it does not
guarantee it."
SNCC. on the other hand, while
accepting with full vigor the no
tion that the vote doesn't guaran
tee social change, has apparently
rejected the concomitant belief
that the vote makes social change
possible.
The old slogan "One Man, One
Vote" the slogan under which
"liberals" and SNCC fought for
so long, together has become an
insufficient banner for SNCC's
new and vaguely defined "revo
lution."
Rallying < ry
"Docs voting make a man
free?" SNCC staff member (and
former Stanford student) Dennis
Sweeney asks. "Clearly it doesn't,"
he answers.
SNCC's new ralh ing cry (in the
words of Bob Moses) is this:
"The best way to keep a man a
slave is to give him a vote and
call him free."
Or, in lli»- more punrenl phrase

ology of SNCC's Stokley Char
miehael (speaking at a recent SOC
conference): "I don't believe in
majority vote; I thing majority
rule stinks."
Not too many years ago, how
ever. the idea of true "majority
rule" for Mississippi looked like
Utopia.
•The Whites Had Won'
"When I first got to Mississippi
(in July of 1963)," Lowenstein
remembered, "everything was
finished. The whites had won.
There were a few SNCC kids hold
ing out . . . but the people literally
had no hope l . . . They were so
scared . . . What could you do?"
What Lowenstein did was to
stay in Mississippi.
lie had gone to Mississippi that
year as a lawyer "because the only
white lawyer handling civil rights
cases had just been forced to leave
the state." He planned to stay a
couple of days no more."
"But then, he recalled, "it got
hard to leave ... I was only going
to stay for a short time . . . But
people were being beaten and ar
rested and terrorized and nobody
seemed to know or care . . .
"So I stayed."
Stone Wall
Lowenstein realized at once that
traditional procedures had run up
against a stone wall in Mississippi.
"What we had to do," he explain
ed; "was to figure out new tactics
. . . It seemed then that you
couldn't appeal to Washington, be
cause 1 nobody knew or cared . . .
We had to shake people on the
outside out of thinking that Mis
sissippi was just another state . .
Then, when all seemed hope
less, Lowenstein came up with the
idea for a Mock Vote drive
(eventually, "The Aaron Henry
for Governor Campaign") an
idea that proved to be the progen
itor of both the Mississippi Sum
mer Project and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
This is what Norman Thomas
and others mean when they say
that Lowenstein has as good a
claim as any to he called the
founder of the MFDP.
Lowenstein first thought that
perhaps Mississippi N eg rocs
should hold a "day of mourning"
as disenfranchi/ed South African

blacks had done at the time of the
Sharpesville Massacre.
"But then I thought," Lowen
stein recalled, "that it shouldn't
be a 'day of mourning'; it must be
a day of voting."
Protest Vote
The idea at first a "protest
vote"- was tried in Greenwood in
the state democratic primary
that summer, "but it didn't make
any headway."
Then, Bob Moses translated the
"protest vote" concept into a
"Mock Election" and shifted the
context from the primary election
to the general state election. Thus,
the "Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign," with Lowenstein as
chairman of the Campaign Advis
ory Committee, began 10 take
shape.
In retrospect, it seems clear
that the "Aaron Henry Compaign
was the turning point of the Mis
sissippi Movement the one tactic
that, after long years of failure,
finally showed the way to suc
cess.
The "Mock Vote' was aimed at
demonstrating both the desire of
the Mississippi Negro to vote and
the political inequities of the
state system which prevent him
from fulfilling that desire. It
succeeded, not only in that aim,
but in involving large numbers
of college students (particularly
students from Yale and Stan
ford) for the first time in the
harsh realities of Mississippi life.
This initial involvement paved the
way for the Mississippi Summer
Project and much of the rapid
progess that Mississippi lias wit
nessed to date.
The "Mock Election." conduct
ed concurrently with the official
state election, ran Aaron Henry,
a Negro pharmacist from Ciarks
dale, Mississippi, for governor and
the Reverend Edward King, Tuga
loo Chaplain, for Lieutenant gov
ernor.
The Mock Vote workers regis
tered Mississippi Negroes on their
own forms and conducted a free
dom election based on that regis
tration which drew over 100,000
local participants despite gross
intimidation from the white com
munity.
As election day neared and the
mock vote approached real suc
cess, harrassment of the voter reg
istration workers became so se-
as to effectively stall the
project.
At one of the lowest points in
the campaign, after his release
from jail, Lowenstein contacted
several students at Stanford and
told them how bad the situation
had become.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney,
immediately left for Mississippi to
help. Another cadre on the Stan
ford campus itself began to con
duct an informal fund-raising
drive.
Drive Know-Balled
As word of the Mock Vote
spread through the community,
the drive snow-balled. The peak
of interest was reached just be
fore the election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day for five
straight days to the state, turning
the tide for the Mock Vote —and,
in another sense, for Stanford it
self.
The Aaron Henry Campaign set
the stage for the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party (which
would challenge the seating of the
white Mississippi delegation at
the democratic convention in the
summer) and the Mississippi Sum
mer Project, which would bring
nearly 1,000 college students,
and clergymen to
work in the state.
The progress in Mississippi

hrough the Aaron Henry period
had been accomplished by work
ing coalitions of groups and view
points. But as the prospect of a
massive summer project loomed
large on the horizon, there were
signs that this coalition had be
gun to crack.
"The SNCC people were al
ready showing resentment," Low
enstein explained. "They acted as
if they should have a monopoly
on decision-making . . . we dis
agreed with some of the decisions,
but we accepted them."
Convention Challenge
By the end of the summer, how
ever, after the Atlantic City Con
vention challenge, the cracks in
the coalition had developed into
an irreparable schism—largely at
SNCC's own insistence.
SNCC had come to regard the
Atlantic City Convention as a
time of great dissilutionment —
proof, in the words of Denis
Sweeney, that democratic "politics
isn't all it's cracked up to be."
Far From Betrayal
Lowenstein (Adviser to the
MFDP delegation), on the other
hand, takes a very different
view. "Far from being a 'betrayal'
or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was
one of the greatest proofs of the
vitality of American democracy—
when the President of the United
States, at the height of his
power, was forced—forced by the
aroused conscience of the nation—
to move, to compromise."

After the convention, Lowen
stein, who, in fact, had spoken

"middle-class liberals," were cas

and "sellouts." The name-calling

the MFDP Congressional chal

nevertheless, worked) and, in
fact, has deepened rather than
abated with time as the SNCC ide

most simultaneously attacked by

The progress in Mississippi

hrough the Aaron Henry period
had been accomplished by work
ing coalitions of groups and view
points. But as the prospect of a
massive summer project loomed
large on the horizon, there were
signs that this coalition had be
gun to crack.
"The SNCC people were al
ready showing resentment," Low
enstein explained. "They acted as
if they should have a monopoly
on decision-making . . . we dis
agreed with some of the decisions,
but we accepted them."
Convention Challenge
By the end of the summer, how
ever, after the Atlantic City Con
vention challenge, the cracks in
the coalition had developed into
an irreparable schism—largely at
SNCC's own insistence.
SNCC had come to regard the
Atlantic City Convention as a
time of great dissilutionment —
proof, in the words of Denis
Sweeney, that democratic "politics
isn't all it's cracked up to be."
Far From Betrayal
Lowenstein (Adviser to the
MFDP delegation), on the other
hand, takes a very different
view. "Far from being a 'betrayal'
or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was
one of the greatest proofs of the
vitality of American democracy—
when the President of the United
States, at the height of his
power, was forced—forced by the
aroused conscience of the nation—
to move, to compromise."

After the convention, Lowen
stein, who, in fact, had spoken
agaist accepting the compromise
on MFDP seating (not because he
was against compromise, but be
cause he thought they could get
a better one), and other so-called
"middle-class liberals," were cas
tigated by SNCC as "traitors"
and "sellouts." The name-calling
continued through the period of
the MFDP Congressional chal
lenge (for which Lowenstein,
nevertheless, worked) and, in
fact, has deepened rather than
abated with time as the SNCC ide
ology has hardened. (Paradox
ically, Lowenstein has been al
most simultaneously attacked by
both the far left and the far
right—by the one for being "a
red-baiter" and by the other for
being "dangerously radical."
Vicious Circle
"The abuse of the far left and
far right came through in a really
vicious circle," he commented.
"The issue now is," Lowenstein
said, "do you use Mississippi as a
hook on which to hang a na
tional revolution, or do you try to
bring Mississippi first into keep
ing with the national norm."
"What we're trying to do is to
get the Mississippi Negroes the
opportunity to decide their own
future as free men."
The People
So, ostensibly, is SNCC. Indeed,
no group has talked more about
"letting the people make the ic
portant decisions."
"But look what they mean by

"the people,' " an observer com
mented. "First, it's not all of the
people, but only the Negro people.
But it's not all of the Negro peo
ple either. It's the "proletarian"
Negro people. And it's not even
all the "proletarian" Negro peo
ple. It's just those who haven't
been "hopelessly brainwashed" by
middle class values."
Negro Proli lariat
"It's a great mistake to seek to
enlarge class consciousness in the
United States. We're Interested in
everybody getting freedom,"
added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC
movement has lon gsince abandon
ed the concept of a Civil Rights
movement per se and has (in
theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple
with the internal "hang-up" that
are the true blocks to human
freedom.
Moreover, SNCC, in its pursuit
of true revolution, seems to have
rejected traditional political
means of refrom (including the
structure of the democratic par
ty) in disgust as one of the more
bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and
"sick" society.
Proper Procedures
Martin Luther King, of course,
has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein
emphasizes, "he abandoned proper
procedures in order to make them
work and to finally return to
them."
SNCC, on the other hand, .shows
no desire to return to proper pro
cedures or channels once they
have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis
sippi in the past year and a half
toward "removing the external
blocks to freedom" has been im
mense, in Lowenstein's view. But
there is a danger now, that lib

orals, in false satisfaction, or ig
norance, will abandon the field
before fundamental change can be
accomplished.
Monolithic View
"SNCC's '100 per cent' approach
is dangerous," Lowenstein said.
"You're either a 'true believer' or
a 'sell-out.'"
The true hope for change, Low
enstein stressed, is not in ideolog
ical purity, but in coalition.
"The concerned middle class
should be engaged," he said. "You
can be militant and still be ra
tional—you can be militant for
democracy as well as for anarchy
It
Ureal Opportunity
"I see a great opportunity now,"
he continued, "for awakened lib
erals (a very proud term) —for a
vaste coalition of conscience . . .
We won't get everything we want
all at once . . . but we're not in a
revolutionary situation . . . There
are pockets of injustice that can,
and must, be wiped out.
"The crux of the matter is this:
unless "you get the conscience
aroused of the people who are con
tent, you can't get the changes
for the people who aren't."
"What we're going to have to
learn now (in the Civil Rights
Movement ILowenstein con
cluded, is to work out our prob
lems with a sense of mutual re
spect . . . "If finding common
ground is betrayal of principles,
then we certainly don't want to
ask them (SNCC) to betray their
principles . . . It's their decision."

A year and a half ago, in Novem
ber of 1963, Bob Moses of SNCC,
addressing the Aaron Henry for
Governor Campaign victory rally,
spoke in praise of Professor Allard
K. Lowenstein and the contribu
tion he had made to the civil rights
struggle in Mississippi.
"He's a man who transcends a
lot of situations," Moses said. "He
was very deeply involved in this
campaign and while he wasn't suf
ficient, he was certainly necessary
to bring it off, and without him it
would never have come off as it
did."
Several months ago. words of
praise were once again raised for
Lowenstein ("who has as much a
claim as anyone to be called the
founder of the Mississippi Free

dom Democratic Party"), but this
time not by Moses or SNCC but by
Norman Thomas speaking in
angry defense of Lowenstein
against SNCC and its supporters
who, in some strange migration of
attitude and logic, have come to
regard, not only Lowenstein, but
the whole spectrum of "Liberals"
as "sellouts" and "traitors."
No ".Sellout"
In fact, there has been no "trea
son," no "sellout." by Lowenstein
or any other of the accused "Es
tablishment Liberals," but, rath
er, merely a perseverance in the
attitudes and aims which had once
been SNCC's own, and are no
more.
Most simply, the split between
SNCC and non-SNCC liberals can
be described in the following
terms: Lowenstein recognizes, and
has always recognized, that the
vote is only one step in a process
of attaining true freedom but
also recognizes that it is a nec
essary step indeed, a precondi
tion to other liberation.
"Obviously, the problem isn't
finished when we get the vote,"
he has said, "If when we get the
vote, we sink back into sloth, then
we've abandoned the field . . . The
vote only makes fundamental so
cial change possible; it does not
guarantee it."
SNCC. on the other hand, while
accepting with full vigor the no
tion that the vote doesn't guaran
tee social change, has apparently
rejected the concomitant belief
that the vote makes social change
possible.
The old slogan "One Man, One
Vote" the slogan under which
"liberals" and SNCC fought for
so long, together has become an
insufficient banner for SNCC's
new and vaguely defined "revo
lution."
Rallying < ry
"Docs voting make a man
free?" SNCC staff member (and
former Stanford student) Dennis
Sweeney asks. "Clearly it doesn't,"
he answers.
SNCC's new ralh ing cry (in the
words of Bob Moses) is this:
"The best way to keep a man a
slave is to give him a vote and
call him free."
Or, in lli»- more punrenl phrase

ology of SNCC's Stokley Char
miehael (speaking at a recent SOC
conference): "I don't believe in
majority vote; I thing majority
rule stinks."
Not too many years ago, how
ever. the idea of true "majority
rule" for Mississippi looked like
Utopia.
•The Whites Had Won'
"When I first got to Mississippi
(in July of 1963)," Lowenstein
remembered, "everything was
finished. The whites had won.
There were a few SNCC kids hold
ing out . . . but the people literally
had no hope l . . . They were so
scared . . . What could you do?"
What Lowenstein did was to
stay in Mississippi.
lie had gone to Mississippi that
year as a lawyer "because the only
white lawyer handling civil rights
cases had just been forced to leave
the state." He planned to stay a
couple of days no more."
"But then, he recalled, "it got
hard to leave ... I was only going
to stay for a short time . . . But
people were being beaten and ar
rested and terrorized and nobody
seemed to know or care . . .
"So I stayed."
Stone Wall
Lowenstein realized at once that
traditional procedures had run up
against a stone wall in Mississippi.
"What we had to do," he explain
ed; "was to figure out new tactics
. . . It seemed then that you
couldn't appeal to Washington, be
cause 1 nobody knew or cared . . .
We had to shake people on the
outside out of thinking that Mis
sissippi was just another state . .
Then, when all seemed hope
less, Lowenstein came up with the
idea for a Mock Vote drive
(eventually, "The Aaron Henry
for Governor Campaign") an
idea that proved to be the progen
itor of both the Mississippi Sum
mer Project and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
This is what Norman Thomas
and others mean when they say
that Lowenstein has as good a
claim as any to he called the
founder of the MFDP.
Lowenstein first thought that
perhaps Mississippi N eg rocs
should hold a "day of mourning"
as disenfranchi/ed South African

blacks had done at the time of the
Sharpesville Massacre.
"But then I thought," Lowen
stein recalled, "that it shouldn't
be a 'day of mourning'; it must be
a day of voting."
Protest Vote
The idea at first a "protest
vote"- was tried in Greenwood in
the state democratic primary
that summer, "but it didn't make
any headway."
Then, Bob Moses translated the
"protest vote" concept into a
"Mock Election" and shifted the
context from the primary election
to the general state election. Thus,
the "Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign," with Lowenstein as
chairman of the Campaign Advis
ory Committee, began 10 take
shape.
In retrospect, it seems clear
that the "Aaron Henry Compaign
was the turning point of the Mis
sissippi Movement the one tactic
that, after long years of failure,
finally showed the way to suc
cess.
The "Mock Vote' was aimed at
demonstrating both the desire of
the Mississippi Negro to vote and
the political inequities of the
state system which prevent him
from fulfilling that desire. It
succeeded, not only in that aim,
but in involving large numbers
of college students (particularly
students from Yale and Stan
ford) for the first time in the
harsh realities of Mississippi life.
This initial involvement paved the
way for the Mississippi Summer
Project and much of the rapid
progess that Mississippi lias wit
nessed to date.
The "Mock Election." conduct
ed concurrently with the official
state election, ran Aaron Henry,
a Negro pharmacist from Ciarks
dale, Mississippi, for governor and
the Reverend Edward King, Tuga
loo Chaplain, for Lieutenant gov
ernor.
The Mock Vote workers regis
tered Mississippi Negroes on their
own forms and conducted a free
dom election based on that regis
tration which drew over 100,000
local participants despite gross
intimidation from the white com
munity.
As election day neared and the
mock vote approached real suc
cess, harrassment of the voter reg
istration workers became so se-
as to effectively stall the
project.
At one of the lowest points in
the campaign, after his release
from jail, Lowenstein contacted
several students at Stanford and
told them how bad the situation
had become.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney,
immediately left for Mississippi to
help. Another cadre on the Stan
ford campus itself began to con
duct an informal fund-raising
drive.
Drive Know-Balled
As word of the Mock Vote
spread through the community,
the drive snow-balled. The peak
of interest was reached just be
fore the election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day for five
straight days to the state, turning
the tide for the Mock Vote —and,
in another sense, for Stanford it
self.
The Aaron Henry Campaign set
the stage for the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party (which
would challenge the seating of the
white Mississippi delegation at
the democratic convention in the
summer) and the Mississippi Sum
mer Project, which would bring
nearly 1,000 college students,
and clergymen to
work in the state.
The progress in Mississippi

hrough the Aaron Henry period
had been accomplished by work
ing coalitions of groups and view
points. But as the prospect of a
massive summer project loomed
large on the horizon, there were
signs that this coalition had be
gun to crack.
"The SNCC people were al
ready showing resentment," Low
enstein explained. "They acted as
if they should have a monopoly
on decision-making . . . we dis
agreed with some of the decisions,
but we accepted them."
Convention Challenge
By the end of the summer, how
ever, after the Atlantic City Con
vention challenge, the cracks in
the coalition had developed into
an irreparable schism—largely at
SNCC's own insistence.
SNCC had come to regard the
Atlantic City Convention as a
time of great dissilutionment —

or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was

project.
At one of the lowest points in
the campaign, after his release
from jail, Lowenstein contacted
several students at Stanford and
told them how bad the situation
had become.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney,
immediately left for Mississippi to
help. Another cadre on the Stan
ford campus itself began to con
duct an informal fund-raising
drive.
Drive Know-Balled
As word of the Mock Vote
spread through the community,
the drive snow-balled. The peak
of interest was reached just be
fore the election when Stanford
sent over $1,000 a day for five
straight days to the state, turning
the tide for the Mock Vote —and,
in another sense, for Stanford it
self.
The Aaron Henry Campaign set
the stage for the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party (which
would challenge the seating of the
white Mississippi delegation at
the democratic convention in the
summer) and the Mississippi Sum
mer Project, which would bring
nearly 1,000 college students,
and clergymen to
work in the state.
The progress in Mississippi

hrough the Aaron Henry period
had been accomplished by work
ing coalitions of groups and view
points. But as the prospect of a
massive summer project loomed
large on the horizon, there were
signs that this coalition had be
gun to crack.
"The SNCC people were al
ready showing resentment," Low
enstein explained. "They acted as
if they should have a monopoly
on decision-making . . . we dis
agreed with some of the decisions,
but we accepted them."
Convention Challenge
By the end of the summer, how
ever, after the Atlantic City Con
vention challenge, the cracks in
the coalition had developed into
an irreparable schism—largely at
SNCC's own insistence.
SNCC had come to regard the
Atlantic City Convention as a
time of great dissilutionment —
proof, in the words of Denis
Sweeney, that democratic "politics
isn't all it's cracked up to be."
Far From Betrayal
Lowenstein (Adviser to the
MFDP delegation), on the other
hand, takes a very different
view. "Far from being a 'betrayal'
or a 'defeat,' Atlantic City was
one of the greatest proofs of the
vitality of American democracy—
when the President of the United
States, at the height of his
power, was forced—forced by the
aroused conscience of the nation—
to move, to compromise."

After the convention, Lowen
stein, who, in fact, had spoken
agaist accepting the compromise
on MFDP seating (not because he
was against compromise, but be
cause he thought they could get
a better one), and other so-called
"middle-class liberals," were cas
tigated by SNCC as "traitors"
and "sellouts." The name-calling
continued through the period of
the MFDP Congressional chal
lenge (for which Lowenstein,
nevertheless, worked) and, in
fact, has deepened rather than
abated with time as the SNCC ide
ology has hardened. (Paradox
ically, Lowenstein has been al
most simultaneously attacked by
both the far left and the far
right—by the one for being "a
red-baiter" and by the other for
being "dangerously radical."
Vicious Circle
"The abuse of the far left and
far right came through in a really
vicious circle," he commented.
"The issue now is," Lowenstein
said, "do you use Mississippi as a
hook on which to hang a na
tional revolution, or do you try to
bring Mississippi first into keep
ing with the national norm."
"What we're trying to do is to
get the Mississippi Negroes the
opportunity to decide their own
future as free men."
The People
So, ostensibly, is SNCC. Indeed,
no group has talked more about
"letting the people make the ic
portant decisions."
"But look what they mean by

"the people,' " an observer com
mented. "First, it's not all of the
people, but only the Negro people.
But it's not all of the Negro peo
ple either. It's the "proletarian"
Negro people. And it's not even
all the "proletarian" Negro peo
ple. It's just those who haven't
been "hopelessly brainwashed" by
middle class values."
Negro Proli lariat
"It's a great mistake to seek to
enlarge class consciousness in the
United States. We're Interested in
everybody getting freedom,"
added Lowenstein.
In fact, it seems that SNCC
movement has lon gsince abandon
ed the concept of a Civil Rights
movement per se and has (in
theory if not in practice) directed
its energies toward a much more
sweeping social revolution which
will, it is said, at last grapple
with the internal "hang-up" that
are the true blocks to human
freedom.
Moreover, SNCC, in its pursuit
of true revolution, seems to have
rejected traditional political
means of refrom (including the
structure of the democratic par
ty) in disgust as one of the more
bitter hoaxes of a corrupt and
"sick" society.
Proper Procedures
Martin Luther King, of course,
has also abandoned "proper pro
cedures" when they seemed to be
ineffective. 'But," Lowenstein
emphasizes, "he abandoned proper
procedures in order to make them
work and to finally return to
them."
SNCC, on the other hand, .shows
no desire to return to proper pro
cedures or channels once they
have been made to respond. Thus
for example SNCC is reduced to
the seeming absurdity of con
densing President Johnson's
sweeping voting bill as an effort
"to divert attention from the
MFDP Challenge"—when, in fact,
the Challenge mechanism (and its
parent, the Mock Vote) were orig
inally devised in the hope that
they might, some day, provoke
just such broad federal protec
tion as Johnson has now pro
posed.
The progress made in Missis
sippi in the past year and a half
toward "removing the external
blocks to freedom" has been im
mense, in Lowenstein's view. But
there is a danger now, that lib

orals, in false satisfaction, or ig
norance, will abandon the field
before fundamental change can be
accomplished.
Monolithic View
"SNCC's '100 per cent' approach
is dangerous," Lowenstein said.
"You're either a 'true believer' or
a 'sell-out.'"
The true hope for change, Low
enstein stressed, is not in ideolog
ical purity, but in coalition.
"The concerned middle class
should be engaged," he said. "You
can be militant and still be ra
tional—you can be militant for
democracy as well as for anarchy
It
Ureal Opportunity
"I see a great opportunity now,"
he continued, "for awakened lib
erals (a very proud term) —for a
vaste coalition of conscience . . .
We won't get everything we want
all at once . . . but we're not in a
revolutionary situation . . . There
are pockets of injustice that can,
and must, be wiped out.
"The crux of the matter is this:
unless "you get the conscience
aroused of the people who are con
tent, you can't get the changes
for the people who aren't."
"What we're going to have to
learn now (in the Civil Rights
Movement ILowenstein con
cluded, is to work out our prob
lems with a sense of mutual re
spect . . . "If finding common
ground is betrayal of principles,
then we certainly don't want to
ask them (SNCC) to betray their
principles . . . It's their decision."
Editor's note: The following ar
ticle is a discussion of the na
ture and history of the split that
has developed in the civil rights
movement between the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Com
mittee (SNCC) and the so-called
"liberal establishment." It is
based on an interview with Alia id
K. Lowenstein, Assistant Dean of
Men at Stanford from 1961-62.
Lowenstein, as the article in
dicates, has been active, in one
capacity or another, in the civil
rights movement ever since his
undergraduate years at the Uni
versity of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. He is a former presi
dent of NSA. has worked on the
staffs of Hubert Humphrey and
Frank Graham, has written a
book, "Brutal Mandate," based
on his trip to South West Africa
(which lie recounted in testimony
before the United Nations), and
has worked with the non-commu
nist Opposition Forces in Spain.
He is both a lawyer and a teacher
ami has taught in llie Political Sci
ence departments at Stanford and
North Carolina State University
at Raleigh.
This year, he was, for a brief
time, a "Writer-inßesidenee" in
Vale's Stiles College and later
worked with the Ford Foundation
on problems of higher education.
He is now Director of the Encamp
ment for citizenship.

Editor
A year and a half ago, in Novem
ber of 1963, Bob Moses of SNCC,
addressing the Aaron Henry for
Governor Campaign victory rally,
spoke in praise of Professor Allard
K. Lowenstein and the contribu
tion he had made to the civil rights
struggle in Mississippi.
"He's a man who transcends a
lot of situations," Moses said. "He
was very deeply involved in this
campaign and while he wasn't suf
ficient, he was certainly necessary
to bring it off, and without him it
would never have come off as it
did."
Several months ago. words of
praise were once again raised for
Lowenstein ("who has as much a
claim as anyone to be called the
founder of the Mississippi Free

dom Democratic Party"), but this
time not by Moses or SNCC but by
Norman Thomas speaking in
angry defense of Lowenstein
against SNCC and its supporters
who, in some strange migration of
attitude and logic, have come to
regard, not only Lowenstein, but
the whole spectrum of "Liberals"
as "sellouts" and "traitors."
No ".Sellout"
In fact, there has been no "trea
son," no "sellout." by Lowenstein
or any other of the accused "Es
tablishment Liberals," but, rath
er, merely a perseverance in the
attitudes and aims which had once
been SNCC's own, and are no
more.
Most simply, the split between
SNCC and non-SNCC liberals can
be described in the following
terms: Lowenstein recognizes, and
has always recognized, that the
vote is only one step in a process
of attaining true freedom but
also recognizes that it is a nec
essary step indeed, a precondi
tion to other liberation.
"Obviously, the problem isn't
finished when we get the vote,"
he has said, "If when we get the
vote, we sink back into sloth, then
we've abandoned the field . . . The
vote only makes fundamental so
cial change possible; it does not
guarantee it."
SNCC. on the other hand, while
accepting with full vigor the no
tion that the vote doesn't guaran
tee social change, has apparently
rejected the concomitant belief
that the vote makes social change
possible.
The old slogan "One Man, One
Vote" the slogan under which
"liberals" and SNCC fought for
so long, together has become an
insufficient banner for SNCC's
new and vaguely defined "revo
lution."
Rallying < ry
"Docs voting make a man
free?" SNCC staff member (and
former Stanford student) Dennis
Sweeney asks. "Clearly it doesn't,"
he answers.
SNCC's new ralh ing cry (in the
words of Bob Moses) is this:
"The best way to keep a man a
slave is to give him a vote and
call him free."
Or, in lli»- more punrenl phrase

ology of SNCC's Stokley Char
miehael (speaking at a recent SOC
conference): "I don't believe in
majority vote; I thing majority
rule stinks."
Not too many years ago, how
ever. the idea of true "majority
rule" for Mississippi looked like
Utopia.
•The Whites Had Won'
"When I first got to Mississippi
(in July of 1963)," Lowenstein
remembered, "everything was
finished. The whites had won.
There were a few SNCC kids hold
ing out . . . but the people literally
had no hope l . . . They were so
scared . . . What could you do?"
What Lowenstein did was to
stay in Mississippi.
lie had gone to Mississippi that
year as a lawyer "because the only
white lawyer handling civil rights
cases had just been forced to leave
the state." He planned to stay a
couple of days no more."
"But then, he recalled, "it got
hard to leave ... I was only going
to stay for a short time . . . But
people were being beaten and ar
rested and terrorized and nobody
seemed to know or care . . .
"So I stayed."
Stone Wall
Lowenstein realized at once that
traditional procedures had run up
against a stone wall in Mississippi.
"What we had to do," he explain
ed; "was to figure out new tactics
. . . It seemed then that you
couldn't appeal to Washington, be
cause 1 nobody knew or cared . . .
We had to shake people on the
outside out of thinking that Mis
sissippi was just another state . .
Then, when all seemed hope
less, Lowenstein came up with the
idea for a Mock Vote drive
(eventually, "The Aaron Henry
for Governor Campaign") an
idea that proved to be the progen
itor of both the Mississippi Sum
mer Project and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
This is what Norman Thomas
and others mean when they say
that Lowenstein has as good a
claim as any to he called the
founder of the MFDP.
Lowenstein first thought that
perhaps Mississippi N eg rocs
should hold a "day of mourning"
as disenfranchi/ed South African

blacks had done at the time of the
Sharpesville Massacre.
"But then I thought," Lowen
stein recalled, "that it shouldn't
be a 'day of mourning'; it must be
a day of voting."
Protest Vote
The idea at first a "protest
vote"- was tried in Greenwood in
the state democratic primary
that summer, "but it didn't make
any headway."
Then, Bob Moses translated the
"protest vote" concept into a
"Mock Election" and shifted the
context from the primary election
to the general state election. Thus,
the "Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign," with Lowenstein as
chairman of the Campaign Advis
ory Committee, began 10 take
shape.
In retrospect, it seems clear
that the "Aaron Henry Compaign
was the turning point of the Mis
sissippi Movement the one tactic
that, after long years of failure,
finally showed the way to suc
cess.
The "Mock Vote' was aimed at
demonstrating both the desire of
the Mississippi Negro to vote and
the political inequities of the
state system which prevent him
from fulfilling that desire. It
succeeded, not only in that aim,
but in involving large numbers
of college students (particularly
students from Yale and Stan
ford) for the first time in the
harsh realities of Mississippi life.
This initial involvement paved the
way for the Mississippi Summer
Project and much of the rapid
progess that Mississippi lias wit
nessed to date.
The "Mock Election." conduct
ed concurrently with the official
state election, ran Aaron Henry,
a Negro pharmacist from Ciarks
dale, Mississippi, for governor and
the Reverend Edward King, Tuga
loo Chaplain, for Lieutenant gov
ernor.
The Mock Vote workers regis
tered Mississippi Negroes on their
own forms and conducted a free
dom election based on that regis
tration which drew over 100,000
local participants despite gross
intimidation from the white com
munity.
As election day neared and the
mock vote approached real suc
cess, harrassment of the voter reg
istration workers became so se-
as to effectively stall the
project.
At one of the lowest points in
the campaign, after his release
from jail, Lowenstein contacted
several students at Stanford and
told them how bad the situation
had become.
A small group of Stanford stu
dents, including Dennis Sweeney,
