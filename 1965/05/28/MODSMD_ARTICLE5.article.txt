# SNCC: New Directions, New Problems
## 
### 
Editor's note: The following ar
ticle is a discussion of the na
ture and history of the split that
has developed in the civil rights
movement between the Student
Non-Violent Coordinating Com
mittee (SNCC) and the so-called
"liberal establishment." It is
based on an interview with Alia id
K. Lowenstein, Assistant Dean of
Men at Stanford from 1961-62.
Lowenstein, as the article in
dicates, has been active, in one
capacity or another, in the civil
rights movement ever since his
undergraduate years at the Uni
versity of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill. He is a former presi
dent of NSA. has worked on the
staffs of Hubert Humphrey and
Frank Graham, has written a
book, "Brutal Mandate," based
on his trip to South West Africa
(which lie recounted in testimony
before the United Nations), and
has worked with the non-commu
nist Opposition Forces in Spain.
He is both a lawyer and a teacher
ami has taught in llie Political Sci
ence departments at Stanford and
North Carolina State University
at Raleigh.
This year, he was, for a brief
time, a "Writer-inßesidenee" in
Vale's Stiles College and later
worked with the Ford Foundation
on problems of higher education.
He is now Director of the Encamp
ment for citizenship.

A year and a half ago, in Novem
ber of 1963, Bob Moses of SNCC,
addressing the Aaron Henry for
Governor Campaign victory rally,
spoke in praise of Professor Allard
K. Lowenstein and the contribu
tion he had made to the civil rights
struggle in Mississippi.
"He's a man who transcends a
lot of situations," Moses said. "He
was very deeply involved in this
campaign and while he wasn't suf
ficient, he was certainly necessary
to bring it off, and without him it
would never have come off as it
did."
Several months ago. words of
praise were once again raised for
Lowenstein ("who has as much a
claim as anyone to be called the
founder of the Mississippi Free

dom Democratic Party"), but this
time not by Moses or SNCC but by
Norman Thomas speaking in
angry defense of Lowenstein
against SNCC and its supporters
who, in some strange migration of
attitude and logic, have come to
regard, not only Lowenstein, but
the whole spectrum of "Liberals"
as "sellouts" and "traitors."
No ".Sellout"
In fact, there has been no "trea
son," no "sellout." by Lowenstein
or any other of the accused "Es
tablishment Liberals," but, rath
er, merely a perseverance in the
attitudes and aims which had once
been SNCC's own, and are no
more.
Most simply, the split between
SNCC and non-SNCC liberals can
be described in the following
terms: Lowenstein recognizes, and
has always recognized, that the
vote is only one step in a process
of attaining true freedom but
also recognizes that it is a nec
essary step indeed, a precondi
tion to other liberation.
"Obviously, the problem isn't
finished when we get the vote,"
he has said, "If when we get the
vote, we sink back into sloth, then
we've abandoned the field . . . The
vote only makes fundamental so
cial change possible; it does not
guarantee it."
SNCC. on the other hand, while
accepting with full vigor the no
tion that the vote doesn't guaran
tee social change, has apparently
rejected the concomitant belief
that the vote makes social change
possible.
The old slogan "One Man, One
Vote" the slogan under which
"liberals" and SNCC fought for
so long, together has become an
insufficient banner for SNCC's
new and vaguely defined "revo
lution."
Rallying < ry
"Docs voting make a man
free?" SNCC staff member (and
former Stanford student) Dennis
Sweeney asks. "Clearly it doesn't,"
he answers.
SNCC's new ralh ing cry (in the
words of Bob Moses) is this:
"The best way to keep a man a
slave is to give him a vote and
call him free."
Or, in lli»- more punrenl phrase

ology of SNCC's Stokley Char
miehael (speaking at a recent SOC
conference): "I don't believe in
majority vote; I thing majority
rule stinks."
Not too many years ago, how
ever. the idea of true "majority
rule" for Mississippi looked like
Utopia.
•The Whites Had Won'
"When I first got to Mississippi
(in July of 1963)," Lowenstein
remembered, "everything was
finished. The whites had won.
There were a few SNCC kids hold
ing out . . . but the people literally
had no hope l . . . They were so
scared . . . What could you do?"
What Lowenstein did was to
stay in Mississippi.
lie had gone to Mississippi that
year as a lawyer "because the only
white lawyer handling civil rights
cases had just been forced to leave
the state." He planned to stay a
couple of days no more."
"But then, he recalled, "it got
hard to leave ... I was only going
to stay for a short time . . . But
people were being beaten and ar
rested and terrorized and nobody
seemed to know or care . . .
"So I stayed."
Stone Wall
Lowenstein realized at once that
traditional procedures had run up
against a stone wall in Mississippi.
"What we had to do," he explain
ed; "was to figure out new tactics
. . . It seemed then that you
couldn't appeal to Washington, be
cause 1 nobody knew or cared . . .
We had to shake people on the
outside out of thinking that Mis
sissippi was just another state . .
Then, when all seemed hope
less, Lowenstein came up with the
idea for a Mock Vote drive
(eventually, "The Aaron Henry
for Governor Campaign") an
idea that proved to be the progen
itor of both the Mississippi Sum
mer Project and the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party.
This is what Norman Thomas
and others mean when they say
that Lowenstein has as good a
claim as any to he called the
founder of the MFDP.
Lowenstein first thought that
perhaps Mississippi N eg rocs
should hold a "day of mourning"
as disenfranchi/ed South African

blacks had done at the time of the
Sharpesville Massacre.
"But then I thought," Lowen
stein recalled, "that it shouldn't
be a 'day of mourning'; it must be
a day of voting."
Protest Vote
The idea at first a "protest
vote"- was tried in Greenwood in
the state democratic primary
that summer, "but it didn't make
any headway."
Then, Bob Moses translated the
"protest vote" concept into a
"Mock Election" and shifted the
context from the primary election
to the general state election. Thus,
the "Aaron Henry for Governor
Campaign," with Lowenstein as
chairman of the Campaign Advis
ory Committee, began 10 take
shape.
In retrospect, it seems clear
that the "Aaron Henry Compaign
was the turning point of the Mis
sissippi Movement the one tactic
that, after long years of failure,
finally showed the way to suc
cess.
The "Mock Vote' was aimed at
demonstrating both the desire of
the Mississippi Negro to vote and
the political inequities of the
state system which prevent him
from fulfilling that desire. It
succeeded, not only in that aim,
but in involving large numbers
of college students (particularly
students from Yale and Stan
ford) for the first time in the
harsh realities of Mississippi life.
This initial involvement paved the
way for the Mississippi Summer
Project and much of the rapid
progess that Mississippi lias wit
nessed to date.
The "Mock Election." conduct
ed concurrently with the official
state election, ran Aaron Henry,
a Negro pharmacist from Ciarks
dale, Mississippi, for governor and
the Reverend Edward King, Tuga
loo Chaplain, for Lieutenant gov
ernor.
The Mock Vote workers regis
tered Mississippi Negroes on their
own forms and conducted a free
dom election based on that regis
tration which drew over 100,000
local participants despite gross
intimidation from the white com
munity.
