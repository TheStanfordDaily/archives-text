# NSA Gives Grant For CE Building
## Will Cover Half Of Projected Cost 
### 
The National Science Founda
tion has granted $425,075 to Stan
ford for its projected $1 million
Chemical Engineering Building,
the University announced today.
The grant was made on condition
it be matched by funds from priv
i ate sources.
Alumni and other friends of
Stanford have so far given and
pledged an additional $241,000 to
ward the project, Stanford Vice-
President for Finance Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson reports, and efforts
are being stepped up to attract
the additional gift funds.
Meanwhile, Stanford Trustees
have approved final plans for the
building. And because of the ur
gent need to assemble under one
roof operations in chemical engi
neering now in five separate carn-
I pus locations, they have also uu
i thori/.ed a temporary advance
from undesignated funds contrib
j uted in Stanford's recent capital
, campaign to assure financing
| while fund-raising proceeds.
Final Plans
Bids were received this week and
construction is scheduled to begin
in June. The building, designed by
architects Clark, Stromquist, Pot
tcr and Ehrlich, should be ready
for occupancy by summer 1966.
Thomas Church is the landscape
architect.
The NSF grant specifies that
$369,630 of its total be allocated to
construction costs, and about $55,-
500 for general purpose labora
j tory apparatus. Each of these
j amounts must be matched separ-
I ately with non-federal funds,
i J
The Chemical Engineering
j Building, containing some 20,000
I square feet of space, will be the
third similarly designed structure
situated at the rear of the old
I Chemistry Building. All three are
: for use primarily for the growing
I Stanford programs of graduate
j instruction and research.
Laboratories
Th e Chemical Engineering
Building, however, will include one
j laboratory where undergraduate
teaching and operations will be
! carried on. The work of probably
! some 50 graduate students and Hi
faculty eventually will he cen
: tered there.
It is now planned to include a
, ground level glass enclosed eon
i building and the John Stauffer
I Laboratory for Physical Chemis
-Iry, similar to the "gazebo" sep
arating Physical Chemistry from
j the Stauffer organic chemistry
space is proving highly useful to
, meet varied needs for increased
communication among scientists.

President for Finance Kenneth M.
Cuthbertson reports, and efforts
are being stepped up to attract
the additional gift funds.
Meanwhile, Stanford Trustees
have approved final plans for the
building. And because of the ur
gent need to assemble under one
roof operations in chemical engi
neering now in five separate carn-
I pus locations, they have also uu
i thori/.ed a temporary advance
from undesignated funds contrib
j uted in Stanford's recent capital
, campaign to assure financing
| while fund-raising proceeds.
Final Plans
Bids were received this week and
construction is scheduled to begin
in June. The building, designed by
architects Clark, Stromquist, Pot
tcr and Ehrlich, should be ready
for occupancy by summer 1966.
Thomas Church is the landscape
architect.
The NSF grant specifies that
$369,630 of its total be allocated to
construction costs, and about $55,-
500 for general purpose labora
j tory apparatus. Each of these
j amounts must be matched separ-
I ately with non-federal funds,
i J
The Chemical Engineering
j Building, containing some 20,000
I square feet of space, will be the
third similarly designed structure
situated at the rear of the old
I Chemistry Building. All three are
: for use primarily for the growing
I Stanford programs of graduate
j instruction and research.
Laboratories
Th e Chemical Engineering
Building, however, will include one
j laboratory where undergraduate
teaching and operations will be
! carried on. The work of probably
! some 50 graduate students and Hi
faculty eventually will he cen
: tered there.
It is now planned to include a
, ground level glass enclosed eon
i building and the John Stauffer
I Laboratory for Physical Chemis
-Iry, similar to the "gazebo" sep
arating Physical Chemistry from
j the Stauffer organic chemistry
space is proving highly useful to
, meet varied needs for increased
communication among scientists.
The National Science Founda
tion has granted $425,075 to Stan
ford for its projected $1 million
Chemical Engineering Building,
the University announced today.
The grant was made on condition
it be matched by funds from priv
i ate sources.
Alumni and other friends of
Stanford have so far given and
