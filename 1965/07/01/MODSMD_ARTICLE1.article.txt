# Stanford Is "Summer Festival"
## 
### 
STANFORD â€” Summer session courses under the
umbrella of a unique "atmosphere for learning" are
the order of the season on campus.
The program is the distinctive combination of a
major eight-week Festival of the Arts tied directly
to the classroom offerings of Stanford's five main
humanities departments, and strengthened further by
an extensive program of public lectures, exhibits, and
discussions.
The festival, now in its second summer, is planned
as an annual project with a changing theme.
THIS SUMMER the University's Music, Drama,
Art, English, and History Departments are basing their
classwork programs on the theme for the 1965 festival,
"The Mozart Era."
Instruction will be integrated with performances
by the Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra, Opera da Camera
di Milano, New York City Opera, Amadeus string quar
tet, Austrian pianist Paul Badura-Skoda, and other
accomplished musicians and actors.
Through an impressive array of 115 events sched
uled during the summer quarter, the dedicated scholar,
the young student, the music buff, and even the oc
casional theater-goer each have an opportunity to
enjoy the festival at the levels which individual inter
ests dictate.
FOR THE intensely interested, detailed discussions
with the visiting artists, tutoring by some others, lec
tures and workshop projects all are features of the
"in-depth" festival.

On the classroom level, the Music Department is
offering an Institute of Classic Music and complemen
tary course in Ensemble Performance coached by the
Amadeus Quartet. In addition, there is a music survey
course keyed to festival events, a workshop in choral
music of the 18th century and a master class in piano
taught by Badura-Skoda.
The department also has planned a three-day con
ference in which six outstanding musicologists will
explore Mozart and the classic style in the light of
modern interpretive methods.
THE DRAMA Department is offering a summer
workshop in Baroque Comedy. Students participating
will be coached by members of the Stanford faculty,
Baroque era comedy specialist Norman N. Holland
from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and four
members of the famous San Francisco satirical revue,
"The Committee," a modern entertainment form with
historical roots in the Baroque era.
As part of the learning process, students enrolled
in music and drama courses wil participate in concerts
and plays on the festival calendar.
Art, history, and English classes exploring "The
Mozart Era" also are being offered.
ON A more informal level, the University has
planned an extensive series of public lectures by visit
ing and Stanford scholars. Background on the life and
music of Mozart and his contemporaries and 18th cen
tury history, art, drama, and literature will be dis
cussed.

Among the lecturers are Anna Amilie Abert, musi
cologist from University of Kiel, Germany; Christopher
Ricks, 18th century English literature specialist from
Oxford; and Robert Wark, curator of the Huntington
Art. Museum.
In addition, films, exhibits, and musicales have
been scheduled throughout the summer as free public
events.
WHILE AT Stanford, the Stuttgart orchestra will
perform five different programs each twice. The
Milan opera will produce Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte,"
the American premiere of Duni's "L'lsolo dei Pazzi,"
and two one-act operas by Pergolesi: "La Serva Pa
drona" and "Livietta e Tracollo." The New York City
Opera will make its first west coast appearance with
"The Marriage of Figaro," "The Abduction from the
Seraglio," and "Don Giovanni," all sung in English.
The Baroque Comedy Workshop will stage "Turan
dot" by Carlo Gozzi and"The Critic" by Richard
Sheridan.
STANFORD sees this unique envolvement of an
entire university in an artistic festival as an oppor
tunity to fulfill the University's role as a cultural lead
er and as a way to add sparkle to the summer aca
demic program.
Prof. Virgil K. Whitaker, dean of the graduate divi
sion, heads a committee of humanities department
heads which plans and coordinates the Stan ford
festival.
