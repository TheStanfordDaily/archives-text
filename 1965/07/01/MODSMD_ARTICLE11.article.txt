# 'The King And I' Admirably Acted
## 
### 
When I saw "The King and I"
at the Curran Theatre recently
I couldn't help realizing once
again why the theater is such an
exciting entertainment medium
—both to watch and to work in.
Admittedly, the theater can
match neither the scope nor the
technical perfection possible in
films. What it cart offer, howev
er, is the realization that each
performance is unique—not quite
like any that preceded or will fol
low it.
This was brought home to me
n two ways:
As Lun Tha, Burmese lover of
the slave Tuptim, I saw Terence
JVtonk — the understudy. In and
of itself, seeing an understudy is
nothing especially noteworthy.
But this was Monk's first per
formance as Lun Tha and he was
excellent. Lun Tha is not a great
ly demanding role dramatically,
but he and Tuptim have two
beautiful love duets, and Monk
made the most of them. Monk
has greatly improved since I saw
his Freddy in the Circle Star's
"My Fair Lady" last October and
when the entire cast had taken
their bows, they pushed him for
ward and joined the audience in
another ovation for him.

• The other truly exciting event
came when Ricardo Montalban,
as the king, finally mastered the
polka and went whirling (with
Florence Henderson) around the
stage .This moment in "Shall We
Dance?" so enraptured the audi
ence that spontaneous applause
broke out in the middle of the
number.
But "The King and I" is more
than just a few isolated exciting
moments. It is a truly great mus
ical — quite possibly Rodgers and
Hammerstein's masterpiece —
and this production does it full
justice .
I have seen Yul Brynner play
the king both on stage and
screen; Montalban tops him in
what will surely rank as the def
initive portrayal of the role.
Montlaban captures not only the
king's childishness and arro
gance but the necessary sincerity
and charm to make the king
sympathetic.
Miss Henderson brings a lovely
voice to the part of Anna — the
English schoolmistress who
comes to Siam to teach the
king's children and stays to tame
him. Although Anna's essential
warmth was missing in the open
ing scenes, Miss Henederson im
proved as the evening pro
gressed.
Joyce Bryant's Tuptim was
also beautifully sung. Miss Bry
ant, a Negress, brought a special
, poignance to her narration of the
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" ballet.
Paul C. McOuire's sets were
magnificent, nicely utilizing one
basic unit which could be varied
for specific scenes. Originally de
signed for the new theater in
New York's Lincoln Center last
year, the sets at times cramped
the actors (noticeably in the first
scene), but that is the fault of
the Curran's inadequate stage
and not McGuire.
Edward Greenberg's direction
was almost totally unoriginal but
nonetheless adequate. Jerome
Robbins* choreography, recreated
by Yuriko, was as stunning as
when I first saw "The King and
I" almost 14 years ago — just a
few months after its New York
opening.
This is a magnificently mount
ed and superbly sung production
of a theatrical classic. It should
not be missed.

and charm to make the king
sympathetic.
Miss Henderson brings a lovely
voice to the part of Anna — the
English schoolmistress who
comes to Siam to teach the
king's children and stays to tame
him. Although Anna's essential
warmth was missing in the open
ing scenes, Miss Henederson im
proved as the evening pro
gressed.
Joyce Bryant's Tuptim was
also beautifully sung. Miss Bry
ant, a Negress, brought a special
, poignance to her narration of the
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" ballet.
Paul C. McOuire's sets were
magnificent, nicely utilizing one
basic unit which could be varied
for specific scenes. Originally de
signed for the new theater in
New York's Lincoln Center last
year, the sets at times cramped
the actors (noticeably in the first
scene), but that is the fault of
the Curran's inadequate stage
and not McGuire.
Edward Greenberg's direction
was almost totally unoriginal but
nonetheless adequate. Jerome
Robbins* choreography, recreated
by Yuriko, was as stunning as
when I first saw "The King and
I" almost 14 years ago — just a
few months after its New York
opening.
This is a magnificently mount
ed and superbly sung production
of a theatrical classic. It should
not be missed.
When I saw "The King and I"
at the Curran Theatre recently
I couldn't help realizing once
again why the theater is such an
exciting entertainment medium
—both to watch and to work in.
Admittedly, the theater can
match neither the scope nor the
technical perfection possible in
films. What it cart offer, howev
er, is the realization that each
performance is unique—not quite
like any that preceded or will fol
low it.
This was brought home to me
n two ways:
As Lun Tha, Burmese lover of
the slave Tuptim, I saw Terence
JVtonk — the understudy. In and
of itself, seeing an understudy is
nothing especially noteworthy.
But this was Monk's first per
formance as Lun Tha and he was
excellent. Lun Tha is not a great
ly demanding role dramatically,
but he and Tuptim have two
beautiful love duets, and Monk
made the most of them. Monk
has greatly improved since I saw
his Freddy in the Circle Star's
"My Fair Lady" last October and
when the entire cast had taken
their bows, they pushed him for
ward and joined the audience in
another ovation for him.

• The other truly exciting event
came when Ricardo Montalban,
as the king, finally mastered the
polka and went whirling (with
Florence Henderson) around the
stage .This moment in "Shall We
Dance?" so enraptured the audi
ence that spontaneous applause
broke out in the middle of the
number.
But "The King and I" is more
than just a few isolated exciting
moments. It is a truly great mus
ical — quite possibly Rodgers and
Hammerstein's masterpiece —
and this production does it full
justice .
I have seen Yul Brynner play
the king both on stage and
screen; Montalban tops him in
what will surely rank as the def
initive portrayal of the role.
Montlaban captures not only the
king's childishness and arro
gance but the necessary sincerity
and charm to make the king
sympathetic.
