# Mural Of The Student Mind

### 
When a young man is found
scribbling on a fence, he is usu
ally arested. When a Stanford
student is found scribbling on a
fence, he's doing a project for
the art department.
The construction for the un
dergraduate library has brought
many things to the campus,
among them an eight-foot high
fence, 2000 feet long. Recognizing
the possibilities of the fence, the
art department turned its stu
dents loose on it, resulting in the
longest outdoor mural in Cali
fornia.
AT FIRST, campus residents
were disturbed to see the beauti
ful battle-ship grey product of
Engstrum and Nourse being re
placed by the avant-garde de
signs of James Bond. But since
Stanford is always susceptible to
change, due to its being on the
edge of greatness, the fence was
slowly accepted.
Also featured is a machine
which is turned by the force of
the wind. The wind vane turns,
moving other parts which defy
description. The end result is
that a ratchet-like device strikes
a piece of tin, disturbing the stu
dents in the education building.
The library will be completed
in July, 1966, and the fence will
have to go. Where it will go opens
up a new spectre of speculation.
Should it be preserved in the
Smithsonian? Or should it be
left intact, since it may enhance
the campus more than the new
library?
