# 3 Dates, 1 Dollar
## Cybernetics vs Solitude 
### STEVE GRUBER 
Four medical students introduced the student
body to computerized dating Monday at their
booth set up outside the Pavilion.
The system, called Stanford Match, will at
tempt to give each student three "guaranteed
compatible dates" at a cost of one dollar for all
three. Students are required to fill out a two
page questionnaire to determine what they will
expect in a date.
ROGER GRIFFITH heads the project and is
given credit for being its originator. Portia Mos
es has already written the program for the com
puter and Steve Adler and Mike Marchildon will
run the computer.
By the end of registration day, 150 men and
100 women had signed up for Stanford Match.
Acording to Griffith, "The program will not be
run until we have a one to one ratio between
men and women. We expect to have 600 names

by the end of the week.
Male students will receive postcards within a
few days from Stanford Match listing three
names and telephone numbers of compatible
dates. It will be up to thorn to make the first
move.
THE MEDICAL students may make a slight
profit if they can get a special rate from the
University for use of the computers. The usual
rate is $600 per hour and the program for Stan
ford Match will take thirty minutes to run.
So far, they have not been able to claim that
they will be using the computers for academic
purposes. If they can find a professor who would
like to use their information for research, they
will be able to run their program for a much !
lower rate.
If this project proves successful, it will be at
tempted again fall quarter.
