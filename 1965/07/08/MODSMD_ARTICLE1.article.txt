## 
### BO O'NEILL 
Friday, June eleventh, five
members of an eight-man team
consisting of members of cam
pus Radio Station KZSU and
be Stanford Daily departed on
a three month journalistic ad
enture to Mississippi.
Roger Dankert, Mary Kae
decker, feature editor of the
Stanford Daily, Jon Roise, as
sociate editor of the Stanford
">aily, Julie Wells, local news
ditor-elect of KZSU, and Pen
>y Niland, station manager
lect of Radio KZSU, were the
idvance men of "Project
>outh," a combination sociolog
ical study and radio-journalis
iic series whose topic is student
involvement in the South.
The project was conceived ov
er six months ago, when several
members decided that it would
ve interesting and rewarding to
•!o a radio series on some phase
of Civil Rights movement in
he South. Gradually the sub
ect of student involvement be
■ ame the focus of attention of
hose interested in the project.
The project has defined for
itself three aims to guide it in
the South. First, it would like
o focus more meaningful at
ention on the student commu
nity in general, and the stu

dents in Mississippi in particu
lar.
Today, many people condemn
or praise the students involved
in many activities across the
nation, such as the Civil Rights
movement in the South or the
studend Free Speech movement
at Berkeley. However, in most
of the cases there is a conspicu
ous lack of documented evi
dence to make any realistic
conclusion one way or the
other.
Hence one aim of the project
is to gather this documented
evidence concerning the stu
dents involved in the Civil
Rights movement in the South.
In order to do this in a signifi
cant manner all eight of the
project members have been en
rolled in a sociology course un
der Dr. Paul Wallin, created es
pecially to study methods in so
ciological field study, results
iand their correlation and to
create a field plan for the eight
this summer.
Using these tools the students
hope to collect evidence that
will be meaningful in under
standing the students and
thir involvement in the South.
A second aim is to turn so
ciological research into lively,
interesting radio broadcasts. All
of the material collected will be
recorded on tape and presented
in a series of organized and in
formative programs.
With students talking to stu
dents, the programs should be
able to go deeper into the moti
vations and attitudes of the stu
dents involved than ever before.
All of the programs will be
aired on KZSU and the project
hopes that it will be able to re
lease the programs to many
other stations, too.
A final goal is to discuss meth
od and procedure as well as
conclusions. The broadcasts will
attempt to explain what is in
volved in the research process
in order to make listeners more
aware of the need for evidence
and documentation before form
ing opinions.
The team plans to split into
two-man research teams located
in various parts of the state.
Living with the Civil Rights
wohkers they hope to combine
observation with interviews and
to establish a depth of commu
nication that has never before
existed in research on students
or student involvement.
