# AN IBM MATCH
## Good Time Was Had By All 
### GEORGE TRIEYED 
Faith I had. So I called La
gunita and gave my name. "Oh",
she said, "you must be my per
fect match".
I was determined to make my
IBM marriage work, so we were
going to do it up right: A big
evening in the City, the Royal
Ballet at the Opera House, the
Mark Hopkins, et al.
Nervous I was, but faith I had,
and on Saturday night I waited
quietly in the lobby at Lagunita.
A friend came by, and we were
talking, when I noticed Her com
ing towards me. She had a very
nice face, disheveled hair, a yel
low moo-moo and sandals. "Hel
lo, my name is George," I said
wide eyed. "Just call me Jim
my", she said. "But isn't your
name Blythe", said I. "Just call
me Jimmy", she said, and turn
ed to the fellow talking with me j
and said "Well, I'm ready." My ;
entire insides gulped from toe ;
to point of head, and just then
a lovely face, with high heels, i
and well dressed between, ap
proached: My perfect match she
was.
I wanted to see the Royal Bal
let ,deep down inside, that was
what I wanted to do. But, keep
ing an open mind is important.
So I didn't tell her our destina
tion. Rather, as we drove into
the City, I gleaned from her

I conversation the phrases that
would justify making her go to
the ballet. And by the time we
passed the airport, I told Blyth
in my best analytic masculine
voice that I figured out the per
fect evening for a perfect
match. Blyth was eager to know
immediately; but 1 didn't want
to spoil her surprise (and was
n't too sure if my perfect date
from Nebraska would really go
for this ballet stuff). However,
she became more and very anxi
ous, and as we got off the free
way, I felt obliged to give her
the newspaper, and asked her if
there was anything she really

didn't like in the theater sec
tion. She made a favorable com
ment on the Jean Anouihl play,
and just as we were swinging in
to the Opera House parking lot,
she said: "The only thing I
wouldn't enjoy is this Royal Bal
let. I know I wouldn't like that."
I switched the direction blinker
off, and stepped on the gas, and
the Jean Anouihl play "Thieves'
Carnival" was perfect.
For all you believers in won
drous IBM, remain calm; she was
pretty, with an ebullient spirit,
and intelligent, and the match
situation brought out the best
in us.
