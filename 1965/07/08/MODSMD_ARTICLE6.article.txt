# Dr. Garriot Could Be First Scientist-Astronaut
## 
### 
Dr. Owen K. Garriott, an as
sociate professor of electrical
mgineering in Stanford Univer
sity's Radioscience Laboratory,
has been named one of Ameri
ca's first scientist-astronauts.
Soon after the NASA an
nouncement last week, Dr. Oar
riott departed for the NASA
Manned Spacecraft Center at
Houston, Texas. He will be on
eave of absence from his Stan
rord faculty post.
"MY SELECTION for the as

tronaut training program is not
a change of career," he said, "but
a change of career direction. It
presents a rare opportunity for
an ionospheric scientist, who is
normally forced to study his sub
ject from the ground, to actually
get up there and surround him
self with it."
At Stanford Dr. Oarriott has
specialized in research on the
ionosphere — the electrified reg
ion of the atmosphere 70-300
miles above the earth's surface

that reflects radio signals and
makes long distance radio com
munication possible.
Asked what role scientists can
expect to play in space, he re
plied:
"WE DON'T know But we
hope, through our background
and specialized training, to be
able ot make some new contri
butions. However, our first ob
jective should be to see what
scientists can really contribute

in space."
A University of Oklahoma
graduate, Dr. Garriott earned
his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at
Stanford and joined the faculty
in 1961.
He is a project director of
Stanford's satellite receiving
program and a senior scientist
of the Stanford Center for Ra
dar Astronomy. His satellite
monitoring station on the Uni
versity's "antenna farm" has

gleaned valuable information
about the lonosphere's electron
content and rate of lonization
from Sputnik, Transit, Explorer,
Discoverer, and other satellites.
Dr. Oarrlott teaches both un
dergraduate and graduate cours
es in electronic circuits and elec
tromganetic theory. He Is the
author of more than 15 scien
tific publications and is a region
al editor of the scientific Journal
"Planetary and Space Science."
