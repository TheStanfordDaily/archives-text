# Over-Specialized Education Cited By Dean Friedman
## 
### MICHAEL COHEN 
Dr. Mervin B. Freedman, As
sistant Dean of Undergraduate
Education at Stanford, has re
cently published an extended
analysis of the discontents of
the current student generation.
In his article, carried in the
June 14 edition of The Nation,
Dr. Freedman points to a "per
vasive sense of dissatisfaction
with American society as the
common denominator which un
derlies the seemingly diverse
student eruptions occurring on
college campuses throughout the
nation.
WHY ARE students dissatis
fied with so much of American
society? Dean Freedman answers
that they are the first genera
tion to realize, however dimly,
that we have entered into a new
age. The industrial revolution
has ended and the era of auto
mation and cybernation is upon
us. Students are beginning to
realize that their educations will
not prepare them for life in the
coming era.
He also identifies a second, re
lated, source of restlessness: on
college campuses during the last
twenty years the tremendous
emphasis placed on intellectual
performance has produced "an
atmosphere of competitiveness
and isolation" to the detriment
of other social, athletic and cul
tural activities which fulfill real
human needs for feelings of be
longing and participation.
As a result, protest movements
often emphasize the lack of a
sense of community within unl
evrsities, and indeed they often
argue that a university should
be defined as "community of
scholars."
DEAN FREEDMAN points out
three additional goals toward
which students feel themselves
drawn. They want to introduce
"unity into the intellect and the
personality." This desire is a re
action to the increasingly frag
mented, specialized nature of
knowledge.
Students also want to estab
lish the "ethic of social service,"
and the activity of the Peace
Corp and Civil Rights organiza
tions on campuses is good evi
dence of this.

Thirdly, Freedman argues that
students seek what he calls a
"freeing of the impulse of man."
He makes it clear that this does
not mean sexual promiscuity,
but it does mean a freer expres
sion of the more generally re
pressed emotions and an end to
the remaining influences of Vic
torianism and puritanism.
HE QUOTES Henry Murray
who sees new behavior patterns
based on a "hatred of the dom
inant powers, plutocracy, med
iocracy, and finally Mechos, the
cold-blooded dragon of imper
sonal matter -of - factness and
technics, of business, advertis
ing and upward mobility, of hol
low showmen and spurious pres
tige. .
Of course, such attitudes and
desires will have enormous con
sequences for American society.
A large section of the article is
devoted specifically to their
effects on higher education.
Briefly, Dean Freedman pre
dicts an increase of programmed
learning of "routine informa
tion" freeing faculty for semi
nars and small group efforts de
voted to the synthetics of knowl
edge and the search for "new
ways of looking at things.
HE EXPECTS a decline of the
strictly departmental structure
of contemporary higher educa
tion and an increasing emphasis
on creativity and self-realiza
tion as major goals both of ed
ucation and of life.
While he admits that his des
cription does not fit the majority
of current American undergrad
uates, Dean Freedman main
tains that although the avant
garde he has described "is a
ripple today, (it) will be a wave
tomorrow."
