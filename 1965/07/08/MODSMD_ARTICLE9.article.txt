# Campus Collections Feature Artifacts Of Mozart Era
## Scores Displaed At Bender Room 
### 
Two exhibits of artifacts from
the Mozart Era are now on dis
play on campus; and will run
through the summer.
The first is a collection of
music manuscripts, early printed
scores, instruments and litho
graphs relating to the baroque
era on display in the Albert M.
Bender Room at the Main Li
brary.
AN EXHIBITION of 18th cen
tury stage and theater designs
by members of the artistically
famous Bibiena family is being
shown at the Stanford Art Gal
lery.
The Bender Room display was
planned by Stanford music li
brarian Edward E. Colby with an
eye to the spiritual and intellec
tual environment in which Mo
zart lived. It includes early
~ printed scores by Haydn, Glu'ck_
Gossec and Arne, and copies of
"La Marseillaise" and the tune
of "The Star Spangled Banner"
— all contemporary to Mozart.
THE EXHIBIT will be open
weekdays from 9 to 5 and Sat
urdays from 9 to noon.
Prof. Dwight Miller of the Art
Department planned the display
at the Art Gallery. Material for
the exhibit is from the Donald
Oenslager collection, Cooper
Union Museum, and the Princs
ton University Theater Collec
tion.
The Art Gallery is open Tues
day through Saturday from 10
to 5, and Sundays from 1 to 5.
The exhibit includes about
forty-five items — original draw
ings, prints, designs for theatri
cal spectacles, books and photo
graphs — and shows the kind of
theaters and stage sets which
were used during the 18th cen
tury.
