# Mozart Era Youth Orchestra

### STEVE GRUBER 
Pat Cotter played his violin last Sunday in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium along with 93 other mu
sicians. The difference between this concert and
any other on the Stanford campus was that Cotter
and his friends were high school students.
The 94 members of the Summer Youth Orches
tra, led by Dr. Kuhn of the music department, de
parted Sunday after a two week stay in Stern Hall.
Pat Cotter was a typical member of the or
chestra. H? lives in San Francisco and attends
Riordan High School. Riordan, as would be ex
pected, really does not have the facilities for ade
quate music instruction. In fact, the only musical
organization at the school is the school band. Cotter
is a member of the band and plays a flute.
In the Summer Youth Orchestra, he plays
violin, which he learned through private instruction.
Cotter will be a junior next year but is already
making plans to major in music in college. His

first choice is Gonzaga University in Seattle. If
he doesn't attend Gonzaga, he will go to San Fran
cisco State College.
He nnd the other members of the orchestra
kept a busy schedule while they were here. From
8:30 to 11.00 in the morning, the orchestra prac
ticed in Dinkelspiel. At 1:00, they attended a
music theory class, emphasizing many of the things
that they would expect to find only on the college
level of music instruction.
After lunch, the orchestra would ordinarily
practice for another hour as a group, then adjourn
into section rehearsals. Out of these many hours
of practice came two concerts, one held on Sunday,
July 4, and the other on July 11.
The cost per student was about $115, but Pat
Cotter managed to get his costs reduced by half
due to a scholarship from the University.
This is the first time that most of the students
have lived in a dormitory and according to Cotter,
"It's better than I thought it would be."
