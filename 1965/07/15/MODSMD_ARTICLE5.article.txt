# Sigma Chi Continues To Battle National
## 
### 
"I had no idea when I
accepted the bid that all
this would happen," Kenneth
Washington, Negro pledge to the
Stanford chapter of Sigma Chi
fraternity, told a writer for Look
Magazine.
In a five-page illustrated arti
cle, the magazine reviews in its
July 27 issue the events sur
rounding suspension of the
Stanford chapter's charter by
the national fraternity, after
the Stanford group announced
its intention to issue bids with
out regard to race or religion.
The Stanford Chis are called
"cool reformers" by Look, which
quotes them as saying: "We
don't want to impose our ideas
on anybody. We just want the
national to leave us alone to do
what we think is right."
Although the official reason
given for suspension was the
Stanford chapter's alleged fail
ure to carry on "the ritual,
standards and traditions of the

fraternity," Look reports mem
bers were "sure that they were
being punished for pledging
Kenneth Washington."
Their fight to remain in the
national "affects many of our
colleges," this article states.
The charter suspension for
one year was ordered in April
by Sigma Chi's executive com
mittee, and the action was up
held by the fraternity's national
convention in June.
But suport for the Stanford
chapter position, backed firmly
by Stanford President Wallace
Sterling and the Board of Trus
tees, is being voiced in many
quarters. These include Com
missioner Francis Keppel of the
U.S. Office of Education, U.S.
Senator Lee Metcalf (D.-Mont.).,
Governor Edmund G. Brown of
California, and a number of col
lege presidents.
Keppel stated flatly that under
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, col
leges receiving federal funds are
responsible for assuring that
fraternities on their campuses
do not practice racial discrimi
nation.
The University of Colorado
asked Sigma Chi for proof that
the Stanford suspension had no
connection with Washington's
race. After a review of the case,
it ordered the Colorado Sigma
Chi chapter put on probation.
"Through all the uproar, the
boys in the Stanford chapter
stayed cool," reports Look. The
magazine quotes Frank Olrich,
last year's president, as saying
the fraternity "means a lot to
most of us" and the members
want to stay in it.
"We're not on any crusade,"
the Olrich comment continued.
"We pledged Ken because he's a
nice guy and a good man. If oth
er chapters want to pass up
good members because of their
color, that's their problem."
