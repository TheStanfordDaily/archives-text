# School Chief May Face New York Teacher Strike
## 
### 
Dr. Bernard Donovan, new superintendent of New
York City Schools, will be welcomed to his new job Sept.
1 with a possible teachers' strike, he predicted at a Stan
ford meeting of school administrators last Tuesday night.
In a talk to a California Association of School Ad
ministrators workshop co-sponsored by the Stanford
School of Education, Dr. Donovan revealed he has only a
$32 million lump sum surplus in his new budget with
which to meet some $293 million worth of teacher de
mands.
"IT TAKES a long time to move a giant, but we're
moving it," said Donovan, who replaces Calvin E. Gross
as head of a system with a budget of $1 billion, 100 mli
lion for 1965-66.
New York has 48,000 teachers, of whom 33,000 are
members of the American Federation of Teachers, AFL
CIO, "not to mention some 17 other professional teacher
groups," he told the gathering.
He said that New York will abandon the junior high
school system this fall and switch to the 4-44 system —
four years of pre-kindergarten through fourth grade,
four years of fifth through eighth grade "intermediate"
school, and four years of high school.
IN ADDITION, New York City for the first time
will be subdivided into 30 school districts each with an
assistant superintendent and a staff of 15 in charge.
"I've told each man to solve his own district prob
lems and not come running downtown to me," the Brook
lyn-born career educator told the 150 administrators in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Each child will be kept in his own neighborhood
school for the first four years, Supt. Donovan told the

group, but after that under the city's "open enrollment"
plan, any child may transfer from one school to anohter.
There is no compulsory busing of anyone, he emphasized.
NEW YORK'S 900 schools will be populated by
1,070,000 students this fall — the world's largest system,
with 3,000 administrators and 16,000 staff members rang
ing from janitors to psychiatrists, he reported.
The enrollment has now reached a racial balance
point, he revealed, with 50 per cent Negro-Puerto Rican
and 50 per cent white and other students.
Under his administration, there will be system-wide
standards of achievement, integration and curriculum.
"THERE ARE no niceties like football fields and play
grounds," he told the administrators. "Nothing else mat
ters except the results obtained from the proper educa
tion of the children."
Supt. Donovan said the 4-4-4 system was adopted be
cause "we tried the junior high system, and it never
worked out for us. It's too hard to teach."
"The 4-44 we think is a partial answer to
the social revolution we're in — it's part of the changing
society."
"If anything is doing in New York, it's changing," he
told the gathering, revealing that:
♦HE WILL ask the Ford Foundation to underwrite
a program for the "general student — the student who
doesn't know what he wants"—so that teachers can
learn how to motivate him.
•New high schools will be built at "centers of tran
sit" under the system's $200 million annual construction
budget.
•Though "we bus everybody from pre-kindergarten

through high school," he will seek ways to cut down the
$34 million annual cost of school transportation.
*In some heavily Puerto Rican districts, there is as
much as a 200 per cent turnover in annual student en
rollment. "But since Puerto Rico has begun to teach
English in its own schools the New York teacher's job
will become easier."
"WE HAVE tried every known method to improve
reading skills but the results haven't been good. I think
we have too many specialists. I'm willing to level the
charge that the teacher training institutions haven't
been able to teach reading skills to the teachers them
selves. If you can't teach reading, you can't teach much
else. This kind of student frustration leads to dropouts
as early as the fifth grade."
"The constant demands for increasing school costs
brings the Federal government into the picture. This
brings a lot of strings with it. All Federal funds have
to be accounted for separately, which wil require us to
keep two sets of books. Worst of all, it comes out of the
same taxpayers' pockets anyway."
*Of THE 33,000 teachers in the New York system who
belong to the American Federation of Teachers, AFL
CIO — "if the union would develop a more mature atti
tude toward solving our educational problems and show
a less fanatic desire to recruit, we could be very happy
together."
Supt. Donovan, educated through the doctorate in
the New York system and New York University, served
for two weeks as a consultant to Prof. Wi liam R. Odell's
school administrators workshop, which concluded last
Friday afternoon.
