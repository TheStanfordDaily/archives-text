# What's New Pussycat Funny But Not New
## 
### ROBERT EGRI 
I had asumed since Woody
Allen has always projected the
image of the short, funny neu
rotic that his picture What's
New Pussycat would bear the
same characteristics. I was only
half right.
The picture is funny and neu
rotic but not sloppy; on the con
trary it's quite a slick, expan
sive venture. This, however, is
not evident in the plot which
bears a gruesome resemblance
to Rock Hudson-Doris Day type
films where girl wants to marry
boy but boy is not quite ready
to capitulate because of an ov
eractive libido.
THAT THE plot is a cliche
and that we can predict every
thing that happens, matters lit
tle, for we are primarily con
cerned with how it happens and
when Peter Sellers and Woody
Allen are on the screen it hap
pens funny, when Peter O'Toole
and Romy Schneider are on it
happens terrible.
Sellers and Allen use the script
as a jumping off point for their
comic imagination. Sellers cast
as the lechcrous, long-haired
psychoanalyst is hysterically
funny as he goes through his
repertoire of temper tantrums
and fits of libido (sexual assaults
in legal terminology).
ALLEN plays the little man
on the outside trying desperate
ly to get in (figuratively and lit
erally) . Chaplin is the archetype
here. Allen's constantly trying
to seduce someone — anyone,
and the portrayal of the inex
perienced seducer by itself jus
tifies going to see the picture.
In contradistinction to the
previous gentlemen Romy Sch
neider conclusively proves that
she does not understand come
dy and can not produce it. Her
concept of humor seems to de
rive from the I Love Lucy
school which, in brief, asserts
that if you run around and
scream a lot you are the essence
of Funny.
HENCE Miss Schneider runs
around and screams a lot, hence
she comes on as a high velocity,

hysterical woman which, when
you stop and think about it,
really isn't funny. Capucine in a
minor role also partakes of this
category.
PETER O'TOOLE, the man
seen most on the screen, gives
an uneven performance. He
seems to draw his inspiration
from the man nearest him on
the screen; in the company of
Sellers or Allen he gives a re
markably funny performance,
in many instances almost on a
par with them, but in the com
pany of Romy Schneider he
plummets to the very depths of
situation comedy — relying on
the situation itself and the ten
ets of the I Love Lucy School as
the source of comedy.
AND AS has been mentioned,
with an unoriginal plot and the
I Love Lucy School being what it
is. you can't do that and expect
to be funny. Fortunately. O'-
Toole spends a good deal of his
time with Sellers.
Paula Prentiss in the minor
role of a poet-stripper is excel
lent, especially when reciting her
poems:
"Who killed Charlie Parker?
You did, you, you rat."
THE DISPARITY in the quali
ty of the acting among the cast
and even in the same actor leads
one to the conclusion that the
director, Clive Donner, was not
performing his function. Much
of the time it seemed that the
actors had a free hand in inter
preting their respective parts
and in determining the pace of
the film.
This can be disastrous for a
film but the genius of Sellers,
Allen and at times O'Toole was
more than enough to shift the
focus from the whole of the film
to its parts. And the parts are
funny.
And in the end all that can be
said about a comedy is whether
it is funny or not, and this one
is very funny even more so the
second time through.

The picture is funny and neu
rotic but not sloppy; on the con
trary it's quite a slick, expan
sive venture. This, however, is
not evident in the plot which
bears a gruesome resemblance
to Rock Hudson-Doris Day type
films where girl wants to marry
boy but boy is not quite ready
to capitulate because of an ov
eractive libido.
THAT THE plot is a cliche
and that we can predict every
thing that happens, matters lit
tle, for we are primarily con
cerned with how it happens and
when Peter Sellers and Woody
Allen are on the screen it hap
pens funny, when Peter O'Toole
and Romy Schneider are on it
happens terrible.
Sellers and Allen use the script
as a jumping off point for their
comic imagination. Sellers cast
as the lechcrous, long-haired
psychoanalyst is hysterically
funny as he goes through his
repertoire of temper tantrums
and fits of libido (sexual assaults
in legal terminology).
ALLEN plays the little man
on the outside trying desperate
ly to get in (figuratively and lit
erally) . Chaplin is the archetype
here. Allen's constantly trying
to seduce someone — anyone,
and the portrayal of the inex
perienced seducer by itself jus
tifies going to see the picture.
In contradistinction to the
previous gentlemen Romy Sch
neider conclusively proves that
she does not understand come
dy and can not produce it. Her
concept of humor seems to de
rive from the I Love Lucy
school which, in brief, asserts
that if you run around and
scream a lot you are the essence
of Funny.
HENCE Miss Schneider runs
around and screams a lot, hence
she comes on as a high velocity,

hysterical woman which, when
you stop and think about it,
really isn't funny. Capucine in a
minor role also partakes of this
category.
PETER O'TOOLE, the man
seen most on the screen, gives
an uneven performance. He
seems to draw his inspiration
from the man nearest him on
the screen; in the company of
Sellers or Allen he gives a re
markably funny performance,
in many instances almost on a
par with them, but in the com
pany of Romy Schneider he
plummets to the very depths of
situation comedy — relying on
the situation itself and the ten
ets of the I Love Lucy School as
the source of comedy.
AND AS has been mentioned,
with an unoriginal plot and the
I Love Lucy School being what it
is. you can't do that and expect
to be funny. Fortunately. O'-
Toole spends a good deal of his
time with Sellers.
Paula Prentiss in the minor
role of a poet-stripper is excel
lent, especially when reciting her
poems:
"Who killed Charlie Parker?
You did, you, you rat."
THE DISPARITY in the quali
ty of the acting among the cast
and even in the same actor leads
one to the conclusion that the
director, Clive Donner, was not
performing his function. Much
of the time it seemed that the
actors had a free hand in inter
preting their respective parts
and in determining the pace of
the film.
This can be disastrous for a
film but the genius of Sellers,
Allen and at times O'Toole was
more than enough to shift the
focus from the whole of the film
to its parts. And the parts are
funny.
And in the end all that can be
said about a comedy is whether
it is funny or not, and this one
is very funny even more so the
second time through.
