Attention!! The Stanford dol
lies have done it again!! From
within their beauteous, talented
ranks our Lag lovelies have pro
duced Miss Wendy Winer. A tal
ented, beauteous Sarah Lawr
ence junior, Wendy really knows
how to belt a song and does it
best every Friday and Saturday
night at Shakey's Pizza Parlor
on El Camino.
Since Miss Winer is a much
sought-after young lady, this ex
clusive engagement is limited
to the weekends, 8:30 P.M. to
(usually 11:00). Accompanying
her is a honky tonk piano (that
she sits on during her act), two
banjos, and a horn ... all of the
makings of a swinging jam ses
sion . . . and when the audience
joins in, the place really rocks.
In a private interview, Miss
Winer confided in honeyed
tones ... "I think it's great . . .
it keeps getting better and bet
ter ... I know I'll keep getting
more and more out of it." We
think you will too.
P S. Sit up close.
