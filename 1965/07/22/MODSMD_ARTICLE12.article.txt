# Student Days At Stanford
## 
### 
Herbert Clark Hoover's life
time spanned the entire history
of Stanford University.
A member of Stanford's first
freshman class in 1891, he serv
ed on the University's Board of
Trustees for more than half a
century.
As a student, Hoover helped
arrange the first football con
test with the University of Cali
fornia. Nearly 20,000 spectators
saw Stanford win the now tra
ditional "Big Game" 14-10 on
March 19, 1892 in San Francisco.
HOOVER also erased a $1,200
deficit and put student govern
ment back in the black seven
months after his election as
treasurer of the Associated Stu
dents in 1894.
The Quad, in the days when
those things were done, ran
short poems about - each mem
ber of the senior class and a
caricature. Hoover already was
pictured as the shrewd Roman
politician, plotting his rise to
the Treasurer's post.
AN ORPHAN, Hoover came to
Stanford with a personal finan
cial backlog of $750 dollars. He
organized a laundry service,
newspaper route and lecture ag
ency to pay part of his expenses.
Hoover graduated with a
bachelor's degree in geology in
1895. The day before commence
ment, the University registrar
discovered Hoover had not pro
perly passed the entrance exam
ination in English. But "kindly
and understanding professors
persuaded him (the registrar) to
relax," Hoover said. "Can any
of you wonder at my devotion
to Stanford, with its Founders
and traditions for its unending
kindness?"
OF HIS academic work Hoo
ver has said he was able "to car
ry an unusual amount — for
engineers — of instruction in
history, economics and English
and French literature ... As I
recollect it, I failed in only one
course — German."
In 1928, Hoover accepted the
Republican nomination for pres
ident in a speech at Stanford
Stadium. On November 6 of that
year, he listened to the election
returns at his campus home,
now the residence of University
President J. Wallace Sterling.
