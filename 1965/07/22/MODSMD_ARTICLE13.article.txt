### 
A promising new treatment of
the commonest killer of newborn
babies was reported Monday by
physicians from Stanford Uni
versity School of Medicine.
The killer, called hyaline
membrane disease or respiratory
distress syndrome, affects 25,000
newborn babies in the United
States.
THE TREATMENT consists of
applying prolonged artificial re
spiration to these babies using
a plast'c breathing tube insert
ed into the windpipe through a
nostril. Breathing is facilitated
by a respirator which blows air
or oxygen down the windpipe in
to the lungs.
Of 19 babies treated with arti
fiical respiration, 12 survived.
Length of treatment ranged
from several hours to 28 days,
the physicians said,
