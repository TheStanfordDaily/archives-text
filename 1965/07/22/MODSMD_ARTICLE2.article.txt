V By HERBIE HINKS
Last week 3110 people took
the elevator ride to the top
V of Hoover Tower. They were
® aided by the 16 students who
V are part of the student guide
y service.
$ The service, inaugurated
$ in 1941, when Hoover Tower
| was completed, also conducts
V tours of the campus for the
X various commercial tours
V which come to campus.
Daily at 2 p.m., a typical
\ tourist may join a tour of
ffl the campus, starting at the
V entrance to the Quad. The
y tour takes about 45 minutes
X and covers most of the
y Quad, the Union, the Main
* Library, and concludes with
V a trip to the top of the tow
s «r
-y Student guides are paid
51.30 per hour and there is
\ always a long waiting list
for the job. During the
school year, there are 35 on
V the staff. The head quide, in
charge of the service, is not
A) a student, however, due to
& the dificulties in constantly
A training guides to be head
|y guide.
ft Tia Hatch, the present
(V Head Guide, is stationed in
& the main lobby of the 1100-

ver Institution and also
serves as the receptionist for v!
the Institution. On her desk I
is a red telephone, a direct \
line to the observation plat-
form. In case of emergency, V
the red telephone will be J
used to summon help. w
The office of University
Relations is responsible for ♦.
the student guide service.
Since 1941, the service has X'
nearly become self-support- {
ing, due to sales of pictures, v\
slides, and booklets about \
Hoover Tower and Stanford, $
The campus tours and ele- m
vator ride to the observation J\
tower are free. ®
On graduation day, the w
student guides took over j
-2000 people to the top of the \
tower. This is usually the -J
biggest day of the year for A
them and one of the most
hectic. The elevator holds A
only ten people at one time.
Guides are selected on a
basis of personality and A
friendliness. The job itself {
is considered an honor, mak- J.
ing up for the low pay scale. |
Several of the guides are '
bilingual and between them i
they speak enough languages y
to keep all of the visitors X
happy.
