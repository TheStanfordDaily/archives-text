They announce the unhappy
hour in the early morning and
ring out the Stanford Hymn at
six every evening.
The $100,000 dollar Belgian
Carillon at the top of the Hoover
library is the largest in the Un
' ited States. Completed in 1938,
the collection of 35 chimes is
, considered one of the most
nearly perfect in existence.
IN 1940, when Franklin Dela
no Roosevelt and Wendell Wil
kie were campaigning for the
Presidency, when the Indians
were on their way to an unde
-1 feated season and a 21-13 vic
tory over Nebraska in the Rose
Bowl, the carillon was still in
the tower of the Belgian Pavil
ion at the New York World's
Fair.
It arrived on campus on the
Bth of January, 1941. When fin
ally disengaged from the 27
crates in which the bells had
been boated from New York,
Kamiele Lefevere, carilloneur of
the Riverside Church in New
York City arrived to supervise
its installment.
INSTALLING the 10-ton car
illon took nearly a month, but
on June 1, it was played for the
dedication ceremonies.
The bells were a gift from the
Belgian people to Herbert Hoo
ver, whose relief work in Europe
during the first World War was
still vividly remembered.
The carillon operates electri

cally, but on special occasions,
Prof. James Angell of the Elec
trical Engineering Department
plays it.
