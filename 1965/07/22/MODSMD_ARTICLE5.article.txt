I The "Degree of Uncommon
Man" was conferred at a cere
monial Stanford dinner in San
Francisco last Thursday on the
| late Herbert Hoover. The degree
J was inspired by Mr. Hoover's
own words.
Allan Hoover, son of the 31st
| President of the United States,
; received the award before more
I than 200 members of Stanford
Associates and their friends at
the Mark Hopkins Hotel.
The Associates, an organiza
tion founded by a small group
of Stanford supporters in 1934
J and now numbering nearly 600,
! created the degree in 1953 to
J honor those who have given
unique and outstanding service
| to Stanford. The University does
! not grant honorary degrees.
! THF ASSOCIATES' degree ac
! quired its name from one of the
: most widely quoted statements
ever made by the former Presi
dent. Rejecting the popular "cult
of the Commn Man," Mr. Hoo
ver said
". . . most people are holding
fast to an essential fact in Am
erican life. We believe in equal
; opportunity for all, but we know
j that this includes the opportun
j ity to rise in leadership — in
other words, to be uncommon."
In the 12 years since the de
[ gree was initiated, it has been
awarded only four times: in
: 1953 to Paul Edwards, longtime
president of Stanford's Board of
Trustees: in 1954 jointly to Lou
Roseberry and Morgan Gunst
for significant help in organiz
j ing Stanford fund-raising pro
i grams ;in 1957 to Dr. Harry
| Reynolds, a prime mover in
founding the Associates; and in
j 1959 posthumously to Lloyd Din
kelspie!, Stanford Board of Trus
tees president and outstanding
friend of the University.
STANFORD President Wallace

ter of other speakers reviewed
i Mr. Hoover's long and varied
services to the University, which
