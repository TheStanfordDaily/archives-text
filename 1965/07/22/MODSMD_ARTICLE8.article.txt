# Hoover: A Great Lifetime With The University
## His Institute For Peace 
### 
Dedicated in 1941, Stanford's
fiftieth year, the Hoover Insti
tute on War, Revolution, and
Peace *s perhaps as famous as
the unique collections it con
tains.
On the ground floor of Hoover
Tower is the Lou Henry Hoover
Room. It contains some of the
memorabilia and honors once
held by Mrs. Hoover.
MAIN OFFICES, with the on
ly large window, are on the
eleventh floor. The four wood
paneled corner offices are occu
pied by the Director, his Execu
tive Assistant, Director Emeritus
Ralph H. Lutz, and the Assist
ant Director.
Mr. Hoover used the office now
occupied by the Executive As
sistant on his summer visits to
Stanford.
Fourteen floors of stacks are
found between floors three and
nine. They are labeled 3, 3M, 4,
4M, etc., the "M" presumably
denoting mezzanine.
STACKS are accessible only
by the staff elevator. The main
elevator does not stop between
floors one and ten.
Staff are not the only occu
pants of the building. The four
appendages just below the
dome are homes for owls and
other birds. The turrets are
called "elephant towers" by the
staff because of their similarity
to buildings in Asia.
A cluster of four outdoor
lights is always lit in the cupola
atop the dome, at the request of
nearby Moffett Field. The lights
are protected from birds by a
wire mesh.
