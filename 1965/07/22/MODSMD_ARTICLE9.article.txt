### PELL FENDER 
Not far from Stanford, over
on Willow Road near Bayshore
Freeway, is the Menlo Park Di
vision of the Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital; a neu
ropsychiatrist hospital.
For the past two years, during
regular Stanford session, Stan
ford students have attended
parties on various wards (in
particular, Wards 10 and 15).
This summer Stanford students
Dave Thurman, Tom Miller,
Bruce Finstead, Ellen Busher,
Mike Beard, Vicky Knapp, Nan
cy Strack, Judy Werner and Pell
Fender.
THESE PARTIES are the fo
cal point of the week for most
of the men. Social contacts with
young people, otherwise totally
lacking, is provided: contacts of
the nature of those instrumental
to adjustment in the outer
world upon discharge.
A small number of more ex
perienced volunteers, for in
stance, visit Ward 10 on Mon
day nights. Ward 10 is a "closed"
ward with acutely ill patients
and, in comparison with Ward
15, experiences minimal outside
contacts. Unfortunately few vol
unteers have been able to at
tend the Monday night sessions
on Ward 10.
WARD 15 is a progressive
ward, having instituted a re
ward program in which the men
(about 125, mostly chronic
schizophrenics) achieve, upon
attendance of occupational ther
apy assignments and comple
tion of other weekly duties, in

creased weekly allowances and
pass privileges. In addition,
group (numbering from 125 to
six men) and individual thera
py occur daily with a psychia
trist, a psychologist, a social
worker, two psychology trainees
and a full-time volunteer. This
summer a small group of Stan
ford students has tried to keep
the Wednesday night parties on
this ward functioning,
MANY OF the men in institu
tions ,in spite of varied activi
ties, therapeutic sessions, and
other stimuli, gradually lose con
tact with, and thus interest in,
the outside world. They have be
come acclimatized to a mini
mally anxious subculture and
as a result, are content. This
trend is impeded by the invalu
abe contacts provided by Stan
ford students.
The Wednesday night parties
arc mere than mere cookie
pushing socials: they have led
to relationships simply conver
sational to relationships intense
in their therapeutic value. Due
to the progressive nature of the
ward staff these relationships
are encouraged.
THIS SUMMER students in
terested in attending the Ward
15 parties are asked to meet be
hind the bookstore, Wednesday
evenings, at 7:15 p.m. Rides are
provided but those with cars
are urged to bring them.
Dr. Biockhoff, Ward 10, psy
chologist, urges those interested
in working with more with
drawn patients to contact her
at 326-5600, ext. 232.
