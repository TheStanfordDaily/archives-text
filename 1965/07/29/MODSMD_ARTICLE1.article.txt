# SCPV Will Keep Protesting
## 
### 
For the past three Saturdays
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam has demon
strated against war, twice at
Town and Country Shopping
Center and once at the Stanford
Shopping Center. Attracting
from 50 to 75 people, the Com
mittee holds its "continuing ser
ies" of demonstrations "to ac
quaint the public with broad,
responsible, and we hope en
lightened opposition to the Ad
ministration's mess in Vietnam."
Students, faculty, and townspeo
ple have taken part.
"The media are generally sell
ing the war," says David Ran
som, organizer of the demonstra
tions, "and Congress has shut
up about it. Consequently, the
third of the nation which the
polls show definitely against the
war has essentially no voice. Our
demonstrations are an admit
tedly limited attempt to give
voice to the otherwise unrepre
sented opposition."
The demonstrators say they

have encountered the whole
sprectrum of antagonism and
agreement. "Some call us com
munists; some join our ranks."
They were counter - picketed
briefly two weeks ago by boys
whose signs read "Kill More
Reds in Vietnam."
The Committee, which grew
out of student and faculty
groups at the end of spring, has
also held two noon rallies in
White Plaza and plans more. At
their most recent rally profes
sors Charles Drekmeier (Politi
cal Science) and Albert Guerard
(English) and students Bob
Haas, John Matthias, and Steve
Morris discussed "The New War
and the Call-Up." "Time Maga
zine had declared war," says
Ransom, "and we thought we'd
talk it over."
At the rally Professor Guerard
charged that "those who rec
ommended escalation lack the
courage to admit they made a
mistake." He suggested that "no
thing will be lost and something

will be gained (a modicum of in
tegrity) if we speak of the war
as what it is: a war to contain
communism; a war to prevent
any shrinkage of American pow
er; a war to prove, again, that
might makes right. But not a
war concerned with freedom."
Other activities of the Com
mittee include a lunch-hour ta
ble at the Union and precinct
work with a Palo Alto group call
ed Concerned Citizens, emanat
ing from the Union on Sunday
afternoons. A faculty group not
formally connected with the
Committee is planning to buy
spot time on radio, again to ac
quaint the public with the ex
istence of oposition, and the
SCPV has subcommittees engag
ed in researching ways to per
suade the press to increase and
liberalize their coverage of the
war.
"Vietnam is just a symptom
of the American malaise," says
Keith Lowe, member of the
SCPV steering committee. "Na

tionally that means an entire
re-examination of our social
structure. Internationally Viet
nam is the most dramatic of an
indefinite series of struggles by
Third World countries for their
economic independence."
The Committee forsees a long
term program to "awaken stu
dents to their a-historical edu
cation." "Our aim." says Lowe,
"is to politically involve every
member of the University
The SCPV is planning a broad
program for the autumn, which
will include such things as a
speaker series on neo-Colonial
ism as well as increased opposi
tion to the war. They expect
that when school reconvenes in
the fall organized campus op
position to the war will increase
greatly. "That they may have to
go," they say, "is forcing many
to take a stand." Furthermore,
the great increase of student
political activity in the past year
will have excited many of the
students, "and all we will have to

do is show them the importance
and validity of what we are do
ing."
The Committee plans to take
part in a rally to be held by
the Palo Alto Concerned Citizens
on August 14 in Cogswell Park
and in a "Congress of Unrepre
sented Peoples" to be held by
the Berkeley Vietnam Day Com
mittee on August 21 in Oakland.
The Berkeley group, which put
on a two-day teach-in during
the spring, has sent airline tic
kets to the representative in
their congressional district and
means to demand that he an
swer certain questions about the
war if he comes.
"The essentially lack of re
presentation in Congress of
about a third of the country,"
says Ransom, "has led to very
real and serious discussion of the
possibility of a third party,
bringing together peace and ci
vil rights groups, the poor, per
haps elements of labor and agri
culture."

and validity of what we are do
ing."
The Committee plans to take
part in a rally to be held by
the Palo Alto Concerned Citizens
on August 14 in Cogswell Park
and in a "Congress of Unrepre
sented Peoples" to be held by
the Berkeley Vietnam Day Com
mittee on August 21 in Oakland.
The Berkeley group, which put
on a two-day teach-in during
the spring, has sent airline tic
kets to the representative in
their congressional district and
means to demand that he an
swer certain questions about the
war if he comes.
"The essentially lack of re
presentation in Congress of
about a third of the country,"
says Ransom, "has led to very
real and serious discussion of the
possibility of a third party,
bringing together peace and ci
vil rights groups, the poor, per
haps elements of labor and agri
culture."
For the past three Saturdays
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam has demon
strated against war, twice at
Town and Country Shopping
Center and once at the Stanford
Shopping Center. Attracting
from 50 to 75 people, the Com
mittee holds its "continuing ser
ies" of demonstrations "to ac
quaint the public with broad,
responsible, and we hope en
lightened opposition to the Ad
ministration's mess in Vietnam."
Students, faculty, and townspeo
ple have taken part.
"The media are generally sell
ing the war," says David Ran
som, organizer of the demonstra
tions, "and Congress has shut
up about it. Consequently, the
third of the nation which the
polls show definitely against the
war has essentially no voice. Our
demonstrations are an admit
tedly limited attempt to give
voice to the otherwise unrepre
sented opposition."
The demonstrators say they

have encountered the whole
sprectrum of antagonism and
agreement. "Some call us com
munists; some join our ranks."
They were counter - picketed
briefly two weeks ago by boys
whose signs read "Kill More
Reds in Vietnam."
The Committee, which grew
out of student and faculty
groups at the end of spring, has
also held two noon rallies in
White Plaza and plans more. At
their most recent rally profes
sors Charles Drekmeier (Politi
cal Science) and Albert Guerard
(English) and students Bob
Haas, John Matthias, and Steve
Morris discussed "The New War
and the Call-Up." "Time Maga
zine had declared war," says
Ransom, "and we thought we'd
talk it over."
At the rally Professor Guerard
charged that "those who rec
ommended escalation lack the
courage to admit they made a
mistake." He suggested that "no
thing will be lost and something

will be gained (a modicum of in
tegrity) if we speak of the war
as what it is: a war to contain
communism; a war to prevent
any shrinkage of American pow
er; a war to prove, again, that
might makes right. But not a
war concerned with freedom."
Other activities of the Com
mittee include a lunch-hour ta
ble at the Union and precinct
work with a Palo Alto group call
ed Concerned Citizens, emanat
ing from the Union on Sunday
afternoons. A faculty group not
formally connected with the
Committee is planning to buy
spot time on radio, again to ac
quaint the public with the ex
istence of oposition, and the
SCPV has subcommittees engag
ed in researching ways to per
suade the press to increase and
liberalize their coverage of the
war.
"Vietnam is just a symptom
of the American malaise," says
Keith Lowe, member of the
SCPV steering committee. "Na

tionally that means an entire
re-examination of our social
structure. Internationally Viet
nam is the most dramatic of an
indefinite series of struggles by
Third World countries for their
economic independence."
The Committee forsees a long
term program to "awaken stu
dents to their a-historical edu
cation." "Our aim." says Lowe,
"is to politically involve every
member of the University
The SCPV is planning a broad
program for the autumn, which
will include such things as a
speaker series on neo-Colonial
ism as well as increased opposi
tion to the war. They expect
that when school reconvenes in
the fall organized campus op
position to the war will increase
greatly. "That they may have to
go," they say, "is forcing many
to take a stand." Furthermore,
the great increase of student
political activity in the past year
will have excited many of the

The SCPV is planning a broad
program for the autumn, which

greatly. "That they may have to

the great increase of student

will have excited many of the

and validity of what we are do
ing."
The Committee plans to take
part in a rally to be held by
the Palo Alto Concerned Citizens
on August 14 in Cogswell Park
and in a "Congress of Unrepre
sented Peoples" to be held by
the Berkeley Vietnam Day Com
mittee on August 21 in Oakland.
The Berkeley group, which put
on a two-day teach-in during
the spring, has sent airline tic
kets to the representative in
their congressional district and
means to demand that he an
swer certain questions about the
war if he comes.
"The essentially lack of re
presentation in Congress of
about a third of the country,"
says Ransom, "has led to very
real and serious discussion of the
possibility of a third party,
bringing together peace and ci
vil rights groups, the poor, per
haps elements of labor and agri
culture."
For the past three Saturdays
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam has demon
strated against war, twice at
Town and Country Shopping
Center and once at the Stanford
Shopping Center. Attracting
from 50 to 75 people, the Com
mittee holds its "continuing ser
ies" of demonstrations "to ac
quaint the public with broad,
responsible, and we hope en
lightened opposition to the Ad
ministration's mess in Vietnam."
Students, faculty, and townspeo
ple have taken part.
"The media are generally sell
ing the war," says David Ran
som, organizer of the demonstra
tions, "and Congress has shut
up about it. Consequently, the
third of the nation which the
polls show definitely against the
war has essentially no voice. Our
demonstrations are an admit
tedly limited attempt to give
voice to the otherwise unrepre
sented opposition."
The demonstrators say they

have encountered the whole
sprectrum of antagonism and
agreement. "Some call us com
munists; some join our ranks."
They were counter - picketed
briefly two weeks ago by boys
whose signs read "Kill More
Reds in Vietnam."
The Committee, which grew
out of student and faculty
groups at the end of spring, has
also held two noon rallies in
White Plaza and plans more. At
their most recent rally profes
sors Charles Drekmeier (Politi
cal Science) and Albert Guerard
(English) and students Bob
Haas, John Matthias, and Steve
Morris discussed "The New War
and the Call-Up." "Time Maga
zine had declared war," says
Ransom, "and we thought we'd
talk it over."
At the rally Professor Guerard
charged that "those who rec
ommended escalation lack the
courage to admit they made a
mistake." He suggested that "no
thing will be lost and something

will be gained (a modicum of in
tegrity) if we speak of the war
as what it is: a war to contain
communism; a war to prevent
any shrinkage of American pow
er; a war to prove, again, that
might makes right. But not a
war concerned with freedom."
Other activities of the Com
mittee include a lunch-hour ta
ble at the Union and precinct
work with a Palo Alto group call
ed Concerned Citizens, emanat
ing from the Union on Sunday
afternoons. A faculty group not
formally connected with the
Committee is planning to buy
spot time on radio, again to ac
quaint the public with the ex
istence of oposition, and the
SCPV has subcommittees engag
ed in researching ways to per
suade the press to increase and
liberalize their coverage of the
war.
"Vietnam is just a symptom
of the American malaise," says
Keith Lowe, member of the
SCPV steering committee. "Na

tionally that means an entire
re-examination of our social
structure. Internationally Viet
nam is the most dramatic of an
indefinite series of struggles by
