SACRIFICE — These two
idle, sensuous creatures
were slaughtered yesterday

at midnight. Long have the
beauties of the flesh, the so
phistications of the world,

the vanities of the devil
been held in rather too high
an esteem at Stanford. The
light hair and sweet smile
of those trying vainly to
achieve a never held inno
cence are to be destroyed!
Make way for the true
grandeur of the Stanford
Summer Weekly Queen, ap
pearing next week.
