# New Teacher Training Suggested
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D C. — Twen
ty-eight per cent of America's
qualified teachers aren't actu
ally teaching, Prof. Norman Boy
an of Stanford's School of Ed
ucation told the President's
White House Conference on Ed
ucation.
This may well be one of the
answers to the country's chro
nic teacher shortage, he noted
in a background paper prepared
for the gathering, which drew
some 200 of the nation's leading
educators to the capital Tuesday
and Wednesday (July 20-21).
THE SITUATION Is a "fasci
nating but systematically ig
nored" phase of teacher supply
and demand, he said.
"If schools and school systems
devise imaginative personnel ar
rangements which draw on
these reserve talents," he wrote,
"the total number of new teach
ers required each year for both
incremental and replacement
needs might shift drastically."

"Most teacher preparation
programs," Prof. Boyan observ
ed, "tend to perpetuate teaching
as a part-time occupation. The
programs ask little or no invest
ment in preparation beyond that
required for the baccalaureate
degree.
"THEY ENCOURAGE the 'in
surance program' of many stu
dents, particularly women. Com
parisons with other occupations
suggest that longer preparation
programs, which cost the indi
vidual more in time, energy, and
money, tend to elicit more occu
pational commitment and long
er occupational tenure."
The crucial issue of teacher
preparation, Prof. Boyan empha
sized, is the appropriate educa
tion and training of supervisors
of initial teaching practice.
"Conditions for optimum ini
tial practice rarely match the
value placed on the importance
of practice by all parties to the
enterprise," he said,
