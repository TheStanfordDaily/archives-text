STANFORD — Ralph J. Smith,
Stanford professor of electrical
engineering and associate exec
utive head of the department, left
for Viet Nam Friday, July 23, on a
dual mission.
Primarily, he will serve on an
Agency for International Develop
ment assignment to help reorgan
ize the curriculum at the National
Technological Institute in Saigon
with three other engineering edu
cators from UCLA.
Secondarily, he will secure first
hand material for a "little AID"
of his own — a new course he will
teach at Stanford next September,
titled "Resource Strategy."
"This course is designed express

ly for Stanford Prof.
Smith said ."because of their in
tense and continuing interest in
the solving of human problems as
well as technical ones. We will try
to learn how to share our technical
knowledge for the benefit of the
developing countries."
"Our job in Saigon," he ex
plained, "will be to help the fac
ulty at the National Technological
Institute assess the country's needs
and to plan an appropriate curric
ulum.
"We will help our counterparts
there to decide what kind of eng
ineers they want to develop, what
subjects to teach and where to get
the faculty for it."
