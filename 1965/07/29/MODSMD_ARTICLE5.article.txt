# 'L'Isola dei Pazzi' Opens In American Premiere
## 
### 
The game off blind man's
bluff, jealousy, and a number of
funny antics in a colony of mad
men provide the story of E. R.
Duni's opera farce, "L'lsola del
Pazzi" (Isle of Fools), which op
ened last night at Stanford in its
American premiere. There will
be two more performances, to
night and tomorrow night, at
8:30 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
Musical scholars credit Duni's
composing style, and "Isle of
Fools" specifically, as the begin
ning of the French opera co
mique tradition. The Duni work
was a marked departure from
the grand opera style of con
tinuous arias and recitatives.
"Isle of Fools" is musically simi
lar to operetta and modern mus
ical comedy in that dialogue is
often inserted between the op
era's musical passages.
PIETRO BOTTAZZO plays the
new governor of the island in
charge of the cages full of mad
men and women. As the opera
opens the governor interviews

his wards.
Leading Italian baritone Re
nato Capecchi sings the role of
Sordidone, the miserly madman;
Renato Ercolani is Spezzaferro,
self-proclaimed terror of the
world; and Claudio Strudthoff
is the maligned Malgoverno.
The merry madwoman Gar
batta and proud madwoman
Glorioso are played by Renata
Ongaro and Annette Mizne.
While these two vie for the love
of the governor, he falls in love
with Semplicina, the bashful
madwoman, sung by Emilia Cun
dari.
DUNI was an Italian who
spent most of his composing
years in France. Though his
command of the French langu
age reportedly was never very
good, he is marked by history as
one of the most gifted compos
ers ever to write music for the
French tongue.
His "Isle of Fools" was first
performed in the Jaris Italian
Theater in 1761.
During the Stanford Festival
the Opera da Camera also has
staged two Pergolasi one-act
operas ,and Mozart's "Cosi fan
Tutte."
Also on stage this week dur
ing the 19b5 Stanford Summer
comedies staged by the Univer-
Festival are two 18th century
sity's Baroque Comedy Work
shop with members of San Fran
cisco's "The Committee" in lead
ing roles. Alternating nightly
on the Memorial Auditorium
stage are Richard Sheridan's
Turandot" and Carlo Gozzi's
"The Critic."
More opera is scheduled for
the final two weeks of the Fes
tival when the New York City
Opera makes its West Coast de
but with 14 performances in
English of three Mozart operas,

men provide the story of E. R.
Duni's opera farce, "L'lsola del
Pazzi" (Isle of Fools), which op
ened last night at Stanford in its
American premiere. There will
be two more performances, to
night and tomorrow night, at
8:30 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
Musical scholars credit Duni's
composing style, and "Isle of
Fools" specifically, as the begin
ning of the French opera co
mique tradition. The Duni work
was a marked departure from
the grand opera style of con
tinuous arias and recitatives.
"Isle of Fools" is musically simi
lar to operetta and modern mus
ical comedy in that dialogue is
often inserted between the op
era's musical passages.
PIETRO BOTTAZZO plays the
new governor of the island in
charge of the cages full of mad
men and women. As the opera
opens the governor interviews

his wards.
Leading Italian baritone Re
nato Capecchi sings the role of
Sordidone, the miserly madman;
Renato Ercolani is Spezzaferro,
self-proclaimed terror of the
world; and Claudio Strudthoff
is the maligned Malgoverno.
The merry madwoman Gar
batta and proud madwoman
Glorioso are played by Renata
Ongaro and Annette Mizne.
While these two vie for the love
of the governor, he falls in love
with Semplicina, the bashful
madwoman, sung by Emilia Cun
dari.
DUNI was an Italian who
spent most of his composing
years in France. Though his
command of the French langu
age reportedly was never very
good, he is marked by history as
one of the most gifted compos
ers ever to write music for the
French tongue.
His "Isle of Fools" was first
performed in the Jaris Italian
Theater in 1761.
During the Stanford Festival
the Opera da Camera also has
staged two Pergolasi one-act
operas ,and Mozart's "Cosi fan
Tutte."
Also on stage this week dur
ing the 19b5 Stanford Summer
comedies staged by the Univer-
Festival are two 18th century
sity's Baroque Comedy Work
shop with members of San Fran
cisco's "The Committee" in lead
ing roles. Alternating nightly
on the Memorial Auditorium
stage are Richard Sheridan's
Turandot" and Carlo Gozzi's
"The Critic."
More opera is scheduled for
the final two weeks of the Fes
tival when the New York City
Opera makes its West Coast de
but with 14 performances in
English of three Mozart operas,
"The Marriage of Figaro," "Ad
duction from the Seraglio," and
"Don Giovanni."
The game off blind man's
bluff, jealousy, and a number of
funny antics in a colony of mad
men provide the story of E. R.
