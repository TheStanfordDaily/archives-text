# 'Love A La Carte': Gooey, Melting

### SUE BRIGGS 
LOVE A LA CARTE filmed in
black and white (for no justifi
able reason) demonstrates that
haphazard ordering can result
in ineffective combinations.
We learn at the beginning that
Roman brothels are being clos
ed. "Just think," says the Ma
dam in a farewell speech to her
girls, "You'll be scattered all ov
er the world. Some of you may
even go bad."
Thus forewarned we see ag
ing Simone Signoret and three
younger colleagues seeking boss
free enterprise. They convert a
farmhouse into a restaurant.
Simone manages, the others
quarrel. Simone mis-manages,
bankruptcy threatens. Can this
business be saved? Enter Ercoli,
businessman. He offers. They ac
cept. Boss Ercoli decrees a
month's moratorium on up
stairs clientele so that legitimate
downstairs business can be es
tablished. During the month,
the girls are not idle. Besides
the cooking, one acquires a sui
tor (of whom she is fond); one
fetches her small son (of whom
she is pathologically fond); and
Simone loves car salesman Mas
trionni (of whom she is not
fond). Conflict established, the
month ends. Enter Ercoli with
two upstairs customers.* Girls
reluctant, Ercoli adamant. Girls
furious. Ercoli then exposed by
Simone before downstairs cus
tomers. Ercoli embarrassed, but
girls jailed. Once released they
vent their wrath upon Ercoli —
hence restaurant - wrecking
binge the cathartic effect of
which is underlined by quick
transition to the final scene.
The movie aims at exposing
the inevitability of its own end
ing by pointing out that hope for
salvation is futile. There can be
no marriage, religion, or securi
ty. The past has thrown up bar
riers to normal relationships and
planted a masochistic fatalism
within the girls themselves.
There are moments when these
themes emerge vividly, but these
moments are too few, too unre
lated, like finely cooked bits of
beef in an otherwise mediocre

stew. There is the baptism of
the small boy — a part of his
mother's abortive attempt to
embrace religion. He refuses the
communion wafer. "It's sugar,"
urges his mother. The boy takes
it, then with a wise look and a
minimum of disillusionment says
softly, "It isn't sugar."
Although each scene has some
meaning for the observes, i.e.,
"It's really a rotten world, isn't
it?" little comes through as real
reasons for the characters' ac
tions. It seems a matter of coin
cidence and small importance
that these people are together
in the same film. The point of
view is badly spliced and the
film never becomes even as
great as the sum of its parts. It
therefore fails as a vehicle of
feeling or idea. The plot merely
drags unevenly toward the ex
pected ending — stopping here
for bland slapstick, there for a
bit of pathos.
Satiated with the film's bits
and pieces presentation we con
template Simone in the rain
hurling her epitaph ("Bas
tard!") at the auto which does
not pick her up — and it is dif
ficult to feel particularly sorry
for her.

for bland slapstick, there for a
bit of pathos.
Satiated with the film's bits
and pieces presentation we con
template Simone in the rain
hurling her epitaph ("Bas
tard!") at the auto which does
not pick her up — and it is dif
ficult to feel particularly sorry
for her.
LOVE A LA CARTE filmed in
black and white (for no justifi
able reason) demonstrates that
haphazard ordering can result
in ineffective combinations.
We learn at the beginning that
Roman brothels are being clos
ed. "Just think," says the Ma
dam in a farewell speech to her
girls, "You'll be scattered all ov
er the world. Some of you may
even go bad."
Thus forewarned we see ag
ing Simone Signoret and three
younger colleagues seeking boss
free enterprise. They convert a
farmhouse into a restaurant.
Simone manages, the others
quarrel. Simone mis-manages,
bankruptcy threatens. Can this
business be saved? Enter Ercoli,
businessman. He offers. They ac
cept. Boss Ercoli decrees a
month's moratorium on up
stairs clientele so that legitimate
downstairs business can be es
tablished. During the month,
the girls are not idle. Besides
the cooking, one acquires a sui
tor (of whom she is fond); one
fetches her small son (of whom
she is pathologically fond); and
Simone loves car salesman Mas
trionni (of whom she is not
fond). Conflict established, the
month ends. Enter Ercoli with
two upstairs customers.* Girls
reluctant, Ercoli adamant. Girls
furious. Ercoli then exposed by
Simone before downstairs cus
tomers. Ercoli embarrassed, but
girls jailed. Once released they
vent their wrath upon Ercoli —
hence restaurant - wrecking
binge the cathartic effect of
which is underlined by quick
transition to the final scene.
The movie aims at exposing
the inevitability of its own end
ing by pointing out that hope for
salvation is futile. There can be
no marriage, religion, or securi
ty. The past has thrown up bar
riers to normal relationships and
planted a masochistic fatalism
within the girls themselves.
There are moments when these
themes emerge vividly, but these
moments are too few, too unre
lated, like finely cooked bits of
beef in an otherwise mediocre

stew. There is the baptism of
the small boy — a part of his
mother's abortive attempt to
embrace religion. He refuses the
communion wafer. "It's sugar,"
urges his mother. The boy takes
it, then with a wise look and a
minimum of disillusionment says
softly, "It isn't sugar."
Although each scene has some
meaning for the observes, i.e.,
"It's really a rotten world, isn't
it?" little comes through as real
reasons for the characters' ac
tions. It seems a matter of coin
cidence and small importance
that these people are together
in the same film. The point of
view is badly spliced and the
film never becomes even as
great as the sum of its parts. It
therefore fails as a vehicle of
feeling or idea. The plot merely
drags unevenly toward the ex
pected ending — stopping here
for bland slapstick, there for a
bit of pathos.
