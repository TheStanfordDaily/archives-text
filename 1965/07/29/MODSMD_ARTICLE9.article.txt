Gentlemen:
I wish to take exception to the
following statement which ap
peared in Thursday's "How Tow
Edition" of the Summer Weekly.
The $100,000 dollar (sic) Belgian
Carillon at the top of the Hoover
library is the largest in the United
States." Compare the following ex
tract from the 1965 edition of the
Encyclopaedia Britannica:
"The largest modern carillons
(presumably in the world) are
those at Riverside church, New
York City, and at the Rockefeller
Chapel, The Uinversity of Chica
go, each of 72 bells." (Vol. IV
page 915.)
Your statement may be correct
only if you mean the largest Bel
gian carillon in the United States.
Since that is an unlikely statistic
to bother quoting, your statement
seems to me to be rather mislead
ing.
I am also inclined to disagree
with the statement that . . the
collection of 35 chimes is consid
ered one of the most nearly perfect
in existence," but I suppose that
you are entitled to your opinion.
Yours faithfully,
David K. Jordan, Dept. of Asian
Languages.
