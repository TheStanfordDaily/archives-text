i the afternoon of March 2,
n Thomson, a young poet, sat
n at the Bancroft Strip
ling a small card bearing a
ise intending (he explained)
protest against the war in
. Nam. About an hour later
was arrested by a Campus
ceman.
t that time the Campus was
a state of amicable bustle,
tical groups were sharing
ir place in the sun with fra
lities. The Campus reacted
any healthy academic com
mity — with vigorous dlscus
i. Are the obscenity laws too
ct? Too lax? Out of date?
r'HAT had John Thomson's
l to do with Viet Nam? All
is of the incident were dls
sed during the ensuing days
formal rallies, and after the
>n hour "a dozen heated little
ates broke out among the
dents who had participated"
F. Chronicle). Tabu words
e used and eight more ar
ts were made.
t must be emphasized that at
s stage the Campus was in
special state of uproar; ar
ts have been an occupational
sard of students since me
eval times. The uproar came
m off campus. The resent
nts which had built up in
► State of California against
> FSM had found a scapegoat.
Jy Tuesday of the following
?k, the President and the
ancellor had resigned. On
turday, the full Board of Re
lts — including Brown, An
:son, and Unruh — met in
ergency session.
3N THE following Wednes
y (March 17) charges against
it students — Dave Bills, Art
>ldberg, Mike Klein and Nlch
is Zvegintzov — were filed by
e Dean of Meno with the "Ad
►c Committee on Student
nduct."
Because of the grave sanc
>ns implicitly threatened
ainst the defendants and
ainst the prosecuting Unlver
y, the proceedings of this
>mmittee never obtained a
1m objectivity. The students
arged "railroading"; the Com
ittee countercharged obstruc
>n. Defendants and Committee
changed angry accusuations
insulting behavior.
UNIVERSITY Counsel played
e role of prosecuting D.A. The
rial sentences were unprece
>ntly harsh — three suspen-
Dns, one expulsion.
The students will go before the
jperior Court of Alameda
aunty or before the Federal
istrict Court and ask for an
•der requiring the University
ther to stay the sentences
inding a re-hearing or to void
ve sentences entirely.
The students will argue that
\e University, as an agency of
xe State, is subject to all the
rovisions of the US. Const 1 tu
on.
