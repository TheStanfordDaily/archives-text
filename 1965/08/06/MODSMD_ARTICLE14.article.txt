# Ciro Still Dancing In Palo Alto
## 
### PATRICK THOMAS 
If you haven't been to The
Tangeant in Palo Alto recently,
this week is your last chance to
catch an exceptional show.
Held over for the third week
end in a row is Ciro's Flamencos,
with Rosa Montoya. Ciro's troupe
is rated as one of the best in
the world, and has played the
best theaters in New York, Lon
don, Paris, Madrid, and other
major cities.
The five members of Ciro's
Flamencos create a variety of
moods during the performance,
ranging from the melodious solo
guitar work of Paco Juanas to
the intense dancing and sing
ing of Rosa Montoya and Ciro.
Ciro was born the son of one
of Spain's wealthiest families,
and was expected to be any
thing but a Flamenco dancer.
At his parents' insistence he at
tended the top schools in Spain
and went on to obtain a law
degree.
All this time, however, Ciro
was secretly practicing his dan
cing. He formed a group at col
lege, and after only two years
of part-time practice they were
named the top amateur Fla
menco group in Spain.
Then, at the age of 23, Ciro
walked out of his father's house
with eleven dollars in his pocket
and headed for Madrid. Here he
studied with the most famous
teachers in Spain, and now, six
years later, has become one of
the most famous dancers in the
world.
"My father," says Ciro, "still
wants me to quit 'all this foolish
show business.' He thinks I can
become a great lawyer. Me, I
don't think so. I don't even look
like a lawyer."
Off stage, Ciro is very friendly
and talkative, and enjoys a re
laxed conversation about what
ever subject may come up. But
once he begins to dance, his face
becames stern and he appears
to be conscious of nothing but
the movement of his feet and
the sound of the guitar behind
him.
Rosa Montoya is the grand
niece of world famous Spanish
guitarist Ramon Montoya, con
sidered to be the father of mo
dern Flamenco guitar. She was
discovered as a teenager, danc
ing barefoot in Gypsy caves.
Since birth she had been train
ed for Flamenco.
For those who have long ad
mired Flamenco, this Is a chance
to see one of the world's top
groups within walking distance
of the campus. And if Flamenco
is an unexplored field of music
for you, Ciro and his compan
ions can offer you an exciting
and expert introduction.

with eleven dollars in his pocket
and headed for Madrid. Here he

the most famous dancers in the
world.
"My father," says Ciro, "still
wants me to quit 'all this foolish
show business.' He thinks I can
become a great lawyer. Me, I
don't think so. I don't even look
like a lawyer."
Off stage, Ciro is very friendly
and talkative, and enjoys a re
laxed conversation about what
ever subject may come up. But
once he begins to dance, his face
becames stern and he appears
to be conscious of nothing but
the movement of his feet and
the sound of the guitar behind
him.
