# Spaught Lists The Ideals Of Top Management
## 
### 
The best manager is one who
has excelled in some non-man
agerial discipline, Monroe E.
Spaught declares in the current
Stanford Graduate School of
Business Bulletin.
Recently named managing di
rector of the Royal Duth Shell
Companies and a former Stan
ford trustee, Spaght describes
formal instruction in manage
ment as "useful."
But he adds: "Unlike law or
chemistry, which are based on
masses of fact and data, man
aging is relatively more an art
and less a science.
"Granted that instruction in
managing may be able to supply
the science part of it, a great
measure of the talents that
make a good manager must ei
ther be born in him or acquired
in other than classroom instruc
tion.
"Thus, the manager is more
an artist or a musician than he
is an analytical chemist or a
writer of contracts . .
Personal drive is first among
the qualities of a top manager,
Spaght continues. "The man
who does anything best is the
man who has the drive, the will
to succeed, the urge to excel.
"In America, we are all free
to seek personal aggrandize
ment; call it pursuit of success,
or money, or fame, or status.
The freedom to get ahead, to
improve one's lot, to enjoy the
fruits of one's labors is guaran
teed under our constitution, and
that guarantee is as valid today,
in large measure, at least, as
when the county was founded."
The lack of hampering tradi
tions, including those in busi
ness itself, is another ingredient
in the American success formula,
he adds: "There is little incen
tive to do your best, to increase
efficiency, or to boost output, if
your share of the market is de
fined as 17 per cent of some
thing, willy-nilly."
The third essential ingredient
in the American formula is mass
education, Spaght says."It
would be hard to over-estimate
the role of well-nigh universal
literacy and the American tra
dition of higher education for
all who want it in shaping our
industrial superiority.
"Mass education, with every
one educated to the limit of his
abilities, is the real basis of 'The
American Dream'. Certainly we
aren't doing a perfect job but
our society does recognize that
this basic key makes America
great."

man who has the drive, the will
to succeed, the urge to excel.
"In America, we are all free
to seek personal aggrandize
ment; call it pursuit of success,
or money, or fame, or status.
The freedom to get ahead, to
improve one's lot, to enjoy the
fruits of one's labors is guaran
teed under our constitution, and
that guarantee is as valid today,
in large measure, at least, as
when the county was founded."
The lack of hampering tradi
tions, including those in busi
ness itself, is another ingredient
in the American success formula,
he adds: "There is little incen
tive to do your best, to increase
efficiency, or to boost output, if
your share of the market is de
fined as 17 per cent of some
thing, willy-nilly."
The third essential ingredient
in the American formula is mass
education, Spaght says."It
would be hard to over-estimate
the role of well-nigh universal
literacy and the American tra
dition of higher education for
all who want it in shaping our
industrial superiority.
"Mass education, with every
one educated to the limit of his
abilities, is the real basis of 'The
American Dream'. Certainly we
aren't doing a perfect job but
our society does recognize that
this basic key makes America
great."
The best manager is one who
has excelled in some non-man
agerial discipline, Monroe E.
Spaught declares in the current
Stanford Graduate School of
Business Bulletin.
Recently named managing di
rector of the Royal Duth Shell
Companies and a former Stan
ford trustee, Spaght describes
formal instruction in manage
ment as "useful."
But he adds: "Unlike law or
chemistry, which are based on
masses of fact and data, man
aging is relatively more an art
and less a science.
"Granted that instruction in
managing may be able to supply
the science part of it, a great
measure of the talents that
make a good manager must ei
ther be born in him or acquired
in other than classroom instruc
tion.
"Thus, the manager is more
an artist or a musician than he
is an analytical chemist or a
writer of contracts . .
Personal drive is first among
the qualities of a top manager,
Spaght continues. "The man
who does anything best is the
man who has the drive, the will
to succeed, the urge to excel.
"In America, we are all free
to seek personal aggrandize
ment; call it pursuit of success,
or money, or fame, or status.
