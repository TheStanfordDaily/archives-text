Letter to the editor:
At the noon hour, this last
Monday, some voices projected
towards Tresidder, calling for
the withdrawal of the U.S. from
Viet-Nam and the other advoca
tions that go along with this
particular point of view.
I found digesting my lunch a
bit of a struggle, as I listened
to professors and students jab
ber on about how the situation
bothered them so much.
One fellow exclaimed that he
didn't know why we were fight
ing. My goodness, he certainly
has a problem there! Either he's
a psuedo-intellectual or he never
read his history lessons very
well (or maybe he never took
history)!
These pacifiers seem to avoid
the fact that the Communists
are behind this war. Did the
Reds ever ask the South (or for
that fact, the North) Vietna
mese whether or not they would
like to live under Communist
dictatorship; or should I not say,
do the Chinese Communists ev
er ask the masses whether they
prefer communes or capitalism?
But, not to get off the subject
at hand, the question is not why
the Reds are aggressing in their
usual manner, but why the the
U.S. is defending the Vietna

mese against this aggression? or
should we say, if we don't, who
has the courage to?
The "peace movements" al
ways tend to make the U.S. pos
ition of defense sound immoral.
I've never known a Communist
who was particularly concerned
with whether or not mass mur
der was a question of morality
or not? (sic). Our pacific friends
delight in throwing the phrase
'nuclear weapons' around. They
condemn U.S. testing yet they
seem to forget that the Red Chi
nese make a few mushroom like
clouds also. They picket defense
spending while at the same time
that defense is for their protec
tion, as well as for the Vietna
mese. If Joan Baez does not want
to pay her taxes to be protected
then let her sing her folk songs
to the G.l.'s in Vietnam.
Peace comes through strength;
all nations have fallen through
weakness of character and lack
of moral fiber. I think I can an
swer that question about why
we are fighting in Vietnam. To
show the Communists we like
freedoms (and I am sure you
pacifiers will agree as you use
the freedom of speech rather
profusely;)

Letter to the editor:
At the noon hour, this last
Monday, some voices projected
towards Tresidder, calling for
the withdrawal of the U.S. from
Viet-Nam and the other advoca
tions that go along with this
particular point of view.
I found digesting my lunch a
bit of a struggle, as I listened
to professors and students jab
ber on about how the situation
bothered them so much.
One fellow exclaimed that he
didn't know why we were fight
ing. My goodness, he certainly
has a problem there! Either he's
a psuedo-intellectual or he never
read his history lessons very
well (or maybe he never took
history)!
These pacifiers seem to avoid
the fact that the Communists
are behind this war. Did the
Reds ever ask the South (or for
that fact, the North) Vietna
mese whether or not they would
like to live under Communist
dictatorship; or should I not say,
do the Chinese Communists ev
er ask the masses whether they
prefer communes or capitalism?
But, not to get off the subject
at hand, the question is not why
the Reds are aggressing in their
usual manner, but why the the
U.S. is defending the Vietna

mese against this aggression? or
should we say, if we don't, who
has the courage to?
The "peace movements" al
ways tend to make the U.S. pos
ition of defense sound immoral.
I've never known a Communist
who was particularly concerned
with whether or not mass mur
der was a question of morality
or not? (sic). Our pacific friends
delight in throwing the phrase
'nuclear weapons' around. They
condemn U.S. testing yet they
seem to forget that the Red Chi
nese make a few mushroom like
clouds also. They picket defense
spending while at the same time
that defense is for their protec
tion, as well as for the Vietna
mese. If Joan Baez does not want
to pay her taxes to be protected
then let her sing her folk songs
to the G.l.'s in Vietnam.
Peace comes through strength;
all nations have fallen through
weakness of character and lack
of moral fiber. I think I can an
swer that question about why
we are fighting in Vietnam. To
show the Communists we like
freedoms (and I am sure you
pacifiers will agree as you use
the freedom of speech rather
profusely;)
