With this issue, the Stanford
Summer Weekly ceases publi
cation.
The staff, realizing that
summer is a time to laugh and
have fun, has attempted to
avoid printing hard news, be
lieving that the two are strong
ly incompatible.
"Ah! Vanitas Vanitatum!
Which of us is happy in this
world? Which of us has his de
sire? or, having it, is satisfied?
Come children, let us shut up
the box and the puppets, for
our play is played out."
With this quote, and the
bumper sticker printed below
(it is regretted we could not
print glue on the reverse side)
the reader should be armed for
a sojourn in the world.
Good luck.
