# Job Recruitment Program Under Way At Princeton
## 
### 
College students who have
found the summer-work market
glutted this season should find
part-time job prospects brighter
next summer, thanks to a unique
recruiting program underway at
Princeton University.
The new program was explain
ed in an article from the Phila
delphia Enquirer last month.
Half a dozen Princeton stu
dents are spending this summer
talking with employers in major
cities in an attempt to line up
jobs for students when classes
end next June.
THE RECRUITING Is being
done under the work-study pro
visions of the Economic Oppor
tunity Act of 1964. The Federal
Government pays 90 per cent of
the student recruiters' salaries,
which will amount to about $900
for this summer.
Under the act's provisions, the
government may assist a stu
dent financially in work either
for his institution or for a non
profit organization, if the work
is related to his studies or is in
the public interest and will not
result In displacement of a full
time worker.
THE PRINCETON recruitment
plan was conceived by Carl
Fields, assistant director of the
university's Bureau of Student
Aid.
"It's basically a public rela

tlons effort," said Fields, who
believes other colleges and uni
versities may adopt a similar
plan.
President Wallace Sterling
has written Labor Secretary
Willard Wirtz announcing his
willingness to cooperate in such
a program.
Early returns have turned up
four Philadelphia firms which
are interested in the program,
Fields said. In the fall the stu
dent recruiters will provide po
tential employers with dossiers
on schoolmates who will be in
the market for summer jobs in
1966.
