# U.S. Official Predicts Fast School Integration
## 
### 
Eighty to 95 per cent of school
districts in the Southern states
will be desegrated by this com
ing September, a U.S. Office of
Education official told a Stan
ford education conference Mon
day, August 2.
Dr. Morton Sobel, director of
the training branch of the
USOE's Equal Education Oppor
tunities Program, offered the
prediction to the opening ses
sion of a special Stanford work
shop on school desegregation
problems.
He also predicted that the
state of Louisiana will be cited
to Federal court under the Civil
Rights Act, as state school offi
cials have told the USOE in ef
fect, "go ahead and take us to
court, because we will not de
segregate."
Regardless of whether districts
seek Federal funds for help in
desegregation. Dr. Sobel said,
the U.S. Attorney General's of
fice can bring action against
any school district "upon the
complaint of any citizen."
THE FEDERAL Civil Rights
Act will not accept less than

four desegregated grades, Dr.
Sobel explained, as a gesture of
compliance, and the desegrega
tation rule applies equally to
buses, faculty, or school zones,
even in the planning stage.
"You people would be surpris
ed to learn the educational val
ue for school boards when they
discovered that Federal aid will
be withheld if the September
deadline is not met," Dr. Sobel
told the teachers.
"Most Southern educators are
sincerely interested in getting
desegregation out of the way so
they can get back to educating
kids," he said.
MISSISSIPPI and Alabama
will get the most USOE budget
funds because their desegrega
tion problems are the biggest.
His training branch, he re
ported, has a $6 million budget
divided equally for the support
of college and university dese
gregation workshops similar to
Stanford's and for local school
boards for in-service training
programs.
Of 56 such institutes schedul
ed for the fiscal year which be
gan July 1, Dr. Sobel said, all but
10 will be held In the Southern
states at the request of colleges
and universities.
"OUR MAIN function is to de
segregate the South but the
North and West have their
problems, too," he said. "To
those who object to Federal con
trol, we say 'if you don't want
this kind of control, don't apply
for it'."
Of this budget, he commented
wryly, "We've got a lousy $6 mil
lion to change the course of Am
erican education and we have
to make it go as far as we can."

segregate the South but the
North and West have their
problems, too," he said. "To
those who object to Federal con
trol, we say 'if you don't want
this kind of control, don't apply
for it'."
Of this budget, he commented
wryly, "We've got a lousy $6 mil
lion to change the course of Am
erican education and we have
to make it go as far as we can."
Eighty to 95 per cent of school
districts in the Southern states
will be desegrated by this com
ing September, a U.S. Office of
Education official told a Stan
ford education conference Mon
day, August 2.
Dr. Morton Sobel, director of
the training branch of the
USOE's Equal Education Oppor
tunities Program, offered the
prediction to the opening ses
sion of a special Stanford work
shop on school desegregation
problems.
He also predicted that the
state of Louisiana will be cited
to Federal court under the Civil
Rights Act, as state school offi
cials have told the USOE in ef
fect, "go ahead and take us to
court, because we will not de
segregate."
Regardless of whether districts
seek Federal funds for help in
desegregation. Dr. Sobel said,
the U.S. Attorney General's of
fice can bring action against
any school district "upon the
complaint of any citizen."
THE FEDERAL Civil Rights
Act will not accept less than

four desegregated grades, Dr.
Sobel explained, as a gesture of
compliance, and the desegrega
tation rule applies equally to
buses, faculty, or school zones,
even in the planning stage.
"You people would be surpris
ed to learn the educational val
ue for school boards when they
discovered that Federal aid will
be withheld if the September
deadline is not met," Dr. Sobel
told the teachers.
"Most Southern educators are
sincerely interested in getting
desegregation out of the way so
they can get back to educating
kids," he said.
MISSISSIPPI and Alabama
will get the most USOE budget
funds because their desegrega
tion problems are the biggest.
His training branch, he re
ported, has a $6 million budget
divided equally for the support
of college and university dese
gregation workshops similar to
Stanford's and for local school
boards for in-service training
programs.
Of 56 such institutes schedul
ed for the fiscal year which be
gan July 1, Dr. Sobel said, all but
10 will be held In the Southern
states at the request of colleges
and universities.
"OUR MAIN function is to de
segregate the South but the
North and West have their
problems, too," he said. "To

trol, we say 'if you don't want
