Our search for the uncor
rupted woman ended last week
with the discovery of P a r th
Galen.
Parth, who now wears the
crown of the Ist Annual Stan
ford Summer Weekly Queen,
was found wandering along the
banks of Lagunita, unable to
speak a word of any human
language.
Evidently, the only compan
ion Parth has ever had in life
is a very old wolf (whom she
had named, coincidentally,
'Wolf').
Under the guidance of the
Summer Weekly staff, Parth
has been learning the ways of
our world. One of her favorite
pastimes has become glancing
through books, gazing rather
skeptically at the type and run
ning her fingers over the pic
tures with a quizzical look in
her black eyes.
The staff has also spent
much time showing Parth
around the Stanford campus.
She seems, however, to dislike
our hard asphalt pathways and
is always impatient to return
to Wolf (who, in accordance
with local regulations, is kept
locked in the Summer Weekly
office). Perth's only comment
has been, "Okay, I've had
enough. What else can you
show me?"
She shows a remarkable fa
cility to learn our language.
Parth, however,, will not be
with us long. She soon will want
to return to the lake, and be
yond. Of course we will miss
her, but because she means so
much to us, we would never
ask her to stay here.

'If I were a younger man, I would write a history
of human stupidity; and I would climb to the top
of Mount McCabe and lie down on my back with
my history for a pillow; and I would take from the
ground some of the blue-white poison that makes
statues of men; ami I would make a statxie of my
self, lying on my back, grinning horribly, and
thumbing my nose at You Know- Who."
â€” Kurt Vonnegut





Our Queen's great desire to pour over books is second only to
her desire to escape what she finds within them.
