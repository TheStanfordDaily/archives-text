# Indians Blitz San Jose St. in Opener, 26-6
## 
### Bob Thieriot Steve Leopold 
In one four-minute blitz, Stan
lord's football Indians shook off
their early season jitters — and
San Jose's beleaguered Spartans
with a 16-point second quarter
barrage that made the remainder
of last Saturday's opener anticli
matic.
With junior quarterback Dave
Lewis — known to the local
scribes as Stanford's only real In
dian — leading the attack, the
Tribe romped to a 26-6 win before
31,000 spectators.
It looked like an all too familiar
Indian production in the first

quarter, as fullback John Read
fumbled on touchdown away on
the Spartan four on a blown sig
nal. But late in the same stanza,
Bob Rath recovered a San Jose
fumble on the 50, and this time
the floodgates opened.
Hundley Caps Drive
Halfback Ray Handley, who
ranked number seven in the na
tional rushing stats last year, cap
ped the ensuing drive with a four
yard plunge over tackle on the
first play of the second quarter.
Terry DeSylvia added the even
tual winning point on the PAT.
When the Spartans stalled after
the kickoff, 9.7 sprinter Dale Ru
bin took the pigskin on a 62-yard
jaunt which left the visitors gasp
ing. Such breakaway speed from
a Stanford back has been unheard
of in recent years. Rubin took the
punt on the 38, outran two would
be tacklers as he bellied back to
the protective picket on the left
side, then turned on the speed to
roll untouched into the end zone.
The conversion failed on a fum
bled pass from center.
On the first play following the
kickoff Donn Renwick intercepted
a Berry aerial at the 50 and re
turned it to the San Jose 6. John
Read went into the end zone on
the second play, but the touch
down was nullified by an offside
penalty. The Indians had to settle
for a DeSylvia field goal from
the 13.
SJS Scores One
San Jose finally was able to get
a drive going against the strong
Cardinal defense. Craig Ritchey
halted this march with an inter
ception at the Stanford goal line.
Following a first down and a 15-
yard penalty against Stanford,
Lewis fumbled on his own 14, giv
ing SJS another opportunity. This
time they took advantage. Char
ley Harraway carried on four out
of five plays, and on the fifth
rammed across the goal line for
the score.
DeSylvia added another field
goal later in the quarter after
Lewis connected with junior
speedster Bob Blunt on a 57-yard
pass play. The Indians held a
commanding lead at half of 19-6.
Whatever Stanford had done
right in the first half, and what
ever they had learned about their
opponents in the first half must
have been quickly forgotten dur
ing the fifteen minute break. Ex-

cept for another Lewis to Blunt
bomb, this time for 71 yards and
a TD late in the fourth quarter,
the Indians played as though they
couldn't wait for the game to end.
A Tough Indian Line
The Spartans however, could
not dent the Stanford defense,
which was almost letter-perfect
all day. The only Spartan score re
sulted from an offensive miscue,
the fumble by Lewis on the Stan
ford 14.
The Stanford offense, which
had rolled up 19 points in the first
half, was sluggish. Among three
second-half quarterbacks there
were only two complete passes
out of twelve. Lewis, who had
been running over people all day
to the tune of 58 yards, began
passing over everyone by consid
erable margins. Neither Terry De-
Sylvia nor Don Cook were any
more successful.
Stanford gained only 169 net
yards in the second half, and 71
of those were on just one play.
Stanford players and head coach
John Ralston all agreed that the
Indians had played a rather slop
py game. Dave Lewis explained,
"I don't think we were really up
for this one."

One strange facet of the game
was the few number of times that
All-America possibility Ray Hand
ley was given the privilege to lug
the pigskin. Ray, who collected
nearly 900 yards last season to
place seventh in the nation's rush
ing, got only six calls. He made
these good for 26 yards and a TD.
Another surprise was the mileage
Lewis made out of his seven com
pleted passes — 207 yards in all.
Lewis professed that the Indi
ans would be up for the next op
ponent on the schedule — Navy.
