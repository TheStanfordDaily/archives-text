# Privacy Desired In Civ Classes
## 
### MEL KNOX 
Continuing an experiment be
gun last year, a few Western Civ
classes will bo taught in residence
halls this year, according to Dr.
David Savage of Western Civ.
The experiment was initiated
last year with the teaching of
about 10 Western Civ classes in
dormitory lounges in order to uni
fy classoom and dormitory expe
riences.
Unfortunately, according to
Savage, adequate facilities are
lacking in the dormitories. The
results of a questionnaire dis
tributed Spring Quarter by Mer
vin Freedman, then Assistant
Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion, indicate that more privacy
is needed.
31 ore Privacy
"Most freshmen seemed to value
the 'living-room atmosphere' but
wished for more privacy and less
distraction from noise and pass
ers-by."
". . . On the whole, the faculty
did not care for teaching in the
lounges and instead preferred
seminar rooms on the Quad."
Most students shared a "pas
sionate distaste" for "convention
al classroom arrangements," espe
cially in regard to the classrooms
in the History Corner, which have
since been remodeled.
Mrs. Henrietta Edeli, who helps
schedule classroom space, said
that nearly all Civ classes will be
taught in seminar rooms.
Grouped by Living Quarters
Both students and teachers liked
classes grouped by living quar
ters. Most students said that they
felt more relaxed taking courses
with students they knew, and that

living with these students facili
tated sharing books and informa
tion.
Freedman concluded that his re
search "did not indicate whether
such sectioning has significant
academic, intellectual, or educa
tional advantages."
Robert H. Hind, associate dean
of undergraduate education, said
more research will be done. "We
want another year to try it, and
there are further investigations
we want to carry out."
