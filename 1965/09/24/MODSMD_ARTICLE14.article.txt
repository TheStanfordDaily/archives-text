# Stanford's Hallowed Traditions
## 
### 
College life, so our elders tell
us, is filled with tradition. "The
old college try" and "ivy covered
halls" prevade the college litera
ture of earlier years. Many a pre
conception about undergraduate
life is formed from parents' nos
talgic recollections.
It's "natural then that the fresh
man, arriving at Stanford sur
feited with warnings and advice,
should be curious about the tra
ditions that prevail here. What
are they? What do they mean?
Indeed, in our progressive era
are there any of these age-en
crusted mannerisms still left?
Stanford does have traditions.
Many are well defined. Some are
hardly recognizable as traditions.
To cover the cliches first, Stan
ford does have at least one ivy
covered hall (Roble) and it even
has a few ivy-covered professors.
The "old college spirit" is un
fortunately still banned from the
campus due to a provision of Mrs.
Stanford's will, although there
may be some progress in this
area.
One ti'adition peculiar to Stan
ford concerns a Stanford Dolly
(or girl), a Stanford man and an
astronomical phenomenon. It is
called "the making of a Stanford
Woman" and it goes as follows:
No Stanford undergraduate wom
en is considered a true Stanford
Woman until she has been kissed
by a Stanford senior, at twelve
midnight, under a full moon, in
the middle of Quad. In the past,
attempts by freshmen men to
take part in the festivities have
resulted in some rather damp
freshmen.
The Stanford Police Depart
ment is not without its own tradi
tions. Take, for example, Stan
ford's black-booted legend, the
valiant Captain Midnight, whose
determined opposition to wrong
doing is equalled only by his
courtly demeanor in the presence
of Stanford coeds.
Strangely, another old college
tradition, the Spring fertility rite,
takes place in the Fall at Stan
ford. It has become mixed
with football to yield the annual
Big Game Frenzy. Pagan dances
to vestal pompon girls around a
bonfire, all night (but ASSU ap
proved) Dionysian revelry, and
other established rituals raise the
participants to a frenzied prep
aration for the annual (hope
fully) slaughter of the Berkeley
Bear.
Also, there's some nonsense
about an axe.
One of the newer football tra
ditions is the concept of the "mor
al victory," which assures Stan
ford of a "winning" season what
ever the scoreboard may say.
There are moreâ€”many more.
Established patterns of behavior
stretch from the gross comments
at the flicks to the Honor Code
for examinations, from hashing
to drinking beer. Though they
differ markedly from the musty
memories of our elders, these
traditions form the background
that lends a distinctive stench to
life on the Farm.
