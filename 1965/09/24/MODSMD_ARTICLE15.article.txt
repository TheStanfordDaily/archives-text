# Freshman Class Just Right Size
## 
### 
For perhaps the first time, all
freshmen are being housed on
campus and all in the residence of
their choice.
This result, surprising to the
freshman planners and the hous
ing office, was caused by a fresh
man acceptance ratio exactly that
predicted by the admissions office.
Of the freshman, men, 723 are
living in the eight houses of Wil
bur Hall and 132 are distributed
among the Stern houses. The 413
women will be housed in Branner
and Roble Halls.
There were housing problems in
other men's dormitories, however.
There are waiting lists for upper
classmen wanting to go into
Stern and Toyon and for gradu
ates into Crothers and Crothers
Memorial Halls. The University is
assisting students on the waiting
lists to find off-campus housing
for fall quarter. Traditionally, ad
ditional space in dormitories be
comes available winter and spring
quarters.
Residence facilities for about
eighty upper-class undergraduate
women will change at the begin
ning of winter quarter, with the
closing of Union Residence. The
women will move to the new high
rise apartments in Escondido Vil
lage and Union will be remodeled
for administrative offices.
In the planning stages are two
co-educational dormitories, to be
opened in the fall of 1968. Each
will house 140 men and 140 wom
en. Men and women will live in
separate structures around a cen
tral unit containing common din
ing facilities, lounges, and meet
ing rooms.
The first, the Robert S. Moore
House, will be located on Mayfield
between the first and second clus
ter of fraternity houses. The sec
ond is the David and Margaret
Jacks House. It will be on the cor

ner of Campus and Lasuen, be
tween the present Florence Moore
Hall and the first cluster.
