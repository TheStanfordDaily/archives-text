# 'THE MOZART ERA'
## 1965 Summer Festival A Resounding Success 
### 
As a part of its increasing role
in the active cultural life of the |
community, Stanford again pre
sented its Summer Festival of the
Arts from June 22 through Aug
ust 14. This year's Festival was
entitled "The Mozart Era," and
was devoted to the creative gen
ius of Mozart and his time. It at-;
tempted a thorough exploration j
of the late baroque and classic I
styles of music.
Using Frost Amphitheater as a
center of operations, the Festival
held performances in Memorial
and Dinkelspiel Auditoriums, the
Art Gallery, Memorial Church.
Tresidder Union, White Memorial
Plaza, and other campus facilities.;
In addition to presenting the
music itself, the performers and
various distinguished lecturers in
the period taughl courses deriv
ing from the Festival's theme and
gave public lectures on I lie works
to be performed.
Musical "Firsts"
This year's Festival also!
marked several "firsts" in the mu
sic world. The Opera da Camera
rli Milano made its American de
but at the Festival; the New York
City Opera made its first West .
Coast appearance; and the Stutt- '
gait Chamber Orchestra made its!
exclusive 1965 appearance at "The ;
Mozart Era."
The Opera da Camera, long fa
mous for its outstanding Euro
pean talent, hired a very impres- ,
sive group of performers for its <
presentations of Classic Period j
operas. The New York City Opera, i
which pioneered the singing of
operas in English, brought the
finest American operatic talent '
available to the Festival.
And the Stuttgart Chamber Or
chestra performed extensive con- I
certs of both the Baroque and i
Classic Periods under its dis-j
tinguished conductor, Karl Muen
ehinger.
Special Programs
As part of the special programs !
connected with the Festival, Aus- j
trian pianist Paul Badura-Skoda j
taught the Master Class in Piano. !
which the general public was per- !
mitted to audit. He also gave two i
public recitals in addition to his;
concerts with the Stuttgart Cham- j
ber Orchestra.
The Amadous Quartet, the |
famed string quartet from Lon-,
don, coached students enrolled in j
emsemble perfoi-maneo courses. In
addition, Stanford Assistant Pro
fessor George Houle directed the
Institute of Classic Music, which
explored historically accurate in-;
terpretation of instrumental mu
sic of the period. The choral mu
sic of the period was investigated
by Professor Harold Schmidt in
his Workshop in Choral Music.
For high school juniors and sen
iors the Festival offered the Sum
mer Youth Orchestra, directed by
Stanford Professor Wolfgang
Kuhn assisted by members of the
San Francisco Symphony. The Or
chestra gave several concerts dur
ing the Festival.
Baroque Workshop
Finally, a group of professional
actors supported by students en
rolled in the Summer Workshop
in Baroque Comedy presented two
plays of the period, Gozzi's "Tur

andot" and Sheridan's "The Cri
tic." It also staged improvised
playlets in the Commedia dell'arte
tradition at various times during
the festival.
Among the auxilliary events
presented in connection with the
Festival was an exhibition of Clas
sic Period stage and theater de
signs by the Bihiena Family. This
dynasty of designers were the
most celebrated of their period,
and the display was assembled ex
pressly for the Festival.
Also presented were lectures on
the comedy of the period and a
dance workshop with appropriate
period music.
Future Festivals
Future Summer Festivals are
planned, each to feature a differ
ent theme and artistic focus. The
public performances and "learn
ing events" hopefully will attract
the casual viewer and the inter
ested layman as well as the dedi
cated scholar. And, hopefully,
they will be as great a success
as "The Mozart Era" and its pred
ecessor, the first Summer Festi
val, which was devoted to Shake
speare and the Elizabethan Era.
