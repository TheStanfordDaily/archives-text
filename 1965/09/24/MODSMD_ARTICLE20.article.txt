# The
						Compleat Entertainer

### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
To tho more or loss bewildered
freshman looking for entertain
ment on or near the Farm, help
comcth to him who is willing to
wade through the seemingly end- I
less ramble that follows. For, in
l'aet, there is so much entertain- j
ment around, one hardly knows
where to begin; so this observer
and sometime critic will start
with whatever occurs to him and '
go i>n to whatever occurs to him !
next.
Not unnaturally, the first thing 1
that occurs is High Culture, and I
the highest around is the fall op- j
era season in the San Francisco 1
Opera House. It runs from Sep- j
tember to the first of November, j
and for it the glittering of the.
City's elite dress up in tails and
gowns as often as possible.
Music I/Overs
The music lovers in the second
balcony, however, dress no differ
ently than usual, and everybody
hears the same music, which, in
cidentally, is astonishingly good.
The S.F. Opera is considered by
many New York critics to be bet
ter than the Metropolitan, and its
record certainly is outstanding.
Leontyne Price, to mention
only one example, made her debut
in San Francisco with the opera
a full three years before the Met
ever heard of her. Further, most
of the greatest European opera
singers arc first, and most often !
heard on the stage of tho Opera j
House.
Next on the Culture Ladder j
hangs the Spring Opera, which is
just as good as the fall season but
not quite as classy. The San Fran
cisco Ballet performs off and on
all year; opinion is sharply di- !
vided as to its quality. Last year, j
though, it performed an atrocious i
ballet composed by Herb Caen, j
famous Chronicle columnist and
occasional scandalmonger. It was
just awful.
The Symphony
The other occupant of the Op- !
era House is the San Francisco
Symphony, currently under the
baot n of Maestro Josef Krips. The
Symphony, which had boon very
good under Pierre Monteux in the
Fifties, but which fell completely
apart under Maestro Jorda, is
now back on top as one of the
world's great symphonies. All of
the credit is due to Krips, whose j
musicianship and energy are as
tonishing. He has hired all sorts j
of outstanding talent, and made !
the oldtimers play as never be
fore.
There are special rates for stu
dents at the Symphony's Wednes
day evening performances. A i
number of fraternities on campus
rent boxes for the season as the
ultimate snowing weapon. And
there are two or three perform
ances every year that can't be,
missed, namely those in which
Stanford choral groups have i
some part.
Two years ago it was the Ninth.
Beethoven's Nin th Symphony, j
that is, which received an 18-min
ute standing ovation one night,
and whose last movement the j
Chronicle reviewer called the fin- j
est choral finale he'd heard in tho ,
Opera House in 20 years. Last
year there was the Mozart "Req- j
uiem," which featured a combined
chorus of Stanford voices, |
trained, again according to the 1
Chronicle, "to within a gnat's eye
last by Pr o fessor Har o 1 d
Schmidt." Well, maybe not that
close, but. it was an impressive !
concert.
Hayd«>n and Bach
This year Stanford voices will
sing in Hayden's "Creation" and
Bach's "St. Matthew Passion,"
an unprecedented monopoly for a
single Bay Area university. Ap
parently Maestro Krips is ex
tremely impressed by Ihe quality
of voices at Stanford.
Coming out of the stratosphere '
and into a more heavily traveled
part of the cultural atmosphere, j
the Civic Light Opera Association |
annually presents five or six mu- j
sicals and/or operettas, many of
them New York hits on lour (or
on tour and about to become New
York hits). Coming up in Novem- |
ber is "Hello, Dolly!" with Carol
Charming herself. There are oth
er road shows not connected with
Civic Light Opera which pass
through the City often, and there j
are numerous Subscription Series
which offer more of the same.
Special Event.
Every so often there is a Spe
cial Event which doesn't seem to
fit in anywhere. Such was the
appearance of the Royal Ballet
this summer at the Opera House.'
Tickets were fantastically hard to
get, mainly because of Margot ;
Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev. j
but also because this company
has always been so good.
In addition there are all kinds
of little theaters around town that
present the famous and the little
known in straight plays and mu
sicals. The Little Fox ran "The
Fantasticks" last year, a zany mu- j
sical which requires four poles
and a trunk set-wise, and which is
in its sixth year in New York. At :
the other end of tho line was "The
Caretaker," by Harold Pinter,
surely the ultimate in absurdist
esoteria.
Way down by North Beach is !
what is provincially known as the
Red Light District, or, more prop
erly, the Bare Bosom District, j
