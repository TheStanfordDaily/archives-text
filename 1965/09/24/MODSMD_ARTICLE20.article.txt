# The 						Compleat Entertainer
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
To tho more or loss bewildered
freshman looking for entertain
ment on or near the Farm, help
comcth to him who is willing to
wade through the seemingly end- I
less ramble that follows. For, in
l'aet, there is so much entertain- j
ment around, one hardly knows
where to begin; so this observer
and sometime critic will start
with whatever occurs to him and '
go i>n to whatever occurs to him !
next.
Not unnaturally, the first thing 1
that occurs is High Culture, and I
the highest around is the fall op- j
era season in the San Francisco 1
Opera House. It runs from Sep- j
tember to the first of November, j
and for it the glittering of the.
City's elite dress up in tails and
gowns as often as possible.
Music I/Overs
The music lovers in the second
balcony, however, dress no differ
ently than usual, and everybody
hears the same music, which, in
cidentally, is astonishingly good.
The S.F. Opera is considered by
many New York critics to be bet
ter than the Metropolitan, and its
record certainly is outstanding.
Leontyne Price, to mention
only one example, made her debut
in San Francisco with the opera
a full three years before the Met
ever heard of her. Further, most
of the greatest European opera
singers arc first, and most often !
heard on the stage of tho Opera j
House.
Next on the Culture Ladder j
hangs the Spring Opera, which is
just as good as the fall season but
not quite as classy. The San Fran
cisco Ballet performs off and on
all year; opinion is sharply di- !
vided as to its quality. Last year, j
though, it performed an atrocious i
ballet composed by Herb Caen, j
famous Chronicle columnist and
occasional scandalmonger. It was
just awful.
The Symphony
The other occupant of the Op- !
era House is the San Francisco
Symphony, currently under the
baot n of Maestro Josef Krips. The
Symphony, which had boon very
good under Pierre Monteux in the
Fifties, but which fell completely
apart under Maestro Jorda, is
now back on top as one of the
world's great symphonies. All of
the credit is due to Krips, whose j
musicianship and energy are as
tonishing. He has hired all sorts j
of outstanding talent, and made !
the oldtimers play as never be
fore.
There are special rates for stu
dents at the Symphony's Wednes
day evening performances. A i
number of fraternities on campus
rent boxes for the season as the
ultimate snowing weapon. And
there are two or three perform
ances every year that can't be,
missed, namely those in which
Stanford choral groups have i
some part.
Two years ago it was the Ninth.
Beethoven's Nin th Symphony, j
that is, which received an 18-min
ute standing ovation one night,
and whose last movement the j
Chronicle reviewer called the fin- j
est choral finale he'd heard in tho ,
Opera House in 20 years. Last
year there was the Mozart "Req- j
uiem," which featured a combined
chorus of Stanford voices, |
trained, again according to the 1
Chronicle, "to within a gnat's eye
last by Pr o fessor Har o 1 d
Schmidt." Well, maybe not that
close, but. it was an impressive !
concert.
Hayd«>n and Bach
This year Stanford voices will
sing in Hayden's "Creation" and
Bach's "St. Matthew Passion,"
an unprecedented monopoly for a
single Bay Area university. Ap
parently Maestro Krips is ex
tremely impressed by Ihe quality
of voices at Stanford.
Coming out of the stratosphere '
and into a more heavily traveled
part of the cultural atmosphere, j
the Civic Light Opera Association |
annually presents five or six mu- j
sicals and/or operettas, many of
them New York hits on lour (or
on tour and about to become New
York hits). Coming up in Novem- |
ber is "Hello, Dolly!" with Carol
Charming herself. There are oth
er road shows not connected with
Civic Light Opera which pass
through the City often, and there j
are numerous Subscription Series
which offer more of the same.
Special Event.
Every so often there is a Spe
cial Event which doesn't seem to
fit in anywhere. Such was the
appearance of the Royal Ballet
this summer at the Opera House.'
Tickets were fantastically hard to
get, mainly because of Margot ;
Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev. j
but also because this company
has always been so good.
In addition there are all kinds
of little theaters around town that
present the famous and the little
known in straight plays and mu
sicals. The Little Fox ran "The
Fantasticks" last year, a zany mu- j
sical which requires four poles
and a trunk set-wise, and which is
in its sixth year in New York. At :
the other end of tho line was "The
Caretaker," by Harold Pinter,
surely the ultimate in absurdist
esoteria.
Way down by North Beach is !
what is provincially known as the
Red Light District, or, more prop
erly, the Bare Bosom District, j
Last spring the police department |
and the mayor's office got upset j

and started raiding these houses
of apparently illegal entertain
ment. Arrests were made right
and left, as were claims of vio
lated constitutional rights.
A glittering cast of lawyers nat- j
urally rushed to the defense of
these nudie cuties, and foremost
in the fray was Melvin Belli,
champion of the downtrodden.
Daily reports on the proceedings
considerably livened up the front
page of the Chronicle, which had
been reaching for stories since
the last juicy paternity suit.
When it was all over, the defense
emerged triumphant, having es
tablished that nudity is not neces
sarily obscenity or immorality, or
something.
Breezy Attire
Anyway, the acts were declared
artistic and not particularly ob
jectionable, and the waitresses
were permitted to reassume their
breezy attire. The "Topless Scan
dal," as it was called, was finally
over.
In the aftermath, two notable
events transpired. Yvonne D'An
gers, who had been defended by
the aforementioned Mt-lvin Belli,
gratefully gave Counselor a life
si/.e portrait of her in working
dress (or undress), inscribed
gratefully "To the King of Torts
from the Queen of Tarts."
The second notable event was
l he appearance of Carol Doda,
another topless girl, at a benefit
for the Stanford Children's Con
valescent Home, which benefit
was held at the Searsville Head.
Miss Doda holstered (barely) her
silicone-created 44's long enough
to climb up on a picnic table and
strut her stuff, to the amazement!
of the large crowd that naturally]
gathered.
"Layboy"
Her visit was immortalized in
the Chaparral's "Layboy"' issue,
a more or less brilliant parody of
that other magazine we all know
and love. See any upperclassman
for a copy.
All this is by way of saying

that the girls are still in North
Beach fooling around, and lhat if
you can get in, it's liable to be
an eyeopener.
But back to culture. The City
is crawling with art galleries and
museums; the two most famous
of the latter are the Palace of the
Legion of Honor and the De
Young Museum. The Palace was
given by a San Francisco sugar
baroness; il is architecturally su
perb but contains very little
worthwhile besides the original
of Rodin's "The Thinker."
The De Young has better stuff
inside, much better, in fact. It
was founded by the De Young
family in honor of a deceased fa
ther or grandfather. The Palace,
incidentally, is a memorial to war
dead in addition to being a mu
seum.
hungry i
And Ihen there is the hungry i,
the most famous of the night
clubs in town. Last year there
were Mort Sahl and Peter, Paul,
and Mary. Who knows what may
happen this year. Other, equally
good, clubs are all over town.
Returning to musicals, theater
in the-round has invaded the Pe
ninsula wkh great gusto. Circle
Star Theater and Hyatt Music
Theater, both just up the railroad
tracks a piece, have been present
ing big names in the musical
world for two or more years.
Currently, Circle Star has "West
Side Story," with Pat Boone (Oh,
come on, now); Hyatt has "Pa
jama Game," with Jan is Paige,
who created the role on Broad
way.
Which brings this ramshackle
narrative to Stanford, home of
the Tall Tree and the Winds of
Freedom, among other things.
First on the list seem to be the
ASSU Concert Series, sponsored,
not surprisingly, by the Associ
ated Students of Stanford Uni
versity, and the Subscription Se
ries, sponsored by the Music De
partment. The ASSU series var
ies in quality from year to year;
the Subscription Series is always
excellent.
Differences
But to give some indication of
the difference between the two,
whereas ASSU will have a flashy
pianist like Philippe Entrement,
the Subscription Series will have
Ralph Kirkpatrick at the harpsi
chord. Both are tops in their
disciplines, but each appeals to a
different audience.
There are movies galore on
campus, some sponsored by Tres
idder Union and others by the
various academic departments.
They are usually cinema classics,
artistic successes but commercial
failures, and cost practically noth
ing to get into. And then there
are the flicks, which happen ev
ery Sunday night and cost even
less to get into, but which are
(he home of the gross comment
par excellence.
Finally, there are student con
certs by the chorus, the orches
tra, the band, the choir, and myr
iad smaller groups. They have, in
the past, been consistently badly
publicized, and. as a result, poorly
attended. Hopefully, (he Music
Department will drop its elegant
ly printed but minuscule posters
in favor of bigger, gaudier ones
that will reach more people.
Undoubtedly anarmy of people
and places have been left out of
this. To them, apologies are ex
tended; they will certainly be
mentioned in future Entertain
ment articles. This one has run
on entirely too long.
To tho more or loss bewildered
freshman looking for entertain
ment on or near the Farm, help

tended; they will certainly be
mentioned in future Entertain
ment articles. This one has run
on entirely too long.
To tho more or loss bewildered
freshman looking for entertain
ment on or near the Farm, help
comcth to him who is willing to
wade through the seemingly end- I
less ramble that follows. For, in
l'aet, there is so much entertain- j
ment around, one hardly knows
where to begin; so this observer
and sometime critic will start
with whatever occurs to him and '
go i>n to whatever occurs to him !
next.
Not unnaturally, the first thing 1
that occurs is High Culture, and I
the highest around is the fall op- j
era season in the San Francisco 1
Opera House. It runs from Sep- j
tember to the first of November, j
and for it the glittering of the.
City's elite dress up in tails and
gowns as often as possible.
Music I/Overs
The music lovers in the second
balcony, however, dress no differ
ently than usual, and everybody
hears the same music, which, in
cidentally, is astonishingly good.
The S.F. Opera is considered by
many New York critics to be bet
ter than the Metropolitan, and its
record certainly is outstanding.
Leontyne Price, to mention
only one example, made her debut
in San Francisco with the opera
a full three years before the Met
ever heard of her. Further, most
of the greatest European opera
singers arc first, and most often !
heard on the stage of tho Opera j
House.
Next on the Culture Ladder j
hangs the Spring Opera, which is
just as good as the fall season but
not quite as classy. The San Fran
cisco Ballet performs off and on
all year; opinion is sharply di- !
vided as to its quality. Last year, j
though, it performed an atrocious i
ballet composed by Herb Caen, j
famous Chronicle columnist and
occasional scandalmonger. It was
just awful.
The Symphony
The other occupant of the Op- !
era House is the San Francisco
Symphony, currently under the
baot n of Maestro Josef Krips. The
Symphony, which had boon very
good under Pierre Monteux in the
Fifties, but which fell completely
apart under Maestro Jorda, is
now back on top as one of the
world's great symphonies. All of
the credit is due to Krips, whose j
musicianship and energy are as
tonishing. He has hired all sorts j
of outstanding talent, and made !
the oldtimers play as never be
fore.
There are special rates for stu
dents at the Symphony's Wednes
day evening performances. A i
number of fraternities on campus
rent boxes for the season as the
ultimate snowing weapon. And
there are two or three perform
ances every year that can't be,
missed, namely those in which
Stanford choral groups have i
some part.
Two years ago it was the Ninth.
Beethoven's Nin th Symphony, j
that is, which received an 18-min
ute standing ovation one night,
and whose last movement the j
Chronicle reviewer called the fin- j
est choral finale he'd heard in tho ,
Opera House in 20 years. Last
year there was the Mozart "Req- j
uiem," which featured a combined
chorus of Stanford voices, |
trained, again according to the 1
Chronicle, "to within a gnat's eye
last by Pr o fessor Har o 1 d
Schmidt." Well, maybe not that
close, but. it was an impressive !
concert.
Hayd«>n and Bach
This year Stanford voices will
sing in Hayden's "Creation" and
Bach's "St. Matthew Passion,"
an unprecedented monopoly for a
single Bay Area university. Ap
parently Maestro Krips is ex
tremely impressed by Ihe quality
of voices at Stanford.
Coming out of the stratosphere '
and into a more heavily traveled
part of the cultural atmosphere, j
the Civic Light Opera Association |
annually presents five or six mu- j
sicals and/or operettas, many of
them New York hits on lour (or
on tour and about to become New
York hits). Coming up in Novem- |
ber is "Hello, Dolly!" with Carol
Charming herself. There are oth
er road shows not connected with
Civic Light Opera which pass
through the City often, and there j
are numerous Subscription Series
which offer more of the same.
Special Event.
Every so often there is a Spe
cial Event which doesn't seem to
fit in anywhere. Such was the
appearance of the Royal Ballet
this summer at the Opera House.'
Tickets were fantastically hard to
get, mainly because of Margot ;
Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev. j
but also because this company
has always been so good.
In addition there are all kinds
of little theaters around town that
present the famous and the little
known in straight plays and mu
sicals. The Little Fox ran "The
Fantasticks" last year, a zany mu- j
sical which requires four poles
and a trunk set-wise, and which is
in its sixth year in New York. At :
the other end of tho line was "The
Caretaker," by Harold Pinter,
surely the ultimate in absurdist
esoteria.
Way down by North Beach is !
what is provincially known as the
Red Light District, or, more prop
erly, the Bare Bosom District, j
Last spring the police department |
and the mayor's office got upset j

and started raiding these houses
of apparently illegal entertain
ment. Arrests were made right
and left, as were claims of vio
lated constitutional rights.
A glittering cast of lawyers nat- j
urally rushed to the defense of
these nudie cuties, and foremost
in the fray was Melvin Belli,
champion of the downtrodden.
Daily reports on the proceedings
considerably livened up the front
page of the Chronicle, which had
been reaching for stories since
the last juicy paternity suit.
When it was all over, the defense
emerged triumphant, having es
tablished that nudity is not neces
sarily obscenity or immorality, or
something.
Breezy Attire
Anyway, the acts were declared
artistic and not particularly ob
jectionable, and the waitresses
were permitted to reassume their
breezy attire. The "Topless Scan
dal," as it was called, was finally
over.
In the aftermath, two notable
events transpired. Yvonne D'An
gers, who had been defended by
the aforementioned Mt-lvin Belli,
gratefully gave Counselor a life
si/.e portrait of her in working
dress (or undress), inscribed
gratefully "To the King of Torts
from the Queen of Tarts."
The second notable event was
l he appearance of Carol Doda,
another topless girl, at a benefit
for the Stanford Children's Con
valescent Home, which benefit
was held at the Searsville Head.
Miss Doda holstered (barely) her
silicone-created 44's long enough
to climb up on a picnic table and
strut her stuff, to the amazement!
of the large crowd that naturally]
gathered.
"Layboy"
Her visit was immortalized in
the Chaparral's "Layboy"' issue,
a more or less brilliant parody of
that other magazine we all know
and love. See any upperclassman
for a copy.
All this is by way of saying

that the girls are still in North
Beach fooling around, and lhat if
you can get in, it's liable to be
an eyeopener.
But back to culture. The City
is crawling with art galleries and
museums; the two most famous
of the latter are the Palace of the
Legion of Honor and the De
Young Museum. The Palace was
given by a San Francisco sugar
baroness; il is architecturally su
perb but contains very little
worthwhile besides the original
of Rodin's "The Thinker."
The De Young has better stuff
inside, much better, in fact. It
was founded by the De Young
family in honor of a deceased fa
ther or grandfather. The Palace,
incidentally, is a memorial to war
dead in addition to being a mu
seum.
hungry i
And Ihen there is the hungry i,
the most famous of the night
clubs in town. Last year there
were Mort Sahl and Peter, Paul,
and Mary. Who knows what may
happen this year. Other, equally
good, clubs are all over town.
Returning to musicals, theater
in the-round has invaded the Pe
ninsula wkh great gusto. Circle
Star Theater and Hyatt Music
Theater, both just up the railroad
tracks a piece, have been present
ing big names in the musical
world for two or more years.
Currently, Circle Star has "West
Side Story," with Pat Boone (Oh,
come on, now); Hyatt has "Pa
jama Game," with Jan is Paige,
who created the role on Broad
way.
Which brings this ramshackle
narrative to Stanford, home of
the Tall Tree and the Winds of
Freedom, among other things.
First on the list seem to be the
ASSU Concert Series, sponsored,
not surprisingly, by the Associ
ated Students of Stanford Uni
versity, and the Subscription Se
ries, sponsored by the Music De
partment. The ASSU series var
ies in quality from year to year;
the Subscription Series is always
excellent.
Differences
But to give some indication of
the difference between the two,
whereas ASSU will have a flashy
pianist like Philippe Entrement,
the Subscription Series will have
Ralph Kirkpatrick at the harpsi
chord. Both are tops in their
disciplines, but each appeals to a
different audience.
There are movies galore on
campus, some sponsored by Tres
idder Union and others by the
various academic departments.
They are usually cinema classics,
artistic successes but commercial
failures, and cost practically noth
ing to get into. And then there
are the flicks, which happen ev
ery Sunday night and cost even
less to get into, but which are
(he home of the gross comment
par excellence.
Finally, there are student con
certs by the chorus, the orches
tra, the band, the choir, and myr
iad smaller groups. They have, in
the past, been consistently badly
publicized, and. as a result, poorly
attended. Hopefully, (he Music
Department will drop its elegant
ly printed but minuscule posters
in favor of bigger, gaudier ones
that will reach more people.
Undoubtedly anarmy of people
and places have been left out of
this. To them, apologies are ex
tended; they will certainly be
mentioned in future Entertain
ment articles. This one has run

Undoubtedly anarmy of people
and places have been left out of
this. To them, apologies are ex
tended; they will certainly be
mentioned in future Entertain
ment articles. This one has run
on entirely too long.
To tho more or loss bewildered
freshman looking for entertain
ment on or near the Farm, help
comcth to him who is willing to
wade through the seemingly end- I
less ramble that follows. For, in
l'aet, there is so much entertain- j
ment around, one hardly knows
where to begin; so this observer
and sometime critic will start
with whatever occurs to him and '
go i>n to whatever occurs to him !
next.
Not unnaturally, the first thing 1
that occurs is High Culture, and I
the highest around is the fall op- j
era season in the San Francisco 1
Opera House. It runs from Sep- j
tember to the first of November, j
and for it the glittering of the.
City's elite dress up in tails and
gowns as often as possible.
Music I/Overs
The music lovers in the second
balcony, however, dress no differ
ently than usual, and everybody
hears the same music, which, in
cidentally, is astonishingly good.
The S.F. Opera is considered by
many New York critics to be bet
ter than the Metropolitan, and its
record certainly is outstanding.
Leontyne Price, to mention
only one example, made her debut
in San Francisco with the opera
a full three years before the Met
ever heard of her. Further, most
of the greatest European opera
singers arc first, and most often !
heard on the stage of tho Opera j
House.
Next on the Culture Ladder j
hangs the Spring Opera, which is
just as good as the fall season but
not quite as classy. The San Fran
cisco Ballet performs off and on
all year; opinion is sharply di- !
vided as to its quality. Last year, j
though, it performed an atrocious i
ballet composed by Herb Caen, j
famous Chronicle columnist and
occasional scandalmonger. It was
just awful.
The Symphony
The other occupant of the Op- !
era House is the San Francisco
Symphony, currently under the
baot n of Maestro Josef Krips. The
Symphony, which had boon very
good under Pierre Monteux in the
Fifties, but which fell completely
apart under Maestro Jorda, is
now back on top as one of the
world's great symphonies. All of
the credit is due to Krips, whose j
musicianship and energy are as
tonishing. He has hired all sorts j
of outstanding talent, and made !
the oldtimers play as never be
fore.
There are special rates for stu
dents at the Symphony's Wednes
day evening performances. A i
number of fraternities on campus
rent boxes for the season as the
ultimate snowing weapon. And
there are two or three perform
ances every year that can't be,
missed, namely those in which
Stanford choral groups have i
some part.
Two years ago it was the Ninth.
Beethoven's Nin th Symphony, j
that is, which received an 18-min
ute standing ovation one night,
and whose last movement the j
Chronicle reviewer called the fin- j
est choral finale he'd heard in tho ,
Opera House in 20 years. Last
year there was the Mozart "Req- j
uiem," which featured a combined
chorus of Stanford voices, |
trained, again according to the 1
Chronicle, "to within a gnat's eye
last by Pr o fessor Har o 1 d
Schmidt." Well, maybe not that
close, but. it was an impressive !
concert.
Hayd«>n and Bach
This year Stanford voices will
sing in Hayden's "Creation" and
Bach's "St. Matthew Passion,"
an unprecedented monopoly for a
single Bay Area university. Ap
parently Maestro Krips is ex
tremely impressed by Ihe quality
of voices at Stanford.
Coming out of the stratosphere '
and into a more heavily traveled
part of the cultural atmosphere, j
the Civic Light Opera Association |
annually presents five or six mu- j
sicals and/or operettas, many of
them New York hits on lour (or
on tour and about to become New
York hits). Coming up in Novem- |
ber is "Hello, Dolly!" with Carol
Charming herself. There are oth
er road shows not connected with
Civic Light Opera which pass
through the City often, and there j
are numerous Subscription Series
which offer more of the same.
Special Event.
Every so often there is a Spe
cial Event which doesn't seem to
fit in anywhere. Such was the
appearance of the Royal Ballet
this summer at the Opera House.'
Tickets were fantastically hard to
get, mainly because of Margot ;
Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev. j
but also because this company
has always been so good.
In addition there are all kinds
of little theaters around town that
present the famous and the little
known in straight plays and mu
sicals. The Little Fox ran "The
Fantasticks" last year, a zany mu- j
sical which requires four poles
and a trunk set-wise, and which is
in its sixth year in New York. At :
the other end of tho line was "The
Caretaker," by Harold Pinter,
surely the ultimate in absurdist
esoteria.
Way down by North Beach is !
what is provincially known as the
Red Light District, or, more prop
erly, the Bare Bosom District, j
Last spring the police department |
and the mayor's office got upset j

and started raiding these houses
of apparently illegal entertain
ment. Arrests were made right
and left, as were claims of vio
lated constitutional rights.
A glittering cast of lawyers nat- j
urally rushed to the defense of
these nudie cuties, and foremost
in the fray was Melvin Belli,
champion of the downtrodden.
Daily reports on the proceedings
considerably livened up the front
page of the Chronicle, which had
been reaching for stories since
the last juicy paternity suit.
When it was all over, the defense
emerged triumphant, having es
tablished that nudity is not neces
sarily obscenity or immorality, or
something.
Breezy Attire
Anyway, the acts were declared
artistic and not particularly ob
jectionable, and the waitresses
were permitted to reassume their
breezy attire. The "Topless Scan
dal," as it was called, was finally
over.
In the aftermath, two notable
events transpired. Yvonne D'An
gers, who had been defended by
the aforementioned Mt-lvin Belli,
gratefully gave Counselor a life
si/.e portrait of her in working
dress (or undress), inscribed
gratefully "To the King of Torts
from the Queen of Tarts."
The second notable event was
l he appearance of Carol Doda,
another topless girl, at a benefit
for the Stanford Children's Con
valescent Home, which benefit
was held at the Searsville Head.
Miss Doda holstered (barely) her
silicone-created 44's long enough
to climb up on a picnic table and
strut her stuff, to the amazement!
of the large crowd that naturally]
gathered.
"Layboy"
Her visit was immortalized in
the Chaparral's "Layboy"' issue,
a more or less brilliant parody of
that other magazine we all know
and love. See any upperclassman
for a copy.
All this is by way of saying

that the girls are still in North
Beach fooling around, and lhat if
you can get in, it's liable to be
an eyeopener.
But back to culture. The City
is crawling with art galleries and
museums; the two most famous
of the latter are the Palace of the
Legion of Honor and the De
Young Museum. The Palace was
given by a San Francisco sugar
baroness; il is architecturally su
perb but contains very little
worthwhile besides the original
of Rodin's "The Thinker."
The De Young has better stuff
inside, much better, in fact. It
was founded by the De Young
family in honor of a deceased fa
ther or grandfather. The Palace,
incidentally, is a memorial to war
dead in addition to being a mu
seum.
hungry i
And Ihen there is the hungry i,
the most famous of the night
clubs in town. Last year there
were Mort Sahl and Peter, Paul,
and Mary. Who knows what may
happen this year. Other, equally
good, clubs are all over town.
Returning to musicals, theater
in the-round has invaded the Pe
ninsula wkh great gusto. Circle
Star Theater and Hyatt Music
Theater, both just up the railroad
tracks a piece, have been present
ing big names in the musical
world for two or more years.
Currently, Circle Star has "West
Side Story," with Pat Boone (Oh,
come on, now); Hyatt has "Pa
jama Game," with Jan is Paige,
who created the role on Broad
way.
Which brings this ramshackle
narrative to Stanford, home of
the Tall Tree and the Winds of
Freedom, among other things.
First on the list seem to be the
ASSU Concert Series, sponsored,
not surprisingly, by the Associ
ated Students of Stanford Uni
versity, and the Subscription Se
ries, sponsored by the Music De
partment. The ASSU series var
ies in quality from year to year;
the Subscription Series is always
excellent.
Differences
But to give some indication of
the difference between the two,
whereas ASSU will have a flashy
pianist like Philippe Entrement,
the Subscription Series will have
Ralph Kirkpatrick at the harpsi
chord. Both are tops in their
disciplines, but each appeals to a
different audience.
There are movies galore on
campus, some sponsored by Tres
idder Union and others by the
various academic departments.
They are usually cinema classics,
artistic successes but commercial
failures, and cost practically noth
ing to get into. And then there
are the flicks, which happen ev
ery Sunday night and cost even
less to get into, but which are
(he home of the gross comment
par excellence.
Finally, there are student con
certs by the chorus, the orches
tra, the band, the choir, and myr
iad smaller groups. They have, in
the past, been consistently badly
publicized, and. as a result, poorly
attended. Hopefully, (he Music
Department will drop its elegant
ly printed but minuscule posters
in favor of bigger, gaudier ones
that will reach more people.
Undoubtedly anarmy of people
and places have been left out of
this. To them, apologies are ex
tended; they will certainly be
mentioned in future Entertain
ment articles. This one has run

Fantasticks" last year, a zany mu- j
sical which requires four poles

in its sixth year in New York. At :
the other end of tho line was "The
Caretaker," by Harold Pinter,
surely the ultimate in absurdist
esoteria.

what is provincially known as the
Red Light District, or, more prop

Last spring the police department |
and the mayor's office got upset j

and started raiding these houses
of apparently illegal entertain
ment. Arrests were made right
and left, as were claims of vio
lated constitutional rights.
A glittering cast of lawyers nat- j
urally rushed to the defense of
these nudie cuties, and foremost
in the fray was Melvin Belli,
champion of the downtrodden.
Daily reports on the proceedings
considerably livened up the front
page of the Chronicle, which had
been reaching for stories since
the last juicy paternity suit.
When it was all over, the defense
emerged triumphant, having es
tablished that nudity is not neces
sarily obscenity or immorality, or
something.
Breezy Attire
Anyway, the acts were declared
artistic and not particularly ob
jectionable, and the waitresses
were permitted to reassume their
breezy attire. The "Topless Scan
dal," as it was called, was finally
over.
In the aftermath, two notable
events transpired. Yvonne D'An
gers, who had been defended by
the aforementioned Mt-lvin Belli,
gratefully gave Counselor a life
si/.e portrait of her in working
dress (or undress), inscribed
gratefully "To the King of Torts
from the Queen of Tarts."
The second notable event was
l he appearance of Carol Doda,
another topless girl, at a benefit
for the Stanford Children's Con
valescent Home, which benefit
was held at the Searsville Head.
Miss Doda holstered (barely) her
silicone-created 44's long enough
to climb up on a picnic table and
strut her stuff, to the amazement!
of the large crowd that naturally]
gathered.
"Layboy"
Her visit was immortalized in
the Chaparral's "Layboy"' issue,
a more or less brilliant parody of
that other magazine we all know
and love. See any upperclassman
for a copy.
All this is by way of saying

that the girls are still in North
Beach fooling around, and lhat if
you can get in, it's liable to be
an eyeopener.
But back to culture. The City
is crawling with art galleries and
museums; the two most famous
of the latter are the Palace of the
Legion of Honor and the De
Young Museum. The Palace was
given by a San Francisco sugar
baroness; il is architecturally su
perb but contains very little
worthwhile besides the original
of Rodin's "The Thinker."
The De Young has better stuff
inside, much better, in fact. It
was founded by the De Young
family in honor of a deceased fa
ther or grandfather. The Palace,
incidentally, is a memorial to war
dead in addition to being a mu
seum.
hungry i
And Ihen there is the hungry i,
the most famous of the night
clubs in town. Last year there
were Mort Sahl and Peter, Paul,
and Mary. Who knows what may
happen this year. Other, equally
good, clubs are all over town.
Returning to musicals, theater
in the-round has invaded the Pe
ninsula wkh great gusto. Circle
Star Theater and Hyatt Music
Theater, both just up the railroad
tracks a piece, have been present
ing big names in the musical
world for two or more years.
Currently, Circle Star has "West
Side Story," with Pat Boone (Oh,
come on, now); Hyatt has "Pa

who created the role on Broad
way.

narrative to Stanford, home of
the Tall Tree and the Winds of
Freedom, among other things.
First on the list seem to be the
ASSU Concert Series, sponsored,
not surprisingly, by the Associ
ated Students of Stanford Uni
versity, and the Subscription Se
ries, sponsored by the Music De
partment. The ASSU series var
ies in quality from year to year;
the Subscription Series is always
excellent.
Differences
But to give some indication of
the difference between the two,
whereas ASSU will have a flashy
pianist like Philippe Entrement,
the Subscription Series will have
Ralph Kirkpatrick at the harpsi
chord. Both are tops in their
disciplines, but each appeals to a
different audience.
There are movies galore on

Finally, there are student con
certs by the chorus, the orches

iad smaller groups. They have, in
the past, been consistently badly

To tho more or loss bewildered
freshman looking for entertain
ment on or near the Farm, help
comcth to him who is willing to
wade through the seemingly end- I
less ramble that follows. For, in
l'aet, there is so much entertain- j
ment around, one hardly knows
where to begin; so this observer
and sometime critic will start
with whatever occurs to him and '
go i>n to whatever occurs to him !
next.
Not unnaturally, the first thing 1
that occurs is High Culture, and I
the highest around is the fall op- j
era season in the San Francisco 1
Opera House. It runs from Sep- j
tember to the first of November, j
and for it the glittering of the.
City's elite dress up in tails and
gowns as often as possible.
Music I/Overs
The music lovers in the second
balcony, however, dress no differ
ently than usual, and everybody
hears the same music, which, in
cidentally, is astonishingly good.
The S.F. Opera is considered by
many New York critics to be bet
ter than the Metropolitan, and its
record certainly is outstanding.
Leontyne Price, to mention
only one example, made her debut
in San Francisco with the opera
a full three years before the Met
ever heard of her. Further, most
of the greatest European opera
singers arc first, and most often !
heard on the stage of tho Opera j
House.
Next on the Culture Ladder j
hangs the Spring Opera, which is
just as good as the fall season but
not quite as classy. The San Fran
cisco Ballet performs off and on
all year; opinion is sharply di- !
vided as to its quality. Last year, j
though, it performed an atrocious i
ballet composed by Herb Caen, j
famous Chronicle columnist and
occasional scandalmonger. It was
just awful.
The Symphony
The other occupant of the Op- !
era House is the San Francisco
Symphony, currently under the
baot n of Maestro Josef Krips. The
Symphony, which had boon very
good under Pierre Monteux in the
Fifties, but which fell completely
apart under Maestro Jorda, is
now back on top as one of the
world's great symphonies. All of
the credit is due to Krips, whose j
musicianship and energy are as
tonishing. He has hired all sorts j
of outstanding talent, and made !
the oldtimers play as never be
fore.
There are special rates for stu
dents at the Symphony's Wednes
day evening performances. A i
number of fraternities on campus
rent boxes for the season as the
ultimate snowing weapon. And
there are two or three perform
ances every year that can't be,
missed, namely those in which
Stanford choral groups have i
some part.
Two years ago it was the Ninth.
Beethoven's Nin th Symphony, j
that is, which received an 18-min
ute standing ovation one night,
and whose last movement the j
Chronicle reviewer called the fin- j
est choral finale he'd heard in tho ,
Opera House in 20 years. Last
year there was the Mozart "Req- j
uiem," which featured a combined
chorus of Stanford voices, |
trained, again according to the 1
Chronicle, "to within a gnat's eye
last by Pr o fessor Har o 1 d
Schmidt." Well, maybe not that
close, but. it was an impressive !
concert.
Hayd«>n and Bach
This year Stanford voices will
sing in Hayden's "Creation" and
Bach's "St. Matthew Passion,"
an unprecedented monopoly for a
single Bay Area university. Ap
parently Maestro Krips is ex
tremely impressed by Ihe quality
of voices at Stanford.
Coming out of the stratosphere '
and into a more heavily traveled
part of the cultural atmosphere, j
the Civic Light Opera Association |
annually presents five or six mu- j
sicals and/or operettas, many of
them New York hits on lour (or
on tour and about to become New
York hits). Coming up in Novem- |
ber is "Hello, Dolly!" with Carol
Charming herself. There are oth
er road shows not connected with
Civic Light Opera which pass
through the City often, and there j
are numerous Subscription Series
which offer more of the same.
Special Event.
Every so often there is a Spe
cial Event which doesn't seem to
fit in anywhere. Such was the
appearance of the Royal Ballet
this summer at the Opera House.'
Tickets were fantastically hard to
get, mainly because of Margot ;
Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev. j
but also because this company
has always been so good.
In addition there are all kinds
of little theaters around town that
present the famous and the little
known in straight plays and mu
sicals. The Little Fox ran "The
Fantasticks" last year, a zany mu- j
sical which requires four poles
and a trunk set-wise, and which is
in its sixth year in New York. At :
the other end of tho line was "The
Caretaker," by Harold Pinter,
surely the ultimate in absurdist
esoteria.

the past, been consistently badly

attended. Hopefully, (he Music
Department will drop its elegant
ly printed but minuscule posters
in favor of bigger, gaudier ones
that will reach more people.
Undoubtedly anarmy of people
and places have been left out of
this. To them, apologies are ex
tended; they will certainly be
mentioned in future Entertain

on entirely too long.
To tho more or loss bewildered

comcth to him who is willing to

ment around, one hardly knows
where to begin; so this observer

go i>n to whatever occurs to him !
next.
Not unnaturally, the first thing 1
that occurs is High Culture, and I
the highest around is the fall op- j
era season in the San Francisco 1
Opera House. It runs from Sep- j
tember to the first of November, j
and for it the glittering of the.
City's elite dress up in tails and
gowns as often as possible.
Music I/Overs
The music lovers in the second
balcony, however, dress no differ
ently than usual, and everybody
hears the same music, which, in
cidentally, is astonishingly good.
The S.F. Opera is considered by
many New York critics to be bet
ter than the Metropolitan, and its
record certainly is outstanding.
Leontyne Price, to mention
only one example, made her debut
in San Francisco with the opera
a full three years before the Met
ever heard of her. Further, most
of the greatest European opera
singers arc first, and most often !
heard on the stage of tho Opera j
House.
Next on the Culture Ladder j
hangs the Spring Opera, which is
just as good as the fall season but
not quite as classy. The San Fran
cisco Ballet performs off and on
all year; opinion is sharply di- !
vided as to its quality. Last year, j
though, it performed an atrocious i
ballet composed by Herb Caen, j
famous Chronicle columnist and
occasional scandalmonger. It was
just awful.
The Symphony
The other occupant of the Op- !
era House is the San Francisco
Symphony, currently under the
baot n of Maestro Josef Krips. The
Symphony, which had boon very
good under Pierre Monteux in the
Fifties, but which fell completely
apart under Maestro Jorda, is
now back on top as one of the
world's great symphonies. All of
the credit is due to Krips, whose j
musicianship and energy are as
tonishing. He has hired all sorts j
of outstanding talent, and made !
the oldtimers play as never be
fore.
There are special rates for stu
dents at the Symphony's Wednes
day evening performances. A i
number of fraternities on campus
rent boxes for the season as the
ultimate snowing weapon. And
there are two or three perform
ances every year that can't be,
missed, namely those in which
Stanford choral groups have i
some part.
Two years ago it was the Ninth.
Beethoven's Nin th Symphony, j
that is, which received an 18-min
ute standing ovation one night,
and whose last movement the j
Chronicle reviewer called the fin- j
est choral finale he'd heard in tho ,
Opera House in 20 years. Last
year there was the Mozart "Req- j
uiem," which featured a combined
chorus of Stanford voices, |
trained, again according to the 1
Chronicle, "to within a gnat's eye
last by Pr o fessor Har o 1 d
Schmidt." Well, maybe not that
close, but. it was an impressive !
concert.
Hayd«>n and Bach
This year Stanford voices will
sing in Hayden's "Creation" and
Bach's "St. Matthew Passion,"
an unprecedented monopoly for a
single Bay Area university. Ap
parently Maestro Krips is ex
tremely impressed by Ihe quality
of voices at Stanford.
Coming out of the stratosphere '
and into a more heavily traveled
part of the cultural atmosphere, j
the Civic Light Opera Association |
annually presents five or six mu- j
sicals and/or operettas, many of
them New York hits on lour (or
on tour and about to become New
York hits). Coming up in Novem- |
ber is "Hello, Dolly!" with Carol
Charming herself. There are oth
er road shows not connected with
Civic Light Opera which pass
through the City often, and there j
are numerous Subscription Series
which offer more of the same.
Special Event.
Every so often there is a Spe
cial Event which doesn't seem to
fit in anywhere. Such was the
appearance of the Royal Ballet
this summer at the Opera House.'
Tickets were fantastically hard to
get, mainly because of Margot ;
Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev. j
but also because this company
has always been so good.
In addition there are all kinds
of little theaters around town that
present the famous and the little
known in straight plays and mu
sicals. The Little Fox ran "The
Fantasticks" last year, a zany mu- j
sical which requires four poles
and a trunk set-wise, and which is
in its sixth year in New York. At :
the other end of tho line was "The
Caretaker," by Harold Pinter,
surely the ultimate in absurdist
esoteria.
Way down by North Beach is !
what is provincially known as the
Red Light District, or, more prop
erly, the Bare Bosom District, j
Last spring the police department |
and the mayor's office got upset j

and started raiding these houses
of apparently illegal entertain
ment. Arrests were made right
and left, as were claims of vio
lated constitutional rights.
A glittering cast of lawyers nat- j
urally rushed to the defense of
these nudie cuties, and foremost
in the fray was Melvin Belli,
champion of the downtrodden.
Daily reports on the proceedings
considerably livened up the front
page of the Chronicle, which had
been reaching for stories since
the last juicy paternity suit.
When it was all over, the defense
emerged triumphant, having es
tablished that nudity is not neces
sarily obscenity or immorality, or
something.
Breezy Attire
Anyway, the acts were declared
artistic and not particularly ob
jectionable, and the waitresses
were permitted to reassume their
breezy attire. The "Topless Scan
dal," as it was called, was finally
over.
In the aftermath, two notable
events transpired. Yvonne D'An
gers, who had been defended by
the aforementioned Mt-lvin Belli,
gratefully gave Counselor a life
si/.e portrait of her in working
dress (or undress), inscribed
gratefully "To the King of Torts
from the Queen of Tarts."
The second notable event was
l he appearance of Carol Doda,
another topless girl, at a benefit
for the Stanford Children's Con
valescent Home, which benefit
was held at the Searsville Head.
Miss Doda holstered (barely) her
silicone-created 44's long enough
to climb up on a picnic table and
strut her stuff, to the amazement!
of the large crowd that naturally]
gathered.
"Layboy"
Her visit was immortalized in
the Chaparral's "Layboy"' issue,
a more or less brilliant parody of
that other magazine we all know
and love. See any upperclassman
for a copy.
All this is by way of saying

that the girls are still in North
Beach fooling around, and lhat if
you can get in, it's liable to be
an eyeopener.
But back to culture. The City
is crawling with art galleries and
museums; the two most famous
of the latter are the Palace of the
Legion of Honor and the De
Young Museum. The Palace was
given by a San Francisco sugar
baroness; il is architecturally su
perb but contains very little
worthwhile besides the original
of Rodin's "The Thinker."
The De Young has better stuff
inside, much better, in fact. It
was founded by the De Young
family in honor of a deceased fa
ther or grandfather. The Palace,
incidentally, is a memorial to war
dead in addition to being a mu
seum.
hungry i
And Ihen there is the hungry i,
the most famous of the night
clubs in town. Last year there
were Mort Sahl and Peter, Paul,
and Mary. Who knows what may
happen this year. Other, equally
good, clubs are all over town.
Returning to musicals, theater
in the-round has invaded the Pe
ninsula wkh great gusto. Circle
Star Theater and Hyatt Music
Theater, both just up the railroad
tracks a piece, have been present
ing big names in the musical
world for two or more years.
Currently, Circle Star has "West
Side Story," with Pat Boone (Oh,
come on, now); Hyatt has "Pa
jama Game," with Jan is Paige,
who created the role on Broad
way.
Which brings this ramshackle
narrative to Stanford, home of
the Tall Tree and the Winds of
Freedom, among other things.
First on the list seem to be the
ASSU Concert Series, sponsored,
not surprisingly, by the Associ
ated Students of Stanford Uni
versity, and the Subscription Se
ries, sponsored by the Music De
partment. The ASSU series var
ies in quality from year to year;
the Subscription Series is always
excellent.
Differences
But to give some indication of
the difference between the two,
whereas ASSU will have a flashy
pianist like Philippe Entrement,
the Subscription Series will have
Ralph Kirkpatrick at the harpsi
chord. Both are tops in their
disciplines, but each appeals to a
different audience.
There are movies galore on
campus, some sponsored by Tres
idder Union and others by the
various academic departments.
They are usually cinema classics,
artistic successes but commercial
failures, and cost practically noth
ing to get into. And then there
are the flicks, which happen ev
ery Sunday night and cost even
less to get into, but which are
(he home of the gross comment
par excellence.
Finally, there are student con
certs by the chorus, the orches
tra, the band, the choir, and myr
iad smaller groups. They have, in
the past, been consistently badly
publicized, and. as a result, poorly
attended. Hopefully, (he Music
