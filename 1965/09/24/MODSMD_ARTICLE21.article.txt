# Undergraduate One-act Shows To Be Offered
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
With the coming of Stanford's
j Repertory Theater, which will use
; professionals and graduate stu
j dents almost exclusively, and
! which will tie up the two prin
{ cipal stage facilities on campus all
- year, the future of student drama
at Stanford has become a bit un
certain.
All that is presently available
to students is the Nitery, which is
being remodeled, and which, hope
-1 fully, will be less of a joke as a
theater than it has been.
The Speech and Drama Depart
ment is not unaware of the prob
! lem. and, in order to provide at
least one outlet for undergradu
ate dramatic talent, has sched
i uled three productions in the Nit
! cry, one each quarter, for this
; coming year.
Faculty Direction
•They will be directed by faculty
; members and/or professionals
, from the Repertory Theater. The
cast and crew, however, will be
i made up exclusively of under-
I graduates.
The first show, scheduled to
run November 30-13, will feature
two original one-acts, one of them
"In a Cold Hotel," by Ben Mad
dow, who wrote the film version
of "The Balcony". Dr. Robert Lo
per, Executive Head of Speech
j and Drama, will direct. The sec
ond one-act has not yet been an-
I nounced, but it will be directed by

sional aetor with, the Repertory
j Theater.
Tryouts
Tryouts will be held September
! 29 and 30 at 7:30 p.m. in the Ni

I productions arc encouraged to at
| tend the tryouts. since the future
j of the program depends upon the
! initial support given it.
if no interest is shown, there
will be no shows; conversely, if
' great interest is shown, the pro
; gram could even be expanded.
I And for those with an eye on
their General Studies require
j ments, activity credit will be giv
; en for participation in the produc
tions.
