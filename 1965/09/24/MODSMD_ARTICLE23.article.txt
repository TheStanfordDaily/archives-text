# Tough Competition
## Good 'Flick-ers' Idolized 
### JIM DRISCOLL 
Perhaps the most important so
cial event on each week's calen
dar at Stanford is the Sunday
night movies at Memorial Audi
torium. Known universally as the
"flicks," these movies are the
supreme test of any Stanford
student's social and cultural
graces, and nobody can hope to be
fully accepted into Stanford soci
ety without diligently learning
and practicing the laborious rules
of conduct attendant to them.
THE NEOPHYTE movie-goer's
first hurdle will be choosing a
seat. It is important to sit in the
proper section of the auditorium
if the student hopes to be wel
comed into the better circles of
Stanford Society.
The balcony is the only section
which a true "flicks" fan would
consider proper seating. Those
people sitting elsewhere are gen
erally social malcontents who are
completely ignorant of the higher
aims of the "flicks."
THE CARTOONS are always
shown first, and the student must
quickly learn to recognize those
which meet the criteria of artistic
achievement demanded by dis
criminating "flicks" viewers. Only
a "Roadrunner" cartoon com
pletely meets these requirements,
and indignant protests must be
made if any inferior cartoons are
shown.
Some cartoons are considered
less inferior than others, however,
and this must be reflected in the
length and vociferousness of the
protests. "Tweety and Sylvester"
and "Speedy Gonzales" cartoons
are usually recognized as the least
inferior while "Bugs Bunny's" are
regarded as the worst.
BETWEEN THESE two ex
tremes lie a number of levels and
the new student would do well to
observe carefully the more ex
perienced viewers to learn pre
cisely how much protest must
be made for each cartoon.
During any cartoon it is manda
tory to boo the hero and cheer the
villain. The sole exception is a
"Roadrunner" which shoidd be
viewed in revered silence broken
only by polite applause when the
coyote is foiled.
TIMELY REMARKS and com
ments are in order during vir
tually any cartoon, and it is con
sidered especially clever to yell
"Eat de bird" at appropriate mo
ments during a "Tweety and
Sylvester" cartoon.
When the main feature begins
it is essential to properly acknowl
edge the cast of characters. As a
rule all female actors must be
cheered and all male actors booed.
However, the producer and direc
tor are always booed and the
costume designer is cheered ex
cept in the case of an all male
cast when he would be booed
as well.
The most difficult social grace
to attain and the most highly
prized is the talent of making
clever appropriate comments in
terpreting segments of the movie.
These comments must be loud
enough to he heard throughout
the auditorium, but ideally, they
should appear to drift down from
the balcony rather than to come
from anv designated person.
ALTHOUGH it is difficult to
formulate any specific rules for
these interpretations, as they are
made up on the spur of the mo
ment to fit scenes in the movie,
it is safe to say that generally
they must be sexual in nature.

Comments pertaining to homo
sexuality and incest are consid
ered especially chic and obscenity
is never out of taste.
Whenever a man and a woman
are alone together, it is quite
fashionable to begin a shrill
whistle rising rapidly in pitch and
intensity and culminating at some
crucial moment. Such devices as
airhorns, slide whistles, and duck
calls are also appropriate.

THE ULTIMATE achievement,
however, and the one which will
assure a student an honored place
in Stanford circles, is to vomit
over the balcony onto the pea
sants in the lower seats. This
pinnacle of success has been
achieved but once in the history
of the "flicks," earning the stu
dent who accomplished it a
revered spot in the hearts of all
"flicks" fans.

Stanford Society.
The balcony is the only section
which a true "flicks" fan would
consider proper seating. Those
people sitting elsewhere are gen
erally social malcontents who are
completely ignorant of the higher
aims of the "flicks."
THE CARTOONS are always
shown first, and the student must
quickly learn to recognize those
which meet the criteria of artistic
achievement demanded by dis
criminating "flicks" viewers. Only
a "Roadrunner" cartoon com
pletely meets these requirements,
and indignant protests must be
made if any inferior cartoons are
shown.
Some cartoons are considered
less inferior than others, however,
and this must be reflected in the
length and vociferousness of the
protests. "Tweety and Sylvester"
and "Speedy Gonzales" cartoons
are usually recognized as the least
inferior while "Bugs Bunny's" are
regarded as the worst.
BETWEEN THESE two ex
tremes lie a number of levels and
the new student would do well to
observe carefully the more ex
perienced viewers to learn pre
cisely how much protest must
be made for each cartoon.
During any cartoon it is manda
tory to boo the hero and cheer the
villain. The sole exception is a
"Roadrunner" which shoidd be
viewed in revered silence broken
only by polite applause when the
coyote is foiled.
TIMELY REMARKS and com
ments are in order during vir
tually any cartoon, and it is con
sidered especially clever to yell
"Eat de bird" at appropriate mo
ments during a "Tweety and
Sylvester" cartoon.
When the main feature begins
it is essential to properly acknowl
edge the cast of characters. As a
rule all female actors must be
cheered and all male actors booed.
However, the producer and direc
tor are always booed and the
costume designer is cheered ex
cept in the case of an all male
cast when he would be booed
as well.
The most difficult social grace
to attain and the most highly
prized is the talent of making
clever appropriate comments in
terpreting segments of the movie.
These comments must be loud
enough to he heard throughout
the auditorium, but ideally, they
should appear to drift down from
the balcony rather than to come
from anv designated person.
ALTHOUGH it is difficult to
formulate any specific rules for
these interpretations, as they are
made up on the spur of the mo
ment to fit scenes in the movie,
it is safe to say that generally
they must be sexual in nature.

Comments pertaining to homo
sexuality and incest are consid
ered especially chic and obscenity
is never out of taste.
Whenever a man and a woman
are alone together, it is quite
fashionable to begin a shrill
whistle rising rapidly in pitch and
intensity and culminating at some
crucial moment. Such devices as
airhorns, slide whistles, and duck
calls are also appropriate.

THE ULTIMATE achievement,
however, and the one which will
assure a student an honored place
in Stanford circles, is to vomit
over the balcony onto the pea
sants in the lower seats. This
pinnacle of success has been
achieved but once in the history
of the "flicks," earning the stu
dent who accomplished it a
revered spot in the hearts of all
"flicks" fans.
Perhaps the most important so
cial event on each week's calen
dar at Stanford is the Sunday
night movies at Memorial Audi
torium. Known universally as the
"flicks," these movies are the
supreme test of any Stanford
student's social and cultural
graces, and nobody can hope to be
fully accepted into Stanford soci
ety without diligently learning
and practicing the laborious rules
of conduct attendant to them.
