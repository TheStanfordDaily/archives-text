# Figure Drawings To Be Exhibited
## 
### 
Wayne Thiebaud's paintings
and drawings of the human figure
will go on exhibit at Stanford Art
Museum September 27, remaining
through October 31.
Following this West Coast pre
miere, these recent explorations
of the human figure by the Cali
fornia artist will go on to New
York to be seen at the Allan Stone
Gallery during December.
Twenty-five oils and twelve pen
cil sketches are to be shown. The
exhibition was arranged through
the joint efforts of the Allan Stone
Gallery and the Stanford Art and
Architecture Department. Profes
sor of Art History Gerald Acker
man is directing the show, and
has written an introduction to the
36-page exhibition catalogue.
Stanford Museum is open 1 to 5
p.m. daily.
Commenting on the exhibit,
Professor Ackerman says:
"Most current painters of fig
ures present them in a very sub
jective fashion, stressing their
own styles and feelings rather
than the individuality of the sitter.
Thiebaud stresses the objective
renlity of the sitter. The subjec
tivity evoked is that of the model
und of the viewer, not primarily
of the painter."
