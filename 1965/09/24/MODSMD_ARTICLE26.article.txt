# The 						Admissions Formulaâ€” Or, Choosing the Farmers
## 
### 
Why were the 1,267 members of
the freshman class selected from
the 7,700 high school seniors who
applied to Stanford last year?
They were chosen by the admis
sions office under a procedure di
rected by the Faculty Committee
on Admissions, the system having
been developed during the last
decade by the admissions office
under the supervision of the com
mittee.
The admissions procedure be
gins in the autumn with the estab
lishment of a folder for each ap
plicant. In this folder are filed the
three letters of recommendation
(from faculty, administration, and
outside acquaintance), reports of
high school grades, and records of j
college board scores.
Rating
When all the information is col-!
lected, each student is rated, being I
given a three-digit evaluation (in
effect, a prediction of freshman- i
year grade point > and a "per ,
sonal" evaluation A, A-, ele., !
down to D and F.

The grade-point prediction is de
i rived from an equation using high
school grades and college board
scores. High school grades are
weighted more heavily than SAT
scores. Also, the verbal part of the
test is given more emphasis than
the mathematics aptitude section.
The equation was used experi
mentally for four years, the equa
tion's predictions being compared
with actual performances of stu
dents admitted by the previous
procedure. The equation has now
been in use in the actual admis
sions procedure for about five
years.
Personal rating is determined
by review of the student's letters
of recommendation, his high
school activities, etc. The admis
sions committee looks for emo
tional stability and maturity and
ability to handle relations with
other students and faculty. Also
sought is "depth of achievement,
one activity done well" rather
than nominal participation in
many groups.

The academic and the personal |
ratings are placed on the cover of!
the students' folders and the ap
plicants are ranked, the academic 1
score being weighted about 70 j
percent, the personal 30.
On this basis about two-thirds
of the freshmen are selected. The
remaining 600 to 700 students are
admitted from the next 1,400 ap
plicants by vote of the seven man
admissions committee.
In this second group, the com
mittee attempts to recognize a
divergence of students that the
equation does not take into con I
sideration. Applicants of alumni
parents, according to a policy set
by the academic council 60 years
ago, are given slight preference,
about 10 percent. The great per
centage of alumni legacy admit-1
ted, however, would be admitted;
without this preference.
Recommendations
The committee also considers j
recommendations from the ath
letic and music departments.
Students are accepted by plu- j
rality vote of the committee. Stu-j
dents on the waiting list are ac-j
cepted on the basis of the number
of "accept" votes they received.
Scholarship awards are made in-'
dependently of admissions. Finan
cial information is not even in
cluded in the student's folder.
