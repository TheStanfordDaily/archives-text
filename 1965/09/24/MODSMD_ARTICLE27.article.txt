# Sophomores Assist Frosh
## 
### 
Approximately 30 sophomore |
women will participate in a pro-1
gram intended to give the fresh- I
men at Roble more of an oppor
tunity to meet upperclass women
informally.
The program will be coordina
ted by Virginia Sullivan and Mar
garet Jo Peters.
The sophomore associates will
occasionally eat meals at Roble
and will also attend some of the
social functions there. In addition,
they will be on hand at other
times to participate in various ac
tivities and to help the sponsors.
There will bo three associates
for each corridor in Roble. They
will be free to decide how they
will go about meeting and helping
the freshmen.
The associates were chosen
from a group of interested fresh
men who applied last spring. Ac
cording to Miss Sullivan, their
purpose will be to keep this year's
freshmen from being "trapped"
into meeting and association only
with other freshmen.
Miss Sullivan added that the
program "hasn't been very suc
cessful in the past, but this year's
enthusiastic and ambitious asso
ciates promise to make the pro- !
gram a valuable experience for 1
both the freshmen and the asso- j
ciates."
