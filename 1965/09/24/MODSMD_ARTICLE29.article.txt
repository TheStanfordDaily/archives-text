# English Program Develops Class-Dormitory Continuity
## 
### HENRY MULLER Feature Editor 
Extensive changes have been
made in the Freshman English
program for this year. Professor
, Albeit J. Guerard, co-director of
: the program, revealed in an inter
view with the Daily,
i I
The biggest innovation, he said, i
was that the intellectual life of,
the student will lie extended to
the living group, so that a sense
of continuity between the class-1
room and the dormitory could be
established. Accordingly, seven
members of the Freshman Eng-1
lish staff will be associated with
the freshman residences and will
help organize various cultural ac
| tivitics there.
The principal task of these staff
members will be to get certain ;
activities started and to provide
encouragement by their continu
ing presence around the dormi
tory. Ultimately, it is hoped that !
' thi i freshmen will direct these ac- j
| tivities themselves.
Creative Writing
Examples of the type of activ-1
ity the staff members would help
j coordinate include creative writ
ing groups for those who do not 1
have the opportunity to do such
j writing in their English course; I
drama groups which would read,
j criticize, and perhaps even write
and produce plays; a film series
; with discussions; an art show in-!
j eluding painting, sculpture, plro-j
j tography, and other exhibits; dis-
I eussion groups.
Guerard added that the spon- [
: sors will play a large part in de-1
; termining the success or failure
of the new program. "It will in-'
j crease both the importance and j
; the burden of the sponsor's job," j
: he said. He hopes that the stu-1
dent associates in the freshman
dormitories and other undergrad
â€¢ nates will also take an interest in 1
j this ''new effort to encourage a j
I more mature freshman experi-1
! ence."
Academic Performance
Accor ding to Guerard, students I
for 1 English 4 will be chosen on |
the basis of their performance in }
English 1 and/or 2. He added that ;

it would not be possible for fresh
men to take English 4 both quar
ters. There will he 12 students
in each section.
Three writers have been added
to the Freshman English staff,
said (Juerard. The three, Jerome
Charyn, James Bueehler, and Car -
ter Wilson, will be among the
English 1 instructors.
Another plan for this year, said
Guerard, is to have a series of
conferences on a topic of common
interest leading to the publication
of a magazine or paperback. This
would require a small nucleus of
capable freshmen interested in a
particular topic to get together
and then attract more volunteers
to work with them. Professor
Dale Harris will supervise this
project,
Divided Sections
Guerard also mentioned that
there is a tentative plan to divide

sections during 1110 third quarter
of Freshman English. According
1o the proposal under considera
tion, the full section would meet
once during the week and on the
other two days the section would
be divided so thai only half of
i he students would appear at each
class meeting.
According to Guerard, the aca
demic program in regular Fresh
man English has lxvn changed to
emphasi/e contemporary writing
and personal response io social
problems. There will be a de-em
phasis of the piecemeal explora
tion of individual literary works.
The theme of this year's English
course will be "The Person in
Modern Society."
Guerard added that again this
year a small number of highly
qualified freshmen have been as
signed to special sections. They
will for the most part be doing ad
vanced work.
