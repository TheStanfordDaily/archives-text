# Frosh Enthusiastic About New 'In Depth' Seminar Groups
## 
### 
As part of a trend to "personal
izing" undergraduate education,
two hundred and fifty freshmen
will this year participate in a
newly-inaugurated F r c s h m a n
Seminar Program.
Meeting in groups of nol more
than eight, the students in the
thirty-five seminars will attend
two to three hour weekly sessions
for two quarters, receiving six
units credit.
The interdepartmental program
was set up last year with an anon
ymous $50,000 granl "to en
courage creativity." A committee,
under the direction of Prof. Al
bert Guerard, decided the fresh
man year would benefit most
from the impact of a special pro
gram and, because Prof. Guerard
had participated in a similar pro
gram at Harvard, the idea of
Freshman Seminars was accept
ed.
Large Response
Response from the incoming
freshmen was so great—a quar
ter of the class applied for the
program—that other seminar pro
grams are being planned. These,
to bo held during the winter and
spring, will be noncrcdit courses,
however.
The Freshman Seminars are be
ing offered in nineteen depart
ments and hope, through close
contact with faculty, to "sustain

,lhe intellectual excitement fresh
: men bring to Stanford but some
j time's lose in the large introduc
tory courses," according to Eliza
beth Webb, director of the pro
! gram.
As part of the program of
change in undergraduate educa
| tion being led by Robert J. Wert,
: Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion, the Seminars will emphasize
; exploration in depth and possible
courage creativity."
No Prerequisites
The Seminars, however, arc not
an advanced Placement program.
In most cases, there are no pre
requisites and admission was by
| draw.
"The grant was made for a one
i year program. The encouraging
response from both the freshmen
and the faculty, however, has
given us every expectation and
; hope that the program will con
| tinue," sttaes Mrs. Webb.
An informal meeting for the
I participating faculty and fresh
men will be held this afternoon
at 4 in the large lounge of Tresid
der Union. There will be addresses
! by Dean Wert and Prof. Guerard.
The occasion will also serve as a
chance for the students to meet
the professors they will work un
der.

The Freshman Seminars are be
ing offered in nineteen depart
ments and hope, through close
contact with faculty, to "sustain

,lhe intellectual excitement fresh
: men bring to Stanford but some
j time's lose in the large introduc
tory courses," according to Eliza
beth Webb, director of the pro
! gram.
As part of the program of
change in undergraduate educa
| tion being led by Robert J. Wert,
: Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion, the Seminars will emphasize
; exploration in depth and possible
courage creativity."
No Prerequisites
The Seminars, however, arc not
an advanced Placement program.
In most cases, there are no pre
requisites and admission was by
| draw.
"The grant was made for a one
i year program. The encouraging
response from both the freshmen
and the faculty, however, has
given us every expectation and
; hope that the program will con
| tinue," sttaes Mrs. Webb.
An informal meeting for the
I participating faculty and fresh
men will be held this afternoon
at 4 in the large lounge of Tresid
der Union. There will be addresses
! by Dean Wert and Prof. Guerard.
The occasion will also serve as a
chance for the students to meet
the professors they will work un
der.
As part of a trend to "personal
izing" undergraduate education,
two hundred and fifty freshmen
will this year participate in a
newly-inaugurated F r c s h m a n
Seminar Program.
Meeting in groups of nol more
than eight, the students in the
thirty-five seminars will attend
two to three hour weekly sessions
for two quarters, receiving six
units credit.
The interdepartmental program
was set up last year with an anon
ymous $50,000 granl "to en
courage creativity." A committee,
under the direction of Prof. Al
bert Guerard, decided the fresh
man year would benefit most
from the impact of a special pro
gram and, because Prof. Guerard
had participated in a similar pro
gram at Harvard, the idea of
Freshman Seminars was accept
ed.
Large Response
Response from the incoming
freshmen was so great—a quar
ter of the class applied for the
program—that other seminar pro
grams are being planned. These,
to bo held during the winter and
spring, will be noncrcdit courses,
however.
