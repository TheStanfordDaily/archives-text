# SEX and the Wilbur Parking Lot

### Tom Bourn 
Ii takes i ho average freshman
male about three or four weeks to
adjust to the full significance ol
Stanford's most outstanding so
cial phenomenon — the fantastic
Stanford Ratio. Fantastic if you
happen to be one of the frosh-dol
lies - hustled - by - all - the • studs •
from-the-row. or one of a grow
ing phenomenon known rather
imprecisely as the Paly High Girl.
Actually a very small percent
age of these creamy complexioncd
beauties come from Palo Alto
High. Many represent such insti
tutions as Belmont, San Carlos,
Los Altos. Crystal Springs, Notre
Dame, Horny Cross and others
However, they all have one thing
in common every last one
cruises into the Wilbur parking
1 /t. accompanied by two or three
friends, and inquires of the three
or four freshmen who are stand
ing around like long-horned cat
tle. if there is a party here to
night.
Always a Party
Invariably there is. in either
Arroyo or Junipero but even if
there isn't somebody can always
put on the Beatles and then there
is. Once I ho music starts the gum
i hewing lovelies all hug the walls
and quickly can be divided into
three groups, all of which bear
deeper study.
First, there is the PHG who sits

there with her tongue hanging!
out and her purse full of quar-;
tors and cigarettes (the latter of' l
which she coughs on), waiting to;
| dance with anything in trousers,
i or even to go out to her mother's j
-•.tation wagon in the lot and dis
: cuss politics with this entity in
pants after a couple dances of j
warming up.
The second type of PHG is the
most common and the most diffi
cult to understand and tolerate
particularly after having been
awns from the affection of the |
"Girl - Back - Home" for about a
I month. This individual stations'
I herself along the wail and looks j
: a:- 'liv it in..:, in her green stockings
| as Irm;i la Douce. She too will
dt'.nee with almost anything in
trousers, although it helps 112 ihe i
| anything looks rather studly. j
j Hosvever. she will dance only two I
jcr three limes at the most with'
one person, obviously desiring to!
.spread hoi -rif around. Moreover, I
any mention of hei mother's sta-1
tion svagon and political discus-1
; sions brings about a change in I
climate, usually conducive to a
I polar be r.
Oscar Meyer Fan
The third variety of PHG is '
perhaps the least common and;
naturally the best looking. She!
| comes into the room, finds a seat ;
| on the couch and .just sits there.:
If someone asks her to dance, j

she impolitely refuses from her
throne; if someone gets tired of
this routine and tells her to go
somewhere, she is grossly in
sulted at his audacity to speak
to someone so "class" as she, who
condescends to raise herself to the
same level as a well-bred street
walker. No one really knows why
she comes or what she does over
in the dark corner, but rumor has
it that Oscar Meyer is using it for
a promotional gimmick.
Eventually, by the end of win
io»' quarter the fascination that
freshman males have for these
PHCi's and their dehorning abili
ties wears off with the wonders
of Rush and Fraternities and
Liquor. Then another phenome
non manifests itself.
This is ihe innocent little dar
ling, affectionately nick • named
'"Tree Stump" or some other de
scriptive title, who comes around
on weekends and literally hogs
innocent men who are watching
the "War of the Worlds" on the
tube, or booking in the House Li
brary for their math mid-term
again, to come out to her moth
er's station wagon to discuss poli
tics. But since the guys have gen
erally had enough run-ins with
University regulations regarding
such actions between unmarried
students on campus, the poor lit
tle PHG's must retreat to "no
class" PHB's or into the dark cor
ners until fall comes once again
to the Farm.
