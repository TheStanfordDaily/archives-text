# Upperclassmen To Advise Frosh
## 
### 
Stern Hall freshman coordina
tors, says head coordinator Tom
Galbraith, will seek to "integrate
freshmen into their class while
recognizing that the Stern fresh
man's primary interests will prob
ably be in Stern activities."
There will be an upperclassman
frosh coordinator in each house
to advise the 140 freshmen who
will be living in Stern Hall. As is
the case with the sponsors at Wil
bur Hall, one of the principal re
sponsibilities of the coordinators
will be the orientation of fresh
men during the pre-registration
period.
However, unlike the sponsors
who are the only upperclassmen
in the Wilbur Houses, the fresh
ian coordinators will be in
houses in which the majority of
men are upperclassmen. Fresh
men within Stern will generally
have roommates of their class,
but will be living next door to
upperclassmen.
The freshman coordinators are
Marsden Blois, Donner; Phil Erro,
Burbank; Tom Galbraith, Larkin;
Roy Hemingway, Holladay; Steve
Marti'ndale, Lassen; Tom Peters
meyer, Muir; Steve Snyder, Fre
mont; and Steve Spain, Serra.
