# Stanford Politics
## A
						Growing Activism 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
With palm iromls ami pompons, asphalt walks and quiet talks,
Stanford affectionately and perhaps somew hat pompously tagged
"the Harvard <>l the West"—has long enjoyed a reputation for its
social life and political lethargy.
A few years ago, a reporter from the San Francisco Examiner
toured Stanford's "lotus pads of i

academe," and observed, with
some justice, that "the exploding
outside world has not yet pushed
Stanford out of its comfortable
self-made shape."
Student government was, at
best, a social status symbol and,
at worsl, a joke.
All that appears to be chang
ing now.
The first signs of the emerg
ence of a new type of student,
homo politicus, came in 1962.
when Armin Rosencranz, a teach
ing assistant in the Political Sci
ence Department, was elected AS
SU President.
The whole thing began as a
joke, with "Charmin' Armin" de
claring that students ought to
"send a man to do a boy's job."
But in the last, days of the presi
dential campaign, Rosencranz be
gan making appeals for co-educa
tional housing, encouraged cam
pus intellectuals to lake a more
active part in student govern
ment, and came out in support
of a student referendum demand
ing that the University's liquor
policy be brought into conformity
with state law.
Berkeley Inlluencc
Rosencranz was followed by
Bud Wedin, another student lib
eral. At about the same time, The
Daily began electing a string of
reform-oriented editors.
But all the same, serious stu
dent polities remained all too of
ten the effort of the very few.
LASSU, the student legislature,
spent its time dickering over ap
propriations for new oars for the
Lake Lag canoes.
And then came Berkeley.
On December 4 of last year,
more than 800 University of Cali
fornia students were arrested din -
ing an all-night sit-in in Sproul
Hall, the administrative head
quarters of the sprawling univer
sity. Stanford was keenly inter
ested in the crisis at her sister
school across the bay; all hough
many students were in disagree-

J nient with the tactics used at UC. ;
! most were in sympathy with the j
goals of the Berkeley activists.
Quite unnoticed, a group of
Stanford graduate students or- j
ganized themselves with ihe pur
pose of giving moral support to
j the UC rebels, and the Graduate |
Coordinating C o m mittee was
born. Refusing to become an ad
hoc group concerned only with
the Berkeley situation, the GCC
quickly expressed its interest in
University reform, U.S. foreign
policy, and civil rights.
By mid-January, LASSU, under
pressure from the GCC, called a
special election to fill fifty tradi
tionally vacant graduate seats in
ihe Legislature. The seats were
filled, and, with the election of
radical Nancy Steffon to the edi
torship of The Daily at the end
of January, the scene was set for
the next bombshell.
On February 4, The Daily pub
lished a 4000-word report, written
by two former members of the
Student Judicial Council, accus
ing Lucile Allen, Dean of Women,
of infringing upon the right of
academic freedom by asking
I members of the Women's Judicial
| Council to take notes on the lec
tures of English professors who
allegedly used erotic materials in
their courses to seduce freshman
girls.
In the ensuing uproar, the Dean
and two of her assistants re
signed, and LASSU — with this
and other controversies arising
from participation of deans in
student affairs in mind assorted ;
I by a 62-61 vote "that the ASSU ;
: shall have sole jurisdiction over
student affairs and conduct."
Three weeks later, LASSU vot
| ed overwhelmingly to allow the
ASSU judicial councils to enforce j
I only those University policies un-1
j der the Fundamental Standard
J which are approved by a two-1
thirds vote of the Legislature.
As of this writing, a conference i
