# Freshman's Pocket Guide To Stanford Life
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
The typical Alice in Stanford
land, especially when she hap
pens to he a freshman, usually
finds herself somewhat confused
; at first by the vernacular of the
Farm. And so, in order 1o fur
! f her its psychological campaign
to wipe out naive freshmen by
informing them, the Stanford
Daily prints the following "Pock
et Guide" a brief summary of
j campus terms and institutions:
Hitchin' R.F. — The colloquial
I term for a Real Funny practical
joke. The origin of tile latter half
of the term may be found in the
June, 1957, issue of Playboy.
Captain Midnight A certain
cop in the Stanford Police De
! partment, or more commonly, any
! Stanford fuzz.
Chaparral See "Hoo Tow."
Flicks — The Sunday evening
movies in Memorial Auditorium,
j (For details, see page 8.)
I Fun Stan — The Fundamental
i Standard of Student Conduct, for
j initiated by Stanford's first Presi
dent, David Starr Jordan, which
| states that a student may be re
! moved from the University if he
; does not "show both within and
without the University such re
| spect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others
: as is demanded of good citizens."
This forms a bone of contention
between students and the admin
istration, as many students do
j not believe that the administra
tion has the light to impose its
moral standards upon the young
er generation. Numerous stu
| dents have been suspended in the
; past for their private sexual be
i havior and drinking practices.
GCC—The Graduate Co-ordinat
ing Committee, headed by soft
-1 spoken, bearded Tom Sherman, a
T.A. in tlie English Department,
! spearheads the radical left on the
i Stanford campus. Formed last
winter to support the Free Speech
Movement (FSM) at Berkeley,
the GCC is chiefly responsible for
| the increased interest in student
government and University re
i form, including new social regu
lations and reform of the student
1 judicial system. Jay Kadane, a
i GCCor, was elected Speaker of
; LASSU for 1965-66 at the end of
the past school year.
Hoo Tow Puilt as a memorial
to Herbert Hoover, '92. twenty
j three years before he died, Hoo
■ ver Tower is temporarily closed
| to sightseers while wire fencing
's being installed around the ob
servation deck a measure being
taken as a result of two suicides
off the Tower within the past
nine months. The Chaparral,
Stanford's humor magazine, is
able to remain solvent by play-

up Hoo Tow as a campus I
phallic symbol.
Jock In the colloquial, as con
trasted to the literal, "Jock" re- 1
fers to any individual who par- j
ticipates heavily in athletic ac- !
tivities. The term can also refer!
to an individual who is deeply
devoted to one lacct of life, often
to ihe exclusion of other facets.
(E.g., a student government jock!
is one who is extremely red-hot
about student government.)
Lake Lag— A traditional haven
for homework-avoiding Stanford
it es, Lake Lag is traditionally dry
at the present time.
LASSU The Legislature of the
Associated Students of Stanford
University, meeting every Thurs
day evening in Room 320, Geology
Corner, is the center of student
government. LASSU (pronounced j
"lasso") was considered pretty
much of a campus joke until the
past year, when the body, swollen
by an influx of graduate mem
bers, took it upon itself to con
front the University administra
tion on a number of topics, in
cluding women's social regula
tions and the student judicial sys
tem.
Mem Claw—Memorial Claw, or
sometimes just "The Claw," is a
. . . ah . . . thing located on
White Plaza between the Book
store and the Old Union. It is
commonly the object of many
"Bitchin' R.F.'s."
The "O"—A local bistro about
a mile north of Stanford on El j
Camino Real, the Oasis is finan- I
cially supported by beer-drinking !
Stanfordites. With reform in i
Stanford's stringent liquor policy
reportedly forthcoming, it could
go defunct if Ihe idea of building
an on-campus rathskeller, as pro
posed by Nevitt Sanford, director
of Stanford's Institute for the
Study of Human Problems—ever
materializes.
Paly High Palo Alto High
School, located on Embarcadero
Road across El Camino Real from
the Stanford Stadium. (For the
origins of the institution's nolo- j
riety, see page 12.)

ROTC The Stanford National
Guard, called out in times of na
tional emergency and football
games.
Kd Shaw Former Stanford
Daily Business Manager, former
Student Financial Manager, for
mer Publications Board chair
man. former LASSU Speaker, and
erstwhile ASSU Presidential can
didate. Ed Shaw does not, as of
press time, hold any position in
the Stanford student hierarchy
this year. Reports are that Uncle
Ed, weary of public life, plans to
make this, his sixth year on the
Farm, his last.
Social li«>gs Liberalized last
spring through the efforts of stu
dent government and the admin
istration, women's social regula
tions will probably prove to be
more of a nuisance than an issue
this year. Freshman women will
complain of the inequity of the
restrictions placed upon them
while their upperclass compa
triots roam freely until 6 a.m.,
but will change their minds as
sophomores when they see how
naive the Class of 1970 is.
Stanford Daily A long-time
proponent of campus liberalism,
and a haven for sourheads, am
bivalent anarchists and other riff
raff, The Daily, located in the
plush Storke Publications Build
ing on Lomita Drive, promises
more of the same for the coming
year.
Wally- J. E. Wallace Sterling,
fifth President of Stanford Uni
versity.
Wilbur The freshman dormi
tory across Escondido Road from
Branner Hall. Heavily populated
by sexually frustrated males, the
complex's reputation for animal
ism usually reaches its peak
about the middle of spring quar
ter.
