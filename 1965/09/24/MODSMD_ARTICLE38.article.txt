# Liberals Not Challenged At Stanford
## 
### ROBERT W. NAYLOR 
Political liberalism reigns at 1
' Stanford.
The faculty is overwhelmingly
liberal Democrat, reading lists;
for courses in the social sciences i
| rarely feature conservative writ
i ers. lectures are sometimes tinged
with asides at Republicans and
| praise for liberals and pacifists,
land professors, when they active
ly support causes, usually back
the liberal crusades of student or
ganizations of the left.
This is hardly a surprising or
unusual situation, for it prevails!
at just about all universities in
this country and around the j
i world. True, Stanford probably
occupies a rather middle-of-the
; road position on the spectrum of
1 universities (Cal, for example, is
much to the left), but that spec*
' trum is undeniably to the left of
! the center in American politics.
This simple fact of Stanford's
liberalism, as that term is com
monly understood in the mass me
dia, is of profound significance to
every new freshman, whatever
: his politics.
Disadvantaged Conservative
The most noticeable result is
that the conservative student ac
tivist is at a major disadvantage
vis-a-vis his liberal counterpart,
for he is fighting the whole trend
j of the teaching of most professors
j and does not enjoy the moral and
j sometimes more tangible support
of the activist faculty members, j
In such circumstances, one is eas- !
ily discouraged.
And yet, in a sense, conserva- i
tive students should count them
selves fortunate, and liberals
should deeply regret this state of
affairs.
As a conservative, I can hon- !
estly say that Stanford's liberal- i
ism means for conservatives the
most challenging and meaningful
educational experience possible. It
' means that in four years the eon
! servative's views will become
i more informed and mature than
i could conceivably be the case in
| a less hostile environment. Ho,
I more than anyone else, will be re
j quired to go through the kind of
rethinking and introspection that
is the greatest reward of educa
tion. This may seem small con
solation. but it is important.
Religion Challenged
Much the same can be said, in
! the religious realm, for those who
believe in a Supreme Being. Their
religion, like the conservative's
; political views, will be either
strengthened through re-evalua
i tion or destroyed because of fail
ure to meet the test.
But consider the unfortunate
plight of the liberal (or atheist).
He is not so likely to be chal
lenged. Those students who al
ready accept the prevailing liberal
assumptions about government,
I economics and the foreign and
domestic policies of the United
j Slates will get no argument from
; most professors, for there are few
conservative faculty members to
throw down the educational
| gauntlet. That, I contend, is a
great tragedy.
Not so much because Stanford
will inevitably create more liber
als every year, although lhat is
indeed quite alarming. But rath
: er because liberals can very eas
ily go through their undergradu
ate education without rethinking
a single major tenet of their phi
; losophies or political views. With
out. the kind of tempering such
Ire-examination brings, tho politi
' cal arena suffers.
A liberal who has not been con
fronted with an articulate con
! servative opponent may never
1 learn to appreciate what the con
; servative is forced to acknowl
■ edge: that there exists a logical
and complete case for the opposi- j
tion; that no political philosophy
has a monopoly on truth; that
some political ideas (including
one's own) follow from unprov
i able beliefs and opinions, not sci- :
! entific fact, and honest political
j differences result from just that
! circumstance; that there is not a
; conservative answer for every lib-J
I oral argument or vice versa; and
that one must approach politics
with a willingness to listen to
new facts and new arguments, j
not in a mood of self-righteous- j
ness and intolerance.
These are things that, one learns
when there is a constant dialogue :
in an atmosphere of academic
! freedom, but tho present dialogue
i is so one-sided, perhaps irrepar
j ably so, that the educational proc
: ess is partially jeopardized.
The only remedy for the liberal
; is to seek out, during the course
of the next four years, conserva
j tive professors and guest spoak
| ers. At the same time, conserva-j
fives must work harder to hold
up their end of the bargain. II
: they don't, tile term "liberal edu
i cation" may take on a political
| meaning as well, with most illib
' oral results.
