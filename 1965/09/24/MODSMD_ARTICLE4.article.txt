## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
President Wallace Sterling urged entering students to 'think
hard' about why they are in college and to "allow us who are on
the faculty to think along with you, in addressing the traditional
Freshman Convocation Wednesday.
Speaking to a large crowd in Frost Amphitheater, the President

declared. "I have no quarrel with
any of the reasons for your com
ing to college. But I am curious
to know whether or not you real
ly know why you have come, he
cause your achievement and hap
piness here will be affected by
the clarity of your interest and
purpose."
Sterling then questioned the
students as to what they expected
to receive from a college educa
tion. "Do you regard these next
four years as a period during
which you have considerable free
dom and limited responsibility, as
one in which you will find for
yourselves a new set of personal
values, or an underwriting of
those values you already have?"
he asked the gathering.
"1 have no quarrel with any of
these hopes or aspirations." the
President emphasized, "but again
1 ask if you are clear or think
you are clear about what you
expect to get out of college."
President's Warning
While some students may find
that extracurricular interests con
tribute more to their overall edu
cation than class work, Sterling
cautioned the new students not to
"use involvement in extracurricu
lar activity, however worthy, as
an excuse for poor performance
In academic enterprise in which
you know that you could and
should do better."
Sterling also noted that stu
dents should not be surprised if
their academic interests shift dur
ing their undergraduate years.
"Your secondary school record
indicates a wide spectrum of in
dividual talents and interests, and
a capacity for academic achieve
ment." Sterling told the students.
"It tells us !(>ss than we should
like to know about your common
sense and your capacity for rea
soned judgment, but we are prone

to regard you highly in these par
ticulars also, not the least of all
because you have elected 1o come
here."
