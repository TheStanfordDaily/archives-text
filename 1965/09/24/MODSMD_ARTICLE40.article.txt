# 'Edge of Greatness'
## 
### 
Stanford University is on the "edge of greatness
—or so the Class of fit), like a disconcerting num
ber of its predecessors, has undoubtedly been in
formed by alumni and administrators alike.
Yet now reality may be overtaking promise.
The greatness of a university lies not only in its
academic excellence and financial largesse, but
also in the diversity and concern of its student
body. It is in this latter respect that Stanford has
progressed, decidedly so after the events at Ber
keley last winter.
Twelve years ago. Dean of Students 11. Donald
Winbigler could tell an alumni conference that:
"This generation is going out to meet responsi
bility. Scarcely a day passes without some stu
dent coming into my office to talk about some
problem involving the long-range welfare of the
university. It may be a new dormitory, a new
way of gaining financial support for the univer
sity, plans for the new Union building, a new
service which we need, a new idea for vitalizing
our general education program, or a way of deal
ing with some interpretation of university life
which has resulted from a newspaper story."
Today, these basically parochial—though nec
essary — concerns are overshadowed by the ex
panding dialogue on university policies and regu
lations in the areas of liquor, social regulations
and the judicial system. Moreover, an adminis
trator ma\ one moment be confronted with a pro
posal for a new multi-million-dollar fraternity
cluster, then turn around to find himself dealing
with a local fraternity chapter's effort to end ra
cial discrimination while retaining its name and
identity.

\<>t too many autumns ago, an exasperated
Daily editor raked an administrator who had
voiced his preference for a "happy university,"
rather than one beset with the conflicts of ideas,
•deas \\ Inch in the age of the sit-in are often based
on a philosophy of action. Now, in the post-Ber
keley era at Stanford, with its new activist organi
zations—the Graduate Coordinating Committee
(CCC) and the Stanford Association of Univer
sity Scholars (SAUS), its rejuvenated and in
creasingly powerful Legislature, and its liberal
oriented student leadership, some administrators
may find themselves wishing only for a few mo
ments of peace and quiet.
For those who want their social action on a
broader scale, there are tutoring projects in East
Palo Alto and migrant labor settlements, various
active committees on both sides of the Vietnam
question, the Mississippi* Freedom Project-Stan
ford for civil rights advocates — and numerous
others.
Yet there is more to higher education than ex
tracurricular activism. The ambitious faculty
master program at Wilbur is one example of con
tinued experimentation in the academic field, as
are the expanded frosh English and frosh semi
nar programs. Progress is even being made in
the more traditional aspects of Stanford life, as
evidenced by an increase in athletic excellence.
And this is as it should be. For the very word
diversity will, at times, lead to conflict, but it will
also insure greatness—though not happiness—for
administrators, faculty members and (hopefully )
for the Class of '69.
