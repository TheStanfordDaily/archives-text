# Modern Usage Blurs Meaning Of 'Racism,' Despite Hitlerism
## 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
I recently heard a man denouc
ed as a racist for having observed
that the rate of illegitimacy in
Now York is fourteen times as
high among iho Negro population
as among the white. I was not, of
course, surprised, having become
accustomed to hearing the epithet
loosely used: but I did remark the
irony that it should now be used
against a prominent liberal Jew
ish sociologist, Mr. Nathaniel
Glazer, who recorded that datum
in a book. Beyond the Melting
Pol which he wrote i'n collabora
tion with an Irish Catholic, and
which copped an award from one
of the learned societies which

would not be caught dead traf
ficking in racist literature.
One of the troubles with keep
ing epithets fresh is that it is
very tempting to exploit the op
probrium that attaches to them:
for political purposes, or for gen
! orally malign purposes—to do the
! other fellow in, for whatever rea
! son. The word "racist" has been
| rendered especially horrible be
cause it evokes the ghastly shad
ow of Adolf Hitler, whose entire
ideology was racist, which is bad
enough: but who, unsatisfied
merely to acclaim the superiority
of his own race, set out to exterm
inate an entire other race.

And even in spite of Hitler, the 1
meaning of the word is changing, j
It changes in part because of its ,
licentious use. Any word can be '
deprived of its sting if used com-|
monly enough, indiscriminately
enough.
If everyone who says the No-'
groes in New York breed more il- ,
legitimate children is a racist; if
everyone who says the Irish have
a better sense of humor than the
Swedes is a racist; if everyone
who says the IQ of the average
Jew in New York is higher than j
that of the average Anglo-Saxon i
is a racist —ttien it will turn out
that most people are "racist."
And in a democratic society,
where most people, by the divine!
dispensation of Jean - Jacques
■ Rousseau, John Stuart Mill, and
Oliver Wendell Holmes, are good.
. then by delnition to be a racist, |
: according to that sense of the
word, is all right, Jack.
The meaning of the word is in
deed diluting. The 1933 definitive 1
Oxford English Dictionary, for in
stance, did not even list it. The 7th
! Webster Collegiate Dictionary
1 says that a racist believes that
| race is '"the primary determinant
jof human traits and capacities
and that racial differences pro
-1 duce an inherent superiority of a
! particular race."
A Different Definition
But the Third Webster's Die- I
tionary, the more modern of the
I two, defines the word differently,
j Racism here is "the assumption
that psychocultural traits and ca-;
| pacifies are determined by biolog- j
| ical race," which is "usually cou
pled with a belief in the inherent j
superiority of a particular race." j
Note the important evolution. I
"Determining" is. rhetorically, a
j demotion from the word "pri
: maty." No longer does the word j
require belief in the inherent su
periority of one race over an-1
other; it is merely observed that,
"racism" "usually" is coupled with !
such a belief.
What will the dictionaries of to-!
| morrow say? It depends a great j
deal on how the word is used in!
the hectic days ahead. If every so- j
ciologist who puts down figures i
about illegitimacy rates or crime |
rates is marked down as a racist,
then the entire data-collecting
I profession will inherit the word.
If everyone who believes in state's
rights is automatically set down
as a racist, then the word will
1 further dilute in moaning. And if
the word finally becomes mean
ingless, what word shall we come
up with to distinguish, say, be
tween Harry Byrd and Adolf Hit
lor? Those who throw the word
around for tactical advantage
should ponder that one,
