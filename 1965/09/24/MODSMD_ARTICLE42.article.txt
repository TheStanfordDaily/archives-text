## Passion vs Structure 
### 
Editor, i'he Daily:
The constant re-examination of ;
the nature and failures of Stan
ford's attempt at education has ;
rightly been a subject of much
discussion in the past year.
No one can dispute the value j
of concern in an institution whose \
very existence as an educative in- j
strument is dependent on the po- j
tency of its self-appraisal and its ;
ability to act on that, appraisal. |
With this in mind, let us take j
this burden up again in hopes of !
helping Stanford find the quali- 1
ties that it now lacks.
Passion and Structure
Part of Stanford's dilemma is !
the artificial juxtaposition it has j
imposed upon passion and struc- j
ture. Like the American culture j
it reflects, Stanford has but a I
distorted concept of the first and
an overweening concern with the
second. The grotesque interplay ,
of these two conceptual abortions I
has created a well-ordered group-1
ing of systems that succeed with
astonishing regularity in preserv- j
ing the American stockpile of in
tellectual sterility.
The passion of which I s.jeak is j
an element which, like so much of j
huma nexperience, dangles above ,
the out-stretched fingers of eon
elusive 1 definition. In trying to
explain it, one can only hope to
capture it in its reflections. It is
the preoccupation which makes 1
thought and idea vibrant in all i
its complexity and frustration. It 1
is the spirit which refuses to al
low limits to be placed on human
perception in order that it may
roam all the many faces of exist- i
once within the grasp of men.
The Desire to Know
It is the desire whelming up
within the being that seeks to
know, to understand. It is the do
votion that hri been present in

all the expressions of man's com
prehension of the nature of the
human condition from Praxitiles
to Camus. It is the essence of
thought and learning.
The concept of structure was
originally conceived as a means
of channeling passion. It was an
attempt to enforce an economy
on spirit to prevent its thrust
from being blunted by lack of di
rection. Like blinders on a thor
oughbred, it was used to comple
ment a central driving force.
American education, however,
has seen fit to try to breed horses
by improving its blinders. What
Stanford iti particular has done
is to assume that organization
gives rise to spirit. The result is
a number of programs that,
though well-intended, have given
the University large card files hut
little of the substance out of
which significant thought is
structured.
"A Competent Morass"
By concentrating on construct
ing a competent morass of ad
ministrative procedure, Stanford
has efficiently atrophied its sense
of intellectual passion.
The time has come for all to
think more of the nature of
thought and study and less of the
intricacies of organization. As a
residence university. Stanford has
a rare opportunity to lead Ameri
can education to a real applica
tion of the idea of intellectual in
quiry as a total experience, to
give America a sense of passion
it has known all too rarely. With
out such contemplation, I fear
that Stanford will continue to
fail to education and American
culture will continue as a well
furbished residence for healthy
bodies and lost souls.

the artificial juxtaposition it has j
imposed upon passion and struc- j
ture. Like the American culture j
it reflects, Stanford has but a I
distorted concept of the first and
an overweening concern with the
second. The grotesque interplay ,
of these two conceptual abortions I
has created a well-ordered group-1
ing of systems that succeed with
astonishing regularity in preserv- j
ing the American stockpile of in
tellectual sterility.
The passion of which I s.jeak is j
an element which, like so much of j
huma nexperience, dangles above ,
the out-stretched fingers of eon
elusive 1 definition. In trying to
explain it, one can only hope to
capture it in its reflections. It is
the preoccupation which makes 1
thought and idea vibrant in all i
its complexity and frustration. It 1
is the spirit which refuses to al
low limits to be placed on human
perception in order that it may
roam all the many faces of exist- i
once within the grasp of men.
The Desire to Know
It is the desire whelming up
within the being that seeks to
know, to understand. It is the do
votion that hri been present in

all the expressions of man's com
prehension of the nature of the
human condition from Praxitiles
to Camus. It is the essence of
thought and learning.
The concept of structure was
originally conceived as a means
of channeling passion. It was an
attempt to enforce an economy
on spirit to prevent its thrust
from being blunted by lack of di
rection. Like blinders on a thor
oughbred, it was used to comple
ment a central driving force.
American education, however,
has seen fit to try to breed horses
by improving its blinders. What
Stanford iti particular has done
is to assume that organization
gives rise to spirit. The result is
a number of programs that,
though well-intended, have given
the University large card files hut
little of the substance out of
which significant thought is
structured.
"A Competent Morass"
By concentrating on construct
ing a competent morass of ad
ministrative procedure, Stanford
has efficiently atrophied its sense
of intellectual passion.
The time has come for all to
think more of the nature of
thought and study and less of the
intricacies of organization. As a
residence university. Stanford has
a rare opportunity to lead Ameri
can education to a real applica
tion of the idea of intellectual in
quiry as a total experience, to
give America a sense of passion
it has known all too rarely. With
out such contemplation, I fear
that Stanford will continue to
fail to education and American
culture will continue as a well
furbished residence for healthy
bodies and lost souls.

The constant re-examination of ;
the nature and failures of Stan
ford's attempt at education has ;
rightly been a subject of much
discussion in the past year.
No one can dispute the value j
of concern in an institution whose \
very existence as an educative in- j
strument is dependent on the po- j
tency of its self-appraisal and its ;
ability to act on that, appraisal. |
With this in mind, let us take j
this burden up again in hopes of !
helping Stanford find the quali- 1
ties that it now lacks.
