If this year follows tradition, it
will be one of great battles to j
achieve long-hallowed goals: bat
ties of the Involved Student

Students will abandon academic
careers to strike out as rebels,
risking lives and embracing pub- i
lie castigation to fight for a vote |

not deserve one. Stanford coeds
will risk rape in a Dixie police
station, but black children will
learn that a Negro is a man.
The Stanford Daily may again I
lead a bitter campaign for the j
separation of church and state at
Stanford. Can we abolish the es

Student Outcry
The students will yelp as one in ;
outcry, when an average Joe gets j
the boot for an immature prank,,
as if being a .jackass weren't pun
ishment enough. And the admin
istration will take 4 advantage of
the situation to issue a dozen

The discriminat ion between

you'll puff up and flash back a I
retort, but you'll know you're |
wrong.
Later, maybe after Christmas, i
a new light will dawn, and you'll
wake up one morning and say, ;
"I've made it. NOW I know my
way around. I know all the slang,
I dress right, I've got a girl (or a j

But another day will come, may

you'll look back and smile at your
first months at Stanford. It comes ;
slowly and you're never sure, but |
one day you will understand that
the seniors who laughed were (
right. You will have changed, and
when you realize that, you'll have
made it.
That is the real beginning. It's
