# The

## Frosh: You're Here, But When Will You Arrive? 
### Art Fisher 
This, they tell you, is just the'
beginning.
Ynu arc ni.w a collegiale. eli
gible to we r a Stanford sweat
shirt, causing the home-town las
sies to fling themselves on the
sand.
You have chosen Stanford, "the
life uf the mind," and the CI rand
O'd Stanford Indian Tuition.
In the days ahead your mind
will reach out. e ; ger to grasp the
essence of this strange world of
complex institutions and simple!
people. Here is a taste.
If this year follows tradition, it
will be one of great battles to j
achieve long-hallowed goals: bat
ties of the Involved Student
against the Status Quo.
Students will abandon academic
careers to strike out as rebels,
risking lives and embracing pub- i
lie castigation to fight for a vote |
for men who believe they may ;
not deserve one. Stanford coeds
will risk rape in a Dixie police
station, but black children will
learn that a Negro is a man.
The Stanford Daily may again I
lead a bitter campaign for the j
separation of church and state at
Stanford. Can we abolish the es
tablished "nondenominational" re
ligion? Is any man free to wor
ship in the university building of I
his choice?
Student Outcry
The students will yelp as one in ;
outcry, when an average Joe gets j
the boot for an immature prank,,
as if being a .jackass weren't pun
ishment enough. And the admin
istration will take 4 advantage of
the situation to issue a dozen
statements saying nothing with
clever ambiguity.
Some will call Stanford "the
Harvard of the West" and others !
will ask, "Where is Leadership in
this university?" And a few will j
simply scream "RF" and then |
subside back into the long wait j
for the short weekend.
But amid the great controver-|
sies that will wear on long after!
the present participants are gone, i
there stands supreme the average,
lired, bleary-eyed hero of the aca
demic struggle.
Your English teachers will coax
and cajole and threaten and warn I
you. TT ■ "'••vii imperative of
the Freshnvn Year: "Learn to
write!" tf - ou want to be an in
surance salesman or chemist and ]
thin': hat writing your name is
enough, wait until you hit the 1
first midterm in Western Civ. |
Seventy Exams
Between you and a diploma}
stand some seventy essay exami
nations. At Stanford the pen is 1
mightier than the sword. Students
are forced to live by the pen, and
not a few die by the pen.
In the coming years you will
meet teaching assistants so im
mature your kid sister wouldn't I
Hate them and professors so bril-!
liant you'll sit in awe with your j

chin on your chest, unable to;
write, praying you'll remember.
'I hey s'iy an education at MIT
i' like getting a drink of water at
a fire hydrant. S lanford is more
like a public fountain now a

to the Union and wrap themselves
immediately around a cup of cof
fee. Other will stay away, deter
mined to gel thi most from col
lege l\v thirty self-imposed dead j
weeks the first year. Both will
mi s the point completely, but
then for the freshman, there is'
always next year.
Beanies
The discriminat ion between
frosh and tho aged is real and
valid. No one wears a beanie i
here, but you won't miss the si-1
lent message: "Kid, you're just a |
little freshman and you don't ;
know what's happening." And i
you'll puff up and flash back a I
retort, but you'll know you're |
wrong.
Later, maybe after Christmas, i
a new light will dawn, and you'll
wake up one morning and say, ;
"I've made it. NOW I know my
way around. I know all the slang,
I dress right, I've got a girl (or a j
boy friend) I'm really collegiate, i
At last I know what it's all :
about!"
But another day will come, may
be next year, maybe later, when
you'll look back and smile at your
first months at Stanford. It comes ;
slowly and you're never sure, but |
one day you will understand that
the seniors who laughed were (
right. You will have changed, and
when you realize that, you'll have
made it.
That is the real beginning. It's
all Frosh Week until then.
