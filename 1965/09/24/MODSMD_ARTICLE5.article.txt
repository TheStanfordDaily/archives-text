"In my previous experience I
have never coached a belter cen-1
ter. What's more, I've never i
coached against a middle man j
with Dittman's ability." says Na

his massive lineman Harry "Skip"
Dittman.
Led by Dittman. the Midship

The line will have to be much
sharper and quarterback Dave
Lewis will have lo click on his
short passes to repeat last Sat - j
urday's score, though. Coach Ral

would pro b a h 1 y he Dittman.

fense, especially if things get
tight." Dittman also handles the j
