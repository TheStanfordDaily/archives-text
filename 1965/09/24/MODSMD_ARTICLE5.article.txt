"In my previous experience I
have never coached a belter cen-1
ter. What's more, I've never i
coached against a middle man j
with Dittman's ability." says Na
val Academy Coach Bill Elias oJ'
his massive lineman Harry "Skip"
Dittman.
Led by Dittman. the Midship
men eome lo Stanford tomorrow
lo provide the first real test for
the Stanford offense of Coaeh
John Ralston.
The Indians will stick with
their* winning although jittery of- j
fense which beat depth.ess San
Jose,
Same Line-up
The line will have to be much
sharper and quarterback Dave
Lewis will have lo click on his
short passes to repeat last Sat - j
urday's score, though. Coach Ral
ston was quite disappointed at the
lack of sustained drives against
San Jose.
Lewis, Ray Ilandley, Bob Blunt,
and John Read will again start
in the backfield while Stanford's;
other 1 exceptionally strong point, I
the defensive line, will feature.

Navy lost its first start of the j
season to Syracuse M-fi. Mow
ever, Svracusr reportedh the top

| learn in the East this year, was
hard pressed by the Navy de
-1 fense and had to rely on five key
i interceptions to win the ball
i game.
The Sailor offense features a
rough line led by the All-America
candidate Dittman, a 6 fool 6, 242
pound middle man. But Dittman,
: nicknamed "Tree" by his team
mates, is not limited solely to of
fensive duty.
Navy coach Elias has said, "If
we use a player both ways, it
would pro b a h 1 y he Dittman.
| Right now we feel his best use is
i with the attack unit, but don't
bo surprised to see him on de
fense, especially if things get
tight." Dittman also handles the j
kiekoff duties.
Favorite pass targets for the
. quarterbacks are ends Phil Nor-
I ( ori and Calvin Huey. Huey made i
a circus catch of a Cartwright j
pass last week for Navy's only ;
score against Syracuse. Backing j
up Norton is Rob Taylor, the lead- ;
ing receiver on the 19(>4 Naval j
Plebe team.
Four Letternu'ii
On the defense Navy was hurt
by graduation and spoils only j
four lettermen, while starting
i three sophomores. However they |
are well drilled and rely on ex- 1
cedent field pursuit. Top defen- i
sive men are Ray Hill and tackle
Ron Buschbom.
Hill, voted ahe game's top line
man in last week's opener, has
the size and speed for the defen
sive end spot in the five - man
Navy line. Buschbom anchors the
line at 230 pounds.
Other Navy standouts are Jim
Angel and A 1 Roodhouse. Angel
is a defensive halfback and han
dles the punt returns for the Mid
shipmen. Roodhouse, a native
Californian from Palo Alto, was
the leading ball carrier in last
week's game, averaging 5.1 yards
per carry. Roodhouse also boomed
one punt for 56 yards, though An
gel usually handles the punting
chores.
Improving Offense
Elias hopes to have an im
proved offense to tangle with
Stanford. The Midshipmen were
brilliant on defense but the offen
sive attack sputtered as Syracuse
intercepted five passes, three in
side the 11-yard line.
"I thought our defense did a
truly outstanding job; they held
three times within the 25-yard
line, but couldn't keep it up all
afternoon. But it's impossible to
give up the ball five times on
passes and not get burned," says
Elias.
Little Yardage
Navy's defensive job on Syra
cuse's Floyd Little, the best back

at Syracuse since Jimmy Brown,
was particularly outstanding. The
Orange standout was held to less
than three yards per carry until
the last two plays of the game
when Little broke through for 23
of his 65 yards gained.
Fresh from the opening victory
against San Jose State, Stanford
will be gunning for two straight
wins and national prestige. Navy
made an impressive showing in
the losing effort against top
ranked Syracuse and a Stanford
victory would impress the East
ern sports writers whose votes
usually determine the top ten
teams nationally.
The game will also be the first
Stanford encounter against a
service school this fall. Stanford
will take on the Air Force Acad
emy in Colorado next week, and
will battle the Cadets from Army
on October 23.

Four Letternu'ii
On the defense Navy was hurt
by graduation and spoils only j
four lettermen, while starting
i three sophomores. However they |
are well drilled and rely on ex- 1
cedent field pursuit. Top defen- i
sive men are Ray Hill and tackle
Ron Buschbom.
Hill, voted ahe game's top line
man in last week's opener, has
the size and speed for the defen
sive end spot in the five - man
Navy line. Buschbom anchors the
line at 230 pounds.
Other Navy standouts are Jim
Angel and A 1 Roodhouse. Angel
is a defensive halfback and han
dles the punt returns for the Mid
shipmen. Roodhouse, a native
Californian from Palo Alto, was
the leading ball carrier in last
week's game, averaging 5.1 yards
per carry. Roodhouse also boomed
one punt for 56 yards, though An
gel usually handles the punting
chores.
Improving Offense
Elias hopes to have an im
proved offense to tangle with
Stanford. The Midshipmen were
brilliant on defense but the offen
sive attack sputtered as Syracuse
intercepted five passes, three in
side the 11-yard line.
"I thought our defense did a
truly outstanding job; they held
three times within the 25-yard
line, but couldn't keep it up all
afternoon. But it's impossible to
give up the ball five times on
passes and not get burned," says
Elias.
Little Yardage
Navy's defensive job on Syra
cuse's Floyd Little, the best back

at Syracuse since Jimmy Brown,
was particularly outstanding. The
Orange standout was held to less
than three yards per carry until
the last two plays of the game
when Little broke through for 23
of his 65 yards gained.
Fresh from the opening victory
against San Jose State, Stanford
will be gunning for two straight
wins and national prestige. Navy
made an impressive showing in
the losing effort against top
ranked Syracuse and a Stanford
victory would impress the East
ern sports writers whose votes
usually determine the top ten
teams nationally.
The game will also be the first
Stanford encounter against a
service school this fall. Stanford
will take on the Air Force Acad
emy in Colorado next week, and
will battle the Cadets from Army
on October 23.

Navy lost its first start of the j
season to Syracuse M-fi. Mow
ever, Svracusr reportedh the top

| learn in the East this year, was
hard pressed by the Navy de
-1 fense and had to rely on five key
i interceptions to win the ball
i game.
The Sailor offense features a
rough line led by the All-America
candidate Dittman, a 6 fool 6, 242
pound middle man. But Dittman,
: nicknamed "Tree" by his team
mates, is not limited solely to of
fensive duty.
Navy coach Elias has said, "If
we use a player both ways, it
would pro b a h 1 y he Dittman.
| Right now we feel his best use is
i with the attack unit, but don't
bo surprised to see him on de
fense, especially if things get
tight." Dittman also handles the j
kiekoff duties.
Favorite pass targets for the
. quarterbacks are ends Phil Nor-
I ( ori and Calvin Huey. Huey made i
a circus catch of a Cartwright j
pass last week for Navy's only ;
score against Syracuse. Backing j
up Norton is Rob Taylor, the lead- ;
ing receiver on the 19(>4 Naval j
Plebe team.
Four Letternu'ii
On the defense Navy was hurt
by graduation and spoils only j
four lettermen, while starting
i three sophomores. However they |
are well drilled and rely on ex- 1
cedent field pursuit. Top defen- i
sive men are Ray Hill and tackle
Ron Buschbom.
Hill, voted ahe game's top line
man in last week's opener, has
the size and speed for the defen
sive end spot in the five - man
Navy line. Buschbom anchors the
line at 230 pounds.
Other Navy standouts are Jim
Angel and A 1 Roodhouse. Angel
is a defensive halfback and han
dles the punt returns for the Mid
shipmen. Roodhouse, a native
Californian from Palo Alto, was
the leading ball carrier in last
week's game, averaging 5.1 yards
per carry. Roodhouse also boomed
one punt for 56 yards, though An
gel usually handles the punting
chores.
Improving Offense
Elias hopes to have an im
proved offense to tangle with
Stanford. The Midshipmen were
brilliant on defense but the offen
sive attack sputtered as Syracuse
intercepted five passes, three in
side the 11-yard line.
"I thought our defense did a
truly outstanding job; they held
three times within the 25-yard
line, but couldn't keep it up all
afternoon. But it's impossible to
give up the ball five times on
passes and not get burned," says
Elias.
Little Yardage
Navy's defensive job on Syra
cuse's Floyd Little, the best back

at Syracuse since Jimmy Brown,
was particularly outstanding. The
Orange standout was held to less
than three yards per carry until
the last two plays of the game
when Little broke through for 23
of his 65 yards gained.
Fresh from the opening victory
against San Jose State, Stanford
will be gunning for two straight
wins and national prestige. Navy
made an impressive showing in
the losing effort against top
ranked Syracuse and a Stanford
victory would impress the East
ern sports writers whose votes
usually determine the top ten
teams nationally.
The game will also be the first
Stanford encounter against a
service school this fall. Stanford
will take on the Air Force Acad
emy in Colorado next week, and
will battle the Cadets from Army
on October 23.
