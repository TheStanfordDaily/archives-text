# New Faculty-Master Initiates Wilbur Academic Experiment
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
This year Wilbur Hall will bo
the scene of an academic experi
rnent that may in time change the
< character of the entire University, j
The Faculty - Master Program is
j being initiated in ihe freshman'
S men's residences.
Dr. Eric Hutchinson, professor!
of chemistry, will serve as the 1
first faculty-master. In an inter-;
j view with The Daily, Hutchinson
said that the overall purpose of
the program was "to foster a
scholarly, intellectual atmi.sphere
. in the living groups."
When the program was an
nounced last spring, Dean of Un
dergraduate Education Robert
'Wert said that the faculty-master I
j would have wide prerogatives
with few "guidelines" laid down
by the administration.
Hutchinson commented that the
University had "been quite lion-!
est" about the freedom of the:
faculty-master to make changes
i and to initiate new programs, lie |
j said that he would "use this free
dom wisely, but I do intend to
use it."
"Academic I leisure"
At the first meeting of the in
dividual houses, H u (chins on !
i urged tlie new freshman men to!
investigate the academic world j
with a spirit of adventure, to;
: "walk through minds of the dis-)
tinguished members of the fac- i
ulty and guests on campus." and
: to seek "academic leisure."
Although the Faculty - Master ;
Program is putting great empha
sis on the cultural and intellec-j
tual, Hutchinson is critical of the!
I American college's desire to keep !
j the student constantly busy in a I
formal way. He believes that the i
new program can create "academ- ,

ic leisure" which he defined as
"the fruitful use of time other
than meeting some formal class
assignment or deadline. It is not
doing nothing, but rather a time
to sit and reflect."
Wilbur Film Series
In keeping with the philosophy
of academic leisure, a number of
new activities are planned:
• A Wilbur film series with
discussions. Hutchinson does not
believe that a film has to be for
to be worth discussing and
plahs to show mostly American
films. *
• Formation of a debating un
ion. The group would be similar
to those in British colleges with
the emphasis on discussion of the

I issues and taking formal stands
! as a group.
• A d r a m a t i c group which
! would write and, hopefully, pro
j dure its own works.
• A Spring Festival of the
; Arts. Competition will be held in
the performing arid plastic arts.
The awarding of substantial cash
j prizes has been made possible
' through a grant from a founda
: tion.
• Faculty Common Room. Lo
} cated in Dr. Hutchinson's apart
: ment. the room will provide a
convenient meeting place for in
formal meeting of students and
' advisers.
• Non-credit seminars run by
graduate students.

The role of the sponsor has
been redefined. Hutchinson hoped
that the sponsors would regard
! themselves as "members of an
■ academic staff." He noted that
the sponsors hold a key part in
the cataclysmic change from high
school to college.
The faculty - master admitted
: that this year was an experiment
that the Committee on Under
: graduate Education was watching
closely. Plans for a faculty-mas
, ter program have been projected
: for Moore-Jacks Hall, but much
depends on whether the experi
ment is a success at Wilbur. If
'successful, the Faculty - Master
1 System may be an integral part
residence living at Stanford,
Hutchinson told The Daily that
the University had taken a long
time to perceive the need for the
program. He attributed part of
:the delay to the only recent ar
rival of a new type of student ai
campuses all over the country.
The college student of today is
vastly different in interests and
: capabilities from his predecessor
of twenty years ago.
Anti-Intellect uulism
In past years the freshman ex
perience has shown a "tendency
j toward anti - intellectualism at
j times." Hutchinson agreed that
i students often left their freshman
! years with fewer intellectual as
; pirations than they had brought
! to Stanford.
The new program hopes not
only to maintain the freshman's
j intellectual interest, but to stim
! ulate it to new goals. The impor
tance of informal faculty-student
contacts has been underlined with
! increased emphasis on the faculty
■ associate program, and an en
largement of it.
No Transplant
In its overall goal, the Faculty-
Master System resembles the
; House System used in the British
; group programs at some Eastern
! colleges as well as the living
I universities.
The new program at Stanford
! is not designed to be a copy of
! any of these older methods. Rath
!or it is seeking to develop crea
tively a new tradition at Stan
ford that will adapt itself to the
needs of Ihe University. Hutchin
j son. a graduate of Cambridge,
said that he did not. intend to
j "transplant Cambridge."
