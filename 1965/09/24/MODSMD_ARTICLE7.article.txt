# Hutchinson Brings Strong Interest in Students to Post
## 
### 
Dr. Eric Hutchinson, new fac
ulty master at Wilbur Hall, finds
himself exactly ISO degrees from
where he began his academic ca
reer.
Once in charge of a women's
residence at the London School of
Economics with Mrs. Hutchinson,
Dr. and Mrs. Hutchinson arc re
newing their undergraduate con
tacts with 800 definitely male
freshmen.
Hutchinson did his graduate
and undergraduate work in chem
istry at Cambridge University.
In 1917, he came to Stanford as
a post doctoral fellow in chemis
try. In 1949, he returned to Stan
ford after a year at Fordham Uni
versity and has been a member of
the faculty since that time.
Hutchinson's background "pre
disposes" him to the Faculty-Mas
ter System. In reflecting upon
his own education, he said that he
values most the informal discus
sions that he had with his tutors
and professors.
He hopes to bring an opportu
nity for this same interplay to
Wilbur. Hutchinson said that in

| formal faculty - student discus
i sions are "worthy of a better
name than bull session." In not
ing the educational gap in the
formal student - faculty relation
ship of the classroom, he sees the
Faculty - Master Program as a
chance to fill this gap with an
"intellectual, democratic exchange
iof ideas between student and
j teacher on an informal basis."
I Professor Hutchinson admitted
! that the demanding duties of his
I new post had forced him to aban
j don his research work, although
| he regards the work of the fac
; nily master as just as creative as
I that of the researcher.
Serve Best
Recalling Dr. Lederberg's con
vocation address, he said that
j each member of the academic
1 community had to decide how he
I could best serve the University.
) Long interested in undergrad
j uates, Hutchinson taught the in
troductory chemistry courses in
- his early years at Stanford, and
was known for his informal Sun-
I day afternoon discussions with
i students at his home.
