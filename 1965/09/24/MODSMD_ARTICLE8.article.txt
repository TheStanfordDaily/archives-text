# First Boat Returns Intact
## Crew Team Looks Forward to Top Season 
### 
For the first time since 1957,
the Stanford Varsity crew com
peted in the Intercollegiate Row
ing Association Championships in
Syracuse, New York, last June 19.
The Indians finished ninth out of
fifteen on the three-mile course
at Lake Onondaga. The race was
won by the Naval Academy.
Washington and Cal. the other
West Coast representatives, fin
ished third and seventh respec
tively.
Stanford was last off the line
and trailed the pack for the first
half of the race. At that point,
however, they began to move up.
They passed Columbia, Princeton,
Northeastern, Syracuse, Dart
mouth, and MIT in that order.
They seriously challenged Penn
and Cal but were unable to get by
(Continued to column 4)

them before they crossed the fin
ish line.
The Indians stroked the entire
race at a low thirty strokes per
minute. All other crews in the
race with the exception of Cornell
rowed at a higher stroke—32 to
36 strokes per minute.
Coach Will Condon was moder
ately satisfied with the Indians'
"middle of the pack" perform
ance. "Some of the crews we beat
were excellent—MlT in particu
lar. We certainly should have
beaten Perm. Also, had the crew
known that they were so close to
Cal, they would have beaten them
too. All things considered we did
a good job. We were the young
est and the lightest crew in the
race."
This was the first time any
member of the Indian crew had
rowed in a three-mile race. All
races in which Stanford partici
pated on the West Coast were
over a distance of two thousand
meters or about a mile and five
sixteenths.
Varsity Prospects
The prospects for lhis coming
year are excellent. The Varsity
shell loses only one man through
graduation — bowman Gordon
Fast. Senior Dave Robbins, the
excellent stroke who led the Stan
ford crew to its late-season suc
cesses, is expected to sel the pace
for the Tribe again this year. Last
year's most valuable oarsman,
Caplain Larry Hough, should con
tinue to hold down the crucial
number seven seat.
Other returning oarsmen will
be senior Leeds Disston and jun
iors Larry Mcßride, Bill Stump,
and Tim Cowles. Junior Carl
Mundt, who rowed in the number

four position in the IRA crew,
will have an extremely tough
time holding on to his seat since
he will not return from Stanford
in-Austria until the first of April.
Experienced Crew
Coach Condon feels the addi
tional year of experience should
certainly place the Stanford Var
sity near the front at the IRA
this coming June. By that time
the crew will be able to handle
the slightly higher strokes needed
to meet the competition in Syra
cuse. However, Coach Condon has
expressed some concern about the
lack of size on the Indian crew.
"To win the race we will have to
be a little bigger."
He points to the fact that there
are several prospects for beefing
up last year's crew. It is hoped
that Don Rogers will move up
from last year's second varsity.
Jim Madden, Ross Elliott, and
Buck Westphall from the '65
Frosh are all rated serious chal
lengers. Also, Bruce Erickson, a
member of the 1964 Varsity crew,
who was overseas last year, has
an excellent chance to take a port
seat in the first boat.
Condon also expects an excel
lent frosh turn-out this year,
which will give the Indians the
size they need to win them all
in future years.
Rebuilding Program
It is expected that this year
will be the culmination of a re
building program designed to
bring the crew back to its 1957
strength; it finished third in the
IRA that year. This program
was begun three years ago by
Olympian Conn Findlay who was
then varsity coach. Will Condon,

an assistant Director of Financial
Aids here at Stanford, took over
as Varsity coach last year, and
he has continued the program.
Assisting him in the coaching du
ties this year will bo A 1 Miller
who was a coxswain at Princeton
from 3961 to 1964.

The win-loss record of the Stan
ford Varsity has had its ups and
downs over the past fifteen years
—the years from 1958 to 1963
were particularly bleak. How
ever. during this period the Stan
ford program has produced cham
pion international oarsmen more
consistently than any other colle
giate rowing program in the coun
try. Stanford oarsmen have
rowed in two medal - winning
crews in each of the last three
Olympic Games.
In Melbourne in 1956 Stanford
oarsmen won gold medals in both
the pair with and the pair with
out coxswain. In Rome in 1960
Tribe oarsmen rowed in the gold
medal - winning pair with cox
swain. And finally in Tokyo in
1964 Stanford oarsmen rowed in
the gold medal-winning pair with
and the bronze medal - winning
four without, coxswain.

try. Stanford oarsmen have
rowed in two medal - winning
crews in each of the last three
Olympic Games.
In Melbourne in 1956 Stanford
oarsmen won gold medals in both
the pair with and the pair with
out coxswain. In Rome in 1960
Tribe oarsmen rowed in the gold
medal - winning pair with cox
swain. And finally in Tokyo in
1964 Stanford oarsmen rowed in
the gold medal-winning pair with
and the bronze medal - winning
four without, coxswain.

For the first time since 1957,
the Stanford Varsity crew com
peted in the Intercollegiate Row
ing Association Championships in
Syracuse, New York, last June 19.
The Indians finished ninth out of
fifteen on the three-mile course
at Lake Onondaga. The race was
won by the Naval Academy.
Washington and Cal. the other
West Coast representatives, fin
ished third and seventh respec
tively.
Stanford was last off the line
and trailed the pack for the first
half of the race. At that point,
however, they began to move up.
They passed Columbia, Princeton,
Northeastern, Syracuse, Dart
mouth, and MIT in that order.
They seriously challenged Penn
and Cal but were unable to get by
(Continued to column 4)

them before they crossed the fin
ish line.
The Indians stroked the entire
race at a low thirty strokes per
minute. All other crews in the
race with the exception of Cornell
rowed at a higher stroke—32 to
36 strokes per minute.
Coach Will Condon was moder
ately satisfied with the Indians'
"middle of the pack" perform
ance. "Some of the crews we beat
were excellent—MlT in particu
lar. We certainly should have
beaten Perm. Also, had the crew
known that they were so close to
Cal, they would have beaten them
too. All things considered we did
a good job. We were the young
est and the lightest crew in the
race."
This was the first time any
member of the Indian crew had
rowed in a three-mile race. All
races in which Stanford partici
pated on the West Coast were
over a distance of two thousand
meters or about a mile and five
sixteenths.
Varsity Prospects
The prospects for lhis coming
year are excellent. The Varsity
shell loses only one man through
graduation — bowman Gordon
Fast. Senior Dave Robbins, the
excellent stroke who led the Stan
ford crew to its late-season suc
cesses, is expected to sel the pace
for the Tribe again this year. Last
year's most valuable oarsman,
Caplain Larry Hough, should con
tinue to hold down the crucial
number seven seat.
Other returning oarsmen will
be senior Leeds Disston and jun
iors Larry Mcßride, Bill Stump,
and Tim Cowles. Junior Carl
Mundt, who rowed in the number

four position in the IRA crew,
will have an extremely tough
time holding on to his seat since
he will not return from Stanford
in-Austria until the first of April.
Experienced Crew
Coach Condon feels the addi
tional year of experience should
certainly place the Stanford Var
sity near the front at the IRA
this coming June. By that time
the crew will be able to handle
the slightly higher strokes needed
to meet the competition in Syra
cuse. However, Coach Condon has
expressed some concern about the
lack of size on the Indian crew.
"To win the race we will have to
be a little bigger."
He points to the fact that there
are several prospects for beefing
up last year's crew. It is hoped
that Don Rogers will move up
from last year's second varsity.
Jim Madden, Ross Elliott, and
Buck Westphall from the '65
Frosh are all rated serious chal
lengers. Also, Bruce Erickson, a
member of the 1964 Varsity crew,
who was overseas last year, has
an excellent chance to take a port
seat in the first boat.
Condon also expects an excel
lent frosh turn-out this year,
which will give the Indians the
size they need to win them all
in future years.
Rebuilding Program
It is expected that this year
will be the culmination of a re
building program designed to
bring the crew back to its 1957
strength; it finished third in the
IRA that year. This program
was begun three years ago by
Olympian Conn Findlay who was
then varsity coach. Will Condon,

an assistant Director of Financial
Aids here at Stanford, took over
as Varsity coach last year, and
he has continued the program.
Assisting him in the coaching du
ties this year will bo A 1 Miller
who was a coxswain at Princeton
from 3961 to 1964.

then varsity coach. Will Condon,

an assistant Director of Financial
Aids here at Stanford, took over

The win-loss record of the Stan
ford Varsity has had its ups and
downs over the past fifteen years
—the years from 1958 to 1963
were particularly bleak. How
ever. during this period the Stan
ford program has produced cham
pion international oarsmen more
consistently than any other colle
giate rowing program in the coun
try. Stanford oarsmen have
rowed in two medal - winning
crews in each of the last three
Olympic Games.
In Melbourne in 1956 Stanford
oarsmen won gold medals in both
the pair with and the pair with
out coxswain. In Rome in 1960
Tribe oarsmen rowed in the gold
medal - winning pair with cox
swain. And finally in Tokyo in
1964 Stanford oarsmen rowed in
the gold medal-winning pair with
and the bronze medal - winning
four without, coxswain.

For the first time since 1957,
the Stanford Varsity crew com
peted in the Intercollegiate Row
ing Association Championships in
Syracuse, New York, last June 19.
The Indians finished ninth out of
fifteen on the three-mile course
at Lake Onondaga. The race was
won by the Naval Academy.
Washington and Cal. the other
West Coast representatives, fin
ished third and seventh respec
tively.
Stanford was last off the line
and trailed the pack for the first
half of the race. At that point,
however, they began to move up.
They passed Columbia, Princeton,
Northeastern, Syracuse, Dart
mouth, and MIT in that order.
They seriously challenged Penn
and Cal but were unable to get by
(Continued to column 4)

them before they crossed the fin
ish line.
The Indians stroked the entire
race at a low thirty strokes per
minute. All other crews in the
race with the exception of Cornell
rowed at a higher stroke—32 to
36 strokes per minute.
Coach Will Condon was moder
ately satisfied with the Indians'
"middle of the pack" perform
ance. "Some of the crews we beat
were excellent—MlT in particu
lar. We certainly should have
beaten Perm. Also, had the crew
known that they were so close to
Cal, they would have beaten them
too. All things considered we did
a good job. We were the young
est and the lightest crew in the
race."
This was the first time any
member of the Indian crew had
rowed in a three-mile race. All
races in which Stanford partici
pated on the West Coast were
over a distance of two thousand
meters or about a mile and five
sixteenths.
Varsity Prospects
The prospects for lhis coming
year are excellent. The Varsity
shell loses only one man through
graduation — bowman Gordon
Fast. Senior Dave Robbins, the
excellent stroke who led the Stan
ford crew to its late-season suc
cesses, is expected to sel the pace
for the Tribe again this year. Last
year's most valuable oarsman,
Caplain Larry Hough, should con
tinue to hold down the crucial
number seven seat.
Other returning oarsmen will
be senior Leeds Disston and jun
iors Larry Mcßride, Bill Stump,
and Tim Cowles. Junior Carl
Mundt, who rowed in the number

four position in the IRA crew,
will have an extremely tough
time holding on to his seat since
he will not return from Stanford
in-Austria until the first of April.
Experienced Crew
Coach Condon feels the addi
tional year of experience should
certainly place the Stanford Var
sity near the front at the IRA
this coming June. By that time
the crew will be able to handle
the slightly higher strokes needed
to meet the competition in Syra
cuse. However, Coach Condon has
expressed some concern about the
lack of size on the Indian crew.
"To win the race we will have to
be a little bigger."
He points to the fact that there
are several prospects for beefing
up last year's crew. It is hoped
that Don Rogers will move up
from last year's second varsity.
Jim Madden, Ross Elliott, and
Buck Westphall from the '65
Frosh are all rated serious chal
lengers. Also, Bruce Erickson, a
member of the 1964 Varsity crew,
who was overseas last year, has
an excellent chance to take a port
seat in the first boat.
Condon also expects an excel
lent frosh turn-out this year,
which will give the Indians the
size they need to win them all
in future years.
Rebuilding Program
It is expected that this year
will be the culmination of a re
building program designed to
bring the crew back to its 1957
strength; it finished third in the
IRA that year. This program
was begun three years ago by
Olympian Conn Findlay who was
then varsity coach. Will Condon,

an assistant Director of Financial
