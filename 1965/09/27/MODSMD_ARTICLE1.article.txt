# President Sets Forth This Year's Goals
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
For the procedural efficiency of the Univer
sity as well as to bring to being an integral
part of the total educational experience, stu
dents should actively participate in the de
cision-making processes of the University
community.
This is the credo of William "Sandy" Mac
kenzie, President of the Associated Students,
who will seek this year to implement these
beliefs by returning governmental initiative to
the executive.
"The student has a tremendous potential in
the University community but also a great
responsibility to involve himself in the com
munity and in the educational processes and
policies he is subjected to," Mackenzie told
The Daily in an interview yesterday."The
executive branch of student government will
serve as an umbrella organization under
which all groups may find support and eit»
couragement."
Student Participation
Three areas in which he foresees student
participation this year are advisory commit

tees to University President Wallace Sterling,
student-faculty committees on academic af
fais, and the Committee of Fifteen, a tri-par
tite group of administration, faculty, and stu
dents formed last spring to negotiate the
judicial competence compromise.
Student participation on Presidential Ad
visory Committees began three years ago
under the initiative of student body president
Armin Rosencranz and was met with a mostly
favorable response by the participating mem
bers of the faculty and administration.
Student membership on the committees was
reduced the following year; at the samp time
the selection procedure was surprisingly
changed to partially ignore the recommenda
tions of the student body president, then Bud
Wedin.
The procedure this year will be for Macken
zie to nominate two students for each post.
After the list has been approved by the Leg
islature it will be sent to the President who
will select the members of the committees.
Membership on Mackenzie's list of students
will be determined by interview. The inter
viewing committee will include Mackenzie.

vice president Clark Brown, members of LAS
SU Ilmar Waldner and Tim Haiglit, and Dave
Robbins, runner-up in the presidential voting
last spring and now administrative assistant
to Mackenzie.
Stu-Fac Committees
Mackenzie is initiating student involvement
with faculty on academic matters in two ways.
First, student-faculty liaison committees or
ganized by department have been set up in
the history department and' with the library.
Arrangements are being tq have similar ar
rangements with the departments of biology,
English, and philosophy.
Under the leadership of Clark Brown, stu
dents worked during the summer on research
relevant to library policies. In the history de
partment size and diversity have made change
and re-evaluation of policies difficult. It is
hoped that the committee will investigate
major requirements and the history honors
program, as well as other issues.
Students working on these committees will
be selected for their "strong personal interest
in a specific field," as well as their outstand
ing academic records.

"Coordinating this student involvement is
one of the most important functions of stu
dent government; Ihese committees will rep
resent student-faculty cooperation hi an area
of valid concern.
"The results should be beneficial. As with
all activities of student government, this is
being undertaken for the betterment of the
University for the student and for the Uni
versity it self," Mackenzie believes.
Academic Committees
Mackenzie would also like to see student
participation on committees of the Academic
Council, such as those on admissions, libra
lies, and general studies. "If just for strictly
practical reasons of implementation, a deci
sion becomes more viable if all groups being
affected are included in the decisionmaking
process," ho states.
A third area of hope for Mackenzie is the
Committee of Fifteen. It was the student un
derstanding last spring that the Committee
of Fifteen mechanism—five students, five fac
ulty members, five administrators meeting to
negotiate on an issue of wide disagreement—
would be reconstituted as the basic structure

for discussion whenever an issue arose. Any
constituent would be able to raise an issue.
Specifically, Mackenzie would like to see
the review of the liquor policy announced re
cently and to be begun this quarter to be
handled by the Committee of Fifteen rather
than the Presidential Advisory Committee on
Student Affairs and Services.
"It would seem most efficient," Mackenzie
believes, "that a policy of deep concern to all
elements in the community be brought before
a committee constituted by representatives of
all three parts of the University and one with
negotiating rather than mere advisory func
tions."
Formulating Pulley
"It makes little sense to establish rules over
people who have no say in the formulating of
those rules, especially if there is wide and
serious disagreement on the issue being reg
ulated. Subsequent friction and disregard of
rules can be avoided if all members subjected
to the decision are given a part in formulat
ing policy.
"The administration has the responsibility
of enforcing policy. On the matter of liquor,
it has not lived up to this responsibility."

ulty members, five administrators meeting to
negotiate on an issue of wide disagreement—
would be reconstituted as the basic structure

for discussion whenever an issue arose. Any
constituent would be able to raise an issue.
Specifically, Mackenzie would like to see
the review of the liquor policy announced re
cently and to be begun this quarter to be
handled by the Committee of Fifteen rather
than the Presidential Advisory Committee on
Student Affairs and Services.
"It would seem most efficient," Mackenzie
believes, "that a policy of deep concern to all
elements in the community be brought before
a committee constituted by representatives of
all three parts of the University and one with
negotiating rather than mere advisory func
tions."
Formulating Pulley
"It makes little sense to establish rules over
people who have no say in the formulating of
those rules, especially if there is wide and
serious disagreement on the issue being reg
ulated. Subsequent friction and disregard of
rules can be avoided if all members subjected
to the decision are given a part in formulat
ing policy.
"The administration has the responsibility
of enforcing policy. On the matter of liquor,
it has not lived up to this responsibility."
For the procedural efficiency of the Univer
sity as well as to bring to being an integral
part of the total educational experience, stu
dents should actively participate in the de
cision-making processes of the University
community.
This is the credo of William "Sandy" Mac
kenzie, President of the Associated Students,
who will seek this year to implement these
beliefs by returning governmental initiative to
the executive.
"The student has a tremendous potential in
the University community but also a great
responsibility to involve himself in the com
munity and in the educational processes and
policies he is subjected to," Mackenzie told
The Daily in an interview yesterday."The
executive branch of student government will
serve as an umbrella organization under
which all groups may find support and eit»
couragement."
Student Participation
Three areas in which he foresees student
participation this year are advisory commit

tees to University President Wallace Sterling,
student-faculty committees on academic af
fais, and the Committee of Fifteen, a tri-par
tite group of administration, faculty, and stu
dents formed last spring to negotiate the
judicial competence compromise.
Student participation on Presidential Ad
visory Committees began three years ago
under the initiative of student body president
Armin Rosencranz and was met with a mostly
favorable response by the participating mem
bers of the faculty and administration.
Student membership on the committees was
reduced the following year; at the samp time
the selection procedure was surprisingly
changed to partially ignore the recommenda
tions of the student body president, then Bud
Wedin.
The procedure this year will be for Macken
zie to nominate two students for each post.
After the list has been approved by the Leg
islature it will be sent to the President who
will select the members of the committees.
Membership on Mackenzie's list of students
will be determined by interview. The inter
viewing committee will include Mackenzie.

vice president Clark Brown, members of LAS
SU Ilmar Waldner and Tim Haiglit, and Dave
Robbins, runner-up in the presidential voting
last spring and now administrative assistant
to Mackenzie.
Stu-Fac Committees
Mackenzie is initiating student involvement
with faculty on academic matters in two ways.
First, student-faculty liaison committees or
ganized by department have been set up in
the history department and' with the library.
Arrangements are being tq have similar ar
rangements with the departments of biology,
English, and philosophy.
Under the leadership of Clark Brown, stu
dents worked during the summer on research
relevant to library policies. In the history de
partment size and diversity have made change
and re-evaluation of policies difficult. It is
hoped that the committee will investigate
major requirements and the history honors
program, as well as other issues.
Students working on these committees will
be selected for their "strong personal interest
in a specific field," as well as their outstand
ing academic records.

"Coordinating this student involvement is
one of the most important functions of stu
dent government; Ihese committees will rep
resent student-faculty cooperation hi an area
of valid concern.
"The results should be beneficial. As with
all activities of student government, this is
being undertaken for the betterment of the
University for the student and for the Uni
versity it self," Mackenzie believes.
Academic Committees
Mackenzie would also like to see student
participation on committees of the Academic
Council, such as those on admissions, libra
lies, and general studies. "If just for strictly
practical reasons of implementation, a deci
sion becomes more viable if all groups being
affected are included in the decisionmaking
process," ho states.
A third area of hope for Mackenzie is the
Committee of Fifteen. It was the student un
derstanding last spring that the Committee

major requirements and the history honors
program, as well as other issues.
Students working on these committees will
be selected for their "strong personal interest
in a specific field," as well as their outstand
ing academic records.

"Coordinating this student involvement is
one of the most important functions of stu
dent government; Ihese committees will rep
resent student-faculty cooperation hi an area
of valid concern.
"The results should be beneficial. As with
all activities of student government, this is
being undertaken for the betterment of the
University for the student and for the Uni
versity it self," Mackenzie believes.
Academic Committees
Mackenzie would also like to see student
participation on committees of the Academic
Council, such as those on admissions, libra
lies, and general studies. "If just for strictly
practical reasons of implementation, a deci
sion becomes more viable if all groups being
affected are included in the decisionmaking
process," ho states.
A third area of hope for Mackenzie is the
Committee of Fifteen. It was the student un
derstanding last spring that the Committee
of Fifteen mechanism—five students, five fac
ulty members, five administrators meeting to
negotiate on an issue of wide disagreement—
would be reconstituted as the basic structure

for discussion whenever an issue arose. Any
constituent would be able to raise an issue.
Specifically, Mackenzie would like to see
the review of the liquor policy announced re
cently and to be begun this quarter to be
handled by the Committee of Fifteen rather
than the Presidential Advisory Committee on
Student Affairs and Services.
"It would seem most efficient," Mackenzie
believes, "that a policy of deep concern to all
elements in the community be brought before
a committee constituted by representatives of
all three parts of the University and one with
negotiating rather than mere advisory func
tions."
Formulating Pulley
"It makes little sense to establish rules over
people who have no say in the formulating of
those rules, especially if there is wide and
serious disagreement on the issue being reg
ulated. Subsequent friction and disregard of
rules can be avoided if all members subjected
to the decision are given a part in formulat
ing policy.
"The administration has the responsibility
of enforcing policy. On the matter of liquor,
it has not lived up to this responsibility."
For the procedural efficiency of the Univer
sity as well as to bring to being an integral
part of the total educational experience, stu
dents should actively participate in the de
cision-making processes of the University
community.
This is the credo of William "Sandy" Mac
kenzie, President of the Associated Students,
who will seek this year to implement these
beliefs by returning governmental initiative to
the executive.
"The student has a tremendous potential in
the University community but also a great
responsibility to involve himself in the com
munity and in the educational processes and
policies he is subjected to," Mackenzie told
The Daily in an interview yesterday."The
executive branch of student government will
serve as an umbrella organization under
which all groups may find support and eit»
couragement."
Student Participation
Three areas in which he foresees student
participation this year are advisory commit

tees to University President Wallace Sterling,
student-faculty committees on academic af
fais, and the Committee of Fifteen, a tri-par
tite group of administration, faculty, and stu
dents formed last spring to negotiate the
judicial competence compromise.
Student participation on Presidential Ad
visory Committees began three years ago
under the initiative of student body president
Armin Rosencranz and was met with a mostly
favorable response by the participating mem
bers of the faculty and administration.
Student membership on the committees was
reduced the following year; at the samp time
the selection procedure was surprisingly
changed to partially ignore the recommenda
tions of the student body president, then Bud
Wedin.
The procedure this year will be for Macken
zie to nominate two students for each post.
After the list has been approved by the Leg
islature it will be sent to the President who
will select the members of the committees.
Membership on Mackenzie's list of students
will be determined by interview. The inter
viewing committee will include Mackenzie.

vice president Clark Brown, members of LAS
SU Ilmar Waldner and Tim Haiglit, and Dave
Robbins, runner-up in the presidential voting
last spring and now administrative assistant
to Mackenzie.
Stu-Fac Committees
Mackenzie is initiating student involvement
with faculty on academic matters in two ways.
First, student-faculty liaison committees or
ganized by department have been set up in
the history department and' with the library.
Arrangements are being tq have similar ar
rangements with the departments of biology,
English, and philosophy.
Under the leadership of Clark Brown, stu
dents worked during the summer on research
relevant to library policies. In the history de
partment size and diversity have made change
and re-evaluation of policies difficult. It is
hoped that the committee will investigate
major requirements and the history honors
program, as well as other issues.
Students working on these committees will
be selected for their "strong personal interest
in a specific field," as well as their outstand
ing academic records.
