Even though registration still
is under way, it's not too soon to
make plane reservations home for
Christmas vacation, the ASSU
travel agency has announced.
Row Hollitz, director of the
student - operated travel service,
said chartered fKghtS were being
arranged to Boston, Chicago, Den
ver, Kansas City, Minneapolis,
New York, Phoenix, Portland, Se
attle, and Washington, D.C.
Hollitz said the agency's offices,
located in the ASSU office in
Tresidder, are open Monday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to
3 p.m.
"We're basically a service or
ganization," Hollitz said. He said
the agency was established "to
avoid another Gerry Davis fiasco
which left many Stanford stu
dents stranded in Europe and
New York."
The "Davis fiasco" Hollitz re
ferred to happened in the summer
of 1963. Davis, a local travel
agent, had organized chartered
flights between the United States
and Europe. He used non-sched
uled airlines, and many students
were left stranded when the
flights were canceled.
The ASSU-chartered flights all
are on scheduled airlines, and
tickets are sold at savings of up
to 40 per cent, Hollitz said.
