# Branner and Roble Halls Redecorated
## 
### 

STANFORD'S TWO FRESHMAN women's dorms, Branner and Roble Halls, underwent extensive
redecoration this summer.
The electrical wiring in both dorms was redone. Carpeting was laid in all the corridors and
the corridor walls were covered with vinyl. All student rooms were refurnished.
The Branner rooms are refurnished in white Italian provincial and the Roble rooms are done in
traditional American oak. In both dorms the rooms have been furnished with bookshelves.
The Branner lobby, dining room, and lounge, shown above, have been completely redone.
The large round dining tables that sat ten people have been replaced by small tables seating be
tween four and eight. The Branner lobby, done in blues and greens, was recarpeted and has
new draperies and furniture.
Roble also has new dining furniture and its two dining rooms have been carpeted. The
lighting in the dining rooms of both dorms was redone to allow varied brightness.
