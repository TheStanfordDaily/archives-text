# Center Helps Foreigners Acclimatize
## 
### 
Approximately 200 of the more
than 800 foreign students regis
tering at Stanford this year have
arrived and begun to be familiar
ized with Stanford through the
Bechtel International Center's
Home Stay Program.
Mrs. Robert Sims of the Com
munity Committee for Interna
tional Students explained that the
program finds families with
which the new students can stay
for ten days. "They pick them up
at the airport, dock, or train sta
tion, then help them to get set
tled in the new environment," she
said.
The families are all chosen from
volunteers, Mrs. Sims said, and
most are happy to repeat year
after year. "They find that con
tinuing contacts with these stu
dents are as gratifying experi
ences for them as for the students
themselves."
Welcome
The students and their wives
are aided in looking for apart
ments, cars or bicycles and other
necessities. "But," Mrs. Sims
stated, "they are also welcomed to
be a part ol' the families with
which they stay, participating in
the normal activities of those
families." Early this week, many
of the students went to swimming
parties at the homes of various
sponsor families.
A number of the married stu
dents have small children, and in
such cases, the Stanford Interna
tional Dames (foreign stude'nt
wives who have already lived in
the area some time) usually assist
the mothers in caring for the
children and finding suitable
apartments.
