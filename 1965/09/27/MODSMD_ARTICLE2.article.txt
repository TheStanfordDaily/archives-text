"This environment (of the uni

greatest personal and intellectual
freedom you can expect to enjoy
during your lifetiine.
Academic Freedom
You have the freedom to ex-j

freedom to examine in a fresh i

notions and values, and the free-j
«(iom to leisurely ponder your
prospective role in the world com

Student Action
"And Stanford is a university j
where student action has been j
primarily instrumental in secur- j
ing for student groups tlie right 1
to express their opinions on all j
matters, both on and off ihe cam
pus—where that right did not ex
ist before; in securing for reli
gious groups the right to meet
on campus—when they were pre
viously not allowed to do so; in
achieving just last year a major
liberalization of women's social
regulations; and of initiating an
investigation into the judicial
process and the rights of students
within that process an investi
gation that is at present still un
der way. . . .
"You are not a passive clement
in the educational process. You
cannot allow yourselves to be
marionettes who can be dangled
through an education. If you do
not yourself assume a good deal
of responsibility for the direction
of your education, if you do not
take the leading role in your own
development, if you do not seize
control of your destiny with vigor
and determination, then you will
have cheated yourseelf and your
university.
"These four years are a time to
make significant headway in
what is often called self-fulfill
ment. This is a process which in
volves considerably more than
the successful accumulation of a
large body of factual information
neatly compartmentalized by sub
ject matter in a tidy brain.
"This is a process dealing not
only with intellectual questions
but also with moral ones, and,
with what is perhaps the most
difficult task of all, that of learn
ing to successfully integrate in
tellectual and moral decisions so
as to act in concert both with
most incisive intellectual analysis
of a given problem.
"Are you prepared to give more

Rebellion
"Are you fully aware that re
bellion Is as much a part of our
heritage as the seeking of com
promise and consensus? One of
the greatest student rebellions in
America has just taken place 40
miles up the Bay at Berkeley and
is in fact still taking place there
and throughout schools across
the country that recognize the
importance of the events that
happened there last fall.
"It is a rebellion that is chal
lenging and asking for justifica
tion not only of rules governing

student political activity on a
I given campus, but also of tenets
of the philosophy of education of
'a major university system. The
l concepts being questioned and
the institutions under attack in
that revolution are in many re
spects similar to the concepts and
institutions of the society as a
whole in which that university
exists.
"Some people feel the Univer
sity of California was irrevocably
damaged by the turbulence which
took place there. Ait* you pre
pared to affirm or to deny the
theory that there can bo no prog

"We are living in an age whose

individuals. You cannot confine
your horizons to a fully pr
scribed study list or to a list of
narrow, predetermined goals.
Future of World
"The future of the world to
morrow depends upon the stu
dent of today and what he is do
ing light now, what sort of re
sponsibilities he is assuming, and
to whom or to what he feels re

"We must not remain inactive
for fear of making mistakes.
There is no doubt that we wf

the institutions under attack in
that revolution are in many re

institutions of the society as a

Future of World

So declared student body presi-1
dent William "Sandy" Mackenzie i
in an address to the freshmen
,'ast Friday morning in Memorial j
Auditorium. The greater portion
of his speech follows.
"This environment (of the uni
versity ) affo r d s perhaps the
greatest personal and intellectual
freedom you can expect to enjoy
during your lifetiine.
Academic Freedom
You have the freedom to ex-j
plore and sample the ideas of di
verse academic disciplines, the 1
freedom to examine in a fresh i
atmosphere your own traditional
notions and values, and the free-j
«(iom to leisurely ponder your
prospective role in the world com
munity.
"This is the very purpose of !
higher education. It is a purpose
that transcends preparing you for
a vocation or producing just an j
educated citizen for your commit-;
nity. It is the purpose of bring
ing about the greatest possible
personal development of the total
individual. . . .
"This is a university which has
been fortunate to have bad as its
President a man such as Dr. Ster
ling whose leadership and deter
mination have produced one of'
the finest, physical facilities and i
have gathered one of the most re-j
spected faculties in American uni
versities. This in turn has at- j
tracted an exceptional student \
body.
"This is a university where j
soon nearly one-half of the under
graduates will have studied in I
Europe before they receive their j
degrees.
"This is the university which |
ranks first among large imiversi- j
ties for Peace Corps volunteers i
per thousand students enrolled, j
"This is a university whose j
students have been among the j
foremost in America in participa- j
lion in civil rights and social serv-;
ice projects in Mississippi, Hong
Kong, Mexico, Africa, Peru, and !
California's Central Valley.
Student Action
"And Stanford is a university j
where student action has been j
primarily instrumental in secur- j
ing for student groups tlie right 1
to express their opinions on all j
matters, both on and off ihe cam
pus—where that right did not ex
ist before; in securing for reli
gious groups the right to meet
on campus—when they were pre
viously not allowed to do so; in
achieving just last year a major
liberalization of women's social
regulations; and of initiating an
investigation into the judicial
process and the rights of students
within that process an investi
gation that is at present still un
der way. . . .
"You are not a passive clement
in the educational process. You
cannot allow yourselves to be
marionettes who can be dangled
through an education. If you do
not yourself assume a good deal
of responsibility for the direction
of your education, if you do not
take the leading role in your own
development, if you do not seize
control of your destiny with vigor
and determination, then you will
have cheated yourseelf and your
university.
"These four years are a time to
make significant headway in
what is often called self-fulfill
ment. This is a process which in
volves considerably more than
the successful accumulation of a
large body of factual information
neatly compartmentalized by sub
ject matter in a tidy brain.
"This is a process dealing not
only with intellectual questions
but also with moral ones, and,
with what is perhaps the most
difficult task of all, that of learn
ing to successfully integrate in
tellectual and moral decisions so
as to act in concert both with
most incisive intellectual analysis
of a given problem.
"Are you prepared to give more
than passing notice to Ralph El
lison's statement: The only way
to get along is to lie, to tell peo
ple what they want to hear'?
Rebellion
"Are you fully aware that re
bellion Is as much a part of our
heritage as the seeking of com
promise and consensus? One of
the greatest student rebellions in
America has just taken place 40
miles up the Bay at Berkeley and
is in fact still taking place there
