## Traditional Miscues Continue to Muddle Indian Endeavor for Gridiron Greatness 
### BOB THIERIOT JOE HERNANDEZ 
Following are two views on
Stanford's early season football
prowess. Itolxrt Thieriot drals
with the San Jose contest while
Joe Hernandez analyzes the
Navy game.

For the first season in many,
Stanford has a real football team.
Those who have been stalwart
Stanford rooters for the past ten
years have been waving their
Cardinal banners in complete des
peration and seldom in victory.
But, faithful followers, take up
that tattered banner and wave it,
at least in great expectation, for
this is your year. Stanford has
been rated by most authorities
(Look, Sports Illustrated, Play
boy magazines) to be among the
nation's top twenty.
At times last season the In
dians came up with sterling per
formances to upset opponents.
Stanford only won five games
last season; out of these, throe
were definite upsets. The Cards
even wrecke d Oregon State,
which eventually ended up in the
Rose Bowl. SUm ford also has

three potential All-Americans this
season—quarterback Dave Lewis,
halfback Ray Handley and tacklc
Garr Pettigrew. Not since John
Brodie have the Indians had such
class in the backfield. With a few
notable exceptions the Indians
have most of their vital stars
back from last year, so things
really do look very rosy (as in
bowl I.
Fatal Frrors
Those ten-year banner-wavers
can tell numerous stories about
how Stanford has often come
close, only to lose because of mis
cues. Last season could have
been considerably brighter, could
someone have not fumbled, been
off-side, or thrown an intercep
tion at the most crucial possible
moment. The upset of Oregon
State was notable for the fact
that Stanford was penalized only
five yards, had no interceptions
or fumbles. This type of game
has been extremely rare for
Stanford football.
Stanford rooters had become
very accustomed to the steady
flow of fumbles and interceptions
with a penalty thrown in, so to
relieve their constant misery,
they devised a special cheer to

follow the error which starts with
a long Oh (about seven seconds).
Apparently the football team did
not get the message for the mis
takes continued, and so did the
cheer. If Stanford does not play
up to its potential this year, the
cheer will ring through the
streets of Palo Alto on Saturday
afternoons this fall.
Ix)st Stars
Stanford has two very impor
tant. games this year. Victories
in both the USC and Washington
games would virtually assure a
trip south after Christmas this
winter. However, the loss of such
stars as golden-toed Braden Beck,
tackle-happy Jack Chappie, and
useful-everywhere Dick Ragsdale
doesn't help the situation any.
Without Beck maybe the team
will even work a little harder for
the end zone, rather than depend
on three points.
The Irreplaceable*
Chappie and Ragsdale are ir
replaceable. The guys who have
to fill their positions have a real
.job of filling to do. But the real
problem isn't filling, it's those
nagging mistakes.
The Indians made a poor start
in the San Jose game. Read fum
bled on the San Jose 3—scratch
one shutout.
An off-side penalty called back
one touchdown, which resulted in
only a field goal by Terry DeSyl
via. That's 15 points right there
that can be attributed to mis
takes. Possibly, though, this
year's team is so good that they
can make the usual mistakes and
get away with it. Either that or
San Jose was just incredibly
jx>or.
Regardless, it will save banner
wavers and Stanford students
many trying hours if the football
team would just play somewhat
errorless football and win that
way. It would also make those
people in Palo Alto very happy
on Saturday afternoons this fall.

Thriving on the fumble, the
pass interception, and mental
mistakes, the black plague of
more than one football coach has
again reared its infamous head
on the Farm. Every coach fights
tooth and nail to combat this
dread disease for if he fails and
his population of victories is 100
severely decimated, then his little
kingdom must collapse.
Last year this malicious mal
ady, misrueitis, managed to slip
into Stanford Stadium with the
Trojan Warhorses. The result
was a real giveaway; a fumble
here and a mistake there gave
USC a 15-10 win. But that's last
season a closed case.
Alas, some observers thoughi
they detected just a touch of mis
cueitis against San Jose this year.
No one was calling for help, how
ever. Then the Navy came to
town, and someone forgot to
quarantine them.
Recurrence
The weekend before while the
Indians were battling the Spar
tans, the Midshipmen were fight-

ing a full-scale attack of miscue
it is. Against Syracuse, they were
hit with five interceptions. Navy
got rid of it 1 hough. They gave it
1o Stanford.
In the first quarter, Stanford
moved 29 yards in four plays,
and quite a few of the 52.000 peo
ple in the stadium had the glint
of optimism in their oye. How
ever, it must have been a weak
gleam, because it didn't reach the
field.
On the next play, sometimes
spectacular quarterback Dave
Lewis fired a pretty down-and-in
pass to Ray Handley who was go
ing down and out. A Navy de
fender intercepted, and fourteen
plays later, Navy scored.
Stanford looked like it was on
the move in the second quarter
when the Indians moved from
their own 31 to the Navy 18. But
one yard short of a first down,
a line plunge and a pass out of
the end zone netted minus one
yard.
With three fast backs, the end
sweep and roll-out have been two
of the Tribe's most effective
weapons. Yet you can't score ev
ery time you are inside the 20.
Although, my old high school
coach (his six-year record is 56-8-
1) says that the area from the
goal line to the 20 is the eham

pionship zone, and if you can't
score from there something is
awry.
Stalwart Defense
The Stanford defense, which
did a fine job all afternoon even
without star Gary Pettlgrew, held
Navy. A 1 Wilburn raced the
Navy punter for the ball when
the snap got past him, and ap
plied a crushing tackle just as
lie was booting it. With the ball
on the 21, StanfoiU moved 20
yards without a hitch. Lewis
cracked into the end zone for an
apparent touchdown; unfortu
nately, he forgot the ball. Navy
recovered, of course, and the half
ended soon afterward.
The Indians looked like they
were on the move again in the
second half when suddenly they
were confronted with a third and
19 situation. Everyone went right
except for a blocker, a tackier,
and Lewis. With a clear lane
down the left side, Lewis stopped
and tossed a cross-field pass to a
receiver 1.1 yards downfield and
surrounded by the foe. The pass
was expectedly intercepted. The
next time the Tribe got the ball,
it was on their own 20.
When in Doubt —
The first two times the Indians
had the ball in the fourth quar
ter left sideline buffs wondering
what the pre-game plan had been.
With eight minutes and 43 sec
onds left in the game and a
fourth and 3 situation on the
Navy 27, a 10-yard pass into the
middle was broken up by two or
three defenders. A sweep might
not have worked either, though.
The next series of'downs Stan
ford had a third and 4 situation
at midfield. A dive Jfrito the mid
dle of the Navy line gained noth
ing. Then again, you can't run a
sweep every time.
The game ended on an ironic
note. After a desperation pass
failed by a hair, two backs bob
bled the ball which was finally
recovered by a sure-fingered in
terior lineman.

Stanford's early season football

nately, he forgot the ball. Navy
recovered, of course, and the half
ended soon afterward.
The Indians looked like they
were on the move again in the
second half when suddenly they
were confronted with a third and
19 situation. Everyone went right
except for a blocker, a tackier,
and Lewis. With a clear lane
down the left side, Lewis stopped
and tossed a cross-field pass to a
receiver 1.1 yards downfield and
surrounded by the foe. The pass
was expectedly intercepted. The
next time the Tribe got the ball,
it was on their own 20.
When in Doubt —
The first two times the Indians
had the ball in the fourth quar
ter left sideline buffs wondering
what the pre-game plan had been.
With eight minutes and 43 sec
onds left in the game and a
fourth and 3 situation on the
Navy 27, a 10-yard pass into the
middle was broken up by two or
three defenders. A sweep might
not have worked either, though.
The next series of'downs Stan
ford had a third and 4 situation
at midfield. A dive Jfrito the mid
dle of the Navy line gained noth
ing. Then again, you can't run a
sweep every time.
The game ended on an ironic
note. After a desperation pass
failed by a hair, two backs bob
bled the ball which was finally
recovered by a sure-fingered in
terior lineman.
Following are two views on
Stanford's early season football
prowess. Itolxrt Thieriot drals
with the San Jose contest while
Joe Hernandez analyzes the
Navy game.

For the first season in many,
Stanford has a real football team.
Those who have been stalwart
Stanford rooters for the past ten
years have been waving their
Cardinal banners in complete des
peration and seldom in victory.
But, faithful followers, take up
that tattered banner and wave it,
at least in great expectation, for
this is your year. Stanford has
been rated by most authorities
(Look, Sports Illustrated, Play
boy magazines) to be among the
nation's top twenty.
At times last season the In
dians came up with sterling per
formances to upset opponents.
Stanford only won five games
last season; out of these, throe
were definite upsets. The Cards
even wrecke d Oregon State,
which eventually ended up in the
Rose Bowl. SUm ford also has

three potential All-Americans this
season—quarterback Dave Lewis,
halfback Ray Handley and tacklc
Garr Pettigrew. Not since John
Brodie have the Indians had such
class in the backfield. With a few
notable exceptions the Indians
have most of their vital stars
back from last year, so things
really do look very rosy (as in
bowl I.
Fatal Frrors
Those ten-year banner-wavers
can tell numerous stories about
how Stanford has often come
close, only to lose because of mis
cues. Last season could have
been considerably brighter, could
someone have not fumbled, been
off-side, or thrown an intercep
tion at the most crucial possible
moment. The upset of Oregon
State was notable for the fact
that Stanford was penalized only
five yards, had no interceptions
or fumbles. This type of game
has been extremely rare for
Stanford football.
Stanford rooters had become
very accustomed to the steady
flow of fumbles and interceptions
with a penalty thrown in, so to
relieve their constant misery,
they devised a special cheer to

follow the error which starts with
a long Oh (about seven seconds).
Apparently the football team did
not get the message for the mis
takes continued, and so did the
cheer. If Stanford does not play
up to its potential this year, the
cheer will ring through the
streets of Palo Alto on Saturday
afternoons this fall.
Ix)st Stars
Stanford has two very impor
tant. games this year. Victories
in both the USC and Washington
games would virtually assure a
trip south after Christmas this
winter. However, the loss of such
stars as golden-toed Braden Beck,
tackle-happy Jack Chappie, and
useful-everywhere Dick Ragsdale
doesn't help the situation any.
Without Beck maybe the team
will even work a little harder for
the end zone, rather than depend
on three points.
The Irreplaceable*
Chappie and Ragsdale are ir
replaceable. The guys who have
to fill their positions have a real
.job of filling to do. But the real
problem isn't filling, it's those
nagging mistakes.
The Indians made a poor start
in the San Jose game. Read fum
bled on the San Jose 3—scratch
one shutout.
An off-side penalty called back
one touchdown, which resulted in
only a field goal by Terry DeSyl
via. That's 15 points right there
that can be attributed to mis
takes. Possibly, though, this
year's team is so good that they
can make the usual mistakes and
get away with it. Either that or
San Jose was just incredibly
jx>or.
Regardless, it will save banner
wavers and Stanford students
many trying hours if the football
team would just play somewhat
errorless football and win that
way. It would also make those
people in Palo Alto very happy
on Saturday afternoons this fall.

Thriving on the fumble, the
pass interception, and mental
mistakes, the black plague of
more than one football coach has
again reared its infamous head
on the Farm. Every coach fights
tooth and nail to combat this
dread disease for if he fails and
his population of victories is 100
severely decimated, then his little
kingdom must collapse.
Last year this malicious mal
ady, misrueitis, managed to slip
into Stanford Stadium with the
Trojan Warhorses. The result
was a real giveaway; a fumble
here and a mistake there gave
USC a 15-10 win. But that's last
season a closed case.
Alas, some observers thoughi
they detected just a touch of mis
cueitis against San Jose this year.
No one was calling for help, how
ever. Then the Navy came to
town, and someone forgot to
quarantine them.
Recurrence
The weekend before while the
Indians were battling the Spar
tans, the Midshipmen were fight-

ing a full-scale attack of miscue
it is. Against Syracuse, they were
hit with five interceptions. Navy
got rid of it 1 hough. They gave it
1o Stanford.
In the first quarter, Stanford
moved 29 yards in four plays,
and quite a few of the 52.000 peo
ple in the stadium had the glint
of optimism in their oye. How
ever, it must have been a weak
gleam, because it didn't reach the
field.
On the next play, sometimes
spectacular quarterback Dave
Lewis fired a pretty down-and-in
pass to Ray Handley who was go
ing down and out. A Navy de
fender intercepted, and fourteen
plays later, Navy scored.
Stanford looked like it was on
the move in the second quarter
when the Indians moved from
their own 31 to the Navy 18. But
one yard short of a first down,
a line plunge and a pass out of
the end zone netted minus one
yard.
With three fast backs, the end
sweep and roll-out have been two
of the Tribe's most effective
weapons. Yet you can't score ev
ery time you are inside the 20.
Although, my old high school
coach (his six-year record is 56-8-
1) says that the area from the
goal line to the 20 is the eham

pionship zone, and if you can't
score from there something is
awry.
Stalwart Defense
The Stanford defense, which
did a fine job all afternoon even
without star Gary Pettlgrew, held
Navy. A 1 Wilburn raced the
Navy punter for the ball when
the snap got past him, and ap
plied a crushing tackle just as
lie was booting it. With the ball
on the 21, StanfoiU moved 20
yards without a hitch. Lewis
cracked into the end zone for an
apparent touchdown; unfortu
nately, he forgot the ball. Navy
recovered, of course, and the half
ended soon afterward.
The Indians looked like they

pass to Ray Handley who was go
ing down and out. A Navy de
fender intercepted, and fourteen
plays later, Navy scored.
Stanford looked like it was on
the move in the second quarter
when the Indians moved from
their own 31 to the Navy 18. But
one yard short of a first down,
a line plunge and a pass out of
the end zone netted minus one
yard.
With three fast backs, the end
sweep and roll-out have been two
of the Tribe's most effective
weapons. Yet you can't score ev
ery time you are inside the 20.
Although, my old high school
coach (his six-year record is 56-8-
1) says that the area from the
goal line to the 20 is the eham

pionship zone, and if you can't
score from there something is
awry.
Stalwart Defense
The Stanford defense, which
did a fine job all afternoon even
without star Gary Pettlgrew, held
Navy. A 1 Wilburn raced the
Navy punter for the ball when
the snap got past him, and ap
plied a crushing tackle just as
lie was booting it. With the ball
on the 21, StanfoiU moved 20
yards without a hitch. Lewis
cracked into the end zone for an
apparent touchdown; unfortu
nately, he forgot the ball. Navy
recovered, of course, and the half
ended soon afterward.
The Indians looked like they
were on the move again in the
second half when suddenly they
were confronted with a third and
19 situation. Everyone went right
except for a blocker, a tackier,
and Lewis. With a clear lane
down the left side, Lewis stopped
and tossed a cross-field pass to a
receiver 1.1 yards downfield and
surrounded by the foe. The pass
was expectedly intercepted. The
next time the Tribe got the ball,
it was on their own 20.
When in Doubt —
The first two times the Indians
had the ball in the fourth quar
ter left sideline buffs wondering
what the pre-game plan had been.
With eight minutes and 43 sec
onds left in the game and a
fourth and 3 situation on the
Navy 27, a 10-yard pass into the
middle was broken up by two or
three defenders. A sweep might
not have worked either, though.
The next series of'downs Stan
ford had a third and 4 situation
at midfield. A dive Jfrito the mid
dle of the Navy line gained noth
ing. Then again, you can't run a
sweep every time.
The game ended on an ironic
note. After a desperation pass
failed by a hair, two backs bob
bled the ball which was finally
recovered by a sure-fingered in
terior lineman.
Following are two views on
Stanford's early season football
prowess. Itolxrt Thieriot drals
with the San Jose contest while
Joe Hernandez analyzes the
Navy game.

For the first season in many,
Stanford has a real football team.
Those who have been stalwart
Stanford rooters for the past ten
years have been waving their
Cardinal banners in complete des
peration and seldom in victory.
But, faithful followers, take up
that tattered banner and wave it,
at least in great expectation, for
this is your year. Stanford has
been rated by most authorities
(Look, Sports Illustrated, Play
boy magazines) to be among the
nation's top twenty.
At times last season the In
dians came up with sterling per
formances to upset opponents.
Stanford only won five games
last season; out of these, throe
were definite upsets. The Cards
even wrecke d Oregon State,
which eventually ended up in the
Rose Bowl. SUm ford also has

three potential All-Americans this
season—quarterback Dave Lewis,
halfback Ray Handley and tacklc
Garr Pettigrew. Not since John
Brodie have the Indians had such
class in the backfield. With a few
notable exceptions the Indians
have most of their vital stars
back from last year, so things
really do look very rosy (as in
bowl I.
Fatal Frrors
Those ten-year banner-wavers
can tell numerous stories about
how Stanford has often come
close, only to lose because of mis
cues. Last season could have
been considerably brighter, could
someone have not fumbled, been
off-side, or thrown an intercep
tion at the most crucial possible
moment. The upset of Oregon
State was notable for the fact
that Stanford was penalized only
five yards, had no interceptions
or fumbles. This type of game
has been extremely rare for
Stanford football.
Stanford rooters had become
very accustomed to the steady
flow of fumbles and interceptions
with a penalty thrown in, so to
relieve their constant misery,
they devised a special cheer to

follow the error which starts with
a long Oh (about seven seconds).
Apparently the football team did
not get the message for the mis
takes continued, and so did the
cheer. If Stanford does not play
up to its potential this year, the
cheer will ring through the
streets of Palo Alto on Saturday
afternoons this fall.
Ix)st Stars
Stanford has two very impor
tant. games this year. Victories
in both the USC and Washington
games would virtually assure a
trip south after Christmas this
winter. However, the loss of such
stars as golden-toed Braden Beck,
tackle-happy Jack Chappie, and
useful-everywhere Dick Ragsdale
doesn't help the situation any.
Without Beck maybe the team
will even work a little harder for
the end zone, rather than depend
on three points.
The Irreplaceable*
Chappie and Ragsdale are ir
replaceable. The guys who have
to fill their positions have a real
.job of filling to do. But the real
problem isn't filling, it's those
nagging mistakes.
The Indians made a poor start
in the San Jose game. Read fum
bled on the San Jose 3—scratch
one shutout.
An off-side penalty called back
one touchdown, which resulted in
only a field goal by Terry DeSyl
via. That's 15 points right there
that can be attributed to mis
takes. Possibly, though, this
year's team is so good that they
can make the usual mistakes and
get away with it. Either that or
San Jose was just incredibly
jx>or.
Regardless, it will save banner
wavers and Stanford students
many trying hours if the football
team would just play somewhat
errorless football and win that
way. It would also make those
people in Palo Alto very happy
on Saturday afternoons this fall.

Thriving on the fumble, the
pass interception, and mental
mistakes, the black plague of
more than one football coach has
again reared its infamous head
on the Farm. Every coach fights
tooth and nail to combat this
dread disease for if he fails and
his population of victories is 100
severely decimated, then his little
kingdom must collapse.
Last year this malicious mal
ady, misrueitis, managed to slip
into Stanford Stadium with the
Trojan Warhorses. The result
was a real giveaway; a fumble
here and a mistake there gave
USC a 15-10 win. But that's last
season a closed case.
Alas, some observers thoughi
they detected just a touch of mis
cueitis against San Jose this year.
No one was calling for help, how
ever. Then the Navy came to
town, and someone forgot to
quarantine them.
Recurrence
The weekend before while the
Indians were battling the Spar
tans, the Midshipmen were fight-

ing a full-scale attack of miscue
it is. Against Syracuse, they were
hit with five interceptions. Navy
got rid of it 1 hough. They gave it
1o Stanford.
In the first quarter, Stanford
moved 29 yards in four plays,
and quite a few of the 52.000 peo
ple in the stadium had the glint
of optimism in their oye. How
ever, it must have been a weak
gleam, because it didn't reach the
field.
On the next play, sometimes
spectacular quarterback Dave
Lewis fired a pretty down-and-in
pass to Ray Handley who was go
ing down and out. A Navy de

dread disease for if he fails and
his population of victories is 100
severely decimated, then his little
kingdom must collapse.
Last year this malicious mal
ady, misrueitis, managed to slip
into Stanford Stadium with the
Trojan Warhorses. The result
was a real giveaway; a fumble
here and a mistake there gave
USC a 15-10 win. But that's last
season a closed case.
Alas, some observers thoughi
they detected just a touch of mis
cueitis against San Jose this year.
No one was calling for help, how

town, and someone forgot to
quarantine them.
Recurrence
The weekend before while the
Indians were battling the Spar
tans, the Midshipmen were fight-

ing a full-scale attack of miscue
it is. Against Syracuse, they were
hit with five interceptions. Navy
got rid of it 1 hough. They gave it
1o Stanford.
In the first quarter, Stanford
moved 29 yards in four plays,
and quite a few of the 52.000 peo
ple in the stadium had the glint
of optimism in their oye. How
ever, it must have been a weak
gleam, because it didn't reach the
field.
On the next play, sometimes
spectacular quarterback Dave
Lewis fired a pretty down-and-in
pass to Ray Handley who was go
ing down and out. A Navy de
fender intercepted, and fourteen
plays later, Navy scored.
Stanford looked like it was on
the move in the second quarter
when the Indians moved from
their own 31 to the Navy 18. But
one yard short of a first down,
a line plunge and a pass out of
the end zone netted minus one
yard.
With three fast backs, the end
sweep and roll-out have been two
of the Tribe's most effective
weapons. Yet you can't score ev
ery time you are inside the 20.
Although, my old high school
coach (his six-year record is 56-8-
1) says that the area from the
goal line to the 20 is the eham

pionship zone, and if you can't
score from there something is
awry.
Stalwart Defense
The Stanford defense, which
did a fine job all afternoon even
without star Gary Pettlgrew, held
Navy. A 1 Wilburn raced the
Navy punter for the ball when
the snap got past him, and ap
plied a crushing tackle just as
lie was booting it. With the ball
on the 21, StanfoiU moved 20
yards without a hitch. Lewis
cracked into the end zone for an
apparent touchdown; unfortu
nately, he forgot the ball. Navy
recovered, of course, and the half
ended soon afterward.
The Indians looked like they
were on the move again in the
second half when suddenly they
were confronted with a third and
19 situation. Everyone went right
except for a blocker, a tackier,
and Lewis. With a clear lane
down the left side, Lewis stopped
and tossed a cross-field pass to a
receiver 1.1 yards downfield and
surrounded by the foe. The pass
was expectedly intercepted. The
next time the Tribe got the ball,
it was on their own 20.
When in Doubt —
The first two times the Indians
had the ball in the fourth quar
ter left sideline buffs wondering
what the pre-game plan had been.
With eight minutes and 43 sec
onds left in the game and a
fourth and 3 situation on the
Navy 27, a 10-yard pass into the
middle was broken up by two or
three defenders. A sweep might
not have worked either, though.
The next series of'downs Stan
ford had a third and 4 situation
at midfield. A dive Jfrito the mid
dle of the Navy line gained noth
ing. Then again, you can't run a
sweep every time.
The game ended on an ironic
note. After a desperation pass
failed by a hair, two backs bob
bled the ball which was finally
recovered by a sure-fingered in
terior lineman.
Following are two views on
Stanford's early season football
prowess. Itolxrt Thieriot drals
with the San Jose contest while
Joe Hernandez analyzes the
Navy game.

For the first season in many,
Stanford has a real football team.
Those who have been stalwart
Stanford rooters for the past ten
years have been waving their
Cardinal banners in complete des
peration and seldom in victory.
But, faithful followers, take up
that tattered banner and wave it,
at least in great expectation, for
this is your year. Stanford has
been rated by most authorities
(Look, Sports Illustrated, Play
boy magazines) to be among the
nation's top twenty.
At times last season the In
dians came up with sterling per
formances to upset opponents.
Stanford only won five games
last season; out of these, throe
were definite upsets. The Cards
even wrecke d Oregon State,
which eventually ended up in the
Rose Bowl. SUm ford also has

three potential All-Americans this
season—quarterback Dave Lewis,
halfback Ray Handley and tacklc
Garr Pettigrew. Not since John
Brodie have the Indians had such
class in the backfield. With a few
notable exceptions the Indians
have most of their vital stars
back from last year, so things
really do look very rosy (as in
bowl I.
Fatal Frrors
Those ten-year banner-wavers
can tell numerous stories about
how Stanford has often come
close, only to lose because of mis
cues. Last season could have
been considerably brighter, could
someone have not fumbled, been
off-side, or thrown an intercep
tion at the most crucial possible
moment. The upset of Oregon
State was notable for the fact
that Stanford was penalized only
five yards, had no interceptions
or fumbles. This type of game
has been extremely rare for
Stanford football.
Stanford rooters had become
very accustomed to the steady
flow of fumbles and interceptions
with a penalty thrown in, so to
relieve their constant misery,
they devised a special cheer to

follow the error which starts with
a long Oh (about seven seconds).
Apparently the football team did
not get the message for the mis
takes continued, and so did the
cheer. If Stanford does not play
up to its potential this year, the
cheer will ring through the
streets of Palo Alto on Saturday
afternoons this fall.
Ix)st Stars
Stanford has two very impor
tant. games this year. Victories
in both the USC and Washington
games would virtually assure a
trip south after Christmas this
winter. However, the loss of such
stars as golden-toed Braden Beck,
tackle-happy Jack Chappie, and
useful-everywhere Dick Ragsdale
doesn't help the situation any.
Without Beck maybe the team
will even work a little harder for
the end zone, rather than depend
on three points.
The Irreplaceable*
Chappie and Ragsdale are ir
replaceable. The guys who have
to fill their positions have a real
.job of filling to do. But the real
problem isn't filling, it's those
nagging mistakes.
The Indians made a poor start
in the San Jose game. Read fum
bled on the San Jose 3—scratch
one shutout.
An off-side penalty called back
one touchdown, which resulted in
only a field goal by Terry DeSyl
via. That's 15 points right there
that can be attributed to mis
takes. Possibly, though, this
year's team is so good that they
can make the usual mistakes and
get away with it. Either that or
San Jose was just incredibly
jx>or.
Regardless, it will save banner
wavers and Stanford students
many trying hours if the football
team would just play somewhat
errorless football and win that
way. It would also make those
people in Palo Alto very happy
on Saturday afternoons this fall.

Thriving on the fumble, the
pass interception, and mental
mistakes, the black plague of
more than one football coach has
again reared its infamous head
on the Farm. Every coach fights
tooth and nail to combat this
dread disease for if he fails and
his population of victories is 100
severely decimated, then his little
kingdom must collapse.
Last year this malicious mal
