# NAVAL ACADEMY DEADLOCKS TRIBE, 7-7
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The Midshipmen of Navy, loom
ing as the surprise football power
in The East, mixed their usually
finp defense with just enough of
fense to tie the disappointing
Stanford Indians, 7-7, before 52,-
000 fans.
It was a frustrating day for
Stanford as the Indians lost one

| touchdown on an end zone fum
; ble and saw Dave Lewis' game,
j end long bomb narrowly miss.
All-American candidate Gary Pet
; tigrew was injured in the game
and will be lost to the team for
an, as yet, undetermined period
of time.
Navy scored first as quarter
back John Cartwright shocked

I the Indians, favored by 14 points,
J with a 62-yard touchdown drive.
I The drive took 14 plays with half
back Terry Murray going over
from the one-yard line to give
Navy the lead.
i
statistical Advantage
From this point on, Stanford 1
rallied to dominate the game, but,
as a result of miscues and mis
fortunes, had to setle for the 7-7
tie. Stanford had 352 yards in
total offense for the day while
Navy had 210.
The first time the Indians had j
the ball resulted in three plays •
and a punt. There was one fum- J
! ble in this series which unfortu-!
nately set the pattern for the'
first quarter. The secon Indian
j series of downs was stopped by i
; Roger Lammer's interception of
j a Lewis pass. This interception
was followed by the Navy touch
down drive.
Midway through the second
I quarter, Stanford penetrated to
: the Middie 35-yard line. Stanford
; took time out for injured Bruce
i Kehrli, who didn't return to ac
tion the rest of the day.
Threat Ends
Four plays later the Indians
were on the 18, but. the threat
ended when Lewis' fourth-down
pass to Bob Blunt was caught
out of the end zone.
Navy took over but was forced
into a punting situation. The
snap from center was wide and
kicking specialist David Church
chased the ball to the goal line.
Church just got his foot on the
ball before he was crushed to the
ground by A 1 Wilburn with the
i hardest tackle of the day. The
ball dribbled to the 21-yard line
i and Church ended up five yards
! deep in the end zone.
! Ray Handley took tthe ball for
! two yards on the next play.
Lewis threw to Bob Conrad at
the 12, but the Indians were still !
there five plays later after gain
| ing a first down on the 6-yard ■
I line.
Lewis "Scores"
After a pass to the one, Lewis
! then plunged over left tackle only
jto fumble the ball. Lewis later
I said, "I felt I had seoml." Navy
Coach Bill Elias said, "Lewis was
! hit as soon as he took the ball
from the center and never did j
have control."
The only opinion that counted
was that of head linesman Paul
Kamanski. He ruled that Lewis
did not have possession as he {
went over the line and therefore j
the touchdown did not count.
The first Stanford drive in the i
second half was stopped as Fred j
; Bayer intercepted a Lewis aerial, j
But four minutes later Stanford j
had the ball back on its own 17.
Ray Handley drove for three
yards and John Read picked tip i
! two more at the middle. A Lewis
to Blunt pass play was good for
10 moie yards and a first down. |
Stanford Scores
On the next play Lewis faked
the option play and threw to :
Blunt at the Navy 30. Blunt elud
ed two Navy tacklers but was
brought down at the one-yard j
line. Handley plunged at right !
guard on the next down to score. |
Terry De Sylvia kicked the ex- j
tra point to tie the score and the ;
52,000 spectators sat back to wait
for the next score which never j
came.
Stanford put together a 63-yard j
drive early in the fourth quarter j
which stalled on the Navy 27. j
The next two times the Middies j
got the ball, they were stopped J
cold by the Indian defensive unit, j

Glenn Myers and Mike Hibler
were standouts all day in the line,
Hibler leading all tacklers with 19
tackles, 9 unassisted. A 1 Wilburn
made seven open field tackles and
sophomore Phil Schneider turned
in a fine defensive effort in his
first starting assignment.
Sophomore Marty Brill made
several tackles in the closing
minutes to stall the Navy attacks,
but the Indians could not get an
effective drive of their own mov
ing. Stanford got the ball again
with 2:41 remaining in the game.
Ray Handley got four yards at
the right side and Stanford took
time out. Lewis hit Mike Con
nelly for a 16-yard pass play to
the Navy 35, but was thrown for
a 10-yard loss next down.
After two incomplete passes
Terry De Sylvia punted out of
bounds at the Navy 7. Stanford
called two time-outs during the
ensuing minute and had the b;dl
back with time for two plays.
Lewis took the ball from cen
ter and eluded two rushing Mid
dies to throw a long pass to Blunt
at the Navy 3. But Navy defend
er Bernard De George had a hand

on the ball with Blunt and the j
pass fell incomplete.
With the seconds fading Stan-1
ford tried one last play but the
snap from center was fumbled. I
Tackle John Wilbur fell on the
ball only to kick it again. The ;
gun sounded to end thp game
even as the ball was bouncing
away.. It was a too fitting end to
a disappointing afternoon.
