"All University constituencies arc entitled to
express their views prior to the formulation of
University policies respecting matters in which
they have a legitimate interest."
From a resolution adop
ted April 8 by the Stu
dent Legislature
On April 9 of this year, the Committee on Uni
versity Policy (composed of faculty and high ad
ministrators) mid the Advisory Board of the Aca
demic Council accepted the above statement and
the subsequent sections of Article 5 which would
establish a Committee of 15—five members cho
sen by the President of the University, five by the
Academic Council, and five by the Legislature—
"to discuss University problems and policies with
a view to exchanging ideas and, if possible, agree
ing in principle upon recommendations to be
made to their several appointing powers."
However, in the five months since this unani
mous decision was reached, no Committee of 15
lias been established. We believe that such a com
mittee should be established immediately.
The reason the Administration presently re
fuse's to take such action is political—not theoreti
cal.
The above-quoted article and its enacting
clauses constitute only one part of a comprehen
sive LASSU resolution (subsequently added to
the By-Laws) reforming the student judicial
structure. An ad hoc committee of students, fac
ulty members and some administrators has been
negotiating on these other sections throughout
Spring and Summer quarters.
Thus, the promise of a Committee of 15 is
being used as a carrot to induce compromises from
the student leadership on the judicial competence
bill—an issue which has nothing to do with the
establishment of a Committee of 15.
Tin's may be good politics, but it violates the
spirit of cooperation which has been the New
Look in Administration policies since the Berk
eley crisis of last year.
The need lor the Committee is acknowledged
by all sides, with such issues as liquor policy, re
ligious policy—and the judicial system—still be
fore the community. As one high administrator
rightly noted in discussing the feasibility of ini
tiating informal student-faculty-administration
meetings to consider such problems, "This is what
the Committee of 15 is being set up for—a vehicle

of discussion.''
Today the ad hoc committee will meet again
to consider the judicial competence bill and its
relation to similar sections of the ASSU By-Laws.
Even if the contested "descrepencies" are not
ironed out, this ad hoc group should recommend
the immediate establishment of the Committee
of 15.
For what more appropriate matter of consider
ation should first come before such a body than
the judicial competence negotiations?
