# Hands Off!

With the intention of making every student
feel as though he were an adult, Stanford long
ago rejected such frivolities as keeping first-year
students off the Law School steps and requiring
freshmen to wear beanies. Education was to be
considered an adult enterprise, and those involved
in it were to be judged by their attributes as peo
ple, and not by their class.
But vestiges of the old way still remain.
Late last week, one local fraternity sent its
pledge class to Roble Hall to interview the more
pulchritudinous of the newly-arrived freshman
women. Under the section labeled "Sex on their
questionnaire were such questions as "Do you
drink, and if so, how much-" "Would you kiss a
boy on a first date?" and "Do you prefer to date
freshmen, upperclassmen, or fraternity men?" (It
must be conceded the questionnaires have im
proved iu at least one respect from last year. The
women weren't asked their measurements.)
The information will presumably go into a
house file, from which it will later be possible to
compare, drink by drink, the "sociality" of the
freshmen women.
In another incident, three gentlemen repre
senting a nonexistent "Activities Coordinating
Committee" sauntered up to Branncr and pro
ceeded to use their new-found authority to dig
similar information out of the freshmen.
Such approaches to establishing human rela
tionships seem to go against the spirit intended by
the elimination of class distinctions at Stanford,
and in fact we wonder if perhaps the offenders
really aren't more interested in "bods than "buds."
In any case, we hope to sec such practices
stopped. JHR
