## Professor Cites College Students as Only "Group Expression' Against Vietnam War 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I am glad to see college stu
dents concerned over Vietnam, j
Theirs is almost the only group
expression of what I perceive to 1
be a ground swell of misgiving
far greater than meets the eye.'
They may well be among the first
to be asked to sacrifice life for a
cause more nebulous, inferential
and ambiguous than any the na
tion has ever taken up arms for.
The Korean war was bad enough,
and we like 1o forget its inglori
ous nature in the sunshine of sub
sequent prosperity and the cele
bration of unparalleled material
gluttony; but it had at least a
measure of sanction from the
United Nations.
Now a President can make war
without the approval of Congress
required by the Constitution, by
simply not declaring it, a mere
shift of words. He need only re
invoke Mr. Dulles' policy of "con
tainment" to justify war meas
ures at the least infraction of its
sanctity. He can ignore the
alarmed protests of our staunch
est allies, imperil the improved
relations with our foremost, rival
in power, subject an unhappy
small nation to the terrors of war
(not questioning that they would
"rather be dead than red"), and
darken the sky of I he world: —
all on the advices of a few men
steeped in the archaic tradition of
international dueling, face-saving
(what will the face be without
the body?) and filled with the
juridical self • righteousness that
power always gives. A faceless
State Department and a docile
Conrress offer no resistance

while the world's one instrument
of peace, United Nations, is igno
miniously ignored.
What then is all this talk about
freedom when the most: vital is
sues in world history are sup
pressed by the press and radio
: (not openly but through the more
effective device of silence) and
ignored by our representatives in
[government? The President has
said and done some admirable
things in internal government,
but whence comes this omnis
cience in world affairs, this sud
den insight into the Oriental
mind, this petulance toward any
one not ready and willing to "co
operate," and this new sudden
abyss-manship?
I have lived through three
American wars, safely enough to
my no great credit, and I well
remember how each was made a
crusade to end all wars,
"To reap the harvest of perpet
ual peace,
By the one bloody trial of sharp
war." —Shakespeare
Yet each spawned a more por
tentous evil than the one it was
meant to do away with. Foreign
wars are all crusades that rest at
best on conjecture and fanati
cism. and the noblest professions
of aim end in ignobility. It is
time we judged the moral of war
by the results as well as by the
motives, and stopped consoling
ourselves for ultimate disaster by
our erstwhile good intentions.
All critique and self-examina
tion end once the antagonist has
been officially villaini/ed. The
| sanctity of unity is invoked and
i soon censorship makes treason
i out of reason. Mind and heart,

we arc then all expected to pull
together, even if it be on the road
to Hell, the ethics of the brass
band.
As fur the loss of face, I did j
not notice that, the Russians or
Khrushschev lost prestige in pull
ing out of Cuba, nor that the
Americans and Eisenhower were
accounted weak when we retired
from Korea? Our President might
lose a few friends in the Penta
gon, were he to withdraw from
Vietnam tomorrow, but two bil
lions of the world's helpless voice
less people, all human regardless
of political creed, would bless him
for it. I am no friend of Com
munism. but I have yet to hear
of the idea that was eradicated by
mass human extermination.
The students are right to op
pose such a war as this. I con
gratulate them. It takes more
courage to differ from, than it
does to die for, conformity. The
time is short.

I have been a subscriber to The

As far as I am concerned the
editorial policy of The Daily is
abominable and is not worthy of
what has been and continues to
be a great university. I cannot
believe that the sudent body, as
such, has fallen to such a low
point as was so consistently re
ported on your pages during the
i past year!
In talkine to various students

presently attending the univer
sity, my basic faith in the univer
sity and its students has been re
confirmed. 1 would suggest that
the staff of The Daily reevaluate
its purpose on the campus or dis
band.

tentous evil than the one it was
meant to do away with. Foreign
wars are all crusades that rest at

cism. and the noblest professions

by the results as well as by the
motives, and stopped consoling

band.
As fur the loss of face, I did j
not notice that, the Russians or
Khrushschev lost prestige in pull
ing out of Cuba, nor that the
Americans and Eisenhower were
accounted weak when we retired
from Korea? Our President might
lose a few friends in the Penta
gon, were he to withdraw from
Vietnam tomorrow, but two bil
lions of the world's helpless voice
less people, all human regardless
of political creed, would bless him
for it. I am no friend of Com
munism. but I have yet to hear
of the idea that was eradicated by
mass human extermination.
The students are right to op
pose such a war as this. I con
gratulate them. It takes more
courage to differ from, than it
does to die for, conformity. The
time is short.

Yet each spawned a more por
tentous evil than the one it was
meant to do away with. Foreign
wars are all crusades that rest at
best on conjecture and fanati
cism. and the noblest professions
of aim end in ignobility. It is
time we judged the moral of war
by the results as well as by the
motives, and stopped consoling
ourselves for ultimate disaster by
our erstwhile good intentions.
All critique and self-examina
tion end once the antagonist has
been officially villaini/ed. The
| sanctity of unity is invoked and
i soon censorship makes treason
i out of reason. Mind and heart,

we arc then all expected to pull
together, even if it be on the road
to Hell, the ethics of the brass
band.
As fur the loss of face, I did j
not notice that, the Russians or
Khrushschev lost prestige in pull
ing out of Cuba, nor that the
Americans and Eisenhower were
accounted weak when we retired
from Korea? Our President might
lose a few friends in the Penta
gon, were he to withdraw from
Vietnam tomorrow, but two bil
lions of the world's helpless voice
less people, all human regardless
of political creed, would bless him
for it. I am no friend of Com
munism. but I have yet to hear
of the idea that was eradicated by
mass human extermination.
The students are right to op
pose such a war as this. I con
gratulate them. It takes more
courage to differ from, than it
does to die for, conformity. The
time is short.

• Daily Policy Blasted
Editor, The Daily:
I have been a subscriber to The
Stanford Daily, but I do not in
tend to renew the subscription.
As far as I am concerned the
editorial policy of The Daily is
abominable and is not worthy of
what has been and continues to
be a great university. I cannot
believe that the sudent body, as
such, has fallen to such a low
point as was so consistently re
ported on your pages during the
i past year!
In talkine to various students

presently attending the univer
sity, my basic faith in the univer
sity and its students has been re
confirmed. 1 would suggest that
the staff of The Daily reevaluate
its purpose on the campus or dis
band.
Very truly yours,
MICHAEL IBS GONZALEZ
Ed. note. — Since our basic
faith in The Daily is unwaver
ing, we suggest that the I'ni
versity either reevaluate its
purpose or disband.
Editor, The Daily:
I am glad to see college stu
dents concerned over Vietnam, j
Theirs is almost the only group
expression of what I perceive to 1
be a ground swell of misgiving
far greater than meets the eye.'
They may well be among the first
to be asked to sacrifice life for a
cause more nebulous, inferential
and ambiguous than any the na
tion has ever taken up arms for.
The Korean war was bad enough,
and we like 1o forget its inglori
ous nature in the sunshine of sub
sequent prosperity and the cele
bration of unparalleled material
gluttony; but it had at least a
measure of sanction from the
United Nations.
Now a President can make war
without the approval of Congress
required by the Constitution, by
simply not declaring it, a mere
shift of words. He need only re
invoke Mr. Dulles' policy of "con
tainment" to justify war meas
ures at the least infraction of its
sanctity. He can ignore the
alarmed protests of our staunch
est allies, imperil the improved
relations with our foremost, rival
in power, subject an unhappy
small nation to the terrors of war
(not questioning that they would
"rather be dead than red"), and
darken the sky of I he world: —
all on the advices of a few men
steeped in the archaic tradition of
international dueling, face-saving
(what will the face be without
the body?) and filled with the
juridical self • righteousness that
power always gives. A faceless
State Department and a docile
Conrress offer no resistance

while the world's one instrument
of peace, United Nations, is igno
miniously ignored.
What then is all this talk about
freedom when the most: vital is
sues in world history are sup
pressed by the press and radio
: (not openly but through the more
effective device of silence) and
ignored by our representatives in
[government? The President has
said and done some admirable
things in internal government,
but whence comes this omnis
cience in world affairs, this sud
den insight into the Oriental
mind, this petulance toward any
one not ready and willing to "co
operate," and this new sudden
abyss-manship?
I have lived through three
American wars, safely enough to
my no great credit, and I well
remember how each was made a
crusade to end all wars,
"To reap the harvest of perpet
ual peace,
By the one bloody trial of sharp
war." —Shakespeare
