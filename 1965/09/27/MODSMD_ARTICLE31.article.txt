# GRUBER SPEAKS
## The 						Meek Shall Inherit A TMU Cheeseburger 
### STEVE GRUBER 
11 is time to speak out against tlie massive injustices oeeuring
everyda\ at Tresidder Union. Within the dark confines of that pre
fab monolith Stanford students are being cheated out of their dig
nity at this moment.
The problem is cheeseburgers.
At a Great universih no one should have to order a cheeseburger

three times. Al a Great Univer- j
sity no one should have 1o com- \
mil mayhem upon his brother to;
got a bacon, lettuce and tomato |
sandwich, much less a plate of
cold French fries. \
For example, it is possible at j
any time to step up to the gtill :
at Tresidder and make such a
simple request as "A cheesebur
ger and fries, please." And it is !
also possible to get a eheesebur- ,
ger and fries after a fashion. '
I have seen students collapse!
from hunger at that grill. When j
I was a freshman, I thought they j
were hunger strikers and I sym- j
pathized with their cause, what-;
ever it was. Tut as an off-cam
pus sophomore eating an occa
sional lunch at the Union, 1 soon
•e-irnr>d th; t their cause was ex- !
istenee itself.
Customers at the grill may be
classified in four ways:
The Bold these students can

j hardly sweat the small stuff, such
as ordering. They walk in. pick j
up a hamburger, pay for it, and
eat. They also range from 200 j
, to 300 pounds and are over six
; feet tall.
The Meek as the year goes on. 1
these students lose weight until '
they are finally turned over to
, the Medical School for anatomy
! labs.
I The Feminine this category is j
j narrower than it at first appears, j
j The Feminine customer must be |
j beautiful. Once this criterion is 1
i met, she may have anything she;
; wants, and she usually gets it
| within thirty seconds. Any girl !
without a good body or face must
be classified with The Meek.
The Employee—all of the for
. malities are bypassed for this cus
tomer. He simly walks into the
kitchen and cooks his own ham- j
; burger. j
What's wrong with the system? j
j Me.
I'm not six feet tall, nor do I ;
weigh anywhere near 200 pounds. ]
I'm not any employee. I'm not a >
| female. So they're about to turn ;
i me over to the Med School.
| However, 1 have found ways to !
! fight The System. Now, when j
j some big freshman takes my j
j cheeseburger, I merely walk over |
j to him as he is paying for it, take j
jit off his tray, and in that in- j
: imitable manner learned from j
watching Soup Sales too often, i
spread it from his chin to his
forehead. Then I run like hell.
To combat The Feminine takes '
more originality. After a eurva-1
ceous pompon girl has stolen my i
long-awaited food, I wait until;
I she's standing in the line for the j
; cash register, holding the tray
| with both hands. Then I begin!
! taking off her skirt. Either she;
will drop the cheeseburger, in
! which case I get to eat that day.
or she will not drop the cheese
burger, in which case I still have
a good time.
This column is swiftly coming
to a close because I am about to
j collapse from hunger again. But
i before they deliver me to Alpine
i House I would like to make a
j suggestion for improving the lot
iof The Meek. Give psychological
tests to all students to determine j
their meekness, then allow The
Meek the first priority on all food j
served at the grill.
Either do that, baby, or we'll j
never inherit the earth.
