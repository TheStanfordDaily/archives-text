# $1.5 Million Suit Against University
## Medical School Flunky Fights Back 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
A former Stanford medical
student has filed a $1.5 million
suit against the University alleg
ing that he was wrongly flunked
out of the Medical School.
L. Jack Whitney, an Oregon
school teacher, charged in a suit
filed in San Jose that Dr. Lubert
Stiver, assistant, professor of
Biochemistry, failed him on a
make-up exam, even though Whit
ney had a higher score than some
who passed the course.
Both Whitney and Stryer were
unavailable for comment yester
day.
A .Second Chance
Whitney did not receive a pass
ing score in Streyer's Biochemis
try course in March 1964. Whit
ney was advised that he would be
given a chance to repeat the test
in mid-September.
In July 1964, Whitney was
forced to make a trip to the East
coast because of illness in the
family. Whitney's suit alleges
that he informed Strcyer of the
trip.
Three days after Whitney had
left, the date for the make-up test
was changed from September to
August. He claimed that the let
ter reached him in insufficient,
time for him to prepare for the
exam.
He flunked the second exam
though others who had "received
similar grades or lower" were
given a passing grade in the
course.
"Discriminated Against"
Subsequently Whitney filed a
petition for readmission to the
Medical School. The faculty com
mittee, the suit charges, treated
him "u nfai r 1 y, discriminated
against him with bias and de
prived him of due process of
law."
In a telephone interview with
The Daily, Dr. Sidney Raffel,
Acting Dean of the Stanford Med
ical School, said, "Technically,
failure to pass one course can
eliminate a man." He noted, how
ever. that in actual practice it
was an aggregation of difficulties
rather than one failure that elim
inates a man from the Medical
School.
Raffel, head of the Student
Standings and Promotions Com
mittee at the time of Whitney's
appeal of readmission, said that
the case was handled in a normal
manner. The case was not unusu
al, and was only one of several
being reviewed.
According to Raffel, a student
must finish one year's require
ments before being allowed to
continue the next year's work. A
student is given the summer to
make up any deficiencies. In
certain instances additional time
may he granted, even as much as
a year, Raffel commented.
First-Year Problems
Whitney had completed one
year of Medical School and was in
his second year of studies. Raffel
noted that Whitney had also had
difficulties in his first year seri
ous enough to bring his case be
fore the Student Standings and
Performance Committee.
An official University state
ment noted that a faculty com
mittee "had fully reviewed the
facts of this case and believes
that Mr. Whitney has been fairly
treated by the School of Medi
cine. Therefore the University
has declined to readmit Mr. Whit
ney to the School of Medicine."
The University has not been
served with summons. If served,
Stanford will be represented by
its general counsel, MoCutcheon,
Doyle, Brown. Trautman and Em
ersen.
Former Cal Student
Married and the father of three
children, Whitney received a
bachelor's degree from the Uni
versity of California at Berkeley
in 1951. Prior to going into the
teaching field, he worked for a
chemical firm.
In addition to seeking $1.5 mil
lion against the University, Whit
ney is requesting $100,000 puni
tive damages against Streyer.

the case was handled in a normal
manner. The case was not unusu
al, and was only one of several
being reviewed.
According to Raffel, a student
must finish one year's require
ments before being allowed to
continue the next year's work. A
student is given the summer to
make up any deficiencies. In
certain instances additional time
may he granted, even as much as
a year, Raffel commented.
First-Year Problems
Whitney had completed one
year of Medical School and was in
his second year of studies. Raffel
noted that Whitney had also had
difficulties in his first year seri
ous enough to bring his case be
fore the Student Standings and
Performance Committee.
An official University state
A former Stanford medical
student has filed a $1.5 million
suit against the University alleg
ing that he was wrongly flunked
out of the Medical School.
L. Jack Whitney, an Oregon
school teacher, charged in a suit
filed in San Jose that Dr. Lubert
Stiver, assistant, professor of
Biochemistry, failed him on a
make-up exam, even though Whit
ney had a higher score than some
who passed the course.
Both Whitney and Stryer were
unavailable for comment yester
day.
A .Second Chance
Whitney did not receive a pass
ing score in Streyer's Biochemis
try course in March 1964. Whit
ney was advised that he would be
given a chance to repeat the test
in mid-September.
In July 1964, Whitney was
forced to make a trip to the East
coast because of illness in the
family. Whitney's suit alleges
that he informed Strcyer of the
trip.
Three days after Whitney had
left, the date for the make-up test
was changed from September to
August. He claimed that the let
ter reached him in insufficient,
time for him to prepare for the
exam.
He flunked the second exam
though others who had "received
similar grades or lower" were
given a passing grade in the
course.
"Discriminated Against"
Subsequently Whitney filed a
petition for readmission to the
Medical School. The faculty com
mittee, the suit charges, treated
him "u nfai r 1 y, discriminated
against him with bias and de
prived him of due process of
law."
In a telephone interview with
The Daily, Dr. Sidney Raffel,
Acting Dean of the Stanford Med
ical School, said, "Technically,
failure to pass one course can
eliminate a man." He noted, how
ever. that in actual practice it
was an aggregation of difficulties
rather than one failure that elim
inates a man from the Medical
School.
