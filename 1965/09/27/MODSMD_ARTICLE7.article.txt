| The stereotype of the dark,
! dingy jazz hangout off a dark
alley in a slum district may hold
! true in many major U.S. cities. It
| doesn't, however, in San Fran
j cisco.
i An emerging center of new im
j portancc in the jazz world, San
| Francisco is now offering the top
i names in jazz in a collection of
beautiful and well-managed clubs,
j many of which are open to mi
j nors.
The North Beach area in San
Francisco harbors three widely
diverse clubs, with equally diverse
programs of entertainment.
Basin Street West
! B a si n Street West, which
[opened a year ago (his week, is
: the plushest and most expensively
j outfitted jazz club in the world.
J With wall-to-wall carpeting, am
| pie seating room, a marvelous
j acoustical system, and a view of
San Francisco, it does much to
dispel the aforementioned stereo
type.
Open 1o minors, Basin Street
j West has brought in top names
in jazz over the past twelve
I months, and will add popular at
tractions in the coming months.
Currently appearing is trumpeter
■ Dizzy Gillespie, fresh from his
{great performances as master of
i ceremonies at last weekend's
| Monterey Jazz Festival.
Gillespie, one of the two "fa
! thers" of the modern era in jazz
(along with Charlie Parker) and
one of the most consistently ex
citing performers in the field, is
I also a marvelous comedian, and
I kept the Monterey crowd in
I stitches for three days.
K.I Matador
Across the street from BSW.
land unfortunately not open to mi
nors. is El Matador, which has
; over the past year featured Latin
oriented iii// with such r«>111 >a*-

Carl Tjader, Brazil '65, Charlie
Bvrd, and Vince Guaraldi. El
Matador is the smallest of the
San Francisco clubs, and the most
intimate.
A block further down Broad
way is the dean of San Francisco
clubs, the Jazz Workshop. Al
though the acoustics are general
ly terrible, the seating abhorrent,
the Workshop consistently has
the best of the jazz crop. John
Coltra'ne is currently appearing in
this club which is unfortunately
also closed to minors.
Trident
Across the Golden Gate Bridge
in Sausalito is the Trident, an as
tounding club which will soon
merit a separate article. Re
nowned jazz critic Leonard Feath
er recently acclaimed the Trident
as the finest and most beautiful
club in his experience of over
thirty years in jazz. (And Feather
lives in Los Angeles! ) The Tri
dent sits over the water, and its
all-glass front offers a superb
view of the San Francisco sky
line.
In my years as an ardent. Tri
dent fan, it has always seemed
incredible to me that the club,
which is open to minors, never
charges a cover or minimum,
and has only very rarely charged
a minor door fee. Opening Tues
day was jazz singer Jon Hen
dricks. formerly of the famous
"Lamberts, Hendricks & Ross"
singing trio.
"Stanford Jazz War"
Stanford itself will he quite ac
tive in the jazz field during the
coming academic year. "Stanford

and exhibits, will open on October
