# Liquor Regs To be Reviewed
## Students to be involved in Study of Possible Changes 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
j For the fourth time in the last six years, "the possibility of making
1 some changes" in Stanford's liquor poliey will he discussed, Kobert
Wert, Dean of Undergraduatiou, revealed last week.
In a letter to H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Students, Wert said,
i'it is now timely, I believe, to study the situation once again and
. ...

develop some recommendations
on liquor policy which can be put
before the President of t lie Uni
versity."
He also suggested that "'stu
dents be very much involved in
the preparation of the recommen
dations."
Controversial Issue
Such a study would revive a
persistent and controversial issue
at Stanford.
The 1965 edition of the LASSU
Constitution and By-Laws con
tains a recommendation that the
Legislature "decide this fall" con
cerning the liquor question.
A clause in the By-Laws states
that "The possession, transporta
tion. or use of intoxicating liq
uors by Stanford students in the
University community shall be in
accordance with California State
law."
This clause was approved in
the spring of 1962 in a student
body referendum by a vote of
2,716 to 741.
Change for Married Students
But the Board of Trustees in
July 1962 reaffirmed the "long
! standing policy prohibiting the
I possession and use of alcoholic
j beverages by students on the Uni
versity campus," though altering
i the poliey to allow married stu
! dents, presumably residents of
! Escondido Village, to drink in ac
| eordance with state law.
Then on Sept. 27. 1962, the Leg
-1 islature acknowledged the Trus
tee decision as rendering the ref-
I erendum e 1 a us e "inoperative"
j while maintaining that "it shall
; not be considered a violation of
! the Fundamental tSandard for a
person over twenty-one to possess
j or consume alcohol on campus
unlses he violates some other As
| sociated Students regulation."
Unresolved Question
In this way, Ihe Legislature
has left the question unresolved,
neither accepting the Trustee do-
I eision nor entirely rejecting it.
The issue, however, may not
I properly reside in the hands of
tHe Legislature. Two days before
the 1962 referendum, the Presi
dent's Office asserted that "rcgu
i lations regarding the use of liq
uor on campus are within the ju
! risdietion of the Board of Trus
tees."
The prohibition of liquor on

campus, though not included in
the founding grant, became Uni
versity policy in the early 1900's
|by the action of the Board of
Trustees after various disturb*
j anees involving liquor on campus.
