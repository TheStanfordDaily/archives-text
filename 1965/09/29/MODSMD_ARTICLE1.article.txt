• University Backs Up Health Director
PROVIDENCE, R.L. The administration at Brown University
backed up yesterday the health service director who gave two un
married coeds prescriptions for contraceptive pills.
University President Barnaby C. Keeney said he is satisfied with
Dr. Roswell D. Johnson's "performance and judgment." Both Keeney
and Johnson stressed that the two cases were carefully considered.
Dr. Johnson said both women involved were "mature people,
already engaged and they both had been referred to me by clergy."
Keeney said one of the women has since married and both were
over 21.
Keeney said Dr. Johnson has broad discretion to treat cases
as seems best, and added, "after careful examination of the circum
stances Dr. Johnson decided to prescribe contraceptive pills. It is
common practice to do so well before marriage."
Johnson said he acted on what he called his own policy and it
does not constitute a "blanket prescription."
He said "several requests" have been denied and he would not
prescribe the pills to a girl under 21 unless she had written permis
sion from her parents.
