# Library Fines Up
## 
### 
A revised line schedule, up
proved by the Committee on Uni
versity libraries, has gone into
effect to ensure more efficient
access to books in the Main Li
brary and in the Reserve Book
Room. The new fine schedule ap
plies to all Library departments
presently assessing fines, reports
R. D. Rogers, Director of the
Stanford Univeristy Libraries.
One-month and seven-day books
borrowed from the main desk will
be fined at the rate of 10 cents
a day with a $10 maximum, while
Recalled books and Library-use
books will be fined at a rate of
$1 a day, also with a $10 maxi
mum. The rates for the Reserve
Book Room are $1 for the first
hour and 50 cents for each addi
tional hour on closed shelf books
and $1 a day for 1 day books,
both with a maximum of $20.
Along with the new fine sched
ule, there will be a 30 per cent dis
count on fines paid when the!
book is returned. This discount 1
does not apply however when the !
maximum fine has been reached. I
Finally an additional penalty of !
$5 will be assessed in the event :
that the Registrar's Office must
be notified of a delinquent bill.
All students are urged to
acquaint themselves with the fa
cilities and resources of the Stan-!
ford University Libraries. Copies !
of the leaflet, Borrowing Regu
lations for Students and the new
edition of the handbook, Your Li
braries at Stanford University, |
are available at the Main Loan
Desk.
