10,621 students have registered for fall quarter as of 5 p.m. yes
! terday. Of these, 8.228 are men, and 2,393 are women, an increase
| of 215 over last year.
According to aHrvey Hail. University Registrar, the increase
; was somewhat higher than expected, probably due to the armed

j forces build-up and the preference
| by iru- ny men of registration lines
i over draft board lines.
In addition, he expected approx
| imately 230 more students to reg
: ister late. Some of these would
' be late do to the Jewish holiday,
J brated Monday and Tuesday. Be
[ cause of the holiday, the late reg
j istration fees will not be in effect
The somewhat unexpected in
! crease caused no major problems,
! however, and most found regis
j tration easier this year than last.
Certainly part of the reason
| for the relative efficiency of the
j operation is due to procedure
j changes made by the Registrar's
office. Students with financial
j grants did not have to go to the
i financial aids office for tuition
deferments this year, but instead
I found cards in their folders de

; daring tho validity of their
; grants.
Cards for Selective Service Stu
dent Deferment were also placed
in Men's folders, eliminating the
customary visit to the National
Service Office. The final step in
; registration, usually the most
tedious one, was made easier by
i the elimination of 10 of the 20
items that are usually checked.
Harvey Hall also added, how
ever, that there was the expected
amount of students waiting in
line outside his office. Most of
these had lost registration fold
ers, advisors names, even advis
ors. "We try to make the whole
i thing as simple as we can. But
when you're dealing with approx
imately 11,000 people, there are
i hound to be a few rough edges."


Activity booths lined I'ne route of 10,621 registering students
Monday and Tuesday in an effort to take money and signa
tures. An approximate 230 were the only students td go
unattracted.

! however, and most found regis
j tration easier this year than last.
Certainly part of the reason
| for the relative efficiency of the
j operation is due to procedure
j changes made by the Registrar's
office. Students with financial
j grants did not have to go to the
i financial aids office for tuition
deferments this year, but instead
I found cards in their folders de

; daring tho validity of their
; grants.
Cards for Selective Service Stu
dent Deferment were also placed
in Men's folders, eliminating the
customary visit to the National
Service Office. The final step in
; registration, usually the most
tedious one, was made easier by
i the elimination of 10 of the 20
items that are usually checked.
Harvey Hall also added, how
ever, that there was the expected
amount of students waiting in
line outside his office. Most of
these had lost registration fold
ers, advisors names, even advis
ors. "We try to make the whole
i thing as simple as we can. But
when you're dealing with approx
imately 11,000 people, there are
i hound to be a few rough edges."


Activity booths lined I'ne route of 10,621 registering students
Monday and Tuesday in an effort to take money and signa
tures. An approximate 230 were the only students td go
unattracted.
