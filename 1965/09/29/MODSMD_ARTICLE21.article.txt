# Stanford Grid Highlights Televised on Wednesdays
## 
### 
Stanford's many football enthu
siasts will have an additional op
portunity to watch their favorite
heroes in action this fall thanks
to KTVU. A one hour weekly pro
gram will be shown every Wed
nesday night throughout the grid
iron season presenting highlights
from both the Stanford and Cali
fornia games of the previous
weekend.

The show will be seen from 9-10
on KTVU <2>. With a very mini
mum amount of time wasted with
talking, the show includes most
of the plays of each game. This
differs from most football high
lights which often televise only
the crucial ones.
The program last week had
Coaches John Ralston and Hay
Willsey comment on their teams
performances. The coaches ex
plained what really happened at
a particular time, but most impor
tant why.
This show will blend well with
tht live radio broadcasts over
KCBS to cover Stanford loot ball.
It will become of significant value
after away games, which most of
the Stanford community will not
have an opportunity to see.
