# Indian Lewis Tops List Of Coast Offense Stars
## 
### 
Dave Lewis who has led the In
dians to a win and a tic heads the
list of Stanford individual stars.
Lewis leads the AAWU in total
offense, mainly on the strength
of his right arm. Lewis holds a
sizable lead over second placed
Tom Trovato of Oregon.
Mike Garrett of USC has been
nothing less than spectacular the
first two weeks. He has been
voted back of the week both
games. He leads in rushing by al
most 150 yards and is tied for the
scoring lead.
Ray Handley from Stanford
with two touchdowns is in second
place in scoring, with Terry De-
Sylvia's toe giving him a hold on
seventh place.
Stanford's defense has turned
up as the strong point, of Ihe
team, as the Indians lead the
AAWU by an average of 44 yards
per game The offense has not
been lax though, as the big "O"
trails USC by only one yard per
game. Besides leading in total de
fense, Stanford also leads the con
ference in pass defense. This sta
tistic may come as a shock to
many Stanford fans, for in the
past Stanford had always been
noted for poor pass defense.
Garrett is by far the most spec
tacular back in the AAWU so far
this season. He scored two touch
downs last Saturday and ran for
a total of 154 yards. The runner
up in rushing has only the same
number of yards in his two games
that Garrett got in that one.
In passing WSU's Tom Roth,
the quarterback find of the seas
on, extended his lead over Wash
ington's Tod Hullin. Roth has 30
completions, good for 328 yards,
to 20 completions for Hullin.
Dave Lewis of Stanford is
fourth in passing with 18 comple
tions in 39 attempts. However, he
only has a passing percentage of
.462.
On the receiving end of the
passes, Roth's favorite target,
Cougar end Rich Sheron holds the
lead for the first time with twelve

receptions for 149 yards. Behind
Blunt in second place, the Indians
place Mike Connelly in sixth place
with six receptions for 91 yards.
In rushing powerful Indian full- '
hack John Read is third with 117
yards and a 3.9 yards per carry
average. Ray Handley who was
seventh in the country last year
is in ninth position in the con
ference with only 75 yards.

past Stanford had always been
noted for poor pass defense.
Garrett is by far the most spec
tacular back in the AAWU so far
this season. He scored two touch
downs last Saturday and ran for
a total of 154 yards. The runner
up in rushing has only the same
number of yards in his two games
that Garrett got in that one.
In passing WSU's Tom Roth,
the quarterback find of the seas
on, extended his lead over Wash
ington's Tod Hullin. Roth has 30
completions, good for 328 yards,
to 20 completions for Hullin.
Dave Lewis of Stanford is
fourth in passing with 18 comple
tions in 39 attempts. However, he
only has a passing percentage of
.462.
On the receiving end of the
passes, Roth's favorite target,
Cougar end Rich Sheron holds the
lead for the first time with twelve

receptions for 149 yards. Behind
Blunt in second place, the Indians
place Mike Connelly in sixth place
with six receptions for 91 yards.
In rushing powerful Indian full- '
hack John Read is third with 117
yards and a 3.9 yards per carry
average. Ray Handley who was
seventh in the country last year
is in ninth position in the con
ference with only 75 yards.

Dave Lewis who has led the In
dians to a win and a tic heads the
list of Stanford individual stars.
Lewis leads the AAWU in total
offense, mainly on the strength
of his right arm. Lewis holds a
sizable lead over second placed
Tom Trovato of Oregon.
Mike Garrett of USC has been
nothing less than spectacular the
first two weeks. He has been
voted back of the week both
games. He leads in rushing by al
most 150 yards and is tied for the
scoring lead.
Ray Handley from Stanford
with two touchdowns is in second
place in scoring, with Terry De-
Sylvia's toe giving him a hold on
seventh place.
Stanford's defense has turned
up as the strong point, of Ihe
team, as the Indians lead the
AAWU by an average of 44 yards
per game The offense has not
been lax though, as the big "O"
trails USC by only one yard per
game. Besides leading in total de
fense, Stanford also leads the con
ference in pass defense. This sta

many Stanford fans, for in the

GAMES THIS WEEK
Kansas at California
15 YU at Oregon
OSU at USC (night)
Ohio State at Washington
Idaho at Washington State
STANFORD at Air Force
UCLA at 1 Vnn State.
Dave Lewis who has led the In
dians to a win and a tic heads the
list of Stanford individual stars.
Lewis leads the AAWU in total
offense, mainly on the strength
of his right arm. Lewis holds a
sizable lead over second placed
Tom Trovato of Oregon.
Mike Garrett of USC has been
nothing less than spectacular the
first two weeks. He has been
voted back of the week both
games. He leads in rushing by al
most 150 yards and is tied for the
scoring lead.
Ray Handley from Stanford
with two touchdowns is in second
place in scoring, with Terry De-
Sylvia's toe giving him a hold on
seventh place.
Stanford's defense has turned
up as the strong point, of Ihe
team, as the Indians lead the
AAWU by an average of 44 yards
per game The offense has not
been lax though, as the big "O"
trails USC by only one yard per
game. Besides leading in total de
fense, Stanford also leads the con
ference in pass defense. This sta
tistic may come as a shock to
many Stanford fans, for in the
past Stanford had always been
noted for poor pass defense.
Garrett is by far the most spec
tacular back in the AAWU so far
this season. He scored two touch
downs last Saturday and ran for
a total of 154 yards. The runner
up in rushing has only the same
number of yards in his two games
that Garrett got in that one.
In passing WSU's Tom Roth,
the quarterback find of the seas
on, extended his lead over Wash
ington's Tod Hullin. Roth has 30
completions, good for 328 yards,
to 20 completions for Hullin.
Dave Lewis of Stanford is
fourth in passing with 18 comple
tions in 39 attempts. However, he
only has a passing percentage of
.462.
On the receiving end of the
passes, Roth's favorite target,
Cougar end Rich Sheron holds the
lead for the first time with twelve

receptions for 149 yards. Behind
Blunt in second place, the Indians
place Mike Connelly in sixth place
with six receptions for 91 yards.
In rushing powerful Indian full- '
hack John Read is third with 117
yards and a 3.9 yards per carry
average. Ray Handley who was
seventh in the country last year
is in ninth position in the con
ference with only 75 yards.
