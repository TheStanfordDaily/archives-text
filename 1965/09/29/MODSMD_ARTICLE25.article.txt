# Injury Causes Line Switches

### 
A 1 Wilburn a defensive end will i
| move to co-captain Gary Petti-:
| grew's vacated tackle position in :
I the game at the Air Force Acad
emy this Saturday. Pettigrew a,
; candidate for All-American hon
! ors injured his knee in the Navy
| game and was operated on today.
Wilburn played extensively last
| year on defense. Backing up Guy 1
; Rounsaville, he was in for
I minutes, most of it during the
' last six games of the season. As a ;
frosh, A 1 was captain of his team
j and received the Murphy Mem- j
j orial Award as the outstanding
j player on the squad.
Pettigrew's regular replace
ment Monty Morhman has also
joined the ailing list. Monty re
ceived a gash over an eye worth !
seven stitches against Navy. The
eye has closed, and he doesn't see j
too well. With no one else avail- j
able. Wilburn will face the Fal- i
cons from the tackle spot.
Wilburn had a great game
! against Navy last Saturday. He!
j made 13 tackles (9 unassisted)!
; and was the man who finally fig- j
| ured the Navy option play. This J
! had been the Middies most potent
: offensive play.
Two gridders Tom Hazelrigg
and Bill Ostrander will spend this
| week competing for ihe defensive
| end spot vacated by Wilburn. Os- i
i trander had the dubious privilege i
! of backing up Jack Chappie last 1
1 year, but was switched to end this :
! season. Hazelrigg is only a sopho- j
' more up from last year's frosh '
team, where he did a commend-;
able job, and lacks only in cxper-'
ience.
TOE SCORING
