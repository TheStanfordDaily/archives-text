# Stanford's Karate Club Back in Action This Fall
## 
### JAMES WHITE 
Karate is one of the most roc-}
ent additions to Stanford sports.
The Stanford Karate Club was!
established last year by students I
interested in studying Karate, one
of the oldest known systems of
unarmed self-defense and also a |
popular competitive sport. Karate
was initially developed by the
Chinese and spread to Korea.
Okinawa and Japan.
Unlike Judo, which has been
standardized and unified into one
system. Karate remains frag
mented into dozens of different
styles. That studied in the Stan
ford club is a Chinese school.
Kempo Karate; however, it has
many techniques and principles
in common with other styles: the i
hands and feet are converted into
weapons capable of breaking
bricks, stones, or bones.
The more sepctacular tricks are
only auxiliary to -<he real pur
poses of Karate as practiced in i
the Stanford club: self-defense,!
competition, and physical condi
tioning.
In combat, punches and kicks
are delivered to the opponent's
vital organs with maximum pow
er; however, with practice one is
able to pull his punches just short
of the traget area. This ability
made possible the development of
Karate as a sport; the referee of
a match decides whether pulled
punches and kicks would, if exe
cuted completely, have disabled
or killed the opponent, and
awards points accordingly.
Matches are closely judged, and
despite the speed and power used,
injuries from poorly delivered at
tacks are exceptionally rare.
In the Stanford Karate Club
emphasis is placed first upon
self-defense techniques, with spec
ific responses to various types of
attack being taught; to an experi
enced student of Karate in a dan
gerous situation the number of
assailants is immaterial. Second,
free-style sparring is taught.
Sparring is the substance of
competitive Karate; no student is
allowed to spar until the instruc
tor considers his self-control suf
ficient to rule out the possibility
of injury. Individual members of
the Stanford Karate Club have
participated in tournaments in
Monterey and Berkeley, as well as
in the International Karate
Championships held in August in
Long Beach.
With growth and experience
the club hopes to be able to enter
competition as a group. Instruct
ors for the Stanford Karate Club
are members of the teaching staff
of a Kempo Karate studio in San
Jose who come to Stanford two !
evenings a week (this year, Tues

day and Thursday) and hold
classes in the men's gym,
As qualified instructors they i
; are authorized to test the pro- j
; ficiency of club members and
grant promotions in rank to those
who pass.
The fall quarter organizational
meetings of the Karate Club will
I be held next Monday, October 4,
at 7:30 p.m. in the men's gym. It
is emphasized that everyone is
welcome, undergraduates, grad
; students, and staff; experience is
not required.
