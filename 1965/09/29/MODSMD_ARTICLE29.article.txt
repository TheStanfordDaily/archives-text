The Stanford Today and Tomorrow Commit
tee is to be congratulated on the excellence of its
opening conference yesterday, a pilot project
which gave administrators, faculty members and
student leaders a chance to meet and exchange
views on the University, its operation and pur
pose.
However, the journalist in us suggests the de
sirability of one change—at least part of the con
ference should be opened to the student body.
Presently, the policy is to keep the sessions closed
so as to encourage frankness; however, we heard
virtually nothing yesterday that either could or
should be kept from any member of the commu
nity. Indeed, such an educational forum would be
a welcome addition to the campus scene.
The morning session, for example, dealt exten
sively with such topics as the Board of Trustees
and its function, the faculty committee structure
and the formulation of student policy. The after

noon session was equally as beneficial, with its
seven man panel of four student leaders, two pro
fessors and the Dean of Undergraduate Educa
tion exchanging valuable—though sometimes
conflicting—views of what the student's role in
the campus community should be.
To many in the room the information dissemi
nated was not entirely new—although the chance
to discuss these issues was certainly welcomed—
but consider the rest of the student body. How
many freshmen have any idea how the University
operates, how decisions are made, who makes
them and why?
We think the ST&T Committee, after such an
excellent beginning effort, should consider ex
panding its program next year to include such a
program for the freshmen. Indeed, it may not be i
to late to conduct another such conference this
year, one that is open to all, or at least qpen to
coverage by the news media.
