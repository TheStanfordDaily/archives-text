# Sleeping on Lawn?
## Problem of Branner Bags 
### TOM BOWEN 
Assistant Feature Filitor
I suppose that by now it has
existed for so long it could be!
referred to as a legitimate Stan
ford tradition, and if it were to'
eease it is quite conceivable that !
a goodly portion of the female i
members of the fretshman class
would pass their first week or so j
on the Farm camped on the fronl '
lawn of Branner or Roble.
But invariably, year in and
year out. numerous civic and vir-j
ginity minded groups attempt to!
stop pledges from one or two i
campus fraternities from carry
ing the luggage of newly arrived i
frosh dollies into their respective
residence hall rooms.
Actually there is probably fair-!
ly good reason for these civic!
minded members of Pre-Reg and !
Alpha Phi Omega to try and keep I

the upperclassmen from the
freshmen for at least a week or
so in what seems to be an always
vain effort to avert the annual
social falling-out between frosh
men and women. But it is lit
erally the height of conceit for
these individuals to assume that
they can single-handedly trans
port every piece of luggage which
arrives at Roble and Branner to
its respective cubicle.
Four Hundred Pounds
In the first place the average
arriving freshman woman must
bring along at least four hundred
pounds of assorted books, type
writers and clothes, clothes,
clothes, either packed ntatly into
about thirty-seven suitcases, or
scattered rather haphazardly
about the back of Mommy and
Daddy's station wagon. In either
case it is a full time job for at

least three strong sophomores \
making two trips each to haul;
it up to the third floor ready to
be unpacked.
Moreover, these dollies don't I
arrive at convenient seven min-1
ute intervals which would allow j
the three or four A-Phi-O mem
bers to handle the total job with
out the assistance of the more
than-willing sophomores. Morel
often carloads of eager-to-move-in !
dollies show up in groups of two !
or three and try even there- \
sources of all the assorted males
standing in the lot.
So the plan of operations by
the "authorized" representatives'
has to be varied during the day.;
First, a powerfully built, six-foot,
two-inch, one hundred and ten
pound excuse for a man strides;
over and informs the groups of,
pledges that he is from A-Phi-O
and he can handle "all the work"
so they had bettor leave. After |
a few minutes of shuddering with ,
utter fear of the consequences of:
defying this admonition the j
pledges muster enough courage

to stick it out, and it is a good '
thing that they do.
Ultimately the muscular "auth-'
orized" people realize that neither |
they nor the Chicago Bears could !
carry all of that luggage up the
stairs so they begin tacitly
allowing the poor, fear-stricken j
pledges into the upper reaches of!
the residences. Ever present is i
the warning to be quick about ;
your business (even if it is a one I
hundred and twenty five pound,
bulky hamper to go all the way!
to room 301 of Branner, < placing ;
your chances of avoiding a double |
hernia in severe danger > or for-1
feit your privilege of unobstruct
ed entry.
Finally, at about four p.m. the
work is over and the Pre Regies ,
go off to the ever-present job
of keeping freshman functions!
exclusive, the A-Phi-O's to chalk
up another good turn to the!
credit of the men in the green i
arm-bands, and the pledges back
up to the Row to look for the;
Ben-Gay and a nice quiet place I
on the sleeping porch.
