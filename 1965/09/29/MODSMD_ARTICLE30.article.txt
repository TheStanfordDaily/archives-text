## Paly High Girls Really Human 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Frosh Edition of the Daily
was both disappointing and anger
ing; one might wonder if the edi
tors should not add a supplement 1
of apology to the freshmen as well j
as to the surrounding high school j
population.
I am especially upset by the ar-'
tides on the Flicks, the Admission
policy, and the tabloid "exposure"
of "Paly high girls" (who for the
factually minded also come from 1
Belmont, San Carlos, Los Altos, j
Crystal Springs, etc.).
These articles had in common a
portrayal of the Stanford Fresh
man which describes an erotic-ally
frustrated fool who inveigles a
high school student, (perhaps on
her suggestion) to a car, trans
forming political conversation by

agile sleight of hand to conversa
tion in the sexual sense.
If he has, perchance, arrived un
repressed, the Daily et al tell him
unto death that between the ratio
and the fraternity he may hence
expect unconditional celibacy.
The freshman who might want
to know the high school girl as a
human being, is thwarted; he
learns about a PHG, something
that sounds like the Chemical
Handbook on Brownian move
ment: "A continuous agitation of
particles in a colloidal solution
caused by unbalanced impacts
with molecules of the surround
ing medium." In no case is he to
react with kindness to the adoles
cent wanderers though he was
one long ago. Rather, he is inhib
ited for "the guys have generally

had enough run-ins with Univer
sity regulations ..."
All is not lost. He will have the
; perogative of vomiting off a Mem
! And balcony, if not dinner then
j simplisitic obscenities. If all of
! this is surprising, one only need
| remember that the admission for
: mula is "choosing the farmers."
Perhaps the final conclusion is
that formulas are too important
at Stanford, that the Daily's neat
, presentation of the freshman may
| do more to insure the perpetua
! tion of unhallowed and shallow
| traditions than anything else.
But we are with Frosh "enthu-
I siastic about new 'in depth' semi
nars." Hopefully now upperclass
men must assume the awsome re
! sponsibility of whistling and caw
ing at the Sunday flicks.

Editor, The Daily:
The Frosh Edition of the Daily
was both disappointing and anger
ing; one might wonder if the edi
tors should not add a supplement 1
of apology to the freshmen as well j
as to the surrounding high school j
population.
I am especially upset by the ar-'
tides on the Flicks, the Admission
policy, and the tabloid "exposure"
of "Paly high girls" (who for the
factually minded also come from 1
Belmont, San Carlos, Los Altos, j
Crystal Springs, etc.).
These articles had in common a
portrayal of the Stanford Fresh
man which describes an erotic-ally
frustrated fool who inveigles a
high school student, (perhaps on
her suggestion) to a car, trans
forming political conversation by

agile sleight of hand to conversa
tion in the sexual sense.
If he has, perchance, arrived un
repressed, the Daily et al tell him
unto death that between the ratio
and the fraternity he may hence
expect unconditional celibacy.
The freshman who might want
to know the high school girl as a
human being, is thwarted; he
learns about a PHG, something
that sounds like the Chemical
Handbook on Brownian move
ment: "A continuous agitation of
particles in a colloidal solution
caused by unbalanced impacts
with molecules of the surround
ing medium." In no case is he to
react with kindness to the adoles
cent wanderers though he was
one long ago. Rather, he is inhib
ited for "the guys have generally

had enough run-ins with Univer
sity regulations ..."
