## Reg Day on the Farm: Paying Is Still a Privilege 
### Jim Selna 
Traditionally Reg Day on the |
Farm is one part waiting, one part :
confusion, and one part bureau
: cracy. The first two ingredients
! are supplied by the students. Har
i vey Hall's magnificent corps of j
rubber stampers supplies the lat- j
j ter ingredient.
This year absorption of st u-j
; dents proved to bo exceedingly
I smooth. It was obvious to the
i trained eye that the Registrar's j
i Office had successfully done its j
| homework over the summer. Us- j
ing a delicate combination of riot
i control tactics and time and mo
tion principles, ten thousand plus
â–  students were gently shepherded
through the process.
This reporter was scheduled lo
pass through Mem Aud between
j 9 and 10 yesterday morning. It
! took me 45 minutes to get from
j White Memorial Plaza to the |
Mom Aud. and I am in pretty I
' good physical condition. It was
neither the heat nor the crowds
of students that slowed my prog
ress, but the familiar faces that I j
; had not seerl all summer.
Academic Reckoning
Once inside the auditorium, bus i

iness was somewhat more serious. |
Registration packages temporar
ily clouded the rosey memories of
spring quarter for an unsuspect-!
ing few. For inside each package
was a transcript the day of aca
demic reckoning had arrived.
On the brighter side of things,
some of Stanford's best also
found congratulations from Dean ;
Winbigler for making the Dean's
List.
One freshman confessed that |
the hardest part of the whole or- !
deal was making his way from i
Mem Aud to the Pavillion. Beard- :
ed campus act ivists were staunch- 1
ly guarding all four corners at I
the intersection of Serra and Gal- j
vez. Right of passage was easily i
obtained by the acceptance of one
of their leaflets.
Curious Arrangement
Alas, there was still the gaunt
let of recruiting boothes to pass
through before the entering the'
safety of the Pavillion.
The arrangement of boothes
was curious indeed. The Young
Republicans were on the light
side of the walk way, flanked by
an medieval tent which housed a
lovely recruiter for the Sequoia.
Farther down the line a student
recruiter for the Air Force ROTC
program was peaceably talking
to members of the Socialist Cau
cus booth next door, while the So
cialists were handing out litera j
ture on the benefits of being a j
conscientious objector.
Across from the YR's were the j
Young Democrats nestled be- |
tween the American Civil Liber- i
ties Union and the Stanford ;
Friends of Civil Liberties. What
is that saying about birds of a ;
feather? , * j
Privilege, Not Right
At long last. I was given the;
privilege, not a right, you know, j
of paying $525 tuition. One stu
dent gleefully told me that the
cashiers wore so happy to take I
his check that they didn't even i
ask for identification.
"The Final Step" was rough. A j
little old lady carefully sorted j
through my cards and gently |
chided me for not signing my stu- ;
dent body card. A stroke of the i
pen and I complied, she stamped [
my card, and Reg was over.
As one senior tactfully put it.,
"Here we go again!"
