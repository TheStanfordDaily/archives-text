# Student-Faculty Organization Promotes University Dialogue
## 
### 
Stanford's only student-faculty
mass organization, the Stanford
Association of University Schol
are iSAI'S), will begin its second
quarter of operation this fall.
The organization, whose mem
bership last year included some
2.1 professors and more than 75
students from all classes, was
formed in light of last winter's

campus unrest. Its main purpose,
as "Saturday Review" recently
noted, is "to help rethink what is
the proper way to govern a uni
versity today."
"At the same time," noted Bob
Rosen, the graduate history stu
dent who launched the organiza
tion, "we want to stress the com
mon interests of all I lie practicing
scholars at the University. By
'scholars,' we mean 'journeymen'
as well as 'apprentices,' freshmen
as well as professors."
Generally, SAUS aims to pro
vide a means for regular easy
communication between students
and faculty, and between this
joint body and the administration.
Such communication would hope
fully eliminate crises such as oc
curred at Berkeley, by allowing
each group representation and re
sponsibility in governing the aca
demic community, and would
make the University more respon
sive to its members' needs.
Organizationally, SAUS is di
vided into four committees: com
munication and coordination of
if leas with other schools; the
scholar in society; the scholarly
community from living groups
to student • faculty contact ; and
academic affairs curriculum. Ac
cording to Rosen, the committees
will again discuss and research
their particular field and issue re
ports to the community.
