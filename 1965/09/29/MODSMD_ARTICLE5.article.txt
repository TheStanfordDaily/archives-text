# Compromise Reached On Judicial Reform
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
For the second time in six
months, representatives of the
student body, Ihe faculty, and the
administration have reached an
agreement on the Judicial Compe
tence Bill, passed by the Legisla
ture February 2.x
The agreement, to be announced
after a final meeting of the nego
tiators at noon today, will not
differ substantially from the com
promise reached on the contro
versial judicial reform bill early
in April by the Committee of Fif
teen, informed sources told The
Daily yesterday.
It still must be approved by
LASSU, by the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and by President Wallace Ster
ling.
The original bill stated, in part,
"No student conduct may be ad
judged a violation of the Funda
mental Standard (by ASSU ju
dicial councils) by virtue of being
contrary to University policy un
less such policy has previously
been officially communicated to

the ASSU President and has been
recognized by a two-thirds vole
of Legislature ..."
On March 3, the Committee on
University Policy (COUP) called
for the creation of a negotiating
body of students, faculty, and ad
ministrators to seek an agree
ment on the bill acceptable to all
three factions. In early April this
Committee of Fifteen produced a
compromise resolution which al
lowed, in part, that where "Uni
versity policy or laws conflict
with the ASSU Constitution or
By Laws, the latter shall be con
trolling."
LASSU complied with the reso-j
lution, and passed a revised bill
which it considered to be in ac-1
cord with the Committee's con-}
sensus.
COUP and the Academic Coun- J
cil Executive Committee? gave j
their approval to the resolution
on April 9, but attached three con

ditional "interpretations" to it,
Some members of the faculty
notably Prof. John A. McDonough
of the Committee of Fifteen,
"didn't think the LASSU bill was
consistent with the spirit and let
ter of the resolution," according
to Prof. Benjamin M. Page, Chair
man of the Executive Committee,
Consequently, another negotia
ting committee, the one that shall
report today, was created at the
end of the year.
Student members of the com
mittee were LASSU Speaker Jay
Kadane, ASSU President Sandy
Mackenzie, former LASSU Speak
J er Ed Shaw, Rob Sangster, Gary

i Faculty and administration rep
resentatives were Page, McDon

For the second time in six
months, representatives of the
student body, Ihe faculty, and the
administration have reached an
agreement on the Judicial Compe
tence Bill, passed by the Legisla
ture February 2.x
The agreement, to be announced
after a final meeting of the nego
tiators at noon today, will not
differ substantially from the com
promise reached on the contro
versial judicial reform bill early
in April by the Committee of Fif
teen, informed sources told The
Daily yesterday.
It still must be approved by
LASSU, by the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council,
and by President Wallace Ster
ling.
The original bill stated, in part,
"No student conduct may be ad
judged a violation of the Funda
mental Standard (by ASSU ju
dicial councils) by virtue of being
contrary to University policy un
less such policy has previously
been officially communicated to

the ASSU President and has been
recognized by a two-thirds vole
of Legislature ..."
On March 3, the Committee on
University Policy (COUP) called
for the creation of a negotiating
body of students, faculty, and ad
ministrators to seek an agree
ment on the bill acceptable to all
three factions. In early April this
Committee of Fifteen produced a
compromise resolution which al
lowed, in part, that where "Uni
versity policy or laws conflict
with the ASSU Constitution or
By Laws, the latter shall be con
trolling."
LASSU complied with the reso-j
lution, and passed a revised bill
which it considered to be in ac-1
cord with the Committee's con-}
sensus.

cil Executive Committee? gave j
their approval to the resolution
on April 9, but attached three con
