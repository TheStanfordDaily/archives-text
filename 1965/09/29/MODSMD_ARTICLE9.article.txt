## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
A group of students is being organized i<> support striking farm
workers in the central California grape growing region.
Dave Harris, a sponsor in Wilbur Hall, said that an ad hoc com
mittee was being formed 10 solicit funds and make the campus
j aware of the situation. Harris told The Daily, "The plight is well

worth the attention of the Stan-;
ford student, body."
The striking organizations are
the Agricultural Workers Organ-!
izing Committee (AWOC) and the '
Farm Workers Organization,
headed by Ceasar Chavez. Be- i
tween three and four thousand
workers are striking 30 farms in
Kern and Tulare counties.
Scene of Projects
In past years many Stanford)
students have participated in farm
work projects in the struck region.
Harris spent the past summer
working in the Central California
fields.
In a telephone interview with!
The Daily, A1 Green. Director of'
AWOC. described the harrassment
and intimidation that the strikers
are undergoing.
The strikers are asking for an
increase of 15 cents an hour to j
$1.40 and 25 cents a box. More im
portantly the unions arc seeking
a contract with the farmers.
In a similar dispute earlier in
the year in the Coachella Valley
farmers agreed to meet wage de
mands, but refused to sign n con
tract. In the past farmers have re
fused to enter in union contracts
or recognizing the collective bar
gaining powers of the the unions.
Bomb Threat*
Strikers have been sprayed
from planes with sulphur solu
tions. locked out of their camps,
and threatened with bombings, ac-;

cording to Green. One incident was
reported of a grower shooting the
placard out of the hands of a
picket.
Green noted that the strike was
first proposed by the members and
then sanctioned by the union. He
said that strikers, many of them
itinerants since they were old
enough to pick, were trying for the
"first time to better their lot."
AWOC was founded in 1959 and
is an affiliate of the American Fed
eration of Labor. The teamsters
are honoring AWOC's picket lines.
The strike is also supported by
COROC, a Mexican farm labor or
ganization, and the Council of
Churches.
Harris said that he was in the
process of obtaining approval for
the solicitation of funds. Plans are
being laid f or a noon t ime program
in White Memorial Plaza to bring
the problems to the student body.
