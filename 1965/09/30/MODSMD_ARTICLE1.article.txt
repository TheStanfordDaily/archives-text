# The 						Selective Service vs. the College Man
## 
### HENRY MULLER Feature Editor 
The current draft situation is
critical for college students, be
lieves Stanford's national services
adviser, Walter J. Findeisen.
The problem, he declarod in a
Daily interview, is caused by the
Defense Department's increasing
selectivity in choosing manpower.
More than ever before they are
looking for men who meet more
rigorous mental, moral, and phys
ical standards.
In recent months, he added, the
rate of rejection of draftees who
do not qualify according to these
standards is higher than it has
ever been before.
Thest requirements, according
to Findeisen, place the college
student in greater jeopardy than
at any time since the Korean War,
for the average college man is in
a better position to meet these

! standards than most of his con
temporaries who are not in
school. Findeisen was quick to
emphasize, however, that students
who are making "normal and sat
isfactory progress" in pursuing
their studies need not worry
about being drafted.
"Dropouts" Face Dral't Call
It is the students who are drop
ping out for periods even as short
as a quarter, he said, who risk
being drafted. Fifth-year under
graduates and students not tak
ing a full load are also in a very
precarious position as far as the
Selective Service is concerned.
When asked about students
who enroll for the summer quar
ter at Stanford and consequently
drop out for one quarter during
tiie regular academic year, Fin
deisen said that they will simply
have to change this practice un
less they want to face a draft call.

The Selective Service requires a
three-quarter academic year and
insists on autumn, winter, and
spring.
He pointed out, however, that
the decision to draft someone is
solely up to that person's local
board and that some boards are
more "sympathetic and compas
sionate" than others. The boards
are each completely autonomous
and will sometimes grant special
dispensations.

Findeisen advised, however, that
students should make arrange
ments with their local boards be
fore taking off on an independent
course of action. He said that the
chances of obtaining special dis
pensations were much greater if
the matter were discussed before
hand.
He continued by recommending
that students should not just
speak to the clerks of their board.

their case formally in writing.
Clerks, he said, often do not have
the authority to speak for the
board. With a written request,
however, a student is guaranteed
proper consideration and a reply.
Academic Standing
When asked about the impor
tance of academic standing, Fin
deisen said that at the present
time there is no requirement for
high academic standing for a de
ferment. However, he mentioned
that there is some discussion of
reinstating the system used until
three years ago. At that time, the
student's rank in his class was a
consideration of the board in
granting deferments.
This is substantiated by a recent
report in the Palo Alto Times
which claims thaft some state
boards are going to require that
students submit transcripts to
show that they are not only car
rying full loads, but are making

good grades as well.
According to Findeisen, grad- j
uate students will continue to be!
able to obtain deferments just j
like any other students. During;
the Korean War, many Law and
Business School students were
drafted.
LBJ I no reused Draft
The look to the campus for can
didates for the draft comes as a
result of President Johnson's re
cent order that the monthly draft
call be increased to 35,001) for No
vember. The pre-Vietnam draft
call ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 per
month.
It is believed that the draft may
be increased to 50,000 men before
! long. At the height of the Korean
! War, it ranged between 90,000
| and 100,000 per month.
Another result of President j
Johnson's order is that Selective i
Service boards in several states >
plan to tighten rules deferring;

i college students. Some of the
i states planning to review defer
! ments are Connecticut, Delaware,
j Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas,
Maryland, Michigan, North Caro
lina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Wash
ington, West Virginia, and per
haps California and Texas.
Findeisen mentioned that the
chances are slight that newly
drafted men will be Sent to Viet
nam. He said that the nature of
the war is such that a highly spe
cialized army is needed for the
conflict. Most of the men there
at the present time, he said, are
regulars who have the necessary
skill and training.
Future Draft?
When asked of the possibility
that students pursuing their stud
i ies in a "normal and acceptable
| fashion" woidd be drafted at some
j time in the future, Findeisen said
| there is not even a remote chance.
Findeisen also mentioned that

at the beginning of every school
year anyone who is registered
with the Selective Service and has
a student deferment must advise
his local board of his plans for
the coming year. For the con
venience of students enrolled at
Stanford, each registration pack
et will contain a Selective Serv
ice Information Card. It is the
student's responsibility to fill it
out and see that it is sent to his
board.
He added that "the people on
the boards are not ogres; they
have jobs and tht only way they
can do their jobs is to be informed
about student status."
He reminds students who are
not yet registered with the Selec
tive Service that they must do so
within five days after their eight
eenth birthday. The national serv
ices office in room 102-J will be
glad to assist students with this
procedure.

Academic Standing
When asked about the impor
tance of academic standing, Fin
deisen said that at the present
time there is no requirement for
high academic standing for a de
ferment. However, he mentioned
that there is some discussion of
reinstating the system used until
three years ago. At that time, the
student's rank in his class was a
consideration of the board in
granting deferments.
This is substantiated by a recent
report in the Palo Alto Times
which claims thaft some state
boards are going to require that
students submit transcripts to
show that they are not only car
rying full loads, but are making

good grades as well.
According to Findeisen, grad- j
uate students will continue to be!
able to obtain deferments just j
like any other students. During;
the Korean War, many Law and
Business School students were
drafted.
LBJ I no reused Draft
The look to the campus for can
didates for the draft comes as a
result of President Johnson's re
cent order that the monthly draft
call be increased to 35,001) for No
vember. The pre-Vietnam draft
call ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 per
month.
It is believed that the draft may
be increased to 50,000 men before
! long. At the height of the Korean
! War, it ranged between 90,000
| and 100,000 per month.
Another result of President j
Johnson's order is that Selective i
Service boards in several states >
plan to tighten rules deferring;

i college students. Some of the
i states planning to review defer
! ments are Connecticut, Delaware,
j Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas,
Maryland, Michigan, North Caro
lina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Wash
ington, West Virginia, and per
haps California and Texas.
Findeisen mentioned that the
chances are slight that newly
drafted men will be Sent to Viet
nam. He said that the nature of
the war is such that a highly spe
cialized army is needed for the
conflict. Most of the men there
at the present time, he said, are
regulars who have the necessary
skill and training.
Future Draft?
When asked of the possibility
that students pursuing their stud
i ies in a "normal and acceptable
| fashion" woidd be drafted at some
j time in the future, Findeisen said
| there is not even a remote chance.
Findeisen also mentioned that

at the beginning of every school
year anyone who is registered
with the Selective Service and has
a student deferment must advise
his local board of his plans for
the coming year. For the con
venience of students enrolled at
Stanford, each registration pack
et will contain a Selective Serv
ice Information Card. It is the
student's responsibility to fill it
out and see that it is sent to his
board.
He added that "the people on
the boards are not ogres; they
have jobs and tht only way they
can do their jobs is to be informed
about student status."
He reminds students who are
not yet registered with the Selec
tive Service that they must do so
within five days after their eight
eenth birthday. The national serv
ices office in room 102-J will be
glad to assist students with this
procedure.
The current draft situation is
critical for college students, be
lieves Stanford's national services
adviser, Walter J. Findeisen.
The problem, he declarod in a
Daily interview, is caused by the
Defense Department's increasing
selectivity in choosing manpower.
More than ever before they are
looking for men who meet more
rigorous mental, moral, and phys
ical standards.
In recent months, he added, the
rate of rejection of draftees who
do not qualify according to these
standards is higher than it has
ever been before.
Thest requirements, according
to Findeisen, place the college
student in greater jeopardy than
at any time since the Korean War,
for the average college man is in
a better position to meet these

! standards than most of his con
temporaries who are not in
school. Findeisen was quick to
emphasize, however, that students
who are making "normal and sat
isfactory progress" in pursuing
their studies need not worry
about being drafted.
"Dropouts" Face Dral't Call
It is the students who are drop
ping out for periods even as short
as a quarter, he said, who risk
being drafted. Fifth-year under
graduates and students not tak
ing a full load are also in a very
precarious position as far as the
Selective Service is concerned.
When asked about students
who enroll for the summer quar
ter at Stanford and consequently
drop out for one quarter during
tiie regular academic year, Fin
deisen said that they will simply
have to change this practice un
less they want to face a draft call.

The Selective Service requires a
three-quarter academic year and
insists on autumn, winter, and
spring.
He pointed out, however, that
the decision to draft someone is
solely up to that person's local
board and that some boards are
more "sympathetic and compas
sionate" than others. The boards
are each completely autonomous
and will sometimes grant special
dispensations.

Findeisen advised, however, that

Findeisen mentioned that the
chances are slight that newly
drafted men will be Sent to Viet
nam. He said that the nature of
the war is such that a highly spe
cialized army is needed for the
conflict. Most of the men there
at the present time, he said, are
regulars who have the necessary
skill and training.
Future Draft?
When asked of the possibility
that students pursuing their stud
i ies in a "normal and acceptable
| fashion" woidd be drafted at some
j time in the future, Findeisen said
| there is not even a remote chance.
Findeisen also mentioned that

at the beginning of every school
year anyone who is registered
with the Selective Service and has
a student deferment must advise
his local board of his plans for
the coming year. For the con
venience of students enrolled at
Stanford, each registration pack
et will contain a Selective Serv
ice Information Card. It is the
student's responsibility to fill it
out and see that it is sent to his
board.
He added that "the people on
the boards are not ogres; they
have jobs and tht only way they
can do their jobs is to be informed
about student status."
He reminds students who are
not yet registered with the Selec
tive Service that they must do so
within five days after their eight
eenth birthday. The national serv
ices office in room 102-J will be
glad to assist students with this
procedure.
The current draft situation is
critical for college students, be
lieves Stanford's national services
adviser, Walter J. Findeisen.
The problem, he declarod in a
Daily interview, is caused by the
Defense Department's increasing
selectivity in choosing manpower.
More than ever before they are
looking for men who meet more
rigorous mental, moral, and phys
ical standards.
In recent months, he added, the
rate of rejection of draftees who
do not qualify according to these
standards is higher than it has
ever been before.
Thest requirements, according
to Findeisen, place the college
student in greater jeopardy than
at any time since the Korean War,
for the average college man is in
a better position to meet these

! standards than most of his con
temporaries who are not in
school. Findeisen was quick to
emphasize, however, that students
who are making "normal and sat
isfactory progress" in pursuing
their studies need not worry
about being drafted.
"Dropouts" Face Dral't Call
It is the students who are drop
ping out for periods even as short
as a quarter, he said, who risk
being drafted. Fifth-year under
graduates and students not tak
ing a full load are also in a very
precarious position as far as the
Selective Service is concerned.
When asked about students
who enroll for the summer quar
ter at Stanford and consequently
drop out for one quarter during
tiie regular academic year, Fin
deisen said that they will simply
have to change this practice un
less they want to face a draft call.

The Selective Service requires a
three-quarter academic year and
insists on autumn, winter, and
spring.
He pointed out, however, that
the decision to draft someone is
solely up to that person's local
board and that some boards are
more "sympathetic and compas
sionate" than others. The boards
are each completely autonomous
and will sometimes grant special
dispensations.
See Loca I Board
Findeisen advised, however, that
students should make arrange
ments with their local boards be
fore taking off on an independent
course of action. He said that the
chances of obtaining special dis
pensations were much greater if
the matter were discussed before
hand.
He continued by recommending
that students should not just
speak to the clerks of their board.

their case formally in writing.
Clerks, he said, often do not have
the authority to speak for the
board. With a written request,
however, a student is guaranteed
proper consideration and a reply.
Academic Standing
When asked about the impor
tance of academic standing, Fin
deisen said that at the present
time there is no requirement for
high academic standing for a de
ferment. However, he mentioned
that there is some discussion of
reinstating the system used until
three years ago. At that time, the
student's rank in his class was a
consideration of the board in
granting deferments.
This is substantiated by a recent
report in the Palo Alto Times
which claims thaft some state
boards are going to require that
students submit transcripts to
show that they are not only car
rying full loads, but are making

good grades as well.
According to Findeisen, grad- j
uate students will continue to be!
able to obtain deferments just j
like any other students. During;
the Korean War, many Law and
Business School students were
drafted.
LBJ I no reused Draft
The look to the campus for can
didates for the draft comes as a
result of President Johnson's re
cent order that the monthly draft
call be increased to 35,001) for No

call ranged from 3,000 to 4,000 per

It is believed that the draft may
