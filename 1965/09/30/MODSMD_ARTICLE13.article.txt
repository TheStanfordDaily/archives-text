# Water Polo Squad Strong, Hosts El Camino in Opener
## 
### Wells Shoemaker 
Stanford's varsity water polo
team opens one of its most inter
esting seasons in years this Fri
day, with the Indians faring El
Camino College. Following the
varsity game, the freshmen meet
College of Sequoias.
The Cards, under Coach Jim
Gaughran, boast a strong team

I with a number of veterans rein
[ forced by last year's outstand
ing frosh squad. Captain Mike
Eshelman and sophomores Gary
Sheerer and Pete Ready will form
the spearhead of the Tribe attack.
Thrust and Depth
Sophomores Rill Meyer and
Mark Parmely, juniors Bill Der
rig and Doug Jensen, and senior

Jeff Beck should provide power
ful offensive and defensive
thrust. Walt Poterbin, Doug Mac-
Lean, Mike Wall and Craig
Brown, vying for starting posi
tions, field impressive depth to
the Card squad.
Goalie duties have been passed
to Mike Sorem and Vance Sym
onds.
The varsity has speed and deft
ball handling, and apparently it
will need every bit. The AAWU
is stronger on every side than it
has been in years.
Foes Threaten
USC brings back a large por
tion of its potent '64 squad.
UCLA, which swam a strong
squad last season, adds a talented
host of sophomores to the active
list. Cal, whose frosh squad vied
with Stanford's for top NorCal
honors last season, should give
the Tribe some stiff competition.
Foothill College, which has
emerged in the last few years as
one of the nation's top water polo
powers, will give the Indians a
run for their skins. San Jose has
its best team in years, and the
Olympic Club and Long Boach
State pose perennial threats.
Frosh Potent
Stanford's freshmen do not
have a great quantity of experi
enced players, but those'they do
have are poloists with dem
onstrated potential. Dick Roth, j
Polo Siebert, Luis Nieolao and |
Paul Meyer will form a solid nu- j
cleus for the frosh.
Jimmie Smith, 31-year veteran ;
coach from Fullerton JC, will j
take charge of the Papooses. In
his highly successful career at
Fullerton, Coach Smith amassed
16 team championships.
Coach Smith has a large num-j
ber of outstanding freshman !
swimmers to develop into water ,
poloists. Jeff Hammett, Tom j
Jameson, Bob Hart, Morgan Man- j
ning, and Doug Chapin, with j
some development, should put |
speed and muscle into the promis- j
ing squad.

the Card squad.
Goalie duties have been passed
to Mike Sorem and Vance Sym
onds.
The varsity has speed and deft
ball handling, and apparently it
will need every bit. The AAWU
is stronger on every side than it
has been in years.
Foes Threaten
USC brings back a large por
tion of its potent '64 squad.
UCLA, which swam a strong
squad last season, adds a talented
host of sophomores to the active
list. Cal, whose frosh squad vied
with Stanford's for top NorCal
honors last season, should give
the Tribe some stiff competition.
Foothill College, which has
emerged in the last few years as
one of the nation's top water polo
powers, will give the Indians a
run for their skins. San Jose has
its best team in years, and the
Olympic Club and Long Boach
State pose perennial threats.
Frosh Potent
Stanford's freshmen do not
have a great quantity of experi
enced players, but those'they do
have are poloists with dem
onstrated potential. Dick Roth, j
Polo Siebert, Luis Nieolao and |
Paul Meyer will form a solid nu- j
cleus for the frosh.
Jimmie Smith, 31-year veteran ;
coach from Fullerton JC, will j
take charge of the Papooses. In
his highly successful career at
Fullerton, Coach Smith amassed
16 team championships.
Coach Smith has a large num-j
ber of outstanding freshman !
swimmers to develop into water ,
poloists. Jeff Hammett, Tom j
Jameson, Bob Hart, Morgan Man- j
ning, and Doug Chapin, with j
some development, should put |
speed and muscle into the promis- j
ing squad.
Stanford's varsity water polo
team opens one of its most inter
esting seasons in years this Fri
day, with the Indians faring El
Camino College. Following the
varsity game, the freshmen meet
College of Sequoias.
The Cards, under Coach Jim
Gaughran, boast a strong team

I with a number of veterans rein
[ forced by last year's outstand
ing frosh squad. Captain Mike
Eshelman and sophomores Gary
Sheerer and Pete Ready will form
the spearhead of the Tribe attack.
Thrust and Depth
Sophomores Rill Meyer and
Mark Parmely, juniors Bill Der
rig and Doug Jensen, and senior

Jeff Beck should provide power
ful offensive and defensive
thrust. Walt Poterbin, Doug Mac-
Lean, Mike Wall and Craig
Brown, vying for starting posi
tions, field impressive depth to
the Card squad.
