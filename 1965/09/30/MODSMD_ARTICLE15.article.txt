# Co-Captain Out of Play
## 
### 
Stanford's All-American grid
candidate and varsity co-captain
Gary Pettigrew, who was injured
in last Saturday's gamo against
Navy, will receive surgery on his
knee today, and will not return
to Ihe field for some time.
Pettigrew, a six-foot-four, 215
pound defensive tackle, injured
his leg in a first quarter option
play run by Navy halfback Rood
house. The loss of this powerful
lineman proved fateful to the In
dian defense, which failed to pre
vent Navy from scoring five min
utes later.
Twice a varsity letterman,
"Grew" seemed 1o be a very prob
able All-America pick. Talented
and motivated, a senior English
major, he makes an ideal co-cap
tain. Exactly when he will play
again is as yet unknown.
Kelirli Too
In the same game, Indian of
fensive guard Bruce Kehrli was
also injured. Kehrli's injury came
in the second quarter on a keeper
play which saw Quarterback
Dave Lewis gain two yards off
left side.
Kehrli, who also holds two vars
ity letters, has the speed and
blocking ability which makes him
a stalwart of Stanford's offense.
It is probable that he will be back
on the line within two weeks.
A senior, Bruce is an indus
trial engineering major.
