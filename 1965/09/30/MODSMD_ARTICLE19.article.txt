# The 						Logic of Berkeley
## 
### 
For those administrators and other conservative
folk who cherish the status quo on this campus
and regard the resurgent Legislature and the* ac
tivist GCC with alarm if not disdain, some recent
developments at Berkeley may give pause to a
short prayer of Thanksgiving.
Turmoil and paradox are not quite strong
enough terms to describe the situation.
"If it moves, fondle it" is the slogan embla
zoned on one of the pins being distributed by the
Campus Sexual Freedom forum. This group, led
by one Larry Baldwin, not only declares its vo
ciferous support of absolute freedom in the
areas of sex and dress—or undress if you like—
but is also reportedly planning to stage an on
campus demonstration ol its convictions a la this

last summer's nude wade-in at Aquatic Park in
San Francisco.
The traditionalists are barely surviving, them
selves. The Daily Cat reports that one fraternity
has already folded and three other Greek groups
are approaching the same fate because ol a "dis
astrous rush" induced by last year's FSM crisis.
Logically, these two developments, along with
last year's FSM crisis, should further the Berkeley
campus along the road to financial extinction —
donors being what they are.
Or are they?
Total gifts to the Berkeley campus totaled 9
million last year—an increase of 40 per cent.
Logical? Indeed. To an all-knowing Western
Civ. instructor.
