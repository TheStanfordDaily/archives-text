# Tutoring Project Expands Again
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
The satisfaction of service, the i
rewards of teaching, an under
standing of contemporary social •
problems plus the opportunity I
of picking up an activity credit •
is what is offered to stu !
dents participating in the Stan-1
ford Tutors program.
The program, relates coordin
ator Mrs. Louise Pierce of the
education department, was initi- !
ated three years ago to help mar- i
ginal students in East Palo Alto, i
a largely Negro community.
The program me! with such a
tremendous response that its size ;
has been doubled each year. Last
year two hundred Stanford stu
dents were tutors and several '
other local high schools were in
corporated into the program.
Further expansion is planned
this fall. Project planners the!
program is co-sponsored by NSA
and the Stanford education de
partment are looking forward
to having 400 tutors this year and
hope to set up several new special j
programs in Ravenswood.
One of the programs at Ravens- j
wood will be the weekly admin- J
istering of standardized college j
admission tests to high school |
seniors. "They usually have no
previous test experience, so the!
admissions test is rather frighten-j
ing. We want to prepare them ;
psychologically for the test," Mrs. |
Pierce explains.
A second program aims to pre-i
pare drop-outs for the govern
ment "high school equivalent"j
test. "Many employers require a ■
high school diploma. A person
passing this test receives a cer
tificate stating he achieved at a
level equivalent to that of a high
school graduate," says Mrs.
Pierce.
They also hope to begin tutor
ing in homes of elementary and i
junior high school children.!
"These kids are at an age where j
we can really bring about some i
change," explains Stanford NSA i
coordinator Dick Williams.
Williams also stresses the
value of the program to the
tutors. "We think we get more
out of it than do those tutored!
Tutoring reinforces subjects;
learned in high school. More im-1
portantly, the program acquaints i
Stanford students with a com
munity most unlike the one they
come from, one where there is
job freeze; people no longer value:
education and without education
cannot get good jobs.
"The program has also brought '
great rewards to the tutors by i
showing they can be of service." |
NSA tutorial program director :
Sheldon Shacffer is already
scheduling training sessions,
beginning within two weeks I
and continuing at three-week in-j
tervals through the year. The j
one-day sessions will feature an ;
introduction to the community. ;
teaching techniques, and eau- :
tions. "This is no charity oper
ation," states Williams. "We!

want to establish person-to-per
son relations."
In both the new programs and
t lie high school tutoring, teaching
is done in all academic fields.
"There is much more to be done
than personnel to do it." Mrs.
Pierce says.
"The magnitude of the contri
bution of the students in the past
two years makes the tutoring
program something the Univer
sity can be proud of. These people
are living their convictions, not
just talking them," she states.
Tutors work two hours a
week. Signups are being held in
room C-l, Cubberley basement,
and at NSA headquarters in the
ASSU offices.
