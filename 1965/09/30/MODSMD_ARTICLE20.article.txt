# On The Right
## Victory Formula: Brilliant Teeth And a Concise Package Program 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
If you live in a large city and
desire to run for mayor, on what
platform, pray, will you run?
What has John Lindsay of New
York decided to run on? One met
ropolitan newspaper has carefully
and enthusiastically recorded his
attributes, the most significant of
which, some observers have
noted, is tho brilliance of his
teeth. (Yes, that was a qualifica
tion solemnly remarked by one
major newspaper.)
When the press mulcted from
Candidate Lindsay the specific
ideas he had for New York, he
temporarily deserted his Speng
lerian observations about the de
cline and fall of the City and said
that a) he feared the desertion
of New York by private industry;
1)) he thought something ought
to be done about the flourishing
narcotic trade here; and c) he die!
not believe that sufficieent effort,
had been made to save Brooklyn
Navy Yard. Back to the teeth.
There is, however, the pheno
menon, well remarked by shrewd
observers, that goes under the
name of the "crisis of the Ameri
can city." Such a crisis does exist.
New York — and other major
cities - become, increasingly, un
pleasant places to live in.
A Packaged Program
Would you like to run for May
or? Here is a packaged program:
1. Crime. Teenagers caught and
convicted of felonies will be either
a) put in jail, or b) released in
the recognizance of their parents
or guardians, who will be legally
responsible for recurrent of
fenses. Said parents would have
the right to surrender authority
over fractious children by invok

ing probationary sentences. Com
munities block-wide, or greater,
which, like the Jewish association
: that calls itself The Maccabbees
and has financed its own watch
j men to patrol its own area in a
I crime-ridden quarter of New
j York, will be given pro-tanto re
lief in their property taxes, suf
| ficient to pay the local police bills,
i New Yorkers will, in a word, be
encouraged to look after their
own protection, relieving the mu
nicipal police force of an almost
impossible job.
2. Narcotics. Anti-narcotic laws
for adults should be repealed, and
the English system substituted:
you can get narcotics for the
drug store price of them — pro
vided you come in with a doctor's
prescription. Said doctor will re
new the addict's prescription or
not depending on whether he
submits to medical attention.
Anyone caught selling drugs to
a minor will be subject to 15
years in prison. Take the profit
away from narcotics peddling,
and the narcotic-peddlers go out
of business.
Proposals on Race
3. Race. Petition the state and
federal governments for a sus
penison of property and income
taxes for all Negro or Puerto
Rican entrepreneurs who estab
lish businesses in those areas that
have, by federal decree, been
denominated as depressed areas.
Let Negro entrepreneurs —using
white capital and their own—
moveinto such areas with the
kind of economic encouragement
that has done so much for Puerto
■ Rico in its renowned Operation
' Bootstrap.

4. Traffic. No commercial ve
hicle may load or unload traffic
j between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
Double parkers will be fined $10;
parkers with diplomatic plates
j (they are expected to know bet
ter), $100. And if Jimmy Hoffa
disagrees, why, disagree with
him. Or got out of the mayoralty
race.
5. Labor Unions. Pass legisla
| tion imposing criminal penalties
on any labor union organization
that seeks to prevent any New
Yorker from making his own ar
rangements, on mutually agree
able terms, with any painter, con
struction worker, plumber, elec
trician, or elevator operator.
«. Gambling. Legalize it. Any
body who wants to bet anything
with anybody may do so, and the
prospective mayor wishes every
. single bettor the very best of
j luck, and did you notice the work
out yesterday of Lucky Sadler
who is running on the sth at
Roosevelt on Election Day?
Taxis Anyone?
7. Taxis. Anybody without a
police record may operate any
car as a taxi.
8. Welfare. Anyone receiving
welfare payments who is not a
mother looking after children 14
years or younger, or invalided,
will report for duty at 8:00 a.m.
every morning for street clean
ing and general prettification
work. No workee, no dolee.
112). The minimum wage law will
not apply to children.
10. Any election returns sug
gesting that the mayoralty candi
date running on this program has
been defeated will be challenged
at the courts.

What has John Lindsay of New
York decided to run on? One met
ropolitan newspaper has carefully
and enthusiastically recorded his
attributes, the most significant of
which, some observers have
noted, is tho brilliance of his
teeth. (Yes, that was a qualifica
tion solemnly remarked by one
major newspaper.)
When the press mulcted from
Candidate Lindsay the specific
ideas he had for New York, he
temporarily deserted his Speng
lerian observations about the de
cline and fall of the City and said
that a) he feared the desertion
of New York by private industry;
1)) he thought something ought
to be done about the flourishing
narcotic trade here; and c) he die!
not believe that sufficieent effort,
had been made to save Brooklyn
Navy Yard. Back to the teeth.
There is, however, the pheno
menon, well remarked by shrewd
observers, that goes under the
name of the "crisis of the Ameri
can city." Such a crisis does exist.
New York — and other major
cities - become, increasingly, un
pleasant places to live in.

encouraged to look after their
own protection, relieving the mu

When the press mulcted from
Candidate Lindsay the specific
ideas he had for New York, he
temporarily deserted his Speng

that a) he feared the desertion

to be done about the flourishing
narcotic trade here; and c) he die!

Navy Yard. Back to the teeth.
There is, however, the pheno

New York — and other major
cities - become, increasingly, un
pleasant places to live in.
A Packaged Program
Would you like to run for May
or? Here is a packaged program:
1. Crime. Teenagers caught and
convicted of felonies will be either
a) put in jail, or b) released in
the recognizance of their parents
or guardians, who will be legally
responsible for recurrent of
fenses. Said parents would have
the right to surrender authority
over fractious children by invok

ing probationary sentences. Com
munities block-wide, or greater,
which, like the Jewish association
: that calls itself The Maccabbees
and has financed its own watch
j men to patrol its own area in a
I crime-ridden quarter of New
j York, will be given pro-tanto re
lief in their property taxes, suf
| ficient to pay the local police bills,
i New Yorkers will, in a word, be
encouraged to look after their
own protection, relieving the mu
nicipal police force of an almost
impossible job.
2. Narcotics. Anti-narcotic laws
for adults should be repealed, and
the English system substituted:
you can get narcotics for the
drug store price of them — pro
vided you come in with a doctor's
prescription. Said doctor will re
new the addict's prescription or
not depending on whether he
submits to medical attention.
Anyone caught selling drugs to
a minor will be subject to 15
years in prison. Take the profit
away from narcotics peddling,
and the narcotic-peddlers go out
of business.
Proposals on Race
3. Race. Petition the state and
federal governments for a sus
penison of property and income
taxes for all Negro or Puerto
Rican entrepreneurs who estab
lish businesses in those areas that
have, by federal decree, been
denominated as depressed areas.
Let Negro entrepreneurs —using
white capital and their own—
moveinto such areas with the
kind of economic encouragement
that has done so much for Puerto
■ Rico in its renowned Operation
' Bootstrap.

4. Traffic. No commercial ve
hicle may load or unload traffic
j between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.

him. Or got out of the mayoralty
race.
5. Labor Unions. Pass legisla
| tion imposing criminal penalties
on any labor union organization
that seeks to prevent any New
Yorker from making his own ar
rangements, on mutually agree
able terms, with any painter, con
struction worker, plumber, elec
trician, or elevator operator.
«. Gambling. Legalize it. Any
body who wants to bet anything
with anybody may do so, and the
prospective mayor wishes every
. single bettor the very best of
j luck, and did you notice the work
out yesterday of Lucky Sadler
who is running on the sth at
Roosevelt on Election Day?
Taxis Anyone?
7. Taxis. Anybody without a
police record may operate any
car as a taxi.
8. Welfare. Anyone receiving

not apply to children.
10. Any election returns sug
gesting that the mayoralty candi
date running on this program has
been defeated will be challenged
at the courts.
If you live in a large city and
desire to run for mayor, on what
platform, pray, will you run?
