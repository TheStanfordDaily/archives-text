## Second Wind Required To Complete Great Society 
### 
Doing nothing in particular for
a month, yet unable not to read
the papers and keep up with what
is going on, I have been doing
some worrying. The subject of my
worry has been the number and
size of the problems that are in
front of us and how we are to
find the time, the attention and
the energy to deal with them.
I am not thinking only of Viet.
Nam, which is for the present
an insoluble predicament, but of
how the demands upon us are
compounded by what the Los An
geles riot has revealed about the
Negro revolution. We are commit
ted to working out on our own re
sponsibility the new relationships
in Asia between the Western pow
ers and the Asians. This will mark
an historical epoch.
More Far-reaching Changes
At the same time, the same
President, with the same Con
gress and the same electorate, is
compelled to inaugurate and set
in motion more far-reaching
changes in our society than were
ever contemplated in the Johnson
consensus.
In the Los Angeles riot we have
seen how explosive is Negro dis
content set in the environment of
a great city. The United States
has done many great, and good
things in this past century. But
our progress has been marred and
marked by two enormous failures.
The one has been the failure to
make free men of the great mass
of the descendants of the eman
cipated slaves. The other has been
the failure to make our cities,
which are destined to be the home
of the great majority of Ameri
cans, civilized and safe.
In the slums of Los Angeles,
and in the slums of other great
cities, there are the Negro poor—
uneducated, untrained men for
modern industry, left behind in
the cultural progress of the na
tion, coming from broken homes
and without Negro leadership.
They have no coherent program
of demands, but they find a spasm
of relief by going on a rampage
of burning, wrecking, killing and
hating.
Cannot lie Done Quickly
Probably, in fact almost cer
tainly, enough is known by some
of us somewhere to reduce the
grievances and remedy the mis
ery. But fatally this enormous
task cannot be done quickly.
It is optimistic to think that the
social and family conditions and
the cultural backwardness which
are producing an unemployed and
desperate remnant can be reform
ed in one generation. Although
there are always individual ex
ceptions, in the mass the young
rioters are very close to being

past saving, and we have to face j
the grim question of how they |
can be induced to remain quiet ■■
while the necessary reforms for
the benefit of other Negroes are
worked out in the slow processes
of political democracy.
We shall not erase easily the
consequences of slavery and of i
the half - freedom which has fol- j
lowed it.
Another Great Failure
Our other great failure—the
failure to make cities civilized and
safe for the masses who have j
been moviiTfr into them will com
pel us to replan, reconstruct and j
reorganize much of the work and j
living of an increasing part of
i the nation. We have to do this, al-1
though the public institutions of
the states, the counties, the munic
ipalities and the federal govern- j
ment itself were formed in the
IHtJi century when the vast ma
jority lived in the country or in
i small towns.
The American political system j
stems from a time when there
was as yet no problem of the
cities.
The remarking of the cities will j
be a much bigger task than is at;
yet generally understood in this j
country. But the task will have to |
be attempted, for a. nation which
lives in cities (the President says
80 per cent will live in cities by
the year must have cities fit
to live in.
I come back to the subject of j
my worrying. It is not about the j
great costs of what has to be done :
—we can find the money. It is not i
about the disturbance of vested !
interests— that can be endured
and absorbed in a nation which
is in the main so well off.
I am thinking of the politicians j
and the civil servants and the vot
ers who must carry out these
vast and intricate measures and
of how they already have too
much to do and where they are
to find a fresh source of energy
within themselves.
It is reassuring to think of
his legislative program. It shpws
that our political system can be
made to work. And yet, looking
at the legislative program —at
Medicare, education, the war
against poverty — what we have
achieved so far is something like
an architect's plan for the founda
tions of a structure and a few
holes in the ground.
The hardest part of the work 011
the Great Society still lies ahead
of us, ahead of the President,
ahead of the Congress, ahead of 1
the press and the voters.
To realize that extraordinary
demands will be made upon us is
not yet wisdom. But it is the be
ginning of wisdom.

which are destined to be the home
of the great majority of Ameri
cans, civilized and safe.
In the slums of Los Angeles,
and in the slums of other great
cities, there are the Negro poor—
uneducated, untrained men for
modern industry, left behind in
the cultural progress of the na
tion, coming from broken homes
and without Negro leadership.
They have no coherent program
of demands, but they find a spasm
of relief by going on a rampage
of burning, wrecking, killing and
hating.
Cannot lie Done Quickly
Probably, in fact almost cer
tainly, enough is known by some
of us somewhere to reduce the
grievances and remedy the mis
ery. But fatally this enormous
task cannot be done quickly.
It is optimistic to think that the
social and family conditions and
the cultural backwardness which
are producing an unemployed and
desperate remnant can be reform
ed in one generation. Although
there are always individual ex
ceptions, in the mass the young
rioters are very close to being

past saving, and we have to face j
the grim question of how they |
can be induced to remain quiet ■■
while the necessary reforms for
the benefit of other Negroes are
worked out in the slow processes
of political democracy.
We shall not erase easily the
consequences of slavery and of i
the half - freedom which has fol- j
lowed it.
Another Great Failure
Our other great failure—the
failure to make cities civilized and
safe for the masses who have j
been moviiTfr into them will com
pel us to replan, reconstruct and j
reorganize much of the work and j
living of an increasing part of
i the nation. We have to do this, al-1
though the public institutions of
the states, the counties, the munic
ipalities and the federal govern- j
ment itself were formed in the
IHtJi century when the vast ma
jority lived in the country or in
i small towns.
The American political system j
stems from a time when there
was as yet no problem of the
cities.
The remarking of the cities will j
be a much bigger task than is at;
yet generally understood in this j
country. But the task will have to |
be attempted, for a. nation which
lives in cities (the President says
80 per cent will live in cities by
the year must have cities fit
to live in.
I come back to the subject of j
my worrying. It is not about the j
great costs of what has to be done :
—we can find the money. It is not i
about the disturbance of vested !
interests— that can be endured
and absorbed in a nation which
is in the main so well off.
I am thinking of the politicians j
and the civil servants and the vot
ers who must carry out these
vast and intricate measures and
of how they already have too
much to do and where they are
to find a fresh source of energy
within themselves.
It is reassuring to think of
his legislative program. It shpws
that our political system can be
made to work. And yet, looking
at the legislative program —at
Medicare, education, the war
against poverty — what we have
achieved so far is something like
an architect's plan for the founda
tions of a structure and a few
holes in the ground.
The hardest part of the work 011
the Great Society still lies ahead
of us, ahead of the President,
ahead of the Congress, ahead of 1
the press and the voters.
To realize that extraordinary
demands will be made upon us is
not yet wisdom. But it is the be
ginning of wisdom.
Doing nothing in particular for
a month, yet unable not to read
the papers and keep up with what
is going on, I have been doing
some worrying. The subject of my
worry has been the number and
size of the problems that are in
front of us and how we are to
find the time, the attention and
the energy to deal with them.
I am not thinking only of Viet.
Nam, which is for the present
an insoluble predicament, but of
how the demands upon us are
compounded by what the Los An
geles riot has revealed about the
Negro revolution. We are commit
ted to working out on our own re
sponsibility the new relationships
in Asia between the Western pow
ers and the Asians. This will mark
an historical epoch.
More Far-reaching Changes
At the same time, the same
President, with the same Con
gress and the same electorate, is
compelled to inaugurate and set
in motion more far-reaching
changes in our society than were
ever contemplated in the Johnson
consensus.
In the Los Angeles riot we have
seen how explosive is Negro dis
content set in the environment of
a great city. The United States
has done many great, and good
things in this past century. But
our progress has been marred and
marked by two enormous failures.
The one has been the failure to
make free men of the great mass
of the descendants of the eman
cipated slaves. The other has been
the failure to make our cities,
which are destined to be the home
of the great majority of Ameri
cans, civilized and safe.

safe for the masses who have j
been moviiTfr into them will com
pel us to replan, reconstruct and j
reorganize much of the work and j
living of an increasing part of
i the nation. We have to do this, al-1
though the public institutions of
the states, the counties, the munic
ipalities and the federal govern- j
ment itself were formed in the
IHtJi century when the vast ma
jority lived in the country or in
i small towns.
The American political system j
stems from a time when there
was as yet no problem of the
cities.
The remarking of the cities will j
be a much bigger task than is at;
yet generally understood in this j
country. But the task will have to |
be attempted, for a. nation which
lives in cities (the President says
80 per cent will live in cities by
the year must have cities fit
to live in.
I come back to the subject of j
my worrying. It is not about the j
great costs of what has to be done :
—we can find the money. It is not i
about the disturbance of vested !
interests— that can be endured
and absorbed in a nation which
is in the main so well off.
I am thinking of the politicians j
and the civil servants and the vot
ers who must carry out these
vast and intricate measures and
of how they already have too
much to do and where they are
to find a fresh source of energy
within themselves.
It is reassuring to think of
his legislative program. It shpws
that our political system can be
made to work. And yet, looking
at the legislative program —at
Medicare, education, the war
against poverty — what we have
achieved so far is something like
an architect's plan for the founda
tions of a structure and a few
holes in the ground.
The hardest part of the work 011
the Great Society still lies ahead
of us, ahead of the President,
ahead of the Congress, ahead of 1
the press and the voters.
To realize that extraordinary
demands will be made upon us is
not yet wisdom. But it is the be
ginning of wisdom.
Doing nothing in particular for
a month, yet unable not to read
the papers and keep up with what
is going on, I have been doing
some worrying. The subject of my
worry has been the number and
size of the problems that are in
front of us and how we are to
find the time, the attention and
the energy to deal with them.
I am not thinking only of Viet.
Nam, which is for the present
an insoluble predicament, but of
how the demands upon us are
compounded by what the Los An
geles riot has revealed about the
Negro revolution. We are commit
ted to working out on our own re
sponsibility the new relationships
in Asia between the Western pow
ers and the Asians. This will mark
an historical epoch.
More Far-reaching Changes
At the same time, the same
President, with the same Con
gress and the same electorate, is
compelled to inaugurate and set
in motion more far-reaching
changes in our society than were
ever contemplated in the Johnson
consensus.
In the Los Angeles riot we have
seen how explosive is Negro dis
content set in the environment of
a great city. The United States
has done many great, and good
things in this past century. But
our progress has been marred and
marked by two enormous failures.
The one has been the failure to
make free men of the great mass
of the descendants of the eman
cipated slaves. The other has been
the failure to make our cities,
which are destined to be the home
of the great majority of Ameri
cans, civilized and safe.
In the slums of Los Angeles,
and in the slums of other great
cities, there are the Negro poor—
uneducated, untrained men for
modern industry, left behind in
the cultural progress of the na
tion, coming from broken homes
and without Negro leadership.
They have no coherent program
of demands, but they find a spasm
of relief by going on a rampage
of burning, wrecking, killing and
hating.
Cannot lie Done Quickly
Probably, in fact almost cer
tainly, enough is known by some
of us somewhere to reduce the
grievances and remedy the mis
ery. But fatally this enormous
task cannot be done quickly.
It is optimistic to think that the
social and family conditions and
the cultural backwardness which
are producing an unemployed and
desperate remnant can be reform
ed in one generation. Although
there are always individual ex
ceptions, in the mass the young
rioters are very close to being

past saving, and we have to face j
the grim question of how they |
can be induced to remain quiet ■■
while the necessary reforms for
the benefit of other Negroes are
worked out in the slow processes
of political democracy.
We shall not erase easily the
consequences of slavery and of i
the half - freedom which has fol- j
lowed it.
