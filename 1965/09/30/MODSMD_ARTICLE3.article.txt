# Maxwell Taylor's Vietnam Report By Ticket Only
## 
### 
Admission to General Maxwell
D. Taylor's public "Report on
Vietnam" at Foothill College Fri
day evening, Oct. 1. will be by
ticket only, the college Public
Events Board announced today.
There is no charge for the tickets,
which may be requested by mail
or phone from the college Box
Office, phone 948-4444.
College spokesmen noted that
the ticket requirement is an inno
vation for Foothill, which in the
past has taken no reservations
for its free public lecture series.
However, General Taylor, first
speaker in the 1965-66 lecture
series, is expected to attract large
crowds, and Foothill is seeking
an advance gauge on the number.
A possibility exists that the 8:15
p.m. event will be moved from
the presently scheduled College
Theatre, 971-capacity, to the 2500-
seat main gymnasium.
