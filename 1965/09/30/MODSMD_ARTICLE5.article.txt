## 
### 
$525, PLEASE! Master Sergeant Joseph
Silva of the Department of Military Sci
ence exemplifies the spirit of Registra
tion Day while other Stanford students

are more subtly robbed of their small
change inside the Pavilion. He is accual
ly recruiting for the Rifle and Pistol Club,
of which he is a sponsor.
