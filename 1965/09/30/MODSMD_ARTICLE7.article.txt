# KZSU Summer Project
## Rights Workers: Diversity, Concern 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
There was no single stereotype among
the civil rights workers in tho South
this summer, sis Stanford students who
investigated student involvement in the
civil rights movement, emphasized yes
terday.
"There was tremendous diversity of
people in the South. The sterotyped civil
rights worker was there, but you also
had such people as priests," said Penny
Niland one of tho students and station
manager of Stanford radio station
KZSU.
"We did not find any of the so-called
communist, beatnik agitators," added
Jon Rnise, another participant and assoc
iate editor of the Daily.
The six students, members of a KZSU
sponsored communications crew which
recorded over 400 hours of interviews
and covered some 50,000 miles in the
South, compared notes at a Stanford
press conference yesterday.
KZSU Broadcast
DuL the final results of the project

will not be ready until January, after
a series ol' half-hour programs has been
prepared from the recordings. These
programs will be broadcast over KZSU
and will be available for national release.
The researchers visited more lhan 40
civil rights projects, living and working
within the Negro community, which
afforded them an opportunity "to com
bine observation with interviews to
establish a depth of communication,"
according to Miss Niland.
In their ramblings which led them
to Ku Klux Klan cross-burnings as well
as to Negro demonstrations, they at
tempted to determine the motivations
and reactions of the civil rights volun
teers.
Workers Frustrations
Miss Mary Kay Becker, a former news
editor of the Daily, observed that "the
position of I Ik 1 white student volunteer
is to provide skills and serve as a cata
lyst for action. It is almost a slogan to
let the local people decide for them
selves."
This concern for "participatory clenioc

racy —teaching the local people to or
ganize themselves rather than actually
organizing them was responsible for
considerable frustration among the civil
rights workers, who hesitated to propose
what appeared to be the obvious solution
io a particular problem, Miss Becker
explained.
Yet, Roise, felt the workers derived
much from their experience, possiblj
more than they put into it. "Many of
the volunteers felt they were doing
something useful for the first time in
their life," he said.
University Part icipution
With headquarters in Tougaloo, Miss.,
the interviewers worked in four two-man
teams; one with the Freedom Demo
cratic Congress in Mississippi, one with
the Soul hern Christian Leadership Con
ference in Alabama, Geargia and South
Carolina, one with the Congress of
Racial Equality primarily in Louisiana,
and one as a roving support and supply
unit.
One aspect of the journalistic project
indicates an increased University purtici

palion in off-campus student social activ
ity. While the project never received
official University sanction, KZSU. Ibe
campus radio station. was the organizer
and sponsor.
Moreover, t lie University provided a
o-unit sociology course last Spring,
taught by Dr. Paul Wallin, for the in
struction of the project participants in
interviewing techniques and for instruc
tion about the civil rights situation.
And this quarter (he University is of
fcring a 1-unit communications course,
especially for the participants, to enable
them to prepare their programs. An
other course at Stanford this quarter,
a seminar connected with an East Palo
Alto project, will offer credit for social
work in East Palo Alto.
The project in the South was financed
through grants from the Kalthenborn
Foundation and the Stern Family Fund.
Other Stanford sludents involved be
sides Miss Becker, Miss Niland and Jon
Itoise were Mark Dalrymple, program
director of KZSU, James Mcßae, chief
engineer of KZSU, and .Inlie Wells, news
director of KZSU.
