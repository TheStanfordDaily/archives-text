# Major Shake-up In Dean's Office
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
The positions of Dean of Men
and Dean of Women have been
eliminated in an overall reorgan
ization of the Dean of Students
Office.
Robert Gordon, former Dean
of Men, assumes the new post of
Associate Dean of Students for
Counseling and Residential Pro
grams. Dean Gordon works under
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of
Students.
In an interview with The Daily,
Assistant Dean of Students Doug
Davis said that the Dean's Office
had been realigned in terms of
"function rather than sex." In
the past, the problems of men and
women students have been con
sidered separately.
Student Differences
Davis pointed out that "there
are far more variations among
students than there are between
i men and women." In its eounsel-
I ing functions the office will first
; consider a student as a mature
j adult, and then with regard to
I problems that might be partic-
I ular to the student's sex.
Under the old system, male ad
ministrators dealt only with the
housing and counseling problems
of male students, while women's
problems were handled exclus
ively in the Dean of Women's
j Ofifce. In the future the Assist
| ant Deans will handle all prob
; lems in their particular field
; without regard to sex.
Asked whether the reorganiza
tion grew out of the highly pub*
I licized resignation of Lucille
! Allen, former Dean of Women,
and several other members of her
staff, Davis said that discussions
about the changes had been go
ling on for the past year. But he
j added that it: was "certainly
easier to make major changes
j when the old positions became
! vacant."
Gordon's First Change
' This was the first change that
| had been made since Dean Gor
-1 don assumed his position. Davis
j observed that it is normal for
I any administrator to make cer
i tain changes in his staff organiza
i lion, "once he has his feet on the
i ground."
Davis told The Daily that the
| image of the office's counseling
1 functions would be greatly im
proved once it was relieved of

I its appellate function in the stu
dent judicial system.
I He outlined the two types of
counseling done by t he* Dean's Of
fice: 1. "Responsive counseling"
! which takes place when a student
! has a definite problem that en
dangers his standing in the Uni
versity. 2. "Affirmative counsel-
I ing" which takes place in in
stances where the student is un
i derachieving or having adjust
ment problems.
Assistant Deans
The new Assistant Deans are
Dr. Jean Hinds, counseling; Doug
I Davis, counseling; Mrs. Shirley
i Bushnell, women's residences;
| Daniel Nowak, residences and
! special programs; John Hanson,
i fraternity affairs; James Craw
! ford, research and special pro
i jects.
i Jurisdiction over the fratern
jities, financial relations with the
University have been transferred
to the University business man-
I ager. In the past, Davis said,
financial affairs had clouded the
relationship between the Dean's
office and the various fraterni
ties. The new arrangement will
allow the dean of fraternities
more time for dealing with fra
! ternity affairs.

Assistant Deans
The new Assistant Deans are
Dr. Jean Hinds, counseling; Doug
I Davis, counseling; Mrs. Shirley
i Bushnell, women's residences;
| Daniel Nowak, residences and
! special programs; John Hanson,
i fraternity affairs; James Craw
! ford, research and special pro
i jects.
i Jurisdiction over the fratern
jities, financial relations with the
University have been transferred
to the University business man-
I ager. In the past, Davis said,
financial affairs had clouded the
relationship between the Dean's
office and the various fraterni
ties. The new arrangement will
allow the dean of fraternities
more time for dealing with fra
! ternity affairs.
The positions of Dean of Men
and Dean of Women have been
eliminated in an overall reorgan
ization of the Dean of Students
Office.
Robert Gordon, former Dean
of Men, assumes the new post of
Associate Dean of Students for
Counseling and Residential Pro
grams. Dean Gordon works under
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of
Students.
In an interview with The Daily,
Assistant Dean of Students Doug
Davis said that the Dean's Office
had been realigned in terms of
"function rather than sex." In
the past, the problems of men and
women students have been con
sidered separately.
Student Differences
Davis pointed out that "there
are far more variations among
students than there are between
i men and women." In its eounsel-
I ing functions the office will first
; consider a student as a mature
j adult, and then with regard to
I problems that might be partic-
I ular to the student's sex.
Under the old system, male ad
ministrators dealt only with the
housing and counseling problems
of male students, while women's
problems were handled exclus
ively in the Dean of Women's
j Ofifce. In the future the Assist
| ant Deans will handle all prob
; lems in their particular field
; without regard to sex.
Asked whether the reorganiza
tion grew out of the highly pub*
I licized resignation of Lucille
! Allen, former Dean of Women,
and several other members of her
staff, Davis said that discussions
about the changes had been go
ling on for the past year. But he
j added that it: was "certainly
easier to make major changes
j when the old positions became
! vacant."
Gordon's First Change
' This was the first change that
| had been made since Dean Gor
-1 don assumed his position. Davis
j observed that it is normal for
I any administrator to make cer
i tain changes in his staff organiza
i lion, "once he has his feet on the
i ground."
Davis told The Daily that the

1 functions would be greatly im
