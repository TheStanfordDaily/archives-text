HAVE A DATE EVERY
SATURDAY NIGHT
You II finally be able to afford Jo, if
you get a Honda.
Trade in your gas-eater for a thrifty
Honda fifty. Up to 200 miles per gal
lon, and at fÂ£asl that many laughs,
Maybe more.
Hondas are just the ticket for campus
'raffic and campus parking, and you'll
lotice a big difference in your pocket-
Dook; too. It'll bulge for a change,
so will your date book.
