Two days after the start of a new semester last
September, an open letter by "a former student"
called upon students at the University of Califor- I
nia at Berkeley to "organize and split this campus
wide open" in an "open, fierce, and thoroughgoing
rebellion."
What happened at Berkeley during the months
that followed was unprecedented in American
university history. During a series of demonstra
tions, sit-ins, and riots, one of the world's largest
and most famous centers of learning was brought
to the edge of collapse.
In The Berkeley Student Revolt: Facts and Inter
■p relations ($1.95, an Anchor Original published
on September 3), two eminent teachers at Berke
ley, a sociologist and a political scientist, have as
sembled a wide range of significant views from
participants on both sides of the dispute and
outside observers. The editors, Seymour Martin
Lipset and Sheldon S. Wolin, are themselves in
disagreement over the meaning of the revolt. They
do agree, however, that the events at Berkeley
have an importance that transcends their immedi
ate local consequences. The University of Califor
nia has been regarded by many as a prototype of
the future form of public education. Whatever the
merits of the students' case, their attack against
the University raises an important and alarming
question about the ability of a fundamental mod
ern institution to meet the demands of the future.
The Berkeley Student Revolt includes a detailed
chronology that explains what actually took place
during an often confusing series of events. The
volume also collects many of the manifestos,
broadsides, pamphlets, statements, and releases
distributed by both sides, which convey a sense of
what the participants actually thought and felt.
We think it is obvious that the Berkeley students
were representative of a new generation on col
lege campuses — politically aware and involved,
preoccupied with protest, and sensitive to social
abuses. In The Berkeley Student Revolt, that gen
eration — your generation, if you are reading this
column in your college newspaper — has its say.
For anyone who is part of a college campus this
Fall of 1965, it is important and fascinating read-
