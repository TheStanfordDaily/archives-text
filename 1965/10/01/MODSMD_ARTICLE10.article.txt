# Indians Battle Falcon Aerials
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Invading Colorado by air, com
mercially that is, the Stanford In
dians will be scouting for their
second win of the season against
the Air Force tomorrow after suf
fering a humiliating tie with Navy
last week.
After drilling for a week the
Tribe hopes that they will be able
to march over the spirited Cadets
powered by Rany Handley's end
sweeps or John .Read's line-bucks.
The Air Force Academy is a
young school and so is their foot
ball team. Not only did gradua
tion hurt their grid hopes but a
I cribbing scandal also took its toll;
they lost 29 lettermen last year.
Only nine lettermen are return
ing.
Stanford's freshmen football
coach, Dick Vermeil, scouted the
Air Force in their last game with
Nebraska, Sports Illustrated's No.
1 team in the country, and came
back very impressed. Air Force
lost by 10 points, 27-17, but Ne
braska's last touchdown was a
| gift.
Potent Air Attack
Coach Vermeil was extremely
I concerned about the arm of Quar
terback Paul Stein who, naturally,
j gives the Academy a very profi
cient air attack. He threw 47
times against Nebraska. Vermeil
also commented that the Cadets
weren't afraid to gamble which
worried him:
"Being a young team the Fal
cons may lack experience but
aren't afraid to take chances,
tending to be a highly spirited
group who are almost impossible
to stop when they start a drive."
Another factor in Saturday's
game will be that it is being
played at the Academy. This
means that the Indians will have
to become accustomed not only to
the thin air and altitude but also
to the enthusiastic Air Force root-
I ers who, as Coach Vermeil stated,
tend to lose their heads, and hats,
in the excitement of a ftootball
j game.
Cadets' Offense
Offensively, besides Stein who
completed 10 of 22 passes for 133
yards last year, the Falcons are
lead by YVingbaek Bill Manning
who carried the ball only 13 times
last year, Fullback Jeff Jarvis
who is considered the best blocker
on the team, and Ends Larry Cook
and Jim Schultz neither of which
played last year but provide the
targets for the lethal wing of Paul
Stein. But offensively, bench
strength is weak.
On defense the cadets are weak
in the forward line but have com
mendable forces in linebackers
j Clay Magee and Bob Hinson and
_ middle guard and lettermen Don

Heckert. Dick Slarkey, 5-11 and
180, is known as the "Monster
Man" and is just that on defense.
Indians' Option
Of course if Stanford's ground
force is unable to maneuver
through the Cadets' defense they
can always retaliate with the
Dave Lewis-Bob Blunt combina
tion hoping to defeat the Air
Force at their own game, in the
air.
Quarterback Lewis has at
tempted 39 passes and completed
18 for 395 yards and one touch
down. Halfback Blunt has caught
eight aerial bombs for 263 and has
provided a bit of flash in the In
dian line-up.
Even though Stanford has
gained 404 yards in the air com
pared to 342 on the ground, they
are definitely planning to stick
mostly to the ground hoping to
keep the ball away from the gam
bling of Quarterback Stein and
rambling of Halfback Manning.
Practice Pass Defense
Coach Ralston also hopes that
his squad has sharpened up on
their pass defense this week, an
ticipating the same type of at
tack from the Cadets that brought
them from a 21 point deficit in
the first quarter to within four

points in the third period against
Nebraska. The Air Force also lost
to a very strong Wyoming team.
A 1 Wilburn will be replacing
Gary Pettigrew at offensive end

and either Tom Hazelrigg or Bill
Ostrander will go in at defensive
end. Also missing the trip will be
End Roger Clay and Tackle Monty
Mohrman both out with injuries.
