# Status of Educated Woman: Stanford Upholds Equality
## 
### MARY KAY BECKER 
Are women really worth educating?
The assumption at Stanford lias always been that the\ are—ever
since Mrs. Stanford declared at the outset that "1 deem it especially
important that the education ot the female be equal to that of the
male, and I am inclined to think that if the education of either is

neglected, it had bettor be that of
the man than the woman, because
if the mother is well educated,
she insensibly imparts it to the
child."
In 1891 Mrs. Stanford decided
lo go ahead and admit women
along with men to the first class,
rather than waiting a year or two
as previously planned, in order to
give them at once the status of
"perfect equality."
Since then, the 1 actual status of
Stanford women has varied. In
1899, Mrs. Stanford wavered a
little from her original policy and
set the Five Hundred Limit to
keep the school from being re
garded as a women's school. This
year, in the reorganization of the
Dean's Office, the positions of
Dean of Women and Dean of Men
were eliminated to ensure that
all students are treated as stu

dents first.
The Five Hundred Limit was a
i result of an increase of women
students over the first four years.
The original ratio was three to
! one, but this shrunk quickly to
two to one. A speaker at the
Memorial Day exercises in 1895.
, noted this "startling increase"
land speculated that Stanford
within 20 years would become
known as "the Vassal* of the Pa
: cific Coast."
Those who deplored the in
crease felt that the girls' pres
ence distracted the men from
more worthy pursuits, such as
sports.
Now, of course, the total en
-1 rollment of women at Stanford
: is close to 2,500. But problems—
educational, social, and psycho
logical — still exist for women
| attending what was once consid
! ercd a man's university and which
still places them in the minority.
One of the aims of the present
set-up in the Dean's office, in the
eyes of Assistant Dean Mrs.
Shirley Bushnell, is to counteract
whatever feeling there may be
among Stanford women that they
are somehow second-class citi
zens.
"Not having a Dean of Wo
men doesn't mean we don't care
1 about women," she says. "But
hopfully through this new 'lack
of sidedness' we can treat all stu
i dents as students."
To Assistant Dean Jean Hinds,
; who works in the area of coun
seling, this "task-oriented ap
proach" means that both men
and women students can come to
her not necessarily because she is
j a woman but because she is a
! counselor. "We are not disciplin
arians," she emphasizes.

if the mother is well educated,
she insensibly imparts it to the
child."
In 1891 Mrs. Stanford decided
lo go ahead and admit women
along with men to the first class,
rather than waiting a year or two
as previously planned, in order to
give them at once the status of
"perfect equality."
Since then, the 1 actual status of
Stanford women has varied. In
1899, Mrs. Stanford wavered a
little from her original policy and
set the Five Hundred Limit to
keep the school from being re
garded as a women's school. This
year, in the reorganization of the
Dean's Office, the positions of
Dean of Women and Dean of Men
were eliminated to ensure that
all students are treated as stu

dents first.
The Five Hundred Limit was a
i result of an increase of women
students over the first four years.
The original ratio was three to
! one, but this shrunk quickly to
two to one. A speaker at the
Memorial Day exercises in 1895.
, noted this "startling increase"
land speculated that Stanford
within 20 years would become
known as "the Vassal* of the Pa
: cific Coast."
Those who deplored the in
crease felt that the girls' pres
ence distracted the men from
more worthy pursuits, such as
sports.
Now, of course, the total en
-1 rollment of women at Stanford
: is close to 2,500. But problems—
educational, social, and psycho
logical — still exist for women
| attending what was once consid
! ercd a man's university and which
still places them in the minority.
One of the aims of the present
set-up in the Dean's office, in the
eyes of Assistant Dean Mrs.
Shirley Bushnell, is to counteract
whatever feeling there may be
among Stanford women that they
are somehow second-class citi
zens.
"Not having a Dean of Wo
men doesn't mean we don't care
1 about women," she says. "But
hopfully through this new 'lack
of sidedness' we can treat all stu
i dents as students."
To Assistant Dean Jean Hinds,
; who works in the area of coun
seling, this "task-oriented ap
proach" means that both men
and women students can come to
her not necessarily because she is
j a woman but because she is a
! counselor. "We are not disciplin
arians," she emphasizes.
Are women really worth educating?
The assumption at Stanford lias always been that the\ are—ever
since Mrs. Stanford declared at the outset that "1 deem it especially
important that the education ot the female be equal to that of the
male, and I am inclined to think that if the education of either is

neglected, it had bettor be that of
the man than the woman, because
if the mother is well educated,
she insensibly imparts it to the
child."
