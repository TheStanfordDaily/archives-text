# Year of Freedom
## Women's Regs In Retrospect 
### ELLEN COOK Social Regulations Committee Chairman 
April 30, 19(j5. This was the
monumental day — or, perhaps
more accurately, the monumental j
night that the new social regula-1
tions went into effect for Stanford J
women. Amid cries from without
such as "You can't be serious" and
cries from within that "It's about
time!," Stanford coeds moved into
a realm of 6 o'cloeks and over

nights which are still the envy
and amazement of college coeds
across the United States.
How has it gone? Remarkably
well. There are, of course, coeds
who come in late at G o'clock in
the morning. There may be coeds
well on ihe way to collapse and
exhaustion. But, by and large,
Stanford women have shown ma
turity and good judgment in the
exercise of their new-found free
dom.

As a new year begins and a new
crop of undergraduate women he
comes eligible for (i o'clock late
leaves, the questions put to last
year's Social.Regulations Commit
tee are again being brought forth.
At the core of this questioning is
the basic concern: "Why do we
have social regulations at all? ♦
A parent spoke to this point in
a reply to last year's parent ques
tionnaire about the proposals for
new social regulations:
"Students should be made aware
that discipline is an important as
pect of life. Teachers, administra
tors, and parents should not abdi
cate the responsibility to make
clear that society does require cer
tain conformance for good reason,
and we should be willing to back
up our convictions by making sen
sible rules of conduct."
It is a conviction of Stanford
University that th<> University has
a responsibility to create and sus
tain an atmosphere for education
and self-education as people de
velop into mature and responsible
members of a free society.
In the Stanford community
those members whose main con
cern is learning must have the
freedom to consider both per
sonal and group standards, to test
these standards, to recognize mis
takes and learn from them.
Thus, the revised social regula
tions have endeavored to make
possible this freedom within a
framework of regulation.
Defining this framework is, of
course, no easy task. When, last
spring, the social regulations com
mittee prepared to compile the
results of its mammoth question
naire, it realized that tabulating
replies was relatively simple com
pared with the problem of relat
ing the women's desire for change
to each other and to the Univer
sity as a whole. It's easy to cite
figures such as: 27 per cent of the
women on campus go steady with
one boy; 10 per cent have a grade
point of 3.5 or above; and 55 per
rent requested later hours for .jun
iors and (52 per cent a change in
senior hours. How do you recon
cile the request by 35 per cent of
t he women on campus that senior
hours remain the same with a
statement like "The dorms should
be our beds, our meals, our study
place, but not our mothers. I think
a girl should be allowed to go and
come when she pleases, without
being required to obtain permis
sion at any time ..."?
What must be recognized is
that the students' desire for free
dom was of potential—students
wished to have Ihe privilege of
choosing, for themselves, rather
than being limited. If limitation
is necessary, it should be self
imposed rather than exterior re
straint preventing the woman to
make that decision for herself.
Therefore, ihe social regula
tions should be a positive learn
ing mechanism, not a negative
restricting one.
Keeping in mind, however, that
although the students' desire for
freedom has been recognized by
both faculty and students alike,
there is danger of idealism with
out the restraint of practicality,
it is very important that the soc
ial regulations structure be pre
faced with an emphasis on the
responsibility of the individual.
Each Stanford woman must
recognize and accept her personal
responsibility to show good judg
ment in the exercise of these
regulations.
And, since social regs serve a
double function as both a frame
work for freedom and a means
of maintaining order in a large
and close-living community, it is
important that the regulations be
understood clearly. Questions per
taining to social regulations can
usually be answered by the auxi
liary committee member in each
women's residence.
In addition, the official body
for formulating and interpreting
women's social regulations, the
Social Regulations Committee, is
at all times available to individ
ual students.

recognize and accept her personal
responsibility to show good judg
ment in the exercise of these
regulations.
And, since social regs serve a
double function as both a frame
work for freedom and a means
of maintaining order in a large
and close-living community, it is
important that the regulations be
understood clearly. Questions per
taining to social regulations can
usually be answered by the auxi
liary committee member in each
women's residence.
In addition, the official body
for formulating and interpreting
women's social regulations, the
Social Regulations Committee, is
at all times available to individ
ual students.
April 30, 19(j5. This was the
monumental day — or, perhaps
more accurately, the monumental j
night that the new social regula-1
tions went into effect for Stanford J
women. Amid cries from without
such as "You can't be serious" and
cries from within that "It's about
time!," Stanford coeds moved into
a realm of 6 o'cloeks and over

nights which are still the envy
and amazement of college coeds
across the United States.
How has it gone? Remarkably
well. There are, of course, coeds
who come in late at G o'clock in
the morning. There may be coeds
well on ihe way to collapse and
exhaustion. But, by and large,
Stanford women have shown ma
turity and good judgment in the
exercise of their new-found free
dom.

As a new year begins and a new
crop of undergraduate women he
comes eligible for (i o'clock late
leaves, the questions put to last
year's Social.Regulations Commit
tee are again being brought forth.
At the core of this questioning is
the basic concern: "Why do we
have social regulations at all? ♦
A parent spoke to this point in
a reply to last year's parent ques
tionnaire about the proposals for
new social regulations:
"Students should be made aware
that discipline is an important as
pect of life. Teachers, administra
tors, and parents should not abdi
cate the responsibility to make
clear that society does require cer
tain conformance for good reason,
and we should be willing to back
up our convictions by making sen
sible rules of conduct."
It is a conviction of Stanford
University that th<> University has
a responsibility to create and sus
tain an atmosphere for education
and self-education as people de
velop into mature and responsible
members of a free society.
In the Stanford community
those members whose main con
cern is learning must have the
freedom to consider both per
sonal and group standards, to test
these standards, to recognize mis
takes and learn from them.
Thus, the revised social regula
tions have endeavored to make
possible this freedom within a
framework of regulation.
Defining this framework is, of
course, no easy task. When, last
spring, the social regulations com
mittee prepared to compile the
results of its mammoth question
naire, it realized that tabulating
replies was relatively simple com
pared with the problem of relat
ing the women's desire for change
to each other and to the Univer
sity as a whole. It's easy to cite
figures such as: 27 per cent of the
women on campus go steady with
one boy; 10 per cent have a grade
point of 3.5 or above; and 55 per
rent requested later hours for .jun
iors and (52 per cent a change in
senior hours. How do you recon
cile the request by 35 per cent of
t he women on campus that senior
hours remain the same with a
statement like "The dorms should
be our beds, our meals, our study
place, but not our mothers. I think
a girl should be allowed to go and
come when she pleases, without
being required to obtain permis
sion at any time ..."?
What must be recognized is
that the students' desire for free
dom was of potential—students
wished to have Ihe privilege of
choosing, for themselves, rather
than being limited. If limitation
is necessary, it should be self
imposed rather than exterior re
straint preventing the woman to
make that decision for herself.
Therefore, ihe social regula
tions should be a positive learn
ing mechanism, not a negative
restricting one.
Keeping in mind, however, that
although the students' desire for
freedom has been recognized by
both faculty and students alike,
there is danger of idealism with
out the restraint of practicality,
it is very important that the soc
ial regulations structure be pre
faced with an emphasis on the
responsibility of the individual.

is necessary, it should be self
imposed rather than exterior re
straint preventing the woman to
make that decision for herself.
Therefore, ihe social regula
tions should be a positive learn
ing mechanism, not a negative
restricting one.
Keeping in mind, however, that
although the students' desire for
freedom has been recognized by
both faculty and students alike,
there is danger of idealism with
out the restraint of practicality,
it is very important that the soc
ial regulations structure be pre
faced with an emphasis on the
responsibility of the individual.
Each Stanford woman must
recognize and accept her personal
responsibility to show good judg
ment in the exercise of these
regulations.
And, since social regs serve a
double function as both a frame
work for freedom and a means
of maintaining order in a large
and close-living community, it is
important that the regulations be
understood clearly. Questions per
taining to social regulations can
usually be answered by the auxi
liary committee member in each
women's residence.
In addition, the official body
for formulating and interpreting
women's social regulations, the
Social Regulations Committee, is

ual students.
April 30, 19(j5. This was the
monumental day — or, perhaps
more accurately, the monumental j
night that the new social regula-1
tions went into effect for Stanford J
women. Amid cries from without
such as "You can't be serious" and
cries from within that "It's about
time!," Stanford coeds moved into
a realm of 6 o'cloeks and over

nights which are still the envy
and amazement of college coeds
across the United States.
How has it gone? Remarkably
well. There are, of course, coeds
who come in late at G o'clock in
the morning. There may be coeds
well on ihe way to collapse and
exhaustion. But, by and large,
Stanford women have shown ma
turity and good judgment in the
exercise of their new-found free
dom.

As a new year begins and a new
crop of undergraduate women he
comes eligible for (i o'clock late
leaves, the questions put to last
year's Social.Regulations Commit
tee are again being brought forth.
At the core of this questioning is
the basic concern: "Why do we
have social regulations at all? ♦
A parent spoke to this point in
a reply to last year's parent ques
tionnaire about the proposals for
new social regulations:
"Students should be made aware
that discipline is an important as
pect of life. Teachers, administra
tors, and parents should not abdi
cate the responsibility to make
clear that society does require cer
tain conformance for good reason,
and we should be willing to back
up our convictions by making sen
sible rules of conduct."
It is a conviction of Stanford
University that th<> University has
a responsibility to create and sus
tain an atmosphere for education
and self-education as people de
velop into mature and responsible
members of a free society.
In the Stanford community
those members whose main con
cern is learning must have the
freedom to consider both per
sonal and group standards, to test
these standards, to recognize mis
takes and learn from them.
Thus, the revised social regula
tions have endeavored to make
possible this freedom within a
framework of regulation.
Defining this framework is, of
course, no easy task. When, last
spring, the social regulations com
mittee prepared to compile the
results of its mammoth question
naire, it realized that tabulating
replies was relatively simple com
pared with the problem of relat
ing the women's desire for change
to each other and to the Univer
sity as a whole. It's easy to cite
figures such as: 27 per cent of the
women on campus go steady with
one boy; 10 per cent have a grade
point of 3.5 or above; and 55 per
rent requested later hours for .jun
iors and (52 per cent a change in
senior hours. How do you recon
cile the request by 35 per cent of
t he women on campus that senior
hours remain the same with a
statement like "The dorms should
be our beds, our meals, our study
place, but not our mothers. I think
a girl should be allowed to go and
come when she pleases, without
being required to obtain permis
sion at any time ..."?
What must be recognized is
that the students' desire for free
dom was of potential—students
wished to have Ihe privilege of
choosing, for themselves, rather
than being limited. If limitation
is necessary, it should be self
imposed rather than exterior re
straint preventing the woman to
make that decision for herself.
Therefore, ihe social regula
tions should be a positive learn
ing mechanism, not a negative
restricting one.

although the students' desire for
freedom has been recognized by
both faculty and students alike,
there is danger of idealism with
out the restraint of practicality,
