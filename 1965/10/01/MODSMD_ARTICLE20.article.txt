# Women Are Human?
## 
### 
The Editorial Committee oi The Daily would like to con
gratulate the two members of our distaff side for their courage
in undertaking a regular page-long effort dedicated to llie
"unswerving proposition that women are people."
Now we would not want to dispute this claim, but if one
inserts the adjective "Stanford" before "women" the burden
of proof seems to lie a bit heavier on our staffers' shoulders.
Undoubtedly, we will be told that Stanford women are beauti
ful, scholarly and sometimes activistic ("atavistic" would seem
a more common characteristic). Indeed, we can perceive an in
sidious conspiracy here intended to convince us that the im
mortal "dump on them by the dozen" dolly is really a myth â€”
or a minority.
Such is the enormity of this suggestion that even WE may
be induced to read this page once in a while. Yet we think
it may take more than one page every fortnight or so to dis
suade us from accepting Napoleon Bonaparte's contention that
"there is no accounting for the actions of a. woman."
