19(15 marks 11 it» voar that the Stanford coed was raised to the level
of "human being. With the abolishment of separate deans for men
and women, the coeds are now, ostensibly, to be treated just like
everyone else.
What does this mean?

I Being something of a fearless
crusader, the Daily would like to
: fill in a bit on a philosophy of
Stanford women that has nothing
i at ail to do with significance. Or
I psvchoanalvsis. Or facts.
Just experience.
It's been our experience that
! the Stanford coed isn't a bit in
terested in being equal. Ranging
I from the fragily feminine to the
1 hard-nosed competitors, Stanford
| women don't want to be treated
just like everyone else. They're
| better or worse or maybe just
i sneakier. But not equal.
! The fragily feminine learned
i way back in kindergarten that
i equals don't get their books car
ried or their pigtails stuck in ink
; wells. They may get thrown foot
balls, but they don't get taken
out. It's something they've never
forgotten. And no matter how
often you've heard the moan
| about "nine out of ten colleg
coeds are beautiful and the tenth
j oik 1 goes to Stanford," there are
still fragily feminines among us.
The hard-nosed competitors, on

the other hand, never had time
to calch a football. They were
always too busy booking for A's
and running their high school stu
dent councils. They can even
j brush their teeth better than any
j one else.
They're terribly impresive. You
' meet a lot of them at Stanford.
Somewhere in between, of
1 course, are other types. Some you
mighi even call "natural." They
, book discreetly and smile a lot.
| You never know whether to curse
! Ihem 'cause they ruin the curve
or bless them 'cause they flunk
| and you pass.
And Stanford women like it
that way.
Do they want equality? They
don't know. If pressed, they're
forced to admit that they never
felt oppressed when women were
women and men were men. And
there you have it. Equality, it ap
pears, is up for grabs.
