A new approach to faculty-stu- 1

gated this fall under the* joint
sponsorship of Associated Women
Students and faculty-staff wives.
A series of dinner-discussions will
bring together over 500 women
students and 50 faculty staff
wives for a re-examining of wom
en's roles and relationships. En
titled "A Time for Discussion,
Dinner and Dialogue," the pro- i
gram will he keyed off hy a sym-1
posium program on October 17 at
5 p.m. in Dinklespiel Auditorium.
Woman's residence house presi
dents and freshmen women spon- i
sors are now meeting with the
AWS cabinet and faculty-staff ,
wives to complete preparations
for the symposium.
The complete program will he
discussed at house meetings, and
women students who indicate an !
interest in participating in the i
program will be contacted person
ally by faculty wives. Plans call
for groups of ten students to at
tend the symposium with their
faculty-staff hostess and then
meet at her home for several din
ner-discussion sessions.
According to AWS President
Chick Sullivan, both faculty staff
wives and students have indicated
a real interest in the program. :
"We've been amazed at the re
sponse our plans have received, i
We feel that one of the greatest ;
advantages is that the students
will be meeting with these wom
en over a period of several weeks j
and really getting to know them
as individuals.
"It's an entirely new type of
program, one for which both stu
dents and other members of the
university community seem to feel
a need."
According to Miss Sullivan, j
plans have already hegun for a
second symposium next spring.
