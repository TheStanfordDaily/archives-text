Films
THE PRIZE, starring Paul Newman and Elke Summers, is at
the Flicks Sunday. It didn't win any awards when it was first ro-
Vasod, but it'll he worth more than a few gross comments.
FREAKS, advertised as a "controversial and 'sui generis' experi
mental film." is Saturday's Tresidder film. Forewarned is forearmed:
don't go unless you like way-out tilings.
GOLDFINGER and DR. KTRANGELOVE, starring James Bond
Connery and Peter Sellers, respectively, are wild and woolly entoi*-
tainment. James gets to bed the golden girl; Peter gets to play five
or six different people. Both are highly recommended.
THE COLLECTOR, about a young psycho butterfly-collector who
goes after bigger things in the form of a girl, is at the Guild. Things
get pretty scary near the end. With it is THE SERVANT, which is
about what happens when a timid householder hires an aggressive
servant. Both films won awards at the Cannes Film Festival.
DARLING is at the Fine Arts (see review on this page). With
it is a lot of woman in the form of Elko Sommers; she is featured in
Win' BOTHER TO KNOCK, a preposterous tale about everybody
v, r etting in everybody else's bod.
The Bijou is featuring CAT BALLOU, which is reportedly very
funny, and which the Daily will report on next week, hopefully. The
co-feature is UNDER THE YUM-YUM TREE, an older flick that
stars Jack Lemmon. It must bo durable; it's been around here off and
on for ages.
THE YELLOW ROLLS ROYCE is a three-segment film about
the people who consecutively own, you guessed it, a yellow Rolls
lioyee. It stars, among others, Rex Harrison, Ingrid Bergman, and
Shirley Maclaine. The segment with Rex in it is quite good; the
•others are not so good. But, if you like yellow Rolls Royces . . . With
it is THE PRIZE, which is also playing at the Flicks on Sunday, and
cheaper, too.
The Varsity has THE IPCRESS FILE, starring Michael Caine
as a reluctant British spy with more of a sense of humor than Sean
Connery. He is also less bed-crazy, but just as competent when it
comes to derring do. With "Jpcross" is yet another Doris Day special,
this one entitled THE THRIi.L OF IT ALL. Unless you are ;i par
ticular fan of The Day Flick, it w ill bo a total waste.
And last but not least. ZORBA THE GREEK is at the Stanford.
Every reviewer in the country loved it except yours truly; and when
the review was printed, some irate reader suggested that a certain
member of the Daily staff could well be done without. On account
•>f merit and seniority and all that, fortunately, the suggestion was
safely filed away in the nearest wastebasket. But back to the movie.
It. stars the dancing Anthony Quinn. Alan Bates, Lila Kedrova, and
Irene Papas do a better acting job than Quhin. and manage to look
less indecent besides. With "Zorba" is Gregory Peck in MIRAGE.

HERBERT NANNEY, University Organist and Professor ol'
Music, will give an organ recital on Sunday at 3:30 in Memorial
Church.
