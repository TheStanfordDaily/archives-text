# 'Darling'—A Study Of the Ideal Woman
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
j To say that "Darling" is a "tor-!
! rifie" or a "marvelous" movio
! would bo pretty much of an over
statement, not to mention pretty I
! much of a meaningless statement.
| too. Actually, it is sort of mildly |
; intriguing, and, without ever being j
| "gripping" (whatever that moans) j
j in any way, shape, or form, is a
j continuously entertaining evening.
The darling in question is Diana '
I Scott (Julie Christie), who is re
living her career for an "ideal i
| Woman" article. Throughout the j
movie there is an ironic disparity
between what she as narrator tolls |
the reporter and what the viewer j
j sees act ually happened.
For, in reality, all her life has j
| been what is known in the trade as '
i an existential crisis that is, in the •
: midst of glitter and glamor, an on-1
i counter with nothingness. And the |
whole point of the movio is this;
J difference between the masks men ;
wear (the "Ideal Woman") and
(their real faces underneath (lono
i liness, hypocrisy, depravity).
The Story
Briefly, the story is this: Blessed
with great beauty and utter amor
ality, Julie as Diana Scott drifts
from her Cockney childhood into
fashionable society without ever
really working very hard at it.
On her way up, she restlessly
searches for completeness and so- j
: curity, finding them temporarily j
| at least in the bods of several of
; her male acquaintances. The first
of these is Dirk Bogarde, a BBC 1
Edward R. Murrow type, who of
| fers her love and learning. The sec- !

ond is Laurence Harvey, a coldly :
sensual advertising executive, who
offers her exotic sex and tinselly
status.
The last is an Italian prince, who j
offers a princess-ship and wealth j
beyond measure. She accepts; but. j
having botched up her own life and
several others in the process, Prin
cess Julie is still lonely, incomplete, ;
and confused and, ironically ;
enough, the Ideal Woman.
The Direction
John Schlesinger's direction is
deft but a little sluggish. He lets!
the camera speak for itself about j
the hypocrisy of the rich, the de- j
pravity of the bored, and thej
pathos of the poor, often to great !
advantage; but he allows the pace j
of the story to drag in more than
one spot, especially during the vis
ually unexciting segments. The
splendid ones, like the Italian pal
ace, and the savage ones, like the
Parisian transvestite game-orgy,
come off quite well.
Dirk Bogardeand Laurence Har-'
vey are appropriately loving and j
cruel, respectively; but Julie!
Christie's acting is almost flaw- j
less. Both in speech and manner- j
ism, she masterfully underplays;
her rise from Cockney to princess; j
yet she can leap from lady to |
whore at tlie drop of an insult and |
lash out with all the raucous fury '
of a belligerent bawd.
Her role is a long and difficult •
one—long because she must ap
pear in nearly every scene, and 1
difficult because she must change
mood as often and as completely
as a kaleidoscope changes colors.
She does it superbly.

really working very hard at it.
On her way up, she restlessly
searches for completeness and so- j
: curity, finding them temporarily j
| at least in the bods of several of
; her male acquaintances. The first
of these is Dirk Bogarde, a BBC 1
Edward R. Murrow type, who of
| fers her love and learning. The sec- !

ond is Laurence Harvey, a coldly :
sensual advertising executive, who
offers her exotic sex and tinselly
status.
The last is an Italian prince, who j
offers a princess-ship and wealth j
beyond measure. She accepts; but. j
having botched up her own life and
several others in the process, Prin
cess Julie is still lonely, incomplete, ;
and confused and, ironically ;
enough, the Ideal Woman.
The Direction
John Schlesinger's direction is
deft but a little sluggish. He lets!
the camera speak for itself about j
the hypocrisy of the rich, the de- j
pravity of the bored, and thej
pathos of the poor, often to great !
advantage; but he allows the pace j
of the story to drag in more than
one spot, especially during the vis
ually unexciting segments. The
splendid ones, like the Italian pal
ace, and the savage ones, like the
Parisian transvestite game-orgy,
come off quite well.
Dirk Bogardeand Laurence Har-'
vey are appropriately loving and j
cruel, respectively; but Julie!
Christie's acting is almost flaw- j
less. Both in speech and manner- j
ism, she masterfully underplays;
her rise from Cockney to princess; j
yet she can leap from lady to |
whore at tlie drop of an insult and |
lash out with all the raucous fury '
of a belligerent bawd.
Her role is a long and difficult •
one—long because she must ap
pear in nearly every scene, and 1
difficult because she must change
mood as often and as completely
as a kaleidoscope changes colors.
She does it superbly.
j To say that "Darling" is a "tor-!
! rifie" or a "marvelous" movio

statement, not to mention pretty I
! much of a meaningless statement.
| too. Actually, it is sort of mildly |
; intriguing, and, without ever being j

j in any way, shape, or form, is a
j continuously entertaining evening.
The darling in question is Diana '
I Scott (Julie Christie), who is re
living her career for an "ideal i

movie there is an ironic disparity
between what she as narrator tolls |
the reporter and what the viewer j
j sees act ually happened.
For, in reality, all her life has j

i an existential crisis that is, in the •

The Story
Briefly, the story is this: Blessed
with great beauty and utter amor
ality, Julie as Diana Scott drifts
from her Cockney childhood into
fashionable society without ever
really working very hard at it.
On her way up, she restlessly
searches for completeness and so- j
: curity, finding them temporarily j
| at least in the bods of several of
; her male acquaintances. The first
of these is Dirk Bogarde, a BBC 1
