# 'Satchmo' & Band Coming to Frost
## 
### AL HEINEMAN 
Stanford Jazz Year '65-'66.
: which has begun quietly with ex
hibits continuing through No
vember 1 at Tresidder Union,
roars into full "swing" Sunday at
2 n.m. at Frost Amphitheater 1
with the appearance of Louis
Armstrong and his All-Stars.
The Armstrong concert will
< T ive the Stanford community
1 in addition to Louis' always-ex
citing performance tin opportun
ity to hear perhaps the most in
fluential innovator in the history
of one of America's only two na
-1 tivo art forms (cinema being the
I other).
"Satchmo" has had a career
' spanning from 1917 to the pres
! ent, and, as with General de
Gaulle, there are rumors he'll go
ion forever. He began in the tra- j
j dition of turn-of-the-century New
; Orleans music and has evolved |
; and progressed continually, in the I
j process influencing practically
every noteworthy jazz trumpeter!
; and many other jazz instrumen-:
talists. He has travelled all over
! the world, including extended
i tours behind the Iron Curtain, 1
| spreading jazz and good will lib- '
j erally.
Satcluno's a Gas
It is appropriate in a number
of ways that Louis Armstrong
more or less begins the Stanford j
Jazz Year: first, of course, be
cause he's a gas, and the object
of the program is entertainment. .
If we can sneak in a little educa- !
tion, though, so much the better, :
1 and for those who say, "I don't
understand jazz," Louis makes a
logical jumping-off point. Even
if his music didn't communicate,
his vocal pyrotechnics (one hesi-
I tates to call it singing) and com
. edy are readily absorbed by all i
i audiences.
But the music does eommuni- j
i cate; the blues are in it, and j
; church music, and basic African j
rhythms common in rock and roll ;
the elements are familiar. And
whether joyful or pensive, Louis'
, jazz is open and honest, and there
is nothing of the esoteric or spec
ialized in it. It is a foot-stomping,
I hand-clapping, sing-along sound '
|in the best (as opposed to the j
Mitch Miller) sense.
Tlu* Group
Appearing with Louis will be'
jTyree Glenn, trombonist-vibist,
i Buster Bailey, clarinetist. Billy j
I Kyle, pianist, George Catlett, j
I bassist, Danny Barcelona, drum-!
I mer, and Jewel Brown, voealist.
All are fine musicians, and Glenn
i and Baiiey especially are known
i as pioneer jazzmen.
If you've ever heard the King
Oliver Blues Band's early record
ings. or seen movies like "Cabin
in the Sky," "Paris Blues" or i
I "The Five Pennies," or tuned in j
"Hello, Dolly" on the radio, or :
been alive recently, Satchmo
needs no introduction. If you've
missed all those opportunities, j
and feel like a couple of hours
absorbing sunshine find genuinely
happy music, tickets are avail
able.

LOUIS ARMSTRONG
Stanford Jazz Year '65-'66.
: which has begun quietly with ex
hibits continuing through No
vember 1 at Tresidder Union,
roars into full "swing" Sunday at
2 n.m. at Frost Amphitheater 1
with the appearance of Louis
Armstrong and his All-Stars.
The Armstrong concert will
< T ive the Stanford community
1 in addition to Louis' always-ex
citing performance tin opportun
ity to hear perhaps the most in
fluential innovator in the history
of one of America's only two na
-1 tivo art forms (cinema being the
I other).
"Satchmo" has had a career
' spanning from 1917 to the pres
! ent, and, as with General de
Gaulle, there are rumors he'll go
ion forever. He began in the tra- j
j dition of turn-of-the-century New
; Orleans music and has evolved |
; and progressed continually, in the I
j process influencing practically
every noteworthy jazz trumpeter!
; and many other jazz instrumen-:
talists. He has travelled all over
! the world, including extended
i tours behind the Iron Curtain, 1
| spreading jazz and good will lib- '
j erally.
Satcluno's a Gas
It is appropriate in a number
of ways that Louis Armstrong
more or less begins the Stanford j
Jazz Year: first, of course, be
cause he's a gas, and the object
of the program is entertainment. .
If we can sneak in a little educa- !
tion, though, so much the better, :
1 and for those who say, "I don't
understand jazz," Louis makes a
logical jumping-off point. Even
if his music didn't communicate,
his vocal pyrotechnics (one hesi-
I tates to call it singing) and com
. edy are readily absorbed by all i
i audiences.
But the music does eommuni- j
i cate; the blues are in it, and j
; church music, and basic African j
rhythms common in rock and roll ;
the elements are familiar. And
whether joyful or pensive, Louis'
, jazz is open and honest, and there
is nothing of the esoteric or spec
ialized in it. It is a foot-stomping,
I hand-clapping, sing-along sound '
|in the best (as opposed to the j
Mitch Miller) sense.
Tlu* Group
Appearing with Louis will be'
jTyree Glenn, trombonist-vibist,
i Buster Bailey, clarinetist. Billy j
I Kyle, pianist, George Catlett, j
I bassist, Danny Barcelona, drum-!
I mer, and Jewel Brown, voealist.
All are fine musicians, and Glenn
i and Baiiey especially are known
i as pioneer jazzmen.
If you've ever heard the King
