# Faculty Club Dilemma Concerns Liquor Regs
## 
### 
It seems ironic and somewhat unfair, yet the
formal dedication of the Facultx Club today not
only marks the opening of a welcome addition to
the campus community but also serves to under
score once again the absurdity of the present
liquor regulations.
Consider:
The Trustees did grant [acuity and adminis
trators a special dispensation regarding the stor
age and consumption ot alcohol at the Faculty
CM>, and they even allowed them the freedom to
serve their guests "in accordance with state law."
However, "guests" does not mean students —
undergraduates or graduate. (Indeed, we wonder
whether that includes those members of the Ad
ministration presently taking a few units in order
to secure an advanced degree.) And what would
happen if the "guest" turned out to be a graduate
student—or any student over 21 years old—from
another university, we could not say. Finally, we
gather that alumni of any age can be served; thus.

a 21-year old alumnus can imbibe, but a 26-year 1
old graduate student cannot.
The complexity of all this is enough to drive
anyone to drink.
Yet the present situation lias more aspects than I
the humorous one. If a faculty member persists in
taking a student as a guest, he will have chosen
less crowded surroundings and more and better
food than Tresidder provides; however, he wit]
have to pick up the tab on his membership card.;
The net result would thus seem to be a social
and financial barrier which effectively keeps the j
Faculty Club closed to students—but not admin
istrators (not to be paranoid about this, but we!
wonder what the reaction would be if Tresidder
was declared off limits to all but students and j
TA's). !
On the whole, though, we think the Faculty
Club is a fine thing and that tho increased intra
faeultv and faculty-administration contact result-[
ing from the presence of this Club will be benefi-1
eial to the community.
