# Professor Page Comments On Judicial Negotiations

(Ed. Note: The following letter is from Benja
min Page, chairman of the Executive Com
mittee of the Academic Council and a member
of the ad hoc committee which worked out the
compromise version of the Judicial Competence
Bill published oil this page).
In the past academic year, the ASSU's
"Judicial Competence Bill" brought a mixed
response. Most provisions of the bill received
general support, but some controversial pass
ages were of concern to the entire University
community. Subsequently, many discussions
took place between representatives of the ASSU
and administration in an effort to find mutually
acceptable modifications. It now appears that
the effort has succeeded. Those who took part
in the discussions have reached unanimous
agreement on recommendations to be made to
their respective constituencies. If these recom
mendations are put into effect, and if the pro

posed "Committee of Fifteen" is established to
consider future issues, I believe that all parties
will gain therefrom. This is an opportune time
lo commend the students who participated in
the meetings for their willingness to discuss
the issues, and for their goodwill, skill, and
honesty in presenting their arguments. It is
also apropriate to thank the representatives of
the faculty and administration who devoted
much time and thought to the discussions.
All parties have made concessions in order to
meet the wishes of the others. In the long run,
all participants have placed the best interests
of the entire University above partisan inclina
tions. I earnestly hope that this guideline will
always prevail at Stanford. I also hope, and be
lieve, that the recent discussions may have
strengthened the rapport, respect, and mutual
trust that should exist between students, fac
ulty, and administration at this University.
