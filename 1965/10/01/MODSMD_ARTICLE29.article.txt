RESOLUTION FOR APPROVAL BY CONSTITUENCIES
OF STANFORD UNIVERSITY
1. The Associated Students, acting through the ASSU judicial sys
tem, shall have exclusive original judicial jurisdiction, except as modi
fied by paragraphs 2 and 3, over all cases in which charges are pre
ferred in the University community regarding student conduct and
affairs.
2. Each student, if he feels the nature «112 tlie offense with which he
has been charged warrants, may ask the Dean of Students to decide
the case, provided lhat the Dean may decline to hear Honor Code
cases or cases in which he deems himself to be disqualified. When
the ease is decided by tile Dean of Students, the student may appeal
the decision to such student-faculty Appeals Board as may be estab
lished by agreement between the ASSU and the President of the Uni
versity. Until such student faculty Appeals Board is established, the
student may appeal the decision to an appellate l>oard of three per
sons appointed by the President of the University from a panel of not
more than six nominated by the Executive Committee of the Aca
demic Council. The functions of such appellate board, the rights of
the parties to the proceedings, and the procedure to be followed by
such board shall be a proper subject of discussion by the Committee
of Fifteen. The University must inform the student of his initial
right, to be tried by the ASSU judicial council with original jurisdic
tion and must not attempt to induce the student to forego such right.
Furthermore, the University must inform the student of his right to
appeal the decision of the Dean.
3. The ASSU judicial councils shall enforce all applicable Univer
sity law and policy, provided, however, that in cases in which Uni
versity law or policy conflicts with the ASSU Constitution or Bylaws,
the latter shall be controlling in ASSU judicial proceedings. In every
ease in which an ASSU judicial council decides that it cannot enforce
a University law or policy because of a conflict with the ASSU Con
stitution or Bylaws, the case shall be referred to such separate tri
bunal (other than any Appeals Board that may be established) as the
University may set up to hear these cases. The jurisdiction of these
separate tribunals shall be limited to such cases. Such Separate tri-
Initials shall accord students these rights:
a. All rights guaranteed them by the ASSU Constitution and By
laws as of September I, 1965.
b. All additional rights provided l\v amendment to the ASSU
Constitution and Bylaws after September 1, 1965, except such rights
as are explicitly disapproved for such separate tribunals by the Presi
dent of the University in the form of notification to the President of
the ASSU.
4. a. A student should be disciplined only for conduct which lie did
believe or had reason to believe was a violation of Ihe Fundamental
Standard at the time i! occurred.
b. If a case arise* which does not fall within any of the categories
specified in (e) below, the defendant must l>e found not guilty unless
it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that:
( H Pie engaged in the conduct charged; and
(2) His conduct was not justifiable or excusable under the cir
cumstances; and
(3> Ho knew that his conduct violated the Fundamental Stan
dard; or
(4) As a reasonable person he should have known that his con
duct violated the Fundamental Standard.
C. The defense set forth in (b) above may not be asserted when
the conduct charged would constitute a violation of a standard of con
duct established by:
Hi ASSU Constitution or Bylaws.
(21 Specific written, publicized regulations and policies adopted
by the University.
t3) Such decisions of ASSU judicial councils as shall be deemed
appropriate precedent by the ASSU.
5. All University constituencies are entitled lo express their views
prior to the formulation of University policies respecting matters in
which they have a legitimate interest. In order to provide a means of
effectuating this principle, while maintaining freedom of decision and
action by all constituencies, the following procedure should be put
into effect:
a. A mechanism should be established through which duly ap
pointed representatives of the President of the University, the Aca
demic Council, and the Legislature meet to discuss University prob
lems and policies with a view to exchanging ideas and, if possible,
agreeing in principle upon recommendations to be made to their sev
eral appointing powers. The group meeting for this purpose, which
may include up to five representatives of each appointing power,
should not have power to make decisions or to bind their several ap
pointing powers to make decisions. Only the appointing powers have
the right to propose subjects for the agenda of the group.
b. Following such discussions, the several groups of representa
tives should report to their respective appointing powers (1 > the mat
ters discussed. (2) the views of the various groups of representatives
thereon, and the recommendations of the reporting representa
tives concerning the action, if any, which ought to be taken by their
appointing powers.
c. Following such report and recommendation, each appointing
power may make a recommendation on the subject to the Board of
Trustees through the President of the University, or take any other
action which it is empowered to take that it regards as appropriate
under the circumstances.
No University constituency is obligated to utilize this procedure
prior to taking action respecting any matter, but every constituency
adopting or approving this resolution thereby affirms its present in
tention to utilize the procedure prior to taking action in every in
stance in which, in its judgment, the matter is one in which the other
constituencies have a legitimate interest and one as to which it is
practicable to proceed in such manner.
