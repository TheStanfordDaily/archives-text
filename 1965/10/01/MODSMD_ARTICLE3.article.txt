# Negotiators In Agreement On Judicial Modifications
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
Representatives of the student
body, faculty, and administration
gaw their approval yesterday to
a resolution clarifying certain
changes within the student judi
cial system.
They also approved a proposed
LASSU bill incorporating the
changes into the section of the
ASSU By-Laws dealing with the
Fundamental Standard.
The resolution is a modification
of one approved by a similar com
mittee last April.
It still must be approved by
President Wallace Sterling, and
the Legislature before it can go
into effect.

The Executive Committee
of the Academic Council,
Stanford's top faculty group,
last night unanimously ap
proved the .judicial reform
resolution. Prof. Benjamin 31.
Page, chairman of the. Com
mittee announced yesterday
evening.

If approved, the effect of the
resolution would differ from that
of the April resolution in that:
In the event of conflict be
tween University policy and the
ASSU Constitution and By Laws,
the latter would be "controlling
in ASSU judicial proceedings,"
rather than the more inclusive
"standard of conduct."
A student charged with con
duct contrary to the Fundamen
tal Standard would not be al
lowed to plead ignorance of the
law if the standard of conduct he
was breaking was established in
either (1> the ASSU Constitution
or By Laws, or (2) specific writ
ten. publicized regulations and
policies adopted by the Univer
sity, or (3 > a book of judicial prec
edents, tentatively scheduled for
publication by the ASSU.
The competence, or jurisdic
tion, of student judicial courts
would be extended from ASSU
law to all University policy not
in conflict with the ASSU Consti
tution and By Laws.
— The ASSU judicial council
would be prevented from passing
judgment upon an individual who
violates University policy that is
in conflict with ASSU law.
The President of the Univer
sity is given the power to veto
any "right" that LASSU might
give in the future to students ap
pearing before a tribunal set up
by the University to try a stu
dent violating a University law
that is in conflict with ASSU law.
If a student chooses to have
his case handled by the Dean of
Students, any appeal resulting
from the case must be directed
to a student-faculty Appeals
Board, should one be created, or
to an interim appellate board eho

sen by the faculty and the Presi
dent. Under the April resolution,
appeals would have been directed
to the student judicial body
"which would have had jurisdic
tion to review a decision of the
judicial council which would have

tried the case had it not been han
dled by the dean."
Controversy over the student
judiciary reached a climax last
February 4, when LASSU de
clared that the ASSU should have
"sole jurisdiction over student af

fairs and conduct." This state
ment of philosophy was ineorpor
ated three weeks later into a By
Laws change calling for LASSI
approval of all University policy
that was to be enforced by stu
dent judicial councils.

The current negotiations were
begun soon after the administra
tion's Committee on University
Policy (COUP) and the faculty's
Executive Committee developed
objections to the original resolu
tion.

clared that the ASSU should have
"sole jurisdiction over student af

fairs and conduct." This state
ment of philosophy was ineorpor
ated three weeks later into a By
Laws change calling for LASSI
approval of all University policy
that was to be enforced by stu
dent judicial councils.

The current negotiations were
begun soon after the administra
tion's Committee on University
Policy (COUP) and the faculty's
Executive Committee developed
objections to the original resolu
tion.
Representatives of the student
body, faculty, and administration
gaw their approval yesterday to
a resolution clarifying certain
changes within the student judi
cial system.
They also approved a proposed
LASSU bill incorporating the
changes into the section of the
ASSU By-Laws dealing with the
Fundamental Standard.
The resolution is a modification
of one approved by a similar com
mittee last April.
It still must be approved by
President Wallace Sterling, and
the Legislature before it can go
into effect.

The Executive Committee
of the Academic Council,
Stanford's top faculty group,
last night unanimously ap
proved the .judicial reform
resolution. Prof. Benjamin 31.
Page, chairman of the. Com
mittee announced yesterday
evening.

If approved, the effect of the
resolution would differ from that
of the April resolution in that:
In the event of conflict be
tween University policy and the
ASSU Constitution and By Laws,
the latter would be "controlling
in ASSU judicial proceedings,"
rather than the more inclusive
"standard of conduct."
A student charged with con
duct contrary to the Fundamen
tal Standard would not be al
lowed to plead ignorance of the
law if the standard of conduct he
was breaking was established in
either (1> the ASSU Constitution
or By Laws, or (2) specific writ
ten. publicized regulations and
policies adopted by the Univer
sity, or (3 > a book of judicial prec
edents, tentatively scheduled for
publication by the ASSU.
The competence, or jurisdic
tion, of student judicial courts
would be extended from ASSU
law to all University policy not
in conflict with the ASSU Consti
tution and By Laws.
— The ASSU judicial council
would be prevented from passing
judgment upon an individual who
violates University policy that is
in conflict with ASSU law.
The President of the Univer
sity is given the power to veto
any "right" that LASSU might
give in the future to students ap
pearing before a tribunal set up
by the University to try a stu
dent violating a University law
that is in conflict with ASSU law.
If a student chooses to have
his case handled by the Dean of
Students, any appeal resulting
from the case must be directed
to a student-faculty Appeals
Board, should one be created, or
to an interim appellate board eho

sen by the faculty and the Presi
dent. Under the April resolution,
appeals would have been directed
to the student judicial body
"which would have had jurisdic
tion to review a decision of the
judicial council which would have

tried the case had it not been han
dled by the dean."
Controversy over the student
judiciary reached a climax last
February 4, when LASSU de
clared that the ASSU should have
"sole jurisdiction over student af

fairs and conduct." This state
ment of philosophy was ineorpor
ated three weeks later into a By
