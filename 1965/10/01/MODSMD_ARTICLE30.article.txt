it is better to a part of

exist forever and never be a

The spiralling effect of any

the G.S.A. dance Monday night
which has been mentioned as pos

The lead article in Monday's
Daily (President Sets Forth This
[ Year's Goals) was encouraging to
members of the university com
munity because it showed that
students, faculty, and administra
tors will be able to get together
this year and discuss matters in
stead of trying to dictate policy to
one another.
The only thing that bothered
me about the article was that it
| made student - faculty liaison
I groups seem to be an innovation
; of the Mackenzie Administration.
'To the contrary, these groups are
modeled on the Engineering Stu
dent-Faculty Liaison Committee,
which was begun two years ago
; by Professor John Vennard of the
• Civil Engineering Department.
The success of Professor Ven
! nard's group in bringing about
j better student-faculty relations
! prompted the formation of these
| new groups, which hopefully will
; meet with the acceptance that has
! been found in the Engineering
I School.

• Stu-Fae Groups
Editor; The Daily
The lead article in Monday's
Daily (President Sets Forth This
[ Year's Goals) was encouraging to
members of the university com
munity because it showed that
students, faculty, and administra
tors will be able to get together
this year and discuss matters in
stead of trying to dictate policy to
one another.
The only thing that bothered
me about the article was that it
| made student - faculty liaison
I groups seem to be an innovation
; of the Mackenzie Administration.
'To the contrary, these groups are
modeled on the Engineering Stu
dent-Faculty Liaison Committee,
which was begun two years ago
; by Professor John Vennard of the
• Civil Engineering Department.
The success of Professor Ven
! nard's group in bringing about
j better student-faculty relations
! prompted the formation of these
| new groups, which hopefully will
; meet with the acceptance that has
! been found in the Engineering
I School.
