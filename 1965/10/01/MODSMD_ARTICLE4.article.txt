# CLUB DEDICATION TODAY
## Faculty No Longer Homeless 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
Dedication ceremonies for the
newly-opened Faculty Club will
be held this afternoon in the
large courtyard of the Club.
Beginning about 5:30 at the $1-
million structure adjacent to Tre
sidder Union, the dedication will
consist of short speeches by Pres
ident Sterling; E. Howard Brooks,
president of the Faculty Club,
and Walter Haas, trustee of the
Lucie Stern estate which gave
the grant for construction of the
building.
The completion of the vlub ful
fills a long-held dream of Faculty
Club members, homeless for five
years since being evicted from
their old clubhouse, now the
NROTC center.
The Coming Together
"The Club will he the place
where the entire academic com
munity can come together in
formally". says President Brooks,
executive assistant to the vice
president and provost. "There was
no place like it lie fore." The old
clubhouse had mainly recreation
al facilities tennis. milliards,
pool and was, far from the cen
ter of campus.
"By constituencies and discip
lines, modern universities tend to
fragment, even more drastically
than C. P. Snow's distinction of
the 'two cultures': scientific and
humanistic. The Club will bring
all elements of the academic com
munity together and indirectily
stimulate cross-fertilization of
ideas," Brooks says. "Scholars
will come together informally,
but will be meeting profession
ally."
The Carbon 14 process for dat
ing artifacts was discovered

through informal discussions be
tween a physicist and an Egyptol
ogist at the University of Chicago
faculty club.
"In the world of knowledge,
cross-fertilization between allied
and even diverse areas is a very
stimulating and productive
thing." slated Lawrence Kimpton,

former Chancellor of the Univers
ity of Chicago and now a Stan
ford Trustee in the PACE bro
chure on the Club.
A Sense ol' Unity
"The other great advantage, of
course, is that it creates a sense
of unity and solidarity within the
university, through the kind of

easy and natural communication
that it promotes."
Response to the Club, opened
September 20, has been "terribly
encouraging," according to Dr.
Brooks. "There has been general
acceptance of the Club and pleas
ure with the facilities there. 1
