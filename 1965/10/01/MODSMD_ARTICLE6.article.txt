# WILL 'STAY WITH PROBLEM'
## Sigma Chis Stick In National 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
As far as local chapters go.
Stanford's Omega of Sigma Chi is
for from being the sweetheart of
the national.
Accused by the fraternity's
Grand Consul of flaunting a
"pseudo sophisticated attitude."
the Stanford house was placed on
a year's suspension last April.
The suspension came at the same
time a Negro was pledged
"We have the choice now of
sticking with the problem or go

ing local," said Frank Olrich, last
year's house president and pres
ently spokesman l'or the group.
Olrich fell the house would prob
ably "stay with the problem." He
noted although the Sigma Chi na
tional convention this July de
feated two proposals to give more
autonomy to local chapters in
membership selection, pledge
photographs are no longer re
quired before an individual can
be initiated.
National officers of the fra
ternity claimed the suspension of

Alpha Omega resulted from "dis
regard (if and active opposition
to rituals." But Olrich, speaking
for the house, said "we have fell
and always will feel that the sus
pension was based on the dis
crimination question." He said
the house planned to follow parts
of the national ritual that were
neglected in the past.
No Compromise
"However, wo do not intend to
to compromise our moral position
on the question of racial discrimi
nation," Olrich said.
Alpha Omega received notice of
its suspension from national presi
dent Harry V. Wade in a letter
dated April 7. Kenny Washington,
a Negro student at Stanford, had
been pledged formally on April 3.
The suspension, however, was
not entirely unexpected, for ex
tensive correspondence between
the Stanford chapter and the na
tional took place all of last year.
The chapter had written the na
tional and protested a "gentle
men's agreement" that persons of
racial minorities would not he ad
mitted to the national.
To this Mr. Wade replied that
he would not resent "having a
high class Chinese or Japanese
hoy admitted to Sigma Chi." But
Wade said lie knew "full well"
that the presence of a Chinese or
Japanese boy "would lie highly
resented on the West Coast."
Ovrri Steps
Wade later wrote to Stanford
Sigma Chi alumni, promising that
if the chapter took "any overt step
or act," the house would be sus
pended. "We are in no mood due
to the unfortunate publicity to
temporize with the boys at Palo
Alto for one minute.'' Wade said.
Many have come to the support
oft he Stanford fraternity. Se\ era I
alumni haw helped with legal

matters, and the University gave
the house its full support.
President Wallace Sterling, in
a letter to the house April 13, said:
"Let me assure you that your con
tinued efforts to eliminate de
facto discrimination practices
from within your fraternity will
enjoy the support of this Univer
sity." Sterling cited a 1957 resolu
tion of the Stanford Board of
Trustees opposing discriminatory
racial and religious clauses and
practices.
Alpha Omega chapter of Sigma
Chi remains on suspension; at
least until next April. The situa
tion now. as one member de
scribed it, is simply "to wait and
see" what happens next.

on the question of racial discrimi
nation," Olrich said.
Alpha Omega received notice of
its suspension from national presi
dent Harry V. Wade in a letter
dated April 7. Kenny Washington,
a Negro student at Stanford, had
been pledged formally on April 3.
The suspension, however, was
not entirely unexpected, for ex
tensive correspondence between
the Stanford chapter and the na
tional took place all of last year.
The chapter had written the na
tional and protested a "gentle
men's agreement" that persons of
racial minorities would not he ad
mitted to the national.
To this Mr. Wade replied that
he would not resent "having a
high class Chinese or Japanese
hoy admitted to Sigma Chi." But
Wade said lie knew "full well"
that the presence of a Chinese or
Japanese boy "would lie highly
resented on the West Coast."
Ovrri Steps
Wade later wrote to Stanford
Sigma Chi alumni, promising that
if the chapter took "any overt step
or act," the house would be sus
pended. "We are in no mood due
to the unfortunate publicity to
temporize with the boys at Palo
Alto for one minute.'' Wade said.
Many have come to the support

matters, and the University gave

President Wallace Sterling, in
a letter to the house April 13, said:
"Let me assure you that your con
tinued efforts to eliminate de
facto discrimination practices
from within your fraternity will
enjoy the support of this Univer
sity." Sterling cited a 1957 resolu
tion of the Stanford Board of
Trustees opposing discriminatory
racial and religious clauses and
practices.
Alpha Omega chapter of Sigma
Chi remains on suspension; at
least until next April. The situa
tion now. as one member de
