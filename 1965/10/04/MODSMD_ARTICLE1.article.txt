# Stanford Swings Into TMU Jazz Year '65-'66
## 
### AL, HEINEMAN 
The Stanford Jazz Year (SJY) '65-'O6
which begins today with Ralph J. Gleason's
talk at Trcsidder and which will include three
quarters of intensive jazz exposure was con
ceived by accident.
Tresidder Union Board was looking for a
year-long program which would combine cul
tural education with entertainment for the
Stanford community. And' Rick Bale, senior
psychology major from Tiburon and longtime
jazz buff, was looking for help in organizing
some jazz concerts at Stanford. Mike Collins,
a senior history major and Union cultural arts
division chairman, discussed the possibility
with Bale.
Something For Everyone
What evolved was a program to serve
as an introduction to jazz for those who know
little about the subject, a further education
for those well acquainted with jazz, and en
tertainment, in the form of concerts, films and
exhibits, for everyone.
The talks, this quarter given by four of

the most important jazz figures in the coun
try, will be aimed at giving background to the
jazz novice; but the demonstrations and re
cordings featured by the speakers, and par
ticipation afterward by students, will insure
the interest of the most knowledgeable jazz
fans on campus. Lectures are under the su
pervision of Pat Unger, a sophomore econom
ics major from Seattle.
The exhibits at Tresidder are particularly
noteworthy for their variety and uniqueness.
Along the outside of the second-floor level is
a photographic essay of jazz' southern origins
called "Jazz and Folk Backgrounds" compiled
by Frederick Ramsey Jr. Ramsey received two
Guggenheim Fellowships for field research
and produced almost 50 folk and jazz record
ings for the Folkways label.
Photos, Instruments, Tajx-s
Ramsey assembled the photos expressly
for the SJY program from his photo archives
containing over 6000 negatives depicting
southern life and music. Artifacts, sheet music
and instruments from the early periods of jazz
are displayed outside at the rear of the second

level.
Inside, in Rom 270. a display of photos of
early jazz and quasi-jazz musicians is comple
mented by a 75-minute tape of rare recordings
of these early jazzmen, put together for SJY
by KPFA jazz disc jockey Phil Elvvood. who
narrates the tape.
Jazz Tree
In the second-floor foyer pictures of Louis
Armstrong are displayed, along with the "Tree
of Jazz," showing locales and groupings of
jazz through 19-10. The tree is the brainchild
of Sophomore Nance Nichols, who is co-ordin
ator of all the exhibits scheduled throughout
the school year.
On Oct. lf>, the photos in room 270 will be
replaced by pictures of jazz musicians who
were popular from the Depression Era
through 1940. Phil Elwood will compile an
other tape recording to supplement the photo
graphs.
The first tape features some truly original
and entertaining performances by such artists
as Bunk Johnson, Sidney Beehet, Bix Beider
becke, and Louis Armstrong.

Tlie Armstrong display will change on
Oct. 11 to a series of photos of Duke Ellington
and Ella Fitzgerald, who will appear at Frost
on Oct. 31 in a jazz event of the first magni
tude.
Another aspect of Tresidder's part in the
Jazz Year will be a film series, under the su
pervision of sophomore Pete Thompson. The
first in the series will be a 2-hour program,
shown free to members of the Stanford com
munity on Oct. 15 and 22, of early and rare
short movies featuring Bessie Smith, Elling
ton, Billle Holliday, and others. The films date
as far back as 1929.
Later movies will be regular Hollywood
productions highlighted either by jazz scores
or using jazz in the plot line, as well as jazz
short subjects including the widely-seen film
ing of the Newport Jazz Festival, "Jazz on a
Summer's Day." The first film program was
assembled by private collector, John Baker,
of Columbus, Ohio.
The programs sponsored by Tresidder Un
ion. beginning three years ago, have been
planned and conducted entirely by students,
and have included "Project da Vinci," the

Shakespeare quadricentennial observation,
"The Legacy of the Civil War," and now.
the Stanford Jazz Year. The organization of
these programs, which have continually added
to the cultural opportunities avail able on
campus, has drawn considerable attention and
praise from university and educational
figures.
The final element of SJY, and what will
be the most widely attended and publicized,
is the concert series, supervised by concert
managers Don Ray, a junior and Jeff Armi
stead, a senior.
The first concert stars Louis Armstrong on
Oct. 10. Tickets for that concert, and for the
Ellington-Fitzgerald event on Oct. 31, are
available at the Tresidder Union box office.
Future concerts will probably headline
Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk, appear
ing together, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Ray
Charles (if...), Miles Davis and John Coltrane.
There will be two concerts per quarter.
SJY is on a non-profit basis; the larger the
attendance at early concerts, the greater the
number of artists who may appear in later
performance.

The exhibits at Tresidder are particularly
noteworthy for their variety and uniqueness.
Along the outside of the second-floor level is
a photographic essay of jazz' southern origins
called "Jazz and Folk Backgrounds" compiled
by Frederick Ramsey Jr. Ramsey received two
Guggenheim Fellowships for field research
and produced almost 50 folk and jazz record
ings for the Folkways label.
Photos, Instruments, Tajx-s
Ramsey assembled the photos expressly
for the SJY program from his photo archives
containing over 6000 negatives depicting
southern life and music. Artifacts, sheet music
and instruments from the early periods of jazz
are displayed outside at the rear of the second

level.
Inside, in Rom 270. a display of photos of
early jazz and quasi-jazz musicians is comple
mented by a 75-minute tape of rare recordings
of these early jazzmen, put together for SJY
by KPFA jazz disc jockey Phil Elvvood. who
narrates the tape.
Jazz Tree
In the second-floor foyer pictures of Louis
Armstrong are displayed, along with the "Tree
of Jazz," showing locales and groupings of
jazz through 19-10. The tree is the brainchild
of Sophomore Nance Nichols, who is co-ordin
ator of all the exhibits scheduled throughout
the school year.
On Oct. lf>, the photos in room 270 will be
replaced by pictures of jazz musicians who
were popular from the Depression Era
through 1940. Phil Elwood will compile an
other tape recording to supplement the photo
graphs.
The first tape features some truly original
and entertaining performances by such artists
as Bunk Johnson, Sidney Beehet, Bix Beider
becke, and Louis Armstrong.

Tlie Armstrong display will change on
Oct. 11 to a series of photos of Duke Ellington
and Ella Fitzgerald, who will appear at Frost
on Oct. 31 in a jazz event of the first magni
tude.
Another aspect of Tresidder's part in the
Jazz Year will be a film series, under the su
pervision of sophomore Pete Thompson. The
first in the series will be a 2-hour program,
shown free to members of the Stanford com
munity on Oct. 15 and 22, of early and rare
short movies featuring Bessie Smith, Elling
ton, Billle Holliday, and others. The films date
as far back as 1929.
Later movies will be regular Hollywood
productions highlighted either by jazz scores
or using jazz in the plot line, as well as jazz
short subjects including the widely-seen film
ing of the Newport Jazz Festival, "Jazz on a
Summer's Day." The first film program was
assembled by private collector, John Baker,
of Columbus, Ohio.
The programs sponsored by Tresidder Un
ion. beginning three years ago, have been
planned and conducted entirely by students,
and have included "Project da Vinci," the

Shakespeare quadricentennial observation,
"The Legacy of the Civil War," and now.
the Stanford Jazz Year. The organization of
these programs, which have continually added
to the cultural opportunities avail able on
campus, has drawn considerable attention and
praise from university and educational
figures.
The final element of SJY, and what will
be the most widely attended and publicized,
is the concert series, supervised by concert
managers Don Ray, a junior and Jeff Armi
stead, a senior.
The first concert stars Louis Armstrong on
Oct. 10. Tickets for that concert, and for the
Ellington-Fitzgerald event on Oct. 31, are
available at the Tresidder Union box office.
Future concerts will probably headline
Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk, appear
ing together, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Ray
Charles (if...), Miles Davis and John Coltrane.
There will be two concerts per quarter.
SJY is on a non-profit basis; the larger the
attendance at early concerts, the greater the
number of artists who may appear in later
performance.
The Stanford Jazz Year (SJY) '65-'O6
which begins today with Ralph J. Gleason's
talk at Trcsidder and which will include three
quarters of intensive jazz exposure was con
ceived by accident.
Tresidder Union Board was looking for a
year-long program which would combine cul
tural education with entertainment for the
Stanford community. And' Rick Bale, senior
psychology major from Tiburon and longtime
jazz buff, was looking for help in organizing
some jazz concerts at Stanford. Mike Collins,
a senior history major and Union cultural arts
division chairman, discussed the possibility
with Bale.
Something For Everyone
What evolved was a program to serve
as an introduction to jazz for those who know
little about the subject, a further education
for those well acquainted with jazz, and en
tertainment, in the form of concerts, films and
exhibits, for everyone.
The talks, this quarter given by four of

the most important jazz figures in the coun
try, will be aimed at giving background to the
jazz novice; but the demonstrations and re
cordings featured by the speakers, and par
ticipation afterward by students, will insure
the interest of the most knowledgeable jazz
fans on campus. Lectures are under the su
pervision of Pat Unger, a sophomore econom
ics major from Seattle.

On Oct. lf>, the photos in room 270 will be
replaced by pictures of jazz musicians who
were popular from the Depression Era
through 1940. Phil Elwood will compile an
other tape recording to supplement the photo
graphs.
The first tape features some truly original
and entertaining performances by such artists
as Bunk Johnson, Sidney Beehet, Bix Beider
becke, and Louis Armstrong.

Tlie Armstrong display will change on
Oct. 11 to a series of photos of Duke Ellington
and Ella Fitzgerald, who will appear at Frost
on Oct. 31 in a jazz event of the first magni
tude.
Another aspect of Tresidder's part in the
Jazz Year will be a film series, under the su
pervision of sophomore Pete Thompson. The
first in the series will be a 2-hour program,
shown free to members of the Stanford com
munity on Oct. 15 and 22, of early and rare
short movies featuring Bessie Smith, Elling
ton, Billle Holliday, and others. The films date
as far back as 1929.
Later movies will be regular Hollywood
productions highlighted either by jazz scores
or using jazz in the plot line, as well as jazz
short subjects including the widely-seen film
ing of the Newport Jazz Festival, "Jazz on a
Summer's Day." The first film program was
assembled by private collector, John Baker,
of Columbus, Ohio.
The programs sponsored by Tresidder Un
ion. beginning three years ago, have been
planned and conducted entirely by students,
and have included "Project da Vinci," the

Shakespeare quadricentennial observation,
"The Legacy of the Civil War," and now.
the Stanford Jazz Year. The organization of
these programs, which have continually added
to the cultural opportunities avail able on
campus, has drawn considerable attention and
praise from university and educational
figures.
The final element of SJY, and what will
be the most widely attended and publicized,
is the concert series, supervised by concert
managers Don Ray, a junior and Jeff Armi
stead, a senior.
The first concert stars Louis Armstrong on
Oct. 10. Tickets for that concert, and for the
Ellington-Fitzgerald event on Oct. 31, are
available at the Tresidder Union box office.
Future concerts will probably headline
Dizzy Gillespie and Thelonious Monk, appear
ing together, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Ray
Charles (if...), Miles Davis and John Coltrane.
There will be two concerts per quarter.
SJY is on a non-profit basis; the larger the
attendance at early concerts, the greater the
number of artists who may appear in later
performance.
The Stanford Jazz Year (SJY) '65-'O6
which begins today with Ralph J. Gleason's
talk at Trcsidder and which will include three
quarters of intensive jazz exposure was con
ceived by accident.
Tresidder Union Board was looking for a
year-long program which would combine cul
tural education with entertainment for the
Stanford community. And' Rick Bale, senior
psychology major from Tiburon and longtime
jazz buff, was looking for help in organizing
some jazz concerts at Stanford. Mike Collins,
a senior history major and Union cultural arts
division chairman, discussed the possibility
with Bale.
Something For Everyone
What evolved was a program to serve
as an introduction to jazz for those who know
little about the subject, a further education
for those well acquainted with jazz, and en
tertainment, in the form of concerts, films and
exhibits, for everyone.
The talks, this quarter given by four of

the most important jazz figures in the coun
try, will be aimed at giving background to the
jazz novice; but the demonstrations and re
cordings featured by the speakers, and par
ticipation afterward by students, will insure
the interest of the most knowledgeable jazz
fans on campus. Lectures are under the su
pervision of Pat Unger, a sophomore econom
ics major from Seattle.
The exhibits at Tresidder are particularly
noteworthy for their variety and uniqueness.
Along the outside of the second-floor level is
a photographic essay of jazz' southern origins
called "Jazz and Folk Backgrounds" compiled
by Frederick Ramsey Jr. Ramsey received two
Guggenheim Fellowships for field research
and produced almost 50 folk and jazz record
ings for the Folkways label.
Photos, Instruments, Tajx-s
Ramsey assembled the photos expressly
for the SJY program from his photo archives
containing over 6000 negatives depicting
southern life and music. Artifacts, sheet music
and instruments from the early periods of jazz
are displayed outside at the rear of the second

level.
Inside, in Rom 270. a display of photos of
early jazz and quasi-jazz musicians is comple
mented by a 75-minute tape of rare recordings
of these early jazzmen, put together for SJY
by KPFA jazz disc jockey Phil Elvvood. who
narrates the tape.
Jazz Tree
In the second-floor foyer pictures of Louis
Armstrong are displayed, along with the "Tree
of Jazz," showing locales and groupings of
jazz through 19-10. The tree is the brainchild
of Sophomore Nance Nichols, who is co-ordin
ator of all the exhibits scheduled throughout
the school year.
