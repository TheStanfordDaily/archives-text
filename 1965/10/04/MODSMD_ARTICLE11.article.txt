# Peace Corps Staff To Visit, Explain Program, Give Tests
## 
### 
Tho Peace Corps will visit
Stanford the week of October
11-15 to look for more Volun
teers to join the 325 who have
already gone from the campus
into service overseas.
Pence Corps staff members,
led by return volunteer, Chuck
Butler, will be at the University
to explain the Peace Corps, its
training and service programs,
and the opportunities it offers
students. Applications will also
be accepted. The non-competi
tive Peace Corps Placement
Test will be given daily. These
tests are used to determine an
applicant's strengths and quali
fications and require no prepar
ation.
Butler, a 1962 Stanford gradu
ate, recently completed his two
year Peace Corps service in
Venezuela. Prior to going
abroad he did graduate work in
education at Stanford.
Groups interested in having
a Peace Corps representative
speak and answer questions at
any time during the week
should make arrangements with
Mr. Walter Findeisen, Assistant
Registrar.
Eighty-five Stanford students
are presently among the 10,000
Peace Corps Volunteers serving
in 46 countries of Asia, Africa
and Latin America. An addi-
i

tional 240 have already com- j
pleted their two- year terms of ,
service.
The Peace Corps has more j
requests for Volunteers than it ,
can fill and the need is growing j
greater. Students with back- i
grounds in all fields of study j
are in demand for overseas pro- j
grams. Openings exist for doc- j
tors and nurses, engineers,
architects, teachers, sociologists,
economists and agriculturalists.
Juniors, seniors, graduates and
faculty can qualify immediately j
for Peace Corps training.
