# Informal Discussions, Teas, Highlight Stu-Fac Program
## 
### 
For many Stanford students,
the professor is but a giver of
sleep-inducing lectures and des
pair-inducing grades; contact
With the faculty as people is
rare.
The Student-Faculty Board,
an ASSU Board open 1o under
graduates, provides opportuni
ties to penetrate this barrier of
depersonalization through non
classroom situations including
students and professors.
Dave Clark, Stu-Fac chair
man, characterizes his commit
tee's general aims as "promot
ing better student-faculty rela
tions, mainly through small
group contact" and acting as an
"informal committee" to tell
students an-d faculty of the pro
grams available.
Residence Golloquia
Inaugurated
Clark feels that communica
tion between students and fac
ulty members becomes increas
ingly important as students
show more positive interest in
the formation and enforcement
of University policy. Through
the type of informal meetings
sponsored by Stu-Fac, students
can become more aware of the
faculty as people and of their
feelings about student-faculty
administration relations.
Clark considers the Residence
Colloquia the most important of
this year's Stu-Fac programs.
Initiated formally last year by
Phi Kappa Sigma, the program
allows a residence to invite a
professor to teach a seminar
within the living group.
Approximately fifteen groups
are expected to participate this
year.
Informal meetings such as
hostels and Tresidder Teas are
two other major Stu-Fac pro
grams. The meetings are comp
limented by the Advisers Pro
gram Faculty Associate Pro
gram. and Professor Handbook.
The hostels held on Alpine
Road are informal get-togethers
between a professor and up to
twenty students. The partici
pants discuss selected (and
often unselected) topics on a
personal, informal basis.
Hostels, Teas Planned
Four hostels are scheduled for
this quarter, some of them to
be overnight*. Professor Jeffery
Smith will discuss "Parapsy
chology — Fact and Implica
tion" at the first meeting Friday
and Saturday. Future faculty
participants include professors
John Gurley, Ronald Rebholz,
and James Carlsmith.
The hostels are open to the
entire student body. Sign-up
lists will be available in the
ASSU office starting today.
The Tresidder Teas continue
the program held in homos last
year. Students will have an op
portunity to talk with several
host faculty members in a cas
ual social atmosphere. All topics
are open for discussion. Pro
fessor Gordon Wright and sev
eral professors from the History
and French Departments will
host the first tea.
The Faculty Associate Pro
gram, sponsored by Stu-Fac,

provides a fund for faculty
members, allowing them to en
tertain up to fifteen students in
their home. Through this pro
gram, Stu-Fac acts as a liaison
between faculty and student
groups.
The Advisor Program is de
signed to increase contact be
tween the adviser and his ad
visees by offering the opportun
ity for the adviser to meet with
the students at some time other
than during pre-registration
week.

A special Stu-Fac project, still
in a tentative stage, is the Pro
fessor Handbook. A similar
handbook was published in 1961
by an especially "anthropologic
ally-minded" Student Faculty
Commission. The handbook, like
it projected successor, contains
sketches of the professors in
cluding their activities and back
grounds. The Handbook is simi
lar to the Professor Resumes,
also printed by Stu-Fac, but will
be more comprehensive when
finished.


ONLY 169 MORE DAYS — Until the solar equinox is reached
once more and Spring is officially proclaimed. These lovelies
are supposedly Stanford women. Will wonders never cease.

Informal meetings such as
hostels and Tresidder Teas are
two other major Stu-Fac pro
grams. The meetings are comp
limented by the Advisers Pro
gram Faculty Associate Pro
gram. and Professor Handbook.
The hostels held on Alpine
Road are informal get-togethers
between a professor and up to
twenty students. The partici
pants discuss selected (and
often unselected) topics on a
personal, informal basis.
Hostels, Teas Planned
Four hostels are scheduled for
this quarter, some of them to
be overnight*. Professor Jeffery
Smith will discuss "Parapsy
chology — Fact and Implica
tion" at the first meeting Friday
and Saturday. Future faculty
participants include professors
John Gurley, Ronald Rebholz,
and James Carlsmith.
The hostels are open to the
entire student body. Sign-up
lists will be available in the
ASSU office starting today.
The Tresidder Teas continue
the program held in homos last
year. Students will have an op
portunity to talk with several
host faculty members in a cas
ual social atmosphere. All topics
are open for discussion. Pro
fessor Gordon Wright and sev
eral professors from the History
and French Departments will
host the first tea.
The Faculty Associate Pro
gram, sponsored by Stu-Fac,

provides a fund for faculty
members, allowing them to en
tertain up to fifteen students in
their home. Through this pro
gram, Stu-Fac acts as a liaison
between faculty and student
groups.
The Advisor Program is de
signed to increase contact be
tween the adviser and his ad
visees by offering the opportun
ity for the adviser to meet with
the students at some time other
than during pre-registration
week.

A special Stu-Fac project, still
in a tentative stage, is the Pro
fessor Handbook. A similar
handbook was published in 1961
by an especially "anthropologic
ally-minded" Student Faculty
Commission. The handbook, like
it projected successor, contains
sketches of the professors in
cluding their activities and back
grounds. The Handbook is simi
lar to the Professor Resumes,
also printed by Stu-Fac, but will
be more comprehensive when
finished.


ONLY 169 MORE DAYS — Until the solar equinox is reached
once more and Spring is officially proclaimed. These lovelies

For many Stanford students,
the professor is but a giver of
sleep-inducing lectures and des
pair-inducing grades; contact
With the faculty as people is
rare.
The Student-Faculty Board,
an ASSU Board open 1o under
graduates, provides opportuni
ties to penetrate this barrier of
depersonalization through non
classroom situations including
students and professors.
Dave Clark, Stu-Fac chair
man, characterizes his commit
tee's general aims as "promot
ing better student-faculty rela
tions, mainly through small
group contact" and acting as an
"informal committee" to tell
students an-d faculty of the pro
grams available.
Residence Golloquia
Inaugurated
Clark feels that communica
tion between students and fac
ulty members becomes increas
ingly important as students
show more positive interest in
the formation and enforcement
of University policy. Through
the type of informal meetings
sponsored by Stu-Fac, students
can become more aware of the
faculty as people and of their
feelings about student-faculty
administration relations.
Clark considers the Residence
Colloquia the most important of
this year's Stu-Fac programs.
Initiated formally last year by
Phi Kappa Sigma, the program
allows a residence to invite a
professor to teach a seminar
within the living group.
Approximately fifteen groups
are expected to participate this
year.
