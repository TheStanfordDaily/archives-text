# Indians Overcome Military Bugaboo; Shoot Down Air Force In Second Half
## 
### TOM EDISION 
Stanford's dislike for the mili
tary services continues to grow,
not only from the fear of the
Graft, but because of the acade
mies' conduct in the Indians'
last two football games.
First, the Navy tied the Tribe,
7-7. Then last Saturday the Air
Force's fighting to the bitter
end before being defeated 17-16
on a last second field goal top
ped everything.
In the first half against the
Falcons, Stanford couldn't do
anything right.
Dave Lewis threw seven in

complete passes and had one in
tercepted. He lost 38 yards rush
ing. Stanford had eight penal
ties called on them, seven for
being off side.
Cadets Look Good
The Air Force could hardly do
anything wrong. They scored a
touchdown on an incomplete
pass. They were within field
goal distance three times, mak
ing one. And they gained a total
of 192 yards compared to Stan
ford's 58.
In the first quarter Stein was
having his problems finding re
ceivers. He threw three straight

incomplete passes before com
pleting a 15-yard pass to End
Jim Schultz after a fine 12-yard
run by fullback John Ondrejko.
Ondrejko provided the Cadets
with the bulk of their ground
attack which had been missing
in their last contest and un
doubtedly was the reason the
Falcons came so close 1o vic
tory.
Falcon's First Score
Early in the second quarter,
the Cadets tok the ball from
their own 25 down to the Stan
ford 9 in nine plays. After an
8 yard loss, Dan Radtke booted
a field goal from the 35 for the
game's first score.
After holding Stanford for a

series of downs, the Falcons
again proceded to move tho ball
65 yards and in for a score with
just over throe minutes left to
play on a pass-play that is still
being disputed.
All those who saw tho play,
except tho referees and I doubt
that thoy honestly saw the play,
proclaim that Stein's 5 yard
pass to Guy Hogle was dropped
but the officials signaled a
touchdown. Their all important
PAT was no good.
Air Force Leads at Half
The first half ended with the
Air Force loading by nine, but
they had barely missed another
opportunity to score late in tho
second quarter.
They had turned an intercep
tion into a scoring drive. Sonny
Lit/.'s 31 yard pass brought the
Cadets within six yards of the
goal bid a holding penalty and
a defensive stand by the Indians
kept the Cadets from scoring.
If tho first half had been a
story of the Air Force produc
ing sustained drives, t he second
half saw Stanford duplicate this
feat and pull out one of tho
most exciting Indians victories
in many years. The Indians
were a new ball club in the sec
ond half.
Indians' First Score
The first time Stanford got
their hands on the ball thoy pro
coded to run wide on the Cadets
on beautiful pitch-outs. Their
first score of the game came on
a line-buck by Ray Handley
from tho two. Terry DeSylvia's
extra-point kick was good.
When everything seemed to
look good for the Indians, trail
ing by only two points, disaster
struck again. Bob Barnes of the
Air Force returned tho follow

ing kick-off 98 yards for a
touchdown.
91 -Yard Drive
Tho Falcons load had sprung
to nine big points. But again
Stanford produced another
drive, this one for 91 yards.
Their score came early in the
fourth quarter on a 13-yard run
by Bob Blunt who later sustain
ed an injury to his knee.
Another Stein-to-Sehultz pass
set up a field goal attempt by
tho Air Force from the IS but
it was wide.
After punting on a fourth
and-one situation, Stanford held
Ihe Cadets for four downs. The
next series of plays for the In
dians brought thom from their
12 yard line to tho Falcons' 19,
79 yards in 16 plays.
Climatic Ending
From there with only 22 sec
onds in the game, Terry De-
Sylvia booted a 29-yard field
goal providing Stanford with
their margin of victory, one
point.
Although a beautiful 19-yard
run by Lewis, bringing the ball
to tho two-yard line, had boon
called back because of a penalty,
the Indians were able to pro
duce under pressure and carry
homo ihe victory.
Statistically tho Indians gain
ed 216 yards on tho ground to
94 in Ihe air. They outgained
Ihe Air Force 310 to 251 in total
yardage.

a defensive stand by the Indians
kept the Cadets from scoring.
If tho first half had been a
story of the Air Force produc
ing sustained drives, t he second
half saw Stanford duplicate this
feat and pull out one of tho
most exciting Indians victories
in many years. The Indians
were a new ball club in the sec
ond half.
Indians' First Score
The first time Stanford got
their hands on the ball thoy pro
coded to run wide on the Cadets
on beautiful pitch-outs. Their
first score of the game came on
a line-buck by Ray Handley
from tho two. Terry DeSylvia's
extra-point kick was good.
When everything seemed to
look good for the Indians, trail
ing by only two points, disaster
struck again. Bob Barnes of the
Air Force returned tho follow

ing kick-off 98 yards for a
touchdown.
91 -Yard Drive
Tho Falcons load had sprung
to nine big points. But again
Stanford produced another
drive, this one for 91 yards.
Their score came early in the
fourth quarter on a 13-yard run
by Bob Blunt who later sustain
ed an injury to his knee.
Another Stein-to-Sehultz pass
set up a field goal attempt by
tho Air Force from the IS but
it was wide.
After punting on a fourth
and-one situation, Stanford held
Ihe Cadets for four downs. The
next series of plays for the In
dians brought thom from their
12 yard line to tho Falcons' 19,
79 yards in 16 plays.
Climatic Ending
From there with only 22 sec
onds in the game, Terry De-
Sylvia booted a 29-yard field
goal providing Stanford with
their margin of victory, one
point.
Although a beautiful 19-yard
run by Lewis, bringing the ball
to tho two-yard line, had boon
called back because of a penalty,
the Indians were able to pro
duce under pressure and carry
homo ihe victory.
Statistically tho Indians gain
ed 216 yards on tho ground to
94 in Ihe air. They outgained
Ihe Air Force 310 to 251 in total
yardage.
Stanford's dislike for the mili
tary services continues to grow,
not only from the fear of the
Graft, but because of the acade
mies' conduct in the Indians'
last two football games.
First, the Navy tied the Tribe,
7-7. Then last Saturday the Air
Force's fighting to the bitter
end before being defeated 17-16
on a last second field goal top
ped everything.
In the first half against the
Falcons, Stanford couldn't do
anything right.
Dave Lewis threw seven in

complete passes and had one in
tercepted. He lost 38 yards rush
ing. Stanford had eight penal
ties called on them, seven for
being off side.
Cadets Look Good
The Air Force could hardly do
anything wrong. They scored a
touchdown on an incomplete
pass. They were within field
goal distance three times, mak
ing one. And they gained a total
of 192 yards compared to Stan
ford's 58.
In the first quarter Stein was
having his problems finding re
ceivers. He threw three straight

incomplete passes before com
pleting a 15-yard pass to End
Jim Schultz after a fine 12-yard
run by fullback John Ondrejko.
Ondrejko provided the Cadets
with the bulk of their ground
attack which had been missing
in their last contest and un
doubtedly was the reason the
Falcons came so close 1o vic
tory.
Falcon's First Score
Early in the second quarter,
the Cadets tok the ball from
their own 25 down to the Stan
ford 9 in nine plays. After an
8 yard loss, Dan Radtke booted
a field goal from the 35 for the
game's first score.
After holding Stanford for a

series of downs, the Falcons
again proceded to move tho ball
65 yards and in for a score with
just over throe minutes left to
play on a pass-play that is still
being disputed.
All those who saw tho play,
except tho referees and I doubt
that thoy honestly saw the play,
proclaim that Stein's 5 yard
pass to Guy Hogle was dropped
but the officials signaled a
touchdown. Their all important
PAT was no good.
Air Force Leads at Half
The first half ended with the
Air Force loading by nine, but
they had barely missed another
opportunity to score late in tho
second quarter.
They had turned an intercep
tion into a scoring drive. Sonny
Lit/.'s 31 yard pass brought the
Cadets within six yards of the
goal bid a holding penalty and
a defensive stand by the Indians
kept the Cadets from scoring.

ped everything.
In the first half against the
Falcons, Stanford couldn't do
anything right.
Dave Lewis threw seven in

complete passes and had one in
tercepted. He lost 38 yards rush
ing. Stanford had eight penal
ties called on them, seven for
being off side.
Cadets Look Good
The Air Force could hardly do
anything wrong. They scored a
touchdown on an incomplete
pass. They were within field
goal distance three times, mak
ing one. And they gained a total
of 192 yards compared to Stan
ford's 58.
In the first quarter Stein was
having his problems finding re
ceivers. He threw three straight

incomplete passes before com
pleting a 15-yard pass to End
Jim Schultz after a fine 12-yard
run by fullback John Ondrejko.
Ondrejko provided the Cadets
with the bulk of their ground
attack which had been missing
in their last contest and un
doubtedly was the reason the
Falcons came so close 1o vic
tory.
Falcon's First Score
Early in the second quarter,
the Cadets tok the ball from
their own 25 down to the Stan
ford 9 in nine plays. After an
8 yard loss, Dan Radtke booted
a field goal from the 35 for the
game's first score.
After holding Stanford for a

series of downs, the Falcons
again proceded to move tho ball
65 yards and in for a score with
just over throe minutes left to
play on a pass-play that is still
being disputed.
All those who saw tho play,
except tho referees and I doubt
that thoy honestly saw the play,
proclaim that Stein's 5 yard
pass to Guy Hogle was dropped
but the officials signaled a
touchdown. Their all important
PAT was no good.
Air Force Leads at Half
The first half ended with the
Air Force loading by nine, but
they had barely missed another
opportunity to score late in tho
second quarter.
They had turned an intercep
tion into a scoring drive. Sonny
Lit/.'s 31 yard pass brought the
Cadets within six yards of the
goal bid a holding penalty and
a defensive stand by the Indians
kept the Cadets from scoring.
If tho first half had been a
story of the Air Force produc
ing sustained drives, t he second
half saw Stanford duplicate this
feat and pull out one of tho
most exciting Indians victories
in many years. The Indians
were a new ball club in the sec
ond half.
Indians' First Score
The first time Stanford got
their hands on the ball thoy pro
coded to run wide on the Cadets
on beautiful pitch-outs. Their
first score of the game came on
a line-buck by Ray Handley
from tho two. Terry DeSylvia's
extra-point kick was good.
When everything seemed to
look good for the Indians, trail
ing by only two points, disaster
struck again. Bob Barnes of the
Air Force returned tho follow

ing kick-off 98 yards for a
touchdown.
91 -Yard Drive
Tho Falcons load had sprung
to nine big points. But again
Stanford produced another
drive, this one for 91 yards.
Their score came early in the
fourth quarter on a 13-yard run
by Bob Blunt who later sustain
ed an injury to his knee.
Another Stein-to-Sehultz pass
set up a field goal attempt by
tho Air Force from the IS but
it was wide.
After punting on a fourth
and-one situation, Stanford held
Ihe Cadets for four downs. The
next series of plays for the In
dians brought thom from their
12 yard line to tho Falcons' 19,
79 yards in 16 plays.
Climatic Ending
From there with only 22 sec
onds in the game, Terry De-
Sylvia booted a 29-yard field
goal providing Stanford with
their margin of victory, one
point.
Although a beautiful 19-yard
run by Lewis, bringing the ball
to tho two-yard line, had boon
called back because of a penalty,
the Indians were able to pro
duce under pressure and carry
homo ihe victory.
Statistically tho Indians gain
ed 216 yards on tho ground to
94 in Ihe air. They outgained
Ihe Air Force 310 to 251 in total
yardage.
Stanford's dislike for the mili
tary services continues to grow,
not only from the fear of the
Graft, but because of the acade
mies' conduct in the Indians'
last two football games.
First, the Navy tied the Tribe,
7-7. Then last Saturday the Air
Force's fighting to the bitter
end before being defeated 17-16
on a last second field goal top
ped everything.
