# Hibler Named as Lineman-of-Week
## 
### 
Mike Hibler, who started last
season at defensive left tackle,
was switched during spring prac
tice to fill ihe defensive right
guard slot. His efforts at this
position in last weekend's Air
Force game earned him ranking
by area sportswriters as Co-
Northern California Lineman of
the week.
Hiblers fine performance is
far from unexpected. Last year
as a Sophomore, Hibler proved
himself an extremely valuable
player. Playing nearly every sec
ond the Indians wtere on defense,
he saw 263 minutes of action.
Hibler was credited with the
sixth greatest number of tackles
and was rewarded for his pro
ficiency with the De Swart e-
Ellor Award for the Outstanding i
Sophomore Football Player.
