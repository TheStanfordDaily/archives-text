# Paint Disrupts Viet Nam Talk
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
Demonstrations and the throwing of a container of red paint
overshadowed a speech Friday night at Foothill College by Mux
well Taylor in which the former ambassador to Vietnam stated
that the initiative in the war seems to have been seized by the
Americans and the South Vietnamese.

Proceedings became hectic
during the question period after
the speech with the attempt of
Stanford student Tom Canter
bury to read a statement against
Taylor and the hurling of a con
tainer of red paint across the
stage into a group of pickets.
The container apparently
broke in flight and part of its
contents splattered Taylor and
moderator Ervin Roth, chairman
of Foothills social sciences divi
sion.
SCPV I>i<ln't Hint
Spokesmen for the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam,
organizers of the picketing
against Taylor, disclaimed Sun
day "any connection with the
person who threw the red paint.
. . . the paint was meant for the
SCPV," the announcement stat
ed.
Up to 100 demonstrators from
SCPV, Concerned Citizens, In
dividuals for Non-Violent Revo
lution, and students from San
Jose State, Menlo and Foothill
Colleges picketed outside the
Foothill gymnasium before, dur
ing. and after the speech.
A group of about twenty-five
students from Stanford had ob
tained tickets for the speech and
entered the gym with concealed
signs. During the standing ova
tion that followed Taylor's
speech, the group rushed from
their seats to tlie foot of the
stage and held up their signs. A
few of the signs were destroyed
by nearby members of the audi
ence.
Stale-incut Attacks Taylor
During the question period,
Roth recognized Canterbury, 18-
year old sophomore. Canterbury
mounted the stage and began to
read a statement: "You, Maxwell
Taylor are one of those most re
sponsible for the prolonged war
in Vietnam and for the loss of
lives on both sides."
Me was then stopped by Roth
who said he had granted Canter
bury's request on the under

standing that it would be a c-riti
cism of American policy an<d npt
"a personal attack."
Canterbury then read a fur
ther portion of the statement
but was forced to stop by the
noise of the audience. The paint -
throwing incident followed
shortly thereafter.
Opposition Group Sets Talk
A spokesman for SCPV told
the Daily yesterday evening that
Foothill had been informed of
the demonstrators' intention to
picket inside the gym. even
though this is contrary to col
lege policy.
"We merely wished the oppor
tunity to read our statement and
our pickets would have left the
gym, but were not asked to do
so," the spokesman said.
One of the picketing groups,
Concerned Citizens of Palo Alto,
had made previous arrange
ments with Foothill to present a
program of Anti-Vietnam War
views. The program, to be held
October 23 in the school's the
ater, was announced at the Tay
lor speech.
Turning Point
In this speech, Taylor de
clared: "our strategy is coher
ent and is producing results.
We must remain on course."
He expressed the view that the
monsoon offensive "may be a
turning point," and that the ini
tiative seems to have been seized
from the Communist guerrilla
fighters.
He noted that a margin of Id
to 1 is historically needed to win
against a guerrilla force but ex
pressed his belief that "superior
fire power and air mobility" can
reduce the ratio needed for vic
tory in Vietnam.
He looks for no clear end to
, the war, but "the time will come
when our basic objective, the
freedom of South Vietnam to
choose its own destiny, will be
attained."
