## 
### 
Stanford's frosh water polo
squad began their season th«
right way last Friday afternoon
when they drowned College of
Sequoias 16-10 in the Enema
pool.
The first chapter foretold the
story. Stanford at once domin
ated the scene on offense and de
fense. Sequoias barely saw the
ball which found canvas six
times for the Indians in those
first four minutes.
Sequoias' strategy for the
start of the second quarter
seemed to be "If you can't beat
'em, join 'em." Subsequently,
Sequoias' goalee scored the
quarter's first point for Stan
ford. This policy being hostile
to the theory of competitive
sport. Sequoias chose to turn
about, and did manage to tally
two that period against Stan
ford's five. The ha If time score
favored the Indians, 11-2.
The second half saw Sequoias
improve their standing. During
the third quarter they scored
thrice, while the Papooses net
ted another five. By the time
the last quarter rolled around,

Stanford had the rest of the
bench in the pool. Sequoias con
sequently marked five points,
bringing the final tally to 16-10,
Stanford.
Tally Leaders
Sparking the Indians' scoring
was Olympic Gold-Medalist Dick-
Roth, who netted six. Roth was
followed by Luis Nieolao, world
record-holder in the 100-meter
butterfly, and Mike Wall, each
with three, and All-American
Pete Siebert with two. Paul
Meyer tallied one, while Goalee
Doug Chapin was credited with
ihe point netted by his Sequoias
counterpart.

meet and past achievements of
his swimmers are any indica

ward to a very successful initial
year at Stanford.
