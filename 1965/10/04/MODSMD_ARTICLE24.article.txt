## Dodgers Tie Down NL Flag; Drysdale To Start Series 
### BOB THIERIOT 
The Dodgers from Los An
geles finally wrapped up the
usual exciting National League
race on Saturday by stumbling
to a 3-1 victory over the Braves.
The win eliminated the San
Francisco Giants from the pen
nant, even though the Giants
won their game on Saturday.

The Dodgers will meet the
Twins in the World Series on
Wednesday.
The Dodgers collected only
two singles against the Braves'
moundsmen, but managed to
amass three tallies. In the first
inning Jim Gilliam walked with
one out. He stole second and ad
vanced to third when Gene Oli
ver heaved the ball into center
field. Gilliam then scored on a
wild pitch.
Oliver homered off Sandy
Koufax in the fourth to tie the
contest. In the fifth with the
final score of the Giants' vic
tory staring down from the
scoreboard, the Dodgers re
ceived two runs.
Lou Johnson walked. Lefev
bre grounded a doubtful single
through shortstop. Wes Parker
then grounded to first base, and
it appeared that the eventual
throw to third had caught John
sou. But he was ruled safe, and
the Dodgers were on the way
to scoring two runs in their in
credibly delicate fashion.
Rose bo ro walked, Koufax
walked. Two runs danced home.
Koufax had little trouble for
the rest of the game, though he
tired near the end. He picked up
his 26th win of this season.
Wednesday afternoon the
World Series will visit Minne
sota for the first time. Experts
are undecided as to who will
win the series. Sports Illustrat
ed gives the edge to Minnesota.
Odds makers have given the
Dodgers 7-5 odds on the series,
11-10 for the first game.

But much to everyone's sur
prise Sandy Koufax, by far the
best pitcher in baseball, will not
open the series on the mound
for the Dodgers. He will be ob
serving a religious holiday, and
won't pitch until Thursday.
In the World Series the Dodg
ers will depend on their fantas
tic pitching of Sandv Koufax.
Don Drysdale, Ron Perronoski,
and Claude Osteen (when he
gets some runs). The Dodgers
offense consists mainly of
Maury Wills, Ron Fairly, Don
Drysdale (a pitcher, who is the
Dodgers' leading hitter), and an
occasional hit from anyone else.
The Dodgers' power is very dif
ficult to find, and the fielding
is only adequate.
The Twins have very good
pitching with Jim Grant, Jim
Kaat, and Camilio Pascual. The
bullpen is good for a few inn
ings with A 1 Worthington. The
Twins like the Dodgers have
great speed and like to try for
the extra base and run the de
fense into making errors. The
Twins power and ability 10
score is awesome.
On defense, the Twins are
weak in the infield. Theirs is the
type that Dodgers Wills, Gil
liam. and Davis like to bunt at
and run around.
The Dodgers to win will have
to lake advantage of the Twins'
defensive weaknesses to get a
couple of runs. Then they will
have to hope that their pitchers
can contrive to have the Twins
keep ihe baseball inside the play
ing field.

Dodgers' leading hitter), and an
occasional hit from anyone else.
The Dodgers' power is very dif
ficult to find, and the fielding
is only adequate.
The Twins have very good
pitching with Jim Grant, Jim
Kaat, and Camilio Pascual. The
bullpen is good for a few inn
ings with A 1 Worthington. The
Twins like the Dodgers have
great speed and like to try for
the extra base and run the de
fense into making errors. The
Twins power and ability 10
score is awesome.
On defense, the Twins are
weak in the infield. Theirs is the
type that Dodgers Wills, Gil
liam. and Davis like to bunt at
and run around.
The Dodgers to win will have
to lake advantage of the Twins'
defensive weaknesses to get a
couple of runs. Then they will
have to hope that their pitchers
can contrive to have the Twins
keep ihe baseball inside the play
ing field.

contest. In the fifth with the
final score of the Giants' vic
tory staring down from the
scoreboard, the Dodgers re
ceived two runs.
Lou Johnson walked. Lefev
bre grounded a doubtful single
through shortstop. Wes Parker

to scoring two runs in their in
credibly delicate fashion.

walked. Two runs danced home.
