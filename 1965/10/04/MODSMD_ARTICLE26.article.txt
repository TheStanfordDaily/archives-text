# ...And All That Jazz

For those who have neither the time nor the
money to hit the better jazz spots in San Fran
cisco, the first Stanford Jazz Year will be a wel
come innovation.
This ambitious pilot project will feature at
least six concerts during the academic year —
Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillispie and the \1 |Q
are a few of the scheduled performers—plus an
extensive lecture series, rare films from the 20's
and 30's showing the founders of jazz in their
prime, and several lectures on the history and na
ture of the evolving art form known in various
times as jazz, swing or dixieland.
And the price is minimal.
The lectures, exhibits and films will all be free,

while the concerts, shuting with Louis Arm
strong at Frost Amphitheatre this Sunday — will
have price tags of $1.50, $2.25 and $3 for Stan
ford students. Moreover, if profits are made on
these concerts, the nonprofit Stanford Jazz Year
committee will plow the money back into the
program for more intimate concerts—either in
Tresidder or hopefully out in White Plaza.
Stanlord Jazz Year, then, is an ambitious ex
periment in extending academic inquiry into a
nominally extracurricular function—jazz appre
ciation. Academies aside, anyone who does not
want to invest $1.50 into the October 31st Ella
Fitzgerald-Duke Ellington concert must be
either tone deaf, culturally deprived, or im
mune to bargains.
