## Professor Talks Turkey Bias 
### 
Editor, The Daily
It is gratifying to hear the
spokesman for ihe Alpha Omega
Chapter of Sigma Chi speak so
uncompromisingly on an im
portant moral issue. "We do not
intend," The Daily (Oct. 1) re
ports him as saying, "to compro
mise our moral position on the
question of racial discrimina
nation.
That is nobly said, even if it is
said about thirty years late. But
what is that spokesman ready
to say on the question of dis
crimination itself? It is also bad
to discriminate against "Tur
keys," The moral question in
volves discrimination itself, not
what particular party the fra
ternity is exempting from dis
crimination this year. So long as
Alpha Omega — or fraternities
generally duck that question,
they have very weak grounds
for talking about their "moral
position."
Prejudice is judgment on bias
rather than reason, on precon
ception rather thau evidence, on
feeling rather than fact. That is
virtually a definition of the rush
system. Prejudice and discrim
ination are built into that sys
tem; it is what distinguishes
fraternities from other kinds of
small living groups.
It Is shocking that this coun
try-club morality still survives
in our midst; it is even more
shocking that the Stanford Ad
ministration actively supports
it. It seems to me that if a stu
dent is good enough to get into
Stanford (and he is admitted,

insofar as possible, on rational,
not prejudicial, grounds) he is
good enough for the company of
all other students similarly ad
milled. Moreover, it seems to
me that the housing facilities of
this university should be open
to all students on a non-discrim
inatory basis (as the womens'
residences now are). If a stu
dent wants to live in Sigma Chi.
he should be able to apply to
live there, and have a fair
chance to get his choice. If he is
excluded because the members
do not like the way he looks or
dresses or shakes hands, then
they are as guilty of discrimina
tion as they would he if they
excluded him because of race,
creed, or color.
It is high time that fraterni
ties clean their houses. But they
are not likely to do so unless
they see what the problem
really is. Until then, I hope we
shall hear fewer self-congratula
tory noises about their uncom
promising "moral position" in
The Daily.

Editor, The Daily:
The following message was de
livered to the freshmen of Stern
Hall at 10:00 p.m. Wednesday
in- a group of unexpected god
desses from Branner:
"We like you freshman boys
We really do
In spite of Pre-Reg and
The ratio, too

Although fraternities
Are coooool
Oh freshmen
We'll stand by you
"We like to stop and talk
When passing through
When we go by Stern Hall
and Wilber (sic.) too
If you stop rushing us
We're through
Oh freshmen boys
We love you"
This message, which was ac
companied by a card and some
cookies obviously represents a
major policy delineation by the
frosh females, and we freshmen
at Stern Hall heartily approve.

I have become disgusted with
the juvenile behavior of a small
minority of Stanford students.
Their practice of tearing down
announcements of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
is poor sportsmanship to say the
least. The University is supposed
to be an arena for all ideas
where all viewpoints may be
heard without censorship or re
prisal. If certain people disagree
with our opinions, let them
speak openly to us and to the
rest of the community by or
ganizing, debating and putting
up their own posters instead of
resorting to childish tactics.

It is gratifying to hear the
spokesman for ihe Alpha Omega
Chapter of Sigma Chi speak so
uncompromisingly on an im
portant moral issue. "We do not
intend," The Daily (Oct. 1) re
ports him as saying, "to compro
mise our moral position on the
question of racial discrimina
nation.
That is nobly said, even if it is
said about thirty years late. But
what is that spokesman ready
to say on the question of dis
crimination itself? It is also bad
to discriminate against "Tur
keys," The moral question in
volves discrimination itself, not
what particular party the fra
ternity is exempting from dis
crimination this year. So long as
Alpha Omega — or fraternities
generally duck that question,
they have very weak grounds
for talking about their "moral
position."
Prejudice is judgment on bias
rather than reason, on precon
ception rather thau evidence, on
feeling rather than fact. That is
virtually a definition of the rush
system. Prejudice and discrim
ination are built into that sys
tem; it is what distinguishes
fraternities from other kinds of
small living groups.
It Is shocking that this coun
try-club morality still survives
in our midst; it is even more
shocking that the Stanford Ad
ministration actively supports
it. It seems to me that if a stu
dent is good enough to get into
Stanford (and he is admitted,

insofar as possible, on rational,
not prejudicial, grounds) he is
good enough for the company of
all other students similarly ad
milled. Moreover, it seems to
me that the housing facilities of
this university should be open
to all students on a non-discrim
inatory basis (as the womens'
residences now are). If a stu
dent wants to live in Sigma Chi.
he should be able to apply to
live there, and have a fair
chance to get his choice. If he is
excluded because the members
do not like the way he looks or
dresses or shakes hands, then
they are as guilty of discrimina
tion as they would he if they
excluded him because of race,
creed, or color.
It is high time that fraterni
ties clean their houses. But they
are not likely to do so unless
they see what the problem
really is. Until then, I hope we
shall hear fewer self-congratula
tory noises about their uncom
promising "moral position" in
The Daily.
