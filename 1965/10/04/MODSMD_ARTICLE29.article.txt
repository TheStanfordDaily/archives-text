## Bill Signing At LBJ's-A White House Ceremony 
### Art Buchwald 
President Johnson has been so pleased with the way Congress]
has been passing his legislation lately that he has made a greafc
ceremony out of the signing of the bilis. Not only are Congressmen
and Senators and the press invited to bill-signing ceremonies, but!
telegrams are sent out all over the country asking interested citi- â– 

Zens to come to Washington to
see a bill signed.
I met a friend of mine from
California the other day who
had been invited to the White
House for just such an occasion
and he seemed rather sad. I
asked him what the trouble was.
Mass Pedestrian Bill
"I was minding my own busi
ness," ho said, "when I got this
telegram from the White House
telling me I was invited to
watch the President sign the
mass pedestrian bill. I wasn't
going to pay any attention to it,
but my wife said. 'You have to
go.'
"I said. 'Why?'
" 'Because if you don't,' she
said, 'he'll think you're against
his policy in Viet Nam. Arthur
Miller turned down his invita
tion to watch him sign the arts
bill because of Viet Nam, and
Miller's been getting criticized
for it ever since.'
" 'Why can't 1 wire the Presi
dent and tell him I support his
policy in Viet Nam, but I don't,
like his mass pedestrian bill?'
Another Robert Lowell
" 'Because when you get in
vited to the White House you
have to go. You don't w r ant to
be known as another Robert
Lowell.'
"So she went out and bought
a $500 suit for the bill signing
and I bought $-100 worth of air
plane tickets and three people
gave us bon voyage parties, and
we left everything behind to
come to Washington fox' this
great event.
"We were told to report to
the Northwest Gate where about
100 people were waiting with
telegrams in their hands. All of
the wives had on new $500. suits
and all the husbands were mut
tering about being away from

their offices.
"Finally they took us into the
garden where there must have
been .300 newspapermen and 50
cameras and we all
stood around talking about
what a fink Arthur Miller was
and how nice it was for the
President to invite us to watch
him sign a bill.
No (bailee To See
"Then the President walked
out, but I didn't get a chance to
see him because all the photo
graphers were around him tak
ing pictures of him shaking
Senators. He made a short
speech about the wonders of
mass pedestrianism and then he
went over to a small table and
signed the bill with a bunch of
pens which he gave away to the
press."
"What happened next?"
"They took us back out the
Northwest Gate and the guard
thanked us for coming."
"It sounds pretty moving to
me," I said.
"You know something," he
said. "I think Arthur Miller was
using Viet Nam as an excuse.
He was just trying to save him
self a thousand bucks."
"Did you tell this to your
wife?"
"Yeah, but she said I was a
sorehead, she said. You didn't
like the changing of the guard
at Buckingham Palace either.' "
