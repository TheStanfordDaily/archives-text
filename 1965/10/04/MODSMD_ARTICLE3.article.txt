### BARBARA MOORE 
If Auni Minnie visits Stanford this quarter hoping for tin?
traditional view of red tile roofs, she will be disappointed. Hoover
Tower's observation deck is closed.
Two suicides off the tower in the last nine months have caused
the closing of the observation deck while safety studies are being

made. Philosophy graduate stu
dent Stanley Theodore Horwitz
jumped to his death in January
from the 285-foot tower. The sec
ond suicide was an 83-year-old
Palo Alto man this summer.
After (lie first suicide, no one
was allowed up in the lower
alone. A telephone was installed
at the top of the tower to se
cure help in emergencies.
After the second suicide, the
observation deck was closed.
Studies were initialed to mea
sure the public relations value of
the observation facilities.
Functions Weighed
The function of Hoover Tower
as a library is being weighed
against its attraction for Stan
ford visitors. Lylc Nelson, head
of University Relations, states
that, many letters have been re
ceived with safety proposals and
requests that the observation
deck remain open.
Safety proposals being studied
by the University Relations Of
fice include cell-like metal bars
and plate glass. Objections to
these proposals are that bars
would cut off the view and that
plate glass such as in Berkeley's
Coil Tower, is difficult to keep
clean.
A third plyn being studied is

to allow guided groups of par
ents or organizations to visit the
observation deck.
