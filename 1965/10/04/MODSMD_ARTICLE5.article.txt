"HUELGA! HUELGA!" — As an intrepid Daily reporter looks
on, striking Son Joaquin Valley grape pickers, standing on a
car, yell "Huelga!" ("Strike!") over the vines to workers who
are still in the field. Six Stanford students, including members
of Stanford Friends of SNCC, traveled to the strike area over
the weekend to observe activities of the farm labor workers.
Friends of SNCC will be raising money and collecting food for
the strikers at various locations on campus during the week.
