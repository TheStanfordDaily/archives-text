The Legislature will hold its iirst session of the year Thursday
evening, according to Jay Kadane, LASSU Speaker.
Upperclass residences desiring representation at the meeting
must elect delegates before Thursday, he said.
Business for the evening will include voting on the judicial
——— resolution accepted last week by

the Committee of Fifteen, intro
duction of the bylaws changes
related to the resolution, and
probably the presentation for
the Legislature's confirmation of
the speaker's appointments to
the Rules Committee.
Kadane emphasized the im
portance of filling all the seats
in the Legislature. He urged
prompt election of members
"who are representative, so that
the individual living group is
well represented and so that
LASSU as a whole will be rep
resentative of ihe student body.
Members should be articulate,
and willing to attend LASSU
meetings and to do committee
work," Kadane stated.
LASSU has five standing com
mittees: Rules, Judicial. Fi
nance, and Student Affairs. In
addition, temporary committees
are appointed when specific is
sues arise.
Kadane plans to have his rec
ommendations [or members of
the Rules Committee prepared

this week. If approved, the Com
mittee would begin work im
mediately to interview prospec
tive members of the other stand
ing committees. The Rules Com
mittee appoints members of the
other standing committees.
The Legislature lias a poten
tial membership of 150 and
meets by law every second
Thursday, although business in
the last few years has been
heavy enough to warrant
weekly meetings. Kadane plans
to speed up LASSU procdure
to prevent any of the post-mid
night sessions common last
yea r.
