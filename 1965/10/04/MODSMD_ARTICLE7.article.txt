## Profs Picket LBJ's Policy 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
A group of more than KX)
Stanford professors picketed tlie
President of the United States
when h<* visited San Francisco
in late June.
Critical of the Administra

tion's foreign policy, the Stan
lord Committee for Peace took a
half page ad in the Chronicle ex
plaining the reasoning behind
the demonstrations. The state
ment, drafted by Professor Hu
bert Marshall of the Political Sci
ence Department, said:
"Impugned & Disregarded"
"Other means of reaching the
President have failed and Admin
istration spokesmen have not
only disregarded informed aca
demic critics but have impugned
their motives and questioned
their sense of the rbalities of the
situation in which we find our
selves.
"In our view it is the foreign
policy of the present Adminis
tration that is unrealistic and
headed for certain disaster."
Marshall, who conceived the
idea of picketing the President,
said that his idea was spontane
ous and had been occasioned by
the unique opportunity of the
President's visit to San Frauds
co to celebrate tho anniversary
of the United Nations.
"Bent over Backwards"
The professors "bent over
backwards to picket the Presi
dent in a most respectful man
ner.'' Marshall said. "We regard
him ;is our friend, and most of
us voted for him in the last elec-
I ion."
Traditionally, the Stanford
laeullx lias been omooli'iit, and

regarded as apolitical by the
community." "After all, we are
in the shadow of Hoover Tower,"
Marshall observed. Accordingly
he believed that the actions of
the Committee would have more
effect both on the President and
upon the thinking of the com
mit nity.
The intellectual breeding
ground for the protest was a
series of informal luncheon meet
ings of several faculty members.
The group, including Charles
Drekemeicr. Christain Bay, Kar
el de Leeuw, and Charles Stein,
discussed various problems con
cerning foreign policy and other
issues.
Five Days Before
Five days before tlie Presi
dent's visit. Marshall brought his
plan to the groups with a copy
of the statement he had drafted.
The professors were enthusiastic
and began soliciting signatures
for the protest statement and
funds for the advertisement. Ini
tially Marshall had expected to
got only 13 or 2<) signatures in
such a short time. The final
statement listed 120 signatures.
Those who signed the protest
committed themselves to picket
ing the President in front of the
San Francisco Opera House.
Marshall stressed that the
committee had been formed on
the spur of Ihe moment and was
"a «»ne shot affair." The croup

had no formal organization,
though the names of Charles
Drekmeir and Karel dcLeeuw
appeared in the Chronicle as co
chairmen. A chairman was re
quired before the Chronicle
would accept the ad.
"Count more"
"Academic opinion counts
more with the White House,"
Marshall told Tlic Daily. The ma
jority of the professors opposed
the Administration policy be
cause the present South Vietna
mese government does not have
"a stamp of legitimacy." Citing
Hans Morgenthau, Marshall
called it"the wrong war in the
wrong place at the* wrong time."
Asked if there had been any
reaction from Ihe office of the
President of the University or
from the alumni Marshall said
that neither source had com
mented on the professors' activi
ties.

the demonstrations. The state
ment, drafted by Professor Hu
bert Marshall of the Political Sci
ence Department, said:
"Impugned & Disregarded"
"Other means of reaching the
President have failed and Admin
istration spokesmen have not
only disregarded informed aca
demic critics but have impugned
their motives and questioned
their sense of the rbalities of the
situation in which we find our
selves.
"In our view it is the foreign
policy of the present Adminis
tration that is unrealistic and
headed for certain disaster."
Marshall, who conceived the
idea of picketing the President,
said that his idea was spontane
ous and had been occasioned by
the unique opportunity of the
President's visit to San Frauds
co to celebrate tho anniversary
of the United Nations.
"Bent over Backwards"
The professors "bent over
backwards to picket the Presi
dent in a most respectful man
ner.'' Marshall said. "We regard
him ;is our friend, and most of
us voted for him in the last elec-
I ion."
Traditionally, the Stanford
laeullx lias been omooli'iit, and

regarded as apolitical by the
community." "After all, we are
in the shadow of Hoover Tower,"
Marshall observed. Accordingly
he believed that the actions of
the Committee would have more
effect both on the President and
upon the thinking of the com
mit nity.
The intellectual breeding
ground for the protest was a
series of informal luncheon meet
ings of several faculty members.
The group, including Charles
Drekemeicr. Christain Bay, Kar
el de Leeuw, and Charles Stein,
discussed various problems con
cerning foreign policy and other
issues.
Five Days Before
Five days before tlie Presi
dent's visit. Marshall brought his
plan to the groups with a copy
of the statement he had drafted.
The professors were enthusiastic
and began soliciting signatures
for the protest statement and
funds for the advertisement. Ini
tially Marshall had expected to
got only 13 or 2<) signatures in
such a short time. The final
statement listed 120 signatures.
Those who signed the protest
committed themselves to picket
ing the President in front of the
San Francisco Opera House.
Marshall stressed that the
committee had been formed on
the spur of Ihe moment and was
"a «»ne shot affair." The croup

had no formal organization,
though the names of Charles
Drekmeir and Karel dcLeeuw
appeared in the Chronicle as co
chairmen. A chairman was re
quired before the Chronicle
would accept the ad.
"Count more"
"Academic opinion counts
more with the White House,"
Marshall told Tlic Daily. The ma
jority of the professors opposed
the Administration policy be
cause the present South Vietna
mese government does not have
"a stamp of legitimacy." Citing
Hans Morgenthau, Marshall
called it"the wrong war in the
wrong place at the* wrong time."
Asked if there had been any
reaction from Ihe office of the
President of the University or
from the alumni Marshall said
that neither source had com
mented on the professors' activi
ties.
