His body was discovered at
3:59 p.m. at the foot of an eight
story inside stairwell in Abrams
House, one of the liitrh-rise

apartment complexes in Escon
dido Village.
According to police, scuff
marks on the fifth floor landing
indicate that Gezahegne began
his jump at that point.
Gazahegne, who was rooming
at Crothers Memorial Hall, left
a suicide note.

The note was found by Sertzu
Ghebremeskel, a friend of Geza
hegne's, who look it to Mrs.
Gertrude Williams; associate ad
viser for foreign students at the
International Center. Mrs. Wil
liams called the Stanford Police.
The note, which was concerned
with burial and financial ar
rangements, gave no clue to the
reason Gezahegne may have
.lumped.
William Louis, director of
Crothers Hall, said that Geza
hegne had been undergoing
psychiatric counseling, and
friends reported that he had
been feeling very depressed.
Mrs. Williams, Gesahegne's
adviser, said she knew of no
reason he may have had to com
mit suicide.
Mrs. Karen Tustin, a resident
of Abrams House, found Gcza
heg ne's body when she stepped
inside the stairwell. She called
her husband, who called the
police.
Following California law, the
body was not moved, and con
sequently not identified until a
representative from the Coron

At about the same time as the
body was being identified Mrs.
Williams called from the Inter
national Center to report the
suicide note.
An autopsy is planned by the
Coroner's office. Gezahegne's
body will then be returned to
Etheopia, according to the in
