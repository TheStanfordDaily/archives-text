"The Kennedy Assassination
and the American Public: Social
Communication in Crisis" was
published last week by the Uni
versity Press as an integrated
collection of social science re
search about the Kennedy assas
sination, how people reacted and
how the flow of information
shaped the response.
The book is edited by Edwin
Parker, associate professor of
communication at St a nfo r d,
and Bradley Greenberg, who
holds a similar position at Mich
igan Stale.
The national tide of grief,
shock and anger that rolled
over- tiie country varied only in
intensity from rich to poor,
well-to poorly-educated, child to
adult, and from Republican to
Democrat, the book shows.
The most common reactions
were sorrow for Mrs. Kennedy
and the children, sorrow that
such a vital young man could
be killed at the height of his
powers, shame that such a thing
could happen in America, sad
ness at the loss of someone well
known and dear, and anger that
someone could have done such
a deed.
