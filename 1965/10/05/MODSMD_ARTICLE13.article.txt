# Blunt Injured; Surgery Soon
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Stanford's football hopes look
dim indeed. Not only are the
Indians hosting one of the
toughest. toams on the coast,
! Oregon, this Saturday but they

are going to bo without the serv
ices of Halfback Bob Blunt and
Linebacker Olenn Myers, both
injured in the Air Force game.
Myers who lias been a de
fensive standout all season at
linebacker received an injury to
his shoulder in the first half.
Blunt was injured late in the
ball game on a line smash.
Against Air Force Blunt had
carried the ball 10 times and
gained 61 yards. The injury to
his knee tore a cartilage and
ligaments. He will be operated
on today.
Myers Set for Rest
Rest and treatment are in
store for Myers' dislocated
shoulder. He will undoubtedly
miss the next two or three bail
games.
Phil Humphreys, who re
placed Blunt after being hurt
in last Saturday's game, or Tom
Broadhead, a transfer from
Menlo College, are in line to fill
in at the halfback position. Mike
Pavko will replace Myers at
linebacker.
Blunt, a junior, was primed
for an outstanding season. Not.
only did he have the speed and
balance that makes a good run
ner but he was also a fine re
ceiver. In two games he had
caught eight passes for 263
yards. He had scored two touch
downs, one in the Air Force
game.
Myers Top On Defense
A two-year letterman and a
senior, Myers was definitely one
of the best defensive players on
the team. He played an out
standing defensive game in the
tie against Navy.
Stanford had previously lost
the services of All-American
candidate Gary Pettigrew who
also sustained an injury to his
knee in the Navy game.

GLENN MYERS who sustained a dislocated shoulder in Stan
ford's 17-16 victory against Air Force will be out of action lor
two or three games. Bob Blunt, also injured in the Falcon
game, will be out for the rest of the season.
