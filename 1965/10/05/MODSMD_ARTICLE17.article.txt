Few old-timers so much as blinked an eye
the other day when Dean of Undergraduate Edu
cation Robert Wert announced the time has come
for some changes in the Stanford liquor policy.
If they did not ignore the statement, they
dismissed it as strategic maneuvering or adminis
trative jargon signifying ennui in inner quad.
But no one could assert that genuine changes
lay ahead. For the old-timers it was merely the
recurrence of a well-worn issue, and skepticism
was in order.
The only bright side of Dean Wert's state
ment was a Suggestion that "students be very
much involved in the preparations of recommen
dations" for possible changes. Even this was no
cause for jubilation, but it did indicate a change
in University attitude.
In May of 2 8.8. (that is, in 1962, two years
Before Berkeley) when the same issue reared
its persistent head, President Sterling assigned
two committees to study the problem: The Com
mittee on Student Affairs and Services and the
Committee on University Policy, both faculty
committees.
Although students may now be asked for
their opinion, this does not mean the Board of
Trustees will pay much attention. In a 1962
referendum students voted four to one in favor
of making the "use of intoxicating liquors by
Stanford students in accordance with California
state law."
Two months later the Board of Trustees re

all'irmed the "long-standing policy prohibiting
(ho possession and uso of alcoholic beverages by
students on llie University campus."
And the long-standing policy still stands
despile a series of attempts to undermine it.
Several committees including the Associated
Students Cabinet in 1958 and a Student-Faculty
committee in 1960, after all reached essentially
the same conclusion the practice on campus
should hi- made consistent with state law'.
In an interview with the Daily in April, 1962,
former Dean of Men William G. Craig called a
liquor petition being passed around by students
"timely," <the same word was used by Dean
Wert.) He said that the existing regulations at
Stanford were "unrealistic and unenforceable."
This situation has not changed, and, in fact,
certain developments have made the regulations
harder to justify.
Willi the opening of the faculty clubhouse
and its 330 individual compartments, only the
most tight-lipped faculty member can now say
with a straight face that there is no Liquor on
the Stanford campus.
Moreover, nearly half of the University un
dergraduates, (generally sophomores) study at
one of five overseas campuses, where there are
Stanford-run bars serving beer and wine.
Finally, the very hypocrisy of the situation
itseli, the existence of a regulation that is gen
erally ignored and never enforced, has not de
creased. Given the state law, perhaps some form
of hypocrisy is inevitable.
The moment is no longer "timely" for some
change in the liquor policy; it is long overdue.

The only bright side of Dean Wert's state
ment was a Suggestion that "students be very
much involved in the preparations of recommen
dations" for possible changes. Even this was no
cause for jubilation, but it did indicate a change
in University attitude.
In May of 2 8.8. (that is, in 1962, two years
Before Berkeley) when the same issue reared
its persistent head, President Sterling assigned
two committees to study the problem: The Com
mittee on Student Affairs and Services and the
Committee on University Policy, both faculty
committees.
Although students may now be asked for
their opinion, this does not mean the Board of
Trustees will pay much attention. In a 1962
referendum students voted four to one in favor
of making the "use of intoxicating liquors by
Stanford students in accordance with California
state law."
Two months later the Board of Trustees re

all'irmed the "long-standing policy prohibiting
(ho possession and uso of alcoholic beverages by
students on llie University campus."
And the long-standing policy still stands
despile a series of attempts to undermine it.

Students Cabinet in 1958 and a Student-Faculty
committee in 1960, after all reached essentially
the same conclusion the practice on campus

In an interview with the Daily in April, 1962,
former Dean of Men William G. Craig called a
liquor petition being passed around by students
"timely," <the same word was used by Dean
Wert.) He said that the existing regulations at
Stanford were "unrealistic and unenforceable."
This situation has not changed, and, in fact,
certain developments have made the regulations
harder to justify.
Willi the opening of the faculty clubhouse
and its 330 individual compartments, only the
most tight-lipped faculty member can now say
with a straight face that there is no Liquor on
the Stanford campus.
Moreover, nearly half of the University un
dergraduates, (generally sophomores) study at
one of five overseas campuses, where there are
Stanford-run bars serving beer and wine.
Finally, the very hypocrisy of the situation
itseli, the existence of a regulation that is gen
erally ignored and never enforced, has not de
creased. Given the state law, perhaps some form
of hypocrisy is inevitable.
The moment is no longer "timely" for some
change in the liquor policy; it is long overdue.
Few old-timers so much as blinked an eye
the other day when Dean of Undergraduate Edu
cation Robert Wert announced the time has come
for some changes in the Stanford liquor policy.
If they did not ignore the statement, they
dismissed it as strategic maneuvering or adminis
trative jargon signifying ennui in inner quad.
But no one could assert that genuine changes
lay ahead. For the old-timers it was merely the
recurrence of a well-worn issue, and skepticism
was in order.
