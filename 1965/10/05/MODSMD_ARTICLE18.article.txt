# SYMBOLS VS. SUBSTANCE
## Congress And Civil Rights 
### Bob Piekus 
This summer brought another
barrage of activity in the South,
and Congress passed another civ
il rights bill. Again Americans
congratulated themselves for
moving their representatives to
act. this time to guarantee the
right to vote for all citizens.
Yet were the American people
disposed to closer scrutiny of
the action in Washington, they
might appreciate the fact that,
at least in the viti&l civil rights
area, Congress seems more in
terested in symbols than in sub
stance.
The Voting Rights Hill
The voting rights bill itself is
not the great mover it is pur
ported to be. That it is needed at.
all, when the Fourteenth Amend
ment enacted the very same
principle nearly a century ago,
is an indication that the legisla
tive word is not necessarily the
political reality. Bui more than
that, there is the contrast be
tween image and fact. There is
first the image presented by the
President of a renewal of Lex
ington and Concord, and that of
fered by the press of Negroes
throughout the South being reg
istered by the thousands before
smiling federal registrars. Then,
somewhat hidden from view,
there is the fact; the fact, for
example, that Mississippi was
supplied with .just four regis
trars for its 82 counties - and
the facts of potential economic
reprisal and physical violence
facing the Negro attempting to
register.
Yet it is true that scores of
hundreds of Negroes will regis
ter as a result of the bill, and
that it does reaffirm some de
gree of determination on the
part of the nation to live up to
the dictates of its collective con
science.
However, the observer who al
lows this bill to represent for
him, as it does for most Ameri
cans, the sum of Congressional
decision in civil rights this sum
mer makes a serious mistake.

For it was in other less-publi
cized actions that the President,
t he Senate and the House of Rep
resentatives clearly demonstra
ted that the sincerity of their
civil rights commitment is de
batable.
The Congressional Challenge
The Fourteenth Amendment
provides that when the voting
right is illegally denied citizens,
the state so doing shall have its
Congressional representation re
duced accordingly. On January
1. opening day of the present ses
sion, the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party asked Con
gress to unseat the Mississippi
delegation to the House. That
body responded by seating the
Mississippians, by vote of 276-
119. Yet the MFDP saw some
reason for hope.
The MFDP brought lawyers
from all over the nation to Mis
sissippi to take formal deposi
tions from hundreds of Negroes
denied the vote. These deposi
tions, it was thought, would dem
onstrate for the remainder of the
House the acts of reprisal and
courthouse discrimination by
which the state excludes its Neg
ro citizens from the voting rolls.
But the Freedom Democratic
Party proved to have misread
the facts of Washington politics.
The Congress toyed with the is
sue until September 17. On that
date, on the recommendation of
a sub-committee dominated by
southerners, the full House dis
missed the Challenge. There
were only 146 who voted against
the representatives from the
Magnolia State; the others voted
against the Constitution, instead.
So ended what Dr. Martin Lu
ther King had called "the test of
the moral integrity of the Con
gress of the United States." Dr.
King understands, as so many
apparently do not, that without
the type of action that strikes
at the seat of southern power it
self, measures such as the voting
bill mean painfully less than
otherwise thev might.

No court other than the Su
preme Court itself is more im
portant for civil rights cases
than the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals, headquartered in New
Orleans. Earlier this year, Sen
ators Kuchel, Javitts, Allot t and
Scott joined other leaders in call
ing upon the President to fill
the vacancy existing in that
body. Their statement, read into
the Congressional Record, urged
that "above all, the President
should recommend an individual
whose record clearly shows that
lie will uphold the constitutional
rights of citizens."
Then, on July 26. the Senate
voted 76-8 to confirm the Presi
dent's appointment of ex-Gover
nor J. P. Coleman (Mississippi)
to the sth Circuit Court. The for
mer Governor has compiled per
haps the most impressive racist
credentials in the nation. One
Congressman has termed him
"the thinking man's segregation
ist," for in addition to his out
spoken racism, he designed the
masterful legal framework of
Mississippi segregation. If the
President sought a man "whose
record clearly shows that lie will
uphold the constitutional rights
of citizens," he could not have
made a poorer choice.
What of the Senators who
stated officially that they did
seek such an individual? Of the
four, only Senator Javitts voted
against confirmation. Why did
the others sign a statement
whose words were not to be hon
ored? Perhaps it was merely
symbolic.
Of Symbols and Substautoe
It appears, then, that Congress
is more concerned with the sym
bols of civil rights advocacy then
the substance of racial equality.
But the men in Washington do
not operate in a vacuum. They
must be at least mildly respon
sive to those back home in order
to survive.
This suggests that we as a na
tion still find it rather easy to
satisfy our collective conscience
with half-hearted gestures of ra

eial good will. No doubt many
Americans support the civil
rights cause. But most of these
people also support, through the
silence bred by ignorance, what
the Congress is doing to substi
tute civil rights symbols for sub
stance.
How long can we, in good
faith, permit ourselves to do
both ?

The MFDP brought lawyers
from all over the nation to Mis

denied the vote. These deposi

the facts of Washington politics.
The Congress toyed with the is

a sub-committee dominated by

No court other than the Su

ing upon the President to fill
the vacancy existing in that
body. Their statement, read into
the Congressional Record, urged
that "above all, the President
should recommend an individual
whose record clearly shows that
lie will uphold the constitutional
rights of citizens."
Then, on July 26. the Senate
voted 76-8 to confirm the Presi

to the sth Circuit Court. The for
mer Governor has compiled per
haps the most impressive racist
credentials in the nation. One
Congressman has termed him
"the thinking man's segregation
ist," for in addition to his out
spoken racism, he designed the
masterful legal framework of
Mississippi segregation. If the
President sought a man "whose
record clearly shows that lie will
uphold the constitutional rights
of citizens," he could not have
made a poorer choice.
What of the Senators who
stated officially that they did

It appears, then, that Congress

to survive.
This suggests that we as a na

satisfy our collective conscience
with half-hearted gestures of ra

Americans support the civil

throughout the South being reg

smiling federal registrars. Then,
somewhat hidden from view,
there is the fact; the fact, for
example, that Mississippi was
supplied with .just four regis

the facts of potential economic
reprisal and physical violence
facing the Negro attempting to
register.
Yet it is true that scores of
hundreds of Negroes will regis

that it does reaffirm some de

the dictates of its collective con

It appears, then, that Congress
is more concerned with the sym

the substance of racial equality.
But the men in Washington do
not operate in a vacuum. They
must be at least mildly respon

to survive.
This suggests that we as a na

satisfy our collective conscience
with half-hearted gestures of ra

Americans support the civil

How long can we, in good

This summer brought another
barrage of activity in the South,
and Congress passed another civ
il rights bill. Again Americans
congratulated themselves for
moving their representatives to
act. this time to guarantee the
right to vote for all citizens.
Yet were the American people
disposed to closer scrutiny of
the action in Washington, they
might appreciate the fact that,
at least in the viti&l civil rights
area, Congress seems more in
terested in symbols than in sub
stance.
The Voting Rights Hill
The voting rights bill itself is
not the great mover it is pur
ported to be. That it is needed at.
all, when the Fourteenth Amend
ment enacted the very same
principle nearly a century ago,
is an indication that the legisla
tive word is not necessarily the
political reality. Bui more than
that, there is the contrast be
tween image and fact. There is
first the image presented by the
President of a renewal of Lex
ington and Concord, and that of
fered by the press of Negroes
throughout the South being reg
istered by the thousands before
smiling federal registrars. Then,
somewhat hidden from view,
there is the fact; the fact, for
example, that Mississippi was
supplied with .just four regis
trars for its 82 counties - and
the facts of potential economic
reprisal and physical violence
facing the Negro attempting to
register.
Yet it is true that scores of
hundreds of Negroes will regis
ter as a result of the bill, and
that it does reaffirm some de
gree of determination on the
part of the nation to live up to
the dictates of its collective con
science.
However, the observer who al
lows this bill to represent for
him, as it does for most Ameri
cans, the sum of Congressional
decision in civil rights this sum
mer makes a serious mistake.

For it was in other less-publi
cized actions that the President,
t he Senate and the House of Rep
resentatives clearly demonstra
ted that the sincerity of their
civil rights commitment is de
batable.
The Congressional Challenge
The Fourteenth Amendment
provides that when the voting
right is illegally denied citizens,
the state so doing shall have its
Congressional representation re
duced accordingly. On January
1. opening day of the present ses
sion, the Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party asked Con
gress to unseat the Mississippi
delegation to the House. That
body responded by seating the
Mississippians, by vote of 276-
119. Yet the MFDP saw some
reason for hope.
The MFDP brought lawyers
from all over the nation to Mis
sissippi to take formal deposi
tions from hundreds of Negroes
denied the vote. These deposi
tions, it was thought, would dem
onstrate for the remainder of the
House the acts of reprisal and
courthouse discrimination by
which the state excludes its Neg
ro citizens from the voting rolls.
But the Freedom Democratic
Party proved to have misread
the facts of Washington politics.
The Congress toyed with the is
sue until September 17. On that
date, on the recommendation of
a sub-committee dominated by
southerners, the full House dis
missed the Challenge. There
were only 146 who voted against
the representatives from the
Magnolia State; the others voted
against the Constitution, instead.
So ended what Dr. Martin Lu
ther King had called "the test of
the moral integrity of the Con
gress of the United States." Dr.
King understands, as so many
apparently do not, that without
the type of action that strikes
at the seat of southern power it
self, measures such as the voting
bill mean painfully less than
otherwise thev might.

No court other than the Su
preme Court itself is more im
portant for civil rights cases
than the Fifth Circuit Court of
Appeals, headquartered in New
Orleans. Earlier this year, Sen
ators Kuchel, Javitts, Allot t and
Scott joined other leaders in call
ing upon the President to fill
the vacancy existing in that
body. Their statement, read into
the Congressional Record, urged
that "above all, the President
should recommend an individual
whose record clearly shows that
lie will uphold the constitutional
rights of citizens."
Then, on July 26. the Senate
voted 76-8 to confirm the Presi
dent's appointment of ex-Gover
nor J. P. Coleman (Mississippi)
to the sth Circuit Court. The for
mer Governor has compiled per
haps the most impressive racist
credentials in the nation. One
Congressman has termed him
"the thinking man's segregation
ist," for in addition to his out
spoken racism, he designed the
masterful legal framework of
Mississippi segregation. If the
President sought a man "whose
record clearly shows that lie will
uphold the constitutional rights
of citizens," he could not have
made a poorer choice.
What of the Senators who
stated officially that they did
seek such an individual? Of the
