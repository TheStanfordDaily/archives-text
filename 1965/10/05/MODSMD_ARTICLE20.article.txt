## Fun Stan And The IFC 
### 
Editor, The Daily
For tho past week or so I
have been making inquiries as
to the whereabouts of my
spring quarter exams, just for
the idle curiosity and because
I would like to reread one spec
ific essay I wrote, and have re
ceived only blank expressions
and shrugged shoulders for
answers. Not only could T not
find my own exams, but the
exams of entire classes, some
consisting of 150 to 250 students,
were strangely "lost."
Tradition has i1 that the
spring quarter examinations can
be found in the appropriate
boxes the following fall. Stan
ford has fasl been losing many
of its cherished traditions, and
this one too, I'm afraid, has
gone out the window. Now ugly
rumor explains how these blue
books are sorted ;uui put to
good use over the summer
months by nylon-jacketed stu
dents lost somewhere under the
loose hierarchy of the IFC.

Without making any specific
charges, 1 would like to do some
public wondering. 1 can remem
ber some time ago attending
various rush parties at the Stan
ford Fraternities, and along
with the talk and tour of the
house, being escorted by some
proud brother to a wall chart
listing Iho fantastic grade
[joint averages of the members
and headed by the house aver
age in huge numbers, usually
encircled by gold stars and se
quins.
If this is the case, I wonder
why these brilliant students
don't contribute their own end
quarter masterpieces to the
files.
And more to the point, I won
der about the effectiveness or
even relevance of the good old
Fun. Stan. This nebulous code
has reached a position current
ly held by the Ten Command
ments (no, I am not a religious
fanatic): few know or care just
what the exact words are, as
long as, you know, the spirit is
there. And then of course, the
consequences are similarly
vague if perchance you discover
a rule rigid enough to break.
Who indeed at Stanford would
rat on a buddy, or rat on any
body, as far as that goes. And
besides, we're all smart. We
don't need to cheat or steal
exams. We're here, aren't we?
Hell, that makes us just about
the best there is. Just once, I
would like to sec. or even just
hear of, someone tossed out on
his ear for petty theft or van
dalism or cheating. Or at least,
in the spirit of the Fun. Stan,
here at the Country Club, given
a severe talking to.
