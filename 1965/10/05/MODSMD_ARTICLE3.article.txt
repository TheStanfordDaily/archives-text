# STANFORD PROF OBSERVES
## Long-Range Problems In Viet Nam 
### BOB EGELKO 
Behind the lines in Viet Nam,
a beleaguered Saigon govern
ment is struggling with its grav
est long-range problem, the an
tiquated agricultural economy.
For any progress toward
stability, electric power, factor
ies, roads — in short, native
born, trained engineers — are
needed. But they will not be
available unless engineering
educational facilities are greatly
and quickly expanded, Prof.
Ralph J. Smith, just back from
a six-week survey in South Viet
Nam, warned.
Prof. Smith, associate execu
tive head of Stanford's Electric
al Engineering Department,
went to Saigon along with three
other engineering educators at
the request of Tran Ngoc Ninh,
minister of education. The trip
was sponsored by the Agency
for International Development.
Their job was to survey the
country and its needs in terms
of engineering education.
Only One School
Prof. Smith found only one
engineering school in South
Viet Nam, the National Techni
cal Center in Saigon, and that
one. he told The Daily, "is not
training nearly enough engin
eers for the country's needs.
"The school has set up very
strict requirements," he explain
ed. "so that only about 25 peo
ple in each category — civil,
electrical, and mechanical are
admitted each year.
"After four years just 65 or
70 engineers will graduate.
That's not even enough to re
place the men who retire or are
drafted."
Enlarge School
Prof. Smith has recommended

that the Saigon school be en
larged and others built, raising
the number of graduates each
year to at least 1000. Efforts are
to he concentrated-on education
at the bachelor's level, in the
interest of quantity.
Programs in chemical and in
dustrial engineering are also
needed, he stated.
Prof. Smith emphasized the
immediacy of the need for "ac
celeration and expansion" of the
engineering instruction pro
gram. "The present conflict
does not require the country to
come to a stop," he declared.
"Unless these measures are
taken to help the economy
and that would mean about two
years to expand and four more
years for the first graduates -
the Viet Cong can be beaten

without anything being solved."
Agricultural Society
What needs to be solved is
the problem of a society in
which more than 83 per cent of
the people work in agriculture
and all but a small fraction of
the rest for the government.
The proposed changes are not
meant to industrialize the entire
South Vietnamese economy, said
Prof. Smith, but "just to make
use of the available resources
to a much greater extent than
is being done."
South Vietnamese engineers
face problems other than the
manpower shortage, Prof. Smith
continued. "There are new hy
dro-electric power plants in the
highlands," he explained, "but
between the power plants and
the industrial centers is land

hold by the Viet. Cong. If trans
mission lines were laid they
would be easy to ent."
MA's For Select Vietnamese
Should the recommendations
be adopted ("and Prof. Smith re
marked, "From past experience
I don't believe they would have
requested our help had they not
intended to use it.") the United
States, through the Agency for
Into r n a t i onal Development,
would educate selected South
Vietnamese students to the mas
ter's level, to serve as badly
needed teachers.
In addition, another group of
five to ten Americans would be
sent, to the National Technical
Center for an extended period
to develop detailed plans for ex
pansion.
Along these lines, Frol'. Smith

described an undergraduate se
quence in the School of Engin
eering beginning this quarter en
titled "Resources Strategy." The
subject of tiiis program, he said,
is to be "the application of en
gineering to newly developing
nations."

"It was initiated," lie explain
ed, "for those undergraduates
who do not want to start build
ing missiles or designing for
some large company after they
graduate. They will bo able to
go into an emerging country
such as South Viet Nam, ana
lyze the needs and resources,
and find the best plan of de
velopment.
"In this way we can use en
gineering principles to solve
human problems."

the problem of a society in

Prof. Smith, but "just to make

continued. "There are new hy

the problem of a society in
which more than 83 per cent of
the people work in agriculture
and all but a small fraction of
the rest for the government.
The proposed changes are not
meant to industrialize the entire
South Vietnamese economy, said
Prof. Smith, but "just to make
use of the available resources
to a much greater extent than
is being done."
South Vietnamese engineers
face problems other than the
manpower shortage, Prof. Smith
continued. "There are new hy
dro-electric power plants in the
highlands," he explained, "but
between the power plants and
the industrial centers is land

hold by the Viet. Cong. If trans
mission lines were laid they
would be easy to ent."
MA's For Select Vietnamese
Should the recommendations
be adopted ("and Prof. Smith re
marked, "From past experience
I don't believe they would have
requested our help had they not
intended to use it.") the United
States, through the Agency for
Into r n a t i onal Development,
would educate selected South
Vietnamese students to the mas
ter's level, to serve as badly
needed teachers.
In addition, another group of
five to ten Americans would be
sent, to the National Technical
Center for an extended period
to develop detailed plans for ex
pansion.
Along these lines, Frol'. Smith

described an undergraduate se
quence in the School of Engin
eering beginning this quarter en
titled "Resources Strategy." The
subject of tiiis program, he said,
is to be "the application of en
gineering to newly developing
nations."
Missilr Building
"It was initiated," lie explain
ed, "for those undergraduates
who do not want to start build
ing missiles or designing for
some large company after they
graduate. They will bo able to
go into an emerging country
such as South Viet Nam, ana
lyze the needs and resources,
and find the best plan of de
velopment.
"In this way we can use en
gineering principles to solve
human problems."
