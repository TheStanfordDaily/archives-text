# FAMILIAR FROSH MALADY
## The 						Girl I Left Behind Me 
### TOM BOWEN Sex Editor (First of a Series 
Despite numerous official and un
official reports 1o the contrary, one of
the primary reasons men come to Stan
ford is to pursue members of the opposite
sex, be they Stanford Dollies, other local
school girls, or even the world renowned
Girl Back Home.
Perhaps (he first of these lovelies to
afflict any Stanford male, and in particu
lar the Freshman male, is the Girl Back
Home. Her likeness is displayed on the
walls and in the desks and wallets of at
least half the males entering the Farm
each Fall. Though a number of these
freshmen quickly adopt the motto of
"What she doesn't know won't, hurt her",
or "3000 miles is sure a heck of a long
ways, so . . ." or in some circumstances
"Dear Jane . . .". an equally large num
ber will cling tenuously to her likeness
and letters through one, two and even
three quarters.
After a little close observation at stra
tegic locations such a* Ihe Stanford Post
Office, one can easily separate these Girls
Back Home into two distinct varieties by
the actions of their admirers on campus.
The first, variety of GBll is the one
who just will not give up and wants to
insure her position with a Stanford man
by constantly reminding him of her pres
ence back iti good old Ipswitch, South
Dakota, or wherever.
Typically she writes him at least two
or three letters each day, a habit which
causes Him to come back from his twice
daily trips to the post office with a mix
ture of starry-eyed infatuation from the
letters' contents, and utter pain from the
correspondences' sheer weight on his face.
But the loyal and true blue type GBll
is not content with mere postal corres
pondence, she often spices up the conver
sation by sending little gifts such as cakes
• a mixed blessing since they are either
inedible or quickly eaten by everybody
else on the floor), or chocolate Easier

This article is the first in a series hy
our intrepid sex editor Thomas Bowon. It
is niisleadingly entitled the "Women of
Stanford," but is really about the relations
of the Men of Stanford with the opposite
sex.
Bowen is a renowned authority in the
field, He is the author of such articles
as "SEX and the Wilbur Parking Lot,"
and the "Problem of Brainier Bags."

Rabbits if the occasion is right. Moreover,
she many times has the habit of enjoying
long phone conversations right in the mid
dip of mid-term studying, or on weekends
i,just to make sure). This is of course
enjoyable for the poor sex-starved guy
in Wilbur (for all questionable sexual
fulfillment obtainable over the tele
phone). but sometimes people begin to
wonder if the guy is setting up perman
ent residence in the house phone booth,
and occasionally they test his apparently
dulled reflexes by gleefully tossing laun
dry detergent through the vents.
However, for those students who
manage to make it through freshman
year, remaining relatively and mutually
true to the GBH, there are benefits when
summer comes around, like the utter joy
and total freedom of three years in Escon
dido Village.
The other variety is totally different.
She is a girl back home, but she writes
about as often as snowballs are produced
and survive in the theological place of
eternal damnation. Predictably the poor
fool who is devoted to her makes about
seventy-five trips to box 7-110 each day
only to be shut down or even more dis
appointed by finding a letter from mom
and dad rather than from the GBH.
This guy is easily recognizable on
campus. He's the one who devotedly stu
dies every weekend of Fall quarter, and
walks around campus (especially the FX).*
looking either as if he would like to fight
the entire world, or as if he just did so
and lost decisively.
Usually this second variety of GBH
disappears in a storm of bitterness about
the first time the loyal freshman returns
home to find that she has been writing
him infrequently because she was too
busy with other guys to do otherwise.
Then he comes back to campus, after dis
playing his utter studliness in a true Stan
ford-style dump in reverse with a note of
bitterness in his voice and his antennae
(horns) tuned for the other females in
ilie urea.

The Girl Bock Home
Despite numerous official and un
official reports 1o the contrary, one of
the primary reasons men come to Stan
ford is to pursue members of the opposite
sex, be they Stanford Dollies, other local
school girls, or even the world renowned
Girl Back Home.
Perhaps (he first of these lovelies to
afflict any Stanford male, and in particu
lar the Freshman male, is the Girl Back
Home. Her likeness is displayed on the
walls and in the desks and wallets of at
least half the males entering the Farm
each Fall. Though a number of these
freshmen quickly adopt the motto of
"What she doesn't know won't, hurt her",
or "3000 miles is sure a heck of a long
ways, so . . ." or in some circumstances
"Dear Jane . . .". an equally large num
ber will cling tenuously to her likeness
and letters through one, two and even
three quarters.
After a little close observation at stra
tegic locations such a* Ihe Stanford Post
Office, one can easily separate these Girls
Back Home into two distinct varieties by
the actions of their admirers on campus.
The first, variety of GBll is the one
who just will not give up and wants to
insure her position with a Stanford man
by constantly reminding him of her pres
ence back iti good old Ipswitch, South
Dakota, or wherever.
Typically she writes him at least two
or three letters each day, a habit which
causes Him to come back from his twice
daily trips to the post office with a mix
ture of starry-eyed infatuation from the
letters' contents, and utter pain from the
correspondences' sheer weight on his face.
But the loyal and true blue type GBll
is not content with mere postal corres
pondence, she often spices up the conver
sation by sending little gifts such as cakes
• a mixed blessing since they are either
inedible or quickly eaten by everybody
else on the floor), or chocolate Easier
