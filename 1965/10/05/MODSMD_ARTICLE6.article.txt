# Gleason's Keynote Speech Highlights Jazz History
## 
### 
Striking an intellectual note,
Jazz Critic Ralph K. Gleason dis
cussed "Jazz and American So
ciety" yesterday with crowds
t fiat packed both Trcsidder
lounges for the inaugural lec
ture of the Stanford Jazz Year.
Gleason called the year-long
academic inquiry "probably the
most unique and ambitious thing
iii the history of jazz music it
self."

Citing jazz as parallel to the
history of American culture in
the improvisational approach to
new frontiers, Gleason reaf
firmed the jazz message "The
Dignity of Man'' to be the gift of
the American Negro, and jazz
the nation's only ethnic art form.
Providing an escape from the
harshness of reality into a world
of sound without color, jazz in
ternationally epitomizes the
"American Dream," and even in
nations where U.S. policy is un
welcome, no one hears the
phrase "Jazzman, go home."
Springing from a black under
ground of the post-reconstruc
tion era, jazz soon evolved into
the expression of the temper and
behavior of the American Negro.
Gleason cited Louis Armstrong
singing the theme from"The
Three-penny Opera," the litany
of corruption from the world he
understands.
The secularization of the gos
pel singer into the blues singer,
continued Gleason, emphasized
more strongly life here and now,
the philosophy to "tell it to me
like it is."
With the "great hypocrisy" of
Prohibition there was a reverse
crossing of the color line as
whites attempted to "ape" negro
mannerisms and mastery of the
world of jazz. Even today, a
"Crow Jim-ism" continues and
Hie merit of a white jazz artist
is determined by how much he
sounds like a negro.
