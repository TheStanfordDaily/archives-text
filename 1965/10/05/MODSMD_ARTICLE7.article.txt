# Ravenswood High For Stanford?

### 
Should Stanford purchase
Ravenswood High School to aid
the University in teacher train
ing and improve the quality of
education in East Palo Alto?
This is tlie contention of John
Mather of Los Altos in a letter
to the Palo Alto Times last
week.
The University has the money
to buy the school from the
PACE program, according to
Mather. Therefore, the only
question is "do the trustees of
Stanford University have the
vision necessary to take this
bold step?".
In suggesting this purchase,
the author gives the following
seven advantages lo the Uni
versity and the community:
1. Stanford could conduct its
graduate education program
with the same advantages as its
medical school.
2. The research efforts of the
school of education could be con
ducted directly under the su
pervision of the originators of
the programs.
3. Experimentation in enhanc
ing the educational opportuni
ties of the culturally disadvan
taged could be conducted in a
laboratory-like situation. Stu-.
dents training in the field of
education could receive t he prac
tical experience in current edu
cational problems to supplement
the theoretical work in the
classroom.
4. The University could dem
onstrate the value of the contri
bution of private institutions to
the community as a whole.
5. The area would benefit
from a major effort to improve
education in East Palo Alto.
6. The taxpayers of the Se
quoia High School District, who
are opposed to segregated
schools but who have balked at
desegregation plans because of
their cost, would have their fi
nancial fears relieved.
7. If Ravenswood was ac
quired by Stanford, it could
draw students from all over the
penninsula area, thus creating
;i better ethnic balance within
the school. This would also re
lieve the "hardpressed Palo Alto
taxpayer of the need for pro
viding a new high school for
more than a decade.''
