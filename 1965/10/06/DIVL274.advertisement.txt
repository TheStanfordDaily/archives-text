insured savings —a full 21 % more than on regular savings accounts at commercial banks.

funds received or postmarked by the 10th earn full interest from the Ist.
INTEREST COMPOUNDED QUARTERLY! Your savings actually earn a big 4.94°£> when our
4.85% current annual rate is compounded quarterly and maintained a year.
