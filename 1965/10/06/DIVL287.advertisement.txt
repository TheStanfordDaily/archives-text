THE BURMESE HARP
A first-line film from Japan. Directed by Kon Ichikawa. English subtitles.
A powerful, haunting film about war guilt — the inroads of con
science which drive a private soldier, one of the Japanese forces in
Burma, to remain there so that he may bury the dead in expiation
for all the sins of war."
Prize, Venice Film Festival, 1956
