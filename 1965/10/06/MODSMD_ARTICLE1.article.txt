# New Archives For Hoover Institute
## 
### HENRY BRIGGS 
Two archives, One of which had been the object
of intensive search by the Russians and the personal
library of the late Fritz Adler, former leader of the
Austrian Social Democratic Parly, were acquired rec
ently for the Hoover Institute by Assistant Director,
Professor Witold Sworakowsky.
Both archives hold secret information concerning
the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, and the 14(10
volume Adler library contains many primary sources
on tho Austrian Social Democratic Party.
Professor Sworakowsky acquired these and other
materials "a gratis" this summer during a ten week
trip to Russia and other Eastern European countries.
The primary purpose of the trip was to finalize ex
change agreements with major Russian and European
libraries as part of the Cultural Exchange Program. The
trip was made for the Hoover Institute as well as the
State Department, and while in Russia, Professor
Sworakowsky was a guest of the Russian government.
No Survillunce
This status in Russia and Red Bloc countries had

distinct advantages, according to Professor Sworakow
sky. "I was shown everything I asked for and was not
kept under surveillance."
In addition to the State Department assignment of
"Achieving for American scholars the same rights to
Russian archives as Soviet scholars" and vice versa,
lie culminated efforts begun five years ago by the
Hoover Institute to acquire an archive containing secret
documents on the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.
"In Moscow, I was asked about an archive, whether
I knew where it was located. I gave an evasive answer,
l)iit in fact it was the archive I later acquired in West
ern Europe."
Sealed Archives
This archive and another smaller one concerning
the Russian revolution will remain sealed "for at least
fifteen years", Sworakowsky said.
"The people who gave lis the archives demanded
that they be closed, because some people in the papers
may still be alive."
He also added that because the Hoover Institute
has never in the past misused confidence of this type,

information and acquisition of other archives has proven
increasingly accessible. He cited as an example the
famous "Okhrana Papers", records of the Czarist Secret
Police, which the Institute acquired in the early 1920's
and kept sealed until 1957, and still keep under lock and
key.
Internal Party Records
The Adler Library was also a major acquisition.
It confains books from the library of Fritz Adler, as
well ak from the library of his father, Victor Adler,
who founded the Austrian Social Democratic Party.
"From 30 to 40 per cent of the library" is primary
source material and contains many "internal party
records", Prof. Sworakowsky said.
He also visited eleven state archives in two major
Russiafi cities. One of the highlights of his trip oecured
when he was allowed to see a brief note written on a
scrap of paper by Peter the Great to Catherine of Rus
sia. said that the note contained one sentence. "I
am pleased to tell that today we beat the Swede in the
head which is to say, they won.

Both archives hold secret information concerning
the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, and the 14(10
volume Adler library contains many primary sources
on tho Austrian Social Democratic Party.
Professor Sworakowsky acquired these and other
materials "a gratis" this summer during a ten week
trip to Russia and other Eastern European countries.
The primary purpose of the trip was to finalize ex
change agreements with major Russian and European
libraries as part of the Cultural Exchange Program. The
trip was made for the Hoover Institute as well as the
State Department, and while in Russia, Professor
Sworakowsky was a guest of the Russian government.
No Survillunce
This status in Russia and Red Bloc countries had

distinct advantages, according to Professor Sworakow
sky. "I was shown everything I asked for and was not
kept under surveillance."
In addition to the State Department assignment of
"Achieving for American scholars the same rights to
Russian archives as Soviet scholars" and vice versa,
lie culminated efforts begun five years ago by the
Hoover Institute to acquire an archive containing secret
documents on the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.
"In Moscow, I was asked about an archive, whether
I knew where it was located. I gave an evasive answer,
l)iit in fact it was the archive I later acquired in West
ern Europe."
Sealed Archives
This archive and another smaller one concerning
the Russian revolution will remain sealed "for at least
fifteen years", Sworakowsky said.
"The people who gave lis the archives demanded
that they be closed, because some people in the papers
may still be alive."
He also added that because the Hoover Institute
has never in the past misused confidence of this type,

information and acquisition of other archives has proven
increasingly accessible. He cited as an example the
famous "Okhrana Papers", records of the Czarist Secret
Police, which the Institute acquired in the early 1920's
and kept sealed until 1957, and still keep under lock and
key.
Internal Party Records
The Adler Library was also a major acquisition.
It confains books from the library of Fritz Adler, as
well ak from the library of his father, Victor Adler,
who founded the Austrian Social Democratic Party.
"From 30 to 40 per cent of the library" is primary
source material and contains many "internal party
records", Prof. Sworakowsky said.
He also visited eleven state archives in two major
Russiafi cities. One of the highlights of his trip oecured
when he was allowed to see a brief note written on a
scrap of paper by Peter the Great to Catherine of Rus
sia. said that the note contained one sentence. "I
am pleased to tell that today we beat the Swede in the
head which is to say, they won.
Two archives, One of which had been the object
of intensive search by the Russians and the personal
library of the late Fritz Adler, former leader of the
Austrian Social Democratic Parly, were acquired rec
ently for the Hoover Institute by Assistant Director,
Professor Witold Sworakowsky.
