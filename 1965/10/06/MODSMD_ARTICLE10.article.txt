# GRAPE PICKERS ON STRIKE
## New Rumble In The Valley 
### My MARY KAY BECKER JON ROISE 
"Huelga! Huelga!
This — the Spanish word for
"strike" is a new sound in
California's Central Valley. Since
September 8, as many as 3000
grape pickers have struck 34
farms in a 65-mile radius of De
lano, a farm town on the border
of Tulare and Kern Counties.
Strikers, organized by the two
farm unions in the town of De
lano, picket the fields from 4:30
a.m. until late afternoon, en
couraging strikebreakers to
1

walk out of the fields and join
t hem.
The odor of rotting grapes
hangs thickly over the dusty
fields. The growers are operat
ing below their usual capacity.
"These growers say the grape
strike hasn't hurt the grape pick
ing at all," said one old woman
in the hall of one of the unions.
"From working in grape crops
myself, I know t hp grapes are
spoiling. The growers say they
aren't, but 1 know they arc."
Harassment
That the growers' concern
over i he strike is fairly large is
indicated by harassing tactics
for example, blocking the field
gates with large trucks and
buses which then follow the pick
ets when they move, and parking
cars in the entrance roads with
the radios turned up to block the
shouts of the pickets.
So far, there have been few
major incidents of violence.
Picketers have been sprayed
with sulphur and insect poison;
a few growers have been brand
ishing shotguns and shoving and
jostling the pickets. Last week
end two growers drove back and
forth along a picket area, swerv
ing their cars narrowly by the
strikers.
Until last week, growers were
able to import a sizable number
of strikebreakers called
"scabs" by t he strikers from
Bakersfield and other towns. A
paid announcement over an
early-morning Bakersfield sta
tion disclaimed the rumors of
the Delano strike, calling it the
work of "a few lazy people" and
asking workers to think of their
hungry children.
Crash Program
Now, the supply of strike
breakers has fallen off as a re
sult of a crash information pro
gram conducted by the unions
in Bakersfield and vicinity, in
cluding radio time and newspa
per ads. Hearing about "la
huelga" for the first time, many
of the strikebreakers have left
Ihe fields.
"We're trying to get the scabs
to join forces with us, but they
need the money, too," explained
one picketer while while waiting
in the predawn night for the
strikebreakers to come out into

the field. "They come up to you,
you know, and say, 'I r.m with
your movement 100 per cent.'
And the next, day they are work
ing again."
Although there has been dis
cussion of a strike in the area
for several years, nothing hap
pened until a small gmip of
Filippino workers decided lo
walk out of the fields early last
month.
"1 got here from Arizona and
worked a week, and someone
said, 'Let's strike!' anc' so we
did," explained one big Filippino.
"We had nothing to lose,"
Members of the Agricultural
Workers' Organizing Committee
(AWOC), a predominately Fili
ppino union affiliated with AFL
CIO, immediately supported the
strike. They were joined by the
Farm Workers' Association
(FWA), an independent organi
zation whose membership is
mainly Mexican-American.
Union Contract Wanted
"This is the first time that the
boys have ever really been de
termined enough lo sticl- it out,"
the wife of one strik t com
mented.
The status of the two unions
is the point of conflict between
the grape growers and the work
ers. All growers refuse 1o nego
tiate with the union or lo grant
a union contract.
The workers are asking for a
union contract in order lo obtain
job security and fringe benefits
which they do not now have,
along with the right, to an or
ganized bargaining mechanism.
Wages are not a crucial issue,
although the unions also specify
a set wage of 51.40 an hour, plus
27) cents a lug, or box of picked
grapes, in their demands. Pick
ers elsewhere in the Valley are
already working for wages high
er than this; others have been of
fered up to $2.00 an hour to
break the strike and come back.
"We'd be willing to pick every
grape in the county if we had a
union contract," one worker
commented.
Indigenous Leader.- hip
"I think they don't want us to
organize because they dc n't want
to have to treat us like humans,"
added another. "To me it's most
ly slave-driving, anyway."
The pickers say their lot is
not an easy one: "This is no life.
You have to drop out of school
at fifteen, and you never get a
chance to better yourself."
The leadership of AWOC and
the FWA is predominately indig
enous. Before the strike began,
the groups were involved in
community organization work,
informing workers a >out an
eventual strike and at empting
to build support ill the commu
nity.
A few weeks ago, the FWA in
vited three CORE workers from
Los Angeles and on 1 SNCC
worker from San Fra iciseo to
help them with the strike. Ce
sar Chavez. FWA leader, is par
ticularly interested in n mvioleir
tactics and their appli 'ation to
the strike.
So far, none of the growers
have shown signs of weakening
Though the growers .vere un
available for comment 1 ist week
end, one field foreman said he
felt they would not give in, pre
ferring to take a heavy loss on
the grape harvest.
Grower 'Hurt'
"Unions are all right for steel,
railroads, and such," he said,
"but they're no good for farm
labor. They can ruin whole har
vests, whole farms." Wage raise?
in the past have been granted to
individual crews, he -said, and
would probably be granted this
time if requested in the same
way and if the workers didn't in
sist on a union contract.
"It hurt me terribly to see the
Filippinos walk out," he said. "I
told them they were doing the
wrong thing. They've been stir
red up by ihe union."
The police have apparently

maintained a neutral position,
although at least one striker
says, "They're as biased as hell."
Two or three police cars are
present at every field entrance
where picketing is taking place
"to prevent violence," according
to one officer. When the pickets
move lo a new location, the po
lice follow. This has been the
practice since the strike began
and will continue until picketing
ceases, he said.
Strikers who live in the pri
vately-owned camps are rapidly
being evicted, in spite of their
having lived in them for perhaps
ten or fifteen years. "You come
home to find a big padlock on
your door and you can't get your
belongings," one worker said.
Some of the workers are sleep
ing in cars camped around the
two offices.
A soup kitchen has been set
up in the AWOC hall to feed the
strikers, especially the large
number of single Filippitto men.
A store of food for families has
been set up by the FWA. Both
of these efforts are supported by
outside contributions of money
and food.
