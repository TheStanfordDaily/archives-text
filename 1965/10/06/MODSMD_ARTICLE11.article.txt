# ACTIVISTS COME HOME
## Students Working In Strike 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
DELANO California's fertile
San Joaquin Valley is beginning
to look like it might he the next
Mississippi for West Const acti
vists.
Last August, Lawrence Guyot,
chairman of the Mississippi Free
dom Democratic Party, told
members of KZSU's Project
South that "more than likely,"
there won't be a student-staffed
project in Mississippi in the
summer of 19(56. The Movement
in the state is far enough along,
he said, that only "technicians,
people with skills" will be asked
to come next summer.
This comes at a time when
there is a growing feeling among
many socially oriented students
that Southerners who grumble,
"Go back to your own state and
solve your own problems," speak
with at least partial justifica
tion.
And it comes at a time, too,
when the deracinated migrant
workers of California's Central
Valley are beginning to stand up
and protest the miserable condi
tions under which they work and
live.
Laborers On Strike
It: comes as no surprize, then,
that students by the score, from
all over the state, are beginning
to descend upon t his small town
in the middle of California's cot
ton- and grape-growing region.
Up to 3000 laborers, predomi
nately Filippino- and Mexican-
Americans, have been on strike
here since the beginning of har
vest season. They are asking for
an increase in wages and, more
importantly, for recognition of
their union by the growers, in
the form of a labor contract.
Students have been doing so
cial work in the area for a couple
of years now. Many from Stan
ford have given up their spring
vacations to work with migrants
in the labor camps. A few, like
Wilbur sponsor Dave Harris,
have become "summer saviors,"
doing appreciable good on a
long-term basis.
But now, with both a critical
strike going on and school in ses
sion, students are dropping into
the strike area on a weekend ba
sis.
"Weekend Warriors"
This leads to the question of
the value of these "weekend war
riors."
Cesar Chavez, who heads thei
Farm Workers' Association, one
of the striking unions, is in sup
port of bringing short-term vol
unteers into the area. First, he!
empathizes deeply with the civil
rights movement, with which
most of the student volunteers 1

have strong connections, and, on
a more mundane level, he feels
they are useful for picketing, dis
tributing leaflets, and canvas
sing.
But perhaps most significant
is Chavez' belief that the pres
ence of people from the outside
makes the strikers realize that
theirs is not a lonely war, that
others are interested in their wel
fare. As in the South, outside
volunteers are a great morale
booster.
Phillip Veracruz, a short,
wirey, middle-aged striking
grape-picker with keen eyes and
strong hands, exemplifies this
belief. "We are glad that you
come to help us." he tells the
students. "We are glad that you
pay attention to some of the
poorest people in the United
States. You know, America is
like your body. If a finger is
missing, it's not complete."
Dubious Value
Others, like Wendy Goepel, a
19(53 Stanford graduale who has
been working in the Delano area
since early September, seem du
bious of the value of students
who come only for a weekend.
"Anybody who wants to help
the strike is welcome here," she
said. "What we don't want is peo
ple who just want to observe, be
cause they just get in the way."
Of the twenty or so students,
mostly from the Bay Area, who
were in Delano last weekend,
most spent their time just get
ting acquainted with the situa
tion. Some helped distribute leaf
lets; a few picketed.
When asked if she thought the
weekend volunteers were useful,
Miss Goepel replied only that "A
lot of them have brought us food
when they came down."
Stanford students who were in
the area last weekend tend to
agree with Miss Goepel's point
of view, but also feel that the ex
perience will help them solicit
support on campus for the strike.

"I don't feel that I was use
ful," says junior Laurie Wise,
who returned from Delano early
Sunday, "but I feel that the ex
perience did a lot for me. With
out it, without knowing what's
really going on, I'm not sin e that
I'd have the motivation to tack
up leaflets in Toyon and help
collect funds."
Senior Kent Hudson, another
Stanfordite who made the trip,
says flatly that he feels students
are more useful garnering cam
pus support for the strike.
The question of weekend use
fulness is rhetoric, however, as
concerned students will undoubt
edly continue to flow into the
area. Only the scale of the oper
ation remains to be seen, and on
that point teeters the possibility
of a new dimension in student
activism.

STRIKERS' KITCHEN â€” Striking San Joaquin Valley grape pick
ers eat a 3 a.m. breakfast in a kitchen set up in the hall of one
of the unions. Once finished, they will go out into the fields to
picket. The kitchen, supported by donations, costs about $150
a day to run.
