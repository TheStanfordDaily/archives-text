# CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA
## Teachers With Extra Pay Could Benefit Slum Areas 
### William F. Buckley, Jr 
Ed. Note — We feel that Mr.
Buckley's comments on a pos
sible cure of the social tur
moil wit Ilia minority ghettos
are applicable to sections of
Southern Californian cities.
A year or so ago, Mr. John
Kenneth Galbraith, the econ
omist—or the whatever else you
prefer to think of him as—sug
gested that the best way to
effect a dramatic improvement
in the ducational standards of
the Negroes in the big cities
would be to create special
schools in the middle of the
slum areas, and tackle the prob
lem head-on.
My first reaction to Mr. Gal
braith's proposal was skeptical,
for the reason that too many
false hopes have been construct
ed on the educational efficacy of
all that brick and glass which,
however munificently provided
by the community in behalf of
the young, does not by itself
guarantee that the children will
grow up knowing anything
more than what Dick said to
Jane about Gyp.

If Mr. Galbraith had said sim
ply that considerable sums of
money should be spent to at
tract the very best teachers to
the slum areas, I'd have agreed
with him, and do so now. Rec
ently, in New York City, the
Board of Education came to the
conclusion that better teachers
were needed in the Harlem area.
Accordingly some of the better
teachers were told to report for
duty in Harlem at the next
semester. The teachers in ques
tion, outraged, protested to their
tachers' union. The union sided
with the teachers, and the Board
of Education was confounded.
There the matter rests.
It is easy, of course, to rai]
against the teachers in question
for refusing to accept an assign
ment that would not only have
taxed their ingenuity as teach
ers, but would have had the ef
fect of recalling however faint
ly something of the idealistic
genealogy of their profession
(the word "rabbi" means "teach
r"). But teaching is not, for
most of those who go into it, a

priestly calling, a pledge made
before God and Man to go out
and extirpate ignorance from
the globe. Most teachers teach
because that is a way, not tot
ally disagreeable, to make a liv
ing, and to lead a busy life.
For many teachers—like the
New Yorkers in question—the
prospect of commuting to dis
agreeable sections of the city,
to grapple with inertia, indiscip
line, and hostility (see, for in
stance, the recent book, White
Teachers in a Black School), is
not what they had in mind at
all when deciding to teach. It
is all very well to say that the
teachers should be told to do
as they are told to do, like good
civil servants. But you cannot
treat a teacher—or a civil serv
ant —as you can a nun or priest
who has taken a vow of obedi
ence. The teacher, even assum
ing his union had let him down
and told him to obey the Board
of Education, would probably
have done what so many other
teachers in New York do every
year. Quit.
The answer, if there is one, is
either to turn the public schools
in those areas oVer precisely to
the religious orders to do the
teaching (but Mrs. Mad Murray
and Mr. Earl Warren would
veto that). Or be prepared to
induce a little idealism in the
teachers by paying them special
pay—for taking on the tough
assignments.
Here, it seems to me, is some
thing truly feasible to do con
cerning the problem of the un
dereducated Negro, something
that takes minimum coopera
tion by the great bureaucracies
of local government, and some
thing to which no member of
the white community could take
reasonable exception. Or are
there arguments against the
proposal that I haven't thought
of? If there ai'o, I don't want to
hear them.

would be to create special
schools in the middle of the
slum areas, and tackle the prob
lem head-on.
My first reaction to Mr. Gal
braith's proposal was skeptical,
for the reason that too many
false hopes have been construct
ed on the educational efficacy of
all that brick and glass which,
however munificently provided
by the community in behalf of
the young, does not by itself
guarantee that the children will
grow up knowing anything
more than what Dick said to
Jane about Gyp.

If Mr. Galbraith had said sim
ply that considerable sums of
money should be spent to at
tract the very best teachers to
the slum areas, I'd have agreed
with him, and do so now. Rec
ently, in New York City, the
Board of Education came to the
conclusion that better teachers
were needed in the Harlem area.
Accordingly some of the better
teachers were told to report for
duty in Harlem at the next
semester. The teachers in ques
tion, outraged, protested to their
tachers' union. The union sided
with the teachers, and the Board
of Education was confounded.
There the matter rests.
It is easy, of course, to rai]
against the teachers in question
for refusing to accept an assign
ment that would not only have
taxed their ingenuity as teach
ers, but would have had the ef
fect of recalling however faint
ly something of the idealistic
genealogy of their profession
(the word "rabbi" means "teach
r"). But teaching is not, for
most of those who go into it, a

priestly calling, a pledge made
before God and Man to go out
and extirpate ignorance from
the globe. Most teachers teach
because that is a way, not tot
ally disagreeable, to make a liv
ing, and to lead a busy life.
For many teachers—like the
New Yorkers in question—the
prospect of commuting to dis
agreeable sections of the city,
to grapple with inertia, indiscip
line, and hostility (see, for in
stance, the recent book, White
Teachers in a Black School), is
not what they had in mind at
all when deciding to teach. It
is all very well to say that the
teachers should be told to do
as they are told to do, like good
civil servants. But you cannot
treat a teacher—or a civil serv
ant —as you can a nun or priest
who has taken a vow of obedi
ence. The teacher, even assum
ing his union had let him down
and told him to obey the Board
of Education, would probably
have done what so many other
teachers in New York do every
year. Quit.
The answer, if there is one, is
either to turn the public schools
in those areas oVer precisely to
the religious orders to do the
teaching (but Mrs. Mad Murray
and Mr. Earl Warren would
veto that). Or be prepared to
induce a little idealism in the
teachers by paying them special
pay—for taking on the tough
assignments.
Here, it seems to me, is some
thing truly feasible to do con
cerning the problem of the un
dereducated Negro, something
that takes minimum coopera
tion by the great bureaucracies
of local government, and some
thing to which no member of
the white community could take
reasonable exception. Or are
there arguments against the
proposal that I haven't thought
of? If there ai'o, I don't want to
hear them.
