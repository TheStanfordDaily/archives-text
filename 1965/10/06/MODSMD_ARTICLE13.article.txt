# WATTS VICTIM OF 20TH CENTURY
## SOCIETY BREEDS RIOTS 
### THE ECONOMIST 
It is not just an American
tragedy.
What happened in Los Angeles
is pretty certainly going to hap

pen in many other countries,
both capitalist and communist,
as the conditions that caused it
spread to them. This was an
American phenonenon only in
the sense that the United States
is half a generation ahead of the
rest of the world in the develop
ment of an industrial urban
society with the special prob
lems that brings. It has the first;
taste of both the pleasures and
the terrors of this new sort of
life.
For the Los Angeles riots were
the product of two causes,
neither of which is peculiar to
America. The first has nothing
to do with race.
In Harlem and Rochester last
year—-quiet so far this year—
the majority of the rioters were
young people caught up in an
explosion of violence against
authority—any authority, but
usually the police, the author
itarians they have run foul of
in their everyday lives. This was
an insurrection, but not against
the economic order (which is the
marxist fallacy) and not even
chiefly against white men's
domination (which is going to
be the Afro-Asian fallacy). It
was an insurrection of anarchy,
an outburst against any kind
of system by the people left at
the bottom.
Those Left Behind
Outbreaks like this are part
of the price we are going to
pay for a society in which more
and more people live in cities

and do deadly dull work and
waste their leisure. One of the
problems of urban-industrial
life is that it creates communi
ties of the left-behind. These are
the people who do the dullest
jobs of all, and are the worst
paid, and live in the ugliest
parts of crumbling old towns.
They have a high rate of illegit
imacy and broken marriages.
Their religious and cultural
roots have been cut.
These people know they are a
community of the untalented,
because a modern state needs to
skim off the people by talent
and by and large does skim
them off. The rest sit and sim
mer. They know they are the
natural bottom layer; they have
been deprived of the social and
religious consolations of the old
rural life; there is no legal out
let for young male violence; and
every now and then they go
bang.
The Swedish police were hav
ing trouble a decade ago with
young toughs raising hell in the
center of Stockholm; in the bad
things as well as the good,
Sweden is America's closest fol
lower on the march to the sort
of society most of us will be
living in by the year 2000. The
Czech police had a first taste
of the problem a year ago when
young hooligans disrupted Wen
ceslas Square in Prague.
Economic Selection
What has happened since 1954
is that the younger members
of this community of the left
behind now have better means
of transport and a wider range
of weapons, at any rate in west
ern Europe and north America.
For those at the bottom, life
presents a still more dismal
picture when it is not God who
calls men to their stations in
life, but the unappealable sel
ection processes of economic
life.
Russian sociologists have
told western colleagues that;
they are deeply worried about
this. So they should be. Com
munism and capitalism are ri
val mechanisms for supplying
material plenty. What neither
of them has thought out, and
what both are going to run
headlong into by the end of
the century, is the problem of
the needs left unsatisfied by
relative abundance: how to

make routine work bearable,
how to help people use their
leisure, how to stop them dying
of boredom—or killing from it.
Color Is Handicap
But there is the second factor.
If part of what made Los An
geles go bang had nothing to
do with race, the other part cer
tainly had. Outbursts like this
can and will happen when the
frustrated bottom-layer people
are racially indistinguishable
from those who live around
them. When they are picked out
by the colour of their skin as
well, the worst happens. They
believe—some of them rightly—
that they could have risen out
of the ghetto of the loft-behind
but for their colour; they band
together with a double griev
ance.
Los Angeles is a model of the
most explosive sort of situation
that the glowingly urbanised,
growingly race-mixed world of
the 1970s and 1980s will have
to cope with.
In one way, it may be a help
for a pressured community to
be able to identify itself by its
colour. The white proletariat of
America and Europe is leader
less: the best of each generation
are plucked away from it to
take a comfortable place higher
up—in the communist world,
where they are absorbed into
the ranks of the apparatchiks,
just as much as in the West.
The potential leaders of a col
oured community, by contrast,

weekly British publication, The Economist, see symptoms of an

stay attached to their commun
ity by their colour, and may be
a force for moderation. But even
this hope is a limited one. The
potential leaders may not be
able to take command of their
communities. And if they can
take command, they may not
stay moderate, or they may be
pushed aside if they do. What
could Martin Luther King, effec
tive in the disciplined South, do
for the troubles of rootless Los
Angeles?
Other Races Have Problems
The mistake no one should
make is to think that this is
only someone else's problem.
People still talk is if the racial
conflict in America was in a
category of its own; or as if the
only significant race confronta
tion was the one between black
and white men.
The whites are certainly go
ing to be in the middle of a
rolling race row for years to
come, if only because for the
last couple of centuries they
have been in a position to be
beastly to everybody else, and
everybody else is now in a mood
to get his own back. But the
world's record even this year
should explode the idea that this
is all there is to it.
Oilier Races Clash
The week of the Los Angeles
riots was also the week when
Malaysia broke apart because
brown men could not control
their dark suspisions of yellow
men, and when black and brown
men resumed their efforts to
slug it out in southern Sudan.
All the evidence is that there is
potential trouble wherever peo
ple of different colours rub
shoulders uneasily together.
Race is the most visible, and
thus the most potent, of the
things that make one lot of men
feel different from another lot;
and as long as they feel dif
ferent, they find it difficult to
muck in together in any com
mon venture, whether is is shar
ing a boarding-house or running
a country.
White Influence Important
Heaven knows how it will
work out; certainly no poli
tician, communist or democratic,
shows the faintest sign of know
ing. It is the most preposterous
counsel of despair to argue that
each race should hence forth re

tire to its own corner of the!
earth, and stay them
The industrialised world needs ,
workers from the developing
world to keep up the momen
tum of economic expansion. II
is in the interest of the develop- ]
ing world that this momentum
should be kept up, and that
communities of white men 1
should live in coloured countries
to start them on the same way. ,
The only hope—and it is a
thin straw to clutch at—is that
as people of different colours I
mix with each other they will
gradually lose the sense of dif
ference that inhibits collabora
tion between them.
Meanwhile, as the races go on
jostling each other, and as the j
race problem exacerbates the
other problems of our industrial
society, anyone who points a
finger of scorn at the Ameri
cans over Los Angeles is calling
the same beastly experience I
down on his own head.

down on his own head.
It is not just an American
tragedy.
What happened in Los Angeles
is pretty certainly going to hap

pen in many other countries,
both capitalist and communist,
as the conditions that caused it
spread to them. This was an
American phenonenon only in
the sense that the United States
is half a generation ahead of the
rest of the world in the develop

taste of both the pleasures and
the terrors of this new sort of
life.
For the Los Angeles riots were
the product of two causes,
neither of which is peculiar to
America. The first has nothing
to do with race.
In Harlem and Rochester last
year—-quiet so far this year—
the majority of the rioters were
young people caught up in an
explosion of violence against
authority—any authority, but
usually the police, the author
itarians they have run foul of
in their everyday lives. This was
an insurrection, but not against
the economic order (which is the
marxist fallacy) and not even
chiefly against white men's
domination (which is going to
be the Afro-Asian fallacy). It
was an insurrection of anarchy,
an outburst against any kind
of system by the people left at
the bottom.
Those Left Behind
Outbreaks like this are part
of the price we are going to
pay for a society in which more
and more people live in cities

and do deadly dull work and
waste their leisure. One of the
problems of urban-industrial
life is that it creates communi
ties of the left-behind. These are
the people who do the dullest
jobs of all, and are the worst
paid, and live in the ugliest
parts of crumbling old towns.
They have a high rate of illegit
imacy and broken marriages.
Their religious and cultural
roots have been cut.
These people know they are a
community of the untalented,
because a modern state needs to
skim off the people by talent
and by and large does skim
them off. The rest sit and sim
mer. They know they are the
natural bottom layer; they have
been deprived of the social and
religious consolations of the old
rural life; there is no legal out
let for young male violence; and
every now and then they go
bang.
The Swedish police were hav
ing trouble a decade ago with
young toughs raising hell in the
center of Stockholm; in the bad
things as well as the good,
Sweden is America's closest fol
lower on the march to the sort
of society most of us will be
living in by the year 2000. The
Czech police had a first taste
of the problem a year ago when
young hooligans disrupted Wen
ceslas Square in Prague.
Economic Selection
What has happened since 1954
is that the younger members
of this community of the left
behind now have better means
of transport and a wider range
of weapons, at any rate in west
ern Europe and north America.
For those at the bottom, life
presents a still more dismal
picture when it is not God who
calls men to their stations in
life, but the unappealable sel
ection processes of economic
life.
Russian sociologists have
told western colleagues that;
they are deeply worried about
this. So they should be. Com
munism and capitalism are ri
val mechanisms for supplying
material plenty. What neither
of them has thought out, and
what both are going to run
headlong into by the end of
the century, is the problem of
the needs left unsatisfied by
relative abundance: how to

make routine work bearable,
how to help people use their
leisure, how to stop them dying
of boredom—or killing from it.
Color Is Handicap
But there is the second factor.
If part of what made Los An
geles go bang had nothing to
do with race, the other part cer
tainly had. Outbursts like this
can and will happen when the
frustrated bottom-layer people
are racially indistinguishable
from those who live around
them. When they are picked out
by the colour of their skin as
well, the worst happens. They
believe—some of them rightly—
that they could have risen out
of the ghetto of the loft-behind
but for their colour; they band
together with a double griev
ance.
Los Angeles is a model of the
most explosive sort of situation
that the glowingly urbanised,
growingly race-mixed world of
the 1970s and 1980s will have
to cope with.
In one way, it may be a help
for a pressured community to
be able to identify itself by its
colour. The white proletariat of
America and Europe is leader
less: the best of each generation
are plucked away from it to
take a comfortable place higher
up—in the communist world,
where they are absorbed into
the ranks of the apparatchiks,
just as much as in the West.

this hope is a limited one. The
potential leaders may not be

communities. And if they can
take command, they may not
stay moderate, or they may be
pushed aside if they do. What
could Martin Luther King, effec
tive in the disciplined South, do
for the troubles of rootless Los
Angeles?
Other Races Have Problems
The mistake no one should
make is to think that this is
only someone else's problem.
People still talk is if the racial
conflict in America was in a
category of its own; or as if the
only significant race confronta
tion was the one between black
and white men.
The whites are certainly go
ing to be in the middle of a
rolling race row for years to
come, if only because for the
last couple of centuries they
have been in a position to be
beastly to everybody else, and
everybody else is now in a mood
to get his own back. But the
world's record even this year
should explode the idea that this
is all there is to it.
Oilier Races Clash
The week of the Los Angeles
riots was also the week when
Malaysia broke apart because
brown men could not control
their dark suspisions of yellow
men, and when black and brown
men resumed their efforts to
slug it out in southern Sudan.
All the evidence is that there is
potential trouble wherever peo

Other Races Have Problems
The mistake no one should
make is to think that this is
only someone else's problem.
People still talk is if the racial
conflict in America was in a
category of its own; or as if the
only significant race confronta
tion was the one between black
and white men.
The whites are certainly go
ing to be in the middle of a
rolling race row for years to
come, if only because for the
last couple of centuries they
have been in a position to be
beastly to everybody else, and
everybody else is now in a mood
to get his own back. But the
world's record even this year
should explode the idea that this
is all there is to it.
Oilier Races Clash
The week of the Los Angeles
riots was also the week when
Malaysia broke apart because
brown men could not control
their dark suspisions of yellow
men, and when black and brown
men resumed their efforts to
slug it out in southern Sudan.
All the evidence is that there is
potential trouble wherever peo
ple of different colours rub
shoulders uneasily together.
Race is the most visible, and
thus the most potent, of the
things that make one lot of men
feel different from another lot;
and as long as they feel dif
ferent, they find it difficult to
muck in together in any com
mon venture, whether is is shar
ing a boarding-house or running
a country.

Heaven knows how it will

The only hope—and it is a

down on his own head.
It is not just an American
tragedy.
What happened in Los Angeles
is pretty certainly going to hap

pen in many other countries,
both capitalist and communist,
as the conditions that caused it
spread to them. This was an
American phenonenon only in
the sense that the United States
is half a generation ahead of the
rest of the world in the develop
ment of an industrial urban
society with the special prob
lems that brings. It has the first;
taste of both the pleasures and
the terrors of this new sort of
life.
For the Los Angeles riots were
the product of two causes,
neither of which is peculiar to
America. The first has nothing
to do with race.
In Harlem and Rochester last
year—-quiet so far this year—
the majority of the rioters were
young people caught up in an
explosion of violence against
authority—any authority, but
usually the police, the author
itarians they have run foul of
in their everyday lives. This was
an insurrection, but not against
the economic order (which is the
marxist fallacy) and not even
chiefly against white men's
domination (which is going to
be the Afro-Asian fallacy). It
was an insurrection of anarchy,
an outburst against any kind
of system by the people left at
the bottom.
Those Left Behind
Outbreaks like this are part
of the price we are going to
pay for a society in which more
and more people live in cities

and do deadly dull work and
waste their leisure. One of the
problems of urban-industrial
life is that it creates communi
ties of the left-behind. These are
the people who do the dullest
jobs of all, and are the worst
paid, and live in the ugliest
parts of crumbling old towns.
They have a high rate of illegit
imacy and broken marriages.
Their religious and cultural
roots have been cut.
These people know they are a
community of the untalented,
because a modern state needs to
skim off the people by talent
and by and large does skim
them off. The rest sit and sim
mer. They know they are the
natural bottom layer; they have
been deprived of the social and
religious consolations of the old
rural life; there is no legal out
let for young male violence; and
every now and then they go
bang.
The Swedish police were hav

Economic Selection
What has happened since 1954
is that the younger members
of this community of the left
behind now have better means
of transport and a wider range
of weapons, at any rate in west
ern Europe and north America.
For those at the bottom, life
presents a still more dismal
picture when it is not God who
calls men to their stations in
life, but the unappealable sel
ection processes of economic
life.
Russian sociologists have
told western colleagues that;
they are deeply worried about
this. So they should be. Com
munism and capitalism are ri
val mechanisms for supplying
material plenty. What neither
of them has thought out, and
what both are going to run
headlong into by the end of
the century, is the problem of
the needs left unsatisfied by
relative abundance: how to

make routine work bearable,
how to help people use their
leisure, how to stop them dying
of boredom—or killing from it.
Color Is Handicap
But there is the second factor.
If part of what made Los An
geles go bang had nothing to
do with race, the other part cer
tainly had. Outbursts like this
can and will happen when the
frustrated bottom-layer people
are racially indistinguishable
from those who live around
them. When they are picked out
by the colour of their skin as
well, the worst happens. They
believe—some of them rightly—
that they could have risen out
of the ghetto of the loft-behind
but for their colour; they band
together with a double griev
ance.
Los Angeles is a model of the
most explosive sort of situation
that the glowingly urbanised,
growingly race-mixed world of
the 1970s and 1980s will have
to cope with.
In one way, it may be a help
for a pressured community to
be able to identify itself by its
colour. The white proletariat of
America and Europe is leader
less: the best of each generation
are plucked away from it to
take a comfortable place higher
up—in the communist world,
where they are absorbed into
the ranks of the apparatchiks,
just as much as in the West.

Other Races Have Problems
The mistake no one should
make is to think that this is
only someone else's problem.
People still talk is if the racial
conflict in America was in a
category of its own; or as if the
only significant race confronta
tion was the one between black
and white men.
The whites are certainly go
ing to be in the middle of a
rolling race row for years to
come, if only because for the
last couple of centuries they
have been in a position to be
beastly to everybody else, and
everybody else is now in a mood
to get his own back. But the
world's record even this year
should explode the idea that this
is all there is to it.
Oilier Races Clash
The week of the Los Angeles
riots was also the week when
Malaysia broke apart because
brown men could not control
their dark suspisions of yellow
men, and when black and brown
men resumed their efforts to
slug it out in southern Sudan.
All the evidence is that there is
potential trouble wherever peo
ple of different colours rub
shoulders uneasily together.
Race is the most visible, and
thus the most potent, of the
things that make one lot of men
feel different from another lot;
and as long as they feel dif
ferent, they find it difficult to
muck in together in any com
mon venture, whether is is shar
ing a boarding-house or running
a country.
White Influence Important
Heaven knows how it will
work out; certainly no poli
tician, communist or democratic,
shows the faintest sign of know
ing. It is the most preposterous
counsel of despair to argue that
each race should hence forth re

tire to its own corner of the!
earth, and stay them
The industrialised world needs ,

is in the interest of the develop- ]
ing world that this momentum
should be kept up, and that
communities of white men 1
should live in coloured countries
to start them on the same way. ,
The only hope—and it is a
thin straw to clutch at—is that
as people of different colours I
mix with each other they will
gradually lose the sense of dif
ference that inhibits collabora
tion between them.
Meanwhile, as the races go on
jostling each other, and as the j
race problem exacerbates the
other problems of our industrial
society, anyone who points a
finger of scorn at the Ameri
cans over Los Angeles is calling
the same beastly experience I
down on his own head.
It is not just an American
tragedy.
What happened in Los Angeles
is pretty certainly going to hap

pen in many other countries,
both capitalist and communist,
as the conditions that caused it
spread to them. This was an
American phenonenon only in
the sense that the United States
is half a generation ahead of the
rest of the world in the develop
ment of an industrial urban
society with the special prob
lems that brings. It has the first;
taste of both the pleasures and
the terrors of this new sort of
life.
For the Los Angeles riots were
the product of two causes,
neither of which is peculiar to
America. The first has nothing
to do with race.
In Harlem and Rochester last
year—-quiet so far this year—
the majority of the rioters were
young people caught up in an
explosion of violence against
authority—any authority, but
usually the police, the author
itarians they have run foul of
in their everyday lives. This was
an insurrection, but not against
the economic order (which is the
marxist fallacy) and not even
chiefly against white men's
domination (which is going to
be the Afro-Asian fallacy). It
was an insurrection of anarchy,
an outburst against any kind
of system by the people left at
the bottom.
Those Left Behind
Outbreaks like this are part
of the price we are going to
pay for a society in which more
and more people live in cities

and do deadly dull work and
waste their leisure. One of the
problems of urban-industrial
life is that it creates communi
ties of the left-behind. These are
the people who do the dullest
jobs of all, and are the worst
paid, and live in the ugliest
parts of crumbling old towns.
They have a high rate of illegit
imacy and broken marriages.
Their religious and cultural
roots have been cut.
These people know they are a
community of the untalented,
because a modern state needs to
skim off the people by talent
and by and large does skim
them off. The rest sit and sim
mer. They know they are the
natural bottom layer; they have
been deprived of the social and
religious consolations of the old
rural life; there is no legal out
let for young male violence; and
every now and then they go
bang.
The Swedish police were hav
ing trouble a decade ago with
young toughs raising hell in the
center of Stockholm; in the bad
things as well as the good,
Sweden is America's closest fol
lower on the march to the sort
of society most of us will be
living in by the year 2000. The
Czech police had a first taste
of the problem a year ago when
young hooligans disrupted Wen
ceslas Square in Prague.
Economic Selection
What has happened since 1954
is that the younger members
of this community of the left
behind now have better means
of transport and a wider range
of weapons, at any rate in west
ern Europe and north America.
For those at the bottom, life
presents a still more dismal
picture when it is not God who
calls men to their stations in
life, but the unappealable sel
ection processes of economic
life.
Russian sociologists have
told western colleagues that;
they are deeply worried about
this. So they should be. Com
munism and capitalism are ri
val mechanisms for supplying
material plenty. What neither
of them has thought out, and
what both are going to run
headlong into by the end of
the century, is the problem of
the needs left unsatisfied by
relative abundance: how to

make routine work bearable,
how to help people use their
leisure, how to stop them dying
of boredom—or killing from it.
Color Is Handicap
But there is the second factor.
If part of what made Los An
geles go bang had nothing to
do with race, the other part cer
tainly had. Outbursts like this
can and will happen when the
frustrated bottom-layer people
are racially indistinguishable
from those who live around
them. When they are picked out
by the colour of their skin as
well, the worst happens. They
believe—some of them rightly—
that they could have risen out
of the ghetto of the loft-behind
but for their colour; they band
together with a double griev
ance.
