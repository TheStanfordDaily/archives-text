## Incredible Dodgers Could Take Series 
### BY MARSHALL COOK 
Since I spent the summer in Los Angeles and am known to ho
a baseball fan, I am often asked by my Bay area friends about
the Dodgers of Los Angeles. Now that these mysterious Dodgers
have won Ihe National League pennant from the local favorites,
the questions have become hysterical.
"Do the Dodgers really exist?" some will ask. Or are they a
myth, a legend in blue and white of bandits, stealing from the poor
and rich alike? And how could a team without a single three-hun
dred hitter (some will say without any kind of a hitter I win the
National League race?
Must Be Seen To Believe
The Dodgers must be seen to be believed. Even then the tend
ency is to smirk at the puny likes of Wes Parker, Jim Lefebvre,
and Willie Davis, the doddering Jim Gilliam, the pudgy Ron Fairly.
They win games without hitting a ball hard enough to bruise
it. They won a game 3-1 from Dick Ellsworth on one eighth inning
hit. They beat the Braves 3-1 on the day they clinched the pennant
on two hits, both by puny Jim Lefebvre. Thy won a game from
the Cubs when Lou Johnson walked, stole second, went to third
on an overthrow, and scored on an infield out. Sandy Koufax threw
a perfect game then, and that starts to explain why the Dodgers
win, and why they will win ihe World Series.
In Koufax, Don Drysdale, and Claude Osteen, who won sixty
four games between them, the Dodgers have three of the most
patient men in baseball. Also three of the best pitchers. They labor
through each game, stoically waiting for their "hitters" to get them
their one run. Koufax won four games in a row earlier In the year
by 1-0 scores.
Koufax may also be the best pitcher in the history of the game.
He is the single season strikeout king; lie will win this year's Cy
Young award, the second time he has been so honored; he is the
only pitcher in history to pitch four no hit, no run games; he is
also the only pitcher in baseball with arthritis of the elbow.
"Yeah, But Who Won?"
"Did you hear?" the story goes, "Koufax pitched a no-hitter
today." "Yeah, but who won?" the knowing fan replies.
"Perhaps the Dodgers win because they are a smart team,"
my Bay area friend will ponder. Hardly; the Dodgers are the team
that leaves three men on the same base at the end of an inning,
that tries pick-off plays to an unoccupied base. When you say a
Dodger is left-handed all the way, you mean ho bats, throws, and
thinks left-handed. The Dodgers are so stupid, they sent an un
armed man against an armed Juan Marichal, and that isn't good
sense in any league.
How, then, can the Dodgers win? It's awfully hard to say. It
may be done with mirrors. Some things I remember from watching
them play. The Dodgers are Willie Davis misjudging a fly ball and
then making a one-handed catch against the wall. The Dodgers are
Maury Wills, the best base runner of all time, dragging a bunt,
stealing second, and scoring on a pop single. The Dodgers are Willie
Davis, the most exciting base runner of the year, scoring from first
on a single, or scoring from third on a fly ball and needing a rolling
block at the dugout steps to stop.
Tlie Dodgers Are a Merry-Go-Roimd
The Dodgers are a concrete-hard infield, so that Maury Wills
can beat out high choppers. The Dodgers are that puny Lefebvre
or that strong Johnson hitting a home run to surprise everyone.
The Dodgers are Don Drysdale, drenched in sweat, waiting for that
one run, and finally driving it in himslf (he is the club's top and
best hitter this year).
The Dodgers are a lot more that you can hardly believe. They
are a track team with wings, a merry-go-round run wild. Pitchers
delight in pitching against them, until one of the sprinters gets
on base, until he sees his own batsmen return to the bench mutter
ing about curves that break two feet and fast balls that hum, dance,
and intimidate.
Most of all. the Dodgers are the National League champions,
and don't you forget it. Soon they will be the World Champions,
and messers Drysdale, Koufax, Osteen, Miller, Perronowski, et.al.
can go home and dream of 13-0 laughers.
Maybe the Dodgers are a legend at that.
