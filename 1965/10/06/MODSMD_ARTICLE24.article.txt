## Card Booters Falter Before Bear Defense 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
fell victim to a tight defense,
and lost 2-1 to California's Gold
en Bear's. The game was played
at Maloney Field at Stanford.
Cal All-American goalie Tim
Tarpley made 21 saves against
ihe Indian hooters, many of
which testified to his national
status.
On the whole, however, Stan
ford's shots were from well
outside thanks to a leakproof
defensive wall thrown up by the
Bears.
