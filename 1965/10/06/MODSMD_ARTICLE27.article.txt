# The 						University And Social Action
## 
### 
The prevailing attitude among Trustees and
high administrators that this University i/na
university must remain aloof from our society
—its politics, mores and crises—should be sub
stantially modified if not reversed.
This is particularly true of University policy
relating to the social and educational better
ment of East Palo Alto. Great universities such
as Chicago and Columbia have done much to
improve their neighboring communities—such
has not been the case at Stanford.
The rationale for the present isolationist pol
icy — "autonomous" is the preferred terminology
—rests on two premises, one of which is intel
lectually indefensible and the other so preg
nant with expediency as to be morally obnox
ious.
The intellectual defense lor the separation ol
the university from its environs is best stated by
Albert Lepawsky of the University of California
who writes in The Berkeley Student Revolt,
"The main task we face is that of preserving the
university not merely as a free political com
munity but primarily as an institution which is
privileged to be an intellectual sanctuary within
a greater society that is now in political flux."
We find this philosophy admirable — for the
McCarthy era — not for today.
A society in "political flux" needs leadership,
intellectual and moral leadership. To shelter
scholars in an academic sanctuary for four years
or more is to deprive both the student and the
community at large of beneficial interaction. Yet
such is the philosophy here.
Moreover, this philosophy is further rational
ized by extremely dubious 'practical consider
ations. One high administrator informed us that
University action on off-campus issues — be
they international, national or from just across
El Camino Real — would be an unwise move in
a society where a great and autonomous uni
versity cannot exist without financial assistance
from"the State."
This expediency is selt-evulently contradic
tory, or else the word "autonomy'" is a hollow
shell.
Indeed, when this expediency is examined in
the light of the University's policy of aloofness
toward the problems of the surrounding com

inuiiity, it is not even a correct analysis. "1 lie
State would probably be willing to commit
funds to any University project in this field, as
would many philanthropic foundations. In fact,
negotiations with the Carnegie Foundation are
presently underway for a $250,000 grant.
However, we wonder why the University will
not commit some of its own vast resources. Pres
ently, an ASSU-directed attempt to coordinate
the various tutorial and self-help projects in East
Palo Alto is pressing forward with the awe-in
spiring sum of $200 — all of it from the student
government's own contingency fund. The
School of Education is supplying some secretar
ial help, yet no other University aid has been
forthcoming.
Similarly, University officials have so far re
jected the proposal that Stanford purchase
Kavcnswood High School and turn it into an
experimental, integrated secondary school in
stead of the costly, segregated institution it is
now. This move would not only benefit the
w hole community by creating a more equitable
ethnic balance within the school, it would also
provide the School of Education a place where
research, training and practical oxperimentation
could be initiated.
It would be regrettable il such projects were
slighted due to a mistaken concept of "auton
omy." Indeed, we fear that the Administration
is not so much concerned with retaining Stan
fords autonomy as it is with offending the num
erous alumni who live in this area and have a
stake in the status quo.
The question, then, as one citizen noted in a
letter to the Palo Alio Times concerning the Rav
enswood purchase, is "do the Trustees of Stan
ford University have the vision necessary to take
this bold step? Or will they allow Ravenswood
and the various student programs to go un
aided?
In considering this step—an admitted depar
ture from the current philosophy of Ivory Tower
intellectualism and idealism—we would remind
the powers-that-bc of a succinct observation by
Stanford's most eminent alumnus, one Herbert
(loover—
"Words without action are the assassins of
idealism."
