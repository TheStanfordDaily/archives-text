## Rights And Privileges In Selecting Associates 
### 
Editor, The Daily
The right of an individual to
select his associates in his pri
vate life is unquestioned. But
when selection becomes an insti
tutionalized system applied by
a corporate entity it is no longer
a right but a privilege. Such a
privilege can only bo claimed in
the name of some purpose.
There is, for instance, a group
of Stanford students who live
together off campus under the
auspices of no organized group,
but who select members on the
basis of their ability to contrib
ute to and profit by the intense
intellectual and philosophical at
mosphere they attempt to main
tain. That a fraternity may not
be able to state so definitive a
purpose does not necessarily
imply that it. is purposeless.
1 can speak only for my own
fraternity, and 112 hesitate even
then to state its purpose in any
hut the most general terms. But
I suggest the following as a
measure of the most basic func
tion of a fraternity.
Unlike "any other small liv
ing group" the fraternity must
accept ;i responsibility to its
members over and above the ba
sic demands of food and shelter.
It must somehow contribute to
the development of its members.
"Development" is a broad term
and perhaps something of an
evasion. Such development may
take an educational or some
other direction; a specific exami
nation of what "development"
entails would require a treatise,
not a letter.
What I am suggesting is that
the fraternities, each fraternity,
turn its attention to writing this
treatise. The truth of Professor
Stone's criticism must be grant
ed, if a fraternity is only an
other living group, then its priv
ilege of selecting membership is
unjustly claimed. Each frater
nity must answer for itself, for
each is different and one cannot
answer for all.
What is the purpose of the
fraternity and is the existence of
the fraternity justified by it?
And above all. does the frater
nity fulfill its purpose? The
question must be answered, for
the Freshmen will' ask it in the
Spring.

• A Mendicant Refrain
Editor, The Daily:
Us Mendicants would rather
sing tha» sit-in.
We don't expect the whole
campus to bleed and die over us
as if our cause was really impor

tant like Vietnam or booze on
the Quad —but it does seem that
there should be room in this i
great pluralistic institution for I
our kind of group.
Our problem: we've lost our I
rehearsal space. We need the use !
of a room, maybe 15 by 20, with '
doors that open and shut and !
enough space for our bodies and
a piano.
In case everyone has been
asleep, the Mendicants are a
singing group of 16 men avail
able for faculty charivaris, staff
bashes, student vigils, or most
anything else. And we are just!
asking, not demanding. We don't
intend to stage a sit-in even if
no one heeds our plea.
But: we plan to keep right on
singing whether we're able to re- j
hearse or not. It should there-1
fore be obvious that it is in the!
best interests of all who will
hear us to start looking for a i
rehearsal hall.
We'll sure be grateful to any- j
one who can help us out. Call us i
at — oh hell, we don't even have j
a phone. Write us at P. O. Box j

• Sex And The Daily
' !
Editor, The Daily
The recent articles on Paly |
High Girls and Girls Back Home, '
along with the appointment of a |
"renowned authority" as Daily
Sex Editor, seem to represent a j
new and unwelcome trend: to ;
"get more sex in the Daily" in as
vulgar and obvious a manner as j
possible. Not that sex in itself is
a taboo subject — but couldn't it !
be dealt with more maturely
than in terms of horns and chew
ing gum?
Mr. Bowen might be encour- j
aged to find a more private me-1
dium to relieve the pains of his
freshman year, but in the Daily
it's more obnoxious than funny.
If the Daily really wants more
sex articles, there are a lot of
problems more interesting than j
that of the girl back home that
might be explored responsibly.
