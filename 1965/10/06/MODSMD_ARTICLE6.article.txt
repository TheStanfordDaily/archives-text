# New Pavilion To Seat 8000
## Two-Stage Construction Due To Funds Shortage 
### JEFFREY HARRIS 
Preliminary planning is now
underway for an indoor athletic
stadium on the Stanford cam
pus to replace the cramped, out
dated Pavilion.
The proposed Roscoe Maples
Pavilion is scheduled to open
sometime early in 19& X. and the
cost of the entire project, has
been set at over $2.5 million, ac
cording to Mr. Royal Tyson of
the campus Planning Depart
ment.
Although part of the funds for
the new Pavilion was a gift to
the University from the late
Roscoe Maples, construction has
been planned in two stages due
to temporary shortage of sev
eral hundred thousand dollars.
Upon completion, the new Pavil
ion will have a bleacher seating
capacity of 8000, as opposed to
the 2700 that can be crammed
into the present Pavilion.
Located south of Campus
Drive, just east of the varsity

tennis courts, the new Pavilion
will provide the largest indoor
seating facility on campus- four
times the size of Mem And and
approaching the capacity of
Frost Amphitheater. The build
ing will contain complete locker
room and lounge facilities for
both homo and visiting teams,
and is expected to encourage
many activities of general in
terest lectures, concerts, bal
lets as well as both inter col
legiate and intra-mural sports.
Most of the advantages of the
new Pavilion concern spectators
as well as the basketball players
themselves. Ticket booths will
be outside a fenced area, an ar
rangement similar to that at the
football stadium which elimin
ates crowding on the inside,
anyway.
The architect, John Carl
Warnecke <'4D, has designed all
the seats with unobstructed
views of the floor, as a boon
to those basketball enthusiasts
who suffered back whiplash
from post-peeking in the old
Pavilion. Lighting and ventila
tion will be up to present-day
standards.
Fresh Air
The old Pavilion now has to
be opened up early in the morn
ing before basketball games, in
order to get fresh air circulat
ing. This was apparently the
custom in 1922, when the old
Pavilion was built.
Assistant varsity coach Bill
Turner was enthusiastic about
the plans for the new Pavilion.
He said that not only would it
provide greatly improved prac
tice facilities for the basketball
team, but it would also free
other areas greatly needed for
boxing, wrestling, and gymnas
tics.
The Roscoe Maples Pavilion
will eventually bcome the cen
ter of a new complex of facili
ties for the entire Athletic De
partment, according to oCach
Turner.
"I think that lots of people
will still miss the old Pavilion,''
he commented, adding however,
that he will not be among them.
For those who will miss it, there
are still two years to say good
bye.


STANFORD'S PROJECTED Roscoe W. Maples Pavilion in sche
matic cross-section shows how an extra 2,000 seats will be
provided by end-cantilevered sections to achieve total seating
capacity of 8,000. Team rooms and public facilities will be
under the bleachers. Spectators will enter on the second level
above the lower level rooms.
