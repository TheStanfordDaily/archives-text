# Sir John Glubb Speaks On West, Middle East
## 
### CHARLOTTE ACKERLEY 
The western world, according
to a legendary military leader
of the Arab Legion, faces prob
lems in the Middle East today
because it fails to recognize the
existance of four centuries of
world history.
General Sir John Bagot Glubb,
speaking last night at the first
of Stanford's Tuesday Evening
Lecture Series in Dinklespiel
Auditorium, commented that
hardly anyone in the modern
western world has heard of the
great Arabic Empire which dom

inated Europe for four centuries.
"This seems to be," he said,
"one of the most masterly
pieces of censorship that has
been carried out in the history
of tho world."
Forgotten Umpire
Sir John stated that the Ara
bic Empire extended from the
Atlantic ocean in France and
Spain to the frontiers of China,
and noted that Arabic influence
remained strong for nearly 500
years after the introduction of
the Islam religion in what, is now
Saudia Arabia.
But, according to the 68-year
old veteran of the British Army
in the Middle East, no one seems
to have heard of the Empire.
"Even diplomats and ambas
sadors in Arabic countries don't
know anything of the back
ground of the people they arc
dealing with." he said.
Modern Implications
Sir John commented that this
situation lias had nearly disas
trous implication in modern
times, because westerners fail
to understand the reasoning be
hind Arabic actions.
"All our mistakes, all the stu
pidities we have committed in
the past 50 years in the Middle
East." he said, "are due to the
fact that we knew nothing at all
about these people."
Glubb noted that logarithms,
trigonometry, algebra, the use of
the place value system, and the
invention of the zero ;ill came
from the Arabic Empire during
the time referred to as the "Dark
Ages."
He also stated that the Arabs
were leaders in chemistry, as
tronomy. commerce and indus
try and even invented rhyming
poetry.
