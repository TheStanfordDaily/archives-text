HAVE A DATE EVERY
SATURDAY NIGHT
You II finally be able to afford 10, if
you get a Honda.
Trade in your gas eater for a thrifty
Honda fifty, yp to 200 miles per gal
lon, and at least that many laughs,
Maybe mote.
Hondas are just the ticket for campus
raffic and campus parking, and you'll
noticc a big difference in your pocket-
Dook; too. It'll bulge for a change,
so will your date book.
