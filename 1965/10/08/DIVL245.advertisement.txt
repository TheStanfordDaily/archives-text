Jestis Christ said, "No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the
one, and love the oilier; or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. You
cannot serve God and mammon" (..Matthew t>:24). Serving God and living for self
is not just unfeasible, hut totally impossible, Jesus said.
Jesu s Christ said, "I atn the vine, you are tho branches. He who abides in tnc,
and 1 in him, he it is that hears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing"
i John 15:15). All activity which does not spring from trust and dependence in HLm

"ves. I will" response to Jesus Christ is an automatic "no" vote for (Jod.
These claims of Jesus Christ have been verified by countless millions through
the ages who have discovered new life with meaning and purpose as a result of their

for peace in a dying world, those who know and obey Jesus Christ find full, fruitful

You alone can decide whether to accept or reject Jesus Christ, but lie has not
left us the choice of remaining neutral. Your "yes" in response to His offer will
bring you forever into His family. Jesus said, "Come unto me all ye that labor and
are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you. and learn of me;
for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ve shall find rest for your souls. For my yoke
is easy and by burden is light" (Matthew ll:2K-.iO).
