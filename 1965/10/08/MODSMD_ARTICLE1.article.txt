• tiiiss Rocket Signals Cease
JODRELL BANK, England All signals
from the Soviet moon rocket ceased yester
day two minutes after its retrorockets were
fired, the Jodrell Bank Observatory reported.
"We do not know whether the signals
were intentionally cut off or if there has
been an impact with the moon," said Sir
Bernard Lovell, director of the observatory.
"It is impossible to do more than guess
at what, if anything, has gone wrong. But
our assumption was that the Russians in
tended to make a soft landing of instru
ments on the lunar surface," he said.
"On that assumption the final stages of
firing the retrorockets were only partially
successful.
"We would bo surprised if Tass announced
that there was anything but a crash land

Kashmir yesterday. Each side reported in-
Hicting heavy losses on the other.

• Man Rarely Lives
REDDING, Calif. — "1 figured I was a
goner. I'd shoot and he'd keep chewing. I
could hear the bones in my aim crunching.
All 1 could think of was to get him before
I passed out."
"We were hunting deer," Fred Seaford

explained. "I never hunt hear. I've never
bothered a bear in my life."
Hie hunting party of seven two families
was working its way up a canyon when
the bear sprang from a low depression along
a deer trail.
"I had this hand in the bear's mouth," Sea
lord said, gesturing toward his thickly ban
daged left hand. "In my other hand I had
a Savage .243-caliber rifle.
"On the first shot, he turned loose of my
arm. Me must have been trying to bite his
flank, where the bullet hit. He sank four
fangs into my right leg instead."
On the second or third shot, Seaford said,
his clothing caught in the breeehworks of
the rifle and he had to eject an unfired bullet'
to clear the chamber.
"1 was doing quite a bit of hollering," he
said. "When the old bear quit, I was so tired
that 1 couldn't crawl out from under him."
He estimated the animal weighed 300 to
400 pounds.
He was rushed in the back of a pickup
truck to Mercy Hospital in Redding where
he is recovering.

REDDING, Calif. — "1 figured I was a
goner. I'd shoot and he'd keep chewing. I
could hear the bones in my aim crunching.
All 1 could think of was to get him before
I passed out."
"We were hunting deer," Fred Seaford

explained. "I never hunt hear. I've never
bothered a bear in my life."
Hie hunting party of seven two families
was working its way up a canyon when
the bear sprang from a low depression along
a deer trail.
"I had this hand in the bear's mouth," Sea
lord said, gesturing toward his thickly ban
daged left hand. "In my other hand I had
a Savage .243-caliber rifle.
"On the first shot, he turned loose of my
arm. Me must have been trying to bite his
flank, where the bullet hit. He sank four
fangs into my right leg instead."
On the second or third shot, Seaford said,
his clothing caught in the breeehworks of
the rifle and he had to eject an unfired bullet'
to clear the chamber.
"1 was doing quite a bit of hollering," he
said. "When the old bear quit, I was so tired
that 1 couldn't crawl out from under him."
He estimated the animal weighed 300 to
400 pounds.
He was rushed in the back of a pickup
truck to Mercy Hospital in Redding where

NEW DELHI, India — Fresh fighting
flared between India and Pakistani troops in

Kashmir yesterday. Each side reported in-

A communique issued in New Delhi said
action in the Chhamb sector, in the southern

- meaning 2,000 or more men- with inter
mittent artillery support in the Mendhar
sector.
"Our troops have inflicted heavy casual
ties on the enemy and repulsed the attack,"
a Pakistani communique said.
The Pakistanis said they were still fighting
against Indian attacks on outposts at Khuir

sector, have "taken the necessary counter
measures" against Indian thrusts.

• tiiiss Rocket Signals Cease
JODRELL BANK, England All signals
from the Soviet moon rocket ceased yester
day two minutes after its retrorockets were
fired, the Jodrell Bank Observatory reported.
"We do not know whether the signals
were intentionally cut off or if there has
been an impact with the moon," said Sir
Bernard Lovell, director of the observatory.
"It is impossible to do more than guess
at what, if anything, has gone wrong. But
our assumption was that the Russians in
tended to make a soft landing of instru
ments on the lunar surface," he said.
"On that assumption the final stages of
firing the retrorockets were only partially
successful.
"We would bo surprised if Tass announced
that there was anything but a crash land
ing."

flared between India and Pakistani troops in

Kashmir yesterday. Each side reported in-
Hicting heavy losses on the other.
A communique issued in New Delhi said
action in the Chhamb sector, in the southern

ties on the enemy and repulsed the attack,"

against Indian attacks on outposts at Khuir

sector, have "taken the necessary counter
measures" against Indian thrusts.

• Man Rarely Lives
REDDING, Calif. — "1 figured I was a
goner. I'd shoot and he'd keep chewing. I
could hear the bones in my aim crunching.
All 1 could think of was to get him before
I passed out."
"We were hunting deer," Fred Seaford

explained. "I never hunt hear. I've never
bothered a bear in my life."
Hie hunting party of seven two families
was working its way up a canyon when
the bear sprang from a low depression along
a deer trail.
"I had this hand in the bear's mouth," Sea
lord said, gesturing toward his thickly ban
daged left hand. "In my other hand I had
a Savage .243-caliber rifle.
"On the first shot, he turned loose of my
arm. Me must have been trying to bite his
flank, where the bullet hit. He sank four
fangs into my right leg instead."
On the second or third shot, Seaford said,
his clothing caught in the breeehworks of
the rifle and he had to eject an unfired bullet'
to clear the chamber.
"1 was doing quite a bit of hollering," he
said. "When the old bear quit, I was so tired
that 1 couldn't crawl out from under him."
He estimated the animal weighed 300 to
400 pounds.
He was rushed in the back of a pickup
truck to Mercy Hospital in Redding where
he is recovering.
