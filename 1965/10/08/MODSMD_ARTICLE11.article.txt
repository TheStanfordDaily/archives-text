# Frosh Have Runny Noses
## 
### 
A rash of colds, which the
Health Service terms a perfect- !
ly normal occurrence for the
beginning of autumn quarter, ;
has struck with force at the
Wilbur Houses.
Although many a frosh male, â– 
surrounded by nose drops and j
throat lozenges, was painfully i
aware of this plague; the stu- ,
dent health service was uncon- ;
cerned, and would not admit the j
presence of an epidemic. A
spokesman, Dr. Maurice Os- j
borne, stated that a converg-,
ence of so many different germ- j
carrying individuals is bound to !
result in a disproportionate j
amount of respiratory ailments.
He added the colds were not j
serious and were not yet too
widely spread outside the Fresh
man class.
As a public service, the Daily
suggests plenty of rest and |
fluids to be the best cure. It also j
suggests that Freshmen watch ;
their hygene habits and keep I
their noses clean.
