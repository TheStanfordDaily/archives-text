## 
### 
Tuesday the House of Repre
sentatives approved a bill which
saves Stanford University
$12,000 in import duties on a
German-made ma s s spectro
meter.
According to Rep. Charles S.
Gubser, R-Gilroy, who aided
passage of thp bill, importation
of the scientific instrument,
which is used in chemical an
alysis, was necessary because it
is not manufactured in the Un
ited States.
A university spokesman said
the spectrometer, priced be
tween $3"),000 and $40,000, has
been in use at Stanford for
about two years.. The import
duties, already paid by Stanford,
will be returned. , ,
