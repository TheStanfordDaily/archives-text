### 
Associated Fi'ess Sports Writer
MINNEAPOLIS - ST. PAUL
AP — The scrappy Minnesota
Twins, again led by little Zoiln
Versalles, beat Sandy Koufax
Thursday and went two up on
tlie Los Angeles Dodgers with a
5-1 victory in the second World
Series game behind the pitching
of Jim Kaat.
Kaat Superb
Kaat, only 25, tinned in a su
perb job with a seven-hitter
while the Dodgers defense col
lapsed with three errors. Jim Gil
liam, the 36-year-old coach who
returned to action at third base
in May, opened the gates in the
Twins' two-run sixth inning with
a two-base error.
The Dodgers, who had gone
into the Series as T'u-.i favorites,
now face an uphill struggle.
Only the 1921 New York Giants,
the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers, and
the 1956 and 1958 New York
Yankees had overcome such a
back-breaking handicap.
Oliva's It KB
Tony Oliva, the American

League batting champ who had
gone hitless in six trips, knocked
in the first run off Koufax. He
doubled to left in the sixth after
Gilliam had let Versalles' shot
bounce off his glove and go
down the left field line for a
costly error.
Until Gilliam opened the door
with his misplay, Koufax and
Kaat were locked in a shutout
duel. Each had allowed only
three hits and Sandy, who set a
modern major league strikeout
record with 352 in the regular
season, had struck out eight in
five innings.
After Gilliam's error, Joe Nos
sek's sacrifice, the double by
Oliva and Killcbrew's single, the
Twins were never headed. They
had a chance to open the lead
wide!' but Koufax struck out Bob
Allison and made Don Mincher
ground out to end the sixth.
Squelched Threat
The big Dodger threat came in
the seventh when Ron Fairly
and Jim Lefebvre opened up on
Kaat with singles to left. Wes
Parker's sacrifice moved the
runners and Johnny Roseboro's
single to right scored Fairly.
With the score 2-1 and men on
second and third, Dodger Mana
ger Walter Alston called on
Drysdale, his top hitter with a
.300 average, as a pinch hitter.
Big Don went down swinging,
missing three straight pitches by

Ihe Minnesota left-hander. Wills
flied out, ending the threat.
Versalles hit his triple after
two were out in the seventh.
While Perranoski was pitching
to Joe Nossek, Boilo broke down
the baseline.
Ron hurried lus pitch and
bounced one into the dirt that
catcher John Roseboro blocked
but couldn't hold. Roseboro tried
a desperate backhand toss to the
plate but there was no play as
Versalles scored. Perranoski was
charged with a wild pitch.
Big Eighth
The twins broke it wide open
in the eighth. A walk to Harmon
KiHebrew, a double by Allison
and an intentional walk to Frank |
Quilici following a balk loaded
the bases with two out. Kaat, a
dangerous hitter all season,
singled to center, scoring two j
more runs that put the game be- j
yond recall.
Kaat wavered momentarily in
the ninth. After striking out
Fairly, lie allowed a single by
Lefebvre and then hit Parker
with a pitch. But he bore down
and disposed of Roseboro for the
second out.
Dick Tracewski batted lor Bob
Miller, who replaced Perranoski
after Kaat's hit, and lined the
ball back to Kaat for the final |
out.
Great Catch
The big fielding play of the

day was a diving catch by Alli
son on a ball hit by Lofebvre
near the left field line in the
fifth. Fairly, who had opened the
fifth with ;i single, was on base
and would have scored easily if
Allison had not made his sensa
tional sliding stab.
In sharp contrast to the bril
liant fielding by the Twins, Gil
liam was charged with two er
rors. Left fielder Lou Johnson
fumbled Killebrew's single in
the fourth for the third error.
Gilliam threw wildly to first
after taking Nossek's grounder
in the seventh, after making the
big error in the sixth.

into the Series as T'u-.i favorites,
now face an uphill struggle.
Only the 1921 New York Giants,
the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers, and
the 1956 and 1958 New York
Yankees had overcome such a
back-breaking handicap.
Oliva's It KB
Tony Oliva, the American

League batting champ who had
gone hitless in six trips, knocked
in the first run off Koufax. He
doubled to left in the sixth after
Gilliam had let Versalles' shot
bounce off his glove and go
down the left field line for a
costly error.
Until Gilliam opened the door
with his misplay, Koufax and
Kaat were locked in a shutout
duel. Each had allowed only
three hits and Sandy, who set a
modern major league strikeout
record with 352 in the regular
season, had struck out eight in
five innings.
After Gilliam's error, Joe Nos
sek's sacrifice, the double by
Oliva and Killcbrew's single, the
Twins were never headed. They
had a chance to open the lead
wide!' but Koufax struck out Bob
Allison and made Don Mincher
ground out to end the sixth.
Squelched Threat
The big Dodger threat came in
the seventh when Ron Fairly
and Jim Lefebvre opened up on
Kaat with singles to left. Wes
Parker's sacrifice moved the
runners and Johnny Roseboro's
single to right scored Fairly.
With the score 2-1 and men on
second and third, Dodger Mana
ger Walter Alston called on
Drysdale, his top hitter with a
.300 average, as a pinch hitter.
Big Don went down swinging,
missing three straight pitches by

Ihe Minnesota left-hander. Wills
flied out, ending the threat.
Versalles hit his triple after
two were out in the seventh.
While Perranoski was pitching
to Joe Nossek, Boilo broke down
the baseline.
Ron hurried lus pitch and
bounced one into the dirt that
catcher John Roseboro blocked
but couldn't hold. Roseboro tried
a desperate backhand toss to the
plate but there was no play as
Versalles scored. Perranoski was
charged with a wild pitch.
Big Eighth
The twins broke it wide open
in the eighth. A walk to Harmon
KiHebrew, a double by Allison
and an intentional walk to Frank |
Quilici following a balk loaded
the bases with two out. Kaat, a
dangerous hitter all season,
singled to center, scoring two j
more runs that put the game be- j
yond recall.
Kaat wavered momentarily in
the ninth. After striking out
Fairly, lie allowed a single by
Lefebvre and then hit Parker
with a pitch. But he bore down
and disposed of Roseboro for the
second out.
Dick Tracewski batted lor Bob
Miller, who replaced Perranoski
after Kaat's hit, and lined the
ball back to Kaat for the final |
out.
Great Catch
The big fielding play of the

day was a diving catch by Alli
son on a ball hit by Lofebvre
near the left field line in the
fifth. Fairly, who had opened the
fifth with ;i single, was on base
and would have scored easily if
Allison had not made his sensa
tional sliding stab.
In sharp contrast to the bril
liant fielding by the Twins, Gil
liam was charged with two er
rors. Left fielder Lou Johnson
fumbled Killebrew's single in
the fourth for the third error.
Gilliam threw wildly to first
after taking Nossek's grounder
in the seventh, after making the
big error in the sixth.

modern major league strikeout
record with 352 in the regular
season, had struck out eight in
five innings.
After Gilliam's error, Joe Nos
sek's sacrifice, the double by
Oliva and Killcbrew's single, the
Twins were never headed. They
had a chance to open the lead
wide!' but Koufax struck out Bob
Allison and made Don Mincher
ground out to end the sixth.
Squelched Threat
The big Dodger threat came in
the seventh when Ron Fairly
and Jim Lefebvre opened up on
Kaat with singles to left. Wes
Parker's sacrifice moved the
runners and Johnny Roseboro's
single to right scored Fairly.
With the score 2-1 and men on
second and third, Dodger Mana
ger Walter Alston called on
Drysdale, his top hitter with a
.300 average, as a pinch hitter.
Big Don went down swinging,
missing three straight pitches by

Ihe Minnesota left-hander. Wills
flied out, ending the threat.
Versalles hit his triple after
two were out in the seventh.
While Perranoski was pitching
to Joe Nossek, Boilo broke down
the baseline.
Ron hurried lus pitch and
bounced one into the dirt that
catcher John Roseboro blocked
but couldn't hold. Roseboro tried
a desperate backhand toss to the
plate but there was no play as
Versalles scored. Perranoski was
charged with a wild pitch.
Big Eighth
The twins broke it wide open
in the eighth. A walk to Harmon
KiHebrew, a double by Allison
and an intentional walk to Frank |
Quilici following a balk loaded
the bases with two out. Kaat, a
dangerous hitter all season,
singled to center, scoring two j
more runs that put the game be- j
yond recall.
Kaat wavered momentarily in
the ninth. After striking out
Fairly, lie allowed a single by
Lefebvre and then hit Parker
with a pitch. But he bore down
and disposed of Roseboro for the
second out.
Dick Tracewski batted lor Bob
Miller, who replaced Perranoski
after Kaat's hit, and lined the
ball back to Kaat for the final |
out.
Great Catch
The big fielding play of the

day was a diving catch by Alli
son on a ball hit by Lofebvre
near the left field line in the
fifth. Fairly, who had opened the
fifth with ;i single, was on base
and would have scored easily if
Allison had not made his sensa
tional sliding stab.
In sharp contrast to the bril
liant fielding by the Twins, Gil
liam was charged with two er
rors. Left fielder Lou Johnson
fumbled Killebrew's single in
the fourth for the third error.
Gilliam threw wildly to first
after taking Nossek's grounder
in the seventh, after making the
big error in the sixth.
