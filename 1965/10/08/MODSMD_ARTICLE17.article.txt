# Stanford Ready To Face Oregon; Ducks Unbeaten With 3-0 Slate
## DAILY Sports 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford enters upon its first
important football weekend this
fall when the Oregon Webfoots
invade the Indian reservation at
a belated 3 p.m. On a hopeful
road to the Rose Bowl, Oregon
presents the initial roadblock.
This is the first conference
game of the year for the In
dians, but the main problem
may not be the opposition. In
juries are racking at the Stan
ford squad. The past two games
have claimed the services of co
eaptain Gary Pettigrew, flashy
back Boh Blunt, and linebacker
Glenn Meyers.
Meyers with a dislocated
shoulder, may play tomorrow;
the other two have had it for
the rest of the campaign. Quar
terback Dave Lewis will play
despite a bruised foot. X-rays
Wednesday proved to he nega
tive.
Oregon will cart an explosive
offense and a stubborn defense
into Stanford's gridiron arena.

Both Oregon and Stanford have
yet to tasle the acidity of do
feat. Oregon boasts conquests
over Pittsburgh, Utah, and
Brigham Young.
Torrid Trovato
Oregon's offense revolves
around Tom Trovato who thus
far is the conference total of
fense individual leader. On the
other hand Stanford as a squad
leads the conference in total de
fense. The Ducks' football ma
chine has averaged 412 yards
per game.
The backfield seems in a tur
moil as only Dennis Keller is
a certain starter at left half
back. Even Trovato could find
himself sitting out a bit of this
one. Mike Brundage proved his
worth against BYU and led the
Ducks to a 27-14 conquest.
On defense for the Webfoots
will be two outstanding per
formers, Dave Toby and Tim
Casey. Tobey last year was on
the AAWU first team by both
Associated Press and UPI. This
year he will face Stanford from
Ihc linebacker spot. Casey is the
leader of the defensive backfield.
He is a scrappy character who
relishes tackles which result in
fumbles by the opposition.
Oregon will be shooting for

its fifth straight victory at Stan
ford Stadium. The last time they
mot defeat was in 1955 by a
score of 44-7.
Another reminder to all those
who plan to attend this game
on Saturday: it begins at 3 p.m.
not the usual 1:30. The idea he
hind this is that you're sup
posed to watch the World
Series, then come to the game.
