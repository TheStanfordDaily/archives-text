# 'Pawnbroker' — An Outstanding Film
## 
### ROGER McDANIEL 
H's a rare but great thrill to
see an American film lhat shows
lhat cinema can be an art form
as well as an entertainment
medium. Sidney Lumet has done
this with "The Pawnbroker."
His direction and Rod Slei
ger's acting make this a superb
film experience. Lumet's art is
particularly obvious in the
flashbacks —often as short as
one frame- which connect the
present with the past in the
mind of Sol Lazerman, whom
Steiger portrays.
Lazerman was in a Nazi con
centration camp, and was tie

mendously changed by the emo
tional agony he went through
there, watching everyone's suf
fering, particularly his family's
- all of whom died. Now he is
insensitive to everyone else and
outwardly seems to have no feci
ings, though we arc continually
reminded that he is continually
reminded of his past and lhat
ho feels it deeply.
Traditional Values
Though his actions go against
our traditional values of respect
for others and concern for their
feelings, Lazerman is presented
sympathetically, because wc can
see the background of his reas
ons for acting as he does.
Perhaps he is trying to avoid
more sorrow by not allowing
himself to care about people;
perhaps he couldn't verbalize
his reasons if he tried. What
ever the reasons, his actions are
nevertheless intolerable. For
our sense of decency to be satis
fied and so that something will
happen in the film, he must
change.
This is the weakest point in
the film. It is not clear why
Lazerman should suddenly ex
press his feelings if he has not
done so for twenty years. De
mands are put upon him by the
vice king Rodriguez, played by
Brock Peters, for whom Lazer
man's shop is a front. He feels
guilty for not dying in the con
centration camp while so many
others did, and he is constantly
reminded of this guilt by his
mistress' father.
Incidents
Many incidents in his present
life remind him of the camp,'
his wife, and his children. But
these things have ostensibly
been going on ever since the
war. There is some significance
in the fact that it's the anivers
ary of something (it's never
made absolutely clear: probably
the day he and his family were

arrested), but this in itself does
not seem strong enough to
evoke the reaction he gives.
But Lazerman does respond.
Frightened by Rodriguez (in it
self an abrupt change, for not
admitting any feeling includes
not showing any fear), he
appeals out of loneliness to the
social worker (Geraldine Fitz
gerald) whose own loneliness he
had shunned.
Then he displays ihe courage
to die, challenging Rodriguez to
kill him and trying to get the
hoodlums who attempt to hold
up his shop to shoot him. only
to fail at this, as twenty years
before. Now it is his young
assistant Jesus Ortiz (Jaime
Sanchez) who gives his life for
Lazerman. But it is finally this
that brings out the tremendous
emotion from within Lazerman.
Contrast
A contrast is built up in the
film between Jesus, who is ac
tive and full of vitality, and
Lazerman, as between life and
death, and it is the final irony
that Jesus dies instead of Laz
erman. Jesus may be seen as
a Christ figure if y«u will: his
name, his representing life, his
sacrificing himself, a Jew's be
ing responsible for his death;
but if you won't it's not neces
sary. Symbolism is all right un
less it's too explicit. Naming the
character Jesus is a little too
explicit.
The flashbacks, mentioned
earlier, are extremely well done.
The film opens with an episode
in slow motion of Lazerman. his
wife and children, and his par
ents relaxing and playing in a
field — the scene is peaceful
and entirely pleasant.
Contrasted with this air the
flashbacks to the concentration
camp and the train taking the
prisoners there: the pictures are
very shocking and horrible, par-1

ticularly I hose of Lazerman be
ing forced to see the row of
rooms of women prisoners wait
ing to he used by I he guards —
ending with the room in which
ills wife sits.
Effective Segment*
Short segments of these pic
turps are related to present oc
currences very effectively: The
pictures cut suddenly back and
forth between a girl trying to
pawn a ring and guards remov

ing rings from prisoners' fin
gers; in one frame we see Laz
erman in a crowded subway car :
in the next we see a railroad
car full of Jewish prisoners. The
effect is sometimes one of eon
fusion aboul which picture you
are seeing at any particular in- ;
slant, thus relating the confus- !
ion of the past and present in
Lazerman's mind.

reminded of this guilt by his
mistress' father.
Incidents
Many incidents in his present
life remind him of the camp,'
his wife, and his children. But
these things have ostensibly
been going on ever since the
war. There is some significance
in the fact that it's the anivers
ary of something (it's never
made absolutely clear: probably
the day he and his family were

arrested), but this in itself does
not seem strong enough to
evoke the reaction he gives.
But Lazerman does respond.
Frightened by Rodriguez (in it
self an abrupt change, for not
admitting any feeling includes
not showing any fear), he
appeals out of loneliness to the
social worker (Geraldine Fitz
gerald) whose own loneliness he
had shunned.
Then he displays ihe courage
to die, challenging Rodriguez to
kill him and trying to get the
hoodlums who attempt to hold
up his shop to shoot him. only
to fail at this, as twenty years
before. Now it is his young
assistant Jesus Ortiz (Jaime
Sanchez) who gives his life for
Lazerman. But it is finally this
that brings out the tremendous
emotion from within Lazerman.
Contrast
A contrast is built up in the
film between Jesus, who is ac
tive and full of vitality, and
Lazerman, as between life and
death, and it is the final irony
that Jesus dies instead of Laz
erman. Jesus may be seen as
a Christ figure if y«u will: his
name, his representing life, his
sacrificing himself, a Jew's be
ing responsible for his death;
but if you won't it's not neces
sary. Symbolism is all right un
less it's too explicit. Naming the
character Jesus is a little too
explicit.
The flashbacks, mentioned
earlier, are extremely well done.
The film opens with an episode
in slow motion of Lazerman. his
wife and children, and his par
ents relaxing and playing in a
field — the scene is peaceful
and entirely pleasant.
Contrasted with this air the
flashbacks to the concentration
camp and the train taking the
prisoners there: the pictures are
very shocking and horrible, par-1

ticularly I hose of Lazerman be
ing forced to see the row of
rooms of women prisoners wait
ing to he used by I he guards —
ending with the room in which
ills wife sits.
Effective Segment*
Short segments of these pic
turps are related to present oc
currences very effectively: The
pictures cut suddenly back and
forth between a girl trying to
pawn a ring and guards remov

ing rings from prisoners' fin
gers; in one frame we see Laz
erman in a crowded subway car :
in the next we see a railroad
car full of Jewish prisoners. The
effect is sometimes one of eon
fusion aboul which picture you
are seeing at any particular in- ;
slant, thus relating the confus- !
ion of the past and present in
Lazerman's mind.
"The Pawnbroker" is one of'
the great American films. See it.
H's a rare but great thrill to
see an American film lhat shows
lhat cinema can be an art form
as well as an entertainment
medium. Sidney Lumet has done
this with "The Pawnbroker."
His direction and Rod Slei
ger's acting make this a superb
film experience. Lumet's art is
particularly obvious in the
flashbacks —often as short as
one frame- which connect the
present with the past in the
mind of Sol Lazerman, whom
Steiger portrays.
Lazerman was in a Nazi con
centration camp, and was tie

mendously changed by the emo
tional agony he went through
there, watching everyone's suf
fering, particularly his family's
- all of whom died. Now he is
insensitive to everyone else and
outwardly seems to have no feci
ings, though we arc continually
reminded that he is continually
reminded of his past and lhat
ho feels it deeply.
Traditional Values
Though his actions go against
our traditional values of respect
for others and concern for their
feelings, Lazerman is presented
sympathetically, because wc can
see the background of his reas
ons for acting as he does.
Perhaps he is trying to avoid
more sorrow by not allowing
himself to care about people;
perhaps he couldn't verbalize
his reasons if he tried. What
ever the reasons, his actions are
nevertheless intolerable. For
our sense of decency to be satis
fied and so that something will
happen in the film, he must
change.
This is the weakest point in
the film. It is not clear why
Lazerman should suddenly ex
press his feelings if he has not
done so for twenty years. De
mands are put upon him by the
vice king Rodriguez, played by
Brock Peters, for whom Lazer
man's shop is a front. He feels
guilty for not dying in the con
centration camp while so many
others did, and he is constantly
reminded of this guilt by his
mistress' father.

Effective Segment*
Short segments of these pic
turps are related to present oc
currences very effectively: The
pictures cut suddenly back and
forth between a girl trying to
pawn a ring and guards remov

ing rings from prisoners' fin
gers; in one frame we see Laz
erman in a crowded subway car :
in the next we see a railroad
car full of Jewish prisoners. The
effect is sometimes one of eon
fusion aboul which picture you
are seeing at any particular in- ;
slant, thus relating the confus- !
ion of the past and present in
Lazerman's mind.
"The Pawnbroker" is one of'
the great American films. See it.
H's a rare but great thrill to
see an American film lhat shows
lhat cinema can be an art form
as well as an entertainment
medium. Sidney Lumet has done
this with "The Pawnbroker."
His direction and Rod Slei
ger's acting make this a superb
film experience. Lumet's art is
particularly obvious in the
flashbacks —often as short as
one frame- which connect the
present with the past in the
mind of Sol Lazerman, whom
Steiger portrays.
Lazerman was in a Nazi con
centration camp, and was tie

mendously changed by the emo
tional agony he went through
there, watching everyone's suf
fering, particularly his family's
- all of whom died. Now he is
insensitive to everyone else and
outwardly seems to have no feci
ings, though we arc continually
reminded that he is continually
reminded of his past and lhat
ho feels it deeply.
Traditional Values
Though his actions go against
our traditional values of respect
for others and concern for their
feelings, Lazerman is presented
sympathetically, because wc can
see the background of his reas
ons for acting as he does.
Perhaps he is trying to avoid
more sorrow by not allowing
himself to care about people;
perhaps he couldn't verbalize
his reasons if he tried. What
ever the reasons, his actions are
nevertheless intolerable. For
our sense of decency to be satis
fied and so that something will
happen in the film, he must
change.
This is the weakest point in
the film. It is not clear why
Lazerman should suddenly ex
press his feelings if he has not
done so for twenty years. De
mands are put upon him by the
vice king Rodriguez, played by
Brock Peters, for whom Lazer
man's shop is a front. He feels
guilty for not dying in the con
centration camp while so many
others did, and he is constantly
reminded of this guilt by his
mistress' father.
Incidents
Many incidents in his present
life remind him of the camp,'
his wife, and his children. But
these things have ostensibly
been going on ever since the
war. There is some significance
in the fact that it's the anivers
ary of something (it's never
made absolutely clear: probably
the day he and his family were

arrested), but this in itself does
not seem strong enough to
evoke the reaction he gives.
But Lazerman does respond.
Frightened by Rodriguez (in it
self an abrupt change, for not
admitting any feeling includes
not showing any fear), he
appeals out of loneliness to the
social worker (Geraldine Fitz
gerald) whose own loneliness he
had shunned.
Then he displays ihe courage
to die, challenging Rodriguez to
kill him and trying to get the
hoodlums who attempt to hold
up his shop to shoot him. only
to fail at this, as twenty years
before. Now it is his young
assistant Jesus Ortiz (Jaime
Sanchez) who gives his life for
Lazerman. But it is finally this
that brings out the tremendous
emotion from within Lazerman.
Contrast
A contrast is built up in the
film between Jesus, who is ac
tive and full of vitality, and
Lazerman, as between life and
death, and it is the final irony
that Jesus dies instead of Laz
erman. Jesus may be seen as
a Christ figure if y«u will: his
name, his representing life, his
sacrificing himself, a Jew's be
ing responsible for his death;
but if you won't it's not neces
sary. Symbolism is all right un
less it's too explicit. Naming the
character Jesus is a little too
explicit.
The flashbacks, mentioned
earlier, are extremely well done.
The film opens with an episode
in slow motion of Lazerman. his
wife and children, and his par
ents relaxing and playing in a
field — the scene is peaceful
and entirely pleasant.
