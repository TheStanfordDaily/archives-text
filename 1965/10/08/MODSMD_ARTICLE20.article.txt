### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
Theater
DON JUAN IN HELL, Bernard Shaw's play about the great
lover, will open at The Playhonse in San Francisco on Sunday. As
a switch, the company will perform it in Concert Reading Style.
THE ILLEGITIMATE THEATER is still carrying on weekends >
at the Tangent. The idea is spontaneous, unrehearsed entertain- ;
ment; hopefully, though, it won't be too uninhibited,
THE SUBJECT WAS HOSES, wjsth its Broadway cast intact, ;
opens at the Geary in San Francisco on Monday. The play won the |
Pulitzer Prize, and the production won the New York Drama
Critics Award as the best offering of the season.
Films
HIGH NOON, otherwise known as The Definitive Western, is
Saturday's Tresidder film. It stars Gary Cooper, The Definitive
Westerner, and Grace Kelly, The Definitive Princess.
I
The old Friday film series at Tresidder has suddenly been j
resurrected, thanks to a Daily editorial, and tonight's offering is
LANZARILLO, a Spanish film with English subtitles, about which
nothing is known.
THE SEVEN FACES OF DR. LAO, starring The Seven Faces
of Tony Randall, is at the Flicks Sunday. Its aura of childlike inno- ;
cence and delicate fantasy may well be lost on the balcony cynics,
and on everybody else, for that matter.
HELP, says the Bijou, is what is playing until "Ship of Fools"
slips into her berth there. With it is THAT MAN FROM RIO.
Jean-Paul Belmondo, who needs no help —he was unanimously voted
Stud of the Century by Lagunita last year.
DARLING, with Julie Christie in the title role, is at the Fine
Arts. Tonight only, there will be a sneak preview to keep her com- •
pany down the broad path of sex arid more sex.
THE PAWNBROKER is at the Guild (see review on this page).
Possibly the greatest extravagance of all time is making its
um-teenth appearance around here. CLEOPATRA is bark, this time 1
at the Paris, of ail places. Spectacle-wise, it's a stunner; acting
wise, except for Rex Harrison, it's just one l>ig bust.
LAWRENCE OF ARABIA and THE GREAT ESCAPE are
back for another round, too, but there the comparison ends. They
have got to be the best double bill ever to come to the Park, qr
anywhere else, for that matter.
MARRIAGE ON THE ROCKS and THIRD I)AV are at the
Stanford. And all they're good for is showing everybody how lucky ;
they are to have "Lawrence" and "Escape" playing at the Park.
The Varsity is holding forth with THE IPCRESS FILE, where
in the hero-spj Jaughs at his impossible exploits right along with '
the audience. Also, and again in contrast to the James Bond's
(wherein ihe hero takes himself much too .seriously), Michael Caine
(who handles the Ipcress File) is less of a sexual athlete (the merit j
of which is debatable, anyway). The ultimate in innocuousness
accompanies "Ipcress," namely Doris Day in THE THRILL OF IT
ALL. Informed sources from all over campus report that "Ipcress"
shouldn't be missed; they also warn that "Thrill" should be avoided
like the plague, or Paly High girls, or some such thing.

Professor George Houle of the Music Department will direct 1
the RENAISSANCE-BAROQUE ENSEMBLE in a musical salute to
Dante, on the occasion of the 700 th anniversary of his birth, tonight
at 8:30 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, and that sentence was too long.
LOUIS ARMSTRONG and his All-Stars, as everyone must
know by now, are coming to Frost on Sunday at 2.
FULL MOON time has «)me again. All Stanford girls desiring
to become Stanford women should report to Memorial Church
about midnight on Sunday. A number of obliging Stanford men
will be there to perform the necessary functions.
