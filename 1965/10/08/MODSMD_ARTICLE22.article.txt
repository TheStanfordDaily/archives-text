# Quiet Success
## 
### 
A resolution ended quiet!) yesterday, not in defeat hut in legiti
macy, as President Sterling approved the amended Judicial Com
petence Bill.
The signing ol the agreement, and its subsequent ratification by
the Legislature, came as an anticlimatic conclusion to seven months
ol negotiation between the students, the faculty and the adminis
tration.
Each ol these constituencies is to be commended for their per
scverence on this issue. Particular note should he made of the en
lightened role the administration played. No one would be foolish
enough to suggest that the administration liked this bill; after all,
it emasculates the arbitrary power of the Dean of Students by es
tablishing an Appeals Board to review judicial decisions, it greatly
strengthens the authority of the student judiciary and allows the
student himself more rights before the judiciary, and it establishes
a Committee ol 15 (five students, five faculty members and five
administrators) to institutionalize the intra-community dialogue.
Yet after long discussions and numerous compromises, power w as
yieldedâ€”to the benefit of the University.
We join with Professor Benjamin Page, chairman ol the com
mittee which negotiated this agreement, in hoping that "the recent
discussions may have strengthened the rapport, respect, and mu
tual trust that should exist between students, faculty, and admin
istration at this I'niversitv.
