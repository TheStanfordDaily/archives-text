## 'Social Action' Editorial Stirs Visions Of Anti-Intellectualism 
### 
Editor, The Daily
Your editorial of October 6
has me conjuring images of uni
versity faculties composed en
tirely of various combinations
of eternal unmouldering John
Browns and politically conscious
Casey Stengels.
I am sympathetic with your
concern about the social role of
the university: but I hope that
the activism of the student left
does not, through a misunder
standing of the nature of the uni
versity, degenerate into a new
form of anti-intellectualism.
Whether Stanford ought to op
erate Ravenswood High is a
fairly complicated question, but
it should be clear, at any rate,
that the usefulness of the uni
versity does not he in its ability
to adapt itself to the immediate
needs of the society, as conceived
by SNCC, the NAM or Lyndon
Johnson. Student activists eon
fuse the aims of education by
sneering at the spirit of scholar
ship and detached inquiry.
The confusion derives from
the various roles that the uni
versity is presently playing:
• It provides a meeting ground
where students with social con
cerns can combine study and ac
tion;
• It provides a pool of special
ized and highly trained skills
which can be of direct and indi
rect use to the present needs of
the society;
• It provides a community in
which scholars, students, and in
tellectuals can learn the sciences
and arts of their civilization and
shape their political, moral, and
philosophical beliefs in an at
mosphere of detachment from
the pressures and prejudices of
immediate issues.
All of these functions arc use
ful. but the purpose of the uni
versity resides in the community
of scholarship. Talk about the
ivory tower — if we must, con
tinue to use that tiresome phrase
—as an evil and an enemy is
just more bourgeois distrust of
the mind.
One of the responsibilities of
the university is to provide an
ivory tower for those who need
it. This is not a plea for toler
ance. because one hopes for
something more than coexis
tence between intellectuals and
activists. Their relationship —
whether they come together in
an individual or in the commu
nity at large — ought to be co
operative.

• fc A Cavalier
Nonchalance"
Editor, Tin- Daily
Your editorial of October sixth
displayed a cavalier nonchalance
about the facts and problems of .

university relations to the com
munity.
Columbia and Chicago are
hardly great examples of uni
versity responsibility to the com
munity. Columbia is presently in
the process of buying out the en
tire Morningside Heights area,
displacing the poor who have
lived there for years, and elimi
nating Negroes and Puerto Rlc
ans from the area. The same is
true of Chicago. The Morning
side Heights community and
this includes the local Democrat
ic club is fighting the univer
sity tooth and nail in an attempt
to avoid being raped by Colum
bia planners. It's not a pretty
picture and certainly not &n ex
ample Stanford should follow.
Your attack on Stanford for
not immediately buying Ravens
wood High School is also pre
sumptuous. The Ravenswood sit
uation is hopelessly complex;
there are no easy solutions. It
is ludicrous to harangue Stan
ford for not bursting into the
muddle. It is worse to suggest
that Stanford emulate Columbia,
New York's most notorious slum
lord.
Your editorial seems to sug
gest that you believe the univer
sity has a kind of white man's
burden to help out the poor black
community — a kind of univer
sity colonialism which, by the in
flux of money and the Education
department, will solve that sim
ple problem, race relations.
Needless to say. the issues of uni
versity-community relations de
serve a less superficial and far
more thoughtful consideration.

• We Bundled This One
Editor, The Daily:
The article that appeared
(Thursday, Oct. 7' in The Daily
concerning the Stanford Book
store bears little structural
(italicise) resemblance to the ar
ticle that I wrote. It was incredi
bly and absurdly edited: para
graphs were left out, re-ar
ranged, and, in some rather im
portant areas, re-written. The
consequent product left the
reader with some serious mis
conceptions.
I, also, am guilty of some mis
statements which I would like
to clarify: a) the student does
not pay full price on non-educa
tional materials but receives the
normal 8 per cent discount on
these items; b) the average ex
penditure per year of the Stan
ford student quoted as $132 is
for books only, not "educational
materials;" c) it was the desire
of the 19-member faculty Board
of Directors fa fact which The
Daily left out) that, for the most
part, the Stanford Bookstore
would not become a department
store; d) the Stanford Bookstore
is still essentially a cooperative,
and, all considerations made, the
Stanford student is receiving as
good a "deal" as he did from the
Old Bookstore.
I do feel that the article that
appeared is an abortion of the
original copy, and that a disser
vice has been done to Mr. Kim
ball and the Stanford Bookstore.

Editor, The Daily
Note the article about BEER
BEER-BEER in issue dated Tues
day, Oct. sth of your Stanford
Daily. . . .
There seems to be a disparag
ing idea about this liquor sub
ject, adjacent and directly re
lated to law and order.
Stanford is a PRIVATE
PROPERTY.
Would students expect to en
ter a private dwelling that be
longed to someone else, and" tell
them how to serve liquors—and
when?
It seems to this writer, young
people have become prone to dis
respect age and experience—and
one day they too. will become old
and decrepit and think back
to what ninnies they were, when
very young, and students at
Stanford University, which had
and still has, the good of all stu
dents at heart, academically,
morally and spiritually. Throw
away your buckets of contempt
oil Ye ol Little Faith.
