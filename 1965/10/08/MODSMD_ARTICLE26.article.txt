# EDITOR'S NOTE
## 
### 
Our thanks to both of the
above-quoted letter writers, since
their criticism gives us a chance
to further explore and define the
relationship between Stanford
and the*community.
First, it should be noted that
neither the University of Chi
cago nor Columbia are in the
process of "buying out" their
surrounding areas. Chicago re
cently finished participating in
a $200 million urban renewal
project which renovated the en
tire neighborhood. No longer a
slum, this area is now integrated
both racially and economically.
At Columbia, an urban renewal
program has just been initiated
which will have the same effect.
Columbia cannot "buy out" any
one because the program -which
Columbia helped develop—pro
hibits any further campus ex
pansion in the next ten years.
We're sure the local Democratic
Club, as well as the local real
estaters, are quite upset about
this "rape" of their vested in
terest.
However, the examples of Chi
cago and Columbia were unfor
tunate. since the type of problem
they faced is not the same as
Stanford's. East Palo Alto is not
a Morningside Heights. It is a
small, predominantly black, low
income community in the midst
of a white, affluent mid-penin
sula. Thus, any Negro child ex
cluded from an experimental Ra
venswood High would not find
himself forced into another seg
regated school. And this, we
think, would benefit all residents
of the mid-peninsula.
Moreover, we do not wish the
University to rush out and buy
Ravenswood post-haste. We do
ho|re, though, that some consid
eration lo this possibility would
be given. It is not a revolution
ary idea — outside Stanford. For
example, at the present time,
there are several students at
tending this university who grad
uated from a Champagne-Ur
bana secondary school staffed by
the University of Illinois.
It is at this point that our out
raged friends above miss the
thrust of the editorial. Making
Ravensw ood High an experimen

tal school and expanding the cur
rently impoverished East Palo
Alto project are just two of an !
almost limitless number of pos-1
sibilrties open to the University, j
No one has said that tutorial j
and self-help projects will solve |
the race problem, but to call such
attempts "neo-colonialist" be
trays a rather vivid imagination. J
In the same vein, no one has sug- j
gested that we move the entire j
University down to East Palo j
Alto and turn every student into j
a full-time activist. (Indeed, ac
tivist is a rather strange term to
use for part of the educational
process. One is not educated by i
academic contemplation alone, t
Such absolutism ignores the j
fact that the mark of an edu
cated man and a great university
is diversity. Thus, if this Univer
sity can spend hundreds of thou
sands of dollars to redecorate
dormitories, renovate Math Cor- j
ners, construct fraternity clus
ters and build new Health Con- j
ters for those various constitu
encies. it should surely quicken
its PACE in meeting a commu
nity's need foi education and a
student's desire to educate both
himself and others.

S.L. :
Our thanks to both of the
above-quoted letter writers, since
their criticism gives us a chance
to further explore and define the
relationship between Stanford
and the*community.
First, it should be noted that
neither the University of Chi
cago nor Columbia are in the
process of "buying out" their
surrounding areas. Chicago re
cently finished participating in
a $200 million urban renewal
project which renovated the en
tire neighborhood. No longer a
slum, this area is now integrated
both racially and economically.
At Columbia, an urban renewal
program has just been initiated
which will have the same effect.
Columbia cannot "buy out" any
one because the program -which
Columbia helped develop—pro
hibits any further campus ex
pansion in the next ten years.
We're sure the local Democratic
Club, as well as the local real
estaters, are quite upset about
this "rape" of their vested in
terest.
However, the examples of Chi
cago and Columbia were unfor
tunate. since the type of problem
they faced is not the same as
Stanford's. East Palo Alto is not
a Morningside Heights. It is a
small, predominantly black, low
income community in the midst
of a white, affluent mid-penin
sula. Thus, any Negro child ex
cluded from an experimental Ra
venswood High would not find
himself forced into another seg
regated school. And this, we
think, would benefit all residents
of the mid-peninsula.
Moreover, we do not wish the
University to rush out and buy
Ravenswood post-haste. We do
ho|re, though, that some consid
eration lo this possibility would
be given. It is not a revolution
ary idea — outside Stanford. For
example, at the present time,
there are several students at
tending this university who grad
uated from a Champagne-Ur
bana secondary school staffed by
the University of Illinois.
