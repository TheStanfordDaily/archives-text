# LEGISLATURE, STERLING RATIFY REFORM OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM
## President Endorses Committee Of 15 
### 
The Legislature last night
unanimously ratified the com
promise judicial competence res
olution a few hours after Presi
dent Wallace Sterling put his
stamp of approval on the docu
ment.
The resolution is a modifica
tion of one approved last April
by a committee similar to the
ad hor group of students, facul
ty, and administrators which ap
proved the present resolution
last week
Sterling's assent came in the
form of a letter to ASSU Presi
dent Sandy Mackenzie and
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane.
LASSU also adopted a resolu
tion calling for the formation of
a Committee of Fifteen to deal
with the question of liquor on
campus, and authorized the
speaker to name five students to
serve on that committee.
Sterling has indicated that he
will appoint administrative rep
resentatives "as soon as the Leg
islature has amended the Judi
cial Competence Bill in conform
ance with the amended Resolu
t ion."
The By-laws changes men
tioned by Sterling were referred
to the By-laws committee of the
Legislature last night and arc
expected to come to a vote at
(he next meeting of the body.
A Resolution urging the Aca
demic Council to consider the ap
pointment of students as ex-offi
cio members of the eight com
mit ties of the Council also re
ceived unanimous approval from
the Legislature.
In other action, LASSU,
• Observed that the existing
open house policies are "clearly
inadequate" and established a
special sub-committee of the
LASSU Student Affairs Com
mittee to review both existing
and proposed policies.
• Designated the week of
October 11 as "Peace Corps
Week" on the Stanford Campus.
• Referred to Rules Commit
tee a proposed amendment alter
ing the duties of the Student
A 112 fa i rs Com mitt ec.
• Referred to Finance Com
mittee the proposed transfer of
$1000 to the Assistance Fund of

the Publications Board. The
money is earmarked for the fi
nancing of spontaneous publi
cations on the campus.
Surprisingly, the most vocif
erous debate of the evening came
on a resolution imploring the
football team to win all remain
ing games "in order that this
university might once again be
represented in the Rose Bowl."
Certain members of the Legis
lature, lead by off-campus rep
resentative Tim Haight, objected
that since the Rose Bowl is
clearly an off-campus issue, the
resolution could not be acted
upon by the Legislature.
The resolution finally passed
however by a vote of 34 to 23.
The Legislature approved
ASSU president Sandy Macken
zie's list of student nominees for
the eight Presidential Advisory
Committees. President Sterling
will choose the student mem
bers from among these students.
Six students, three of whom
will be selected by Sterling, were
nominated for the Student Af
fairs and Services Committee.
They are Thomas Sherman, Rob
ert Haas, Gordon Black. Mimi
Sherman, Donna Hughes and
Mackenzie.
Nominees for another impor
tant advisory committee, on
Public Exercises, are Stephan
Hogland, Robert Fcllmeth, Ker
ry Townsend, Barbara Ramsay,
John Matthias, and Robert Bur
roughs.

Surprisingly, the most vocif

on a resolution imploring the
football team to win all remain

resentative Tim Haight, objected
that since the Rose Bowl is
clearly an off-campus issue, the
resolution could not be acted
upon by the Legislature.
The resolution finally passed
however by a vote of 34 to 23.
The Legislature approved
ASSU president Sandy Macken

the eight Presidential Advisory

The Legislature last night
unanimously ratified the com
promise judicial competence res
olution a few hours after Presi
dent Wallace Sterling put his
stamp of approval on the docu
ment.
The resolution is a modifica
tion of one approved last April
by a committee similar to the
ad hor group of students, facul
ty, and administrators which ap
proved the present resolution
last week
Sterling's assent came in the
form of a letter to ASSU Presi
dent Sandy Mackenzie and
LASSU Speaker Jay Kadane.
LASSU also adopted a resolu
tion calling for the formation of
a Committee of Fifteen to deal
with the question of liquor on
campus, and authorized the
speaker to name five students to
serve on that committee.
Sterling has indicated that he
will appoint administrative rep
resentatives "as soon as the Leg
islature has amended the Judi
cial Competence Bill in conform
ance with the amended Resolu
t ion."
The By-laws changes men
tioned by Sterling were referred
to the By-laws committee of the
Legislature last night and arc
expected to come to a vote at
(he next meeting of the body.
A Resolution urging the Aca
demic Council to consider the ap
pointment of students as ex-offi
cio members of the eight com
mit ties of the Council also re
ceived unanimous approval from
the Legislature.
In other action, LASSU,
• Observed that the existing
open house policies are "clearly
inadequate" and established a
special sub-committee of the
LASSU Student Affairs Com
mittee to review both existing
and proposed policies.
• Designated the week of
October 11 as "Peace Corps
