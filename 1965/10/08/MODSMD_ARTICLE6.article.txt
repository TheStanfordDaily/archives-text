# AT COLORADO
## Troubles For Fraternities 
### 
University of Colorado (CU) regents by a 3-3
vote two weeks ago refused to lift a new-mem
ber ban abainst the campus chapter of Sigma
Chi fraternity.
The ban was originally imposed in May as
a result of the case at Stanford in which the
Alpha Omega chapter here was suspended from
the national organization after pledging a Negro
member.
The CU chapter was denied pledging or initi
ating privileges because regents said they be
lieve the national fraternity, with which the CU
chapter is affiliated, compels local chapters to
discriminate against minorities.
During an hour and a half meeting CU regents
reviewed the May action, and heard representa
tives of the local fraternity declare they intend
ed to be autonomous in the selection of mem
bers regardless of the national policy.
Three regents voted in favor of a motion to
lift the ban. One, Charles Bromley, said he felt
the CIJ regents made a "poor showing" when
compared to action taken at Stanford. Here, the
regents supported the local when it was sus
pended by the national.
However, Fred Bet/, who voted against the
motion, noted that the Stanford regents did
nothing to support Sigma Chi until after it had
been suspended.

"We'll do the same," he said.
Gene Lika, student consul for the CU chap
ter of Sigma Chi, said ho felt the local chapter
was victimized because the national and the
University have differing philosophies.
. . . and at Riverside
Fraternities and sororities on the University
of California's Riverside campus have been for
bidden to affiliate with national organizations, it
was disclosed Wednesday. The ban is the first
on any UC campus.
Riverside Chancellor Ivan Hinderaker said
that he will actively encourage purely local fra
ternities and other independent residential and
social groups. Riverside now has one local fra
ternity, and Hinderaker said the experience with
it has been favorable.
But he said, "There is reason to doubt that
national organizations leave their branches en
tirely free to choose members on their personal
merit without discrimination because of race,
religion or national origin."
Hindcraker's statement followed a vote by
the Riverside student government, a year ago
opposing both national and local fraternities.
