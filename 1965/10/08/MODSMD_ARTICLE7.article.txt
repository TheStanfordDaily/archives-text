# Collegiate Lethargy Prevails

### 
"The need is still to wake up students,
not to constrain them," reported Stanford
researcher Joseph Katz, and noted that only
a minority of college students is "actively
challenging our conventional notions of
society.'
Katz. research coordinator of the Insti
tute for the Study of Human Problems, pre
sented the results of a five-year study to
the American Council on Education in
Washington, D.C. yesterday. His study was
financed by grants totaling $270,0(H) from
the United States Office of Education and
the Danforth Foundation.
He said that on the whole, college is
dedicated to the training of independence
of minds and character, but actually "en
courages passive receptivity" in class and
study. As a result, colleges are "largely
unintellectual, thus mirroring our society."
Raised Academic Standards
He continued, "The post-Sputnik raising
of academic standards has primarily en
couraged higher giadegetting capacities. It
has secondarily encouraged the mentality
of the technician whose forte is specialized
competence. It has had small, and some
times negative, effects on the cultivation
ol general intelligence and intellectualily.''
The American college Judent is gen

erally passive "involvement in internation
al. national, or civic affairs and helping
other people are ranked astonishingly low."
He is instead interested in his "own in
dividual career and future family life."
Katz reported that the average student
described his future as a "suburban exist
ence which he considered rather routine.
To him. this was regrettable, but unavoid
able."
Reliance On Parents
Data from both questonaires and inter
views revealed a strong reliance on par
ents' views and beliefs. Parents have very
definite expectations as to appropriate be
havior, attitudes, and plans of their off
spring."
Most students take going to college for
granted, indicating "it was almost as na
tural and unavoidable as being born." Ac
cording to the study, a colege education
is regarded as providing "access to a better
job and higher income, and is conceived
as a prestigious club in which one acquires
friends, connections, a mate, and may also
have a good time."
Version of Anarchism
He noted that there is a minority of <iu
dents actively opposing the social order •>!
their parents. The protest ui this minority

"seems at times a new version of 'anarch
ism,' one that is quite related to old-fash
ioned 19th century American virtues of in
dividualism. II is an individualism coupled
with the search for affectionate community
and for the opportunity of expressing the
aesthetic and feeling parts of human na
ture more freely."
Katz cited the current student unrest as
a "symptom and a signal. If we heed it.,
the university can be more than a mirror
of society. It can assume the more lively
function of being one of the primary agen
cies for the renewal of society and for con
structive change."
lie offered three suggestions to accomp
lish this:
"One avenue is lo transform the large
society of the university into a series of
smaller, overlapping groups.
"Another is for the university to make
learning more meaningful . . . by relating
classroom work to the student's phase of
psychological development and to the many
unsolved social tasks In his environment.
"Thirdly, the university can give stu
dents more recognition for their efforts
and considerably more opportunity for ex
ercising responsibility and individuality in
their work."

their parents. The protest ui this minority

"seems at times a new version of 'anarch

ioned 19th century American virtues of in
dividualism. II is an individualism coupled
with the search for affectionate community
and for the opportunity of expressing the
aesthetic and feeling parts of human na
ture more freely."
Katz cited the current student unrest as
a "symptom and a signal. If we heed it.,
the university can be more than a mirror
of society. It can assume the more lively
function of being one of the primary agen
cies for the renewal of society and for con
structive change."
lie offered three suggestions to accomp
lish this:
"One avenue is lo transform the large
society of the university into a series of
smaller, overlapping groups.
"Another is for the university to make
learning more meaningful . . . by relating
classroom work to the student's phase of
psychological development and to the many
unsolved social tasks In his environment.
"Thirdly, the university can give stu
dents more recognition for their efforts
and considerably more opportunity for ex
ercising responsibility and individuality in
their work."
"The need is still to wake up students,
not to constrain them," reported Stanford
researcher Joseph Katz, and noted that only
a minority of college students is "actively
challenging our conventional notions of
society.'
Katz. research coordinator of the Insti
tute for the Study of Human Problems, pre
sented the results of a five-year study to
the American Council on Education in
Washington, D.C. yesterday. His study was
financed by grants totaling $270,0(H) from
the United States Office of Education and
the Danforth Foundation.
He said that on the whole, college is
dedicated to the training of independence
of minds and character, but actually "en
courages passive receptivity" in class and
study. As a result, colleges are "largely
unintellectual, thus mirroring our society."
Raised Academic Standards
He continued, "The post-Sputnik raising
of academic standards has primarily en
couraged higher giadegetting capacities. It
has secondarily encouraged the mentality
of the technician whose forte is specialized
competence. It has had small, and some
times negative, effects on the cultivation
ol general intelligence and intellectualily.''
The American college Judent is gen

erally passive "involvement in internation
al. national, or civic affairs and helping
other people are ranked astonishingly low."
He is instead interested in his "own in
dividual career and future family life."
Katz reported that the average student
described his future as a "suburban exist
ence which he considered rather routine.
To him. this was regrettable, but unavoid
able."
