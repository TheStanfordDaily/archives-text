Muses said tn (iod. 'If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, "the
God of your fathers has sent me to yrttt", and they ask mo, "what is His nanir?" what
hall 1 -ay to them?' (lod said to Moses, 'I AM WHO 1 AM', and lie said, 'Say to
tin- people of Israel, "1 AM has sent you" . . . the Lord llod of your fathers, the God
of \braham, the God of Isaac, and the (iod of Jacob, has sent you: this is my name

Our En dish word "Jehovah" is the well-established rendering nf the Hebrew ,
"YIIWH" which is derived from the verb "to be", l itis name of Ciod was so sacred
I to the Jews that it was not to be uttered aloud. The word "Adonai" (Lord, Master)
i I was substituted when speaking of "YIIWJl" or "Jchova".
It was an angel who told Mary and Joseph that their child was to be called
I "Jesus" (Luke 1:31, Matthew 1:18-25), The name "Jesus" i> the Greek rendering
I of the Hebrew word "Joshua" or "Je-hoshua" which means "Jehovah Savior".
What disturbed the religions leaders of His da\ was not the name "Jesus", but
I that claims which Jesus Christ made to be God. The Jewish priests were shocked
and outraged when Jesus said that Me was the very same unutterable "I AM" who
I met with Moses and the burning bush and who had called Abraham to lead his
I people.
|i-us Christ made other startling claims for Himself which linked Him directly
I with the Jehovah God of the Old Testament. He said, "I </»/ the bread of life. This
I is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die"
I (John 8:48-50); "/ am the light of the world. He who follows ine will not walk in
I darkness, but will have the light of life" (John 8:1 !). "I th< d shepherd, the
I mill shepherd lays down His life for His sheep" (John 10:11); "I am the resurrection
| and the life, lie who believes in me though he die. yet shall he live, and whoever lives
I and in me shall never die" (John 11 :25>: "/ am the way, the truth, and Ihc
I life; no man comes to the Father but by me" (John 11:6): '1 am the vine, you are
I the branches . . . apart from me you can do nothing" (John 15:5).
W hat Jesus Christ claimed and asserted, that He was in fact Cod. is either
■ literally and accurately true or He committed blasphemy. Why not discover the truth
I for yourself. Find out by asking God directly Who lie is. I'ermit llim to show
Himself to you as Jehovah, the great I AM. the Lord Jesus Christ, "the same yes-
I tcrday, today, and forever" (Hebrews 13:8).
