# Teaching Hong Kong Kids In Rooftop School
## 
### HOPE SELBY 
Editor's note: Twenty-six students spent five
weeks last summer on a work project in Hong
Kong*. Tile project, under the auspices of the
World University Service, was led by Dwlght
Clark, former assistant Dean of Men at Stan
ford. During the afternoons and evenings the
group worked in Methodist and Lutheran
schools in refugee resettlement housing hloes.
The following was written in Ilong Kong.

Scores of kids raced up stairs in plastic
sandals and squatted on dirt-streaked balconies
when I first came to Wang Tau Horn, a
refugee resettlement housing project on the
edge of Ilong Kong's urban Kowloon district.
For most of them, the stairs are only a
slippery place to play tag among the trash
clinging to the wet cement. For them, the
stairs lead only to higher balconies, where
women, dressed in black, string beads or gos
sip as they fan themselves in the midsummer
afternoon heat.
The thousands of them who are crowded
into ilong Kong's refugee resettlement areas
live in a world of concrete. Their homes are
single rooms less than the size of an American
kitchen; their playgrounds the cement stairs
and balconies in seven story buildings, each
housing over 4200 people.
Penthouse Schoolroom
But for a few of the children, the stairs

lead to a penthouse—the three rooms stuck
like a matchbox on top of the building where
they go in the afternoons for games and group
trips.
I worked for five weeks on this roof, in
the school and recreation center sponsored by
the Methodist Church, with another Stanford
senior. I was a combination camp counselor
and English teacher for forty kids between
the ages of eight and fourteen.
We assisted Miss Anita Lin Sun Law, the
22-year-old Chinese social worker who is
recreation director of the center.
The Oral-Aural Method
It wasn't easy at first. I was teaching
English to the youngest group of children,
third graders who had studied only a little of
the language before.
Since the only words I knew in Cantonese
were "thank you" and "good morning,"
1 doubted that I'd be able to teach them any
thing.
We began with the colors. 1 held up a
piece of colored chalk and said "green" over
and over again until the little boys caught
on and started growling the word back at me.
The girls just sat there and giggled, too shy to
say anything.
Kali! Kali! Kali!
After a while, however, everyone got into
tlu' act, and the room sounded like the junior

routers section at a football game as I held
up different pieces of chalk.
But this was only the beginning, and the
problems that came up in later classes often
seemed insurmountable. The first one to arise
was that of simply keeping order in the class.
The kids had already learned to write
English letters. As they copied the things T
wrote on tlu- blackboard, they often left their
seats and ran around the room, screaming and
laughing as they checked up on their friends.

After two classes like this, 1 decided it was
time to learn a few basic verbs.
Sit Down!
"Sit down!" I screamed over the noise,
and sat down right in the middle of the dusty
floor. "Sit down," I said again and pointed at
one of the boys. When he returned to his seat
and the others followed him. I knew a major
battle had been won.
There were other less academic battles. I
fought my way through yards of snarled
thread when teaching embroidery to the girls.
I strained my voice up two octaves to reach
their range when teaching them American
songs. And I always seemed to be the loser in
every game we played together.
It was discouraging at times, and often I
was sure that I wasn't doing the slightest
thing to help solve the overwhelming prob
lems of the refugees in Hong Kong.
Parents With No Education
But one day I stayed after the session to
talk with Miss Law. As the children ran in and
out of the center's tiny office, she told me
more about their background and I began
to understand why the rooftop school existed
at all.
"The main problem with these kids," she
said, "is their parents. Since they have little or
no education themselves, they can't see the
value in it for their children."
1 learned that most of them lived on

junks and sampans before being resettled in
Wang Tau Horn by the British government.
Most of the men now earn tHo equivalent of
$2.00 a day as coolies or factory workers,
leaving their wives at home to care for t
children.
Too Many Kills
But there arc five to six kids in the aver
age Wang Tau Horn family, and the mothers
often become discouraged at the problems ot
raising that large a brood in such cramped
quarters. Many give up and turn to male
johng, often losing much of their husband's
salary as they gamble and gossip with their
friends.
The kids are left to the concrete, and often
drop out of primary school to form delinquent
gangs.
These children may well never leave the
concrete of Wang Tau Horn, even when they
grow up and work in the small factories and
shops on the ground floor of the buildings in
the area.
Hupe For The Future
But the chances are good that the rooftop
kids will not grow up like their parents. With
further education, their lives will not be lim
ited to mah-.johng and coolie labor. With job
training, they may survive the stiff competi
tion for skilled jobs in Hong Kong and some
day work in the city.

But there arc five to six kids in the aver
age Wang Tau Horn family, and the mothers
often become discouraged at the problems ot
raising that large a brood in such cramped
quarters. Many give up and turn to male
johng, often losing much of their husband's
salary as they gamble and gossip with their
friends.
The kids are left to the concrete, and often
drop out of primary school to form delinquent
gangs.
These children may well never leave the
concrete of Wang Tau Horn, even when they
grow up and work in the small factories and
shops on the ground floor of the buildings in
the area.
Hupe For The Future
But the chances are good that the rooftop
kids will not grow up like their parents. With
further education, their lives will not be lim
ited to mah-.johng and coolie labor. With job
training, they may survive the stiff competi
tion for skilled jobs in Hong Kong and some
day work in the city.

Editor's note: Twenty-six students spent five
weeks last summer on a work project in Hong
Kong*. Tile project, under the auspices of the
World University Service, was led by Dwlght
Clark, former assistant Dean of Men at Stan
ford. During the afternoons and evenings the
group worked in Methodist and Lutheran
schools in refugee resettlement housing hloes.
The following was written in Ilong Kong.

Scores of kids raced up stairs in plastic
sandals and squatted on dirt-streaked balconies
when I first came to Wang Tau Horn, a
refugee resettlement housing project on the
edge of Ilong Kong's urban Kowloon district.
For most of them, the stairs are only a
slippery place to play tag among the trash
clinging to the wet cement. For them, the
stairs lead only to higher balconies, where
women, dressed in black, string beads or gos
sip as they fan themselves in the midsummer
afternoon heat.
The thousands of them who are crowded
into ilong Kong's refugee resettlement areas
live in a world of concrete. Their homes are
single rooms less than the size of an American
kitchen; their playgrounds the cement stairs
and balconies in seven story buildings, each
housing over 4200 people.
Penthouse Schoolroom
But for a few of the children, the stairs

lead to a penthouse—the three rooms stuck
like a matchbox on top of the building where
they go in the afternoons for games and group
trips.
I worked for five weeks on this roof, in
the school and recreation center sponsored by
the Methodist Church, with another Stanford
senior. I was a combination camp counselor
and English teacher for forty kids between
the ages of eight and fourteen.
We assisted Miss Anita Lin Sun Law, the
22-year-old Chinese social worker who is
recreation director of the center.
The Oral-Aural Method
It wasn't easy at first. I was teaching
English to the youngest group of children,
third graders who had studied only a little of
the language before.
Since the only words I knew in Cantonese
were "thank you" and "good morning,"
1 doubted that I'd be able to teach them any
thing.
We began with the colors. 1 held up a
piece of colored chalk and said "green" over
and over again until the little boys caught
on and started growling the word back at me.
The girls just sat there and giggled, too shy to
say anything.
Kali! Kali! Kali!
After a while, however, everyone got into
tlu' act, and the room sounded like the junior

routers section at a football game as I held
up different pieces of chalk.
But this was only the beginning, and the
problems that came up in later classes often
seemed insurmountable. The first one to arise
was that of simply keeping order in the class.
The kids had already learned to write
English letters. As they copied the things T
wrote on tlu- blackboard, they often left their
seats and ran around the room, screaming and
laughing as they checked up on their friends.

After two classes like this, 1 decided it was
time to learn a few basic verbs.
Sit Down!
"Sit down!" I screamed over the noise,
and sat down right in the middle of the dusty
floor. "Sit down," I said again and pointed at
one of the boys. When he returned to his seat
and the others followed him. I knew a major
battle had been won.
There were other less academic battles. I
fought my way through yards of snarled
thread when teaching embroidery to the girls.
I strained my voice up two octaves to reach
their range when teaching them American
songs. And I always seemed to be the loser in
every game we played together.
It was discouraging at times, and often I
was sure that I wasn't doing the slightest
thing to help solve the overwhelming prob
lems of the refugees in Hong Kong.
Parents With No Education
But one day I stayed after the session to
talk with Miss Law. As the children ran in and
out of the center's tiny office, she told me
more about their background and I began
to understand why the rooftop school existed
at all.
"The main problem with these kids," she
said, "is their parents. Since they have little or
no education themselves, they can't see the
value in it for their children."
1 learned that most of them lived on

junks and sampans before being resettled in
Wang Tau Horn by the British government.
Most of the men now earn tHo equivalent of
$2.00 a day as coolies or factory workers,
leaving their wives at home to care for t
children.

It was discouraging at times, and often I
was sure that I wasn't doing the slightest
thing to help solve the overwhelming prob
lems of the refugees in Hong Kong.
Parents With No Education
But one day I stayed after the session to
talk with Miss Law. As the children ran in and
out of the center's tiny office, she told me
more about their background and I began
to understand why the rooftop school existed
at all.
"The main problem with these kids," she
said, "is their parents. Since they have little or
no education themselves, they can't see the
value in it for their children."
1 learned that most of them lived on

junks and sampans before being resettled in
Wang Tau Horn by the British government.
Most of the men now earn tHo equivalent of
$2.00 a day as coolies or factory workers,
leaving their wives at home to care for t
children.
Too Many Kills
But there arc five to six kids in the aver
age Wang Tau Horn family, and the mothers
often become discouraged at the problems ot
raising that large a brood in such cramped
quarters. Many give up and turn to male
johng, often losing much of their husband's
salary as they gamble and gossip with their
friends.
The kids are left to the concrete, and often
drop out of primary school to form delinquent
gangs.
These children may well never leave the
concrete of Wang Tau Horn, even when they
grow up and work in the small factories and
shops on the ground floor of the buildings in
the area.
Hupe For The Future
But the chances are good that the rooftop
kids will not grow up like their parents. With
further education, their lives will not be lim
ited to mah-.johng and coolie labor. With job
training, they may survive the stiff competi
tion for skilled jobs in Hong Kong and some
day work in the city.

Editor's note: Twenty-six students spent five
weeks last summer on a work project in Hong
Kong*. Tile project, under the auspices of the
World University Service, was led by Dwlght
Clark, former assistant Dean of Men at Stan
ford. During the afternoons and evenings the
group worked in Methodist and Lutheran
schools in refugee resettlement housing hloes.
The following was written in Ilong Kong.

Scores of kids raced up stairs in plastic
sandals and squatted on dirt-streaked balconies
when I first came to Wang Tau Horn, a
refugee resettlement housing project on the
edge of Ilong Kong's urban Kowloon district.
For most of them, the stairs are only a
slippery place to play tag among the trash
clinging to the wet cement. For them, the
stairs lead only to higher balconies, where
women, dressed in black, string beads or gos
sip as they fan themselves in the midsummer
afternoon heat.
The thousands of them who are crowded
into ilong Kong's refugee resettlement areas
live in a world of concrete. Their homes are
single rooms less than the size of an American
kitchen; their playgrounds the cement stairs
and balconies in seven story buildings, each
housing over 4200 people.
Penthouse Schoolroom
But for a few of the children, the stairs

lead to a penthouse—the three rooms stuck
like a matchbox on top of the building where
they go in the afternoons for games and group
trips.
I worked for five weeks on this roof, in
the school and recreation center sponsored by
the Methodist Church, with another Stanford
senior. I was a combination camp counselor
and English teacher for forty kids between
the ages of eight and fourteen.
We assisted Miss Anita Lin Sun Law, the
22-year-old Chinese social worker who is
recreation director of the center.
The Oral-Aural Method
It wasn't easy at first. I was teaching
English to the youngest group of children,
third graders who had studied only a little of
the language before.
Since the only words I knew in Cantonese
were "thank you" and "good morning,"
1 doubted that I'd be able to teach them any
thing.
We began with the colors. 1 held up a
piece of colored chalk and said "green" over
and over again until the little boys caught
on and started growling the word back at me.
The girls just sat there and giggled, too shy to
say anything.
Kali! Kali! Kali!
After a while, however, everyone got into
tlu' act, and the room sounded like the junior

routers section at a football game as I held
up different pieces of chalk.
But this was only the beginning, and the
problems that came up in later classes often
seemed insurmountable. The first one to arise
was that of simply keeping order in the class.
The kids had already learned to write
English letters. As they copied the things T
wrote on tlu- blackboard, they often left their
seats and ran around the room, screaming and
laughing as they checked up on their friends.

After two classes like this, 1 decided it was
time to learn a few basic verbs.
Sit Down!
"Sit down!" I screamed over the noise,
and sat down right in the middle of the dusty
floor. "Sit down," I said again and pointed at
one of the boys. When he returned to his seat
and the others followed him. I knew a major
battle had been won.
There were other less academic battles. I
fought my way through yards of snarled
thread when teaching embroidery to the girls.
I strained my voice up two octaves to reach
their range when teaching them American
songs. And I always seemed to be the loser in
every game we played together.
