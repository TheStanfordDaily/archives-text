## Twins Wreck Dodgers 
### BOB THIERIOT 
The Minnesota Twins' famed
power completely overcame the
Dodgers' pitching in a six-run
third inning Wednesday, as the
Twins rolled over the Dodgers
in the first game of the 19(35
World Series, 8-2.
Led by 7xn\o Versalles three
nm-homer off Don Drysdale,
the Twins collected six hits, a
walk, and a vital Dodger error.
Rookie Frank Quilici a .208 hit
ler led off Ihe inning with a line
double down ihe third base line.
Pitcher Jim Grant followed
with a bunt back to Drysdale,
who fell down and left a divot.
Big Error
His throw to first was in
time, but Wes Parker juggled
it for an error. Versalles ripped
a shoulder high pitch into the
newly-constructed seals in left
field for three runs. Sandy Val
despino rocketed a double off
the right field screen. Killebrew
singled through the infield.
Drysdale recovered somewhat,
lie struck out Jimmy Hall, alter
having gone to a 3-0 count, but
then walked Mineher. With the
bases loaded, Earl Battey plop
ped a single into right for 6-1,

and Quilici, who starled the
whole thing, singled for 71.
Bye-Bye Don
Walter Alston finally came to
the realization that Drysdale
was getting unmercifully bomb
ed, and ihe manager went out
to retrieve his fallen warrior.
Howie Reed ended the carnage
by getting Grant to ground out
on the first pitch.
Four of the runs were un
earned in the inning because of
Parker's error. But the Twins
had triumphed in this episode
of power versus pitching.
The Dodgers opened the scor
ing in the second inning in a
very unusual fashion for them.
Fairly hit a 370 foot home run
over ihe right field barrier. This
gave the Dodgers a very short
lived one run advantage. Don
Mineher promptly erased the
lead with a similar home run in
the bottom of the second.
Zoilo's Vow
The Twins rounded out their
scoring in the sixth against Jim
Brewer. Grant doubled, and Ver
salles drove him home with his
second hit. Backing-up his vow
to run on the Dodger pitchers,
Versalles stole second even
though Roseboro had called for
a pitchout.

The Dodgers rallied for their
final tally in the ninth on sin
gles by Parker, Lefevbre, and a
two out bunt single by Wills.
Asked about reports that tele
vision viewers had the impres
sion Grant was spitting on the
ball before some pitches, Mele
said, "Well, we got the impres
sion thai Drysdale was using a
spit tor. If they can get away
with it, what's ihe difference."
Tomorrow the Dodgers send
out Sandy Koufax <20-8i to face
Jim Katt (1811). The series
will then switch to Los Angeles
with games Saturday and Sun
day. Other games will be played
if necessary.
The line score for the first
game:
Dodgers 010 000 001—2 10 1
Twins 016 001 OOx—B 10 0
Drysdale, Heed (3), Brewer (5),

The Minnesota Twins' famed
power completely overcame the
Dodgers' pitching in a six-run
third inning Wednesday, as the
Twins rolled over the Dodgers
in the first game of the 19(35
World Series, 8-2.
Led by 7xn\o Versalles three
nm-homer off Don Drysdale,
the Twins collected six hits, a
walk, and a vital Dodger error.
Rookie Frank Quilici a .208 hit
ler led off Ihe inning with a line
double down ihe third base line.
Pitcher Jim Grant followed
with a bunt back to Drysdale,
who fell down and left a divot.
Big Error
His throw to first was in
time, but Wes Parker juggled
it for an error. Versalles ripped
a shoulder high pitch into the
newly-constructed seals in left
field for three runs. Sandy Val
despino rocketed a double off
the right field screen. Killebrew
singled through the infield.
Drysdale recovered somewhat,
lie struck out Jimmy Hall, alter
having gone to a 3-0 count, but
then walked Mineher. With the
bases loaded, Earl Battey plop
ped a single into right for 6-1,

and Quilici, who starled the
whole thing, singled for 71.
Bye-Bye Don
Walter Alston finally came to
the realization that Drysdale
was getting unmercifully bomb
ed, and ihe manager went out
to retrieve his fallen warrior.
Howie Reed ended the carnage
by getting Grant to ground out
on the first pitch.
Four of the runs were un
earned in the inning because of
Parker's error. But the Twins
had triumphed in this episode
of power versus pitching.
The Dodgers opened the scor
ing in the second inning in a
very unusual fashion for them.
Fairly hit a 370 foot home run
over ihe right field barrier. This
gave the Dodgers a very short
lived one run advantage. Don
Mineher promptly erased the
lead with a similar home run in
the bottom of the second.
Zoilo's Vow
The Twins rounded out their
scoring in the sixth against Jim
Brewer. Grant doubled, and Ver
salles drove him home with his
second hit. Backing-up his vow
to run on the Dodger pitchers,
Versalles stole second even
though Roseboro had called for
a pitchout.

The Dodgers rallied for their
final tally in the ninth on sin
gles by Parker, Lefevbre, and a
two out bunt single by Wills.
