# Whither Culture?
## 
### 
A casual glance at the quarter's calendar of
events shows that campus organizations have
seemingly set aside Fridays for frivolity: Grad
uate Happy Hours, TGlF's, visits to the New
Cellar under the Women's Clubhouse, and here
and there a concert. Noticeably absent is the
Friday Night Tresidder Film Series. Though it
never attracted the vociferous masses of Sunday
night flick fame, series of art films was well
attended and proved to be one of the few op
portunities for regular doses of on-campus cul
ture.
The Tresidder Union Board, which makes
the arrangements for the film series, decided last
spring to eliminate the Friday night programs in
order to avoid conflicts with the Stanford Jazz

Year performances. The present Jazz Year sched
ule calls for only two Friday night events.
The film series in recent years had featured
many excellent foreign and domestic films, in
cluding the works of Bergman and Coeteau.
Often deep in meaning, the films were chosen
to provoke discussion rather than quips.
In light of the 'aesthetic gap' thus opened, we
strongly urge the Tresidder Union Board —
which convenes this week — to revive the Friday
night series. At a time when the Administration
is trying to create a more intellectual atmos
phere, especially in Wilbur, we believe that stu
dent organizations such as the Tresidder Board
should encourage cultural activities at Stanford.
The revival of the Friday night Series will be a
step in this direction.
