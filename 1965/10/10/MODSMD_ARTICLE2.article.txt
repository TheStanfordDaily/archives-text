• Vatican Views liomhs And liirth Control
VATICAN CITY — A view favored by many U.S. bishops that
the Roman Catholic Church approve nuclear arms for defense ran
into stiff opposition in the Vatican Ecumenical Council yesterday.
At the same time a document giving bishops an unprecedented
share of authority with the Vatican won final approval.
The bishops also heard the Church law against contraception
openly challenged as out of date.
Bishop Francis Simons spoke of "a grave obligation to arrest
the growth in population." He made no direct mention of the Pope's
U.N. speech, but what he said sounded like a contrast to the
pontiff's words that the United Nations should try to increase the
world's food supply rather than favor artificial birth control.
"In the present state of the question," said Bishop Simons, "the
sense and binding force of the law prohibiting all artificial means
of birth control are open to doubt; and. according to our basic
juridieial principles, a law on whose meaning grave doubt exists is
not binding."
