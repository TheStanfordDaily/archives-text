## Daily Plasterer 'Carrolled'

Editor, The Daily
Tn answer (or more accurately
in response) to a recent letter
complaining that "The Meek
Shall Inherit a Cold Hambur
ger," with apologies to Lewis
Carroll, Chester Berry, and the
meek.
T'was brumby, and the West
ern Civs
Did Mem and Flo about
LASSU
All bristly with pejoratives
The Daily plasters T.M.U.
I*oor boy! Dost feel that all
tlie meek
Inherit only hamburgers cold?
And. though one might wait

out t he week
Woulds't likely starve, and
ne'er grow old?
Beware the center grille my
son!
The arms that grab, the Jaws
that snap!
And tried potatoes (French)
Oh shun!
Lest Alpine House be filled
to cap.
Nay —make thy way unto
the right
Where salads swarm, and
things "an gratin."
(The chowder, served on
Fridays. MIGHT
Be better "Boston" than

"Manhattan."
No need to thirst, nor stand
about —
♦lust dart to where the tin-cow
beckons
(IVe found I can get in :uid
out
In slightly under ninety
seconds.)
T'was bruiiehy, and the
Western Civs
Did Mem and Flo about
LASSU
All bristly with pejoratives
