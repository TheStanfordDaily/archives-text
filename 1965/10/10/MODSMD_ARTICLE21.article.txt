## Communist Line Hardens Despite Escalation Policy 
### Walter Lippmann 
The success of the American buildup in South Viet Nam has
been very considerable when we measure it by what so many in
formed people feared last June. The Viet Cong has not been able
to smash the Saigonese army, to cut the country in half, and in this
military disaster to bring about the overthrow of the government

in Saigon. There is reason to
think that the size and power of
the American forces has dis
couraged or prevented the Viet
Cong from mounting big
enough battles to win a victory
over the Saigonese.
Yet, things have not come out
as men hoped they would. They
allowed themselves to think
that a demonstration of our
ability to build up a great Am
erican force which could not be
defeated would compel or per
suade the Viet Cong and Hanoi
to agree to a negotiated settle
ment. Quite the contrary has
happened. The position of the
Viet Cong and Hanoi today is
even harder than it was last
spring.
Scornful Adversaries
Why, as we have put
more and more of the best
troops we have into South Viet
nam, as we have escalated the
violence of our attacks, have
our adversaries become ever
more scornful of our proposals
to negotiate?
My own belief is that they are
convinced that, while the Ameri
cans cannot be defeated, the
Americans cannot win the war
on the ground. This, however, is
where the war has to be won, in
the villages of South Viet Nam,
and that is where the struggle
will in the end be decided.
The essential fact, which is
beginning to seep through the
dispatches of some of the Amer
ican correspondents, is that
while the Americans can seize
almost any place they choose to
attack, the Viet Cong will almost,
surely come back once the Am
ericans leave.
Punching Water
The War in Viet Nam is like
punching a tub full of water.
We can make a hole with our
powerful fist wherever we
punch the water. But once we
pull back our hand, possibly
to punch another hole in the
water, the first hole disappears.
In theory, ihe Saigonese army
ought to fill the hole, ought to
occupy and pacify the places we
seize. But the Saigonese army
is not able to do this because
it is too small and too war
weary.
It is too small because the vil
lages, which ait? the reservoir of
available manpower, are for the
most part Viet Cong in their
sympathies or are terrorized by
the Viet Cong. The Saigonese
army is too disillusioned and
has too little morale to occupy
territory which the Americans
have seized. What remains of
the Saigonese army has little
enthusiasm for the revolving
politicians in Saigon.
There are some Republican
politicians who think that this
mess can bo disentangled or
ended by bombing the industrial,
and therefore populated, centers
>>! Hanoi and Haiphong. The
President, fortunately, has re
sisted the temptation to make
the war a total war and thus to
make it a general Asian war.
Viet Coiiff Not Intimidated
In any event, our adversaries
in the Viet Cong and in Hanoi
show no signs of being intimi
dated by the possibility of total
war. The Viet Cong in the South
are already receiving the full
treatment, of total war by our
area bombing, and the North
Vietnamese do not value their
material possessions, which are
few, nor even their lives, which
are short and unhappy, as do
the people of a country who

have much to lose and much to
live for.
Our adversaries, moreover,
have time to wait, time to re
treat, to hide and to live to fight
another day. So we shall be
forced 1o face the fact that in
order to win the war in South
Viet Nam we shall have to oc
cupy South Viet Nam with Am
erican troops. A few months
ago Mr. Hanson Baldwin, the
military correspondent of the
New York Times, called for a
million men for Vict Nam. It
sounded fantastic* at the time
in light of what President John
son was saying about not want
ing a wider war. But it is be
ginning to look very much as
if Mr. Baldwin had made an
informed and realistic estimate
of what a military solution
would require.
The situation has become so
tangled that: no clear and de
cisive solution is for the present
conceivable. The President is no
nearer the negotiated settle
ment which he has hoped to
bring about. Nor, as a matter
of fact, is the administration
truly resolved to negotiate in
a sense that it is prepared, even
in its private thinking, to make
the concessions that any success
ful negotiation is bound to call
for.
'Sporadic', Low-Grade War
Failing the prospect of a set
tlement, the President has man
aged to obtain the assent of
most of the country to the kind
of war we are fighting — a
sporadic, low-grade war carried
on chiefly by a professional Am
erican army. There is no im
mediate prospect of big battles
with big casualties because the
Viet Cong, so it would seem,
has withdrawn into guerrilla
warfare. Against the kind of
force we have in Vietnam, guer
rilla warfare cannot win a vic
tory» But neither can the guer
rillas be defeated decisively and
put out of business.
If we cannot or will not escal
ate the war until we have an
enormous army which can occu
py the country, our best course
is to dig in along the coast and
begin to discuss with the Viet
namese politicians the forma
tion of a government in Saigon
which can negotiate a truce in
the civil war. This course will
not please the majority of ihe
President's current advisers.
But with all due respect to
them how do they propose to
win this war, specifically, what
size of American army are they
prepared to draft and put into
Indo-China? For the war is not
going to be won by punching
the water.
