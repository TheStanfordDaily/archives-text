Council and the other perman
ant committees of the real Un
ited Nations.
All of these groups will oper
ate with the aid of Stanford
Students who will serve in exec
utive and administrative capaci
ties, as well as participating in
the actual discussions and de
bates of the session.

involved will deal with actual
problems facing the UN today
and, in the process, gain for
themselves a better understand

international tensions.

UN is the Stanford United Na
tions. This campus group gives
more than 300 students the op
portunity to learn how the UN
functions while defending the
policies of a foreign country in
mock UN sessions.

series of events in preparation
for a student General Assembly
to be held in December. Among
them are a reception for the
consuls of San Francisco, meet
ings of the members of various
power blocs, and debates in a
mock Security Council.
