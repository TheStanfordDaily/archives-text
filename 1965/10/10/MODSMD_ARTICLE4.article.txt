# LASSU To View By-laws
## 
### 
The Legislature, in its first
meeting of the year tonight, will
once again begin consideration
of judicial competence.
The meeting will begin at 7:30
p.m. in Room 161J of the Law
School.
LASSU is expected to give ap
proval to the compromise reso
lution agreed upon last week by
an ad hoc committee of students,
faculty, and administrators. A
proposed ASSU Bylaws change,
encompassing the recommenda
tions of the resolution, will be
introduced, but cannot be acted
upon until next week.
Since President J. E. Wallace
Sterling is expected to announce
his approval of the compromise
resolution sometime today, and
since the Executive Committee
of the Academic Council has al
ready passed the measure, Legis
lature acceptance will mark the
final act of ratification.
The proposed resolution will
substantially revise the student
judicial system, granting more
power to student courts and es
tablishing a temporary faculty
Appeals Board while details of a
permanent student-faculty Ap
peals Board are worked out. The
resolution also provides for a
Committee of 15, composed of
five members from administra
tion, faculty and students, "to
discuss University problems and
policies" and hopefully recom
mend solutions to their various
constituencies.
The Legislature will also con
sider ASSU President Sandy
Mackenzie's recommendat ions
for student members on the
Presidential Advisory Commit
tees.
Two other resolutions will be
presented. The first will ask com
mittees of the Academic Coun
cil to include students in their
membership. Another resolution,
to be introduced by Ken Mala
vos, will encourage the football
team on to greater glory.
