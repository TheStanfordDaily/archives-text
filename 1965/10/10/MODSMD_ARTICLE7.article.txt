## Efficient But Expensive 
### PELL FENDER 
The average Stanford student spent $132 on
educational materials at the Bookstore during
the academic year 196.)-65, according to the
June 11 issue of Publisher's Weekly. Average
expenditure at other universities, with the ex
ception of Stanford and three others, was
The Bookstore moved into its present quar
ters in May, 1960. The old Bookstore, housed
in what is now the Reserved Book Room, em
ployed 15 people and, according to William A.
Kimball, manager of the present store, was
"totally inefficient." From 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. dur
ing the "rush" periods, students lined up for a
block, three abreast, to obtain class books.
No Self-Service
There was no self-service; paperbacks wen
available only insofar as a course demanded
them; and the facilities were crowded.
Differences between Ihe new and the old
Bookstore operated on a rebate system, with
Boowstore operated on a rebate system, with
profits shared annually with the students. In
asmuch as the Bookstore was then a profit or
ganization, the profits, depending on financial
success during Ihe year, reached as high as 2<s
per cent of a student's receipts, Kimball told
the Daily.
In the old Bookstore conditions might have
been archaic, inefficient, and basically insuf
fjeieiil, but the student received a discount
which was, on Ihe average, much higher than
is Ihe ca.e presently.

This is because the Bookstore is no longer a
true cooperative.
Stanford Wins Suit
In 1960, a pending 12-year suit against the
Internal Revenue Service was won by Stanford.
The Bookstore became exempt from paying fed
eral and state income taxes on its profits. The
rebate, under the legal change from a profit
to a non-profit organization, was stopped.
The Internal Revenue Service did, however,
allow an <S per cent discount at the time of pur
chase. Students Mill pay full price for non-edu
cational materials.
The students do not participate in the prof
its of the Bookstore directly. Expanded person
nel i now over 50Â», a much wider range of non
text titles, a greater selection of non-educational
merchandise, property taxes, rent paid to the
University, maintenance, and gardening work
prohibit a larger discount.
.SI Million Volume
There is, however, a profit at the end of
the year. Total book volume for the year 196-1-
H.") was $1,043,328, acording to Kimball. Im
mediate use of the assets will go toward re
arrangement of the first floor, enlargement of
the foreign-book section, and new check-out
stands.
Tn the more nebulous planning stage is a.
new building to be juxtaposed to the quad
rangle of the new Undergraduate Library,
which will deal onl\ with non-academic mer
chandise. The present quarters will then be
received for boukt, only.
