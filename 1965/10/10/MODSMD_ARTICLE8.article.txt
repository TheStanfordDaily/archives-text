# Living Groups Review Rush
## New Policy Would Affect Fraternities, Clubs, Stern 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
A new rush policy for upper
classmen's Jiving groups was
taken up last night by the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC > in its
first meeting of the year.
The new policy, which will af
fect fraternities, eating clubs
and independent houses, was
first proposed during spring
quarter last year by an ad hoc
committee appointed by Associ
ate Dean of Students Robert
Gordon.
Nine persons, including repre
sentatives from the faculty and
student living groups, served on
the committee.
The IFC was the first of sev
eral living group councils to be
gin official discussion of the pro
posed system of rush. Copies of
the ad lioe committee's recom
mendations were given to each
IFC representative at last
night's meeting, and IFC Presi
dent Rob Freeman urged that
each house study the rush pro
posals before the next IFC meet
ing, when the policy will be
voted on.
"I think the policy is very
good," Freeman said. He espe
cially commended the changed
bid system for removing "the de
cision for formal pledging to the
dormitory, where the freshman
can theoretically make a less
harried and more rational choice.
However, Freeman criticized
the proposed appeals board as
being unnecessary.
The ad hoc committee which
discussed the rush policy last:
spring was chaired by Prof. Carl
Stewart. The committee's report
noted that its purpose primarily
was to prepare "a realistic set of.
guidelines for the coming year."
The report said, perhaps more
fundamental changes in rush
should be explored, and it was
recommended to Dean Gordon
that the committee be perpetu
ated in order to provide continu
ity from year to year and to ex
plore rush more carefully.

Here are the basic recommen
datons of last spring's ad hoc
committee lor a rushing pro
gram:
• A University-susidized publi
cation, edited by student living
group representatives and Wil
bur associates, should be mailed
to each freshman student's
home during Christmas vaca
tion. This publication would de
scribe all living-group possibili
ties.
• An orientation meeting
should be scheduled winter quar
ter in which living group repre
sentatives would participate.
• A second booklet should tie
prepared winter quarter provid
ing hints for rushing and rush
regulations. Individual houses or
clubs could insert one-page
descriptions of their groups.
• No contact between fresh
men and uppcrclassmen should
be allowed anywhere during fall
quarter with regard to living
groups.
• A maximum of three open
houses should be scheduled h\
different types of li\ing groups
at I lie end ol " inter quarter. AX

ter the* first open house, open
contact should be allowed on
campus anytime outside Wilbur
and during set hours in Wilbur.
• There should bo open con
tact spring quarter on campus.
Contact in Wilbur, however,
should be limited in hours. No
contact should be allowed in Wil
bur five days after bids are
given.
• Bids may be extended in
written form.
• Enforcement ul' rush rules
should bo by living group judic
ial councils. An appeals board of
representatives from all groups
and from the faculty, however,
may review all cases.

campus anytime outside Wilbur
and during set hours in Wilbur.
• There should bo open con
tact spring quarter on campus.
Contact in Wilbur, however,
should be limited in hours. No
contact should be allowed in Wil
bur five days after bids are
given.
• Bids may be extended in
written form.
• Enforcement ul' rush rules
should bo by living group judic
ial councils. An appeals board of
representatives from all groups
and from the faculty, however,
may review all cases.
A new rush policy for upper
classmen's Jiving groups was
taken up last night by the Inter-
Fraternity Council (IFC > in its
first meeting of the year.
The new policy, which will af
fect fraternities, eating clubs
and independent houses, was
first proposed during spring
quarter last year by an ad hoc
committee appointed by Associ
ate Dean of Students Robert
Gordon.
Nine persons, including repre
sentatives from the faculty and
student living groups, served on
the committee.
The IFC was the first of sev
eral living group councils to be
gin official discussion of the pro
posed system of rush. Copies of
the ad lioe committee's recom
mendations were given to each
IFC representative at last
night's meeting, and IFC Presi
dent Rob Freeman urged that
each house study the rush pro
posals before the next IFC meet
ing, when the policy will be
voted on.
"I think the policy is very
good," Freeman said. He espe
cially commended the changed
bid system for removing "the de
cision for formal pledging to the
dormitory, where the freshman
can theoretically make a less
harried and more rational choice.
However, Freeman criticized
the proposed appeals board as
being unnecessary.
The ad hoc committee which
discussed the rush policy last:
spring was chaired by Prof. Carl
Stewart. The committee's report
noted that its purpose primarily
was to prepare "a realistic set of.
guidelines for the coming year."
The report said, perhaps more
fundamental changes in rush
should be explored, and it was
recommended to Dean Gordon
that the committee be perpetu
ated in order to provide continu
ity from year to year and to ex
plore rush more carefully.

Here are the basic recommen
datons of last spring's ad hoc
committee lor a rushing pro
gram:
• A University-susidized publi
cation, edited by student living
group representatives and Wil
bur associates, should be mailed
to each freshman student's
home during Christmas vaca
tion. This publication would de
scribe all living-group possibili
ties.
• An orientation meeting
should be scheduled winter quar
ter in which living group repre
sentatives would participate.
• A second booklet should tie
prepared winter quarter provid
ing hints for rushing and rush
regulations. Individual houses or
clubs could insert one-page
descriptions of their groups.
• No contact between fresh
men and uppcrclassmen should
be allowed anywhere during fall
quarter with regard to living
groups.
• A maximum of three open
houses should be scheduled h\
different types of li\ing groups
at I lie end ol " inter quarter. AX

contact should be allowed on
