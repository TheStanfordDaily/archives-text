THE WAY TO WORLD PEACE
Famed and eminent British historian Arnold J. Toynbee declared recently that civilization
he* reached the point where the very continuity of the human race depends upon the
formation of world government. "It is the mutual interest of the nations to subordinate
their national sovereignty to world authorities," he said, "This is the only condition on
which the nations can survive in an atomic age.
In the light df world developments it is inteiesting to consider the words of Jesus Christ.
About two thousands years ago the Prince of Pecic» told His followers You will hear
of wars and rumors of wars; see that you are not alarmed for this must take place, but
the end is not yet, For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against l -ingdom, and
there will be famines and earthquakes in various places; all this is but the beginning of
sufferings ..." (Matthew 24:1-8)
According to the Bible, history's darkest hour lies yet ahead, a period of destruction
and death far exceeding the toll and travail of two world wars. From this holocaust only
a few will ho saved.
Those who seek to bring about peace on earth should acquaint themselves with God s
ways and methods, for His great purpose in pre*ent times is to call, out of a lost and
dying world, a group of people to Himself (Acts I5:I3-18).
The Kingdom of God begins with changed human hearts through peisonally icceivmg
Jesus Christ as Lord. Jesus Christ, who came to bring peace to men, also made it clear
He was on earth to divide and to separate men (Matthew 10 13-34 25:11-46)
God s solution to the problem ot world peace is to silently and invisibly change men s
lives by transforming them from within. Those who meet and receive Jesus Christ have no»
only the peace of God here and now, but look expectantly and confidently to the day when
His program for world peri e has fully come.
TheiV is only one effective way you can work for world i eci< e and that is by accepting
God's plans cin<l methods. Commit your life to Jesus Christ and become His instrument of
righteousness rind His avenue of expression in a warring world whose rebellion is basically
against God alone.
