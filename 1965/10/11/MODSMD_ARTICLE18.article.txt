"This was one thr.t we wanted
to win in the worst way," grin
ned Head Coach John Ralston.
Mr leaned back in his chair, tak
ing a quick sip from the glass
of ade in his hand. "The squad
kept battling back; they
wouldn't be beaten at any time."
It had been one of those games
typical of Stanford this season:
undulating, extremely precari
ous, with excitement constantly
on the rise right up until the fi
nal gun. In Ralston, the tense
emotion of the game would not
soon wear off.
Right then, sitting in a room
in Encina gym surrounded by
newsmen, he was bubbling with
joy and enthusiasm. "Can't say
enough about our defensive
coaches," Ralston reflected,"
"Rust, Walsh, and Gambold
they won the ball game if any
one did. They spent hours and
hours going over the films, cov
ering every point, in preparation
for the game. It was our best

defensive effort so far. It sei the
boys up for those touchdowns."
"Offensively, we had had a
good half last week," said the
coach referring to the Air Force
game. "It featured Lewis run
ning. We need that. Lewis would
have run a Lot (today), but
couldn't."
Quarterback Lewis bruised the
instep of his right foot during
the contest with Air Force. This
nol only kept him from keeping,
but also from punting. Lewis
had been leading the AAWU
with an average punt of 44
yards
"Oregon is a hard-hitting
team", Ralston continued, "They
play real tough. They're well
coached."
While the Indians struggled
Southern Cal was shutting out a
powerful Washington squad 34-
0. Coach Ralston admitted that
he was surprised at this score.
"If they can go up there and
shut out Washington, they've
got a great varsity team."
Southern Cal. which looms as
the major roadblock in Stan
ford's way to conference laurels

and the Rose Bowl, will host the
Indians nexi Saturday. "We'll
need our best attack to beat
them," the coach confirmed.
Then he added "Our coaches
have plenty of material on USC;
we'll go over that," Stanford has
had members of the coaching
staff at the last two Southern
Cal games gathering info.
In view of the injuries plagu
ing the rndians, Ralston was
asked if any serious injuries de
veloped from the Oregon game.
"These kind of things creep up,"
responded Ralston, "and you
never know what might show up
at Monday morning practice."
The possibility of a serious in
jury from Saturday's game, how
ever, is almost negligible.
Stanford's reputation for stag
ing gridiron thrillers has become
an increasing source of interest
among reporters and enthusiasm
among fans. With respect to
next week's crucial contest.
Coach John Ralston nodded
hopefully and said "We'd like to
do it once more."

"Offensively, we had had a
good half last week," said the
coach referring to the Air Force
game. "It featured Lewis run
ning. We need that. Lewis would
have run a Lot (today), but
couldn't."
Quarterback Lewis bruised the
instep of his right foot during
the contest with Air Force. This
nol only kept him from keeping,
but also from punting. Lewis
had been leading the AAWU
with an average punt of 44
yards
"Oregon is a hard-hitting
team", Ralston continued, "They
play real tough. They're well
coached."
While the Indians struggled
Southern Cal was shutting out a
powerful Washington squad 34-
0. Coach Ralston admitted that
he was surprised at this score.
"If they can go up there and
shut out Washington, they've
got a great varsity team."
Southern Cal. which looms as
the major roadblock in Stan
ford's way to conference laurels

and the Rose Bowl, will host the
Indians nexi Saturday. "We'll
need our best attack to beat
them," the coach confirmed.
Then he added "Our coaches
have plenty of material on USC;
we'll go over that," Stanford has
had members of the coaching
staff at the last two Southern
Cal games gathering info.
In view of the injuries plagu
ing the rndians, Ralston was
asked if any serious injuries de
veloped from the Oregon game.
"These kind of things creep up,"
responded Ralston, "and you
never know what might show up
at Monday morning practice."
The possibility of a serious in
jury from Saturday's game, how
ever, is almost negligible.
Stanford's reputation for stag
ing gridiron thrillers has become
an increasing source of interest
among reporters and enthusiasm
among fans. With respect to
next week's crucial contest.
Coach John Ralston nodded
hopefully and said "We'd like to
do it once more."

"This was one thr.t we wanted
to win in the worst way," grin
ned Head Coach John Ralston.
Mr leaned back in his chair, tak
ing a quick sip from the glass
of ade in his hand. "The squad
kept battling back; they
wouldn't be beaten at any time."
It had been one of those games
typical of Stanford this season:
undulating, extremely precari
ous, with excitement constantly
on the rise right up until the fi
nal gun. In Ralston, the tense
emotion of the game would not
soon wear off.
Right then, sitting in a room
in Encina gym surrounded by
newsmen, he was bubbling with
joy and enthusiasm. "Can't say
enough about our defensive
coaches," Ralston reflected,"
"Rust, Walsh, and Gambold
they won the ball game if any
one did. They spent hours and
hours going over the films, cov
ering every point, in preparation
for the game. It was our best

defensive effort so far. It sei the
boys up for those touchdowns."
