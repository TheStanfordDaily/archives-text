• Right-iving Winning In Turkish Elections
ANKARA, Turkey — The rightwing Justice Party swept ahead Monday
in returns from yesterday's general election and appeared headed for a land
slide victory.
Jubilant leaders predicted the Justice Party would win more than 250
out of the 150 seats in the National Assembly. Political newcomer Suleyman
Demirel, 41, an American-trained engineer who took over the party's control
a year ago, was expected to be named prime minister.
An official of the opposition Republican Peoples Party conceded that
Justice Party politicians had made a 'surprising showing" and would win at
least a plurality. With half the votes counted, the Justice Party appeared to
be winning in nearly all 67 provinces.
Demirel and his party's candidates campaigned chiefly on anti-commun
ism, charging the Republicans with being soft on communism and the newly
organized Turkish Workers' Party with being Communist-infiltrated. Officials
estimated that about 80 per cent of Turkey's 13,649,000 registered voters cast
ballots.

• Right-iving Winning In Turkish Elections
ANKARA, Turkey — The rightwing Justice Party swept ahead Monday
in returns from yesterday's general election and appeared headed for a land
slide victory.
Jubilant leaders predicted the Justice Party would win more than 250
out of the 150 seats in the National Assembly. Political newcomer Suleyman
Demirel, 41, an American-trained engineer who took over the party's control
a year ago, was expected to be named prime minister.
An official of the opposition Republican Peoples Party conceded that
Justice Party politicians had made a 'surprising showing" and would win at
least a plurality. With half the votes counted, the Justice Party appeared to
be winning in nearly all 67 provinces.
Demirel and his party's candidates campaigned chiefly on anti-commun
ism, charging the Republicans with being soft on communism and the newly
organized Turkish Workers' Party with being Communist-infiltrated. Officials
estimated that about 80 per cent of Turkey's 13,649,000 registered voters cast
ballots.
