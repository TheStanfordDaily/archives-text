# DEFENSE SPARKLES IN 17-14 WIN OVER DUCKS
## 
### HUGH WEST 
Stanford's Indians look a rosy
step forward by defeating the
Oregon Ducks Saturday 17-14
on the strength of a late drive
culminated by a 9 yard TD pass
on fourth down from Dave
Lewis to Fergus Flanagan.
Lewis had kept the drive alive
on a series of third and fourth
down clutch plays.
The final drive started on the
Stanford 45 yard line. Two com
plete passes carried the Indians
to the Oregon 36. With 3rd and
9 Lewis passed lo Conrad for
a first down on the 23. With 4th
and 10 after three incomplete
passes, Stanford was penalized'
5 yards for delaying.
Big Break
Then came the big break of
the game: Lewis threw for Mike
Connelly on the Oregon nine.
The pass was well overthrown,
but Les Palm right defensive
halfback interfered. After three
plays gained nothing, Lewis ,
completely alone ath the one
tossed to Flanagan who was
completely alone at the one
for the winning TD.
If the Tribe offense sputtered,
the Defense proved why ii is the
best in the West. Oregon Quar
terback Tom Trovanto, who had
guided the Webfoots to the top
of the AAWU offensive stand
ings, must have thought he was
behind the floodgates ol' the
Mighty Soo.
Trovanto and his mates in the
back field were so manhandled
by a forward wall lead by A 1

Wilburn and Mike Hibler, that
they netted -9 yards in the first
half on the ground and a
meager 23 for the g?me,
A sticky pass defense kept
Trovato to fumble on the Ore
that department.
Oregon had been averaging
411 yards per game, but yes
terday all they could gather was
a mere 158. The defense forced
Trovanto to fumble on the Ore
gon 6, and Bill Ogle recovered,
setting up a DeSylvia field goal
for a 10-7 Stanford lead.

Stanford threatened first mid
way in the fist quarter, driving
from their own 20 to the Ducks'
30, until their progress was sty
mied.
Then, with 1:35 left in the
second quarter, it happened.
Stanford safety Dale Rubin took
a punt on his own twenty, re
turned it to the 30 and . . . .
fumbled. The Ducks drove to the
nine, and on a third down situa
tion Trovato lofted a pass to
halfback Scott Cress, who was
all alone in a corner of the end

/.one. Scholl's kick for the extra
point was good to make ihe
score 7-0.
The Indians came hack fired
up in the second half, and Rubin
got a chance to redeem himself.
With play barely begun, he re
lumed a punt 48 yards to the
Oregon 12. Two plays later,
Sophomore End-Tackle Blaine
Nye caught a 14 yard Lewis
pass and squirmed his 235
pound frame across the goal
line.
But fate did not smile on the
Indians for long. An intercepted
pass and a key pass interference
call brought about a 58 yard
touchdown drive for the Web
foots. Mike Brundage passed to
Steve Bunker on the two-yard
touchdown play. Scholl's kick
was good.
The Indians came back for the
hectic 55-yard drive in the final
minutes which included time
outs, unnecessary plays from
the line, and â€” By Jove! a key
pass interference call.
It could only have ended on
a tackle eligible play.
