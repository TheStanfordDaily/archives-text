Spectacular Running
Walter Alston's Dodgers prac
tically ran the Twins out of the
ball park with their daring base
running and bunting as they
took the extra base on hits and
forced the American League
champs into errors.
Six of ihe Dodgers' eight sin
gles off Mudcat Grant, the los
er, A 1 Worthington and Bill
Pleis never left the infield.

Three of them were base hit
bunts by Wes Parker, Lou John
son and John Roseboro.
Just to show they also can
powder the ball, the Dodgers
matched the Twins with home
runs by Parker and Johnson.
Harmon Killebrew and Tony
Olivia, the Twins' big sluggers,
slammed homers off Drysdale.
At the end of the fourth game
the Dodgers were hitting at a
healthy team average of .280
with *10 hits in three of the

Wills Starts It Off
Maury Wills set the pattern of
this game early when he sent
a roller to first baseman Don
Mincher who hesitated for a
second and finally threw late to
the bag as second baseman
Frank Quiliei and Wills collided.
After Jim Gilliam flied out.
Wills stole second on tho second
pitch to Willie Davis and sped
to third when Davis also beat
out a chop to Mincher. The
Twins' first baseman first de
cided to try to beat Davis to
the bag after fielding the ball
and then threw too late to
Grant.
When Ron Fairly forced Davis
at second, Wills sped home as
the Twins failed to complete the
double play.

Parker, a superb hunter,"
opened the Dodger second with
a beautiful drag bunt single to
Quiliei. Parker stole second on
the third pitch to Roseboro ant'
went all the way to third as the
head for a wild pitch.
Roseboro's ground ball went
through Quiliei for an error,
scoring Parker.
Wills got his second hit, a
chopper over the head of the
charging KiHebrew at third, to
open the third inning. He didn't
score this time as he was
thrown out trying to steal.
After Killebrew put the Twins
back in the game with a 100-foot
homer into the left field pavilion
in the fourth, the Dodgers came j
right hack with their first burst \
of power. Parker ripped into a !
Grant pitch and drove it deep i
into the pavilion in right field.
Drysdale rolled along with j
that 3 1 edge until Oliva, the |
slumping American League bat- j
ting champion, hit his first
homer since Aug. 13, a smash j
into the right field pavilion I
over the 380-foot mark in the
sixth.
Challenged by this sudden i
display of muscle, the Dodgers j
turned on the speed again andj

When Ron Fairly forced Davis
at second, Wills sped home as
the Twins failed to complete the
double play.
