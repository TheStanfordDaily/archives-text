# Cooperation Needed On Rush Policy
## 
### 
Fraternities meet tonight at regular house
meetings, and most will discuss a rush policy
proposed at last week's lnterfraternity Council
(IFC).
Stanford prides itself in offering undergradu
ate men three types of on-campus living groups:
fraternity, eating club, and independent house.
I lowever, such diversity poses problems of selec
tion, and each years the University gropes for a
rush policy that provides equity to the three
groups while guaranteeing a choice to the fresh
men themselves.
This year Dean Robert Gordon wisely lumped
organize an ad hoc committee of faculty and liv
ing group representatives to explore rush and
offer minor or major changes. Living group selec
tion is a matter that affects the entire University,
and thus representatives from all segments of
the community have a right to regulate and en
force the system of rush that takes place.
The committee's recommendations made this
summer are sound ones, and the nine persons
who served on the committee are to lx* praised
fov one of the most complete investigations of
rush ever made.
Unfortunately, the committee's efficiency has
not been equaled in the implementation of the
recommended rules by the Dean of Students of
fiee. The committee recommended to Dean Gor
don that each living group council go over the
proposed rush policy. The councils supposedly
could propose changes before accepting the rush
policy.
Yet Dean (Gordon has made 110 official move of

submitting the committee's recommendations to
the councils. Furthermore, the Dean himself
seems unclear as to who has the final authority
to put the rules into effect.
Last week the IFC informally took up the acl
hoc committees rush policy, and IFC president
Rob Freeman, while endorsing most of the rush
rules, opposed the idea of an appeals board to
enforce the policy.
"When the fraternity houses meet tonight to
vote on the rules, hopefully they will realize that
those who institute law must also have the power
of enforcing that law. Although the fraternities
were represented in drawing up the rush policy,
they were only one segment of the ad hoc com
mittee. And so while the fraternities should con
tinue to have the judicial power of trying cases
of "dirty rush," final authority must remain with
a judicial board representing the entire Univer
sity.
The appeal board would have representatives
from Wilbur, the three upperclassmen's resi
dence types and the faculty. Because all are af
fected by rush, they certainly should have judi
cial power.
IFC representatives are to be commended for
opening discussion of rush so swiftly. How they
act on the recommendations of the ad hoc com
mittee will set an example for the other living
group councils. Cooperation among the fraterni
ties, eating clubs, and independent houses is long
overdue, and hopefully the fraternities will dem
onstrate responsibility to all segments of the Uni
versity when they vote on the rush policy.

seems unclear as to who has the final authority
to put the rules into effect.
Last week the IFC informally took up the acl
hoc committees rush policy, and IFC president
Rob Freeman, while endorsing most of the rush
rules, opposed the idea of an appeals board to
enforce the policy.
"When the fraternity houses meet tonight to
vote on the rules, hopefully they will realize that
those who institute law must also have the power
of enforcing that law. Although the fraternities
were represented in drawing up the rush policy,
they were only one segment of the ad hoc com
mittee. And so while the fraternities should con
tinue to have the judicial power of trying cases
of "dirty rush," final authority must remain with
a judicial board representing the entire Univer
sity.
The appeal board would have representatives
from Wilbur, the three upperclassmen's resi
dence types and the faculty. Because all are af
fected by rush, they certainly should have judi
cial power.
IFC representatives are to be commended for
opening discussion of rush so swiftly. How they
act on the recommendations of the ad hoc com
mittee will set an example for the other living
group councils. Cooperation among the fraterni
ties, eating clubs, and independent houses is long
overdue, and hopefully the fraternities will dem
onstrate responsibility to all segments of the Uni
versity when they vote on the rush policy.

Fraternities meet tonight at regular house
meetings, and most will discuss a rush policy
proposed at last week's lnterfraternity Council
(IFC).
Stanford prides itself in offering undergradu
ate men three types of on-campus living groups:
fraternity, eating club, and independent house.
I lowever, such diversity poses problems of selec
tion, and each years the University gropes for a
rush policy that provides equity to the three
groups while guaranteeing a choice to the fresh
men themselves.
This year Dean Robert Gordon wisely lumped
organize an ad hoc committee of faculty and liv
ing group representatives to explore rush and
offer minor or major changes. Living group selec
tion is a matter that affects the entire University,
and thus representatives from all segments of
the community have a right to regulate and en
force the system of rush that takes place.
The committee's recommendations made this
summer are sound ones, and the nine persons
who served on the committee are to lx* praised
fov one of the most complete investigations of
rush ever made.
Unfortunately, the committee's efficiency has
not been equaled in the implementation of the
recommended rules by the Dean of Students of
fiee. The committee recommended to Dean Gor
don that each living group council go over the
proposed rush policy. The councils supposedly
could propose changes before accepting the rush
policy.
Yet Dean (Gordon has made 110 official move of

submitting the committee's recommendations to
the councils. Furthermore, the Dean himself
seems unclear as to who has the final authority
to put the rules into effect.
