# DAILY Style Change
## 
### 
Today's DAILY marks the intro
duction of a new six column format.
The change to wider columns is
being adopted by many of tile more
progressive newspapers throughout
the country.
The wider columns approximate
the average readers frame of vis
ion. The result is a more readable
column with less eye strain and
greater comprehension at one focus
ing.
Journalistically, the new format
presents a crisper appearance to
the reader and allows for greater
freedom in the arrangement of stor
ies.
