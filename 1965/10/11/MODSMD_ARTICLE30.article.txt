## Closing Of Union Belies Residence Univ. Concept 
### 
Editor, The Daily
Wo foel we should make pub
lic our opinions of the sched
uled closing of Union Residenee,
because this matter is of con
cern to the entire university
community through its bearing
on Stanford's proclaimed ideal,
the residential university.
Union Residence fulfills this
ideal in a unique way. It is a
place where students and fac
ulty can meet and discuss ideas
in informal surroundings; in
deed, Union has an unequaled
recoixl of faculty guests. Union
girls generally have chosen to
live here because they wish such
an attitude, usually confined to
the classroom, to extend to their
residential life. This attitude
has bred individuality within
unity and a concern for critical
consideration of the popular cul
ture. We feel that this dorm is
the university's most successful
in light of its stated ideal.
The proposed closing of Un
ion necessitates that this estab
lished community must either
1) splinter itself among the
other womenV residences or 2)
move into the High Rise Apart
ments. The lattei 1 possibility,
while providing nominal unity
for the group, in essence denies
such. The location of these
apartments on the periphery of
the university, the layout pro
viding no common meeting or
dining place, and the exclusion
of sophomores (a dynamic ele
ment in any group) would in
evitably wipe out any vestige
of this group as a group and
greatly restrict our contacts
with other students. As well, we
would no longer be afforded an

accessible, informal and enjoy
able place to entertain faculty.
It is hard for any of u» to im
agine reproducing the spirit of
Union Residence in the sterility
of the High-Rises.
One might question the uni
versity's philosophy and intent
when one considers the proposed
and scheduled— relocation of
the various offices of Student
Affairs in the heart of the cam
pus and the expulsion of the
students to the periphery.
So far, {ftHitions and consul
tations with the Deans have led
to nothing.

Editor, The Daily
I spent the last three years as
a Resident Assistant in Stern
Hall and wonder if I may now
make a number of observations.
Though numerous reasons #x
ist for coming to college, I
would like to focus on seven
benefits which might be derived
d u ring th e undergraduate
years:
• The acquisition of a body of
knowledge with which to under
stand the world in a more per
ceptive way than previously,
• A set of intellectuaj skills
- viz. the analytic approach,
• Some general idea of voca
tional direction,
• Personality or emotional
development which should re
sult in a fairly well defined and
stable sense of self,
• A chance to attempt to
think through a framework or
philosophy with which to con
front life,
• The learning of individual
refinement — from the nuances
of social intercourse to the
awakening of a humanitarian
conscience, and
• The opportunity to discover
how to make life more enjoy
able— here there should be a
particular emphasis on experi
mentation both in terms of ac
tivities and social associations.
It did appear that the Stan
ford program was rather strong
er in the first, second, and third
areas than in the fourth, fifth,
and sixth. I also had a sneaking
suspicion that all was not as
well as it should be in the sev
enth.

Editor, The Daily
It was disheartening to read
in last Thursday's Daily the ad
vertisement published by the
ASSU Travel Service. Not only
was it written in poor taste, but
also it indicated a lack of rather
basic human sensitivity. If the
dialogue was meant to be hum
orous, it was a revealing humor.
For it pointed to a somewhat
dispassionate gulf between
those in our academic commun
ity who, indeed, did find the ef
fort amusing and others of a
larger world community of hu
man respect and compassion.
Tiie dry tone of that mercenary
endeavor might have meant
little to some, but for the sake
of those among us who feel
otherwise, might we at least
ask our student body to find
other means of selling tickets?

Editor, The Daily
I spent the last three years as
a Resident Assistant in Stern
Hall and wonder if I may now
make a number of observations.
Though numerous reasons #x
ist for coming to college, I
would like to focus on seven
benefits which might be derived
d u ring th e undergraduate
years:
• The acquisition of a body of
knowledge with which to under
stand the world in a more per
ceptive way than previously,
• A set of intellectuaj skills
- viz. the analytic approach,
• Some general idea of voca
tional direction,
• Personality or emotional
development which should re
sult in a fairly well defined and
stable sense of self,
• A chance to attempt to
think through a framework or
philosophy with which to con
front life,
• The learning of individual
refinement — from the nuances
of social intercourse to the
awakening of a humanitarian
conscience, and
• The opportunity to discover
how to make life more enjoy
able— here there should be a
particular emphasis on experi
mentation both in terms of ac
tivities and social associations.
It did appear that the Stan
ford program was rather strong
er in the first, second, and third
areas than in the fourth, fifth,
and sixth. I also had a sneaking
suspicion that all was not as
well as it should be in the sev
enth.

It was disheartening to read
in last Thursday's Daily the ad
vertisement published by the
ASSU Travel Service. Not only
was it written in poor taste, but
also it indicated a lack of rather
basic human sensitivity. If the
dialogue was meant to be hum
orous, it was a revealing humor.
For it pointed to a somewhat
dispassionate gulf between
those in our academic commun
ity who, indeed, did find the ef
fort amusing and others of a
larger world community of hu
man respect and compassion.
Tiie dry tone of that mercenary
endeavor might have meant
little to some, but for the sake
of those among us who feel
otherwise, might we at least
ask our student body to find
other means of selling tickets?

Wo foel we should make pub
lic our opinions of the sched
uled closing of Union Residenee,
because this matter is of con
cern to the entire university
community through its bearing
on Stanford's proclaimed ideal,
the residential university.
Union Residence fulfills this
ideal in a unique way. It is a
place where students and fac
ulty can meet and discuss ideas
in informal surroundings; in
deed, Union has an unequaled
recoixl of faculty guests. Union
girls generally have chosen to
live here because they wish such
an attitude, usually confined to
the classroom, to extend to their
residential life. This attitude
has bred individuality within
unity and a concern for critical
consideration of the popular cul
ture. We feel that this dorm is
the university's most successful
in light of its stated ideal.
The proposed closing of Un
ion necessitates that this estab
lished community must either
1) splinter itself among the
other womenV residences or 2)
move into the High Rise Apart
ments. The lattei 1 possibility,
while providing nominal unity
for the group, in essence denies
such. The location of these
apartments on the periphery of
the university, the layout pro
viding no common meeting or
dining place, and the exclusion
of sophomores (a dynamic ele
ment in any group) would in
evitably wipe out any vestige
of this group as a group and
greatly restrict our contacts
with other students. As well, we
would no longer be afforded an

accessible, informal and enjoy

It was disheartening to read
in last Thursday's Daily the ad
vertisement published by the
ASSU Travel Service. Not only
was it written in poor taste, but
also it indicated a lack of rather
basic human sensitivity. If the
dialogue was meant to be hum
orous, it was a revealing humor.
For it pointed to a somewhat
dispassionate gulf between
those in our academic commun
ity who, indeed, did find the ef
fort amusing and others of a
larger world community of hu
man respect and compassion.
Tiie dry tone of that mercenary
endeavor might have meant
little to some, but for the sake
of those among us who feel
otherwise, might we at least
ask our student body to find
other means of selling tickets?

Wo foel we should make pub
lic our opinions of the sched
uled closing of Union Residenee,
because this matter is of con
cern to the entire university
community through its bearing
on Stanford's proclaimed ideal,
the residential university.
Union Residence fulfills this
ideal in a unique way. It is a
place where students and fac
ulty can meet and discuss ideas
in informal surroundings; in
deed, Union has an unequaled
recoixl of faculty guests. Union
girls generally have chosen to
live here because they wish such
an attitude, usually confined to
the classroom, to extend to their
residential life. This attitude
has bred individuality within
unity and a concern for critical
consideration of the popular cul
ture. We feel that this dorm is
the university's most successful
in light of its stated ideal.
The proposed closing of Un
ion necessitates that this estab
lished community must either
1) splinter itself among the
other womenV residences or 2)
move into the High Rise Apart
ments. The lattei 1 possibility,
while providing nominal unity
for the group, in essence denies
such. The location of these
apartments on the periphery of
the university, the layout pro
viding no common meeting or
dining place, and the exclusion
of sophomores (a dynamic ele
ment in any group) would in
evitably wipe out any vestige
of this group as a group and
greatly restrict our contacts
with other students. As well, we
would no longer be afforded an

accessible, informal and enjoy
able place to entertain faculty.
It is hard for any of u» to im
agine reproducing the spirit of
Union Residence in the sterility
of the High-Rises.
One might question the uni
versity's philosophy and intent
when one considers the proposed
and scheduled— relocation of
the various offices of Student
Affairs in the heart of the cam
pus and the expulsion of the
students to the periphery.
So far, {ftHitions and consul
tations with the Deans have led
to nothing.

I spent the last three years as
a Resident Assistant in Stern
Hall and wonder if I may now
make a number of observations.
Though numerous reasons #x
ist for coming to college, I
would like to focus on seven
benefits which might be derived
d u ring th e undergraduate
years:
• The acquisition of a body of
knowledge with which to under
stand the world in a more per
ceptive way than previously,
• A set of intellectuaj skills
- viz. the analytic approach,
• Some general idea of voca
tional direction,
• Personality or emotional
development which should re
sult in a fairly well defined and
stable sense of self,
• A chance to attempt to
think through a framework or
philosophy with which to con
front life,
• The learning of individual
refinement — from the nuances
of social intercourse to the
awakening of a humanitarian
conscience, and
• The opportunity to discover
how to make life more enjoy
able— here there should be a
particular emphasis on experi
mentation both in terms of ac
tivities and social associations.
It did appear that the Stan
ford program was rather strong
er in the first, second, and third
areas than in the fourth, fifth,
and sixth. I also had a sneaking
suspicion that all was not as
well as it should be in the sev
