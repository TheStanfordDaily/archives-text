# Agitating Overseas Takes Time and Special Talents

"Wheeling and dealing" is the life
of the Peace Corps "agitators", ac
cording to Bruce Reeves, who co
ordinates the requests for Peace
Corps programs from 17 Latin
American countries.
Anyone can march into a coun
try and build a schoolhouse with a
bit of technical help — the real
talent is in making the people want
a school house enough to build and
maintain it themselves, he said.
Otherwise empty schoolhouses can
become monuments to departed do
gooders.
"It's like calling a meeting for free
speech, which is easy, versus getting
people to the point where they care
enough to go to jail," he explained.
"That's what makes Savio a
'gunner' — he gets people to be
lieve in things."
Around the Peace Corps offices
there are many words for the agi
tator type — including "gunner"
and "swinger".
In the eyes of the Peace Corps,
this is community development —
getting people involved in improving
what's around them.
A do-gooder type could easily or
ganize a work group to build a
school in a village forgotten by the
ministry of education. Reeves said.
"But can you get people worked
up so they'll go to the ministry of
fice, which is two days away, and
sit there until they get a teacher for
the school?"
Getting ideas accepted, sometimes
subtly with a sentence stated at the
right time, sometimes blatantly with
loudspeakers and movie projectors

— that is the job of the Peace
Corps Volunteers.
In Malaysia, community develop
ment worker Bill Cull reports,
"Some days I just sit and talk . . .
talk all day long. And I feel as if
I've really gotten somewhere if these
people understand their own prob
lems a little better."
On the other hand, Peruvians ac
cepted the idea of an electricity co
operative with enthusiasm, reports
Peace Corps Volunteer Peter Lara.
Idea reception depends on the
structure of the society and the

nature of the project as well as the
methods used in pushing the idea.
Lara's "wheeling and dealing" could
be overt, but in Cull's Malaysian
village wheeling and dealing had
to be somewhat sneaky.
Volunteer Lara spent most of his
two years in Peru talking the cam
pesinos into joining an electricity
cooperative which would even
tually bring electricity and then in
dustry to their valley.
Sometimes he and the Peruvians
working with him had to explain

in southern Chile.
what electricity was, and sometimes
they met resistance because the
people could not comprehend them
selves being part-owners of such
a huge project. However, after
hearing all about the project, the
campesinos were usually enthus
iastic.
Bill Cull and his wife could not
campaign for their ideas, however.
For example, they knew the Malay
infants were small and listless be
cause they were not fed any solid
food until they were a year old.
Neither could they inoffensively
say, "You aren't feeding your chil
dren properly."
Instead, they waited for an op
portunity and one day it came.
"Why are Peace Corps Volunteers
so big?" a housewife asked one af
ternoon, pointing to the full foot
of height difference between her
husband and Bill Cull.
"One reason is because mothers
in the United States begin to feed
their children solids when they are
foui months old," Carol Cull re
plied. The whole village had ap
parently noticed the size difference,
for soon two couples began to feed
their infants solids at four months.
Peter Lara didn't have to wait
for a 1 opportunity, although he and
the Peruvians working with him
didn't enter a town unless they had
been invited or had received per
mission to do so. They went through
the streets playing recorded music
and attempting to gather a crowd;
then they hooked up a loud speaker
system.
They showed movies, one of a
similar Ecuadorian project. They
had the mayor or another high offi
cial say a few words from the plat
form, and almost always the offi

cial endorsed the electricity coopera
tive.
The Culls had to think in terms
of two babies; Lara and his Peru
vian associates had the job of signing
up several thousand persons. (The
Agency for International Develop
ment had said it would donate most
of the money for the electricity co
operative if the Peruvians could get
5,000 campesinos who would
eventually benefit by the project to
sign up, pay a membership fee equal
to a few days' wages and agree to
help with the manual labor in
volved when the money was
raised.)
Both the Culls and Lara had to
get people committed to an idea
that would result in immediate and
later benefits — in an idea that
would last after the Peace Corps
Volunteers left.

Lara's "wheeling and dealing" could
be overt, but in Cull's Malaysian
village wheeling and dealing had
to be somewhat sneaky.
Volunteer Lara spent most of his
two years in Peru talking the cam
pesinos into joining an electricity
cooperative which would even
tually bring electricity and then in
dustry to their valley.
Sometimes he and the Peruvians
working with him had to explain

what electricity was, and sometimes
they met resistance because the
people could not comprehend them
selves being part-owners of such
a huge project. However, after
hearing all about the project, the
campesinos were usually enthus
iastic.
Bill Cull and his wife could not
campaign for their ideas, however.
For example, they knew the Malay
infants were small and listless be
cause they were not fed any solid
food until they were a year old.
Neither could they inoffensively
say, "You aren't feeding your chil
dren properly."
Instead, they waited for an op
portunity and one day it came.
"Why are Peace Corps Volunteers
so big?" a housewife asked one af
ternoon, pointing to the full foot
of height difference between her
husband and Bill Cull.
"One reason is because mothers
in the United States begin to feed
their children solids when they are
foui months old," Carol Cull re
plied. The whole village had ap
parently noticed the size difference,
for soon two couples began to feed
their infants solids at four months.
Peter Lara didn't have to wait
for a 1 opportunity, although he and
the Peruvians working with him
didn't enter a town unless they had
been invited or had received per
mission to do so. They went through
the streets playing recorded music
and attempting to gather a crowd;
then they hooked up a loud speaker
system.
They showed movies, one of a
similar Ecuadorian project. They
had the mayor or another high offi
cial say a few words from the plat
form, and almost always the offi

cial endorsed the electricity coopera
tive.
The Culls had to think in terms
of two babies; Lara and his Peru
vian associates had the job of signing
up several thousand persons. (The
Agency for International Develop
ment had said it would donate most
of the money for the electricity co
operative if the Peruvians could get
5,000 campesinos who would
eventually benefit by the project to
sign up, pay a membership fee equal
to a few days' wages and agree to
help with the manual labor in
volved when the money was
raised.)
Both the Culls and Lara had to
get people committed to an idea
that would result in immediate and
later benefits — in an idea that
would last after the Peace Corps
Volunteers left.

this is community development —

sit there until they get a teacher for

The Culls had to think in terms
of two babies; Lara and his Peru

up several thousand persons. (The
Agency for International Develop

of the money for the electricity co
operative if the Peruvians could get
5,000 campesinos who would
eventually benefit by the project to
sign up, pay a membership fee equal
to a few days' wages and agree to
help with the manual labor in
volved when the money was
raised.)
Both the Culls and Lara had to
get people committed to an idea
that would result in immediate and
later benefits — in an idea that
would last after the Peace Corps
Volunteers left.

"It's like calling a meeting for free

"That's what makes Savio a

Around the Peace Corps offices
there are many words for the agi

In the eyes of the Peace Corps,
this is community development —
getting people involved in improving
what's around them.
A do-gooder type could easily or
ganize a work group to build a
school in a village forgotten by the
ministry of education. Reeves said.
"But can you get people worked
up so they'll go to the ministry of
fice, which is two days away, and
sit there until they get a teacher for
the school?"
Getting ideas accepted, sometimes
subtly with a sentence stated at the
right time, sometimes blatantly with
loudspeakers and movie projectors

— that is the job of the Peace
Corps Volunteers.
In Malaysia, community develop
ment worker Bill Cull reports,
"Some days I just sit and talk . . .
talk all day long. And I feel as if
I've really gotten somewhere if these
people understand their own prob

On the other hand, Peruvians ac
cepted the idea of an electricity co
operative with enthusiasm, reports
Peace Corps Volunteer Peter Lara.
Idea reception depends on the
structure of the society and the

nature of the project as well as the
methods used in pushing the idea.
Lara's "wheeling and dealing" could
be overt, but in Cull's Malaysian
village wheeling and dealing had
to be somewhat sneaky.
Volunteer Lara spent most of his
two years in Peru talking the cam
pesinos into joining an electricity
cooperative which would even
tually bring electricity and then in
dustry to their valley.
Sometimes he and the Peruvians
working with him had to explain

what electricity was, and sometimes
they met resistance because the
people could not comprehend them
selves being part-owners of such
a huge project. However, after
hearing all about the project, the
campesinos were usually enthus
iastic.
Bill Cull and his wife could not
campaign for their ideas, however.
For example, they knew the Malay
infants were small and listless be
cause they were not fed any solid
food until they were a year old.
Neither could they inoffensively
say, "You aren't feeding your chil
dren properly."
Instead, they waited for an op
portunity and one day it came.
"Why are Peace Corps Volunteers
so big?" a housewife asked one af
ternoon, pointing to the full foot
of height difference between her
husband and Bill Cull.
"One reason is because mothers
in the United States begin to feed
their children solids when they are
foui months old," Carol Cull re
plied. The whole village had ap
parently noticed the size difference,
for soon two couples began to feed
their infants solids at four months.
