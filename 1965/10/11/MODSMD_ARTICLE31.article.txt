# Agitating Overseas Takes Time and Special Talents

"Wheeling and dealing" is the life
of the Peace Corps "agitators", ac
cording to Bruce Reeves, who co
ordinates the requests for Peace
Corps programs from 17 Latin
American countries.
Anyone can march into a coun
try and build a schoolhouse with a
bit of technical help — the real
talent is in making the people want
a school house enough to build and
maintain it themselves, he said.
Otherwise empty schoolhouses can
become monuments to departed do
gooders.
"It's like calling a meeting for free
speech, which is easy, versus getting
people to the point where they care
enough to go to jail," he explained.
"That's what makes Savio a
'gunner' — he gets people to be
lieve in things."
Around the Peace Corps offices
there are many words for the agi
tator type — including "gunner"
and "swinger".
In the eyes of the Peace Corps,
this is community development —
getting people involved in improving
what's around them.
A do-gooder type could easily or
ganize a work group to build a
school in a village forgotten by the
ministry of education. Reeves said.
"But can you get people worked
up so they'll go to the ministry of
fice, which is two days away, and
sit there until they get a teacher for
the school?"
Getting ideas accepted, sometimes
subtly with a sentence stated at the
right time, sometimes blatantly with
loudspeakers and movie projectors

— that is the job of the Peace
Corps Volunteers.
In Malaysia, community develop
ment worker Bill Cull reports,
"Some days I just sit and talk . . .
talk all day long. And I feel as if
I've really gotten somewhere if these
people understand their own prob
lems a little better."
On the other hand, Peruvians ac
cepted the idea of an electricity co
operative with enthusiasm, reports
Peace Corps Volunteer Peter Lara.
Idea reception depends on the
structure of the society and the

nature of the project as well as the
methods used in pushing the idea.
Lara's "wheeling and dealing" could
be overt, but in Cull's Malaysian
village wheeling and dealing had
to be somewhat sneaky.
Volunteer Lara spent most of his
two years in Peru talking the cam
pesinos into joining an electricity
cooperative which would even
tually bring electricity and then in
dustry to their valley.
Sometimes he and the Peruvians
working with him had to explain
