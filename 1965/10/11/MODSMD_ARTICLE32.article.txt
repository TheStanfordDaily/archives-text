# Community Development — 'Mass Alienation to Mass Participation'
## 
### 
The Peace Corps has coined a new term for
what it does in Latin America — community de
velopment is now affectionately known as CD.
Frank Mankiewicz, chief of Peace Corps opera
tions in Latin America, addressing the Foreign Lan
guage Program in New York City in 1964, said,
"The techniques of community development are
essentially revolutionary techniques. For to help a
people, whether in a village or a section of an urban
sprawl, to the level where, by their own joint ac
tivity, they have realized their power as a com
munity and have located the real levers through
which they can enter the life of their country is a
revolutionary act."
Most people around Peace Corps headquarters in
Washington get a little uneasy when a word like
revolution starts getting kicked around; but that is,
in a sense, what the Peace Corps is all about — in
much the same way as SNCC workers in Mississippi
or freedom marchers in Alabama are dealing with
the stuff of revolution.
Mankiewicz calls it"the change from mass
alienation to mass participation." Of course this
doesn't mean that the Volunteer is out to stir up a
shooting war. There is too much basic work to be
done. Basic developments have to take place in a
community regardless of politics. Water, schools,
drainage and elementary education have to be pro
vided.
It is the goal of community development to bring

into being an organization within a neighborhood
that is capable of providing these items itself.
Jim Pines is chief of West Coast operations in
Latin America. He points out that it often works
out best if a Peace Corps CD worker goes into an
urban neighborhood or rural town without any
real technical skills. This forces him to go out and
find people and resources and talents in the com
munity able to do a job, and he doesn't end up
doing it himself.
"There is every difference in the world between
attitudes of the local people towards a small school
they put up themselves through their own organiza
tional initiative and a school stuck in the middle of
the town by an outside aid program—whether from
their own central government or from the United
States," he said.
The essence of community development, then, is
an emphasis on what people can do for themselves,
through organization. The Peace Corps Volunteer
can work only as a catalyst, spending long hours
learning about a community, how it works, what it

wants and feels its needs are, who the leaders are
and how to plant the seed of motivation.
It is a long and trying and often frustrating ex
perience for the Volunteer, for gains are often
miniscule and may disappear within days after the
Volunteer leaves an area. Organization and motiva
tion are the real goals, and they are fragile and
often temporary. Once instilled, however, they can
accomplish many things after the Peace Corps
leaves.
Ahout 50 per cent of the Volunteers sent to
Latin America are classed as CD workers, hut, as
Pines says, "Everyone there is a community devel
oper if he is doing his job right." The Volunteer's
first job as he enters a community is to figure out
what the felt needs of the people are. If the goals
stem from the Volunteer's perceptions of what he
thinks the community needs in line with his own
cultural background and not from what the people
think they need, then everything is lost from the be
ginning.
Once he understands the felt needs, the com
munity must be organized to tackle them and will,
hopefully, be able to do the job on its own. Pines
says,"The specific projects are incidental. Com
munity organizations coupled with the people's
feeling that they can do something for themselves,
that improvements can take place, are what is vital."
Particularly in urban areas, most changes require
help from the government, so that one goal of com
munity organization is to enable the people to
make more effective their legitimate demands on
the government. "There is thus a political as well as
a self-help element in the programs," said Pines.
The American college graduate usually does quite
well in CD programs, Pines says."He seems to
have a natural understanding of the importance
and techniques of organizing and of the steps that
need to be taken to solve problems." In addition
the community developer has to be capable of set
ting up close personal relationships in other coun
tries, and knowledge of the local language is
indispensable.
Community development is an organic process
in which a Volunteer's investigations lead him to
sense various possibilities of organization and im
plementation. He has to decide "what can be done,
how it can be done and how to motivate the people
to do it. In a traditional and fatalistic culture un
used to mobilization the job is arduous," Pines
explained.
Throughout Latin America especially, several
techniques have emerged as particularly fruitful.
Most Latin American schools require uniforms, and
children are frequently prevented from attending
school because their families can't afford these. The
Volunteer will try to locate a few women in the
area who can sew and are interested in teaching
their skills and will encourage them to organize
classes to teach the other women how to sew the
uniforms for their children. A feeling of community

spirit and cooperation is fostered, valuable skills
are taught and many children are able to start
going to school.
Among the men in urban areas there is fre
quently a severe shortage of capital, and what is
available carries a high interest rate. The commun
ity developer will suggest the idea of a credit
union so that a group, by pooling its resources, can
afford tools and equipment and supplies not other
wise available. But this must be worked out through
the community's effort, not the Volunteer's. Quite
often credit unions will bring a group of artisans
from the edge of starvation up to a decent living
standard.
Another device often used is the cooperative.
( hicken cooperatives have been sprouting all over
India. A group will get together, build its own
chicken coop, put its pooled resources and skills to
work and turn a profit through the savings effected
by divisions of labor.
Urban community development in the barrios of
cities is often more difficult than it is in rural vil
lages, according to Pines. The men are tied up in
their jobs and there is little off time to work on
neighborhood projects. Most projects, such as water,
sewage or education systems, also require large
amounts of capital.
In these cases relations with the government are
important. "We help people to make their own point
of view felt," Pines says. But in spite of the prob
lems, and the years it takes for community develop
ment to really work, "there are communities where
the people are happier and live better because of
the Peace Corps. We make available to them ways
and means of improving themselves."
The aim is to build a sub-system of society in a
community that can fend for itself within, or if
necessary by going around, the larger, usually olig
archic society. "It builds for itself yet works within
the system to get whatever it can there. We just
work to get people to work together in a sensible
way to take sensible steps to further their own
development."
Community organization can also be analysed
in terms of developing democracy. It has been
pointed out that it is no easy job to teach people
that everyone should have his say. Once the Volun
teer has gained the confidence of a neighborhood,
he will encourage the calling of a community meet
ing to discuss things that need to be done.
The first meeting is usually bedlam; but very
gradually progress is made, goals are decided upon
by the people, ways of effecting them are thought
through and the work is done. Like an iceberg, only
part of what has occurred shows: the last stage
when a visible project is completed. But underneath,
the basic purposes of community development have
been furthered: to develop local leaders, get
them working together with the people, getting
the government to respond to community needs and
finally getting the community to carry through to
some sort of tangible improvements.

the stuff of revolution.
Mankiewicz calls it"the change from mass
alienation to mass participation." Of course this
doesn't mean that the Volunteer is out to stir up a
shooting war. There is too much basic work to be
done. Basic developments have to take place in a
community regardless of politics. Water, schools,
drainage and elementary education have to be pro
vided.
It is the goal of community development to bring

into being an organization within a neighborhood
that is capable of providing these items itself.
Jim Pines is chief of West Coast operations in
Latin America. He points out that it often works
out best if a Peace Corps CD worker goes into an
urban neighborhood or rural town without any
real technical skills. This forces him to go out and
find people and resources and talents in the com
munity able to do a job, and he doesn't end up
doing it himself.
"There is every difference in the world between
attitudes of the local people towards a small school
they put up themselves through their own organiza
tional initiative and a school stuck in the middle of
the town by an outside aid program—whether from
their own central government or from the United
States," he said.
The essence of community development, then, is
an emphasis on what people can do for themselves,
through organization. The Peace Corps Volunteer
can work only as a catalyst, spending long hours
learning about a community, how it works, what it

wants and feels its needs are, who the leaders are
and how to plant the seed of motivation.
It is a long and trying and often frustrating ex
perience for the Volunteer, for gains are often
miniscule and may disappear within days after the
Volunteer leaves an area. Organization and motiva
tion are the real goals, and they are fragile and
often temporary. Once instilled, however, they can
accomplish many things after the Peace Corps
leaves.
Ahout 50 per cent of the Volunteers sent to
Latin America are classed as CD workers, hut, as
Pines says, "Everyone there is a community devel
oper if he is doing his job right." The Volunteer's
first job as he enters a community is to figure out
what the felt needs of the people are. If the goals
stem from the Volunteer's perceptions of what he
thinks the community needs in line with his own
cultural background and not from what the people
think they need, then everything is lost from the be
ginning.
Once he understands the felt needs, the com
munity must be organized to tackle them and will,
hopefully, be able to do the job on its own. Pines
says,"The specific projects are incidental. Com
munity organizations coupled with the people's
feeling that they can do something for themselves,
that improvements can take place, are what is vital."
Particularly in urban areas, most changes require
help from the government, so that one goal of com
munity organization is to enable the people to
make more effective their legitimate demands on
the government. "There is thus a political as well as
a self-help element in the programs," said Pines.
The American college graduate usually does quite
well in CD programs, Pines says."He seems to
have a natural understanding of the importance
and techniques of organizing and of the steps that
need to be taken to solve problems." In addition
the community developer has to be capable of set
ting up close personal relationships in other coun
tries, and knowledge of the local language is
indispensable.
Community development is an organic process
in which a Volunteer's investigations lead him to
sense various possibilities of organization and im
plementation. He has to decide "what can be done,
how it can be done and how to motivate the people
to do it. In a traditional and fatalistic culture un
used to mobilization the job is arduous," Pines
explained.
Throughout Latin America especially, several
techniques have emerged as particularly fruitful.
Most Latin American schools require uniforms, and
children are frequently prevented from attending
school because their families can't afford these. The
Volunteer will try to locate a few women in the
area who can sew and are interested in teaching
their skills and will encourage them to organize
classes to teach the other women how to sew the
uniforms for their children. A feeling of community

spirit and cooperation is fostered, valuable skills
are taught and many children are able to start
going to school.
Among the men in urban areas there is fre
quently a severe shortage of capital, and what is
available carries a high interest rate. The commun
ity developer will suggest the idea of a credit
union so that a group, by pooling its resources, can
afford tools and equipment and supplies not other
wise available. But this must be worked out through
the community's effort, not the Volunteer's. Quite
often credit unions will bring a group of artisans
from the edge of starvation up to a decent living
standard.
Another device often used is the cooperative.
( hicken cooperatives have been sprouting all over
India. A group will get together, build its own
chicken coop, put its pooled resources and skills to
work and turn a profit through the savings effected
by divisions of labor.
Urban community development in the barrios of
cities is often more difficult than it is in rural vil
lages, according to Pines. The men are tied up in
their jobs and there is little off time to work on
neighborhood projects. Most projects, such as water,
sewage or education systems, also require large
amounts of capital.
In these cases relations with the government are
important. "We help people to make their own point
of view felt," Pines says. But in spite of the prob
lems, and the years it takes for community develop
ment to really work, "there are communities where
the people are happier and live better because of
the Peace Corps. We make available to them ways
and means of improving themselves."
The aim is to build a sub-system of society in a
community that can fend for itself within, or if
necessary by going around, the larger, usually olig
archic society. "It builds for itself yet works within
the system to get whatever it can there. We just
work to get people to work together in a sensible
way to take sensible steps to further their own
development."
Community organization can also be analysed
in terms of developing democracy. It has been
pointed out that it is no easy job to teach people
that everyone should have his say. Once the Volun
teer has gained the confidence of a neighborhood,
he will encourage the calling of a community meet
ing to discuss things that need to be done.
The first meeting is usually bedlam; but very
gradually progress is made, goals are decided upon
by the people, ways of effecting them are thought
through and the work is done. Like an iceberg, only
part of what has occurred shows: the last stage
when a visible project is completed. But underneath,
the basic purposes of community development have
been furthered: to develop local leaders, get
them working together with the people, getting
the government to respond to community needs and
finally getting the community to carry through to
some sort of tangible improvements.
The Peace Corps has coined a new term for
what it does in Latin America — community de
velopment is now affectionately known as CD.
Frank Mankiewicz, chief of Peace Corps opera
tions in Latin America, addressing the Foreign Lan
guage Program in New York City in 1964, said,
"The techniques of community development are
essentially revolutionary techniques. For to help a
people, whether in a village or a section of an urban
sprawl, to the level where, by their own joint ac
tivity, they have realized their power as a com
munity and have located the real levers through
which they can enter the life of their country is a
revolutionary act."

The essence of community development, then, is
an emphasis on what people can do for themselves,
through organization. The Peace Corps Volunteer

wants and feels its needs are, who the leaders are
and how to plant the seed of motivation.
It is a long and trying and often frustrating ex
perience for the Volunteer, for gains are often
miniscule and may disappear within days after the
Volunteer leaves an area. Organization and motiva
tion are the real goals, and they are fragile and
often temporary. Once instilled, however, they can
accomplish many things after the Peace Corps
leaves.
Ahout 50 per cent of the Volunteers sent to
Latin America are classed as CD workers, hut, as
Pines says, "Everyone there is a community devel
oper if he is doing his job right." The Volunteer's
first job as he enters a community is to figure out
what the felt needs of the people are. If the goals
stem from the Volunteer's perceptions of what he
thinks the community needs in line with his own
cultural background and not from what the people
think they need, then everything is lost from the be
ginning.
Once he understands the felt needs, the com
munity must be organized to tackle them and will,
hopefully, be able to do the job on its own. Pines
says,"The specific projects are incidental. Com
munity organizations coupled with the people's
feeling that they can do something for themselves,
that improvements can take place, are what is vital."
Particularly in urban areas, most changes require
help from the government, so that one goal of com
munity organization is to enable the people to
make more effective their legitimate demands on
the government. "There is thus a political as well as
a self-help element in the programs," said Pines.
The American college graduate usually does quite
well in CD programs, Pines says."He seems to
have a natural understanding of the importance
and techniques of organizing and of the steps that
need to be taken to solve problems." In addition
the community developer has to be capable of set
ting up close personal relationships in other coun
tries, and knowledge of the local language is
indispensable.
Community development is an organic process
in which a Volunteer's investigations lead him to
sense various possibilities of organization and im
plementation. He has to decide "what can be done,
how it can be done and how to motivate the people
to do it. In a traditional and fatalistic culture un
used to mobilization the job is arduous," Pines
explained.
Throughout Latin America especially, several
techniques have emerged as particularly fruitful.
Most Latin American schools require uniforms, and
children are frequently prevented from attending
school because their families can't afford these. The
Volunteer will try to locate a few women in the
area who can sew and are interested in teaching
their skills and will encourage them to organize
classes to teach the other women how to sew the
uniforms for their children. A feeling of community

spirit and cooperation is fostered, valuable skills
are taught and many children are able to start
going to school.
Among the men in urban areas there is fre
quently a severe shortage of capital, and what is
available carries a high interest rate. The commun
ity developer will suggest the idea of a credit
union so that a group, by pooling its resources, can
afford tools and equipment and supplies not other
wise available. But this must be worked out through
the community's effort, not the Volunteer's. Quite
often credit unions will bring a group of artisans
from the edge of starvation up to a decent living
standard.
Another device often used is the cooperative.
( hicken cooperatives have been sprouting all over
India. A group will get together, build its own
chicken coop, put its pooled resources and skills to
work and turn a profit through the savings effected
by divisions of labor.
Urban community development in the barrios of
cities is often more difficult than it is in rural vil
lages, according to Pines. The men are tied up in
their jobs and there is little off time to work on
neighborhood projects. Most projects, such as water,
sewage or education systems, also require large
amounts of capital.
In these cases relations with the government are
important. "We help people to make their own point
of view felt," Pines says. But in spite of the prob
lems, and the years it takes for community develop
ment to really work, "there are communities where
the people are happier and live better because of
the Peace Corps. We make available to them ways
and means of improving themselves."
The aim is to build a sub-system of society in a
community that can fend for itself within, or if
necessary by going around, the larger, usually olig
archic society. "It builds for itself yet works within
the system to get whatever it can there. We just
work to get people to work together in a sensible
way to take sensible steps to further their own
development."
Community organization can also be analysed
in terms of developing democracy. It has been
pointed out that it is no easy job to teach people
that everyone should have his say. Once the Volun
teer has gained the confidence of a neighborhood,
he will encourage the calling of a community meet
ing to discuss things that need to be done.
The first meeting is usually bedlam; but very
gradually progress is made, goals are decided upon
by the people, ways of effecting them are thought
through and the work is done. Like an iceberg, only
part of what has occurred shows: the last stage
when a visible project is completed. But underneath,
the basic purposes of community development have
been furthered: to develop local leaders, get
them working together with the people, getting
the government to respond to community needs and
finally getting the community to carry through to
some sort of tangible improvements.
The Peace Corps has coined a new term for
what it does in Latin America — community de
velopment is now affectionately known as CD.
Frank Mankiewicz, chief of Peace Corps opera
tions in Latin America, addressing the Foreign Lan
guage Program in New York City in 1964, said,
"The techniques of community development are
essentially revolutionary techniques. For to help a
people, whether in a village or a section of an urban
sprawl, to the level where, by their own joint ac
tivity, they have realized their power as a com
munity and have located the real levers through
which they can enter the life of their country is a
revolutionary act."
Most people around Peace Corps headquarters in
Washington get a little uneasy when a word like
revolution starts getting kicked around; but that is,
in a sense, what the Peace Corps is all about — in
much the same way as SNCC workers in Mississippi
or freedom marchers in Alabama are dealing with
the stuff of revolution.
Mankiewicz calls it"the change from mass
alienation to mass participation." Of course this
doesn't mean that the Volunteer is out to stir up a
shooting war. There is too much basic work to be
done. Basic developments have to take place in a
community regardless of politics. Water, schools,
drainage and elementary education have to be pro
vided.
It is the goal of community development to bring

into being an organization within a neighborhood
that is capable of providing these items itself.
Jim Pines is chief of West Coast operations in
Latin America. He points out that it often works
out best if a Peace Corps CD worker goes into an
urban neighborhood or rural town without any
real technical skills. This forces him to go out and
find people and resources and talents in the com
munity able to do a job, and he doesn't end up
doing it himself.

wants and feels its needs are, who the leaders are
and how to plant the seed of motivation.
It is a long and trying and often frustrating ex
perience for the Volunteer, for gains are often
miniscule and may disappear within days after the
Volunteer leaves an area. Organization and motiva
tion are the real goals, and they are fragile and
often temporary. Once instilled, however, they can
accomplish many things after the Peace Corps
leaves.
Ahout 50 per cent of the Volunteers sent to
Latin America are classed as CD workers, hut, as
Pines says, "Everyone there is a community devel
oper if he is doing his job right." The Volunteer's
first job as he enters a community is to figure out
what the felt needs of the people are. If the goals
stem from the Volunteer's perceptions of what he
thinks the community needs in line with his own
cultural background and not from what the people
think they need, then everything is lost from the be
ginning.
Once he understands the felt needs, the com
munity must be organized to tackle them and will,
hopefully, be able to do the job on its own. Pines
says,"The specific projects are incidental. Com
munity organizations coupled with the people's
feeling that they can do something for themselves,
that improvements can take place, are what is vital."
Particularly in urban areas, most changes require
help from the government, so that one goal of com
munity organization is to enable the people to
make more effective their legitimate demands on
the government. "There is thus a political as well as
a self-help element in the programs," said Pines.
The American college graduate usually does quite
well in CD programs, Pines says."He seems to
have a natural understanding of the importance
and techniques of organizing and of the steps that
need to be taken to solve problems." In addition
the community developer has to be capable of set
ting up close personal relationships in other coun
tries, and knowledge of the local language is
indispensable.
Community development is an organic process
in which a Volunteer's investigations lead him to
sense various possibilities of organization and im
plementation. He has to decide "what can be done,
how it can be done and how to motivate the people
to do it. In a traditional and fatalistic culture un
used to mobilization the job is arduous," Pines
explained.
Throughout Latin America especially, several
techniques have emerged as particularly fruitful.
Most Latin American schools require uniforms, and
children are frequently prevented from attending
school because their families can't afford these. The
Volunteer will try to locate a few women in the
area who can sew and are interested in teaching
their skills and will encourage them to organize
classes to teach the other women how to sew the
uniforms for their children. A feeling of community

spirit and cooperation is fostered, valuable skills
are taught and many children are able to start
going to school.
Among the men in urban areas there is fre
quently a severe shortage of capital, and what is
available carries a high interest rate. The commun
ity developer will suggest the idea of a credit
union so that a group, by pooling its resources, can
afford tools and equipment and supplies not other
wise available. But this must be worked out through
the community's effort, not the Volunteer's. Quite
often credit unions will bring a group of artisans
from the edge of starvation up to a decent living
standard.
Another device often used is the cooperative.
( hicken cooperatives have been sprouting all over
India. A group will get together, build its own
chicken coop, put its pooled resources and skills to
work and turn a profit through the savings effected
by divisions of labor.
Urban community development in the barrios of
cities is often more difficult than it is in rural vil
lages, according to Pines. The men are tied up in
their jobs and there is little off time to work on
neighborhood projects. Most projects, such as water,
sewage or education systems, also require large
amounts of capital.
In these cases relations with the government are
important. "We help people to make their own point
of view felt," Pines says. But in spite of the prob
lems, and the years it takes for community develop
ment to really work, "there are communities where
the people are happier and live better because of
the Peace Corps. We make available to them ways
and means of improving themselves."
The aim is to build a sub-system of society in a
community that can fend for itself within, or if
necessary by going around, the larger, usually olig
archic society. "It builds for itself yet works within
the system to get whatever it can there. We just
work to get people to work together in a sensible
way to take sensible steps to further their own
development."
Community organization can also be analysed
in terms of developing democracy. It has been
pointed out that it is no easy job to teach people
that everyone should have his say. Once the Volun
teer has gained the confidence of a neighborhood,
he will encourage the calling of a community meet
ing to discuss things that need to be done.
The first meeting is usually bedlam; but very
gradually progress is made, goals are decided upon
by the people, ways of effecting them are thought
through and the work is done. Like an iceberg, only
part of what has occurred shows: the last stage
when a visible project is completed. But underneath,
the basic purposes of community development have
been furthered: to develop local leaders, get
them working together with the people, getting
the government to respond to community needs and
finally getting the community to carry through to
some sort of tangible improvements.
The Peace Corps has coined a new term for
what it does in Latin America — community de
velopment is now affectionately known as CD.
Frank Mankiewicz, chief of Peace Corps opera
tions in Latin America, addressing the Foreign Lan
guage Program in New York City in 1964, said,
"The techniques of community development are
essentially revolutionary techniques. For to help a
people, whether in a village or a section of an urban
sprawl, to the level where, by their own joint ac
tivity, they have realized their power as a com
munity and have located the real levers through
which they can enter the life of their country is a
revolutionary act."
Most people around Peace Corps headquarters in
Washington get a little uneasy when a word like
revolution starts getting kicked around; but that is,
in a sense, what the Peace Corps is all about — in
much the same way as SNCC workers in Mississippi
or freedom marchers in Alabama are dealing with
the stuff of revolution.
Mankiewicz calls it"the change from mass
alienation to mass participation." Of course this
doesn't mean that the Volunteer is out to stir up a
shooting war. There is too much basic work to be
done. Basic developments have to take place in a
community regardless of politics. Water, schools,
drainage and elementary education have to be pro
vided.
It is the goal of community development to bring

into being an organization within a neighborhood
that is capable of providing these items itself.
Jim Pines is chief of West Coast operations in
Latin America. He points out that it often works
out best if a Peace Corps CD worker goes into an
urban neighborhood or rural town without any
real technical skills. This forces him to go out and
find people and resources and talents in the com
munity able to do a job, and he doesn't end up
doing it himself.
"There is every difference in the world between
attitudes of the local people towards a small school
they put up themselves through their own organiza
tional initiative and a school stuck in the middle of
the town by an outside aid program—whether from
their own central government or from the United
States," he said.
The essence of community development, then, is
an emphasis on what people can do for themselves,
through organization. The Peace Corps Volunteer
can work only as a catalyst, spending long hours
learning about a community, how it works, what it
