# Community Development — 'Mass Alienation to Mass Participation'
## 
### 
The Peace Corps has coined a new term for
what it does in Latin America — community de
velopment is now affectionately known as CD.
Frank Mankiewicz, chief of Peace Corps opera
tions in Latin America, addressing the Foreign Lan
guage Program in New York City in 1964, said,
"The techniques of community development are
essentially revolutionary techniques. For to help a
people, whether in a village or a section of an urban
sprawl, to the level where, by their own joint ac
tivity, they have realized their power as a com
munity and have located the real levers through
which they can enter the life of their country is a
revolutionary act."
Most people around Peace Corps headquarters in
Washington get a little uneasy when a word like
revolution starts getting kicked around; but that is,
in a sense, what the Peace Corps is all about — in
much the same way as SNCC workers in Mississippi
or freedom marchers in Alabama are dealing with
the stuff of revolution.
Mankiewicz calls it"the change from mass
alienation to mass participation." Of course this
doesn't mean that the Volunteer is out to stir up a
shooting war. There is too much basic work to be
done. Basic developments have to take place in a
community regardless of politics. Water, schools,
drainage and elementary education have to be pro
vided.
It is the goal of community development to bring

into being an organization within a neighborhood
that is capable of providing these items itself.
Jim Pines is chief of West Coast operations in
Latin America. He points out that it often works
out best if a Peace Corps CD worker goes into an
urban neighborhood or rural town without any
real technical skills. This forces him to go out and
find people and resources and talents in the com
munity able to do a job, and he doesn't end up
doing it himself.
"There is every difference in the world between
attitudes of the local people towards a small school
they put up themselves through their own organiza
tional initiative and a school stuck in the middle of
the town by an outside aid program—whether from
their own central government or from the United
States," he said.
The essence of community development, then, is
an emphasis on what people can do for themselves,
through organization. The Peace Corps Volunteer
can work only as a catalyst, spending long hours
learning about a community, how it works, what it
