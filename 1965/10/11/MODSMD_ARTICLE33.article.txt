# The 						Dominican Revolt— 'Friend, It's Your Fight'
## 
### 
The Peace Corps has passed its severest test to date — survival amid
revolution in the Dominican Republic.
According to some, it was the Peace Corps versus the War Corps.
Barry Goldwater lumped the two together and called them the "Freedom
Corps."
On April 24 the U. S. Marines landed in the Dominican Republic with
the expressed intention of helping to save America nationals. They fought
alongside the Dominican Republic government forces after deciding
communists had infiltrated the rebel units.
It was common knowledge that Peace Corps nurses were working in
hospitals in rebel areas, patching up the soldiers who had been shot by
the Marines.
The majority of Peace Corps Volunteers were sympathetic to the rebels
because the Dominicans with whom they worked and lived were on the
rebel side, according to Peace Corps officials.
Remarkably little criticism surrounded the Peace Corps actions —
although a few newspapers ran editorials like the Richmond News Leader's
which asked "just exactly where the Corps' humanitarian objectives leave
off and the legitimate requirements of national loyalty resume."
In a syndicated column, Goldwater compared the Dominican Republic
to Cuba and said, "Imagine who could have done the most to bring real
peace to Cuba. Peace Corps Volunteers, who would have been lined up
and shot pretty early in the Castro game, or U. S. Marines who could have
restored the order needed for free elections?"
But even he went on to praise the Peace Corps' Dominican Republic
action, saying the Volunteers "simply prove by their action that America
has not only an iron fist but a warm heart."
Dr. Joseph Colmen, Deputy Associate Director of the Peace Corps,

said the Volunteers "generally felt
their projects had been disturbed
. . . yet they felt they were needed
then. If they really had any sense
of commitment, to leave without
any sense of continuity would dem
onstrate a lack of faith."
It wasn't easy. According to Dr.
Colmen, Volunteers were plagued
by horrible living conditions, little
food and less sleep, as well as anti-
American sentiment.
There was also the danger of be
ing caught in the crossfire.
The home office of the Peace
Corps conducted a "continuous
assessment" of safety conditions in
the Dominican Republic, according
to Dr. Colmen. He and another
Peace Corps official visited the Do
minican Republic to see how safe
the Volunteers were.
Permanent Dominican Republic
staff members of the Peace Corps
sent only one special message to
the Volunteers — they were to stay
in their barrios or villages until no
tified to move. This was an attempt

to keep them out of the range of
gunfire and off the roads where
trouble might develop.
According to Dr. Colmen, during
training all Volunteers receive in
structions not to take sides during
conflict and not to "get up on soap
boxes and make speeches about our
form of government."
At no time was there a problem
with Peace Corps Volunteers wish
ing to flee the Dominican Republic,
according to Peace Corps officials.
And at no time was a Volunteer
wounded.
During the early stages of the
rebellion, danger from troops and
planes of the ruling military junta,
which had threatened to strafe and
bomb parts of the city, caused some
Volunteers to move to the Ameri
can Embassy in the International
Zone, according to Peace Corps
officials.
About three weeks after the re
bellion broke out. most of the Vol
unteers who had been working in
Santo Domingo went to Puerto
Rico for a few days of rest and re
laxation following a trying period
without food or sleep. Most of the
shooting had stopped and the hos
pital work was not as heavy.
One Volunteer interviewed at the
time said, "I'm going back. I'm
going back a little bit afraid, not of

anti-American feeling among the
people I was working with, but in
terms of the number of arms that
are still out.
"Maybe a guy's brother was killed
by an American, and the guy will
come to my door with a gun in the
middle of the night. But the Peace
Corps should try to smooth things
over. We should try to get our com
munity back up to the level of or
ganization it was at when the revo
lulion broke out, or at least to a
functioning level. Leaving now
would be very bad timing."
On June 2, 24 new Volunteers
(lew in as partial replacements for
47 Volunteers whose two-year
stints were up. At the same time
the announcement was made that
15 Volunteers whose terms of ser
vice were up had requested to re
main a while longer.
What did the individual Peace
Corps members do when faced with
the question of fighting?
When the rebellion broke out,
one Peace Corps Volunteer was ap
proached by a rebel who had been
working with him in the barrio.
"0.K., so you care about the peo
ple. Show it in front of the tanks
with me," he was challenged.
The Volunteer answered: "Friend,
it's your country and it's your fight.
I'm a Peace Corps Volunteer and I
can never assist Dominicans to kill
Dominicans."

action, saying the Volunteers "simply prove by their action that America
has not only an iron fist but a warm heart."
Dr. Joseph Colmen, Deputy Associate Director of the Peace Corps,

said the Volunteers "generally felt
their projects had been disturbed
. . . yet they felt they were needed
then. If they really had any sense
of commitment, to leave without
any sense of continuity would dem
onstrate a lack of faith."
It wasn't easy. According to Dr.
Colmen, Volunteers were plagued
by horrible living conditions, little
food and less sleep, as well as anti-
American sentiment.
There was also the danger of be
ing caught in the crossfire.
The home office of the Peace
Corps conducted a "continuous
assessment" of safety conditions in
the Dominican Republic, according
to Dr. Colmen. He and another
Peace Corps official visited the Do
minican Republic to see how safe
the Volunteers were.
Permanent Dominican Republic
staff members of the Peace Corps
sent only one special message to
the Volunteers — they were to stay
in their barrios or villages until no
tified to move. This was an attempt

to keep them out of the range of
gunfire and off the roads where
trouble might develop.
According to Dr. Colmen, during
training all Volunteers receive in
structions not to take sides during
conflict and not to "get up on soap
boxes and make speeches about our
form of government."
At no time was there a problem
with Peace Corps Volunteers wish
ing to flee the Dominican Republic,
according to Peace Corps officials.
And at no time was a Volunteer
wounded.
During the early stages of the
rebellion, danger from troops and
planes of the ruling military junta,
which had threatened to strafe and
bomb parts of the city, caused some
Volunteers to move to the Ameri
can Embassy in the International
Zone, according to Peace Corps
officials.
About three weeks after the re
bellion broke out. most of the Vol
unteers who had been working in
Santo Domingo went to Puerto
Rico for a few days of rest and re
laxation following a trying period
without food or sleep. Most of the
shooting had stopped and the hos
pital work was not as heavy.
One Volunteer interviewed at the
time said, "I'm going back. I'm
going back a little bit afraid, not of

anti-American feeling among the
people I was working with, but in
terms of the number of arms that
are still out.
"Maybe a guy's brother was killed
by an American, and the guy will
come to my door with a gun in the
middle of the night. But the Peace
Corps should try to smooth things
over. We should try to get our com
munity back up to the level of or
ganization it was at when the revo
lulion broke out, or at least to a
functioning level. Leaving now
would be very bad timing."
On June 2, 24 new Volunteers
(lew in as partial replacements for
47 Volunteers whose two-year
stints were up. At the same time
the announcement was made that
15 Volunteers whose terms of ser
vice were up had requested to re
main a while longer.
What did the individual Peace
Corps members do when faced with
the question of fighting?
When the rebellion broke out,
one Peace Corps Volunteer was ap
proached by a rebel who had been
working with him in the barrio.
"0.K., so you care about the peo
ple. Show it in front of the tanks
with me," he was challenged.
The Volunteer answered: "Friend,
it's your country and it's your fight.
I'm a Peace Corps Volunteer and I
can never assist Dominicans to kill
Dominicans."
The Peace Corps has passed its severest test to date — survival amid
revolution in the Dominican Republic.
According to some, it was the Peace Corps versus the War Corps.
Barry Goldwater lumped the two together and called them the "Freedom
Corps."
On April 24 the U. S. Marines landed in the Dominican Republic with
the expressed intention of helping to save America nationals. They fought
alongside the Dominican Republic government forces after deciding
communists had infiltrated the rebel units.
It was common knowledge that Peace Corps nurses were working in
hospitals in rebel areas, patching up the soldiers who had been shot by
the Marines.
The majority of Peace Corps Volunteers were sympathetic to the rebels
because the Dominicans with whom they worked and lived were on the
rebel side, according to Peace Corps officials.
Remarkably little criticism surrounded the Peace Corps actions —
although a few newspapers ran editorials like the Richmond News Leader's
which asked "just exactly where the Corps' humanitarian objectives leave
off and the legitimate requirements of national loyalty resume."
In a syndicated column, Goldwater compared the Dominican Republic
to Cuba and said, "Imagine who could have done the most to bring real
peace to Cuba. Peace Corps Volunteers, who would have been lined up
and shot pretty early in the Castro game, or U. S. Marines who could have
restored the order needed for free elections?"

According to Dr. Colmen, during
training all Volunteers receive in
structions not to take sides during
conflict and not to "get up on soap
boxes and make speeches about our
form of government."
At no time was there a problem
with Peace Corps Volunteers wish
ing to flee the Dominican Republic,
according to Peace Corps officials.
And at no time was a Volunteer
wounded.
During the early stages of the
rebellion, danger from troops and
planes of the ruling military junta,
which had threatened to strafe and
bomb parts of the city, caused some
Volunteers to move to the Ameri
can Embassy in the International
Zone, according to Peace Corps
officials.
About three weeks after the re
bellion broke out. most of the Vol
unteers who had been working in
Santo Domingo went to Puerto
Rico for a few days of rest and re
laxation following a trying period
without food or sleep. Most of the
shooting had stopped and the hos
pital work was not as heavy.
One Volunteer interviewed at the
time said, "I'm going back. I'm
going back a little bit afraid, not of

anti-American feeling among the
people I was working with, but in
terms of the number of arms that
are still out.
"Maybe a guy's brother was killed
by an American, and the guy will
come to my door with a gun in the
middle of the night. But the Peace
Corps should try to smooth things
over. We should try to get our com
munity back up to the level of or
ganization it was at when the revo
lulion broke out, or at least to a
functioning level. Leaving now
would be very bad timing."
On June 2, 24 new Volunteers
(lew in as partial replacements for
47 Volunteers whose two-year
stints were up. At the same time
the announcement was made that
15 Volunteers whose terms of ser
vice were up had requested to re
main a while longer.
What did the individual Peace
Corps members do when faced with
the question of fighting?
When the rebellion broke out,
one Peace Corps Volunteer was ap
proached by a rebel who had been
working with him in the barrio.
"0.K., so you care about the peo
ple. Show it in front of the tanks
with me," he was challenged.
The Volunteer answered: "Friend,
it's your country and it's your fight.
I'm a Peace Corps Volunteer and I
can never assist Dominicans to kill
Dominicans."
The Peace Corps has passed its severest test to date — survival amid
revolution in the Dominican Republic.
According to some, it was the Peace Corps versus the War Corps.
Barry Goldwater lumped the two together and called them the "Freedom
Corps."
On April 24 the U. S. Marines landed in the Dominican Republic with
the expressed intention of helping to save America nationals. They fought
alongside the Dominican Republic government forces after deciding
communists had infiltrated the rebel units.
It was common knowledge that Peace Corps nurses were working in
hospitals in rebel areas, patching up the soldiers who had been shot by
the Marines.
The majority of Peace Corps Volunteers were sympathetic to the rebels
because the Dominicans with whom they worked and lived were on the
rebel side, according to Peace Corps officials.
Remarkably little criticism surrounded the Peace Corps actions —
although a few newspapers ran editorials like the Richmond News Leader's
which asked "just exactly where the Corps' humanitarian objectives leave
off and the legitimate requirements of national loyalty resume."
In a syndicated column, Goldwater compared the Dominican Republic
to Cuba and said, "Imagine who could have done the most to bring real
peace to Cuba. Peace Corps Volunteers, who would have been lined up
and shot pretty early in the Castro game, or U. S. Marines who could have
restored the order needed for free elections?"
But even he went on to praise the Peace Corps' Dominican Republic
action, saying the Volunteers "simply prove by their action that America
has not only an iron fist but a warm heart."
Dr. Joseph Colmen, Deputy Associate Director of the Peace Corps,

said the Volunteers "generally felt
their projects had been disturbed
. . . yet they felt they were needed
then. If they really had any sense
of commitment, to leave without
any sense of continuity would dem
onstrate a lack of faith."
It wasn't easy. According to Dr.
Colmen, Volunteers were plagued
by horrible living conditions, little
food and less sleep, as well as anti-
American sentiment.
There was also the danger of be
ing caught in the crossfire.
The home office of the Peace
Corps conducted a "continuous
assessment" of safety conditions in
the Dominican Republic, according
to Dr. Colmen. He and another
Peace Corps official visited the Do
minican Republic to see how safe
the Volunteers were.
Permanent Dominican Republic
staff members of the Peace Corps
sent only one special message to
the Volunteers — they were to stay
in their barrios or villages until no
tified to move. This was an attempt

to keep them out of the range of
gunfire and off the roads where
