# The
						Dominican Revolt— 'Friend, It's Your Fight'
## 
### 
The Peace Corps has passed its severest test to date — survival amid
revolution in the Dominican Republic.
According to some, it was the Peace Corps versus the War Corps.
Barry Goldwater lumped the two together and called them the "Freedom
Corps."
On April 24 the U. S. Marines landed in the Dominican Republic with
the expressed intention of helping to save America nationals. They fought
alongside the Dominican Republic government forces after deciding
communists had infiltrated the rebel units.
It was common knowledge that Peace Corps nurses were working in
hospitals in rebel areas, patching up the soldiers who had been shot by
the Marines.
The majority of Peace Corps Volunteers were sympathetic to the rebels
because the Dominicans with whom they worked and lived were on the
rebel side, according to Peace Corps officials.
Remarkably little criticism surrounded the Peace Corps actions —
although a few newspapers ran editorials like the Richmond News Leader's
which asked "just exactly where the Corps' humanitarian objectives leave
off and the legitimate requirements of national loyalty resume."
In a syndicated column, Goldwater compared the Dominican Republic
to Cuba and said, "Imagine who could have done the most to bring real
peace to Cuba. Peace Corps Volunteers, who would have been lined up
and shot pretty early in the Castro game, or U. S. Marines who could have
restored the order needed for free elections?"
But even he went on to praise the Peace Corps' Dominican Republic
action, saying the Volunteers "simply prove by their action that America
has not only an iron fist but a warm heart."
Dr. Joseph Colmen, Deputy Associate Director of the Peace Corps,

said the Volunteers "generally felt
their projects had been disturbed
. . . yet they felt they were needed
then. If they really had any sense
of commitment, to leave without
any sense of continuity would dem
onstrate a lack of faith."
It wasn't easy. According to Dr.
Colmen, Volunteers were plagued
by horrible living conditions, little
food and less sleep, as well as anti-
American sentiment.
There was also the danger of be
ing caught in the crossfire.
The home office of the Peace
Corps conducted a "continuous
assessment" of safety conditions in
the Dominican Republic, according
to Dr. Colmen. He and another
Peace Corps official visited the Do
minican Republic to see how safe
the Volunteers were.
Permanent Dominican Republic
staff members of the Peace Corps
sent only one special message to
the Volunteers — they were to stay
in their barrios or villages until no
tified to move. This was an attempt
