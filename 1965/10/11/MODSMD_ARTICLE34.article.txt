# Friction, Culture Shock Seen In Peace Corps Administration
## 
### Robert Johnston 
David Reisman claims that the job the Peace
Corps has taken on is impossible. He may be right,
but nobody who let that sort of an attitude stop
him ever accomplished much. The answer is al
ways the same, "We shall overcome."
But to say so doesn't make it so, and the hard
reality of actually getting out and doing something
usually hits Peace Corps Volunteers pretty hard.
One of them writing from Peru said:
I live in a picturesque bamboo mat house
I built myself. I buy my water from a pic
turesque boy with a burro loaded down with
water cans. I read and write under a kero
sene lantern, sleep on a cot, and cook on a
camp stove. There comes a day when all this
suddenly becomes no longer picturesque, no
longer quaint, but furiously frustrating and
you want like crazy to just get out of there,
to go home. This is called "culture shock."
It happens to one and all, usually about the
third or fourth month.
Something akin to culture shock has hit the
Peace Corps. It came to realize fairly quickly that
the beneficent, all-knowing American dispensing
skills, knowledge and friendliness around the world
wasn't going to get very far.
When a school in Peru needs a roof, it does no
good for two or three Volunteers to spend a day
putting it up. "It would always be a gift, the
gringo's roof. When it needed fixing, no one would
fix it," explained a Volunteer. It has to be "their
roof on their school."
So the outlook of Peace Corps officials is begin
ning to change. Fortunately, changes arc possible,
for no government agency is more ready to listen
to dissent and internal or external criticism or more
afraid of becoming stodgy and bureaucratic than
"Peace Corps Washington." (This doesn't make it
immune, however, to biting accusations on all these
points from the field.)
Any other government agency, with the possible
exceptions of the Office of Economic Opportunity
and the Commission on Equal Employment Oppor
tunities, both of which steal Peace Corps staff
regularly, would be thrown into a death trauma if it
tried to put through a regulation limiting staff ten
ure to five years. Congress approved such a rule
for the Peace Corps last summer.
Few other government agencies encourage this
internal criticism, dissent and friction the way the
Peace Corps officials do. And this attitude is now
spilling over into philosophies of what the Peace
Corps is for and what kind of Volunteers are
sought.
The Peace Corps' Deputy Director Warren Wig
gins says, "We used to work a little too hard to fit
Volunteers into the Peace Corps mold. Now we
are taking in more 'high risk-high gain' Volunteers
who may cause us more trouble overseas but who
arc worth it in terms of what some of them are
able to accomplish. We want people with a point
of view."
As another official says, "Volunteers really need
to be socially and politically conscious." College
students who are "questioning the extent to which
society is represented by institutional frameworks
and institutionalized behavior" are highly prized by
recruiters.
Wiggins says, "We still have the old goals of ser
vice, fulfilling needs in underdeveloped countries,
providing education and bringing maturity to our
Volunteers, but we desperately want to display this
new viewpoint of social and political consciousness,
the affinity in our Washington building for campus
thought."
The word revolution is not frowned on at
Peace Corps Washington. It may even sponsor
a teach-in. It regularly holds up Dean Rusk's own
statement to State Department officials, "The Peace
Corps is not an agent of U. S. foreign policy." No
attempt is made to have Volunteers parrot or even
defend U. S. foreign policy.
The Peace Corps is seen as an agent of social
change and innovation and is recognizing this as
its most promising role at home as well as abroad.
It is even introducing into this country an exchange

Peace Corps, students from abroad brought here to
teach outgoing Volunteers and to aid in this coun
try's poverty program.
In fact the idea of youth corps sent out to stim
ulate and speed up laggard parts of a fast-moving
world, to keep the world revolution in economics,
expectations, organization and industrialism peace
ful and fast-moving, is gaining momentum and re
spect in many different countries as well as at home.
The Foreign Minister of Thailand recently paid
tribute to the Peace Corps and to the United States.
"It is indeed striking that this most important idea,
the most powerful idea in recent times, of a Peace
Corps, of youth mingling, living, working with
youth, should come from this mightiest nation on
earth, the United States," he said.
And these revolutionary developments to which
the Peace Corps is dedicated work in both direc
tions. For in the interaction that takes place be
tween the Volunteer and the community into which
he is thrust and which he has to understand and
help to organize and develop, both sides are pro
foundly affected.
"If I've learned anything here, I've learned I
know nothing of Thai people. The unique quality of
having a home in Thailand is the individuality of
the experience. And to get tq my number one con
cern — that which 1 need to understand most —
there's me. It would be impossible to estimate how
much I have changed, how much I have learned,
what I now easily accept as a part of the world
and what I now can or cannot understand.
"My perspective has been broadened. I have met
a new environment and culture, and I have accepted
it as well as been accepted by it. I have seen life
from a different point of view. I have learned a
new way of speaking about things and a new way
of looking at things."
Another Volunteer wrote, "You cannot imagine
the gulf between East and 'West, and it makes me
laugh now to think that I expected to bridge it
with a smile and a handshake."
As anyone who attended the conference of re
turned Peace Corps Volunteers knows, changes are
deep and meaningful. Those who successfully
emerge from culture shock have acquired many
new values and orientations. The returnees were
rambunctious and perceptive. Viet Nam petitions
were spiritedly passed around the cafeteria of the
State Department building.
The Peace Corps' determination to be something
more than a world-wide welfare agency isn't always
carried through successfully into fact. But it is
asserted loudly that "We ARE different."
The gains often do seem miniscule; but when they
are added up — more than 10,000 Volunteers in
46 countries — there is some ground for optimism.
For it does seem safe to assert that in its first four
years the Peace Corps really has begun to develop
into an unequalcd instrument of social change and
innovation. Putting dedicated, perceptive and so
cially and politically conscious youth in the field
around the world, organizing and teaching on a
personal, one-to-one basis, community by commun
ity, is in fact revolutionary.
Not to give to people, to feed them and clothe
them and forget them, but to involve them in meet
ing their own needs, leading to their own self-fulfill
ment, is revolutionary. Wiggins admits that there
is a long way to go yet, that there is often more
talk than realization; but if any idea can remake the
world social "establishment", the Peace Corps idea,
or a succession of such ideas, can.

It is even introducing into this country an exchange

Peace Corps, students from abroad brought here to
teach outgoing Volunteers and to aid in this coun
try's poverty program.
In fact the idea of youth corps sent out to stim
ulate and speed up laggard parts of a fast-moving
world, to keep the world revolution in economics,
expectations, organization and industrialism peace
ful and fast-moving, is gaining momentum and re
spect in many different countries as well as at home.
The Foreign Minister of Thailand recently paid
tribute to the Peace Corps and to the United States.
"It is indeed striking that this most important idea,
the most powerful idea in recent times, of a Peace
Corps, of youth mingling, living, working with
youth, should come from this mightiest nation on
earth, the United States," he said.
And these revolutionary developments to which
the Peace Corps is dedicated work in both direc
tions. For in the interaction that takes place be
tween the Volunteer and the community into which
he is thrust and which he has to understand and
help to organize and develop, both sides are pro
foundly affected.
"If I've learned anything here, I've learned I
know nothing of Thai people. The unique quality of
having a home in Thailand is the individuality of
the experience. And to get tq my number one con
cern — that which 1 need to understand most —
there's me. It would be impossible to estimate how
much I have changed, how much I have learned,
what I now easily accept as a part of the world
and what I now can or cannot understand.
"My perspective has been broadened. I have met
a new environment and culture, and I have accepted
it as well as been accepted by it. I have seen life
from a different point of view. I have learned a
new way of speaking about things and a new way
of looking at things."
Another Volunteer wrote, "You cannot imagine
the gulf between East and 'West, and it makes me
laugh now to think that I expected to bridge it
with a smile and a handshake."
As anyone who attended the conference of re
turned Peace Corps Volunteers knows, changes are
deep and meaningful. Those who successfully
emerge from culture shock have acquired many
new values and orientations. The returnees were
rambunctious and perceptive. Viet Nam petitions
were spiritedly passed around the cafeteria of the
State Department building.
The Peace Corps' determination to be something
more than a world-wide welfare agency isn't always
carried through successfully into fact. But it is
asserted loudly that "We ARE different."
The gains often do seem miniscule; but when they
are added up — more than 10,000 Volunteers in
46 countries — there is some ground for optimism.
For it does seem safe to assert that in its first four
years the Peace Corps really has begun to develop
into an unequalcd instrument of social change and
innovation. Putting dedicated, perceptive and so
cially and politically conscious youth in the field
around the world, organizing and teaching on a
personal, one-to-one basis, community by commun
ity, is in fact revolutionary.
Not to give to people, to feed them and clothe
them and forget them, but to involve them in meet
ing their own needs, leading to their own self-fulfill
ment, is revolutionary. Wiggins admits that there
is a long way to go yet, that there is often more
talk than realization; but if any idea can remake the
world social "establishment", the Peace Corps idea,
or a succession of such ideas, can.
David Reisman claims that the job the Peace
Corps has taken on is impossible. He may be right,
but nobody who let that sort of an attitude stop
him ever accomplished much. The answer is al
ways the same, "We shall overcome."
But to say so doesn't make it so, and the hard
reality of actually getting out and doing something
usually hits Peace Corps Volunteers pretty hard.
One of them writing from Peru said:
I live in a picturesque bamboo mat house
I built myself. I buy my water from a pic
turesque boy with a burro loaded down with
water cans. I read and write under a kero
sene lantern, sleep on a cot, and cook on a
camp stove. There comes a day when all this
suddenly becomes no longer picturesque, no
longer quaint, but furiously frustrating and
you want like crazy to just get out of there,
to go home. This is called "culture shock."
It happens to one and all, usually about the
third or fourth month.
Something akin to culture shock has hit the
Peace Corps. It came to realize fairly quickly that
the beneficent, all-knowing American dispensing
skills, knowledge and friendliness around the world
wasn't going to get very far.
When a school in Peru needs a roof, it does no
good for two or three Volunteers to spend a day
putting it up. "It would always be a gift, the
gringo's roof. When it needed fixing, no one would
fix it," explained a Volunteer. It has to be "their
roof on their school."
So the outlook of Peace Corps officials is begin
ning to change. Fortunately, changes arc possible,
for no government agency is more ready to listen
to dissent and internal or external criticism or more
afraid of becoming stodgy and bureaucratic than
"Peace Corps Washington." (This doesn't make it
immune, however, to biting accusations on all these
points from the field.)
Any other government agency, with the possible
exceptions of the Office of Economic Opportunity
and the Commission on Equal Employment Oppor
tunities, both of which steal Peace Corps staff
regularly, would be thrown into a death trauma if it
tried to put through a regulation limiting staff ten
ure to five years. Congress approved such a rule
for the Peace Corps last summer.
Few other government agencies encourage this
internal criticism, dissent and friction the way the
Peace Corps officials do. And this attitude is now
spilling over into philosophies of what the Peace
Corps is for and what kind of Volunteers are
sought.
The Peace Corps' Deputy Director Warren Wig
gins says, "We used to work a little too hard to fit
Volunteers into the Peace Corps mold. Now we
are taking in more 'high risk-high gain' Volunteers
who may cause us more trouble overseas but who
arc worth it in terms of what some of them are
able to accomplish. We want people with a point
of view."
As another official says, "Volunteers really need
to be socially and politically conscious." College
students who are "questioning the extent to which
society is represented by institutional frameworks
and institutionalized behavior" are highly prized by
recruiters.
Wiggins says, "We still have the old goals of ser
vice, fulfilling needs in underdeveloped countries,
providing education and bringing maturity to our
Volunteers, but we desperately want to display this
new viewpoint of social and political consciousness,
the affinity in our Washington building for campus
thought."
The word revolution is not frowned on at
Peace Corps Washington. It may even sponsor
a teach-in. It regularly holds up Dean Rusk's own
statement to State Department officials, "The Peace
Corps is not an agent of U. S. foreign policy." No
attempt is made to have Volunteers parrot or even
defend U. S. foreign policy.
The Peace Corps is seen as an agent of social
change and innovation and is recognizing this as
its most promising role at home as well as abroad.

reality of actually getting out and doing something
usually hits Peace Corps Volunteers pretty hard.
One of them writing from Peru said:
I live in a picturesque bamboo mat house
I built myself. I buy my water from a pic
turesque boy with a burro loaded down with
water cans. I read and write under a kero
sene lantern, sleep on a cot, and cook on a
camp stove. There comes a day when all this
suddenly becomes no longer picturesque, no
longer quaint, but furiously frustrating and
you want like crazy to just get out of there,
to go home. This is called "culture shock."
It happens to one and all, usually about the
third or fourth month.
Something akin to culture shock has hit the
Peace Corps. It came to realize fairly quickly that
the beneficent, all-knowing American dispensing
skills, knowledge and friendliness around the world
wasn't going to get very far.
When a school in Peru needs a roof, it does no
good for two or three Volunteers to spend a day
putting it up. "It would always be a gift, the
gringo's roof. When it needed fixing, no one would
fix it," explained a Volunteer. It has to be "their
roof on their school."
So the outlook of Peace Corps officials is begin
ning to change. Fortunately, changes arc possible,
for no government agency is more ready to listen
to dissent and internal or external criticism or more
afraid of becoming stodgy and bureaucratic than
"Peace Corps Washington." (This doesn't make it
immune, however, to biting accusations on all these
points from the field.)
Any other government agency, with the possible
exceptions of the Office of Economic Opportunity
and the Commission on Equal Employment Oppor
tunities, both of which steal Peace Corps staff
regularly, would be thrown into a death trauma if it
tried to put through a regulation limiting staff ten
ure to five years. Congress approved such a rule
for the Peace Corps last summer.
Few other government agencies encourage this
internal criticism, dissent and friction the way the
Peace Corps officials do. And this attitude is now
spilling over into philosophies of what the Peace
Corps is for and what kind of Volunteers are
sought.
The Peace Corps' Deputy Director Warren Wig
gins says, "We used to work a little too hard to fit
Volunteers into the Peace Corps mold. Now we
are taking in more 'high risk-high gain' Volunteers
who may cause us more trouble overseas but who
arc worth it in terms of what some of them are
able to accomplish. We want people with a point
of view."
As another official says, "Volunteers really need
to be socially and politically conscious." College
students who are "questioning the extent to which
society is represented by institutional frameworks
and institutionalized behavior" are highly prized by
recruiters.
Wiggins says, "We still have the old goals of ser
vice, fulfilling needs in underdeveloped countries,
providing education and bringing maturity to our
Volunteers, but we desperately want to display this
new viewpoint of social and political consciousness,
the affinity in our Washington building for campus
thought."
The word revolution is not frowned on at
Peace Corps Washington. It may even sponsor
a teach-in. It regularly holds up Dean Rusk's own
statement to State Department officials, "The Peace
Corps is not an agent of U. S. foreign policy." No
attempt is made to have Volunteers parrot or even
defend U. S. foreign policy.
The Peace Corps is seen as an agent of social
change and innovation and is recognizing this as
its most promising role at home as well as abroad.
It is even introducing into this country an exchange

Peace Corps, students from abroad brought here to
teach outgoing Volunteers and to aid in this coun
try's poverty program.
In fact the idea of youth corps sent out to stim
ulate and speed up laggard parts of a fast-moving
world, to keep the world revolution in economics,
expectations, organization and industrialism peace
ful and fast-moving, is gaining momentum and re
spect in many different countries as well as at home.
The Foreign Minister of Thailand recently paid
tribute to the Peace Corps and to the United States.
"It is indeed striking that this most important idea,
the most powerful idea in recent times, of a Peace
Corps, of youth mingling, living, working with
youth, should come from this mightiest nation on
earth, the United States," he said.
And these revolutionary developments to which
the Peace Corps is dedicated work in both direc
tions. For in the interaction that takes place be
tween the Volunteer and the community into which
he is thrust and which he has to understand and
help to organize and develop, both sides are pro
foundly affected.
"If I've learned anything here, I've learned I
know nothing of Thai people. The unique quality of
having a home in Thailand is the individuality of
the experience. And to get tq my number one con
cern — that which 1 need to understand most —
there's me. It would be impossible to estimate how
much I have changed, how much I have learned,
what I now easily accept as a part of the world
and what I now can or cannot understand.
"My perspective has been broadened. I have met
a new environment and culture, and I have accepted
it as well as been accepted by it. I have seen life
from a different point of view. I have learned a
new way of speaking about things and a new way
of looking at things."
Another Volunteer wrote, "You cannot imagine
the gulf between East and 'West, and it makes me
laugh now to think that I expected to bridge it
with a smile and a handshake."
As anyone who attended the conference of re
turned Peace Corps Volunteers knows, changes are
deep and meaningful. Those who successfully
emerge from culture shock have acquired many
new values and orientations. The returnees were
rambunctious and perceptive. Viet Nam petitions
were spiritedly passed around the cafeteria of the
State Department building.
The Peace Corps' determination to be something
more than a world-wide welfare agency isn't always
carried through successfully into fact. But it is
asserted loudly that "We ARE different."
The gains often do seem miniscule; but when they
are added up — more than 10,000 Volunteers in
46 countries — there is some ground for optimism.
For it does seem safe to assert that in its first four
years the Peace Corps really has begun to develop
into an unequalcd instrument of social change and
innovation. Putting dedicated, perceptive and so
cially and politically conscious youth in the field
around the world, organizing and teaching on a
personal, one-to-one basis, community by commun
ity, is in fact revolutionary.
Not to give to people, to feed them and clothe
them and forget them, but to involve them in meet
ing their own needs, leading to their own self-fulfill
ment, is revolutionary. Wiggins admits that there
is a long way to go yet, that there is often more
talk than realization; but if any idea can remake the
world social "establishment", the Peace Corps idea,
or a succession of such ideas, can.
David Reisman claims that the job the Peace
Corps has taken on is impossible. He may be right,
but nobody who let that sort of an attitude stop
him ever accomplished much. The answer is al
ways the same, "We shall overcome."

world, to keep the world revolution in economics,
expectations, organization and industrialism peace
ful and fast-moving, is gaining momentum and re
spect in many different countries as well as at home.
The Foreign Minister of Thailand recently paid
tribute to the Peace Corps and to the United States.
"It is indeed striking that this most important idea,
the most powerful idea in recent times, of a Peace
Corps, of youth mingling, living, working with
youth, should come from this mightiest nation on
earth, the United States," he said.
And these revolutionary developments to which
the Peace Corps is dedicated work in both direc
tions. For in the interaction that takes place be
tween the Volunteer and the community into which
he is thrust and which he has to understand and
help to organize and develop, both sides are pro
foundly affected.
"If I've learned anything here, I've learned I
know nothing of Thai people. The unique quality of
having a home in Thailand is the individuality of
the experience. And to get tq my number one con
cern — that which 1 need to understand most —
there's me. It would be impossible to estimate how
much I have changed, how much I have learned,
what I now easily accept as a part of the world
and what I now can or cannot understand.
"My perspective has been broadened. I have met
a new environment and culture, and I have accepted
it as well as been accepted by it. I have seen life
from a different point of view. I have learned a
new way of speaking about things and a new way
of looking at things."
Another Volunteer wrote, "You cannot imagine
the gulf between East and 'West, and it makes me
laugh now to think that I expected to bridge it
with a smile and a handshake."
As anyone who attended the conference of re
turned Peace Corps Volunteers knows, changes are
deep and meaningful. Those who successfully
emerge from culture shock have acquired many
new values and orientations. The returnees were
rambunctious and perceptive. Viet Nam petitions
were spiritedly passed around the cafeteria of the
State Department building.
The Peace Corps' determination to be something
more than a world-wide welfare agency isn't always
carried through successfully into fact. But it is
asserted loudly that "We ARE different."
The gains often do seem miniscule; but when they
are added up — more than 10,000 Volunteers in
46 countries — there is some ground for optimism.
For it does seem safe to assert that in its first four
years the Peace Corps really has begun to develop
into an unequalcd instrument of social change and
innovation. Putting dedicated, perceptive and so
cially and politically conscious youth in the field
around the world, organizing and teaching on a
personal, one-to-one basis, community by commun
ity, is in fact revolutionary.
Not to give to people, to feed them and clothe
them and forget them, but to involve them in meet
ing their own needs, leading to their own self-fulfill
ment, is revolutionary. Wiggins admits that there
is a long way to go yet, that there is often more
talk than realization; but if any idea can remake the
world social "establishment", the Peace Corps idea,
or a succession of such ideas, can.
David Reisman claims that the job the Peace
Corps has taken on is impossible. He may be right,
but nobody who let that sort of an attitude stop
him ever accomplished much. The answer is al
ways the same, "We shall overcome."
But to say so doesn't make it so, and the hard
reality of actually getting out and doing something
usually hits Peace Corps Volunteers pretty hard.
One of them writing from Peru said:
I live in a picturesque bamboo mat house
I built myself. I buy my water from a pic
turesque boy with a burro loaded down with
water cans. I read and write under a kero
sene lantern, sleep on a cot, and cook on a
camp stove. There comes a day when all this
suddenly becomes no longer picturesque, no
longer quaint, but furiously frustrating and
you want like crazy to just get out of there,
to go home. This is called "culture shock."
It happens to one and all, usually about the
third or fourth month.
Something akin to culture shock has hit the
Peace Corps. It came to realize fairly quickly that
the beneficent, all-knowing American dispensing
skills, knowledge and friendliness around the world
wasn't going to get very far.
When a school in Peru needs a roof, it does no
good for two or three Volunteers to spend a day
putting it up. "It would always be a gift, the
gringo's roof. When it needed fixing, no one would
fix it," explained a Volunteer. It has to be "their
roof on their school."
So the outlook of Peace Corps officials is begin
ning to change. Fortunately, changes arc possible,
for no government agency is more ready to listen
to dissent and internal or external criticism or more
afraid of becoming stodgy and bureaucratic than
"Peace Corps Washington." (This doesn't make it
immune, however, to biting accusations on all these
points from the field.)
Any other government agency, with the possible
exceptions of the Office of Economic Opportunity
and the Commission on Equal Employment Oppor
tunities, both of which steal Peace Corps staff
regularly, would be thrown into a death trauma if it
tried to put through a regulation limiting staff ten
ure to five years. Congress approved such a rule
for the Peace Corps last summer.
Few other government agencies encourage this
internal criticism, dissent and friction the way the
Peace Corps officials do. And this attitude is now
spilling over into philosophies of what the Peace
Corps is for and what kind of Volunteers are
sought.
The Peace Corps' Deputy Director Warren Wig
gins says, "We used to work a little too hard to fit
Volunteers into the Peace Corps mold. Now we
are taking in more 'high risk-high gain' Volunteers
who may cause us more trouble overseas but who
arc worth it in terms of what some of them are
able to accomplish. We want people with a point
of view."
As another official says, "Volunteers really need
to be socially and politically conscious." College
students who are "questioning the extent to which
society is represented by institutional frameworks
and institutionalized behavior" are highly prized by
recruiters.
Wiggins says, "We still have the old goals of ser
vice, fulfilling needs in underdeveloped countries,
providing education and bringing maturity to our
Volunteers, but we desperately want to display this
new viewpoint of social and political consciousness,
the affinity in our Washington building for campus
thought."
The word revolution is not frowned on at
Peace Corps Washington. It may even sponsor
a teach-in. It regularly holds up Dean Rusk's own
statement to State Department officials, "The Peace
Corps is not an agent of U. S. foreign policy." No
attempt is made to have Volunteers parrot or even
defend U. S. foreign policy.
The Peace Corps is seen as an agent of social
change and innovation and is recognizing this as
its most promising role at home as well as abroad.
It is even introducing into this country an exchange

Peace Corps, students from abroad brought here to
teach outgoing Volunteers and to aid in this coun
try's poverty program.
