# How To Smoke Out 'Aware' PCVs
## Hazy Image Hurts Peace Corps 
### Mary Richardson 
Can the Peace Corps be non-political and expect today's politically
volatile student to seek it out? Then again, what does the average Volun
teer have in common with Smokey the Bear?
Frank Mankiewicz, chief of Peace Corps operations in Latin America,
says the "Smokey the Bear" or "do-gooder" conception of the Peace
Corps is a problem because the Peace Corps image is not fully developed.
The compensation factor if there is unhappiness with "Smokey" halos is
the benefits that come from a favorable image.
The Peace Corps is contrarily seen by Mankiewicz and others as "highly
political." Awakening an underdeveloped area to its "community sense
of potential" takes political understanding by the politically-aware Volun
teer.
Don McClure, Associate Director of the Peace Corps for Public Affairs,
who has just returned from two years in Africa, said, "I feel our problem

is a 'blurred' image. I've been talk
ing with college interns here at
Peace Corps all summer, and it's
obvious we've done a poor job of
communicating on the campus. They
tell me they had only a vague idea,
or erroneous ideas, about Peace
Corps before they came here. The
encouraging thing to me is that the
more they learn about Peace Corps,
the more inclined they are to want
to join. So that's my job." And to
carry out the specific ways of better
informing campuses, Mr. McClure
said, the Peace Corps will use semi
nars and discussion groups on cam
puses this year which will include
student leaders, key faculty mem
bers, returned Volunteers and top
Peace Corps staffers.
