# ETV Grows
## 
### 
The primary Peace Corps mis
sion in educational television is to
teach inhabitants of developing
countries to run the entire program
themselvesâ€”not simply to increase
the number of student viewers,
according to Tedson Meyers, head
of educational TV projects for
the Peace Corps.
Two chief problems the original
43 "ETV" Volunteers faced in a
project in Colombia were to over
come the indifference of a people
who had tried TV four times before
and failed, and then to get the
Colombians in charge of TV and
those in charge of education to
work together.
The Colombian project, now 150
Volunteers strong, uses film mate
rials taken in the country, art work
and animals for its broadcasts.
ETV goes up to fifth grade level
in math, social sciences and Spanish.
Adult education is also offered to
increase literacy in outlying villages.
Operations similar to the Colom
bia project are being started in
Peru and Malaysia. In these areas
there will be a greater amount of
pre-broadcast work with the teach
ers and follow-up training through
the Volunteers themselves.
Meyers counts as one measure of
the success of ETV the fact that
presently all the production crews
are Colombian. Volunteers who
have come to the area since 1963
arc also more professionally exper
ienced in TV, and the entire Colom
bia plan will be financially on its
own at the end of 1965.
