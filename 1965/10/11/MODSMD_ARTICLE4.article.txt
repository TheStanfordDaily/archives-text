KJL) NOTE: In increasing numbers
Stanford Students are becoming in
volved in areas outside the immedi
ate community. This week marks
the beginning of intensive concern
with two areas; The Peace Corps,
and the war in Viet Nam.

A week of intensive efforts to re
cruit Stanford students for the Peace
Corps begins today with a 5 p.m.
talk in Cubberly Auditorium by Peace
Corps Deputy Director Warren W.
Wiggins.
The recent labeling of the Peace
Corps "as a nice middle-class thing to
do" by some activist students has
particularly dismayed Wiggins, who
iias invited all Stanford student lead
ers to his talk today.
Talks and Movies
More talks and movies throughout
the week will bombard the Stanford
student with information about the
Peace Corps. A table stocked with aj>-
plications and n e w 1 y published

Union and in the Main Library from
S a.m. to 10 p.m. all week.
"Students ought to fill out an appli
cation and take the one-hour test

even il' they are only vaguely inter
ested," stated Western Region Re

offers as he likes without endanger
ing his status," he explained.

given two and three times a day
starting tomorrow coupled with an
additional optional hour of testing in
French or Spanish.

"In six African countries over half
the high school teachers with college
degrees are Peace Corps volunteers,"
pointed out Regional Recruiting Di
rector Graham. Further underlining
the need for volunteers, he explained
that while 12,000 Peace Corpsmen are
presently in 46 countries, 24 more

countries have requested volunteers.
Volunteers who can teach are those
most requested by developing nations.
Persons with training in math and
sciences are in particular demand,
with agriculture majors ranking sec
ond.
Half of all Peace Corps volunteers
are liberal arts majors.
Out of all United States Universi
ties, Stanford sends the most Peace
Corps volunteers per capita to over
seas countries.
Many returned volunteers attend
Stanford to complete advanced and
Returnees speak to groups, furnish
materials for study or for journals,
act as teaching assistants, and help
in foreign student guidance pro
grams.
Contact of the returned volunteers
with his own particular local culture
is one of the three main goals of tho
Peace Corps program.
