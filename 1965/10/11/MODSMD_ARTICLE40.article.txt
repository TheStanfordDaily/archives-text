# RE-ENTRY CRISIS:
## 
### Walter Grant 
In the midst of wide-spread pub
licity concerning a "re-entry crisis"
for returning Peace Corps Volun
teers, officials claim few of the
Volunteers actually face major
problems.
Several top officials at the Peace
Corps headquarters said news media
have overemphasized difficulties
experienced by Volunteers in re
joining American society. But most
agree the Volunteers do require a
readjustment period.
Dr. Joseph English, of the Peace
Corps medical division, terms the
re-entry process a "challenge." The
idea of a crisis has been "very much
overemphasized," Dr. English said.
"The average Volunteer is glad to be
home."
The main problem of the return
ing Volunteer is finding a meaning
ful situation with responsibility, ac
cording to Dr. English.
As a result of their responsibility
overseas, ex-Volunteers need a stim
ulating job which provides independ
ence and a source of commitment,
according to Dr. Joseph Colmen,
Deputy Associate Director of the
Peace Corps.
Dr. Colmen said many Volun
teers develop a new set of values
while serving with the Peace Corps.
"They become shocked at the
way some Americans think," he said.
Ex-Volunteers experience frustra
tions before finding the type of work
where they can make a significant
contribution, Dr. Colmen added.
In reporting a conference of more
than 1,000 ex-Volunteers, some of
the national news media empha
sized these problems. Life maga
zine asserted that "Volunteers feel
unwanted, uncomfortable, apologetic
or defensive."
In an article entitled "The Re-
Entry Crisis," Life said, "Thick files
of pain-touched letters in Peace

Corps headquarters testify that vir
tually all the returnees suffered when
they came back." The article quoted
Volunteers saying, "The first month
was hell." "I was depressed for six
weeks." "It was difficult to get
through the whole day."
Peace Corps officials are quick to
claim that the article did not repre
sent the average returning Volun
teer. Peace Corps staffer David
Gelman, a former reporter for the
New York Post, asked in a staff
newsletter, "Was it a documentary
about ex-junkies?"
Gelman attacked Life as a mem
ber of the "brick outhouse school
of journalism . . . where facts are
bricks with which you can build an
outhouse or the Taj Mahal."
Other officials also rejected the
article as overly dramatic. Dr. Eng
lish said only a small number of
Volunteers have any real difficulty
in readjusting to American society.
In reference to one Volunteer
who reportedly continued to wear
the national dress of Pakistan after
returning to the U. S., Dr. English
said it is unusual for a Volunteer to
wear a country's national dress even
while abroad.
Most Volunteers return with a
deep appreciation for the United
States, according to Dr. English.
He said returning Volunteers are
excited to be back in a modern
society. The typical Volunteer has
a genuine desire to gain more knowl
edge, he said. About 40 per cent of
the returned Volunteers presently
are continuing their education.

ing Volunteer is finding a meaning
ful situation with responsibility, ac
cording to Dr. English.
As a result of their responsibility
overseas, ex-Volunteers need a stim
ulating job which provides independ
ence and a source of commitment,
according to Dr. Joseph Colmen,
Deputy Associate Director of the
Peace Corps.
Dr. Colmen said many Volun
teers develop a new set of values
while serving with the Peace Corps.
"They become shocked at the
way some Americans think," he said.
Ex-Volunteers experience frustra
tions before finding the type of work
where they can make a significant
contribution, Dr. Colmen added.
In reporting a conference of more
than 1,000 ex-Volunteers, some of
the national news media empha
sized these problems. Life maga
zine asserted that "Volunteers feel
unwanted, uncomfortable, apologetic
or defensive."
In an article entitled "The Re-
Entry Crisis," Life said, "Thick files
of pain-touched letters in Peace

Corps headquarters testify that vir
tually all the returnees suffered when
they came back." The article quoted
Volunteers saying, "The first month
was hell." "I was depressed for six
weeks." "It was difficult to get
through the whole day."
Peace Corps officials are quick to
claim that the article did not repre
sent the average returning Volun
teer. Peace Corps staffer David
Gelman, a former reporter for the
New York Post, asked in a staff
newsletter, "Was it a documentary
about ex-junkies?"
Gelman attacked Life as a mem
ber of the "brick outhouse school
of journalism . . . where facts are
bricks with which you can build an
outhouse or the Taj Mahal."
Other officials also rejected the
article as overly dramatic. Dr. Eng
lish said only a small number of
Volunteers have any real difficulty
in readjusting to American society.
In reference to one Volunteer
who reportedly continued to wear
the national dress of Pakistan after
returning to the U. S., Dr. English
said it is unusual for a Volunteer to
wear a country's national dress even
while abroad.
Most Volunteers return with a
deep appreciation for the United
States, according to Dr. English.
He said returning Volunteers are
excited to be back in a modern
society. The typical Volunteer has
a genuine desire to gain more knowl
edge, he said. About 40 per cent of
the returned Volunteers presently
are continuing their education.
In the midst of wide-spread pub
licity concerning a "re-entry crisis"
for returning Peace Corps Volun
teers, officials claim few of the
Volunteers actually face major
problems.
Several top officials at the Peace
Corps headquarters said news media
have overemphasized difficulties
experienced by Volunteers in re
joining American society. But most
agree the Volunteers do require a
readjustment period.
Dr. Joseph English, of the Peace
Corps medical division, terms the
re-entry process a "challenge." The
idea of a crisis has been "very much
overemphasized," Dr. English said.
"The average Volunteer is glad to be
home."
