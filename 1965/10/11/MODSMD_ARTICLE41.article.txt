# Officials Claim Overemphasis

Dr. Colmen said the Volunteer
faces a period of readjustment faced
by anyone who leaves his culture
and comes back. "And most Volun
teers have become deeply involved
in another culture," he added.
Officials agree that the main prob
lem of the returning Volunteer is
learning how to influence American
society as a private citizen. Dr.
English explains that the Volunteers
are used to working in a unique
situation where tangible results can
be seen.
An official of the Career Infor
mation Office of the Peace Corps
reported that over 80 per cent of
the Volunteers have at least a
bachelor's degree. "It's finding the
right kind of job that is difficult,"
he pointed out.
The spokesman said only one per
cent of ex-Volunteers are unem
ployed. He noted that many colleges
and universities have special schol
arships and fellowships for ex-Vol
unteers.
During the conference for ex-
Volunteers, a proposal to form a
veteran's association was rejected.
The Volunteers said they wanted to
solve their problems individually.
Dr. English cited the rejection as
evidence of growth and maturity.
In regard to the conference. Vice
President Hubert Humphrey said,
"What emerged most impressively
was the potential of the Volunteers,
and their desire to act, to serve, to
take part in the tasks which lie
ahead for this nation and the
world."
