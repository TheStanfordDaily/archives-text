# Sit-Ins Boring? Try Peace Corps
## 
### 
Have you been arrested five times
in the last five months for sitting in?
Do you think we should ban the
bomb, integrate Mississippi into the
United States, abolish the State De
partment and turn the Met over to
folksingers?
The Peace Corps is just your cup
of espresso.
Once you can sneak through the
glorified college boards they use for
selection (forge some good refer
ences and tell them you're from
Berkeley and you're in), and en
dure the glorified Boy Scout train
ing program (be stoic), you're on
your own, free to foment ferment
and to organize community spirit to
build ever higher standards of living
and topple imperialists.
There's no business like revolution
to stir your blood, give you exper
ience in fighting injustice, round out
your education (the educated man
simply MUST know how to debeak
chickens) and alienate the estab
lishment.
It's the way out of every identity
crisis (and if you aren't having an
identity crisis, the Peace Corps
doesn't want you), the road to uni-

fication of the world behind a pro
gram of eradicating evil.
What have you got to lose but
your anonymity?
