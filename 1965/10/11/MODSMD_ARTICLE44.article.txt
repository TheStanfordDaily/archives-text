# Capitol Hill Consents Without Much Advice
## 
### Mary Richardson 
To avoid an insular view of the
Peace Corps image, this reporter
went to Capitol Hill for an evalua
tion.
From the youngest Congressman
in Washington, interviewed right off
the House floor between quorum
calls, to the elder Senator caught
in his office between committee
hearings, the over-all consensus is
that the Peace Corps image is still
one of vitality and independence.
Senator Ross Bass (D-Tenn)
commented: "The Peace Corps may
not be as glamorous as it was ear
lier because of the newness of its
beginning, 112 still think that it is a
vital organization and is an impor
tant unit in our international affairs.
As with some other government
agencies, I hope that some of the
dullness because of age does not
degenerate the enthusiasm of those
entering the Corps."
Senator Stuart Symington (D-
Mo) did not agree that the Peace
Corps image has dulled. He said,
"I think the Corps is doing a good
job and the American people are
getting more for their money than
with any other aid program."
Making a new compa-ison, Sena
tor Edward Long (D-Mo) re
marked he "had the impression that
the Peace Corps had not been func
tioning as favorably in its com
munications as it could" but that
he was "very, very enthusiastic"
over its program. A member of
Rotary International, the Senator
said the Peace Corps Volunteer idea
had been patterned after the Rotary
overseas schools and both organiza
tions helped others understand
America through United States vol
unteers.
Congressman Ogden Reid (R
-NY) hoped the administrative de
lays in communication could be
corrected but saw the Peace Corps
as "one of the most important pro
grams wherein Americans can serve

in new dimensions of peace on an
equals-to-equals basis."
Congressman Jed Johnson, Jr.
(D-Okla) saw the Peace Corps as
one of the most "imaginative pro
grams" initiated by the U. S. He
found that the Corps' particular
value was in "creatively channeling
efforts and aspirations of American
young people toward directly build
ing a better world."
There was certainly no gloom and
doom to report from this random
check with leaders on the Hill. Vol
unteers can be assured that the
vitality of the Peace Corps they
thought was â€” still is.
