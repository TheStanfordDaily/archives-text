# Volunteers From India Fight Poverty War in U.S.
## Experiment Could Encourage New 'Reverse Peace Corps' 
### 
Five volunteers from India have
joined the war on poverty in the
United States in what could be the
beginning of a large-scale "Reverse
Peace Corps."
The Indian volunteers, who joined
the fight against slums in Septem
ber, will spend a year working with
members of VISTA, Volunteers in
Service to America. The five spent
three summer months as instructors
at a Peace Corps training program
at St. John's College, Annapolis,
Md.
After a year's work with com
munity action projects, the volun
teers will return to India to work in
national service programs.
All five volunteers have univer
sity degrees, are fluent in English
and have had experience in India's
social work.

The experiment will enable the
government of India to decide
whether to establish its own Peace
Corps.
Harris WofTord, Associate Direc
tor of the Peace Corps, said the
possibility of a Reverse Peace Corps
is "in the air the same as the Peace
Corps was in the air in 1960." He
said the idea of such an exchange
program seems a natural thing.
The Reverse Peace Corps was
suggested about a year ago by Sar
gent Shriver, Director of the Peace
Corps.
Dr. Joseph Colmen, Deputy Asso
ciate Director, said the program
"could be very important because
it shows the United States is willing
to benefit from other countries."
In regard to an expanded pro
gram, Dr. Colmen said the United
States could accommodate hundreds
of volunteers from other countries
if a suitable method of financing
can be obtained.
The present project is being finan
ced on a joint basis, with funds ap
propriated by the United States,
India and private concerns.
Wofford said the program could
result in the Peace Corps "becom
ing a two-way street, what we've
always hoped it would be." He said
it was hoped the program would
accomplish the three original pur

poses of the Peace Corps Act, with
a reverse twist:
I—The Indian volunteers would
help America in its community ac
tion programs and at the same
time would gain experience that
would enable them upon their
return to better meet India's man
power needs.
2—lt would promote a better
understanding of America by other
peoples.
3—lt'would promote a better un
derstanding of other peoples by the
American people.
Wofford said the program also
could accomplish the fourth pur
pose of the Peace Corps added by
Congress — the encouragement and
assistance of national voluntary ser
vice programs by other countries.
The Indian volunteers are S. D.
Tyagi, 34, a civil service officer
who works on consolidation of land
holdings; L. K. Gupta, 34, an un
dersecretary to the Indian govern
ment; Krishna R. Patankar, 32, who
works in a national volunteer or
ganization in community and urban
development, especially slum pro
jects; N. K. Pathik, 27, a social ser
vices administrator; and Mrs.
Satwant B. Singh, 46, an assistant
sociologist in the rural planning
division of the Indian Ministry of
Health.

Volunteers as part of a new 'Reverse Peace Corps.'
