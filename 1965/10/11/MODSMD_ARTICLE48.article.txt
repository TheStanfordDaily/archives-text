Security officers around Washing
ton are a jumpy lot. Many a White
House Secret Service agent still re
calls in horror the 1956 inaugural
parade for President Eisenhower. A
famous movie cowboy sallied up to
the grandstand on his horse and
calmly lassoed the smiling Presi
dent.
Similar feelings of despair and
horror were recently occasioned
among State Department security
officers when the returned Peace
Corps Volunteer Conference was
held. Petitions protesting U. S.
policy in Viet Nam were widely

and prominently circulated in the
State Department cafeteria.
The petitions evoked little re
sponse until State Department
guards began enforcing a building
regulation against distribution of
outside literature. Then the petition
became a noisy issue of free speech.
Peace Corps and higher State
Department officials agreed with the
right of participants to circulate
any petition. Vice President Hubert
Humphrey responded, "If you think
things are not as they ought to be,
even in the State Department, tell
us."
