# PEACE CORPS
## Regrouping Point Here 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
The Peace Corps is branching out,
not overseas, but close to home.
Stanford has become a regrouping
point for returning volunteers, a
hardy lot with a social conscience and
ideas for change.
"We have a certain obligation to
share what we have with the people
who don't have anything. It's a two
way road. We can contribute to the
growth and progress of these coun
tries and also cap leani. something
from them that can make the U. S. a
better place."
Itch To Keep Acting
These are the words of Dave Gould,
a graduate student in Civil Engineer
ing, who completed his assignment
with tho Peace Corps in Peru in July.
1964. He is one of about 25 returned
volunteers now studying at Stanford;
most of them, like Dave, are graduate
students.
The return to campus of a steadily
increasing number of Peace Corps vol
unteers, is an almost brand 'new phe
nomenon the original "generation"
is only now returning from its two
years of service.
Their presence promises to have
some influence on t lie University, just
as the returning civil rights workers
had their influence, because, as one
volunteer puts it,"I have an itch to do
something."
Tremendous Responsibility
Emily Vargas-Baron, who served as
a Peace Corps coordinator in Colom

bia and who is a graduate student in
anthropology, cites? the 1 "tremendous
amount of responsibility" of peace
corpsmen in explaining the itch.
"You are on your own without any
one telling you what to do. When you
return to the United States, you no
longer have this responsibility. The
peace corpsmen would like to play a
more decisive role and they need an
outlet for their talents . . ."
Miss Vargas-Baron believes this oui
let will take the form of contribution
to "curriculum development" and to
exchange of ideas on the campus.
There is a large group, including past
volunteers and others with an inter
national concern, who are interested
in contributing something to the cam
pus, she says.
New Insights
Several of the volunteers denied in
interviews with the Daily that "re
entry", the return to the United States
culture, had posed any special prob
lems, because they had returned to
the university, a more "receptive"
community.
Yet they agree their perception of
the Unitrd States has become more
acute.
"It is very easy to become critical
because there are a lot of things you
see that you didn't before, things that
you don't like," explains Nancy Ray
mond, a graduate student in speech
pathology and audiology, who worked
on a social welfare project in Senegal.
Sober Minded Missionaries
Nancy, along with a substantial

number of hei fellow volunteers, ex
pects to work in international rela
tions as a career. For many this is a
direct result of their peace Corps ex
perience.
"The Peace Corps has changed my
outlook as to what 1 want to do. Work
ing in the field of international rela
tions had never occurred to me before
and this is now what I want to do
after I get out of college," says Dave
Gould.
Despite this sense of mission, the
volunteers have a sober-minded and
pragmatic attitude. As Miss Raymond
puts it,"I like to have ideals, but I
don't like to have unrealistic ideals."
Problems and Changes
For them the Peace Corps is serious
business which shows in the concern
with which they discuss its problems.
"The Peace Corps alone is not going
to change a country," explains Phil
Michael, a senior in political science
who taught math in the Somali Repub
lic. "I have become a lot more realis
tic after my two years about what the
Peace Corps can do."
The volunteers indicated two major
ways in which the Peace Corps has
changed or is changing:
First there is improved training for
the volunteers as the organization be
comes more organized and "sophisti
cated" and profits from its experience.
Secondly, there is increasing empha
sis on the training of the natives in
the country rather than merely pro
viding services, in order to help the
people help themselves.
