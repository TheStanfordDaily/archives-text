# DEMONSTRATIONS
## Freedom Of Expression--In Theory 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Stanford students may scorn tho University's
liquor laws, rankle under women's social regula
tions, and detest the Viet Nam war, but at least
they're free to say so.
They are also free to picket the president's
office over these and other grievances. Or stage
;i protest march down Palm Drive or give speeches
in White Memorial Plaza (with University-supplied
voice amplifiers). Or start a fund-raising drive on
campus to pay for more picket signs.
These are among the privileges fought for and
only partially won at Berkeley in December, but
which have evolved with little commotion at Stan
ford. However, Stanford's liberal regulations on
student demonstrations and political activity are,
in practice, much stricter.
No Sit-ins
Stanford requires that campus demonstrations
be "conducted in an orderly manner" and not inter
fere with classes, traffic or scheduled ceremonies.
They must not take place within University build
ing unless authorized and not invade private resi
dential areas of the campus."
In other words, no sit-ins.
A key reservation in Stanford's policy is that
the "private rights of all individuals" cannot be
infringed upon by demonstrators.
Students were forbidden to picket President.
Wallace Sterling's home in IJXS2 as a protest
against the installation of fallout shelters in dorm
itories. Such a protest was deemed unfair to the
President's family.
Graduating I'ieket
A graduating senior a few years back an
nounced she was going to picket her own gradua
tion. University officials took her aside and told
her what she would and would not be allowed to
do. When the girl defiantly tried to display her
picket sign in Frost Amphitheater during the
ceremonies, police blocked her path. "We had to
protect the rights of the students who were grad
uating," and administrator later explained.

Just last May two aggresive Stanford pacifists
angrily withdrew from the University. The two
sophomores, John Timothy and Janith Sehafcr,
were protesting the refusal of the University to
allow Peace Caucus members to show a placard
on the grandstands at the annual ROTC Presiden
tial review. The sign read, "Wars Will Cease When
Men Refuse Military Service." A United Nations
flag unfurled by the students in the grandstands
was also removed.
Invasion of Rights
United Nation flags and pacifist sentiments
were judged invasions of the rights of the ROTC
members, and thus banned. All was not lost for the
Peace Caucus, however, as six members, wearing
blue arm bands for identification, were allowed
to stand silently and disapprovingly in the grand
stands.
In expectation of the ROTC incident, Univers
ity officials had earlier issued a formal "Policy nn
Campus Demonstrations." It states that "the
rights of free speech and peaceable assembly are
fundamental to the democratic process." but adds
that the University must "maintain on the campus
an atmosphere conducive to academic work." and
"preserve the dignity and seriousness of University
ceremonies."
The rules this policy statement listed all meant
one thing: Students can protest to their heart's
content as long as nobody has to listen if they
don't want to.
Interpretations
But the University draws the line on student
activism in more subtle ways. According to a
statement of the trustees in 19(>3, "voluntary stu
dent organizations" are allowed to use University
facilities. But to be classified as a voluntary stu
dent organization, a group must be limited to
students and faculty only.
It must also have "purposes and procedures . . .
not inconsistent with the goals and standards of
the University." And who interprets this nebulous
oh rase? Whv. the President, of course.

This concern with ''defending the rights" of
all students by restricting activism explains why
LASSU is forbidden to take off-campus political
stands. By the same token, The Daily could be
denied editorial freedom since it enjoys a journal
istic monopoly of sorts at Stanford. But since
The Daily is a 'Voluntary" organization, tho trus
tees have long permitted it freedom to take con
troversial stands.
Religious Groups
One anachronism in the University policy in
volves religious groups on campus. Not until 19(>3
were they permitted use of University facilities.
Even then such organizations were forbidden to
conduct sectarian worship services on campus.
Stanford policy appears in a brighter light
when compared to that at Berkeley, the scene of
the famous "free speech" protests in December.
Under the revised student regulations of July,
Berkeley students can protest, picket and organize
as much as their Stanford counterparts. They can
even organize on-campus religious services, still
forbidden at Stanford.
No Hawking
But at Berkeley bureaucratic complexity hin
ders political organizations. Fund-raising for ofl'-
campus activities is forbidden. The rules prohibit
"hawking or shouting" at the tables manned by
students at the North Gate.
In general., a sharply different attitude towards
student activists is evident at imprcsonal. state
run California and at Stanford. Little things, like
use of the university name, are revealing.
At Berkeley, only the impotent student gov
ernment may use the words "University of Cali
fornia" in its name. At Stanford, anybody can, as
long as they don't pretend to represent the entire
University. For instance, students can organize a
"Stanford Viel Nam Day Committee' and use Uni
versity meeting rooms to plan anything from
speeches to civil disobedience.
But they'd just better not trv to picket Presi
dent Sterling's homo.
