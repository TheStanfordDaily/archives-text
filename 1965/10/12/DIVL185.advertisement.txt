BORN TWICE
Every one of us has been born at least once. Some people, however, have been born
twice. The twice-born among us are called "Christians." The second birth, called in the
Bible the new birth, is a spiritual awakening and auickening. The new birth is God's
response to the personal commitment of any individual to the Lord Jesus Christ. While all
of us are born physically, few are born spiritually because of self-centcred tendency
inate in each of us. By nature we seek our own way of life and only occasionally does an
individual reach the point of asking God for help. Spiritual birth occurs only when an
individual surrenders his heart and life to Jesus Christ as Lord and Master.
Following the ten commandments and living an approximately moral life has never
gotten a single soul into heaven (Galatians 3:10-13). Neither is it possible to earn God s
favor by meritorious works (Ephesians 2:8, 9); God alone is capable of constructive action
and only as He lives through men are they able to please Him.
Nicodemus (John 3:1) was a well-educated, intellectual, religious leader who sought
out Jesus in order to discover how It was that men were admitted to the kingdom c' heaven.
The answer which Jesus gave nearly two thousand years ago is the answer v/hich still
tolds true today: "you must be born again."
"One night Nicodemus, a leading Jew and a Pharisee came to see Jesus.
"Master," he began, "we realize that you are a teacher who has come from God.
Obviously no one could show the signs tl\at you show unless God wer * with him.
"Believe me," returned Jesus, "a man cannot see the kingdom ut Co I without being
born again.'' ....
"And how can a man who is getting old possibly be born?' replied Nicodemus, How
ran he go back into his mother's womb and be born a second time?
"1 assure you," said Jesus, "that unless a man is born from water and from spirit
he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Flesh gives birth to flesh and ■ irit gives birth to
spirit: you must not be surprised that I told you that all of you rr.u'.t be born again. The
wind blows where If likes, you ran hear the sound of it but you l ove no idea where it
comes from and where it goes. Nor can you tell how a man is born by the wind pf the
Spirit."
"How on earth can things like this happen?" replied Nicodemus.
"So you are a teacher of Isroel," said Jesus, "and you do not recognize such things?
I assure you that we are talking about something we really know and we are witnessing
to something we have actually observed, yet men like you will not accept our evidence. Vet
if I have spoken to you about things which will happen on this earth and you will not
believe me, what chance is there that you will believe me if I tell you about what hap
pens in heaven?" (John 3:1 -17 Ph)
The new birth is real, something which must be experienced for yourself. Join the
twice-born by meeting our Lord Jesus Christ today. In our pragmatic age the only con
vincing proof Is to see for yourself that He is indeed the everlasting God. Find out for
yourself. Don't take another's word for it.

response to the personal commitment of any individual to the Lord Jesus Christ. While all
of us are born physically, few are born spiritually because of self-centcred tendency
inate in each of us. By nature we seek our own way of life and only occasionally does an
individual reach the point of asking God for help. Spiritual birth occurs only when an
individual surrenders his heart and life to Jesus Christ as Lord and Master.
Following the ten commandments and living an approximately moral life has never
gotten a single soul into heaven (Galatians 3:10-13). Neither is it possible to earn God s
favor by meritorious works (Ephesians 2:8, 9); God alone is capable of constructive action
and only as He lives through men are they able to please Him.
Nicodemus (John 3:1) was a well-educated, intellectual, religious leader who sought
out Jesus in order to discover how It was that men were admitted to the kingdom c' heaven.
The answer which Jesus gave nearly two thousand years ago is the answer v/hich still
tolds true today: "you must be born again."
"One night Nicodemus, a leading Jew and a Pharisee came to see Jesus.
"Master," he began, "we realize that you are a teacher who has come from God.
Obviously no one could show the signs tl\at you show unless God wer * with him.
"Believe me," returned Jesus, "a man cannot see the kingdom ut Co I without being
born again.'' ....
"And how can a man who is getting old possibly be born?' replied Nicodemus, How
ran he go back into his mother's womb and be born a second time?
"1 assure you," said Jesus, "that unless a man is born from water and from spirit
he cannot enter the kingdom of God. Flesh gives birth to flesh and ■ irit gives birth to
spirit: you must not be surprised that I told you that all of you rr.u'.t be born again. The
wind blows where If likes, you ran hear the sound of it but you l ove no idea where it
comes from and where it goes. Nor can you tell how a man is born by the wind pf the
Spirit."
"How on earth can things like this happen?" replied Nicodemus.
"So you are a teacher of Isroel," said Jesus, "and you do not recognize such things?
I assure you that we are talking about something we really know and we are witnessing
to something we have actually observed, yet men like you will not accept our evidence. Vet
if I have spoken to you about things which will happen on this earth and you will not
believe me, what chance is there that you will believe me if I tell you about what hap
pens in heaven?" (John 3:1 -17 Ph)
The new birth is real, something which must be experienced for yourself. Join the
twice-born by meeting our Lord Jesus Christ today. In our pragmatic age the only con
vincing proof Is to see for yourself that He is indeed the everlasting God. Find out for
yourself. Don't take another's word for it.

BORN TWICE
Every one of us has been born at least once. Some people, however, have been born
twice. The twice-born among us are called "Christians." The second birth, called in the
Bible the new birth, is a spiritual awakening and auickening. The new birth is God's
