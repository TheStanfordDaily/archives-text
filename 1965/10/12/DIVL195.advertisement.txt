A Honda needs a mere 3'x ff 91 space to be per*
fectly content. And that puts HB an automobile oo
a spot,about a mile away from its destination.
There are other sides to Honda, too. Hondas are fiend
ishly frugal. A gallon of gas will carry you up to 200 mpg,
depending on which of the 15 Honda models you're
driving. And insurance bills shrink to practically nothing.
As for upkeep, a Honda needs little.
The shining example above is the remarkable Honda
50. It sells for about $215*. And there are 14 more models
to choose from. Look them over.
