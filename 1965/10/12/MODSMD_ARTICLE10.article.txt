Symposium To Begin Sunday

' A Time for Discussion, Din
ner and Dialogue" is the theme
for a new program this year
sponsored by AWS, and faculty
and staff wives.
The symposium includes a lec
ture on Sunday, October 17 at
5 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditor
ium, immediately followed by
group dinners in faculty and
staff homes. Discussion topics
wil include points brought up
by ihe symposium and other
matters of mutual interest.
The program was instigated
by faculty and staff wives who
are interested in meeting coeds
on an individual basis. Groups
will meet for several dinner-dis
cussions during Ihe fall and

perhaps winter quarter. This
continuity is one of the most
important aspects of the sym
posium in overcoming the rush
ed impersonality of having a
faculty guest one night for din
ner.
The program is designed to in
clude over 500 Stanford women
and 50 faculty and staff wives.
Because of the large number of
participants, it is impossible for
students to choose their faculty
staff hostess. However, each
hostess will personally contact
the ten girls in her group.

Peace Corps

Peace Corps Week activities
on campus continue today with
a question-and-answer period
and a film. A 1 Carp, head of
Peace Corps selection, will be in
the small lounge of Tresidder at
4:15 to answer questions on the
selection process. "A Choice I
Made," the story of Corps volun
teers in India as told in their
own words, will be given its pre
miere showing on the Stanford
campus at 7:30 in Rooms 274-5
of the Union.
