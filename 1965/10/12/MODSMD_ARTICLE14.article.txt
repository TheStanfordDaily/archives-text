## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford water polo prospects
keep looking better and better.
The Tribe pushed their seasons
record to 5-0 with a 10-7 victory
over Cal last Friday at Berke
ley. » ' 1* •
Mark Parmley opened the
scoring in the game midway
through the first quarter. Mike
Eshelman, fouled while in scor
ing position inside the 4 yard
line, made good his penalty shot
to give Stanford a 2-0 edge.
Cal matched the Indians goal
for goal in the second period.
Eshelman added his second and
third scores for the game and
Gary Sheerer contributed one
to the Red cause.
Leading 5-3 going into the
third quarter, Pete Ready over
powered the Cal goalie with a

backhand shot to give Stanford |
a 6-3 margin. Cal's Barry Woit
zenberg then scored two limes,
shaving the Indian lead to a
meager one goal. Bill Derrig
brought the Cards out of the
bind with a late quarter score.
Twice in the final period, j
Gary Scheerer chucked a duck |
soup pass to Mark Parmley who !
converted for a tip-in goal. Pete
Ready tallied again, putting the ;
Cards out in front to stay, 10-7. '
Stanford exercised precision I
ball control, waiting for tho!
sure shots, guarding tight, and !
fouling little lless than half of I
the Bear's foul total).
The Indans put their scalps
on the line this weekend with
crucial games with UCLA and
USC. The team that comes out
of the weekend fray showing
the most hair will probably earn i
the nation's top ranking—tem-1
porarily at least.
