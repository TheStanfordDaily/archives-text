## Strike Leader Extends Thanks 
### 
Editor, The Daily
1 want to take this opportun
ity to write a special letter of
thanks to all the Friends of
SNCC for the great help they
have given to our struggle here.
Tli is weekend we received
enough food to open a small
store for pickets and their fam
ilies; we received enough money
to fill our pickets' gas tanks for
the week ahead. This may sound
like a small thing but it is the
very essence of our strike activ
ity.
Two weeks ago, the second
week of the strike, things started
off very badly and we were al
most afraid the cause was lost.
Rut about Wednesday, many
new people began coming to us,
more every day. Friday a whole
camp tit DiGiorgio walked out in
support of tht- strike and on the
same day some members of a
crew recruited in Las Crucas,
New Mexico joined us. To<iay,
more than lot) people on 6 ranch
es left work and joined the
strike. We begin to feel that the
strike is growing, and will grow,
rather than subside. We begin to
believe that this is the time for
a real movement among farm
workers to begin - - and people
are beginning to talk about the
Movement instead of a strike.
Justice for farm workers is-,
of course, long overdue. And the
farm labor struggle is an impor
tant part of the civil rights move
ment, as It faces the same eco
nomic problems of minority
groups. Many of the workers in
our area earn about $2,000 a
year and support, a family of 10
on this. Most of our workers are
unemployed much of the time
from November until April.
Since the strike began, about
twenty workers have picketed
daily and worked in the neigh*

borhoods every night; they have
committed themselves fully to
La Causa and they are an inspi
ration to all uf us. Today, eight
different women, came to the of
fice to offer help with meals for
pickets and with storekeeping
duties. We have no choice except
to continue, although we work
against impossible odds. When I
feel pessimistic, however, I think
of Mississippi—a ten year strug
gle. I take a deep breath and
work a little harder.
What I want to do is to ask
Stanford students to help in the
California Movement. We will
have a long way to go and I need
your help. Our store will be out
of food by the weekend. We will
need to put more gas in the
tanks. For how long? The grape
harvest, our strike target, con
tinues for another month. Then
the pruning activity begins in
the same fields. We hope to con
tinue. I hope sincerely that you
will continue with us, perhaps
through the fall and into the
winter. We will need food and
money every weekend.
Today one of our pickets came
in with a grocery list from his
wife and took it over to our
storekeeper. The list gives the
best idea about foods to send:
soap, oil, canned meat, bread,
flour, coffee, sugar, evaporated
milk, lard, pinto beans, cereal,
mayonnaise, masa harina. (The
list also said cookies.) Money
can be sent to Box 894, Delano.
You all are very important to
the future of our movement. Let
me thank you very much now
for all that you have already
done, and hope that you will be
strong with us in the future.

Editor, The Daily:
We wish to express our con
cern about the farm labor strike
in the grape fields near Delano,
California. We support the Agri
cultural Workers' Organizing
Committee (AWOC) and the
Farm Workers' Association in
their efforts to be recognized by
the growers and to gain a wage
increase to $1.40 an hour and 25
cents a box. The growers' re
fusal to recognize these unions
seems unreasonable, particular
ity since AWOC is affiliated
with the AFL-CIO.
Having seen the strike area,
we feel that their specific claims
are justified, and also that farm
laborers should be covered not
only by minimum wage, but also
by workman's compensation
and unemploymentjnsuranee as
are other members of the labor
force in our country.
We were also impressed dur
ing our visit by the orderliness
of the strike at Delano and by
the deep commitment to non
violence. We feel that this testi
fies to the strikers' sincerity and
respect ibility. We are distressed
that children are being used as
strikebreakers.
Here at Stanford we have
been supporting the strike by
collecting funds in front of the
Post Office and providing infor
mation for those interested. As
the largest agricultural strike
of the post-war period, it tests
the legitimacy of the farm lab
orer's right to attempt to im
prove his living and working
condition through union activ
ities.
We again wish to emphasize
our complete agreement with
ihe strikers' demands of union
recognition and wage increases.
We urge Stanford students to
do everything in their power to

aid these farm laborers in their
attempt to improve their lives.

• JNo Seniors In Color?
Editor, The Daily
1 have heard from more than
one reliable source that the sen
ior pictures in this year's Qojul
will not be in color. I believe the
senior pictures l>ave been in col
or for at least thq past seven
years. As I am a senior this
year, I am a little disturbed by
this fact.
The undergraduate classes
must absorb a certain amount
of the costs involved in having
the senior pictures in color. They
expect, of course, to have the
compliment (the only distinc
tion the senior class receives in
the book) returned to them as
seniors.
This year's senior class is be
ing in a way cheated by the de
cision of this year's Qu«d editor
(Miss Joellyn Kapp, a junior) to
shift the color from the senior
pages to other parts of the an
nual. The Quad has made no pub
lic announcement of this deci>
sion. The annual is important
especially to the senior class, and
to have this class distinguished
by color pictures is certainly
not unfair to the undergraduate
classes.
I apologize if my information
is incorrect, bill I have reason
to believe it reliable. I would ap
preciate a public announcement
of the Quad's intention in this
regard.

• More Museum Hours
Editor, The Daily
It does not seem reasonable
that a museum as beautiful as
Stanford's, with outstanding ex
hibits such as the current Thie
baud portraits, should be open
only from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
Not only are many visitors dis
appointed when they cannot see
the museum, but there are sev
eral thousand staff employees,
many who would like to go to
the museum on their lunch hour,
but cannot since the museum is
not open until 1 p.m.
It seems the time has come
when the museum should main
tain the same hours as the Stan
ford Ail Gallery from 10 a.m.

New Mexico joined us. To<iay,
more than lot) people on 6 ranch
es left work and joined the
strike. We begin to feel that the
strike is growing, and will grow,
rather than subside. We begin to
believe that this is the time for
a real movement among farm
workers to begin - - and people
are beginning to talk about the
Movement instead of a strike.
Justice for farm workers is-,
of course, long overdue. And the
farm labor struggle is an impor
tant part of the civil rights move
ment, as It faces the same eco
nomic problems of minority
groups. Many of the workers in
our area earn about $2,000 a
year and support, a family of 10
on this. Most of our workers are
unemployed much of the time
from November until April.
Since the strike began, about
twenty workers have picketed
daily and worked in the neigh*

borhoods every night; they have
committed themselves fully to
La Causa and they are an inspi
ration to all uf us. Today, eight
different women, came to the of
fice to offer help with meals for
pickets and with storekeeping
duties. We have no choice except
to continue, although we work
against impossible odds. When I
feel pessimistic, however, I think
of Mississippi—a ten year strug
gle. I take a deep breath and
work a little harder.
What I want to do is to ask
Stanford students to help in the
California Movement. We will
have a long way to go and I need
your help. Our store will be out
of food by the weekend. We will
need to put more gas in the
tanks. For how long? The grape
harvest, our strike target, con
tinues for another month. Then
the pruning activity begins in
the same fields. We hope to con
tinue. I hope sincerely that you
will continue with us, perhaps
through the fall and into the
winter. We will need food and
money every weekend.
Today one of our pickets came
in with a grocery list from his
wife and took it over to our
storekeeper. The list gives the
best idea about foods to send:
soap, oil, canned meat, bread,
flour, coffee, sugar, evaporated
milk, lard, pinto beans, cereal,
mayonnaise, masa harina. (The
list also said cookies.) Money
can be sent to Box 894, Delano.
You all are very important to
the future of our movement. Let
me thank you very much now
for all that you have already
done, and hope that you will be
strong with us in the future.

Editor, The Daily:
We wish to express our con
cern about the farm labor strike
in the grape fields near Delano,
California. We support the Agri
cultural Workers' Organizing
Committee (AWOC) and the
Farm Workers' Association in
their efforts to be recognized by
the growers and to gain a wage
increase to $1.40 an hour and 25
cents a box. The growers' re
fusal to recognize these unions
seems unreasonable, particular
ity since AWOC is affiliated
with the AFL-CIO.
Having seen the strike area,
we feel that their specific claims
are justified, and also that farm
laborers should be covered not
only by minimum wage, but also
by workman's compensation
and unemploymentjnsuranee as
are other members of the labor
force in our country.
We were also impressed dur
ing our visit by the orderliness
of the strike at Delano and by
the deep commitment to non
violence. We feel that this testi
fies to the strikers' sincerity and
respect ibility. We are distressed
that children are being used as
strikebreakers.
Here at Stanford we have
been supporting the strike by
collecting funds in front of the
Post Office and providing infor
mation for those interested. As
the largest agricultural strike
of the post-war period, it tests
the legitimacy of the farm lab
orer's right to attempt to im
prove his living and working
condition through union activ
ities.
We again wish to emphasize
our complete agreement with
ihe strikers' demands of union
recognition and wage increases.
We urge Stanford students to
do everything in their power to

aid these farm laborers in their
attempt to improve their lives.

• JNo Seniors In Color?
Editor, The Daily
1 have heard from more than
one reliable source that the sen

will not be in color. I believe the
senior pictures l>ave been in col
or for at least thq past seven
years. As I am a senior this
year, I am a little disturbed by
this fact.
The undergraduate classes
must absorb a certain amount
of the costs involved in having
the senior pictures in color. They
expect, of course, to have the
compliment (the only distinc
tion the senior class receives in
the book) returned to them as
seniors.
This year's senior class is be
ing in a way cheated by the de
cision of this year's Qu«d editor
(Miss Joellyn Kapp, a junior) to
shift the color from the senior
pages to other parts of the an
nual. The Quad has made no pub
lic announcement of this deci>
sion. The annual is important
especially to the senior class, and
to have this class distinguished
by color pictures is certainly
not unfair to the undergraduate
classes.
I apologize if my information
is incorrect, bill I have reason
to believe it reliable. I would ap
preciate a public announcement
of the Quad's intention in this

daily and worked in the neigh*

borhoods every night; they have
committed themselves fully to
La Causa and they are an inspi
ration to all uf us. Today, eight
different women, came to the of
fice to offer help with meals for
pickets and with storekeeping
duties. We have no choice except
to continue, although we work
against impossible odds. When I
feel pessimistic, however, I think
of Mississippi—a ten year strug
gle. I take a deep breath and
work a little harder.
What I want to do is to ask
Stanford students to help in the
California Movement. We will
have a long way to go and I need
your help. Our store will be out
of food by the weekend. We will
need to put more gas in the
tanks. For how long? The grape
harvest, our strike target, con
tinues for another month. Then
the pruning activity begins in
the same fields. We hope to con
tinue. I hope sincerely that you
will continue with us, perhaps
through the fall and into the
winter. We will need food and
money every weekend.
Today one of our pickets came
in with a grocery list from his
wife and took it over to our
storekeeper. The list gives the
best idea about foods to send:
soap, oil, canned meat, bread,
flour, coffee, sugar, evaporated
milk, lard, pinto beans, cereal,
mayonnaise, masa harina. (The
list also said cookies.) Money
can be sent to Box 894, Delano.
You all are very important to
the future of our movement. Let
me thank you very much now
for all that you have already
done, and hope that you will be
strong with us in the future.

Editor, The Daily:
We wish to express our con
cern about the farm labor strike
in the grape fields near Delano,
California. We support the Agri
cultural Workers' Organizing
Committee (AWOC) and the
Farm Workers' Association in
their efforts to be recognized by
the growers and to gain a wage
increase to $1.40 an hour and 25
cents a box. The growers' re
fusal to recognize these unions
seems unreasonable, particular
ity since AWOC is affiliated
with the AFL-CIO.
Having seen the strike area,
we feel that their specific claims
are justified, and also that farm
laborers should be covered not
only by minimum wage, but also
by workman's compensation
and unemploymentjnsuranee as
are other members of the labor
force in our country.
We were also impressed dur
ing our visit by the orderliness
of the strike at Delano and by
the deep commitment to non
violence. We feel that this testi
fies to the strikers' sincerity and
respect ibility. We are distressed
that children are being used as
strikebreakers.
Here at Stanford we have
been supporting the strike by
collecting funds in front of the
Post Office and providing infor
mation for those interested. As
the largest agricultural strike
of the post-war period, it tests
the legitimacy of the farm lab
orer's right to attempt to im
prove his living and working
condition through union activ
ities.
We again wish to emphasize
our complete agreement with
ihe strikers' demands of union
recognition and wage increases.
We urge Stanford students to
do everything in their power to

aid these farm laborers in their
attempt to improve their lives.

• JNo Seniors In Color?
Editor, The Daily
1 have heard from more than
one reliable source that the sen
ior pictures in this year's Qojul
will not be in color. I believe the
senior pictures l>ave been in col
or for at least thq past seven
years. As I am a senior this
year, I am a little disturbed by
this fact.
The undergraduate classes
must absorb a certain amount
of the costs involved in having
the senior pictures in color. They
expect, of course, to have the
compliment (the only distinc
tion the senior class receives in
the book) returned to them as
seniors.
This year's senior class is be
ing in a way cheated by the de
cision of this year's Qu«d editor
(Miss Joellyn Kapp, a junior) to
shift the color from the senior
pages to other parts of the an
nual. The Quad has made no pub
lic announcement of this deci>
sion. The annual is important
especially to the senior class, and
to have this class distinguished
by color pictures is certainly
not unfair to the undergraduate
classes.
I apologize if my information
is incorrect, bill I have reason
to believe it reliable. I would ap
preciate a public announcement
of the Quad's intention in this

Editor, The Daily

thanks to all the Friends of

Tli is weekend we received
enough food to open a small
store for pickets and their fam
ilies; we received enough money
to fill our pickets' gas tanks for
the week ahead. This may sound
like a small thing but it is the
very essence of our strike activ
ity.
Two weeks ago, the second
week of the strike, things started
off very badly and we were al
most afraid the cause was lost.
Rut about Wednesday, many
new people began coming to us,
more every day. Friday a whole
camp tit DiGiorgio walked out in
support of tht- strike and on the
same day some members of a
crew recruited in Las Crucas,
New Mexico joined us. To<iay,
more than lot) people on 6 ranch
es left work and joined the
strike. We begin to feel that the
strike is growing, and will grow,
rather than subside. We begin to
believe that this is the time for
a real movement among farm
workers to begin - - and people
are beginning to talk about the
Movement instead of a strike.
Justice for farm workers is-,
of course, long overdue. And the
farm labor struggle is an impor
tant part of the civil rights move
ment, as It faces the same eco

groups. Many of the workers in
our area earn about $2,000 a

the pruning activity begins in
the same fields. We hope to con
tinue. I hope sincerely that you
will continue with us, perhaps
through the fall and into the
winter. We will need food and
money every weekend.
Today one of our pickets came
in with a grocery list from his
wife and took it over to our
storekeeper. The list gives the
best idea about foods to send:
soap, oil, canned meat, bread,
flour, coffee, sugar, evaporated
milk, lard, pinto beans, cereal,
mayonnaise, masa harina. (The
list also said cookies.) Money
can be sent to Box 894, Delano.
You all are very important to
the future of our movement. Let
me thank you very much now
for all that you have already
done, and hope that you will be
strong with us in the future.

Editor, The Daily:
We wish to express our con
cern about the farm labor strike
in the grape fields near Delano,
California. We support the Agri
cultural Workers' Organizing
Committee (AWOC) and the
Farm Workers' Association in
their efforts to be recognized by
the growers and to gain a wage
increase to $1.40 an hour and 25
cents a box. The growers' re
fusal to recognize these unions
seems unreasonable, particular
ity since AWOC is affiliated
with the AFL-CIO.
Having seen the strike area,
we feel that their specific claims
are justified, and also that farm
laborers should be covered not
only by minimum wage, but also
by workman's compensation
and unemploymentjnsuranee as
are other members of the labor
force in our country.
We were also impressed dur
ing our visit by the orderliness
of the strike at Delano and by
the deep commitment to non
violence. We feel that this testi
fies to the strikers' sincerity and
respect ibility. We are distressed
that children are being used as
strikebreakers.
Here at Stanford we have
been supporting the strike by
collecting funds in front of the
Post Office and providing infor
mation for those interested. As
the largest agricultural strike
of the post-war period, it tests
the legitimacy of the farm lab
orer's right to attempt to im
prove his living and working
condition through union activ
ities.
We again wish to emphasize
our complete agreement with
ihe strikers' demands of union
recognition and wage increases.
We urge Stanford students to
do everything in their power to

aid these farm laborers in their
attempt to improve their lives.

• JNo Seniors In Color?
Editor, The Daily
1 have heard from more than
one reliable source that the sen
ior pictures in this year's Qojul
will not be in color. I believe the
senior pictures l>ave been in col
or for at least thq past seven
years. As I am a senior this
year, I am a little disturbed by
this fact.
The undergraduate classes
must absorb a certain amount
of the costs involved in having
the senior pictures in color. They
expect, of course, to have the
compliment (the only distinc
tion the senior class receives in
the book) returned to them as
seniors.
This year's senior class is be
ing in a way cheated by the de
cision of this year's Qu«d editor
(Miss Joellyn Kapp, a junior) to
shift the color from the senior
pages to other parts of the an
nual. The Quad has made no pub
lic announcement of this deci>
sion. The annual is important
especially to the senior class, and
to have this class distinguished
by color pictures is certainly
not unfair to the undergraduate
classes.
I apologize if my information
is incorrect, bill I have reason
to believe it reliable. I would ap
preciate a public announcement
of the Quad's intention in this
regard.

It does not seem reasonable

PELL FENDER
Editor, The Daily
1 want to take this opportun
ity to write a special letter of
thanks to all the Friends of
SNCC for the great help they
have given to our struggle here.
Tli is weekend we received
enough food to open a small
store for pickets and their fam
ilies; we received enough money
to fill our pickets' gas tanks for
the week ahead. This may sound
like a small thing but it is the
very essence of our strike activ
ity.
Two weeks ago, the second
week of the strike, things started
off very badly and we were al
most afraid the cause was lost.
Rut about Wednesday, many
new people began coming to us,
more every day. Friday a whole
camp tit DiGiorgio walked out in
support of tht- strike and on the
same day some members of a
crew recruited in Las Crucas,
New Mexico joined us. To<iay,
more than lot) people on 6 ranch
es left work and joined the
strike. We begin to feel that the
strike is growing, and will grow,
rather than subside. We begin to
believe that this is the time for
a real movement among farm
workers to begin - - and people
are beginning to talk about the
Movement instead of a strike.
Justice for farm workers is-,
of course, long overdue. And the
farm labor struggle is an impor
tant part of the civil rights move
ment, as It faces the same eco
nomic problems of minority
groups. Many of the workers in
our area earn about $2,000 a
year and support, a family of 10
on this. Most of our workers are
unemployed much of the time
from November until April.
Since the strike began, about
twenty workers have picketed
daily and worked in the neigh*

borhoods every night; they have
committed themselves fully to
La Causa and they are an inspi
ration to all uf us. Today, eight
different women, came to the of
fice to offer help with meals for
pickets and with storekeeping
duties. We have no choice except
to continue, although we work
against impossible odds. When I
feel pessimistic, however, I think
of Mississippi—a ten year strug
gle. I take a deep breath and
work a little harder.
What I want to do is to ask
Stanford students to help in the
California Movement. We will
have a long way to go and I need
your help. Our store will be out
of food by the weekend. We will
need to put more gas in the
tanks. For how long? The grape
harvest, our strike target, con
tinues for another month. Then
the pruning activity begins in
