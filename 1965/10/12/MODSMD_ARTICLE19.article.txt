# Understanding Paly High Girls
## 
### TOM BOWEN Assistant Feature Editor 
For those freshmen who entered the Farm with the total in
dependence of no girl back home, or for those who kissed her off
for one reason or another as the year progressed, the peninsula
offers a veritable menagerie of womenâ€”all sizes, shapes and types.
Perhaps the most infamous of these females is the much talked
about Paly High Girl, or in reality girls from the almost number
less high schools on the peninsula. Bj? the end of Fall quarter she
is both a sex symbol and the butt of literally hundreds of jokes,
but most important the phenomenon of which she is a part is rarely
understood.
Not The .Most
To start with she is rarely if ever the cream of the high school
crop. This is evidenced by her rather exotic maimer of personal
appearance as well as by the fact that if she were the belle of her
area, she would not have to cruise the streets, parking lots and
house lounges of Stanford University in search of male compan-

ionship.
Secondly, she is not only at
least a somewhat lonely in
dividual but she is also
outgoing and perhaps even ex
perienced to voluntarily and
knowingly venture into a siua
tion where "pick-up" is the or-'
der of the hour.
Insecurity As W ell
Further, there is no small
element of insecurity in Ihcse
youthful women of the world.
They not only arrive in groups
of at least two or three, but
there is a large majority of
them who, contrary to popular
folklore, refuse to engage in any j
activity more intimate than do- ,
ing the jerk.
However, there is the other!
high school girl, the one who is j
so well known in Stanford tra
ditions. She is completely unin
hibited, and thinks nothing of
engaging in sexual intercourse ;
with a different freshman every
week-end. By the end of the year
she is practically one of the
house since she generally con
centrates her charms on one, or i
at the most two, of the Wilbur
houses.
Here lies the tragedy of the
entire high school girl phenom
enon. Too many people are led
to believe that all of the women
who are not Stanford Dollies,
are nymphomaniac high school
girls to the last soul. Unfortun
ately freshmen treat them all as
such with rather questionable
reactions.
'But Nothing More'
If they do so to one of the|
vast ma jority of high school <
dollies who arc there for a little
fun but nothing more, they are
either rudely and sometimes
publicly shut down, or success
ful enough that both parties in
volved loose at least a little of
their self-respect.
The worst facet of the whole
situation is that occasionally
into one of the Paly High-infest
ed Wilbur parties will drift a
group of truly innocent, clean
cut girls who are there out of
curiosity or because it is the
thing to do or whatever. But
since they are little different in
appearance from the run of the
mill PHG, they get the same
variety of hustle, and occasion
ally end up in the same face
losing situation as their less
reputable counterparts.
Here the problem moves be
yond mere seduction. Now a
perfectly innocent individual has
had her personality perhaps per- '
manently warped by a some- I
wh a t inconsiderate "college 112
man." But Is it his fault? Or is
it hers? Or just who's is it?
The answer lies in the entire
phenomenon. A phenomenon
which was brought about and
is characterized by a mutual
lack of respect between a cheap
element of the high school pop
ulation and a group of first-year
male students placed in a state
of sexual starvation by a ridicu
lous ratio.
But for those who look be
yond the availability of the Wil
bur lot to other colleges and
even to Stanford there is some
hope.
