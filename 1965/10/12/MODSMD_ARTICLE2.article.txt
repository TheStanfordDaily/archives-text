# Jazz Authority Traces Development Of Mode

Jazz is the result of 300 years'
Wending in America of West African
rhythms, European harmonies, and
mixed melodies, Dr. Marshall Stearns
told — and showed — an enthusiastic
audit nee in the Tresidder lounges yes
terday, in the second lecture of the
Stanford Jazz Year.
Once again the series filled both

lounges as Dr. Stearns, Chaucerian
scholar and assistant Professor of
English at Hunter College (N.Y.I, au
thor of the definitive The Story of
Jazz, and founder of New York's In
stitute of Jazz Studies, illustrated his
talk on "Origins and Sources" with a
diverse collection of vintage records.

"Jazz began 300 years ago when the
first Africans came to America and
started to mingle their tribal rhythms
with the new culture," he explained.
Dr. Stearns proceeded to demonstrate
rhythm patterns of increasing com
plexity up to 9-4, which to an un
trained ear is a staccato beat with
only a hint of regular structure.
"African drummers," he continued,
"can play 9-4 with one hand while
playing something else with tlie other,
in a group in which two or three other
men are playing completely different
rhythms."
Dr. Stearns ascribed this ability to
produce complex patterns to a learned
"metronome sense" which, he said,
is vital to all jazzmen. "You pick it up
early, watching your mother wash the
floors, listening to the sound of an old
car's engine and just feeling the rhy
thm," he explained.
Melody Hoots
The roots of melody were traced to
Southern plantation "field hollers,"
identifiable chants of individual work
ers whoso West African counterparts
were said to be uttering similar cries.
Field hollers evolved Into gospel
singing. Dr. Stearns said; to illustrate
the development he played a recording
of Mahalia Jackson singing "Silent
Night," with the remnants of the field
cries appearing in the "feathers and
flowers" (in the words of a choir sing
er) that Miss Jackson added to the
traditional melody, invariably trans
porting audiences into religious ec
stasy.

rhythms, European harmonies, and
mixed melodies, Dr. Marshall Stearns
told — and showed — an enthusiastic
audit nee in the Tresidder lounges yes
terday, in the second lecture of the
Stanford Jazz Year.
Once again the series filled both

lounges as Dr. Stearns, Chaucerian
scholar and assistant Professor of
English at Hunter College (N.Y.I, au
thor of the definitive The Story of
Jazz, and founder of New York's In
stitute of Jazz Studies, illustrated his
talk on "Origins and Sources" with a
diverse collection of vintage records.
ttOO Years Old
"Jazz began 300 years ago when the
first Africans came to America and
started to mingle their tribal rhythms
with the new culture," he explained.
Dr. Stearns proceeded to demonstrate
rhythm patterns of increasing com
plexity up to 9-4, which to an un
trained ear is a staccato beat with
only a hint of regular structure.
"African drummers," he continued,
"can play 9-4 with one hand while
playing something else with tlie other,
in a group in which two or three other
men are playing completely different
rhythms."
Dr. Stearns ascribed this ability to
produce complex patterns to a learned
"metronome sense" which, he said,
is vital to all jazzmen. "You pick it up
early, watching your mother wash the
floors, listening to the sound of an old
car's engine and just feeling the rhy
thm," he explained.
Melody Hoots
The roots of melody were traced to
Southern plantation "field hollers,"
identifiable chants of individual work
ers whoso West African counterparts
were said to be uttering similar cries.
Field hollers evolved Into gospel
singing. Dr. Stearns said; to illustrate
the development he played a recording
of Mahalia Jackson singing "Silent
Night," with the remnants of the field
cries appearing in the "feathers and
flowers" (in the words of a choir sing
er) that Miss Jackson added to the
traditional melody, invariably trans
porting audiences into religious ec
stasy.
