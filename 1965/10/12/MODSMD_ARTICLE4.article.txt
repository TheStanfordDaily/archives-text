# Wiggins Lauds Peace Corps' Work
## 
### TINA PRESS 
The Deputy Director of the Peace
Corps yesterday appealed to Stanford
students for continued support of his
organization, calling its activities "na
tion building."
Warren W. Wiggins, ' speaking in
Cubberley Auditorium, said "Our
thinking is related to student think
ing. We see the same world as you
see. Our ideas are not mutually exclu
sive."
Students Involved
The student commitment was a
theme of Wiggins's speech, which
started a week of intensive recruiting
activity for the Peace Corps. "Stu
dents are responsible for the amazing
success of this organization, now a so
cial movement in colleges," he said.
Students recognize that the Peace
Corps is the "way to change things,"
he said. "It is a realistic opportunity
for them to express themselves in a
place that counts and with the oppor
tunity tb make the difference."
Stanford Leads
Stanford sends the highest number
per capita into the Peace Corps, with
251 either serving now or having
served. "I can't think of a bettor place
than Stanford to tell of the new and
exciting things which are happening
in tho Peace Corps," continued Wig
gins.
He cited several occasions when stu
dents demonstrated "organizational
effectiveness." Wiggins commented:
"Students are taking action in many
areas, and in a number of ways are
ahead of the faculty and the nation."
Students brought the situation in
the South to the attention of the na
tion, and also showed initiative in the
poverty problem in America, he said.
Wiggins also mentioned the revolution
in personal values, and the early de
mand for an end to nuclear testing.
'Wild Outfit'
"The Peace Corps is a wild outfit,
and the students have had a lot to do
with it," Wiggins said. Although the
Peace Corps is not recruiting "politi
cal activists," Wiggins indicated that
the Corps has no ideological guide

lines, and that students volunteer as
American citizens.
"Individual opinions don't count,"
he continued. "It is irrelevant whether
one disagrees with the United States'
foreign policy. Our purpose is not to
give answers."
Wiggins rejected the notion that the
Peace Corps is nothing but an "ap
plied altruism," calling it instead "na
tion building," in which students are
the critical element in the evolution

of the country." He affirmed that the
movement is dramatic enough to be
called a revolution.
Emphasizing that the Peace Corps
"concentrates on the kind of world we
should have," Wiggins called for vol
unteers who are concerned with doing
something positive. "It is not enough
just to react; we must guarantee
peace in the long haul."
Defines Peace
But "peace is not just the absence

of war," he said. "It is the understand
ing and mutual toleration that is the
prerequisite to an end to military situ,
ations. This will never come while we
only talk about it."
"We must keep in mind that in a
world where people are pushed down
by ignorance, disease, and the inabil
ity to read, the situation is not helped
just by stopping war, or by shipping
food. It takes more; it takes hope,"
Wiggins said.

Stanford Leads
Stanford sends the highest number
per capita into the Peace Corps, with
251 either serving now or having
served. "I can't think of a bettor place
than Stanford to tell of the new and
exciting things which are happening
in tho Peace Corps," continued Wig
gins.
He cited several occasions when stu
dents demonstrated "organizational
effectiveness." Wiggins commented:
"Students are taking action in many
areas, and in a number of ways are
ahead of the faculty and the nation."
Students brought the situation in
the South to the attention of the na
tion, and also showed initiative in the
poverty problem in America, he said.
Wiggins also mentioned the revolution
in personal values, and the early de
mand for an end to nuclear testing.
'Wild Outfit'
"The Peace Corps is a wild outfit,
and the students have had a lot to do
with it," Wiggins said. Although the
Peace Corps is not recruiting "politi
cal activists," Wiggins indicated that
the Corps has no ideological guide

lines, and that students volunteer as
American citizens.
"Individual opinions don't count,"
he continued. "It is irrelevant whether
one disagrees with the United States'
foreign policy. Our purpose is not to
give answers."
Wiggins rejected the notion that the
Peace Corps is nothing but an "ap
plied altruism," calling it instead "na
tion building," in which students are
the critical element in the evolution

of the country." He affirmed that the
movement is dramatic enough to be
called a revolution.
Emphasizing that the Peace Corps
"concentrates on the kind of world we
should have," Wiggins called for vol
unteers who are concerned with doing
something positive. "It is not enough
just to react; we must guarantee
peace in the long haul."
Defines Peace
But "peace is not just the absence

of war," he said. "It is the understand
ing and mutual toleration that is the
prerequisite to an end to military situ,
ations. This will never come while we
only talk about it."
"We must keep in mind that in a
world where people are pushed down
by ignorance, disease, and the inabil
ity to read, the situation is not helped
just by stopping war, or by shipping
food. It takes more; it takes hope,"
Wiggins said.
The Deputy Director of the Peace
Corps yesterday appealed to Stanford
students for continued support of his
organization, calling its activities "na
tion building."
Warren W. Wiggins, ' speaking in
Cubberley Auditorium, said "Our
thinking is related to student think
ing. We see the same world as you
see. Our ideas are not mutually exclu
sive."
Students Involved
The student commitment was a
theme of Wiggins's speech, which
started a week of intensive recruiting
activity for the Peace Corps. "Stu
dents are responsible for the amazing
success of this organization, now a so
cial movement in colleges," he said.
Students recognize that the Peace
Corps is the "way to change things,"
he said. "It is a realistic opportunity
for them to express themselves in a
place that counts and with the oppor
tunity tb make the difference."
