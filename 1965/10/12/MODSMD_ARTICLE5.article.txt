# Axe Saved By Police
## 
### 
At the crack of dawn Monday, while
thi- sun and Stanford students were
just rising, a daring invasion of the
Tresidder Memorial Union fortress
was made in an unsuccessful attempt
to abscond with the Axe, traditional
Big Game trophy.
The would-be burglar smashed a
door pane on the west side ground
floor entrance to Tresidder Memorial
Union about 6:30, according to Chief
Gordon Davis. A sledge hammer was
then used on the safety-glass wall
cabinet in which the Axe is kept.
Stanford police rushed to the rescue
of the Axe two minutes after the si
lent burglar alarm in the case sound
ed. The department reported that no
one was apprehended nor were any
suspects seen.
Stanford has maintained victories
over Cal for four straight years and
the Axe has remained safely tucked
away in TMU despite many attempts
to steal it.
Biff Barnard, Axe Committee chair
man, said that the most recent theft
attempt involved "a couple of drunks
at the beginning of the summer."
Will the Axe remain safe and secure
in Stanford hands through the I3i^ r
Game Nov. 20? Barnard placed the
Axe in the Stanford bank in Palo Alto
Monday morning. The symbol of heat
ed Stanford-Cal'competition will not
be brought out until the bonfire and
game, he announced.
