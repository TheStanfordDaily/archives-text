# The 						Woman's Touch
## New Dimensions In Dining 
### BERDA TUFTS 
The new Wilbur hasherette com
bines all the qualities of a den mother,
sex symbol and confidante.
She. is the Food Service's decisive
step toward improving relations be
tween Wilbur freshmen and I he Stan
ford woman. This fall one feminine
hasher graces each of the eight din
ing rooms in Wilbur Hall, in addition
to the previously all-male crew.
Now entering its third week, the
Wilbur Hasherette Program has gain
ed universal approval. The eight hash
erettes agree that their working con
ditions are very satisfying. They are
permitted free movement within a
virtually untapped preserve of Stan
ford manpower where they can either
cultivate dates to freshman parties
or exercise their maternal instincts
already spurned by upperclassmen.
Freshman AppH ii<'
Most hasherettes are extraordinar
ily sympathetic towards 1 he freshman
appetite, and will make any effort
to slip "her boys" extra milk, pie, or
potato gems behind the back of her
somewhat less compassionate head
hasher. A senior hasherette is partic
ularly known for her motherly emo
tions and has been known to stop
mid-flight between duties and anxious
ly question a Wilburite who has eaten
only half his meal. His customary re
sponse is to ask for another quart of
milk.
Freshmen applaud the innovation
and have willingly adjusted to the
presence of females in their dining
halls. At dinner time the Wilbur ver
nacular is temporarily replaced by
polite speech fraught with "pleases"
and "thank yous."
The only complaint so far is that
there are not enough hasherettes. One
eager and naive freshman who envis
ioned a bevy of girls serving him his
every meal demanded during pre-reg
that all the hasherettes wear name
tags, little suspecting that his house
had been allotted only one.
Males Happy
Wilbur's male hashers are gener
ally happy with their new helpmates,
though more wary and cunning than

the freshman. They claim full equal
ity in all chores and are liable to spare
their hasherette no labor. One fluster
ed hasherette rushed to the kitchen
for a fresh pitcher of lemonade, only
to find that a completely new batch
needed to be made. When she asked
a hasher to bring her the pitcher after
it was ready, he demanded to know
what class she belonged to. Un
wittingly she responded, "Senior."
Tlie lemonade never arrived.

The freshmen have not been slow
to respond to such close contact with
the elusive Stanford woman. They are
quick to establish ownership ("Are
you ours?") and do not hesitate to
ask the girls to share in their activi
ties.
One wistful freshman pleaded for a
study date so lie could just sit and
look at his "friendly hasherette's"
face. Undaunted by a polite refusal he
put in a bid for the next week's Flicks.

Wilbur Hasherette Program has gain
ed universal approval. The eight hash
erettes agree that their working con
ditions are very satisfying. They are
permitted free movement within a
virtually untapped preserve of Stan
ford manpower where they can either
cultivate dates to freshman parties
or exercise their maternal instincts
already spurned by upperclassmen.
Freshman AppH ii<'
Most hasherettes are extraordinar
ily sympathetic towards 1 he freshman
appetite, and will make any effort
to slip "her boys" extra milk, pie, or
potato gems behind the back of her
somewhat less compassionate head
hasher. A senior hasherette is partic
ularly known for her motherly emo
tions and has been known to stop
mid-flight between duties and anxious
ly question a Wilburite who has eaten
only half his meal. His customary re
sponse is to ask for another quart of
milk.
Freshmen applaud the innovation
and have willingly adjusted to the
presence of females in their dining
halls. At dinner time the Wilbur ver
nacular is temporarily replaced by
polite speech fraught with "pleases"
and "thank yous."
The only complaint so far is that
there are not enough hasherettes. One
eager and naive freshman who envis
ioned a bevy of girls serving him his
every meal demanded during pre-reg
that all the hasherettes wear name
tags, little suspecting that his house
had been allotted only one.
Males Happy
Wilbur's male hashers are gener
ally happy with their new helpmates,
though more wary and cunning than

the freshman. They claim full equal
ity in all chores and are liable to spare
their hasherette no labor. One fluster
ed hasherette rushed to the kitchen
for a fresh pitcher of lemonade, only
to find that a completely new batch
needed to be made. When she asked
a hasher to bring her the pitcher after
it was ready, he demanded to know
what class she belonged to. Un
wittingly she responded, "Senior."
Tlie lemonade never arrived.

The freshmen have not been slow
to respond to such close contact with
the elusive Stanford woman. They are
quick to establish ownership ("Are
you ours?") and do not hesitate to
ask the girls to share in their activi
ties.
One wistful freshman pleaded for a
study date so lie could just sit and
look at his "friendly hasherette's"
face. Undaunted by a polite refusal he
put in a bid for the next week's Flicks.
The new Wilbur hasherette com
bines all the qualities of a den mother,
sex symbol and confidante.
She. is the Food Service's decisive
step toward improving relations be
tween Wilbur freshmen and I he Stan
ford woman. This fall one feminine
hasher graces each of the eight din
ing rooms in Wilbur Hall, in addition
to the previously all-male crew.
Now entering its third week, the
Wilbur Hasherette Program has gain
ed universal approval. The eight hash
erettes agree that their working con
ditions are very satisfying. They are
permitted free movement within a
virtually untapped preserve of Stan
ford manpower where they can either
