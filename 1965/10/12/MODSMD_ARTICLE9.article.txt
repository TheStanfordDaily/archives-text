# Engineering Prof Sets Sights On District Demo Nomination
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
With a "deep concern for politics"
and some unique qualifications Stan
ford professor George Leppert is seek
ing the 10th Congressional District
seat.
In an interview with The Daily,
Leppert said that he had an excellent
chance in the Spring primaries to win
the Democratic nomination. He noted
that at present "there is no strong
candidate representing the democratic

vote in the district." He has already
received the support of several local
Democratic leaders.
The 10th District seat is presently
held by Representative Charles Gub
scr (Rep.-Gilroy), a seven term in
cumbent. The district takes in part
of Palo Alto, San Jose, and some rural
areas extending to Gilroy.
First Office Try
Despite the fact that he has never
run for elective office before, Leppert
believes that his scientific background
makes him particularly able to handle
the problems of the constituency.
Many large electronics and defense
firms, such as 1.8.M., Lockheed, and
Am phenol Space and Missile Systems,
are located in the area.
He said that the 10th District had
a highly educated populous, and that
he would count heavily on his aca
demic background in appealing to the
voters.
Presently u professor in the
Thermosciences Division of the En
gineering Department, Leppert helped
in the development of the first atomic
submarine at the Argonnc National
Laboratory. Later he organized and
headed the Stanford Nuclear Engin
eering Department.
A liberal democrat. Leppert plans
an aggressive campaign with strong
positions. Assessing his overall strat
egy. he said that it would take more
than a "middle of the road stand" to
unseat Gubser. "but it. can be done."
I'rotcst Foreign Policy
Leppert was among the ll'n Stan
ford professors who signed an ad in
the San Francisco Chronicle protest
ing United States foreign policy in
Viet Nam. According to the ad. ;ill
signers committed themselves to
picketing the President when lit- ;ip
prared in San Francisco. Leppert did
not picket, though he approved of the
activities.
Asked how he could still declare
himself a Democrat, Leppert noted
that certain changes in the Adminis
tration's policy have since put him in
accord with the President.
Leppert favors "exhausting all pos
sible avenues of negotiation" in South

cast Asia. He is opposed to further
bombing in North Viet Nam and sees
this point as a hindcrance to negotia
tions.
Farm Problems
He observed that the California
farm problem would also be an im
portant issue. Leppert approved the
stand taken by striking agricultural
workers in the Central Valley of Cali
fornia. The fundamental issue in
volved in the strikes, which. Stanford
students are supporting is whether
or not farmers will recognize the
union for collective bargaining.
The present importation of Mexican
nationals is not the solution to the
problem, lie said. Expanding his com
mittment to labor. Leppert supports
the pending legislation presently iti
Congress which would outlaw state
"right-to-work" legislation. Changes
in section 14b of the Taft-Hartley
Law Act would eliminate the states'
"union busting" powers.
