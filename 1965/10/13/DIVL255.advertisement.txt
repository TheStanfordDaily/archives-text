DON'T BE A CONFORMIST
Why conform to ci decadent, dying world? Isn't life more than tract homes and a color
TV set? Shouldn t success be more than two cars in the garage and a summer home in the
mountains? Isn't there more to life than keeping up with the Joneses and going along
with the crowd?
God, 100, is against drabness and staleness and conformity — that sterile sameness
which reduces men to robots, and life to mere drudgery. Nor is the alternative to con
formity revolution.
It comes as a surprise to many to Iparn that Jesus Christ is against rules and regulations,
ritual and ceremony, conformity and emptiness. He is the One who said, I arn come
that they might have life and that more abundantly'' (john 10:10).
It is a paradox, but nevertheless a fact, that a person becomes free only when he
yields the throne of his life to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. Although designed to be king
over the kingdom of our own life, each of us is a servant of sin, and unseen powers of
evil, until we individually ask Jesus Christ to set us free. ( If ttie Son shall make you free
you will be free indeed ' — John 8:36).
Entrusting one's life to the Mastery of Christ releases man to be all that his Creator
has intended him to be. All that has been built into us can only be released and unlocked
and unfolded as we seek the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, for He is the Key to Life.
Don t be a conformist) Let God transform your life. ". . . Give Jesus Christ your bodies,
as a living sacrifice, consecrated to Him and acceptable to Him. Don't let the world
around you squeeze you into its own mold, but let God remold your minds from Within,
so that you may prove in practice that the plan of God for you is good, meets all His
demands and moves toward the goal of true maturity (Romans 12:1, ? Phillips).

ritual and ceremony, conformity and emptiness. He is the One who said, I arn come
that they might have life and that more abundantly'' (john 10:10).
It is a paradox, but nevertheless a fact, that a person becomes free only when he
yields the throne of his life to the Lordship of Jesus Christ. Although designed to be king
over the kingdom of our own life, each of us is a servant of sin, and unseen powers of
evil, until we individually ask Jesus Christ to set us free. ( If ttie Son shall make you free
you will be free indeed ' — John 8:36).
Entrusting one's life to the Mastery of Christ releases man to be all that his Creator
has intended him to be. All that has been built into us can only be released and unlocked
and unfolded as we seek the power of the Lord Jesus Christ, for He is the Key to Life.
Don t be a conformist) Let God transform your life. ". . . Give Jesus Christ your bodies,
as a living sacrifice, consecrated to Him and acceptable to Him. Don't let the world
around you squeeze you into its own mold, but let God remold your minds from Within,
so that you may prove in practice that the plan of God for you is good, meets all His
demands and moves toward the goal of true maturity (Romans 12:1, ? Phillips).

DON'T BE A CONFORMIST
Why conform to ci decadent, dying world? Isn't life more than tract homes and a color
TV set? Shouldn t success be more than two cars in the garage and a summer home in the
mountains? Isn't there more to life than keeping up with the Joneses and going along
with the crowd?
God, 100, is against drabness and staleness and conformity — that sterile sameness
which reduces men to robots, and life to mere drudgery. Nor is the alternative to con
formity revolution.
It comes as a surprise to many to Iparn that Jesus Christ is against rules and regulations,
ritual and ceremony, conformity and emptiness. He is the One who said, I arn come
that they might have life and that more abundantly'' (john 10:10).
