ticipate in the vote on the resolution, which
was sponsored by 40 Asian-African countries.

> IHi Repeal Effort Halted
WASHINGTON - - A decision by Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont., to drop the
fight for repeal of Section 148 of the Taft-
Hartley Act automatically ended the Senate's
filibuster and cleared the way for Congress to
adjourn soon.
Mansgield said "the image is clear," and
Monday's 47-45 vote against limiting debate
convinced him "the Senate dues not wish the
leadership to press the attempt to take up
148 at this time."
The vote was not only short of a simple
majority but 17 votes shy of the required two

thirds majority.
The filibuster was against taking up a bill
to repeal that section of the law which per
mits states to ban union shop contracts that
require workers to join unions.

• Farm Workers Aid If itliheld
DELANO — The Office of Economic Op
portunity in Washington, D.C. has withheld a
$267,887 federal anti-poverty grant to the Na
tional Farm Workers Association (NFWAi
in Delano, currently embroiled in a bitter
strike of grape pickers and packers.
The grant was intended to finance a migrant
farm workers educational and citizenship

project. It was delayed at the request of Rep.
Harlan llagen, D-Calif. He questioned the
farm workers association's objectivity in ad
ministering the grant because of its role in
the five-week grape strike in the Delano area
of northern Kern and southern Tulare coun
ties.
