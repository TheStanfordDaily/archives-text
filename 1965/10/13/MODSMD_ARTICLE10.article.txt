staff hostesses. Women are now
calling students to invite them
to join their groups.

Owing to human fallibility
and illegible penmanship,
any student who signed up
to participate in the sym
posium and has not been
called by a faculty hostess
by this evening is asked to
contact Carol Lee Nance in
Florence. Moore,, extension
71, between 2 p.m. and (i p.m.

Students have been assigned
to 52 groups with 40 names as
alternates. In each group one
student has been designated as

a discussion leader to assist the
hostess in covering topics of
most interest to the students.
Each discussion leader and hos
tess will receive a suggested list
of topics and questions for their
group discussions.
Groups will continue to meet
for several weeks to discuss top
ics suggested by the symposium
or other matters of mutual in
terest. Attendance at these sub
sequent meetings is voluntary.
However, students who are un
able to attend are asked to either
notify their hostess or send a
substitute.
According to AWS President
Chick Sullivan, the continuity of
the symposium program is one
of its most important aspects.
