# â€˜Big Sisters' Now Taking Applications
## 
### 
Applications are now being ac
cepted for the Big-Sister pro
gram, a year-long contact be
tween Stanford coeds and girls
of junior high school age who
live in the Palo Alto area.
Stanford coeds are given thej
opportunity to help girls of col- j
lege potential who can profit 1
from both the authority and per- :
sonal warmth of an older friend
and mentor. Little sisters are
recommended for the program
by their school counselors and ,
range from girls who are shy j
and need companionship to pre
delinquents who need new inter-1
ests, objectives and attention.
Some of the most popular ac
tivities are general campus or
dormitory functions which give
the junior high participants an
opportunity to meet college girls
and learn about college life. As |
a result of this contact, many
Little Sisters then become inter
ested in attending college.
Applications can be obtained
from Dee Wilson at Lathrop
House or Karen Tiffany at Lagu
nity. Interviews will be held'
Monday, October 25. Sign-lips
for interviews will be made'when
applications are returned.
