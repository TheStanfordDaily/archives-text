## How About A Smile?

I've noticed that you can always pick out on the Stanford cam
pus the girls that have just got here.
It's hot a matte!' of age, because you can pick out the sopho
more and junior transfers too.
It is, I think, rather a matter of attitude.
New gills at Stanford are friendlier. That's about all there is
to it. They smile at you for example when you walk by them on
Quad. Girls who have been at Stanford for awhile don't.
Now Why should a Stanford girl be any less friendly than her
newly arrived counterpart from, say, San Jose Stale?
First, she's subject to a great deal more academic pressure, i
She's go) more things, and probably more important things, on her j
mind than remembering to smile at all the boys she sees.
But the second reason I suggest is that Stanford girls don't !
really have to be nice, or have to act friendly. They don't have to
compete. There are more than enough boys for everyone.
Many have remarked at how much friendlier the overseas
campuses are I think one of the major reasons for this is that
there are as many girls there as boys.
Many Stanford boys adopt the attitude that Stanford girls
aren't worth anything anyway, and that they'd rather take out
girls from other places. I think it's just that boys, however irration
ally, like to be smiled at — like to be flattered — and that other
girls, but not most Stanford girls, do.
