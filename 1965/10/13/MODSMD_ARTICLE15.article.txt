# KADI BRILLIANT
## Booters Dump SF St. 
### TOM EDISON 
With Kamel Kadi performing
a double-hat trick Stanford's
soccer team put forth their best
effort of the season in defeating
the hapless performers from
San Francisco State, 8-3, for
their second straight conference
victory .
Stanford, although on the of
fensive throughout the contest,
nonetheless showed inconsist
ency on defense. The Indian's
goalie performing in his first
varsity game had his troubles.
The fullbacks on defense, pos
sibly lacking confidence in their
inexperienced goalie, were con
tinually coming up 100 far and

too fast, leaving the goal un
protected.
San Francisco State goals
were slop-shots and resulted
from various mix-ups in front
of the goal.
Kadi Brilliant
Kamel Kadi was brilliant for
Stanford. Not only did he score
the Tribe's first six goals, which
gives him 10 in the last two
games, but he also set up the
other two scores with superb
passes. Bill Hurlbert and Tito
Bianehi scored Stanford's last
two goals.
As Stanford's Coach John
Priddle put it, "Without Kadi
we might have lost 3-2."

Kadi was all over the field.
Most of his goals resulted from
his own maneuvering. His fakes
and fantastic footwork showed
why he was picked as an Ail-
American last year.
Tito Bianchi and Roger Cod
win also played a fine game for
Stanford.
Saturday, Stanford's soccer
squad wil meet University of
San Francisco at 12:00 here at
Stanford.
