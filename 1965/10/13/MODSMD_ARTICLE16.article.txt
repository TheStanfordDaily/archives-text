# AAWU Showdown: Garrett vs. Defense
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
This season USC seems bent to
gain revenge for an unpopular
decision last year by the Rose
Bowl committee which sent Ore
gon State to Pasadena in spit,e
of the Trojans' stunning upset
of number-one ranked Notre
Dame.
Leading an overwhelming of
fensive attack is All-American
Mike Garrett. Most successful
football teams have revolved
around a spectacular quarter
back, but not this year's USC
squad. It revolves around Mike
Garrett, who overshadows quar
terback Troy Winslow.
3-0-1 Slate
USC has had little trouble with
their opponents, except against
Minnesota in the opening game
of the season. In that game the
quarterback situation was very
confused. Pat Mills started the
game for the Trojans, but threw
two interceptions. The Gophers
rallied in the fourth quarter to
gain an upset-tie.
Both Mills and Winslow saw
extensive service in the Wiscon
sin game, which the Trojans
won easily 26-6. In the Oregon
State game, Winslow saw almost
exclusive duty as the team lead
er. Although the Beavers led at
halftime 12-7, Garrett and Wins
low got going in full swing in the
second half to stomp Oregon.
The game last week against
Washington was played-up to be
one of the tightest and most-im
portant games on the Coast this
year. It sure may have been im
portant, but it was not very
close. It was sort of a joke.
Washington couldn't get going,
USC couldn't stop, and the net
result was a 34-0 crushing of the
Huskies.
In this game Winslow shone in
all of his greatest glory. Ho com
pleted 11 passes in 11 attempts.
Garrett ran 31 times for 175
yards to bring his rushing aver
age up to an incredible 162 aver
age for the first four games of
the season. ,

This is not meant to pretend
that USC has only good players
in the backfield. They've got
them all over the place — de
fense somewhat more than of
fense. The defense stunts a lot
and likes to have men switch
sides to confuse the offense and
to keep the opposition from
avoiding the famed combination
— Monster and Anchor.
These two, Denis Moore and
Ed King, have terrorized many
an opposing ball carrier. They
like to tackle, and they like to
tackle very hard in order to pre
cipitate a fumble. That sort of
stuff could cause trouble for the
Indians Saturday. The Monster
— King — isn't real generous
about yielding yardage.
A Heavy Bunch
Besides these two formidable
people, the USC defensive lineup
carries quite a bit of weight. The
entire starting unit weighs well
over a ton — 2313 pounds. Stunt
ing linemen, quick, agile line
backers, and an improved pass
defense present quite a problem
for offensive-minded opponents.
On the offensive side, Winslow
has improved greatly with ex
perience. Now that he has
emerged as a competent passer
the USC attack has great bal
ance. To aid Winslow he has
flanker-halfback Rod Sherman
and the great right end John
Thomas. Sherman does the 100
yard dash in 9.6. Thomas was
named to All-Coast second team
last year by UPI, though he
played in only six games, be
cause of a knee injury.
The offense just doesn't have
any weaknesses, with a great
varied attack and a powerful
front wall. On defense the Tro
jans can be hurt, though. On
passes USC isn'l too adept at
single coverages on the flanker.
Short passes in the middle can
hurt them.
But with such a formidable of
fense, the defense can afford to
occasionally be a little on the
lax side. The Trojans are aver
aging over twenty points per
game. They haven't lost a game,
and each week another piece has
fallen into a puzzle, which no
longer has many great problems
to solve. Maybe Stanford will
turn out to be one they can't
figure.
