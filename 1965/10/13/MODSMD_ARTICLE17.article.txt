# Fijis Fall To Sigma Chi In Grid Opener
## 
### JOHN O. CALMORE 
The 1964 champion Sigma
Chis sneaked past the Fijis 55-6
to highlight the action of this
year's opening week of intra
mural football. Last Wednes
day's performance by the Chis,
plus the fact they have about
3,000 returning lettermen, defin
itely prompts one to consider
them "the team to beat."
Taking up where they left off
last yeai\ the Sigma Chis' omni
present touchdown, due largely
to the throwing arm of Quarter
back Paul Hazelrig, could not
be stopped. Hazel rig's main tar
gets were Bruce Hagenson and
Jack Owens.
Basketball Scoring
Interestingly, the Sigma Chis
are better known for their skill
in basketball than in football; a
fact made obvious by their scor
ing-
Under Saturday morning's
sobering sunshine, upset-minded
Muir edged last year's runners
up Fremont, 7-6. With the pass
ing combination of Joe Meulleur
to Tom Petersmyers clicking
for an early touchdown, the
Muir defense preserved the vic
tory.
Fremont's offensive machine
couldn't cross the goal until late
in the game when Jim Blaschke
passed to John Stitt. The point
after-touchdown pass was in
complete and so was the come,
back.
Rinconada Impressive
In freshmen competition, Rin
conada looked impressive as it
pounced on Cedro 18-0. In its
second game, however, Rincon
ada lost a thriller to Arroyo,
19-18. Two touchdowns wore
scored in the last two minutes.
Arroyo was led by the passing
arm of Don Newcomer. His
scoring duel was with John Ha
good, Robbin Madden, and Bruce
Malfoit.
In spite of its win over Rin
conada, Arroyo is no better in
the standings. Passes from Dean
Sehlobohm to A 1 Williams pro
vided Otei'o with enough offens
ive punch to defeat Arroyo 16-0
in one of the opening contests.
Other teams to watch include
Los Arcos, a 12-0 victor over El
Capitan; Theta Xi which rolled
over Beta Chi 32-6; and Dormer
which ran over Holladay 19-6.
Thus the first week of intra
murals got off to a wild start.
And it loks like a busy year
for the director of intramurals,
Joseph R. Higgins. Last year 76
teams filled the schedule as well
over 800 individuals participated
in the competition.

after-touchdown pass was in
complete and so was the come,
back.
Rinconada Impressive
In freshmen competition, Rin
conada looked impressive as it
pounced on Cedro 18-0. In its
second game, however, Rincon
ada lost a thriller to Arroyo,
19-18. Two touchdowns wore
scored in the last two minutes.
Arroyo was led by the passing
arm of Don Newcomer. His
scoring duel was with John Ha
good, Robbin Madden, and Bruce
Malfoit.
In spite of its win over Rin
conada, Arroyo is no better in
the standings. Passes from Dean
Sehlobohm to A 1 Williams pro
vided Otei'o with enough offens
ive punch to defeat Arroyo 16-0
in one of the opening contests.
Other teams to watch include
Los Arcos, a 12-0 victor over El
Capitan; Theta Xi which rolled
over Beta Chi 32-6; and Dormer
which ran over Holladay 19-6.
Thus the first week of intra
murals got off to a wild start.
And it loks like a busy year
for the director of intramurals,
Joseph R. Higgins. Last year 76
teams filled the schedule as well
over 800 individuals participated
in the competition.
The 1964 champion Sigma
Chis sneaked past the Fijis 55-6
to highlight the action of this
year's opening week of intra
mural football. Last Wednes
day's performance by the Chis,
plus the fact they have about
3,000 returning lettermen, defin
itely prompts one to consider
them "the team to beat."
Taking up where they left off
last yeai\ the Sigma Chis' omni
present touchdown, due largely
to the throwing arm of Quarter
back Paul Hazelrig, could not
be stopped. Hazel rig's main tar
gets were Bruce Hagenson and
Jack Owens.
Basketball Scoring
Interestingly, the Sigma Chis
are better known for their skill
in basketball than in football; a
fact made obvious by their scor
ing-
Under Saturday morning's
sobering sunshine, upset-minded
Muir edged last year's runners
up Fremont, 7-6. With the pass
ing combination of Joe Meulleur
to Tom Petersmyers clicking
for an early touchdown, the
Muir defense preserved the vic
tory.
Fremont's offensive machine
couldn't cross the goal until late
in the game when Jim Blaschke
passed to John Stitt. The point
after-touchdown pass was in
complete and so was the come,
