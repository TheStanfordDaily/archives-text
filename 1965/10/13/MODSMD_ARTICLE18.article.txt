MINNEAPOLIS - ST. PAUL
(APt — Major league baseball
is considering a revolutionary
plan for replacing Ford Frick as
commissioner, The Associated
Press learned Tuesday night.
Proposed by Los Angelas
Dodger owner Walter O'Malley,
the plan calls for the new com
missioner to have a three-man
committee of deputy commis
sioners composed of the two
league presidents and Judge
Robert Cannon who would rep- j
resent the players. Judge Can
non is legal counsel for the
players.
O'Malley is expected to pre- ;
sent the plan to a meeting of
major league owners Oct. 19, in
Chicago. The new commissioner
is not expected to be named at
that time, but the meeting could
lead to a whittling of the list '
of candidates now said to num
ber 15.
Among the names said to be
still under consideration are
American League President Joe
Cronin and Baltimore Orioles
President Lee MacPhail. Cronin
has been told by American
League owners that they plan to
support MacPhail, but the Ori
oles' president lacks the National
League support needed to be
elected.
