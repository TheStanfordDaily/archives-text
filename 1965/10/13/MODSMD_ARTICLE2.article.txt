## 
### RISSA WHITE 
To be equal, people need not be
alike, asserted Prof. Theodosius Do
b/ha nsky in his lecture last night 011
"A Biologist's View of Human Equal
ity."
Addressing a capacity audience at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the authority
on genetics emphasized the fact that
the social institution of equality was
enhanced, not hindered, by biological
diversity.
"An identical •v&eiety would not
only be dull, but it would present dif
ficulties," he said. He asked the aud
ience to consider that in today's di
versified society there exist football
players and eggheads, stamp collect
ors and garbage collectors.
In an identical world, how would
jobs be assigned, he asked.
"By lottery? By date of birth?"
So, he pointed out, biological di
versity is not a caprice of Nature,
but a necessity. Political factions re
act differently to this fact.
"Liberals are traditionally distrust
fid of genetic differences. They feel
that these differences militate against
improving man's lot," he elaborated.
"On the other hand, conservatives
and reactionaries put great stock in
genetic differences, and feel the dif
ferences they produce are just and
unchangeable, thus making equality
a pipe dream.

"Both an? errors. Both confuse
political equality with biological iden
tity and inequality with diversity.
"The social institute of equality is
distinct from biology, but the equality
of opportunity is indispensable to the
application of diversity," Dobzhansky
repeated.
In a question-and-ansvvcr period
alter the lecture, he admitted that pro
viding equality of opportunity was a
theoretical ideal, since in the first six
years of men's life, they are exposed
to inequal cultures.
"This does not mean, however, that
man should give up trying to provide
equal opportunities."
lie refuted the racist's view that
some races are not competent enough
to handle equal opportunity. Even the
racist must realize, he said, that there
are intelligent and stupid in every
race.
Dobzhansky encouraged education
which would realize the capabilities
of each individaul, and was quick to
point out that this floes not mean
that everyone should be given the
same education.

"On the other hand, conservatives
and reactionaries put great stock in
genetic differences, and feel the dif
ferences they produce are just and

a pipe dream.

"Both an? errors. Both confuse
political equality with biological iden

"The social institute of equality is
distinct from biology, but the equality
of opportunity is indispensable to the
application of diversity," Dobzhansky
repeated.
In a question-and-ansvvcr period
alter the lecture, he admitted that pro
viding equality of opportunity was a
theoretical ideal, since in the first six
years of men's life, they are exposed
to inequal cultures.
"This does not mean, however, that
man should give up trying to provide
equal opportunities."
lie refuted the racist's view that
some races are not competent enough
to handle equal opportunity. Even the
racist must realize, he said, that there
are intelligent and stupid in every
race.
Dobzhansky encouraged education
which would realize the capabilities
of each individaul, and was quick to
point out that this floes not mean
that everyone should be given the
same education.


ON THE AIR—Jim Dunn, showing
the zecil of the radio reporter who
wants to get "the whole doggone
story,' emphasizes that station
KZSU began broadcasting again
last Saturday. KZSU, at 880 AM
and 90.1 FM, this year will feature
news at 55 minutes past every

To be equal, people need not be
alike, asserted Prof. Theodosius Do
b/ha nsky in his lecture last night 011
"A Biologist's View of Human Equal
ity."
Addressing a capacity audience at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the authority
on genetics emphasized the fact that
the social institution of equality was
enhanced, not hindered, by biological
diversity.
"An identical •v&eiety would not
only be dull, but it would present dif
ficulties," he said. He asked the aud
ience to consider that in today's di
versified society there exist football
players and eggheads, stamp collect
ors and garbage collectors.
In an identical world, how would
jobs be assigned, he asked.
"By lottery? By date of birth?"
So, he pointed out, biological di
versity is not a caprice of Nature,
but a necessity. Political factions re
act differently to this fact.
"Liberals are traditionally distrust
fid of genetic differences. They feel
that these differences militate against
improving man's lot," he elaborated.

and reactionaries put great stock in
