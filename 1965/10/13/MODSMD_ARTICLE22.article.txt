# LETTERS ON RUSH POLICY
## Appeals Board Will Fail 
### 
Editor, The Daily
Id the wake of what appears
to us to be a rather unjust fron
tal attack on the morals of the
fraternity system, and more re
cently an attack on our very
existence as an autonomous al
ternative in undergraduate hous
ing, we are proposing some dia
logue in our defense.
The attack by Professor Stone
(Oct. 41 assumes a relationship
between racial bigotry and the
choosing of one's friends and liv
ing companions. A number of
fraternities have already taken
firm and dynamic steps toward
! correcting unjust restrictions
! on local membership. We cite
i six examples in recent history:
Alpha Tau Omicron, Beta Chi,
Delta Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Sig
ma, Sigma Chi, and Theta Delta
Chi. All took steps with varying
results. All wore free to choose
their own course of action, and
each house then presented to
freshmen men an alternative so

lution to a complex problem.
This individuality of approach
we find a virtue.
To imply then, as Professor
Stone does, that fraternities
should cease to be critical in
their choice of membership as
sumes that the university is a
better judge of a man's charac
ter than we, and suggests guilt
for a nonexistent crime.
A fraternity is a group of com
patable friends living together
for their mutual benefit, and we
are not convinced that the ad
ministration's choice of high
school applicants through the
use of recommendations or other
criteria is any more substantial
than our own methods, and has
no bearing on our choice of
friends. We are sympathetic
with the fact that not all who
wish to join fraternities are able
to, but that is as much a prob
lem of available space as it is
"discrimination against the'Tur
key'." We feel there is enough
diversity in the goals of the vari
ous houses to accommodate al
most any type of fellow. We cite
for example, the variance in
house CPA's and activities.
The letter (Oct. 5) implying
that fraternities are automatic
ally guilty of stealing final
exams is absurd and completely
baseless. The author's admission
that his letter is based on rumor
adds weight to our argument.
Of paramount concern to us
is the threat contained in the
new rush proposal. This pro
posal is not in the interest of the
freshmen. Fraternities presently
offer a legitimate alternative in
upperclass housing. Their auton
omy, therefore, should be re
spected. Certainly there are
flaws in the present system of
rush, and fraternities have his
torically sought to correct these
flaws within the framework of
the I.F.C.
The recent proposals, however,
are a product of a committee
created by the Dean's Office
a committee which has no basis
as a legitimate source of the ans
wers to our problems, and has in
fact stemmed our effectiveness
further through these sugges
tions.
In particular, we feel the Ap
peals Board is a colossal fiasco.
This proposal limits the power
of the IFC by eliminating any
trace of self-adjudication and in
ternal control. Fraternities have
shown in their earnest efforts to
end discrimination that they can
act responsibly. We feel that the
ITC can and will assume the re
sponsibility for enforcing rush
policy.
We suggest then the immedi
ate rejection of this committee's
proposals by IFC tonight, both
in the interest of preserving the
uniqueness of the present fra
ternity system, and in the inter
est of fraternal autonomy.

Kditor, Tilt 1 Daily:
I am writing in the hope of
dispelling some confusion which !
seems to exist in regard to the j
Ad Hoc committee rush recom
mendations, evidenced by the j
Daily editorial of Monday, j
October 11. Since I am the only j
student still on campus who was I
involved last fall when discus-1
sions bogan which led to this '
policy, I feci that my perspective
on the situation might be help- j
fill.
First, a little background will |
be necessary. Autumn quarter, !
1964, the IFC President, the;
THC President, the Head Wilbur J
Sponsor, and the ICC President,
(myself), met to formulate rush :
regulations for last year. As ■
usual, the four groups could not j
agree. Realizing the futility of
trying to formulate a univers
ity-wide rush policy in this way.
year after year, it was agreed
that each group would write its
policy for that year. At the |
same time we decided to create j
the Ad Hoc Committee to take j
a new look at rush. This was
to be an inquiry free from self j
interest, its charge being simply j
to think freely and creatively, !
in any direction, about rush at ;
Stanford. However, this commit- j
tee had only an advisory capac- |
ity.
I might emphasize that Dean j
Gordon held at that time, and
still holds, that it is not the 1
proper function of the Dean's;
Office to create rush policies. ;
Rather, it is the function of
those groups directly involved. !
The product of the Ad Hoc Com
mittee's thinking, which we !
have before us now, was never i
intended in anyone's mind to be '
a rush policy to be authorized !
or enforced by the Dean's Office.
What was intended was exactly
what Rob Freeman and the IFC i
are doing right now. That is, for ;
each of the four groups to take ;
the Ad Hoc Committee's policy I
as a recommendation, to review j
it, and to make any decisions
and or suggestions they see fit.
Whatever is decided should be
sent back with their presidents !
to the meetings at which any i
responses and differences can
be tackled and a rush policy
can be agreed upon for this
year. I think this is being done
correctly, efficiently and in the
way t hat it was envisioned last
year. In any event, we will have
a rush policy created by stu
dents, to be authorized by stu
dents, and to be used and en
forced by the students. I hope
that we will be wise enough to ,
perpetuate this Ad Hoc Com
mittee with the same charge,
but with more time and re
sources for more revolutionary
work.

Id the wake of what appears
to us to be a rather unjust fron
tal attack on the morals of the
fraternity system, and more re
cently an attack on our very
existence as an autonomous al
ternative in undergraduate hous
ing, we are proposing some dia
logue in our defense.
The attack by Professor Stone
(Oct. 41 assumes a relationship
between racial bigotry and the
choosing of one's friends and liv
ing companions. A number of
fraternities have already taken
firm and dynamic steps toward
! correcting unjust restrictions
! on local membership. We cite
i six examples in recent history:
Alpha Tau Omicron, Beta Chi,
Delta Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Sig
ma, Sigma Chi, and Theta Delta
Chi. All took steps with varying
results. All wore free to choose
their own course of action, and
each house then presented to
freshmen men an alternative so

lution to a complex problem.
This individuality of approach
we find a virtue.
To imply then, as Professor
Stone does, that fraternities
should cease to be critical in
their choice of membership as
sumes that the university is a
better judge of a man's charac
ter than we, and suggests guilt
for a nonexistent crime.
A fraternity is a group of com
patable friends living together
for their mutual benefit, and we
are not convinced that the ad
ministration's choice of high
school applicants through the
use of recommendations or other
criteria is any more substantial
than our own methods, and has
no bearing on our choice of
friends. We are sympathetic
with the fact that not all who
wish to join fraternities are able
to, but that is as much a prob
lem of available space as it is
"discrimination against the'Tur
key'." We feel there is enough
diversity in the goals of the vari
ous houses to accommodate al
most any type of fellow. We cite
for example, the variance in
house CPA's and activities.
The letter (Oct. 5) implying
that fraternities are automatic
ally guilty of stealing final
exams is absurd and completely
baseless. The author's admission
that his letter is based on rumor
adds weight to our argument.
Of paramount concern to us
is the threat contained in the
new rush proposal. This pro
posal is not in the interest of the
freshmen. Fraternities presently
offer a legitimate alternative in
upperclass housing. Their auton
omy, therefore, should be re
spected. Certainly there are
flaws in the present system of
rush, and fraternities have his
torically sought to correct these
flaws within the framework of
the I.F.C.
The recent proposals, however,
are a product of a committee
created by the Dean's Office
a committee which has no basis
as a legitimate source of the ans
wers to our problems, and has in
fact stemmed our effectiveness
further through these sugges
tions.
In particular, we feel the Ap
peals Board is a colossal fiasco.
This proposal limits the power
of the IFC by eliminating any
trace of self-adjudication and in
ternal control. Fraternities have
shown in their earnest efforts to
end discrimination that they can
act responsibly. We feel that the
ITC can and will assume the re
sponsibility for enforcing rush
policy.
We suggest then the immedi
ate rejection of this committee's
proposals by IFC tonight, both
in the interest of preserving the
uniqueness of the present fra
ternity system, and in the inter
est of fraternal autonomy.

Id the wake of what appears
to us to be a rather unjust fron
tal attack on the morals of the
fraternity system, and more re
cently an attack on our very
existence as an autonomous al
ternative in undergraduate hous
ing, we are proposing some dia
logue in our defense.
The attack by Professor Stone
(Oct. 41 assumes a relationship
between racial bigotry and the
choosing of one's friends and liv
ing companions. A number of
fraternities have already taken
firm and dynamic steps toward
! correcting unjust restrictions
! on local membership. We cite
i six examples in recent history:
Alpha Tau Omicron, Beta Chi,
Delta Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Sig
ma, Sigma Chi, and Theta Delta
Chi. All took steps with varying
results. All wore free to choose
their own course of action, and
each house then presented to
freshmen men an alternative so

lution to a complex problem.
This individuality of approach
we find a virtue.
To imply then, as Professor
Stone does, that fraternities
should cease to be critical in
their choice of membership as
sumes that the university is a
better judge of a man's charac
ter than we, and suggests guilt
for a nonexistent crime.
A fraternity is a group of com
patable friends living together
for their mutual benefit, and we
are not convinced that the ad
ministration's choice of high
school applicants through the
use of recommendations or other
criteria is any more substantial
than our own methods, and has
no bearing on our choice of
friends. We are sympathetic
with the fact that not all who
wish to join fraternities are able
to, but that is as much a prob
lem of available space as it is
"discrimination against the'Tur
key'." We feel there is enough
diversity in the goals of the vari
ous houses to accommodate al
most any type of fellow. We cite
for example, the variance in
house CPA's and activities.
The letter (Oct. 5) implying
that fraternities are automatic
ally guilty of stealing final
exams is absurd and completely
baseless. The author's admission
that his letter is based on rumor
adds weight to our argument.
Of paramount concern to us
is the threat contained in the
new rush proposal. This pro
posal is not in the interest of the
freshmen. Fraternities presently
offer a legitimate alternative in
upperclass housing. Their auton
omy, therefore, should be re
spected. Certainly there are
flaws in the present system of
rush, and fraternities have his
torically sought to correct these
flaws within the framework of
the I.F.C.
The recent proposals, however,
are a product of a committee
created by the Dean's Office
a committee which has no basis
as a legitimate source of the ans
wers to our problems, and has in
fact stemmed our effectiveness
further through these sugges
tions.
In particular, we feel the Ap
peals Board is a colossal fiasco.
This proposal limits the power
of the IFC by eliminating any
trace of self-adjudication and in
ternal control. Fraternities have
shown in their earnest efforts to
end discrimination that they can
act responsibly. We feel that the
ITC can and will assume the re
sponsibility for enforcing rush
policy.
We suggest then the immedi
ate rejection of this committee's
proposals by IFC tonight, both
in the interest of preserving the
uniqueness of the present fra
ternity system, and in the inter
est of fraternal autonomy.

year after year, it was agreed

be tackled and a rush policy
can be agreed upon for this

correctly, efficiently and in the
way t hat it was envisioned last
year. In any event, we will have
a rush policy created by stu
dents, to be authorized by stu
dents, and to be used and en
forced by the students. I hope
that we will be wise enough to ,
perpetuate this Ad Hoc Com
mittee with the same charge,
but with more time and re
sources for more revolutionary
work.

Id the wake of what appears
to us to be a rather unjust fron
tal attack on the morals of the
fraternity system, and more re
cently an attack on our very
existence as an autonomous al
ternative in undergraduate hous
ing, we are proposing some dia
logue in our defense.
The attack by Professor Stone
(Oct. 41 assumes a relationship
between racial bigotry and the
choosing of one's friends and liv
ing companions. A number of
fraternities have already taken
firm and dynamic steps toward
! correcting unjust restrictions
! on local membership. We cite
i six examples in recent history:
Alpha Tau Omicron, Beta Chi,
Delta Tau Delta, Phi Kappa Sig
ma, Sigma Chi, and Theta Delta
Chi. All took steps with varying
results. All wore free to choose
their own course of action, and
each house then presented to
freshmen men an alternative so

lution to a complex problem.
This individuality of approach
we find a virtue.
To imply then, as Professor
Stone does, that fraternities
should cease to be critical in
their choice of membership as
sumes that the university is a
better judge of a man's charac
ter than we, and suggests guilt
for a nonexistent crime.
A fraternity is a group of com
patable friends living together
for their mutual benefit, and we
are not convinced that the ad
ministration's choice of high
school applicants through the
use of recommendations or other
criteria is any more substantial
than our own methods, and has
no bearing on our choice of
friends. We are sympathetic
with the fact that not all who
wish to join fraternities are able
to, but that is as much a prob
lem of available space as it is
"discrimination against the'Tur
key'." We feel there is enough
diversity in the goals of the vari
ous houses to accommodate al
most any type of fellow. We cite
for example, the variance in
house CPA's and activities.
The letter (Oct. 5) implying
that fraternities are automatic
ally guilty of stealing final
exams is absurd and completely
baseless. The author's admission
that his letter is based on rumor
adds weight to our argument.
Of paramount concern to us
is the threat contained in the
new rush proposal. This pro
posal is not in the interest of the
freshmen. Fraternities presently
offer a legitimate alternative in
upperclass housing. Their auton
omy, therefore, should be re
spected. Certainly there are
flaws in the present system of
rush, and fraternities have his
torically sought to correct these
flaws within the framework of
the I.F.C.
The recent proposals, however,
are a product of a committee
created by the Dean's Office
a committee which has no basis
as a legitimate source of the ans
wers to our problems, and has in
fact stemmed our effectiveness
further through these sugges
tions.
In particular, we feel the Ap
peals Board is a colossal fiasco.
This proposal limits the power
of the IFC by eliminating any
trace of self-adjudication and in
ternal control. Fraternities have
shown in their earnest efforts to
end discrimination that they can
act responsibly. We feel that the
ITC can and will assume the re
sponsibility for enforcing rush
policy.
We suggest then the immedi
ate rejection of this committee's
proposals by IFC tonight, both
in the interest of preserving the
uniqueness of the present fra
ternity system, and in the inter
est of fraternal autonomy.

• Proposal Defended
Kditor, Tilt 1 Daily:
I am writing in the hope of
dispelling some confusion which !
seems to exist in regard to the j
Ad Hoc committee rush recom
mendations, evidenced by the j
Daily editorial of Monday, j
October 11. Since I am the only j
student still on campus who was I
involved last fall when discus-1
sions bogan which led to this '
policy, I feci that my perspective
on the situation might be help- j
fill.
First, a little background will |
be necessary. Autumn quarter, !
1964, the IFC President, the;
THC President, the Head Wilbur J
Sponsor, and the ICC President,
(myself), met to formulate rush :
regulations for last year. As ■
usual, the four groups could not j
agree. Realizing the futility of
trying to formulate a univers
ity-wide rush policy in this way.
year after year, it was agreed
that each group would write its
policy for that year. At the |
same time we decided to create j
the Ad Hoc Committee to take j
a new look at rush. This was
to be an inquiry free from self j
interest, its charge being simply j
to think freely and creatively, !
in any direction, about rush at ;
Stanford. However, this commit- j
tee had only an advisory capac- |
ity.
I might emphasize that Dean j
Gordon held at that time, and
still holds, that it is not the 1
proper function of the Dean's;
Office to create rush policies. ;
Rather, it is the function of
those groups directly involved. !
The product of the Ad Hoc Com
mittee's thinking, which we !
have before us now, was never i
intended in anyone's mind to be '
a rush policy to be authorized !
or enforced by the Dean's Office.
What was intended was exactly
what Rob Freeman and the IFC i
are doing right now. That is, for ;
each of the four groups to take ;
the Ad Hoc Committee's policy I
as a recommendation, to review j
it, and to make any decisions
and or suggestions they see fit.
Whatever is decided should be
sent back with their presidents !
to the meetings at which any i
responses and differences can
be tackled and a rush policy
can be agreed upon for this
year. I think this is being done
correctly, efficiently and in the
way t hat it was envisioned last
