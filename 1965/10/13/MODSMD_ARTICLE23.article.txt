Among the multiple facets of the con
flict in Vietnam there are three whose
international significance 1 Wish to ex
amine briefly in this article.
A Revolutionary Technique
Of The Seisure Of Power
For anyone who has studied Commu
nist revolutionary techniques, the Viet
cong activities in South Vietnam appear
to be a classical pattern of Leninist-Mao
ist devices for waging the struggle for
Communist control in "colonial and semi
colonial" countries. In North Vietnam
where the Communists exercise a monop
oly of political power, the revolution is
supposedly in its higher, Socialist, phase,
whereas in South Vietnam it is still in
the first, "national democratic" phase.
This means that in South Vietnam the
emphasis is put on the mobilization of
peasant masses, on establishing a com
mon front with all "anti-imperialist pa
triotic forces," on fighting in the name of
"national self-determination."
Translated into the language of con
crete revolutionary action, these concepts
indicate to the Communist leadership,
both of North and South Vietnam, the
necessity to mobilize and politically
mould the peasants (Gregory Zinoviev,
first president of the Communist Inter
national, said: "He is not a Communist
who does not know how to maneuver the
peasants"*, to use isolated non-Commu
nist political figures as straw men for a
facade of national-democratic consensus,
and to combine these methods with the
"scientific" employment of terror against
all i he village leaders and rural adminis
trative cadres of the Saigon government
(the late President Kennedy termed this
"the deliberate savagery of the Commu
nist program of assassination, kidnap
ping and wanton violence").
There is no doubt that Communist skill
and fanaticism have brought many such
"victories," and left many a village lead
crless. But these methods of warfare and
terror are the very opposite of popular
self-determination, let alone individual
rights and free political process. Actu
ally, wherever the Communists take
over, whether it is Lenin or Tito or Mao
or Castro or Ho-Chi-minh, there is never
an election again. Thus Russia has gone
a half century now without permitting
self-determination in a single free elec
tion. Moreover, if ultimately victorious,
Vietcong would be celebrated (from the
Communist viewpoint rightly so)
throughout Asia, Africa and Latin Amer
ica as a paradigm of revolutionary zeal.
Nothing would ignite the brushfires of
"national liberation wars" throughout
the world better than a Vietcong victory
in South Vietnam.
Worldwide 'People's War'
To Destroy The United States
That the war in Vietnam is only a link
in a projected chain becomes obvious if
one reads the major pronouncement by
the Chinese Communist defense minister,
Marshal Lin Piao, issued on September
3, 1965. Here are the key sentences from
Marshal Lin's article: "It must be empha
sized that Comrade Mao Tse-tung's the
ory of the establishment of rural revolu
tionary base areas and the encirclement
of cities from the country-side is of out
standing and universal practical impor
tance for the present revolutionary strug
gles of all the oppressed nations and peo
ples, and particularly for the revolution

ary struggles of the oppressed nations
and peoples in Asia, Africa and Latin
America against imperialism and its
lackeys. . . . Taking the entire globe, if
North America and Western Europe can
be called 'the cities of the world,' then
Asia, Africa and Latin America consti
tute 'the rural areas of the world'." Prom
ising his readers "still more powerful
and splendid dramas in the theater of
people's war," the Chinese Marshal
makes self-refuting the assertion — most
recently made by Hans Morgenthau —
that "the basic direction of (Communist
China's) policies is determined primarily
by her traditional national interests (in
Asia)" ("War with China?" The New
Republic, April 3, 1965). On July 28, 1965,
President Johnson, much more realistic
ally, characterized the war in Vietnam as
"guided by North Vietnam and spurred
by Communist China. Its goal is to con
quer the South, to defeat American pow
er, and to extend the Asiatic dominion
of Communism." The refusal of many
Americans to face the unpleasant fact
that the Chinese Communist leaders in
tend ultimately to destroy the United
States and arc engaged throughout the
world in forming "the broadest possible
united front for a converging attack on
U.S. imperialism" (Marshal Lin), re
minds one of the pre-1939 period when
many non-Nazi Western intellectuals pre
ferred to ignore Hitler's ideological pro
nouncements and interpret his behavior
as determined primarily by German tra
ditional national interests.
American Firmness And
liitra-Commuiiist Feud
11 would l>c erroneous, of course, to
take the Chinese Communist intentions
as if they already were a reality. Quite
the contrary. The toughness of their
words contrasts in a remarkable fashion
with their careful avoidance of any direct
military confrontation with the Ameri
can "paper tiger." Moreover, and again
contrary to some gloomy predictions in
this country that the American bombing
of North Vietnam would result in bridg
ing over the Sino-Soviet disagreements,
the article of Marshal Lin Piao indicates
that the Sino-Soviet conflict has not lost
its previous sharpness. It is not unrea
sonable to assume that the display of
American strength and determination to
defend freedom in Vietnam has actually
deepened the intra-Communist feud,
since the Chinese and the Soviets are dis
puting more shrilly than ever over their
mutual strategy as being inadequate to
cope with American "imperialism."
American firmness in Vietnam today,
like American firmness in Greece eigh
teen years ago (which halted further
Stalinist encroachment in that part of
the world), makes particularly relevant
Zbigniew Brzezinski's words: "It is only
after the more revolutionary Communist
movement itself understands that at
tempts to change the status quo through
force of arms are doomed to failure, that
international stability may be possible in
Asia" ("Peace, Morality and Vietnam,"
The New Leader, April 12. 1965).
Indicating clearly that the United
States is not to be driven from the field
in Vietnam, and that America's allies
and all free nations can maintain their
confidence in American promise and pro
tection, President Johnson's administra
tion pursues today the only realistic path
to thwart the aggressive impulses of the
Chinese Communists, avoid a major In
ternational war, and create greater pos
sibilities for orderly and progressive
change in the world.
