## Life Of A Salesman 
### 
1 Oditor, The Daily:
. . . I wish to take issue with
those who, like General Taylor
himself, favor tactics of "legiti
mate Dissent" as the proper
means for expressing opposition
to the war in Viet Nam . . .
Taylor is a salesman. His talk
must be regarded as part of
the Government's campaign to
sell the war in Viet Nam to
t lie American public . . . For
while praising the merits of ma
ture and judicious deliberation,
of considering the pros, eons and
intricacies of all issues. Taylor
was careful not to complicate his
talk with consideration either
of intricacies or any "cons" of
the relevant issues. One of his
main points, for example, was
that all critics of the war, if
critical of our means and meth
ods, are agreed on the light
ness of the U.S. objective in
Viet Nam, viz. the preservation
of freedom. Taylor must know
that a great deal of the criticism
of the war has been addressed
to just that point. All critics of
the war, who are not merely con
structive critics, have pointed
out that the preservation ol
freedom in Viet Nam is a cause
we have opposed since at least
1953. when Diem came to power.
During the question period,
Taylor was asked the by now
stock question in the debate
in Viet Nam: "Why were there
no free elections in 1956 as guar
anteed in the Geneva Accords?"
His reply in the form of a rhe
torical question was a non se
quitur "When have there ever
been free elections in a Commun
ist country?" he asked. He fol
lowed this with a further irrelev
ancy, when he added that rec
ently there had been local elec
tions for small offices in some
provinces of Viet Nam. Nor did
lie complicate his answer with
mention of such petty details as
who was allowed to vote or what
alternatives were offered to the
voters.
For reasons such as these, I
feel it was perfectly justified
(but. too mild) for a young man
to yell out, "Did they have stra
tegic hamlets in Kansas or Mis
souri?" when Taylor used the
homey American example of the

border wars between Kansas and
Missouri to illustrate his point
that all "civil wars" (how could
anyone ever entertain the pos
sibility that the war in Viet Nam
is an imperialistic war?) are
bloody and dirty. The fact is
that, unlike the war between
Kansas and Missouri, the war in
Viet Nam is strategically dirty.
The U.S. pins all its hopes of
forcing the Vietnamese to the
conference table (on our terms*
on the use of dirty tactics . . .
Surely, if anybody knows this,
then General Maxwell Taylor
does. After all, he thought up the
main line of this strategy in
Vict Nam himself . . .
... It is particualrly strange
that so many Americans whose
delicate sensibilities, indeed
whose gentle natures, were of
fended by so slight and mild
a discourtesy as people holding
signs up in a public auditorium
aren't squeamish about, say, the
bombing of leper colonies or the
napolming of children.
ANATOLI: ANTON
â€¢ Adults Know
Editor, The Daily:
I have found
myself on more than one occas
ion mistakenly feeling the intel
lectual equal of adults, espec
ially in my contact with teach
ing assistants, many of whom
are not much older than T. It
seems to me that this sophomor
ic attitude is a major impetus
in compelling students to shout
down their more experienced
elders as corrupt or simply stu
pid. It is the inherent right and
obligation of students to ques
tion decisions and policies which
they consider ill-advised or im
moral. but for an intelligent and
relatively ignorant student to
denonce and desecrate . . . the
President . . . who has consid
ered with his well-qualified staff
of advisors all possible avenues
of approach to a plausible and
desirable solution ... is totajly
irresponsible. It seems, unfor
tunately, that it is a tendency
of students, who are not in this
informed position of power, to
look irrationally at such ques
tions from one idealistic and in
tangible viewpoint and to forget
pragmatism and realism along
with all other ideals.
