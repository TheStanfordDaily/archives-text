# Free Viet Elections Will Be Jeopardized
## 
### CHARLES A. DREKMEIER 
Kil. note — Mr. Drekmeier is an assist
ant professor in the department of Polit
ical Science.

I am not an authority on Southeast
Asia, not by any oxorci.se of the imagina
tion, and I have not been closor to Viet
nam than Colombo. But regarding a war
that daily grows more brutal and agoniz
ing, a war in which the casualty rate may
soon approach that of the Korean War,
we are all required to have opinions.
Opinion is what we almost always got
anyway. An acquaintance of mine, re
cently back from Vietnam I not a mem
ber of the Stanford faculty), says he rec
ommends complete military censorship
because most news stories are written
in the alcoholic haze of Saigon bars.
But is the alternative, the official re
lease, any nearer the truth?
Our original purpose in being in Viet
nam was to help, not replace, the South
Vietnamese in their struggles. Henry
Cabot Lodge remarked, just over a year
ago, that massive involvement would
mean that we have become a colonial
power, and, he said, "it's been pretty well
established that colonialism is over." For
getting that our original commitment to
South Vietnam was a matter of assis,
tance, forgetting that we long ago re
neged on our pledge to abide by the Ge
neva Agreements, forgetting many
things, Dean Rusk is still talking about
the integrity of our commitment to Viet
nam.
Guerilla An<l Populace
We have now taken on the great bur
den of a ground war. It is commonly held
that a ten-to-one ratio of our troops to
guerilla fighters is necessary to end the
kind of fighting that goes on in Vietnam.
And we know also that guerilla fighters
are not easily separated from the civil
ian populace: there are. those who insist
that it will be difficult to win such a war
short of what the rest of the world will
call genocide. In the last two years a
quarter million Vietnamese have died as
a result of hostilities.
Our Government has been widely criti
cized for the dropping of fire-bombs on
peasants and for the use of gas. We know
on good authority that torture has taken
place in the presence of American offi
cials. This is not to say that we have be
haved any worse than the Vietcong, or
I hasten to add, to imply support for
North Vietnamese policies (such as land
reform, which was undoubtedly conduc
ted in a harsh and relentless fashion).
But you and I are in a sense accountable
for what goes on in the name of America.
There are now well over 125,000 Amer
ican troops in Vietnam and if anyone
still thinks of this as a limited operation
he need only be reminded that in a single
day last month the bomb tonnage deliv
ered by our planes exceeded that of the
French Air Force during the eight weeks
on Dicnbienphu.
There is talk of an extension of the war
into Laos, in order to break supply lines,
and Premier Ky this summer began ral
lying his followers for the "coming in
vasion" of North Vietnam.
Moment Of Truth
But all this is beside the point, I'm told,
because we have reached a kind of Mo
ment of Truth in the struggle with World
Communism.
The White Paper, as almost all admit,
was distressingly weak when it came to
evidence for the assertions that were
made in that statement. Reports of the
International Control Commission on
movements from the north do not add up
to anything approximating "massive ag
gression." As Patrick Gordon Walker re
marked during the Toronto Teach In. the
weapons that have been provided by Rus

sia and China have been mostly defen
sive.
The central question is probably the
one that concerns the character of the
enemy. Here again I have access only to
sources which are available to all. But 1
am convinced that to describe the Na
tional Liberation Front simply as "the
instrument of the Communist Party of
North Vietnam" (as Prof. Scalopino char
acterized the NLF during the recent
Teach-In) is a gross simplification, 112
would myself, be sceptical of attempts to
depict the NLF as a democratic coalition,
but it is probably true that the political
wing of the Vieteong contains elements
other than militant communists, that its
leadership comes from the South and in
cludes men who are not known Commu
nist*. and that on occasion it has evinced
a suspicion of Hanoi.
Jean Laeouturc (LeMoiuU*i makes the
same points about Vietnam nationalism,
sectionalism, and fear of Chinese domina
tion: in foreign policy the Front has in
creasingly stressed the idea of a neutral
and independent South Vietnam. And ac
tually it was not until 1960 that North
ern Communist leaders became inter
ested in a possible involvement in the
affairs of the Soutli and then, accord
ing to Lacouture, in response to criti
cisms of their indifference which came
from the South. (New Republic, 6
March).
The French writers have raised the
question whether the assistance of North
Vietnam is to he viewed as "foreign"
aid. At any rate, even by the Pentagon's
estimate ii amounts to only 15 per cent
of the VC war effort. (Other estimates
are as low as 3 per cent.) The Vieteong
was accepted by President Kennedy as
au indigenous movement. Indeed, it can
only be understood as a revolt generated
by local conditions.
The success of guerilla operations sug
gests that the Vieteong enjoys the sup
port of a great many South Vietnamese.
David Halberstam estimates that two
thirds of the population of the country
side is at least sympathetic to the VC.
The same observation was made by the
highest ranking VC defector, as reported
in the N Y Times, 23 May ).
VC More Attractive
Prof. Scalopino speaks of voting "with
one's feet" (a reference to the million
who left North Vietnam at the time of
the partition |Scalopino makes no men
tion of the special religious features of
this exodus]) and it may be significant
that until recently the desertion rate of
South Vietnam forces was about six
times that of the VC. The desertion rate
among recruits to Ihc Saigon army has
been as high as 50 per cent (last Juno).
We ought to at least entertain the
thought that the VC may be closer to
what the South Vietnamese want than is
Marshall Ky who said, until our PR
men got to him. that in his opinion what
Vietnam needed was not one but five
Hitlers. Unfortunate slip, but revealing.
We cannot know what the future of
liberal institutions will be in South Viet
nam whether free elections will be pos
sible more than once if the NLF wins
them. Prof. Scalopino and Joseph Alsop
know, but some of the rest of us feel
that unwillingness to support the prin
ciple of free elections will indicate a fail
ure of nerve and admission of our own
bankruptcy especially after our re
fusal to support free elections following
the Geneva Agreements (which has hurt
our campaigns for free elections else
where in the world).
The acquaintance I quoted earlier on
military censorship says no free elections
for ten years. We must, he says, teach
them "social responsibility." But in such
a case, what are the teacher's creden
tials?

into Laos, in order to break supply lines,
and Premier Ky this summer began ral
lying his followers for the "coming in
vasion" of North Vietnam.
Moment Of Truth
But all this is beside the point, I'm told,
because we have reached a kind of Mo
ment of Truth in the struggle with World
Communism.
The White Paper, as almost all admit,
was distressingly weak when it came to
evidence for the assertions that were
made in that statement. Reports of the
International Control Commission on
movements from the north do not add up
to anything approximating "massive ag
gression." As Patrick Gordon Walker re
marked during the Toronto Teach In. the
weapons that have been provided by Rus

sia and China have been mostly defen
sive.
The central question is probably the
one that concerns the character of the
enemy. Here again I have access only to
sources which are available to all. But 1
am convinced that to describe the Na
tional Liberation Front simply as "the
instrument of the Communist Party of
North Vietnam" (as Prof. Scalopino char
acterized the NLF during the recent
Teach-In) is a gross simplification, 112
would myself, be sceptical of attempts to
depict the NLF as a democratic coalition,
but it is probably true that the political
wing of the Vieteong contains elements
other than militant communists, that its
leadership comes from the South and in
cludes men who are not known Commu
nist*. and that on occasion it has evinced
a suspicion of Hanoi.
Jean Laeouturc (LeMoiuU*i makes the
same points about Vietnam nationalism,
sectionalism, and fear of Chinese domina
tion: in foreign policy the Front has in
creasingly stressed the idea of a neutral
and independent South Vietnam. And ac
tually it was not until 1960 that North
ern Communist leaders became inter
ested in a possible involvement in the
affairs of the Soutli and then, accord
ing to Lacouture, in response to criti
cisms of their indifference which came
from the South. (New Republic, 6
March).
The French writers have raised the
question whether the assistance of North
Vietnam is to he viewed as "foreign"
aid. At any rate, even by the Pentagon's
estimate ii amounts to only 15 per cent
of the VC war effort. (Other estimates
are as low as 3 per cent.) The Vieteong
was accepted by President Kennedy as
au indigenous movement. Indeed, it can
only be understood as a revolt generated
by local conditions.
The success of guerilla operations sug
gests that the Vieteong enjoys the sup
port of a great many South Vietnamese.
David Halberstam estimates that two
thirds of the population of the country
side is at least sympathetic to the VC.
The same observation was made by the
highest ranking VC defector, as reported
in the N Y Times, 23 May ).
VC More Attractive
Prof. Scalopino speaks of voting "with
one's feet" (a reference to the million
who left North Vietnam at the time of
the partition |Scalopino makes no men
tion of the special religious features of
this exodus]) and it may be significant
that until recently the desertion rate of
South Vietnam forces was about six
times that of the VC. The desertion rate
among recruits to Ihc Saigon army has
been as high as 50 per cent (last Juno).
We ought to at least entertain the
thought that the VC may be closer to
what the South Vietnamese want than is
Marshall Ky who said, until our PR
men got to him. that in his opinion what
Vietnam needed was not one but five
Hitlers. Unfortunate slip, but revealing.
We cannot know what the future of
liberal institutions will be in South Viet
nam whether free elections will be pos
sible more than once if the NLF wins
them. Prof. Scalopino and Joseph Alsop
know, but some of the rest of us feel
that unwillingness to support the prin
ciple of free elections will indicate a fail
ure of nerve and admission of our own
bankruptcy especially after our re
fusal to support free elections following
the Geneva Agreements (which has hurt
our campaigns for free elections else
where in the world).
The acquaintance I quoted earlier on
military censorship says no free elections
for ten years. We must, he says, teach
them "social responsibility." But in such
a case, what are the teacher's creden
tials?
Kil. note — Mr. Drekmeier is an assist

I am not an authority on Southeast
Asia, not by any oxorci.se of the imagina
tion, and I have not been closor to Viet
nam than Colombo. But regarding a war
that daily grows more brutal and agoniz
ing, a war in which the casualty rate may
soon approach that of the Korean War,
we are all required to have opinions.
Opinion is what we almost always got
anyway. An acquaintance of mine, re
cently back from Vietnam I not a mem
ber of the Stanford faculty), says he rec
ommends complete military censorship
because most news stories are written
in the alcoholic haze of Saigon bars.
But is the alternative, the official re
lease, any nearer the truth?
Our original purpose in being in Viet
nam was to help, not replace, the South
Vietnamese in their struggles. Henry
Cabot Lodge remarked, just over a year
ago, that massive involvement would
mean that we have become a colonial
power, and, he said, "it's been pretty well
established that colonialism is over." For
getting that our original commitment to
South Vietnam was a matter of assis,
tance, forgetting that we long ago re
neged on our pledge to abide by the Ge
neva Agreements, forgetting many
things, Dean Rusk is still talking about
the integrity of our commitment to Viet
nam.
Guerilla An<l Populace
We have now taken on the great bur
den of a ground war. It is commonly held
that a ten-to-one ratio of our troops to
guerilla fighters is necessary to end the
kind of fighting that goes on in Vietnam.
And we know also that guerilla fighters
are not easily separated from the civil
ian populace: there are. those who insist
that it will be difficult to win such a war
short of what the rest of the world will
call genocide. In the last two years a
quarter million Vietnamese have died as
a result of hostilities.
Our Government has been widely criti
cized for the dropping of fire-bombs on
peasants and for the use of gas. We know
on good authority that torture has taken
place in the presence of American offi
cials. This is not to say that we have be
haved any worse than the Vietcong, or
I hasten to add, to imply support for
North Vietnamese policies (such as land
reform, which was undoubtedly conduc
ted in a harsh and relentless fashion).
But you and I are in a sense accountable
for what goes on in the name of America.
There are now well over 125,000 Amer
ican troops in Vietnam and if anyone
still thinks of this as a limited operation
he need only be reminded that in a single
day last month the bomb tonnage deliv
ered by our planes exceeded that of the
French Air Force during the eight weeks
on Dicnbienphu.

one's feet" (a reference to the million
who left North Vietnam at the time of
the partition |Scalopino makes no men
tion of the special religious features of
this exodus]) and it may be significant
that until recently the desertion rate of
South Vietnam forces was about six
times that of the VC. The desertion rate
among recruits to Ihc Saigon army has
been as high as 50 per cent (last Juno).
We ought to at least entertain the
thought that the VC may be closer to
what the South Vietnamese want than is
Marshall Ky who said, until our PR
men got to him. that in his opinion what
Vietnam needed was not one but five
Hitlers. Unfortunate slip, but revealing.
We cannot know what the future of
liberal institutions will be in South Viet
nam whether free elections will be pos
sible more than once if the NLF wins
them. Prof. Scalopino and Joseph Alsop
know, but some of the rest of us feel
that unwillingness to support the prin
ciple of free elections will indicate a fail
ure of nerve and admission of our own
bankruptcy especially after our re
fusal to support free elections following
the Geneva Agreements (which has hurt
our campaigns for free elections else
where in the world).
The acquaintance I quoted earlier on
military censorship says no free elections
for ten years. We must, he says, teach
them "social responsibility." But in such
a case, what are the teacher's creden
tials?

I am not an authority on Southeast
Asia, not by any oxorci.se of the imagina
tion, and I have not been closor to Viet
nam than Colombo. But regarding a war
that daily grows more brutal and agoniz
ing, a war in which the casualty rate may
soon approach that of the Korean War,
we are all required to have opinions.
Opinion is what we almost always got
anyway. An acquaintance of mine, re
cently back from Vietnam I not a mem
ber of the Stanford faculty), says he rec
ommends complete military censorship
because most news stories are written
in the alcoholic haze of Saigon bars.
But is the alternative, the official re
lease, any nearer the truth?
Our original purpose in being in Viet
nam was to help, not replace, the South
Vietnamese in their struggles. Henry
Cabot Lodge remarked, just over a year
ago, that massive involvement would
mean that we have become a colonial
power, and, he said, "it's been pretty well
established that colonialism is over." For
getting that our original commitment to
South Vietnam was a matter of assis,
tance, forgetting that we long ago re
neged on our pledge to abide by the Ge
neva Agreements, forgetting many
things, Dean Rusk is still talking about
the integrity of our commitment to Viet
nam.
Guerilla An<l Populace
We have now taken on the great bur
den of a ground war. It is commonly held
that a ten-to-one ratio of our troops to
guerilla fighters is necessary to end the
kind of fighting that goes on in Vietnam.
And we know also that guerilla fighters
are not easily separated from the civil
ian populace: there are. those who insist
that it will be difficult to win such a war
short of what the rest of the world will
call genocide. In the last two years a
quarter million Vietnamese have died as
a result of hostilities.
Our Government has been widely criti
cized for the dropping of fire-bombs on
peasants and for the use of gas. We know
on good authority that torture has taken
place in the presence of American offi
cials. This is not to say that we have be
haved any worse than the Vietcong, or
I hasten to add, to imply support for
North Vietnamese policies (such as land
reform, which was undoubtedly conduc
ted in a harsh and relentless fashion).
But you and I are in a sense accountable
for what goes on in the name of America.
There are now well over 125,000 Amer
ican troops in Vietnam and if anyone
still thinks of this as a limited operation
he need only be reminded that in a single
day last month the bomb tonnage deliv
ered by our planes exceeded that of the
French Air Force during the eight weeks
on Dicnbienphu.
There is talk of an extension of the war
into Laos, in order to break supply lines,
and Premier Ky this summer began ral
lying his followers for the "coming in
vasion" of North Vietnam.
Moment Of Truth
But all this is beside the point, I'm told,
because we have reached a kind of Mo
ment of Truth in the struggle with World
Communism.
The White Paper, as almost all admit,
was distressingly weak when it came to
evidence for the assertions that were
made in that statement. Reports of the
International Control Commission on
movements from the north do not add up
to anything approximating "massive ag
gression." As Patrick Gordon Walker re
marked during the Toronto Teach In. the
weapons that have been provided by Rus

sia and China have been mostly defen
sive.
The central question is probably the
one that concerns the character of the
enemy. Here again I have access only to
sources which are available to all. But 1
am convinced that to describe the Na
tional Liberation Front simply as "the
instrument of the Communist Party of
North Vietnam" (as Prof. Scalopino char
acterized the NLF during the recent
Teach-In) is a gross simplification, 112
would myself, be sceptical of attempts to
depict the NLF as a democratic coalition,
but it is probably true that the political
wing of the Vieteong contains elements
other than militant communists, that its
leadership comes from the South and in
cludes men who are not known Commu
nist*. and that on occasion it has evinced
a suspicion of Hanoi.
Jean Laeouturc (LeMoiuU*i makes the
same points about Vietnam nationalism,
sectionalism, and fear of Chinese domina
tion: in foreign policy the Front has in
creasingly stressed the idea of a neutral
and independent South Vietnam. And ac
tually it was not until 1960 that North
ern Communist leaders became inter
ested in a possible involvement in the
affairs of the Soutli and then, accord
ing to Lacouture, in response to criti
cisms of their indifference which came
from the South. (New Republic, 6
March).
The French writers have raised the
question whether the assistance of North
Vietnam is to he viewed as "foreign"
aid. At any rate, even by the Pentagon's
estimate ii amounts to only 15 per cent
of the VC war effort. (Other estimates
are as low as 3 per cent.) The Vieteong
was accepted by President Kennedy as
au indigenous movement. Indeed, it can
only be understood as a revolt generated
by local conditions.
The success of guerilla operations sug
gests that the Vieteong enjoys the sup
port of a great many South Vietnamese.
David Halberstam estimates that two
thirds of the population of the country
side is at least sympathetic to the VC.
The same observation was made by the
highest ranking VC defector, as reported
in the N Y Times, 23 May ).

den of a ground war. It is commonly held
that a ten-to-one ratio of our troops to
guerilla fighters is necessary to end the
kind of fighting that goes on in Vietnam.
And we know also that guerilla fighters
are not easily separated from the civil
ian populace: there are. those who insist
that it will be difficult to win such a war
short of what the rest of the world will
call genocide. In the last two years a
quarter million Vietnamese have died as
a result of hostilities.
Our Government has been widely criti
cized for the dropping of fire-bombs on
peasants and for the use of gas. We know
on good authority that torture has taken
place in the presence of American offi
cials. This is not to say that we have be
haved any worse than the Vietcong, or
I hasten to add, to imply support for
North Vietnamese policies (such as land
reform, which was undoubtedly conduc
ted in a harsh and relentless fashion).
But you and I are in a sense accountable
for what goes on in the name of America.
There are now well over 125,000 Amer
ican troops in Vietnam and if anyone
still thinks of this as a limited operation
he need only be reminded that in a single
day last month the bomb tonnage deliv
ered by our planes exceeded that of the
French Air Force during the eight weeks
on Dicnbienphu.
There is talk of an extension of the war
into Laos, in order to break supply lines,
and Premier Ky this summer began ral
lying his followers for the "coming in
vasion" of North Vietnam.
Moment Of Truth
But all this is beside the point, I'm told,
because we have reached a kind of Mo
ment of Truth in the struggle with World
Communism.
The White Paper, as almost all admit,
was distressingly weak when it came to
evidence for the assertions that were
made in that statement. Reports of the
International Control Commission on
movements from the north do not add up
to anything approximating "massive ag
gression." As Patrick Gordon Walker re
marked during the Toronto Teach In. the
weapons that have been provided by Rus

sia and China have been mostly defen
sive.
The central question is probably the
one that concerns the character of the
enemy. Here again I have access only to
sources which are available to all. But 1
am convinced that to describe the Na
tional Liberation Front simply as "the
instrument of the Communist Party of
North Vietnam" (as Prof. Scalopino char
acterized the NLF during the recent
Teach-In) is a gross simplification, 112
would myself, be sceptical of attempts to
depict the NLF as a democratic coalition,
but it is probably true that the political
wing of the Vieteong contains elements
other than militant communists, that its
leadership comes from the South and in
cludes men who are not known Commu
nist*. and that on occasion it has evinced
a suspicion of Hanoi.
Jean Laeouturc (LeMoiuU*i makes the
same points about Vietnam nationalism,
sectionalism, and fear of Chinese domina
tion: in foreign policy the Front has in
creasingly stressed the idea of a neutral
and independent South Vietnam. And ac
tually it was not until 1960 that North
ern Communist leaders became inter
ested in a possible involvement in the
affairs of the Soutli and then, accord
ing to Lacouture, in response to criti
cisms of their indifference which came
from the South. (New Republic, 6
March).
The French writers have raised the
question whether the assistance of North
Vietnam is to he viewed as "foreign"
aid. At any rate, even by the Pentagon's
estimate ii amounts to only 15 per cent
of the VC war effort. (Other estimates
are as low as 3 per cent.) The Vieteong
was accepted by President Kennedy as
au indigenous movement. Indeed, it can
only be understood as a revolt generated
by local conditions.
The success of guerilla operations sug
gests that the Vieteong enjoys the sup
port of a great many South Vietnamese.
David Halberstam estimates that two
thirds of the population of the country
side is at least sympathetic to the VC.
The same observation was made by the
highest ranking VC defector, as reported
in the N Y Times, 23 May ).
VC More Attractive
Prof. Scalopino speaks of voting "with
one's feet" (a reference to the million
who left North Vietnam at the time of
the partition |Scalopino makes no men
tion of the special religious features of
this exodus]) and it may be significant
that until recently the desertion rate of
South Vietnam forces was about six
times that of the VC. The desertion rate
among recruits to Ihc Saigon army has
been as high as 50 per cent (last Juno).
We ought to at least entertain the
thought that the VC may be closer to
what the South Vietnamese want than is
Marshall Ky who said, until our PR
men got to him. that in his opinion what
Vietnam needed was not one but five
Hitlers. Unfortunate slip, but revealing.
We cannot know what the future of
liberal institutions will be in South Viet
nam whether free elections will be pos
sible more than once if the NLF wins
them. Prof. Scalopino and Joseph Alsop
know, but some of the rest of us feel
that unwillingness to support the prin
ciple of free elections will indicate a fail
ure of nerve and admission of our own
bankruptcy especially after our re
fusal to support free elections following
the Geneva Agreements (which has hurt
our campaigns for free elections else
where in the world).
The acquaintance I quoted earlier on
military censorship says no free elections
for ten years. We must, he says, teach
them "social responsibility." But in such
a case, what are the teacher's creden
tials?

ant professor in the department of Polit
ical Science.

I am not an authority on Southeast
Asia, not by any oxorci.se of the imagina
tion, and I have not been closor to Viet
nam than Colombo. But regarding a war
that daily grows more brutal and agoniz
ing, a war in which the casualty rate may
soon approach that of the Korean War,
we are all required to have opinions.
Opinion is what we almost always got
anyway. An acquaintance of mine, re
cently back from Vietnam I not a mem
ber of the Stanford faculty), says he rec
ommends complete military censorship
because most news stories are written
in the alcoholic haze of Saigon bars.
But is the alternative, the official re
lease, any nearer the truth?
Our original purpose in being in Viet
nam was to help, not replace, the South
Vietnamese in their struggles. Henry
Cabot Lodge remarked, just over a year
ago, that massive involvement would
mean that we have become a colonial
power, and, he said, "it's been pretty well
established that colonialism is over." For
getting that our original commitment to
South Vietnam was a matter of assis,
tance, forgetting that we long ago re
neged on our pledge to abide by the Ge
neva Agreements, forgetting many
things, Dean Rusk is still talking about
the integrity of our commitment to Viet
nam.
