## 
### 
A record 11,088 students enrolled
at Stanford this fall, Registrar Har
vey Hall reported yesterday. The in
crease of 315 over last year's total
reflects the national trend of greater
survival of graduate students, as well
as an increase in the number of trans
fers, according to Hall.
Of the new total, 5,258 were gradu
ate students and 5,830 were under
graduates. Last year at 1 his time the
totals were 4,956 and 5,729 respect
ively.
The University's faculty now num
bers 1,125, including 811 with profes
sorial rank and 314 instructors and
other salaried teaching personnel. The
student-faculty ratio is 9.9 to 1.
Tuition has gone up to $1,575 for
thro quarters, as Stanford students
are painfully aware. This is an in
crease of $315 from the figue five
years ago and up $3185 from 1910.
Most students, both undergraduates
and graduates, are majoring in Hu
manities and Sciences. The smallest
number in undergraduate majors
wore six in law and seven in educa
tion.
The increase in the number of
transfers can be traced to the expan
sion of overseas campuses, acording
to Director of Admissions Rixfoni
Snyder. His office had a higher quota
to fill this year than previously.
