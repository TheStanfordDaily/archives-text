## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
The Stanford Committee for Peace
in Viet Nam (SCPVt and the Cali
fornia ns for Peace in Viet Nam
(CPU) are joining with hundreds of
similar groups across the country and
in several foreign lands to stage In
ternational Days of Protest against

the United States policy in Viet Nam.
The formal protest begins today
with a noon speech in White Memor
ial Plaza by Professor Milorad Draeh
kovitch of the Hoover Institution on
Soviet Imperialism and will conclude
Saturday morning with a peace
march through Palo Alto.
The motivation for the internation

al protest came l'rom groups at the
University of California at Berkeley
and the University of Michigan. Both
campuses have served to coordinate
efforts for demonstrations in 60 Am
erican cities and ten foreign countries.
Reason for Protest
In a letter sent to members of the
Stanford faculty, the all-stuclent
SCPV explained the reason for the
protest: "Many people are profoundly
disturbed about America's involve
ment. in the Viet Nam War. not only
because they believe it is politically
folish and against the national inter
est, but because of its immorality."
Beginning today, the SCPV will
will stage a 60 hour "Witness of Pro
test" in White Memorial Plaza. The
students will camp on the plaza. Com
menting on this phase of the protest.
Professor Charles Drekmeir said, "I
suppose that's what they built White
Memorial Plaza for."
During class hours Thursday and
Friday, Hie plaza will also serve as
site for an open forum and action
workshop. The forum will give stu
dents a chance to discuss American
foreign policy with SCPV members
and Stanford professors who are sup
porting the protest.
Picketed the President
The Californians for Peace in Viet
Nam represents faculty members tak
ing part in the protest. Formerly the
professors were also known as the
Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
Nam, but changed the name of the or
ganizaton to prevent any seeming
association with the University. This
is the same group that picketed Pr esi
dent Johnson when he visited San
Francisco in June.
The function of the workshops will
be to collect signatures on a faculty
sponsored petition demanding an end
to the bombings in North Viet Nam
and urging the recognition of the Na
tional Liberation Front as an inde
pendent bargaining agent. Members
of the SCPV 7 " will also be writing and
researching leaflets and collecting
money for political advertisements.
March on Paly
The demonstrations will come to an
end Saturday morning. Members of
the SCPV and the CPV plan to march
from White Memorial Plaza to Cogs
well Plaza in Palo Alto. There they
will join a rally staged by the con
cerned Citizens of Palo Alto, and
later complete the peace march
through Palo Alto and the Stanford
Shopping Center.
A similar march is planned by the
Viet Nam Day Committee of Berke
ley. The group will parade through
the Oakland Army Terminal.
Other activities during the four-day
protest at Stanford include a panel
presentation in Cubberley Auditor
ium. "Viet Nam A Matter of Con
science." Participants are Amitai El
zioni of Columbia, Brice Franklin of
Stanford, and Marshall Windmiller of

San Francisco State.
The Stanford Committee for Peace
in Viet Nam (SCPVt and the Cali
fornia ns for Peace in Viet Nam
(CPU) are joining with hundreds of
similar groups across the country and
in several foreign lands to stage In
ternational Days of Protest against

the United States policy in Viet Nam.
The formal protest begins today
with a noon speech in White Memor
ial Plaza by Professor Milorad Draeh
kovitch of the Hoover Institution on
Soviet Imperialism and will conclude
Saturday morning with a peace
march through Palo Alto.
The motivation for the internation

al protest came l'rom groups at the
University of California at Berkeley
and the University of Michigan. Both
campuses have served to coordinate
efforts for demonstrations in 60 Am
erican cities and ten foreign countries.
Reason for Protest
In a letter sent to members of the
Stanford faculty, the all-stuclent
SCPV explained the reason for the
protest: "Many people are profoundly
disturbed about America's involve
ment. in the Viet Nam War. not only
because they believe it is politically
folish and against the national inter
est, but because of its immorality."
Beginning today, the SCPV will
will stage a 60 hour "Witness of Pro
test" in White Memorial Plaza. The
students will camp on the plaza. Com
menting on this phase of the protest.
Professor Charles Drekmeir said, "I
suppose that's what they built White
Memorial Plaza for."
During class hours Thursday and
Friday, Hie plaza will also serve as
site for an open forum and action
workshop. The forum will give stu
dents a chance to discuss American
foreign policy with SCPV members
and Stanford professors who are sup
porting the protest.
Picketed the President
The Californians for Peace in Viet
Nam represents faculty members tak
ing part in the protest. Formerly the
professors were also known as the
Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
Nam, but changed the name of the or
ganizaton to prevent any seeming
association with the University. This
is the same group that picketed Pr esi
dent Johnson when he visited San
Francisco in June.
The function of the workshops will
be to collect signatures on a faculty
sponsored petition demanding an end
to the bombings in North Viet Nam
and urging the recognition of the Na
tional Liberation Front as an inde
pendent bargaining agent. Members
of the SCPV 7 " will also be writing and
researching leaflets and collecting
money for political advertisements.
March on Paly
The demonstrations will come to an
end Saturday morning. Members of
the SCPV and the CPV plan to march
from White Memorial Plaza to Cogs
well Plaza in Palo Alto. There they
will join a rally staged by the con
cerned Citizens of Palo Alto, and
later complete the peace march
through Palo Alto and the Stanford
Shopping Center.
A similar march is planned by the
Viet Nam Day Committee of Berke
ley. The group will parade through
the Oakland Army Terminal.
Other activities during the four-day
protest at Stanford include a panel
presentation in Cubberley Auditor
ium. "Viet Nam A Matter of Con
science." Participants are Amitai El
zioni of Columbia, Brice Franklin of
