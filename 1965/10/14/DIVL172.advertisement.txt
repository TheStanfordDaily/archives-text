More to Life Than Meets the Eye
The words "The just shall live by faith," found in the Old Testament (Habakkuk 2:4)
and quoted in Romans (1:16,1) brought Martin Luther to accept and receive Jesus Christ
as his personal Savior in the winler of 1512.
To many, the word "faith" means "I hope God is real, but I'm not sure." But faith
as the Bible uses the term means trust, reliance, and daily dependence on the actual and
living Lord, Jesus Christ. Every individual who would know God must first take a step
"in faith," as Martin Luther did, claiming Jesus Christ as personal Redeemer and Lord.
God always responds to those who seek to know Him personally, so that believers in
Christ are those who have no doubt whatsoever about the reality of their personal rela
tionship to Him. "Draw near to God and He will draw near to you" (James 4:8).
The Bible contrasts "sight," which is depending on natural reason and sensory inputs,
with "faith," which is depending on God and what He has said in the Bible. "Without faith
it isimpossible to please God, for he that comes to God must believe that He is and
that He rewards those who diligently seek Him (Hebrews 11:6).
Temporarily, at least, faith may ignore the evidence of the senses, the emotions, and
natural reasoning in order to press for nnswers from God who is the Source of all
things. . . we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen;
for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal" (2
Corinthians 4:16, 17).
It may seem to some that faith in God is "blind faith," but such is not the case.
Rather, the limited vision brought by man's senses and human reasoning is subordinated
to a deeper way of seeing all of life through the eyes of faith. "Faith is the assurance of
things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen .. . by faith we understand that the
world was created by the Word of God, so that what is seen was made out of things
which do not appear" (Hebrews 11:1-3).
Faith in the God of the Bible is something which really works, something which brings
broader and deeper answers to the meaning of life. Because faith works in experience,
and because God demonstrates Himself to the satisfaction of any individual who wants
1o get acquainted with Him, why not find out for yourself by inviting Jesus Christ into
your life today?
