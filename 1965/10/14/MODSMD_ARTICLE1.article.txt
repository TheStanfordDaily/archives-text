• (.astro May Release Prisoners
KEY WEST, Fla. — Braving angry seas in
small craft, 102 more Cubans crossed the
Florida Straits yesterday before bad weather
temporarily stopped the flow.
At the same time, a possibility arose that
Fidel Castro might set free tens of thousands
of political prisoners who are in jail because
they oppose his regime.
The State Department said Castro had re
plied to a U.S. program for massive exodus
without flatly turning down a proposal that
the prisoners be among the first to leave.
Estimates of the number of political pris
oners behind bars run from 30,000 to 75,000.
Two Coast Guard cutters brought in the
bulk of the tired wet and often seasick refug
ees. They started out in small boats from
Camarioca but were taken off when surging
seas threatened their rickety boats.
In Washington, State Department press

officer Marshall Wright said Castro's reply
to the latest U.S. note on moving thousands
of refugees from their homeland to the United
States was "positive in some respects" and
"left the door open for further negotiations."
