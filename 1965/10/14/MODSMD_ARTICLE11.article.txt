# DECIDER TODAY
## Twins Even-Up Series 
### Associated Press 
MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL —
Jim (Mudcat) Grant, pitching
with only two days rest, squared
the World Series for the Minne
sota Twins Wednesday by hurl
ing a six-hitter and belting a
three-run homer in a 5-1 sixth
game victory over the Los An
geles Dodgers.
Grant's triumph, the Twins'
third in three games at Metro
politan Stadium alter losing
three straight in Los Angelos
threw the Series into a decisive
seventh gamp Thursday. So far,
it has been a home park series.
Bob Allison's two-run homer
off Claude Osteon in the fourth
gave the muscular Grant the
margin he needed. Then he
came up in the sixth with two
on and blasted Howie Reed's
first pitch into the left field
stands.
A record crowd of 19.578 rose
in a thunderous ovation to
Grant, the 21-game winner, as
he trotted home. Grant was the
first pitcher to hit a homer in
the Series since Lew Burdette
did it for Milwaukee, Oct. 2.
19.")8. It was the first by an
American League pitcher since
old Jim Bagby for Cleveland
in 1920.
Fairly's seventh-inning home
run ruined Grant's bid for a
shutout, but the big fellow never
faltered.
Jinx Snapped
Osteon, who never before had
lost to the Twins in his days

with Washington and Ihe Dodg
ers, finally dropped his first de
cision to the Minnesota sluggers
after beating ihem six times.
The Twins started out making
life miserable for Osteen in the
very first Inning when Zoilo
Versalles led off with a single.
ITe was erased on Joe Nossek's
double play, hut. Tony Oliva
kept the water hoiling with a
single to left.
Diek Tracewski, playing see
ond for the injured .Tim
Lefebvre, messed up Battey's
leadoff grounder in the fourth.
Allison, who had struck out ear
lier and had only one hit in 10
trips ripped into Osteon's third
pitch and drove it into the lower
pavilion in left for Ihe two-run
homer thai really won the hall
game.
Grant Great
Grant was in command all the
way. The Dodgers never got a
chance to use the speed that
practically ran the Twins out of
the park in Los Angeles.
The second guessers will have
a field day with Waller Alston,
Dodger manager, lor his move
in walking the weak-hitting
rookie Quilici in the sixth to
pitch to Grant.
Parker had marie a superb
play to throw out leadoff man
Bat toy in the sixth, but Allison
walked. Reed, who had just re
placed Osteen at the start of the |
inning, curled a third strike past I
Don Mineher.
Alston ordered Reed to give
Quilici a free ticket to first, set

MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL —
Jim (Mudcat) Grant, pitching
with only two days rest, squared
the World Series for the Minne
sota Twins Wednesday by hurl
ing a six-hitter and belting a
three-run homer in a 5-1 sixth
game victory over the Los An
geles Dodgers.
Grant's triumph, the Twins'
third in three games at Metro
politan Stadium alter losing
three straight in Los Angelos
threw the Series into a decisive
seventh gamp Thursday. So far,
it has been a home park series.
Bob Allison's two-run homer
off Claude Osteon in the fourth
gave the muscular Grant the
margin he needed. Then he
came up in the sixth with two
on and blasted Howie Reed's
first pitch into the left field
stands.
A record crowd of 19.578 rose
in a thunderous ovation to
Grant, the 21-game winner, as
he trotted home. Grant was the
first pitcher to hit a homer in
the Series since Lew Burdette
did it for Milwaukee, Oct. 2.
19.")8. It was the first by an
American League pitcher since
old Jim Bagby for Cleveland
in 1920.
Fairly's seventh-inning home
run ruined Grant's bid for a
shutout, but the big fellow never
faltered.
Jinx Snapped
Osteon, who never before had
lost to the Twins in his days

with Washington and Ihe Dodg
ers, finally dropped his first de
cision to the Minnesota sluggers
after beating ihem six times.
The Twins started out making
life miserable for Osteen in the
very first Inning when Zoilo
Versalles led off with a single.
ITe was erased on Joe Nossek's
double play, hut. Tony Oliva
kept the water hoiling with a
single to left.
Diek Tracewski, playing see
ond for the injured .Tim
Lefebvre, messed up Battey's
leadoff grounder in the fourth.
Allison, who had struck out ear
lier and had only one hit in 10
trips ripped into Osteon's third
pitch and drove it into the lower

homer thai really won the hall
