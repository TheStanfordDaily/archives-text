## LASSU Action Ripped By Rep 
### 
Editor, the Daily:
Any similarity between the
LASSU meeting I attended last
Thursday night and the one you
reported in the paper Friday
morning is purely coincidental.
Your article implied that the
legislature acted with a measure
of thought and reflection. Re
grettably, those most necessary
ingredients to the democratic
process were conspicuously lack
ing, especially in regard to the
student nominees for the Presi
dential Advisory Committees
and the appointments to the
Rules Committee.
There was virtually no debate
or discussion. Instead, the Speak
er's committee selections—some
of whom are not even elected
members of LASSU — were per
functorily approved.
Since many of the new mem
bers of the legislature, myself
included, were unfamiliar with
most of the nominees, it was a
travesty of the democratic proc
ess to ask us to m;ike a ratifica
tion at that time.
Mr. Kadane is apparently
more interested in having his
friends placed on committees
than in maintaining even a ves
tige of representative govern
ment.

• Revolutionary Fever
Editor, The Daily:
In yesterday's Daily Mr.
Drachkovich writes: "Nothing
woul ignite the brushfires of
'n a t i on a 1 liberation wars'
throughout the world better
than a Viet Cong victory
in South Vietnam!' I happen
to have some training in Marx
ism and this allows me to point
out one hidden truth in Mr.
Drachkovich's reasoning. He
admits by implication that there
exists what Marxism calls "rev
olutionary situation" through
out the world; i.e.: poverty and
misery. I do not see how the
U.S. plans to solve this prob
lem by winning in Vietnam.

• Gen. Taylor Defended
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Anton's letter giving "rea
sons" justifying discourtesy to
General Taylor (he thought that
Taylor's remarks were irrelev
ant) betray a tactical error on

thc part of some who protest
the Vietnam war.
The motive for protest of the
war is not to call attention to
the problem (as has been the
case in many civil rights dem
onstrations). Rather, it is to pre
sent alternative solutions to it
and to gather support for them.
Taylor is indeed a salesman.
Our officials make decisions
knowing that they will have to
"sell" their reasoning to the
American public. Their confron
tation with dissident opinion is
what yields long-term policy.
Similarly, those who protest
the war are trying to "sell" a
different viewpoint. To bait and
to insult General Taylor is bad
salesmanship.

• Poster Paper Funds
Editor, The Daily:
A complaint to voice! It seems
that Stanford students are with
out the necessary funds to pur
chase their own poster paper,
and/or the artistic talent to
create designs thereon. Namely
- posters advertising the com
ing production of "The No
Man's Child" by student John
Binkley have mysteriously dis
appeared from their places on
the kiosks around campus. Yes,
they are aesthetically pleasing
to the eye—but if there's a lack
of aesthetic pleasure , a viewing
of the production itself would
be much more effective and ap
preciated.

• Yea Squirrels, Pell
Editor, The Daily
How can I describe the thrill:
of delight that swept the Roble j
Dining Room this morning at
breakfast when we read Mr. '
Fender's letter? At long last, an |
end to senseless brutal savag
ery. Firearms are an unpleasant
reminder of our pioneer heri
tage, and besides, are cruel and
nasty per squirrels and other in
offensive creatures.
I write this letter in order to |
inform Mr. Fender that there is :
a solid corps of Roble girls be- j
hind him and his noble crusade, i
Fight on, Pell!
