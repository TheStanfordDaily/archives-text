## Feelers For Peace Permeate UN Discussions Of Vietnam 
### 
If one had to say what is the
most important function of the
United Nations today, the ans
wer would he, I think, that it
provides a meeting place where
men who have firsthand know
ledge of the issues can talk pri
vately. In these talks today the
war in Vietnam is under contin
ual discussion, and the discuss
ions are carried on by men who
are in direct contact themselves
or through their agents with
Washington and Peking and
Moscow, with Saigon and Hanoi.
The best that can be said at
the present moment is that
while there has been no discern
ible progress toward a cease
lire, the lines of communica
tion have not been broken. They
are, in fact, sufficiently open
to reveal in very dim outline
where lie the major obstacles
to a negotiated end of the war.
Far East Boundaries
The obstacles are primarily in
the conflict between Peking and
Washington about where the
boundary of their military and
political power is to be drawn
in the Far East. The grand ob
jective of Peking is to expel, or
at least to neutralize and erode,
the American position in Japan,
Korea, Formosa, Indo-China, the
Philippines and Indonesia. The
most promising way to do this is
to keep the Americans in Indo-

China fighting not Chinese, but
Vietnamese. As a matter of
course, Peking is using all its
power and influence in Hanoi
to prevent a truce and to keep
the war going.
The Chinese objective is not,
however, identical with the vital
interests of Hanoi. That funda
mental conclusion transpires
from what is being said in the
corridors of the United Nations.
It is the difference between the
vital interests of Peking and of
Hanoi that contains the seed of
whatever hope there is of a
cease-fire and a negotiated set
tlement.
The vital interests of Hanoi
would best be served by a settle
ment neutralizing the whole of
Indo-China and along with it.
it might well be, Burma and
Malaysia. Such a bloc of neutral
ized states, guaranteed by the
great powers, would be in the in
terests of all of them. For their
interest is to be independent of
and not at war with the great
military powers.
There are some reasons to
think that such a settlement,
which seemed more possible in
1964 than it does at the moment,
is nevertheless still a settlement
to which the peoples of the reg
ion would readily adhere if they
could find a way to reach it.
On the face of the record, at

least, President Johnson is com
mitted to look favorably upon
the search for this kind of set
tlement. That is to say, a settle
ment which brings into exist
ence a group of independent na
tions not under Red China's
military domination nor under
ours. But a candid and tough
minded view of tho President's
position must be, 1 think, that
in the next few months he will
face another crisis in the con
duct of the war which may be
his first severe test.
The American news reports
which tell of the power of our
offensive attacks are, we should
realize, building up a popular
expectation of an end to the war
by an American victory. If and
when no victory comes of all
this and the war goes on, the
President will be exhorted to put
an end to the war by some
really decisive blows. The propa
ganda for this new escalation
is already being tried out:.
The Coming Ordeal
Toward the turn of the year
the President will probably have
to face his ordeal the making
of the decision whether to en
gage in a total war in Vietnam
or to work for a tentative and
precarious peace. The argument
for a huge war will be carried
along by the glittering promise
of a glorious victory, a victory,
moreover, won almost entirely
by using professional troops.
The search for a tentative and
precarious peace would, on the
contrary, require him to sur
render some of his very consid
erable pride, and it would re
quire him to face the attack of
his Republican critics.
The only compensation for
this would be the enormous
benefit, beyond the end of the
killing, which peace in South
east Asia would confer on all
the nations.
For the war in Vietnam is
blocking the progress of the na
tions, including that of Red
China itself, toward the peace
able coexistence and accomoda
tion. which is the predominant
need of all the peoples.
