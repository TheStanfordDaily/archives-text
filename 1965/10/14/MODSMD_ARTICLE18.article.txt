By PROFESSOR JOHN RUE
The development of the Sino-
Soviet Rift has great signifi
cance in any consideration of
American policy toward Viet
nam. The renewal of the war in
South Vietnam and the organi
zation of the National Libera
the factors contributing to the
tion Front probably were among
split between the two great
Communist powers. Peking and
Moscow are still divided over

policy toward the war in Viet
nam.
Everyone recognizes that the
world Communist movement is
no longer the monolithic entity
it was in Stalin's day. Khrush
chev's denunciation of Stalin's
crimes compelled many com
munist leaders to consider the
advantages of polycentrie or
pluralistic communism. In the
new era, many parties have
taken initiatives without prior
consultation with either Moscow
or Peking. Since 1956. the lead
ers in Peking and Moscow have
opted for two different strate
gies or techniques of seizing

power. Thus the non-ruling par
lies have a choice. To choose,
however, means to take sides.
Only those parties too small and
ineffectual to struggle can be
entirely neutral.
Escalation Prevented
In the years since 1936, the
Chinese Communists have insist
ed that national-liberation wars
are desirable, that communist
parties in colonial and former
colonial areas can use the tech
niques of guerrilla war invented
by the Chinese Communist lead
ers to surround and isolate the
last remaining bastions of im
perialist power, and, that with
careful prudent management,
escalation of local wars into
global nuclear conflict can be
prevented.
Both Khrushchev and his suc
cessors fear that national-liber
ation wars will not remain local
wars: the danger of escalation
is always present. Therefore out
right military struggles should
give way to political and eco
nomic competition between the
two systems. The Russians do
not seem to want a sudden in
crease in the number of indus
trially underdeveloped commun
ist states with low standards of
living. Rapid increases in aid to
poor communist states threat
ens the rising standard of living
in the Soviet Union.
I.\l><'ration Inevitable
Khrushchev and his success
ors prefer, I believe, to place the
burden of developing an indus
trial economy in Africa and Asia
on the capitalist system where,
according to traditional Marxist
theory, it rightfully belongs.
Therefore they probably have no
great desire to include South
Vietnam in their orbit if that
will slow the growth of a con
sumption economy in the Soviet
Union. Goulash Communism is
now the goal. That goal takes
precedence over assisting com
munist parties in former colon
ies to seize power.
Khrushchev's hesitation to
support a renewed guerrilla war
and the organization of the Na
tional Liberation Front began
to emerge soon after the NFL
was organized in Dec., 1960.
On January 6. 1961, in a speech
to the Institute of Marxism-
Leninism in Moscow, lie made a
careful distinction between local
wars between national states
which must be prevented and
national liberation wars which
the Soviet Union would support.
He limited the meaning of na
tional-liberation wars to wars
for independence in colonies:
these were, in his words, "not
only admissable but inevitable."
Turning to the subject of Viet-,,
nam hp said, "How was it lhat w
the U.S. imperialists, while
wanting to help the French col
onialists in every way, neverthe
less decided against direct inter
vention in the war in Vietnam?
They did not intervene because
they knew that if they helped
France with armed force Viet
nam would get appropriate aid
from China, the Soviet Union,
and other socialist countries,

which could lead to a world war.
The outcome of the war is
known. North Vietnam won."
(Khrushchev's speech before the
Institute of Marxism-Leninism
in Moscow, January 6, 19(il.)
The war in Vietnam, then, was
finished.
I It was a successful example ol
the application of Khrushchev's
preventing escalation. He did not
mention the renewed activity in
South Vietnam or the Pathet
Lao. Why? Probably because he
did not believe that the Soviet
Union should tempt the United
States to intervene on a larger
scale by giving active and public
support of the guerrilla fighters.
Treaty Negotiated
His view of the dangers of
escalation became even more
clear when, through active col
laboration between the United
States and the Soviet Union, the
treaty guaranteeing the neutral
ity and independence of Laos
was negotiated in 19(52; a treaty
to which both the United States
and the People's Republic of
China appended their signatures.
If neutralist and non-communist
forces had been strong enough
then, a similar agreement mighl
have been negotiated for South
Vietnam. The Diem government,
however, had destroyed the po
tentially neutralist armies of the
religious sects.
By 19G2, large numbers of in
dividuals and organizations from
Ambassador Lodge and the CIA
through the Buddhists clergy to
the Vietcong believed that Diem
must go. The following year the
Diem brothers were assassin
ated. Since that time the Gov
ernment of the United States
has been committed to uphold
government by military cliques
and, inadvertently or otherwise,
has successfully prevented the
growth of viable political altern
atives. The political situation
polarized, the war was escalated
and North Vietnam bombed.
None Will Remain
The problem for tlie NFL is
not simple: Are they willing to
follow Ho Chi-minh no matter
who Ho follows? Oi' are they
ready to take an initiative of
their own, throw themselves
into the arms of the Chinese,
and embark on a protracted
war? Under the circumstances,
Lin Piao can only offer them a
war which will not be won until
most of the present generation
is dead. Therefore, perhaps the
NFL will be willing to negotiate
even with the United States. Re
cent reports indicate that they
may even now be ready. Bomb
ing North Vietnam is no longer
necessary to force the NFL to
the conference table.
Unfortunately for the Chinese
theory of guerrilla war, the dis
parity between the strength and
size of the United States and
Vietnam is so great that in pro
tracted war lasting for ten or
twenty more years, we could
kill all the people of both North
and South Vietnam. Then there
will be no longer anyone to fight
and 110 enemy will remain to
surrender and to make peace.
