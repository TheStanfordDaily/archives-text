# Peace Corps Political Role Examined
## Satin Discusses Dominican Crisis 
### 
Robert Satin, Dominican Republic
Peace Corps Director, offered the
Peace Corps as the means to "develop
human resources," even in such vola
tile situations as the recent Domini
can crisis.
Satin emphasized that he is "aw
fully proud of the way the Peace
Corps came through." Throughout the
many changes in the Dominican po
litical situation, volunteers remained
on the job.
One volunteer was asked by rebels
whom he had worked with to join the
rebel fight. lie refused, saying, "a
Dominican problem requires a Do
minican solution." Peace Corps volun
teers tried to maintain neutrality
throughout the crisis.
Neutrality
Human tragedy is not spared vol
unteers, Satin said. Corpsmen aided
in the rescue of an American marine
wounded by gunfire, and cared for by
a Dominican family.
The following day, the Peace Corps
returned to offer food to the family,
but discovered a child had been killed
by shrapnel, and the mother injured.
The Peace Corps is still in the Do
minican Republic because it remained
neutral. "The minute the Peace Corps
becomes a source of political alliance,
we're through," said Satin, adding,
"The label 'spy' sticks."
( hanging Attitudes
Satin feels the purpose of the Peace
Corps is "to develop human resourc
es." Building schoolhouses is neces
sary, but more important is changing
the attitudes of the people.
'The poverty stricken people have
t heir transistor radios, and want other
things now." The rich are not hidden
from view. The problem is to solve
the "economic and social desires of
the people," said Satin.
"Most college students don't want
us," he said, explaining that "if the
Peace Corps has been a failure, it has
been so in America." Students discov
er the Corps means "getting shot at
aceasionally and getting dysentary."
Returnees
Returning volunteers are often dis
illusioned with job opportunities in
the stales. Satin said, "A 23-year old
who has been actively participating in
a town council, can not come back and
demand a job on the Board of Direc
tors of Bell Telephone."
Peace Corps Week continues with a
slide show at 7:30 p.m. tonight in Tie
sidder. The slides are by returnees
now studying at Stanford.

Returning volunteers are often dis
illusioned with job opportunities in
the stales. Satin said, "A 23-year old
who has been actively participating in
a town council, can not come back and
demand a job on the Board of Direc
tors of Bell Telephone."
Peace Corps Week continues with a
slide show at 7:30 p.m. tonight in Tie
sidder. The slides are by returnees
now studying at Stanford.
Robert Satin, Dominican Republic
Peace Corps Director, offered the
Peace Corps as the means to "develop
human resources," even in such vola
tile situations as the recent Domini
can crisis.
Satin emphasized that he is "aw
fully proud of the way the Peace
Corps came through." Throughout the
many changes in the Dominican po
litical situation, volunteers remained
on the job.
One volunteer was asked by rebels
whom he had worked with to join the
rebel fight. lie refused, saying, "a
Dominican problem requires a Do
minican solution." Peace Corps volun
teers tried to maintain neutrality
throughout the crisis.
Neutrality
Human tragedy is not spared vol
unteers, Satin said. Corpsmen aided
in the rescue of an American marine
wounded by gunfire, and cared for by
a Dominican family.
The following day, the Peace Corps
returned to offer food to the family,
but discovered a child had been killed
by shrapnel, and the mother injured.
The Peace Corps is still in the Do
minican Republic because it remained
neutral. "The minute the Peace Corps
becomes a source of political alliance,
we're through," said Satin, adding,
"The label 'spy' sticks."
( hanging Attitudes
Satin feels the purpose of the Peace
Corps is "to develop human resourc
es." Building schoolhouses is neces
sary, but more important is changing
the attitudes of the people.
'The poverty stricken people have
t heir transistor radios, and want other
things now." The rich are not hidden
from view. The problem is to solve
the "economic and social desires of
the people," said Satin.
"Most college students don't want
us," he said, explaining that "if the
Peace Corps has been a failure, it has
been so in America." Students discov
er the Corps means "getting shot at
aceasionally and getting dysentary."
