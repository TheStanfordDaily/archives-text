# SAFARI INTO SATIRE
## Armour Defends Wit 
### 
Dr. Richard Armour, sell-proclaimed "Poet Laureate of the Cow" in
Jamaica, lectured last night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on "A Safari into
Satire."
While serving the state department abroad, he softened a Jamaican audi
ence by quoting some if his light verse on cows.

Last night, as Stern Hall's Guest.-
in-Kesidenee lecturer, he quoted this
verse and, many others of his own,
while demonstrating what satire is
and how it functions.
Currently featured in both "Play
boy" and "Good Housekeeping" maga
zines, the noted satirist, in addition
to having a full schedule of lectures is
working on three books for publica
tion.
Posing the question of what satire
is, lie answered it by calling it a spec
ial form of humor.
It is absurdly loking at the serious
and seriously looking at the absurd,
mixed with exaggeration and an ele
ment of surprise. " The American
newspaper only begins to be useful
after it. is read if you have a canary
or something."
Satire serves the social function of
bringing dictators and demagogues to
a human level. People should regard
political leaders without awe, and
political leaders should view them
selves likewise.
Scripps professor for thirty-seven
years. Armour began writing serious
ly. then turned to satire. Since 1935.
he has turned out thirty satirical
works.
His subject matter is human beings
and universal subjects - money, sex,
adolescence. Ho writes a poem on mar
riage titled "What You Don't Know
Won't Hurt You Until Later," and
sums it up:
When you do get a view
Of Your true love that's true
Your're in for a hell of a shock.
He demonstrates his method of
writing by illustrating from his work,
It All Started Willi Columbus. He
always attempts to carry the true to
a level just beyond.
110 listed his academic credits as:

8.A., C.D.. E.F.
His multiple choice questions lead:
"Why do you think Columbus was
interested in traveling to distant
places? What else do you know about
his home life?"
Thus he tries to deflate the image
of the readers, the teachers, and the
historians.
A note of interest. Civ is spelled,
s-i-e-v-e.


"I became known as the neighborhood Mort Sahl," explained I>r. Richard

spiel Auditorium.
