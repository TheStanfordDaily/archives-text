# Fraternity Council Rejects Part of Unified Rush Plan
## 
### MICHAEL ROSTER Associate Editor 
The interfratemity Council (IFC<
last night rejected major portions ol
rush proposals drawn tip last year by
an ad hoc committee.
Dave Bell, president of the eating
club council, said he felt the 1 IPC's
action would have no effect on a pos
sible unified rush program.
"Our hopes are still high for a com
munity-wide rush policy," Bell said.
Stern President Ray Colby expressed
a similar view.
Fraternity representatives first
voted down a proposed appeals coun
cil that would be empowered to re
view all rush violations. To set up
such an appeals council, delegates
said, would be to duplicate already ex
isting judicial bodies.
Then, in a very close vote of 21-20.
members sent all proposals affecting
bids to a committee for discussion and
review.
IPC President Rob Freeman com
mented that there are many problems
"that were brought up in our meet
ing thatare inherent in a written bid
system.
"The IPC feels certain revisions
would be beneficial to the freshmen
and to the fraternities," Freeman said.
Kushees Might Suffer
The resolution that sent all bid pro
posals to committee noted that the
IPC is in favor "of the spirit of the
proposed rush policy but will make
revisions in specific areas."
Fraternity representatives felt
many freshmen who rush late or
somehow are not ready for a bid right
away would lose out if the rush pro
cess "came to a halt" for a week after
bids were mailed.

Hay Colby, IHC president, said the
Stern council would favor an appeals
board but felt mild dissatisfaction
with the bidding system. Colby said
there should be a longer period of
time when fraternity men are banned
from Wilbur.
"A pressure - bidding situation
should be avoided," Colby said.
'Freshmen should have a chance for
an objective and sober decision."
The IFC was the first of several
living group councils to discuss the
rush system before it can be adopted.
Spokesmen for the eating clubs and
Stern houses said their councils <ICC
and IHC) would open discussion next
Monday.
The proposals that the upperclass
men's living groups are now review
ing were recommended informally by
a nine-member ad hoc committee. The
committee was established last win
ter with the recommendations of the
IFC. ICC. and IHC presidents and Wil
bur sponsors.
Living (iroups Approve
Chaired by Prof. John Steward, the

ad hoc commit tee mot with the Jiving
group heads after discussing rush
policy at eight meetings held spring
quarter. The living group represen
tatives reportedly approved the rush
policy that the committee had de
vised.
Areas covered by the ad hoc com
mittee were rush publications, meth
ods of sending bids, restrictions on
contact between freshmen and upper
classmen. and enforcement of rush
regulations.
The committee's recommendations
included provisions that:
• Two university-subsidized rush
publications should be written cover
ing all aspects of rush. (In the past,
each living group presented its own
rush booklet.)
• Freshmen contact with living
group representatives should be lim
ited to certain times and places. Con
tact in Wilbur especially should be
limited.
• Violations of rush regulations
should be tried by living group judi
cial councils but subject to appeal and
review by a student-faculty board.
