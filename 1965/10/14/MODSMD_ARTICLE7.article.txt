# Peace Speakers Launch Vietnam Protest; Oratory Precedes White Plaza Camp-in
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
Four speakers last night launched
a protest here against the Vietnam
War into full gear.
The protest sponsored by the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Vietnam,
will continue non-stop on campus un
til Saturday afternoon when the par
ticipants will march to Palo Alto for
a mass meeting.
The speakers argued vigorously
against United States participation in
the War before an attentive crowd of

2(H) in Cubberly Auditorium.
Benjamin Seaver, peace education
secretary of the American Field Serv
ice Committee, San Francisco, re
jected the notion that the communists
arc a "monolithic, subhuman or su
perhuman power."
Asserting that the United States
actions are a "beautiful example" of
power policy immorality, Seaver
maintained that it "wouldn't work
anyway." He said the United States
actions were forcing the Asian na
tions into the hand of the Chinese.

"We have to destroy the poison
that anti-communism has left in the
American mind that sees it as the
devil. When you are fighting the devil,
you can use whatever devilish means
you want and feel justified."
Marshall Windmillcr, associate pro
fessor of international relations at
San Francisco Slate College, warned
that the United States may be guilty
of "war crimes" in Vietnam.
Me also cautioned against looking
at the war in technical terms, in terms
of "better heliocopters."
"We are losing sight not only of
the political aspects of the war but
also of some of these moral and legal
questions which have been central to
our ideological commitment for many
years."
Support Not Needed
Concentrating on Hie political as
pects, Amilai Etzioni, Columbia Uni
versity professor of sociology, said
there was no proof that Vietnam need
ed our support to remain independent.
"The picture that those yellow
hoardes are ready to run down the
mountain if we are not there is .just
not right."
According to Etzieni, if we lease the
Vietnamese free to pursue their.own
national interests, "the last thing
they would do would be to crawl
under the Chinese umbrella."
I Ma/a Vigil
Bruce Franklin of the Stanford
English Department criticized the
United States policy because "we can
not put the other people of the world
in a bed of hot lava and use them as
stepping stones in order to assure our
own stability."
Following the program last night,
protesters began setting up camp in
White Memorial Plaza for a 60-hour
vigil to be conducted in connection
with the International Days of Pro
test, a program in some t><> United
States cities and several other coun
trys in opposition to the Vietnam
War.
During class hours <>n Thursday and
Friday, an open forum will be- held at
the site near Memorial Claw for dis
cussion and debate.
