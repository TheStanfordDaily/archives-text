Nguyen Vinh Due, also a medical stu
dent, is Vice Chairman of the Saigon
University Political Union. Dang Van
Thu. a (bird year Law student, is Vice
President of llie Anti-Corruption
Youth Federation.
Their trip is a partial result of a
similar trip made to Vietnam last
summer by six American students.
These six. who are now hosting the
Vietnamese students, spent six weeks
tourim: Vietnam and meeting Viet

namese students.
Malcolm Donald, one of the six who
toured Vietnam, and spokesman for
both groups, suid that many students
in Vietnam feel that their activities
and attitudes are misunderstood and
that exposure of this kind, would dis
pell these misunderstandings and pro
mote closer relations between stu
dents in the two countries.
Donald s;iid that Saigon is "one of
the freest political climates I've been
in.'' and said that Vietnamese students
"are warm, bright people." He added
that although "there are as many
opinions as there are students in Viet
nam. most seem to have their feet
on the ground," and are more prac
tical than the average U.S. student
is inclined to expect.
The Vietnamese students were at
Cal on Wednesday. They will be at
Stanford today only, and expect to
visit Foothill College and San Jose
State before the end ol the week.
