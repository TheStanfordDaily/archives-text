Because it looks better from the front.
The point of the tic always stays centered, the edges always neat. The authoritative look of
these Resilio clubs is richly deserved . . . each is an authentic British club insignia woven into
the finest imported silk repp. Discreet and well-bred tie for the truly traditional wardrobe.
Resilio Ties at knowledgeable retailers, or write Resilio, Empire State Building, New York City.
P.S. All Resilio Traditional ties have a medallion on the back.
