POLARIZED PEOPLE
Outward appearances can be deceiving, for people can be polarizfd Religion must
b» more than skin deep, for The Lord tees no! as man sees man looks upon the
outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart' (1 Samuel 16 7). Jesus Christ
said, "What comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a man.
For out of the heart come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, murder, adultery, coveting,
wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness All these evil things
come from within, and they defile a man" IMatthew 15:17-20).
Jesus Christ reserved His strongest words of rebuke and condemnat on for the religious
hypocrites of His day, for these men were outwardly extremely religious but inwardly
depraved. They constantly misled others who were seeking knowledge of God Mincing no
words Jesus Cnrist told a crowd of Pharisees thay were like whitewashed tombs, which
outwardly appear beautiful, but wirtiin are filled with dead men s bones and all unclean
ness . . . outwardly appearing righteous to man, but within full of hypocrisy and iniq
uity (Matthew 23:27-28).
Don't be deceived by polarized people. God is a Person you tan know in your own
life and expenence. The world is full of religious people but God requires a changed
heart, his occurs when any individual personally rceives or accepts Jesus Chnst as Lord
and Savior.
Outward appearances don't count with God, only the inner realiiy of a changed heart
and on indwelling Redeemer who says, I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you
shall be clean from all your uncleanness, and from all your idols I will cleanse you. A
new heart I will give you,- arid I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give
you a heart of flesh' (Ezekial 36: 25-27).
Have you let Jesus Christ change your heart?
