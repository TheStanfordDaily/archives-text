# Grad Student Works To Modernize Vietnam Outlook
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
"When we move into a Vietnamese village,
we try to instill a sense of social responsibility
in tlie people. The average Vietnamese is polit
ically inert; his horizons extend no further
than his family or clan. We are trying to
change his outlook."
That was the way Rensselaer Lee, Stanford
graduate student, described hLs activities in
Vietnam this past summer. Lee did community
development work for International Voluntary
Service, Inc. The group is a private organiza
tion under contract to the Agency for Inter
national Development (AID).
Vietnam is presently undergoing moderiza
tion — not a mechanical revolution, but a
change in the way of life brought by agarian
reforms, increased education, and ultimately
the development of national unity in the
people. "If Vietnam is to modernize, we would
rather stimulate it instead of letting the Com
munists," Lee said.

(Community Development
Lee worked with students in the port town
of Nha-Trang in tlie central region of Soutli
Vietnam and taught English to several groups.
The interests of the present intellectual group,
according to Lee, is far removed from the
needs of the people and of the nation. In an
attempt to create some concern among the
Vietnamese for their own development prob
lems, Lee worked with young intellectuals in
rural projects.
Community development work done by the
International Voluntary Service is quite sim
ilar to the role of the Peace Corps in other
emerging nations. The IVS is in a better posi
tion to help the Vietnamese that the Peace
Corps because of its private status in a land
strewn with distrust.
The strength of the Viet Cong has been
greatly overestimated, Lee observed. "The
people accept the Viet Cong because they pro
vide a material life better than existed before,

or because they are forced to accept them."
Social Responsibility
The strategy of the Viet Cong is the same
proposed by Mao TseTung, to build social re
sponsibility. The great problem in Vietnamese
society today is the failure of the people to
see beyond their private problems.
In China the situation is just the opposite,
Lee noted. "It is not uncommon for an intel
lectual to spend three months a year in the
field with the peasants. In that way the
Chinese intellectual relates to all the people
and develops a sense of social responsibility."
Lee described the difficulties in getting the
Vietnamese to break down his particularistic
outlook on the community. "Development
work is not charity — we help them to help
themselves," he said.
Vietnamese Counterpart
When a group moves into a village it is ac
companied by Vietnamese who form a native
counterpart. Progress is only made through
a delicate balance of persuasion and under

standing. Such projects as roads, malaria erad
ication, and education are started by the IVP
people with the help of Vietnamese outsiders.
"If you push them too hard, they won't do
a thing or they will find a way to foul you
up. But if you don't encourage the villagers
to look beyond themselves they won't do any
thing," Lee said.
Vietnam today is in a pre-political stage. The
average villager has no contact with Saigon
and is not immensly concerned about the war,
Lee noted. The goal of development programs
is to prepare the nation for tlie day when it
can govern itself, by giving the people a sense
of social responsibility.
I Was The U.S.
Securing Vietnam, Lee pointed out, means
more than pushing tlie Viet Cong back into the
hills.
Commenting on the attitude of the people
toward the United States, the Stanford student
said, "In my region I was the United States."
The villagers knew of America only from per

sonal contacts, but Li-e noted that most were
glad that the United States was in their coun
try.
' He estimated that it would take another
six to seven years to "secure" the country.
Lee pointed out that once the people had gain
ed a concern for the problems of their nation,
there was no guarantee that a democratic
government would be the result. However, in
areas in which community development work
had been successfully completed, the people no
longer saw a chance for a better life from the
Viet Cong and consequently rejected their ef
forts to return.
Distortion of the war effort in the American
press Lee maintained, has led to a false im
pression about Vietnam both for the Ameri
can public and for many officials in Washing
ton."The newsmen are looking for hot news,
coups d'etats, Saigon bombings, student dem
onstrations and so on. But they fail to report
the nature of the people and our work in the
field," he said.

munists," Lee said.

(Community Development
Lee worked with students in the port town
of Nha-Trang in tlie central region of Soutli
Vietnam and taught English to several groups.
The interests of the present intellectual group,
according to Lee, is far removed from the
needs of the people and of the nation. In an
attempt to create some concern among the
Vietnamese for their own development prob
lems, Lee worked with young intellectuals in
rural projects.
Community development work done by the
International Voluntary Service is quite sim
ilar to the role of the Peace Corps in other
emerging nations. The IVS is in a better posi
tion to help the Vietnamese that the Peace
Corps because of its private status in a land
strewn with distrust.
The strength of the Viet Cong has been
greatly overestimated, Lee observed. "The
people accept the Viet Cong because they pro
vide a material life better than existed before,

or because they are forced to accept them."
Social Responsibility
The strategy of the Viet Cong is the same
proposed by Mao TseTung, to build social re
sponsibility. The great problem in Vietnamese
society today is the failure of the people to
see beyond their private problems.
In China the situation is just the opposite,
Lee noted. "It is not uncommon for an intel
lectual to spend three months a year in the
field with the peasants. In that way the
Chinese intellectual relates to all the people
and develops a sense of social responsibility."
Lee described the difficulties in getting the
Vietnamese to break down his particularistic
outlook on the community. "Development
work is not charity — we help them to help
themselves," he said.
Vietnamese Counterpart
When a group moves into a village it is ac
companied by Vietnamese who form a native
counterpart. Progress is only made through
a delicate balance of persuasion and under

standing. Such projects as roads, malaria erad
ication, and education are started by the IVP
people with the help of Vietnamese outsiders.
"If you push them too hard, they won't do
a thing or they will find a way to foul you
up. But if you don't encourage the villagers
to look beyond themselves they won't do any
thing," Lee said.
Vietnam today is in a pre-political stage. The
average villager has no contact with Saigon
and is not immensly concerned about the war,
Lee noted. The goal of development programs
is to prepare the nation for tlie day when it
can govern itself, by giving the people a sense
of social responsibility.
I Was The U.S.
Securing Vietnam, Lee pointed out, means
more than pushing tlie Viet Cong back into the
hills.
Commenting on the attitude of the people
toward the United States, the Stanford student
said, "In my region I was the United States."
The villagers knew of America only from per

sonal contacts, but Li-e noted that most were
glad that the United States was in their coun
try.
' He estimated that it would take another
six to seven years to "secure" the country.
Lee pointed out that once the people had gain
ed a concern for the problems of their nation,
there was no guarantee that a democratic
government would be the result. However, in
areas in which community development work
had been successfully completed, the people no
longer saw a chance for a better life from the
Viet Cong and consequently rejected their ef
forts to return.
Distortion of the war effort in the American
press Lee maintained, has led to a false im
pression about Vietnam both for the Ameri
can public and for many officials in Washing
ton."The newsmen are looking for hot news,
coups d'etats, Saigon bombings, student dem
onstrations and so on. But they fail to report
the nature of the people and our work in the
field," he said.
"When we move into a Vietnamese village,
we try to instill a sense of social responsibility
in tlie people. The average Vietnamese is polit
ically inert; his horizons extend no further
than his family or clan. We are trying to
change his outlook."
That was the way Rensselaer Lee, Stanford
graduate student, described hLs activities in
Vietnam this past summer. Lee did community
development work for International Voluntary
Service, Inc. The group is a private organiza
tion under contract to the Agency for Inter
national Development (AID).
Vietnam is presently undergoing moderiza
tion — not a mechanical revolution, but a
change in the way of life brought by agarian
reforms, increased education, and ultimately
the development of national unity in the
people. "If Vietnam is to modernize, we would
rather stimulate it instead of letting the Com

people accept the Viet Cong because they pro
vide a material life better than existed before,

or because they are forced to accept them."
Social Responsibility
The strategy of the Viet Cong is the same
proposed by Mao TseTung, to build social re
sponsibility. The great problem in Vietnamese
society today is the failure of the people to
see beyond their private problems.
In China the situation is just the opposite,
Lee noted. "It is not uncommon for an intel
lectual to spend three months a year in the
field with the peasants. In that way the
Chinese intellectual relates to all the people
and develops a sense of social responsibility."
Lee described the difficulties in getting the
Vietnamese to break down his particularistic
outlook on the community. "Development
work is not charity — we help them to help
themselves," he said.
Vietnamese Counterpart
When a group moves into a village it is ac
companied by Vietnamese who form a native
counterpart. Progress is only made through
a delicate balance of persuasion and under

standing. Such projects as roads, malaria erad
ication, and education are started by the IVP
people with the help of Vietnamese outsiders.
"If you push them too hard, they won't do
a thing or they will find a way to foul you
up. But if you don't encourage the villagers
to look beyond themselves they won't do any
thing," Lee said.
Vietnam today is in a pre-political stage. The
average villager has no contact with Saigon
and is not immensly concerned about the war,
Lee noted. The goal of development programs
is to prepare the nation for tlie day when it
can govern itself, by giving the people a sense
of social responsibility.
I Was The U.S.
Securing Vietnam, Lee pointed out, means
more than pushing tlie Viet Cong back into the
hills.
Commenting on the attitude of the people
toward the United States, the Stanford student
said, "In my region I was the United States."
The villagers knew of America only from per

sonal contacts, but Li-e noted that most were
glad that the United States was in their coun
try.
' He estimated that it would take another
six to seven years to "secure" the country.
Lee pointed out that once the people had gain
ed a concern for the problems of their nation,
there was no guarantee that a democratic
government would be the result. However, in
areas in which community development work
had been successfully completed, the people no
longer saw a chance for a better life from the
Viet Cong and consequently rejected their ef
forts to return.
Distortion of the war effort in the American
press Lee maintained, has led to a false im
pression about Vietnam both for the Ameri
can public and for many officials in Washing
ton."The newsmen are looking for hot news,
coups d'etats, Saigon bombings, student dem
onstrations and so on. But they fail to report
the nature of the people and our work in the
field," he said.
"When we move into a Vietnamese village,
we try to instill a sense of social responsibility
in tlie people. The average Vietnamese is polit
ically inert; his horizons extend no further
than his family or clan. We are trying to
change his outlook."
That was the way Rensselaer Lee, Stanford
graduate student, described hLs activities in
Vietnam this past summer. Lee did community
development work for International Voluntary
Service, Inc. The group is a private organiza
tion under contract to the Agency for Inter
national Development (AID).
Vietnam is presently undergoing moderiza
tion — not a mechanical revolution, but a
change in the way of life brought by agarian
reforms, increased education, and ultimately
the development of national unity in the
people. "If Vietnam is to modernize, we would
rather stimulate it instead of letting the Com
munists," Lee said.

(Community Development
Lee worked with students in the port town
of Nha-Trang in tlie central region of Soutli
Vietnam and taught English to several groups.
The interests of the present intellectual group,
according to Lee, is far removed from the
needs of the people and of the nation. In an
attempt to create some concern among the
Vietnamese for their own development prob
lems, Lee worked with young intellectuals in
rural projects.
Community development work done by the
International Voluntary Service is quite sim
ilar to the role of the Peace Corps in other
emerging nations. The IVS is in a better posi
tion to help the Vietnamese that the Peace
Corps because of its private status in a land
strewn with distrust.
The strength of the Viet Cong has been
greatly overestimated, Lee observed. "The
people accept the Viet Cong because they pro
vide a material life better than existed before,

or because they are forced to accept them."
