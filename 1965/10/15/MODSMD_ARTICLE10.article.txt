# Stanford Seeks Roses In Troy
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford's undefeated 1965
football team takes a trip south
this afternoon to meet the num
ber six ranked team in the na
tion — USC - Saturday after
noon in a game that could wrap
up a Rose Bowl berth for either
of the teams.
USC is favored in the game
by two full touchdowns, which
reflects just how much a foot
ball power USC is this year.
With Mike Garrett et al in the
backfield, a stalwart defense led
by the Monster and the Anchor,
and forward lines on defense and
offense which can control the

play of the game, USC is a team
to be feared.
Winning Nol Fearing
But this is not Stanford's
weekend to be fearing, it is a
weekend to be winning. To lose
this game and still have a shot
at the Rose Bowl seems to be
a dream which will never ma
terialize. Bui to come away from
Los Angeles a winner, Stanford
is just going to have to change
its traditional means of playing
football.
Against the Air Force and
Oregon the Tribe was able to
make errors and still stay close
enough in the game, so that two
last minute drives could produce
the winning margin. Against the
Trojans miscues will cost a
premium. Stanford must hope to
hang on to the football as long
as possible to keep the ball away
from Garrett as long as pos
sible.
The Big Red "IV
The Indian defense leads the
AAIJW so far this season, but
as yet they have not met any
one with Garrett's ability for de
struction. He has scored 7 out
of the 11 Trojan touchdowns. He
averages 162 yards per game,

which is more than the entire
Stanford team averages per
game rushing.
The outlook for this game
does not really look too bright
but there are some factors
which may benefit the Cards. If
Stanford can avoid the "fumble
flow" which produced five
against Oregon, they may be
able to keep the ball away from
Garrett. Stanford's defense has
been outstanding this year, and
a good performance from this

group may bottle up the Tro
jans.
No ."Vliseiies, Please
Lewis and Meyers are healthy,
but it will take more than a
healthy team to beat USC. Stan
ford has yet to play a game free
of numerous mistakes, mainly
on offense. Last year when the
Trojans played up here Stanford
was in the game right up until
the time that a fumble halted
a final drive on the USC 40 yard
line. The final score was 15-10.

Both trams have improved
greatly this year. The Indians
just have to rediscover their po
tential. Then if they play that
way things will he just great
this weekend back at the reser
vation.
But the problem with that
Iheory is that they only have
one day to discover this fleeting
potential — one day to learn
how not to fumble, how not to
throw an interception, how to
avoid crucial penalties (or at
least make it so that the referee
doesn't see them) — one day to
learn to win.

MIKE GARRETT — Need w.
say more?
Stanford's undefeated 1965
football team takes a trip south
this afternoon to meet the num
ber six ranked team in the na
tion — USC - Saturday after
noon in a game that could wrap
up a Rose Bowl berth for either
of the teams.
USC is favored in the game
by two full touchdowns, which
reflects just how much a foot
ball power USC is this year.
With Mike Garrett et al in the
backfield, a stalwart defense led
by the Monster and the Anchor,
and forward lines on defense and
offense which can control the

play of the game, USC is a team
to be feared.
Winning Nol Fearing
But this is not Stanford's
weekend to be fearing, it is a
weekend to be winning. To lose
this game and still have a shot
at the Rose Bowl seems to be
a dream which will never ma
terialize. Bui to come away from
Los Angeles a winner, Stanford
is just going to have to change
its traditional means of playing
football.
Against the Air Force and
Oregon the Tribe was able to
make errors and still stay close
enough in the game, so that two
last minute drives could produce
the winning margin. Against the
Trojans miscues will cost a
premium. Stanford must hope to
hang on to the football as long
as possible to keep the ball away
from Garrett as long as pos
sible.
The Big Red "IV
The Indian defense leads the
AAIJW so far this season, but
as yet they have not met any
one with Garrett's ability for de
struction. He has scored 7 out
of the 11 Trojan touchdowns. He
averages 162 yards per game,

which is more than the entire
Stanford team averages per
game rushing.
The outlook for this game
does not really look too bright
but there are some factors
which may benefit the Cards. If
Stanford can avoid the "fumble
flow" which produced five
against Oregon, they may be
able to keep the ball away from
Garrett. Stanford's defense has
been outstanding this year, and
a good performance from this

group may bottle up the Tro
jans.
No ."Vliseiies, Please
Lewis and Meyers are healthy,
but it will take more than a
healthy team to beat USC. Stan
ford has yet to play a game free
of numerous mistakes, mainly
on offense. Last year when the
Trojans played up here Stanford
was in the game right up until
the time that a fumble halted
a final drive on the USC 40 yard
line. The final score was 15-10.

Both trams have improved
greatly this year. The Indians
just have to rediscover their po
tential. Then if they play that
way things will he just great
this weekend back at the reser
vation.
But the problem with that
Iheory is that they only have
one day to discover this fleeting
potential — one day to learn
how not to fumble, how not to
throw an interception, how to
avoid crucial penalties (or at
least make it so that the referee
doesn't see them) — one day to
learn to win.
