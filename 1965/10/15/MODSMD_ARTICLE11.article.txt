# Water Poloists Go South; Vie For National Honors
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
The fired-up Stanford water
polo team has played five games
so far this season and has left
five opponents parboiled in its
wake. The sizzling Indians jump
into hot water of someone else's
making, as they take on UCLA
this weekend for top national
honors.
UCLA, whom the tribe en

counters this afternoon, will
probably give Stanford its!
toughest game of the season.
The Bruins hart a strong team
last year il-l against Stanford), :
and they boasted a red-hot fresh- J
man squad that no one came j
close to.
After UCLA, It's USC
After the UCLA game, the In
dians will have yet another bat-
I tie to wage. The Indians meet
I Southern Cal in USC's notorious
tank on Saturday morning.
Stanford has never beaten the
Trojans in home territory.
When Stanford had the na
tional champion team in 1963,
the Cards lost at USC in a game
where only two of the seven Red
starters survived the game.
Southern California's warm cli
mate makes the pool a hot place
to compete and keeps the offi
cials' footpath smouldering as
well.
Southern Cal. always a tough '
team to conquer, split with Stan- |
ford last year. The Trojans lost j
to Foothill in a 6-5 contest at I
Los Altos two weeks ago, but j
if history repeats itself, the i
Tribe will need all the horses it j
can muster to whip the Trojans. I
Which e v e r team comes j
through the weekend fray in ;
best shape will be the prime j
candidate for the number one
national ranking. Stanford meets j
all contenders, USC, UCLA, j
Foothill, and Long Beach State j
later this year up north.
Stanford Team Deep
Stanford's 1965 team is solid
through the last man, due to a
minimal graduation loss last i
year and the comingof-age of
Stanford's best-ever freshman
team.
Captain Mike Eshelman and
sophomores Gary Sheerer anrt
Pete Rear! have spearheaded the I
Tribe's punch this season with '
sticky-fingered ball handling,
alert play-making, and accurate
shooting.
The steady performances of i
Jeff Beck, Bill Derrig, Mark i
Parmely, Doug Jensen, and Bill !
Meyer have sparked the Cards' j
volatile offense with an ever- j
present scoring threat.
Strong Defense
Indian defense has been an |
annoying obstacle to opponents j
throughout the season. The'
Cards have effectively cramped i
the adversaries' movement in
the field, forcing the bad pass, j
setting up the interception and i
the fast break.
Goalies Vance Simonds anrt j
Mike Sorem have consistently j
come up with the crucial saves i
in front of the Red goal.
Another plus for tribe tactics
this year has been its low foul
ing rate. The Indians have re
fused to give away an offensive
advantage by committing an
average of half their opponents'
fouls.
