### 
MINNEAPOLIS —ST. PAUL
—The Los Angeles Dodgers won
the 1965 World Series Thursday
when Sandy Koufax fired a 2-0,
three-hit shutout at the Minne
sota Twins in the seventh game
before a record 50,596 fans at
Metropolitan Stadium.
Coming back with only two
days rest after his 7-0 victory
Monday at Los Angeles, Koufax
finally ended the streak of home
park domination in this Series.
Sandy ended the game with a
strikeout flourish, mowing down
his ninth and 10th victims for
the last two outs.
Koufax, who had won and lost
in previous duels with Jim
Kaat, the Twins' left-handed
act, yielded a single to Zoilo
Versalles in the third, a double
to rookie Frank Quilici in the
fifth, and a single to Harmon
Killebrew in the ninth.
Johnson Stars
Lou Johnson, a much traveled
athlete who swung around the
minors before the Dodgers
brought him up in May, hit the
home run that doomed Kaat.
The 31 -year-old outfielder from
Lexington, Ky„ hit the foul pole
screen in left, leading off the
fourth inning.
Ron Faiiiy's 11th hit of the
Series, a double to the right
field wall, and Wes Parker's
bouncing single over Don Minch
er's head to right field, scoring
Fairly, finished off Kaat in the
fourth before a man was out.
Koufax escaped from his most
serious jam in the fifth on a
brilliant play by Jim Gilliam.

Quilici's double to the left cen
ter screen and a walk to pinch
hitter Rich Rollins on a 3-2 pitch
that drew protests from Koufax
gave the Twins their best shot
of the sunny afternoon.
Versalles rapped a hot drive
down the third base line that
Gilliam gloved behind the bag
and was able to scramble to third
base in time to force Quilici.
Fans Cheer Koufax
The big home town crowd,
which had cheered Koufax when
he came to bat in the top of the
ninth, whooped it up for the
Twins in the last inning as Kille
brew singled to left with one
out.
But Earl Battey struck out on
three blazers and Bob Allison
went down swinging for the
ninth time in the Series.
The Dodgers converged around
the mound, slapping Koufax on
the back and Manager Walter
Alston, who had chosen Sandy
over a rested Don Drysdale for

this final game, rushed out to
pump the lei't hand that won
him another world champion
ship.

at all," said Sandy in the dress
