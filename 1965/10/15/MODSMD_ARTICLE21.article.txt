# 'Scholarly Irreverence' Profitable... And Fun, Too
## 
### HAL HUGHES 
"Being an ex-scholar is like being an ex-communist." This is one
ol the many novel thoughts introduced by the personable Prof.
Richard Armour in an hour-long press conference last Wednesday.
Armour, satirist extraordinaire and author of more than 30 books
and 5,000 magazine pieces, talked candidly about many facets of

his life, from his age ("I am 59—
and plan to cling to il for a long
time") to his wife ("She is no
help at all- just a good wife").
He was educated at Pomona
and Harvard, and feels that his
writing career really began dur
ing his undergraduate years
when he wrote for his campus
humor magazine. During his j
graduate years at Harvard Ar- j
mour continued to write, but his j
style underwent a suddeni
change.
Straining under the notorious I
"publish or perish" rule, he i
turned out three books and one I
play. He wryly described the
play (a biography of Milton en
titled To These Dark Steps) as a
"one-night flop."
Armour's years of scholarship
were not as wasted on satire as
many of his fellows have sup
posed. In fact, he termed his
satire "irreverent scholarship,"
explaining that he "used the j
methods of scholarship for sat- |
ire."
When asked if other scholars
"looked down their noses" at
him for his switch to satire he
replied in the affirmative and
added that his "wife feels it very
much—but she is willing to
spend the money."
Of his books, It All Started
With C olumbus first earned him
national fame; it continues to
outsell his other books. His own
favorite is Drugstore Days, an
autobiography of his child
hood previous to and including
World War 1.
Armour named senior Steve !
Hoglund, head of the Stern Hall
Guest-in-residence program, as
the primary reason for his visit
to Stanford. Armour will receive i

an Honorarium which he de
scribed as "a large word for a j
small fee."
He feels that teen-agors are a j
better audience for humor than :
adults because "they enjoy a j
wider range of humor" and i
"don't specialize" as do adults.
