Theater
THE SUBJECT WAS ROSES is at the Geary in San Francisco
(see review on this page).
TIIE NO MAN'S CHILD, written by undergraduate John
Binkley and acted entirely by children, will play tonight and to
morrow night at 8:00 in the Nitery. It purports to show adults
how a child views the grown-up world.
The Tangent's ILLEGITIMATE THEATER is giving a special
benefit performance for the Farm Labor Strike tomorrow night at
10:30. Tickets are on sale at the Post Office.
Grace Cathedral will inaugurate its fourth theater season with
Arthur Miller's THE CRUCIBLE. This play about the Salom Witch
Trials opens tonight at 8:30 in the Groat Choir, and will play Fri
day and Saturday for throe weekends.
Films
This week, in place of the Friday Film Series, Tresidder and
Stanford Jazz Year will offer a series of early and rarely shown
JAZZ FILMS, among them "Rhapsody in Black and Blue," with
Louis Armstrong, and "Bundle of Blues," with Duke Ellington.
There is no admission charge.
WILD STRAWBERRIES, Ingmar Bergman's surrealistic
classic, is Saturday's Tresiddor olfering.
NIGHT OF THE IGUANA, the excruciatingly bad movie ver
sion of Tennessee Williams' play, will get raked over the coals at
the Sunday Flicks. Its only claim to fame is that il typecast Richard
Burton as a wayward Episcopal minister.
The Monday "Films in the Tank," shown in Physics Lecture
Hall at 4:30 and 8:00, will feature THE MISCHIEF MAKERS,
Francois Truffaut's first film.
VIVRE SA VIE, or "My Life to Live," is Thursday's University
Film Series offering. It was written and directed by Jean-Luc God
ard, whose "Contempt" starred Brigitto Bardot and was just awful.
Maybe this one is bettor.
The Bijou is supposed to be showing SHIP OF FOOLS (see re
view on this page). However, as of deadline time, the projectionists
are still striking it. In any case, you can go see it at the Redwood,
just up El Camino a piece and much closer to Renato's.
A STRANGER KNOCKS, which was banned in New York for
something like two years, mainly because of its candor about going
beddy-bye, is at the Fine Arts. With it is THE LOVERS, which
doesn't share the distinction of having been banned, but which is
almost equally explicit.
The Guild is showing THE PAWNBROKER, a fine film, about
the inner torment of a Jewish pawnbroker who survives the hell
of a concentration camp only to find himself a front for a New-
York gangster. .
The Paris has packed Cleopatra into her barge and sent her
back homo. In her place they have Debbie Reynolds, who is terrible
as THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN (in fact the whole movie
is terrible), and Julie Andrews in THE AMERICANIZATION OF
EMILY.
The Park has Suzanne Pleshette in RAGE TO LIVE, and
PSYCHO; but the big news is that on October 20 and 21, Puccini's
BOHEME will be presented at 1:30, 7:00. and 9.00. This version is
by the La Scala Opera Company under the direction of Herbert
Von Karajan. Groups of twenty or more may purchase tickets
in advance for a reduced rate.
MARRIAGE ON THE ROCKS and THIRD DAY are still at the
Stanford.
The Varsity still has THE THRILL OF IT ALL, which is
definitely not worth it; but it also has THE IPCRESS FILE, which
is definitely outstanding, better by far than all the Bonds put to
gether.
Other
As a part of the Tuesday Evening Series, ANTON HEILER,
Viennese organist, composer, and conductor, will give an organ re
cital on Tuesday at 8:30 in Memorial Church.

The Bijou is supposed to be showing SHIP OF FOOLS (see re
view on this page). However, as of deadline time, the projectionists
are still striking it. In any case, you can go see it at the Redwood,
just up El Camino a piece and much closer to Renato's.
A STRANGER KNOCKS, which was banned in New York for
something like two years, mainly because of its candor about going
beddy-bye, is at the Fine Arts. With it is THE LOVERS, which
doesn't share the distinction of having been banned, but which is
almost equally explicit.
The Guild is showing THE PAWNBROKER, a fine film, about
the inner torment of a Jewish pawnbroker who survives the hell
of a concentration camp only to find himself a front for a New-
York gangster. .
The Paris has packed Cleopatra into her barge and sent her
back homo. In her place they have Debbie Reynolds, who is terrible
as THE UNSINKABLE MOLLY BROWN (in fact the whole movie
is terrible), and Julie Andrews in THE AMERICANIZATION OF
EMILY.
The Park has Suzanne Pleshette in RAGE TO LIVE, and
PSYCHO; but the big news is that on October 20 and 21, Puccini's
BOHEME will be presented at 1:30, 7:00. and 9.00. This version is
by the La Scala Opera Company under the direction of Herbert
Von Karajan. Groups of twenty or more may purchase tickets
in advance for a reduced rate.
MARRIAGE ON THE ROCKS and THIRD DAY are still at the
Stanford.
The Varsity still has THE THRILL OF IT ALL, which is
definitely not worth it; but it also has THE IPCRESS FILE, which
is definitely outstanding, better by far than all the Bonds put to
gether.
