# Acting Saves 'Ship Of Fools'
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
When Kathorine Anno Port or
published her long and eagerly
awaited novel, Ship of Fools, two
things happened first, every
body, but everybody, read it, and
second, a number of people,
among them literati writing for
scholarly journals, decided that
the wait wasn't worth it. In oth
er words, it didn't measure up
to expectations; but then what
book wouldn't be a letdown after
a twenty-year buildup?
All this is by way of saying
that Stanley Kramer's movie
version of the book, though
awaited somewhat loss eagerly,
doesn't quite measure up either;
but then has any movie based
on a novel ever measured up?
Tile Ideal
Rhetorical questions and oth
er evasive measures aside, Abby
Mann, who wrote the screenplay,
has at least preserved Miss Por
ter's basic idea (which, by the
way, sho borrowed, along with
the title, from a 14th century
German name d Sebastian
Brant), that being, put a group
of peoplo together for a long
enough period of time in a situ
ation whore they have nothing
to do but talk, eat, and make
love, and soon they will make
fools of themselves.
In this case, a German ship
loaves Vera Cruz bound for
Bromerhaven; the time being
1933, it conveniently takes 26
days to make the crossing. As
sembled on board are a dwarf,
an American divorcee, several

lovers (young and old', a has
been baseball player, a few
Jews, a lot of Germans, and a
violent anti-Semite.
The dwarf narrates, the divor
cee earrys on, some of the lovers
love, some of them quarrel, the
has-been gets dumped on, and
the anti-Semite goes to work on
the Jews. In the process, every
one manages to look ridiculous
most of the time.
The Fun
The fun, of course, is watch
ing the characters emerge from
the impersonal shadows of a
passenger list and proceed to un
burden themselves on each
other, at great length and in
amazing detail. In fact, it's not
only the fun of it; this revela
tion of the inner self in continu
ing episodes is the whole point
of it.
Now in order to make a man
ageable motion picture out of
all this, a job roughly like hav
ing to reduce a life-size panor
ama of mankind to half a dozen
thumb-nail sketches, the afore
mentioned Mr. Mann has
abridged and rearranged the
plot, prettied up the characters,
and simplified their complexities
well into stereotypy.
With the fun (and the point)
thus taken out of it, this venture
is perilously close to foundering
before it even gets close to the
West Indies. What bails it out
is its cast. Viven Leigh, as the
candid and tough-minded divor
cee, turns oven her worst lines
into deadly barbs. Simone Sig
noret is movingly pathetic as the
exiled countess; Oskar Werner

is equally good as hoi* doctor- 1
lover.

has-been, Michael Dunn is per
fectly cast as the dwarf, and |
Jose Ferrer is really obnoxious
as the anti-Semite. Only Eliza

a depth in their young-love parts j
that obviously isn't there.

might have been a simplistic I
mishmash is instead like a ball ;
covered with fragments of mir- '
ror, reflecting, though not pone- |
tratingly, at least competently, I
the many foolish faces of man.

things happened first, every

second, a number of people,
among them literati writing for
scholarly journals, decided that
the wait wasn't worth it. In oth

Tile Ideal
Rhetorical questions and oth

Mann, who wrote the screenplay,
has at least preserved Miss Por

way, sho borrowed, along with
the title, from a 14th century

days to make the crossing. As

lovers (young and old', a has

most of the time.
The Fun
The fun, of course, is watch

the impersonal shadows of a
passenger list and proceed to un
burden themselves on each

amazing detail. In fact, it's not

of it.

ageable motion picture out of
all this, a job roughly like hav

well into stereotypy.
