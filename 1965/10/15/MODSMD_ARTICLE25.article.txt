# 'The Subject Was Roses' A Damp And Boring Play
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
"The Subject Was Roses" won
the Pulitzer Prize and was voted
Best Play of the Year by the
New York Drama Critics Circle.
By rights, then, one should feel
guilty about not liking it that
much; and one should say so in
print with fear and trembling at
the very least. However, it has
also been recorded that fools
rush in where angels won't even
tippytoe, or something like that.
Rushing in, the first tiling
striking the eye is the set, a
living room and kitchen done in
the finest tradition of late-Vic
torian horror. It is perfectly
awful, and just the background |
for the action of "Roses."
Basically, the play is one long j
family argument between Moth
er, Father, and Son, on the oc
casion of the son's return from
World War 11. Father complains
Mother is babying Son. Son com
plains Father doesn't love him,
Mother complains Son is drink-'
ing too much, Son complains !
Mother is ganging up on Father, I
Father complains Mother is ter- i
rible at making coffee, and so i
on ad nauseum (and ad absurd- j
um, too).
I.nils
Occasionally, during lulls in j
the shouting, the conversation j
appears to be veering unexpect- j
edlv into really interesting
waters, for instance, what the
war really was like, the soldier's
adjustment to peacetime Ameri
ca, his family's adjustment to
him, and his to his family.
Apparently over his head in
these depths, author Frank Gil
roy pauses long enough to splut
ter out the most outrageous
platitudes and then doggy
paddles it back to safer, and
shallower, parts.
This might not be so bad if
the shallows were fraught with j
laughs and other amusements;
but it is definitely very bad since
they are not nearly fraught
enough. The play starts off with
a glubb-glubb first scene and
picks up enough momentum
(i.e., good lines) to end the first
act promisingly (i.e., with its
head above water).
Gluhb-Glubl), Again
The second act goes right
back to the glubb-glubb routine,
but gathers a good head of
steam right up until the end,

when it founders on "There's
no use bringing good coffee into ;
this house," and goes straight j
to the bottom.
One might object that all this !
dampness is intentional, that ;
life is hell in the Bronx (or all
over lower-middle-class America, ;
for that matter); nevertheless, it
is still exceedingly boring to
watch three people drowning in 1
a sea of irrelevancios, and not j
very funny or tragic ones at
that.
Jack Albertson, as Father,
Martha Scott, as Mother, and
Martin Sheen, as Son, drown as
gracefully as can be expected
under the circumstances.

By rights, then, one should feel
guilty about not liking it that
much; and one should say so in

the very least. However, it has
also been recorded that fools

striking the eye is the set, a

Basically, the play is one long j
family argument between Moth
er, Father, and Son, on the oc
casion of the son's return from

war really was like, the soldier's
adjustment to peacetime Ameri

him, and his to his family.
Apparently over his head in

This might not be so bad if
the shallows were fraught with j

they are not nearly fraught
