## The 						Class Of '66 Will Not Be Shown In Living Color 
### 
Eitor, The Daily:
In reply to a letter regarding
color portraits in the 1966
QUAD, Mr. Davis is correct: no
portraits will he printed in color
this year. The reason for this is
the quality of the past senior
color sections. Even though we
have the best color lithographer
in th e ye a r bo ok business
(Wheelwright of Salt Lake City)
and the best color photographer
on the West coast (Keith Cole
of Redwood City), a color por
trait section, because it is made
by a mass separal ion process,
cantiot yet match the quality of
color pages made from individ
ual separations. (Perhaps SRI
could help here, i
1966 QUAD will instead run
32 pages of full color in the
opening photo' essay. When the
books first come out, it seems
the sections most referred to
are the residence and senior
sections. Later, though, the most
important section will be the
photo essay.
QUAD attempted lo have 'a
jw>ll about senior color taken at
the last ASSU election. The de
cision to change senior color
was made only after unofficial

liolls were taken independently
by both the editor (a junior)
and the business manager ta
senior).
This change is being explain
er! as appointments are kept for
portraits. (All students this year
have the option of having their
pictures taken in color for
proofs and portrait orders for
an additional fee of $2 charged
by Keith Cole Studio.)
Mr. Davis is incorrect, how
ever, in asuming that a color
section is the "only distinction"
the senior class has in the
QUAD. Seniors have their pic
tures in both the residence and
senior sections. Plans have been
made to expand the senior sec
lion and to cover activities from
all four years. Perhaps Mr.
Davis would like to come in and
help with this new senior sec
tion?

• Our 'New Duckling'
Editor, The Daily:
As a member of Stanford's
largest minority group, I would
like to offer a few comments on
your new duckling, The Daily
Women's Page.
The Daily deals with student
news. Wherefore comes the as
sumption that news involving
only women students is so ex
ceptional. and of such common
occurence once every ten days,
that it deserves a separate classi
fication?
Most of us read The Daily.
Every Day. We can find sched
ules of visiting lady careerists
in Once Around the Quad. If you
wish to emphasize the fact that
women's organizations such as
AWS are capable of programs
anrl intellectual activities, why
not put the story on the news
page, where it belongs?
The material of the Women's
Page is directed toward male
readers. I object to the defensive
tone of articles such as "Are
Coeds Equal?" I object to the
articles in the first place.
I have a suggestion.
If The Daily wishes to publish
a Veritable women's page, you
should return to the origin of
women's pages as a pecking plot
for society and feminine gossip.
You could begin with lists of
engagements and write-ups of

marriages in Mem Chu. The
Daily could print a social col
umn. I have always wondered
who belonged to Stanford's "in"
groups. You could print features
on women administrators, on
how to organize a Strawberry
Brunch, and as a matter of com
munity responsibility and ur
gent interest to the Stanford
Female, on contraceptives.
You could at least print "Dear
Ah by."
As a Women's Page reader, I
suggest that if The Daily plans
to discriminate it do so properly.
I have one other suggestion,
which I feel is echoed by the ma
jority of Stanford women, for
The Daily Women's Page.
A mercy killing. Immediately.

• More Union Flak
Editor, The Daily:
As we understand it, the uni
versity's aims in closing and re
modeling Union Residence are
to provide more space on Quad
for various academic depart
ments and to move Student
Services and Dean's offices to a
more convenient locale. These
aims are admirable, but per
haps secondary to the ideal of
the residence university. In
bringing the academic concerns
of the classroom into the living
group and in stimulating per
sonal development, Union ad
mirably fulfills this ideal.
One only need amble around
campus to the beat of the sledge
hammer to be aware of the
amount of money being spent
on expansion. If funds can lie
allocated for the construction
of a new basketball pavillion,
perhaps they may also be ob
tained to construct a building to
house the offices destined for
Union.
If the university is truly com
mitted to its ideals of the resi
dence system and is willing to
sacrifice the expedient solution
to an organizational problem,
perhaps it ought to reconsider
its decision to destroy Union
and resolve this issue in a more
creative way.
