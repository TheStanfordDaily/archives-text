# Vietnam Policy Protects America's Vital Interests
## 
### CLAUDE BUSS 
Claude Buss is a professor of
history and a former member of
the Foreign Service.
American policy in Vietnam is
not a single identifiable thing
which can be agreed with or pro
tested against in toto. 11 is a
complex course <>112 action which
has grown like Topsy during the
past sixteen years (since the
communists came into power in
China). Vacillating, inconsistent
as it seems in retrospect, it rep
resents the best possible means
which our governments Demo
erAt and Republican were able
to devise to protect the vital in
terests of the United States.
The present Administration
will be in charge until the elec
tions of 1968 and beyond that
date unless the opposition comes
forward with better alternatives
for Vietnam and every other con
troversial item. For us ordinary
mortals outside of government
in the meantime, the responsi
bility to help is as great as the
right to protest.
Some platitudes with regard
to Vietnam bear repeating.
While the fighting continues, so
does the negotiating. Every
chancery in the world is con
cerned. The "situation" today is
not the .''.une as it was yester
day. Every day rails for an ago
nizing reappraisal. All proposals
for solutions must start with
the situation as it is today. What
ought to be done ideally is one
thing; what can be done practi
cally is quite another.
No formula for "victory" will
be devised which we would con
sider perfect. Too many inter
ests ain conflict. Lightning
improvements might take place
in our favor; but they cannot be
counted upon. Eventually there
will be "peace, democracy and
unity" which both sides want;
but the issues are when and
under what conditions.
To me, "Vietnam" symbolizes
four groups of problems dealing
respectively with the country it
self, its neighbors, the Far East
region and the entire world.
The first group of problems
centers about the country of
Vietnam and its people. Is Viet
nam one nation, two nations or
not a nation at all? If it is one
nation, the actions of the north
can be interpreted as spillovers
of national fervor. If Vietnam is
two nations, then charges of ag
gression against the north are
tenable and self-determination
for the south becomes a feasible
objective.
Even if Vietnam is not a na
tion, the Vietnamese are a single
people. In spite of ideological
differences, north and south
have more in common with each
other than either has in common
with any outsider. Americans
are outsiders too, and anti-for
eignism is a potent brew. What
we want in Vietnam is not the
same thing which Vietnamese
are fighting and dying for.
A place must be made for the
VC in any eventual government
of South Vietnam. They may be

misguided communists or pup
pets of the north but the south
is still their home. Saigon has
made little effort to win their
hearts and minds.
It may be argued that the in
ternal problems of Vietnam can
not be solved without stepping
up military action. It is equally
clear that escalation alone is in
sufficient. The military situa
tion has improved, but problems
have multiplied. B-52's and
napalm cannot take care of ref
ugees, produce good will, in
crease food supplies or pacify
the countryside. While hostilities
continue, the revolution of ris
ing expectations remains in sus
pended animation. Vietnam is
hopelessly behind Thailand and
the Philippines on the road to
progress.
The second group of problems
deals with Vietnam's immediate
neighbors. They have diverse
values and ideas and for the
most part are neutral in the cold
war. How can the world provide
them with freedom and security
to pursue their chosen ways oi
life? The pax Americana is not
permanent and the United Na
tions is impotent. SEATO is not
the answer, nor is any visible
Afro-Asian combination. Newly
arrived nations are frightfully
jealous of their absolute sover
eignty but they are at the mercy
of forces beyond their control.
Any Geneva conference type
agreement would have only such
validity as the great powers
would choose to give it.
The third group of problems
is that which concerns the whole
Far East, the arc of crisis from
Korea to India and Pakistan.
Yesterday the headlines centered
on Taiwan and Korea; today,
Vietnam and tomorrow Indo
nesia or maybe Taiwan again. A
common thread joins all these
problems.
An ad hoc settlement in Viet
nam may be only a plaster on a
pimple, a makeshift without get
ting at Ihe source of infection.
The rivalry between the differ
ent varieties of "freedom" and
the different brands of commu
nism is at the heart of the prob
lem together with the power
conflicts centered on the con
frontation between the United
States and China. Vietnamese
are caught tragically in the mid
dle. The challenge is to find an
acceptable basis for coexistence.
When will China show itself to
be willing to accept, rules which
apply to the rest of Ihc world?
When will the rest of the world
stand ready to deal with China
as the power which il actually
is? How can we find a satisfac
tory meeting ground?
The fourth group of problems
is that which involves moral is
sues as well as diplomatic tech
niques. I can only suggest a few
on an endless list. What is the
role of war, even wars of libera
tion. in the international soci
ety? What is the place of force
in the quest for justice? To what
extent should honor and pres
tige blur the image of peace?
How can antagonistic claims of
rival nations be settled by peace
ful methods?
How urgent is disarmament
on a global scale? What role is
there for the United Nations?
Was Ambassador Goldberg right
in pleading the case for the UN
in the Pakistan- India affair and
in ignoring the potential role of
the UN in dealing with the
threat to peace in Vietnam?
In another sphere, what are
the responsibilities of an educa
ted citizen, student or professor,
housewife or corporation presi
dent who disagrees with the gov
ernment which represents him?
What obligations does society
impose upon its members and
what rights does an individual
enjoy in following the dictates
of his conscience?
This is the year of Vietnam
as well as the Jazz Year, and it
is to be hoped that as much
talent and organizational skill
will be devoted to the under
standing of the one as the enjoy
ment of the other. Vietnam is
critical and it is likely to become
more so before the academic
year is over.

more so before the academic
year is over.

American policy in Vietnam is
not a single identifiable thing
which can be agreed with or pro
tested against in toto. 11 is a
complex course <>112 action which
has grown like Topsy during the
past sixteen years (since the
communists came into power in
China). Vacillating, inconsistent
as it seems in retrospect, it rep
resents the best possible means
which our governments Demo
erAt and Republican were able
to devise to protect the vital in
terests of the United States.
The present Administration
will be in charge until the elec
tions of 1968 and beyond that
date unless the opposition comes
forward with better alternatives
for Vietnam and every other con
troversial item. For us ordinary
mortals outside of government
in the meantime, the responsi
bility to help is as great as the
right to protest.
Some platitudes with regard
to Vietnam bear repeating.
While the fighting continues, so
does the negotiating. Every
chancery in the world is con
cerned. The "situation" today is
not the .''.une as it was yester
day. Every day rails for an ago
nizing reappraisal. All proposals
for solutions must start with
the situation as it is today. What
ought to be done ideally is one
thing; what can be done practi
cally is quite another.
No formula for "victory" will
be devised which we would con
sider perfect. Too many inter
ests ain conflict. Lightning
improvements might take place
in our favor; but they cannot be
counted upon. Eventually there
will be "peace, democracy and
unity" which both sides want;
but the issues are when and
under what conditions.
To me, "Vietnam" symbolizes
four groups of problems dealing
respectively with the country it
self, its neighbors, the Far East
region and the entire world.
The first group of problems
centers about the country of
Vietnam and its people. Is Viet
nam one nation, two nations or
not a nation at all? If it is one
nation, the actions of the north
can be interpreted as spillovers
of national fervor. If Vietnam is
two nations, then charges of ag
gression against the north are
tenable and self-determination
for the south becomes a feasible
objective.
Even if Vietnam is not a na
tion, the Vietnamese are a single
people. In spite of ideological
differences, north and south
have more in common with each
other than either has in common
with any outsider. Americans
are outsiders too, and anti-for
eignism is a potent brew. What
we want in Vietnam is not the
same thing which Vietnamese
are fighting and dying for.
A place must be made for the
VC in any eventual government
of South Vietnam. They may be

misguided communists or pup
pets of the north but the south
is still their home. Saigon has
made little effort to win their
hearts and minds.
It may be argued that the in
ternal problems of Vietnam can
not be solved without stepping
up military action. It is equally
clear that escalation alone is in
sufficient. The military situa
tion has improved, but problems
have multiplied. B-52's and
napalm cannot take care of ref
ugees, produce good will, in
crease food supplies or pacify
the countryside. While hostilities
continue, the revolution of ris
ing expectations remains in sus
pended animation. Vietnam is
hopelessly behind Thailand and
the Philippines on the road to
progress.
The second group of problems
deals with Vietnam's immediate
neighbors. They have diverse
values and ideas and for the
most part are neutral in the cold
war. How can the world provide
them with freedom and security
to pursue their chosen ways oi
life? The pax Americana is not
permanent and the United Na
tions is impotent. SEATO is not
the answer, nor is any visible
Afro-Asian combination. Newly
arrived nations are frightfully
jealous of their absolute sover
eignty but they are at the mercy
of forces beyond their control.
Any Geneva conference type
agreement would have only such
validity as the great powers
would choose to give it.
The third group of problems
is that which concerns the whole
Far East, the arc of crisis from
Korea to India and Pakistan.
Yesterday the headlines centered
on Taiwan and Korea; today,
Vietnam and tomorrow Indo
nesia or maybe Taiwan again. A
common thread joins all these
problems.
An ad hoc settlement in Viet
nam may be only a plaster on a
pimple, a makeshift without get
ting at Ihe source of infection.
The rivalry between the differ
ent varieties of "freedom" and
the different brands of commu
nism is at the heart of the prob
lem together with the power
conflicts centered on the con
frontation between the United
States and China. Vietnamese
are caught tragically in the mid
dle. The challenge is to find an
acceptable basis for coexistence.
When will China show itself to
be willing to accept, rules which
apply to the rest of Ihc world?
When will the rest of the world
stand ready to deal with China
as the power which il actually
is? How can we find a satisfac
tory meeting ground?
The fourth group of problems
is that which involves moral is
sues as well as diplomatic tech
niques. I can only suggest a few
on an endless list. What is the
role of war, even wars of libera
tion. in the international soci
ety? What is the place of force
in the quest for justice? To what
extent should honor and pres
tige blur the image of peace?
How can antagonistic claims of
rival nations be settled by peace

Korea to India and Pakistan.
Yesterday the headlines centered

An ad hoc settlement in Viet

The rivalry between the differ

the different brands of commu

conflicts centered on the con

are caught tragically in the mid

acceptable basis for coexistence.
When will China show itself to
be willing to accept, rules which
apply to the rest of Ihc world?
When will the rest of the world
stand ready to deal with China

is? How can we find a satisfac

The fourth group of problems

on an endless list. What is the
role of war, even wars of libera

in the quest for justice? To what
extent should honor and pres

How can antagonistic claims of
rival nations be settled by peace
ful methods?
How urgent is disarmament
on a global scale? What role is
there for the United Nations?
Was Ambassador Goldberg right

the UN in dealing with the

In another sphere, what are

This is the year of Vietnam
as well as the Jazz Year, and it
is to be hoped that as much
talent and organizational skill
will be devoted to the under
standing of the one as the enjoy

critical and it is likely to become
more so before the academic
year is over.

American policy in Vietnam is
not a single identifiable thing
which can be agreed with or pro
tested against in toto. 11 is a
complex course <>112 action which
has grown like Topsy during the
past sixteen years (since the
communists came into power in
China). Vacillating, inconsistent
as it seems in retrospect, it rep
resents the best possible means
which our governments Demo
erAt and Republican were able
to devise to protect the vital in
terests of the United States.
The present Administration
will be in charge until the elec
tions of 1968 and beyond that
date unless the opposition comes
forward with better alternatives
for Vietnam and every other con
troversial item. For us ordinary
mortals outside of government
in the meantime, the responsi
bility to help is as great as the
right to protest.
Some platitudes with regard
to Vietnam bear repeating.
While the fighting continues, so
does the negotiating. Every
chancery in the world is con
cerned. The "situation" today is
not the .''.une as it was yester
day. Every day rails for an ago
nizing reappraisal. All proposals
for solutions must start with
the situation as it is today. What
ought to be done ideally is one
thing; what can be done practi
cally is quite another.
No formula for "victory" will
be devised which we would con
sider perfect. Too many inter
ests ain conflict. Lightning
improvements might take place
in our favor; but they cannot be
counted upon. Eventually there
will be "peace, democracy and
unity" which both sides want;
but the issues are when and
under what conditions.
To me, "Vietnam" symbolizes
four groups of problems dealing
respectively with the country it
self, its neighbors, the Far East
region and the entire world.
The first group of problems
centers about the country of
Vietnam and its people. Is Viet
nam one nation, two nations or
not a nation at all? If it is one
nation, the actions of the north
can be interpreted as spillovers
of national fervor. If Vietnam is
two nations, then charges of ag
gression against the north are
tenable and self-determination
for the south becomes a feasible
objective.
Even if Vietnam is not a na
tion, the Vietnamese are a single
people. In spite of ideological
differences, north and south
have more in common with each
other than either has in common
with any outsider. Americans
are outsiders too, and anti-for
eignism is a potent brew. What
we want in Vietnam is not the
same thing which Vietnamese
are fighting and dying for.
A place must be made for the
VC in any eventual government
of South Vietnam. They may be

misguided communists or pup
pets of the north but the south
is still their home. Saigon has
made little effort to win their
hearts and minds.
It may be argued that the in
ternal problems of Vietnam can
not be solved without stepping
up military action. It is equally
clear that escalation alone is in
sufficient. The military situa
tion has improved, but problems
have multiplied. B-52's and
napalm cannot take care of ref
ugees, produce good will, in
crease food supplies or pacify
the countryside. While hostilities
continue, the revolution of ris
ing expectations remains in sus
pended animation. Vietnam is
hopelessly behind Thailand and
the Philippines on the road to
progress.
The second group of problems
deals with Vietnam's immediate
neighbors. They have diverse
values and ideas and for the
most part are neutral in the cold
war. How can the world provide
them with freedom and security
to pursue their chosen ways oi
life? The pax Americana is not
permanent and the United Na
tions is impotent. SEATO is not
the answer, nor is any visible
Afro-Asian combination. Newly
arrived nations are frightfully
jealous of their absolute sover
eignty but they are at the mercy
of forces beyond their control.
Any Geneva conference type
agreement would have only such
validity as the great powers
would choose to give it.
The third group of problems
is that which concerns the whole
Far East, the arc of crisis from
Korea to India and Pakistan.

sufficient. The military situa
tion has improved, but problems
have multiplied. B-52's and
napalm cannot take care of ref
ugees, produce good will, in
crease food supplies or pacify
the countryside. While hostilities
continue, the revolution of ris
ing expectations remains in sus
pended animation. Vietnam is
hopelessly behind Thailand and
the Philippines on the road to
progress.
The second group of problems
deals with Vietnam's immediate
neighbors. They have diverse
values and ideas and for the
most part are neutral in the cold
war. How can the world provide
them with freedom and security
to pursue their chosen ways oi
life? The pax Americana is not
permanent and the United Na
tions is impotent. SEATO is not
the answer, nor is any visible
Afro-Asian combination. Newly
arrived nations are frightfully
jealous of their absolute sover
eignty but they are at the mercy
of forces beyond their control.
Any Geneva conference type
agreement would have only such
validity as the great powers
would choose to give it.
The third group of problems
is that which concerns the whole
Far East, the arc of crisis from
Korea to India and Pakistan.
Yesterday the headlines centered
on Taiwan and Korea; today,
Vietnam and tomorrow Indo
nesia or maybe Taiwan again. A
common thread joins all these
problems.
An ad hoc settlement in Viet
nam may be only a plaster on a
pimple, a makeshift without get
ting at Ihe source of infection.
The rivalry between the differ
ent varieties of "freedom" and
the different brands of commu
nism is at the heart of the prob
lem together with the power
conflicts centered on the con
frontation between the United
States and China. Vietnamese
are caught tragically in the mid
dle. The challenge is to find an
acceptable basis for coexistence.
When will China show itself to
be willing to accept, rules which
apply to the rest of Ihc world?
When will the rest of the world
stand ready to deal with China
as the power which il actually
is? How can we find a satisfac
tory meeting ground?
The fourth group of problems
is that which involves moral is
sues as well as diplomatic tech
niques. I can only suggest a few
on an endless list. What is the
role of war, even wars of libera
tion. in the international soci
ety? What is the place of force
in the quest for justice? To what
extent should honor and pres
tige blur the image of peace?
How can antagonistic claims of
rival nations be settled by peace
ful methods?
How urgent is disarmament
on a global scale? What role is
there for the United Nations?
Was Ambassador Goldberg right
in pleading the case for the UN
in the Pakistan- India affair and
in ignoring the potential role of
the UN in dealing with the
threat to peace in Vietnam?
In another sphere, what are
the responsibilities of an educa
ted citizen, student or professor,
housewife or corporation presi
dent who disagrees with the gov
ernment which represents him?
What obligations does society
impose upon its members and
what rights does an individual
enjoy in following the dictates
of his conscience?
This is the year of Vietnam
as well as the Jazz Year, and it
is to be hoped that as much
talent and organizational skill
will be devoted to the under
standing of the one as the enjoy
ment of the other. Vietnam is
critical and it is likely to become
more so before the academic
year is over.

American policy in Vietnam is
not a single identifiable thing
which can be agreed with or pro
tested against in toto. 11 is a
complex course <>112 action which
has grown like Topsy during the
past sixteen years (since the
communists came into power in
China). Vacillating, inconsistent
as it seems in retrospect, it rep
resents the best possible means
which our governments Demo
erAt and Republican were able
to devise to protect the vital in
terests of the United States.
The present Administration
will be in charge until the elec
tions of 1968 and beyond that
date unless the opposition comes
forward with better alternatives
for Vietnam and every other con
troversial item. For us ordinary
mortals outside of government
in the meantime, the responsi
bility to help is as great as the
right to protest.
Some platitudes with regard
to Vietnam bear repeating.
While the fighting continues, so
does the negotiating. Every
chancery in the world is con
cerned. The "situation" today is
not the .''.une as it was yester
day. Every day rails for an ago
nizing reappraisal. All proposals
for solutions must start with
the situation as it is today. What
ought to be done ideally is one
thing; what can be done practi
cally is quite another.
No formula for "victory" will
be devised which we would con
sider perfect. Too many inter
ests ain conflict. Lightning
improvements might take place
in our favor; but they cannot be
counted upon. Eventually there
will be "peace, democracy and
unity" which both sides want;
but the issues are when and
under what conditions.
To me, "Vietnam" symbolizes
four groups of problems dealing
respectively with the country it
self, its neighbors, the Far East
region and the entire world.
The first group of problems
centers about the country of
Vietnam and its people. Is Viet
nam one nation, two nations or
not a nation at all? If it is one
nation, the actions of the north
can be interpreted as spillovers
of national fervor. If Vietnam is
two nations, then charges of ag
gression against the north are
tenable and self-determination
for the south becomes a feasible
objective.
Even if Vietnam is not a na
tion, the Vietnamese are a single
people. In spite of ideological
differences, north and south
have more in common with each
other than either has in common
with any outsider. Americans
are outsiders too, and anti-for
eignism is a potent brew. What
we want in Vietnam is not the
same thing which Vietnamese
are fighting and dying for.
A place must be made for the
VC in any eventual government
of South Vietnam. They may be

misguided communists or pup
pets of the north but the south
is still their home. Saigon has
made little effort to win their
hearts and minds.
It may be argued that the in
ternal problems of Vietnam can
not be solved without stepping
up military action. It is equally
clear that escalation alone is in
sufficient. The military situa
tion has improved, but problems
have multiplied. B-52's and
napalm cannot take care of ref
ugees, produce good will, in
crease food supplies or pacify
the countryside. While hostilities
continue, the revolution of ris
ing expectations remains in sus
pended animation. Vietnam is
hopelessly behind Thailand and
the Philippines on the road to
progress.
The second group of problems
