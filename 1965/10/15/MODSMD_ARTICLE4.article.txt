## 
### HENRY BRIGGS 
Three student leaders from South
Vietnam arrived almost unnoticed to
day in the midst of the 60 hour Camp
in-slcep-in, talkathon, that is beinft
conducted by the Vietnam.Day Peace
Committee. The students, all leaders
of Saigon and national student organi
zations held an open discussion at
Tresidder Large Lounge that was at
tended by twenty-four Stanford stu
dents.
They declared in that meeting that
with reservations, they like Premier
They, do not favor negotiations in the
war until the North Vietnamese pull
out of Vietnam, and that the long
range plan for Vietnam should empha
size social and economic advancement
rather than military advancement or
protection.
During lunch, and again at the dis
cussion period later in the afternoon,
the three students stressed the impor
tance of social planning to Vietnam's
future.

Mr. Thu. Vice President of Saigon's
Anti-corruption Confederation also
outlined student efforts in urban
areas. The Anti-Corruption Confeder
ation is an influential student run or
ganization. with the purpose of discov
ering bribes, price fixing, graft in the
city governments corruption of any
kind. |
Mr. Thu said that much of the cor
ruption is the product of Chinese in
fluence and that he feels that the Chi
nese are making a consorted effort to
inflate Vietnam's economy. He also
cited a district in Saigon which is com
pletely governed by students. He said
that activities of these kinds often
go unnoticed by Americans but will
contribute greatly t.o moral and social
outlook of Vietnam.
Negotiation IMea
The students also discussed the war.
"There is only one way to end war.
Negotiate. That's common sense,"
said Mr. Dong. He added, however,
that he saw little chance of negotia
tions now because the North Vietna
mese were not willing to pull out of
South Vietnam and until that hap
pened, South Vietnam would not en
tertain negotiation.plans of any kind.
In response to a question about the
tear gas used in the war, Mr. Dong
said that he had experienced tear gas
and did not consider it dangerous.
"There are two ways to get the Viet
Cong. Bomb or use tear gas" Truly
speaking, nobody worries about it."
He also explained that 21 hours before
all bombings, the United States had
agreed to drop warning leaflets. The
Vietnamese then leave through an es
cape route that is policed for Viet
Cong.
The students also talked with
spokesmen for the Vietnam Day Peace
Committee. Although they "sympa
thize with the VDV's right to protest,"
what they disagree with, the students
said is "U.S. involvement in Vietnam."
They further said the VDC spokesman
appeared "poorly informed." A spokes
man for VDPC said that the Vietna
mese students were "one-sided, be
cause of their offices."
The Vietnamese students also com
mented that U.S. force is crucial to
winning the war. but that when the
war is won the U S. should leave.

cited a district in Saigon which is com
pletely governed by students. He said
that activities of these kinds often
go unnoticed by Americans but will

Negotiation IMea
The students also discussed the war.
"There is only one way to end war.
Negotiate. That's common sense,"
said Mr. Dong. He added, however,
that he saw little chance of negotia
tions now because the North Vietna
mese were not willing to pull out of
South Vietnam and until that hap
pened, South Vietnam would not en
tertain negotiation.plans of any kind.
In response to a question about the
tear gas used in the war, Mr. Dong
said that he had experienced tear gas
and did not consider it dangerous.
"There are two ways to get the Viet
Cong. Bomb or use tear gas" Truly
speaking, nobody worries about it."
He also explained that 21 hours before
all bombings, the United States had
agreed to drop warning leaflets. The
Vietnamese then leave through an es
cape route that is policed for Viet
Cong.
The students also talked with
spokesmen for the Vietnam Day Peace
Committee. Although they "sympa
thize with the VDV's right to protest,"
what they disagree with, the students
said is "U.S. involvement in Vietnam."
They further said the VDC spokesman
appeared "poorly informed." A spokes
man for VDPC said that the Vietna
mese students were "one-sided, be
cause of their offices."
The Vietnamese students also com
mented that U.S. force is crucial to
winning the war. but that when the
war is won the U S. should leave.

Vietnam arrived almost unnoticed to
day in the midst of the 60 hour Camp

Committee. The students, all leaders
of Saigon and national student organi

war until the North Vietnamese pull
out of Vietnam, and that the long
range plan for Vietnam should empha

rather than military advancement or
protection.

cussion period later in the afternoon,
the three students stressed the impor
tance of social planning to Vietnam's
future.
