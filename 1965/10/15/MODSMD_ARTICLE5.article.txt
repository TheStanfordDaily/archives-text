to promote public inquiry into the
facts of the war and also demonstrate,
as dramatically as possible, the con
viction of those who oppose our pres
ent policy, according to Ray Tiernan

Berkeley Impetus
The impetus for Ihe protest action
came from the Vietnam Day Commit
tee at Berkeley. Their suggestion for
a common worldwide day of protest
was unanimously accepted at the Con
gress of Unrepresented Peoples in
Washington, D. C. early this summer,
and the days of Oct. 15 and 16 were
designated International Days of Pro
test.
The Congress, composed of informal
representatives from civil rights,
peace and other liberal groups, set
up a National Coordinating Commit
tee for Ending the War in Vietnam,
located in Madison, Wise., which has
been acting as a clearing committee
and distributing reports from individ
ual groups participating in the Pro
test.
The anti-Vietnam activity is a part
of a larger movement among liberal
students working for the idea of a
non-authoritarian, participatory de
mocracy, and thus there is little for
mal structure behind the movement,
but rather it is run by autonomous
groups in each community which op
erate on the general consensus of all
interested individuals.
