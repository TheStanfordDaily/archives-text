## 
### HENRY MULLER Feature Editor PERRY ANDERSON 
Lieutenant Governor Elliot Lee
Richardson of Massachusetts, pres
ently the Law Forum's Guest-in-Resi
dence, urged in a press conference
yesterday morning that Republicans
spend more time getting together to
solve the political problems that face
this nation now and in the future.
"In the past," he stud, "our party
has lacked a concerted effort to think
ahead and figure out tomorrow's prob
lems. It has always been fighting last
year's battles."

Richardson cited civil rights as a
typical example of ttio OOP's failure
to face contemporary problems. He
said that it was a gross mistake for
the Republicans not to have been in
the forefront of the Civil Rights fight.
Role of Individual
The most pressing problem Richard
son can foresee is that of the role of
the individual in this country. He ex
pressed concern over the "processes
of contemporary life which submerge
the individual and erode his identity."
Richardson repudiated the John
Birch Society and expressed his regret
that this was not done at the time of

the National Convention in San Fran
cisco last year. He said that there was
no association between the Society
and his party. "John Birchers are not
Republicans." he added.
In a lecture "The Individual and The
Political Process." given last night in
History Room 21 1. Richardson tinned
again to his theme of the plight of the
American individual.
Richardson stated that the individ
ual faces a sense of loss of identity be
cause of three forces that threaten to
destroy individuality: the increase in
numbers of Americans, the complex
ity of modern, specialized life and the
homogeneity of thought that results
from mass news media and mass pro
duction.
Feeling <>1Â° Alienation
As a result of these pressures, Rich
ardson believes, the individual tends
lo suffer from a feeling of alienation
from big government, which he feels
he can no longer influence.
The greatest potential for solving
ibis problem of identity lies. Richard
son stated, with the infrastructure in
modern society, defined as voluntary
services in which the individual may
participate.
