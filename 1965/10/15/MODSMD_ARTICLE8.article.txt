# 75 STAGE SLEEP-IN
## Harassments Mar Vietnam 'Vigil' 
### CHRIS HARTE 
The blackboard beside Mem Claw
proclaimed "Vigil Tonight" in bold
while letters.
The sleep-in was not scheduled to
start until 11 p.m., an hour away, but
already there were dozens of sleeping
bags stacked around the fountain,
and volunteers were brewing coffee
and setting out doughnuts in prepara
tion for the long night ahead.
The night's only mishap oecured
while most of the "vigilantees" were
still attending the program in Cub
berley Auditorium.
Watrr Balloons Thrown
While one college-age youth pulled
out the cord of the spotlight illumi
nating the area, another stole a black
board; both were covered throughout
by several others throwing water bfiâ– 
loons. No one was injured during the
brief skirmish.
The area around the fountain began
to fill up with students and faculty
members some time ofter 11 when
the program in Cuhberley had ended.
Two professors talked to a stringer
from a national newsmagazine about
civil disobedience and the advisability
and effectiveness of demonstrations.
One man was reporting somewhat
gleefully a telephone call he had re
ceived recently from his mother.
She had reminded him of the un
flinching service of his father and
uncle in World War 11. and told him
thai if fie was afraid to I'itrh 1 was

going to go down to the local draft
board and take up arms herself.
"It's either kill or be killed," she
had said.
Folk Singing
The first guitar was brought out
sometime after midnight. The crowd
stabilized at about 75 persons, the
high point for Hie night; a few drifted
over and began singing folk and pro
test songs.
At least one professor planned to
sleep in the plaza Thursday night.
Another mentioned that he was going
home "to change the diapers on one
of next generation's demonstrators."
Shortly after 1 a.m. the "fountain"
went off and the water in the pool
began to stagnate. The temperature
was dropping quickly.
Five people curled up in sleeping
bags around the fountain, two more
on the grass on the quad side, and
the in or -43 who were still talking and
singing wrapped up in serapis and
blankets or put on extra sweaters and
parkas.
A Willnir sponsor was playing gui-

tar and the group around him was
singing "Go Tell It. On The Moun
tain." One of the leaders of the SCPV
was reading The New Republic, while
nearby someone was studying Chinese
vocabulary cards.
Train Blocking' Taught
Later a bearded student demonstra
ted the position for blocking troop
trains to a group of on looking ad
mirers. "And you just hope it doesn't
have a cow catcher."
Two policemen came by, drank some
coffee, and commented on how peace
fully the demonstration was being car
ried out.
A freshman girl sitting on the wall
of the fountain had been inadvertently
locked out, but didn't seem overly
worried about it. She was doing the
next day's Civ reading in Principhim
Sapientiae. Almost half of the 35 or
10 who slept in the plaza were girls.
Others Join
Five or ten more people had joined
the ranks of the sleeping by 3 a.m.,
and shortly thereafter the guitars
were put up and the singing ended
on an appropriate note "Last night
I had the strangest dream, they'd put
an end to war."
An hour later only five diehards,
besides this reporter, were still awake,
and they were curled up in sleeping
bags and talking in low voices.
As breakfast lines opened across
campus, two score sleeping bodies
were sprawled out around the plaza.
