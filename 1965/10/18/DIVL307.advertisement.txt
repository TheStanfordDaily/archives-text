bor all of us are guilty of breaking that final law of God; "The whole law s fulfilled
in one word, you shall love your neighbor as yourself "
John in his first epistle writes, Any one who hates hi brother is a murderer apd
know lhat no murderer has eternal life abiding in hirn I John 3:15). Thus it is cliff •
to escape the searching words of God which tell us the* hatred, unconcern, and indif
ference lor my neighbor make me a murderer. Jesus Christ also send this in His Sermon on
the Mount: "You have heard that it was said to the men if old, Thou shalt not kill; and
whoever kills shall be liable to judgment'. But I say to that whoever is ongry with
his brother shall be liable to judgment: whoever insults hn brother shall be liable to the
council, and whoaver says you fool shall be liable to the I *11 of fire (Matthew 5:?1 ??).
Like all the rest of God's law and commandments the woids Thou shall not kill serve
only to show us that we are all murderers at heart ". . know that whatever the law
says it speaks to those under the law that every mouth mof be stopped, and the whole
world may be held accountable to God" (Romans : |9). In fact all men stand guilty bHur-'
an infinitely holy God- "Cod has consigned all men to disoi edience, that He might ha
mercy upon all (Romans 11:3?).
God is, however, a God of vengeance and wrath only to those self-righteous men who
continue to plead their own merits and claim self-sufficiency. As a God of love He desires
that all should walk by faith and know Him as a Friend and S'.ivior. It is Jesus Christ who
forgives all your iniquity and who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from
the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, who satisfies you with love as
long as you live ..." (Psalm 103: 2-5).
The most effective way to continue hating your neighbor is to ignore Jesus Christ who
wants to love your neighbor through your yielded life. It is Jesi s Christ alone who makes
one all that he ought to be before God and before his fellow man.

wants to love your neighbor through your yielded life. It is Jesi s Christ alone who makes
one all that he ought to be before God and before his fellow man.

in one word, you shall love your neighbor as yourself "

only to show us that we are all murderers at heart ". . know that whatever the law
says it speaks to those under the law that every mouth mof be stopped, and the whole
world may be held accountable to God" (Romans : |9). In fact all men stand guilty bHur-'
an infinitely holy God- "Cod has consigned all men to disoi edience, that He might ha
mercy upon all (Romans 11:3?).
God is, however, a God of vengeance and wrath only to those self-righteous men who
continue to plead their own merits and claim self-sufficiency. As a God of love He desires
that all should walk by faith and know Him as a Friend and S'.ivior. It is Jesus Christ who
forgives all your iniquity and who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from
the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy, who satisfies you with love as
long as you live ..." (Psalm 103: 2-5).
