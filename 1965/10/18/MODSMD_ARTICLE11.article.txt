marchers, who stopped in front of
police lines.
Shortly after the parade was stop

to turn back to Berkeley's Constitu

"Yellow Reds"
As the demonstrators turned back,

boasted, "You see that little sign up

The marchers' walked by a tall,
dark-haired young man sitting on a
car. He held a placard: "I Will Not

passed him. One bearded man told
him. "See you in the brig, friend."
Many broke into civil rights songs.
"We Shall Overcome," became "We

High school and college-aged heck

demonstrators. The hecklers complied.
"Step back and give the commies

Arriving in Constitution Square,
the demonstrators sal down on the
grass, facing an open truck outfitted
with sound equipment parked on the
north side of the square.
A student with a broken leg sat
on a nearby curb. On his cast was
printed: "Make Love, Not War. 1981
is Here."
A small group of counter-demon
strators gathered to the right, about
20 yards from the sound truck. "All
Americans, over here," one of them
yelled.
"All fascists, over there," a Berke
ley student shouted in reply.
"Shut up, you commies," came the
final retort.
The group, including many adults,
began chanting, "LBJ, LBJ. LB J."
One carried a sign: "Better Brink
manship than Chiekenship."
A short while later, a hassle broke
out between the counter-demonstrat
ors and one of the students. The po
lice quickly closed in and separated
the the groups. From atop the truck,
the speaker told the crowd, "We'd like
to isolate these right-wing fraternity
hoys. Will the VDC people please
stay back?"
"Southern Tactics"
On the truck, Frank Bardacke of
the Viet N'am Day Committee told
the crowd, "It is quite clear where
the City of Oakland stands. They arc
using the same tactics that arc being
used throughout the South to try to
crush a movement."
