Los Angeles Attorney Warren Chris
topher called the Voting Rights Act
of H)65 an "appropriate, if belated" ef
fort to preserve the integrity of Amer
ican Democracy in a special edition of
Ihe Stanford Law Review issued to
day.
"The history of election procedures
in the South." Christopher said, "the
evasive spirit which has met previous
attempts at legislation, and. most of
all. the statistics showing the small
number of Negroes registered to vote
all clearly indicate the need for this
legislation."
Special Edition
The 37-page special issue of the Re
view is based on a memorandum pre
pared by Christopher for the Lawyer's
Committee on Civil Rights Under
Law.
Law Review President Raymond
Fisher says the article is "presented
primarily as an informative essay on
the history and constitutional issues
involved" in the Act.
Ilr> commented that the work was
not an exhaustive or finished study of
the voting law.
Christopher noted that "the staler

light to set their own voter qualifi
cations has been limited by the courts
whenever these qualifications conflict:*
ed with the Fifteenth Amendment.
"It has been uniformly held that
Congress has broad power to enact
legislation to guarantee the right to
vote without regard to race or color,*'
he said.
He noted that provisions for ap
pointment of federal examiners are
the most easily defended sections of
the act.

"Not only have local registrars ap
plied tests in a discriminatory manner
in the past," he said, "but they have
repeatedly perpetuated all-white vot
ing by evading the spirit if not the
letter of court degrees and previ
ous legislation.
"The states' right to set voter quali
fications is preserved by requiring the
examiners to follow all valid state
laws regarding election and registra
tion.
"The Voting Rights Act seeks to
protect a civil right which is perhaps
more fundamental than any other ill
a free society,'' he concludes.
"The end is legitimate and the
means are reasonably adapted 1o that
end."
The special issue of the Stanford
Law Review includes the text of the
final bill, a chronology concerning its
passage through Congress, and an ap
pendix dealing with the last minute
provisions regarding the poll tax and
Puerto Rican voters.
