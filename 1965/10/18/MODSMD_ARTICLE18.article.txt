The Women's Club of Palo
Alto has notiifed the Stanford
administration that it is "100
per cent opposed" to any change
in university regulations prohib
iting the possession and use of
alcoholic beverages on the cam
pus.
The policy is scheduled to be
reviewed by a student-faculty
administration committee this
fall. The view of the WCPA was
expressed in the following let
ter, received by President Ster
ling last week:
"The problems of students,
many of whom are teenagers,
will be multiplied increasingly
if liquor is permitted in dormi
tories and elsewhere on campus.
Traditional Policy
"The argument that students
have cars and will secure liquor
anyway is not a valid reason for
breaking traditional policy."
If students are allowed to
have liquor in their rooms, it
will be unfair to non-drinking
roommates, who may want to
study, according to WCPA Pres
ident Mrs. Carl Kaiser.
The Committee of Fifteen will
study the student liquor ban but
the ultimate decision on policy
change will be made by the Uni
versity Board of Trustees.

Forgotten Child
As a teacher at Peralta, and
previously at Bay Area high
schools, he has integrated his I
knowledge of jazz into the cul- j
tural curriculum. "There is no
reason," he says, "Why jazz
should be the forgotten child of
American culture when it is, in
reality, such an important part
of our musical heritage."
Besides his the third
in the Stanford Jazz Year Series ;
—Elwood has been a consultant j
to the Jazz Year staff. His main
contribution has been the com
piling of the 75-minute tape re-1
cording of commentary and re
corded performances of jazz'
artists between 1917 and 1933.
Elwood's tape my be heard j
thiee times daily, at noon, 3 ;
p.m. and 6 p.m., in Room 270 j
of Tresidder; it is accompanied
by a gallery of photos of the
muscians whose records are on I
the tape.
Second Tape
Elwood is currently readying
a second tape, featuring per- |
formances during the 1933-1940 ;
period, which will be substituted i
for the first tape this week.
In his lecture, he says he
plans to examine the differences
between white, commercial, so
called jazz during the Jazz Age, !
and the authentic Negro jazz
and blues prevalent but largely '
ignored during the period.
The Women's Club of Palo
Alto has notiifed the Stanford
administration that it is "100
per cent opposed" to any change
in university regulations prohib
iting the possession and use of
alcoholic beverages on the cam
pus.
The policy is scheduled to be
reviewed by a student-faculty
administration committee this
fall. The view of the WCPA was
expressed in the following let
ter, received by President Ster
ling last week:
"The problems of students,
many of whom are teenagers,
will be multiplied increasingly
if liquor is permitted in dormi
tories and elsewhere on campus.
Traditional Policy
"The argument that students
have cars and will secure liquor
anyway is not a valid reason for
breaking traditional policy."
If students are allowed to
have liquor in their rooms, it
will be unfair to non-drinking
roommates, who may want to
study, according to WCPA Pres
ident Mrs. Carl Kaiser.
The Committee of Fifteen will
study the student liquor ban but
the ultimate decision on policy
change will be made by the Uni
versity Board of Trustees.
