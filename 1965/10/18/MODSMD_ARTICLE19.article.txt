### Compiled From The Associated Press 
The nation is quiet this mor
ning after a noisy weekend of
protests against United States
policy in Viet Nam.
Most of the demonstrators
across the country were college
students, but their numbers
were few in comparison to the
enrollment of the schools they
attend.
Marchers protesting U.S. mili
tary action in Vict Nam headed
out from Golden Gate Park Sun
day on a two-mile route to San
Francisco's Civic Center.
Police escorted the marchers,
walking in a column headed by
a large American flag on a gold
staff. Right, behind the flag was
a kuge banner lettered, "End
the War in Viet Nam."
1(H) Colleges
Demonstrations by dissenters
to U.S. participation in the Viet
Nam war were held, among
other places, at the University of
Chicago, the University of Michi
gan, in Portland, Maine, at the
University of California at San
ta Barbara. Harvard University,
in New York, at Colorado Uni

versity and the University of
Texas â€”about a hundred institu
tions in all.
At the University of Texas in
Austin, demonstrators were per
mitted to march in protest be
cause on the other side of town,
District Judge Herman Jones
granted a temporary restraining
order against the city's inter
fering with the local student pro
test organization, stating that
"while Americans are dying in
Viet Nam to oppose the closed
society of Communism, it would
be odd indeed if we deny the free
society in Austin, Texas."
NeW York
A force of 10,000 demonstra
tors protesting American policy
in Southeast Asia marched eight
abi-east down New York's Fifth
Avenue yesterday. And in Buf
falo, N.Y., a student group Fri
day night proposed a "U.S. gov
ernment in exile" in Toronto,
Canada, to deal directly with the
Viet Cong.
During a rally beside the
armed forces induction center in
New York City, a 22-year old
student pacifist burned his draft
card. He was one of the first to

do so since such destruction was
made a federal offense.
Several hundred persons
marched along Los Angeles' Hol
lywood Boulevard, chanting such
phrases as "LBJ, how many did
you kill today?" Opposing
demonstrators answered with
calls of "better dead than Red"
and "support our men in Viet
Nam."
Overseas
Besides swelling through
scores of American cities, the
protests spilled over into many
foreign capitals. Rallying to calls
from a Communist newspaper in
Rome, a crowd of about 2,000
marched to the Coliseum there,
but then dispersed quietly.
About 300 youths clashed with
Swedish police using drawn
swords and clubs to beat back
the mob marching on the U.S.
Embassy in Stockholm. Peaceful
demonstrations were held Fri
day night in Bonn, Oslo, Copen
hagen, and Brussels.
In yanoi, the official news
paper Nha Dan said the Ameri
can protests were "a hammer
blow dealt at the Johnson
clique."
Opinion on the demonstrations
ranged from approbation to con
tempt. A Tass dispatch said that
Hanoi students showed solidar
ity with American youths "op
posing the United States Mili
tary agression in Viet Nam."
And Senator Wayne Morse spoke
out in Washington for the dem
onstrators.
Chicago
In Chicago, the former U.S.
ambassador to South Viet Nam.
General Maxwell Taylor, said the
picketing may convince Commu
nist leaders "there is a real di
vision of strength in this coun
try and that may tempt them to
prolong the war."
Press officer Robert J. Mc-
Closkey declared that actually
"the vast majority of Americans
have indicated their strong sup
port" of U.S. policy. He charac
terized the protesters as an "in
finitesimal fraction of the Amer
ican people."
