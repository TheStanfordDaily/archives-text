The demonstrators professed
admiration for the Berkeley po
lioe. "This is hard to say for
idiological reasons, but we want
to thank the Berkeley police,"

The University of British Co
lumbia not only completely out
classed Stanford's soccer squad,
winning 10-4, but also produced
a double hat-trick, a trick indeed.
Stanford's coach Fred Priddle
although obviously disappointed
with the loss did, however, com
ment on the over-all fine play of
his squad. He stated that ÜBC
had four graduate students play
ing for them and felt that this
definitely contributed to the
Thunderbird's brilliance on the
field.
British Columbia took control
of the game right from the start
and was continually pelting
Stanford's goalie Jim Gidwitz
with shots from all over the
field.
The Thunderbirds led 3-0 be
fore the Indians were able to
score. All-American Kamel Kadi
scored two goals for Stanford
and, as San Jose's coach put it,
was the best player out there.
San Jose plays ÜBC tonight and
was scouting the potent team
from across the Northern bor
der.
Jim Conti scored six goals
for the Canadians on a variety
of shots. He scored one side and
front shots and lobbed a shot
from twenty feet out. He thus
became a member of the select
group who have executed the
double hat-trick, scoring six
goals in one game.
Stanford is 1-2 for the season,
also losing to Cal last Saturday
2-1 in overtime. They play Chico
State today at 3:00 at the Rugby
Field. Tuesday they will play San
Francisco State.
