# Plays Needed
## 
### 
One-act plays are now being
accepted for use in the Ram's
Head spring production of stu
dent-written one-act plays.
Ram's Head president Jay
Weaver asked that plays be sub
mitted for review at the group's
office in Tresidder.

Speech Movement, said to the
demonstrators. "They were the
best monitors the march had."
Suddenly, from atop an ad
joining building, a tear gas
bomb was thrown toward the
crowd. It landed about ten feet
from the truck, and the crowd,
soon sensing what had happen
ed, moved back. "Don't rub your
eyes," the monitors, using
megaphones, told the demon
strators. The tear gas cleared,
and in ten minutes the teach-in
resumed.
"Professional Booers"
Off to the side stood two mid
dle-aged men, beer cans in hand.
"You know, these demonstrat
ors are just as low as sanita
tion," one said. He agreed, how
ever, that the protesters had a
right to march. "I've got a
right to boo them, too, though,"
he added. "We're professional
booers." They then began to
argue between themselves as to
whether the Constitution guar
antees the right to march.
Saturday, the marchers met
with a similar lack of success in
their march to the Army Term
inal. This time, the Hell's An
gels showed up and, after break
ing the leg of one Berkeley po
lice sergeants six of them were
arrested.
"This is a victory," said Jerry
Rubin, co-chairman of the VDC,
once it was all over. "We show
ed the depth of opposition in the
San Francisco Bay Area to the
war in Viet Nam."
