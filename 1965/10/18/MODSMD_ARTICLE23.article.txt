Indians, 7-6, Friday in the
Bruins' pool.
Undaunted, the tribe rebound

' Ready scored Stanford's first
goal to leave the half time score

The third quarter brought the

Ready came up with his second
goal of the afternoon to account
for the Cards' third period scor

ford within one goal of the
Bruins.
Then Stan Cole, who scored
all but one of the Bruin goals,

Stanford hopes of a national
championship water polo leam
were dimmed last weekend, but
not quenched. "The (earn to
beat," UCLA, squeaked past the
Indians, 7-6, Friday in the
Bruins' pool.
Undaunted, the tribe rebound
ed behind the unerring arm of
Gary Sheerer to beat USC, 12-10,
on Saturday. Stanford's super
ior depth was the telling factor
in the Indians' first victory over
USC at Troy. Both teams relied
on their second strings to finish
the contest.
The Indians got off to a slow
start against the Bruins, as the
wider, shallow-end pool required
a few adjustments. Trailing 1-0
in the second period, Pete
' Ready scored Stanford's first
goal to leave the half time score
a 1-1 deadlock.
The third quarter brought the
start of Stanford's woes. UCLA
outscored the Indians, 4-2, to
| grab a 5-3 lead going into the
last quarter.
Gary Sheerer capitalized on a
penalty shot for one tally. Pete
Ready came up with his second
goal of the afternoon to account
for the Cards' third period scor
ing.
Fourth Period Rally
Mike Eshelman scored early in
the fourth period to bring Stan
ford within one goal of the
Bruins.
Then Stan Cole, who scored
all but one of the Bruin goals,
threw a penalty shot past Stan
ford goalie Mike Sorem. Only
two shot's passed Sorem in the
entire game. Minutes later, Cole
put in UCLA's last goal of the
game to put the Indians in the
hole, 7-4, with 1:45 left in the
| game.
Eshelman, fouled while in
j scoring position, put Stanford
