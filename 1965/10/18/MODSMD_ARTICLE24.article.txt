ning out, Gary Sheerer scored
his second goal of the day, mak
ing the tally 7-6 in favor of the
Bruins.
A desperation shol as Iho gun
went off went wide, and with
it, Stanford's hopes of the big
win. The Indians have a return
shot at the Bruins hero, Oct. 30.
As in all close games, there
were a number of ifs. For in
stance, two Stanford goals were
nullified by strategic blasts, of
the official's whistle.
Sheerer Perplexes Trogoalles
Gary Sheerer was the name
that will plague Southern Cali
fornia for the rest of the season,
and indeed, for two more years.
Sheerer baffled two Trojan
goalies with an array of fakes
and a series of shots that left
the goal tenders helpless. Sheer
er, in two and a half quarters,
accounted for eight of Stan
ford's 12 goals.
USC's Roy Saari opened the
scoring midway through the
first quarter. Jeff Beck then
evened the count with the
tribe's first tally. Later in the
quarter, Sheerer matched Tro
jan Dean Willeford's two goals
to leave the first period score an
even 3-3.
Stanford exploded in the sec
ond period with five goals.
Sheerer scored two, then scored
his fifth goal of the game on a

penalty throw. Pete Ready sur
prised the SC goalie with a
sweeping backhand shot from
ten yards out. Sheerer then
tossed in one more.
Willeford tallied twice and
Saari once in the second quar
ter, leaving the Trojans behind
8-6 at half time.
SC (Jains in Vain
Southern Cal gained ground
on the Indians in ihe third quar
ter. The Trojans moved to a
10-10 tie on the strength of
Saari's three goals and Wille
ford's one.
Bill Meyer brought the In
dians out of the 10-10 deadlock
with a late quarter score.
By the start of the fourth per
iod, fouling had cut deeply inio
both squads. USC lost five start
ers for four fouls and two on
major fouls. Stanford lost three
players and was destined to lose
three more before the fourth
period got very old.
The fourth quarter saw the
Indians empty their bench. Stan
ford used its greater depth to
keep the ball out of reach of
the Trojans. Mike Eshelman,
who carried on a running duel
with Saari, fouled out, but the
Trojan gun could not get off a
shot.
Bill Meyer put the icing on
the cake with his second goal,
making the final score 12-10.
