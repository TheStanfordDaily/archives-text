### ARLEN HOLTER 
The Stanford Indians soccer
squad suffered its third defeat
of the young season as they fell
to the powerful Dons of the
University of San Francisco, 5-1,
Saturday.
Stanford jumped to an early '
lead in the first quarter as the i
Indian front line kept the ball j
deep in the Don's territory.
Left-inside Bill Hurlburt scored
as the San Francisco goalie was I
drawn out of the cage leaving j
it wide open. Stanford contin
ued to play a brilliant defensive
game through out the remain-!
der of the first half as they held
the Don's scoreless.
The second half started out. j
as if to be a repeat of Iho first.
Neither team could muster a 1
goal until almost the end of the i
third period. Then as the result j
of a repeat corner kick, Indian j
goalie John Wilbur left the cage j
to retrieve a baH that was ,
bouncing out of control. Before
he could pick it up, the ball was :
bv him and the score was tied, |
1-1.
In the fourth quarter the
Stanford offense started to back
up, resulting in increased pres
sure on Wilbur. Four quick San
Francisco goals were the result
of this offensive lapse. The In
dians big gun, All-American
Kamel Kadi was held in check
all afternoon by the tenacious
Don secondary. Herein lies most
of the blame for Stanford's loss.
Coach Priddle received yoe
man service on defense from
John Price and Dave Wytoek. j

Wilbur, playing in only his third
game for the ailing Jim Gid
vvitz, also performed creditably.
The Indians moot San Jose
State on October 20 in their
next game.
