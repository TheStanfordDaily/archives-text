# Stanford Rebuffed By Trojans
## 
### BOB THIERIOT 
Stanford played three and a
half quarters of excellent foot
ball Saturday against the na
tion's 6th ranked team, but then
succumbed to the nation's lead
ing runner, Mike Garrett, who
pulled off a brilliant 77 yard run
to destroy the Tribe and most
of Stanford's hopes for a Rose
Bowl berth.
Two touchdown underdogs at
kickoff time, Stanford was able
to control the play, keeping
USC deep in their own territory.
Except for Garrett the Trojan
attack was completely stalled by
a very stingy defense.
The game was a very quick
contest because Stanford was
content to stay on the ground,
thus controlling the ball and
depriving Garrett. John Read
and ,Ray Handley continued to
peck away at the Trojan de
fense. Twice Ihey carried the
Indians within scoring range,
but each time the drive stalled.
Lone Fumble
After the opening kickoff to
USC and a first down, a per
sonal foul penalty stalled the
Trojans. Fife's punt rolled dead
at tbe Cardinal 10 yard line.
After two first downs and
Read's gallop for 28 yards,
Handley couldn't come up with
a poor pitchout from Dave
Lewis, and USC's Jim Walker
recovered.
That was Stanford's only lost;
fumble of the game. Lewis only
had one pass intercepted late in
the fourth quarter.
Troy Winslow who had been
11 for 11 passing against Wash
ington, could complete only one
pass for 14 yards.
Late in the second quarter
Stanford made the biggest scor
ing threat of the half. A Win
slow pass was intercepted by
John Guillory at the Stanford
30 and returned 39 yards to the
SC 31. A personal foul penalty
shoved Stanford back to the 48
yard stripe, but a third down
pass from Lewis to Mike Con
nelly advanced the ball to the 23.
With time running out Terry
DcSylvia, who has already won
two games with his toe, dropped
back to attempt a field goal
from the 29. With the wind to
help, the 39 yard field goal
struggled toward the crossbar,
but: slid one foot under, though
the kick was on target.
Turning- Point ?
After the game Stanford
coach John Ralston, reflecting
on the missed field goal, said,
"We needed that one; 1 knew
that."
So, Stanford left the field at
halftime with a scoreless tie,
but clearly the Indians had play
ed great ball, forcing the Tro
jans to play according to Stan
ford's pregame plan.

Opening the second half Stan
ford could not mrke a first
down on the first series of
downs, so Tim Abena who punt
ed heroically all day booted
down to the USC 14. Theft the
Trojans manufactured the only
long sustained drive of the
afternoon.
In quick succession Garrett
romped for 10, Winslow for 12,
Garrett again for 12, followed
by Sherman for 11. This gave
USC a first down on the Stan
ford 34. A five yard penalty two
plays later gave USC another
first down. On a 3rd and 7 play
from the 20 Rod Sherman
darted around right end for 14
yards.
Red Laughs Last
Garrett carried twice down to
the 3, then left the game, as if
USC were laughing at Stanford
and saying, "We really can score
without Garrett." They didn't.
After a center smash gained
another yard, the USC rooter
section screamed for a TD. So
Winslow faked a handoff and
tried to bull through right
tackle. But he was met head-on
by a truck load of eager Indians
who thwarted his bid for a
score.
Stanford quickly retaliated by
having Handley and Read drive
up to the USC 41 yard line. In
cluded In the drive was a Lewis
pass to John Mason, successful
for 21 yards. The drive stalled
as before with Terry DcSylvia
trying for another three point:
play from Connelly's hold at the
twenty five. But the ball squirt
ed off the side of his foot and
was never close to being good.
Garrett Prances
Then Stanford ran out of tre
mendous defensive maneuvers.
With third and seven for USC
on their own 23, Mike Garrett,
took a handoff from Winslow,
headed right, past the line of
scrimmage, cut back left toward
the left sideline, and suddenly
was virtually alone. Only Craig
Ritchey was still a challenge,
but he was sliced down by three
blockers, after almost pushing
Garrett out of bounds on the
Stanford forty.
The Indians tried to come
tight back, but an interception
ruined Stanford's last shot,
which this season had been re
sponsible for two wins.
The rest of the game was ant i
climatic, except for the brief
brawl on the kickoff following
Troy's second TD. Even Gary
Pettigrew on crutches was out
on the gridiron looking for a
battle.
