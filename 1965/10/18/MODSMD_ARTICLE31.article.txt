## 
### 
With a promise for the fu
ture, Stanford's freshman grid
iron squad opened its season
last Saturday by scalping a less
potent Southern Cal team 24-13.
Contrary to their varsity coun
terparts, Coach Dick Vermeil's
eleven goi an early start on the
scoreboard and remained domi
nant throughout the game.
Four minutes and 29 seconds
were gone in the first quarter
when Southern Cal watched
Halfback Bill Shoemaker's 24-
yard field goal kick sail over
head through the posts. This
gave the Junior Indians their
early edge, but that was all the
scoring for that period.
Sogge Score
The second period saw USC
come back with Quarterback
Steve Sogge sneaking over for
six, followed by Halfback Steve
D ale's point-after-touchdown.

This gave the southerners a 7-3
edge, but not for long.
About four minutes later, in
the same quarter, an 80-yard
Stanford drive ended with Full
back Greg Broughton plowing
two yards off tackle to pay dirt.
The half-time tally favored the
Indians 9-7.
The nest scoring session
came late in the third period. By
popular (his teammate's) de
mand, Broughton did an encore
of his second quarter perform
ance. and again carried the pig
skin across from the two.
15-7 Lead
Stanford entered the final
period with a 15-7 yead. In an
un us u a 1 scoring situation,
Southern Calsoon enhanced that
edge. With four minutes gone
the USC frosh were trying to
punt themselves out of danger j
from their own two yard line. |
A miscalculated snap from the!
center resulted in the ball being
downed in the end zone and a
safety for Stanford. This lipped
the score to 17-7.
Minutes later the Indians tal
lied again. This time Quarter
back Gene Washington fired
one to Shoemaker on a 20-yard
touchdown pass play. Shoe
maker made good the convers
ion, and his squad led 2'!-7.
Last Attempt
In their final attempt to less
en Ihe gap, the Southern Oal
frosh sent Halfback John Keith
ly on a three yard jaunt into the !
end zone. The final whistle an- â– 
nounced a 24-13 Stanford vie-!
tory.
A brief look at the statistics j

shows Stanford gaining 377
yards while limiting the oppon
ents to 228. This ratio may
prove to be a hint of what is
to come.
The freshmen have three
more games to their season.
They will host San Jose State
this Saturday at 10 a.m. before
the Varsity battles Army.
