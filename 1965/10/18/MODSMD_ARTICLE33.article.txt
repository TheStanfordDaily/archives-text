# A 						Unified Rush Plan
## 
### 
This week, representatives of all the upper
classmen's living groups will consider — and
hopefully agree on — two controversial sub
jects: judicial processes and rush.
Tonight the Interclub Council (ICC') and the
Interhouse Council (NIC) will debate the mer
its of rush and jurisdiction proposals drawn up
last year by a bipartisan ad hoc committee. Last
week, the Interfraternity Council (IFC) re
jected the most far-reaching recommendation of
the ad hoc committee — the one setting up an
Appeals Board to review all cases involving the
four living groups (Wilbur included).
The IPC was wise to reject such a Board,
since an appropriate appellate body already
exists in the ASSU judicial structure. That is,
any interjurisdictional disputes under appeal
should be considered by Men's Council, and
later by the Student-Faculty Appeals Board
promised in the recently approved Judicial
Competence Bill.
The only argument we've heard in opposi
tion to such a move comes from those who iu
sist that their living group system must retain
complete judicial autonomy or suffer unjustly

at the hands of hostile all-campus tribunals.
Such paranoid perception distorts both reality
and reason. No group can rightfully claim au
tonomy when such problems as dirty rush obvi
ously cross jurisdictional lines to affect more
than one living group.
Fortunately, each of the living group coun
cils seem to realize this. An IPC committee will
recommend the Men's Council route to the par
ent body Wednesday. We would urge the IHC
and the ICC to make this important move to
night.
Aside from the dispute over jurisdiction, all
sides are reported to be reasonably well-satisfied
with the ad hoc committee's proposals for a
unified rush policy. We hope so. For in the back
ground lies intervention by either Dean Robert
Gordon or the Legislature, or both, if no agree
ment is reached. And this is a solution no one
wants.
W hen the representatives of all the living
groups meet with Dean Gordon on Friday, we
believe that they will have negotiated a wel
come and long overdue unified rush plan and a
strong judicial arm to enforce it, thus benefiting
the entire community.
