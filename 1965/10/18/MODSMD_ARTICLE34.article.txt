There seems to he a strong feeling in this
country, and even on this "enlightened" campus,
that the right to peaceful protest does not apply
to those with minority views. A case in point
is the reaction to this weekend's nation-wide
protest against the war in Viet Nam.
In New York, protesters were greeted with
raw eggs, red paint, jeers and curses.
In Chicago, pickets were met with egg-throw
ing.
In Austin, Texas, the city council refused
protesters a permit to march. (Later, a dis
trict judge granted a restraining order against
the city's interferring with the parade. Said the
judge: "While Americans are dying in Viet Nam
to oppose the closed society of Communism, it

would be odd indeed if we deny the free society
in Austin, Texas. ')
In Oakland, in an obvious political move, the
city fathers refused orderly demonstrators the
right to march through the city.
In Berkeley, the same demonstrators were
tear-gassed and hit with eggs.
And here at Stanford, students involved in a
protest vigil were met with water balloons, fire
crackers, dunkings in the Mem Claw pool, and
harassment from hot-rodders and a motorcy
clist.
Such lack of tolerance for civil liberties and
peaceful demonstrations reveals a certain
amount of hypocracy in the American mind
about the concept of "freedom," we think. Im
mature tactics like these are out of place when a
serious protest of a very serious war is involved.
