# Politicos Contemplating Run For Show Business I
## 
### ART BUCHWALD 
There have boon so many
show business people going into
politics lately that many poli
ticians are considering going in
to show business.
I spoke to one such politician
the other day who said, "I think
it's the duty of every citizen, no
matter what his profession, to
become an actor."
"But what do you know about
show business?" I asked him.
Reagan Ami Politics
"What does Ronald Reagan
know about politics?" ho re
plied.
"That doesn't answer the
question."
"Look, I can introduce 'Death
Valley Days' or the 'General
Electric Theater' as well as Rea
gan can, if not better. If ho is
going to take the broad out of
my mouth. I'm going to take it
out of his."
"But the reason Ronald Rea
gan is going into politics is not
to take the broad out of your
mouth. He's personable and
people like him and he's always
played a geod guy. That's all
you need to run for office these
days. But show business re
quires talent."
He started to do a little tap
dance on his rug. "Who do I
remind you of?"
"Sen. Dirksen?" I asked.
"No, you fool, Sen. George
Murphy. I've boon watching him
on the Late Show. There really
isn't much to it. It's just a ques
tion of image. Now watch this."
The Thurmond Beat
He picked up a guitar and
played several bars.
"Now who do I remind you
of?"
"Strom Thurmond."
"How did you guess?"

".Sir, I don't want to bo a spoil
sport, !>ut it's much easier for!
a person in show business to
become a politician than it is for
a politician to become a show
business personality. People pay i
good money to sec someone in
the entertainment world, while j
they get their politicians for ;
free. They expect to bo disap- I
pointed when they hear a politic.!
ian, but if you fail in show busi
ness the public gets angry."
My friend went over to his
couch. He started breathing
heavily. "Coach," ho said with
tears in his eyes, "whenever the
chips are down and the team is
discouraged, toll them — toll
them to win one for iho Gipper." j
"What are you doing now?" ■
A Deathbed Scene
"Ronald Reagan in 'Knute
Rockne.' That's the deathbed
scene. Now don't tell mo he did
it any better."
"No, I can't say he did."
He went over to his desk, took
out a cream pie from a drawer, {
and threw it in my face. "Who j
am I now?"
"Pierre Salinger?"
"Steve Allen, you dope. I saw
him do it on a TV show."
"You may have the makings
of a show business personality
at that," I said, wiping the
cream off my suit.
"The trouble with you guys j
is that you just think because a i
guy has boon a politician all his j
life he doesn't know anything. !
Wo care about things, too."
"I'm not doubting you," I said. |
"But I want, to ask you a ques- j
tion. Suppose you don't make it j
in show business. Suppose there !
is nowhere for you to go. What |
will you do then?"
"I'll probably run for Gov
ernor of California."
