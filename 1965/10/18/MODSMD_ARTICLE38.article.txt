• Vietnam Overexposed
Editor, Tlw Daily:
Readers (if The Daily were
last week confronted with a bar
rage of stories, features, col
umns, letters, etc. on Viet Nam.
The Daily has only a limited
amount of space to work with,

and that space should be de
voted to news of interest to the
entire student body. Instead, an
alarming proportion of this
space is being alotted to tho
Viet Nam crisis and its local
ramifications.
On Wednesday. October 13,
32 per cent of the space (ex
cluding advertising) on the
front and back pages was de
voted to Viet Nam; on Thurs
day, 42.5 per cent; and on Fri
day, 62.5 per cent. News in Brief,
for many students the only
source of national and interna
tional news, was entirely omit
ted on Friday. And as for stu
dent news, any organization de

siring publicity in the Daily had
better advise its members to
grow beards, put on sandals,
and stage an all-night vigil.
I hardly think the Viet Nam
activity on campus is as import
ant as the inordinate amount of
coverage given it would seem to
imply. Student interest in this
activity is clearly indicated by
the fact that less than four per
cent of the student body partici
pated in last week's camporee in
White Plaza. Evidently, the
Daily thinks this news is "big"
and in a sense it is right: It's
the biggest laugh I've had in a
long, long time.

• Daily Policy Explained
Editor, The Daily
In answer to Mr. Fender's let
ter of October 11th, there are
many students, faculty and staff
at Stanford who enjoy hunting
and target shooting. As long as
these people keep their weapons
off-campus, the Stanford Police
Department lias no objections
whatsoever. Therefore, I see no
objection to guns and ammuni
tion being advertised in the
Stanford Daily.
