# Students March In Palo Alto
## 
### 
Over KiO Stanford students and fac
ulty members joined in a march from
Stanford to Palo Alto Saturday, end
ing a week long protest against the
Viet Nam war.
The march began at about 11 a.m.
in White Memorial Plaza, scene of a
60-hour sleep-in sponsored by the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in Vietnam.
Behind a banner which read "Viet
nam: a Matter of Conscience," the
group marched down Palm Drive and
University Avenue, turned left on Ra
mona, and joined a rally of about 200
local citizens in Cogswell Plaza.
Hear Admiral True
The rally was addressed by Rear
Admiral Arnold True of San Jose
State College, Professor Christian Bay
of Stanford and David Ransom, chair
man of the SCPV.
Speaking first. Bay compared Nor
way during World War IT to the Unit
ed States today.
"At least here," he said, "protest is
not met with a nighttime knock on the
door by armed police."
Ransom said that his generation had
been taught that "the world is divided
between good and evil," and that the
United States is always the good. He
said that student activities in peace
movements and civil rights move
ments came from an increasing real
ization that such was not the case.
Ransom said that the time had come
stock." He said that the
Ranson said that the time had
come for the peace movement to "take
stock." He said that the movement had
put too little stress on education and
"face-to-face" contact. " We must talk
to people," he said.
Five Alternatives
Rear Admiral True offered five al
ternatives to American policy in Viet
Nam. He noted that Americans refuse
to make a distinction between commu
nism and nationalism, and that many
Asians see that communism has often
been beneficial to nations like their
own.
He said that when he was in China
40 years ago "British. French and
American gunboats patrolled the riv
ers and the British collected the cus
toms," but now China is a "pow
erful and united nation."
March
Following the rally, the Stanford
and Palo Alto groups joined together
in marching down University Avenue,
along F1 Camino Real to the Town and
Country Shopping Center, on Alma
Street and back to Cogswell Plaza.
The VDC march on Saturday after
noon, said SCPV president David Ran
som, was to prove that Oakland had
not refused a parade permit simply
because they felt a night march too
dangerous.
According to Stanford Professor
Charles Drekmeier, one of the Stan
ford group who joined the march in
Berkeley Friday night, the march was
"quite peaceable . . . almost silent."
