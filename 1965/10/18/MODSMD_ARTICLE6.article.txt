### CHRIS 11 ARTE 
A Stanford student was charged by
the University Police with reckless
driving in White Plaza early Satur
day morning during the vigil being
kept by the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam (SCPV).
The student, whose name has not
been released by either the police or
the Dean's office, drove his motor
cycle through the middle of the vigil
four times shortly before 2 a.m.
Two policemen on duty in the plaza
were unable to stop the niotorcyclist,
but notified patrol cars which were
in the area.
Within minutes after the incident
occurred a vehicle patrolman caught
the student near the Stanford Medical
Center and wrote a citation against
him.
Ant i-Demoiist rat ion
After the motorcyclist left the
plaza six students who had come down
from Lasuen street at the same time
requested police permission to march
through the plaza in protest against
demonstrations.
The police said that they could dem
onstrate, provided they be "as peace
ful as they < the SCPV demonstrators)
are being."
When asked if they were connected
with the motorcyclist they replied
that they were not, but that they had
"been around the night before" Uvhcn
other incidents occurred).
48-Star Flag
The six unfolded a 48-star United
States flag and a red and white ban
ner inscribed "Vota Socialismo Demo
crat ico."
After two short marches in front
of the silent vigil they lost interest
in demonstrating and began yelling
"Bomb the Vietnamese" and obsceni
ties.
Asked for some comments for The
Daily they announced that they were
"middle of the road fanatics" who
thought they "could accomplish as
much as the peace marchers - noth
ing."
Noting that "protesting doesn't
seem like a lot of fun," they left.
Thursday night, during the second
night of the 60-hour vigil, a car drove
through the plaza several times, com
ing dangerously close to several
sleepers on the grass beside the foun
tain.
Police Chief Gordon Davis said that
the owner of the car, a Stanford stu
dent living in Palo Alto, would be
questioned about the incident.
Swim In Pool
Other incidents during the second
night of the sleep-in included throwing
firecrackers and water bolloons at
demonstrators, and pushing two peo
ple into the pool around Mem Claw.
No one was apprehended for any of
these disturbances.
The boy who rode the motorcycle
early Saturday has "the option to
go through the Dean rather than the
Student Judicial System," said Asso
ciate Dean Joel Smith, who was watch
ing the vigil when some of the inci
dents occurred.
Smith also said that he "was proud
of the planning and carrying out of
ijie 60 hour vigil."
