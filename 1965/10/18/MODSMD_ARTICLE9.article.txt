### SUE WM/KIZEK 
John Chancellor would like to "set
the whole world laughing at one time"
in his job as head of the Voice of
America (VOA>.
During a visit to Stanford Friday,
Chancellor mentioned laughter, hon
esty in news reporting, and an ability
to communicate with people in their
own language as three basic weapons
of the VGA. the radio network which
combines "journalism and U.S. diplo
macy."
"The VOA aims to report the news,
explain U.S. policies clearly and effec
tively, and present American society
to foreign governments," Chancellor
stated.
"To accomplish tjiis. the VOA speaks
in many tongues to many types of
people." Chancellor reported the news
is sung in some Asian languages, and
Beatle music also plays "an important
role in international relations."
Chancellor emphasized that, despite
its diplomatic role, the news broadcast
over the VOA is not shaped to present
the U.S. in a favorable light.
"In fact, there is a level of sophis
tication in many parts of the world
about the U.S. that requires us to be
as honest as we can," he said.
Even though no polls are allowed
in communist countries Chancellor
estimates the core audience of the
VOA to be approximately 20 million
from the 120.000 letters received each
year.
"This constant dialogue with the
people is a steady check on our out
put," ho said.
He attributed the VOA's problem of
a declining audience to U.S. pariieipa
lion in Viet Nam. "The world diplo
matic community is leaning away
irum tit because ul Vict Naiu. and

people aren't listening because of
this." Chancellor commented.
Another proble'm of the VOA, ac
cording to Chancellor, is the jamming
of radio broadcasts, especially in
China. East Germany. Bulgaria, North
Viet Nam and Cuba. "The Chinese can

jam 15 seconds after we start broad
casting," he stated.
As head of VOA, Chancellor has
learned that "the government is more
human than our humanity and .far
beaurocratic than most people
think."
