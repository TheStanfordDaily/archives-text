Well be on campus
soon to talk about a new
breed of engineering you
can't get a degree in.
"RANGE PROFESSIONAL." It's a new discipline of our own creation ... a blend of the
many technologies required to support our nation's space and missile launches'-.
When a new grad joins Pan Am at the Eastern Test Range with a degree in electronic,
electrical, mechanical, chemical, civil or industrial engineering, physics, or math...or even
if he's an experienced specialist in telemetry, optics, hydraulics, radar, statistics, infrared,
orbital mechanics, data handling, communications or what have you...he soon becomes
proficient in many disciplines.
The multiple striking power of this all-around engineer goes a long way in explaining
our success with planning, engineering, and directing operation of the Air Force's multi
million dollar instrumentation complex stretching from Cape Kennedy to the Indian Ocean
...and why we're working ahead confidently for launches of MOL, Apollo, Voyager and a
host of other sophisticated programs.
Find out more about your potential as a Range Professional when our team visits
