"i"
Everyone of us has a sense of his own basic identity, of that inner lenter of one s life
by which we can each say "I am". The"I" in me is what the Bible calls my spirit, and it
is with my sbirit that "i" attempt to direct my life and control my emotions. We charac
terize people, in fact, by saying they arc 'strong-spirited' or without spirit as we sense
the intensity or the lethargy of the spirit within them which directs their lives.
Unfortunately man in his natural state in his world lacks he spiritual resources which
life demands, and in vain attempts to fill the inner vacuum of Ins heart, the spirit ot
man becomes the inflated ego, puffed up with a terrible c.nd false sense of self importance
and self sufficiency. But Jesus Christ is the One who said, ' Without me you can do noth
ing" (John 15:5), and the great A; oslle Paul among those who have recognized, I know
that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right but I
cannot do it' (Romans 7:1 B].
When the God of the Bible met Moses at a burning bush in the desert He told Moses,
"I AM WHO I AM" (Exodus 3). Expressing His unique personal identity through this Use
of the verb "to be ', God said "It is I alone who am" or "I will be who I will be . The
New Testament calls this same, unchanging God. the Father of spirits' (Hebrews
for He, as the great "I AM has made us people in His own image, as the lesser and
dependent ' i anis".
Now the key to all of life is to discover in personal experience that Jesus Christ is the
one answer to every human need, the all-sufficient God able to meet us fuliy where we
are. (In fact the very name "Jesus" literally means "I AM Savior ). Your invitation asking
Jesus Christ into your heart will bring the great "I AM" into your life with the result that
you and He become One! Thus the Bible says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit
(I Corinthians 6:17) and this is why every Christian can say with Paul, ' it is no longer
i who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Galatians 2:20).

"i"
Everyone of us has a sense of his own basic identity, of that inner lenter of one s life
by which we can each say "I am". The"I" in me is what the Bible calls my spirit, and it
is with my sbirit that "i" attempt to direct my life and control my emotions. We charac
terize people, in fact, by saying they arc 'strong-spirited' or without spirit as we sense
the intensity or the lethargy of the spirit within them which directs their lives.
Unfortunately man in his natural state in his world lacks he spiritual resources which
life demands, and in vain attempts to fill the inner vacuum of Ins heart, the spirit ot
man becomes the inflated ego, puffed up with a terrible c.nd false sense of self importance
and self sufficiency. But Jesus Christ is the One who said, ' Without me you can do noth
ing" (John 15:5), and the great A; oslle Paul among those who have recognized, I know
that nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is right but I
cannot do it' (Romans 7:1 B].
When the God of the Bible met Moses at a burning bush in the desert He told Moses,
"I AM WHO I AM" (Exodus 3). Expressing His unique personal identity through this Use
of the verb "to be ', God said "It is I alone who am" or "I will be who I will be . The
New Testament calls this same, unchanging God. the Father of spirits' (Hebrews
for He, as the great "I AM has made us people in His own image, as the lesser and
dependent ' i anis".
Now the key to all of life is to discover in personal experience that Jesus Christ is the
one answer to every human need, the all-sufficient God able to meet us fuliy where we
are. (In fact the very name "Jesus" literally means "I AM Savior ). Your invitation asking
Jesus Christ into your heart will bring the great "I AM" into your life with the result that
you and He become One! Thus the Bible says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit
(I Corinthians 6:17) and this is why every Christian can say with Paul, ' it is no longer
i who live, but Christ who lives in me" (Galatians 2:20).
