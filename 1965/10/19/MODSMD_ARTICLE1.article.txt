# Reevalution Brings Innovations To Frosh Program
## 
### BARBARA LEVIN 
An explosion of now educational ideas and
the Class of 1969, the last crop of the "baby
boom," have burst onto Stanford at the same
time. A re-evaluation of traditional student
attitudes, classes, and methods are bringing
about a surge of intellectual innovations. Inde
pendent study and deeper student involvement
in learning are the goals behind the new
programs.
Stanford's freshman class enters at a par
ticularly opportune time, a test year for many
long-range projects. These experiments arc
both credit and non-credit in nature. The class,
the living group, and the small single-interest
group provide a background for these changes.
In Depth Learning
The Freshman English course, the common
ground for all Stanford students, has been the
pioneer in this development. Although no sin
gle factor can be cited as the cause, the out
growth is aimed toward personal awareness
and intellectual thought rather than schooled
learning.
Professor Albert Guerard, co-director of

Freshman English, discussed three growing
philosophies of education at a recent gather
ing at Roble. He stated that ". . . learning in
small groups, learning by doing, and learning
in depth . . ." were the basis for the new fresh
man programming. He also referred to the suc
cess of smaller groups and deeper individual
study as seen at foreign campuses and in
honor programs.
In a series of three articles, the nature of
these freshman study groups will be examined.
By format, three general categories are de
fined: non-credit workshops, residence pro
grams, and credit course*.
Non-Credit
The non-credit activities are spearheaded by
the "Sparkle Corps." This co-ordinating com
mittee, headed by Professor Polhenus, is com
posed of Freshman English instructors as
signed to freshman dorms. Active in the group
are Prof. Larry Friedlander, Prof. Dale Harris,
and teaching assistants Tom Sherman, A 1
Velie, Charlotte Morse, and Marsha Storch.
The name "Sparkle Corps," was accidentally
derived. When asked about her duties in the
dorms, Miss Storch quipped that she was to

make life sparkle.
Two basic ideas are the keys to Corps plans.
None of the activities is forced; and their
scope, si'/e, and duration depend upon ihc de
sires of the participants. Also, the groups are
non-credit and will not be restricted by the
conventions of class.
Professor Friedlander believes, 'The idea
behind these programs is to experiment with
ways of learning which can not be tried in
classrooms."
With this in mind, the committee has ar
ranged four weekly groups and are presently
considering others. Each is open to anyone,
although freshmen are especially invited. In
terested persons may .join at anytime.
Movies Will Be Used
A Tuesday night movie series under the
direction of A 1 Velie and Bob Hass, plans to
present movies as the most popular American
art form and to compare them with other art
or literary works. "The purpose of Freshman
English," A 1 Velie commented, "is to encour
age students to be perceptive readers of fiction
and to understand how the author communi
cates." Discussion and explanation of the films

will attempt to transfer these elements to
movies as well.
A play-reading group organized by Profes
sor Friedlander is actually a seminar in dra
matic experimentation. Each Sunday at the
Nitery Theater, stage movement, production,
and dramatic background are actively dis
cussed and attempted.
Two sessions of fiction-writing enthusiasts
meet and discuss the creative work of fellow
members. The groups, led by Marsha Storch
and Charlotte Morse, review stories, personal
essays, and descriptive works each Monday
and Thursday. A poetry-writing workshop of
the same nature has also been organized.
Single Topics Popular
Later in winter and spring quarters, non
credit seminars on such topics as American
foreign policy or modern poetry are planned.
The one-evening discussion on a single topic
of interest seem popular according to a survey
made by the corps. Sessions on specific novels,
authors, and ideas are being considered.
Another product of the Sparkle Corps is a
freshman literary magazine, like last year's
Pusin, which will lie compiled from the work

of the fiction and poetry groups. Tom Sher
man is organizing this project.
In addition, a series of conferences on a
single topic is the basis for articles which will
be incorporated in a paper-back book. This
tentative idea is being handled by Dale Harris.
These ideas are not entirely new at Stanford.
Last year four non-credit discussions were at
tempted. Tom Sherman, who was involved in
last year's casual groups, said that the expe
rience he gained convinced him of the impor
tance of this type of education for all students.
Refreshing Sparkle Corps
"The non-credit group gives the Stanford
student the refreshing oportunity of studying
without the stress of grades, without the re
strictions of a syllabus, and within a field of
special interest." This is the goal behind the
Sparkle Corps idea.
Most of the small group activities are held
in freshman dorms, a more relaxing atmo
sphere. The idea of education through doing
is the basis of the residence or sponsors' pro
grams which will be discussed later in this
series.
