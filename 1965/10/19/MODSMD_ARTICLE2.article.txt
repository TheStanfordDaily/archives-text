### RISSA WHITE 
Part of 1 tic fun of jazz is that we
haven't gotten around to defining it,
according to Phil Elwood. Bay area
disc jockey specializing in .jazz pro
grams, who spoke yesterday at Tre
sidder in the third lecture of the
Stanford Jazz Year series.
The "fun" in jazz permeated El
wood's enthusiastic coverage of "Jazz
in the Twenties: the Old Order
Changes."
He told his audience thai jazz got
(iff to a bad start when it was asso
ciated with, and indeed held respon
sible for, such social manifestations as
wild dancing, the absence of young
people! from the home and liquor 'at
that time illegali.
Jazz was also associated with Ne
groes, who, according to Ladies Home
Journal article in that era, "put the
sin in syncopation."
An expression of the new freedom
enjoyed by young people, jazz rode in
on the tide of economic boom and
material wealth, said Elwood, who al
so is the San Francisco Chronicle's
jazz critic.
It moved north when the Negro
population shifted in that direction,
and there was split into two distinct
parts.
"Some will argue." said the critic,
"that the only true jazz is the music
of the American Negro, the blues and
folk music. Others feel that the com
mercial white jazz whose source was
Negro music was real jazz of a differ
ent kind."
Elwood seemed to be partial to the
authentic Negro jazz, which was orig
inally played in a four-four beat, like
a military march. He pointed out that
Negro recordings were not distrib
uted. and were hard to get hold of.
Because of this, the music stayed
pure.
In the thirties, Negro ja/.z was hid
den. he continued. Negroes didn't
write their scores, but rather played
spontaneously and improvised. During
the Depression, the records didn't sell,
and the musicians didn't have bus fare
to got to the next engagement.
Many found it hard to get work be
cause of their color. So Negro jazz
went into hibernation, and commercial
jazz came to the fore.
What came automatically to the
Negro musician, believed Elwood, was
affected in white bands. Commercial
musicians were too restricted because
they had formal training, but none
of the background of the Negro.
Also, whites didn't live jazz 100 per
cent. They played in big bands for
money, and saved working in small
jazz groups for their spare time.
"And you can't put the flexibility
of small groups, the solos and every
one playing without getting into each
other's way, into a big band," com
mented Elwood.
Without wasting words the boyish
looking lecturer presented a romantic
image of the twenties, what he labeled
"the watershed period."
The critic concluded his lecture with
a commendation of the Stanford Jazz
Year, "which is being received with
great enthusiasm all over the coun
try."
