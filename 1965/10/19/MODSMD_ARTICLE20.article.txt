## Professor Scores Oakland For Halting VDC March 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I would like to correct certain
misinterpretations tJiat have col
ored much of the reporting of
the October 16 Viet Nam Day
march in Berkeley, r do not do
this as a partisan for the Vict
Nam Day Committee; indeed,
my participation in the march
was not in protest over the
stand of the U.S. government in
Viet Nam, but over the stand
of the Oakland government in
flouting the constitutional right
of public assembly by denying
;i permit to the marchers. The
right of minority dissent is a
precious right that the Oakland
city fathers disregarded.
What I observed and partici
pated in was a march carried on
in extraordinarily orderly fash
ion. At no point during the
march did any of those on the
sound truck try to inflame pas
sions or incite us to create dis
order, nor did the marchers
themselves threaten to do so.
We were told again and again
that if the Oakland police per
sisted in their unwillingness to
let the marchers through, the
march would turn around and
return to Berkeley, and this is

in fact what happened, without
incident. Credit for the orderli
ness of the evening belongs (1)
to the Viet Nam Day Commit
tee, who made careful prepara
tions and had hundreds of moni
tors along the route to preserve
order, and to the Berkeley
police, who were extremely cour
teous and reasonable in their re
el nests to the marchers.
If there was anything unruly
and ugly about the evening, it
was the attitude of the Oakland
police who, with their helmets,
billy clubs, tear gas and gas
masks gave one the impression
of suddenly having been trans
ported to Selma, Alabama.
I have some questions about
the ideological position of the
Viet Nam Day Committee, r
have no questions at all about
the responsible way the commit
tee handled ten thousand people
last Friday evening.

•4A Sick Joke"
Editor, Tin* Daily:
Where would Stanford be
without minds like Darrel Cow
an? He was so "right" in his
letter on the Vietnam Vigil. I
was there; it was a sick joke.
Why, Wednesday night I almost
died laughing at those ministers
tone of them was hobbling
around on crutches in the middle
of the night) and professors
you'd expect they would know
better than to care about some
Orientals.
And Thursday night, when
.Robert Scheer came over frojn
Berkeley and predicted over a
million Vietnameses deaths from
American bombing —I split a
gut. And when those good 'ole
frat boys tossed that broad in
the pool because she tried to talk
about nalpham — it was a
scream!
I salute with a raised arm,
Cowan and his conferers; they
represent the spirit of the times.
Man, when you discuss Ameri
can actions intellectually or
morally; man, when you try to
do something as crazy as that
with swingers like Cowan at
Stanford you must be nuts!

• Chastity Syndrome
Editor, The Daily:
The so-called modern Ameri
can woman, sophisticated as she
may seem, is obeessed with a
neurosis which everyday warps
her personality and does great
damage to her social and intel
lectual relationships—the Chas
tity Syndrome.
The average woman grows up
in a society that prizes chastity
on the one hand, and openly un
dermines it on the other. Histor
ically speaking, arguments for
the classical ethic of chastity
outside (and occasionally with
in) "holy matrimony" are both
metaphysical and "practical."
On the other hand, twentieth
century man lives in a post-
Christian society (in the sexual
sense) a society which is increas
ingly typified by the contra
ceptive, the frug and Playboy
magazine. Even the slow proc
esses of the law are begrudging
ly admitting that shows in the
Carol Doda tradition are well
within the national "contempo
rary community standards." The
Pepsi generation wears a bikini
(or looks at «ne) —sex is a seller
and business will not give up its
partner lightly.
Caught in this play of forces,
the average woman dresses to
please (i.e. excite) men, and then
laments their lack of interest in
her "personality and intellectual
side." Her guilt, and the ad
vances of her dates, are only
sanctified by some symbol of in
volvement. which is probably as
arbitrary as the emphasis on
chastity itself—pinning, engage
ment, or a relationship longer
than some given number of dates
(say 5 or 6», modified somewhat
by the relative desirability of the
"catch."
While contraceptives and the
control of venereal disease have
removed many of the college
girl's fears, the personal griefs
of those too uninformed to use
contraceptives, as well as paren
tal admonishments, add fuel to
the guilt feelings. This guilt is
the core of the Chastity Syn
drome and will not be eliminated
until women decide to live in the
twentieth century—or until so
ciety itself decides to return
lock, stock and barrel to the
eighteenth. GREG EVANS

this as a partisan for the Vict
Nam Day Committee; indeed,
my participation in the march
was not in protest over the
stand of the U.S. government in
Viet Nam, but over the stand
of the Oakland government in
flouting the constitutional right
of public assembly by denying
;i permit to the marchers. The
right of minority dissent is a
precious right that the Oakland
city fathers disregarded.
What I observed and partici
pated in was a march carried on
in extraordinarily orderly fash
ion. At no point during the
march did any of those on the
sound truck try to inflame pas
sions or incite us to create dis
order, nor did the marchers
themselves threaten to do so.
We were told again and again
that if the Oakland police per
sisted in their unwillingness to
let the marchers through, the
march would turn around and
return to Berkeley, and this is

in fact what happened, without
incident. Credit for the orderli
ness of the evening belongs (1)
to the Viet Nam Day Commit
tee, who made careful prepara
tions and had hundreds of moni
tors along the route to preserve
order, and to the Berkeley
police, who were extremely cour
teous and reasonable in their re
el nests to the marchers.
If there was anything unruly
and ugly about the evening, it
was the attitude of the Oakland
police who, with their helmets,
billy clubs, tear gas and gas
masks gave one the impression
of suddenly having been trans
ported to Selma, Alabama.
I have some questions about
the ideological position of the
Viet Nam Day Committee, r
have no questions at all about
the responsible way the commit
tee handled ten thousand people
last Friday evening.

Editor, The Daily:
The so-called modern Ameri
can woman, sophisticated as she
may seem, is obeessed with a
neurosis which everyday warps
her personality and does great
damage to her social and intel
lectual relationships—the Chas
tity Syndrome.
The average woman grows up
in a society that prizes chastity
on the one hand, and openly un
dermines it on the other. Histor
ically speaking, arguments for
the classical ethic of chastity
outside (and occasionally with
in) "holy matrimony" are both
metaphysical and "practical."
On the other hand, twentieth
century man lives in a post-
Christian society (in the sexual
sense) a society which is increas
ingly typified by the contra
ceptive, the frug and Playboy
magazine. Even the slow proc
esses of the law are begrudging
ly admitting that shows in the
Carol Doda tradition are well
within the national "contempo
rary community standards." The
Pepsi generation wears a bikini
(or looks at «ne) —sex is a seller
and business will not give up its
partner lightly.
Caught in this play of forces,
the average woman dresses to
please (i.e. excite) men, and then
laments their lack of interest in
her "personality and intellectual
side." Her guilt, and the ad
vances of her dates, are only
sanctified by some symbol of in
volvement. which is probably as
arbitrary as the emphasis on
chastity itself—pinning, engage
ment, or a relationship longer
than some given number of dates
(say 5 or 6», modified somewhat
by the relative desirability of the
"catch."
While contraceptives and the
control of venereal disease have
removed many of the college
girl's fears, the personal griefs
of those too uninformed to use
contraceptives, as well as paren
tal admonishments, add fuel to
the guilt feelings. This guilt is
the core of the Chastity Syn
drome and will not be eliminated
until women decide to live in the
twentieth century—or until so
ciety itself decides to return

flouting the constitutional right
of public assembly by denying
;i permit to the marchers. The
right of minority dissent is a
precious right that the Oakland
city fathers disregarded.
What I observed and partici
pated in was a march carried on
in extraordinarily orderly fash
ion. At no point during the
march did any of those on the
sound truck try to inflame pas
sions or incite us to create dis
order, nor did the marchers
themselves threaten to do so.
We were told again and again
that if the Oakland police per
sisted in their unwillingness to
let the marchers through, the
march would turn around and
return to Berkeley, and this is

in fact what happened, without
incident. Credit for the orderli
ness of the evening belongs (1)
to the Viet Nam Day Commit
tee, who made careful prepara
tions and had hundreds of moni
tors along the route to preserve
order, and to the Berkeley
police, who were extremely cour
teous and reasonable in their re
el nests to the marchers.
If there was anything unruly
and ugly about the evening, it
was the attitude of the Oakland
police who, with their helmets,
billy clubs, tear gas and gas
masks gave one the impression
of suddenly having been trans
ported to Selma, Alabama.
I have some questions about
the ideological position of the
Viet Nam Day Committee, r
have no questions at all about
the responsible way the commit
tee handled ten thousand people
last Friday evening.

•4A Sick Joke"
Editor, Tin* Daily:
Where would Stanford be
without minds like Darrel Cow

letter on the Vietnam Vigil. I
was there; it was a sick joke.
Why, Wednesday night I almost
died laughing at those ministers
tone of them was hobbling
around on crutches in the middle
of the night) and professors
you'd expect they would know
better than to care about some
Orientals.
And Thursday night, when
.Robert Scheer came over frojn
Berkeley and predicted over a
million Vietnameses deaths from
American bombing —I split a
gut. And when those good 'ole
frat boys tossed that broad in
the pool because she tried to talk
about nalpham — it was a
scream!
I salute with a raised arm,
Cowan and his conferers; they
represent the spirit of the times.
Man, when you discuss Ameri
can actions intellectually or

do something as crazy as that
with swingers like Cowan at
Stanford you must be nuts!

• Chastity Syndrome
Editor, The Daily:
The so-called modern Ameri
can woman, sophisticated as she
may seem, is obeessed with a
neurosis which everyday warps
her personality and does great
damage to her social and intel
lectual relationships—the Chas
tity Syndrome.
The average woman grows up
in a society that prizes chastity
on the one hand, and openly un
dermines it on the other. Histor
ically speaking, arguments for
the classical ethic of chastity
outside (and occasionally with
in) "holy matrimony" are both
metaphysical and "practical."
On the other hand, twentieth
century man lives in a post-
Christian society (in the sexual
sense) a society which is increas
ingly typified by the contra
ceptive, the frug and Playboy
magazine. Even the slow proc
esses of the law are begrudging
ly admitting that shows in the
Carol Doda tradition are well
within the national "contempo
rary community standards." The
Pepsi generation wears a bikini
(or looks at «ne) —sex is a seller
and business will not give up its
partner lightly.
Caught in this play of forces,
the average woman dresses to
please (i.e. excite) men, and then
laments their lack of interest in
her "personality and intellectual
side." Her guilt, and the ad
vances of her dates, are only
sanctified by some symbol of in
volvement. which is probably as
arbitrary as the emphasis on
chastity itself—pinning, engage
ment, or a relationship longer
than some given number of dates
(say 5 or 6», modified somewhat
by the relative desirability of the
"catch."
While contraceptives and the
control of venereal disease have
removed many of the college
girl's fears, the personal griefs
of those too uninformed to use
contraceptives, as well as paren
tal admonishments, add fuel to
the guilt feelings. This guilt is
the core of the Chastity Syn
drome and will not be eliminated
until women decide to live in the
twentieth century—or until so
ciety itself decides to return
lock, stock and barrel to the
eighteenth. GREG EVANS
