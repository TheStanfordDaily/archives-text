## Decline Of The Great Powers 
### 
The fog has lifted just enough
to make it reasonably certain
that Rod China has suffered a
sharp setback in Indonesia.
Whether or not Sukarno con
nived at the rebellion it is fairly
clear that, had the rebellion suc
ceeded, Indonesia would have
been even more aligned with
Red China than it has been up
to now.
This confirms the general im
pression that Red China is find
ing much more opposition than
it expected to its militant foreign
policy. Thus, it has had to fall
back from intervention in the
Pakistan-India conflict. There
are some indications that
its influence has declined some
what in Hanoi because it is send
ing less military assistance - to
North Vietnam than are Moscow
and some of the other nations
of the Soviet bloc.
In the struggle at the United
Nations over the admission of
Red China, the favorable votes
are at present insufficient to
overcome U.S. opposition, and

among the missing votes are, sig
nificantly enough, some of the
African states which once be
longed to the French colonial
empire.
Daydreams on China
Nevertheless, it would be a
mistake to inflate this agreeable
news into a daydream about the
impending defeat or collapse of
Rod China. That daydream is an
old chestnut. The daydreamers
have been as wrong about it as
were their forerunners in the
1920s who talked to a few emi
gres and refugees and then knew
for sure that the Soviet Union
was going to collapse.
The setbacks that Red China
is experiencing abroad are not
unique. One general experience
in this age is that all the great
powers are finding is increas
ingly difficult to influence and
control events, especially when
they are in distant places.
Thus, Great Britain is con
fronted in Southern Rhodesia
with a dilemma from which she
can extricate herself it would

seem, only with miraculous po
litical skfll. The Soviet Union
has recently gained some influ
ence in Southeast Asia. But it
is a long way from being able
to direct and control or influence
decisively the policy of Hanoi.
The United States is deeply en
tangled in Vietnam. But only the
reporters who swallow the offi
cial briefings raw are telling us
that we are winning the war.
The decline of the external
power and influence of the big
nations is a significant phenom
enon in human affairs. We are
as yet in no position to appreci
ate it fully, much less to under
stand its consequences. But it is
an obvious fact that as the great
powers are losing their influence
the turbulence in the world is
increasing. All this needs to be
looked at and pondered. As we
do this, we shall do well to keep
in mind what is happening
among our principal allies in
Western Europe.
The British Kx&mplc
Britain, for example, which
has given us moral support in
Vietnam, is nonetheless com
pelled to take the path of mili
tary withdrawal -at least in
Asia from Aden to Singapore
and possibly also in Europe from
the Rhine to Cyprus. The pres
sure for this withdrawal is no
doubt lack of money. But if the
British people believed that the
remnants of the old empire were
vital to their own survival and
to the peace of the world, they
would do what they have done
before, they would put defense
above affluence.
The Germans can be said to
have no extra-European foreign
policy. That may well be because
tJie Germans long since lost
their colonial empire and be
cause they are still partitioned
as a result of their defeat. But
thev are rich, and in their inter

national actions they avoid any
serious participation in world af
lairs or any adequate contribu
tion to economic development.
Besides preferring to keep
their money at home, it has
probably occurred to them that
the game of power politics, es
pecially in other continents and
distant places, shows signs of
becoming out of date though it
is very expensive, rather danger
ous and increasingly ineffectual.
The experience of France
throws an interesting light on
this phenomenon. When Gen.
Chales de Gaulle decided to liq
uidate the Algerian war, an act,
requiring supreme moral cour
age, he did not try to hank on to
the bits and pieces, the shreds
and tatters of the French em
pire.
French Prestige High
The effect of the purge of
French imperialism and colonial
ism is that French prestige in
the world is higher than it has
ever been since the wars of this
century began, and the interna
tional influence of France is now
felt in the mainstream of the
world's politics.
I wish I could feel that our
globalism is not isolating us
from the living realities of world
affairs. But our globalism, so
recently adopted, is becoming
quickly out of date.
We are being isolated in the
sense that, while we are enor
mously extended, we are com
pelled to rely more and more on
military power and upon money
rather than upon the influence
of our example, which was once
our greatest asset in human af
fairs. In this development of our
attitudes we are in danger of
being bedazzled with the illusion
that the ultimate solution of the
intractable issues of the world
is enough bombing to pulverize
the opposition.

clear that, had the rebellion suc
ceeded, Indonesia would have
been even more aligned with
Red China than it has been up
to now.
This confirms the general im
pression that Red China is find
ing much more opposition than
it expected to its militant foreign
policy. Thus, it has had to fall
back from intervention in the
Pakistan-India conflict. There
are some indications that
its influence has declined some
what in Hanoi because it is send

North Vietnam than are Moscow
and some of the other nations
of the Soviet bloc.
In the struggle at the United
Nations over the admission of
Red China, the favorable votes
are at present insufficient to
overcome U.S. opposition, and

among the missing votes are, sig

African states which once be
longed to the French colonial
empire.
Daydreams on China
Nevertheless, it would be a
mistake to inflate this agreeable
news into a daydream about the
impending defeat or collapse of
Rod China. That daydream is an
old chestnut. The daydreamers
have been as wrong about it as
were their forerunners in the
1920s who talked to a few emi
gres and refugees and then knew
for sure that the Soviet Union
was going to collapse.
The setbacks that Red China
is experiencing abroad are not
unique. One general experience
in this age is that all the great
powers are finding is increas
ingly difficult to influence and
control events, especially when
they are in distant places.
Thus, Great Britain is con
fronted in Southern Rhodesia
with a dilemma from which she
can extricate herself it would

seem, only with miraculous po
litical skfll. The Soviet Union
has recently gained some influ
ence in Southeast Asia. But it
is a long way from being able
to direct and control or influence
decisively the policy of Hanoi.
The United States is deeply en
tangled in Vietnam. But only the
reporters who swallow the offi
cial briefings raw are telling us
that we are winning the war.
The decline of the external
power and influence of the big
nations is a significant phenom
enon in human affairs. We are
as yet in no position to appreci
ate it fully, much less to under
stand its consequences. But it is
an obvious fact that as the great
powers are losing their influence
the turbulence in the world is
increasing. All this needs to be
looked at and pondered. As we
do this, we shall do well to keep
in mind what is happening
among our principal allies in
Western Europe.
The British Kx&mplc
Britain, for example, which
has given us moral support in
Vietnam, is nonetheless com
pelled to take the path of mili
tary withdrawal -at least in
Asia from Aden to Singapore
and possibly also in Europe from
the Rhine to Cyprus. The pres
sure for this withdrawal is no
doubt lack of money. But if the
British people believed that the
remnants of the old empire were
vital to their own survival and
to the peace of the world, they
would do what they have done
before, they would put defense
above affluence.
The Germans can be said to
have no extra-European foreign
policy. That may well be because
tJie Germans long since lost
their colonial empire and be
cause they are still partitioned
as a result of their defeat. But
thev are rich, and in their inter

national actions they avoid any
serious participation in world af
lairs or any adequate contribu
tion to economic development.
Besides preferring to keep
their money at home, it has
probably occurred to them that
the game of power politics, es
pecially in other continents and
distant places, shows signs of
becoming out of date though it
is very expensive, rather danger
ous and increasingly ineffectual.
The experience of France
throws an interesting light on
this phenomenon. When Gen.
Chales de Gaulle decided to liq
uidate the Algerian war, an act,
requiring supreme moral cour
age, he did not try to hank on to
the bits and pieces, the shreds
and tatters of the French em
pire.
French Prestige High
The effect of the purge of
French imperialism and colonial
ism is that French prestige in
the world is higher than it has
ever been since the wars of this
century began, and the interna
tional influence of France is now
felt in the mainstream of the
world's politics.
I wish I could feel that our
globalism is not isolating us
from the living realities of world
affairs. But our globalism, so
recently adopted, is becoming
quickly out of date.
We are being isolated in the
sense that, while we are enor
mously extended, we are com
pelled to rely more and more on
military power and upon money
rather than upon the influence
of our example, which was once
our greatest asset in human af
fairs. In this development of our
attitudes we are in danger of
being bedazzled with the illusion
that the ultimate solution of the
intractable issues of the world
is enough bombing to pulverize
the opposition.
The fog has lifted just enough
to make it reasonably certain
that Rod China has suffered a
sharp setback in Indonesia.
Whether or not Sukarno con

been even more aligned with

ing much more opposition than
it expected to its militant foreign
policy. Thus, it has had to fall
back from intervention in the
Pakistan-India conflict. There
are some indications that
its influence has declined some
what in Hanoi because it is send
ing less military assistance - to
North Vietnam than are Moscow
and some of the other nations
of the Soviet bloc.
In the struggle at the United
Nations over the admission of
Red China, the favorable votes
are at present insufficient to
overcome U.S. opposition, and

among the missing votes are, sig
nificantly enough, some of the
African states which once be
longed to the French colonial
empire.
Daydreams on China
Nevertheless, it would be a
mistake to inflate this agreeable
news into a daydream about the
impending defeat or collapse of
Rod China. That daydream is an
old chestnut. The daydreamers
have been as wrong about it as
were their forerunners in the
1920s who talked to a few emi
gres and refugees and then knew
for sure that the Soviet Union
was going to collapse.
The setbacks that Red China
is experiencing abroad are not
unique. One general experience
in this age is that all the great
powers are finding is increas
ingly difficult to influence and
control events, especially when
they are in distant places.
Thus, Great Britain is con
fronted in Southern Rhodesia
with a dilemma from which she
can extricate herself it would

seem, only with miraculous po
litical skfll. The Soviet Union
has recently gained some influ
ence in Southeast Asia. But it
is a long way from being able
to direct and control or influence
decisively the policy of Hanoi.
The United States is deeply en
tangled in Vietnam. But only the
reporters who swallow the offi
cial briefings raw are telling us
that we are winning the war.
The decline of the external
power and influence of the big
nations is a significant phenom
enon in human affairs. We are
as yet in no position to appreci
ate it fully, much less to under
stand its consequences. But it is
an obvious fact that as the great
powers are losing their influence
the turbulence in the world is
increasing. All this needs to be
looked at and pondered. As we
do this, we shall do well to keep
in mind what is happening
among our principal allies in
Western Europe.
The British Kx&mplc
Britain, for example, which
has given us moral support in
Vietnam, is nonetheless com
pelled to take the path of mili
tary withdrawal -at least in
Asia from Aden to Singapore
and possibly also in Europe from
the Rhine to Cyprus. The pres
sure for this withdrawal is no
doubt lack of money. But if the
British people believed that the
remnants of the old empire were
vital to their own survival and
to the peace of the world, they
would do what they have done
before, they would put defense
above affluence.
The Germans can be said to
have no extra-European foreign
policy. That may well be because
tJie Germans long since lost
their colonial empire and be
cause they are still partitioned
as a result of their defeat. But
thev are rich, and in their inter

national actions they avoid any
serious participation in world af
lairs or any adequate contribu
tion to economic development.
Besides preferring to keep
their money at home, it has
probably occurred to them that
the game of power politics, es
pecially in other continents and
distant places, shows signs of
becoming out of date though it
is very expensive, rather danger
ous and increasingly ineffectual.
The experience of France
throws an interesting light on
this phenomenon. When Gen.
Chales de Gaulle decided to liq
uidate the Algerian war, an act,
requiring supreme moral cour
age, he did not try to hank on to
the bits and pieces, the shreds
and tatters of the French em
pire.
French Prestige High
The effect of the purge of
French imperialism and colonial
ism is that French prestige in
the world is higher than it has
ever been since the wars of this
century began, and the interna
tional influence of France is now
felt in the mainstream of the
world's politics.
I wish I could feel that our
globalism is not isolating us
from the living realities of world
affairs. But our globalism, so
recently adopted, is becoming
quickly out of date.
We are being isolated in the
sense that, while we are enor
mously extended, we are com
pelled to rely more and more on
military power and upon money
rather than upon the influence
of our example, which was once
our greatest asset in human af
fairs. In this development of our
attitudes we are in danger of
being bedazzled with the illusion
that the ultimate solution of the
intractable issues of the world
is enough bombing to pulverize
the opposition.
The fog has lifted just enough
to make it reasonably certain
that Rod China has suffered a
sharp setback in Indonesia.
Whether or not Sukarno con
nived at the rebellion it is fairly
clear that, had the rebellion suc
ceeded, Indonesia would have
been even more aligned with
Red China than it has been up
to now.
