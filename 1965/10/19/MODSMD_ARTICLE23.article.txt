## Birchers And Reds Join In Pursuit Of Extremism 
### 
Oh, pity tiio poor John Birch
Society. Everybody is knocking
each other over to disavow its
members. First Sen. Thruston
Morion, then Sen. Dirksen and
Congressman Gerry Ford, fol
lowed by Dick Nixon. And even
Barry Goldwater of the famed
"extremism in the pursuit of"
line has urged the John Birchers
to resign from the Society and
work for the Republican party.
Finally, William Buckley's con
servative National Review de
voted an issue to the John Birch
ers and found them wanting in
all departments. For the first
time the conservatives have de
cided that the "pursuit of ex
tremism in the defense of liberty
is no vice."
The Lonely JBS
It must be very lonely to be
so far out of touch with every
one in the United States and,
when I read of all the disavow
als, my first fear was that the
John Birchers might disappear
from the American scene, which
would be an incalculable loss to
the way-out fringe of the coun
try.
But as luck would have it. I
sat next to a man on a plane
who said he was a member of
Ihe Communist party. I men
tioned to him how depressed I
was by the people who were at

tacking the JBS and he said,
"We'll take 'em if nobody wants
'em."
"You'll take them?"
"Why not? The Communist
party has never turned down a
nut yet."
"But they are sworn enemies
of the Communist party."
"Ave you kidding? They main
tain that 60 per cent of the U.S.
government is made up of Com
munists. Even the? Soviet. Union
has never claimed that. The
John Birchers can find Commu
nists in the United States where
no one knew they existed. They
make us look pretty good back
home."
"What do you mean by that?"
"Well, all we have to do is
send back to Moscow John Birch
literature and our bosses read it
and say, 'Our people in the
United States are really on the
ball.' According to this stuff,
there are Communists every
where. I was given a raise just
by sending the Kremlin a pam
phlet. which proved the State De
partment was composed of So
viet secret agents."
"I could see where Moscow
would be impressed," I said.
"But how would you propose
taking the John Birchers into
the party?"
A United Front
"We'll go to them and say,
'Look, comrades, apparently no
one wants you in the United
States and nobody wants us. But
we need each other. You can't
raise any money without Com
munists. and we can't get credit i
for infiltrating the whole frame- (
work of the American govern
ment alone. So let's join forces. .
Between the two of us we can
knock the pins right out of the
American system. We'll look
good and you'll look good.' "
"But the John Birchers are
super-patriots," T said. "They
would never join the Communist
party."
"Everyone needs love and ac
ceptance. If we don't love them,
who will?"
"How would you work?"
"They're pretty good at infil
trating the PTA's, police depart
ments, and boards of education.
We work more with unions, uni
versities, and Fair Play for Cuba
movements. If we combine forc
es, we'll be unbeatable."
"I have my doubts, sir," I said.
"The John Birchers may be be
yond the fringe, but they would i
never knowingly cooperate with j
you people."
"Perhaps you're right. And
maybe it's better if they didn't.
They're helping us so much now
that I'd rather not do anything
'to disturb them. Say, is it really
(rue that most newspapermen
are pinkos and Commie dupes?" '

you people."

Oh, pity tiio poor John Birch
Society. Everybody is knocking
each other over to disavow its
members. First Sen. Thruston
Morion, then Sen. Dirksen and
Congressman Gerry Ford, fol
lowed by Dick Nixon. And even
Barry Goldwater of the famed
"extremism in the pursuit of"
line has urged the John Birchers
to resign from the Society and
work for the Republican party.
Finally, William Buckley's con
servative National Review de
voted an issue to the John Birch

all departments. For the first
time the conservatives have de
cided that the "pursuit of ex

is no vice."
The Lonely JBS
It must be very lonely to be
so far out of touch with every
one in the United States and,
when I read of all the disavow
als, my first fear was that the
John Birchers might disappear
from the American scene, which
would be an incalculable loss to
the way-out fringe of the coun
try.
But as luck would have it. I
sat next to a man on a plane
who said he was a member of
Ihe Communist party. I men
tioned to him how depressed I
was by the people who were at

tacking the JBS and he said,
"We'll take 'em if nobody wants
'em."
"You'll take them?"
"Why not? The Communist
party has never turned down a
nut yet."
"But they are sworn enemies
of the Communist party."
"Ave you kidding? They main
tain that 60 per cent of the U.S.
government is made up of Com
munists. Even the? Soviet. Union
has never claimed that. The
John Birchers can find Commu
nists in the United States where
no one knew they existed. They
make us look pretty good back
home."
"What do you mean by that?"
"Well, all we have to do is
send back to Moscow John Birch
literature and our bosses read it
and say, 'Our people in the
United States are really on the
ball.' According to this stuff,
there are Communists every
where. I was given a raise just
by sending the Kremlin a pam
phlet. which proved the State De
partment was composed of So
viet secret agents."
"I could see where Moscow
would be impressed," I said.
"But how would you propose
taking the John Birchers into
the party?"
A United Front
"We'll go to them and say,
'Look, comrades, apparently no
one wants you in the United
States and nobody wants us. But
we need each other. You can't
raise any money without Com
munists. and we can't get credit i
for infiltrating the whole frame- (
work of the American govern
ment alone. So let's join forces. .
Between the two of us we can
knock the pins right out of the
American system. We'll look
good and you'll look good.' "
"But the John Birchers are
super-patriots," T said. "They
would never join the Communist
party."
"Everyone needs love and ac
ceptance. If we don't love them,
who will?"
"How would you work?"
