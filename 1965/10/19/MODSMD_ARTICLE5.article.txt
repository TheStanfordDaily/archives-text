Stanford professors and students
who took part in the recent anti-
Vietnam war demonstrations have de
nounced President Johnson's move to
support a study of Communist influ
ence in such movements, calling it
"standard technique" and "hollow."

Mathematics Prof. Karel DeLeeuw,
a participant in last week's march in
Palo Alto, said the president's com
ments were "not very reasonable,"
and were reminiscent of techniques
used in the U.S. in the last 50 years.
He continued, "The difficulty with
this, as in the civil rights movement,
is that certainly people of all sorts
are going to be involved.
Few Communists
"1 don't think one can condemn an
entire movement ... A serious in
vestigation will show if anything, a
small number of Communists in
volved . . . It's outrageous there should
be any sort of investigation."
David Ransom, president of the
Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
Nam, which organized Stanford's 60-
hour vigil on White Memorial Plaza,
said:
"There's nothing that convinces you
so much of the hollowness of the way
the word Communist is used in this
country as being in a demonstration
and having an observer call you a
Communist. So Jong as real social pro
test in this country is called Commu
nist. the country's youth will be sus
picious of those who yell Communist."
Goldwater < 'onintents
Former Sen. Barry Goldwater
speaking in Palo Alto recently, dis

cussed anti-war demonstrations and
the professors who participate in
them. "I'm surprised they can't read
and understand history," he said.
Goldwater agreed that "most of the
demonstrators may be expressing hon
est opinions, but there are probably
a lot of phonies among them. I know
if I were a Communist I'd sure be in
there pitching."
He admitted that he didn't know for
sure if Communists were involved, but
was confident "that the FBI is on top
of the situation."
Criticizes Officials
Goldwater also was critical of the
state officials who allow the demon
strators to march, citing Gov. Brown.
University of California President
Clark Kerr, and the university board
of regents.
"I can't imagine how they could al
low this to get out of hand."
He declared, "If 1 were president of
the university those students wouldn't
he there today."
Expressing his concern for disre
spect of the law and demonstration
on campuses, Goldwater warned, "We
have anarchy coming down the road
toward us," and said that only the
dedciated action of individual citizens,
not government action, will stop it.

Expressing his concern for disre
spect of the law and demonstration
on campuses, Goldwater warned, "We
have anarchy coming down the road
toward us," and said that only the
dedciated action of individual citizens,
not government action, will stop it.
Stanford professors and students
who took part in the recent anti-
Vietnam war demonstrations have de
nounced President Johnson's move to
support a study of Communist influ
ence in such movements, calling it
"standard technique" and "hollow."

Mathematics Prof. Karel DeLeeuw,
a participant in last week's march in
Palo Alto, said the president's com
ments were "not very reasonable,"
and were reminiscent of techniques
used in the U.S. in the last 50 years.
He continued, "The difficulty with
this, as in the civil rights movement,
is that certainly people of all sorts
are going to be involved.
Few Communists
"1 don't think one can condemn an
entire movement ... A serious in
vestigation will show if anything, a
small number of Communists in
volved . . . It's outrageous there should
be any sort of investigation."
David Ransom, president of the
Stanford Committee for Peace in Viet
Nam, which organized Stanford's 60-
hour vigil on White Memorial Plaza,
said:
"There's nothing that convinces you
so much of the hollowness of the way
the word Communist is used in this
country as being in a demonstration
and having an observer call you a
Communist. So Jong as real social pro
test in this country is called Commu
nist. the country's youth will be sus
picious of those who yell Communist."
Goldwater < 'onintents
Former Sen. Barry Goldwater
speaking in Palo Alto recently, dis

cussed anti-war demonstrations and
the professors who participate in
them. "I'm surprised they can't read
and understand history," he said.
Goldwater agreed that "most of the
demonstrators may be expressing hon
est opinions, but there are probably
a lot of phonies among them. I know
if I were a Communist I'd sure be in
there pitching."
He admitted that he didn't know for
sure if Communists were involved, but
was confident "that the FBI is on top
of the situation."
Criticizes Officials
Goldwater also was critical of the
state officials who allow the demon
strators to march, citing Gov. Brown.
University of California President
Clark Kerr, and the university board
of regents.
"I can't imagine how they could al
low this to get out of hand."
He declared, "If 1 were president of
the university those students wouldn't
he there today."
