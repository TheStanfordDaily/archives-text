# Stern, Eating Clubs Ratify Rush Policy
## 
### ERIC MILLER MICHAEL ROSTER 
Undergraduate men's living groups
moved a step closer to adopting a
unified rush policy last night when
eating clubs and Stern independent
houses ratified a set of regulations
first proposed last spring by an ad hoc
student-faculty committee.
In separate meetings the Interciub
Council <ICC i and Interhouse Coun
cil (lIICi, which comprise eating dub
and Stern house presidents and rep
resentatives, approved all the pro
posals offered by the ad hoc commit
tee.
Approval of the rush proposals is
now needed from the fraternities,
which are scheduled to meet tomor
row. Last week the Interfraternity
Council < IFCi turned down the ad hoc
committee's recommendation for a
board to review all cases oi "dirty
rush." IFC representatives then sent
to committee sections dealing wilh
a new written bid system.

IFC President Rub Freeman said lie
will ask the fraternities lo approve
the establishment of the men's ju
dicial council as an appeal board for
all cases tried originally by living
group councils. He said he would also
propose a revised bid system.
Ray Colby, president of the Stern
IHC, said his council approved the
rush proposals unanimously in most
cases. However, he indicated dissatis
faction with the fraternity substitu
tion of men's council for a separate
appeals board.

"The lIIC supports the appeals
board and feels strongly that 1 his
should be incorporated in the rush
regulations," said Colby. He said the
council authorized him to compromise
in this area when he and other living
group presidents meet Friday with
Associate Dean of Students Robert
(lordon.
Colby said that he would "try to
arrive at. some mutually acceptable
solution" at Friday's meeting.
Appeal Board
ICC President Dave Bell said the
eating club council approved using
the men's council for a review and
appeal board. He said, however, meth
ods for establishing party dates would
have to be clarified.
According to Dean Gordon, if the
proposed policy is adopted, it would
mark the first time a rush system
was devised that satisfied all living
groups.
