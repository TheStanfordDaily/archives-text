# Hastorf Talks On Prejudice
## 
### 
Albert H. Hastorf initiated a new
Trcsidder Union lecture series, "View
point: Prejudice." by discussing his
own psychological interpretation of
prejudice last night.
Hastorf is executive head of the
Psychology Department.
"The scapegoat theory of prejudice
is basically correct," says Hastorf.
The theory holds that prejudice fol
lows three conditions: stereotyping,
displacement of feeling, and rational
izat ion.
As an example of stereotypes, Has
torf chose the "Ivy League type." At
Dartmouth, for example, students pic
ture themselves as "heavy drinkers,"
and"he men." "After a fellow has
been at Dartmouth, he follows this
image," he said.
Hastorf hypothesized that prejudice
may lie produced not only by displace
ment. but also by education and habit.
He concluded, "I believe if people
come together, they'll like each other."
