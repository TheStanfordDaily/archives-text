The Origin of War
Remove all the people from the earth and peace would soon prevail. Grass would
cover the missile sites and wildflowers the bcittlefilds of war. Clearly, wor is of human
origin and springs from within man himself. The New Testament wastes no words in
telling us about the origin of war:
"What causes wars and what causes fightings among you? Is it not your pleasures
that are at war in your members? You desire and do not hove, so you kill. And you tan
not obtain; so you fight and wage war. You do not hove because you do not ask ..."
(James 4:1 -2).
A bettor understanding of this passage results from o look at the original Greek of
of the text where we find that wars' and fightings" are military terms clearfy re
ferring to the conflicts and battles we call war". The Greek word translated "pleasures"
gives us our English word hedonist". A hedonist is one who believes that life is meant
for pleasure and the personal pursuit of happiness.
The hard lesson to learn is that God has intended to live on unselfish life, and to
love his neighbor as himself. We are all designed to live in dependence uporv Jesus Christ
who is the Bread of Life and the Water of Life. We aren't built to successfully operate
in any other way, and thus a life lived for personal pleasure is inevitably frustrating and
unsatisfying. It is only a step from frustration to resentment and from resentment to hate.
Hating ono s neighbor, according to the Bible, is oquivolent to murder (I John 3;15), and
coveting what our neighbor has is the same as idolatry (Co'ossians 3:5).
War is in the world, then, because you and I are selfish and because we seek our
own ends and aims, rather than the welfare of others. The cure for selfishness, and all
other diseases, is Jesus Christ, and Jesus Christ alone truly satisfies our deepest needs.
The Psalmit put it, Trut in the ord, and do good; so shall you dwell in the land, and
enjoy security. Take delight in the Lord, and he will give you the desires of your heart.
Commit your way to the Lord; trust in Him and He will aot ..." (Psalm 37:3-5).
The best way you can work for world peace to to turn /our life ov#j to the God of
peace, and to commit your ways to the Lord Jesus Christ.
