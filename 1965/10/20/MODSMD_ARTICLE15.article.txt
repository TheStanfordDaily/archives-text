# Coach Sees Laurels For Frosh Net Team
## Daily Sports 
### 
"Probably tho best we've
ever had," was freshman coach
Bob Rcnker's reply. Having just
been questioned about the qual
ily of this year's frosh tennis
squad, he pointed out that the
thirty players reporting for fall
tennis represent tho most team
depth that Stanford has ever
seen in an incoming class since
he has been mentor.
Joining the rest of tho staff in
hoavy recruiting, Renker seemed
happy about getting nine out of
twenty-five play e rs actively
sought. He continued to specu
late toward an undefeated season
next spring, feeling that there
probably won't be a team in tho
nation that can beat them.
Top Calibre Material
The depth lies in seven or eight
men that .Renker feels are defi
nitely top-calibre material. He
particularly cites Boh Lutz of
Los Angeles and Chuck Alloo of
Kansas. Virtually assured of the
first position, Bob won Ihe Na
tional Junior Tennis Champion
ship without losing a set. Thus
considered the finost freshman

in the nation, lie was also labeled
by Renker . . a fine prospect
for the Davis Cup tram." Chuck
Alloo, formerly of Portland, Ore
gon, ks apparently the most-likely
candidate for the second position,
having won the sixteen-and-un
der championship in high school.
The freshman netmen begin
their schedule in February. Al
though still tentative, they will
have about eleven matches with
the top teams in the Bay area.
Both clashes with the University
of California should present the
toughest competition, while San
Jose State College, a number of
junior colleges, and some of the
more outstanding high school
teams will round out the circuit.

Freshmen practice five days a i
week throughout the year. Sincej
all the competition is from "Dav- i
is Cup teams," Renker maintains j
that the constant practice is vital
for success. In a given match
there are nine contests: six sin
gles matches and three doubles, j
Since a player may play singles, l
or doubles, or both, the team may .
be made up of as many as twelve,
or as few as six, men. In a par
ticular match, says Renker, ihe
stiffness of the competition and
the importance of winning deter- j
mine the team's composition.

Since a player may play singles, l
or doubles, or both, the team may .
be made up of as many as twelve,
or as few as six, men. In a par
ticular match, says Renker, ihe
stiffness of the competition and
the importance of winning deter- j

"Probably tho best we've
ever had," was freshman coach
Bob Rcnker's reply. Having just
been questioned about the qual
ily of this year's frosh tennis
squad, he pointed out that the
thirty players reporting for fall
tennis represent tho most team
depth that Stanford has ever
seen in an incoming class since
he has been mentor.
Joining the rest of tho staff in
hoavy recruiting, Renker seemed
happy about getting nine out of
twenty-five play e rs actively
sought. He continued to specu
late toward an undefeated season
next spring, feeling that there
probably won't be a team in tho
nation that can beat them.
Top Calibre Material
The depth lies in seven or eight
men that .Renker feels are defi

particularly cites Boh Lutz of
Los Angeles and Chuck Alloo of
Kansas. Virtually assured of the
first position, Bob won Ihe Na
tional Junior Tennis Champion
ship without losing a set. Thus
considered the finost freshman

by Renker . . a fine prospect
for the Davis Cup tram." Chuck
Alloo, formerly of Portland, Ore

candidate for the second position,
having won the sixteen-and-un

The freshman netmen begin
their schedule in February. Al
though still tentative, they will
have about eleven matches with
the top teams in the Bay area.
Both clashes with the University
of California should present the
toughest competition, while San
Jose State College, a number of
junior colleges, and some of the
more outstanding high school
teams will round out the circuit.

Freshmen practice five days a i
week throughout the year. Sincej
all the competition is from "Dav- i

that the constant practice is vital
