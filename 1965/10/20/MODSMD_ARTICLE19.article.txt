# Social Regs... Again
## 
### 
Even after last year's thorough reorganiza
tion, Stanford's policy on social regulations is
still marred by inequities, inanities and non
sequiturs — especially in the areas of overnights
and open house hours.
The new overnight policy, is, for the most part,
both enlightened and successful. However, the
provision that women cannot take an overnight
to another University residence or building, or
to any location which is without a telephone,
without permission from Women's Council
seems a bit questionable to us. Men can spend
the night at the Computer Center, the beach
or a White Plaza vigil, but women cannot; that
is, unless Women's Council thinks "special cir
cumstances" warrant such activity.
II Women's Council decides to apply these
rules sparingly, then they are unnecessary; il
it plans to uphold them strictly, then the spirit
of the University-approved ASSU By-law will
be violated. These provisions, as well as the
other sub-regulations drawn up by the Associ
ated Women Student's Social Regs Committee
lor a pamphlet printed this summer, are subject
to review by the Legislature prior to approval.
We suggest that the Legislature do some re
viewing as soon as possible.
The other problem — open house hours — is
l>oth inequitable and absurd. During Fall Quar
ter, 1963, President Sterling's Advisory Com
mittee 011 Student Affairs and Services declared
that "pending study ' all men's residences would
be allowed to have open houses on Wednesday
and Friday evenings from 7-11 p.m., while the
women could hold similar functions Wednesday
night from 7-1 1 p.m. and Sunday afternoon from
noon to 5 p.m. The committee also gratuitously
noted that "doors may not be locked."

The ratioale behind this policy — which is
still in effect because the "pending study" is
still pending — seemed to be based on two
premises. Both are permeated with the in loco
parentis ethic, though one is more puritanically
oriented than the other. As one committee mem
ber observed before the vote, it would be unwise
to allow coeducation to extend into the "bed
room." This shows about as much taste — and
as much perception — as Sen. Strom Thurman's
repeated warnings about the real motive behind
the Civil Rights Movement — namely, the
alleged Negro desire to enter white bedrooms.
What our astute commentator did not note was
that the "bedroom" is all the student has, and
until more than a token number of three and
four-room suites are added in university resi
dences, that's all he or slie will have.
The seond rationale is more reasonable, but
still not compelling. Jt is held that the students
room is the last outpost of privacy on campus.
This may be true, but the members of each
residence should be allowed the privilege of
democratically ascertaining just how often they
wish to have their privacy violated. After all, it
does seem a bit ludicrous for the men in Crothers
Memorial — the average age there, we believe, is
something like 25 — to be told whom they can
have in their rooms and on what nights.
Student Affairs and Services has announced
that a new study of this program is on the
agenda — but so is the complex liquor question
(the fourth time is the charm, we suppose).
Thus, the Student Affairs Committee of the
Legislature, or a specially formed ad hoc com
mittee, should be. requested to help with the
"research" that bureaucratic necessity will iin
doubtcdlv demand.
