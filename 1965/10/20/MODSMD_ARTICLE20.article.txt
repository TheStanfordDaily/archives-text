# LETTERS
## A
						Collection Of By-Words 
### 
Editor, Tin' Daily:
I was aghast at the letter
written to The Daily by Mr.
Evans. The letter is a collection
of twentieth century by-words
such as "obsessed," "warped,"
and "social and intellectual rela
tionships." It appears that Mr.
Evans has either run up against
a good girl or has finally come
to realize the great sorrow that
premarital intercourse can
bring, so now he becomes a
member of the enlightened sex
ual intelligentsia.
To me, his letter is the essence
of hypocrisy. To label the Amer
ican woman as "obsessed," a vic
tim of a Universal Syndrome,
living in a society "increasingly
typified by the contraceptive,
the Frug, and Playboy Maga
zine," is sheer blindness, perhaps
understandable if Mr. Evans
lives in a world of contracep
tives, the Frug and Playboy
Magazine.
What has ho been dying since
discovering girls? Chances are
he hasn't run across a woman
yet. It also appears that Mr.
Evans speaks for that bedrag
gled, strutting group of boys
that can't see past a woman's
body, unable to converse with
her until they've either satisfied
themselves that she isn't good
looking or that she is. Thus the
deplorable condition of the
"modern American woman" he
knows so well.

• A Pathetic Display
Editor, Th«* Daily:
It is obvious that Mr. Tierman
failed to understand Mr. Cow
an's letter. Darrel never asserted
that the war in Vietnam is fun
ny, but rather that the demon
strations were. Indeed, they are
rather humorous in a pathetic
way. It does not take great wis
dom or conviction to see that
war is immoral.
True moral courage comes in
seeing when war may bo neces
sary. But why are all of their
protests so one-sided? Have not
the Viet Cong mutilated, cas
trated, and murdered village
leaders that they believed were
loyal to Saigon? If they protest
racial extermination, why don't
they speak out on the genocide

China is carrying out in Tibet?
No ojie has claimed that
America does not want out of
Vietnam, but can we leave the
Vietnamese subject to the mercy
of Hanoi and Peking? America
must be judged for both its ac
tions and inactions. It is impos
sible not to got involved. If
China were on top, would she
refrain from action? It would
be desirable if we could always
know wo were right in a moral
sense, but, to borrow a phrase
from the National Safety Coun
cil, can we afford to be dead
right? FRED KING
• Columns To Continue
Editor, The Daily:
The new column started in
the spring quarter with the
Congo and Dominican Series is
far from being dead. Foreign
and American students alike are
encouraged to submit articles of
international interest to:
Gwyn Foster XIIBI (I-Ccnterj
Uriah Chinwah 321-9031 (Un
attached)
Dick Ballantine X 4632 (Daily)
It is our hope that such pool
ing of experiences, culling ex
tensively from the international
atmosphere that is Stanford's,
add further to the "enriehening
process."
To this end, articles should
generally be of a first-hand na
ture or derived from intimate
experience. URIAH CHINWAH
• Aii 'Angel's' Friends
Editor, The Daily:
I was surprised to read in The
Chronicle that several members
of the "Republicans for Con
servative Action" had formed a
group called "Friends of the
Hells Angels." I was further
surprised to find that the pur
pose of the group was to raise
bail tor Michael Walter, a Hells
Angel, who is in jail on charges
of assault with a deadly weapon.
Police claim that Walter broke
the leg of a Berkeley policeman
who was protecting the Vietnam
Day marchers. So much for the
conservative campaign to "Sup
port Your Local Police" and
their attacks on "soft" judges
for encouraging hoodlums.
