# Apathy, Activism And 'Pastoral' Living
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
The groups foirned in little
knots beside the fountain, and
the multitude which flowed past
looked about as hard at one as
they did at the other.
The groups were composed
mostly of members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam, which staged a three
day protest here. They were in
White Memorial Plaza and this
was the surprising thing.
It was noon and the little
knots seemed small and incon
gruous in comparison to the
swarming mass, for whom the
plaza is mostly an easy-access
thoroughfare to the post office
and the fraternities and the row
beyond.
Fading Mass
Then the mass faded away,
leaving the plaza—designed to
he the heart of student activity
all but deserted again. Their
scene, which was repeated sev
eral times last week, appeared
innocent enough, but if was not

without significance for Stan
ford.
Dave Ransom, president of
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam, called the pro
test "an experiment in this com
munity."
Indeed, the protest, complete
with an open forum, speeches,
a march to Palo Alto, and a
three-night camp-in, was a first
on the campus, boih in kind and
in extent. Never before had
there been such a prolonged
demonstration at Stanford con
cerning a national issue, and in
a way it seemed strangely out
of place, less like a demonstra
tion than an Alpine Club outing.
'Rampant' Activism
Yes, outing or not, it reflected
the increasing committment to
student activism, an infection
which former Daily editor Bill
Moore thinks is "especially ram
pant" here.
Writing in the May-June issue
of the Stanford Review, he says,
"Ten year's ago professors
around the country were be

moaning student apathy. No
longer. Today's students care
and they are not. reticent about
showing it."
As examples of increased stu
dent involvement, Moore cites
the Stanford participation in the
civil rights movement, in tutu
rial programs for underprivi
leged children in the Bay area,
in the Peace Corps, and in such
projects as Crossroads Africa.
Yes, these activities say little
about the campus itself, where
student ooncern with the outside
world has all too often remained
in the classroom.
A New Dimension
If we are in fact "witnessing
the opening rounds of a student
rebellion," as Moore declares,
then the Vietnam protest adds
a new dimension in bringing it
onto the campus.
But fear not, for there are
built-in mechanisms at Stanford
tending to keep the students
passive and White Memorial
Plaza empty.
Above all, there are the stu

dents themselves.
Lisa Hobbs. a reporter for the
San Francisco Examiner, wrote
after a visit to the Farm last
year thai the students "chit
chatted about trivial things,
looking incredibly healthy, good
looking as they warmed them
selves in the sun." She contin
ued, . . the exploding outside
world has not yet pushed Stan
ford outside of its comfortable
self-made shape."
And Stanford researcher Jo
seph Katz, after conducting an
extensive study at Stanford and
Berkeley, concluded in a report
a few weeks ago that most stu
dents regard a college as "access
to a better job and higher in
come and as a prestigious club
in which one acquires friends,
connections, a mate and may al
so have a good time."
Autonomy ami Apathy
Another guarantee of student
apathy is the concept of the
"autonomous" or residential uni
versity which separates the uni
versity from the rest of society.
According to this philosophy,
the university remains a sepa
rate entity, free to pursue its
scholarly interests, unhampered
by the debilitating influences of
the outside world.

Finally, there is the Old Farm
tradition of pastoral isolation
and Stanford's widespread —
though hopefully decreasing —
reputation as the prestige so
cialite school of the West.
Such considerations would
seem to rule out the events of
last week as no more than a
flash in the pan, a flash prompt
ed by a war at that. But if the
protest was indeed a genuine
indication of increased student
unrest with the world beyond
Palm Drive, it is an auspicious
sign.
Because, as Katz noted, "if we
need il, the university can be
more than a mirror of society.
It can assume the more lively
function of being one of the pri
mary agencies for the renewal
of society and for constructive
change."

day protest here. They were in
White Memorial Plaza and this
was the surprising thing.
It was noon and the little
knots seemed small and incon
gruous in comparison to the
swarming mass, for whom the
plaza is mostly an easy-access
thoroughfare to the post office
and the fraternities and the row
beyond.
Fading Mass
Then the mass faded away,
leaving the plaza—designed to
he the heart of student activity
all but deserted again. Their
scene, which was repeated sev
eral times last week, appeared
innocent enough, but if was not

without significance for Stan
ford.
Dave Ransom, president of
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam, called the pro
test "an experiment in this com
munity."
Indeed, the protest, complete
with an open forum, speeches,
a march to Palo Alto, and a
three-night camp-in, was a first
on the campus, boih in kind and
in extent. Never before had
there been such a prolonged
demonstration at Stanford con
cerning a national issue, and in
a way it seemed strangely out
of place, less like a demonstra
tion than an Alpine Club outing.
'Rampant' Activism
Yes, outing or not, it reflected
the increasing committment to
student activism, an infection
which former Daily editor Bill
Moore thinks is "especially ram
pant" here.
Writing in the May-June issue
of the Stanford Review, he says,
"Ten year's ago professors
around the country were be

moaning student apathy. No
longer. Today's students care
and they are not. reticent about
showing it."
As examples of increased stu
dent involvement, Moore cites
the Stanford participation in the
civil rights movement, in tutu
rial programs for underprivi
leged children in the Bay area,
in the Peace Corps, and in such
projects as Crossroads Africa.
Yes, these activities say little
about the campus itself, where
student ooncern with the outside
world has all too often remained
in the classroom.
A New Dimension
If we are in fact "witnessing
the opening rounds of a student
rebellion," as Moore declares,
then the Vietnam protest adds
a new dimension in bringing it
onto the campus.
But fear not, for there are
built-in mechanisms at Stanford
tending to keep the students
passive and White Memorial
Plaza empty.
Above all, there are the stu

dents themselves.
Lisa Hobbs. a reporter for the
San Francisco Examiner, wrote
after a visit to the Farm last
year thai the students "chit
chatted about trivial things,
looking incredibly healthy, good
looking as they warmed them
selves in the sun." She contin
ued, . . the exploding outside
world has not yet pushed Stan
ford outside of its comfortable
self-made shape."
And Stanford researcher Jo
seph Katz, after conducting an
extensive study at Stanford and
Berkeley, concluded in a report
a few weeks ago that most stu
dents regard a college as "access
to a better job and higher in
come and as a prestigious club
in which one acquires friends,
connections, a mate and may al
so have a good time."
Autonomy ami Apathy
Another guarantee of student
apathy is the concept of the
"autonomous" or residential uni
versity which separates the uni
versity from the rest of society.
According to this philosophy,
the university remains a sepa
rate entity, free to pursue its
scholarly interests, unhampered
by the debilitating influences of
the outside world.

Finally, there is the Old Farm
tradition of pastoral isolation
and Stanford's widespread —
though hopefully decreasing —
reputation as the prestige so
cialite school of the West.
Such considerations would
seem to rule out the events of
last week as no more than a
flash in the pan, a flash prompt
ed by a war at that. But if the
protest was indeed a genuine
indication of increased student
unrest with the world beyond
Palm Drive, it is an auspicious
sign.
Because, as Katz noted, "if we
need il, the university can be
more than a mirror of society.
It can assume the more lively
function of being one of the pri
mary agencies for the renewal
of society and for constructive
change."
The groups foirned in little
knots beside the fountain, and
the multitude which flowed past
looked about as hard at one as
they did at the other.
The groups were composed
mostly of members of the Stan

Then the mass faded away,
leaving the plaza—designed to
he the heart of student activity
all but deserted again. Their
scene, which was repeated sev
eral times last week, appeared
innocent enough, but if was not

without significance for Stan
ford.
Dave Ransom, president of
the Stanford Committee for
Peace in Vietnam, called the pro
test "an experiment in this com
munity."
Indeed, the protest, complete
with an open forum, speeches,
a march to Palo Alto, and a
three-night camp-in, was a first
on the campus, boih in kind and
in extent. Never before had
there been such a prolonged
demonstration at Stanford con
cerning a national issue, and in
a way it seemed strangely out
of place, less like a demonstra
tion than an Alpine Club outing.
'Rampant' Activism
Yes, outing or not, it reflected
the increasing committment to
student activism, an infection
which former Daily editor Bill
Moore thinks is "especially ram
pant" here.
Writing in the May-June issue
of the Stanford Review, he says,
"Ten year's ago professors
around the country were be

moaning student apathy. No
longer. Today's students care
and they are not. reticent about
showing it."
As examples of increased stu
dent involvement, Moore cites
the Stanford participation in the
civil rights movement, in tutu
rial programs for underprivi
leged children in the Bay area,
in the Peace Corps, and in such
projects as Crossroads Africa.
Yes, these activities say little
about the campus itself, where
student ooncern with the outside
world has all too often remained
in the classroom.
A New Dimension
If we are in fact "witnessing
the opening rounds of a student
rebellion," as Moore declares,
then the Vietnam protest adds
a new dimension in bringing it
onto the campus.
But fear not, for there are
built-in mechanisms at Stanford
tending to keep the students
passive and White Memorial
Plaza empty.
Above all, there are the stu

dents themselves.
Lisa Hobbs. a reporter for the
San Francisco Examiner, wrote
after a visit to the Farm last
year thai the students "chit
chatted about trivial things,
looking incredibly healthy, good
looking as they warmed them
selves in the sun." She contin
ued, . . the exploding outside
world has not yet pushed Stan
ford outside of its comfortable
self-made shape."
And Stanford researcher Jo
seph Katz, after conducting an
extensive study at Stanford and
Berkeley, concluded in a report
a few weeks ago that most stu
dents regard a college as "access
to a better job and higher in
come and as a prestigious club
in which one acquires friends,
connections, a mate and may al
so have a good time."
Autonomy ami Apathy
Another guarantee of student
apathy is the concept of the
"autonomous" or residential uni
versity which separates the uni
versity from the rest of society.
According to this philosophy,
the university remains a sepa
rate entity, free to pursue its
scholarly interests, unhampered
by the debilitating influences of
the outside world.

Finally, there is the Old Farm
tradition of pastoral isolation
and Stanford's widespread —
though hopefully decreasing —
reputation as the prestige so
cialite school of the West.
Such considerations would
seem to rule out the events of
last week as no more than a
flash in the pan, a flash prompt
ed by a war at that. But if the
protest was indeed a genuine
indication of increased student
unrest with the world beyond
Palm Drive, it is an auspicious
sign.
Because, as Katz noted, "if we
need il, the university can be
more than a mirror of society.
It can assume the more lively
function of being one of the pri
mary agencies for the renewal
of society and for constructive
change."
The groups foirned in little
knots beside the fountain, and
the multitude which flowed past
looked about as hard at one as
they did at the other.
The groups were composed
mostly of members of the Stan
ford Committee for Peace in
Vietnam, which staged a three
day protest here. They were in
White Memorial Plaza and this
was the surprising thing.
It was noon and the little
knots seemed small and incon
gruous in comparison to the
swarming mass, for whom the
plaza is mostly an easy-access
thoroughfare to the post office
and the fraternities and the row
beyond.
