# Ruby Trail Errors Topic Of Review
## 
### 
A Stanford Law School professor
has commented that the trial of Jack
Ruby for the murder of Lee Harvey
Oswald has shed little credit on the
nation's legal profession.
Professor John Kaplan of Stanford
and Jon R. Waltz of the Northwestern
Law School reached the conclusion in
their book The Trial ol' Jack Ruby,
scheduled for publication Oct. 25.
The authors have concluded that
many factors, some common to all
trials and others caused by the strange
antics of the participants, led the jury

to return the surprising death penalty
verdict.
Tactical Krrurs
According to the law professors,
Judge Joe B. Brown not only failed to
maintain court room decorum and
often allowed the level of the trial to
deteriorate into shouting matches be
tween the attorneys, but also contrib
uted to several tactical errors on the
part of Defense Attorney Melvin Belli.
Misled by Judge Brown into believ
ing that the trial would be moved out
of Dallas, Belli did not try overly hard
to pick a jury favorable to his client.
The judge, however, was in no way to
blame for Belli's most fateful deci
sion to rely on the all or nothing
defense that Ruby had shot Oswald
while in an epileptic seizure.
After examining the psychomotor
epilepsy defense, the authors con
cluded that not only did it play inlo
the hands of the prosecution, but that
it was a relatively unlikely possibility.
Though Ruby was certainly abnor
mal and unstable, his crime was more
likely the result of his passion for self
glorification and his explosive temper
"a complex inter-action between
what lie was and the stress of the con
frontation with Oswald in the base
ment of the jail."
Plot Killed Out
Similarly the authors rule out any
substantial possibility that Ruby had
participated in a plot to assassinate
President John F. Kennedy. First, the
entire background of the Dallas night
club owner was inconsistent with such
hii action and second, he was such a
"loud, boastful, compulsive talker and
name-dropper" that no rational con
spirator would allow him into any
kind of conspiracy.
According 10 the two professors, de
spite the death penalty verdict, there
is very little likelihood that Ruby will
ever be executed for his crime. Even
if the case is eventually affirmed, the
appellate process will take several
years, by which time "feeling will have
cooled."

cluded that not only did it play inlo
the hands of the prosecution, but that
it was a relatively unlikely possibility.
Though Ruby was certainly abnor
mal and unstable, his crime was more
likely the result of his passion for self
glorification and his explosive temper
"a complex inter-action between
what lie was and the stress of the con
frontation with Oswald in the base
ment of the jail."
Plot Killed Out
Similarly the authors rule out any
substantial possibility that Ruby had
participated in a plot to assassinate
President John F. Kennedy. First, the
entire background of the Dallas night
club owner was inconsistent with such
hii action and second, he was such a
"loud, boastful, compulsive talker and
name-dropper" that no rational con
spirator would allow him into any
kind of conspiracy.
According 10 the two professors, de
spite the death penalty verdict, there
is very little likelihood that Ruby will
ever be executed for his crime. Even
if the case is eventually affirmed, the
appellate process will take several
years, by which time "feeling will have
cooled."
A Stanford Law School professor
has commented that the trial of Jack
Ruby for the murder of Lee Harvey
Oswald has shed little credit on the
nation's legal profession.
Professor John Kaplan of Stanford
and Jon R. Waltz of the Northwestern
Law School reached the conclusion in
their book The Trial ol' Jack Ruby,
scheduled for publication Oct. 25.
The authors have concluded that
many factors, some common to all
trials and others caused by the strange
antics of the participants, led the jury

to return the surprising death penalty
verdict.
Tactical Krrurs
According to the law professors,
Judge Joe B. Brown not only failed to
maintain court room decorum and
often allowed the level of the trial to
deteriorate into shouting matches be
tween the attorneys, but also contrib
uted to several tactical errors on the
part of Defense Attorney Melvin Belli.
Misled by Judge Brown into believ
ing that the trial would be moved out
of Dallas, Belli did not try overly hard
to pick a jury favorable to his client.
The judge, however, was in no way to
blame for Belli's most fateful deci
sion to rely on the all or nothing
defense that Ruby had shot Oswald
while in an epileptic seizure.
After examining the psychomotor
epilepsy defense, the authors con
cluded that not only did it play inlo
the hands of the prosecution, but that
it was a relatively unlikely possibility.
