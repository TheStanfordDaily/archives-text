# LIGHT AT LAST
## Power Lines Raised 
### JOHN BUZAN 
After two years of bitter struggle,
the power lines for the Stanford Lin
car Accelerator Center (SLAC) are at
last being installed.
Originally, Pacific Gas and Electric
held a contract from the Atomic En
ergy Commission to install these lines.
The lines were never built—due to
the strenuous opposition of civic
groups in Woodside, through which
the lines had to go.
PG&E lost the contract for non
fulfillment.
The AEC attempted to clamp down
on Woodside through the federal
"right of eminent domain" —guaran-
teed under Article VI of the Constitu
tioif.
All went well until Woodside, em
ploying the services of attorneys Paul
McCloskey and Austin Clapp, ob
tained a reversal of the court order
allowing the AEC's condemnation of
land.
As it turned out, the enabling act
of the AEC restricted the commission
from employing the "right of eminent
domain."
That is the way in which the Fed
eral Appellate Court interpreted the
act.
The original sponsors of that legis
lation, upset at the "misreading" of
it. last month obtained this an amend
ment.
According to them, the original act
had not been meant to restrict the
right of eminent domain from any

facility of the AEC not in competition
for the sale of power with public
utilities.
The various groups of Woodside
opposition sought; and did not obtain
an injunction to give them time for
an appeal.
Sensing the turning tide, Woodside
appealed to the President of the
United States.
The President's decision was that
in five to seven years, if and when
Woodside makes a common practice
of burying transmission lines, then
the AEC will do likewise.
Meanwhile, the AEC is building the
above-ground poles and lines.
Work began last week.
