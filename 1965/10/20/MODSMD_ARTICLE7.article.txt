# New Science Building Has Beautiful Future
## 
### 
Nobel Laureate William Shockley
• forecast a brilliant future for the now
research field of materials science
yesterday afternoon at the dedciation
of Stanford University's $2.5 million
Jack A. McCullough Building.
Serving as headquarters of Stan
lord's new Center for Materials Re
search, the four-story building will
house faculty from engineering, phys
ics, chemistry, and other academic de
partments collaborating in materials
research.
Prof. Shockley, who holds the
Alexander M. Poniatoff chair of engi
neering and applied science, was the
principal speaker at the ceremonies
conducted by Stanford President Wal
lace Sterling. Other speakers included
Jack A. McCuHough, founder of Eitel-
McCullough Inc. and principal private
donor of the building; Richard E.
Guggenhime, president of the Stan
ford Board of Trustees; and Board
member David Packard.
One Prediction
Prof. Shockley ventured "only one
prediction" of things to come in the
swiftly advancing field of materials
science.
"These will not be results that we
can foresee now," he said, "but. will
involve new and unexpected discov
eries and developments. Only the gen
eral areas in which improvements will
be achieved can be foreseen, such as
strength of materials, their resistance
to fatigue, and their ability to per
form electrical and magnetic tasks
more efficiently and in a smaller
space."
Prof. Shockley, who won the 19.36
IV > be I Prize for his part in developing
tlie first transistors, likened the state
of materials science research to that
of pre-transistor semiconductor re
search.
Holes and Electrons
"Before the first transistor was
made, 'holes' and 'excess electrons' in
semiconductors were mysterious the
oretical concepts employed in basic
research," he said. "Today electrical
engineers use holes and excess elec
trons in their everyday job of making
computers for business and research."
Present research in materials sci
ence involves even more enigmatic
concepts to explain electrical phenom
ena going on inside semiconducting
solids, he pointed out.
"Of increasing importance both the
oretically and practically, for exam
ple, is the detailed structure of so
called energy bands," he continued.
"These bands may be crudely de
scribed as tlie architectural plan of
an elaborate parking garage in which
the vehicles are electrons.
(iunn Effect
"Furthermore, if these architectur
al features have the proper charac

teristics, something called the 'Gunn
effect' occurs and microwaves oscil
late through the entire bulk ol the
material. This effect promises to per
mit far-reaching new uses of semi
conductors in the communications
and computer fields.
"One outstanding example of this is
the interpretive work of Prof. Gerald
Pearsons' group here at Stanford.
They have clearly elucidated several
aspects of these microwave oscilla
tions by producing new materials of
the gallium-arsenide-phosphide fam
ily. straining them elastically, and
measuring the oscillations electrical
ly. To create such materials with the
proper electrical characteristics and
to understand them theoretically re

quired knowledge from a number of
scientific fields.
"Thus effective discoveries in mate
rials science demand a combination ot
the disciplines of physics, chemistry,
electrical engineering, and mathemat
ical analysis including computer cal
culations. As the science of materials
advances, a wider variety of knowl
edge and theory can be put to use.
Accelerate Research
"Ground-breaking advances of this
sort are being made possible at Stan
ford by the McCullough Building and
its Center for Materials Research. The
Center's activities will accelerate the
research already set in motion here
by support of the Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA)."

Nobel Laureate William Shockley
• forecast a brilliant future for the now
research field of materials science
yesterday afternoon at the dedciation
of Stanford University's $2.5 million
Jack A. McCullough Building.
Serving as headquarters of Stan
lord's new Center for Materials Re
search, the four-story building will
house faculty from engineering, phys
ics, chemistry, and other academic de
partments collaborating in materials
research.
Prof. Shockley, who holds the
Alexander M. Poniatoff chair of engi
neering and applied science, was the
principal speaker at the ceremonies
conducted by Stanford President Wal
lace Sterling. Other speakers included
Jack A. McCuHough, founder of Eitel-
McCullough Inc. and principal private
donor of the building; Richard E.
Guggenhime, president of the Stan
ford Board of Trustees; and Board
member David Packard.
One Prediction
Prof. Shockley ventured "only one
prediction" of things to come in the
swiftly advancing field of materials
science.
"These will not be results that we
can foresee now," he said, "but. will
involve new and unexpected discov
eries and developments. Only the gen
eral areas in which improvements will
be achieved can be foreseen, such as
strength of materials, their resistance
to fatigue, and their ability to per
form electrical and magnetic tasks
more efficiently and in a smaller
space."
Prof. Shockley, who won the 19.36
IV > be I Prize for his part in developing
tlie first transistors, likened the state
of materials science research to that
of pre-transistor semiconductor re
search.
Holes and Electrons
"Before the first transistor was
made, 'holes' and 'excess electrons' in
semiconductors were mysterious the
oretical concepts employed in basic
research," he said. "Today electrical
engineers use holes and excess elec
trons in their everyday job of making
computers for business and research."
Present research in materials sci
ence involves even more enigmatic
concepts to explain electrical phenom
ena going on inside semiconducting
solids, he pointed out.
"Of increasing importance both the
oretically and practically, for exam
ple, is the detailed structure of so
called energy bands," he continued.
"These bands may be crudely de
scribed as tlie architectural plan of
an elaborate parking garage in which
the vehicles are electrons.
