# Branner Vietnam Lecture
## 
### 
Last night a lecture was given at
Branner Hall on the involvment of
the United States in the Vietnam War.
The speaker was Capt. James Bayer,
now an instructor in the Stanford
Army ROTC Program, who was
wounded twice in World War II and
one** in Vietnam, earning him the
Purple Heart three times. He also
won the Bronze Star for valor in Viet
nam.
During his lecture Capt. Bayer
stressed the importance of working
with the South Vietnamese at the
"Hamlet level". The Advisor must
work directly with the common
people, and his job is very difficult
because he can only advise and never
command, since he holds no command
position.
He must improve the economic po
sition of the Vietnamese peasant in
addition to providing military advice.
He initiates Agriculture and Health
Service reforms. Capt. Bayer pointed
out that when he first arrived in his
district, the population of 400,000 was
served by only two doctors. "We work
with the people; we find out their
needs and try to fulfill them", he said.
"We don't dare play God."
Capt. Bayer also stressed the im
portance of winning the South Viet
namese youth to the American side.
He said that the Vietnamese youth
is much more constructive and pro
gressive than the older generations.
The key lo winning the war is the
youth. When the young men become
active in Hamlet government, things
get done.
