# LITERARY REVIEW
## Humility In Workshop 
### LESLIE DESMOND 
"Burning Bright," by L. M. Smith,
an uproarious satire on literary style,
is the high point in the latest issue
of The Stanford Workshop.
This "Essay in Footnotes on the
Romance of the Biography . . clev
erly and completely smashes the sym
bolism, metaphors and verbosity too
often used in modern literature.
..A Fortunate Kiul
The essay, unfortunately or fortu
nately, depending on one's viewpoint,
follows a collection of articles similar
1o those in previous workshops.
Those concern mainly personal rela
tionships. i.e.. love, sex and commu
nication. Most valid is the short story,
"Eve" by the editor, Henry Alley.
Using simple language to create a
common situation. Alley points out
man's need for communication with
others for an understanding of him
self. The story revolves around Sam
uel, a shoe clerk leading a routine
life, and his reactions when meeting
George, a perceptive sidewalk apple
seller.
Samuel is settled in the security of
his job; his guilt over this empty rou
tine is erased by "his nightly readings
of poetry." A dream, picturing Sam
uel in a garden of Kden which sud
denly turns to a dark and smoking

hell, returns to him, increasing his
disdain for life. George, a sidewalk
peddler who feels a contact with peo
ple, encourages Samuel to begin
living.
"II You Leave . .
"11 you leave this place, which is a
nice place, people will crucify you as
sure as the world. But then you'll
know what 1 think I know now about
people. And. then, maybe, you'll know
yourself too." Consequently. Samuel
quits his job and overcomes his inse
curity in facing people. "Yes. walk out
into eve. Pluck the apple from the
incense tree of wisdom. No. he hadn't
been cheated. Now he had the whole
world to gain."
Depending on thought and situation
rather than mere words, Alley coveys
his message simply and effectively.
"Holyrood - ' a sonnet by Katherine
Macfarlane. forces the reader to plow
through a load of verbage, however
lyrical and euphonic, to derive its con
tent. which remain unclear after four
readings. Perhaps a cursory glance at
Smith's "Buring Blight" would be in
order.
Flowery language is also used in
"Sonnet I." by Li. J. Savery, but here
it adds to the meaning. Romantic love,
"the unsubstantial pap of 'June' and
'spoon' " has no importance; the con
crete. earthy and uncouth aspects of
love, i.e. sex. constitute reality. "Why
build your verbal monoliths on rot of
bowers? Talk of copulation sot!" The
content, however, controversial, re
mains clear.
Success In ('oinpiliny
The success of this issue lies in iis
compilation. The Workshop staff col
ored each red tipple to illustrate Son
net I. Moreover, Alley introduces
eight articles, which alone would
make uu a typical hsue of the Work

shop. But ho drops ii bomb at the end
of the issue in the form of u satire
on the style used in much of Ihe pre
ceding work. Alley himself survives
this criticism most completely, due t<>
his simple and clear style, but the
wordier authors, in reading "Burning
Bright" must feel a bit shot down.
Did Alley include "Burning Bright*'
to underline the quality of his own
writing? Perhaps not Nevertheless,
he has created a Workshop with a
surprising amount of unity, humor,
and a touch of humility -a unique
feat in workshop history.

The essay, unfortunately or fortu
nately, depending on one's viewpoint,
follows a collection of articles similar
1o those in previous workshops.
Those concern mainly personal rela
tionships. i.e.. love, sex and commu
nication. Most valid is the short story,
"Eve" by the editor, Henry Alley.
Using simple language to create a
common situation. Alley points out
man's need for communication with
others for an understanding of him
self. The story revolves around Sam
uel, a shoe clerk leading a routine
life, and his reactions when meeting
George, a perceptive sidewalk apple
seller.
Samuel is settled in the security of
his job; his guilt over this empty rou
tine is erased by "his nightly readings
of poetry." A dream, picturing Sam
uel in a garden of Kden which sud
denly turns to a dark and smoking

hell, returns to him, increasing his
disdain for life. George, a sidewalk
peddler who feels a contact with peo
ple, encourages Samuel to begin
living.

"11 you leave this place, which is a
nice place, people will crucify you as

know what 1 think I know now about
people. And. then, maybe, you'll know
yourself too." Consequently. Samuel
quits his job and overcomes his inse
curity in facing people. "Yes. walk out
into eve. Pluck the apple from the
incense tree of wisdom. No. he hadn't
been cheated. Now he had the whole
world to gain."
Depending on thought and situation
rather than mere words, Alley coveys
his message simply and effectively.
