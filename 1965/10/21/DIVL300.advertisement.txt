The Last Straw
From the moment of birth, man begins to die. Death is not a stianger awaiting us
at the grave- the funera is only the lust straw. Death in its common forms is familiar to
us all, for df'th is boieooi anxiety, emptiness, loneliness and despaii. Death the Bible
says, is a result of sin ( 'The waaes of sin is death . . . Romans 6:23), and sin is a
virus-like infection which has invaded man cutting Him off from his Creator who alone
has immortal lift-. L k»■ ml uprooted prematurely from the soil, man begins to die
from birth and continues to die forever unless he returns to God for reconciliation. The
words of God to our forefather Adam indicate that paths of independence from God
always lead to death: 'You may freely eat ot every tree in the garden,- but of the tree
of the knowledge ol good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it
dying you shall die" (Genesis 2:15-17).
As everyone can plainly see, death has now spread from Adam to all men. ... As
sin crime into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread
to all men because all men sinned' . . (Romans 5:12). But God s provision for man's
needs and God's lovi is more than able to completely reveise the desperate plight
of individuals who turn to Him. ' While we were yet helpless at the right time Christ
died for the ungodiy (Romans 5:6). Thus, although 'the wages of sin is death", "the
free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23). Like accept
ing any other free gift, this free gift from God is simply received by reaching out to
Jesus Christ taking what he offers and expressing a word of thanks.
The renewal and restoration which Jesus Christ brings all those who come to Him
in faith is the most wonderful experience a human being can know. The God of the
Bible meets men solely because He is merciful and concerned, not because of our merits
or basic worth, we have none. His love has gone to the limits of giving His own life
in exchange for yours. Be-ause Jesus Christ has already died your death for you. you are
fre? to come to Him for life everlasting (which begins here and now) Why delay any
longer when your life is at stake?

of the knowledge ol good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it
dying you shall die" (Genesis 2:15-17).
As everyone can plainly see, death has now spread from Adam to all men. ... As
sin crime into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread
to all men because all men sinned' . . (Romans 5:12). But God s provision for man's
needs and God's lovi is more than able to completely reveise the desperate plight
of individuals who turn to Him. ' While we were yet helpless at the right time Christ
died for the ungodiy (Romans 5:6). Thus, although 'the wages of sin is death", "the
free gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Romans 6:23). Like accept
ing any other free gift, this free gift from God is simply received by reaching out to
Jesus Christ taking what he offers and expressing a word of thanks.
The renewal and restoration which Jesus Christ brings all those who come to Him
in faith is the most wonderful experience a human being can know. The God of the
Bible meets men solely because He is merciful and concerned, not because of our merits
or basic worth, we have none. His love has gone to the limits of giving His own life
in exchange for yours. Be-ause Jesus Christ has already died your death for you. you are
fre? to come to Him for life everlasting (which begins here and now) Why delay any
longer when your life is at stake?

The Last Straw
From the moment of birth, man begins to die. Death is not a stianger awaiting us
at the grave- the funera is only the lust straw. Death in its common forms is familiar to
us all, for df'th is boieooi anxiety, emptiness, loneliness and despaii. Death the Bible
says, is a result of sin ( 'The waaes of sin is death . . . Romans 6:23), and sin is a
virus-like infection which has invaded man cutting Him off from his Creator who alone
has immortal lift-. L k»■ ml uprooted prematurely from the soil, man begins to die
from birth and continues to die forever unless he returns to God for reconciliation. The
words of God to our forefather Adam indicate that paths of independence from God
always lead to death: 'You may freely eat ot every tree in the garden,- but of the tree
of the knowledge ol good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it
dying you shall die" (Genesis 2:15-17).
As everyone can plainly see, death has now spread from Adam to all men. ... As
