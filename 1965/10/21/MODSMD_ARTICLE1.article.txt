• Allen Election Hid Halletl
SAN FRANCISCO The Cali
fornia Supreme Court ruled yester
day that comedian Steve Allen can
not be a Democratic candidate for tin 1
congressional seal vacated by James
Roosevelt.
His running depended on the Su
preme Court ruling to set aside the
state law requirement that a candi
date be a registered member of the
party in which he runs for at. least
90 days before election.
Allen, although active in Demo
cratic Party causes for several years,
was registered as a non-partisan until
Sept. 18 when he switched his regis
tration.
