# KZSU Keeps On Growing
## 
### RICH TOWER 
Something is going on under
neath Memorial Auditorium:
speeches, classical concerts, foot
ball games, folk music, jazz.
What is it? KZSU, Stanford's
student-operated radio station, is
back on the air. Broadcasting to
Stanford dormitories at 880 on
the AM dial and to the surround
ing community at 90.1 FM,
KZSU offers diverse program
ming in music and public affairs.
It's no simple job to operate
a radio station. This one takes
the efforts of 170 students and
costs some five thousand dollars
a year to keep on the air. Pro
grams must be planned, news
must be prepared, equipment
kept in repair, continuity pre
served. All this takes the special
talents of many people.
The station was not always
this big. KZSU began shortly
after World War II as a small,
student-oriented station and re
mained as such for a number of
years. However, in the past
three years Ihe station's staff
has increased six-fold, and in
1964, with the start of FM
broadcasting, KZSU gained an
estimated potential audience of
200,000.
Run by Students
The station is owned by the
trustees of the University, but
the responsibility of running it
is entirely the students'. No out
side help, other than the print
ing of the program guide, is
Used. Expenses are paid for en
tirely by advertising revenue,
and money for capital improve
ments is raised by public con
certs and tape recording serv
ices offered by the station.
KZSU draws its programming
from the vast resources of the
University, a unique advantage.
Every weekday, starting at 4
p.m., the station schedules two
hours of folk music, followed
by an hour of dinner music. At
seven o'clock, two and a half
hours of public affairs are pre
sented, followed by one and a
half hours of jazz. From eleven
o'clock until sign-off time at
one-thirty, a classical concert is
given. At five minutes before
every hour, the news is present
ed. Every program is narrated
by a student interested in the
field, and since weekly programs

are the rule, every night has a
different and personal sound.
Variety in Programming
During the public affairs show,
important speeches given on the
campus are rebroadeast and spe
cial programs of University in
terest are given, while the news
programs feature comments and
clarifications of current events
by Stanford professors and stu
dents. On Saturdays, home foot
hall games are broadcast live,
while on Sundays, programming
includes the Memorial Church
service at eleven.
With so many different pro
grams, KZSU draws together
students with various ideas on
how the station should be run.
Steve Beach is one. With J. Mil
ton Forester, he does the "Road
runner Show" every Saturday
night at eight. The show, aimed

at Stanford's "socially depressed
zone." fealures a college outlook
on rock and roll ("no Neil Se
daka"), a freedom from the cur
rent hit parade, and less talk
than on commercial stations.
What talk there is can perhaps
best be defined as "verbal brink
manship." It is Steve Beach's
idea thai college radio can pro
vide <'» better entertainment out
let than can the commercial sta
tions, and that this advantage
should be utilized.
Students Choose Music
Offering entertainment from
a different angle is Bruce
Wheat on, head of the classical
music department. The depart
ment offers six shows a week
and has a thousand record li
brary. In addition to these rec
ords, students doing the shows
draw from their own libraries.

Each student picks which rec
ords he will play and is free to
give a subjective interpretation
of the program material. This
reservoir of talent, combined
with the freedom to give one's
own analysis, Mr. Wheat on
feels, are important advantages
of KZSU.
Station Manager Penny Niland
stresses the station's connection
to the University. She feels that
the station should serve as an
outlet for the constant flow of
ideas in the community, and, she
points out. the station has be
come a forum for discussion of
many of Stanford's problems. It
is for these reasons, she says,
that KZSU, licensed as an educa
tional station, gives its prime
evening listening time to public
affairs.
Station lias Obligation
Also important, Miss Niland
explains, is the fact that the
station now broadcasts off the
campus over its FM channel.
KZSU is now heard on the lower
peninsula, the Oakland hills, and
the top of Mt. Tamalpias, sixty
miles to the north. The station,
she feels, should present suit
able programming in its role as
a University voice to the outly
ing community. As an obligation
to its listeners, a smooth con
tinuity should be preserved.
The station is run by ama
teurs; in fact, there is only one
communications major among
the officers. Some mistakes are
made. Even so, the station con
sistently presents a slate of vital
and interesting programs. Per
haps Peggy Niland best sums up
the staff's feelings: "There are
many places where a person can
go on the dial if he wants to
turn hus mind off. I don't see
why we should be one of them."

peninsula, the Oakland hills, and
the top of Mt. Tamalpias, sixty
miles to the north. The station,
she feels, should present suit
able programming in its role as
a University voice to the outly
ing community. As an obligation
to its listeners, a smooth con
tinuity should be preserved.
The station is run by ama
teurs; in fact, there is only one
communications major among
the officers. Some mistakes are
made. Even so, the station con
sistently presents a slate of vital
and interesting programs. Per
haps Peggy Niland best sums up
the staff's feelings: "There are
many places where a person can
go on the dial if he wants to
turn hus mind off. I don't see
why we should be one of them."
Something is going on under
neath Memorial Auditorium:
speeches, classical concerts, foot
ball games, folk music, jazz.
What is it? KZSU, Stanford's
student-operated radio station, is
back on the air. Broadcasting to
Stanford dormitories at 880 on
the AM dial and to the surround
ing community at 90.1 FM,
KZSU offers diverse program
ming in music and public affairs.
It's no simple job to operate
a radio station. This one takes
the efforts of 170 students and
costs some five thousand dollars
a year to keep on the air. Pro
grams must be planned, news
must be prepared, equipment
kept in repair, continuity pre
served. All this takes the special
talents of many people.
The station was not always
this big. KZSU began shortly
after World War II as a small,
student-oriented station and re
mained as such for a number of
years. However, in the past
three years Ihe station's staff
has increased six-fold, and in
1964, with the start of FM
broadcasting, KZSU gained an
estimated potential audience of
200,000.
Run by Students
The station is owned by the
trustees of the University, but
the responsibility of running it
is entirely the students'. No out
side help, other than the print
ing of the program guide, is
Used. Expenses are paid for en
tirely by advertising revenue,
and money for capital improve
ments is raised by public con
certs and tape recording serv
ices offered by the station.
KZSU draws its programming
from the vast resources of the
University, a unique advantage.
Every weekday, starting at 4
p.m., the station schedules two
hours of folk music, followed
by an hour of dinner music. At
seven o'clock, two and a half
hours of public affairs are pre
sented, followed by one and a
half hours of jazz. From eleven
o'clock until sign-off time at
one-thirty, a classical concert is
given. At five minutes before
every hour, the news is present
ed. Every program is narrated
by a student interested in the
field, and since weekly programs

are the rule, every night has a
different and personal sound.
Variety in Programming
During the public affairs show,
important speeches given on the
campus are rebroadeast and spe
cial programs of University in
terest are given, while the news
programs feature comments and
clarifications of current events
by Stanford professors and stu
dents. On Saturdays, home foot
hall games are broadcast live,
while on Sundays, programming
includes the Memorial Church
service at eleven.
With so many different pro
grams, KZSU draws together
students with various ideas on
how the station should be run.
Steve Beach is one. With J. Mil
ton Forester, he does the "Road
runner Show" every Saturday
night at eight. The show, aimed

at Stanford's "socially depressed
zone." fealures a college outlook
on rock and roll ("no Neil Se
daka"), a freedom from the cur
rent hit parade, and less talk
than on commercial stations.
What talk there is can perhaps
best be defined as "verbal brink
manship." It is Steve Beach's
idea thai college radio can pro
vide <'» better entertainment out
let than can the commercial sta
tions, and that this advantage
should be utilized.
Students Choose Music
Offering entertainment from
a different angle is Bruce
Wheat on, head of the classical
music department. The depart
ment offers six shows a week
and has a thousand record li
brary. In addition to these rec
ords, students doing the shows
draw from their own libraries.

Each student picks which rec
ords he will play and is free to
give a subjective interpretation
of the program material. This
reservoir of talent, combined
with the freedom to give one's
own analysis, Mr. Wheat on
feels, are important advantages
of KZSU.
Station Manager Penny Niland
stresses the station's connection
to the University. She feels that
the station should serve as an
outlet for the constant flow of
ideas in the community, and, she
points out. the station has be
come a forum for discussion of
many of Stanford's problems. It
is for these reasons, she says,
that KZSU, licensed as an educa
tional station, gives its prime
evening listening time to public
affairs.
Station lias Obligation
Also important, Miss Niland
explains, is the fact that the
station now broadcasts off the
campus over its FM channel.

reservoir of talent, combined
with the freedom to give one's
own analysis, Mr. Wheat on
feels, are important advantages
of KZSU.
Station Manager Penny Niland
stresses the station's connection
to the University. She feels that
the station should serve as an
outlet for the constant flow of
ideas in the community, and, she
points out. the station has be
come a forum for discussion of
many of Stanford's problems. It
is for these reasons, she says,
that KZSU, licensed as an educa
tional station, gives its prime
evening listening time to public
affairs.
Station lias Obligation
Also important, Miss Niland
explains, is the fact that the
station now broadcasts off the
campus over its FM channel.
KZSU is now heard on the lower
peninsula, the Oakland hills, and
the top of Mt. Tamalpias, sixty
miles to the north. The station,
she feels, should present suit
able programming in its role as
a University voice to the outly
ing community. As an obligation
to its listeners, a smooth con
tinuity should be preserved.
The station is run by ama
teurs; in fact, there is only one
communications major among
the officers. Some mistakes are
made. Even so, the station con
sistently presents a slate of vital
and interesting programs. Per
haps Peggy Niland best sums up
the staff's feelings: "There are
many places where a person can
go on the dial if he wants to
turn hus mind off. I don't see
why we should be one of them."
Something is going on under
neath Memorial Auditorium:
speeches, classical concerts, foot
ball games, folk music, jazz.
What is it? KZSU, Stanford's
student-operated radio station, is
back on the air. Broadcasting to
Stanford dormitories at 880 on
the AM dial and to the surround
ing community at 90.1 FM,
KZSU offers diverse program
ming in music and public affairs.
It's no simple job to operate
a radio station. This one takes
the efforts of 170 students and
costs some five thousand dollars
a year to keep on the air. Pro
grams must be planned, news
must be prepared, equipment
kept in repair, continuity pre
served. All this takes the special
talents of many people.
The station was not always
this big. KZSU began shortly
after World War II as a small,
student-oriented station and re
mained as such for a number of
years. However, in the past
three years Ihe station's staff
has increased six-fold, and in
1964, with the start of FM
broadcasting, KZSU gained an
estimated potential audience of
200,000.
Run by Students
The station is owned by the
trustees of the University, but
the responsibility of running it
is entirely the students'. No out
side help, other than the print
ing of the program guide, is
Used. Expenses are paid for en
tirely by advertising revenue,
and money for capital improve
ments is raised by public con
certs and tape recording serv
ices offered by the station.
KZSU draws its programming
from the vast resources of the
University, a unique advantage.
Every weekday, starting at 4
p.m., the station schedules two
hours of folk music, followed
by an hour of dinner music. At
seven o'clock, two and a half
hours of public affairs are pre
sented, followed by one and a
half hours of jazz. From eleven
o'clock until sign-off time at
one-thirty, a classical concert is
given. At five minutes before
every hour, the news is present
ed. Every program is narrated
by a student interested in the
field, and since weekly programs

are the rule, every night has a
different and personal sound.
Variety in Programming
During the public affairs show,
important speeches given on the
campus are rebroadeast and spe
cial programs of University in
terest are given, while the news
programs feature comments and
clarifications of current events
by Stanford professors and stu
dents. On Saturdays, home foot
hall games are broadcast live,
while on Sundays, programming
includes the Memorial Church
service at eleven.
With so many different pro
grams, KZSU draws together
students with various ideas on
how the station should be run.
Steve Beach is one. With J. Mil
ton Forester, he does the "Road
runner Show" every Saturday
night at eight. The show, aimed

at Stanford's "socially depressed
zone." fealures a college outlook
on rock and roll ("no Neil Se
daka"), a freedom from the cur
rent hit parade, and less talk
than on commercial stations.
What talk there is can perhaps
best be defined as "verbal brink
manship." It is Steve Beach's
idea thai college radio can pro
vide <'» better entertainment out
let than can the commercial sta
tions, and that this advantage
should be utilized.
Students Choose Music
Offering entertainment from
a different angle is Bruce
Wheat on, head of the classical
music department. The depart
ment offers six shows a week
and has a thousand record li
brary. In addition to these rec
ords, students doing the shows
draw from their own libraries.

Each student picks which rec
ords he will play and is free to
give a subjective interpretation
of the program material. This
reservoir of talent, combined
with the freedom to give one's
own analysis, Mr. Wheat on
feels, are important advantages
of KZSU.
