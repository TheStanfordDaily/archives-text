# 'New Wave' Washes Over Moviemakers
## 
### ANNE BROPHY 
The fad of "New Wave
Movies" has come to Stanford.
The new credo of the film de
partment is "Get out and shoot!"
Inspired students are using
8 mm movie cameras to shoot
everything from surrealistic
fantasy to the rhythmic pat
terns of back-breaking crew
practice. Professor George
Stoney, a movie documentarian
in his own right, is directing tlie
students.
Nationally, the upsurge of
student interest in film produc
tion is thought to be an exten
sion of their involvement in
social issues and protest. Indi
viduals in college communities
have adopted film as a medium
to express their opinions about
the way the world is, or should
be. Former Stanford Professor
Henery Breitrosc calls the move
ment "a method of expression in
terms of art and communica
tion."
Movies Creative
Stoney stresses the import
ance of intellectual and creative
talent, rather than technical

skill. "Get out and shoot what
interests you, find some excite
ment and capture it,"he says.
"The ideal film," according to
Stoney, "shapes without the tool
marks showing. Its viewpoint
involves the viewer, makes him
identify with what you feel, and
brings him joy."
Stoney's students match his
enthusiasm for the individual
istic approach as they prepare
ideas for the production of their
own short features. English ma
jor Paul Haley, for example, is
creating a film inspired by Rob
ert Frost's poem "The Mending
Wall." In the film he hopes to
present the walls that people
build and the forces which in
turn tear them down. "Before
you build a wall," he comments,
"you must know what you are
walling out and what you are
walling in."
In another feature, a student
pursues the frustrations of an
unfulfilled relationship, show
ing a couple who wander
through a zoo, each involved in
an individual dream-world of
fantasy.
