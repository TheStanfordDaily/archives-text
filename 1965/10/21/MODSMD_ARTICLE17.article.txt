# Rivers Analyzes News
## 
### 
Washington news is "manag
ed" long before it gets to re
porters and correspondents, so
that we live in a "synthetic
world," Associate Prof. William
Rivers of Stanford's Communi
cation Department declares in a
new book.
The need for hard-digging re
porters, experts in special fields
of government who can write an
interpretive story, is greater
than it ever was, Professor
Rivers writes in "The Opinion
makers," published last week by
Beacon Press, Boston (207 pp.,
$4.95).
Some sections of the press
still inject their own bias into
a story although the picture
is far better now than it was 25
years ago, Professor Rivers be
lieves.
Rivers himself was one of the
first Congressional interns sent
to Washington 10 years ago by
the American Political Science
Association. He was later a cor
respondent for The Reporter
Magazine and has contributed
many articles to Harper's, The
Nation, The New York Times

Magazine, and others.
His hook describes the Wash
ington press scene, with specific
attention to Walter Lippman,
James Rest on and the New York
Times, David Brinkley, Time
Magazine and Drew Pearson.
Of Lippman, he says:"The
style is the man; lucid expres
sion is the flesh of complex ideas
that grow from sentence to sen
tence like a coral reef."
Of Rest on and The New York
Times: "Reston's example has
stiffened the backbone of many
a correspondent facing high of
ficialdom . . . For governments
here and abroad, the Times is
the one indispensable news
paper."
Of David Brinkley: "no one
can match his wry humor . . .
He is intensly proud of the fact
that he writes every word he
says on the air."
Of Time Magazine and Drew
Pearson: "Both are flagrantly
biased aftd avidly read by the
Washington press corps. No one
in Washington can afford to
ignore either . . . despite biases
and distortions, they are the

most affecting reporters of
politics at work today . . . They
art 1 regarded with suspicion and
hypnotized attention."
Professor Rivers paints a
vivid contract between President
Kennedy and President Johnson.
President Kennedy, once
briefly a London correspondent
for Hearst's International News
Service after the war, was a re
sounding success with the press
corps because he had an intense
appreciation of the reporter's
job, understood the power of tlie
mass media, and had "a fine
sense of history."
President Johnson, on the
other hand, "will never achieve
Kennedy's success . . . he is in
capable of personal chargin . . .
(because) he views the press as
a tool.
"If reporters become increas
ingly antagonistic, the day may
come when Mr. Johnson reverts
to an attitude he sometimes ex
pressed when he was majority
leader: Washington correspond
ents are hirelings who twist the
news to suit, the biases of their
employers."

a correspondent facing high of
ficialdom . . . For governments
here and abroad, the Times is
the one indispensable news
paper."
Of David Brinkley: "no one
can match his wry humor . . .
He is intensly proud of the fact
that he writes every word he
says on the air."
Of Time Magazine and Drew
Pearson: "Both are flagrantly
biased aftd avidly read by the
Washington press corps. No one
in Washington can afford to
ignore either . . . despite biases
and distortions, they are the

most affecting reporters of
politics at work today . . . They
art 1 regarded with suspicion and
hypnotized attention."
Professor Rivers paints a
vivid contract between President
Kennedy and President Johnson.
President Kennedy, once
briefly a London correspondent
for Hearst's International News
Service after the war, was a re
sounding success with the press
corps because he had an intense
appreciation of the reporter's
job, understood the power of tlie
mass media, and had "a fine
sense of history."
President Johnson, on the
other hand, "will never achieve
Kennedy's success . . . he is in
capable of personal chargin . . .
(because) he views the press as
a tool.
"If reporters become increas
ingly antagonistic, the day may
come when Mr. Johnson reverts
to an attitude he sometimes ex
pressed when he was majority
leader: Washington correspond
ents are hirelings who twist the
news to suit, the biases of their
employers."
Washington news is "manag
ed" long before it gets to re
porters and correspondents, so
that we live in a "synthetic
world," Associate Prof. William
Rivers of Stanford's Communi
cation Department declares in a
new book.
The need for hard-digging re
porters, experts in special fields
of government who can write an
interpretive story, is greater
than it ever was, Professor
Rivers writes in "The Opinion
makers," published last week by
Beacon Press, Boston (207 pp.,
$4.95).
Some sections of the press
still inject their own bias into
a story although the picture
is far better now than it was 25
years ago, Professor Rivers be
lieves.
Rivers himself was one of the
first Congressional interns sent
to Washington 10 years ago by
the American Political Science
Association. He was later a cor
respondent for The Reporter
Magazine and has contributed
many articles to Harper's, The
Nation, The New York Times

Magazine, and others.
His hook describes the Wash
ington press scene, with specific
attention to Walter Lippman,
James Rest on and the New York
Times, David Brinkley, Time
Magazine and Drew Pearson.
Of Lippman, he says:"The
style is the man; lucid expres
sion is the flesh of complex ideas
that grow from sentence to sen
tence like a coral reef."
Of Rest on and The New York
Times: "Reston's example has
stiffened the backbone of many
a correspondent facing high of
ficialdom . . . For governments
here and abroad, the Times is
the one indispensable news
paper."
Of David Brinkley: "no one
