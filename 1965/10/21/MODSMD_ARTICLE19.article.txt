## 
### 
ST. LOUIS, Mo.â€”The St. Lou
is Cardinals traded veteran Kon
Boyer to the New York Mots
Wednesday for third baseman
Charley Smith and left-handed
pitcher A 1 Jackson. Cardinal
General Manager Bob Howsam
and Met President George Weiss
closed the deal in Chicago. It
was announced here. In Now
York, the Mets said they would
also receive a minor league play
er to be named later.
"We hate to see a player of
Ken's caliber go," Howsam said,
"because he has been great in
his 11 years with the Cardinals.
But wc had a chance to get a
man in Smith who is a power
hitter and a good fielder, and a
fine starting pitcher in Jackson.
The trade may be the first in
a series for the Cardinals, who
finished seventh in the National
League this year after winning
the world championship in 1964.
Boyer had a bad season after
suffering a back injury in an
exhibition game.

1964 and was named the league's
most valuable player. This year,

.260. batted in 75 runs and hit
13 homers.
Smith, 28, hit .244 this past
season for the Mets, had 62 RBI
and 16 home runs.

games for the Mets than any
other pitcher in the team's four
year history -40. Last season he
won eight and lost 20.
The major leagues failed to
pick a new baseball commission
er Wednesday and named an ex
panded screening committee to

"I feel confident a commis
sioner will be elected at the De
cember meetings," said John
Galbreath, owner of the Pitts
burgh Pirates and a member of
the original two-man screening
committee.
Bob Reynolds, president of the
Los Angeles Angels, and Phil
Wrigley, president of the Chi

cago Cubs, were named to join
Galbreath and John Fetzer, De
troit president, on the commit
tee.
Fetzer confirmed that five
men named by The Associated
Press Wednesday as top candi
dates to succeed retiring Ford
Frick as commissioner were in
the hopper. But Fetzer said he
wouldn't venture a guess as to

who was the leading prospect.
The oommittce will have com-'
plete authority to interview can
didates and to report to the j
winter meetings. If the four j
men unanimously agree on a |
name or names to present, the |
owners will take a vote. There !
was no word when the expanded
committee would hold its next
meeting.
The owners did create a new !
front office staff for the admin
istration of the game as an aid
to the new commissioner in a
chain of command similar to the
U.S. Cabinet;.
The proposal was submitted
by owners Walter O'Malley of
the Los Angeles Dodgers and
Bob Reynolds of the California
Angels.
