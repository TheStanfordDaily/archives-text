# Critics of Foreign Policy Organize Forum
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
Tlie Americans for Reappraisal of
Far Eastern Policy (ARFEP), a
nation-wide, university-based a<l hoe
committee, organized in the belief
"that the United States can no longer
afford to pursue its present policy in
the Far East," will sponsor an educa
tional forum in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium Sunday evening.
The program, to feature a telephone
hookup with several nationally prom
inent speakers in the East, is being
held in conjunction with the twentieth
anniversary of the United Nations.
On the telephone hookup will be
Norman Thomas, four-time Socialist
Party candidate for President; Mich
ael Harrington, social critic, author,
and columnist; Harvard sinologist
John K. Fairbank; Congressman Wil
liam Fit/ Rya"n of New York; and

Norman Cousins, editor of Saturday
Review. Former Stanford Dean Allard
Lowenstein will moderate the pro
gram.
In Dinkelspiel, Professor oi History
Otis Pease, ASSU President Sandy
Mackenzie, and others to be selected
later will speak.
Similar programs will be held si
multaneously at more than 30 college
campuses across the country.
Four Proposals
ARFEP has drawn up four propos
als to serve as a focus for the dis
cussions. They are;
• In order to emphasize the sincer
ity of its desire to reach a negotiated
settlement in Vietnam, the United
Stales should call for an immediate
cease-fire by both sides. This cease
fire should preferably be administered
through the United Nations and
should serve as a prelude to uncondi

tional negotiations which should in
clude all parties involved in the
conflict.
• The United States should an
nounce its readiness to negotiate to
wards the recognition of the People's
Republic of China. The withholding
of recognition has outlived its effec
tiveness as a political weapon. Recog
nition is now essentially a matter of
diplomatic convenience, and hence as
much in the interest of the recognizer
as the recognized.
• The United States should negoti
ate towards admission of the People's
Republic of China to the United Na
tions and other international bodies.
There is little hope for an orderly
world with so large a power excluded
from the order.
• The United States should declare
its readiness to join China in projects

of mutual advantage and concern, in
cluding establishment of controls over
the production and testing of nuclear
weapons and the end of special re
strictions on trade, communications,
and exchange of personnel.
"Positive Approach"
"We feel that the method of going
into a discussion with concrete pro
posals is a more positive approach
than merely suggesting the with
drawal of American troops from Viet
nam," explained Michael Collins, co
ordinator of the Stanford end of the
program to The Daily yesterday.
The forum, he said, is intended as
an alternative to civil disobedience for
those who disagree with U.S. policy
in the Far East.
"Hopefully" said Collins, "the fo
rum will serve as a catalyst for dis
cussion on the role of China in the
modern world, which ARFEP believes

to be the key issue in the Far East.
"We feel the situation in Vietnam
is just one manifestation of the much
larger and more critical problem of
China," he added.
Rationale
An ARFEP bulletin explains the
rationale behind the nation-wide fo
rum: "Discussion and debate (on U.S.
policy in the Far East | has been froz
en on lines of now outdated policies.
The time is now for a new beginning.
"The continuing Vietnamese con
flict, the fighting on the subcontinent,
China's vast population and nuclear
bomb all these interrelated develop
ments call for a reappraisal of our
goals and tactics in the Far East."
Richard Rciss, a Yale student, heads
the national organization.
The program in Dinkolspiel will be
gin at 7:30 p.m.
