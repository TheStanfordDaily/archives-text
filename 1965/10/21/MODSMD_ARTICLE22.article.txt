# Stanford Booters Blow Lead; Drop Overtime Tilt To San Jose
## 
### TOM EDISON 
Blowing a 4-1 lead, and, as the
officials phrased it, playing one
of the weirdest games they had
over seen, Stanford's soccer
team lost in conference action
to San Jose State, (5-5.
Overtime action decided the
outcomn of 4 f*ame.
The first half saw very limited
scoring with the game dead
locked at 1-1, but the second half
produced several outstanding
goals, not to mention lino pass
ing by both teams. Each team
scored four t mes in ihe linal
half with the Spartans scoring
all four of their goals in the last
period.
Overtime I'lay
The Indians looked groal
throughout most of the contest

but a series of bad breaks back
ed by brilliant boots by the Spar
tans in the final minutes of the
game sent the game into extra
period play.
Stanford led 41 at the end of
lho tbird quarter.
Altera scoreless first quarter,
Stanford's Dann Boyd got Stan
ford off on the right foot off his
left foot with the first goal of
the game. Boyd also scored the
first goal in the second half,
neatly tucking one into the un
protected goal.
San Jose missed many good
shots in the first half, having to
settle for only one score on a
penalty kick from loss than
fifteen feet out.
Fine lliirlbert Shot
Using his head and subse
quently scoring, Bill Ilurlbort
produced the finest shot of the
day for Stanford's third score
of the game in the second half.
The fourth came only minutes
later off the shoulder of Kamel
Kadi who, with two men cover
ing him throughout the game,
had difficulty in scoring but
nonetheless turned in another
fine performance.
Then came the bloody fourth
period with the Stanford Red
seeing their three-point load van
ish with the combined scoring
of Lois Gonzales and Louis
Fraser. Both Spartans scored
twice in the final quarter.
Spartans Led i>-l
San Jose scored three goals
within thro minutes tying the
score at 1-1 on a loft-shot over
the outstretched arms of Stan
ford's goalie. On the next tally
the Spartans went ahead, 5-1,
with a mere 10 seconds left in
the game.
However, the Indians, on gain
ing possession of the ball, ram
med in the clutch-shot with a
driving boot by Tito Bianehi
with only 20 seconds remaining
running the game into ten min
utes of overtime.
The final and game-winning
score for San Jose was inadvert
antly knocked in by a Stanford
player who was attempting to

block a shot from a Spartan.
The succor team has had its
problems this year, mainly bo
cause many of the mure experi
enced players are no longer
around. Boh Cox, last year's cen
ter halfback who solidified the
defense, is sorely missed. This
year's squad is made up of main
ly sophomores, who have yet to
gain the necessary experience.
The other teams in the North
ern California Soccer League
have been able to take advan
tage of this inexperience. Also
an injury to goalie Jim Gidwitz

has forced the team 1o roalign
the defense once again. Mosi of
the team's problems stem from
a eolJapse of the defense. In the
IJSK game, Ihe Indians were tied
1-1 with the Dons, until FSF got
goal-happy and ran off four
quick goals.
The team plays its next game
this Friday against the Univer
sity of Pacific. The contest will
he held here at Stanford at 3:00
p.m. The next J.V. game with
San Francisco State College will
be October 30 in San Francisco
at 1:4f) p.m.

score for San Jose was inadvert
antly knocked in by a Stanford
player who was attempting to

block a shot from a Spartan.
The succor team has had its
problems this year, mainly bo
cause many of the mure experi

around. Boh Cox, last year's cen

defense, is sorely missed. This
year's squad is made up of main
ly sophomores, who have yet to
gain the necessary experience.
The other teams in the North

have been able to take advan

an injury to goalie Jim Gidwitz

has forced the team 1o roalign
the defense once again. Mosi of
the team's problems stem from
a eolJapse of the defense. In the
IJSK game, Ihe Indians were tied
1-1 with the Dons, until FSF got
