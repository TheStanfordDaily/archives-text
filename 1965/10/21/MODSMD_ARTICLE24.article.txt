a rough Dixie game.
Princeton 21, Pennsylvania 7:
Ron Landeck and kicker Char
ley Gogolak make it No. 14 for

808 HATH, right linebacker on (lie Indians powerful defense,
was awarded Northern California Linenian-of-t he-week honors
lasl week for his efforts in I lie I'KC name. Hath, a senior, played
in per cent of lasl year's games and has become a top-flight
linebacker this season with his good understanding of the game.
With 9 assisted and unassisted tackles in last week's game,
Hath boosted bis year's total to IX to place second to Mike
liibler. An inspiration to the defensive team, Hath helped coil
tain the powerful Trojan offensive plays. I'p to last week the
Stanford defense was first in the AAWU. Only the AAWL's
lending rusher, Alike (Jarrctt and his 77 yard touchdown run
was able to penetrate the Indian line as the Cards held the
Trojans back for more than seven-eighths of last week's thriller.
NEW YORK—Michigan State
