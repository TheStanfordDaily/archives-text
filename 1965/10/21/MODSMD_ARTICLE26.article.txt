### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)
"We made too many mistakes
and didn't deserve to beat USC,"
Stanford coach .John Ralston
said Monday.
The declaration to the North
ern California football writers
and sportsoast.ers made it offi
cial.
Trojan "Luck"
After Southern California
beat Stanford 14-0 last Starydau
in Los Angeles, Stanford quar
terback Dave Lewis was quoted
as saying, "It's obvious we were
tlie better club. There's no doubt
no doubt whatsoever we
were the better club."
This quote didn't sit too well
with lISC coach John McKay,
who said Monday that he's tired
of hearing his teams are lucky
to beat Stanford. Stanford has
not beaten the Trojans since
McKay took over in 1960.
"1 did read 1 hat Dave had said
we were the better team," ad
mitted Ralston. "And if John
construes it that way. that's his
personal privilege.
italston Silent
"When you win, you're en
titled to your comment," con
tinued Ralston. "We're upset
when we lose, but there's always
a reason for it."
Ralston said building the FSC
attack around halfback Mike
Garrett probably was opposed
to the way McKay likes to coach.
"Il's putting all your eggs in
one basket," said Ralston about
Garrett, who broke the game

wide open with a 77-yard touch
down run in the fourth quarter.
"But he's durable and he does
not fumble. How can you knock
success?
"I studied our films of Satur
day. Even though we outplayed
them, in the end we wflre the
first to crack.

"One thing about USC," ob
served Kalston, "they don't give
you the game. To beat them,
you have to earn it."
USC isn't the only undefeated
team in tho Pacific Athletic Con
ference. California has a spot
less record after healing the
Washington Huskies 10-12 last
Saturday in the Bears' only
league game so far. The Bears
meet UCLA Saturday night in
the Los Angeles Coliseum.
"The experts didn't think too
much of UCLA or us. either,"
said Cal Coach Ray Willsey.
California now has won three
straight after losing their first
two games. UCLA opened with
a narrow loss to powerful Mich
igan State, t hen upset Penn

State and Syracuse before being
ticrl 1 1 1 1 last week by Missouri.
"When you can go into Colum
bia and play even with Missouri
at this stage of the season, then
you're playing pretty good foot
ball," said Willsey.
His quarterback Dan Berry
got ihe group's award for Nor
thern California back of the
week. San Jose State defensive
end Martin Baccaglie was ad
judged the week's top lineman
in the area.
