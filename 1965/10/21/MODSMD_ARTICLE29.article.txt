"Discussion iind review by private individ
uals of any aspect of our foreign policy, and
particularly our policy towards the Pciping
regime, is most desircablc.'
McGeorgc Bundy, 19(13
The founders of ARFEP (Americans for He
appraisal of Far Eastern Policy) have decided
that the academic comuuity is the most vital
base from which to launch the type of dis
ci ission McGeorge Bundy welcomes above.
Thus, on Sunday, Stanford will host one of
the thirtv-odd seminars to be held across the
country under ARK FT sponsorship. Featured
speakers will include Professor John K. Fair
bank of Harvard, 'Saturday Review Editor
Norman Cousins, Socialist Norman Thomas
and author Michael Harrington on a national
hook-up, with Professor Otis Pease and ASSU
President Sandy Mackenzie offering the local
presentations.
ARFEP, whose national secretariat is located
at Yale, claims that it is an ad hoc committee
seeking the broadest possible support and that
it "seeks this support not through civil dis
obedience but through education.
We hope this is so, for the questions ARFEP
intends to ask definitely need public exposure
and debate. Primarily, it is their belief that the
U.S. "can no longer afford to pursue its present
policy in the Far East," particularly as it relates
to Communist China, since a "continuation of
the status quo" can only lead to "mounting
tension and increasing danger of war.
As a solution, ARFEP has drafted four pro
posals for debate; these call for a UN-enforced
cease-fire in Vietnam and immediate negotia
tions with "all parties involved," recognition of
Red China both by the U.S. and the U.N., and
an end to trade and personnel restrictions.
Although we do not agree with all of these

proposals, we do think a rational discussion of
each would he of great value. Our elected
leaders have unfortunately tended to regard
all such efforts as terribly misguided or—worse
yet—maliciously inspired. The time has come
to end the monologue; perhaps ARFKP has
some feasible alternatives.
We shall see.
