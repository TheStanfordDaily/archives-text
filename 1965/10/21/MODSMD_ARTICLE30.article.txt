The Executive Committee of the Academic
Council is to be commended highly for its
recommendation Tuesday that each ol the eight
committees of the Academic Council "invite the
nomination by the ASSU President of students
who may be called to serve as consultants to
the committees.
The committees in question consider issues
of fundamental importance to the community,
ranging from admissions policy to undergradu
ate housing. Participation at this level — where
the real power to effect change in University
policies often resides — will allow students to
take part in the creative processes of decision
making instead of being forced to use protest
as the sole means of communication with the
Administration.
The Executive Committee also advised the
various committees that it and when they re
quest student consultants, they are then "ex
pected to make use of their services." This
crucial addition should insure that student par
ticipation is real as well as apparent.
Again, we wish to commend the nine mem
bers of the Executive Committee and urge the
respective Academic Council committees to
consider this directive as soon as is possible.
