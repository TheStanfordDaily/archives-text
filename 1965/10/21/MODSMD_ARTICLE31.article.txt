## Profs Protest Closing Of Union 
### 
Editor, Tile Daily:
Can the Union be preserved?
The Administration is about
to break up an important Stan
ford institution. At the start of
Winter Quarter the Union Hall
of Residence will bo remodeled
and turned into administrative
offices, its present residents
scattered to Florence Moore,
Lagunita, and the high-rise
apartments.
We who know Union as fac
ulty associates and guests are
convinced that it represents a
university residence at its best.
For years the women of Union
have been a source of intellec
tual vitality on this campus.
They are intelligent and inde
pendent people, committed to a
wide range of important inter
ests, and they are articulate
about these interests among
themselves and with the faculty
members they invite for meals
and teas. At Union, committed
individuals have merged in a
residential community which
has intellectual value for the
rest of the university. That, we
think, is the character of an

ideal university residence, a
character achieved at Union by
a long tradition and the efforts
of its residents.
At this moment in the univer
sity's history many administra
tors and faculty members are
particularly concerned about im
proving the residence system. It
seems an odd time, then, for the
administration to destroy one of
Stanford's best residences. The
faculty must bear some of the
blame, because it is they who
are pressing for the inner quad
offices now occupied by the
Deans, who In turn are moving
to Union. But it does not follow
that, because the Deans are being
pushed out of inner quad, they
must come to rest in Union. Nor
is it clear that the Deans must
vacate their present offices be
fore the Moore-Jacks Houses
make available a single resi
dence for the women of Union.
With some inventiveness in
the Planning Office or restraint
on the part of the faculty, the
move and its timing might lack
the inevitability with which of
ficial opinion presently endows

them. We hope that the friends
of Union will make their dis
tress known now, while, hope
fully, there is still time.

â€¢ Intellectual Oasis?
Editor, The Daily:
As a graduate student new to
Stanford, I have been disturbed
by the lack of atmosphere of
intellectual curiosity on this
campus. I had always believed
that in a university termed "the
Harvard of the West." more than
just the "protesting" minority of
the students would be in active
search for knowledge beyond
the classroom, both of the world
outside Stanford and of them
selves.
It is the latter category which ,

lias puzzled mo in particular;
surely the quest for self-knowl
edge on the part of the Stanford
undergraduate woman should
go beyond the problem of which
color eye shadow best defines
the Real Me. In a word, 112 was
disillusioned.
Then I attended Ihe AWS
Faculty-Wives Symposium on
Sunday. Shocked I was, but with
the happy discovery that Stan
ford women were indeed engag
ing in tho kind of meaningful,
penetrating self-analysis that
characterizes a thinking person.
This was proven both in the
speeches at Dinkelspiel and in
subsequent discussion groups at
the home of faculty members.
Clearly this event was one of
the most important forms of in
tellectual break-through to oc
cur on campus this quarter.
Why then has not the Sym
posium received more atten
tion? Surely the Stanford Daily
can afford more space to publi
cize this unique demonstration
that student government in gen
eral and AWS in particular can
play a significant role in the
development of an intellectual
atmosphere at Stanford.
