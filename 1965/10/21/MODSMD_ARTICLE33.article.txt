## 'Ivory Tower' University Is Activism's Birthplace

That students of popularly
called "ivory tower" universities
are becoming more and more
active can no longer be disputed.
Events at Berkeley formalized
the trend and notified the nation.
The second stage of activism
rests with the answer to this
question: will involvement,
which is just as much protected
by the "ivory tower" as it is
impeded by it, cease with grad
uation?
Stimulating Environment
The stimulating environment
of a university hopefully invites
an expansion of interests; lack
of major economic responsibil
ity, mobility, expendable time,
and intellectual curiosity maxi
mize the opportunity for social
involvement. Yet a career and
family bring responsibilities
which usually suffocate the will
to activism.
And the issues may change, at
least on the surface: civil rights

may bo a demand solved at the !
conference table rather than on!
the streets; the ranch owner
cannot long hold out against the j
farm worker. Other specific (-ri
ses will undoubtedly replace con
temporary issues.
War
War, however, which has al- j
ways been a form of expression j
for otherwise civilized man. is l
almost never avoided at the con
ference table or through demon
strations. Some say this is be
cause war is international, and
not a phenomenon common to a
conflict of interests within the
state, as arc minority rights.
Psychologists, sociologists, pol-!
iticians and economists can pre
sent a coherent and academical- j
ly acceptable explanation of!
man's motives for war. The t
clergy can justify the instance
in which national authority,
which allows man to kill, pre
empts God's authority, which
teaches the opposite. To some,
as Abraham Maslow states,
". . . it seems more and more
clear that what we call 'normal'
... is really a psycho-pathology
of the average, so undramatic
and so widely spread that we
don't even noticc it ordinarily."
Rejection of Yalules
Activism is largely a product!
of a rejection of existing values, j
Involvement is directed toward
a change in a status quo which j
is accepted with (heretofore) ;
little or no question. Contempo
rary activism is dedicated:
against "man's inhumanity to j
man." With this in mind the
very fundamental link between
specific acts of involvement
such as supporting the striking
farm workers in Delano (or tu
toring in East Palo Alto) and a
similar committment against
war and killing is obvious.
For most of us the university j
is the focus of our first exami-!
nation of existing values; the
process of evaluation can per
haps be best performed at the
university. But the end of our
affair with the university can
not mean the atrophy of this
process. Life's responsibilities
demand, rather than a shelving
of commitment, a nurturing and
a maturing of examination.
