# NEGRO COLLEGE:
## Teaching Down South 
### BARBARA MOORE 
"Immediate disillusionment will re
sult if you go there to be charitable
or a missionary," say Christe McCoy
in her soft South Carolinian voice.
"But for me it seemed a more prof
itable approach to the racial problem
than picketing."
Christe is speaking of her year
spent as an English teacher in the
Negro North Carolina College in Dur
ham. North Carolina. The Wood row
Wilson Internship Program gave her
the opportunity to teach at the 3,000-
student liberal arts college.
The "psychological factors involved
in teaching English" presented a chal
lenge for Christe. "For one thing, we
are imposing on Negro students a
'standard' English which does not be
long to them or their homes, an
English which belongs to the white
middle class toward which they have
every right to feel resentment. Stu
dents who are extremely sensitive to
feelings of inferiority," she explains,
"are told that their words, their very
ways of communicating with each
other are bad, inferior, uneducated."
Language Barriers
Although Christe feels that being
white didn't handicap her as much as
the inevitable barriers between stu
dents and teachers, she did feel handi
capped by unfamiliarily with the local
speech patterns. Encountering a sen

tence such as "The room was so
messy until I couldn't find what I
wanted." she knew the fault must lie
in a local colloquialism, not in a per
sonal error.
Racial considerations also arose in
discussions of literature. "Dickens is
noted for portraying characters who
are all black or white." is a comment
Christe purposefully avoided.
In addition to the teaching experi
ence, the Wood row Wilson Founda
tion pays for one-fourth of the Teach
ing Fellow's time to promote work
with promising students.
Intellectual Lethargy
As a free-time project, Christe led
a voluntary and enthusiastic book dis
cussion group through Lord of the
Flies and Brave New World. On the
whole, however, she was disillusioned
in trying to arouse intellectual en
thusiasm.
"I went to NCC with the illusion
that for the Southern Negro student,
college is a special experience and
that those who go really want their
education," she muses. "Unfortunate
ly the college degree is primarily a
status symbol just as for many middle
class white students."
In fact. Christe repeatedly discov
ered similarities between NCC stu
dent aspirations and those of analo
gous white students.
Dancing the Frug
"The parents have strained and
labored to send their children to col
lege," Christe observes, "but most of
the students themselves have come to
college because 'their friends did,' or
because 'it seemed the thing to do.'"
Christe continues, "Like typical
American teenagers, most are con
cerned with dancing the frug, playing
bridge, wearing the latest fashions,
and getting into the right sorority."
Yet, in the midst of diamond hose
and leather Beatle boots, Christe
found themes dealing with the civil
rights movement. "During my junior
year in high school. I took a special
interest in many of the picket lines
whi< h almost caused me to depart for
jail," wrote a "saucy and sometimes
sassy little girl with a beehive hair
do."
Fxceptions Arouse Hopes
Although most of her students re
mained so absorbed in the nonaca
domic world that they applied them
selves sparingly to their studies, there
were exceptions that gave Christe
mingled feelings of hope and frustra
t ion.
"There's not enough time," she
fears. "When they're lis, it's too late
to overcome the English of the home."
Yet, one of her longest memories
will be of ihe farm boy who wrote,
"I know that I cannot learn to use
correct grammar over night or one
whole year, but it is something that
I'm going to practice on and concen
trate on until I get it drilled in my
mind so deeply to the point that I will
know how a word or phrase should
be used and when 1 hear someone else
u c a wrong word if will hurt inc."
