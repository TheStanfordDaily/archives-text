# IFC Clears Path For Unified Rush
## 
### 
The Interfraternity Council (IFCi
last night gave an almost immediate
stamp of approval to a proposed uni
fied rush policy.
The Council's acceptance of the pol
icy, first suggested last spring by an
ad hoc student-faculty committee,
clears the way for compromise on
areas of dispute. Living group presi
dents have scheduled a meeting to
morrow with Associate Dean of Stu
dents Robert Gordon.
Earlier this week the Interelub
Council (ICCi and Stern Interhouse
Council (IHC) ratified the proposed
rush policy. However, the eating clubs
questioned how party schedules would
be set, and IHC representatives ex
pressed special concern that an ap
peals board for cases of "dirty rush"
be established.
Separate Appeals Hoard
Ray Colby. IHC President, said the
Stern council disapproved using the
men's council for such an appeals
board because it sometimes favored
specific living groups in representa
tion. The ad hoc. committee originally
proposed setting up an appeals board
separate from the existing student
judicial system.
Last week the IFC voted on the
rush proposals but turned down the
establishment of a separate appeals
board and sent to committee sections
dealing with a proposed written bid
system.
The IFC committee recommended
that bid cards not be mailed but that
freshmen receive the cards personally
at a bid session. The freshmen may
not officially pledge, until he signs

the card at the Wilbur office of the
Dean of Students' office.
Kidding Revisions
Rob Freeman, IFC President, said
the bidding revisions "will allow the
freshmen to know that they definitely
have bids from specific houses." Free
man said the revision also would per
mit freshmen "to participate in the
choice of their fellow pledges."
Sections regarding enforcement of
the rush rules were revised by em
ploying the men's council as an ap
peals board "after the regular IFC
appeal procedure has been exhausted."
Freeman said it would now be nec
essary for the living group leaders to
meet and work out a final policy that
would satisfy each of their councils.
First Unified System
Dean Gordon said if a final policy
were devised it would mark the first
time the living groups developed a
unified rush system satisfactory to
all.
The ad hoc committee that origi
nated the rush proposals was chaired
by Prof. John Steward. Students serv
ing on the committee were approved
by living group presidents but did not
represent specific sides.
Most students on the committee
were seniors last year, and Prof.
Steward said new members would be
appointed to continue to review rush.
"It. has become apparent, that tin
concept of a 'final' rushing policy is
unrealistic," Prof. Steward said, lie
indicated that this year's changes
were minor in nature, and the com
mittee would evaluate more extensive
changes in the future.
