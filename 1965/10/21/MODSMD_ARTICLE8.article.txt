## 
### 
SACRAMENTO <AP) The two lop
leaders of the legislature today threat
ened a legislative crackdown on the
University of California if the Berke
ley campus continues to he what
Assembly Speaker Jesse M. Unruh
termed "a staging area, a fountain
head" for anti-Vietnam demonstra
tions.
Unruh and Senate President Pro
tem Hugh M. Burns, D-Fresno, said
one legislative committee already is
probing the campus anti-Vietnam
movement and another may take on
the job.
Use of the campus for civil dis
obedience activities "is at best a dis
tortion, and at worst a subversion" of
the university's function, he said.
Communist Control
Burns said his Senate Un-American
Activities Committee already is in
vestigating the possibility Commu
nists have gained control of the anti-
Vietnam movement.
"We have people there to report to
us." said Burns, "and we are continu
ing our study on all activities in con
nection with the university."
Unruh said most lawmakers pre
ferred to keep politics out of the uni
versity. Bul he warned:
Staging Area
"Main legisltors are calling for ac
tion because they fool it's what the
people want. What the public wants
isn't always right . . . but the pressure
bccomcs difficult to resist when peo
ple ran see the university being used
as a staging area."
Unruh, a UC Regent, said he hoped
iho Regents would take action to pre
vent further campus involvement in
off-campus political activities.
If the Board fails, however, Unruh
said lie would "resort to my role as
legislator" to seek action.
University Defended
Meanwhile, in another development
yesterday, Govei'nor Brown told Oak
land Mayor John C. Houlihan that he
will not "usurp the powers" of the
University of California Board of Re
gents by intervening in a planned pro
test against United States involve
niunt in Vietnam.

In a special delivery letter to Brown
Tuesday, Houlihan had called upon
the governor for "positive interven
tion" to see that UC officials do not
allow a proopsed Nov. 13 march to
he organized on the Berkeley campus.
In his reply Brown said that the
Oakland mayor's concern should be
expressed directly to UC officials.
Agreement Reached
"Chancellor Roger Heyns and May
or Wallace Johnson of Berkeley ap
pear to have reached a workable
agreement for preventing future dis
turbances such as those of the last
weekend," Brown said.
Houlihan accused Heyns of allow
ing the Berkeley campus to lx> used
to organize the march "011 the grounds
that this constituted an expression of
public opinion, not to be denied oil the.
