Heart Trouble?
With fatherly wisdom King Solomon advises a son, "Keep your heart with all diligence,
for out of the heart are the issues of life" (Proverbs 4:23). The heart," as the Bible uses
the term, makes reference to the inner mcin, to the deepest center of being and personal
identity within us. It is from the heart, the Bible says, that all the issues of life pour
forth, like water from a spring.
A look at human society and the people around us forces the rational individuals among
us to agree with the Prophet Jeremiah: "The heart is deceitful; above all things and
desperately corrupt; who ran understand if (Jeremiah 17i9(. Jesus Christ said, "Hear
and understand: not what goes into the mouth defiles ct man, but what comes out, this
defiles a man ... Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the
stomach, and so passes on? But what romes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart,
and this defiles a man. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornica
tion, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a man" (Matthew 15: 10-20).
Does this diagnosis reveal that you have a case of heart trouble? Jesus Christ, the great
Physician, specializes in heart surgery and rebuilding of the inner man. It is He who says,
"I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleonnesses,
and from all your idols I will cleanse you. A new heart I will give you and a new spirit
I will put within you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you
a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes
and be careful to observe my ordinances ..." (Ezekiel 18:25-27).
God charges no fees for His self-giving love; rather He has paid the full price Himself
that you might be healed: "It any one is in Christ he is a new creation, old things have
passed away behold all things are become new ... for our sake God has made Jesus
Christ to be sin for us, He who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righ
teousness of God" (2 Corinthians 5:17, 21).

desperately corrupt; who ran understand if (Jeremiah 17i9(. Jesus Christ said, "Hear
and understand: not what goes into the mouth defiles ct man, but what comes out, this
defiles a man ... Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the
stomach, and so passes on? But what romes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart,
and this defiles a man. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, fornica
tion, theft, false witness, slander. These are what defile a man" (Matthew 15: 10-20).
Does this diagnosis reveal that you have a case of heart trouble? Jesus Christ, the great
Physician, specializes in heart surgery and rebuilding of the inner man. It is He who says,
"I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleonnesses,
and from all your idols I will cleanse you. A new heart I will give you and a new spirit
I will put within you; and I will take out of your flesh the heart of stone and give you
a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes
and be careful to observe my ordinances ..." (Ezekiel 18:25-27).
God charges no fees for His self-giving love; rather He has paid the full price Himself
that you might be healed: "It any one is in Christ he is a new creation, old things have
passed away behold all things are become new ... for our sake God has made Jesus
Christ to be sin for us, He who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righ
teousness of God" (2 Corinthians 5:17, 21).
