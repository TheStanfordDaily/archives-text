* a liberal translation for those who have cut french class
all semester: for a short time only, a one-ounce flacon of
CHRISTIAN DIOR's 'diorling toilet water will be given com
plimentary (FREE!) with the purchase of luminous christian
dior lipstick, 2.00, or christian dior nail enamel, 2.00 and 2.25,
in'any one of a whole french palette of frosted shades and
couture-inspired true tones, so even if it means cutting one
more french class, rush to the jm-stanford cosmetic collec
tions, where there's a lot more to be said for the french.
