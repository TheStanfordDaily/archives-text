lence. in a probe that has focused
mainly on finances of the hooded

Reapportionment Posses
SACRAMENTO Control of the leg
islature swung Thursday to Southern
California's swelling cities and suiv
urhs as politicians yielded to courts
and adopted a landmark reapportion
ment of the Senate and Assembly.
For the first lime in 40 years, rural
Californians found themselves headed
for a minority role in both houses
following one of the most far-reaching
political shakeups in 115 years of
statehood.
The climax to a long delaying ac
tion on the part of legislators arrived
a couple of minutes past noon when
a 28-9 vote in an unhappy and un
reconciled Senate moved the redis
trieting measure to the Assembly.
Less than five minutes later, the
lower house took up the bill, which
alters boundaries of all 40 upper
house districts and 38 of the 80 lower
house districts.
After just more than half an hour
of debate, a 52-8 vote was recorded
in favor of the bill.

lence. in a probe that has focused
mainly on finances of the hooded

STATE AND LOCAL
Reapportionment Posses
SACRAMENTO Control of the leg
islature swung Thursday to Southern
California's swelling cities and suiv
urhs as politicians yielded to courts
and adopted a landmark reapportion
ment of the Senate and Assembly.
For the first lime in 40 years, rural
Californians found themselves headed
for a minority role in both houses
following one of the most far-reaching
political shakeups in 115 years of
statehood.
The climax to a long delaying ac
tion on the part of legislators arrived
a couple of minutes past noon when
a 28-9 vote in an unhappy and un
reconciled Senate moved the redis
trieting measure to the Assembly.
Less than five minutes later, the
lower house took up the bill, which
alters boundaries of all 40 upper
house districts and 38 of the 80 lower
house districts.
After just more than half an hour
of debate, a 52-8 vote was recorded
in favor of the bill.
