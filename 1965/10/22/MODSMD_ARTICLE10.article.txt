# Theater Group Needs Ushers
## 
### 
The Stanford Repertory Thea
ter is urging house presidents,
social chairmen and cultural
chairmen to sign up their living
units for ushering for this year's
productions.
Twenty five ushers are used
each night. Each house unit may
volunteer to provide five or
more ushers on any evening of
its choice.
Ushers are also being taken
on an individual basis.
Ushers serve without pay, but
they and their dates are invited
to a special preview perform
ance before opening night of
each production.
A meeting for social chair
men and students interested in
ushering will be held today at
5 p.m. in the balcony of the
Memorial Auditorium.
