### 
The strike of the grape work
ers against the growers of Kern
and Tulare counties, now in its
seventh week, has the full sup
port of the Migrant Ministry, ac
cording to the Rev. James Drake,
associated with the group.
"The grovVers are still unwill
ing to negotiate," says Rev.
Drake, "This is not in the best
tradition of collective bargain
ing, nor is it within the Chris
tian tradition of the recognition
of human dignity and reconcili
ation."
The Migrant Ministry is ask
ing the churches' support for
the people "in prayer, in money
and food and clothing."
