# JAZZ YEAR
## Duke And Ella Are Coming! The 						Group 
### AL HEINEMAN 
The Stanford community will
have an opportunity to hear two
of America's most popular and
durable musical personalities on
Sunday, Oct. 31, when Ella Fitz
gerald and Duke Ellington will
appear together at Frost Amphi
theater.
Ella Fitzgerald has been at
the top of fans' and critics' jazz
polls for 20 years; among those
she has consistently won are the
"Down Beat" and "Playboy"
magazine surveys.
Her career began when she
was discovered at a Harlem ama
teur- show when she was 16, and
was asked to join the popular
Chick Webb orchestra. She was
Webb's vocalist for five years,
then led his band for a year aft
er his death. It was with Webb
that she made her first best
selling record, "A-Tisket, A-
Tasket," in 1938.
Concerts and Tours
After she left the Webb unit,
she apeared in many of Norman
Granz' concerts and tours, nota
bly in the Jazz at the Philhar
monic series. During this period,
she also toured Europe and the
Far East.
Until 1955, Miss Fitzgerald
had been tremendously popular
and influential among the jazz
performers, but except for a few
hit records, was little known to
the public. In 1955, Granz began
to manage her career, and
through his skillful publicity
work, she gained the exposure
necessary for the wide recogni
tion she now enjoys. She made
an appearance in the film "Pete
Kelly's Blues" in 1955 and made
a favorable impression in spite
of the mediocre quality of the
movie.

She gave her own concert at
the Hollywood Bowl in 1957, and
in 1958 appeared with Duke El
lington at Carnegie Hall. Her
most popular single records in
recent years have been "Mack
the Knife" and "How High the
Moon," and her albums, especi
ally her treatments of Rodgers
and Hart, Cole Porter, George
Gershwin, and the "Porgy and
Bess" score with Louis Arm
strong, have been unusually
successful.
Tile Duke
Duke Ellington has been called
the greatest figure in American
music of the 20th century. His
contributions to the popular
song field have been profuse, of
course: "Mood Indigo," "Sophis
ticated Lady," "I Let a Song Go
Out of My Heart," "Don't Get
Around Much Anymore," "I Got
It Bad," "I'm Beginning to See
the Light," and "Satin Doll" are
some of the best known.
But as a serious composer and
arranger, Ellington, now an
alert and elegant 67, has re
ceived world-wide attention
through his suites and extended
works, among them "Black,
Brown and Beige," "The Liberi
an Suite" (commissioned by the
Liberian government), "New
World a-Comin', " "Harlem" com
missioned by Toscanini, "Suite
Thursday," "Such Sweet Thun
der," and the recently unveiled
"My People."
Born Edward Kennedy Elling
ton in Washington, D.C., he
studied music and art at school,
and turned down an art scholar
ship to concentrate on music.
He led dance bands for parties
for a while, then opened at the
Kentucky Club in Manhattan in
1923. One of the featured solo
ists at the Kentucky Club was

baritone saxophonist Harry Car
ney, who is still with the band,
and still winning polls.
From 1927 to 1932, the Elling
ton band played their famous
long-term engagement at the
Cotton Club in N.Y., and,
through radio, records, and
movies, became internationally
known. Altoist Johnny Hodges
and trumpeter Cootie Williams,
both still with Duke, joined the
band during that period.
Successes
The group went to Europe in
1933, then returned and, until
the recording ban in 1942, turned
out successes like "Stompy
Jones," "Rockin' in Rhythm," "I
Got It Bad," and especially
"Take the 'A' Train," which re
mains the band's theme song.
The orchestra appeared annual
ly at Carnegie Hall from 1943 to
1950, during which period many
of Ellington's longer works
made their debuts.
Some of the high points in his
career since then have been a
triumphant appearance at the
Newport Jazz Festival in 1956,
and similar successes at all the
major U.S. festivals, European
tours, the composing of the
scores for "Anatomy of a Mur
der" and "Paris Blues," and the
hour-long TV special, "A Drum
Is a Woman."
In addition to the aforemen
tioned personalities, the band
spotlights trumpeter Cat An
derson, trombonist Lawrence
Brown, tenor saxist Paul Gonal
ves, drummer Louis Bellson and
Ellington's son, Mercer Elling
ton, on trumpet. It is a group
which, through its long associa
tion and because of the bril
liance of its personnel and lead
er, has consistently been voted
the most exciting and entertain
ing orchestra in jazz.

inimitable Ella, Duke Kllington

Newport Jazz Festival in 1956,
and similar successes at all the
major U.S. festivals, European
tours, the composing of the
scores for "Anatomy of a Mur
der" and "Paris Blues," and the
hour-long TV special, "A Drum
Is a Woman."
In addition to the aforemen
tioned personalities, the band
spotlights trumpeter Cat An
derson, trombonist Lawrence
Brown, tenor saxist Paul Gonal
ves, drummer Louis Bellson and
Ellington's son, Mercer Elling
ton, on trumpet. It is a group
which, through its long associa
tion and because of the bril
liance of its personnel and lead
er, has consistently been voted
the most exciting and entertain
ing orchestra in jazz.



The incomparable Duke and the
inimitable Ella, Duke Kllington
and Ella Fitzgerald, that is, will
get together in Frost Amphithe
ater next Sunday.
The Stanford community will
have an opportunity to hear two
of America's most popular and
durable musical personalities on
Sunday, Oct. 31, when Ella Fitz
gerald and Duke Ellington will
appear together at Frost Amphi
theater.
Ella Fitzgerald has been at
the top of fans' and critics' jazz
polls for 20 years; among those
she has consistently won are the
"Down Beat" and "Playboy"
magazine surveys.
Her career began when she
was discovered at a Harlem ama
teur- show when she was 16, and
was asked to join the popular
Chick Webb orchestra. She was
Webb's vocalist for five years,
then led his band for a year aft
er his death. It was with Webb
that she made her first best
selling record, "A-Tisket, A-
Tasket," in 1938.
Concerts and Tours
After she left the Webb unit,
she apeared in many of Norman
Granz' concerts and tours, nota
bly in the Jazz at the Philhar
monic series. During this period,
she also toured Europe and the
Far East.
Until 1955, Miss Fitzgerald
had been tremendously popular
and influential among the jazz
performers, but except for a few
hit records, was little known to
the public. In 1955, Granz began
to manage her career, and
through his skillful publicity
work, she gained the exposure
necessary for the wide recogni
tion she now enjoys. She made
an appearance in the film "Pete
Kelly's Blues" in 1955 and made
a favorable impression in spite
of the mediocre quality of the
movie.

She gave her own concert at
the Hollywood Bowl in 1957, and
in 1958 appeared with Duke El
lington at Carnegie Hall. Her
most popular single records in
recent years have been "Mack
the Knife" and "How High the
Moon," and her albums, especi
ally her treatments of Rodgers
and Hart, Cole Porter, George
Gershwin, and the "Porgy and
Bess" score with Louis Arm
strong, have been unusually
successful.
Tile Duke
Duke Ellington has been called
the greatest figure in American
music of the 20th century. His
contributions to the popular
song field have been profuse, of
course: "Mood Indigo," "Sophis
ticated Lady," "I Let a Song Go
Out of My Heart," "Don't Get
Around Much Anymore," "I Got
It Bad," "I'm Beginning to See
the Light," and "Satin Doll" are
some of the best known.
But as a serious composer and
arranger, Ellington, now an
alert and elegant 67, has re
ceived world-wide attention
through his suites and extended
works, among them "Black,
Brown and Beige," "The Liberi
an Suite" (commissioned by the
Liberian government), "New
World a-Comin', " "Harlem" com
missioned by Toscanini, "Suite
Thursday," "Such Sweet Thun
der," and the recently unveiled
"My People."
Born Edward Kennedy Elling
ton in Washington, D.C., he
studied music and art at school,
and turned down an art scholar
ship to concentrate on music.
He led dance bands for parties
for a while, then opened at the
Kentucky Club in Manhattan in
1923. One of the featured solo
ists at the Kentucky Club was

baritone saxophonist Harry Car
ney, who is still with the band,
and still winning polls.
From 1927 to 1932, the Elling
ton band played their famous
long-term engagement at the
Cotton Club in N.Y., and,
through radio, records, and
movies, became internationally
known. Altoist Johnny Hodges
and trumpeter Cootie Williams,
both still with Duke, joined the
band during that period.
Successes
The group went to Europe in
1933, then returned and, until
the recording ban in 1942, turned
out successes like "Stompy
Jones," "Rockin' in Rhythm," "I
Got It Bad," and especially
"Take the 'A' Train," which re
mains the band's theme song.
The orchestra appeared annual
ly at Carnegie Hall from 1943 to
1950, during which period many
of Ellington's longer works
made their debuts.
Some of the high points in his
career since then have been a
triumphant appearance at the
Newport Jazz Festival in 1956,
and similar successes at all the
major U.S. festivals, European

Cotton Club in N.Y., and,
through radio, records, and
movies, became internationally
known. Altoist Johnny Hodges
and trumpeter Cootie Williams,
both still with Duke, joined the
band during that period.
Successes
The group went to Europe in
1933, then returned and, until
the recording ban in 1942, turned
out successes like "Stompy
Jones," "Rockin' in Rhythm," "I
Got It Bad," and especially
"Take the 'A' Train," which re
mains the band's theme song.
The orchestra appeared annual
ly at Carnegie Hall from 1943 to
1950, during which period many
of Ellington's longer works
made their debuts.
Some of the high points in his
career since then have been a
triumphant appearance at the
Newport Jazz Festival in 1956,
and similar successes at all the
major U.S. festivals, European
tours, the composing of the
scores for "Anatomy of a Mur
der" and "Paris Blues," and the
hour-long TV special, "A Drum
Is a Woman."
In addition to the aforemen
tioned personalities, the band
spotlights trumpeter Cat An
derson, trombonist Lawrence
Brown, tenor saxist Paul Gonal
ves, drummer Louis Bellson and
Ellington's son, Mercer Elling
ton, on trumpet. It is a group
which, through its long associa
tion and because of the bril
liance of its personnel and lead
er, has consistently been voted
the most exciting and entertain
ing orchestra in jazz.



The incomparable Duke and the
inimitable Ella, Duke Kllington
and Ella Fitzgerald, that is, will
get together in Frost Amphithe
ater next Sunday.
The Stanford community will
have an opportunity to hear two
of America's most popular and
durable musical personalities on
Sunday, Oct. 31, when Ella Fitz
gerald and Duke Ellington will
appear together at Frost Amphi
theater.
Ella Fitzgerald has been at
the top of fans' and critics' jazz
polls for 20 years; among those
she has consistently won are the
"Down Beat" and "Playboy"
magazine surveys.
Her career began when she
was discovered at a Harlem ama
teur- show when she was 16, and
was asked to join the popular
Chick Webb orchestra. She was
Webb's vocalist for five years,
then led his band for a year aft
er his death. It was with Webb
that she made her first best
selling record, "A-Tisket, A-
Tasket," in 1938.
Concerts and Tours
After she left the Webb unit,
she apeared in many of Norman
Granz' concerts and tours, nota
bly in the Jazz at the Philhar
monic series. During this period,
she also toured Europe and the
Far East.
Until 1955, Miss Fitzgerald
had been tremendously popular
and influential among the jazz
performers, but except for a few
hit records, was little known to
the public. In 1955, Granz began
to manage her career, and
through his skillful publicity
work, she gained the exposure
necessary for the wide recogni
tion she now enjoys. She made
an appearance in the film "Pete
Kelly's Blues" in 1955 and made
a favorable impression in spite
of the mediocre quality of the
movie.

She gave her own concert at
the Hollywood Bowl in 1957, and
in 1958 appeared with Duke El
lington at Carnegie Hall. Her
most popular single records in
recent years have been "Mack
the Knife" and "How High the
Moon," and her albums, especi
ally her treatments of Rodgers
and Hart, Cole Porter, George
Gershwin, and the "Porgy and
Bess" score with Louis Arm
strong, have been unusually
successful.
Tile Duke
Duke Ellington has been called
the greatest figure in American
music of the 20th century. His
contributions to the popular
song field have been profuse, of
course: "Mood Indigo," "Sophis
ticated Lady," "I Let a Song Go
Out of My Heart," "Don't Get
Around Much Anymore," "I Got
It Bad," "I'm Beginning to See
the Light," and "Satin Doll" are
some of the best known.
But as a serious composer and
arranger, Ellington, now an
alert and elegant 67, has re
ceived world-wide attention
through his suites and extended
works, among them "Black,
Brown and Beige," "The Liberi
an Suite" (commissioned by the
Liberian government), "New
World a-Comin', " "Harlem" com
missioned by Toscanini, "Suite
Thursday," "Such Sweet Thun
der," and the recently unveiled
"My People."
Born Edward Kennedy Elling
ton in Washington, D.C., he
studied music and art at school,
and turned down an art scholar
ship to concentrate on music.
He led dance bands for parties
for a while, then opened at the
Kentucky Club in Manhattan in
1923. One of the featured solo
ists at the Kentucky Club was

baritone saxophonist Harry Car
ney, who is still with the band,
and still winning polls.
From 1927 to 1932, the Elling
ton band played their famous
long-term engagement at the
Cotton Club in N.Y., and,
through radio, records, and
movies, became internationally
known. Altoist Johnny Hodges
and trumpeter Cootie Williams,
both still with Duke, joined the
