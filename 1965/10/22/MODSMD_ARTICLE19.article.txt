Darrin McGavin and Celeste Holm will play THE KING ANI) 112,
respectively, when the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical opens at
the Circle Star on October 26.
WAITING FOR GODOT is at the Hamilton Avenue Playhouse
in Palo Alto on weekends through November 13 (see review on
page 5).

Films
JAZZ FILMS will be this evening's Tresidder offering.
The incomparable Margaret Rutherford stars in another Agatha
Christie killer-thriller, MURDER AT THE GALLOP, tomorrow's
Tresidder film. As usual, Miss Rutherford plays Jane Marple,
spritely octogenarian sleuth.
If all goes well, NIGHT OF THE IGUANA will get raked over
the coals at the Flicks on Sunday. All this was supposed to happen
last week, but nobody could find the charcoal briquets and lighter
fluid. Anyway, this picture's only claim to fame is that it typecast
Richard Burton as a wayward Episcopal minister.
Monday's "Films in the Tank" are three short ones, the most
provocative sounding being THE ITCH YOU CAN'T SCRATCH.
They will bo shown at 4:30 and 8:00 in the Physics Tank.
The I-Center International Film Discussion Series this Wednes
day will feature WE ARE ALL MURDERERS, a gruesomely can
did French movie about capital punishment. Needless to say, there
is a certain bias in the presentation.
THE HUMAN CONDITION is this Thursday's University Film
Series offering. It deals with the Japanese army during World
War 11.
The Fine Arts is currently showing UMBRELLAS OF CHER
BOURG and BLACK ORPHEUS.
THE PAWNBROKER has settled down for a long stay at the
Guild. This powerful drama about a Jew's double failure stars
Rod Steiger in the title role.
Two of Molina Mercouri's many faces are on display at the Park
this weekend. In TOPKAPI she and Maximilian Schell try to steal
a fabulous jeweled dagger from the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul,
assisted by Peter Ustinov. In NEVER ON SUNDAY she is more or
less for sale in Greece. She is at her inimitable best in both.
THE REWARD is at the Stanford. And not even it deserves to be
co-billed with BEHOLD A PALE HORSE, starring Gregory Peck
and Anthony Quinn. In spite of its impressively Biblical title (in
tended, no doubt to give it stature or something), it is a complete
wipeout and should be avoided at all costs.
Michael Caine is still wrestling with THE IPCRESS FILE at the
Varsity. He is a real spy involved with real enemy-types, as opposed
to the glittering and flambuoyant, but hopelessly unreal, James
Bond variety.
Both the Bijou and the Paris are currently closed.
Other
Arthur Tollefson, piano, and Alexandra Hawley, flute, will give
a STUDENT RECITAL this evening in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
On Sunday, Nathan Rubin, violin, and Leland Smith, piano and
harpsichord, will give a concert of CHAMBER MUSIC in Dinkel
spiel. This is one of a series of concerts devoted to music for
smaller vocal and instrumental groups.
THE TANGENT is featuring Elmerlee Thomas and Jim Wood,
formerly with Gateway Singers, tonight only. Tonight and tomor
row the Illegitimate Theater will do its stuff; and on Sunday "A
Slight Ache," by Harold Pinter, will have its West Coast premiere.
And, obviously, Duke and Ella are coming. Next Sunday. To
Frost Amphitheater. Everybody go.

a fabulous jeweled dagger from the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul,
assisted by Peter Ustinov. In NEVER ON SUNDAY she is more or
less for sale in Greece. She is at her inimitable best in both.
THE REWARD is at the Stanford. And not even it deserves to be
co-billed with BEHOLD A PALE HORSE, starring Gregory Peck
and Anthony Quinn. In spite of its impressively Biblical title (in
tended, no doubt to give it stature or something), it is a complete
wipeout and should be avoided at all costs.
Michael Caine is still wrestling with THE IPCRESS FILE at the
Varsity. He is a real spy involved with real enemy-types, as opposed
to the glittering and flambuoyant, but hopelessly unreal, James
Bond variety.
