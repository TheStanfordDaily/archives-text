### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
When the Repertory Theater
opens its first season this Wed
nesday in Memorial Auditorium
opening nighters will have first
look at a new interpretation of
"That Scoundrel Scapin."
In discussing his approach,
director Erik Vos said, " 'Scapin'
is a play of strong passions. The
traditional fathers Pantalone
and Dottore and the servant Sca
pin never learn to restrain their
emotions; their reactions are un
controlled and primitive.
"To accentuate this passionate
essence we have, in the farce
style of the Commedia dell' Arte,
turned to the use of masks. Mo
liere himself was strongly in
fluenced by the Commedia,
which dealt with this same in
triguing balance between pas
sion and reason. For "Scapin,"
Moliere also borrowed from the
improvisational techniques of
the Italian actors who shared
for many years his theater in
Paris.
Strolling Players
"We present "Scapin" like a
company of these 18th century
Italian actors, a poor company
of strolling players which ar
rives in a small town and per
forms t he play of the scoundrel."
("Like" is an apt word, for
the Repertory Theater arrived
at Stanford on t lic> gilded winjjs
of a $300,000 Rockefeller grant.
Additional funds for its budget
are being provided by the Uni
versity, and the company is also
teaching in the MPA program
here.)
Gerald Hiken, familiar to
Stanford audiences, will play the
scoundrelly Scapin. The settings
were designed by Richard Hay;
the costumes, by Douglas
Russell. Lighting is under the
direction of Paul Laundry.
