## Guild's 'Godot' Production Flawed But Still Excellent 
### AL HEINEMAN 
It is always a hit unfair to dis
cuss the production of a small,
semi-professional company, us
ing sophisticated standards. I
think, however, it is more of a
disservice to the "Waiting for
Godot" of the Peninsula Relig
ious Drama Guild to compro
mise those standards.
Two reasons for this state
ment: first, that a verdict of
"It's good, for what it is" doesn't
tell anyone anything. Secondly,
though, and more important,
the Drama Guild's production is,
in a couple of ways, every bit
the equal of its more elaborate
counterparts.
Easily the most impressive
part of the play was the acting
job of Vince Bontempi, as Estra
gon, one of the two hoboes—
symbols of man's depraved and
spiritually bereft condition —
who are on stage during the en
tire two-and-a-half hour perfor
ma nee.
Bontempi is funny, frightened,
argumentative, wise in his be
fuddledment —each as the occa
sion demands. He is vitally alive
on stage, relating to and build
ing on the moods of the other
characters.
Actor-Director
Tom Luce, director of the pro
duction, plays Vladimar, the oth
er outcast-protagonist. Possibly,
his double dufy gives him too
much to think about, and it
should be said that the part is
the more difficult of the two, for
Vladimar is wiser, sager, saner,
more serious than Estragon. Un
der those handicaps, Luce per
forms creditably but not excep
tionally.
He is quite effective when the
action is overtly comic, less so
when the two are acutely alone,
when the drama is at its most
intense. Luce does not draw
from Bontempi as Bontempi
from Luce; Luce is wooden, Bon
tempi vibrant.
But if his acting can be fault
ed, Luce's direction, and espe
cially his pacing, seem to me
masterful. If the first act, longer
by far than the second, slows
somewhat at its conclusion, the
second, final act fairly hurtles
to its ambiguous and unnerving
conclusion.
Interpretation of Acts
And L u c e ' s interpretation
strikes me as exactly right in all
aspects. He states on the pro
gram that he has "tried to re
spect (the play's) ambiguity as
I think Beckett would have us
respect the ambiguity of exist
ence."
In the original play, "Godot"
either is or is not God, who
either is or is not coming to the
rescue of man; in the Drama
Guild's version, Godot must
needs be God, and the Tree—the
only piece of real scenery on

stage—is a cross, and never just
a tree.
But that simplification is, I
think, the only departure from
Beckett's intentions. The ac
tion, correct in almost every
case, seems, as it must in a good
play, inevitable. This is largely
Luce's, doing.
Difficult Rob
in the difficult part of the
boorish, materialistic, powerful
(and later, impotent) Pozzo,
Michael Linenthal has some fine
moments, but tney are all but
lost amid his generally excessive
mannerisms. Caricatured roles
require a degree of subtlety
which Linenthal never attains.
He seems a gifted comedian;
the role needs more.
John Kulsar, as Lucky, Poz
zo's "menial," stands and looks
adequately tortured, imbecilic,
and oppressed throughout al
most the entire time he is on
stage. His long Hong, long) so
liloquy is powerfully delivered,
(hough it is the weakest part of
the play as Beckett wrote it.
Jim Hayes, as The Boy, deliv
ers his few lines in a monotone.
I assume that is what he was
told to do.
The production, in sum. has
flaws. They are outweighed by
a great many surprisingly good
qualities. Beckett remains the
finest of the so-called absurd
playwrights; "Waiting for Go
dot" remains the finest of his
plays. It should be seen, and the
Drama Guild does it credit.
