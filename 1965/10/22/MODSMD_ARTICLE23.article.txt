## Indians To Attack Army 
### ART ROSENZWEIG 
If the United States Army has
any intentions of coming out
west this Saturday to put down
Indian restlessness, they may be
in for a surprise. The Indians
are quite ready to do battle.
"The team is anxious to play
again," warned varsity mentor
John Ralston, "After the game
at Southern Cal, they were a
little down in spirit, but they
bounced back pretty quickly in
practice this week and are ready
to meet Army."
Both learns have similar
strengths; most evidently on
defense, which probably will

make for a low-scoring contest.
Military Academy Head Coach
Paul F. Dietzel places a great
deal of stress on the importance
of a bold, hard-hitting defense;
as indeed the Stanford staff
does.
Diet/el's defense, sparked by
All-American prospect Center
Townsend Clare Ki-2, 210), has
limited their losers to a total
of 13 points in three games, and
held Notre Dame to its lowest
scoring of the year.
Weak Offense
Offensively, however, th e
Cadets seem to lack the organ
ized thrust needed for high scor
ing against a firm defense.
Army hasn't found the one go
team that will click every time,
though several players have

taken individual spotlights. Tail
back Sonny Stowers has gained
443 yards in 102 carries while
Fullback Mark Hamilton has
305 yards from."32 trips. Sub
sequently, Army ordinarily
keeps to the ground.
Stanford, on the other hand,
will be able to employ a varied
attack, especially now that
Quarterback Dave Lewis' leg is
sufficiently healed for him to do
some running on his own. Full
back John Read, who went 95

yards in 15 carries against
Southern Cal, and Halfback Ray
Handley, who netted 77 that
game and the squad in
yards gained rushing, add real
power to the offensive plow. If
Lewis finds aerial accuracy, that
could he the decisive factor.
Army's Season
T'.i's far this season the Black
Knights have overwhelmed Vir
ginia Military Institute 21-7, Bos
lon College 20-0 and Rutgers
23-6. which was last week. They
have been shut out by two
strong squads: Tennessee, 21-0,
and Notre Dame, 17-0. Stanford
stands 3-1-1 for the season with
victories over San Jose State,
Air Force and Oregon, a loss to
Southern Cal, and a stalemate
with Navy. In A A WIT play, the

Indians have one win and one
loss.
Stanford and Army have met
on the gridiron four times in "the
past. Stanford took the first two
(26-0 in 192 Sand 34-13 in 1929),
and the Corps took the latter
pair (43-0 in 1948 and 7-0 in
1950). Saturday's contest will be
the tie-breaker.
Twice in History
The Indians had all three
service academies on the sched
ule this yeai', a feat, done only

once before in history. The first
was by Pen State in !9(i2. The
Indians will meet the Black
Knights again in 1967.
Saturday's game is not in con
ference Inii it is nevertheless an
important one for both squads.
Stanford looks to reau-ertain its
mighty grid potential which was
somewhat subdued during last
week's fourth quarter. Army is
looking for its first major win
of the season. With both teams
equally determined, there ough*
to he plenty of good football
on hand for the 50,000 spectators
expected.
BAND DAY
The Stanford-Army game will
be accompanied by the annual
Band Day sponsored by Stan
ford University.
Each year Stanford invites
high school marching bands
from the surrounding region to
come and participate in the pre
game and halftime entertain
ment. This year nearly 3000 high
school students will be in the
program.

stands 3-1-1 for the season with
victories over San Jose State,
Air Force and Oregon, a loss to
Southern Cal, and a stalemate
with Navy. In A A WIT play, the

Indians have one win and one
loss.
Stanford and Army have met
on the gridiron four times in "the
past. Stanford took the first two
(26-0 in 192 Sand 34-13 in 1929),
and the Corps took the latter
pair (43-0 in 1948 and 7-0 in
1950). Saturday's contest will be
the tie-breaker.
Twice in History
The Indians had all three
service academies on the sched
ule this yeai', a feat, done only

once before in history. The first
was by Pen State in !9(i2. The
Indians will meet the Black
Knights again in 1967.
Saturday's game is not in con
ference Inii it is nevertheless an
important one for both squads.
Stanford looks to reau-ertain its
mighty grid potential which was
somewhat subdued during last
week's fourth quarter. Army is
looking for its first major win
of the season. With both teams
equally determined, there ough*
to he plenty of good football
on hand for the 50,000 spectators
expected.
BAND DAY
The Stanford-Army game will
be accompanied by the annual
Band Day sponsored by Stan
ford University.
Each year Stanford invites
high school marching bands
from the surrounding region to
come and participate in the pre
game and halftime entertain
ment. This year nearly 3000 high
school students will be in the
program.

If the United States Army has
any intentions of coming out
west this Saturday to put down
Indian restlessness, they may be
in for a surprise. The Indians
are quite ready to do battle.
"The team is anxious to play
again," warned varsity mentor
John Ralston, "After the game
at Southern Cal, they were a
little down in spirit, but they
bounced back pretty quickly in
practice this week and are ready
to meet Army."
Both learns have similar
strengths; most evidently on
defense, which probably will

make for a low-scoring contest.
Military Academy Head Coach
Paul F. Dietzel places a great
deal of stress on the importance
of a bold, hard-hitting defense;
as indeed the Stanford staff
does.
Diet/el's defense, sparked by
All-American prospect Center
Townsend Clare Ki-2, 210), has
limited their losers to a total
of 13 points in three games, and
held Notre Dame to its lowest
scoring of the year.
Weak Offense
Offensively, however, th e
Cadets seem to lack the organ
ized thrust needed for high scor
ing against a firm defense.
Army hasn't found the one go
team that will click every time,
though several players have

taken individual spotlights. Tail
back Sonny Stowers has gained
443 yards in 102 carries while
Fullback Mark Hamilton has
305 yards from."32 trips. Sub
sequently, Army ordinarily
keeps to the ground.
Stanford, on the other hand,
will be able to employ a varied
attack, especially now that
Quarterback Dave Lewis' leg is
sufficiently healed for him to do
some running on his own. Full
back John Read, who went 95

yards in 15 carries against
Southern Cal, and Halfback Ray
Handley, who netted 77 that
game and the squad in
yards gained rushing, add real
power to the offensive plow. If
Lewis finds aerial accuracy, that
could he the decisive factor.
