# PAVILLION PROGRESS
## 
### 
Athletic Director Chuck Tay
lor reports that the fund drive
for a new athletic pavillion "is
making god progress, but the
target is still more than $900,000
away."
As of mid-September the total
amount of gifts received had
gone beyond the $1,500,000
mark, with the $1,200,000 Roscoe
Maples bequest providing the
bulk of the current total.
The cost for the 8,000-seat
Pavillion will run just above
$2,500,000, but alternate plans
will provide a 6,000 seat Pavil
lion at a savings of some $300,-
000.
Aeording to Director Taylor,
"We have the complete 8,000-
seat facility as our target, and
we are going to do our level
best, in cooperation with the
Development Ofice, to see this
project is entirely funded by the
end of the year, and the con
struction is able to start in mid
-1966. Plans still call for a major
dedication basketball tourna
ment in December of 1967."
