## 
### JOE HERNANDEZ 
Stanford's Frosh Footballers,
touted as the best ever, host the
San Jose State Frosh Saturday
at 10 a.m. in a preliminary to
the varsity game with Army.
Last week the Frosh won
their first game as Indians,
beating USC, 24-13. Coach Dick
Vermeil's charges thoroughly
trounced the Trobabes, outgain
ing them by over 100 yards. The
Papooses gained 296 yards on
the ground.
Broughton Shines
Although there were numer
ous outstanding performers,
Coach Vermeil singled out three
of his players for extra praise:
offensive and defensive end
George Buehler, tackle Danny
Fulkerson, and fullback Greg
Broughton.
Broughton carried the ball 24
times for 120 yards and two
touchdowns. Quarterback Gene
Washington gained 38 yards
rushing and completed 4 of 8
passes for 73 more yards.
The San Jose State Frosh also
have a good quarterback to
guide their predominantly pass
ing attack. He is Bob Munsen,

younger brother of Los Angeles
Ram quarterback Bill Munsen. j
Playecl S.J.'s
The Indian J.V.'s played San '
Jose's Frosh earlier in the year
and beat them, 23-17.
One of the few disappoint
ments of the USC game was the
number of fumbles. The Pap
ooses lost the handle nine times.
Six of those times the Trobabes
recovered (he ball, but fortu
nately, they weren't able to cap
italize on any of the mistakes.
Coach Vermeil attributed Ihe |
fumbles to the fact that this !
was the first time that the play- j
ers had played another college j
team.
Few Injuries
The only injury of the game
was an ankle sprain to Bob
Heffernan. He will be ready to
play Saturday, but Vermeil
plans to start Phil Messer in
his offensive guard spot and
Mike Herning in his defensive
tackle spot.
After today's contest the i
Frosh have two more tilts to go. I
Saturday, Oct. 30, they play Cal
and Friday, Nov. 5, they play i
UCLA.
