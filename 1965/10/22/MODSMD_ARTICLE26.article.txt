SOUTH BEND, Ind. Notre
Dame's patented strategy of ball
control faces a big probWn in
Saturday's nationally televised
football game with powerful
Southern California.
It's how to get the ball away
from Mike Carrett, the stubby i
Trojan rocket, who is the na
tion's best, if not busiest, major
college ballcarrier.
The 5-foot-9, 189 pound Gar
rett tops the NCAA rushing col
umn with 852 yards on 150 car
ries. '■
That means the Trojans have
called on Garrett for an average
of 30 whacks a game, producing
170.4 yards each contest, in ty
ing Minnesota 20-20 and march
ing over Wisconsin 26-6, Oregon
Slate 26-12, Washington 34-0 and
Stanford 14-0.
Notre Dame's position-and- i
possession team, so tabbed by
Coach Ara Parseghian, ranks
No. 7 in the AP poll after
whomping California 48 6, being
upset by Purdue 25-21, and top- '
ping Northwestern 38-7 and
Army 17-0.
Despite Garrett and higher
Trojan ranking, the oddsmakers !
have made Notre Dame a one j
touchdown favorite, probably
because the Irish will have a
partisan, sellout throng of 59,000
whooping it up for them.
