# Poloists Vie With Jose
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity walor polo
ists, with a 6-1 record tucked
into their suits, embark today
on what may be their toughest
eight days of the 190.") schedule.
The Indians travel to meet
San Jose State tonight and host
the San Francisco Olympic
Club tomorrow morning at
11:00.

Next week, the tribe meets
SF Slate and then Foothill away.
Finally, the Cards take on UC
LA in an attempt to wrest the
nation's number one rating from
the Bruin paws.
San Jose State has one of
their strongest teams in years.
The Spartans have a large num
ber of returning lettermen and

several outstanding junior col
lego transfers.
Spartans l><vp in '(>")
Another factor which contrib
utes to the Spartans' strength
this year is their great depth.
The deep bench will also in
fluenee the 1 San Jose game strat
egy. Last year, the Spartans
fouled ten men out of the game
but still managed a 13-11 victory
over the Indians in the San Jose
pool.
San Jose's pool has a three
foot shallow end. The Spartans
will probably throw up a tight
/one defense to thwart Stanford
shots at the big shallow end
goal.
After the San Jose tilt, the
Cards meet the San Francisco
Olympic Club here. The Olym
pic Club must always be con
sidered a threat to a wining rec
ord. The () Club defeated Foot
hill in the finals of the NorCai
Open last season, and has lost
no one from that squad.
Olympic C lub Impressive
The Olympic Club draws its
members from the ranks of e.v
college water polo standouts.
Many of the O Club's members
are ex-Olympians.
Put together such an elite en
tourage of water polo excellence
and release all the frustrations
of a coaching or a business car
eer, and behold! You've got a
tough team to beat.
The Indians don't have much
time to rest after the weekend's
games. The tribe travels to the
City to meet the SF State Dons
on Tuesday. Wednesday after
noon. the Indians foot it to the
Hill for a showdown with the
Owls.
Stanford worked past Foot
hill, 6-4, in a game earlier this
year at Stanford. The Owls will
be looking to regain their berth
in the national standings, and
it will be hard to deny them in
their homo pool.
Frosh Fall to Await
Stanford's frosh squad met
their first defeat in six games
as they fell to Await High
school, 8-7, yesterday.
Await, probably the best high
school water polo team in nor
thern California, used a full
court press to stifle the Pa
pooses' scoring attack.
Luis Nicolao scored five goals
and Dick Pu>th two in a losing
cause. The frosh meet San Jose's
frosh this evening and the Olym
pic Club JV's at 10:00 a.m. to
morrow. here.


Action I'rom yesterday's freshman water polo game which saw
the Papooses drop their first game of the season. (See above story).
