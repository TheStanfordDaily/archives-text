# 'Double Jeopardy' Repudiated
## 
### 
In a session marked by proliferous
petty Parliamentary argument and
three unsuccessful motions to adjourn,
Legislature last night passed a reso
lution stating that no student should
be subject to double jeopardy in
ASSU judicial proceedings.
The resolution will serve as a di
rective to the Committee oi' Fifteen,
which will study the present appeal.**
system, and to any appeals board that
might be created by that Committee.

LASSU put off until next week a
resolution calling for investigation in
to the possibility of establishing an
exchange program with students in
Red China.
Censuring Vandalism
In other business, LASSU spent 45
minutes debating and passing a reso
lution censuring "organized vandal
ism and harrassment," as was ex
perienced by participants in the 00-

hour vigil of the Stanford Committee
for Peace in Vietnam.
Prior to this, the body defeated a
motion to adjourn by a vote of 19-37.
The Legislature also approved an
appropriation of $330 to send an lIR
delegate to the Conference on the
Atlantic Community in Washington,
I>.C., and one of $300 to allow Daily
Editor Steve Leopold to attend the
National Foreign Policy Conference

for Editors and Broadcasters, also in
Washington.
ARFEP Appropriation
After lengthy debate, LASSU de
cided to appropriate $50 to the Amer
icans for Reappraisal of Far Eastern
Policy (ARFEP) in order to finance
a forum this Sunday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
By a 7-vote margin, il was decided
that the funds would be given to the

Political Union with the stipulation
that they then be given to ARFEP.
The original bill had provided for
the $30 to be given to ARFEP through
the National Student Association.
The dates for the Annual Autumn
Election, which includes the election
of graduate LASSU representatives
and head yell leader, was set for Nov.
15 and 10. LASSU passed a bill giving
one representative to the 51 freshman
sponsors who have hitherto been un
represented.
Amendments
LASSU also passed three minor
constitutional amendments which will
come before the student body for a
vote in the November election. One
provided that ex officio members can
be appointed to the Legislature ac
cording to the By-Laws.
The other provided that a student
planning to run for the Legis
lature must "intend to be a member
of the constituency he seeks to rep
resent and to fill the office until the
expiration of his full term."
The bill sanctions spring elections
for the following fall's representatives.
Previously, this was an uncertain
point in the ASSU Constitution.
Also sponsored was a $375 loan to
Holladay House for a TV set. The
loan will be repaid over a two-year
period.
