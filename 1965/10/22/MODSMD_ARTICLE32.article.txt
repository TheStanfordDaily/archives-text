## Student Responsibility 
### 
Education entails obligation. While of course it brings its own
rewards, the primary public purpose behind it—so far as under
graduates are concerned at least—is to prepare citizens for leader
ship—or at least for responsible participation in the life of the
eonimunit). I* seems inescapable, therefore, that the educational
process itself should involve responsibility—and afford opportuni
ics for leadership. To divorce education—higher education
\specially—from real life would be to thwart its purpose.
It is for this reason that we regard as eminently sensible the
Irifl ol discussion at the conference just completed here of the
\mer!can Council on Education looking toward giving students a
'argei voice in shaping college policy and curriculum. The way to
beget responsibility in young people is to treat them as responsible.
In colleges, students are of an age at which they may be called
ipon to bear arms in the defense of their country; and most of
tlieni before completing a college education have already become
voters. They are adults and will respond best to acceptance as
such.
Moreover, as several educators sensibly pointed out, students
are less likely to rebel against policies they have a share in shaping.
Their recent uprising, particularly last year at the Berkeley campus
of the University of California, seem to have been in a large meas
ure expressions of frustration and resentment at their anonymity
and their alienation from the faculty.
Students need to learn of course, that participation in tlic
shaping of policy means an acceptance of decisions made by ma
jority rule; and this may entail compromise and even rejection of
what they desire. The) need to learn that noise and disorder aro
admissible means of protest only for those to whom orderly chan
nels of expression have been closed. They need to remember that
colleges and universities are institutions of learning where the
rights and interests ot those engaged in scholarship and research
—who ma\' legitimately feel no involvement in current controversy'
—must be respected.
In grappling, as they should, with the great decisions affecting
national policy outside the campuses where they arc studying,
students must learn to reckon with the real, and often trouble
some facts of life rather than with abstractions and ideas alone.
And the) must learn to rely on reasoned argument, not on the
mere shouting down of opinions, of which they disapprove. They
must learn tolerance and the importance of consensus. It is
altogether right, however, that they should hold, and express,
opinions on national affairs and that they should play an orderly
and responsible part in winning general acceptance of their
□pinions.
These are the obligations of citizenship. The learning, and the
practice, of all this will be the essence of their education.

Education entails obligation. While of course it brings its own
rewards, the primary public purpose behind it—so far as under
graduates are concerned at least—is to prepare citizens for leader
ship—or at least for responsible participation in the life of the
eonimunit). I* seems inescapable, therefore, that the educational
process itself should involve responsibility—and afford opportuni
ics for leadership. To divorce education—higher education
\specially—from real life would be to thwart its purpose.
It is for this reason that we regard as eminently sensible the
Irifl ol discussion at the conference just completed here of the
\mer!can Council on Education looking toward giving students a
'argei voice in shaping college policy and curriculum. The way to
beget responsibility in young people is to treat them as responsible.
In colleges, students are of an age at which they may be called
ipon to bear arms in the defense of their country; and most of
tlieni before completing a college education have already become
voters. They are adults and will respond best to acceptance as
such.
Moreover, as several educators sensibly pointed out, students
are less likely to rebel against policies they have a share in shaping.
Their recent uprising, particularly last year at the Berkeley campus
of the University of California, seem to have been in a large meas
ure expressions of frustration and resentment at their anonymity
and their alienation from the faculty.
