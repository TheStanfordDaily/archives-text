## An Assumption About ARFEP 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
I wish to clarify one aspect
of the Americans for Reapprais
al of Far Eastern Policy which
you reported in yesterday's
paper.
The support which I am offer
ing to ARFEP hinges on one im
portant assumption which I un
destand the national organiza
tion is also willing to make but
which has not been given the
publicity it deserves.
My assumption is that a pro
posal for a cease-fire does not
require a withdrawal of Ameri
can armed forces from Vietnam.
1 would myself personally op
pose any lessening of our pres
ent military power in the Far
East.

• Oil The Grape Strike
A letter from the Rev. James
L. Drake, Minister of the United
Church of Christ, associated
with the California Migrant
Ministry in Kern and Tulare
counties:
The strike of the grape
workers against the growers
of Kern and Tulare counties
is now in its seventh week.
The grounds of the strike
have ben carefully considered
by the staff of the California
Migrant Ministry of the Nor
thern and Southern Council
of Churches. The strike has
the full support of the Mi
grant Ministry.
There appears to be increas
ing presure from the growers
on the Sheriff's Department
of Kern County to lean on the
strikers, for example, forty
four strikers were taken from
the line on Tuesday and jailed
for shouting their slogan
"Huelga!" (Strike!) on the
line. The charge was unlaw
ful asembly.
None of the strikers has
been charged with any act of
violence, although it is re
ported that there have been
six arrests of the growers or

their representatives for vio
lence against the pickets.
The growers have been
from the beginning and are
still unwilling to negotiate.
This is not in the best tradi
tion of collective bargaining
in a free economy, nor is it
within the Christian tradition
of the recognition of human
dignity and reconciliation.
The Migrant Ministry asks
the churches' support for the
people who are making their
claim on a share in the Amer
ican dream. These people
need your support in prayer,
in money and fod and cloth
ing.
The preceding letter l'rom Jim
Drake came to us as a group of
concerned churchmen in the
mid-peninsula area. We have
been to see for ourselves. We
urge the local churches to give
the practical support which Jim
calls for.
One of our number, Carl
Smith, minister at Community
House in East Palo Alto was one
of seven churchmen jailed for
unlawful assembly last Tuesday.

An article in Friday's Now
York Times describes the efforts
at Yale University to give great
er priority to teaching perfor
mance. They intend to ask high
ranking students upon gradua
tion lo give "written appraisal

of strengths and weaknesses of
their educational experience in
lectures, discussions and semi
nars," in order to aid the system
of faculty appointments. They j
hope to modify the phrase "Pub-!
lish or Perish," so that it be
comes "Publish and Teach or
Perish."
I am bringing this up because |
I believe it deals with an impor-1
lant issue that Stanford must be !
concerned with, teaching effec
tiveness. I feci safe in assuming
that most Stanford students
have sat through some extreme
ly dull and disorganized courses.
These courses may have been i
taught by men who are out- (
standing figures in their disci- j
pline. However, this does not '
overshadow the fact that they i
are poor teachers. My question
is does it have to be this way?
Perhaps not, if through stu
dent participation in faculty •
evaluation a greater awareness |
of teaching deficiency could be j
achieved. The inevitable ques
tion is then what? Well, elemen
tary and secondary school teach
ers acquire training in classroom
instruction before undertaking
teaching. This is not the easel
with college professors, but in
structional courses could be ex
tended to them while they are'
involved in the teaching process. I
Also, if more attention and I
weight is given to teacher per- \
formance Ihere may be more
motivation to improve it. I am
sure there are also other means
by which the same end, im
proved teaching effectiveness,
could be achieved. Yet, will a
sustained effort to give greater
priority to teacher performance
be initiated without qualified
student participation in faculty
evaluation?

• Oil The Grape Strike
A letter from the Rev. James
L. Drake, Minister of the United
Church of Christ, associated
with the California Migrant
Ministry in Kern and Tulare
counties:
The strike of the grape
workers against the growers
of Kern and Tulare counties
is now in its seventh week.
The grounds of the strike
have ben carefully considered
by the staff of the California
Migrant Ministry of the Nor
thern and Southern Council
of Churches. The strike has
the full support of the Mi
grant Ministry.
There appears to be increas
ing presure from the growers
on the Sheriff's Department
of Kern County to lean on the
strikers, for example, forty
four strikers were taken from
the line on Tuesday and jailed
for shouting their slogan
"Huelga!" (Strike!) on the
line. The charge was unlaw
ful asembly.
None of the strikers has
been charged with any act of
violence, although it is re
ported that there have been
six arrests of the growers or

their representatives for vio
lence against the pickets.
The growers have been
from the beginning and are
still unwilling to negotiate.
This is not in the best tradi
tion of collective bargaining
in a free economy, nor is it
within the Christian tradition
of the recognition of human
dignity and reconciliation.
The Migrant Ministry asks
the churches' support for the
people who are making their
claim on a share in the Amer
ican dream. These people
need your support in prayer,
in money and fod and cloth
ing.
The preceding letter l'rom Jim
Drake came to us as a group of
concerned churchmen in the
mid-peninsula area. We have
been to see for ourselves. We
urge the local churches to give
the practical support which Jim
calls for.
One of our number, Carl
Smith, minister at Community
House in East Palo Alto was one
of seven churchmen jailed for
unlawful assembly last Tuesday.

An article in Friday's Now
York Times describes the efforts
at Yale University to give great
er priority to teaching perfor
mance. They intend to ask high
ranking students upon gradua
tion lo give "written appraisal

of strengths and weaknesses of
their educational experience in
lectures, discussions and semi
nars," in order to aid the system
of faculty appointments. They j
hope to modify the phrase "Pub-!
lish or Perish," so that it be
comes "Publish and Teach or
Perish."
I am bringing this up because |
I believe it deals with an impor-1
lant issue that Stanford must be !
concerned with, teaching effec
tiveness. I feci safe in assuming
that most Stanford students
have sat through some extreme
ly dull and disorganized courses.
These courses may have been i
taught by men who are out- (
standing figures in their disci- j
pline. However, this does not '
overshadow the fact that they i
are poor teachers. My question
is does it have to be this way?
Perhaps not, if through stu
dent participation in faculty •
evaluation a greater awareness |
of teaching deficiency could be j
achieved. The inevitable ques
tion is then what? Well, elemen
tary and secondary school teach
ers acquire training in classroom
instruction before undertaking
teaching. This is not the easel
with college professors, but in
structional courses could be ex
tended to them while they are'
involved in the teaching process. I
Also, if more attention and I
weight is given to teacher per- \
formance Ihere may be more
motivation to improve it. I am
sure there are also other means
by which the same end, im
proved teaching effectiveness,
could be achieved. Yet, will a
sustained effort to give greater
priority to teacher performance
be initiated without qualified
student participation in faculty
evaluation?

the full support of the Mi
grant Ministry.
There appears to be increas
ing presure from the growers
on the Sheriff's Department
of Kern County to lean on the
strikers, for example, forty
four strikers were taken from
the line on Tuesday and jailed
for shouting their slogan
"Huelga!" (Strike!) on the
line. The charge was unlaw
ful asembly.
None of the strikers has
been charged with any act of
violence, although it is re
ported that there have been
six arrests of the growers or

their representatives for vio
lence against the pickets.
The growers have been
from the beginning and are
still unwilling to negotiate.
This is not in the best tradi
tion of collective bargaining
in a free economy, nor is it
within the Christian tradition
of the recognition of human
dignity and reconciliation.
The Migrant Ministry asks
the churches' support for the
people who are making their
claim on a share in the Amer
ican dream. These people
need your support in prayer,
in money and fod and cloth
ing.
The preceding letter l'rom Jim
Drake came to us as a group of
concerned churchmen in the
mid-peninsula area. We have
been to see for ourselves. We
urge the local churches to give
the practical support which Jim
calls for.
One of our number, Carl

House in East Palo Alto was one
of seven churchmen jailed for
unlawful assembly last Tuesday.

An article in Friday's Now
York Times describes the efforts
at Yale University to give great
er priority to teaching perfor
mance. They intend to ask high
ranking students upon gradua
tion lo give "written appraisal

of strengths and weaknesses of
their educational experience in
lectures, discussions and semi
nars," in order to aid the system
of faculty appointments. They j
hope to modify the phrase "Pub-!
lish or Perish," so that it be
comes "Publish and Teach or
Perish."
I am bringing this up because |
I believe it deals with an impor-1
lant issue that Stanford must be !
concerned with, teaching effec
tiveness. I feci safe in assuming
that most Stanford students
have sat through some extreme
ly dull and disorganized courses.
These courses may have been i
taught by men who are out- (
standing figures in their disci- j
pline. However, this does not '
overshadow the fact that they i
are poor teachers. My question
is does it have to be this way?
Perhaps not, if through stu
dent participation in faculty •
evaluation a greater awareness |
of teaching deficiency could be j
achieved. The inevitable ques
tion is then what? Well, elemen
tary and secondary school teach
ers acquire training in classroom
instruction before undertaking
teaching. This is not the easel
with college professors, but in
structional courses could be ex
tended to them while they are'
involved in the teaching process. I
Also, if more attention and I
weight is given to teacher per- \
formance Ihere may be more
motivation to improve it. I am
sure there are also other means
by which the same end, im
proved teaching effectiveness,
could be achieved. Yet, will a
sustained effort to give greater
priority to teacher performance
be initiated without qualified
student participation in faculty
evaluation?

I wish to clarify one aspect
of the Americans for Reapprais
al of Far Eastern Policy which
you reported in yesterday's
paper.
The support which I am offer
ing to ARFEP hinges on one im
portant assumption which I un
destand the national organiza
tion is also willing to make but
which has not been given the
publicity it deserves.
My assumption is that a pro
posal for a cease-fire does not
require a withdrawal of Ameri
can armed forces from Vietnam.

pose any lessening of our pres
ent military power in the Far
