## They Make A Desert And Call It Peace

A New York Times analysis of the views of Senators
who have been publicly silent (based on off-the-record
interviews) indicated that these men are convinced that
the Saigon Government is incapable of inspiring any de
gree of popular support or the will to fight, and, of more
interest, that they doubt that South Vietnam is essential
to American security. Our commitment is only to supply
advisers and equipment. But, they say, the President is
on the spot. And they themselves have no alternatives to
suggest.
What can be done? We expect, at the least, Congres
sional hearings and debates on the issues represented in
the war. It is clear that present China policy must be re
formulated, that Vietnam musi be negotiated as part of
the entire Southeast Asia problem. Negotiations are
settlements of actual power situations.
Missed Opportunities
We have missed opportunities to negotiate at times
when Hanoi and the Soviet Union would have joined the
Viet Cong at the conference table; when willing to nego
tiate we have usually been several months behind the
realities of the situation in our conditions for negotiation,
but it has more often been the case that we have not been
willing and that we have thwarted efforts by such Saigon
governments as those of Duong Van Minh and Quat.
Now that the time has come when our policy is com
mit tori to the belief that the war must end in negotiation,
and (we would hope) the sooner the better, we shall have
to encourage a different sort of Government in Saigon
than we now have. We shall have to work as hard at re
placing the present puppet as we worked to discourage
Premier Quat, under whose regime neutralist sentiment
had grown strong. The Quat faction may well be the only
group that can prevent further polarization of forces
and provide the basis for negotiations.
The bombing of North Vietnam must be stopped at
once, as an indication of our sincerity in seeking negotia
tions if for no belter reason. This bombing, which fol
lowed the attack on Pleiku by the VC. although more
closely tied to tho deteriorating political situation in Sai
gon. has consolidated Communist opinion and served to
strengthen the militants over those groups willing to
enter discussions. We should at once plan for a UN
border force and election supervision machinery. A de
militarized area of negotiation should be established at
the 17th Parallel. The Geneva Conference should bo re
convened land there i> more or less general agreement

that the Conferences of 19.V1 and '62 provide the proper
precedent i.and the National Liberation Front recognized
as a party to the negotiations. A general amnesty for all
political forces would have to be granted.
Austrian State Treaty
Several commentators have suggested that the Aus
trian State Treaty, guaranteed by the UN, be used as a
model for a treaty establishing an independent and demo
cratic South Vietnam. (There also appears to be agree
ment that North and South Vietnam continue as separate
states.)
Every effort would be made to check infiltration from
the north. Terms of a phased withdrawal of American
and other outside military forces from Southeast Asia, as
a first step toward the nonalignment of the nations of this
area, would be negotiated. Our country should then join
with other nations in an international program of eco
nomic and social development < the Lower Mekong "TVA."
etc.) of that area.
We may win this war and leave behind us a desert.
Bernard Kail uses a quote from Tacitus ("They have made
a desert, and have called it peace") to answer a distortion
of his views. South Vietnam, he writes, "plowed under by
bombers and artillery and still in the hands of a politically
irrelevant regime, may become the victim of aroused
social and political forces for which no aircraft carrier
and eight-jet bomber can prov ide a ready answer in the
long run." (New Rejmblie, 9 October.)
This is the dilemma. Rut the whole story takes on tho
dimensions of Attic tragedy when we realize that these
fruits are purchased at the price of national honor. There
is no end to what national honor can be used to legitimate.
President Johnson has played what even his strongest
critic must admit is a clever game -but this invocation of
national honor suggests an uneasiness on his part.
Label the Tacti<*s
One duty of teachers in our kind of free society is to
produce the appropriate label for such tactics. We Ameri
cans have embarked on an anti-Communist crusade, a
quasi-religious mission, and we are in danger of forget
ting that our resources (material and spiritual) are lim
ited. and that successes against a particular revolution
will be paid for by loss of support in other parts of the
world. We may find ourselves defending the status quo
when we know it to be unjust and indefensible.
Wo may find ourselves convinced that all problems
will yield to moral conviction and military efficiency. Hid
the world is not like this, and the terrible simplifications
of this moralism, which is easily mobilized to destroy
whole societies, can bring disaster.
There has been a marked deterioration in Iho quality

of public and private life in this country. The problem
lias been discussed by Hans Morgenthau and, more re
cently. by Henry Steele Commager, who has documented
our national hubris a long line of double standards
which, as he sees it. has culminated in the belief that we
can decide that it is better for someone else to be dead
lhan Red. (Saturday Review, 10 July.»
Cominager "Too Harsh"
Professor Commager is too harsh. There is a mood of
desperation in our land, and it is the result of repeated
frustration as we have tried to make military power the
major instrument of international policy. As a result, of
a kind of desperation we have been willing to take ex
treme action. A concomitant of this has been a somewhat
cavalier attitude toward the rule of law. We have ratified
the conventions dealing wilh Ihe treatment of prisoners,
but one has only to read Life (12 Jc 'Gl> to learn that
Americans too can disregard such norms.
Congress has become a silent partner of the executive:
few wish to give the impression of disunity while Ameri
can boys are dying. And our representatives know per
fectly well thai the American public is sensitive to possi
bilities of "softness on communism." Probably most of
our Congressmen feel that events have taken control, or,
as James Reston puts it. aiv now used as a form of "black
mail." especially after the decision lo launch a military
invasion of Cuba was undertaken without any parlieipa*
tion of the Congress.
Seymour Melman luts argued that there is i\ general
feeling in our country 1 hat issues are so complicated that
they can only be understood by experts. This has encour
aged a tendency to identify with authorities, repealing
official views with a kind of anxious insistence more
anxious, perhaps, because of the difficulties in complete
acceptance of the official morality. The total budget of
the years 1933 39 was exceeded last year by our defense
budget alone. What did it buy? What did it not buy?
Obsession with "Gaps"
A year or two ago we were obsessed with "gaps"—
missile and otherwise. The direct spending on "overkill,"
according to Melman, was between $110 and $116 billion
< 1957 but of course the cost is greater for those re
sources could be used to provide goods and services.
But now 1 take flight into Utopian realms. It is wiser,
in this age, to have a few ideals and to talk tough. There
is a kind of defensive cynicism which has much mileage
these days.
It is probably true that the present conflict in South
east Asia has not yet become the moral issue that civil
rights has become. It is probably true, but I am myself
not prepared to say that this is so.
