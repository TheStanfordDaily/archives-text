The Third Annual Lagunita Seca
Road Race gets under way tomorrow
morning. The rally, sponsored by Al
pha Sigma Phi and Delta Kappa Epsi
ion fraternities, has attracted more
than 25 entries to race for trophies
and other prizes.
In contrast to past years, the course
for the race is in excellent condition.
The dry lake bed of Lake Lagunita
will be fast and dry, for the speed
demons who will tackle the .8 mile
obstacle course.
This year's "Seca" is divided into
four categories: American stock cars,
compacts and foreign, cars, humorous
entries, and an all-women category.
Prizes will be awarded to the top con
tenders in each group.
First Time Trials
Activity begins at 7 A.M. tomorrow
morning with practice runs over
course. First time trials begin at 10.
Each car will be running against
the clock on a time-eliminator basis.
Finalists will be chosen from the
morning runs to compete after the
Army game.
Headquarters for the event will be
the Alpha Sigma Phi house.
The highlight of the day will be a
run-off between the winner of the
women's category against the other
group winners. Four womens living
groups have entered a ear promising
to make the "Powder-Puff" division
quite a spectacle.


A loop! A whirl! A verticle climb! And once again you know it's time
for . . . Lagunita Seca! The fun-packed two-day activities include a race
between entries from women's residences. The above shining examples of
engineering mastery are only part of the spectacular field. Preparing to
start a race to the ice cream is Doug McConnell of the Alpha Sigma Phi
house which is co-s|>onsoring with Delta Kappa Kpsilon fraternity.
