# LIVING, LEARNING
## New Programs For Freshmen 
### BARBARA LEVIN 
Residing in Wilbur, Branner, Roble,
and Stern this year along with the
Class of 1969 is a complete schedule
of new programs which have been
built on the foundation of the tradi
tional House Plan. Stanford has con
tinuously integrated a dormitory pro
gram into its university atmosphere.
The beneficial combination of living
and learning is the stated purpose be
hind the policy.
In the past years a gulf has grown
between the ideal and the application
of the principle. The newly-formed
Residential Education Division of the
Dean of Students Office has consid
ered this separation and has activated
specific ideas to rebuild the House
Plan.
Sponsors' Duties
The duties of sponsors are not spe

cifically defined. In the past they have
served as sources of information and
encouragement. Sosha Harmon views
her job as a Branner sponsor as
". . . being a catalyst which directly
affects the reaction of the freshmen
to Stanford . . In addition, this
year's sponsors are responsible for a
complete scope of extracurricular
projects.
The Exposition in Communication
organized by Steve Hurlbut of Wilbur
for winter quarter is one of the most
unusual. With the help of Dr. Helen
Sehrader of the Speech Department,
five pairs of sponsors are being
trained lo start non-directed discus
sions for freshmen like the ones held
in Speech 120. These experiments in
group dynamics and self-analysis
meet with no specific topic and sim
ply converse. Eric Vittinghoff of Ar

royo House has also arranged three
seminars of this nature.
Actors Participate, Too
Starting next week in the freshmen
halls is a new type of exchange, one
with the Actors' Workshop in Sun
Francisco. Members of the company
will (tine at Wilbur, Branner, and
RobJe next Tuesday, and will present
discussion of repertory theater and
cuttings from their first play of the
season, "Edward II." Later small
groups of freshmen will travel to the
theater to enjoy the plays and to par
ticipate in after-play critiques with
the cast.
The Art Co-op in Branner, a ven
ture into the field of expressive art,
is being organized by Dave Harris, a
Wilbur sponsor. A small fee for mem
bership will pay for materials. Beyond
this, the workshop will include lim

ited direction and the opportunity to
dabble in various media.
P.K. Seminars
A different side of these activities
is presented in the Otero Pilot Plan.
A physical education seminar led by
Joe Higgins and John Gilmore, ap
proaches exercise in an intellectual
manner. The plan co-ordinates with
the intramural program and the new
special interest physical education
groups.
Other organized and spontaneous
programs include Wilbur's Guest-in-
Residence series which this week is
presenting Dr. David Hubbard on
religion and morality. A tentative
Branner Concert Series will display
Stanford's amateur talent in concert
during winter and spring quarters.
Friday night firesides at the girls'
dorms, an Arroyo House big-brother
plan with the San Jose jail, al'ter
sympbonv bus discussions, extension
of Western Civic to the corridor, lan
guage dining tables, and a mass week
ly freshmen, eating exchange are all
factors in the revitalized House Plan.
A 1 Taylor, head Wilbur sponsor,
summarizes the whole scene as lie
speaks specifically about Wilbur.
"The programs are as varied as the
eight houses and come from the in
terests of the guys."
Surprising Outgrowths
Learning to choose and to clarify
interests are surprising outgrowths
which Mr. Joe Higgins, program di
rector of Wilbur, has noticed. Miss
Sally Mahoney. director of Roble,
feels her job is to co-ordinate these
activities and to insure diversity so
all interest can be met.
The realm of this diversity is en
larged by the student associate plan.
These upperclassmcn connect the
freshmen to the student body in gen
eral. Their discussion creates a broad
er view of campus activities and atti
tudes. The program is new in Bran net*
and Roble this year.
Facility Masters
One final step toward the removal
of anti-intellectual barriers in the
freshmen dorms is the faculty-master
program in Wilbur. Dr. Eric Hutch
inson, the first faculty-master, be
lieves that the program brings about
a sense of continuity between class
and dorm life. Encouragement of
more informal relationships between
faculty and students is offered
through the faculty associate system.
Dean Dan Novvack, Associate Dean of
Students for Residential Education,
said the idea of faculty participation
in the dorms is relatively new in
America. One product of the philos
ophy is the educational complex
where professors and students Jive
and study in the same building*.

all interest can be met.
The realm of this diversity is en
larged by the student associate plan.
These upperclassmcn connect the
freshmen to the student body in gen
eral. Their discussion creates a broad
er view of campus activities and atti
tudes. The program is new in Bran net*
and Roble this year.
Facility Masters
One final step toward the removal
of anti-intellectual barriers in the
freshmen dorms is the faculty-master
program in Wilbur. Dr. Eric Hutch
inson, the first faculty-master, be
lieves that the program brings about
a sense of continuity between class
and dorm life. Encouragement of
more informal relationships between
faculty and students is offered
through the faculty associate system.
Dean Dan Novvack, Associate Dean of
Students for Residential Education,
said the idea of faculty participation
in the dorms is relatively new in
America. One product of the philos
ophy is the educational complex
where professors and students Jive
and study in the same building*.
Residing in Wilbur, Branner, Roble,
and Stern this year along with the
Class of 1969 is a complete schedule
of new programs which have been
built on the foundation of the tradi
tional House Plan. Stanford has con
tinuously integrated a dormitory pro
gram into its university atmosphere.
The beneficial combination of living
and learning is the stated purpose be
hind the policy.
In the past years a gulf has grown
between the ideal and the application
of the principle. The newly-formed
Residential Education Division of the
Dean of Students Office has consid
ered this separation and has activated
specific ideas to rebuild the House
Plan.
Sponsors' Duties
The duties of sponsors are not spe

cifically defined. In the past they have
served as sources of information and
encouragement. Sosha Harmon views
her job as a Branner sponsor as
". . . being a catalyst which directly
affects the reaction of the freshmen
to Stanford . . In addition, this
year's sponsors are responsible for a
complete scope of extracurricular
projects.
The Exposition in Communication
organized by Steve Hurlbut of Wilbur
for winter quarter is one of the most
unusual. With the help of Dr. Helen
Sehrader of the Speech Department,
five pairs of sponsors are being
trained lo start non-directed discus
sions for freshmen like the ones held
in Speech 120. These experiments in
group dynamics and self-analysis
meet with no specific topic and sim
ply converse. Eric Vittinghoff of Ar

royo House has also arranged three
seminars of this nature.
Actors Participate, Too
Starting next week in the freshmen
halls is a new type of exchange, one
with the Actors' Workshop in Sun
Francisco. Members of the company
will (tine at Wilbur, Branner, and
RobJe next Tuesday, and will present
discussion of repertory theater and
cuttings from their first play of the
season, "Edward II." Later small
groups of freshmen will travel to the
theater to enjoy the plays and to par
ticipate in after-play critiques with
the cast.
The Art Co-op in Branner, a ven
ture into the field of expressive art,
is being organized by Dave Harris, a
Wilbur sponsor. A small fee for mem
bership will pay for materials. Beyond
this, the workshop will include lim

ited direction and the opportunity to
dabble in various media.
P.K. Seminars
A different side of these activities
is presented in the Otero Pilot Plan.
A physical education seminar led by
Joe Higgins and John Gilmore, ap
proaches exercise in an intellectual
manner. The plan co-ordinates with
the intramural program and the new
special interest physical education
groups.
Other organized and spontaneous
programs include Wilbur's Guest-in-
Residence series which this week is
presenting Dr. David Hubbard on
religion and morality. A tentative
Branner Concert Series will display
Stanford's amateur talent in concert
during winter and spring quarters.
Friday night firesides at the girls'
dorms, an Arroyo House big-brother
plan with the San Jose jail, al'ter
sympbonv bus discussions, extension
of Western Civic to the corridor, lan
guage dining tables, and a mass week
ly freshmen, eating exchange are all
factors in the revitalized House Plan.
A 1 Taylor, head Wilbur sponsor,
summarizes the whole scene as lie
speaks specifically about Wilbur.
"The programs are as varied as the
eight houses and come from the in
terests of the guys."
Surprising Outgrowths
Learning to choose and to clarify
interests are surprising outgrowths
which Mr. Joe Higgins, program di
rector of Wilbur, has noticed. Miss
Sally Mahoney. director of Roble,
feels her job is to co-ordinate these
activities and to insure diversity so

Residence series which this week is
presenting Dr. David Hubbard on
religion and morality. A tentative
Branner Concert Series will display
Stanford's amateur talent in concert
during winter and spring quarters.
Friday night firesides at the girls'
dorms, an Arroyo House big-brother
plan with the San Jose jail, al'ter
sympbonv bus discussions, extension
of Western Civic to the corridor, lan
guage dining tables, and a mass week
ly freshmen, eating exchange are all
factors in the revitalized House Plan.
A 1 Taylor, head Wilbur sponsor,
summarizes the whole scene as lie
speaks specifically about Wilbur.
"The programs are as varied as the
eight houses and come from the in
terests of the guys."
Surprising Outgrowths
Learning to choose and to clarify
interests are surprising outgrowths
which Mr. Joe Higgins, program di
rector of Wilbur, has noticed. Miss
Sally Mahoney. director of Roble,
feels her job is to co-ordinate these
activities and to insure diversity so
all interest can be met.
The realm of this diversity is en
larged by the student associate plan.
These upperclassmcn connect the
freshmen to the student body in gen
eral. Their discussion creates a broad
er view of campus activities and atti
tudes. The program is new in Bran net*
and Roble this year.
Facility Masters
One final step toward the removal
of anti-intellectual barriers in the
freshmen dorms is the faculty-master
program in Wilbur. Dr. Eric Hutch
inson, the first faculty-master, be
lieves that the program brings about
a sense of continuity between class
and dorm life. Encouragement of
more informal relationships between
faculty and students is offered
through the faculty associate system.
Dean Dan Novvack, Associate Dean of
Students for Residential Education,
said the idea of faculty participation
in the dorms is relatively new in
America. One product of the philos
ophy is the educational complex
where professors and students Jive
and study in the same building*.
Residing in Wilbur, Branner, Roble,
and Stern this year along with the
Class of 1969 is a complete schedule
of new programs which have been
built on the foundation of the tradi
tional House Plan. Stanford has con
tinuously integrated a dormitory pro
gram into its university atmosphere.
The beneficial combination of living
and learning is the stated purpose be
hind the policy.
In the past years a gulf has grown
between the ideal and the application
of the principle. The newly-formed
Residential Education Division of the
Dean of Students Office has consid
ered this separation and has activated
specific ideas to rebuild the House
Plan.
Sponsors' Duties
The duties of sponsors are not spe

cifically defined. In the past they have
served as sources of information and
encouragement. Sosha Harmon views
her job as a Branner sponsor as
". . . being a catalyst which directly
affects the reaction of the freshmen
to Stanford . . In addition, this
year's sponsors are responsible for a
complete scope of extracurricular
projects.
The Exposition in Communication
organized by Steve Hurlbut of Wilbur
for winter quarter is one of the most
unusual. With the help of Dr. Helen
Sehrader of the Speech Department,
five pairs of sponsors are being
trained lo start non-directed discus
sions for freshmen like the ones held
in Speech 120. These experiments in
group dynamics and self-analysis
meet with no specific topic and sim
ply converse. Eric Vittinghoff of Ar

royo House has also arranged three
seminars of this nature.
Actors Participate, Too
Starting next week in the freshmen
halls is a new type of exchange, one
with the Actors' Workshop in Sun
Francisco. Members of the company
will (tine at Wilbur, Branner, and
RobJe next Tuesday, and will present
discussion of repertory theater and
cuttings from their first play of the
season, "Edward II." Later small
groups of freshmen will travel to the
theater to enjoy the plays and to par
ticipate in after-play critiques with
the cast.
The Art Co-op in Branner, a ven
ture into the field of expressive art,
is being organized by Dave Harris, a
Wilbur sponsor. A small fee for mem
bership will pay for materials. Beyond
this, the workshop will include lim

ited direction and the opportunity to
dabble in various media.
P.K. Seminars
A different side of these activities
is presented in the Otero Pilot Plan.
A physical education seminar led by
Joe Higgins and John Gilmore, ap
proaches exercise in an intellectual
manner. The plan co-ordinates with
the intramural program and the new
special interest physical education
groups.
