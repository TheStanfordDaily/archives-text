## 
### 
Sputnik did for America what Dim
kirk did for Britain, The Right Hon.
Ernest Marples declared at Stanford
yesterday.
A Conservative Member of Parlia
ment and "shadow" minister of tech
nology. Marples smilingly suggested
thai the U.S. "ought to have a statue
of sputnik next to the Statue of
Liberty.''
Russia's launching of the first space
vehicle shattered America's postwar
complacency, creating a united na
tional effort in science and technol
ogy. "From that moment on. you've
never really looked back," he said in
a campus interview.
Now concluding a six week tour of
U.S. industry, government and educa
tion centers. Marples said America's
"fantastic" strides in technology have
resulted from"the fear of sputnik,
ihe hope of a new society, and the ab
sence of major war."
Cabinet Vet
A former businessman and l.'j-year
veteran in the British Cabinet, Mar
ples was extremely impressed by the
way "the U.S. government is tackling
its problems in a much more business
like way," starting at the Pentagon
and spreading elsewhere.
Marples said a new spirit of "deter
ruination and real enthusiasm" per
vades Washington."The government's
brought in a lot of outside people,
given them lots of power, and tried
to apply business principles to govern
ment operations. Now government

practices are being adopted by busi
ness."
Britain, he said, needs to apply eosi
controls, value engineering, and other
U.S. methods "in a much more sweep
ing way" within government.
Free Circulation
We've got to get the products of
science freely circulated in industry"
and "give scientists approximately the
same rewards you do" to stimulate
technological advances and stop the
brain drain, he added,
Britain cannot hope to match the

U.S. across Ihe board in science, but
can merge its efforts with those of
Europe, picking certain narrow fields
for concerted work.
"We have to export more per per
son than any other mil ion in the
world," .he commented. "To do that,
we have to rely on brainpower and
technology. We have no raw materials
except coal and who wants coal?"
In the past. British professors
haven't "soiled their hands in sordid
industry.'' hut in the future this will
change, he predicted.

Sputnik did for America what Dim
kirk did for Britain, The Right Hon.
Ernest Marples declared at Stanford
yesterday.
A Conservative Member of Parlia
ment and "shadow" minister of tech

ihe hope of a new society, and the ab
sence of major war."
