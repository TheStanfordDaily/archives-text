Sorry, No Admittance?
It is only a legend which sciys that St. Peter is the gatekeeper of heaven.
Yet the persistent jokes that Peter admits some and reiects others are based
on the facts of life that some are excluded from the City of Life.
' Do you not know that the unrighteous will not enter the kingdom of
heaven? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolalers, nor adulterers,
nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
robbers will inherit the kingdom of God" (I Corinthinians 6:9-10).
Now heaven is not just a reward for good behavior or pie in the sky when
I die, but life iri another dimension which is to be entered into here and now
through faith in Jesus Christ. The eventual death of the body and immediate
step upwards into glory are only passing events of a heavenly life begun
here on earth.
My self-righteous attempts at good clean living do not satisfy the holy God
who looks at the motives of every human heart: I must first recognize that I
am admitted into heaven solely on the merits of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ
Himself said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those
who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners (Mark 2:17).
The Bible is all Good News because it is addiessed to sinners, and all of
us are born into this world in that very condition. But the God who loved us
enough to die for us wants us as we are and admits freely into His eternal
Kingdom all who come to Jesus Christ in faith. This is Good News indeed, the
ticket you need to heaven has been supplied by God:
' But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the
law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, the righteousness
of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinc
tion; since all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, they are
justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
whom God put forth as an expiation by His blood to be received by faith. This
was to show God's righteousness because in His divine forebearance He had
passed over former sins; it was to prove at the present time that He Himself
is righteous and that He justifies Him who has faith in Jesus Christ (Romans
3:21 26).
Faith in Jesus Christ is not tot the buds, but lor sinners like you and I.
Heaven is neither myth nor fiction, but a real mode of life you can begin to
experience now if you II simply take the free gift which God offers without
charge. Why not pick up your free ticket to glory today?
