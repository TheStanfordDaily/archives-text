# God, Man, The Cosmos-And Jane's Grant

### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor (First in a series 
"The University must be forever maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis . . . the moral and religious development
of the University will be better accomplished
if entirely free from all denominational alli
ances, however slight the bond may be."
These words of Jane Stanford are part of the
Founding Grant of the University and have
served since 1902 as Stanford's definition of
religious policy, a policy in which the only
worship allowed on campus is the "non
denominational" service in Memorial Church
and one Which prohibited, until three years
ago, meetings of denominational groups on
campus.
Progress Marked
Progress, however, has been marked in re
cent years. The denominational ministers, with
headquarters in Palo Alto, have slowly worked
their way on campus and are now united with
the chaplain's office in what Chaplain Robert
M. Minto calls "a common ministry to the
campus."
In addition, the winds of freedom seem to be
blowing favorably for high-level consideration
of re-interpretating the Grant to allow free
dom of worship on campus.
The Stanfords wore, as many observers have
noted, "extremely religious people," although
they professed no specific denominational af
filiation. Thus the establishment of the Univer
sity as non-denominational at a time when al
most all other private universities had religious
ties was somewhat unique. The spirit of the
founders was olio of toleration and revolution
with the intent el' fostering cooperation and
the prevention of the University's becoming
an "instrument" of any religious group.

But is a ministry directed toward Protes
tants in spirit with the times—when Catholi
cism, Judaism, ami "secularism" offer alter
natives to Protestantism—and in spirit with
the founders' intentions?
These questions and other related ones have
been the springboard for almost annual inves
tigations and re-evaluations of the religious
situation at Stanford.
The provisions of the Founding Grant on
religion had become so "restrictive" by 1946
that visiting chaplain Merrimon Cuninggim
was moved to report "Stanford has the weak
est program of any reputable university in
America."
Religious Coordinator
He urged the expansion of the Memorial
Church staff to include a "coordinator of re
ligious programs" and several assistants for
both the chaplain and the coordinator; the
establishment of a curriculum in religious
studies; the encouragement of student initia
tive in developing voluntary programs.
"The fundamental need of Stanford in the
area of religion," he concluded, "is a reconsti
tuted and revitalized philosophy of higher edu
cation which not only allows, but demands,
that religion play a large and integral part in
the University's life."
Apparently in response to the Cuninggim
report, President Donald B. Tresidder organ
ized the next year a student-faculty group to
re-evaluate the religious program on campus.
Mark Hatfield, now the governor of Oregon,
followed with a student-led group the next
year. And so it went, year after year.
What has been the result of these frequent
surveys?
In 1950, the University established a Curric
ulum iti Religious Studies, under the guidance
of Alexander Miller. The program flourished

and was only temporarily slowed dowti by
Miller's death in 1960. As his replacement, the
University appointed in 1962 Robert McAfee
Brown, one of the nation's distinguished theo
logians. Dr. Brown has further expanded the
program to include a regular Catholic member
on the staff Mioliael Novak, appointed this
fall—and hopes soon to hire a Jewish scholar
and eventually expand into comparative
religions.
Denominational (.roups
The position of denominational groups on
campus has also improved markedly in recent
years. As a result of a Trustee decision in the
spring of 1963, all religious groups may hold
meetings on campus.
The breadth of this decision was challenged
the following fall by Hillel Director Harry
May who petitioned the University to use
classroom space for the teaching of Hebrew
and related subjects. He was denied permis
sion with the explanation that "formal courses
cannot be given on campus except by persons
holding academic appointments."
During that quarter, a group of students
from The Daily and the Legislature began
another investigation of religion. They pub
lished their conclusions in January in a series
of articles in The Daily and a report to
LASSU.
The report summarized the committee's find
ings: "It is apparent that religion at Stanford
is not now meeting student needs. Both the
opportunity and necessity for changes and in
creases in the entire religious program are
very much in order."
That religious worship for all denominations
l)e allowed on campus was the prime recom
mendation of the committee.
The committee also urged the University to
continue "its excellent work in the creation of

the Religious Studies program and in the ef
forts to expand it,"and suggested that income
from a $1.5 million donation given the Univer
sity the previous spring "be used to expand
the staff and programs of Memorial Church
and make them more relevant to the specific
needs of the students."
'Activities Inadequate'
A committee questionnaire showed a "wide
spread feeling that the religious activities and
policies of the University were inadequate and
unsuited to the present circumstances."
The Daily articles dealt with legal aspects
of the religious situation, responses of other
colleges to similar situations, and opinions of
various personnel at Stanford.
University lawyer Cassius Kirk expressed
the opinion that historical precedents exist
both for holding sectarian worship on campus
and for re-interpretation of the Founding
Grant.
"The fact that earlier administrations [those
during the life of Jane Stanford] have permit
ted sectarian services is at least evidence that
they did not consider such services in conflict
with the prohibitions of tin? Founding Grant."
Services Sectarian
Agreeing with the statements of Prof.
Brown and other theologians that the services
in Memorial Church are of the one sect
Protestantism Kirk stated that "the intent of
Mrs. Stanford, as expressed in the Founding
Grant, might be better served by permitting
other sects to conduct worship services on the
campus."
The Daily further reported that "many
denomination-endowed and non-sectarian col
leges have solved the 'bar-all, bar-none' prob
lem by allowing all religious groups to he
active on campus. The programs at Cornell,
Brandeis, Columbia, and Colgate were ex

plored.
Prof. Brown told The Daily: "Ways must be
found to permit groups to engage in corporate
worship on campus. We should not have aca
demic freedom at the University for the dis
cussion and investigation of all areas except
religion. Students should have the right to be
exposed to all creeds, and while such opportu
nity is provided in academic courses, students
should be able to explore these areas on their
own in other than a classroom situation."
"We should avoid sectarianism." he sug
gested, "by allowing all groups the opportu
nity for expression."
Minto Disagrees
Minto stated his opposition to the sugges
tions of allowing all groups on-campus wor
ship. "I'm not in favor of the change advocated
by some," he said "I don't see a need for it.
The major problem is that most students don't
care for religion.
Minto pointed out that, under the stipula
tions of the Founding Grant, "the only respon
sibility the University has as far as religious
exercises go," is a Protestant, non-denomina
tional Memorial Church.
He added: "The University's hands were tied
by the Grant. The opportunity for worship is
not a prime problem here ... I don't know
what canges may come, but 1 won't come our
in demand for private places on campus."
At the time of the Daily-LASSU report, u
group of students who had attended an Ecu
menical Conference in Ohio during Christmas
break approached Minto, saying that the <*oji
ference had crystalized their ideas of what
should be done at Stanford and that they Jolt
obligated to express their commitment in more
responsible and meaningful ways than they
had in the past.
• Memorial Church does not
reflect an active Christian atti
tude of leadership toward the
whole community.
• The role of Memorial Church
in campus life should l>e more

than .just the conducting of wor
ship services. The Cliurch has
not been involved in the commu
nity. There is a need for the
development of a social aware
ness, concern, and involvement
with the life of the community.
• More guest preachers-in
residence would help to develop
this social awareness, as would
community services projects.
• A Christian commitment
means the willingness to be con
troversial and to question the
status quo. The prime example
is Christ.
Minto's Response
Minto responded by saying
that he felt there was general
agreement and that renewal was
needed. He expressed a desire to
work for change when he deter
mined what the community
wanted and needed. He said he
was pleased that the questions
were raised in an open atmo
sphere.
Minto subsequently created
the Stanford Christian Council,
calling for unity among stu
dents. faculty, and denomina
tional ministers, so that "we
may combine on the things that
we now need to do together."
Later that year President
Sterling created his Advisory
Committee on Religious Affairs,
the impetus for its formation
coming fi-om the $1.5 million gift
of Lowell Berry, which now
earns about $50,000 a year in
come.
The committee, according to
its chairman Richard Lyman
(Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences) is charged with
the exploration of "what we
aren't doing that we,could be
doing to provide richer religious
life on campus; what is the
place and purpose of religious
activities on campus."
The committee worked all last
year but its conclusions and rec
ommendations have not yet been
made public.
Progress in the religious pro
gram continued last year with
the extension of weekly meet
ings of the chaplain and the
denominational ministers and
with a liturgy-demonstration
program during which Catholic
chaplain Fa 1 her John Duryea
celebrated mass in Memorial
Church.
(Tomorrow: Chaplain Minto
discusses the implications of the
changed structure of religious
effort on campus.)

founders was olio of toleration and revolution
with the intent el' fostering cooperation and
the prevention of the University's becoming
an "instrument" of any religious group.

But is a ministry directed toward Protes
tants in spirit with the times—when Catholi
cism, Judaism, ami "secularism" offer alter
natives to Protestantism—and in spirit with
the founders' intentions?
These questions and other related ones have
been the springboard for almost annual inves
tigations and re-evaluations of the religious
situation at Stanford.
The provisions of the Founding Grant on
religion had become so "restrictive" by 1946
that visiting chaplain Merrimon Cuninggim
was moved to report "Stanford has the weak
est program of any reputable university in
America."
Religious Coordinator
He urged the expansion of the Memorial
Church staff to include a "coordinator of re
ligious programs" and several assistants for
both the chaplain and the coordinator; the
establishment of a curriculum in religious
studies; the encouragement of student initia
tive in developing voluntary programs.
"The fundamental need of Stanford in the
area of religion," he concluded, "is a reconsti
tuted and revitalized philosophy of higher edu
cation which not only allows, but demands,
that religion play a large and integral part in
the University's life."
Apparently in response to the Cuninggim
report, President Donald B. Tresidder organ
ized the next year a student-faculty group to
re-evaluate the religious program on campus.
Mark Hatfield, now the governor of Oregon,
followed with a student-led group the next
year. And so it went, year after year.
What has been the result of these frequent
surveys?
In 1950, the University established a Curric
ulum iti Religious Studies, under the guidance
of Alexander Miller. The program flourished

and was only temporarily slowed dowti by
Miller's death in 1960. As his replacement, the
University appointed in 1962 Robert McAfee
Brown, one of the nation's distinguished theo
logians. Dr. Brown has further expanded the
program to include a regular Catholic member
on the staff Mioliael Novak, appointed this
fall—and hopes soon to hire a Jewish scholar
and eventually expand into comparative
religions.
Denominational (.roups
The position of denominational groups on
campus has also improved markedly in recent
years. As a result of a Trustee decision in the
spring of 1963, all religious groups may hold
meetings on campus.
The breadth of this decision was challenged
the following fall by Hillel Director Harry
May who petitioned the University to use
classroom space for the teaching of Hebrew
and related subjects. He was denied permis
sion with the explanation that "formal courses
cannot be given on campus except by persons
holding academic appointments."
During that quarter, a group of students
from The Daily and the Legislature began
another investigation of religion. They pub
lished their conclusions in January in a series
of articles in The Daily and a report to
LASSU.
The report summarized the committee's find
ings: "It is apparent that religion at Stanford
is not now meeting student needs. Both the
opportunity and necessity for changes and in
creases in the entire religious program are
very much in order."
That religious worship for all denominations
l)e allowed on campus was the prime recom
mendation of the committee.
The committee also urged the University to
continue "its excellent work in the creation of

the Religious Studies program and in the ef
forts to expand it,"and suggested that income
from a $1.5 million donation given the Univer
sity the previous spring "be used to expand
the staff and programs of Memorial Church
and make them more relevant to the specific
needs of the students."
'Activities Inadequate'
A committee questionnaire showed a "wide
spread feeling that the religious activities and
policies of the University were inadequate and
unsuited to the present circumstances."
The Daily articles dealt with legal aspects
of the religious situation, responses of other
colleges to similar situations, and opinions of
various personnel at Stanford.
University lawyer Cassius Kirk expressed
the opinion that historical precedents exist
both for holding sectarian worship on campus
and for re-interpretation of the Founding
Grant.
"The fact that earlier administrations [those
during the life of Jane Stanford] have permit
ted sectarian services is at least evidence that
they did not consider such services in conflict
with the prohibitions of tin? Founding Grant."
Services Sectarian
Agreeing with the statements of Prof.
Brown and other theologians that the services
in Memorial Church are of the one sect
Protestantism Kirk stated that "the intent of
Mrs. Stanford, as expressed in the Founding
Grant, might be better served by permitting
other sects to conduct worship services on the
campus."
The Daily further reported that "many
denomination-endowed and non-sectarian col
leges have solved the 'bar-all, bar-none' prob
lem by allowing all religious groups to he
active on campus. The programs at Cornell,
Brandeis, Columbia, and Colgate were ex

plored.
Prof. Brown told The Daily: "Ways must be
found to permit groups to engage in corporate
worship on campus. We should not have aca
demic freedom at the University for the dis
cussion and investigation of all areas except
religion. Students should have the right to be
exposed to all creeds, and while such opportu
nity is provided in academic courses, students
should be able to explore these areas on their
own in other than a classroom situation."
"We should avoid sectarianism." he sug
gested, "by allowing all groups the opportu
nity for expression."
Minto Disagrees
Minto stated his opposition to the sugges
tions of allowing all groups on-campus wor
ship. "I'm not in favor of the change advocated
by some," he said "I don't see a need for it.
The major problem is that most students don't
care for religion.
Minto pointed out that, under the stipula
tions of the Founding Grant, "the only respon
sibility the University has as far as religious
exercises go," is a Protestant, non-denomina
tional Memorial Church.
He added: "The University's hands were tied
by the Grant. The opportunity for worship is
not a prime problem here ... I don't know
what canges may come, but 1 won't come our
in demand for private places on campus."
At the time of the Daily-LASSU report, u
group of students who had attended an Ecu
menical Conference in Ohio during Christmas
break approached Minto, saying that the <*oji
ference had crystalized their ideas of what
should be done at Stanford and that they Jolt
obligated to express their commitment in more
responsible and meaningful ways than they
had in the past.
• Memorial Church does not
reflect an active Christian atti
tude of leadership toward the
whole community.
• The role of Memorial Church
in campus life should l>e more

than .just the conducting of wor
ship services. The Cliurch has
not been involved in the commu
nity. There is a need for the
development of a social aware
ness, concern, and involvement
with the life of the community.
• More guest preachers-in
residence would help to develop
this social awareness, as would
community services projects.
• A Christian commitment
means the willingness to be con
troversial and to question the
status quo. The prime example
is Christ.
Minto's Response
Minto responded by saying
that he felt there was general
agreement and that renewal was
needed. He expressed a desire to
work for change when he deter
mined what the community
wanted and needed. He said he
was pleased that the questions
were raised in an open atmo
sphere.
Minto subsequently created
the Stanford Christian Council,
calling for unity among stu
dents. faculty, and denomina
tional ministers, so that "we
may combine on the things that
we now need to do together."
Later that year President
Sterling created his Advisory
Committee on Religious Affairs,
the impetus for its formation
coming fi-om the $1.5 million gift
of Lowell Berry, which now
earns about $50,000 a year in
come.
The committee, according to
its chairman Richard Lyman
(Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences) is charged with
the exploration of "what we
aren't doing that we,could be
doing to provide richer religious
life on campus; what is the
place and purpose of religious
activities on campus."
The committee worked all last
year but its conclusions and rec
ommendations have not yet been
made public.
Progress in the religious pro
gram continued last year with
the extension of weekly meet
ings of the chaplain and the
denominational ministers and
with a liturgy-demonstration
program during which Catholic
chaplain Fa 1 her John Duryea
celebrated mass in Memorial
Church.
(Tomorrow: Chaplain Minto
discusses the implications of the
changed structure of religious
effort on campus.)
"The University must be forever maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis . . . the moral and religious development
of the University will be better accomplished
if entirely free from all denominational alli
ances, however slight the bond may be."
These words of Jane Stanford are part of the
Founding Grant of the University and have
served since 1902 as Stanford's definition of
religious policy, a policy in which the only
worship allowed on campus is the "non
denominational" service in Memorial Church
and one Which prohibited, until three years
ago, meetings of denominational groups on
campus.
Progress Marked
Progress, however, has been marked in re
cent years. The denominational ministers, with
headquarters in Palo Alto, have slowly worked
their way on campus and are now united with
the chaplain's office in what Chaplain Robert
M. Minto calls "a common ministry to the
campus."
In addition, the winds of freedom seem to be
blowing favorably for high-level consideration
of re-interpretating the Grant to allow free
dom of worship on campus.
The Stanfords wore, as many observers have
noted, "extremely religious people," although
they professed no specific denominational af
filiation. Thus the establishment of the Univer
sity as non-denominational at a time when al
most all other private universities had religious
ties was somewhat unique. The spirit of the
founders was olio of toleration and revolution
with the intent el' fostering cooperation and
the prevention of the University's becoming

re-evaluate the religious program on campus.
Mark Hatfield, now the governor of Oregon,
followed with a student-led group the next
year. And so it went, year after year.
What has been the result of these frequent
surveys?
In 1950, the University established a Curric
ulum iti Religious Studies, under the guidance
of Alexander Miller. The program flourished

and was only temporarily slowed dowti by
Miller's death in 1960. As his replacement, the
University appointed in 1962 Robert McAfee
Brown, one of the nation's distinguished theo
logians. Dr. Brown has further expanded the
program to include a regular Catholic member
on the staff Mioliael Novak, appointed this
fall—and hopes soon to hire a Jewish scholar
and eventually expand into comparative
religions.
Denominational (.roups
The position of denominational groups on
campus has also improved markedly in recent
years. As a result of a Trustee decision in the
spring of 1963, all religious groups may hold
meetings on campus.
The breadth of this decision was challenged
the following fall by Hillel Director Harry
May who petitioned the University to use
classroom space for the teaching of Hebrew
and related subjects. He was denied permis
sion with the explanation that "formal courses
cannot be given on campus except by persons
holding academic appointments."
During that quarter, a group of students
from The Daily and the Legislature began
another investigation of religion. They pub
lished their conclusions in January in a series
of articles in The Daily and a report to
LASSU.
The report summarized the committee's find
ings: "It is apparent that religion at Stanford
is not now meeting student needs. Both the
opportunity and necessity for changes and in
creases in the entire religious program are
very much in order."
That religious worship for all denominations
l)e allowed on campus was the prime recom
mendation of the committee.
The committee also urged the University to
continue "its excellent work in the creation of

the Religious Studies program and in the ef
forts to expand it,"and suggested that income
from a $1.5 million donation given the Univer
sity the previous spring "be used to expand
the staff and programs of Memorial Church
and make them more relevant to the specific
needs of the students."
'Activities Inadequate'
A committee questionnaire showed a "wide
spread feeling that the religious activities and
policies of the University were inadequate and
unsuited to the present circumstances."
The Daily articles dealt with legal aspects
of the religious situation, responses of other
colleges to similar situations, and opinions of
various personnel at Stanford.
University lawyer Cassius Kirk expressed
the opinion that historical precedents exist
both for holding sectarian worship on campus
and for re-interpretation of the Founding
Grant.
"The fact that earlier administrations [those
during the life of Jane Stanford] have permit
ted sectarian services is at least evidence that
they did not consider such services in conflict
with the prohibitions of tin? Founding Grant."
Services Sectarian
Agreeing with the statements of Prof.
Brown and other theologians that the services
in Memorial Church are of the one sect
Protestantism Kirk stated that "the intent of
Mrs. Stanford, as expressed in the Founding
Grant, might be better served by permitting
other sects to conduct worship services on the
campus."
The Daily further reported that "many
denomination-endowed and non-sectarian col
leges have solved the 'bar-all, bar-none' prob
lem by allowing all religious groups to he
active on campus. The programs at Cornell,
Brandeis, Columbia, and Colgate were ex

plored.
Prof. Brown told The Daily: "Ways must be
found to permit groups to engage in corporate
worship on campus. We should not have aca
demic freedom at the University for the dis
cussion and investigation of all areas except
religion. Students should have the right to be
exposed to all creeds, and while such opportu
nity is provided in academic courses, students
should be able to explore these areas on their
own in other than a classroom situation."
"We should avoid sectarianism." he sug
gested, "by allowing all groups the opportu
nity for expression."
Minto Disagrees
Minto stated his opposition to the sugges
tions of allowing all groups on-campus wor
ship. "I'm not in favor of the change advocated
by some," he said "I don't see a need for it.
The major problem is that most students don't
care for religion.
Minto pointed out that, under the stipula
tions of the Founding Grant, "the only respon
sibility the University has as far as religious
exercises go," is a Protestant, non-denomina
tional Memorial Church.
He added: "The University's hands were tied
by the Grant. The opportunity for worship is
not a prime problem here ... I don't know
what canges may come, but 1 won't come our
in demand for private places on campus."
At the time of the Daily-LASSU report, u
group of students who had attended an Ecu
menical Conference in Ohio during Christmas
break approached Minto, saying that the <*oji
ference had crystalized their ideas of what
should be done at Stanford and that they Jolt
obligated to express their commitment in more
responsible and meaningful ways than they
had in the past.
• Memorial Church does not
reflect an active Christian atti
tude of leadership toward the
whole community.
• The role of Memorial Church
in campus life should l>e more

than .just the conducting of wor
ship services. The Cliurch has
not been involved in the commu
nity. There is a need for the
development of a social aware
ness, concern, and involvement
with the life of the community.
• More guest preachers-in
residence would help to develop
this social awareness, as would
community services projects.
• A Christian commitment
means the willingness to be con
troversial and to question the
status quo. The prime example
is Christ.
Minto's Response
Minto responded by saying
that he felt there was general
agreement and that renewal was
needed. He expressed a desire to
work for change when he deter
mined what the community
wanted and needed. He said he
was pleased that the questions
were raised in an open atmo
sphere.
Minto subsequently created
the Stanford Christian Council,
calling for unity among stu
dents. faculty, and denomina
tional ministers, so that "we
may combine on the things that
we now need to do together."
Later that year President
Sterling created his Advisory
Committee on Religious Affairs,
the impetus for its formation
coming fi-om the $1.5 million gift
of Lowell Berry, which now
earns about $50,000 a year in
come.
The committee, according to
its chairman Richard Lyman
(Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences) is charged with
the exploration of "what we
aren't doing that we,could be
doing to provide richer religious
life on campus; what is the
place and purpose of religious
activities on campus."
The committee worked all last
year but its conclusions and rec
ommendations have not yet been
made public.
Progress in the religious pro
gram continued last year with
the extension of weekly meet
ings of the chaplain and the
denominational ministers and
with a liturgy-demonstration
program during which Catholic
chaplain Fa 1 her John Duryea
celebrated mass in Memorial
Church.
(Tomorrow: Chaplain Minto
discusses the implications of the
changed structure of religious
effort on campus.)
"The University must be forever maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis . . . the moral and religious development
of the University will be better accomplished
if entirely free from all denominational alli
ances, however slight the bond may be."
These words of Jane Stanford are part of the
Founding Grant of the University and have
served since 1902 as Stanford's definition of
religious policy, a policy in which the only
worship allowed on campus is the "non
denominational" service in Memorial Church
and one Which prohibited, until three years
ago, meetings of denominational groups on
campus.
Progress Marked
Progress, however, has been marked in re
cent years. The denominational ministers, with
headquarters in Palo Alto, have slowly worked
their way on campus and are now united with
the chaplain's office in what Chaplain Robert
M. Minto calls "a common ministry to the
campus."
In addition, the winds of freedom seem to be
blowing favorably for high-level consideration
of re-interpretating the Grant to allow free
dom of worship on campus.
The Stanfords wore, as many observers have
noted, "extremely religious people," although
they professed no specific denominational af
filiation. Thus the establishment of the Univer
sity as non-denominational at a time when al
most all other private universities had religious
ties was somewhat unique. The spirit of the
founders was olio of toleration and revolution
with the intent el' fostering cooperation and
the prevention of the University's becoming
an "instrument" of any religious group.

But is a ministry directed toward Protes
tants in spirit with the times—when Catholi
cism, Judaism, ami "secularism" offer alter
natives to Protestantism—and in spirit with
the founders' intentions?
These questions and other related ones have
been the springboard for almost annual inves
tigations and re-evaluations of the religious
situation at Stanford.
The provisions of the Founding Grant on
religion had become so "restrictive" by 1946
that visiting chaplain Merrimon Cuninggim
was moved to report "Stanford has the weak
est program of any reputable university in
America."
Religious Coordinator
He urged the expansion of the Memorial
Church staff to include a "coordinator of re
ligious programs" and several assistants for
both the chaplain and the coordinator; the
establishment of a curriculum in religious
studies; the encouragement of student initia
tive in developing voluntary programs.
"The fundamental need of Stanford in the
area of religion," he concluded, "is a reconsti
tuted and revitalized philosophy of higher edu
cation which not only allows, but demands,
that religion play a large and integral part in
the University's life."
Apparently in response to the Cuninggim
report, President Donald B. Tresidder organ
ized the next year a student-faculty group to
re-evaluate the religious program on campus.
Mark Hatfield, now the governor of Oregon,
followed with a student-led group the next
year. And so it went, year after year.

demic freedom at the University for the dis
cussion and investigation of all areas except
religion. Students should have the right to be
exposed to all creeds, and while such opportu
nity is provided in academic courses, students
should be able to explore these areas on their
own in other than a classroom situation."
"We should avoid sectarianism." he sug
gested, "by allowing all groups the opportu
nity for expression."
Minto Disagrees
Minto stated his opposition to the sugges
tions of allowing all groups on-campus wor
ship. "I'm not in favor of the change advocated
by some," he said "I don't see a need for it.
The major problem is that most students don't
care for religion.
Minto pointed out that, under the stipula
tions of the Founding Grant, "the only respon
sibility the University has as far as religious
exercises go," is a Protestant, non-denomina
tional Memorial Church.
He added: "The University's hands were tied
by the Grant. The opportunity for worship is
not a prime problem here ... I don't know
what canges may come, but 1 won't come our
in demand for private places on campus."
At the time of the Daily-LASSU report, u
group of students who had attended an Ecu
menical Conference in Ohio during Christmas
break approached Minto, saying that the <*oji
ference had crystalized their ideas of what
should be done at Stanford and that they Jolt
obligated to express their commitment in more
responsible and meaningful ways than they
had in the past.
• Memorial Church does not
reflect an active Christian atti
tude of leadership toward the
whole community.
• The role of Memorial Church
in campus life should l>e more

than .just the conducting of wor
ship services. The Cliurch has
not been involved in the commu
nity. There is a need for the
development of a social aware
ness, concern, and involvement
with the life of the community.
• More guest preachers-in
residence would help to develop
this social awareness, as would
community services projects.
• A Christian commitment
means the willingness to be con
troversial and to question the
status quo. The prime example
is Christ.
Minto's Response
Minto responded by saying
that he felt there was general
agreement and that renewal was
needed. He expressed a desire to
work for change when he deter
mined what the community
wanted and needed. He said he
was pleased that the questions
were raised in an open atmo
sphere.
Minto subsequently created
the Stanford Christian Council,
calling for unity among stu
dents. faculty, and denomina
tional ministers, so that "we
may combine on the things that
we now need to do together."
Later that year President
Sterling created his Advisory
Committee on Religious Affairs,
the impetus for its formation
coming fi-om the $1.5 million gift
of Lowell Berry, which now
earns about $50,000 a year in
come.
The committee, according to
its chairman Richard Lyman
(Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences) is charged with
the exploration of "what we
aren't doing that we,could be
doing to provide richer religious
life on campus; what is the
place and purpose of religious
activities on campus."
The committee worked all last
year but its conclusions and rec
ommendations have not yet been
made public.
Progress in the religious pro
gram continued last year with
the extension of weekly meet
ings of the chaplain and the
denominational ministers and
with a liturgy-demonstration
program during which Catholic
chaplain Fa 1 her John Duryea
celebrated mass in Memorial
Church.

"The University must be forever maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis . . . the moral and religious development
of the University will be better accomplished
if entirely free from all denominational alli
ances, however slight the bond may be."
These words of Jane Stanford are part of the
Founding Grant of the University and have
served since 1902 as Stanford's definition of
religious policy, a policy in which the only
worship allowed on campus is the "non
denominational" service in Memorial Church
and one Which prohibited, until three years
ago, meetings of denominational groups on
campus.
Progress Marked
Progress, however, has been marked in re
cent years. The denominational ministers, with
headquarters in Palo Alto, have slowly worked
their way on campus and are now united with
the chaplain's office in what Chaplain Robert
M. Minto calls "a common ministry to the
campus."
In addition, the winds of freedom seem to be
blowing favorably for high-level consideration
of re-interpretating the Grant to allow free
dom of worship on campus.
The Stanfords wore, as many observers have
noted, "extremely religious people," although
they professed no specific denominational af
filiation. Thus the establishment of the Univer
sity as non-denominational at a time when al
most all other private universities had religious
ties was somewhat unique. The spirit of the
founders was olio of toleration and revolution
with the intent el' fostering cooperation and
the prevention of the University's becoming
an "instrument" of any religious group.

But is a ministry directed toward Protes
tants in spirit with the times—when Catholi
cism, Judaism, ami "secularism" offer alter
natives to Protestantism—and in spirit with
the founders' intentions?
These questions and other related ones have
been the springboard for almost annual inves
tigations and re-evaluations of the religious
situation at Stanford.
The provisions of the Founding Grant on
religion had become so "restrictive" by 1946
that visiting chaplain Merrimon Cuninggim
was moved to report "Stanford has the weak
est program of any reputable university in
America."
Religious Coordinator
He urged the expansion of the Memorial
Church staff to include a "coordinator of re
ligious programs" and several assistants for
both the chaplain and the coordinator; the
establishment of a curriculum in religious
studies; the encouragement of student initia
tive in developing voluntary programs.
"The fundamental need of Stanford in the
area of religion," he concluded, "is a reconsti
tuted and revitalized philosophy of higher edu
cation which not only allows, but demands,
that religion play a large and integral part in
the University's life."
Apparently in response to the Cuninggim
report, President Donald B. Tresidder organ
ized the next year a student-faculty group to
re-evaluate the religious program on campus.
Mark Hatfield, now the governor of Oregon,
followed with a student-led group the next
year. And so it went, year after year.
What has been the result of these frequent
surveys?
In 1950, the University established a Curric
ulum iti Religious Studies, under the guidance
of Alexander Miller. The program flourished

and was only temporarily slowed dowti by
Miller's death in 1960. As his replacement, the
University appointed in 1962 Robert McAfee
Brown, one of the nation's distinguished theo
logians. Dr. Brown has further expanded the
program to include a regular Catholic member
on the staff Mioliael Novak, appointed this
fall—and hopes soon to hire a Jewish scholar
and eventually expand into comparative
religions.
Denominational (.roups
The position of denominational groups on
campus has also improved markedly in recent
years. As a result of a Trustee decision in the
spring of 1963, all religious groups may hold
meetings on campus.
The breadth of this decision was challenged
the following fall by Hillel Director Harry
May who petitioned the University to use
classroom space for the teaching of Hebrew
and related subjects. He was denied permis
sion with the explanation that "formal courses
cannot be given on campus except by persons
holding academic appointments."
During that quarter, a group of students
from The Daily and the Legislature began
another investigation of religion. They pub
lished their conclusions in January in a series
of articles in The Daily and a report to
LASSU.
The report summarized the committee's find
ings: "It is apparent that religion at Stanford
is not now meeting student needs. Both the
opportunity and necessity for changes and in
creases in the entire religious program are
very much in order."
That religious worship for all denominations
l)e allowed on campus was the prime recom
mendation of the committee.
The committee also urged the University to
continue "its excellent work in the creation of

the Religious Studies program and in the ef
forts to expand it,"and suggested that income
from a $1.5 million donation given the Univer
sity the previous spring "be used to expand
the staff and programs of Memorial Church
and make them more relevant to the specific
needs of the students."
'Activities Inadequate'
A committee questionnaire showed a "wide
spread feeling that the religious activities and
policies of the University were inadequate and
unsuited to the present circumstances."
The Daily articles dealt with legal aspects
of the religious situation, responses of other
colleges to similar situations, and opinions of
various personnel at Stanford.
University lawyer Cassius Kirk expressed
the opinion that historical precedents exist
both for holding sectarian worship on campus
and for re-interpretation of the Founding
Grant.
"The fact that earlier administrations [those
during the life of Jane Stanford] have permit
ted sectarian services is at least evidence that
they did not consider such services in conflict
with the prohibitions of tin? Founding Grant."
Services Sectarian
Agreeing with the statements of Prof.
Brown and other theologians that the services
in Memorial Church are of the one sect
Protestantism Kirk stated that "the intent of
Mrs. Stanford, as expressed in the Founding
Grant, might be better served by permitting
other sects to conduct worship services on the
campus."
The Daily further reported that "many
denomination-endowed and non-sectarian col
leges have solved the 'bar-all, bar-none' prob
lem by allowing all religious groups to he
active on campus. The programs at Cornell,
Brandeis, Columbia, and Colgate were ex

plored.
Prof. Brown told The Daily: "Ways must be
found to permit groups to engage in corporate
worship on campus. We should not have aca
demic freedom at the University for the dis
cussion and investigation of all areas except
religion. Students should have the right to be
exposed to all creeds, and while such opportu
nity is provided in academic courses, students
should be able to explore these areas on their

ted sectarian services is at least evidence that
they did not consider such services in conflict
with the prohibitions of tin? Founding Grant."
Services Sectarian
Agreeing with the statements of Prof.
Brown and other theologians that the services
in Memorial Church are of the one sect
Protestantism Kirk stated that "the intent of
Mrs. Stanford, as expressed in the Founding
Grant, might be better served by permitting
other sects to conduct worship services on the
campus."
The Daily further reported that "many
denomination-endowed and non-sectarian col
leges have solved the 'bar-all, bar-none' prob
lem by allowing all religious groups to he
active on campus. The programs at Cornell,
Brandeis, Columbia, and Colgate were ex

plored.
Prof. Brown told The Daily: "Ways must be
found to permit groups to engage in corporate
worship on campus. We should not have aca
demic freedom at the University for the dis
cussion and investigation of all areas except
religion. Students should have the right to be
exposed to all creeds, and while such opportu
nity is provided in academic courses, students
should be able to explore these areas on their
own in other than a classroom situation."
"We should avoid sectarianism." he sug
gested, "by allowing all groups the opportu
nity for expression."
Minto Disagrees
Minto stated his opposition to the sugges
tions of allowing all groups on-campus wor
ship. "I'm not in favor of the change advocated
by some," he said "I don't see a need for it.
The major problem is that most students don't
care for religion.
Minto pointed out that, under the stipula
tions of the Founding Grant, "the only respon
sibility the University has as far as religious
exercises go," is a Protestant, non-denomina
tional Memorial Church.
He added: "The University's hands were tied
by the Grant. The opportunity for worship is
not a prime problem here ... I don't know
what canges may come, but 1 won't come our
in demand for private places on campus."
At the time of the Daily-LASSU report, u
group of students who had attended an Ecu
menical Conference in Ohio during Christmas
break approached Minto, saying that the <*oji
ference had crystalized their ideas of what
should be done at Stanford and that they Jolt
obligated to express their commitment in more
responsible and meaningful ways than they
had in the past.
• Memorial Church does not
reflect an active Christian atti
tude of leadership toward the
whole community.
• The role of Memorial Church
in campus life should l>e more

than .just the conducting of wor
ship services. The Cliurch has
not been involved in the commu
nity. There is a need for the
development of a social aware
ness, concern, and involvement
with the life of the community.
• More guest preachers-in
residence would help to develop
this social awareness, as would
community services projects.
• A Christian commitment
means the willingness to be con
troversial and to question the
status quo. The prime example
is Christ.
Minto's Response
Minto responded by saying
that he felt there was general
agreement and that renewal was
needed. He expressed a desire to
work for change when he deter
mined what the community
wanted and needed. He said he
was pleased that the questions
were raised in an open atmo
sphere.
Minto subsequently created
the Stanford Christian Council,
calling for unity among stu
dents. faculty, and denomina
tional ministers, so that "we
may combine on the things that
we now need to do together."
Later that year President
Sterling created his Advisory
Committee on Religious Affairs,
the impetus for its formation
coming fi-om the $1.5 million gift
of Lowell Berry, which now
earns about $50,000 a year in
come.
The committee, according to
its chairman Richard Lyman
(Associate Dean of Humanities
and Sciences) is charged with
the exploration of "what we
aren't doing that we,could be
doing to provide richer religious
life on campus; what is the
place and purpose of religious
activities on campus."
The committee worked all last
year but its conclusions and rec
ommendations have not yet been
made public.
Progress in the religious pro
gram continued last year with
the extension of weekly meet
ings of the chaplain and the
denominational ministers and
with a liturgy-demonstration
program during which Catholic
chaplain Fa 1 her John Duryea
celebrated mass in Memorial
Church.
(Tomorrow: Chaplain Minto
discusses the implications of the
changed structure of religious
effort on campus.)
"The University must be forever maintained
upon a strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian
basis . . . the moral and religious development
of the University will be better accomplished
if entirely free from all denominational alli
ances, however slight the bond may be."
These words of Jane Stanford are part of the
Founding Grant of the University and have
served since 1902 as Stanford's definition of
religious policy, a policy in which the only
worship allowed on campus is the "non
denominational" service in Memorial Church
and one Which prohibited, until three years
ago, meetings of denominational groups on
campus.
Progress Marked
Progress, however, has been marked in re
cent years. The denominational ministers, with
headquarters in Palo Alto, have slowly worked
their way on campus and are now united with
the chaplain's office in what Chaplain Robert
M. Minto calls "a common ministry to the
campus."
In addition, the winds of freedom seem to be
blowing favorably for high-level consideration
of re-interpretating the Grant to allow free
dom of worship on campus.
The Stanfords wore, as many observers have
noted, "extremely religious people," although
they professed no specific denominational af
filiation. Thus the establishment of the Univer
sity as non-denominational at a time when al
most all other private universities had religious
ties was somewhat unique. The spirit of the
founders was olio of toleration and revolution
with the intent el' fostering cooperation and
the prevention of the University's becoming
an "instrument" of any religious group.

But is a ministry directed toward Protes
tants in spirit with the times—when Catholi
cism, Judaism, ami "secularism" offer alter
natives to Protestantism—and in spirit with
the founders' intentions?
These questions and other related ones have
been the springboard for almost annual inves
tigations and re-evaluations of the religious
situation at Stanford.
The provisions of the Founding Grant on
religion had become so "restrictive" by 1946
that visiting chaplain Merrimon Cuninggim
was moved to report "Stanford has the weak
est program of any reputable university in
America."
Religious Coordinator
He urged the expansion of the Memorial
Church staff to include a "coordinator of re
ligious programs" and several assistants for
both the chaplain and the coordinator; the
establishment of a curriculum in religious
studies; the encouragement of student initia
tive in developing voluntary programs.
"The fundamental need of Stanford in the
area of religion," he concluded, "is a reconsti
tuted and revitalized philosophy of higher edu
cation which not only allows, but demands,
that religion play a large and integral part in
the University's life."
Apparently in response to the Cuninggim
report, President Donald B. Tresidder organ
ized the next year a student-faculty group to
re-evaluate the religious program on campus.
Mark Hatfield, now the governor of Oregon,
followed with a student-led group the next
year. And so it went, year after year.
What has been the result of these frequent
surveys?
In 1950, the University established a Curric
ulum iti Religious Studies, under the guidance
of Alexander Miller. The program flourished

and was only temporarily slowed dowti by
Miller's death in 1960. As his replacement, the
University appointed in 1962 Robert McAfee
Brown, one of the nation's distinguished theo
logians. Dr. Brown has further expanded the
program to include a regular Catholic member
on the staff Mioliael Novak, appointed this
fall—and hopes soon to hire a Jewish scholar
and eventually expand into comparative
religions.
Denominational (.roups
The position of denominational groups on
campus has also improved markedly in recent
years. As a result of a Trustee decision in the
spring of 1963, all religious groups may hold
meetings on campus.
The breadth of this decision was challenged
the following fall by Hillel Director Harry
May who petitioned the University to use
classroom space for the teaching of Hebrew
and related subjects. He was denied permis
sion with the explanation that "formal courses
cannot be given on campus except by persons
holding academic appointments."
During that quarter, a group of students
from The Daily and the Legislature began
another investigation of religion. They pub
lished their conclusions in January in a series
of articles in The Daily and a report to
LASSU.
The report summarized the committee's find
ings: "It is apparent that religion at Stanford
is not now meeting student needs. Both the
opportunity and necessity for changes and in
creases in the entire religious program are
very much in order."
That religious worship for all denominations
l)e allowed on campus was the prime recom
mendation of the committee.
The committee also urged the University to
continue "its excellent work in the creation of

the Religious Studies program and in the ef
forts to expand it,"and suggested that income
from a $1.5 million donation given the Univer
sity the previous spring "be used to expand
the staff and programs of Memorial Church
and make them more relevant to the specific
needs of the students."
'Activities Inadequate'
A committee questionnaire showed a "wide
spread feeling that the religious activities and
policies of the University were inadequate and
unsuited to the present circumstances."
The Daily articles dealt with legal aspects
of the religious situation, responses of other
colleges to similar situations, and opinions of
various personnel at Stanford.
University lawyer Cassius Kirk expressed
the opinion that historical precedents exist
both for holding sectarian worship on campus
and for re-interpretation of the Founding
Grant.
"The fact that earlier administrations [those
during the life of Jane Stanford] have permit
ted sectarian services is at least evidence that
they did not consider such services in conflict
with the prohibitions of tin? Founding Grant."
