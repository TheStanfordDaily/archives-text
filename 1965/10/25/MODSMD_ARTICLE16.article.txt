## Social Regs At Stanford; Emancipation 'Fallacies' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
T find there are two basic fal
lacies with your editorial "Social
Kegs . . . Again." The first is the
implication you make that men
and women should have equal
social rights at the University.
However, you neglect the fact
that equal rights Infer equal re
sponsibilities.
What are some of these re
sponsibilities? They include: half
the financial responsibility of a
social function, half the responsi
bility of transportation for a so
cial function (including fixing
half the flat tires), and half the
responsibility of originally mak
ing the date. If the young ladies
of the University are willing to
accept equal social responsibili
ties, then they indeed should
have equal social regs.
If they prefer to have the less
er responsibilities of the fairer
and weaker sex. then they should
be willing to accept the lesser so
cial rights of a fairer and weaker
sex.
The second fallacy is your as
sumption that social regulations
concerning open house hours are
vigorously enforced in the men's
dorms. Investigation by the edi
tor would disclose that these reg
ulations are not enforced in Wil
bur, Stern, or Toyon much less
in Crothers Memorial where the
average age is "something like
25."

• The Military Panacea
Editor, The Daily:
Protests against U.S. policy in
Vietnam are now more timely
than ever instead of being out
of date. James Keston's view in
his syndicated column of Octo
ber 18 that the peace initiative
no longer lies witli Washington,
but with Hanoi, is part of the
new phase in Washington in
which political solutions to Viet
nam are giving out almost en
tirely to military means, partic
ularly massive bombing.
The Administration has never*
been able to define clearly who
the enemy is; Congress lias de
clared war on no one. In the

Baltimore speech, Johnson blind
ly refused to negotiate with the
Viet Cong, persisting in the
White Paper myth that the war
in the South was directed from
the North when evidence even
for material support from the
North was then flimsy.
Even now when our "retalia
tory" bombing of the North has
pushed their troops into the
South, the brunt of the ground
fighting is still being borne by
the Viet Cong, and bombing in
the South is still far heavier
than in the North. Yot the far
thest the Administration is pre
pared to go is to negotiate with
the Viet Cong only as an appen
dage of the Hanoi delegation.
Thus Wo find ourselves in the
contradictory position of doing
most of our fighting against the
Viet Cong and directing our dip
lomatic efforts at the Viet Minh.
And even that, Mr. Reston and
our generals feel, we ought to
cease to do now.
Let us remember that Ho Chi
Minh laid down arms after the
victory of Dien Bien Pint in re
turn for the Geneva Accords,
which have not been honored by
France, or by the successors to
French power, the U.S. Though
not a signer of the Accords, our
delegate Bedell Smith offered a
separate statement in which we
pledged not to overthrow the
agreements. Yet we have con
spicuously done so by regarding
the 17th parallel as a permanent
dividing line, by sending for
eign troops into the area and by
influencing Diem in his refusal
of the 1956 elections.
We are militarily the stronger
party, and moves toward peace
will not diminish our fighting
will. On the other hand, a too
overt gesture from Hanoi would
appear to its fighting men to be
the beginning of surrender under
the increased bombing. We must
appreciate that, however Amer
icans may regard the war, to the
Vietnamese fighting us it is a
war against foreign invaders. As
we increase bombing to force ne
gotiations, we must, remember
that in fighting for our hide

pendence, we would have chosen
death rather than the dishonor
of negotiating under threats
what was rightly ours. We kill
our attempts to make peace by
assuming initially that the Viet
namese are less honorable than
we.
Nowadays, the combination of
political and economic and mili
tary weapons is giving way to
an exclusive reliance on force.
There is less talk in Washington
of winning the support of peas
ants, of waging guerilla warfare,
of strategic hamlets and land
reform.
Our involvement in Vietnam
has entered a new phase, charac
terized by saturation bombing in
the South. On an average day
our planes drop more bombs
than the French used in the 59
days at the height of the fight
ing before the Dien Bien Phu
surrender. Our policy seems now
aimed at undercutting Viet Cong
support by bombing the popula
tion, forcing those who do not.
die to enter the government
zones. In this way we can win—
win a host ile land we can never
hold, with loss of American lives
and a terrible toll on the Viet
namese population. This is no
victory. Yet, our Administration
is hardening in this pursuit of
non-victory by genocide. Our
leaders seem to be suffering the
Macbeth complex: so deep in
blood, it seems easier to go all
the way than turn back.
The anti-Vietnam war move
ment must now work harder and
wider than ever. Let us now
begin.

• Population
Editor, The aDily:
Confronted with our great
population problems, we must
evolve a new ethic. To now, the
religiously and socially espoused
morality has put the matter of
birth in the hands of parents
it is their right to have children
and the child's fortune to be
born. I rather think what ought

to be considered crucial is the
conceived child's right to
emerge from the womb into a
morally, physically, culturally,
and intellectually adequate en
vironment, that the child may
grow to become a useful mem
ber of society.
This means not only must a
family not bring forth more off
spring than it can decently sup
port, but also that the marginal
value to society of one more
child must be the determining
factor in population size. By this
I mean to say:
An additional child of low
income parents burdens not only
its parents but also our whole
society, and it especially bur
dens the middle-income families
whose welfare-state tax dollars
are transferred to the indigent
child at the expense of their own
children. If this transfer bene
fits the indigent child more than
it deprives the middle-income
child, society is the better for
the transfer. But the danger
point is reached when the poor
are so much with us that all
society is reduced to the lowest
common denominator, the point
where the middle-income child is
deprived more than the indigent
one benefits, the point where
population is so great that total
benefit to society begins to
diminish, and the marginal
benefit to society of a population
increment is a negative quan
tity.
And how does one measure
the marginal benefit of an extra
child% A government that can
put a decimal point in poverty
can set up criteria in terms of
national goals.
To the objection that this plan
gives the government unreason
able power over the private
lives of individual citizens, I
simply reply: What government
is more unconcerned with hu
man beings than one which com
mandeers the best years of
every young man and requires
him to kill other young men?
There is nothing fundamentally
new about a plan for govern
ment-run population control —
just a variation on a theme.
Sincerley.
