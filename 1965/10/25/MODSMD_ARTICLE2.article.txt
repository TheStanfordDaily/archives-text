# Accord Reached On Rush
## 
### 
A unified rush policy has been ap
proved. and living group presidents
will meet today to write the final draft
of the policy.
Prof. John Steward, who headed the
ad hoc committee which first proposed
the revised rush procedure, said fra
ternity, eating club, and Stern presi
dents met Friday and compromised
their disagreements on rush publica
tions, schedules, and rule-enforcement.
"Everybody was very cooperative,"
Steward said. He said the presidents
made relatively few changes in the
original proposals, and that the stu
dents also would consider appointing
new members to the ad hoc commit
tee.
Steward said this year's changes in
rush were minor, and that a "careful,
systematic" review by a student
faculty committee would be extremely
valuable. He said specific ideas this
year's ad hoe committee might explore
are extending the length of rush or
perhaps postponing it until the begin
ning of the sophomore year.
Before the living groups presidents
met Friday, the Interfraternity, Inter
club, the Interhouse councils went
over last spring's recommendations
and proposed changes. Fraternities re
vised the judicial appeals board and
bidding system, eating clubs ques
tioned how party dates would be set,
and the Stern Council offered addi
tional changes. The approved policy
will be released tomorrow.
