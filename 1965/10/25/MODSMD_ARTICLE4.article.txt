# ARFEP Seeks Synthesis
## 
### JIM SELNA JOHN BROADWIN 
Last night in Dinkelspiel Audito
rium Professor Otis Pease outlined
"a way of looking at the middle posi
tion" in United States Far Eastern
policy.
Pease's address was part of a pres
entation by the Americans for Re
appraisal of Far Eastern Policy

Â»AKFEP i.
Similar conferences were held at
more than forty campuses across the
country and were linked to together
by a closed circuit radio program
emanating from Yale University.
Speakers from the East included Nor
man Thomas. John Fairbank of Har
vard, and Allard K. Lowenstein.
Pease was critical of the three

trends of thought which dominate the
present dialogue concerning Far East
ern policy, characterized by the War
hawks, by the "Peace in Vietnam"
groups, and by the Administration.
He scored the "Peace in Vietnam"
groups for virtually "forfeiting a
chance to influence the Administra
tion" by their insistence on viewing
war in terms of absolute evil and a

matter of conscience.
However, Pease was quick to note
that such groups would generally
agree with the aims of ARFEP: the
admission of Red China into the
United Nations, negotiations in Viet
nam, and an attempt for cooperation
in areas of mutual interest between
the United States and China.
This forfeiture in Pease's opinion

lias reduced the debate in Washington
to tin 1 Warhawks and the Administra
tion, which Pease labelled as "partic
ularly alarming."
Par Eastern policy must be formu
lated with China rather communism
as the main consideration, the Stan
ford history professor emphasized.
Forcing policy in all areas must be
viewed in terms of power politics.
Pease praised the Administration
for its pluralistic approach to South
East Asia, using political and eco
nomic as well as military tactics. But
he noted. "You must know when 1o
let up." He critici'/ed U.S. policy mak
ers for not using the present advan
tage in Vietnam to seek negotiations.
"Flexible Diplomacy
In contrast to the rigid position now
held by the Administration. Pease
called for an "adept, flexible diplo
macy" which can take advantage of
favorable shifts in the cold war.
Concluding his address, he urged
that the United States gel about its
"work" in the world of helping all
mankind to progress through educa
tion and assistance in solving the ba
sic problems of a developing world.
"We do not need people who love lis;
we need people with whom we can
do business."
Moderator for the evening. Mike
Collins said that the present tension
in the United States might be the
"brink of a new McCarthy era."
ARFEP, he noted, is trying to fill the
need for responsible discussion and
serve as "a point of synthesis."
Nationwide Program
As part of the nationwide program,
John K. Fairbank, Harvard Sinologist,
discussed the basic con 112 ion tat ion with
China which lies behind the conflict
in Viet. Nam. Prof. Fairbanks views
the war as essentially a power strug
gle between Peking and Washington.
Quoting Eleanor Roosevelt as one of
America's most perspicacious experts
on foreign relations, Allard K. Lowcn
stein said that policymakers should
accede to her point of view that China
is a reality to be faced.
Lowcnstein noted by the way that
it was extremely unfortunate that
torn draft cards receive more public
ity than the thousands of people who
have made an earnest attempt to dis
cuss reasonably the issues which con
front America.
