# Tribe Rips Army Cadets, 31-14
## 
### 
. . . Army also played -so they say
- but it was hard to tell last Saturday
at Stanford Stadium when the Indians
scored the most impressive victory of
their warpath, routing the Corps 31-14.
The Indians' offensive baekfield
proved itself, once and for all, to be a
versatile and powerful maehine. The
top four rushers of the contest were
Stanford backs. Stanford gained 333
yards on the ground. Quarterback
Dave Lewis, who rushed 41 himself,
also completed 10 aerials in 19 tries
which were good for 90 yards.
Army Scores First
Ironically, the Black Knights were
first to score early in the first. It was
a contradiction of what was to come.
The 23 yard drive began when Stan
ford halfback Tim Abena was thrown
for a four yard loss after the snap for
his punt went bad.
Two plays later Army quarterback
Fred Barofsky skipped 24 yards into
the end /one. The conversion attempt
was good, and the Corps led 7-0 while
the clock showed 11:18 still left, in the
first.
The quarter was nearing its closc
when Stanford finally evened things.
Halfback Ray Handley bullied through
from the one, putting the finishing
touch on a 51 yard drive which took
eight plays, Terry DeSylvia booted the
point-after-touchdown. The quarter
closed with an even 7-7 score.
Cards Control 2nd Quarter
The Indians owned the second pe
riod. The opening seconds saw Stan
ford get possession from an Army
punt on its own 20 yard line. The sub
sequent 73 yard march to a field goal
took sewn minutes and 15 plays. De-
Sylvia's kick went 29 yards.
With 2:11 left in the half, the Tribe
scored again. This tally drive was set
up when safety Dale Rubin made a
beautiful interception on a long Army
pass at his own 31. The Indians then
rambled to their opponents' 17. At the
snap Lewis was looking for a receiver,
but suddenly cut up the middle and
ran ;i 17 yard obstacle course into the
end /.one. DeSylvia's kick went through
the posts, and Stanford led 17-7. The
tally remained the same tlu'ough to
halftime.
With 10:20 to go in the third, the
Cutlets scored for the last time. After
recovering a Stanford fumble on that
squad's 13 line, they marched to the
end zone in nine plays, ending with a
Barofsky plunge from the one. The
PAT conversion decreased the spread
to 3.
Indians Score in Third
1 1;i 1 f\v;i> through that chapter Stall
lord again hit pay dirt. A long o.x yard
drive terminated with an 11-yard
touchdown bullet from Lewis to end
Mike Connelly in the zone. DeSylvia
again converted. When time ran out
hi the third, Stanford was out in li out,
