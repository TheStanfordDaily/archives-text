# Soto Wins 'Brew' At Seca
## 
### 
Dick Blaekmier pulled arouud
Stanford's little dry lake in an Austin-
Healey Mini 830 for Ihe day's bcsl
time to gain a keg of victory brew for
the men of Soto in the third annual
Lagunita Seca races.
John Arlington of Crothers Memor
ial led the 17 entries in lite stock car
division with a time of 1:24.7.
Last year's defending stock chain*

pion, A TO. was eliminated in the pre
liminaries when their engine caught
fire. Three timers were also nearly
eliminated as the Arroyo car, coming
into the final turn of the 0.8 mile
obstacle course, swerved off the track
and hit the trash cans on which the
timers had been standing.
Two Brave Dollies
Only two brave ladies entered the

new Powder Puff division. Linda Bo
dine, driving for Cal Davis, bomber
four rear-wheeled Buiek across the
finish line thre seconds ahead of the
orange Phi Kappa Psi truck driven
by Crash Kovac. For her efforts Miss
Bodine received an inscribed scroll
and the starter's flag from the
Powder Puff division a sexy pink
slip glued to a pool cue.
Because of the large discrepancy in
the winning times in the Powder Puff
and the stock car divisions, the ex
pected run-off was eliminated, much
to the chagrin of the men of Crothers
Memorial.
Blaekmier's time of 1:21.2 edged out
Marc Levinc of Beta Chi. last year's
compact division winner. Levinc post
ed a time of 1:23.0 in his MG-B.
Both Arrington and Blackinier were
presented with kegs and inscribed
scrolls. There were no entries in the
humorous division this year.
Over 1500 persons watched the fes
tivities. Co-sponsors Alpha Sigma Chi
and Delta Kappa Epsilon plan on
sponsoring the races again next year.
