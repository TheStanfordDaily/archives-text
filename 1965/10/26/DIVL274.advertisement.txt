Dead or Alive?
On the walls of a New York subway recently appeared the chalked statement,
"God is dead — (signed) Nietzsche.'' But underneath someone else had written,
"Nietzsche is dead — (signed) God." Men throughout history have denied the
existence of God and many have even died quite genuinely believing God was
an invention of the human mind or that He had, at long last, died. But men who
say "God is dead are only telling us their own inner condition, for the glor
ious God who made us is alive and unchanged whether anyone cares to dis
cover this fact or not) To deny God is simply to cut oneself off from the Author
of life and Source of love.
The God of the Bible is neither imaginary nor dead, and He is today, as
He has always been, a personal God who is known personally by all those who
entrust their lives to Jesus Christ. God makes Himself real only to those who
call upon in simple faith, but He becomes a living reality to all who do. Thus
every follower of the Lord Jesus can echo the words of the Apostle John, If
we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is
the testimony of God that He has borne witness to His Son. He who believes
in the Son of God has the lesfimony in Himself. He who does not believe in the
Son of God has made Him a liar, because He has not believed in the testimony
that God has borne to His Son. And this is the testimony, that God gave us
eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life,- he who
has not the Son of God has not life" (I John 5: 1 9-22).
Why fight it? The God of love who runs the universe is fully prepared to
make Himself very real to you. To live in independence of Him is to choose
your own world of unreality rather than to enjoy a rich life beyond your big
gest dreams. Why not find out for yourself if God is dead or not? There is no
reason why you should tcike our word for it when Jesus Christ is the One who
says to you, "I came that they might have life and that more abundantly
John 10:10). He is only a prayer away.

entrust their lives to Jesus Christ. God makes Himself real only to those who
call upon in simple faith, but He becomes a living reality to all who do. Thus
every follower of the Lord Jesus can echo the words of the Apostle John, If
we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is
the testimony of God that He has borne witness to His Son. He who believes
in the Son of God has the lesfimony in Himself. He who does not believe in the
Son of God has made Him a liar, because He has not believed in the testimony
that God has borne to His Son. And this is the testimony, that God gave us
eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life,- he who
has not the Son of God has not life" (I John 5: 1 9-22).
Why fight it? The God of love who runs the universe is fully prepared to
make Himself very real to you. To live in independence of Him is to choose
your own world of unreality rather than to enjoy a rich life beyond your big
gest dreams. Why not find out for yourself if God is dead or not? There is no
reason why you should tcike our word for it when Jesus Christ is the One who
says to you, "I came that they might have life and that more abundantly

Dead or Alive?
On the walls of a New York subway recently appeared the chalked statement,
"God is dead — (signed) Nietzsche.'' But underneath someone else had written,
"Nietzsche is dead — (signed) God." Men throughout history have denied the
existence of God and many have even died quite genuinely believing God was
an invention of the human mind or that He had, at long last, died. But men who
say "God is dead are only telling us their own inner condition, for the glor
ious God who made us is alive and unchanged whether anyone cares to dis
cover this fact or not) To deny God is simply to cut oneself off from the Author
of life and Source of love.
The God of the Bible is neither imaginary nor dead, and He is today, as
He has always been, a personal God who is known personally by all those who
entrust their lives to Jesus Christ. God makes Himself real only to those who
call upon in simple faith, but He becomes a living reality to all who do. Thus
every follower of the Lord Jesus can echo the words of the Apostle John, If
we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; for this is
the testimony of God that He has borne witness to His Son. He who believes
