# Worship: Manifestation Of United Ministry
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor (Second in a . series 
On-campus worship by all faiths is not so
much a matter of revising the Founding
Grant as it is a recognition of the current
cooperative religious effort on campus, Chap
lain Robert M. Minto told The Daily in an
interview Friday.
The uniting of the chaplain's office and the
denominational ministers in "a common min
istry to the campus" means that worship
should now be viewed, he feels, as merely one
expression of a united religious program rath
er than as the conccdfrig of a privilege to an
outsider as it might have been in the past.
"I view the Founding Grant as enabling,
not as inhibiting. The Grant was concerned
with prohibiting any group's working for it
self to the exclusion or extinction of others.
We feel the non-sectarian provisions of the
Charter are guaranteed by the nature of our
group, cooperative in nature and geared to
the ecumenical spirit of the times."
Unity of Purpose
While recognizing there are legal problems,
the chaplain emphasized that "we have a unity

of purpose. There are no longer any structural
obstacles."
With the appointment this fall of the full
time ministers as chaplain's associates, the
ministers gained semi-official university sta
tus. The chaplain views this as "recognition
of the cooperative religious program in which
they play a vital part."
One of the ministers, Jim Corson of UCCM.
has been named coordinator of the chaplain's
staff and organizes, together with Mlnto, antl
leads himself the weekly campus ministers'
meetings.
Obstacles Overcame
"We have overcome any obstacles of coop
eration," Minto said. "The goal now is to elicit
student initiative for a cooperative effort in
the vitalizing of a common campus religious
program."
The chaplain expressed his understanding
for "the need of fellowship in denominational
groups," but emphasized his desire to have all
the denominational groups "unite in a com
mon program directed to the whole campus."
"We want to confront the entire University
community with the insights religion has on
academic problems. We want to bring the

religious element to the "notice of the entire
university," he stated.
One possible organ for student energy
would be the Committee on Religious Affairs,
a presently-defunct ecumenical student group
formerly in charge of approving religious pro
grams held on campus. "They could do any
thing they wanted to," the chaplain said, lie
hopes they will help organize some confer
ences he has planned for next quarter.
Minorities Conference
Late in January, Bill Webber of the East
Harlem Protestant Parish will visit campus
for four days to speak on minorities in urban
centers. Minto hopes also to bring for discus
sion other men in similar ministries from
Philadelphia and Oakland and representatives
of Mcnlo Park's self-help program.
An Ecumenical week is planned for the first
two weeks in February. Minto would like to
see it climax with an ecumenical banquet as
did a similar program two years ago.
Another possible channel for student initia
tive would be the Stanford Christian Council,
an interdenominational dialogue serving as
Stanfard's own ecumenical encounter.
Student Help
Minto also thinks students "can be a tre

mendous help" to the President's Advisory
Committee on Religious Affairs. "The pro
gram this committee considers is more di
rectly involved with students than any other
I can think of," Minto said.
The Chaplain views the Committee's charge
as "to discover the general pattern of reli
gious life on campus, and to expand the pro
gram of religious activities." The Committee,
under the chairmanship of Associate Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, Richard Lyman, is
charged with dispensing the approximately
$50,000 a year income from a gift by alumnus
Lowell Berry. Minto would like to see part of
the income spent on increasing the guest-in
residence program, including perhaps a visit
ing theologian who would stay for a quarter
or two.
Both the Committee and the religious pro
gram "are about to get off the ground," lie
states. "Everybody is now seeing clearly the
future lines of development: further coopera
tion, expansion of the religious program and
the installation of a coordinator of religious
activities."
Relevant Program
The major concerns now are "the search for
a relevant program and the creation of con

ditions where students can take the initiative
in determining the programs," Minto said.
"I am uot one to quibble about structure;
what we need is life in the program. We are
all working in one direction, but we also have
a rich and varied program. Ours is an inte
grated program aimed at arousing the interest
of thÂ» indifferent."
One problem of the campus ministers Minto
views as only temporary: lack of office space.
The ministers now staff a room at Wilbur
during the afternoon but "we are actively en
gaged in working for regular office spare.
Of course, it is very hard to find for non
teaching personnel."
Church House
111 the long range, Minto envisions a church
house, to be built in back of Memorial Church,
which would include, besides office space, a
library, founge, and choir-practice facilities.
"It is time to stop being content with make
shift quarters. There is obvious need for a
place out of which to run our cooperative,
revitalized religious program."
