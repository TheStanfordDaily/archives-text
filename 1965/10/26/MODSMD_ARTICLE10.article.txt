# Wilbur Jester Wails
## 
### JIM FIELDS 
The Jester, although located
between Madera and the dining
rooms in Wilbur Hall, might as
well bo located in a darkened
city cellar. Every Wednesday,
Saturday, and Sunday night the
Jester vibrates to the sounds of
jazz in a distinctively non-dormi
tory atmosphere.
There is a crowded intimate
feeling to the haphazardly scat
tered chairs and small candle-lit
tables in the Jester. The same
feeling is created on the walls
by the jazz album covers, post
ers, signs, sayings, sun- glassed
harlequin, and exotic menu. Real
walking and talking Freshman
waitresses serve such items as
cocoa, tea, coffee, pastries, junk
ies delight, or brand new pas
teurized Viet Nam punch.
The Jester was originally just
a place for a coffee break when
it was conceived in the spring
of last year. Cris Cristy, the
present manager, added the jazz
theme and most of the new char
acter this fall. N'ow he travels
around the Freshman dining
halls extolling the Jester's num
erous though sometimes non
existent merits.
All Is Relevant
Patrons go to the Jester for
a talk date, artistic inspiration,
or just placid vegetation. Noth
ing seems totally out of place
in the Jester. Overheard conver
sations cover everything from
the lofty concept of God to the
端biquitous concept of Branner
pigs. Lewd calls are made to

the waitresses by hungry Wil
bur animals. Seductions and
counter-seductons take place.
Math notes are exchanged. Eng
lish essays are hashed over. Viet
Nam is solved. Another student
decides for suicide. And the
Jester soaks it all into its atmos
phere as though it were all of
equal relevance.
Every evening the table mats
of the Jester are graced with
math problems, foreign lan
guage translations, baw d y
rhymes doodlings, drawings and
depressed poetic verse. The mats
are stored behind tho service
counter where thoy form a re
pository of customer thought.
The more musically inclined
of the Jester patrons also have
an outlet for their talents. Every
Wednesday night is open enter
tainment night in which stu
dents may come in and play or
sing.
The Jester is a great place for
something a little different from
the normal Stanford atmos
phere. One of Cris Cristy's favor
ite phrases is that the Jester is
"the soul coffee house of Stan
ford." The growing number of
patrons who keep returning
seem to agree.

Patrons go to the Jester for
a talk date, artistic inspiration,
or just placid vegetation. Noth
ing seems totally out of place
in the Jester. Overheard conver
sations cover everything from
the lofty concept of God to the
端biquitous concept of Branner
pigs. Lewd calls are made to

the waitresses by hungry Wil
bur animals. Seductions and
counter-seductons take place.
Math notes are exchanged. Eng
lish essays are hashed over. Viet
Nam is solved. Another student
decides for suicide. And the
Jester soaks it all into its atmos
phere as though it were all of
equal relevance.
Every evening the table mats
of the Jester are graced with
math problems, foreign lan
guage translations, baw d y
rhymes doodlings, drawings and
depressed poetic verse. The mats
are stored behind tho service
counter where thoy form a re
pository of customer thought.
The more musically inclined
of the Jester patrons also have
an outlet for their talents. Every
Wednesday night is open enter
tainment night in which stu
dents may come in and play or
sing.
The Jester is a great place for
something a little different from
the normal Stanford atmos
phere. One of Cris Cristy's favor
ite phrases is that the Jester is
"the soul coffee house of Stan
ford." The growing number of
patrons who keep returning
seem to agree.

Though there are no longer
any openings for student associ
ates in Wilbur this quarter,
there may be during Winter
quarter according to Alan Tay
lor, head sponsor at Wilbur.
The associateships enable up
per class men and women to
dine one or two meals a day with
freshman men and become bet
ter acquainted both with the
men and the activities of the
freshman class as a whole.
All men and women interested
in the program should contact
Taylor at 327-79J 8.
The Jester, although located
between Madera and the dining
rooms in Wilbur Hall, might as
well bo located in a darkened
city cellar. Every Wednesday,
Saturday, and Sunday night the
Jester vibrates to the sounds of
jazz in a distinctively non-dormi
tory atmosphere.
There is a crowded intimate
feeling to the haphazardly scat
tered chairs and small candle-lit
tables in the Jester. The same
feeling is created on the walls
by the jazz album covers, post
ers, signs, sayings, sun- glassed
harlequin, and exotic menu. Real
walking and talking Freshman
waitresses serve such items as
cocoa, tea, coffee, pastries, junk
ies delight, or brand new pas
teurized Viet Nam punch.
