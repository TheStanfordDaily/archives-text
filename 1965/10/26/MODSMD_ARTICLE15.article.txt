## 
### PERRY HACKETT 
By smashing tho San Jose
State Frosh 50-0 last Saturday,
i tie Stanford Papooses completed
their second win in two starts

perfect season.
From the beginning, Stanford
showed its dominance as the
Frosh scored their first touch
down after 1 minute 39 seconds.
The touchdown, the culmination
of three plays which netted 78
yards, was run by quarterback
Gene Washington who carried
Hie ball 02 yards to the end /one.
The extra point kicked by Bill
Shoemaker put the Junior Indi
ans in front 7-0.
Unable to move the ball, San
Jose's Russ Munson attempted
to punt ihc ball into Stanford
territory only to have defensive
end Bill Nicholson block ihe
punt and recover it on the San
Jose 21 yard line.

Kirtman Scores
Four plays later and four min
utes after the first TD, left half
bark Nate Kirtman carried a
Washington pitchout. for nine
yards and another Stanford
touchdown. Shoemaker's kick
put the Papooses ahead 14-0.
Again San Jose State was un
able to movp the ball against the
impregnable Stanford defense.
Returning the punt 29 yards to
San Jose territory, Washington
set up four plays which resulted
in 27 yards and t he third Indian
touchdown. The touchdown was
run 16 yards by Washington
who carried the ball only twice
and scored six points on both
rushes. Shoemaker's boot set tho
Stanford Frosh ahead 21-0 with
1:55 remaining in the first
quarter.
After filling the scoreboard in
the first quarter. Coach Dick
Vermeil freely substituted the

rest of the game as the Red
skins continued to increase their
lead. Alter 1:12 in the second
quarter Jack Hodges completed
a 34 yard pass to end Tom Wein
gartner for Stanford's fourth
touchdown. As a result of a fum
ble on the extra point kick,
Mark Marquess ran a two point
conversion to set the Junior
Tribe ahead 29-0.
Containment
There was no more scoring as
the two frosh teams contained
each other. Words of praise
came from San Jose State's
coach who complained lo his in
effectual offensive and defensive
units that they were making the
Papooses look like Ail-Ameri
cans.
Down 29 points at the begin
ning of the second half, the San
Jose Frosh received Shoemak
er's kick on their 13 yard line.
Again unable to maneuver, they
relinquished tho ball. Although
Stanford was unable to score,
they were happy to wait until
the State Frosh fumbled and
Stanford's Marquess was able lo
recover it.
Following this recovery, the
Tribe marched 73 yards in 11
plays to paydirt. With a first
and three on the San Jose three
yard line, fullback Greg Brough
ton carried the ball over the
middle for a three yard touch
down. Following Shoemaker's
boot, the Papooses led 36-0.
Helpful Penally
A few minutes later when the
Junior Indians had possession of
the ball, the Tribe attempted a
third down field goal. The at
tempt was blocked due to a bad
center, but penalties against San
Jose State resulted in Stanford's
having the option of the down'.
Revising strategy, the Papooses

marched for a first down, but
were unable to continue.
Following another fumble by
San Jose and a recovery by
Stanford on the State 34 yard
line, the Tribe moved for its
sixth TD. It took two plays.
Jack Hodges ran for 25 yards
and the touchdown. Shoemaker's
kick put Stanford ahead 43-0.
During the fourth quarter, the
Papooses again scored as full
back Greg Cramblit moved two

yards to score Ihc seventh and
last touchdown of the game. The
run was the end ol' an 11 yard
drive. Following the extra point
kick by Shoemaker, raising Stan
ford's total 1o 50-0, the two
teams hold each other for the
remaining 6:37 minutes.
Statistical Avalanche
Looking at Ihe statistics, the
Papooses did extremely well.
San Jose wont for 1 yard rush
ing and 103 yards passing while

Stanford totaled 360 yards rush
ing and 51 passing. The Tribe
had 22 first downs, San Jose had
only three, all tho result of
passing.
It was not surprising to see
4 or 5 Stanford players in on
a tackle.
Next Saturday Iho Frosh will
play Cal and the following week
end, Nov. 5, they will complete
their season with a tilt against
UCLA.

Helpful Penally
A few minutes later when the
Junior Indians had possession of
the ball, the Tribe attempted a
third down field goal. The at
tempt was blocked due to a bad
center, but penalties against San
Jose State resulted in Stanford's
having the option of the down'.
Revising strategy, the Papooses

marched for a first down, but
were unable to continue.
Following another fumble by
San Jose and a recovery by
Stanford on the State 34 yard
line, the Tribe moved for its
sixth TD. It took two plays.

Papooses did extremely well.
San Jose wont for 1 yard rush
ing and 103 yards passing while

Stanford totaled 360 yards rush
ing and 51 passing. The Tribe
had 22 first downs, San Jose had
only three, all tho result of

It was not surprising to see
4 or 5 Stanford players in on
a tackle.
Next Saturday Iho Frosh will

Containment
There was no more scoring as

coach who complained lo his in
effectual offensive and defensive
units that they were making the
Papooses look like Ail-Ameri

Down 29 points at the begin

Containment
There was no more scoring as
the two frosh teams contained

came from San Jose State's
coach who complained lo his in
effectual offensive and defensive
units that they were making the
Papooses look like Ail-Ameri
cans.
Down 29 points at the begin
ning of the second half, the San
Jose Frosh received Shoemak
er's kick on their 13 yard line.

Stanford's Marquess was able lo
recover it.

plays to paydirt. With a first
and three on the San Jose three

boot, the Papooses led 36-0.
Helpful Penally
A few minutes later when the
Junior Indians had possession of
the ball, the Tribe attempted a
third down field goal. The at
tempt was blocked due to a bad
center, but penalties against San
Jose State resulted in Stanford's

their season with a tilt against
UCLA.
