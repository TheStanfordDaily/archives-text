## 
### TOM EDISON 
Showing obvious signs of be
ing pleased and for the most
part relaxed, Coach John Ral
ston was very talkative and
made several jokes to the news
men after last Saturday's vic
tory over Army.
He assured everyone "that he
would keep his mouth shut
about Stanford's loss to the Tro
jan's just as USC's eoaeh, John
McKay, advised.
With his hands on his head,

staring at the wall at the back
of the room, Coach Ralston
made several comments reflect
ing on the day's contest —gener-
ally revealing his overall satis
faction with the performance of
his regular personnel. He also
expressed extreme pleasure in
the play of numerous reserves.
He singled out Jack Root and
Tim Abciia, hoth sophomores, as
doing an outstanding job play
ing in temperatures well above
90. Ralston did say, however,
that he was ashamed with the
physical condition of his team.
Explaining that even though
the weather meant he would
have to substitute more he had
planned on this tactic before.
Ilis feelings were that possibly
if he had used more reserves in
last week's game with USC, "It,
may have made a big difference
in the spirit and overall hustle
of the entire squad."
He stated that the general at
tack was centered around wide
open play and that "Lewis ran
more in this game than any be
fore and 112 was very pleased with
his play." Ho considered this
Lewis' "best game vet."
