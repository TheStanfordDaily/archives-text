### MARSHA ROOD 
Stanford has become one of the
first colleges in the country to con
front problems of church involvement
in secular affairs with its program
last summer on "Urbanization and
Modern Man," the Rev. Richard Roe,
one of the study's chief organizers,
told the Daily last week.
Tfie program consisted of a series
of field trips to San Francisco, work
shops and seminars which dealt with
problems confronting man as a result
of urbanization. Some of the topics
under discussion were "Implications
of Urbanization for Modern Man,"
"Worldly Holiness," and"The Church
in a World Come of Age."
United Church Campus Minister
Reverend Richard Roc, stated that
the field trips to San Francisco were
all over-subscribed and were, of great
benefit to those who went.
Synanon Trip
The first of these trips was to the
Seawall Addition of Synanon Hospital
which is concerned with the problems
of the drug addict. On the second
field trip, the group observed the
work of the Council on Religion and
Homosexuality. The Council Is trying
to reach members of the Homophile
Community through discussion groups
and other programs. The last field
tnip was to Freedom House, a com
munity organization that is dedicated
to helping the Negro tenant groups
in San Francisco through political
means.
Chaplain R. M. Minto, emphasized
that education and not community
service was the primary purpose of
the study groups.

Reverend Roe said that the guiding
idea for the program arose out of
Stanford Christian Council discussions
of a recently published hook, The Sec
ular City by Harvey Cox. The book
was commissioned as a study for the
ten regional conferences held each
year by the National Student Chris
tian Federation.
Rural Ethos in Urban World
According to the book, the church
has too long been wedded to a rural
ethos in an urban world, and is thus
outmoded. The author concluded that
the church must now affirm the posi
tive values of urban life and make an
effort to learn about its problems and
help solve them.
Gaining Momentum
Commenting on this. Reverend Roe
said, "Church concern for the secular
world is gaining momentum in the
United States and receives its primary
impetus from the growth on inner
city ministry." He went on to say that
Stanford is one of the first colleges
in the country to take part in Ihe
church movement toward involve
ment in secular problems.
Reverend Minto said that the suc
cess of this summer's program was
due to its organization, the coopera
tion of all religious groups on cam
pus, and the high quality of the sem
inars held.

and other programs. The last field
tnip was to Freedom House, a com
munity organization that is dedicated
to helping the Negro tenant groups
in San Francisco through political
means.
Chaplain R. M. Minto, emphasized
that education and not community
service was the primary purpose of
the study groups.

Reverend Roe said that the guiding
idea for the program arose out of
Stanford Christian Council discussions
of a recently published hook, The Sec
ular City by Harvey Cox. The book
was commissioned as a study for the
ten regional conferences held each
year by the National Student Chris
tian Federation.
Rural Ethos in Urban World
According to the book, the church
has too long been wedded to a rural
ethos in an urban world, and is thus
outmoded. The author concluded that
the church must now affirm the posi
tive values of urban life and make an
effort to learn about its problems and
help solve them.
Gaining Momentum
Commenting on this. Reverend Roe
said, "Church concern for the secular
world is gaining momentum in the
United States and receives its primary
impetus from the growth on inner
city ministry." He went on to say that
Stanford is one of the first colleges
in the country to take part in Ihe
church movement toward involve
ment in secular problems.
Reverend Minto said that the suc
cess of this summer's program was
due to its organization, the coopera
tion of all religious groups on cam
pus, and the high quality of the sem
inars held.
Stanford has become one of the
first colleges in the country to con
front problems of church involvement
in secular affairs with its program
last summer on "Urbanization and
Modern Man," the Rev. Richard Roe,
one of the study's chief organizers,
told the Daily last week.
Tfie program consisted of a series
of field trips to San Francisco, work
shops and seminars which dealt with
problems confronting man as a result
of urbanization. Some of the topics
under discussion were "Implications
of Urbanization for Modern Man,"
"Worldly Holiness," and"The Church
in a World Come of Age."
United Church Campus Minister
Reverend Richard Roc, stated that
the field trips to San Francisco were
all over-subscribed and were, of great
benefit to those who went.
Synanon Trip
The first of these trips was to the
Seawall Addition of Synanon Hospital
which is concerned with the problems
of the drug addict. On the second
field trip, the group observed the
work of the Council on Religion and
Homosexuality. The Council Is trying
to reach members of the Homophile
Community through discussion groups
and other programs. The last field
tnip was to Freedom House, a com
munity organization that is dedicated
to helping the Negro tenant groups
in San Francisco through political
means.
