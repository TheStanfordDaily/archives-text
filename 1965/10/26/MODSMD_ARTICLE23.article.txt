# A 						NATIONAL FIRST
## Repertory To Premiere Wednesday 
### ANNE BROPHY 
Over 150 preferred student
tickets are still available for
"Scoundrel Scapin," the Stan
ford Repertory Company's pre
miere presentation Wednesday
night. The curtain rises on the
inaugural season at 8:30 in Me
morial Auditorium.
Cutting through the gossamer
and glitter of opening night is
the responsibility felt by all in
volved to re-evaluate the impact
of the theater, and its role in
the Department, the University,
and the Peninsula.
The mechanics of the unique
professional-student relationship
offered by a theater inside aca
demia were ironed out through
a series of precedent-setting ne
gotiations with Actor's Equity
Union. Managing Director Peter
Troxell reports that the con
tracts and proposals used in
Stanford's negotiations are be
ing studied by the Union as
models for similar agreements
for other universities. Thus, un
ion officials .join a nation-wide
audience of university drama
tists who await the results of
Stanford's pioneering venture.
Rockefeller Grant
Financed by a Rockefeller
grant of $300,000.00 spread over
a three-year period, the reper
tory theater will fill a dual role
as it will be both a production
organization and a part of the
teaching program for the newly
revamped Master of Fine Arts
Degree, which in turn leads into
a new Ph.D. program. Students
in MFA work with the profes
sional actors in performance, on
stage and in technical and di
recting capacities. Off stage,
members of the Theater com
pany teach classes in their spe
cific fields.
Renovations within the build
ing have been financed by the
grant. The face-lifting includes
a thorough paint job of Memo
rial Auditorium and the Little
Theater. Costing more than
$80,000 this is the first major
work done in Memorial Hall
since its construction in 1937.
Troxell remarks that the con
struction of a thrust stage will
allow all the action in "Scoun

drel Scapin" to bo staged in
front of the proceium arch, al
lowing for greater flexibility as
well as producing better visibil
ity and overcoming acoustical
barriers which have plagued pre
vious shows.
"Uniquely Exciting" is the
prevailing description encoun
tered throughout the Speech and
Drama Department. Staff and
students stress the constant
change, exemplified most clearly
by the spontaneous emergence
of the Repertory Theater along
with tho MFA.
Slriet Professionalism
"The Repertory Theater is
opening the eyes of the MFA
students to tho strict profession
alism of the theater," remarks a
department member. Students
too, stress as a prime advantage
the opportunity to study under
company members who are
scholars as well as accomplished
artists.
The congeniality of the cast
and crew is cited as the saving
grace, especially in the last hec
tic and tension filled days. As
the grant and the backing of
the university remove "box of
fice pressure." all are looking
forward to devoting their talent
to the creation and performance
of meaningful roles.

A fow grumblings have
pierced the glittering accounts
of the new venture, chiefly from
two sources. The professionals
of tho theater are taking some
of ihp spotlight and most of the
lead roles which formerly went
to graduate students. Many of
these are ready to chip in with
bit parts and lots of "slave la
bor" as part of the initial ef
fort of getting tho program
started, but, once tho season is
underway many feel that "it is
inherent to tho attitude of tho
actor to want to act, and all tho
courses in theory in the world
just aren't the same as being on
stage in a good part. To learn
his art, it is vital that the acting
student be allowed to play all
types of roles."
Rain's Head Rumbles
Rumblings of disenchantment I
and charges of displacement 1
without representation are em
anating from the Offices of!
Ram's Head. A question of pan
acea or paradox is raised by
those who feel that in its efforts
to present skillful professional
drama tho Repertory Theater is
squelching undergraduate drama
throughout the campus.
Faced with the prospect of
presenting Winter One-Acts in

porary basis for this season, it
the Nitery, Ex-Ram's Head Pres
ident Ed Blair comments that
"the Nitery isn't really a the
ater, it's a play-toy, suitable for
types of class-work production
in studio theater, but not for
Ram's Head."
"Ram's Head isn't interested
in experimental plays, but in
large-scale traditional musical
entertainment, that requires the
facilities of Memorial Auditori
um," remarks President Jay
Weaver. Ram's Head displace
ment from both the main stage
of Mem Aud, and also the 1 work
shop facilities has definitely
slowed s t u d en t productions.
"They're definitely in the driv
er's seat," Weaver continues,
"and while Ram's Head has ac
cepted the conditions on a torn

is obvious that some compro
mise over use of existing stage
space will have to be reached in
older for the groups to continue
in peaceful co-existence.
W ill Find A Way
Perched between sets in Mem
Aud, MFA candidate Tom Bach
etti, who last year produced
Ram's Head's "Once Upon a
Mattress" admitted the possibil
ity that The Repertory Theater
could upset Ram's Head, but, he
adds, "if students are willing to
put on a play they'll find a
place." Other grad students
praise the concept ol the Nitery
theater, but feel that the under
grad gets the raw in not work
ing with the Rep. Co.
