# Stern House Displays SF Art Institute Exhibit
## 
### BARBARA MOORE 
Art is being dished up with
(he spinach and mystery meat
in Stern Hall this quarter. Stern
houses Lassen, Larkin, Holiday,
and Fremont are exhibiting
works of San Francisco Art In
stitute students in their lounges
and dining rooms.
Open to the public 12 to 1 p.m.
and 7 to 11 p.m., the art exhibits
will run until December 10. Most
of the paintings are for sale.
The purpose of the art exhibit
is exposure. "Better than an
hour in a museum." Stanford
art major John McPherson says,
"is the prolonged exposure to
the ideas the painters have been
developing for months or years."
McPherson points out, "Even
though the paintings can be de
scribed, they should be seen and
considered as visual objects for
all of them deny literal inter
pretation."
Color and Shape
Since the eye reacts through
color and shape, this vocabulary
of the visual world is explored
from many sides by the paint
ers. Paintings which reveal the
scope of rhe works are "Seated
Woman" by Jim Edwa r d s ,
"Planes" by Adam Rhineking,
and "Woman on the Beach" by
James Issaccson.
Jim Edward's "Seated Wom
an" illustrates one of the dom
inant trends in the show. The
solid, stable figure of the wom
an gazes at something outside
the canvas, thus creating an
awareness of a world inside and
a world outside the painting.
Sculpted out of beiges and
greys, the woman's head is sur
rounded by an orange hat. The
hat contrasts strongly with the
complementary blue of the back
ground sea.
Imitation of Nature
While "Seated Woman" deals
with organic shapes in imitation
of nature, "Planes," by Rhine
king explores machine-like al>
stractions from nature.

"Planes" explores pure shape'
and color. Rhineking uses a
green shape around a blue one
and green accentuated by an in
tensifying pink line. Three white
rectangles move from right to
left across the painting to unify'
through repetition the different
areas of color and shape.
In the third representative!
work, "Woman on the Beach," '
(
James Issaccson is clearly con- j
cemed with the total composi
tional arrangement. He subordi
nates even the smallest details |
of the distant figures on the J
beach to suit the overall order j
of the work.
What makes Issaccson's work ,
significant is the manner ip
which he has created tension ;
between concern for a three- j
dimensionally deep space and
concern for u flat, two dimen
sional pattern.
Issaccson's subject matter is
organic, much like Edward's i
"Seated Woman." Yet, likoj
Rhineking, he is also concerned
with ordering the shapes of his
painting into a solid and orderly
environment.
