"Students can be a tremendous help to the
President's Advisory Committee on Religious
Affairs. The program this committee considers
is more directly invoiced with students than any
other I can think of." Chaplain l\. M. Minto
Today, the eight-man Religious Affairs com
mittcx* mentioned above w ill consider a petition
from Clark Brown, ASSU Vice-President, re
questing that student members be added to
this committee.
We strongly urge the committee to heed this
petition.
Presently, University policy decrees that the
only form of worship allowed on campus is the
"non-denominational service in Memorial
Church. Tins is in keeping with Mrs. Stanford's
Founding Grant, which declared that "The Uni
versity must be forever maintained upon a
strictly non-partisan and non-sectarian basis . . .
the moral and religious development of the
University will be better accomplished if en
tirely free from all denominational alliances,
however slight the bond may be.
In 1902 this was a progressive doctrine, but
today — with Catholic, Judaic and numerous
neo- and post-Christian theologies actively com
peting for student acceptance — it is obvious
that in order to update the "spirit of this state
ment it is nceessan to adopt a "pan-sectarian"
policy of religious freedom instead of the con
temporary "non-sectarian" policy of Protestant
domination.
In 1963. the Trustees ruled that all religious
groups could hold meetings on campus. The cur
rent religious program, though it has progressed
much in recent years, is still understaffed
and inadequately housed . . . and Memorial
Church is still closed to all services but those
of an unmistakably Protestant bent.
It has been the role of the Religious Affairs
Committee, established bv President Sterling in
j963, to deal with this problem. Richard Ly

man, Associate Dean of Humanities and
Sciences and chairman ol the committee, has
defined his committee's job as "exploration of
what we aren't doing that we could be doing
to provide richer religious life on-campus; w hat
is the place and purpose of religious activities
on campus."
Uist year, the committee submitted its con
clusions and recommendations to Sterling, but
so far these have not been made public — nor
even forwarded to the Board of Trustees for
study. Moreover, nothing has yet been an
nounced — publicly, at least — as to how the
approximately $50,000 a year income from
Lowell Berry's $1.5 million gift is to be used.
It must be noted that student interest in this
area has not been lacking. Two years ago, Daily
editor llene Sterlitz opened a prolonged study
of the entire problem. Later that year, ASSU
President Bud Wedin commissioned a student
committee to research the existing program and
make recommendations for its improvement.
The resulting report was supposedly considered
by the Lyman committee, but the extent of its
usage is still unknown — as are that committee's
recommendations to Sterling.
In light of the committee's important role in
changing present policy, the argument that the
student body should not be represented be
cause personnel problems are discussed, seems
hollow indeed. The addition of student mem
bers would not only serve to lubricate the
bureaucratic machine (which seems to have
stalled somewhere), but it would also allow
students still another opportunity to participate
in the creative aspect of policy-making.
Surely, if President Sterling thinks it neces
sary to have student members on the relatively
minor Editorial Advisory Committee of "Stan
ford Today", he—and Dean Lyman's committee
—cannot deny student concern in the vital field
of religious policy.
