# BEYOND HOOVER TOWER
## Alternatives To Monastic Life 
### TOM BOWEN Assistant Feature Editor (Third in a Series 
After having tasted the sweet
bitterness of most Stanford-high
school relationships, the average
male student generally tends to
either resign himself to the life
of a hermit in his dormitory
room or continue his search for
female companionship to other
institutions which abound in the
Bay area.
The first type of institution is
the local junior colleges—Foot
hill ami the College of San Ma
teo—which are not at all afflict
ed with Stanford's ratio woes,
but which manage to have
enough problems of their own to
keep occupied.
Charateristically Foothill and
CSM girls appear at first sight
to be reasonably well bred, at
tractive young girls who are in
the limbo of junior college be
cause daddy either can't or won't
send them to a four year in
stitution.
Purse String Problem
This impression Is not entirely
untrue. They are, as a group
considerably more attractive
than either the Paly High or
Stanford varieties, buf they are
not always going to junior col
lege because of a problem with
purse strings.
Sometimes it tends to be
more of a problem of being
either voluntarily or Involuntar
ily tied to mommy's apron
strings. This does not imply
that all junior college girls are
immature and mommy's little
girl, but a large enough portion
of them are that it can tend to
hamper anyone of reasonably
adult tastes to pursue or even
attempt to pursue a mature re
lationship with a Foothill or
CSM dollie.
Another group of these young
ladies arc not at JC's so much
b<<eausc they are immature as
because they are n«»t capable of
getting into any other institu
tion of higher learning. For des
pite occasional mumblings to
the contrary, the admission re
quirements at both of these
schools are not much beyond
a high school diploma. It's not
thai one can'l carry on an in

telligent conversation with a
junior college girl, but the ex
isting world's record is in the
neighborhood of two and a half
minutes.
Words Like Water
But if it is conversation that
one is looking for, there is a
school within driving distance
of Stanford where the conver
sation flows like water—contin
ually and very shallow. This is
the famous (or infamous de
pending on your point of view)
Mills College in Oakland.
Mills' outstanding feature is
that it is a girls' school. Con
sequently, the legend goes,
every girl in the place is totally
sexually slarvcd and will jump
at the sight of anyone in pants.
Unfortunately this is not gen
erally true. While there are in
the words of one Mills coed "a
few loose girls", the majority
are almost too innocent for
their own good.
Oh sure, they will bring a
busload down for an exchange
at the drop of an invitation, but
tlie most exciting thing that can
be counted on at such a func
tion is the pattering of small
talk about Wilbur's beautiful
architecture, or what nice boys
your fraternity brothers are. or
how cute all those red tile roofs
look.
Finishing School
Mills girls aren't at all stupid
or niavc, but they tend to give
one Ihe feeling that he is at a
very proper eastern girls fin
ishing school. Everyone tries to
talk and act quite properly and
the social activities are a match
for this. Not everything at Mills
is totally straight laced, but if
one ever has to wear a tuxedo
while an undergraduate at .Stan
ford. chances are it will be to a
party at Mills. Within the con
fines of the ugly iron gate on
Ihe road into campus are many
opportunities for both mature
and lasting relationships, if one
constantly keeps PROPRIETY
on his mind.
For girl watchers and chasers
everywhere there is a paradise
on the peninsula. Nationally
known f*s one of the five great
party schools, and renowned
statewide for having the most
beautiful girl; of any campus

in California, San Jose Stale
exists in a separate world 18
miles south of Stanford.
Actually the separate world is
only the world of the sororities,
which are as exclusive as they
can he at the bottom of the
state's system of public insti
tutions of higher learning.
Theirs is a world of wild raging
parties with all of the"social
clubs" on campus (fraternities
are passe), and Stanford and
Stanford men have very little or
no plaec in it.
Don't Love Books
Of course neither do the girls
who live in dorms, and as a
matter of fact far too many of
them sit at home on weekends
with little or no social oppor-

tunities knocking at their door,
and it is not because they love
to book.
As a matter of fact nobody at
SJS loves to book, which isn't
surprising since the entrance re
quirements class it as the only
four year junior college in the
state. True, there are a few in
telligent girls going to San Jose
who actually study, but finding
them would make hunting need
les in a haystack a cinch. Most
are just pretty young things,
nothing more.
This no brains good looks
classification makes them the
perfect antithesis of the Stan
ford dolly that 4012 Farm un
dergraduates sec, or think they
are seeing every day of the year.

with little or no social oppor-

tunities knocking at their door,
and it is not because they love
to book.
As a matter of fact nobody at
SJS loves to book, which isn't
surprising since the entrance re
quirements class it as the only
four year junior college in the
state. True, there are a few in
telligent girls going to San Jose
who actually study, but finding
them would make hunting need
les in a haystack a cinch. Most
are just pretty young things,
nothing more.
This no brains good looks
classification makes them the
perfect antithesis of the Stan
ford dolly that 4012 Farm un
dergraduates sec, or think they
are seeing every day of the year.
After having tasted the sweet
bitterness of most Stanford-high
school relationships, the average
male student generally tends to
either resign himself to the life
of a hermit in his dormitory
room or continue his search for
female companionship to other
institutions which abound in the
Bay area.
The first type of institution is
the local junior colleges—Foot
hill ami the College of San Ma
teo—which are not at all afflict
ed with Stanford's ratio woes,
but which manage to have
enough problems of their own to
keep occupied.
Charateristically Foothill and
CSM girls appear at first sight
to be reasonably well bred, at
tractive young girls who are in
the limbo of junior college be
cause daddy either can't or won't
send them to a four year in
stitution.
Purse String Problem
This impression Is not entirely
untrue. They are, as a group
considerably more attractive
than either the Paly High or
Stanford varieties, buf they are
not always going to junior col
lege because of a problem with
purse strings.
Sometimes it tends to be
more of a problem of being
either voluntarily or Involuntar
ily tied to mommy's apron
strings. This does not imply
that all junior college girls are
immature and mommy's little
girl, but a large enough portion
of them are that it can tend to
hamper anyone of reasonably
adult tastes to pursue or even
attempt to pursue a mature re
lationship with a Foothill or
CSM dollie.
Another group of these young
ladies arc not at JC's so much
b<<eausc they are immature as
because they are n«»t capable of
getting into any other institu
tion of higher learning. For des
pite occasional mumblings to
the contrary, the admission re
quirements at both of these
schools are not much beyond
a high school diploma. It's not
thai one can'l carry on an in

telligent conversation with a
junior college girl, but the ex
isting world's record is in the
neighborhood of two and a half
minutes.
Words Like Water
But if it is conversation that
one is looking for, there is a
school within driving distance
of Stanford where the conver
sation flows like water—contin
ually and very shallow. This is
the famous (or infamous de
pending on your point of view)
Mills College in Oakland.
Mills' outstanding feature is
that it is a girls' school. Con
sequently, the legend goes,
every girl in the place is totally
sexually slarvcd and will jump
at the sight of anyone in pants.
Unfortunately this is not gen
erally true. While there are in
the words of one Mills coed "a
few loose girls", the majority
are almost too innocent for
their own good.
Oh sure, they will bring a
busload down for an exchange
at the drop of an invitation, but
tlie most exciting thing that can
be counted on at such a func
tion is the pattering of small
talk about Wilbur's beautiful
architecture, or what nice boys
your fraternity brothers are. or
how cute all those red tile roofs
look.
Finishing School
Mills girls aren't at all stupid
or niavc, but they tend to give
one Ihe feeling that he is at a
very proper eastern girls fin
ishing school. Everyone tries to
talk and act quite properly and
the social activities are a match
for this. Not everything at Mills
is totally straight laced, but if
one ever has to wear a tuxedo
while an undergraduate at .Stan
ford. chances are it will be to a
party at Mills. Within the con
fines of the ugly iron gate on
Ihe road into campus are many
opportunities for both mature
and lasting relationships, if one
constantly keeps PROPRIETY
on his mind.
For girl watchers and chasers
everywhere there is a paradise
on the peninsula. Nationally
known f*s one of the five great
party schools, and renowned
statewide for having the most
beautiful girl; of any campus

in California, San Jose Stale
exists in a separate world 18
miles south of Stanford.
Actually the separate world is
only the world of the sororities,
which are as exclusive as they
can he at the bottom of the
state's system of public insti
tutions of higher learning.
Theirs is a world of wild raging
parties with all of the"social
clubs" on campus (fraternities
are passe), and Stanford and
Stanford men have very little or
no plaec in it.

Of course neither do the girls

in California, San Jose Stale
exists in a separate world 18
miles south of Stanford.
Actually the separate world is
only the world of the sororities,
which are as exclusive as they
can he at the bottom of the
state's system of public insti
tutions of higher learning.
Theirs is a world of wild raging
parties with all of the"social
clubs" on campus (fraternities
are passe), and Stanford and
Stanford men have very little or
no plaec in it.
Don't Love Books
Of course neither do the girls
who live in dorms, and as a
matter of fact far too many of
them sit at home on weekends
with little or no social oppor-

tunities knocking at their door,
and it is not because they love
to book.
As a matter of fact nobody at
SJS loves to book, which isn't
surprising since the entrance re
quirements class it as the only
four year junior college in the
state. True, there are a few in
telligent girls going to San Jose
who actually study, but finding
them would make hunting need
les in a haystack a cinch. Most
are just pretty young things,
nothing more.
This no brains good looks
classification makes them the
perfect antithesis of the Stan
ford dolly that 4012 Farm un
dergraduates sec, or think they
are seeing every day of the year.
After having tasted the sweet
bitterness of most Stanford-high
school relationships, the average
male student generally tends to
either resign himself to the life
of a hermit in his dormitory
room or continue his search for
female companionship to other
institutions which abound in the
Bay area.
The first type of institution is
the local junior colleges—Foot
hill ami the College of San Ma
teo—which are not at all afflict
ed with Stanford's ratio woes,
but which manage to have
enough problems of their own to
keep occupied.
Charateristically Foothill and
CSM girls appear at first sight
to be reasonably well bred, at
tractive young girls who are in
the limbo of junior college be
cause daddy either can't or won't
send them to a four year in
stitution.
Purse String Problem
This impression Is not entirely
untrue. They are, as a group
considerably more attractive
than either the Paly High or
Stanford varieties, buf they are
not always going to junior col
lege because of a problem with
purse strings.
Sometimes it tends to be
more of a problem of being
either voluntarily or Involuntar
ily tied to mommy's apron
strings. This does not imply
that all junior college girls are
immature and mommy's little
girl, but a large enough portion
of them are that it can tend to
hamper anyone of reasonably
adult tastes to pursue or even
attempt to pursue a mature re
lationship with a Foothill or
CSM dollie.
Another group of these young
ladies arc not at JC's so much
b<<eausc they are immature as
because they are n«»t capable of
getting into any other institu
tion of higher learning. For des
pite occasional mumblings to
the contrary, the admission re
quirements at both of these
schools are not much beyond
a high school diploma. It's not
thai one can'l carry on an in

telligent conversation with a
junior college girl, but the ex
isting world's record is in the
neighborhood of two and a half
minutes.
Words Like Water
But if it is conversation that
one is looking for, there is a
school within driving distance
of Stanford where the conver
sation flows like water—contin
ually and very shallow. This is
the famous (or infamous de
pending on your point of view)
Mills College in Oakland.
Mills' outstanding feature is
that it is a girls' school. Con
sequently, the legend goes,
every girl in the place is totally
sexually slarvcd and will jump
at the sight of anyone in pants.
Unfortunately this is not gen
erally true. While there are in
the words of one Mills coed "a
few loose girls", the majority
are almost too innocent for
their own good.
Oh sure, they will bring a
busload down for an exchange
at the drop of an invitation, but
tlie most exciting thing that can
be counted on at such a func
tion is the pattering of small
talk about Wilbur's beautiful
architecture, or what nice boys
your fraternity brothers are. or
how cute all those red tile roofs
look.
Finishing School
Mills girls aren't at all stupid
or niavc, but they tend to give
one Ihe feeling that he is at a
very proper eastern girls fin
ishing school. Everyone tries to
talk and act quite properly and
the social activities are a match
for this. Not everything at Mills
is totally straight laced, but if
one ever has to wear a tuxedo
while an undergraduate at .Stan
ford. chances are it will be to a
party at Mills. Within the con
fines of the ugly iron gate on
Ihe road into campus are many
opportunities for both mature
and lasting relationships, if one
constantly keeps PROPRIETY
on his mind.
For girl watchers and chasers
everywhere there is a paradise
on the peninsula. Nationally
known f*s one of the five great
party schools, and renowned
statewide for having the most
beautiful girl; of any campus

in California, San Jose Stale
exists in a separate world 18
miles south of Stanford.
