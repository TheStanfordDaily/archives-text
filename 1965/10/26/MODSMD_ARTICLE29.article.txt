## Policies For Improving U.S.-Canadian Relations 
### 
A short visit to Canada, ex
actly two days, makes you real
ize that; U.S.-Canadian relations
are at low ebb. Everywhere I
went, Canadians complained to
me that the United States had
been ignoring Canada and al
though the country is now in the
midst of a hot election campaign,
no one south of the border re
ally cared.
"We cared about your elec
tions," a friend said. "Why don't
you care about ours? It seems
nothing we do up here makes
any impact on the United
States."
I had to agree, but I told my
friends it was their own fault.
Relations Too
"You haven't given us any
trouble in a long while," I re
minded them. "The difficulty is
that relations between the two
countries are so good they're
starting to deteriorate. In order
for us to pay any attention to
anybody, the United States must
be provoked."
"How can we provoke you?"
"It isn't easy," I admitted. "It
would help if you had a serious
Communist problem. We're al
ways ready to step in and help a
country being threatened by
Communists. If you had a real
Red threat coming up in the
elections, you woud not only get
our attention but military and
economic aid as well."

"But we don't have a Commu
nist threat:," the friend protested.
"Then why don't you pull a
de Gaulle on us?"
"How's that?"
"Why don't you threaten to
pull out of the Western Hem
isphere defense alliance? Tell
the U.S. you want to set up
your own DEW line and start
working on your own atomic
bomb."
"That would be expensive."
lit turn The Seaway?
"Well, then, why don't you
have your students demand that
the United States give you back
the St. Lawrence Seaway? They
could stone the U.S. Embassy
and burn the American flag at
Niagara Falls."
"Our students are too inter
ested in getting an education.
The only ones who want to dem
onstrate are the French students
in Quebec and all they're inter
ested in is burning the flag of
the government in Ottawa."
"I hate to suggest this," I said,
"but have you ever thought of
building a wall all along the
Canadian border with check
points where you could have
diplomatic incidents such as
they're having in Berlin?"
"It's been discussed. But. we
don't have the labor. We were
even thinking of setting up an
air corridor for American planes
flying to Alaska and if the
planes strayed out of the cor
ridor we would have our fight
ers go up and force them down."
"That would get you some
attention," I said excitedly.
"The Canadian Air Force said
they weren't interested."
A Spy Trial
"Why not a humdinger of a
spy trial? Arrest a few Ameri
can businessmen as spies and
hold a public hearing. You could
frame them easily."
"It would hurt Canadian busi
ness."
"It's obvious that what Can
ada needs is a Nasser, a Sukar
no, or a Chou En-laiâ€”someone
to tell us to go jump in the
ocean."
"Diefenbaker has been hint
ing at it, but nobody seems to
be paying any attention."
"Well, I can't help you then.
We're willing to help you in any
way we can, but only if you're
willing to make life difficult for
us. We have too many enemies
we're trying to win over to
spend much lime on wooing
our friends."
