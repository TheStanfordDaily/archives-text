# SJY Hosts Fitzgerald, 'The Duke'
## 
### 
Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington
and his orchestra will present the
second major afternoon concert in the
all-student Stanford Jazz Year series
in Frost Memorial Amphitheater at
2 p.m. Sunday.
In the view of many jazz critics,
the appearance of Miss Fitzgerald
and Duke Ellington on the same stage
will give the audience a view of two
figures who have dominated the jazz
scene for more than 30 years.
Since Ella Fitzgerald made her de
but with Chick Webb's orchestra in
the late 30's, her clear tone, voice
range and rhythmical style have
earned her the title of "Firsl Lady of
Jazz."
The Duke, a world-famous figure
for three decades, was nominated for
a Pulitzer Prize last year.
His innumerable hit compositions,
his unique orchestrations and instru
mental voicings, and his personal abil
ities as a pianist are the most visible
facets of a many-sided personality.
