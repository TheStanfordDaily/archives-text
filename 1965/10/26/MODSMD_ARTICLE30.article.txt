## SCPV 'Track' Questioned 
### 
Editor, The Daily
The Stanford campus has rec
ently been flooded with a tract
authored by the "Stanford Com
mittee for Peace in Vietnam."
I feel compelled to question a
few of its accusations, since
they have been laid before the
Stanford community.
• "Our military forces have
countenanced and committed
countless atrocities against in
dividuals in the form of tor
ture ..." This is a serious
charge. Can the authors of this
factual tract document instan
ces of torture performed by
American troops?
• "They often fail to disting
uish between soldiers and civil
ians." This is a terrible truism
of war. Do the authors of this
tract believe that the bombings
of Nazi Germany in World War
II discimmated between soldiers
and civilians? If not, should
they have been curtailed?
• "They launched and sustain
ed bombing attacks on North
Vict Nam without its being a
participant in the conflict." This
is indeed a remarkable state
ment. Do the authors of this
factual tract deny the entire
credibility of the Stale Depart
ment While Paper, as well as

most news sources commonly
available? If so, what sources
of information do they believe?
• "Our government has estab
lished and maintained oppres
sive and unpopular regimes in
South Viet Nam." How do the
authors of this tract measure
oppression and popularity in an
Asian country? Do they hold
that the Hanoi and Peking re
gimes are benign and popular?
Does history show that a Com
munist regime in South Viet
Nam would be more solicitous
of the general welfare?
• "There has been neither a
declaration of war nor debate
about our policy in Congress."
Are the authors of this factual
tract ignoring opposition state
ments on Viet Nam policy by
S en a to r s Morse, Fulbright.
Church, and Others? Is this de
bate in Congress, and, more im
portantly, debate before the na
tion?
Any one of this tract's oxer
simplifications would be perhaps
insignificant in itself, but in
sum they present a gross (lis
tortion of reality. Certainly the
Stanford community welcomes
the refreshing winds of contro
versy. but it should not be sub
jected to such unsophisticated

propaganda that presumes the
University reader to be an intel-1
leetual bumpkin, unread, unin-'
formed, and unaware of past j
and present history.

• The Wedge
Editor, The Daily:
The Stanford community
must be informed of the pres-1
ence of a new and deadly wea
pon, the epsilon wedge, which is
extremely dangerous, has been ;
bailed in most European coun- ,
tries. However, some epsilon
wedges, still being manufac- j
tu rod in Czechoslovakia and
Luxembourg, are finding their
way into California frim Mexico.
Definite action must be taken 1
to protect Stanford residents
from this dangerous device. Sev- 1
cral weeks ago a young Massa- ;
chusetts mathematics teacher i
was severely beaten by a gang
of teen-agers bearing epsilon j
wedges. It was subsequently
learned that these youths re-1
reived their Wedges through the i
mail. There is some evidence |
that the wedges are coming into :
Palo Alto and Menlo Park. This j
traffic must be stopped.
