# 'Swing Era' Recounted By Hammond
## 
### 
First-hand accounts of recording
sessions with jazz greats Benny Good
man, Count Basic, Teddy Wilson, and
Billy Holiday sparked the fourth lee
lure in the Stanford Jazz Year series.
The "Swing Era" was depicted in
speech and recorded music by John
Hammond, head of talent acquisition
for Columbia Records and Vice
president of Ihe NAACP, yesterday
afternoon in Tresidder Lounge.
Hammond defined the music of the
"Swing Era" as "the development of
improvised small and big band jazz
in the 1930'5." "The 'Swing Era' may
still be with us," he added.
As the discoverer of Benny Good
man. Teddy Wilson, Billy Holliday
and more recently, Bob Dylan, Ham
mond was able to provide his audience
with comments on the circumstances
of the sessions in which many of the
examples he played were recorded.
As a worker in interracial move
ments, he was also concerned with
the prejudice in the 1930's which pre
vented Billy Holliday from completing
a Southern tour with Artie Shaw, and
forced Benny Goodman to record with
an all-white band for fear of losing
his job.
He also described the economic sta
ins of musicians of the era in which
Count Basie's band members* in Kan
sas City averaged $15 per week, and
Basic himself, leader of "the most
exciting and most inventive swinging
band for dancing," earned only $11
per week.
Hammond backed Billy Holliday
when she was an unknown—"As soon
as I heard her, 1 just knew she had
to be the best." And after making
several records for minimum wages
she finally gained recognition as the
"greatest musician • singer of the
1930'5."
Hammond played two Courrt Basic
recordings of "Shoeshinc Boy" sepa
rated by twenty years and performed
by most of the same musicians, which
demonstrated relative permanence of
"swing" jazz as an art form.
Other recordings he played were
jazz "firsts": the first bass viol solo,
and the first appearances of Count
Basic and Billy Holliday on record.
Although he did not include any
Duke Ellington recordings in his lec
ture. Hammond cited him as the lead
er of "the greatest show band and
the greatest band for listening there
ever was."
