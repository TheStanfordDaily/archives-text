# Mackenzie Veto Questioned
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie
yesterday vetoed a $330 appropriation
from the LASSU contingency fund to
the Institute of International Rela
tions (IIR), and stepped into a storm
of controversy over whether his action
was constitutional.
According to Mackenzie and his
presidential assistant, it was consti
tutional; according to LASSLJ Speaker
J;*y I>adane, lIR President Mike Pills
bury, and former LASSU Speaker Ed
Shaw, maybe it wasn't.
UK Delegate's Trip
The appropriation in question,
passed by the Legislature last Thurs
day. would finance the trip of an lIR
delegate to the Conference on the
Atlantic Community, to be held in
Washington, D.C., in mid-November.
Under the ASSU Constitution, the
President is given the power "to veto
any act of the Student Legislature
with the exception of the annual
budget and emergency appropria
tions. provided thai he shall exercise
such power of veto within two days
after the act is passed."
Since tin 1 weekend does not count
as part of the "two days," the parties
are in agreement that Mackenzie's
veto meets the time requirement.
The point of contention is over
whether LASSU's action constituted
an "emergency appropriation."
Shaw's Opinion
In the opinion of former Legislature
Speaker and former Student Financial
Manager Shaw. "The Legislature, by
definition, whenever spending oul of
the contingency fund, is making an
emergency appropriation."
Shaw cited Article Section 1. Sub
section D of the ASSU Bylaws, which
reads:
"The Legislature shall . . . pass an
operating budget in which every
ASSU-supported organization (e.g. the
lIR J is allocated a fixed sum of money
for its activities, with the understand
ing that nothing further will be ap
propriated during the ensuing year,
save in the event of an extraordinary
emergency."
Emergency Appropriation
Mackenzie disagreed. He told The
Daily last night that the By-laws do
not "clearly define 'emergency appro
priation'." "There can be no doubt
that in actuality, appropriations such
as this and many others cannot be
realistically viewed as 'extraordinary
emergencies'," he said. "I don't con
sider this to be an emergency appro
priation. To do so would he to make
a legalistic farce of the word 'emerg
ency'. My veto is clearly legal."
Speaker of Legislature Kadane re
fused to commit himself last night,
except to say that the ASSU provi
sions "as they stand are open (o more
than one interpretation."
"The Legislature will have to decide
upon the constitutionality of the
veto," lie stated.
Under the ASSU Constitution,

LASSU has the power to interpret
both the Const il lit ion and the Bylaws,

111 l President Pillsbury claimed bit
terly that "neither Mackenzie nor his
friends" are "aware of all the facts."
"He's wrong on this. He does not

have the right to veto an appropria
tion of this sort," he said.
Skip Martin, executive assistant to
Mackenzie, told The Daily last night.
"If the Legislature rules this veto il
legal. there will no longer exist even
a pretense ol a balance of power in

the ASSU. The president would have
the power to veto only resolutions
legislation of minor consequence com
pared to Bylaws changes and finan
cial appropriations. The Legislature
would then have virtually unchecked
powers."

with the exception of the annual
budget and emergency appropria
tions. provided thai he shall exercise
such power of veto within two days
after the act is passed."
Since tin 1 weekend does not count
as part of the "two days," the parties
are in agreement that Mackenzie's
veto meets the time requirement.
The point of contention is over
whether LASSU's action constituted
an "emergency appropriation."
Shaw's Opinion
In the opinion of former Legislature
Speaker and former Student Financial
Manager Shaw. "The Legislature, by
definition, whenever spending oul of
the contingency fund, is making an
emergency appropriation."
Shaw cited Article Section 1. Sub
section D of the ASSU Bylaws, which
reads:
"The Legislature shall . . . pass an
operating budget in which every
ASSU-supported organization (e.g. the
lIR J is allocated a fixed sum of money
for its activities, with the understand
ing that nothing further will be ap
propriated during the ensuing year,
save in the event of an extraordinary
emergency."
Emergency Appropriation
Mackenzie disagreed. He told The
Daily last night that the By-laws do
not "clearly define 'emergency appro
priation'." "There can be no doubt
that in actuality, appropriations such
as this and many others cannot be
realistically viewed as 'extraordinary
emergencies'," he said. "I don't con
sider this to be an emergency appro
priation. To do so would he to make
a legalistic farce of the word 'emerg
ency'. My veto is clearly legal."
Speaker of Legislature Kadane re
fused to commit himself last night,
except to say that the ASSU provi
sions "as they stand are open (o more
than one interpretation."
"The Legislature will have to decide
upon the constitutionality of the
veto," lie stated.
Under the ASSU Constitution,

LASSU has the power to interpret
both the Const il lit ion and the Bylaws,

111 l President Pillsbury claimed bit
terly that "neither Mackenzie nor his
friends" are "aware of all the facts."
"He's wrong on this. He does not

have the right to veto an appropria
tion of this sort," he said.
Skip Martin, executive assistant to
Mackenzie, told The Daily last night.
"If the Legislature rules this veto il
legal. there will no longer exist even
a pretense ol a balance of power in

the ASSU. The president would have
the power to veto only resolutions
legislation of minor consequence com
pared to Bylaws changes and finan
cial appropriations. The Legislature
would then have virtually unchecked
powers."
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie
yesterday vetoed a $330 appropriation
from the LASSU contingency fund to
the Institute of International Rela
tions (IIR), and stepped into a storm
of controversy over whether his action
was constitutional.
According to Mackenzie and his
presidential assistant, it was consti
tutional; according to LASSLJ Speaker
J;*y I>adane, lIR President Mike Pills
bury, and former LASSU Speaker Ed
Shaw, maybe it wasn't.
