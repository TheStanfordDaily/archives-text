# HELPING OTHERS
## VISTA Seeks Recruits 
### DICK LIVINGSTON 
VISTA, Volunteers in Service to
America, is looking for students who
are interested in helping the poor to
help themselves. The organization,
founded last year as part of President
Johnson's war on poverty, has an in
formation table opposite Mem Claw
in White Plaza.
With 1100 volunteers in 12 states,
VISTA works in urban slums, in re
gions of rural poverty, with migrant
workers, on Indian reservations, and
with the mentally retarded.
Roots of Problem
"Volunteers look for the roots uf
problems, and by living and working
with the people involved help them
solve their own problems without de
pending on welfare agencies." Mary
Concannon, VISTA recruiter, ex
plained.
Volunteers are trafned for six weeks
in conditions similar lo those in which

thoy will bo working. They serve for
one year with the option to continue.
A cost of living allowance permits vol
unteers to live at the same level as the
people they are working with. Males
are deferred from the draft for their
period of service.
Work with Community
The program directly attacks the
problem of school dropouts by provid
ing tutorial help for students from
culturally deprived families. Volun
teers also work with parents to create
a better home atmosphere.
VISTA must be invited to a com
munity by a sponsor who wants to
improve existing conditions. Most vol
unteers work extensively with a small
number of cases.
The most important qualification
for VISTA is the desire to help others.
The ability to got along with people
of a different background is also im
portant. Most of the volunteers have

college experience, although it is not
required.
"The job may not be glamourous in
the usual sense of the word, but it is
glamourous when you consider its
long range effect. 1 think it is import
ant. that you can help a student com
plete high school and go on to a use
ful life." Miss Concannon stated.
The ultimate goal of VISTA is to
eliminate the need for such an agency.
Until that time, volunteers seek to
train people from poor areas to return
and help their neighbors. This ap
proach will help to eliminate the prob
lem of the difficulty of cultural ad
just ment.
A movie showing VISTA at work in
areas of poverty will be shown today.
Wednesday and Friday at 1 p.m. in
room 275, Tresidder Union. Thurs
day's showing will be in 271 TMU.

day's showing will be in 271 TMU.
VISTA, Volunteers in Service to
America, is looking for students who
are interested in helping the poor to
help themselves. The organization,
founded last year as part of President
Johnson's war on poverty, has an in
formation table opposite Mem Claw
in White Plaza.
With 1100 volunteers in 12 states,
VISTA works in urban slums, in re
gions of rural poverty, with migrant
workers, on Indian reservations, and
with the mentally retarded.
Roots of Problem
"Volunteers look for the roots uf
problems, and by living and working
with the people involved help them
solve their own problems without de
pending on welfare agencies." Mary
Concannon, VISTA recruiter, ex
plained.
Volunteers are trafned for six weeks
in conditions similar lo those in which

thoy will bo working. They serve for
one year with the option to continue.
A cost of living allowance permits vol
unteers to live at the same level as the
people they are working with. Males
are deferred from the draft for their
period of service.
Work with Community
The program directly attacks the
problem of school dropouts by provid
ing tutorial help for students from
culturally deprived families. Volun
teers also work with parents to create
a better home atmosphere.
VISTA must be invited to a com
munity by a sponsor who wants to
improve existing conditions. Most vol
unteers work extensively with a small
number of cases.
The most important qualification
for VISTA is the desire to help others.
The ability to got along with people
of a different background is also im
portant. Most of the volunteers have

college experience, although it is not
required.
"The job may not be glamourous in
the usual sense of the word, but it is
glamourous when you consider its
long range effect. 1 think it is import
ant. that you can help a student com
plete high school and go on to a use
ful life." Miss Concannon stated.
The ultimate goal of VISTA is to
eliminate the need for such an agency.
Until that time, volunteers seek to
train people from poor areas to return
and help their neighbors. This ap
proach will help to eliminate the prob
lem of the difficulty of cultural ad
just ment.
A movie showing VISTA at work in
areas of poverty will be shown today.
Wednesday and Friday at 1 p.m. in
room 275, Tresidder Union. Thurs
day's showing will be in 271 TMU.
