## Cohen Explains Low Motivations 
### JACK TRINKLINE 
Professor Bernard Cohen of Stan
ford's Department of Sociology high
lighted Tresidder Memorial Union's
second lecture in Ihe "Prejudice:
Viewpoint" series last night with a
talk on his views toward the subject
in the large lounge.
Hr. Cohen, as assistant professor of
sociology, contended that Negro aspi
rations arc generally low because of
a four point cycle: 1 i Negroes highly
evaluate whites; 2i they know whites
place them in an inferior status; 3)
they accept their status; I) and be
cause of this acceptance, Negroes
generate low aspirations and motiva
tions. which influence white opinion.
The more established historical cv
planations of antr bcllitm slavery and

lack u| educational opportunity were
quickly dismissed. "It is not simply a
matter of removing the bars to
achievement," Dr. Cohen stated.
He cited a Newsweek survey which
determined that the goals highly val
ued by the white community were al
so equally highly held by the Negroes.
Another point of support which he
cited was the sale of hair straighten
ers and skin bleach to Negroes.
Both white and Negro children were
placed in a test situation, he contin
ued, and each was to choose a doll
resembling a person who they would
most like to become. The children of
hoth colors preferred white to black
dolls.
Dr. Cohn cited another Newsweek
poll in demonstrating his second
point Invariable' over fifty percent ol

the whites questioned thought Ne
groes inferior to whites in some re
spect. The questions ranged from do
mestic cleanliness to moral behavior.
Black acceptance of white goals was
equally re-enforced with a succession
of sociological experiments and sta
tistics.
Four man work teams consisting of
two whites and two Negroes were
organized and run through a variety
of activities. After completion of the
activities they were told to evaluate
their performance; Negroes consis
tently rated the tasks performed In
their while teammates as superior.
"We will find it valuable to question
our own motives and approaches. We
must work on white beliefs about
Negroes as well as on legal bars."
Cohen -;aicl in conclusion.
