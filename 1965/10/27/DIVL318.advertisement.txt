How To Find Yourself
i
If you are among the many loohnq for something more in life, searching
j perhaps for a sense of personal identity or puipose for living in a materialistic •
j age, the God of the Bible has good news for you. Quoting the Old Testament
| Jesus Christ once said, Man shall net iive by bread alone but by every word |
| that proceeds from the mouth of God (Matthew 4:4). Indeed the findings of
! modern psychology have shown that man is an emotional and spiritual being
all too often suffering from guilt, repression and a sense of inadequacy. Even i
[ those who succeed often feel they ought to be more than they are, because i
of unmet spiritual needs.
Nov/ a light bulb can not successfully glow cut off from the current, ancl |
i the finest of plants will die without wafer. It is no coincidence to such analogies |
| that Jesus Christ is called the Light of the World and the Water of Life, as well i
as the Shepherd of the Sheep and Bread of Life. God has made us dependent 1
creatures designed to rely upon the One who said, "I am the Way, the Truth
and the Life" (John 14:6).
A little time in the Bible soon convinces the sincere that Jesus Christ is the
only real Person in all the universe- that human beings find their identity and
their fulfillment only in him. In a changing world millions have found that Jesus
Christ more than fills that inner void and satisfies a desire to be oneself. Thus
in simplest terms, a man who finds Jesus Christ as Lord finds himself.
In a world where there are lots of wrong answers and many blind alleys
the Bible urges men everywhere to turn to their Creator for the answers which
work and the way which satisfies. . . . See to it that no one makes a prey of
you by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according i
1 to the elemental spirits of the universe and not according to Christ. For in !
him all the fullness of deity dwells bodily, and you have come to fullness of \
life in him who is the head of all rule and authority. (Colossians 2:9-10).
Why be an incomplete person when Jesus Ch'rist stands ready to make you
a whole man in a broken world?
