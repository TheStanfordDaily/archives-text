TWELVE IS A MANY-SPLENDORED THING
Today I begin my twelfth year of writing this column in
your campus newspaper.
These dozen years have passed like a dozen minutes. In
fact, 1 would not believe so much time has gone by except
that I have my wife nearby as a handy reference. When I
started this column, she was a mere slip of a girl—supple as
a willow bough and fair as the morn. Today she is gnarled,
lumpy, and given to biting the postman. Still, I count my
self lucky. Most of my friends who were married at the same
time have wives who chase cars all day. I myself have never
had this trouble, and I attribute my good fortune to the
fact that I have never struck my wife with my hand. 1 have
always used a folded newspaper, even during the prolonged
newspaper strike of 1961 in New York. During this journal
less period 1 had the airmail edition of the Manchester Guard
ian flown in daily from England. I mast admit, however,
that it was not entirely satisfactory. The airmail edition of
the Guardian is printed on paper so light and flimsy that it
makes very little impression when one smacks one's wife.
Mine, in fact, thought it was some kind of game and tore
several pairs of my trousers.
But 1 digress. For twelve years, I say, I have been writ
ing this column. That is a fact, and here is another: I shave
every morning with Personna Stainless Steel Blades. I bring
up Personna Stainless Steel Blades because this column is
sponsored by the makers of Personna and they are inclined
to brood if I omit to mention their products.

Not, let me hasten to state, that it is any chore for me to
sing the praises of Personna —as you will agree once you try
this sharpest, smoothest-shaving, longest-lasting blade ever
devised by the makers of Personna Blades—now available
both in Double Edge and Injector style. Personna, always
the most rewarding of blades, today offers even an extra re
ward—a chance to grab yourself a fistful of $100 bills from
a $100,000 bowl! The Personna Stainless Steel Sweepstakes
is off and running, and you're all eligible to enter. Visit your
friendly Personna dealer soon to pick up an entry blank
(void where prohibited by law).
And, by the way, while you're at your friendly Personna
dealers, why don't you ask for a can of Burma Shave? It
comes in Regular or Menthol; it soaks rings around any
other lather, and it's made by the makers of Personna.
But I digress. For twelve years, I say, this column has
been discussing, forthrightly and fearlessly, such burning
campus questions as "Should students be allowed to attend
first-hour classes in pajamas?" and "Should deans be re
tired at age 25?" and "Should foreign exchange students be
held for ransom?".
Today, continuing the tradition, we take up the thorniest
academic problem of all: the high cost of tuition. Let me
tell you how one student, Lintel Sigafoos by name, solved
this problem.
Lintel, while still a boy in Straitened Circumstances,
Idaho, had his heart set on college, but, alas, he couldn't
afford the tuition. He applied for a Regents Scholarship
but, alas, his reading speed was not very rapid—only two
words an hour—and before he finished even the first page
of his exam, the Regents had closed their briefcases crossly
and gone home. Lintel then applied for an athletic scholar
ship, but he had, alas, only a single athletic skill —balancing
an ice cream cone on his chin—and this, alas, aroused only
fleeting enthusiasm among the coaches.
And then he found the answer: he would get a student
loan! Of course, he would have to pay it back after gradua
tion, but clever Lintel solved that, too: he kept changing
his major, never accumulating enough credits to graduate
until lie was 65 years old. Then he repaid the loan out of his
Social Security.
