# Stanford Sailing Club Aground
## 
### LINDSAY MERRYMAN JOHN BUZAN 
An unlikely combination of
ferns and sewers have run the
Stanford Sailing Club aground,
and club members now find
themselves in the awkward posi
tion of having:
Lakes, lakes everywhere;
But hardly a place for a
sloop.
The whole problem began last
year when a variety of fresh
water fern was found encroach
ing onto the surface of campus
Lake Lagunita. Up to that time
the club had used the lake as
its traditional haven.
Due to the onslaught of
weeds, however, the sailors
weighed anchor and moved to
nearby Lake Vasona for the re
mainder of the season.
Booklet Sent
During the summer an execu
tive of California Chemical
Company wrote to the club of
fering "New ORTHO Diquat" as
a possible cure for the Lagunita
weed problem.
"We are enclosing herewith a
booklet describing New ORTHO
Diquat Weed Killer," the execu
tive wrote. "You will note that ,
not only is this a most effective
weed killer, but it does not harm
fish and the waters can be used
for swimming ten days after
application."
Unfortunately, objections to
the use of "New ORTHO Diquat
Weed Killer" came rapidly. Ac
cording to the Biology Depart
ment, the ferns in Lake Lag are
the only cultivation of their
variety in the western hemi
sphere—making them somewhat
unique.
Must B«> Saved
And Diquat produces "a very
fast killing action."
The Biology Department was |
adamant. The only living sped-;
mens of a fern in the western
hemisphere cann o t .just be I
stamped out.
Having lost the battle to the |
weeds that choked up Lag from j
March to dry-up time in sum- j
mer, the Sailing Club resigned
itself to continuing use of Lake j
Vasona, a half-hour drive from J
campus.
This would have been normal !
during the dry season of sum
mer and fall, anyway.
Sailing Club President Bruce j
Wright said. "Actually, I'd rath-1
er sail on Lake Vasona any day. 1
Besides being three times bigger
than Lag it has a launching area j
and complete recreational facili- !
ties." In spite of the inconveni-'
ence of a ceaseless car-pool, the j
club was thinking of making it '
a regular haven.
However, the county of Santa
Clara decided to put a sewer un
der the lake. They lowered the :

level by four feet.
Not enough.
The next day they pulled the
plug. Now Lake Vasona is as
dry as Lake Lag.
Need Location
"For now," said president
Wright, "no sailing will be pos
sible. If the Sailing Club cannot
find another location while the
sewer work is going on, its
members will get a rebate on
their club dues."
Santa Clara authorities claim
that the lake will be full again
in a little more than a month.
In the meantime, alternative
sailing areas have been consid
ered, either on a temporary ba
sis or permanently.
Some Possibilities
San Francisco Bay would be
ideal providing the club had u
paying membership of S(H) to
cover the costs of a patrol boat,
a launching ramp, and a boat
shelter.
Sailing out of Redwood City
would be too expensive for even
a paying membership, the club
decided at an October 13th meet
ing.
Palo Alto's "sea-front" for the

Ix'tter part of the year is a mud
flat.
"One of the things which is
being looked into as a possible
solution," noted Wright, "is the
early filling of Lag right after
the Bonfire."
This is a desperate, temporary
measure at best, however.
At the moment, then, Stall
lord has an active Sailing Club,
with boats and plenty of mem
bers -but no water.
Between the ferns, the dry
ups, and the havoc of finding a
new haven the Stanford Sail
ing Club is sailing on dry land.
