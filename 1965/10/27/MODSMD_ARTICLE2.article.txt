## 
### 
A British journalist and a former
member of Parliament told an audi
ence in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
night that Prime Minister Harold
Wilson's Labor Party would probably
not have given the United States its
loyal support of current policy in
Vietnam were it presently not in
power.
Christopher Mollis, speaking on
"The British Political Situation" at
the Tuesday Evening Series, cited sev
eral superficial differences between
the Conservative and Labor parties,
but concluded thai there is a "very
even balance" between the two and
that there is "very little difference
between what they do."
He included among these differ
ences the respective policies of the
two parties toward immigration, na
tionalization of steel, and education.
Mollis predicted that if there were
another election this year. Labor
would obtain a larger majority than
it now has. The principal reason, he
said, is that the people, bored after
thirteen years of Conservative rule,
are willing to give Labor a chance to
demonstrate what it can do.
