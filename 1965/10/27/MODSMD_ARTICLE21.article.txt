# Bliven Calls Appeasement Failure Of Will
## 
### 
"Appeasement is folly, wheth
er internal or external . . . The
overwhelming fact is that there
is no such thing as a safe, small
amount of anti-demooracy that
can be tolerated without dan
ger . •
So notes Bruce Bliven, a re
nowned author, Stanford alum
nus, and communication lectur
er, in his newest book "The
World Changers" published this
week in New York by the John
Day Co.
His book is an analysis of the
eight men who played major
roles in shaping today's world—
Roosevelt, Churchill, Gandhi,
Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, Chiang
Kai-Shek, and Emperor Hiro
hito.
In all Fascist countries, Bliven
points out, "it was a failure of
will by the forces in opposition
ihat allowed ihe totalitarians to
come to power. At first they
were tolerated; by the time the
danger had been realized, it was
—or seemed to be—to late."
Concerning colonial powers,
he notes thai they would he
making larger profits today "if
they had sought the good will
of their subject peoples, edu
cated them, raised their standard
of living, and then traded willi
them as independent equals."
Their failure to do this has
brought about the growing na
tionalism of the newly independ
ent nations, he adds, and "is the
most revolutionary change in
human psychology in all his
tory. . ."
Bliven writes that the world
agonies of the past 30 years
might never have happened if
those who should have shouted
"no!" had done it.and the Com
munists and Fascists hadn't fol
lowed their self-delusions into
disaster.
