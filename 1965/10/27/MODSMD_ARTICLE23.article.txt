# Mem Aud Called Hazard
## 
### 
A fire-extinguishing sprinkler
system for the main stage and
lit He theater at Memorial Audi
torium will be installed during
the next two months by the
University in compliance with
stale fire regulations.
An inspection by the Santa
Clara county fire marshal
showed Mem Aud deficient in
this safety device as well as hav
ing some minor fire hazards.
These hazards were described as
extension cords used unsafely
and overheating in the KZSU
studio and have since been tak
en care of, but the University
has been given two months to
install the sprinklers.
Mem Aud was built in the
1930's before any county or local
fire regulations bul came under
control of the county fire mar
shal when such regulations were i
passed in 1946.
