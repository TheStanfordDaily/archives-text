# Phi Delts Romp In Third Mural Week
## 
### JOHN CALMORE 
After three weeks of intra
mural grid action, most league
races are still pretty tight. The
Phi Delts loosened League Three
a little, however, when they
romped over Chi Psi 10-6, win
ning their third game in as
many tries.
Unleashing a potent air at
tack, the Phi Delts led by Quar
terback Pat Concannon, scored
at will. The Phi Delt defense,
starring Jeff Thigpen, Ernie
Kroener, Tom Congoran, Bill
Nordskog, and Happy Klopp.
gave up its first touchdown of
the year, having previously
turned in shutouts of 6-0 and
27-0.
It just doesn't look like Chi

Psis' year: an earlier contest
last week, the DlJ's belted them
38-7. Bill Twist was thp big gun
in the DU offensive, running for
two louehflowns and passing for
ihe others. His main targets
were Ray Hunter and Steve Za
mora. In spite of the big score
the DU's were probably looking
past this game. One DU in
formed, "Next week we play the
Betas for a keg."
Soto Atop
Emerging from tho freshman
scramble, Soto took over the
league lead as they won their
third straight, downing Arroyo
12-0. Soto scored on a 30-yard
run by Mike Alverado and on a
pass from John Haxo and Jack
Willis. Pushing Soto is Arroyo,
also undefeated with a 2-0 rec
ord.
Among the eating clubs, Los
Arcos appears the team to beat.
Los Arcos whipped El Capitan
in its first game by a 12-0 mar
gin, and followed with another
shutout, 6-0, over El Tigre last
week. Engineering I lie touch
down were passer, Mike Will
iams and receiver, Joel Mills.
101 Cap Stymied
In another club contest, Cam
po beat El Capitan 12-0. The
passing and catching of John
Murray was too much for El
Capitan. Murray scored twice,
once on a pass play from Gene
De Mar, and again on a 50-yard
pass to Jim Williams.
The passing arm of Joe Meul
leur kept Muir on top in the
Stern League, as he threw for
two scores in Mail's 13-0 victory
over Serra. Defending Stern
Champion Fremont hit Lassen
for a 20-14 win. And defending
University Champion Sigma Chi
continued to play its role, edg
ing the Delts 14-12 and rolling
over Alpha Sig 34 0.
