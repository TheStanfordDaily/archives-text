EAST LANDING, Mich. (Al'» Everyone trios to knock off
No. 1.
And Coach Duffy Daugherty, who led Michigan Stale to the
top spot in The Associated Press college football poll this week
after a victory over highly rated Purdue, is painfully aware of this.

Daugherty led the Spartans
the leading spot three times in
the past. Each time MSU was
toppled from its lofty pedestal
by stunning upsets.
The Spartans became the new
No. 1 team after rallying for a
14-1 D victory over Purdue, the
team that earlier had upset
Notre Dame.
It was a close vote between
Michigan Stale and undefeated
Arkansas. Only seven points
separated them with unbeaten
Nebraska clinging to third. Ar
kansas beat North Texas State
55-20.
Arkansas oulscored Michigan
State in first place votes, 23 to
19, among the 51 sports writers
and broadcasters but the Spar
tans led in points, 473-466. Points
are given on the basis of 10 for
a first place vote, nine for sec
ond, etc.
Notre Dame, which crushed
Southern California 28-7, moved
from seventh to fourth. Others
in the Top Ten, in order, are
Louisiana State, Purdue, Flori
da, Southern Cal. Texas and Ala
bama.
