# The 						Death Of Student Drama
## 
### 
(Ed. Note: This editorial was first published
last spring, when Joseph Jacobs was The Daily a
Fine Arts Editor and the Repertory Theater was
barely a reality. Since then, the Nitery has been
"remodeled"; otherwise, conditions remain
much the same, and his observations are as
pertinent now as they were then. In order to
preserve the editorial's integrity, we reprint it
in its original form.)
Amid all the fanfare surrounding the an
nouncement of the professional repertory thea
ter to be established at Stanford next fall, one
very important point has been conveniently for
gotten:
Very simply, the repertory theater will quite
probably mean the death of student drama—
specifically undergraduate drama—at Stanford.
Let us examine the facts:
The repertory theater will present five pro
ductions in Memorial Auditorium—three on
Main Stage (one each quarter) and two in
Little Theatre (one at the end of fall quarter
and one at the start of spring).
These productions will use a company of ten
professional senior actors plus graduate stu
dents who are in their final year of preparation
for their Master of Fine Arts.
To compensate for this casting, Robert Loper
—executive head of the Speech and Drama De
partment—has promised three productions a
year which will cast onh undergraduates.
This sounds fine, until one realizes that these
three productions will be in the Nitery, a large
room in the Old Union that—equipped with
fifty chairs and a few lights—is jokingly referred
to as a theater. It is indeed a challenge for any
student to work in the Nitery, but the experi
ence one can gain there is minimal at best.
But the main victim of the repertory theater
will be Rain s Head, Stanford's entireh student
ruju dramatic organization. Ram s Head will still
do "Gaieties' each fall; "Gaieties is too much
oPa tradition to dare try to change. This fall the
repertory theater, after four and a half weeks
of rehearsal on Main Stage, will debut its initial
production October 27. Rams Head, which will
rehearse wherever it can find space, will move
in November 7—the day after the repertory pro
duction closes—and will have nine days of re
hearsal onstage before opening November i(i
Winter One Acts, the one consistent source of
original student drama, seems hopelessly lost.
Shunted from its traditional home in Little The
atre to the Nitery this year as a result of the
Stanford Players'"The Possessed," even the Nit
ery will apparently be denied it next year in
order to accomodate the promised undergrad
uate shows. (It is possible, of course, that the
Speech and Drama Department will simply
consider W inter One Acts one of it undergrad
uate shows; such a "generous" concession
letting Ram's Head do W inter One Acts—would
relieve the Department of the burdens of one
production.)

Spring Show will become a thing of the past.
Stephen Baffrcy, producer of the repertory the
ater, said in a Daily interview last week that
Rains Head has "been asked to step aside in
some respects to help us, but we all feel very
close to Ram's Head. The benefits are so
obvious, though, that Ram's Head can't help but
gain."
Exactly what benefits Ram's Head will gain
from not being able to do a Spring Show on
Main Stage are dubious. Frost has been sug
gested as an alternative but, due to the reper
tory tlieater's schedule, the only possible time
would be the first weekend in May, and anyone
who went to the Henry Mancini concert a few
weeks ago knows that Frost can get pretty
chilly for the darling buds of May.
Thus Ram s Head will find itsell producing
only one show—'"Gaieties'"—each year. W hen
one realizes that Richard Hay, who will be the
repertory theater's designer, first got experience
designing Ram's Head shows as an undergrad
uate; when one realizes that Warner Leßoy,
who produced "Tehin-Tchin" on Broadway,
gained experience directing three consecutive
Spring Show s, one understands the importance
of Ram's Head as a training ground.
In a sense, this is only a part of Stanford's
traditional problem of whether to emphasize
graduate or undergraduate education. The
Speech and Drama Department, with its estab
lishment of the repertory theater and the MFA
program, has obviously chosen the latter. And
there is no doubt but that the few students
working for their MFA will gain immensely
from the repertory theater.
But what of the Department's undergradu
ates, who have always been able to work with
graduate students in Stanford Players produc
tions? Indeed, working only in undergraduate
productions in the Nitery, will they be prepared
upon graduation to enter a program like Stan
ford's?
What of the students (often IN the Speech
and Drama Department) for whom Ram's Head
has provided their only chance to direct, w rite
and design while undergraduates?
And what of the students who just came
down to the shop to help paint sets one night a
week for Ram s Head—just to be a part ot the
show, any show?
Students can not learn drama simply by read
ing plays or by performing scenes in class or
by watching professionals rehearse and per
form. Students must have the chance to act,
direct, write and design for a live audience;
they must have the chance to make their own
mistakes—to try—and to learn even when they
fail.
If the repertory theater, in spite of all its
noble aims, denies this opportunity to Stanford
students, it will be too bad for the students and
ultimately, too bad for drama.
