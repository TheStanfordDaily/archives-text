# MACKENZIE'S STATEMENT
## A 						Veto And A Bylaws Change 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following*
is a statement by ASSU Presi
dent Sandy Mackenzie concern
ing his veto of a LASSU appro
priation to the nK. Story,
I'age 1.)
The veto of Bill 63-6-11, Ap
propriations for the Conference
Oil the Atlantic Community, in
volves two issues which should
not be confused. The first is that
of the appropriation of $330 to
allow a student, representing
the lIR, to attend the conference
at Georgetown University in the
middle of next month. There is
fairly general agreement that
this appropriation was hastily
passed by the Legislature be
cause of the pressure of an ex
tremely full agenda, and should
have received more attention.
The question of the appropria
tion is itself important and
should not be prejudiced by t he
second issue, that of the legality
of the veto. The veto was orig
inally applied in order to assure
that the appropriation received
proper .attention. II is part of the
duty el the L'xceutiu Branch to
jiifcure that ASSU money is t>pent
refpon«ib!y and th?t imr>or*nnt

considerations do not get over
looked in the rush of legislative
business.
The real problem arises over
the legality of the veto. The
ASSU Constitution declares (Ar
ticle 11, 2, j) that it is one of the
powers of the President "to veto
any act of the tSudent Legisla
ture with the exception of the
annual budget and emergency
appropriations." The By-Laws
state (Article V, 4, D) in rela
tion to the subject of budgets
"The Legislature shall then pass
an operating budget in which
every ASSU supported organiza
tion is allocated a fixed stun of
money for its activities, with the
understanding that nothing fur
ther will be appropriated during
the ensuing year save in the
event of extraordinary emerg
ency."
We are not dealing here with
statements of equal weight. The
Constitution is antecedent and
superior to the By-Laws. The
IJv Law here confuses the sit
u M.km jc outlined in th<j Consti
tution, by seeming to include all
'Tri"opri? f icns on f sidc of ♦he an

nual budget as emergency ap
propriations.
In order to clarify the matter
of vetoes I will propose the fol
lowing By-Law change at Thurs
day's Legislature meeting:
RU LES GOVERN ING VETOES
I. Amend the By-Laws by addi
tion to Article 11, to read as
follows:
Section 6: "vetoes"
1. Provisions for Notification
a. If the President wishes to
veto a legislative action, ho
shall notify in writing, the
Speaker of his veto and the
reasons for it, within forty
eight. hours of the time of
adjournment of the meeting
at. which the bill was passed.
b. The Speaker shall report
the veto to the Legislature
at its next regular or spec
ial meeting, and a motion to
override the veto shall be in
order at that time.
2. Vetoes of Appropriations
a. In the constitutional provis
ion for presidential vetoes,
<i!i "emergency appropria
tion ' shall be construed as
an aprrrrriatior which

could not achieve the pur
pose of t ho expenditure if it
were vetoed and the veto
overridden at the next reg
ular meeting of the Legis
lature.
b. The Finance Committee
shall recommend to the Leg
islature which appropria
tions it considers to be
"emergency appropriations,"
and which "non-emergency."
2. Amend the By-Laws by
addition to Article TIT, Sec
tion 8 A 3, a paragraph to
read as follows:
d. The Finance Committee
shall recommend to the Leg
islature which appropria
tions it considers to be
"emergency appropriations,"
which "non-emergency."
Tn order to assure that the
matter of the appropriation re
ceives the proper consideration
apart from the question of the
By-Laws revision, I will with
draw my veto and move at the
conclusion of my report to Iho
Legislature to suspend the Ilules
v liicli " oul-J ordinarily prevent
the Legislature irojn reconsider
in * the appropriation
