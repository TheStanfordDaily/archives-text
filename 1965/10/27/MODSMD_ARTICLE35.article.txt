## Religion Series Praised; Editorial In 'Poor Taste' 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily is to be congratu
lated for its excellent series by
Bruce Campbell on the on-eam
pits worship question. However,
was there reason for the tone of
the editorial on the same sub
ject? Such phrases as "we
strongly urge the committee to
heed this petition;" "The result
ing report was supposedly con
sidered . . "He . . . cannot
deny student concern . . ."
seemed in poor taste.
Many of us who are in favor
of various reforms are con
cerned that more is lost by that
kind of impoliteness than is
gained by the reform.
In areas of disagreement in
the Stanford community polite
address and regard might not
only be more successful but
would reduce conflict and make
all our lives more pleasant.
RONALD SMITH
Ed. Note: Pardon our "impolite
ness" in prodding the bureau
cracy; alter all, it's only been
two years since the question of
religious freedom on this cam
pus was brought up.
Yest 'day.the Religious Af
fairs (. nvnittee considered the
A S S l"'s petition for student
ni< ml)ers!iip on the Committee.
T'v y did not make their deci
sion public, pending' the return
of President Sterling in about
three weeks. Last year, they did
make some "interim recommen
dations" hut the Board of Trus
tees has not had any formal
presentations on the religious
situation.
• 'Tract' Defended
Editor, The Daily:
In yesterday's Daily, Mr. Paul
Randau takes issue with the
SCPV's "tract" on five points of
fact. He goes on to accuse its
authors of "oversimplification"
and a "gross distortion of real
ity." "Such unsophisticated
propaganda" lie says, "presumes
the University reader to be an
intellectual bumpkin, unread,
uninformed and unaware of
past and present history."
As debate about the war con
tinues to polarize the nation,
even the most patent facts are
called into question. Each of the
sentences lie cites in his letter
is taken from a single para
graph explaining why a large
part of our commitment is mor
al rather than political, why we
decided therefore to express our
outrage with the gesture of a
Witness.
Mr. Randau asks us to docu
ment instances of the "serious

charge" we make that "our mili
tary forces have countenanced
and committed countless atroc
ities against individuals in the
form oi' torture and indiscrimi
nate killing." In the New Re
public of October 9th, Bernard'
Fall describes our B-52 satura-:
tion bombing of areas of the j
Mekong Delta with population j
density of over 1000 people per
square mile. For instances of!
torture countenanced by Ameri-1
can troops. I need only refer Mr. j
Randan to the famous series of |
photographs published in news
papers all over the country last
spring, portraying American
troops slaiading by smoking and
grilling while their South Viet-j
namesp "advisees" performed
water tortures, mutilation and
electrocution of prisoners.
Official American military pol
icy has been "to disapprove" of i
these physical methods of tor
ture, mainly because they are J
found to be ineffectual. Mr. Ran
dan implies that American
troops themselves never have
and will not in the future en
gage in torture. I call his atten
tion to an article in this week's
(October 25) Nation magazine,
entitled "Once You've Broken
Him Down," a transcript of a
taped interview with an Ameri
can Special Forces Officer now
in charge of "brainwashing"
Vietcong prisoners. The officer
says:
We will not get the informa
tion we need by physical torture.
We've got to get it by mental !
and emotional torture . . . I ,
don't make any moral clistinc-;
tion at all |betwen physical and
mental torture 1 torture is tor-1
ture and when you mess around
with a guy's mind and his whole ,
underlying raison d'etre, you're
really hurting him.
Mr. Randau accepts as "a ter-1
rible truism of war" the neces-;
sity of failing to discriminatej
between soldiers and civilians.
This necessity certainly has not !
been a truism in all wars, only
in the most inhuman and savage
wars. Perhaps, as Mr. Randau's
thinking suggests, it is becom- J
ing a truism after London, Stal
ingrad, Dresden, Hiroshima, and j
Nagasaki. Atrocities are atro- {
cious no matter who commits j
them. Why must we accept i
these nightmares as legitimat
ing precedents?
"Do the authors of this fac
tual tract deny ihe entire credi
bility of the State Department '
White Paper . . ." which served
as the moral .justification of our j
bombing of North Vietnam, j
asks Mr. Randau. The White
Paper sought to prove that
Nor th Vic t. na m supplied,
manned, and controlled the Na-,
tional Liberation Front by ad
ducing pages of pages of "evi
dence." As has been shown
merely by a careful examination
of the text ef the White Paper
itself, out of 15,100 weapons cap
tured from the Vietcong in the (
period from June 1962 to Janu-!
ary 190"). only 179 were stamped '
with Communist insignia. Al-j
most all of the rest of the weap
ons were made in the United
States, and originally captured -
from our own and South Viet-;
namese troops.
Mr. Randau wishes to know
"what sources of information
they [SCVP] believe?" Despite |
the efforts of government offi- j
cials and controllers of the mass
media to suppress dissenting ,
views on the Vietnam War as
"traitorous," there remain ave- j
nties for the dissemination of
disinterested reports and opin- {
ions. 1 urge Mr. Randau to read
articles in the British and !
French press, especially the Lon
don Times, Le Monde, L'Ex
press, and in American journals
such as The Nation, The New
Republic, The New York Review,
and Dissent, and to listen to the
news and commentaries on sta
tion KPFA-FM. Berkeley. Even
a careful reading of the Chron
icle fh£ New York Times
will prove our points.
