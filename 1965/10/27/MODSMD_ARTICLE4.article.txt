# Aid Planned For N. Vietnam
## 
### JOE ROSEN BLOOM Associate Editor 
It appeal's likely that a Stanford
group will try to send medical sup
plies to war-injured in North Viet
nam, though no such action has yet
been taken.
Incorrect reports in several na
tional newspapers had said such ac
tion was already underway.
An organization, known as the Med
ical Aid Committee for Vietnam, is
in its "formative stage" and expects
to send medical supplies and possibly
blood to the victims of United States
bombing in Vietnam, according to
Stuart Mcßae, one <>112 its leaders.
Mcßae, a junior majoring in his

tory and a former member of the
Socialist Caucus, said that the Com
mittee had not yet campaigned for
members or funds hut that about
twenty students had expressed inter
est in the organization.
Red Cross to Help
The International Red Cross has
agreed to distribute the funds and
plasma they collect, he said.
The New York World-Telegram and
Sun reported yesterday that the Stan
ford chapter of the May Second Move
ment, a national anti-imperialist,
left-wing organization, was participat
ing in a West Coast effort to send
supplies to the Communist Vietcong.
But Mcßae emphasized his Commit-

U'c intends to send supplies only to
civilians, not to Vietcong troops.
"Meaningful Protest"
The purpose of the Committee, ac
cording to a statement released to the
Daily, is "to dramatize the fact that
I he war in Vietnam is necessarily a
war against the Vietnamese people."
It feels its project would be a "mean
ingful protest against American ac
tion in Vietnam and a gesture of con
cern for those now innocently suffer
ing the consequences."
Anatole Anton, treasurer of the
Stanford branch of the May Second
Movement, disclosed last night that
his organization is not sponsoring the
project, or anything like it, but is

"working actively in it."
Anton, a graduate student in phi
losophy, said the May Second Move
ment is not sponsoring the project
because "we want it to be broader
than our group." He said there were
students supporting the program for
"humanitarian reasons" who did not
want to be affiliated with the May
Second Movement.
Originated By .Movement
But the Movement was the origina
tor of the project, following a visit
to Stanford of Jeff Gordon, its na
tional coordinator, he said.
In its constitution the Stanford
chapter of the Movement states its
purpose simply as "to organize

against U. S. created wars." The
Stanford chapter has "roughly 15
members," Anton estimates.
The activities of the group on cam
pus this quarter have included the
distribution of a pamphlet and tin
showing of a movie, both opposing
the Vietnam war.
One of the American students who
defied a State Department ban in
going to Cuba. Anton was identified
by another officer of the Movement
as its "spokesman." Anton, along with
several other members of the organ
ization. is participating in the project
of the Committee.
Members of both the Medical Aid
Committee and the May Second Move
ment were connected with the Stan
ford Committee For Peace in Viet
nam, which conducted a 60-hour vigil
and protest in White Memorial Plaza
two weeks ago.

two weeks ago.
It appeal's likely that a Stanford
group will try to send medical sup
plies to war-injured in North Viet
nam, though no such action has yet
been taken.
Incorrect reports in several na
tional newspapers had said such ac

An organization, known as the Med
ical Aid Committee for Vietnam, is
in its "formative stage" and expects
to send medical supplies and possibly
blood to the victims of United States
bombing in Vietnam, according to
Stuart Mcßae, one <>112 its leaders.
Mcßae, a junior majoring in his

tory and a former member of the
Socialist Caucus, said that the Com
mittee had not yet campaigned for
members or funds hut that about
twenty students had expressed inter
est in the organization.
Red Cross to Help
The International Red Cross has
agreed to distribute the funds and
plasma they collect, he said.
The New York World-Telegram and
Sun reported yesterday that the Stan
ford chapter of the May Second Move
ment, a national anti-imperialist,
left-wing organization, was participat
ing in a West Coast effort to send
supplies to the Communist Vietcong.
But Mcßae emphasized his Commit-

U'c intends to send supplies only to
civilians, not to Vietcong troops.
"Meaningful Protest"
The purpose of the Committee, ac
cording to a statement released to the
Daily, is "to dramatize the fact that
I he war in Vietnam is necessarily a
war against the Vietnamese people."
It feels its project would be a "mean
ingful protest against American ac
tion in Vietnam and a gesture of con
cern for those now innocently suffer
ing the consequences."
Anatole Anton, treasurer of the
Stanford branch of the May Second
Movement, disclosed last night that
his organization is not sponsoring the
project, or anything like it, but is

"working actively in it."
Anton, a graduate student in phi
losophy, said the May Second Move
ment is not sponsoring the project
because "we want it to be broader
than our group." He said there were
students supporting the program for
"humanitarian reasons" who did not
want to be affiliated with the May
Second Movement.
Originated By .Movement
But the Movement was the origina
tor of the project, following a visit
to Stanford of Jeff Gordon, its na
tional coordinator, he said.
In its constitution the Stanford
chapter of the Movement states its
purpose simply as "to organize

against U. S. created wars." The
Stanford chapter has "roughly 15
members," Anton estimates.
The activities of the group on cam
pus this quarter have included the
distribution of a pamphlet and tin
showing of a movie, both opposing
the Vietnam war.
