# Mackenzie May Drop IIR Veto
## 
### JON ROISE Associate Editor 
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie
may withdraw his veto of an appro
priation from the LASSU contingency
fund 1o the Institute of International
Relations (IIR).
hi a statement released yesterday,
he also announced that lie will intro
duce a hill in the Legislature Thui*s
day which would clarify the provi
sions in the ASSU Bylaws upon which
il(H' constitutionality of his veto was
challenged.
Mackenzie told Tlie Daily last night
that he would ask LASSU to suspend
the rules which ordinarily prevent
the body from reconsidering legisla
tion. If LASSU complies, the Presi
dent said, he will withdraw the veto.
"There is fairly general agreement
that this appropriation was hastily
passed by the Legislature because of
the pressure of an extremely 'lull
agenda, and should have received
more attention," he said in his state
ment.
The appropriation would finance
the trip of an lIR delegate to the
Conference on the Atlantic Commu
nity, to be held in Washington, D.C.,
November 12-17.
Mackenzie's Keasons
In notifying LASSU Speaker Jay
Kadane of the veto Monday, Macken
zie gave three reasons for his move:
• "Insufficient guarantees have
been offered that the program will
be of any benefit to the student body."
• "There is a possibility that this
program as it is presently construed
could result in an additional draft
upon the contingency fund in order
to fulfill the obligation to put on a
conference."
• The Legislature did not give suf
ficient consideration to the measure,
as neither of the first two points were
debated when it was passed.
"Sufficient Guarantees"
"I find the reasons for the veto to
be very weak," lIR President Mike
Pillsbury told The Daily last night.
"Legislature's Finance Committee de
bated the appropriation thoroughly
for two hours at two meetings before
approving it."
Pillsbury said that "sufficient, guar
antees" had been established by the
Finance Committee to insure a bene
ficial return to the student body.
"Finance Committee agreed that
SlOO of the appropriation would be
considered a loan to the delegate."
explained Pillsbury. "The loan would
not be cancelled until the Committee
and I are satisfied at the end of the
year that the delegate has beneficially
shared his experience with the stu
dent body."

ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie
may withdraw his veto of an appro
priation from the LASSU contingency
fund 1o the Institute of International
Relations (IIR).
hi a statement released yesterday,
he also announced that lie will intro
duce a hill in the Legislature Thui*s
day which would clarify the provi
sions in the ASSU Bylaws upon which
il(H' constitutionality of his veto was
challenged.
Mackenzie told Tlie Daily last night
that he would ask LASSU to suspend
the rules which ordinarily prevent
the body from reconsidering legisla
tion. If LASSU complies, the Presi
dent said, he will withdraw the veto.
"There is fairly general agreement
that this appropriation was hastily
passed by the Legislature because of
the pressure of an extremely 'lull
agenda, and should have received
more attention," he said in his state
ment.
The appropriation would finance
the trip of an lIR delegate to the
Conference on the Atlantic Commu
nity, to be held in Washington, D.C.,
November 12-17.
Mackenzie's Keasons
In notifying LASSU Speaker Jay
Kadane of the veto Monday, Macken
zie gave three reasons for his move:
• "Insufficient guarantees have
been offered that the program will
be of any benefit to the student body."
• "There is a possibility that this
program as it is presently construed
could result in an additional draft
upon the contingency fund in order
to fulfill the obligation to put on a
conference."
• The Legislature did not give suf
ficient consideration to the measure,
as neither of the first two points were
debated when it was passed.
"Sufficient Guarantees"
"I find the reasons for the veto to
be very weak," lIR President Mike
Pillsbury told The Daily last night.
"Legislature's Finance Committee de
bated the appropriation thoroughly
for two hours at two meetings before
approving it."
Pillsbury said that "sufficient, guar
antees" had been established by the
Finance Committee to insure a bene
ficial return to the student body.
"Finance Committee agreed that
SlOO of the appropriation would be
considered a loan to the delegate."
explained Pillsbury. "The loan would
not be cancelled until the Committee
and I are satisfied at the end of the
year that the delegate has beneficially
shared his experience with the stu
dent body."
