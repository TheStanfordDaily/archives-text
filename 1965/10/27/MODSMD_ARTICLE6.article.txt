# Religion Survey Due Soon
## 
### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor (Third in a series 
"The basic job of the Committee
a survey of the nature and scope of
religious activities at Stanford
should be completed this year and
basic recommendations as to future
developments submitted to the Presi
dent," Dean Richard Lyman, chair
man of the President's Advisory Com
mittee on Religious Activities, told the
Daily yesterday.
"We are still surveying the total
situation, but I hope and believe we
shall have more developments to re
port than last year," Lyman, Associ
ate Dean of Humanities and Sciences,

stated.
In his analysis of last year ho
agreed largely with the views of
Chaplain Robert M. Minto as reported
yesterday, and cited "the development
of a united campus ministry, culmi
nating in the naming of the denomina
tional ministers as chaplain's associ
ates" as the chief note of progress
last year.
Hi 1 looks for the directions of fu
ture changes to include "some broad
ening of the meaning of 'religious
activities.' and further ecumenical
cooperation."
While commenting that Minto's in
terview was "a good description of
what has happened and an outline of

some of the directions the University
will probably follow," Lyman cau
tioned that he "was not at as sure
that the Founding Grant is not in
hibiting."
"Perhaps 100 much interest in the
religious situation is manifested in a
pie-occupation with the questions
raised by the Grant. 1 don't mean to
sweep the problems raised by the
Founding Grant under the rug; we
do need a clear understanding of what
it means and doesn't mean before we
move ahead. At the same time. I don't
want to see minimized other ques
tions with much practical impor
tance," he said.
"For example, there is the problem

of arriving at a satisfactory working
definition of the boundaries of reli
gious activities. Young people are
rightly dissatisfied with a conception
of religion that stops at the church
door; the question is how far into the
field of social problems can the Uni
versity's religious program be said
to extend."
Lyman also stated his belief in the
"importance of students' learning
about religion in a general sense."
The Committee's charge is "not only
to approve a specific request or to
participate in activities for their own
sake, but to make available to stu
dents knowledge and experience in
this area conductive to education in
the broadest sense."
The Committee has found it "hard
to respond to specific proposals for
money" without some guidelines as
to "how far religious activities go.
Of course religiously committed peo
ple view ail their actions in religious
terms, but we must interpret the
meaning of the phrase "support for
Memorial Church and related activi
ties."
(The Committee was formed in the
spring of 1964. following a gift to the
University by alumnus Lowell Berry
of $1.3 million. It earns about $30,000
a year income.)
Answer Awaits President
When asked for the result of the
Committee's deliberations on the
ASSU petition for student members
of the Committee, Lyman replied that
"the answer must come from the
President, because this is his com
mittee. I hope for an answer soon
after the President returns," ■ in about
three weeks).
"1 can say that the commit tee is
well aware of the lively student in
terest in religion. We are very con
cerned to be in touch with this
interest," he stated.
(The possibility of student mem
bers of the Committee was considered
and rejected early last year, the ex
planation being that the Committee
was to deal with personnel considera
tions. >
Committee Work
Lyman viewed Committee work last
year as largely "educational." Some
"interim recommendations" were
made to the President. This year, he
foresees the submission of "compre
hensive recommendations," and ex
pects more news to come out of the
Committee "across our whole area of
concern."
Work last year included that of the
three sub-committees. The Space Al
location committee, led by Chaplain
Minto, is still looking for office space
for the campus ministers. "I'm not
over-sanguine in this area." Lyman
reported. "Lack of office space is a
campus-wide problem." The commit
tee on visiting preachers, under Prof.
John Mothershead, encourages ex
tended visits by preachers and aids in
conference planning. The personnel
committee has been considering "ad
ditional strength" for the religious
program.

In his analysis of last year ho
agreed largely with the views of
Chaplain Robert M. Minto as reported
yesterday, and cited "the development
of a united campus ministry, culmi
nating in the naming of the denomina
tional ministers as chaplain's associ
ates" as the chief note of progress
last year.
Hi 1 looks for the directions of fu
ture changes to include "some broad
ening of the meaning of 'religious
activities.' and further ecumenical
cooperation."
While commenting that Minto's in
terview was "a good description of
what has happened and an outline of

some of the directions the University
will probably follow," Lyman cau
tioned that he "was not at as sure
that the Founding Grant is not in
hibiting."
"Perhaps 100 much interest in the
religious situation is manifested in a
pie-occupation with the questions
raised by the Grant. 1 don't mean to
sweep the problems raised by the
Founding Grant under the rug; we
do need a clear understanding of what
it means and doesn't mean before we
move ahead. At the same time. I don't
want to see minimized other ques
tions with much practical impor
tance," he said.
"For example, there is the problem

of arriving at a satisfactory working
definition of the boundaries of reli
gious activities. Young people are
rightly dissatisfied with a conception
of religion that stops at the church
door; the question is how far into the
field of social problems can the Uni
versity's religious program be said
to extend."
Lyman also stated his belief in the
"importance of students' learning
about religion in a general sense."
The Committee's charge is "not only
to approve a specific request or to
participate in activities for their own
sake, but to make available to stu
dents knowledge and experience in
this area conductive to education in
the broadest sense."
The Committee has found it "hard
to respond to specific proposals for
money" without some guidelines as
to "how far religious activities go.
Of course religiously committed peo
ple view ail their actions in religious
terms, but we must interpret the
meaning of the phrase "support for
Memorial Church and related activi
ties."
(The Committee was formed in the
spring of 1964. following a gift to the
University by alumnus Lowell Berry
of $1.3 million. It earns about $30,000
a year income.)
Answer Awaits President
When asked for the result of the
Committee's deliberations on the
ASSU petition for student members
of the Committee, Lyman replied that
"the answer must come from the
President, because this is his com
mittee. I hope for an answer soon
after the President returns," ■ in about
three weeks).
"1 can say that the commit tee is
well aware of the lively student in
terest in religion. We are very con
cerned to be in touch with this
interest," he stated.
(The possibility of student mem
bers of the Committee was considered
and rejected early last year, the ex
planation being that the Committee
was to deal with personnel considera
tions. >
Committee Work
Lyman viewed Committee work last
year as largely "educational." Some
"interim recommendations" were
made to the President. This year, he
foresees the submission of "compre
hensive recommendations," and ex
pects more news to come out of the
Committee "across our whole area of
concern."
Work last year included that of the
three sub-committees. The Space Al
location committee, led by Chaplain
Minto, is still looking for office space
for the campus ministers. "I'm not
over-sanguine in this area." Lyman
reported. "Lack of office space is a
campus-wide problem." The commit
tee on visiting preachers, under Prof.
John Mothershead, encourages ex
tended visits by preachers and aids in
conference planning. The personnel
committee has been considering "ad
ditional strength" for the religious
program.
"The basic job of the Committee
a survey of the nature and scope of
religious activities at Stanford
should be completed this year and
basic recommendations as to future
developments submitted to the Presi
dent," Dean Richard Lyman, chair
man of the President's Advisory Com
mittee on Religious Activities, told the
Daily yesterday.

what has happened and an outline of

some of the directions the University
will probably follow," Lyman cau
tioned that he "was not at as sure
that the Founding Grant is not in
hibiting."
"Perhaps 100 much interest in the
religious situation is manifested in a
pie-occupation with the questions
raised by the Grant. 1 don't mean to
sweep the problems raised by the
Founding Grant under the rug; we
do need a clear understanding of what
it means and doesn't mean before we
move ahead. At the same time. I don't
want to see minimized other ques
tions with much practical impor
tance," he said.
"For example, there is the problem

of arriving at a satisfactory working
definition of the boundaries of reli
gious activities. Young people are
rightly dissatisfied with a conception
of religion that stops at the church
door; the question is how far into the
field of social problems can the Uni
versity's religious program be said
to extend."
Lyman also stated his belief in the
"importance of students' learning
about religion in a general sense."
The Committee's charge is "not only
to approve a specific request or to
participate in activities for their own
sake, but to make available to stu
dents knowledge and experience in
this area conductive to education in
the broadest sense."
The Committee has found it "hard
to respond to specific proposals for
money" without some guidelines as
to "how far religious activities go.
Of course religiously committed peo
ple view ail their actions in religious
terms, but we must interpret the
meaning of the phrase "support for
Memorial Church and related activi
ties."
(The Committee was formed in the
spring of 1964. following a gift to the
University by alumnus Lowell Berry
of $1.3 million. It earns about $30,000
a year income.)
Answer Awaits President
When asked for the result of the
Committee's deliberations on the
ASSU petition for student members
of the Committee, Lyman replied that
"the answer must come from the
President, because this is his com
mittee. I hope for an answer soon
after the President returns," ■ in about
three weeks).
"1 can say that the commit tee is
well aware of the lively student in
terest in religion. We are very con
cerned to be in touch with this
interest," he stated.
(The possibility of student mem
bers of the Committee was considered
and rejected early last year, the ex
planation being that the Committee
was to deal with personnel considera
tions. >
Committee Work
Lyman viewed Committee work last
year as largely "educational." Some
"interim recommendations" were
made to the President. This year, he
foresees the submission of "compre
hensive recommendations," and ex
pects more news to come out of the
Committee "across our whole area of
concern."
Work last year included that of the
three sub-committees. The Space Al
location committee, led by Chaplain
Minto, is still looking for office space
for the campus ministers. "I'm not
over-sanguine in this area." Lyman
reported. "Lack of office space is a
campus-wide problem." The commit
tee on visiting preachers, under Prof.
John Mothershead, encourages ex
tended visits by preachers and aids in
conference planning. The personnel
committee has been considering "ad
ditional strength" for the religious
program.
