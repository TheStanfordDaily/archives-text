# Library Design Unique
## 
### STEVE SMITH 
By the fall of 1966, Stanford stu
dents will have a unique opportunity:
to have the full use of what will ulti
mately be the finest undergraduate
library in the country. Stanford's new
Undergraduate Library is patterned
somewhat after Harvard's tremen
dous Lament Library but will surpass
even Lamont in its usefulness.
Warren B. Kuhn, Director of the
new library, described general plan
in an interview with The Daily. The
center room of each of the four floors
will be Used to house most of the
books on that floor. In addition, each
floor will have four pavilions, one on
each corner, which will contain indi
vidual rooms for various purposes.
Within one of tho first floor pavilions
will be an audio room equipped not
only with tapes, but also with disk
recordings.
Students may use this room for the
oral assignments of language teach
ers. or for their own enjoyment of the
many fine recordings.

A particularly novel feature will be
an extensive collection on tapes and
reeoixls of great men reading their
own works. Professors may assign
students to hear Robert Frost reading
his poems or Churchill making his
speeches. Seven seminar rooms and
a 130-seat multi-purpose hall will also
be in the first floor pavilions.
The second floor will be devoted
primarily to books about western civ
ilization. It will contain all the books
now in the overcrowded Western Civ
ilization Library as well as the books
from the Reserved Book Room of the
present library. The pavilion space on
the second and third floors will con
tain study rooms for different gen
eral subjects. In addition, there will
l>e numerous private carrel desks for
students- who find it difficult 1o i"id\

the main stacks and gather them
together.
For the person who cannot study
without music there will eventually
be a daily audio program originating
from the main audio control room
which will be piped into the carrel
desks through a set of headphones.
Studying in the Sun
The fourth floor is designed for the
student who likes to study outside.
Each pavilion on this upper level will
actually be a sun terrace with basi
cally the same set-up of chairs and
tables as the outside portion of Tres
sider Union.
Book catalogues on each floor wijl

eliminate the need for a card cata
logue. One glance at the correct page
of the catalogue will reveal the loca
tion of any book in the library. This
system is not new. The Library qf
Congress has been experimenting
with the book catalogue system, but
Stanford will l>e tin 1 first on the West
Coast to use it.
The builders will make provisions
for adding a fifth floor in case the
need for expansion arises. However,
Mr. Kuhn does not expect this soon
because the library will contain about
50,000 books at the beginning and will
work up to 150,000, approximately the
same as Lamont at Harvard.
