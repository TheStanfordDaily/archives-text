## Approval Given To Unified Rush

Living group presidents have given

rush policy. The policy, first drafted
in spring quarter, marks the first time

all living groups has been adopted.
Here are the basic features of the
policy:

lion, edited by student living group
representatives, a Wilbur sponsor and
faculty resident, and an advisor from
the University Publications Service,
shall be mailed to each freshman's
home during Christmas vacation. The
publication will describe all living
choices.
• A second publication shall be dis
tributed winter quarter. This publica
tion will describe rush regulations and
procedure and will provide a pocket
in which houses and eating clubs may
insert their own literature.

The rush policy was prepared b\
an ad hoc student-faculty committee.
The committee's recommendations
were reviewed by the fraternities, eat
ing clubs, and Stern houses.
Fraternities challenged the idea o[
a special review and appeals council,
proposed originally in the ad hoc com
mittee's recommendations. Other liv
ing groups proposed minor modifiea
t ions.
