### PAMELA LANG 
Formal activities of the 1965
Stanford United Nations (SUN>
begin today al 4:15 p.m. with an
orientation meeting in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. This will he
ihe first gathering of the delega
tion chairmen and members,
many selected during the past
few weeks, who will represent
tho 117 United Nations members
at SUN sessions the week of
November 29.
"Essentially," says Secretary-
General, Ronald R. Royoe, "SUN
is an intellectual exercise, an
educational function." Held each
year during fall quarter, the
forum enables three to four
hundred Stanford students to
learn more about current af
fairs and their countries' indi
vidual positions.
This year student delegates
will learn even more about the
organization and function of the
United Nations, since the SUN
program now approximates that
of the New York United Na
tions more closely than before.
SUN now includes a Security
Council and three representa
tive UN committees. Some rules
have been modified, and it will
now be easier to introduce reso

lutions from the floor. There
will be no fixed agenda.
Special political and economic
coalitions (such as NATO and
the Common Market) may now
be represented in SUN, instead
of only large blocs of nations as
formerly. This arrangement,
Royce hopes, will allow even the
smaller nations lo express their
views on important issues.
Attendance at today's meeting
is required for delegation chair
men and urged for other dele
gation members. The meeting
will include a roll call, introduc
tions and instructions, and ad
resses by Secretary-General
Royce and Assistant Secretary-
General Larry Orwig. It is in
tended to inform the delegates
about their role in SUN and to
give the Secretariat staff a feel
ing for the needs and desires of
the delegates.
Any interested students who
are not already assigned to dele
gations should come to the meet
ing, emphasized Royce. Regis
tration materials will be avail
able, and more delegates, ob
servers, and research assistants
are badly needed. Twenty-seven
of the 117 member nations are
at present without delegation

chairmen, and, said Royoe,
"there is no such thing as an
overstaffed delegat ion."
The next event on tho SUN
schedule is a reception Novem
ber 10, at which delegates will
be able to meet and talk with
the San Francisco consuls from
member nations. This discussion
should give each delegate an

opportunity to better define for
himself his country's stand on
specific issues.
Actual sessions of this year's
SUN will begin on November
11 with bloc meetings. Commit
tee meetings start on Tuesday,
November 30, and Ihe General
Assembly meets nn Saturday,
December 4.

Special political and economic
coalitions (such as NATO and
the Common Market) may now
be represented in SUN, instead
of only large blocs of nations as
formerly. This arrangement,
Royce hopes, will allow even the
smaller nations lo express their
views on important issues.
Attendance at today's meeting
is required for delegation chair
men and urged for other dele
gation members. The meeting
will include a roll call, introduc
tions and instructions, and ad
resses by Secretary-General
Royce and Assistant Secretary-
General Larry Orwig. It is in
tended to inform the delegates
about their role in SUN and to
give the Secretariat staff a feel
ing for the needs and desires of
the delegates.
Any interested students who
are not already assigned to dele
gations should come to the meet
ing, emphasized Royce. Regis
tration materials will be avail
able, and more delegates, ob
servers, and research assistants
are badly needed. Twenty-seven
of the 117 member nations are
at present without delegation

chairmen, and, said Royoe,
"there is no such thing as an
overstaffed delegat ion."
The next event on tho SUN
schedule is a reception Novem
ber 10, at which delegates will
be able to meet and talk with
the San Francisco consuls from
member nations. This discussion
should give each delegate an

opportunity to better define for
himself his country's stand on
specific issues.
Actual sessions of this year's
SUN will begin on November
11 with bloc meetings. Commit
tee meetings start on Tuesday,
November 30, and Ihe General
Assembly meets nn Saturday,
December 4.
Formal activities of the 1965
Stanford United Nations (SUN>
begin today al 4:15 p.m. with an
orientation meeting in Dinkel
spiel Auditorium. This will he
ihe first gathering of the delega
tion chairmen and members,
many selected during the past
few weeks, who will represent
tho 117 United Nations members
at SUN sessions the week of
November 29.
"Essentially," says Secretary-
General, Ronald R. Royoe, "SUN
is an intellectual exercise, an
educational function." Held each
year during fall quarter, the
forum enables three to four
hundred Stanford students to
learn more about current af
fairs and their countries' indi
vidual positions.
This year student delegates
will learn even more about the
organization and function of the
United Nations, since the SUN
program now approximates that
of the New York United Na
tions more closely than before.
SUN now includes a Security
Council and three representa
tive UN committees. Some rules
have been modified, and it will
now be easier to introduce reso

lutions from the floor. There
will be no fixed agenda.
