## 
### ANNE FRASER 
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie's
withdrawal of his veto over appropri
ations for the Conference on the At
lantic Comunity will lead the agenda
of tonight's Legislature meeting. He
will then propose to ammend the
By-Laws to clarify the scope and pro
cedure of the veto.
The proposal, if passed, would di
rect I lie President, to notify the
Speaker of his intention to veto with
in 18 hours after passage of a bill.
Any motion to override the veto
would be introduced at the next legis
lative session. Also suggested by
Mackenzie is the need to define
"emergency" and "non-emergency"
appropriations outside the annual
budget. Mackenzie had vetoed the
appropriation on the grounds that it
was a "non-emergency" measure and
thus illegal.
Also on the agenda tonight will
be Ilmar Waldner's bill for a commit
tee to investigate the possibilities of
establishing contacts and an ex
change with the People's Republic of
China. Extending the idea of Stan
ford-in-the-W'orld, this bill is in recog
nition of the "growing importance"
of Red China.
Draft Attacked
Clark Brown will introduce another
resolution, condemning the policy of
the National Selective Service as "un
reasonably restrictive on students."
Since the Service defines the aca
demic year as the three quarters
(fall, winter, and spring) male stu
dents unable financially to fulfill this

attendance requirement are threat
ened by the draft.
The newly formed "Ad Hoe Com
mittee to Support Legality on the
Campus" will make a plea for an
appropriation of $100 to finance a
challenge of the legality of any fund
raising program at Stanford to aid
North Vietnam.
Also included on the agenda will be
resolutions for improving the mater
ial welfare of teaching assistants,
who, in contrast with research assist
ants. are subject to federal taxes.
Under consideration also will be
a resolution to investigate the use of
moneys from parking fees and the
possibility of reducing costs to stu
dents.
The meeting will begin at 7:30 in
room 320.
