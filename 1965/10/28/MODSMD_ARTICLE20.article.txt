### 
Though the after-effects of
hypnosis are generally mild and
infrequent, hypnosis should not
be practiced by amateurs or on
tertainers says Stanford Psy
chology Prof. Ernest It. Hilgard
in a new book, "Hypnotic .Sus
ceptibility."
H presents results of an eight
year study of hypnotism, the
first phase of an even longer
range research program under
taken by Prof. Hilgard and his
colleagues.
"Hypnosis for many subjects
is a highly charged personal ex
perience that may communicate
with traumatic experiences of
early life and bring evidences of
these earlier traumas into the
hypnotic situation," they warn.
Popular notions that hypno
tism can enable a person to "re
live" experiences of his youth
are "too extreme to be support
ed by acceptable studies," says
Prof. Hilgard.
"Many subjects experience
very vivid age-regressions, but
for most of them an observing
ego is maintained so that the
regressed state represents a par
tial rather than a full dissocia
tion from present awareness."
"We are not ready to go along
with any one approach to under
standing hypnosis," the book
concludes. "By further study the
propositions . . . sketched . . .
will become tightened into a
body of theory that will make
hypnosis understandable."
