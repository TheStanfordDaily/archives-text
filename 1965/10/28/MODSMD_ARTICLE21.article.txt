# Tribe Overtakes USC In AAWU Stats Race
## Stomp 
### 
Stanford has made a marked
gain this week in team statistics
after USC was destroyed by
Notre Damp and the Indians
overwhelmed the Army. The
two Stanford platoons, offense
and defense, lead the conference
in each respective category.
Even the pass defense, which
used to be the Card's major
problem, is the best in the con
ference. Quarterback Dave Lew
is the AAWU's leader in pass
ing and ranks third in total of
fense. One of the more amazing
statistics shows up in the punt
ing department where Stanford
boasts the top two kickers in
the conference.
Mike Garrett held onto both
of his large leads in the scoring
and rushing standings. Although
Garrett gained only 34 yards
against ND, he still leads the
second best rusher by almost
200 yards.
In team statistics USC dropped
numerous notches because of
their ineptitude against the Irish.
Washington, Stanford's oppo
nent this Saturday, ranks in
fifth place in both total offense
and defense. The AAWU as a
whole has a .6G7 percentage
against non-conference oppo
nents.
Normally the clubs from the
East inflict considerable damage
upon the lowly AAWU, but this
year the conference has become
a power to be feared.

A SECOND BEFORE he ate
dirt,, Oregon halfback Dennis
Keller (22) carries the hall into
awaiting Stanford defensive
linemen Bill Ostander (80), Al
Wilburn (84), and Mike Pavko
(T>4). Pavko side-stepped a futile
block by Oregon's Mark Rich
ards (68 —on ground).
Stanford has made a marked
gain this week in team statistics
after USC was destroyed by
Notre Damp and the Indians
overwhelmed the Army. The
two Stanford platoons, offense
and defense, lead the conference
in each respective category.
Even the pass defense, which
used to be the Card's major
problem, is the best in the con
ference. Quarterback Dave Lew
is the AAWU's leader in pass
ing and ranks third in total of
fense. One of the more amazing
statistics shows up in the punt
ing department where Stanford
boasts the top two kickers in
the conference.
Mike Garrett held onto both
of his large leads in the scoring
and rushing standings. Although
Garrett gained only 34 yards
against ND, he still leads the
second best rusher by almost
200 yards.
In team statistics USC dropped
numerous notches because of
their ineptitude against the Irish.
Washington, Stanford's oppo
nent this Saturday, ranks in
fifth place in both total offense
and defense. The AAWU as a
whole has a .6G7 percentage
against non-conference oppo
nents.
Normally the clubs from the
East inflict considerable damage
upon the lowly AAWU, but this
year the conference has become
a power to be feared.

A SECOND BEFORE he ate
dirt,, Oregon halfback Dennis
Keller (22) carries the hall into
awaiting Stanford defensive
linemen Bill Ostander (80), Al
Wilburn (84), and Mike Pavko
(T>4). Pavko side-stepped a futile
block by Oregon's Mark Rich
ards (68 —on ground).
Stanford has made a marked
gain this week in team statistics
after USC was destroyed by
Notre Damp and the Indians
overwhelmed the Army. The
two Stanford platoons, offense
and defense, lead the conference
in each respective category.
Even the pass defense, which
used to be the Card's major
problem, is the best in the con
ference. Quarterback Dave Lew
is the AAWU's leader in pass
ing and ranks third in total of
fense. One of the more amazing
statistics shows up in the punt
ing department where Stanford
boasts the top two kickers in
the conference.
Mike Garrett held onto both
of his large leads in the scoring
and rushing standings. Although
Garrett gained only 34 yards
against ND, he still leads the
second best rusher by almost
200 yards.
In team statistics USC dropped
numerous notches because of
their ineptitude against the Irish.
Washington, Stanford's oppo
nent this Saturday, ranks in
fifth place in both total offense
and defense. The AAWU as a
whole has a .6G7 percentage
against non-conference oppo
nents.
Normally the clubs from the
East inflict considerable damage
upon the lowly AAWU, but this
year the conference has become
a power to be feared.

A SECOND BEFORE he ate
dirt,, Oregon halfback Dennis
Keller (22) carries the hall into
awaiting Stanford defensive
linemen Bill Ostander (80), Al
Wilburn (84), and Mike Pavko
(T>4). Pavko side-stepped a futile
block by Oregon's Mark Rich
ards (68 —on ground).
Stanford has made a marked
gain this week in team statistics
after USC was destroyed by
Notre Damp and the Indians
overwhelmed the Army. The
two Stanford platoons, offense
and defense, lead the conference
in each respective category.
Even the pass defense, which
used to be the Card's major
problem, is the best in the con
ference. Quarterback Dave Lew
is the AAWU's leader in pass
ing and ranks third in total of
fense. One of the more amazing
statistics shows up in the punt
ing department where Stanford
boasts the top two kickers in
the conference.
Mike Garrett held onto both
of his large leads in the scoring
and rushing standings. Although
Garrett gained only 34 yards
against ND, he still leads the
second best rusher by almost
200 yards.
In team statistics USC dropped
numerous notches because of
their ineptitude against the Irish.
Washington, Stanford's oppo
nent this Saturday, ranks in
fifth place in both total offense
and defense. The AAWU as a
whole has a .6G7 percentage
against non-conference oppo
nents.
Normally the clubs from the
East inflict considerable damage
upon the lowly AAWU, but this
year the conference has become
a power to be feared.

A SECOND BEFORE he ate
dirt,, Oregon halfback Dennis
Keller (22) carries the hall into
awaiting Stanford defensive
linemen Bill Ostander (80), Al
Wilburn (84), and Mike Pavko
(T>4). Pavko side-stepped a futile
block by Oregon's Mark Rich
ards (68 —on ground).
Stanford has made a marked
gain this week in team statistics
after USC was destroyed by
Notre Damp and the Indians
overwhelmed the Army. The
two Stanford platoons, offense
and defense, lead the conference
in each respective category.
Even the pass defense, which
used to be the Card's major
problem, is the best in the con
ference. Quarterback Dave Lew
is the AAWU's leader in pass
ing and ranks third in total of
fense. One of the more amazing
statistics shows up in the punt
ing department where Stanford
boasts the top two kickers in
the conference.
Mike Garrett held onto both
of his large leads in the scoring
and rushing standings. Although
Garrett gained only 34 yards
against ND, he still leads the
second best rusher by almost
200 yards.
In team statistics USC dropped
numerous notches because of
their ineptitude against the Irish.
Washington, Stanford's oppo
nent this Saturday, ranks in
fifth place in both total offense
and defense. The AAWU as a
whole has a .6G7 percentage
against non-conference oppo
nents.
Normally the clubs from the
East inflict considerable damage
upon the lowly AAWU, but this
year the conference has become
a power to be feared.

second best rusher by almost
200 yards.
In team statistics USC dropped
numerous notches because of
their ineptitude against the Irish.
Washington, Stanford's oppo
nent this Saturday, ranks in
fifth place in both total offense
and defense. The AAWU as a
whole has a .6G7 percentage
against non-conference oppo
nents.
Normally the clubs from the
East inflict considerable damage
upon the lowly AAWU, but this
year the conference has become
a power to be feared.

A SECOND BEFORE he ate
dirt,, Oregon halfback Dennis
Keller (22) carries the hall into
awaiting Stanford defensive
linemen Bill Ostander (80), Al
Wilburn (84), and Mike Pavko
(T>4). Pavko side-stepped a futile
block by Oregon's Mark Rich
ards (68 —on ground).
