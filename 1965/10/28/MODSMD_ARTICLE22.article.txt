### 
Bill Ogle, a junior, is in his
second season with the varsity's
defensive unit.
This year Ogle, a 226 pounder,
plays loft guard after seeing
most of his 1964 action at right
guard. Minor injuries kept him
out of several games last year
and limited his playing ability.
Playing only 69 minutes last,
year, he still earned his letter.
This year Bill has been a starter
in each game. With 45 tackles
to his credit so far this cam
paign, ho is among the top five
tacklers on the squad.
Ogle's fine football sense has
helped him greatly in his play
ing against such threats as Ore
gon, USC, and Army, and ho has
shown himself very able to fill
the shoes of last year's Bob
Nichols.
