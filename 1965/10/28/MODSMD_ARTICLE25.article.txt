# Poloists Bob On Past S.F. State; Now 8-2
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Stanford's varsity water polo
isls extended their season's rec
ord to X-2 on the strength of a
10 6 victory over San Francisco
Stale Tuesday. Yesterday, the
Indians sailed into hostile Foot
hill territory.
Stanford defeated the Owls,
6-4, in an encounter earlier this
season in the Encina Pool. The
Foothill contingent was rated
among the nation's top three in
the preseason polls.
Foothill, especially in its own
tank, is not likely to have let
the Indians escape unscathed
again—at least not without four
quarters of intense, total pres
sure water polo. The Owls' loss
to the tribe was their only sot
back of the year.

7-6, down south after Stanford
lost several goals to the official's

Stanford's varsity water polo
isls extended their season's rec
ord to X-2 on the strength of a
10 6 victory over San Francisco
Stale Tuesday. Yesterday, the
Indians sailed into hostile Foot
hill territory.
Stanford defeated the Owls,
6-4, in an encounter earlier this
season in the Encina Pool. The
Foothill contingent was rated
among the nation's top three in
the preseason polls.
Foothill, especially in its own
tank, is not likely to have let
the Indians escape unscathed
again—at least not without four
quarters of intense, total pres
sure water polo. The Owls' loss
to the tribe was their only sot
back of the year.

Yesterday's Result
Foothill (>, Stanford 2
Stanford Frosh 18, Foothill J.V. ">

UCLA, No. 1, Here Saturday
After the scrap with Foothill,
Stanford cannot lot its guard
down. UCLA's Bruins come to
the Encina pool at 11:00 a.m.
Saturday to defend their number
one national ranking.
The Uclans slid by the Indians,
7-6, down south after Stanford
lost several goals to the official's
whistle. The homo pool advan-1
tage has shifted to the Indians, |
but the tribo has lost its number
one scorer, Gary Sheerer.
The outcome of Saturday's
contest will decide the national
championship, and from present
indications, the outcome won't
be decided until the fourth quar
ter has run its full course.
