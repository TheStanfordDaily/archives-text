Women's social regulations at
Stanford have two practical pur
poses, which last year's liberali
zation clearly brought out: pro
tection and contact in case of
emergency.
Few students appreciate ex
actly what a well-thought-out
web of security checks and
counter-checks constantly sur
round the undergraduate wo
men, keeping them safe from
harm.
A Typical Coed
To illustrate, lot us follow one
typical coed as she leaves her
dorm in ihe evening. She plans
to take a 2:30 late leave, so first
she musi sign out. Women are
nol required to sign out if they
plan to return before midnight,
of course, since automobile acci
dents, deaths in the family, and
other unfortunate situations
occur only in the after-dark
hours.
The business of the sign-out
card is the centei of every Stan
ford woman's life. Whenever
she leaves the dorm a cheery
sign reminds her to sign out.
The signs on the backs of the
bathroom doors similarly re
mind her, "Did You Sign In?
Pull Red Tab." Stili other signs
inform her of the emergency
phone number which she must
have always engraved on her
memory.
The sign-out card, once she
gets to it. demands destination
and companion. "Be specific,"
warn the judicial committees.
"How can anyone find you at
2:45 if all we know is that
you're eating in San Fran
cisco?"
Yellow In The Gutters
If she for some reason hasn't
nailed her evening plans to one
particular restaurant, the stand
ard solution is to indicate on
the sign-out card under "special
information" what she's wear
ing so that the police can at
least look for a yellow coat
as they search the gutters.
But in all events, all blanks
must be filled in; if she is alone,
she musi write "alone" to prove
that she doesn't really have a
companion whose name she
wants to keep secret. After all,
no one ever looks at her sign
out card except herself and her
committee representative. Pull
ing out the red tab is import
ant. too. Not as important as
remembering to sign in. But
still a little more important than

being awfully specific.
Judicial committees may dis
agree on such questions of de
gree when it comes to deciding
who gets a pink slip, but they
consider these questions from
every angle. Interminably.
The judicial committees
auxiliaries to Women's Council
iu each house—are in them
selves marvels of bureaucratic
efficiency. The committee rep
resentatives have the responsi
bility for checking daily all the
sign-out cards in their house for
violations of the Fundamental
Standard — major, minor, or
otherwise.
Slack Committees
In some houses, they may be
slack in their duties, but the
girls in their houses usually
crack flown on them soon
enough. Stanford women realize
that the Fundamental Standard
and Third Person Responsibility
can be upheld only with the
swift bringing to justice of all
red-tab-violators. A habit of
carelessness begun with a red
tab may lead to who knows
what other debilitating personal
weaknesses.
These committees have week
ly meetings in which they han
dle, in upperclass residences,
cases of Negligence and Poor
Judgment. Deliberate Disregard,
Misconduct, and Intent to De
ceive go to Women's Council.
Sometimes it is hard to dis
tinguish between Negligence
and Poor Judgment —like when
a girl forgets to look at her
watch but thinks it 2 a.m. when
actually it's 2:35. This, however,
isn't as hard as deciding whether
it's more serious (i.e. worthy of
greater penalty) to be late for
a 6 a.m. late leave than for a
2:30 the Social Regs Commit
tee and Women's Council have
been debating this all quarter.
Fortunately some cases are
more clear-cut. Auxiliary com
mittees in freshman dorms can
always handle cases of late min
utes where there is a good ex
cuse but only if it's under an
hour.
Appealed Cases
With some cases, it's actually
a foregone conclusion that they
will be appealed, as when a girl
who has been accidentally held
up until 3 a.m. but has called
the dorm to notify them. The
committee hears her case any
way in order to commend her
for her sense of responsibility.
This pat on the head is believed
to be psychologically encourag
ing.
Discussion in the committee
meetings may go on for half an
hour over a girl's attitude. Did

she make an honest, sincere ef
fort to learn and understand
the rules or did she dare think
there were other things at Stan
ford more worth her concentra
tion?
After all, it is the responsi
bility of every Stanford woman
to know and understand the
social regulations in all their
ramifications. This means, for
instance, knowing that "esti
mated date of return" on the
overnight card really means
"planned date of return," You're
likely to be the object of a
search if you don't make it back
by then.
It also means that even if a
girl doesn't remember to sign
out until after midnight she
is guilty of Deliberate Disre
gard. If she simply forgets al
together until she returns, this
is of course much more minor.
Doesn't Come Back
And if she doesn't come back,
once sigwed out? This is the
crucial test. Of course, she may
not have pulled her red tab out
in the first place, in which case
no one will ever suspect that
she's gone.
At least they won't now, al
though in Roble up to this year,
all sign-out cards were checked
every night to make sure no one
had been so careless.
Supposing, though, that a
traffic jam has held her up on
Bayshore? She calls the dorm
immediately, having the emerg
ency number on the top of her
head. Then, she bends all effort
to get to the dorm as speedily
as possible.
Back At The Dorm
Meanwhile, back at the dorm,
the R.A. and or the girl's com
mittee rep are awake and wait
ing at the door. They may be
somewhat disgruntled with the
girl. They may even be some
what disgruntled with the social
regulations- but only if they are
not too wide awake, for no one
in a serious moment would ad
mit they aren't really necessary.
In fact, social regulations
serve an educational function,
as the social regs handbook
points out. They train students
in the practical application of
the Fundamental Standard. This
training period lasts four years,
after which they are left, rule
less, with only their old sign
out cards to remind ihem of
how they have grown in i-e
-sponsibility.
Perhaps, way back in Stan
ford's primitive past, there was
someone who thought that the
FunStan was something that
shouldn't really be codified.
But we all know better now.

wants to keep secret. After all,
no one ever looks at her sign
out card except herself and her
committee representative. Pull
ing out the red tab is import
ant. too. Not as important as
remembering to sign in. But
still a little more important than

being awfully specific.
Judicial committees may dis
agree on such questions of de
gree when it comes to deciding
who gets a pink slip, but they
consider these questions from
every angle. Interminably.
The judicial committees
auxiliaries to Women's Council
iu each house—are in them
selves marvels of bureaucratic
efficiency. The committee rep
resentatives have the responsi
bility for checking daily all the
sign-out cards in their house for
violations of the Fundamental
Standard — major, minor, or
otherwise.
Slack Committees
In some houses, they may be
slack in their duties, but the
girls in their houses usually
crack flown on them soon
enough. Stanford women realize
that the Fundamental Standard
and Third Person Responsibility
can be upheld only with the
swift bringing to justice of all
red-tab-violators. A habit of
carelessness begun with a red
tab may lead to who knows
what other debilitating personal
weaknesses.
These committees have week
ly meetings in which they han
dle, in upperclass residences,
cases of Negligence and Poor
Judgment. Deliberate Disregard,
Misconduct, and Intent to De
ceive go to Women's Council.
Sometimes it is hard to dis
tinguish between Negligence
and Poor Judgment —like when
a girl forgets to look at her
watch but thinks it 2 a.m. when
actually it's 2:35. This, however,
isn't as hard as deciding whether
it's more serious (i.e. worthy of
greater penalty) to be late for
a 6 a.m. late leave than for a
2:30 the Social Regs Commit
tee and Women's Council have
been debating this all quarter.
Fortunately some cases are
more clear-cut. Auxiliary com
mittees in freshman dorms can
always handle cases of late min
utes where there is a good ex
cuse but only if it's under an
hour.
Appealed Cases
With some cases, it's actually
a foregone conclusion that they
will be appealed, as when a girl
who has been accidentally held
up until 3 a.m. but has called
the dorm to notify them. The
committee hears her case any
way in order to commend her
for her sense of responsibility.
This pat on the head is believed
to be psychologically encourag
ing.
Discussion in the committee
meetings may go on for half an
hour over a girl's attitude. Did

she make an honest, sincere ef
fort to learn and understand
the rules or did she dare think
there were other things at Stan
ford more worth her concentra
tion?
After all, it is the responsi
bility of every Stanford woman
to know and understand the
social regulations in all their
ramifications. This means, for
instance, knowing that "esti
mated date of return" on the
overnight card really means
"planned date of return," You're
likely to be the object of a
search if you don't make it back
by then.
It also means that even if a
girl doesn't remember to sign
out until after midnight she
is guilty of Deliberate Disre
gard. If she simply forgets al
together until she returns, this
is of course much more minor.
Doesn't Come Back
And if she doesn't come back,
once sigwed out? This is the
crucial test. Of course, she may
not have pulled her red tab out
in the first place, in which case
no one will ever suspect that
she's gone.
At least they won't now, al
though in Roble up to this year,
all sign-out cards were checked
every night to make sure no one
had been so careless.
Supposing, though, that a
traffic jam has held her up on
Bayshore? She calls the dorm
immediately, having the emerg
ency number on the top of her
head. Then, she bends all effort
to get to the dorm as speedily
as possible.
Back At The Dorm
Meanwhile, back at the dorm,
the R.A. and or the girl's com
mittee rep are awake and wait
ing at the door. They may be
somewhat disgruntled with the
girl. They may even be some
what disgruntled with the social
regulations- but only if they are
not too wide awake, for no one
in a serious moment would ad
mit they aren't really necessary.
In fact, social regulations
serve an educational function,
as the social regs handbook
points out. They train students
in the practical application of
the Fundamental Standard. This
training period lasts four years,
after which they are left, rule
less, with only their old sign
out cards to remind ihem of
how they have grown in i-e
-sponsibility.
Perhaps, way back in Stan
ford's primitive past, there was
someone who thought that the
FunStan was something that
shouldn't really be codified.
But we all know better now.

Women's social regulations at
Stanford have two practical pur
poses, which last year's liberali
zation clearly brought out: pro
tection and contact in case of
emergency.
Few students appreciate ex
actly what a well-thought-out
web of security checks and
counter-checks constantly sur
round the undergraduate wo
men, keeping them safe from
harm.
A Typical Coed
To illustrate, lot us follow one
typical coed as she leaves her
dorm in ihe evening. She plans
to take a 2:30 late leave, so first
she musi sign out. Women are
nol required to sign out if they
plan to return before midnight,
of course, since automobile acci
dents, deaths in the family, and
other unfortunate situations
occur only in the after-dark
hours.
The business of the sign-out
card is the centei of every Stan
ford woman's life. Whenever
she leaves the dorm a cheery
sign reminds her to sign out.
The signs on the backs of the
bathroom doors similarly re
mind her, "Did You Sign In?
Pull Red Tab." Stili other signs
inform her of the emergency
phone number which she must
have always engraved on her
memory.
The sign-out card, once she
gets to it. demands destination
and companion. "Be specific,"
warn the judicial committees.
"How can anyone find you at
2:45 if all we know is that
you're eating in San Fran
cisco?"
Yellow In The Gutters
If she for some reason hasn't
nailed her evening plans to one
particular restaurant, the stand
ard solution is to indicate on
the sign-out card under "special
information" what she's wear
ing so that the police can at
least look for a yellow coat
as they search the gutters.
But in all events, all blanks
must be filled in; if she is alone,
she musi write "alone" to prove
that she doesn't really have a
companion whose name she
wants to keep secret. After all,
no one ever looks at her sign
out card except herself and her
committee representative. Pull

With some cases, it's actually
a foregone conclusion that they
will be appealed, as when a girl
who has been accidentally held
up until 3 a.m. but has called
the dorm to notify them. The
committee hears her case any
way in order to commend her
for her sense of responsibility.
This pat on the head is believed
to be psychologically encourag
ing.
Discussion in the committee
meetings may go on for half an
hour over a girl's attitude. Did

she make an honest, sincere ef
fort to learn and understand
the rules or did she dare think
there were other things at Stan
ford more worth her concentra
tion?
After all, it is the responsi
bility of every Stanford woman
to know and understand the
social regulations in all their
ramifications. This means, for
instance, knowing that "esti
mated date of return" on the
overnight card really means
"planned date of return," You're
likely to be the object of a
search if you don't make it back
by then.
It also means that even if a
girl doesn't remember to sign
out until after midnight she
is guilty of Deliberate Disre
gard. If she simply forgets al
together until she returns, this
is of course much more minor.
Doesn't Come Back
And if she doesn't come back,
once sigwed out? This is the
crucial test. Of course, she may
not have pulled her red tab out
in the first place, in which case
no one will ever suspect that
she's gone.
At least they won't now, al
though in Roble up to this year,
all sign-out cards were checked
every night to make sure no one
had been so careless.
Supposing, though, that a
traffic jam has held her up on
Bayshore? She calls the dorm
immediately, having the emerg
ency number on the top of her
head. Then, she bends all effort
to get to the dorm as speedily
as possible.
Back At The Dorm
Meanwhile, back at the dorm,
the R.A. and or the girl's com
mittee rep are awake and wait
ing at the door. They may be
somewhat disgruntled with the
girl. They may even be some
what disgruntled with the social
regulations- but only if they are
not too wide awake, for no one
in a serious moment would ad
mit they aren't really necessary.
In fact, social regulations
serve an educational function,
as the social regs handbook
points out. They train students
in the practical application of
the Fundamental Standard. This
training period lasts four years,
after which they are left, rule
less, with only their old sign
out cards to remind ihem of
how they have grown in i-e
-sponsibility.
Perhaps, way back in Stan
ford's primitive past, there was
someone who thought that the
FunStan was something that
shouldn't really be codified.
But we all know better now.

Women's social regulations at
Stanford have two practical pur
poses, which last year's liberali
zation clearly brought out: pro
tection and contact in case of
emergency.
Few students appreciate ex
actly what a well-thought-out
web of security checks and
counter-checks constantly sur
round the undergraduate wo
men, keeping them safe from
harm.
A Typical Coed
To illustrate, lot us follow one
typical coed as she leaves her
dorm in ihe evening. She plans
to take a 2:30 late leave, so first
she musi sign out. Women are
nol required to sign out if they
plan to return before midnight,
of course, since automobile acci
dents, deaths in the family, and
other unfortunate situations
occur only in the after-dark
hours.
The business of the sign-out
card is the centei of every Stan
ford woman's life. Whenever
she leaves the dorm a cheery
sign reminds her to sign out.
The signs on the backs of the
bathroom doors similarly re
mind her, "Did You Sign In?
Pull Red Tab." Stili other signs
inform her of the emergency
phone number which she must
have always engraved on her
memory.
The sign-out card, once she
gets to it. demands destination
and companion. "Be specific,"
warn the judicial committees.
"How can anyone find you at
2:45 if all we know is that
you're eating in San Fran
cisco?"
Yellow In The Gutters
If she for some reason hasn't
nailed her evening plans to one
particular restaurant, the stand
ard solution is to indicate on
the sign-out card under "special
information" what she's wear
ing so that the police can at
least look for a yellow coat
as they search the gutters.
But in all events, all blanks
must be filled in; if she is alone,
she musi write "alone" to prove
that she doesn't really have a
companion whose name she
wants to keep secret. After all,
no one ever looks at her sign
out card except herself and her
committee representative. Pull
ing out the red tab is import
ant. too. Not as important as
remembering to sign in. But
still a little more important than

being awfully specific.
Judicial committees may dis
agree on such questions of de
gree when it comes to deciding
who gets a pink slip, but they
consider these questions from
every angle. Interminably.
The judicial committees
auxiliaries to Women's Council
iu each house—are in them
selves marvels of bureaucratic
efficiency. The committee rep
resentatives have the responsi
bility for checking daily all the
sign-out cards in their house for
violations of the Fundamental
Standard — major, minor, or
otherwise.
Slack Committees
In some houses, they may be
slack in their duties, but the
girls in their houses usually
crack flown on them soon
enough. Stanford women realize
that the Fundamental Standard
and Third Person Responsibility
can be upheld only with the
swift bringing to justice of all
red-tab-violators. A habit of
carelessness begun with a red
tab may lead to who knows
what other debilitating personal
weaknesses.
These committees have week
ly meetings in which they han
dle, in upperclass residences,
cases of Negligence and Poor
Judgment. Deliberate Disregard,
Misconduct, and Intent to De
ceive go to Women's Council.
Sometimes it is hard to dis
tinguish between Negligence
and Poor Judgment —like when
a girl forgets to look at her
watch but thinks it 2 a.m. when
actually it's 2:35. This, however,
isn't as hard as deciding whether
it's more serious (i.e. worthy of
greater penalty) to be late for
a 6 a.m. late leave than for a
2:30 the Social Regs Commit
tee and Women's Council have
been debating this all quarter.
Fortunately some cases are
more clear-cut. Auxiliary com
mittees in freshman dorms can
always handle cases of late min
utes where there is a good ex
cuse but only if it's under an
hour.

regulations- but only if they are
not too wide awake, for no one
in a serious moment would ad
mit they aren't really necessary.
In fact, social regulations
serve an educational function,
as the social regs handbook
points out. They train students
in the practical application of
the Fundamental Standard. This
training period lasts four years,
after which they are left, rule
less, with only their old sign
out cards to remind ihem of
how they have grown in i-e
-sponsibility.
Perhaps, way back in Stan
ford's primitive past, there was
someone who thought that the
FunStan was something that
shouldn't really be codified.
But we all know better now.

Women's social regulations at
Stanford have two practical pur
poses, which last year's liberali
zation clearly brought out: pro
tection and contact in case of
emergency.
Few students appreciate ex
actly what a well-thought-out
web of security checks and
counter-checks constantly sur
round the undergraduate wo
men, keeping them safe from
harm.
A Typical Coed
To illustrate, lot us follow one
typical coed as she leaves her
dorm in ihe evening. She plans
to take a 2:30 late leave, so first
she musi sign out. Women are
nol required to sign out if they
plan to return before midnight,
of course, since automobile acci
dents, deaths in the family, and
other unfortunate situations
occur only in the after-dark
hours.
The business of the sign-out
card is the centei of every Stan
ford woman's life. Whenever
she leaves the dorm a cheery
sign reminds her to sign out.
The signs on the backs of the
bathroom doors similarly re
mind her, "Did You Sign In?
Pull Red Tab." Stili other signs
inform her of the emergency
phone number which she must
have always engraved on her
memory.
The sign-out card, once she
gets to it. demands destination
and companion. "Be specific,"
warn the judicial committees.
"How can anyone find you at
2:45 if all we know is that
you're eating in San Fran
cisco?"
Yellow In The Gutters
If she for some reason hasn't
nailed her evening plans to one
particular restaurant, the stand
ard solution is to indicate on
the sign-out card under "special
information" what she's wear
ing so that the police can at
least look for a yellow coat
as they search the gutters.
But in all events, all blanks
must be filled in; if she is alone,
she musi write "alone" to prove
that she doesn't really have a
companion whose name she
wants to keep secret. After all,
no one ever looks at her sign
out card except herself and her
committee representative. Pull
ing out the red tab is import
ant. too. Not as important as
remembering to sign in. But
still a little more important than

being awfully specific.
Judicial committees may dis
agree on such questions of de
gree when it comes to deciding
who gets a pink slip, but they
consider these questions from
every angle. Interminably.
The judicial committees
auxiliaries to Women's Council
iu each house—are in them
selves marvels of bureaucratic
efficiency. The committee rep
resentatives have the responsi
bility for checking daily all the
sign-out cards in their house for
violations of the Fundamental
Standard — major, minor, or
otherwise.
Slack Committees
In some houses, they may be
slack in their duties, but the
girls in their houses usually
crack flown on them soon
enough. Stanford women realize
that the Fundamental Standard
and Third Person Responsibility
can be upheld only with the
swift bringing to justice of all
red-tab-violators. A habit of
carelessness begun with a red
tab may lead to who knows
what other debilitating personal
weaknesses.
These committees have week
ly meetings in which they han
dle, in upperclass residences,
cases of Negligence and Poor
Judgment. Deliberate Disregard,
Misconduct, and Intent to De
ceive go to Women's Council.
Sometimes it is hard to dis
tinguish between Negligence
and Poor Judgment —like when
a girl forgets to look at her
watch but thinks it 2 a.m. when
actually it's 2:35. This, however,
isn't as hard as deciding whether
it's more serious (i.e. worthy of
greater penalty) to be late for
a 6 a.m. late leave than for a
2:30 the Social Regs Commit
tee and Women's Council have
been debating this all quarter.
Fortunately some cases are
more clear-cut. Auxiliary com
mittees in freshman dorms can
always handle cases of late min
utes where there is a good ex
cuse but only if it's under an
hour.
Appealed Cases
With some cases, it's actually
a foregone conclusion that they
will be appealed, as when a girl
who has been accidentally held
up until 3 a.m. but has called
the dorm to notify them. The
committee hears her case any
way in order to commend her
for her sense of responsibility.
This pat on the head is believed
to be psychologically encourag
ing.
Discussion in the committee
meetings may go on for half an
hour over a girl's attitude. Did

she make an honest, sincere ef
fort to learn and understand
the rules or did she dare think
there were other things at Stan
ford more worth her concentra
tion?
After all, it is the responsi
bility of every Stanford woman
to know and understand the
social regulations in all their
ramifications. This means, for
instance, knowing that "esti
mated date of return" on the
overnight card really means
"planned date of return," You're
likely to be the object of a
search if you don't make it back
by then.
It also means that even if a
girl doesn't remember to sign
out until after midnight she
is guilty of Deliberate Disre
gard. If she simply forgets al
together until she returns, this
is of course much more minor.
Doesn't Come Back
And if she doesn't come back,
once sigwed out? This is the
crucial test. Of course, she may
not have pulled her red tab out
in the first place, in which case
no one will ever suspect that
she's gone.
At least they won't now, al
though in Roble up to this year,
all sign-out cards were checked
every night to make sure no one
had been so careless.
Supposing, though, that a
traffic jam has held her up on
Bayshore? She calls the dorm
immediately, having the emerg
ency number on the top of her
head. Then, she bends all effort
to get to the dorm as speedily
as possible.
Back At The Dorm
Meanwhile, back at the dorm,
the R.A. and or the girl's com
mittee rep are awake and wait
ing at the door. They may be
somewhat disgruntled with the
girl. They may even be some
what disgruntled with the social
regulations- but only if they are
not too wide awake, for no one
in a serious moment would ad
mit they aren't really necessary.
