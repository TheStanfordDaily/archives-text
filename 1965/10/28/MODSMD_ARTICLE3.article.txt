# National Frat. Suspends AKL
## 
### JIM SELNA Assistant Editor 
The Stanford chapter of Alpha Kap
pa Lambda was informed early yester
day by its national that it had been
suspended for 9<) days "for deliberate
violations of pledge educational pro
cedures and financial responsibilities

to the national organization."
AKL has considered going local for
the past two years and took a definite
step in that direction last Spring when
the chapter sent an informal question
naire to AKL alumni. Response to the
letter favored disaffiliationby more
than three to one.

The chapter had already sent bal
lots to alumni for a formal vote on
leaving the national whan the suspen
sion notice was received.
Discounts Reasons
AKL House president Don Scales
discounted the reasons for suspension
given by National Executive Secre

tary Lewis Bacon in the wire of noti
fication. In an official press release
Scales noted, "They knew we were
going to mail this ballot and we be
lieve this is the real reason for our
suspension."
Dues had not been paid to the na
tional for the months of June and

May. However, the fraternity's Beta
Corporation met last Monday and
voted to pay the delinquent dues. A
registered letter was sent the follow
ing day with payment. The national
had eontaeted the Dean's Office early
this week and was informed that the
chapter had remitted payment.
According to Scales, the national
was aware that the delinquent dues
had been paid prior to sending the sus
pension notice.
Since World War 11 the house had
gradually fallen away from national's
pledge education procedures. In the
past the national has accepted all of
Beta chapter's initiates without ques
tion.
Member Han
Suspension does noi effect the chap
ter's attempt to go local. Under terms
of the National charter, Beta cannot
initiate any new members nor can it
participate in national conclaves dur
ing the ban.
A chapter need not Ik* in good stand
ing with its national as a condition of
disaffiliation, Scales told The Daily.
"The national has a right to try to
influence the outcome of the vote ovei
disaffiliation, but they went about it
underhandedly," the chapter presi
dent said. The wired notice of suspen
sion was released to the press at the
national headquarters in Colorado
Springs before it was received by the
local chapter.
In a news letter recently sent to all
alumni, Scales outlined the case for
disaffiliation:
'"Beta is expected by the national to
pay dues and initiation fees. Other
practical ties, such as chapter partici
pation in national conclaves, chapter
adherence to national ritual and other
chapter use of national pledge train
ing procedures, have long been termi
nated .
"For all practical purposes the chap
ter has maintained itself as a local
fraternity. The chapter has long been
disaffiliated in practice if not in fact."
The spring poll of alumni opinion
showed that 74 per cent of those that
replied to the questionaire were in fa
vor of allowing the chapter to go local.
Charles Eldon, chairman of the
chapter building fund for the present
cluster house and past president of
Beta Corp. replied, "Really, only the
offices of National AKL organization
profit by having Ihe Stanford chapter
continue to pay it* $2500 to $3000 per
year dues." He went on to note that
disaffiliation would have little effect
on the alumni.
Accuse Stanford
The national had accused the Uni
versity of cooperating with the chap
ter and abetting it in its efforts to go
local. tSealcs denied this and said t&at
the University "has maintained strict
neutrality in the chapter's reappraisal
of its relationship with the national."
Discrimination is not an issue in the
dispute between the national and the
local, as is the case in the Sigma Chi
dispute.
The final decision over disaffiliation
will be made November 18 when the
ballots of alumni are counted. This
procedure will be conducted by a four
man committee representing the na
tional and the house corporation, the
University, and (he chapter.
According to the by-laws of the
house corporation,, a two-thirds ap
proval is necessary to disaffiliate.
Scales (old The Daily that he is con
fident that the vote will be favorable
for disaffiliation.
Beta chapter is the national's sec
ond oldest chapter, founded in 1923.
