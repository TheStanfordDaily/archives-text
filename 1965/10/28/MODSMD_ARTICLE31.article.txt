## Student Demonstrators Fight Information Lack 
### Walter Lippmann 
While the student demonstra
tions are quite evidently self
defeating, they are, it seems to
me. a pathetic reminder of what
happens in a free country when
responsible debate on great mat
ters of life and death is throt
tled down and discouraged.
The unhappy youths who burn
their draft cards are no doubt
misguided. But we must not for
get that they come from a na
tion which expects to understand
what its government is doing,
from a nation which is not habit
uated to obedience and to the
idea that it must listen to its
superiors and not talk back.
There is only one way that a
democratic people can be won
over and convinced, and that is
by enabling this people to hear
informed debate by its responsi
ble leaders. These young people
have a very high personal stake
in the conduct of foreign policy,
a much higher stake than the
rest of us. Yet, the fact of the
matter is that during the past
yearâ€”from the election of 1964
to the present time there has
been a radical change of policy
for ihe war in Vietnam.
11 has occurred without seri
ous, thorough informing and
candid discussion and responsi
ble debate in Washington. That
is why there have been the teach
ins. They have been attempts
by educated, but not fully in
formed teachers to fill the void
left by the absence of official
debate. And from the teach-ins,
which could not and did not pro
vide a substitute for responsible
debate, a few handfuls of young
men. some especially foolish and
some especially brave, have gone
out into the streets.
It may be said that there has
been no suppression of freedom
of speech, which is indeed true.
Nevertheless, the fact is that
debate has been shut down to an
inadequate minimum in the Sen
ate, and it is only in the Senate
that some men outside the ex
ecutive branch have access to all
authentic information. It is the
shutting down of debate in the

Senate which is at the root of
our uneasiness.
The President has not con
cealed his desire to conduct his
foreign policy in Vietnam and
in the Dominican Republic with
out genuine Senatorial debate.
He has achieved his desire by
adopting a foreign policy which
the Republican opposition can
not criticize, and then, with his j
real opposition-confined to thej
leaders of his own party, he has j
silenced them in personal argu- i
ment.
The main technique employed j
has been to substitute private
Presidential briefing of individ- i
ual congressmen and journalists
for open debate by independent l
men. These briefings have not !
truly illuminated the subject.
For one thing, they are not on
the public record. Moreover, the
man who is being briefed cannotj
debate with the President. He j
cannot do so out of respect for !
the office.
For another thing, he cannot
debate with the President since
he does not have access to all
the facts in the case. Only Sena
tors, like J. W. Fulbright in the
Dominican affair, who under
take an enormous task of inves
tigation are in a position to ar
gue about what has happened
and are equipped to conduct a J
serious debate.
And when debate by those,
who have a light to know is dis-'
couraged, there is no responsible !
guidance of public opinion. We J
must not be surprised that these |
great matters are then taken to
the teach-ins and out into the j
streets.
