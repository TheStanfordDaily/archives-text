## An Attack On Bumper Stickers 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Approximately two months
ago I affixed two "END THE
WAR IN VIETNAM" stickers to
my vehicle, one in front and the
other in the rear. Since that
time, these stickers have been
successively torn off, scribbled
upon, and otherwise wantonly
defaced. The third pair was
abused only this past Wednes
day evening, and it must be
emphasized that all but one of
these acts of vandalism were
perpetrated on the campus of
Stanford University. Moreover,
several of my acquaintances
who chose to display these stick
ers have reported similar ex
periences.
It is a logical and probably
valid assumption that these acts
were committed by ovcrzealous
representatives ot the opposing
viewpoint, by persons who favor
the current policy of the United
States in Vietnam, by self-styled
Loyal Americans and Patriots
in short, by members (and
please forgive the generaliza
tion > of the Radical Right. If I
am not mistaken, such persons
profess an almost religious be
lief in and adherence to the prin
ciples upon which this nation
was founded, among them the
freedom to express a dissenting
opinion, the freedom of speech.
The purpose, therefore, of this
letter i-. lo suggest to those
members of the Stanford Com

munity who are in the habit of
obliterating or otherwise sup
pressing expressions of opinion
in opposition to their own that
they adopt a more positive mo
dus operandi. Bumper stickers,
posters, and the like, expressing
such sentiments as "WIN THE
WAR IN VIETNAM," are read
ily available from a number of
soujrees, among them represent
atives of the John Birch Society.
I have considered displaying
stickers, etc., expressing my
point of view, only within my
vehicle 'i.e.. affixing them to the
inside of the windows). How
ever, is it not possible that those
persons responsible for the van
dalous acts described above
would feel obligated to destroy
or damage the windows and/or
the entire vehicle in order to
prevent the display of such sen
timents?
I have no intention of "fight
ing fire with fire," of resorting
to tactics similar to those de
scribed above. 1 wish only to beg
the individuals responsible for
these acts to behave as if they
were educated, responsible, and
mature citizens.

Editor, The Daily:
I'd like to add my voice to
those of Paul Random and oth
ers concerning the outlandish
and anti-intellectual actions of

the SCPV. Just yesterday some
graduate student —- from the
medical, no less —asked me to
read a pamphlet on Vietnam. I
was shocked; the nerve of this
guy! I'm involved in a vital Stan
ford Research Project; I mean
I'm trying to date one of these
high school girls you hear so
much about in tlie Daily.
Well, this med student started
asking me how I felt about the
United States naphlaming chil
dren and bombing hospitals. He
really wasn't too bright. So I
took my "sophisticated intellec
tual" stance, advocated so bril
liantly by Random, and I ask for
"proof," Well this "intellectual
bumbkin" starts pulling out cop
ies of Ramparts and The New
Republic. He even had a copy of
the Geneva Accords. Then I
knew he was one of those per
verters and didn't care about be
coming a real doctor.
Well, I hadn't even read the
sports page that day. And then
this guy starts talking about
about things we could do if we
really cared about stopping the
war. Naturally, I didn't with
my own research project and
all. But I've been at Stanford
for eight years so I knew how
to play along. He said something
about negotiating with the "N
L F." T figured he meant the
N F L. But no, he insists, It's
the National Liberation Front,

the political arm of the Viet
Cong.
Then my Stanford IQ clicked,
and I smashed him- intellectu
ally speaking; I'm not in a fra
ternity. So very casual-like I
start filling my TMU pipe, the
one I use in my research, and
looking real bright, I raise one
of my eyebrows ever so slightly
and puff, "Can you PROVE
that?" He was shattered.
So that's how we can handle
these SCPV people and anybody
else who wants to ruin our
American Way Of Intellectual
Analysis. Just ask them to prove
that the NLF means this Na
tional Liberation Front. But
watch out for this med student
—he's not intellectual like us.

Editor, The Daily:
On behalf of all who work
with me 1 wish to thank the
Daily for its attention given to
the Jester in Tuesday's feature
article "Wilbur Jester Wails."
Although the article seems hu
morously complimentary, it is
somewhat misguided and in sev
eral instances incorrect. The ef
fect of the misconception that
"all is relevant" is to distort the
true image of the Jester. In the
final paragraph the Jester is
called "a great place for sonv'
thing a little different from the

normal Stanford atmosphere."
The implication of the article is
that the usual Jester evening is
likely to bo the rowdiest to be
found north of Tijuana. "Seduc
tions and counter seductions
take place," people decide to kill
themselves or write "bawdy
rhymes" on the placemats. Such
humor grossly misrepresents
the quiet atmosphere which,
aside from the bizarre menu, is
the Jester's major attraction.
Probably the most inappropriate
statement (however harmless its
intent) was "Lewd calls are
made to the waitresses by hun
gry Wilbur animals." Although
it has been the policy of the
Daily to look upon Wilbur as a
zoo or some kind of hotel for
uncontrollable teenagers, this
mythical representation reaches
the absurd when applied to the
Jester. Males are not alone un
der the blanket Freshman my
thology propagated by the Daily.
The Jester wishes to stand apart
from Daily definitions and sub
tle references to "the übiquitous
concept of Branner pigs" by
stating that all Stanford women
are welcome regardless of class
or dormitory. But, lest we seem
ungrateful toward the generous
coverage of the lfciily, I wish to
state my appreciation for their
generally factual report.
