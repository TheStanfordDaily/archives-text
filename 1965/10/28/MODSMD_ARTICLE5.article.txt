# 'Conscience' Group Formed To Support Viet Nam Policy
## 
### JOE ROSENBLOOM Associate Editor 
The nucleus of a national student
organization which will back the
United States Vietnam policy in a
"quiet way" has been formed here.
Hal Scott and Michael Cummings,
graduate students in political science,
corned that the majority of students
science, because they "became con
cerned thatt he majority of students
are being misrepresented by extrem
ist groups."
The organization plans a nation
wide lecture-in November 22, two
days after a planned anti-war march
on an Oakland army depot by the
Berkeley Vietnam Day Committee, as
a show of student support for the
war.
In this way, it hopes to offset the
effect of the anti-war demonstration.
Seotl, who calls himself a "liberal
Republican," said yesterday in an in
terview with the Daily:
"It is our hypothesis that the vast
majority of citizens in the university
community do support the policy of
the President. We want to give those
students a quiet opportunity to be
counted."
.Moderate Opinion
The lecture-in will determine if
there is a substantial 'moderate stu
dent opinion" at U. S. universities,
Scott said.
Conscience sent letters Monday to

Young Republican and Young Demo
crat presidents at one university in
every state urging them to organize
"lecture-ins" at universities in their
state. It hopes to work through the
established club in a bipartisan cam
paign tor each "moderates" at the
universities.
It also sent letters to chairmen of
the Democratic and Republican na
tional committees and to President
Johnson notifying them about the or
ganization and asking for their sup
port.
Citizenship and Crisis
At the lecture-in speakers from
both academic and political communi
ties will discuss Vietnam policy as
well as 'responsible citizenship in the
times of crisis."
In the letters to other universities,

Scott and Cummings defined the pur
poses of Conscience:
"Mass demonstrations against Am
erican foreign policy at a critical
juncture such as the present reduce
the chances for lasting peace and
imperil the national security.
"We discnt from these demonstra
tions, particularly those which in
clude illegal acts such as draft card
burning, even though we do not
agree with all aspects of present
American policy."
Short-lived
In all probability, Conscience the
Committee on National Student Citi
zenship in Every National Case of
Emergency will cease to exist after
the lecture-in, Scott said.
Faculty supporters for Conscience
are Professors Gordon A. Craig of

Stanford and Aaron Wildavsky of
Berkeley, who will serve with other
faculty members, not yet chosen, on
a board of advisers.
The establishment of Conscience
with its headquarters here makes
Stanford a focal point for student
reaction to the Vietnam war both
for its supporters and its critics.
Medical Aid Committee organiza
tion, opposed to the war, announced
Tuesday its plans to send medical aid
to North Vietnam. Steve Cherkess
of Berkeley, a West Coast leader of
the anti-war May Second Movement,
said "depending on the success" of
the Stanford drive, chapters of his
organization will launch similar cam
paigns at Berkeley, San Francisco
State College and Sacramento State
College.

In this way, it hopes to offset the
effect of the anti-war demonstration.
Seotl, who calls himself a "liberal
Republican," said yesterday in an in
terview with the Daily:
"It is our hypothesis that the vast
majority of citizens in the university
community do support the policy of
the President. We want to give those
students a quiet opportunity to be
counted."
.Moderate Opinion
The lecture-in will determine if
there is a substantial 'moderate stu
dent opinion" at U. S. universities,
Scott said.
Conscience sent letters Monday to

Young Republican and Young Demo
crat presidents at one university in
every state urging them to organize
"lecture-ins" at universities in their
state. It hopes to work through the
established club in a bipartisan cam
paign tor each "moderates" at the
universities.
It also sent letters to chairmen of
the Democratic and Republican na
tional committees and to President
Johnson notifying them about the or
ganization and asking for their sup
port.
Citizenship and Crisis
At the lecture-in speakers from
both academic and political communi
ties will discuss Vietnam policy as
well as 'responsible citizenship in the
times of crisis."
In the letters to other universities,

Scott and Cummings defined the pur
poses of Conscience:
"Mass demonstrations against Am
erican foreign policy at a critical
juncture such as the present reduce
the chances for lasting peace and
imperil the national security.
"We discnt from these demonstra
tions, particularly those which in
clude illegal acts such as draft card
burning, even though we do not
agree with all aspects of present
American policy."
Short-lived
In all probability, Conscience the
Committee on National Student Citi
zenship in Every National Case of
Emergency will cease to exist after
the lecture-in, Scott said.
Faculty supporters for Conscience
are Professors Gordon A. Craig of

Stanford and Aaron Wildavsky of
Berkeley, who will serve with other
faculty members, not yet chosen, on
a board of advisers.
The establishment of Conscience
with its headquarters here makes
Stanford a focal point for student
reaction to the Vietnam war both
for its supporters and its critics.
Medical Aid Committee organiza
tion, opposed to the war, announced
Tuesday its plans to send medical aid
to North Vietnam. Steve Cherkess
of Berkeley, a West Coast leader of
the anti-war May Second Movement,
said "depending on the success" of
the Stanford drive, chapters of his
organization will launch similar cam
paigns at Berkeley, San Francisco
State College and Sacramento State
College.
The nucleus of a national student
organization which will back the
United States Vietnam policy in a
"quiet way" has been formed here.
Hal Scott and Michael Cummings,
graduate students in political science,
corned that the majority of students
science, because they "became con
cerned thatt he majority of students
are being misrepresented by extrem
ist groups."
The organization plans a nation
wide lecture-in November 22, two
days after a planned anti-war march
on an Oakland army depot by the
Berkeley Vietnam Day Committee, as
a show of student support for the
war.
In this way, it hopes to offset the
