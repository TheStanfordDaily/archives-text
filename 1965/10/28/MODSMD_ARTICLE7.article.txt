# PROTEST VIET POLICY:
## Profs To Petition LBJ 
### SUZETTE LEITH 
Twenty-nine Stanford professors
will begin collecting signatures today
for a petition demanding that the
United States "immediately and un
conditionally stop the bombing of
North Vietnam."
The petition, in the form of a letter
to President Johnson, will appear as
an advertisement in the Washington
post in early November. According to
Professor Charles A. Drekmeier of
the Political Science Department, it
will be published when at least one
thousand signatures are obtained
from the faculties of Bay Area uni
versities. He added that the University
of California at Berkeley has already
promised two thousand.
Negotiation Plea
In addition to protesting the bomb
ing, the petition urges direct negotia
tion with all parties involved in the
Vietnam war. It states that our will
ingness to participate in a peace con
ference would be a sign of strength,
not weakness, and could spare the
killing of both Vietnamese and Amer
icans.
The petition reads as follows:
"Dear Mr. President:
"We the undersigned urge that our
country immediately and uncondition
ally stop the bombing of North Viet
nam.
"It is still our hope that the United
States government seeks no wider

war. We agree with you. Mr. Presi
dent: 'Weapons do not make peace;
men make peace, and peace comes not
through strength alone but through
wisdom and patience and restraint.'
'Political Realism'
"We understand that our Govern
ment. through our Ambassador in
Warsaw and the good offices of other
states, has already entered into direct
communications with both Peking
and Hanoi. Political realism requires
that we enter into direct negotiations
with all concerned parties in the spirit
of 'Pacem in Terris.' We, therefore,
urge that our country unmistakably
indicate its willingness to participate
in a peace conference and to recog
nize the National Liberation Front as
one party to the negotiations.
"Our doing so will be a sign of
strength, not weakness; it will signify
the sincerity of our willingness to
negotiate, ;i willingness which we
have so often asserted; it will spare
the tragic killing of tens of thousands
of innocent Vietnamese, as well as
thousands of our sons and brothers
who may lose their lives in this brutal
and unnecessary conflict.

that our signatures will appear in an
advertisement in the Washington
Post in November 19tif>."
