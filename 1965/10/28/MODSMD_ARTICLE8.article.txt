Demonstrations indicate "a pro
found despair with American politics"
Prof. Barton Bernstein asserted last
night in a Tresidder panel discussion
of "Student Demonstrations Their
Benefits and Malefactions." In a pub
lic program sponsored by the Stan
ford Young Democrats, Berstcin
along with Prof. Hubert R. Marshall
from the Political Science Dept. and
Prof. Wilfred Stone of the English
Department argued the role of dem
ons t rat ions.
Drawing a distinction between the
Civil Hights demonstrations and the
Peace Movements, Bernstein claimed
that the former "inkindled local senti
ment. unfavorable publicity, then na
tional concern, and finally respons
ible legislation." But Peace Move
ments he argued, "flowed from a dif
ferent notion" and are "not trying
to convert the government but trying
to let it know that opposition exists."
Marshall emphasized that modern
demonstrations have "goals that are
limited and achievable," such as the
draft and Ihe Viet Nam War. He con
jectured that demonstrations are dis
turbing because we "live in a stable
political situation" where "anything
upsets the calm."
"On moral grounds nothing can
be said against demonstrations as
long as they are peaceful/' observed
Stone. " It is a part of the demo
cratic process." He warned however
against the misrepresentation of
some "marches" as "riots."
