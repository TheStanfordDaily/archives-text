Cosmic Glue
Mysterious forces hold the planers In orbit and charged particles within the nucleus.
The more deeply ;he secrets ot the cosmos are probed, the more amazing become those
strange interplays between energy and matter which give rise to the entire visible uni
verse. No mere static world originating by chanc< . the whole show is planned ctnd ordered,
and dynamically sustained by the force and power of a living God.
"In many separate revelations—each of which set forth ci portion of the truth—cind
in diffeient ways God spoke to our forefathers in and by the prophets. But in the last
of these days he has spoken to us in the Person of a Son, whom he appointed heir and
lawful Owner of all things, also by and through whom he created the worlds and the
reaches of space and the ages of time—that is, he made, produced, built, operated and
arranged them in order. Jesus Christ is the sole expression of the glory of God—the Light-
Being, the outraying of the divine—and he is the perfect imprint and very image of God's
nature, upholding and maintaining and guiding and propelling the universe by his
mighty word of power. When he had by offering himsell accomplished our cleansing
of sins and riddance ol guilt, he sat down at the right hand ol the divine Majesty on
high (Hebrews 1:1-3).
It is not surprising to learn that the Bible speaks about and understands the forces of
the atom and the sustenance of the universe. In fact, the New Testament speaks ahead
about a day when the nuclear fires latent in the matter all around us will be unloosed:
"The Lord is not slow about His promise as some counr slowness, but is forebearing toward
you, not wishing that any should perish but that all should reach tepentance. But the
Day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a loud
noise, and the elements will be unloosed with fire, and the earth and the works that are
upon it will be burned up" (2 Peter 3:9-10).
Nothing is more relevant in our atomic age than your personal relationship with the
God of the atom, the Lord Jesus Christ, whose vital energies sustain the cosmos.
