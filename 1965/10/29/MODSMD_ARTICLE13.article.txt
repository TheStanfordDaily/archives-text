# 'Scapin': Onward To Greatness
## 
### JOHN THAYER Entertainment Editor 
Having hunted around in the
cliche-bag for an appropriate
superlative to attach to the Rep
ertory Theater's production of
"That Scoundrel Scapin" — and,
moreover, having had absolutely
no luck—there seems to be noth
ing left but precise analysis, get
ting down to the nitty-gritty, so
to speak.
And a pleasure it is, too, for
Erik Vos has taken a reasonably
amusing farce, shaped it up,
padded it here and there, and
generally directed it into an
evening of unrelieved hilarity.
The farce is about, as the pub
licity blurbs say, "the brashness
of youth and the foolishness of
age," which translated into plain
English means that shortsighted
fathers are usually frustrated
in their attempts to regulate the
amatory adventures of their
sons, and that spend thrift sons
often get frustrated because
their fathers are so stingy (and
they are always getting into
scrapes they need money to get
out of).
Com media dell' Arte
Vos has added to this some
ideas from the Commedia dell'
Arte tradition. For instance, the
actors enter as if they were part
of a strolling company, clamber
ing onstage with much bustle
and deafening small talk.
In the middle of a scene,

father Argante breaks character
and becomes strolling player
Pierre (or some such name),
running up and down the aisles
screaming that another player
is upstaging (not to mention
nearly skewering) him.
Vos pads the play principally
near the end, where the com
pany suddenly decides to go
operatic, complete with chorus,
soli, and mad conductor, in a
totally irrelevant but brilliant
parody of grand opera. Later on,
two of the players engage in an
extended mime, also beside the
point but equally effective.
Spontaneity
These improvisions are sup
posed to make for a sort of in
formal and spontaneous atmos
phere, as well as providing more
laughs and a change of pace.
Their success is due in no small
part to Gerald Hiken and Jer
ome Raphel, whose roguish en
thusiasm progressively infects
the whole cast.
They play Seapin and Syl
vestre, respectively, servants

who are engaged in aiding the
sons against their fathers.
Raphel creates what must 1m?
the funniest scene in the whole
play, when he staggers on dis
guised as a brawny soldier, an
nounces his presence with a
leonine roar, and majestically
wraps his enormous sword
around a frail wooden post.
Hiken, as the brains of the
group, the man with the plan, is
constantly making faces that
tell the whole story and more.
In addition to his funnyface, he
makes funny lines all over the
place with an impeccable sense
of timing and delivery.
Overshadowed
Understandably a bit over
shadowed by such talent arc
Steve Newman (Octave) and
John Helleweg (Leandre), the
spend-thrift sons, but they do
quite well except for a tendency
toward woodenness. Paul Rich
ards and Harold Gould play the
fathers as parodies of parodies,
making them so ridiculous as to
be ludicrous — which is fine, be

cause they're it>ally much fun
nier that way, and nobody's
worried about realism, anyway.
Finally, Glenn Cannon is su

ductor, a miniature of the mad
exuberance and consummate!

Having hunted around in the
cliche-bag for an appropriate
superlative to attach to the Rep
ertory Theater's production of
"That Scoundrel Scapin" — and,
moreover, having had absolutely
no luck—there seems to be noth
ing left but precise analysis, get
ting down to the nitty-gritty, so
to speak.
And a pleasure it is, too, for
Erik Vos has taken a reasonably
amusing farce, shaped it up,
padded it here and there, and
generally directed it into an
evening of unrelieved hilarity.
The farce is about, as the pub
licity blurbs say, "the brashness
of youth and the foolishness of
age," which translated into plain
English means that shortsighted
fathers are usually frustrated
in their attempts to regulate the
amatory adventures of their
sons, and that spend thrift sons
often get frustrated because
their fathers are so stingy (and
they are always getting into
scrapes they need money to get
out of).
Com media dell' Arte
Vos has added to this some
ideas from the Commedia dell'
Arte tradition. For instance, the
actors enter as if they were part
of a strolling company, clamber
ing onstage with much bustle
and deafening small talk.
In the middle of a scene,

father Argante breaks character
and becomes strolling player
Pierre (or some such name),
running up and down the aisles
screaming that another player
is upstaging (not to mention
nearly skewering) him.
Vos pads the play principally
near the end, where the com
pany suddenly decides to go
operatic, complete with chorus,
soli, and mad conductor, in a
totally irrelevant but brilliant
parody of grand opera. Later on,
two of the players engage in an
extended mime, also beside the
point but equally effective.
Spontaneity
These improvisions are sup
posed to make for a sort of in
formal and spontaneous atmos
phere, as well as providing more
laughs and a change of pace.
Their success is due in no small
part to Gerald Hiken and Jer
ome Raphel, whose roguish en
thusiasm progressively infects
the whole cast.
They play Seapin and Syl
vestre, respectively, servants

who are engaged in aiding the
sons against their fathers.
Raphel creates what must 1m?
the funniest scene in the whole
play, when he staggers on dis
guised as a brawny soldier, an
nounces his presence with a
leonine roar, and majestically
wraps his enormous sword
around a frail wooden post.
Hiken, as the brains of the
group, the man with the plan, is
constantly making faces that
tell the whole story and more.
In addition to his funnyface, he
makes funny lines all over the
place with an impeccable sense
of timing and delivery.

Understandably a bit over
