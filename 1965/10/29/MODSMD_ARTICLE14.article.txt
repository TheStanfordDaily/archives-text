# 'Slight Ache' Gets Fine Rub From Tangent
## 
### ROGER McDANIEL 
There could be some exciting
weekends at the Top of the Tan
gent this year. Fridays and Sat
urdays will feature folk sing
ing, comedy and improvisation,
and on Sundays Philip Schultz
and Dee Marcus are presenting
contemporary theater.
The current production is Har
old Pinter's "A Slight Ache."
Pinter is probably Britain's lead
ing Absurdist playwright and
has a particularly fine talent for
capturing spoken English as it
really is.
In "A Slight Ache" Philip
Schultz and Valerie Scholl play
Edward and Flora, a British cou
ple. The action concerns Ed
ward's responses to int rust ions
from outside his world: a wasp,
which ho captures and kills, and
a matchseller, whose presence
draws from Edward his views on
the world, life, and himself, and
finally virtually his existence as
a human being.
Schultz Effective
Schultz is very effective in
portraying Edward's madness,
although the development of this
state starts from such an ad
vanced level that it is hard to
accept the character as it is pre
sented at the beginning of the
play. The scene with the wasp
moves slowly, as Schultz tries a
little too hard to emphasize Ed
ward's disturbed personality.
Miss Scholl is especially nota
ble for her scene with the match
seller, who to her represents
potency and sexual attractive
ness. This is opposed to Ed
ward's view of him as impotent,
like "a great bullockfat of jelly."
This difference in their views
is particularly interesting bo
cause of the nature of the match
seller: he never speaks, and he
moved only when led by one of
the other two—until the end,
when Edward is completely
drained. Douglas Whittemore
plays the matchseller quite well.
