Darrin MeGavin and Celeste Holm are playing THE KING AND
I, respectively, at the Circle Star in San Carlos.
Janet Blair is making lots of music in BELLS ARE RINGING at :
Hyatt Music Theater, also in San Carlos.
HELLO, DOLLY! is coming to the Curran in San Francisco on

The Friday series at Tresidder is going to try a marathon to- ,
night; they are showing WAR AND PEACE, which goes on forever
with Henry Fonda and Audrey Hepburn and the group. Bring a
cushion; the seats are rather hard.
ORPHEUS, based more or less on the legendary descent of Or- j
pheus into the Underworld to find his love Eurydice, will be Satur- J
day's Tresidder offering. Not only is it shorter; it's probably better,
too. After all, Jean Cocteau wrote and directed it.
IN THE COOL OF THE DAY is at the Sunday Flicks, A quick
poll of Daily staffers turned up a complete blank on it.
The International Film Discussion Series will feature CALLE
MAYOR aiSpanish movie about the troubled nature of our times!
and all that. It will be shown on Wednesday evening at 7:40 in the
I-Center.
The Bijou, open again, has HELP! and THAT MAN FROM RIO.
"Rio" stars Jean-Paul Beimondo, who was last year voted Stud of |
the Century by Laguinita. "Help!" is more irrelevant and even
funnier than "A Hard Day's Night," which takes some doing.
UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG and BLACK ORPHEUS at e at
the Fine Arts. However, Orpheus-lovers (and umbrella-lovers, too,
for that matter) are urged to hurry on over. Cassanova is about to
take their place.
Rod Steiger as THE PAWNBROKER is still pulling in the crowds
(and the dough) at the Guild. And he ought to: even the Daily |
reviewer said he was good.
There are rumors that BUNNY LAKE IS MISSING somewherel
within the confines of the Park Theater. If you hurry on up, you ■
might be able to help find her before showtime. This thriller was ;
directed by Otto Preminger and stars Lawrence Olivier, among (
others.
The Stanford has IX CO and WHY BOTHER TO KNOCK? Need
we say more?
Ole Burt Lancaster is down at the Varsity doing his "Amen,
Brother!" routine for THE HALLELUJAH TRAIL. It's like "Wagon
Train" at the movies. Only incidentally billed with him is Jack
Lcrnmon in HOW TO MURDER YOUR WIFE, in which Virna Lisi,
his wife, lies around all over the place.

The Manhattan Playhouse is holding tryouts for the West Coast
