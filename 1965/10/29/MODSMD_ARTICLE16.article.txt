# Stanford Women Seen— Is The Image For Real?
## 
### 
Ed. Note: Two senior worn on
were asked to comment on
"Stanford Women" —the plural
and the abstract. Their views,
while alike in many respects,
bring" up two different sides to
the question of "Is there a Stan
ford image?" and also just what
that image consists of. Fearing
bricks, bats and rock-filled beer
cans, they have asked to remain
anonymous.
Number One:
"To begin with, I don't think
you can talk about jusl "Stan
ford Women." I dislike categor
ies,. but. there, are. certain
"images" which people under
stand. A cocd may fit an image,
although she doesn't live in that
housing set-up. For instance,
there are "Row" girls in Euca
lypto and Granada."
What is the Row Girl image?"
"It seems to me that kind of
girl tends to be anti-intellectual
—and its not just a matter of
being more socially oriented.
Intellectual ism is an approach—
not a subject. It's a matter of
how much do you see and what
kind of questions you ask rather
than what topics you choose.
You can have an intellectual dis
cussion about dates. You can
have a superficial discussion
about classes."
And Flo Mo?
"Flo Mo girls don't strike mo
one way or the other. But La
gunita sems to house the people
who are doing things. Perhaps
they come here to retreat into
single rooms and become indi
viduals. There are more people
here, more individuals, but per
haps that's just because its a
larger group numerically than,
say. the Row."
What about Union. ITow does
the physical plant help make the
"Union girl"?
"I'm very impressed with the
girls I know in Union. I think
it's basically a matter of that
type of girl drawing similar
girls, although it's smaller size
and private yet communal setup
definitely does make a differ
ence. I don't think the Union per
sonality would work out as well
in a totally communal setup like
the Row. That Union personality
is more aware of her self and
her actions and the implications
of what she does. She's good at
relating ideas from different
fields. It's not that she wouldn't
go to a football game, but that
she would find ways of relating
it to other things she's doing
and thinking about. She's ex
cited about ideas."
On the other hand, Number

Two:
"I don't ihink there are any
images, except perhaps for Un
ion. The Union image is of girls
in jeans, with long hair and no
shoes. Not apathetic, but very
active, interested and intellect
ual. However, I really don't sec
any difference between the girls
on the Row and the girls in Lag
or Flo Mo. I object to trying to
describe an image, for then there
is one. In general, I think that
the Stanford woman doesn't
really stand out .so much from
any group, although you do

somehow sense a difference be
tween coeds here, and, say, at
San Jose.
Does the kind of living group
make a difference?
"I don't think so. Union is
just a dorm like Lag, except
that it has a central living room
and dining area—like the Row.
I'm not. convinced that the set-up
itself has any influence on the
girls. I think that Union's per
sonality is a result of girls who
started moving in who wanted
privacy and didn't necessarily
want a fraternity next door."

On the other hand, Number

"I don't ihink there are any
images, except perhaps for Un
ion. The Union image is of girls
in jeans, with long hair and no
shoes. Not apathetic, but very
active, interested and intellect
ual. However, I really don't sec
any difference between the girls
on the Row and the girls in Lag
or Flo Mo. I object to trying to
describe an image, for then there
is one. In general, I think that
the Stanford woman doesn't
really stand out .so much from
any group, although you do

somehow sense a difference be
tween coeds here, and, say, at
San Jose.
Does the kind of living group
make a difference?
"I don't think so. Union is
just a dorm like Lag, except
that it has a central living room
and dining area—like the Row.
I'm not. convinced that the set-up
itself has any influence on the
girls. I think that Union's per
sonality is a result of girls who
started moving in who wanted
privacy and didn't necessarily
want a fraternity next door."
Ed. Note: Two senior worn on
were asked to comment on
"Stanford Women" —the plural
and the abstract. Their views,
while alike in many respects,
bring" up two different sides to
the question of "Is there a Stan
ford image?" and also just what
that image consists of. Fearing
bricks, bats and rock-filled beer
cans, they have asked to remain
anonymous.
Number One:
"To begin with, I don't think
you can talk about jusl "Stan
ford Women." I dislike categor
ies,. but. there, are. certain
"images" which people under
stand. A cocd may fit an image,
although she doesn't live in that
housing set-up. For instance,
there are "Row" girls in Euca
lypto and Granada."
What is the Row Girl image?"
"It seems to me that kind of
girl tends to be anti-intellectual
—and its not just a matter of
being more socially oriented.
Intellectual ism is an approach—
not a subject. It's a matter of
how much do you see and what
kind of questions you ask rather
than what topics you choose.
You can have an intellectual dis
cussion about dates. You can
have a superficial discussion
about classes."
And Flo Mo?
"Flo Mo girls don't strike mo
one way or the other. But La
gunita sems to house the people
who are doing things. Perhaps
they come here to retreat into
single rooms and become indi
viduals. There are more people
here, more individuals, but per
haps that's just because its a
larger group numerically than,
say. the Row."
What about Union. ITow does
the physical plant help make the
"Union girl"?
"I'm very impressed with the
girls I know in Union. I think
it's basically a matter of that
type of girl drawing similar
girls, although it's smaller size
and private yet communal setup
definitely does make a differ
ence. I don't think the Union per
sonality would work out as well
in a totally communal setup like
the Row. That Union personality
is more aware of her self and
her actions and the implications
of what she does. She's good at
relating ideas from different
fields. It's not that she wouldn't
go to a football game, but that
she would find ways of relating
it to other things she's doing
and thinking about. She's ex
cited about ideas."
