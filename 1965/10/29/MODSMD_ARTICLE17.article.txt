# Dollies Invade The Clubs! Will Frats Fight? Switch?
## 
### LESLIE DESMOND 
The Stanford Woman can now
establish her equality in a way
much more significant than the
present "liberal" social regs
allow. More than her weekly
overnights, more than her 5.55
a.m. goodbyes, she now is offer
ed the opportunity of removing
herself completely from the
overworked male-female dating
relationship to share equal
status in a traditionally mascu
line organization The Stanford
Elating Club.
The first female to "join" an
Eating Club is Anya Peters, an
associate in El Capitan. Anya is
junior from Albany, California,
but lives off campus, being over
23 years old. She dropped out of
school for a few years to prac
tice ballet professionally, and
has just resumed her studies
here. After coming to lunch
several times as a guest, El
Capitan invited her to become
their first female associate.
Kit Tuveson, president of El
Capitan, said that the Dean's
Office favors the off campus
girls joining the clubs, but of
ficial administrative consent is '
presently non-existent. There is ,
some opposition to extending j
this privilege to only a limited j
number of girls; the university j
food services cannot provide all
the dollies with the opportunity.
Changing Mores
Investigating further opinon
on this magnanimous gesture,
the Daily contacted Dave Brown,
the Vice President of Breakers.
"This is a logical extension of
the changing mores of the time.
Breakers believes in equality of
the sexes."

Will the fraternities also
grant the Stanford Dolly the
privilege of associating with the
"bros"? According to Brown,
the fraternities have a tradition
to uphold, and due to this con
servative element a bit more
time might be involved in ex
tending social equality to the
row. But the beauty of the situ
ation lies in the fact that the
Eating Clubs are "fairly liberal"
and are "willing to recognize a
Stanford girl." Perhaps Ihe fra
ternities will be forced to elim
ina t e ALL discriminatory
clauses from their charters.
The case for female equality
now rests completely with the
girls living in the high-rise
apartments next quarter. The
big question is whether they will
decide to accept or reject their
opportunity.

but lives off campus, being over
23 years old. She dropped out of
school for a few years to prac
tice ballet professionally, and
has just resumed her studies
here. After coming to lunch
several times as a guest, El
Capitan invited her to become
their first female associate.
Kit Tuveson, president of El
Capitan, said that the Dean's
Office favors the off campus
girls joining the clubs, but of
ficial administrative consent is '
presently non-existent. There is ,
some opposition to extending j
this privilege to only a limited j
number of girls; the university j
food services cannot provide all
the dollies with the opportunity.
Changing Mores
Investigating further opinon
on this magnanimous gesture,
the Daily contacted Dave Brown,
the Vice President of Breakers.
"This is a logical extension of
the changing mores of the time.
Breakers believes in equality of
the sexes."

Will the fraternities also
grant the Stanford Dolly the
privilege of associating with the
"bros"? According to Brown,
the fraternities have a tradition
to uphold, and due to this con
servative element a bit more
time might be involved in ex
tending social equality to the
row. But the beauty of the situ
ation lies in the fact that the
Eating Clubs are "fairly liberal"
and are "willing to recognize a
Stanford girl." Perhaps Ihe fra
ternities will be forced to elim
ina t e ALL discriminatory
clauses from their charters.
The case for female equality
now rests completely with the
girls living in the high-rise
apartments next quarter. The
big question is whether they will
decide to accept or reject their
opportunity.
