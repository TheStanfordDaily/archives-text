## Poloists Face UCLA Saturday 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
Sprouting a new shock of hair,
Stanford's swimming Indians,
8-3, will have.a chance to shave
the number one collegiate water
polo ranking from UCLA tomor
row morning at 11:00 a.m. in the
Encina Pool.
The Indians had their scalps
trimmed by some low-flying
Owls Wednesday, as Foothill
College dealt Stanford's varsity
its third loss, 6-2, in Foothill's
pool.
UCLA, currently undefeated
and riding on top of the country,
beat the tribe in UCLA's tank
earlier this season by the slim
margin of 7-6. The homo-pool ad
vantage now lies in Indian ter
ritory.
Two Bniin Olympians
Leading the unclad Uclans to
their most successful season in
recent years are Stan Cole and
Dave Ashleigh, both members of
the 1964 Olympic water polo
team. Cole scored six goals in
the Stanford-UCLA game two
weeks ago.
Stanford made a few mistakes
at the outset of the UCLA game
earlier this year, many of which
were due to unfamiliarity on a

number of offensive advantages.
If the Indians can avoid these
slip-ups tomorrow morning, they
could quite effectively upset the
Los Angeles applecart.
Comparative scores put the
two teams on an Even-Steven
basis. Both squads have beaten
USC. UCLA downed the Tro
jans, 6-5, at UCLA and Stanford
beat SC, 12-10, at Troy.
One big thing that may upset
the Even-Steven set-up is that
Stanford is faced with an Un
even-Gary situation. Gary Sheer
er, the tribe's leading scorer and
teamwork specialist, has been
out of action for a week with a
broken hand suffered against
San Jose State.
Foothill Dominates
Stanford's game against Foot
hill started at a stand off. After
6 minutes of the 7 minute first
period had passed, the game was
scoreless, only three shots hav
ing been attempted. Then Foot
hill's Watson zeroed in on the
net after a fast break.
Foothill took their 1-0 first pe
riod lead and multiplied it four
fold in the second quarter. Stan
ford's offense could not get off
the ground while the Owls

scooped up three more goals.
The third quarter saw intense
control play, as neither team
could muster a score. Foothill's
goalie made four saves on Stan
ford shots.
The Indians bounced back into
the game early in the last stan
za. Mark Parmely passed Hor
ner in the Owl goal, and shortly
afterwards, Bill Derrig pegged
in an 8 yard shot to make the
score <1-2.
The Owls then thwarted Indi
an hopes with a fast break goal
late in the quarter. Owl Hind
ended the game with another
Foothill score, avenging the 6-4
defeat suffered at the Encina |
Pool three weeks ago.
Saturday afternoon, after the
Stanford game, UCLA takes on
Foothill at Los Altos.
Stanford Frosh Clean Up
Stanford's freshman squad
saved face for the Farm Wednes- j

olao took turns in administering
a goalie-harrowing 9 goal blitz.
Tom Jamison scored three
more in the final quarter, while
Wall and Nicolao picked up an
other goal each, to leave the
final score 18-5.
The frosh play the College of
San Mateo at 10:00 a.m. tomor
row here. Coach Jimmie Smith ,
considers CSM a serious threat
to the frosh's 8-1 record, as the
Mateans have one of their
strongest squads ever.
