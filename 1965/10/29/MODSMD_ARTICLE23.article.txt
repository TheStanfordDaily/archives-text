## Dealing With Protest 
### 
The affirmations ol support, particularly
within university communities, for United
States Government policy in Vietnam have
helped to restore some proportion to the mean
ing of recent protest demonstrations on many
campuses. That is healthy. But it would stil)
be a mistake to let the reaeton to these protests
persuade the public generally that the protest
ers are a bunch of beatniks allowing themselves
to be led into narcissistic irresponsibility by
Communists or parasitic scoundrels.
Admittedly some Communists and some
parasites are gnawing at the woodwork. But
caught up in the protests are many young
people w ho love their country and who lack
neither idealism nor moral courage. Conscience
and courage should command respect wliere
ever they assert themselves. Thus the wiser
course in dealing with those protesters who are
impelled by conscience is to take them serious
ly. To "smear them is as foolish as it is unfair.
To take them esriously does not mean agree
ing with them. But it does mean trying
to understand sympathetically why they pro
test—and arguing intelligently and patiently
with them.
There is, in fact, something more healthy
about the current protests than there was in
the sheep-like apathy and fear which marked
the general public response to the McCarthy
ism of the early 1950 s. Whatever the strengths
of the university generation of those years, the
desire for involvement and commitment in the
great political and social issues of the day was
not marked among them. Crowding into tele
phone booths and swallowing goldfish were

more popular in some quarters. But today, there
is a widespread desire in the universities for
service in whatever seems to undergraduates
(and graduates) as a noble cause.
The popularity ol the Peace Corps is due
to this. The readiness of many students to
spend their summers in the South is part of the
same tiling. There is abroad an idealism, often
inchoate, which the more clear-headed can sat
isfy with decisiveness and without involvement
in areas that must seem to many outsiders
fuzzy at the best and murky at the worst. But
common to virtually all those swept forward
by this idealism, no matter how feebly ex
pressed, is an impatience with humbug and
cant. Above all, humbug and cant coming from
those w ho claim to speak with authority or to
know better.
In recent days. Senator Fulbriglit and
columnist Walter Lippmann have pointed to
the dangers of consensus that shuts off intelli
gent and open debate on controversial issues.
They are right. Consensus that can stand up to
inside and outside pressures must be a con
sensus reached as the result of a reasoning to
gether, not in lobbies and antechambers and
inner sanctums, but in the proper forums that
exist in a free society for questoning and
debate.
Authority would be mistaken il it thought
the proper prosecution ol a few for activities
connected with the protest movement makes
unnecessary the intelligent answering of ques
tions that the sincere protesters are likely to
insist still on putting.

The affirmations ol support, particularly
within university communities, for United
States Government policy in Vietnam have
helped to restore some proportion to the mean
ing of recent protest demonstrations on many
campuses. That is healthy. But it would stil)
be a mistake to let the reaeton to these protests
persuade the public generally that the protest
ers are a bunch of beatniks allowing themselves
to be led into narcissistic irresponsibility by
Communists or parasitic scoundrels.
Admittedly some Communists and some
parasites are gnawing at the woodwork. But
caught up in the protests are many young
people w ho love their country and who lack
neither idealism nor moral courage. Conscience
and courage should command respect wliere
ever they assert themselves. Thus the wiser
course in dealing with those protesters who are
impelled by conscience is to take them serious
ly. To "smear them is as foolish as it is unfair.
To take them esriously does not mean agree
ing with them. But it does mean trying
to understand sympathetically why they pro
test—and arguing intelligently and patiently
with them.
There is, in fact, something more healthy
about the current protests than there was in
the sheep-like apathy and fear which marked
the general public response to the McCarthy
ism of the early 1950 s. Whatever the strengths
of the university generation of those years, the
desire for involvement and commitment in the
great political and social issues of the day was
not marked among them. Crowding into tele
phone booths and swallowing goldfish were

more popular in some quarters. But today, there
is a widespread desire in the universities for
service in whatever seems to undergraduates
(and graduates) as a noble cause.
The popularity ol the Peace Corps is due
to this. The readiness of many students to
spend their summers in the South is part of the
same tiling. There is abroad an idealism, often
inchoate, which the more clear-headed can sat
isfy with decisiveness and without involvement
in areas that must seem to many outsiders
fuzzy at the best and murky at the worst. But
common to virtually all those swept forward
by this idealism, no matter how feebly ex
pressed, is an impatience with humbug and
cant. Above all, humbug and cant coming from
those w ho claim to speak with authority or to
know better.
In recent days. Senator Fulbriglit and
columnist Walter Lippmann have pointed to
the dangers of consensus that shuts off intelli
gent and open debate on controversial issues.
They are right. Consensus that can stand up to
inside and outside pressures must be a con
sensus reached as the result of a reasoning to
gether, not in lobbies and antechambers and
inner sanctums, but in the proper forums that
exist in a free society for questoning and
debate.
Authority would be mistaken il it thought
the proper prosecution ol a few for activities
connected with the protest movement makes
unnecessary the intelligent answering of ques
tions that the sincere protesters are likely to
insist still on putting.
