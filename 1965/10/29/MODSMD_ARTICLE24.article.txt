# THE 						CAPITOL SCENE
## Jack 'The Ripper' In Alabama 
### BY ART BUCHWALD 
After reading the accounts of
the recent trial in Haynevillc,
Alabama, where a jury found a
socially prominent citizen "not
guilty" of killing a civil rights
seminary student, one wonders
how Jack the Ripper would have
fared if he had been a citizen of
Alabama and had been caught
and tried in Lowndes County.
It might have gone something
like this.
First, the grand .jury would
indict him for manslaughter in
stead of murder on the grounds
that, although he killed five
women, it was done without
malice.
Then the trial takes place. An
all-white jury made up of friends
of the Hipper family is selected,
and the judge, who is Jack's un
cle, warns the prosecution to be
brief and refrain from calling
too many witnesses.
The county prosecutor reluc
tantly charges that Jack killed
five women by slitting their
throats and spreading their in
nards about. The people in the
courtroom chuckle and several
of Jack's cousins wave to him.
The prosecution produces the
knife as evidence and then rests
his case.
The defense attorney for Jack
does not deny the charges,
which causes members of the
KKK in the courtroom to ap

plaud. But he maintains Jack
was acting in self-defense.
He calls his first witness. "Did
you see the defendant stab his
first victim?"
"Yes,sir, I did. Rip was walk
ing down the street late at night
when this here woman pulls a
switchblade on him, and he had
no choice but to slash out at her
first. It was quick thinking on
his part, because that woman
meant to do him harm."
The second witness, Zeke Rip
per, is called.
"Zeke. eight days after Rip
defended himself, he ran into an
other woman on the street,
What was her name?"
"Dark Annie Chapman."
"Would you repeat that
again?"
"Dark Annie Chapman."
"What happened, Zeke?"
"Wal. Rip is just strolling
along and suddenly Dark Annie
comes up to him with a pistol
in her hand like she's going to
kill him, so Jack pulls out his
knife and slits her throat."
"Where's the pistol now,
Zeke?"
"Some nigra rushed up and
took it away 'fore the police
came."
"Thank you, Zeke. Now, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury, I'm
not even going to call any wit
nesses in regards to the killings

of 'Long Liz' Stride and Kate
Edowes, because there is no need
to. Jack saw both these women
kissing nigras and he went up
to them and told them to stop
it and when they didn't Jack did
what any Haynevillc gentleman
would do and stabbed them both
in ihe abdomen.
"As for the killing of Black
Mary Kelly, I'd like to call Jef
ferson Lingo Ripper. Jefferson,
what happened, in your own
words?"
Laughter from the court.
"Are those Black Mary's
clothes?"
"Yes, sir."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, I ask you, what kind of
woman would wear clothes like
this and bring shame and world
wide publicity to the good peo
ple of Lowndes County. No
white man will be safe on the
streets of Hayneville if you find
Jack the Ripper guilty of de
fending himself. Put yourself in
his place. Wouldn't you have
done the same thing?"
The .judge asks the jury to
file out and decide a verdict.
The foreman says, "No need
for that, judge. We find the de
fendant not guilty and we wish
to take this opportunity to nom
inate Jack the Ripper for sheriff
of this God-fearing community."

was acting in self-defense.
He calls his first witness. "Did
you see the defendant stab his
first victim?"
"Yes,sir, I did. Rip was walk
ing down the street late at night
when this here woman pulls a
switchblade on him, and he had
no choice but to slash out at her
first. It was quick thinking on
his part, because that woman
meant to do him harm."
The second witness, Zeke Rip
per, is called.
"Zeke. eight days after Rip
defended himself, he ran into an
other woman on the street,
What was her name?"
"Dark Annie Chapman."
"Would you repeat that
again?"
"Dark Annie Chapman."
"What happened, Zeke?"
"Wal. Rip is just strolling
along and suddenly Dark Annie
comes up to him with a pistol
in her hand like she's going to
kill him, so Jack pulls out his
knife and slits her throat."
"Where's the pistol now,
Zeke?"
"Some nigra rushed up and
took it away 'fore the police
came."
"Thank you, Zeke. Now, ladies
and gentlemen of the jury, I'm
not even going to call any wit
nesses in regards to the killings

of 'Long Liz' Stride and Kate
Edowes, because there is no need
to. Jack saw both these women
kissing nigras and he went up
to them and told them to stop
it and when they didn't Jack did
what any Haynevillc gentleman
would do and stabbed them both
in ihe abdomen.
"As for the killing of Black
Mary Kelly, I'd like to call Jef
ferson Lingo Ripper. Jefferson,
what happened, in your own
words?"
Laughter from the court.
"Are those Black Mary's
clothes?"
"Yes, sir."
"Ladies and gentlemen of the
jury, I ask you, what kind of
woman would wear clothes like
this and bring shame and world
wide publicity to the good peo
ple of Lowndes County. No
white man will be safe on the
streets of Hayneville if you find
Jack the Ripper guilty of de
fending himself. Put yourself in
his place. Wouldn't you have
done the same thing?"
The .judge asks the jury to
file out and decide a verdict.
The foreman says, "No need
for that, judge. We find the de
fendant not guilty and we wish
to take this opportunity to nom
inate Jack the Ripper for sheriff
of this God-fearing community."

After reading the accounts of
the recent trial in Haynevillc,
Alabama, where a jury found a
socially prominent citizen "not
guilty" of killing a civil rights
seminary student, one wonders
how Jack the Ripper would have
fared if he had been a citizen of
Alabama and had been caught
and tried in Lowndes County.
It might have gone something
like this.
First, the grand .jury would
indict him for manslaughter in
stead of murder on the grounds
that, although he killed five
women, it was done without
malice.
Then the trial takes place. An
all-white jury made up of friends
of the Hipper family is selected,
and the judge, who is Jack's un
cle, warns the prosecution to be
brief and refrain from calling
too many witnesses.
The county prosecutor reluc
tantly charges that Jack killed
five women by slitting their
throats and spreading their in
nards about. The people in the
courtroom chuckle and several
of Jack's cousins wave to him.
The prosecution produces the
knife as evidence and then rests
his case.
The defense attorney for Jack
does not deny the charges,
which causes members of the
KKK in the courtroom to ap

plaud. But he maintains Jack
was acting in self-defense.
