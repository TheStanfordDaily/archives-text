## Repertory Theater: Rebirth, Not Death 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Having recently returned from
an eastern trip during which I
encountered a great deal of in
terest in and enthusiasm for our
new M.F.A. in Drama and the
Stanford Repertory Theater, il
seems ironic to find the Daily
greeting the opening day of the
company's first production with
a onesidedly negative editorial
and not even a new one at that,
but a reprint from last year's
paper! Isn't it time that you
gave some attention to the ad
vantages offered by the new pro
gram, and took the trouble to
find out what the University is
doing and why?
Our new program can best be
understood as part of a national
ferment in the theater. Partly
because of a growing sophistica
tion and interest in drama
among the public throughout
the country, and partly in re
action to the troubles that have
made Broadway theater less and
less attractive to thoughtful and
imaginative actors and directors,
good theater is undergoing a
revolution of decentralization.
There are now more than two
dozen resident theater compa
nies across the nation, and it is
no longer unthinkable for an
ambitious and able theater pro
fessional to leave New York be
hind and head for what would
once have been dismissed as "the
boondocks." One of our aims is
to make Stanford the provider
of first-rate drama for its own
community—which means first
of all the student body, graduate
and undergraduate alike. The
student playgoer may not have
the intense concern of a Ram's
Head performer; but there are
more playgoers than perform
ers, and the extensive interest
of the one must be given fair
weighting against the intensive
interest of the other.
Beyond this, however, the
Stanford program represents a
unique effort to blend the pro
fessional and the academic. No
where else, except perhaps for a
new program just getting under
way at Carnegie Tech, is the at
tempt being made to form a
theater company composed of
people with an active desire to
take part in the academic train
ing of future generations of the
ater people. Several universities
have had acting companies in
residence; at Princeton, for ex
ample, such a company shares
the McCarter Theater with the
famous Triangle Club (for whom
the theater was first built—an
undergraduate group not unlike
Ram's Head). But at Stanford
we intend that the company
shall be as much a teaching arm
of the department as it is a pro
vider of exciting theater for the
community.
Does this mean "The Death of
Student Drama," as Mr. Jacobs
melodramatically puts it? Far
from that, the new program
should mean a rebirth of student
drama. Boiled down to its essen
tials, Mr. Jacobs' plaint concerns
one major point, and one only:
the Ram's Head spring show
will not be feasible—until we
succeed in building a new thea
ter. Why does not the Daily join
us in pointing out the glaring
need for adequate physical fa
cilities for drama, instead of at
tacking an exciting and imagi
native attempt to give new
strength to the performing
arts?

• "Freedom" Is A...
Editor, The Daily:
Mr. Piaggio's letter protesting
the attacks on his "End Vietnam
War Now" stickers bring some
rather disturbing questions to
my mind. I had the opportunity
of confronting one of these self
styled patriots who had sought
to remove a similar sticker from
my car. I asked him if his ac

tions stemmed from his belief
that I shouldn't have the right
to express my point of view. The
question was evaded, but he in
dicated that he was ashamed to
be going to the same school with
me, and he obviously thought I
should not be allowed to display |
such a sign, to express what 1 J
believe, or to exorcise tho rights i
of speech and expression which !
are granted to me by the consti- j
tut ion.
When people such as this are ;
in positions of power, as are
Mayor Houlihan and his friend
"Clench" Teethman, how is de
mocracy going to fare in Amer
ica? I am no I afraid, because
my mind is free, but I wonder if
these people can destroy other
peoples' constitutional rights, as
they seem so anxious 1o do.
Democracy will continue in
this country, and these people
will not destroy the constitution- ]
al rights of others as long as
everyone continues to express j
what he believes, without fear,
as long as every professor, whose j
beliefs correspond to those ex
pressed in the petition to LBJ, I
signs that petition, and as long I
as we continue displaying bump
er stickers which express what
we believe.

• Save The Union!
Editor, The Daily:
This letter was written as an I
answer to the call of our fellow i
faculty members to make 1
known our distress over the pro- ,
jected closing of the Union Hall
of Residence at the end of Fall 1
Quarter. As teachers, friends, ;
and even neighbors of the Union
residents, we feel that this :
unique institution should be pre
served. The Union is one of the
finest examples of the embodi
ment of the aims of the Dean's
office, namely the continued >
pursuit of intellectual curiosity |
in the dormitory. Its closing,
therefore, would only frustrate
the very ends the administration
is pursuing. It is our hope that
the Union can be preserved un
til the end of Spring Quarter
and then a suitable replacement
provided for next year.

•Take Gas, Torn
Editor, The Daily:
The recent avalanche of
thought by Tom Bowen on the
subject of Mills College must j
not go unchallenged, especially
by a Mills girl who knows her
college well and, by coincidence,
Mr. Bowen. 1 admire the some
what conservative attitude of
Mr. Bowen, who's been known
to rage around his fraternity!
house, and not among the euca- i
lyptus lanes of the Mills campus.!
Conversation. I admit, we usu-!
ally utilize to the best of our
ability, especially when a Stan
lord man has nothing more to
talk about than the 'turkeys'
who live next door. As for 'sex
starvation," who's starved?
What with seven men for every
two women on the farm, it
seems to me that they should be
thankful that Mills exists. As for
intelligence, my roommate re
jected her Stanford acceptance,
but some Stanford men haven't
rejected her at all.
