## By MARSHA COOK

"If the Republican Party has a
nominee who can't get 2'.Â¥/< of the
Democrats who will be voting in 1966
we will lose," asserted gubernatorial
candidate George Christopher yester
day.
The former mayor of San Francisco
set forth his ideas for uniting his
party and defeating Governor Pat
Brown in a talk sponsored by the
Young Republicans.
Christopher, who announced his
candidacy for the Republican nomina
tion Tuesday, said, "I intend to win
this. That's the only reason I entered
the race." He added, "If the Republi
can party is going to preach unity it's
going to have to practice it."
Christopher said he has "staunch
faith" in the free enterprise system
and valued personal initiative above
all else.
On the issues, Christopher accused
certain Democrats of pushing parti
san election of local officials. He said
it leads to "graft, corruption, and bad
government." The "vaseilation and
indecisiveness of the incumbent gov
ernor" concerning the state's agri
culture situation is shown by agri
culture's "representation in name but

not in fact" on the governor's cabinet,
he charged.
Christopher commented that he
would like to try every possible means
of relieving high crime rates in Cali
fornia. He suggested founding a new
crime commission.
Of the recent campus demonstra
tions, Christopher said, "I believe in
the open door policy. Everyone should
have the right to express his opinion

without fear of repercussions. He
hastened to add, "As you have privi
leges, you also have responsibilities.''
The decisions should rest in the hands
of the people with authority.
The present system of legislative
representation was preferred by
Christopher to tlie new reapportion
ment. He favors the Dirkson Amend
ment which allows each state to de
termine its form of representation.
