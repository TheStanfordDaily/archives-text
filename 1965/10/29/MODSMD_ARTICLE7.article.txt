# New Frosh Academic Programs

### BARBARA LEVIN 
The Freshman Year a perplexing: time of ad
justment and reassert ion is in the first stages of
change. Discontent and distress was the basic
texture of the year found among previous fresh
men. faculty, their advisors, and throughout
the University in general, are being resolved
through a series of new or revitalized ideas. Far
reaching experimentation in non-credit work, in
residence planning, and in curriculum, is altering
the image and the life of a Stanford freshman.
The beginning of all these programs during the
same year is not coincidental. They are the con
crete results of a study which began in 1!)(3().
Freshman Year Studied
Last Septcmbei the General Studies Committee,
which is directly responsible for the structure ol
the freshman program, published its findings of u
three-part, four-year survey. Dr. Robert Walker,
chairman of the Committee, explained that the
Committee on University Policy ordered the study
in December 1960 because there was mounting
concern for many phases ol the Ireshman life.
The report. "The Freshman Year at Stanford."
presents statistics and evaluations on the attitudes
of freshman, the administration and advising of
the program, and the first year curriculum.
Twelve recommendations were made in this re
port. In the past year the problems were reviewed
and possible solutions were initiated this fall on an
e.\ pei im"Ut a I basis. However, Dr. Walter pointed

out tli.it these changes were the products of con
stant re-evaluation and did not evolve at once.
In some ways the findings of the study concern
ing courses and grading have affected this year's
courses. The greatest revision has occurred in the
English program; however, its progress is exem
plary of many other departments.
For the past few years, a number of sections of
Special English for highly qualified students has
supplemented the regular English classes. This
year ten sections of English I offer talented fresh
men the opportunity to study creative writing. A
series of lectures and three visiting writer-teachers
are included in the schedule, which aims to teach
students to write clearly and to think critically.
Frrshinan Seminars
On totally experimental grounds, three classes
of English are not being grader! during fall and
winter quarters. Criticism of papers will not in
elude a letter grade. Professor Allied Appel. co
director of Freshman English, explained that the
totally voluntary program, in which the uncduca
tional problems of grading are removed, allows
greater expression and development. Grades or
evaluations will be issued at the end of two quar
ters after about twelve papers. By this time an
instructor knows the capabilities of each student
well. Tgor Webb, one of the three teachers in the
program, has expressed his happiness in this new
type of teaching experience.
The newest and mu.t unique expeluiiuil is the

series of Freshman Seminars which were created
by a committee studying possible uses lor ati
anonymous gift. Mrs. Elizabeth Webb, coordinator
of the program, said that the donor believes that
each person has the capability for contributing
creatively to society. In these small-group, study
experiences, depth of subject matter and interest
arc stressed. The seminars are an interdepartmen
tal project and combine faculty and freshmen in a
new manner.
The changes in the freshman year can be sum
mari/.ed by Professor Albert Guerard's statement
of three new prevalent philosophies in modern edu
cation. These ideas of small group experiences,
learning by doing, and learning in depth are being
enlarged into new programs of curriculum, resi
dence living, and non-credit work which are en
veloping this year's Stanford freshmen.
Tin* Next Decade.
Extensions of the freshmen programs are being
discussed. In fact, Dr. Robert Walker announced
that the Committee on General Studies is presently
completing a survey which is a sequel to the fresh
man study. The report of its findings will be
released as a pamphlet, "The Next Decade at
Stanford."
Dr. Walker warned that students max have a
limited view of the University's progress. "The
perspective of a student is often bounded by his
four-year staj. while Stanford is constantly re
viewing iis image, and its outlook is always
changing."

Freshman Year Studied
Last Septcmbei the General Studies Committee,
which is directly responsible for the structure ol
the freshman program, published its findings of u
three-part, four-year survey. Dr. Robert Walker,
chairman of the Committee, explained that the
Committee on University Policy ordered the study
in December 1960 because there was mounting
concern for many phases ol the Ireshman life.
The report. "The Freshman Year at Stanford."
presents statistics and evaluations on the attitudes
of freshman, the administration and advising of
the program, and the first year curriculum.
Twelve recommendations were made in this re
port. In the past year the problems were reviewed
and possible solutions were initiated this fall on an
e.\ pei im"Ut a I basis. However, Dr. Walter pointed

out tli.it these changes were the products of con
stant re-evaluation and did not evolve at once.
In some ways the findings of the study concern
ing courses and grading have affected this year's
courses. The greatest revision has occurred in the
English program; however, its progress is exem
plary of many other departments.
For the past few years, a number of sections of
Special English for highly qualified students has
supplemented the regular English classes. This
year ten sections of English I offer talented fresh
men the opportunity to study creative writing. A
series of lectures and three visiting writer-teachers
are included in the schedule, which aims to teach
students to write clearly and to think critically.
Frrshinan Seminars
On totally experimental grounds, three classes
of English are not being grader! during fall and
winter quarters. Criticism of papers will not in
elude a letter grade. Professor Allied Appel. co
director of Freshman English, explained that the
totally voluntary program, in which the uncduca
tional problems of grading are removed, allows
greater expression and development. Grades or
evaluations will be issued at the end of two quar
ters after about twelve papers. By this time an
instructor knows the capabilities of each student
well. Tgor Webb, one of the three teachers in the
program, has expressed his happiness in this new
type of teaching experience.
The newest and mu.t unique expeluiiuil is the

series of Freshman Seminars which were created
by a committee studying possible uses lor ati
anonymous gift. Mrs. Elizabeth Webb, coordinator
of the program, said that the donor believes that
each person has the capability for contributing
creatively to society. In these small-group, study
experiences, depth of subject matter and interest
arc stressed. The seminars are an interdepartmen
tal project and combine faculty and freshmen in a
new manner.
The changes in the freshman year can be sum
mari/.ed by Professor Albert Guerard's statement
of three new prevalent philosophies in modern edu
cation. These ideas of small group experiences,
learning by doing, and learning in depth are being
enlarged into new programs of curriculum, resi
