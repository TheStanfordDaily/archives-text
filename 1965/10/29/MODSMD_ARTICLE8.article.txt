# LASSU Overrides Mackenzie Veto
## China Resolution Stranded In Parliamentary Squabble 
### BORDEN WENTHOME 
The Legislature voted to override
ASSU President Sandy Mackenzie's
veto of special appropriations legisla
tion last night.
By a vote of 30 to 26. LASSU also
"postponed indefinitely" a resolution
which called for a committee to inves
tigate the possibility ol a student ex
change with Red China.
As The Daily went to press, the
Legislature had just passed unani
mously a resolution calling upon the
administration to halt all action on
Union Residence until the Committee
of Fifteen has considered the ques
tion.
The vote on overriding Mackenzie's
veto was 46-18.
In general debate on the issue, Mac
kenzie stated that he had not vetoed
the legislation to express a strong
opinion on its merit. "The point was
not that there was no justification for
the appropriation, but that there was
insufficient justification," he said.
The vote to override Mackenzie's
veto upheld LASSU's decision last
week to provide funds for a Stanford
student to attend the Conference on
the Atlantic Community in Washing
ton. D.C.
Question and Answer Period
Toward the end of a long question
and answer period, Mackenzie stated
that he would be in favor of uphold
ing the original appropriation.
"This discussion has been extremely
gratifying to me," he told the assem
bly. "My only reason for vetoing was
to insure that it would be discussed
on this floor."
Although LASSU voted to override
the presidential veto, the Bylaws

Committee declared that Macken
zie's action was legal. There had been
some question earlier whether his
veto power legally applied to appro
priations of contingency and emer
gency funds.

"1 never questioned the good faith
of the individual who will use these
funds," Mackenzie said, "and I do not
do so now."
Under an agreement made with the
Legislature, the student will write a
fifteen page report on the conference
and will write a series of articles to
be printed in The Daily.

China Resolution
When the resolution was first
brought before the Legislature, a
move of "objection to consideration"
was defeated by a vote of 2o for con
sidering the resolution to 3.3 against
consideration. A vote of one-third is
needed to consider a resolution.
According to Robert's Rules of Or
der, the China Resolution cannot ap
pear before the Legislature during the
present session. Speaker Jay Kadane
ruled last night that a session of the
Legislature consisted of a single meet
ing.
A motion was then proposed from
the floor to reconsider the resolution.
At this point the procedure became
quite confused as another member of
the body proposed to lay the motion
for reconsideration on the table.
Kadane temporarily resolved the
problem by adjourning the body for
ten minutes. A quorum was barely
prcsenl upon reconvening.
Further consideration of the China
resolution was not taken up. The as
sembly amended the orders of the day
to then discuss the closing of Union
residence.
In a resolution presented by Steve
Gruber, the legislature was urged to
oppose the closing of Union and "de
mand that the deans of students find
other areas in which to conduct his
bureaucracy."
Imar Waldner. sponsor of the China
Resolution, said he drew up the reso
lution "to start people thinking about
the issue."
The resolution states that "the ris
ing political importance of the Peo
pie's Republic of China makes the
educational value of contact with this
culture increasingly apparent."
In other business, LASSU aproved a
proposed amendment to the consti
tution providing that the ASSU presi
dent and the Speaker along with cer
tain appointed by-laws committeemen,
be included in the Legislature as ex
officio members. The Speaker would
also be able to vote in case of tics.
The proposed amendment will
come before the student body for
approval in the f;ill elections.
LASSU also approved the appoint
ment of juniors Kit Anderson and
Melinda Sewall as Co-Chairmen for
the 196(5 Pro-Reg Committee.
