God's View of Man
We human beings like nothing better than (Philosophies and theories which
boost the ego and flatter us into thinking we are better off than we really are.
The God who made us has a different view and most accurately diagnoses our
condition when He speaks,
"There is none righteous, no, not one, none who understands none who
seeks after God.
All have turned aside, together fhey have gone wrong, no one does
good not even one.
Their throat is an open sepulchre, they use their tongues to deceive,
The venom of asps is under their lips, their mouth is full of cursing and
bitterness.
Their feet are swift to shed blood, destruction and misery are in their
ways,
And the way of peace they have not known, there is no fear of God
before their eyes" (Romans 3:10-1 8).
Our Creator, however, does not speak to us so frankly in order to drive us to
drink, but to help us, for unless we see our need, His cure will seem unneces
sary. Man's desperate plight on a dying planet is due to his utter depravity and
total infection with a disease called sin.
God's cure for sin is Jesus Christ. He, the one man without sin, became sin for
we sinners (2 Corinthinians 5:17). His death on the cross has become your
death, so that His resurrection life might be yours (Romans 6:3-4). Forseeing His
death on the cross for you and I the Old Testament says of Jesus Christ, "He
was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities, the
chastisement of our peace was upon Him, and with His stripes we are healed.
All we like sheep have gone astray and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of
us all" (Isaiah 53:5, 6).
Although you may just now be recognizing your condition before a most holy
God, be assured that He accepts you as you are and loves you as He finds you.
His love is more than able to meet your deepest need. ''For God so loved the
world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him
should not perish but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). Find out today, if you
haven't already, that Gods means what He says and is ready to prove it in life
to your complete satisfaction.
