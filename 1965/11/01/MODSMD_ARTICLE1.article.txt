# Role Of Campus Ministers Is Changing

### BRUCE CAMPBELL Assistant Editor 
< Fourth in a series)
The designation of the full-time
campus ministers as chaplain's asso
ciates formalizes the close tie to the
University developed by the ministers
in recent years and makes possible
their fuller participation and more
significant involvement in the life of
the University, UCCM minister Jim
Corson told thÂ« Daily Friday.
But the relation will not be com
pletely realized, lie emphasized, until
a satisfactory solution for the prob
lem of office space is reached; "only
then will the chaplain's associates be
on campus."
Motivation for the campus minis
ters' wanting to minister "within the
university community" is a changed
conception of the role of denomina
tional representatives in college
environments.
"The campus minister used to be

called a 'student worker,'" Corson re
lated. "His function was understood
as a holding operation, conserving for
tiie church those already active. His
intent was the protection of students
from tiie 'negative effects' of higher
education."
Exposure Not Protection
"The change in name to campus
minister is symbolic of a change in
philosophy, so we are now more inter
ested in exposure than protection and
our concern is broadened beyond that
of strictly student concerns," Corson
said.
"We are now challenging our stu
dents to a more valid and realistic
commitment than tiiat characteristic
of high school church experience. In
addition, our area of concern is broad
ened to include all members of the
academic community and our role is
redefined to be in an affirmative sup
porting relation to higher education.
"Religion cannot be overly-confident
of its grasp of truth. Rut it can with

integrity serve as a catalyst for 'hu
manizing' the educational process and
it should exist as a live faith option
for all who are members of the aca
demic community."
He expressed concern that the
"Christian style of life as an option
be presented in the best possible
way." To this end, he would "affirm
the religious studies program as a
tremendous asset on this campus." He
stressed informal study and discus
sion groups, exposure trips (such as
the recent UCCM visit to San Quen
tin), and "opportunities for relevant
social involvement" (such as tutor
ing). Worship completes tiie program;
"current trends indicate Memorial
Church's becoming an increasingly
more effective instrument in this
process."
Fart of University
Corson views the University's "re
cent recognition of the presence and
role of denominational groups and
their ministers as giving us much

greater freedom to function 011 cam
pus and as a regular part of univer
sity life."
"We understand tiie University to
lie saying that we can, in some ways,
be partners in our attempts to estab
lish a coordinated, well-balanced,
imaginative and stimulating ministry
wit bin the university community" he
said.
Cooperative Endeavor.
The ministers feel the securing of
on-campus office space "as a further
important step" in reaching their ob
jective. They view this possible gain
as important for giving them "closer
contact with members of the univer
sity community and the events of
university life, ready accessibility for
counseling and symbolic recognition
of our relatedness to the university
through our physical presence within
the university."
This fall Corson was named coordi
nator of the chaplain's staff and
works with the chaplain to plan the

weekly staff meetings which Corson
leads. "The staff meetings are an im
portant channel of communication
among tiie campus ministers and con
tribute to the spirit of being involved
in a cooperative endeavor," he stated.
He also noted "a shift in the nature
of the meetings from an emphasis
on information and coordination of
schedules to involvement in the cre
ation and development of programs.
Having this basis for cooperative ac
tion, we can now give attention to
finding adequate patterns to involve
students in the planning and execu
tion of programs."
On the issue of allowing all fri it lis
to worship on campus, he feels that
"the facts of our pluralistic society re*
quire a re-evaluation of current atti
tudes and practices. It is impossible
to meet the needs of individuals of
our community by offering a Protes
tant form of worship."
Worship
"It should be possible for the chap

lain, in consultation with the stuff, to
make provisions for a broader scope
of worship experience. It is particu
larly important that Roman Catholic
and Jewish members of the commu
nity bo given greater consideration."
Corson would also like to see "a
student-developed Stanford liturgy,
which would have particular signifi
cance for the academic community in
which it is located."
Corson, along with Richard Roc,
also a UCCM minister, spent a month
of the summer of 1964 as minister
counselors in Mississippi. Because of
ihe large number of Stanford stu
dents involved in the projects, Chap
lain Minto arranged to underwrite
their expenses, considering their par
ticipation as "a legitimate extension
of ministry to the Stanford commu
nity."
Both Roe and Stuart McLain, the
third UCCM minister, have visited
the grape strike area in Delano; Cor
son will make a trip there soon.
