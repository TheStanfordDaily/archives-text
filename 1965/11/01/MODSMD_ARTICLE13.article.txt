# Artist To Reside In Union
## 
### 
Stanford's new Artist-in-Resi
dene, Frank Lobdell, sees him
self not as a faculty member but
as "an older painter dealing with
younger ones."
Lobdell, on leave from the San
Francisco Art Institute, is mov
ing into a studio in the Old
Union where he will conduct
Wednesday evening seminars
for art students and individual
conferences with students.
Believing that art today con
tains more of the "philosophy
of the individual" than it has in
the past, Lobdell finds it diffi
cult to critize art. "Art is a com
plicated subject â€” there is no
right and wrong."
Consistent Attitude
To criticize the student work
in the seminars, Lobdell will
look mainly for "a consistent
attitude and view point." "Paint
ing is a visual thought process.
It's a language for the eye and
difficult to verbalize," he said.
"However," Lobdell explained,
"a painter sorts out any number
of experiences, and after a per
iod of time certain enthusiasms
l-emain." These are evident in a
painting.
"Painting is a state of relying
on instincts, moods," he added.
"In the long run what you're
after is clarity, economy."
Lobdell, who paints mainly in
oils because of the richness they
can achieve, will continue his
drawing and painting while in

residence. He would like to avoid
teaching. "I like to be completely
involved in what I'm doing, and
then whatever spills over to the
students will be of more value
to them than lectures," he said.
On his own work, Lobdell said,
"I don't think of my self as an
abstract painter. These things
are as real to me as another
person's figure or landscape. A 1
though there isn't anything on
the canvas that cannot be per
ceived, an artist is not satisfied
with obvious visual titillations."
