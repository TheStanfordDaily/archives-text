# Panel Discusses Frosh

### CHRIS HARTE 
Three professors and a dean
explained undergraduate educa
tion in the freshman year to
almost 1000 parents Saturday.
In a panel discussion after
wards, Dean Robert Wert and
Professors Albert Guerard, Eric
Hutchinson, and David Potter

characterized today's Stanford
student as more sophisticated,
mature, and idealistic than his
predecessor.
Professor Guerard spoke
about the special activities open
to freshmen and the foreign
campuses program.
He praised the experimental
program of freshman seminars
which is bringing over 250 stu
dents into close contact with
professors and advanced grad
uate students.
Under this program, groups of
two to eight students meet
weekly, often in homes of facul
ty members, to study and dis
cuss a wide variety of special
ized topics.
Freshman Seminars
Guerard also mentioned spec
ial sections of freshman English,
which during the winter and
spring quarters will allow 120
students to practice creative
writing instead of attending
their regular English classes.
He urged parents not to dis
courage their sons and daugh
ters from going to one of the
foreign campuses.
Emphasizing that "nothing is
more important than the foreign
campuses," he said that if it is
financially possible students
should be allowed a quarter of
independent travel in Europe
afterwards.
Professor Hutchinson dis
cussed science programs and the
faculty master program in Wil
bur Hall.
"Anyone who doesn't know
something about the electron
should be as ashamed as ii he
hadn't read some CicerÂ«," he
said.
He stressed that math, science,
and engineering majors are en
couraged to attend an overseas
campus.
Hutchinson said that his

major task as faculty master
is the conversion of Wilbur,
which has been in the past "a
bedroom and a filling station,
into an academic residence."
"Possibly my greatest job is
an attack on leisure," he said,
estimating that most Wilbur
residents waste four to five
hours a day.
"We must teach them that it
is not idleness to sit and think
or read a book which is not con
nected to any course they are
taking."
He mentioned that there are
approximately 65 faculty mem
bers who are associates in the
various houses of Wilbur and
eat meals with the students sev
eral times a week.
Professor Potter, executive
head of the history department,
said that the Western Civ course
"transcends history, and touches
on universal philosophical ques
tions, allowing the student to
work out for himself some of
the perennial human problems."
I/>st Revolution
Because of the amount of ma
terial to be covered, it is the
"type of course in which a stu
dent can drop his pencil, reach
down to pick it up, and miss thfl
American Revolution."
"There was a time," he said,
"when all professors knew each
others' fields and could teach
each others' classes, when all
students took the same courses
and came out: with the same
background."
Because today this has "fallen
beneath the demands of special
ization," he said, the Western
Civ course is necessary as gen
eral background for all other
work.
After the talks, Dean Wert
asked each member of the panel
to describe hi.s version of what
the Stanford student of today is.
Sleepless
Professor Hutchinson said
they were brighter and not so
accepting of everything as stu
dents years ago. but "still con
siderably disorganized, and rath
er sleepless."
modeling himself on the ficti
tious type called the Stanford
man," said Professor Potter,
"and has very high potentialities
and more motivation to make
the most of these potentialities."
Guerard commented that the
"present students are much bet
ter prepared for a University
culture as opposed to a college
culture, as evidenced by the
dwindling size of the football
rally."
Dean Wert ended the discus
sion by saying that today's stu
dent "is the most sophisticated,
best-traveled, most serious ever,
and feels that he can have great
efect on the world and it's
cause."
