The national fraternity of
Sigma Chi has once again run
into trouble over the alleged dis
criminatory clause in its consti
tution. Under similar circum
stances as Stanford's chapter,
the Brown chapter of Sigma Chi
fraternity has been told to dis
affiliate with its national organ
ization.
The action was taken at an
executive meeting of an advis
ory committee to the Brown Cor
poration on Oct. 15. It recom
mended that the Brown chapter
disaffiliate because of a clause
which reads: "a chapter will re
frain from proposing for mem
bership to our fellowship any
person who for any reason is
likely to be considered person
ally unacceptable as a brother
by any chapter anywhere."
Three other Brown fraterni
ties have gone local within the
past year. The Stanford Alpha
Omega chapter of Sigma Chi has
not gone local, and earlier this
year Frank Olrich, spokesman
for the group, said that they
were going to "stay with the
problem."
"The problem" was that they
had pledged a Negro, and, as a
result of their stand, are still
on suspension from the national
chapter.
