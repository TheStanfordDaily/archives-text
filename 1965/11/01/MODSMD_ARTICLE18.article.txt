By introducing epilepsy in lab
oratory animals, Dr. David A.
Prince, Stanford assistant pro
fessor of neurology, hopes to dis
cover how mechanisms in the
human brain can prevent epilep
tic seizures.
Dr. Prince, Who just began the
investigation under a $6,875
grant from the Epilepsy Foun
dation, said, "Patients with seiz
ures may have characteristic ab
normalities on their brain wave
recordings at times when at
tacks are completely controlled.
This shows that there are mech
anisms within the brain which
tend to keep the abnormal dis
charge in check and prevent it
from spreading to become a full
blown epileptic seizure."
To study these mechanisms
which limit the spread of the
epileptic discharge Dr. Prince
is inducing epilepsy in animals
and recording the electrical ac
tivity from within these animals'
cells.
Epilepsy is a symptom of
brain disease which affects some
two million Americans.
