# Prof Fears Red Activity On Campus

### 
Growing Communist activity on
US campuses may lead to demoraliza
tion which could trigger tho next war.
So stated Dr. Stefan T. Possony,
Director of the International Political
Studies Program at Hoover Institute
and a specialist in Red strategy, in an
interview for "US News and World
Report."
The Soviets will have an excellent
opportunity in the next few years to
exploit the US racial situation, the
cold war in Asia and Africa, and per
haps crises in the United Nations. Al
though they are not now willing to
risk a showdown with the United
States, demoralization within the US
"might leaf! to a very weak reaction
against the Soviet threat." In this
case, says Dr. Possony. demoraliza
tion would engender overconfidence
in the Kremlin which may bo the
factor to trigger the next war.
Communist activity on campuses
today is not oriented to the old
Moscow-led Communist Party of the
United States but to the Peiping
influenced Progressive Labor Party.
There are also a number of Castroite
and radical left-wing groups, Dr. Pos
sony said. These groups were directed
several years ago to increase their
activities on American campuses.
Communists Recruitt*!
Although total enrollment in Com
munist activities on American cam
puses is small, Dr. Possony said, the
Communists view their work as "a
recruiting operation which is expected
to pay off in the future." The Com
munist game "is not a game of num
bers, but a game for influence." Only
5 to 15'; of the present members will
stay with the movement, but these
will in effect be the Communist rev
olutionaries for the America of to
morrow. Should a war take place,
these revolutionaries will be available
to run revolutionary operations inside
the US to facilitate Communist vic
tory, he continued.
The danger in the present Vietnam
demonstrations is that a genuine paci
fist with American ideals may inad
vertantly be aiding a Communist
working from entirely different prem
ises. When anyone who is not a Com
munist finds himself following the
Communist line in any particular, he
must ask himself if he is making his
point in terms of an American
message.
.The Communists are not "really in
terested in the same things we are":
it makes no sense to debate with
them, Dr. Possony feels. Furthermore
a person is not very convincing as a
humanitarian if. "in addition to crit
icizing our actions, he never criticizes
Communist terror, and even denies it
exists," he said.

munist finds himself following the
Communist line in any particular, he
must ask himself if he is making his
point in terms of an American
message.
.The Communists are not "really in
terested in the same things we are":
it makes no sense to debate with
them, Dr. Possony feels. Furthermore
a person is not very convincing as a
humanitarian if. "in addition to crit
icizing our actions, he never criticizes
Communist terror, and even denies it
exists," he said.
Growing Communist activity on
US campuses may lead to demoraliza
tion which could trigger tho next war.
So stated Dr. Stefan T. Possony,
Director of the International Political
Studies Program at Hoover Institute
and a specialist in Red strategy, in an
interview for "US News and World
Report."
The Soviets will have an excellent
opportunity in the next few years to
exploit the US racial situation, the
cold war in Asia and Africa, and per
haps crises in the United Nations. Al
though they are not now willing to
risk a showdown with the United
States, demoralization within the US
"might leaf! to a very weak reaction
against the Soviet threat." In this
case, says Dr. Possony. demoraliza
tion would engender overconfidence
in the Kremlin which may bo the
factor to trigger the next war.
Communist activity on campuses
today is not oriented to the old
Moscow-led Communist Party of the
United States but to the Peiping
influenced Progressive Labor Party.
There are also a number of Castroite
and radical left-wing groups, Dr. Pos
sony said. These groups were directed
several years ago to increase their
activities on American campuses.
Communists Recruitt*!
Although total enrollment in Com
munist activities on American cam
puses is small, Dr. Possony said, the
Communists view their work as "a
recruiting operation which is expected
to pay off in the future." The Com
munist game "is not a game of num
bers, but a game for influence." Only
5 to 15'; of the present members will
stay with the movement, but these
will in effect be the Communist rev
olutionaries for the America of to
morrow. Should a war take place,
these revolutionaries will be available
to run revolutionary operations inside
the US to facilitate Communist vic
tory, he continued.
The danger in the present Vietnam
demonstrations is that a genuine paci
fist with American ideals may inad
vertantly be aiding a Communist
working from entirely different prem
ises. When anyone who is not a Com
munist finds himself following the
Communist line in any particular, he
must ask himself if he is making his
point in terms of an American
message.
