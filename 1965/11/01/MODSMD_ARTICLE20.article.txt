Action in a recent water polo game finds Stanford's
(iary Sheerer (24) about to chuck the go ahead
goal over the outstretched arms of the goalie,
i'ete Beady (25) screens off defenders while Mike
Hshieman, at far side, looks on. Both K(>ady and
lOshleman scored once in last Saturday's game
with the top ranked UC LA Bruins, while Sheerer
watched with a broken hand.
