# Indian Poloists Drop 5-3 Bout To Top-Ranked UCLA Bruins
## 
### WELLS SHOEMAKER 
UCLA preserved its number
one national ranking as it pushed
past Stanford's water polo team,
5-3, here last Saturday. The Bru
ins, with two Olympians in their
lineup, struck early and late
while limiting the Cards to one
goal in each of the last three
periods.
The largest crowd this year at
the Encina Pool saw Stan Cole,
Bruin Olympian, score for
UCLA in the opening moments
of the game. Cole, who scored
six goals in UCLA's 7-6 win over
the tribe earlier this year, took
the ball after UCLA controlled
the sprint and fired the goal
from half-court.
Shortly after Cole's bomb,
Bruin Winn Condict aced another
to put Stanford in the hole to
the tune of two goals early in
the first period.
Cards Settle Down
The Indians then settled down
and kept the Bruins off the
scoreboard for the rest of the
half. Stanford could not muster
a score in the first period, and
w a s equally unsuccessful
through most of the second
quarter.
Pete Ready found Bruins on
his back every time he got into
the hole, from which he has
proven himself so deadly a shot
this year. Three times in the sec
ond period his attempts were
stifled by alert Uclans.
Then, with three seconds left,
in the first half. Ready wheeled
and found the back of the net
with his shot.
Down 2-1 going into the sec

«nc! half, Die Cards quickly
moved to tie the score. Ready
throw a perfect sot up pass to
Bill Meyer who fired past the
UCLA goalie for the score.
UC LA Breaks Tie
Stanford's tied relationship
with its southern adversary did
not last long. Cole and Condict
eaeh scored late in the third pe
riod, and the Bruins' Campbell
threw in his first goal to drop
the Indians in the bueket, f5-2,
with one quarter left to play.
By the start of the last period,
the entire Uclan starting line-up
was in foul danger. Five Bruins
left the game after incurring the
four foul limit, and three others
had three fouls. Stanford shoot
ers found several offensive ad
vantages taken away when Bru
in hatchet-advocate substitutes
commit ted strategic fouls.
The foul committed on Mike
Eshleman early in the fourth
period, however, was not so;
strategic. The referee judged j
that Eshleman was inside the 4 !
yard line and in scoring posi
tion, and awarded him a penalty j
shot.
Eshleman, who has not missed
a penalty throw in two years,
brought Stanford within 2 goals
of the Bruins with his score.
No More Goals
Unfortunately for the Indians,
that is where the scoring ended.
UCLA managed to control the.
ball for the major part of the
remaining four minutes, while |
three Stanford shots could not
find the canvas. The game ended
with UCLA on top, 5-3. and on ,
top of the nation as well.

Stanford next sees action this

goals against the Trojan goalies,
will watch this game from the
sidelines. Sheerer broke his hand
last week.
