# Huskies Humble Indians, 41-8
## 
### JOHN MERRILL 
The expected Seattle rain did
not materialize but a deluge of
Washington passes ami scoring
did as the Huskies crushed Stan
ford 41-8 before 51,000 fans on
Saturday.
The Huskies were sparked by
the Tod llullin-Dave Williams
pass combination which broke
the University of Washington
pass reception record for one
game.
Williams caught ten passes
for the game, nine in the first
half. The first half catches were
the ones that broke the Indians'
back. Williams, 6-3, 190 pound
acrobat, took short passes from
Hullin and repeatedly dodged
Stanford defenders for first
down yardage.
Worst Defeat Ever
The defeat, the worst ever for
a John Ralston-coached team,
was evident from the opening
kickoff. Coach Ralston later said
that, "The kickoff was as much
a turning points as any other
part of the game."
Tom Ross kicked off and the

ball traveled 53 yards. Washing
ton's Steve Bramwell returned
it 49 yards to the Stanford 14,
before Craig Ritchey could
make the stop.
Next came the first in the se
ries of Hullin-Williams passes,
good for 4 yards. Ron Medved
then took the ball to the Stan
ford 27. Don Moore, the Huskies'
outstanding sophomore back,
went for two yards and Roger
Clay got in to block Hullin's
next passing attempt.
Hullin to Williams —Again
Then Hullin hit Williams
again for eight yards and a first
down. At this point the Indian
defense stiffened and the few
Stanford fans took hope. The
Tribe took over on their own 8
after four unsuccessful Wash
ington attempts to score.
Stanford could do little with
the ball in this first series of
downs and was forced to punt in
a four and one situation. Dave
Lewis got off his first of many
fine punts, but Dave Dinish re
turned it for 14 yards and put
the Huskies in good field posi

lion again. This time the Husk
ies went 53 yards in 11 plays to
score, on a Tod Hullin pass to
Bruce Kraemer.
This first drive was the long
est of the day as the Huskies'
subsequent orfies covered 52, 46,
17, 25, and 20 yards. However
the Indians did show flashes of
former defensive brilliance in
holding Washington until the
second quarter.
R4H't*iver Falls
Washington's Bill Stifter, on
the second play of the quarter,
intercepted a Lewis pass intend
ed for Bob Conrad, who had
fallen. In seven plays the Husk
ies were threatening on the
Stanford 32 even though their
drive had been stalled once by
a holding penalty that took
away a Bramwell long gainer.
Hullin then passed to Bram
well in the end zone where pass
interference was called. The pen
alty put the ball on the one yard
line where Marty Brill held Don
Moore to no gain.
But on the next down, Medved
hurdled over the pile at left,
guard for the second score.
After Donn Renwick returned
the kickoff for 19 yards (he was
later injured on another return
attempt) the Indians had one of
the most dismal series of downs
ol' the whole day.
A Dismal Series
Ray Handley went for two
yards on a pitchout. The next
pitchout attempt was wild and
John Read barely recovered the
fumble. Lewis was then dropped
for a seven yard loss on a pass
ing try.
On his own 13 Lewis got a 59
yard punt only to have Bram
well return it 26 yards. Bram
well at 150 pounds and Dave
Dinish at 155 were thorns in the
Stanford side all day, on both
kickoffs and punts.
Though troubled by penalties
and their own miscues, the
Huskies marched 54 yards in 12
plays for their final score of the
first half. Hullin threw 4 passes
for 37 yards in this drive with
Dave Williams catching the TD
pass.
After the kickoff, Stanford be
gan what seemed might be an
offensive drive. The Tribe was
down to the Washington 18 yard
line before a fourth and one try
by John Read was stopped for
no gain. The half ended with
Washington holding a 20-0 lead.
Two More Si-ores
Washington scored two more
times in the third quarter
thanks to two Stanford miscues
deep in their own territory.
Washington had been forced to
punt after they had stopped
Stanford's initial second half of
fensive series, and Stanford took
over on their own 16 yard line.
Dave Lewis fumbled the first
play from scrimmage and Steve
Hinds recovered for the Huskies.
Two plays later Ron Medved
ran 11 yards for the touchdown.
After this touchdown the
Stanford attack again stalled on
offense and Lewis went back to
kick the Indians out of a hole.
Tom Greenlee, playing an out
standing game on defense for
Washington, blocked the punt

and Washington took over on
the Stanford 25.
It took six plays to go over
this time and Don Moore did the
damage from the one yard line.
Before this the Indians had stub
bornly held on the one for three
plays with Bill Ogle and Glenn
Myers holding the line.
Fair Catch Fumble
Craig Ritchey's fumble of a
fair catch led to the final Uni
versity of Washington score,
this in the fourth quarter. Re
serve quarterback Frank Etter
went over from the one yard
line for the 6 points which "broke
the old scoring record for the
Stanford-Washington s cries.
Stanford had previously held the
high total with 40 points scored
in 1893 and 1919.
Stanford finally got on the
scoreboard late in the fourth
quarter. Washington had fum
bled on their own 32 and Terry
De Sylvia took the Tribe in to
score in 10 plays. Jack Root and
Ray Handley sparked the drive
with short line gains. Handley
•scored both the TD and the two

point conversion.
This was actually ihp first
time that the Indians had had
the ball long enough to do any- ;
thing wilh it. As Coach Ralston
later said, "'There was nothing j
wrong with our offense except t
that we hardly had the ball."
Sweet Revenge
The victory was sweet revenge j
for Washington who had been i
humbled in the same way three]
weeks before by USC, 31-0. The I
Husky Coach, Jim Owens, said, I
"We just put everything togeth- i
or for a change."
After the game, Ralston, j
I hough saddened by what he !
called, "an old-fashioned lick- j
ing" said that there would be no ;
doubt lhat the Indians could get ;
back "up" for the Tulane game |
next week.
If the Washington victory
Saturday, as well as Cal's come
back victory over Penn State
after being crushed by UCLA.
56-3, are any indication of what
teams do when they "get back ;
up," Tulane had better be ready j
for Stanford.
