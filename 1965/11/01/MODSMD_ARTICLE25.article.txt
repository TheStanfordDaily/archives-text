# Tribe Kicks SFS, 4-3, In Overtime
## 
### TOM EDISON 
"We absolutely picked 'em
up and laid 'em down," was how
John Cox described Stanford's
4-3 soccer victory over San Fran
cisco State. The outcome was
not decided until ten minutes
of overtime had been completed.
Having beaten San Francisco
every time they have met in the
last three years, the Indians
knew they were in for a battle
from the start. Stanford beat
SF, 8-3, (he first time they met.
On several occasions the game
almost turned into a brawl.
Stanford's Kamel Kadi, definit
ely one of the best players in
the league, was carried off the
field early in the first half with
an injury.
Victory Without Kadi
Dany Boyd and Tito Bianehi
were the top offensive players
for the Indians who showed that
they could produce victory with
out the services of Kadi.
Boyd tucked in the first and
final goals for Stanford.
Although the contest ended in
a tie, Stanford definitely out
played San Francisco. As Coach
Bill White phrased it, "we play
ed our best and roughest game

of the season."
Stanford took more shots and i
produced passes pi'otty potent, ;
putting pressure on SF's goalie.
Defensively John Brandt and j
Dave Mock were the standouts. J
SF Starts Scoring
San Francisco started the j
scoring and led. although by not i
more than one point, throughout j
most of the contest. The Indians ;
tying score came with about five
minutes of play left off the boot
of Tito Bianchi.
Besides scoring the tying j
goal, Bianchi also flung a death- j
defying block on a SF player !
that partially paid back Frisco
for their previous hair-grabbing j
and face-slapping.
With the mix-ups that have j
thus far been a part of the con- J
ference, Stanford's 4-3 record
may still be good enough for
first place with the University |
of San Francisco their next op
ponent.
