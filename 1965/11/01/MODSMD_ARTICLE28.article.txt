# Saving The Union
## 
### 
In a rare display of unanimity, the Legis
lature last Thursday called upon the Adminis
tration to postpone all action relating to the
scheduled January closure of Union Residence
until the Committee of 15 has considered the
problem.
Tonight, the Committee will meet, and we
would hope that some way might be found to
save the Union, at least until the end of the
academic year.
It is argued that such a move would not only
delay the relocation of the Deans offices and
the Counselling and Testing Service in the old
Union, but it would also leave the University
with an approximately 110-unit high rise apart
ment building in Escondido sans occupants.
We find neither of these arguments compel
ling. The Administration has already admitted
that the renovation of Union will not begin on
schedule, although no public announcement has
yet been made as to just how great a delay is
envisioned. Thus, Union may be left vacant for
some months if closed on schedule. Second, we
would suggest that the no-odd units in Escon
dido could either be utilized to ease the over
crowding in other women's residences — par
ticularly Lagunita — or to house the many un
dergraduate men who tried to get into 011-
campus residences this Fall and failed. Indeed,
there may even be enough transfers next quar
ter to fill the space.
Therefore, it may well be feasible to keep
Union a residence hall until Spring.
Such a solution would only be temporary and.

unlike some, we think it should be. The concept
of a unified office of student services in a cen
tral location is a sound one. Surely the unique
entity that is Union Residence can be trans
ported to a different locale, provided that
locale has some resemblance to a residence hall.
Moreover, this entire episode underscores
yet another problem, one that is all too often
encountered here — the lack of consultation
with students prior to administrative pro
nouncements. Thus, all the student body can
do is react, as has been the case in the Union
controversy.
On two well-publicized occasions last year,
Dean Robert |. Wert's subcommittee on hous
ing—a subsidiary of the Committee of the Aca
demic Council 011 Undergraduate Education
made major policy announcements in an cx
ileus machina manner. The closing of Union
as well as the installation of a Faculty Master
at Wilbur Hall were decisions that were
reached without direct student consultation.
This year, Dean Wert has promised to name
some students to this subcommittee. However,
the Dean has not yet chosen the faculty mem
bers for the subcommittee and the ASSU Presi
dent has not yet supplied the Dean with a list
of recommendations for student members.
Since this subcommittee will be dealing with
a Master Plan for the Future of Undergraduate
Housing—among other relevant items—we
would hope that its membership might be ascer
tained in the near future.
Or else there will! undoubtedly be more
problems of the Union genre.

Union, but it would also leave the University
with an approximately 110-unit high rise apart
ment building in Escondido sans occupants.
We find neither of these arguments compel
ling. The Administration has already admitted
that the renovation of Union will not begin on
schedule, although no public announcement has
yet been made as to just how great a delay is
envisioned. Thus, Union may be left vacant for
some months if closed on schedule. Second, we
would suggest that the no-odd units in Escon
dido could either be utilized to ease the over
crowding in other women's residences — par
ticularly Lagunita — or to house the many un
dergraduate men who tried to get into 011-
campus residences this Fall and failed. Indeed,
there may even be enough transfers next quar
ter to fill the space.
Therefore, it may well be feasible to keep
Union a residence hall until Spring.
Such a solution would only be temporary and.

unlike some, we think it should be. The concept
of a unified office of student services in a cen
tral location is a sound one. Surely the unique
entity that is Union Residence can be trans
ported to a different locale, provided that
locale has some resemblance to a residence hall.
Moreover, this entire episode underscores
yet another problem, one that is all too often
encountered here — the lack of consultation
with students prior to administrative pro
nouncements. Thus, all the student body can
do is react, as has been the case in the Union
controversy.
On two well-publicized occasions last year,
Dean Robert |. Wert's subcommittee on hous
ing—a subsidiary of the Committee of the Aca
demic Council 011 Undergraduate Education
made major policy announcements in an cx
ileus machina manner. The closing of Union
as well as the installation of a Faculty Master
at Wilbur Hall were decisions that were
reached without direct student consultation.
This year, Dean Wert has promised to name
some students to this subcommittee. However,
the Dean has not yet chosen the faculty mem
bers for the subcommittee and the ASSU Presi
dent has not yet supplied the Dean with a list
of recommendations for student members.
Since this subcommittee will be dealing with
a Master Plan for the Future of Undergraduate
Housing—among other relevant items—we
would hope that its membership might be ascer
tained in the near future.
Or else there will! undoubtedly be more
problems of the Union genre.
In a rare display of unanimity, the Legis
lature last Thursday called upon the Adminis
tration to postpone all action relating to the
scheduled January closure of Union Residence
until the Committee of 15 has considered the
problem.
Tonight, the Committee will meet, and we
would hope that some way might be found to
save the Union, at least until the end of the
academic year.
It is argued that such a move would not only
delay the relocation of the Deans offices and
the Counselling and Testing Service in the old
Union, but it would also leave the University
with an approximately 110-unit high rise apart
ment building in Escondido sans occupants.
