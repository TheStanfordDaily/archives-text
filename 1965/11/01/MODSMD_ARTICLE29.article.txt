Editor, The Daily:
After reading Prof. Lyman's
letter concerning the editorial
on the death of student drama
at Stanford, I can't help but fee)
he has missed the entire point
of the problem. That point is
basically this: does a university
exist as a producer, as it were,
of professional drama or, rather,
as a place where those inter
ested i»i going into professional
theatre can gain an education
and experience adequate enough
to prepare them for this field.
Perhaps Prof. Lvman would
say, "Both." That's fine ... if it
can be accomplished. No doubt
many of the M.F.A. candidates
would swear heartily that it is
indeed being accomplished. For
them, yes. For the undergrad
uate, no. The difference is clear
each of the M.F.A. candidates
has already been through four
years of training and learning
in undergraduate drama. We
have many who have gone to
schools which seem to feel that
undergraduate drama is indeed
at. least as important as grad
uate and which have
decent undergraduate programs
somewhat comparable to the
programs for graduates.
Even Stanford realizes the
fact the the undergraduates
must have something, no matter
what. They've given them that
marvelous little monstrosity, the
Nitery, and even that is split
between two groups, the depart
ment and Ram's Head. In a few
years Stanford hopes to have a
new theatre for the Mem Aud -
that delightful acoustical mon
strosity recently declared a fire
hazard.
Prof. Lyman, I agree with you
that the university should cer
tainly be a major part of the
growth of the theatre. I think
a professional company like
Stanford's is an asset and a
credit to the school . . . only if
it does not seriously interfere
with and, in this case, practic
ally annhilate respectable under
graduate theatre.
Stanford should make tip its
mind.
Either eliminate its inade
quate, half-hearted attempt at
an undergraduate drama pro
gram and completely support
the graduate and professional
theatre, or else set up the pro
fessionals in a capacity that they
do not interfere with or stunf
the efforts of the undergradu
ates.
Instead of waiting for the new
theatre to be built before bring
ing the repertory company in,
Stanford, in I lie haste to add a

new feather to its cap, has rush
ed the two together and has
caused the deterioration of one
and a wide-spread dislike for the
other.

• What's Dead Where?
Editor, The Daily:
The Daily has reprinted Mr.
Jacobs' editorial on the collapse
of Stanford's Undergraduate
Drama Program and the murder
of Ram's Head. The article is
headed with the statement that
conditions are the same as when
the editorial was written and
that his criticisms are as perti
nent. Indeed the conditions are
the same and the criticisms are
as unfounded as they were when
written, so perhaps some answer
should be given Mr. Jacobs and
The Daily.
Since the "main victim" for
Mr. Jacobs is Ram's Head, let
us look at their predicament
first. "Gaieties," as Mr. Jacobs
notes, is still with us. The Win
ter One-Acts, far from being
"hopelessly lost" has simply
been moved to the Spring and
with Ram's Head's endorsement
been given' qualified directions
supplied by the Drama Depart
ment. The hope of the Drama
Department is that student di
rectors will get a chance to di
rect; the hope of Ram's Head is
that some kind of trained direc
tion might help the production
of original scripts. The Spring
Show will "not become a thing
of the past" but will be pro
duced in the Little Theatre in
the winter. We in the Drama
Department have not as yet
been notified what will be pro
duced but the time and space is
assigned to Ram's Head. So
much for misinformation.
The second criticism, that of
the collapse of undergraduate
drama, is to us the real reason
to answer this article. The new
program which includes a pro
fessional drama company is
probably the best thing that has
happened to undergraduate dra
ma at Stanford in years. Under
graduates have traditionally had
to compete with graduate stu
dents for parts in plays. As a
consequence they have gotten
but small parts, if any, and had
relatively little experience with
faeully directors. Directors sim
ply don't have time to work
with the kind of intensity young
actors need when those young
actors are playing bits.
The present program offers a
series of undergraduate shows

in the Nitery that will be di
rected by faculty and profes
sional directors and will be east,
entirely from the undergraduate
student body. This means that
undergraduates will get the kind
of attention they deserve and
need as students in theatre. This
fall, for example, Professor Lo
per, Head of the Drama Depart
ment, is directing an original
one-act play. "In a Cold Hotel,"
the cast of which is entirely un
dergraduate. Mr, Glenn Cannon,
a member of t he professional
company, excited by both the
freedom of the Nitery (any kind
of staging is possible) and the
chance to work with beginning
actors, is directing another orig
inal one-act play, "The One Hun
dred and First." In the winter,
Mr. Iliken of the drama staff
and Mr. Shapiro, one of the pro
fessional directors in residence,
Will both direct undergraduate

productions in the Nitery.
It has always seemed to me
thai one horror in drama de
partments in a university is
their insistence on letting un
trained undergraduates present
their theatrical image to an
adoring or unadoring public.
Thi> reaction is seldom honest.
Always underneath any adula
tion is the understood or stated
"for a college production." As a
consequence, students get a
false sense of their own talent
and audiences gradually lose
their taste. Most of them, very
sensibly, go to movies.
Far from a "death of student
drama," the new program at
Stanford is one of the few hopes
in this country for its salvation,
the salvation not only of student
drama, but drama itself.
