# LASSU Requests Study On Closing Of Union Hall
## 
### MIKE COUZENS 
Union residents emerged from
a parliamentary forest last
Thursday with the support of
the legislature. A heated clash
on student exchange with Red
China preceded the action.
But legislators voiced unani
mity that Union should be used
for quarters, not cubicles. A
resolution, drafted by Rules
Committee and presented by
Muriel Dance, substitute Union
representative, read in part:
WHEREAS: The desire of Un
ion residents to keep their
present housing deserves the
attention of student govern
ment and raises broad ques
tions of housing plans for
the future; be it therefore
RESOLVED: That Legislature
instructs its members of the
Committee of Fifteen to sub
mit the issue of Union Resi
dence with first priority for
discussion . . . And be it fur
ther
RESOLVED: That Legislature
calls upon the administration
not to begin removal of the
residents of Union until they
have considered all the rele
vant issues.
Included was a postponement
of the women's draw by AWS
from Nov. 11 to Nov. 23, in order
that the Committee of Fifteen
can consider Union's situation.

Their first meeting will be to
day, to discuss procedures for
future meetings.
Expected to draw for ot her
housing arc 7S Union women
who have strongly resisted their
imminent departure since its an
nouncement last spring.
Educational Experience
Miss Dance spoke primarily
about Union. "We feel," she said,
"we have developed a tradition,
and we would like to remain in
tact."
But the debate assumed a
more general tone Kenny Wash
ington of Sigma Chi expressed
conviction thai Ihe residence was
a crucial part of t ho educational
experience. Jim Stein of Human
ities and Sciences, argued en
thusiastically that students
should be consulted in housing
developments. The Dean's Of
fice, lie vociferated, had been
um-eceptive in the past.
After other speeches for the
legislation, Frank Vierlot of En
gineering, an articulate member
of Young Republicans, moved
that the vote be made unani
mous. There was no objection.
Committee of Fifteen
Significant was the willing
ness of Legislature to defer the
question of liquor policy in the
Committee of Fifteen until Un
ion's case could be heard.
The debate expressed intense
interest in housing plans and
decisions. Changes in the Dean's
Office since last year portend
well that the University adminis
tration wishes to acknowledge
this. Union's protest will be
heard. Hopefully it will he heed
ed, at least to the extent Ihat the
group can be moved together to
another building.
More generally, Union's pre
dicament should reflect upon fu
ture residence decisions. As the
legislators indicated, broad goals
of Stanford's dormitories must
bear some relation to the desires
of t heir occupants.
Enlightenment
Christopher Jencks and David
Riesman in The American Col
lege (Nevitt. Sanford. ed.» pre
sent this caricature:
"At an average cost of rough
ly $4000 per student, the typical
student residence joins two stu
dents, two beds, two bureaus,
two desks, two straight chairs
and 200 square feet of floor in
an effort to produce enlighten
ment."
Enlightenment, at a mini
mum, will come when students
are happy enough with their
housing to use it for more than
food and sleep.

who have strongly resisted their
imminent departure since its an
nouncement last spring.
Educational Experience
Miss Dance spoke primarily
about Union. "We feel," she said,
"we have developed a tradition,
and we would like to remain in
tact."
But the debate assumed a
more general tone Kenny Wash
ington of Sigma Chi expressed
conviction thai Ihe residence was
a crucial part of t ho educational
experience. Jim Stein of Human
ities and Sciences, argued en
thusiastically that students
should be consulted in housing
developments. The Dean's Of
fice, lie vociferated, had been
um-eceptive in the past.
After other speeches for the
legislation, Frank Vierlot of En
gineering, an articulate member
of Young Republicans, moved
that the vote be made unani
mous. There was no objection.
Committee of Fifteen
Significant was the willing
ness of Legislature to defer the
question of liquor policy in the
Committee of Fifteen until Un
ion's case could be heard.
The debate expressed intense
interest in housing plans and
decisions. Changes in the Dean's
Office since last year portend
well that the University adminis
tration wishes to acknowledge
this. Union's protest will be
heard. Hopefully it will he heed
ed, at least to the extent Ihat the
group can be moved together to
another building.
More generally, Union's pre
dicament should reflect upon fu
ture residence decisions. As the
legislators indicated, broad goals
of Stanford's dormitories must
bear some relation to the desires
of t heir occupants.
Enlightenment
Christopher Jencks and David
Riesman in The American Col
lege (Nevitt. Sanford. ed.» pre
sent this caricature:
"At an average cost of rough
ly $4000 per student, the typical
student residence joins two stu
dents, two beds, two bureaus,
two desks, two straight chairs
and 200 square feet of floor in
an effort to produce enlighten
ment."
Enlightenment, at a mini
mum, will come when students
are happy enough with their
housing to use it for more than
food and sleep.
Union residents emerged from
a parliamentary forest last
Thursday with the support of
the legislature. A heated clash
on student exchange with Red
China preceded the action.
But legislators voiced unani
mity that Union should be used
for quarters, not cubicles. A
resolution, drafted by Rules
Committee and presented by
Muriel Dance, substitute Union
representative, read in part:
WHEREAS: The desire of Un
ion residents to keep their
present housing deserves the
attention of student govern
ment and raises broad ques
tions of housing plans for
the future; be it therefore
RESOLVED: That Legislature
instructs its members of the
Committee of Fifteen to sub
mit the issue of Union Resi
dence with first priority for
discussion . . . And be it fur
ther
RESOLVED: That Legislature
calls upon the administration
not to begin removal of the
residents of Union until they
have considered all the rele
vant issues.
Included was a postponement
of the women's draw by AWS
from Nov. 11 to Nov. 23, in order
that the Committee of Fifteen
can consider Union's situation.

Their first meeting will be to
day, to discuss procedures for
future meetings.
