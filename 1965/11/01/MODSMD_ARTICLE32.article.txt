## The 						Fine Art Of Enlisting Or How To Dodge Draft-dodging 
### 
There have been so many ar
ticles and phamphlets written on
"How to Avoid the Draft" that
it is only right someone should
put out instructions on "How to
Be Drafted." I know I'll be criti
cized for this, but under the
American system a person has
as much right to be drafted as
he does to avoid it.
The First Thing To Do
Notify your draft board that
you are ready to go immediately
and tell them you want to leave
in the next draft call. They will
probably turn your case over to
the local psychiatrist in your dis
trict.
Meeting With The Psychiatrist
Tell the psychiatrist that you
are eager to get into uniform
and your only hope is that as
soon as you've finished basic
training they'll send you to Viet
Nam. If he asks you why you
want to go, tell him you believe
it's your patriotic duty to de
fend your flag and country. You
want to protect your home, your
mother, and the unborn millions
of American children against
the spectre of godless commun
ism.
He will undoubtedly declare
volt I I''on the irrounds (hat anv

one who is so eager to get into
the Army is nuts.
You Have A Right To Appeal
Write to Gen. Hcrshey of the
Selective Service in Washington,
D.C., and give him the facts. Tell
him your draft board has been
scheming to prevent you from
going into the Army. Imply that
tiie psychiatrist who examined
you had it in for you because
you wanted to fight for your
country.
Insist thai Gen. Hcrshey sign
your orders himself which will
make it possible for you to go
into the service immediately.
He will turn your letter over
to the FBI to se if there is any
communism mixed up in your
psychiatric background.
When The FBI Conies To
Visit Your Holilc
You have a right lo answer
any question the FBI asks you.
They may insist thai you take
the Fifth Amendment you
can be listed as a security risk.
But stand on your Constitution
al grounds and reply to their
questions. If they ask you why
you want to be drafted, 1 ell them
you're sick and tired of read
ing about guys burning up their
draft cards and pretending they

are homosexuals just lo go out
of the service.
Show respect to the agents
find say "sir" to them. Tell them
you have always admired the
FBI and ask I hem if they can
get you an autographed picture
of J. Edgar Hoover. The more
forthright you are. the more sus
picious they'll get. When they
discover you've never joined any
left wing organizations, they'll
know something is fishy and
from then on they'll keep a close
eye on you.
Voli Can Always Picket
When Uiings look black, you
can picket the Pentagon demand
ing that Secretary McNamara
overrule your local draft board
and take you into the service.
If need be, lie down in front of
a troop train taking draftees to
camp and urge the troop com
mander to take you on board.
You will probably be locked
up. but at least you will have
made your point.
When All Klsc Fails
Anounce to the newspapers
t hat you have no intention of
being drafted and that you are
against the war in Viet Nam.
The draft board will take you
immediately and the Army will
make a soldier «»f you overnight.

immediately and the Army will
make a soldier «»f you overnight.

There have been so many ar
ticles and phamphlets written on
"How to Avoid the Draft" that
it is only right someone should
put out instructions on "How to
Be Drafted." I know I'll be criti
cized for this, but under the
American system a person has
as much right to be drafted as
he does to avoid it.
The First Thing To Do
Notify your draft board that
you are ready to go immediately
and tell them you want to leave
in the next draft call. They will
probably turn your case over to
the local psychiatrist in your dis
trict.
Meeting With The Psychiatrist
Tell the psychiatrist that you
are eager to get into uniform
and your only hope is that as
soon as you've finished basic
training they'll send you to Viet
Nam. If he asks you why you
want to go, tell him you believe
it's your patriotic duty to de
fend your flag and country. You
want to protect your home, your
mother, and the unborn millions
of American children against
the spectre of godless commun
ism.
He will undoubtedly declare
volt I I''on the irrounds (hat anv

one who is so eager to get into
the Army is nuts.
You Have A Right To Appeal
Write to Gen. Hcrshey of the
Selective Service in Washington,
D.C., and give him the facts. Tell
him your draft board has been
scheming to prevent you from
going into the Army. Imply that
tiie psychiatrist who examined
you had it in for you because
you wanted to fight for your
country.
Insist thai Gen. Hcrshey sign
your orders himself which will
make it possible for you to go
into the service immediately.
He will turn your letter over
to the FBI to se if there is any
communism mixed up in your
psychiatric background.
When The FBI Conies To
Visit Your Holilc
You have a right lo answer
any question the FBI asks you.
They may insist thai you take
the Fifth Amendment you
can be listed as a security risk.
But stand on your Constitution
al grounds and reply to their
questions. If they ask you why
you want to be drafted, 1 ell them
you're sick and tired of read
ing about guys burning up their
draft cards and pretending they

are homosexuals just lo go out
of the service.
Show respect to the agents
find say "sir" to them. Tell them
you have always admired the
FBI and ask I hem if they can
get you an autographed picture
of J. Edgar Hoover. The more
forthright you are. the more sus
picious they'll get. When they
discover you've never joined any
left wing organizations, they'll
know something is fishy and
from then on they'll keep a close
eye on you.
Voli Can Always Picket
When Uiings look black, you
can picket the Pentagon demand
ing that Secretary McNamara
overrule your local draft board
and take you into the service.
If need be, lie down in front of
a troop train taking draftees to
camp and urge the troop com
mander to take you on board.
You will probably be locked
up. but at least you will have
made your point.
When All Klsc Fails
Anounce to the newspapers
t hat you have no intention of
being drafted and that you are
against the war in Viet Nam.
The draft board will take you
immediately and the Army will
make a soldier «»f you overnight.
